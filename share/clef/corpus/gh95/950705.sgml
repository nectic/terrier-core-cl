TO the winner goes the spoils.
AND TONY BLAIR CAN HARDLY KEEP THE GRIN OFF HIS FACE.
Prime Minister John Major's leadership victory has all but handed
Labour the keys to No 10.
Despite the bluster and double-dealing of the past few days the result
could hardly be clearer.
NOTHING HAS CHANGED FOR THE TORIES OR THE COUNTRY.
The divisions over Europe are as deep-rooted as ever.
After a short spell of contrition, the right-wing will again start
snapping at Major's heels.
And Scotland will be treated just as harshly.
In today's Cabinet reshuffle, it's a toss-up between smooth Ian Lang
or abrasive Michael Forsyth for Scots Secretary.
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE WILL BE WHETHER THE PAIN IS A DULL ACHE OR A SHARP
STAB.
Major's hollow victory is a gift to the Labour Party.
A second ballot would have raised the spectre of Heseltine or even
ultra-right Portillo.
All Major has achieved is to head off the possibility of another
leadership challenge.
NOW BRITAIN HAS A LAME DUCK PRIME MINISTER LIMPING TOWARDS THE NEXT
GENERAL ELECTION.
The only real hope of change will come at the ballot box.

THE publicity surrounding the Tory leadership battle has failed to
pull the Conservatives out of the political doldrums in Scotland.
The latest System Three opinion poll for The Herald shows Tory support
at 11% for the second time running -- despite the fact that canvassing
was carried out just as John Major announced his resignation and
challenged his party to ''put up or shut up''.
Carried out between June 22 and June 27 over a sample of 1040
respondents in 40 constituencies, the poll had been virtually completed
by the time John Redwood announced that he was standing against Mr
Major.
Perhaps more revealing will be next month's poll, which may reflect
whether the contest has indeed united the party and hardened its
support.
The poll also followed hard on the heels of the Labour leader Tony
Blair's announcement that he was suspending all the Labour councillors
on Monklands District Council in the wake of the Black Report.
Labour's 57% rating appears to indicate that those polled approved of
his sharp and decisive action in the face of allegations of members'
corruption.
The Scottish Nationalists have fallen back to 23% after their high of
27%, won amidst the euphoria of their by-election gain of Perth and
Kinross by Roseanna Cunningham.
The Scottish Liberal Democrats remain in fourth place at 8%.
Sir Michael Hirst, chairman of the Scottish Conservative Party, said:
''I do not believe that this poll is a true reflection on Conservative
support in Scotland, because much of the fieldwork was done before the
leadership election got under way.''
However, he said the poll confirmed the SNP was capable only of
attracting short-term support.
''Even after all the hype the Nationalists generated in the Perth and
Kinross by-election, the Scottish people are still not taken in by the
empty promise of independence,'' he said.
Mr Michael Russell, the SNP's chief executive, said the poll showed
SNP support holding up above its General Election performance ''at a
time when the Tory leadership election has focused political attention
almost exclusively on Westminster''.
He added: ''As the agenda moves back to Scotland -- with the SNP
planning a vigorous campaign over the summer months -- the party's
fortunes will prosper.
''Scottish politics is clearly a two-horse race between the SNP and
Labour, with the Tories stuck at rock bottom, and the Liberal Democrats
now reduced to single figures.''
For Labour, Tommy Sheppard, assistant general secretary, said it was
''remarkable for any party to achieve a share of the vote of 57% in a
four-party political contest''.
He added: ''I think also that the swing to Labour is a feature of the
fact that people see the Tories in further disarray. It has focused
their minds on the coming General Election and what alternatives there
are to the current shower.''
Mr Sheppard described the Tories ''languishing'' at a poll rating of
11% ''similar to what John Major's shoe size must be''.
He added: ''I am sure that our action over Monklands was good for our
public profile, although I would not want to claim this was a
significant factor in this opinion poll.''
He said: ''It has meant that the affair has not had an effect on the
party's national reputation and has not damaged the standing of the
party in the eyes of the Scottish electorate -- nor should it have,
because it was a localised affair.''
Mr Andy Myles, chief executive of the Scottish Liberal Democrats said:
''As actual elections have frequently proved, opinion polls are
notorious for underestimating our real level of support.
''In spite of, or perhaps because of, unprecedented publicity, the
significant part of this poll is that the Tory Party has not made any
advance. This underlines how far they have fallen since the last General
Election.''

MICHAEL TUMELTY looks forward to a spectacular winter season from the
Royal Scottish National Orchestra, featuring works which reflect the
RSNO's own strengths.
THE Royal Scottish National Orchestra yesterday launched one of its
strongest winter seasons for some years with a huge display of
conducting muscle, a set of starry soloists, a series of collaborations,
a clutch of Scottish pieces, two visiting English orchestras, and some
programming that suggests a combination of brainpower and awareness of
what the audiences want.
The full 26-concert season in Glasgow (and shorter seasons in
Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Dundee and Perth) is spearheaded by the orchestra's
two resident star conductors, the Viennese principal conductor and music
director, Walter Weller, and, in his first full season as principal
guest conductor, the Russian, Alexander Lazarev, from the Bolshoi
Theatre.
Between them, Weller and Lazarev are taking 12 of the season's
programmes: Weller has seven, and Lazarev, who was expected to take
four, will now have five.
Lazarev's are sensational. He will provide the steel core to the
season in a set of programmes to include all three of Shostakovich's
wartime symphonies: numbers seven, The Leningrad, the enormous number
eight, and the ninth. Additionally, Lazarev will conduct Stravinsky's
Petrushka and the world premiere of a new work by Dundee composer Gordon
McPherson.
Lazarev's fifth concert is of special interest to Scottish audiences.
It had originally been planned, for next February, to have been a
concert conducted by the late Sir Alexander Gibson to celebrate his 70th
birthday. Lazarev has agreed to take the concert, and it will include
two of Sir Alex's specialisms: Elgar and Sibelius (the Second Symphony).
In the Elgar -- the Introduction and Allegro -- the orchestra will be
joined by the stunning Swedes, the Yggdrasil Quartet.
Walter Weller's own programmes, as usual, are smack in the middle of
his own specialism: the European mainstream, with performances of works
by Mozart, Schubert, Brahms, Tchaikovsky, Prokofiev, Wagner, and Mahler.
Weller will also conduct the world premiere of Ronald Stevenson's Cello
Concerto. Of particular interest will be the teaming up of Weller with
the great soprano Felicity Lott in a rare performance of Poulenc's
one-act opera, La Voix Humane.
The basic structure of the orchestra's main season in Glasgow remains
the same as last season -- whereby concerts being staged on a Thursday
are not being repeated on Saturdays. Such was the success of last
season's Thursday series, RSNO chief executive Paul Hughes said
yesterday, that the number of concerts being given on a Thursday is
being increased from six to nine.
Two guest orchestras, the Royal Philharmonic from London, and the
Royal Liverpool Phil, will be appearing in the winter season as part of
the Royal Orchestral Exchange, whereby each of Britain's three Royal
orchestras will tour to each other's cities.
Each of the English orchestras will bring its chief conductor: the
great Russian, Yuri Temirkanov, with the RPO, and Libor Pesek with the
RLPO.
Big-name soloists appearing with the RSNO next season include the
dazzling Russian, Grigory Sokolov, who took audiences by storm when,
completely unknown, he first appeared with the orchestra a few years
back, John Lill, the best of all British pianists, and the outstanding
and flamboyant French pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet.
Unusual concerts include a performance of Paul McCartney's Liverpool
Oratorio, conducted by Carl Davis, and the first performance by the
orchestra in nearly 30 years of Bach's St Matthew Passion, to be
conducted by baroque specialist Nicholas McGegan.
The orchestra will also give its own first performance of James
MacMillan's immensely successful percussion concerto, Veni, Veni,
Emmanuel, with young Edinburgh-born percussionist Colin Currie.
The hugely varied and structurally strong season will also include
three concerts by the RSNO which will form part of the broad festival of
American music, in collaboration with the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, to
be staged in Glasgow next February.

CHAMPAGNE corks were popping at Chepstow yesterday, when jockey
Richard Quinn celebrated his 1000th British victory with an all-the-way
win in the Summer Selling Stakes on the aptly-named Just Fizzy
Quinn, presented with a bottle of bubbly to mark the feat, said:
''When you start off as an apprentice it's a dream to ride one winner,
but to ride a 1000 is really unbelievable.''
Just Fizzy's sparkling success came on the Scot's first ever ride for
Martin Pipe, who said: ''I never thought I'd have to provide Mr Cole's
jockey with his 1000th winner.''
Born in Stirling 33 years ago, Thomas Richard Quinn had 19
unsuccessful rides between 1978 and 1981 for Malton trainer Herbert
Jones before successfully applying for a post with Paul Cole.
He partnered his first winner for the Lambourn stable after only two
months aboard Bolivar Baby, who won by a head at Kempton on October 21,
1981.
The jockey landed the title of champion apprentice in 1984 with 62
victories under his belt and had his first taste of classic success in
1987 aboard Zaizoom, owned by Fahd Salman, in the Italian Derby.
But the horse which put the Scotsman firmly in the limelight was
Snurge, winner of the St Leger and a number of Group 1 races all over
the world.

SCOTLAND, after the early off-green setback when both Hugh Duff and
David Miller were sent home for allegedly breaching a team curfew on
Sunday evening, managed to get things right on the green yesterday.
They beat Wales 123-97 to keep alive their hopes of recapturing the
title they last held in 1980 and now require either Ireland or Wales to
do them a good turn when they meet England -- and that prospect was
given a boost when the English only scraped home 118-105 over newcomers
Channel Islands.
It was an altogether better performance from the Scots, who led 28-24
after five ends and 61-48 at the half-way mark. They steadily pulled
away over the second half to run out 26-shot winners.
Scotland finished ahead on four of the six rinks with John Aitken
laying the victory foundations with a comprehensive 26-10 win over Dai
Wilkins. George Adrain added a 21-12 success over Trevor Mounty, Richard
Corsie beat Will Thomas 21-13, and Niall Currie edged out Robert Weale
21-13.
Wales' wins came from John Price, who beat Willie Wood 21-14, and
Spencer Wilshire, who edged out Raymond Logan 18-15.
Earlier, Scotland did well in the British championship semi-finals,
notching up wins in the pairs and fours, but they lost out in the
triples. The best performance came in the pairs, where Maybole's Malcolm
Mitchell and Graham Campbell battled to a 19-14 win over the strong
Irish duo from Portrush of Barry Moffett and Jeremy Henry.
The Scots dropped a double on the opening end, but then picked up 10
shots over the next three and were always in command from that point on.
In the fours, Drongan's Graeme Falconer, Georgie Young, Willie Caine
and George Speirs made it a double for Ayrshire when they led from the
opening end to beat David Johnston's Cliftonville rink 24-9. The Scots
counted on six of the opening seven ends to open up an 11-1 lead and
coasted to a runaway win.
In the triples, the Scottish champions from Houldsworth, Robert
Buddie, Mark McGowan and Andy McIntyre, never recovered from the loss of
an opening end 5 against Robert Wasson's Cardiff trio, who went on to
win 25-14. British championship semi-final results:
Singles: B Morley (Nottinghamshire, England) beat G McCloy (Portrush,
Ireland) 21-18. Pairs: Scotland (M Mitchell, G Campbell, Maybole) beat
Ireland (B Moffett, J Henry, Portrush) 19-14. Triples: Wales (C Dickens,
C Blake, R Wason, Cardiff) beat Scotland (R Buddie, M McGowan, A
McIntyre, Houldsworth) 25-14. Fours: Scotland (G Falconer, G Young, W
Caine, G Spiers, Drongan) beat Ireland (R Smith, R Gray, J Patterson, D
Johnston, Cliftonville) 24-9.

CAWDER'S Alan Tait marked a timely return to form in the Scottish
Assistants' Golf Championship at Newmachar yesterday with a
three-under-par 69.
With a brisk, north-westerly wind buffetting the course and frequent
showers further dampening spirits, the 26-year-old Tait shrugged aside
the after-affects of a bout of food poisoning to open up a three-stroke
lead.
Accurate iron play brought six birdies and boosted the former Scotland
Boys' champion's morale.
Banchory's Andrew Locke and perennial title challenger Steven
Thompson, of Gleddoch, could only match the demanding par of 72 for the
6623-yard parkland course.
Defending champion Scott Henderson opened with a 75 in the worst of
the weather with former champion John Wither on 74. Leading scores:
69 -- A Tait (Cawder).
72 -- A Locke (Banchory), S Thompson (Gleddoch).
73 -- M King (Pitreavie), J McReadie (Buchanan Castle), I Bratton
(Cruden Bay).
74 -- J Wither (Paisley), K Fairbairn (Goswick), P Wardell
(Longniddry) S MacPherson (Felixstowe Ferry).
75 -- S Stevenson (Turnberry Hotel), K Smillie (Grangemouth), S
Henderson (Kings Links), J Caven (Banchory) D Drysdale (Dunbar).
76 -- G Bruce (Westhill), E McIntosh (Braid Hills), N Brown
(Cardross), J Greaves (Glasgow), S Gregg (Crail), P Alexander
(Caldwell).

CREE Lodge trainer Linda Perratt and the regulars at the Globe Bar in
Ayr had something to celebrate yesterday, when Miss Pigalle (12-1) won
her first race after 26 attempts.
The four-year-old filly, who races in the colours of the Globe Bar
syndicate, gave Perratt her first winner after six seconds, and the
third of the season, when she took the Gullane Handicap Stakes over
seven furlongs by a neck from the fast-finishing At The Savoy.
Perratt wore a wide smile as she welcomed back her winner. ''I've had
so many seconds recently, I was beginnng to wonder if I would ever have
another winner,'' she said.
The filly was bred at Barskimming in Ayrshire by Heather Galbraith,
who saw her race every time apart from yesterday. ''She had to be at the
Barskimming horse trials,'' said Perratt. ''After this, we may have to
bar her from coming to the races.''
Dale Gibson brought the filly to lead inside the final furlong and
kept her head in front despite the late, fast challenge of the 4-1
favourite.
Mark Shannon reached his fastest ever half-century with a short-priced
double -- Jambo (11-10) in the opener and Sporting Fantasy (4-7) in the
seller.
Jambo, who attracted a lot of support from Hearts fans, who are known
colloquially as the Jambos, just held on to take the Braids Claiming
Stakes by a short head.
Sporting Fantasy had an easier race in the Vogrie Park Selling Stakes,
triumphing by two-and-a-half lengths over Chillibang Bang. The
two-year-old gelding, won by a Warwick University student in a newspaper
competition, was sold in the subsequent auction for 6000 guineas to
Bawtry trainer John Balding.
Soba Up, a winner over the Musselburgh track on the last two Mondays,
including the Edinburgh Gold Cup, failed in her bid to complete a
four-timer. The five-year-old filly, who won at Chester last Wednesday,
was sent off 11-10 favourite but was always struggling. North Ardar
(5-2), with the advantage of Shane Copp's 7lb claim, shot into the lead
just past the two-furlong post and kept on to beat the toiling Soba Up
by a length.
* AFTER the completion of 13 of the 21 meetings scheduled for summer
jump racing, the experiment has already met with a favourable response
throughout the industry.
With trainers supplying plenty of runners, and clerks of the six
courses chosen for the test providing well watered ground without any
jar, the trial is proving successful.
Uttoxeter clerk of the course David McAllister said: ''They have got
it right in the way they haven't tried to put on too many fixtures.
Twenty-one in seven weeks, three a week, is about the right percentage
and I would hate for them to increase that.''
The reaction in the weighing room has also been favourable, according
to jockey Carl Llewellyn. ''Some of the lads are pleased that they can
earn a few extra bob,'' he said.
''But one or two would be glad of a week or two's rest and I know a
couple have taken time off this week and won't return until next week's
meeting at Worcester.''

Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club Trophy at Sandown after trainer Mary Reveley
announced the gelding an intended runner. Last month's Royal Hunt Cup
fourth was the early market leader for the #80,000 10-furlong handicap,
only to be removed from most lists when he was also entered for a
one-mile event at Sandown on Saturday.
Mrs Reveley said: ''It was a dificult decision and I'm not convinced
he will stay the longer trip. But the other contest was not easy and he
might well stay.''

Ross Finlay finds that the Daihatsu MPV comes up to size.
SECOND of the new wave of multi-purpose vehicles to go on sale this
summer is the smallest, lightest and least expensive of them all.
Daihatsu has been selling its Italian-built Hijet microvan here for some
time, and the same vehicle has also been available on the Continent as
an MPV conversion. Now it is in the showrooms here, as a classic example
of ''niche'' marketing.
The Hijet is the only vehicle in Daihatsu's range to be manufactured
in Europe, so that it avoids the whole business of quota restrictions as
employed against Japanese products. Daihatsu has a joint-venture factory
in Tuscany run in conjunction with Piaggio, and their technical
co-operation includes such details as ventilated front disc brakes,
unusual features in vehicles of this tiny size, whether intended as load
carriers or as people carriers.
While it is a mystery to most industry observers where the buyers for
nearly a dozen different makes of MPV are going to materialise from, the
Daihatsu is the only one which can be confidently stated to have no
direct rivals. It is far, far smaller than any of the others, and it
comes at a bargain-basement price of #7995, little more than half the
cost of the next one up the scale.
It is not a sophisticated car-like vehicle rivalling the best efforts
in MPV design. What we have here is a microvan, admittedly quite
craftily converted to passenger-carrying use, with commercial-vehicle
suspension which has it bouncing along over any but the most smoothly
surfaced roads.
Other van-type features are the twin sliding doors -- one on each side
-- providing access to the second and third rows of seats, the
forward-control layout, and an unexpectedly high build. The fact that
the Hijet stands more than six feet tall from tyre tread to the topmost
level of the roof gives it excellent headroom inside.
Driver and front seat passenger sit right up forward. The middle pair
of seats have restricted footroom since the engine compartment, under
the front seats, gets in the way. The third row offers far better
footroom, although one passenger would have liked a better step-up
arrangement to reach it more elegantly.
A surprising feature is that Daihatsu has managed to fit not one but
two sunroofs. There are tilt-open glass roofs above the front and middle
rows of seats, fortunately with pull-across blinds for days when there
is just too much sunshine beating down.
Luggage space is a problem in all MPVs, of whatever overall size. With
all six seats up, there is room at the back of the Hijet for a couple of
smallish cases and/or squashy bags, and some extra storage space under
the rearmost seats. Folding these forward obviously releases more floor
space for luggage, but it is then, of course, in full view of anybody
walking past.
Out on the road the Hijet is a much livelier little machine than a
first glance at it suggests. The three-cylinder 993cc engine may push
out only 47bhp, but it revs well, is nicely responsive, and works in
conjunction with a quick-acting knitting needle-like gear lever.
Manoeuvrability of course, is first class. I found that the remarkable
24ft turning circle let me finagle my way out of a car park which I
thought had its exit comprehensively blocked.
Out on the open road, 60mph is a comfortable cruising speed. Noise
levels are fair, considering that this is a commercial vehicle
conversion, but you simply cannot, because of the van back axle design,
expect anything resembling a boulevard ride.
In comparison with full-size MPVs the little Daihatsu may seem a
quaint Japanese-Italian joke, and I would not like to cannon it off a
double-decker bus. But I think that at the price there is a place for it
as a family runabout, ideal for jobs like school runs and transporting
five-a-side football teams.

AGRICULTURE has taken over from the construction industry as the most
dangerous industry in the United Kingdom, Frank Davies, chairman of the
Health and Safety Commission said yesterday.
Presenting the Health and Safety Executive annual report on fatal
injuries in farming he warned that the incidence rate was now at its
highest level for eight years.
There were 54 fatalities last year -- eight of them in Scotland. The
total represented a 32% increase on the previous 12 months.
Out of the national total nearly two-thirds were self-employed
farmers.
While admitting that the figures represented a bad year, the HSE did
not accept that there was a direct co-relation between the number of
deaths and the number of safty inspectors. The current size of the
inspectorate is 90, compared to 140 five years ago.
Thirteen of those who died last year were more than 65 years of age
and Mr Davies suggested that farmers and growers who worked beyond the
normal retiral age should remember that they may not be as agile as once
they were and their reaction times would have slowed down.
''These factors can lead to tragedy,'' he said.
Frank Lindsay, HM chief agricultural inspector, pinpointed
self-employed status as a significant factor in many accidents.
Self-employment in agriculture was very tough work, he said. ''You have
to be a jack of all trades and work very hard in very difficult
conditions. You end up doing the sorts of jobs no-one else wants to
do.''
In the main, he said, the causes of most of the fatal accidents were
predictable and preventable. ''We need a change of culture. Far too many
people in the industry regard ill-health and injury or death as part of
the way they go about earning their living.''
Safety inspectors, he said, were trying very hard to turn things
round. They were working with manufacturers and importers to make
machinery safe to clean and maintain. ''We want machinery to be almost
foolproof, so that you cannot leave guards off and run machines with
parts exposed.''
Brian Collman of the National Farmers' Union health and safety
committee, suggested that the decline in the number of people employed
in the industry could be a factor, as those remaining were placed under
greater pressure, possibly working longer hours.
He hoped to see the evolution of a culture in which farmers would want
to invite the HSE on to their farms to advise on safety aspects.

<HEADLINE>More support required for organic farmers</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

ORGANIC farming will, in time, become the predominant form of
agricultural practice in Britain, Patrick Holden, policy director of the
Soil Association, claimed at the Royal Show.
Despite public support for organic methods the Government still poured
vast amounts of taxpayers' money into the ''negative and hugely
unpopular policy of set-aside and accompanying arable area payments''.
Annual support for organic farming was a mere #1.5m out of a total
agricultural budget of #2800m, he said.
Last year, he claimed, the Ministry of Agriculture had launched its
aid scheme for organic farming, aimed at achieving a threefold expansion
of organic land. In the first year an increase of only 9% had been
recorded.
The problem, he said, was the way in which financial aid to farmers
was allocated. A 500-hectare arable farm could expect support of about
#100,000 under the present system of payments. Conversion to organic
farming could halve that figure because many of the crops would be
ineligible.
''That difference has to be made up by premium prices and farmers do
not have the confidence to give up those cheques,'' he said. The
Ministry would require to transfer more funds to support organic
farming.
''There are votes in organic food and farming issues and the farming
industry and the Government should become aware of that.''
Mr Holden said that he could detect, within the ministry, a move away
from the present payments system towards the principle of making
payments to farmers in return for tangible environmental and welfare
benefits.

LAURA Moffat, of West Kilbride, carded the best two rounds over
Paisley yesterday to head the qualifiers for the match-play section of
the Scottish Girls' championship.
Beaten in the final by Lesley Nicholson last year, the 15-year-old
notched up rounds of 75 and 72 for a one-under-par aggregate of 147,
following on from her fine form on Monday which earned her victory at
the Golf Foundation Wheetabix championship at East Kilbride.
The West Kilbride senior club champion finished three shots clear of
Shonagh McEwan, of Gifford, and four ahead of plus-one handicapper
Heather Stirling, of Bridge of Allan, and Deeside's Claire Hunter.
Leading qualifers:
147 -- L Moffat (West Kilbride). 150 -- S McEwan (Gifford). 151 -- H
Stirling (Bridge of Allan), C Hunter (Deeside). 155 -- F Prior (Cawder).
156 -- F Lockhart (Balbirnie Park).
* IN testing sunny and breezy conditions, Clare Hargan emerged as the
first-round leader in the Women's Highland Amateur Open with a
three-over-par 75. Leading scores:
75 -- C Hargan (Cardross). 77 -- J Taylor (Alloa). 79 -- F Farquharson

STEFFI Graf was not just pleased with her second-set performance
against Mary Joe Fernandez yesterday, the German actually claimed that
she was unbeatable after having set up a Wimbledon semi-final meeting
with Jana Novotna.
Graf, champion five times in the last seven years, proved too powerful
for the American, who had made a realistic first-set challenge.
''I don't think I can be beaten if I carry on playing the way I did in
the second set,'' said Graf. Doubts persist about her fitness after
wrist and back worries but she did her best to dispel these concerns by
beating Fernandez 6-3, 6-0 for her thirtieth straight win. ''I don't
think it's possible for me to play better than I did in the second
set,'' added Graf. ''It's been years since I reached that level at
Wimbledon. I felt in touch during the knock-up and went for everything.
''I get a buzz from playing like that. I was enjoying it so much I
wanted to keep smiling all the time. I wanted to stay out there
longer.''
Injuries hampered Graf's Wimbledon preparation. But she has been so
commanding she has yet to drop a set and has conceded only five games in
her last three matches.
''I didn't have the best preparation and I felt there would be more
resistance coming,'' she admitted. Now Graf is already looking ahead to
the return of greatest rival Monica Seles, who is scheduled for an
exhibition comeback against Martina Navratilova later this month.
''Perhaps I need the challenge of Monica coming back,'' she said. ''It
would be good for the game.''
Fernandez made the No.1 seed struggle to clinch the first set on her
sixth set point in 42 minutes. But the second set was over in half that
time as the champion's fierce forehand frequently left Fernandez
flat-footed.
Novotna also had a comfortable passage, beating Japan's Kimiko Date
6-2, 6-3 to line up a reminder of her greatest disappointment.
The Czech lost the 1993 final against Graf despite leading 4-1 in the
third set. ''Nobody expected me to do well here after my bad clay court
season,'' said Novotna. ''Its a surprise to everybody. I didn't come
into the tournament with any great expectation. I didn't expect anything
from myself.''
The key to Novotna's victory was her steady baseline game and an
absence of errors when she attacked the net.

<HEADLINE>Alan Wiseman calls for new advertising thrust</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A CALL for a national advertising campaign to extol the nutritional
value of milk has been called for by Alan Wiseman, chairman of
East-Kilbride-based Robert Wiseman Dairies.
Speaking at the Royal Show at Stoneleigh, Mr Wiseman said there was a
message to be got over to new mothers every year about calcium, protein
and vitamins. If mothers were not reminded of the value of milk as a
source of these elements they tended to forget.
''With all the upheaval following the de-regulation of the milk
industry there had been a gap in the advertising thrust for milk. I
believe the industry does miss the National Dairy Council influence,''
said Mr Wiseman.
Throughout the UK, he suggested, there was a need for expenditure of
about #6m. It could be funded by a combination of the Milk Development
Council, companies like his own, Scottish Milk and Milk Marque.
''I believe the industry needs to get its act together and create a
foundation to build on,'' he said. ''I was a critic of the National
Dairy Council because I thought they were pouring millions of pounds of
producers' and processors' money down the drain by trying to support the
unsupportable.
''These days when milk will keep for 14 days is there really a need to
have it delivered in glass bottles on the doorstep?''
The need for dairy farmers to form strong co-operatives to counter the
buying power of the supermarkets and the major processors was emphasised
by Andrew Dare, chief executive of Milk Marque.
''A strong co-operative can re-sell to more than 300 buyers, as we do
at Milk Marque,'' he said. ''We sell to almost every buyer of milk and
that is a source of strength.''

THE HarperCollins stationery and diary division in Bishopbriggs is to
be bought by Debden UK, a subsidiary of Singapore-based diary
manufacturers Nippecraft, it was announced yesterday.
The takeover, for an undisclosed sum, offers hope for the future of
the division's 35 sales, production and administration staff, 14 of whom
were to be made redundant under HarperCollins cutbacks announced last
Friday.
Debden UK managing director John McAlpine, who is a former head of
HarperCollins Glasgow, said: ''Debden UK has acquired a leading company,
several well-known brands and the associated editorial, publishing and
sales expertise which lies behind its success.
''We will be offering positions to the majority of the 35 staff and we
will be remaining at Westerhill certainly in the short term.''
Debden UK was unable to disclose exactly how many staff would be
retained, or the details of the relocation plans, since the takeover
contract was not due to be finalised until the middle of the month.
However, a spokesman said: ''As far as Debden is concerned, what we
are actually buying is the expertise of the existing staff and as far as
possible they will be retained somewhere in the Glasgow area.''
The takeover will not include HarperCollins' diary manufacturing
operations at Westerhill although the plant will continue its connection
with diaries.
Mr McAlpine said: ''We cannot guarantee any long-term stationery and
diary manufacturing in Glasgow, but distribution is expected to continue
at HarperCollins' Westerhill site.
Eddie Bell, HarperCollins' executive chairman, said of the takeover:
''John McAlpine's approach came at a time when we had taken the decision
to concentrate our efforts more on our core business of book
publishing.''
HarperCollins contacted over 40 companies in February about a possible
takeover of the Westerhill plant which lost #3m last year.

CELTIC and Scotland midfield star John Collins returns from holiday
tomorrow for talks with Parkhead manager Tommy Burns -- and he may find
that his immediate future remains with the Glasgow club.
After the Scottish Cup Final victory in May, Collins claimed in a
newspaper article that he had possibly played his last game for Celtic,
and that he would move to another club in the new season. Since then,
there has been almost constant speculation about his future.
Newly promoted Middlesbrough were first to throw their hat into the
ring with a #2m offer which was rejected by manager Tommy Burns. Since
then they have increased that bid but, always, it seemed under threat
from an unnamed London club who were reported ready to match them.
Now, that has happened. Queens Park Rangers and their manager Ray
Wilkins, the former Rangers player, have placed an offer which is, I
understand, #2.2m, the same as the one from Ayresome Park. The view of
the two Premiership clubs is that they do not wish to become involved in
any auction for the Scotland player, who cost Celtic #1m from Hibs five
years ago.
Collins went to Celtic claiming then that he wanted to win honours --
but the Scottish Cup medal he collected at the end of May is the
solitary prize he can boast.
Recent reports have suggested that Collins was disinclined to move
from Celtic, but, equally, there were suggestions from the south that
the player was ready for a transfer.
Burns has been consistent throughout. He has always maintained that
every player has his price, and that if clubs coveted the skills of
Collins, then they would have to pay the going rate for them.
I believe he will stand by that and the twin bids, from Middlesbrough
and Queens Park Rangers could be rejected. Only an offer of #2.5m would
be enough to prise Collins away from Celtic.
More especially as the Glasgow club's transfer efforts continue to
falter abroad as one player after another decides to go elsewhere.

FRENCHMAN David Ginola, whose delaying tactics finally forced Celtic
into withdrawing from the race for his signature, will be intoduced to
the Newcastle fans today as their new #2.5m star.
Paris St Germain forward Ginola arrived on Tyneside for a medical
yesterday as manager Kevin Keegan prepared to take his summer transfer
outlay to #12.5m.
He set up the deal before flying to Florida on holiday, leaving his
assistant Terry McDermott, chief executive Freddie Fletcher, and
vice-chairman Freddie Shepherd to complete the deal. United, who have
already spent a total of #10m on England internationals Les Ferdinand
and Warren Barton, may put in an increased bid of #2m for Reading keeper
Shaka Hislop.
Celtic, however, will not let the latest set-back deter them from
seeking fresh faces for the start of the season.
''We have one or two things on the go at the moment,'' said manager
Burns yesterday, ''and we still are confident we can get new players.''
Peter van Vossen of Ajax, Dimitri Radchenko of Santander and now
Ginola have opted for other clubs, but the man who was Celtic's first
transfer target, Marc Degryse, has not yet moved from Anderlecht where
he gets a huge salary. If the Parkhead club up the ante, it is even
possible that deal could be resurrected.

THE Scottish Rugby Union yesterday came out strongly against the idea
that only the top three finishers from the 1995 World Cup together with
the host country Wales would qualify automatically for the next event in
four years' time.
Yesterday at Murrayfield, Bill Hogg, the chief executive of the SRU
said: ''I have written to the International Board expressing our concern
about the extra pressures that would be put on players. Other unions are
equally concerned.
''A decision will have to be taken by the 20-member council of the
International Board at its September meeting in Tokyo.''
The general feeling seems to be that those who reached the last eight
in South Africa should qualify. England finished fourth after their
defeat by France, but still have to qualify.
Before then, Scotland will have appointed a successor to Duncan
Paterson as the national team manager.
The likely contenders for the position are Arthur Hastie, who managed
the Scotland development tour to Zimbabwe this summer, and Allan Hosie,
who is one of Scotland's representatives on the International Board and
who managed the Scotland tour to the South Sea Islands in 1993.
There is also the possibility that Jim Telfer, the director of rugby,
could come into the reckoning, allowing Scotland to integrate the
management and coaching functions.
Paterson's skills will be put to other uses within the SRU. The former
Scotland scrum half will become the convener of coaching and youth
development, while his first lieutenant, Doug Morgan, who announced his
retirement as Scotland coach, will become the chairman of the coaching
advisory panel -- the so-called think-tank that has been responsible for
a number of recent innovations.
Further evidence that the SRU is moving in a more professional
direction is the co-option of Ewan Brown, a professor of accountancy at
Edinburgh University, to set up careers counselling for the players'
advisory service.
The SRU also announced that Donald McLeod will become medical
convener, Ian Laughland the finance convener, Harvey Wright to head
ticket allocation, Andy Little to be the championship convener, and
Charlie Bissett to oversee sponsorship and marketing.
However Hogg refuted suggestions that these were professional
positions. ''The conveners are not being paid,'' he said.
Hogg also announced that Charlie Bissett will manage the Scotland team
at the Student World Cup next year in South Africa. The coaches will be
Graham Hogg and Ian Barnes.
Because of the Student World Cup, there will be no development tour
next season but Scotland will make a full tour of New Zealand which is
scheduled to consist of eight matches, two of them tests.
The draw for the new Tennents Scottish Cup preliminary round will be
made on July 31. The clubs in the first stage are Moray, Lasswade,
Edinburgh Northern, Hyndland, Waid FP, Panmure, Rosyth, RAF Lossiemouth,
Dalkeith, Hamilton Academicals, RAF Kinloss, and Broughton.
The six winners will join the remaining 58 clubs from the national
leagues to form the first round proper.
Yesterday BBC Scotland confirmed that they would be covering the cup
competition from the early stages to the final on May 11, which will be
broadcast live from Murrayfield.
Meanwhile, Scottish clubs are to share a near #500,000 windfall next
season following the SRU's decision to top up the Tennents League and
Cup sponsorship money.
Bill Hogg said that ''#260,750 will be paid out for leagues compared
to #106,355 last season.'' Clubs also will receive five per cent of
receipts from international match ticket sales to club members.

CHARLIE Green, the unquenchable competitor that he is, yesterday moved
purposefully, if sometimes fortuitously, towards gaining his eighth
victory in seniors golf.
With an extraordinary inward half of 32 for a score of 68 Green took a
three-stroke lead after the first round of the Famous Grouse Scottish
Senior Open Amateur championship.
On an afternoon of glorious sunshine, but with a frisky south-west
breeze to bolster the defences of the Glasgow club's 5968-yard course at
Killermont, Green eliminated the putting stroke altogether to make the
three birdies he had on his card, so that he became the only one of the
153 competitors to better the par of 70.
Green, typically self-critical, was as annoyed at the several chances
which escaped him as he was almost apologetic about the way in which he
did make his gains. At the tenth he made 3 by chipping in from 15 yards,
and after he had holed from 18 feet to save par at the short eleventh,
he pitched in at the next from 35 yards.
His approach to the last green downwind ran just through the back and
from some 15 feet he chipped in again. This performance by Green, still
scratch at the age of 62, fairly took the breath away from his
20-year-old caddie, Steven Carmichael, the British Youth
internationalist and last year's British Universities' champion.
Indeed Green, who won this title in 1991 and has taken six of the last
seven British Senior championships, looked back with some annoyance at
his failings. He reflected particularly on having made only par at the
525-yard fifth, where the length of his drive left him only a No.7-iron
approach, which he bunkered, and his par 4 at the fourteenth where,
having recovered from a fairway bunker to four feet, he missed the
birdie putt.
All this after his two partners, the illustriously-named Sandy Herd
and Bobby Watson, the father of Craig, the Scottish internationalist,
had played each other's ball at the very first hole. The resultant
penalty of two strokes inflated their final scores to 78 and 76
respectively.
Bobbing in Green's wake most closely was Ian Hornsby, a five-handicap
golfer from Ponteland. Although Hornsby stumbled with a double-bogey 6
at the seventh and turned in 37, he finished strongly, covering the last
five holes in two under par to be home in 34 with birdies at the
fourteenth and the last.
Allan Tune, a 64-year-old four-handicapper from Stockport and a
left-hander who putts right-handed although he retains his normal grip,
kept out of serious trouble and avoided three-putting to share third
place on 72 with Bathgate's John McLean who, perhaps significantly, won
the event in 1993 at Killermont. Leading scores:
68 -- C W Green (Dumbarton).
71 -- I Hornsby (Ponteland).
72 -- A Tune (Stockport), J McLean (Bathgate).
73 -- P Bachelor (Woburn), A Mayer (Torwoodlee), S Greenwood (St
Andrews), I Wilson (Craigie Hill).
74 -- R Sutherland (Douglas Park), M Lygate (Troon Portland), D Bisset
(Aberdour).
75 -- A Pike (Leasowe), J Gibb (Silkstone), G Lindeblad (Sweden), J
Douglas (Kirkhill), N Bain (Royal Troon), T Dewar (Western Gailes), C
Grier (Eastwood), G Murray (Fereneze).
76 -- J Walkinshaw (Denham), K Young (Keighley), G Everett (Crow
Wood), J Montgomerie (Cathcart Castle), R Robertson (Osbourne Downs), G
Jenkinson (Whinhill), D Lawrie (St Andrews New), L Woodworth (USA), R
Watson (East Renfrewshire), C Weir (Milngavie), J Turnbull (Dullatur), B
Gogan (Western Gailes).
77 -- R McCallum (Milngavie), J Duffy (Cawder), A Cobban (Kintore), L
Wilkie (West Kilbride), I R Harris (Royal Troon), J Morris (Shotts).

CONCHITA Martinez and Spanish rival Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario are on
collision course for their first Wimbledon clash, with a place in the
women's final and an overflow of national pride at stake.
The champion beat off the brave challenge of Gabriela Sabatini
yesterday to set up the showdown with Sanchez-Vicario, who mastered the
big serve of Holland's Brenda Schultz-McCarthy to go further than before
in this her ninth Wimbledon.
But there will be no old pals' reunion on Centre Court when the
Spaniards clash. Arantxa, who reached her first Wimbledon semi-final by
beating Schultz-McCarthy 6-4, 7-6, said: ''Conchita has her friends and
I have mine. So we are not close.
''But I won't be thinking about who it is on the other side of the
net. The good thing is that there must now be one Spanish player in the
final, but nobody is thinking about the country of the opponent when
they are out there. It is just another player you have to beat.
''We know each other's game well and so it is sure to be a tough
match, but I'm happy with my condition and the fact that I've already
had my best Wimbledon. My goal was to get past the quarter-finals and
now that I've done that we'll just wait and see what else comes.''
Martinez trails Sanchez -- who is a year older at 24 -- by 6-3 in
head-to-head clashes. But most of those have been on Arantxa's favourite
surface, clay, although the most recent meeting produced a Martinez
straight-sets victory in the final of the Italian Open in May.
And although the champion tries hard to maintain a mask of calm, she
has let it slip this week just how fiercely proud she is of her status
-- a new hard-edge to the attitude instilled in her by her new Brazilian
coach Carlos Kirmayr.
Conchita may be one of the most low-key Wimbledon title-holders for
years but she said after having beaten Sabatini 7-5, 7-6: ''I'm sure
some things can upset me but people should know I won't let my title go
just like that.''
Most pundits believe Steffi Graf has only to turn up to wrench the
championship away for a sixth time, but Martinez said: ''Nobody will
take it away from me without a fight.''
For a while, Sabatini looked likely to do just that, leading 4-1 in
the first set before Martinez finally found her form -- and forced some
of the old familiar Gabriela uncertainty.
The champion reeled off four games in a row to take the first set and
then strode away to 5-1 in the second before ''nearly-girl'' Sabatini
rediscovered her pride to force a tie-break.
It was just not enough, though, as Argentina's 1991 finalist fell to
Conchita's flashing back-hand and her own poor serve.
That makes it three quarter-final and three semi-final defeats for
Sabatini, who after having struggled inconsistently through the early
stages, thought this might be her year at last.
Martinez paid her credit, saying: ''She played very well and I took a
long while to start. Then at 5-1 up in the second set, she suddenly
started attacking me a lot more. I had to make sure I really stayed
aggressive.''

* GHK have appointed 36-year-old Andy Little as their first full-time
director of coaching.
Club official David Jerdan said the move had been made possible by an
anonymous five-figure sponsorship for each of the next two years.
West of Scotland, meanwhile, have brought back former scrum half Sandy
Service as assistant coach in a reshuffle which sees his old team-mate,
Colin Mair, become squad manager.
All Black Gordon Macpherson steps up to be chief coach, with Service
taking responsibility for the backs. However, he has been dealt a triple
blow with the news that Mark and Richard Craig have switched allegiance
to Hawick, taking with them younger brother James, the outstanding
Scottish Schools winger.

PANCHO Gonzales, one of the greatest and most colourful players in
tennis history, has died of cancer in Las Vegas aged 67.
''We had a terrific report from doctors three weeks ago,'' said his
brother, Ralph. ''But a week ago he became sick and deteriorated very
quickly. At the end, he didn't suffer much.''
Born in Los Angeles, Gonzales won the US national singles title in
1948 and 1949. He won eight professional singles times from 1953 to 1961
and won doubles titles at both Wimbledon and the French Open in 1949.
In 1969, Gonzales won the longest singles match in Wimbledon history,
beating Charlie Pasarell in 112 games -- 22-24, 1-6, 16-14, 6-3, 11-9.
The match, suspended because of darkness, took five hours 12 minutes and
lasted two days.
The first two sets were played in gathering gloom and Gonzales, who
complained that he could not see, wanted the referee, Captain Mike
Gibson, to stop the match at the end of the 46-game opening set.
Gibson insisted that the match continue and a morose Gonzales, who was
booed by the crowd, virtually threw the second set, at which point
darkness stopped play.
The following day, a refreshed Gonzales fought back to win a marathon
-- there were no chairs on court in those days -- in a year when he was
already 41.
1 ''I was in tears after I lost the match,'' said Pasarell, who was 24
at the time. ''I walked into the locker room and went into a corner. He
came over, sat down next to me, patted me on the back, threw a towel
over my head and said, 'I'm sorry.'
''He had probably the best serve of all time, but his greatest asset
was that he would never give up. Somehow he would figure out how to win
a match.
Gonzales was known for his temper and competitive nature, but also for
his sportsmanship and dignified bearing.
He staged another classic comeback to win his 1949 US singles title,
beating top-seeded Ted Schroeder 16-18, 2-6, 6-1, 6-2, 6-4.
''My approach was to create a weakness and attack,'' said Gonzales. He
beat South African Eric Sturgess to win the 1948 US title.
Gonzales was divorced from Andre Agassi's older sister Rita, but the
Agassi family remained very close to him. He was an early influence on
Agassi's career.

ROY Evans staked his claim for Premiership high office yesterday, with
designs on succeeding Blackburn's Kenny Dalglish as the top manager in
England.
The Liverpool leader believes he has good cause for optimism after
having completed the signing of Stan Collymore from Nottingham Forest
for a British record fee of #8.5m.
Collymore is looking forward to picking up medals, as well as a cheque
for #425,000. He believes he is entitled to five per cent of the fee
from Forest, maintaining he never asked manager Frank Clark -- currently
on holiday -- for a move. ''I hope the situation will be resolved sooner
rather than later,'' he said.
''The fee is inconsequential as far as I am concerned. I know I will
be criticised in certain sections of the media if I have a bad game, but
I have never lost faith in my ability.''
Collymore has had a remarkable journey from non-league Stafford -- and
stacking supermarket shelves -- to the football history books.
Evans said: ''It is a monster fee but I believe it is money well
spent. Stan has no control over it, and we want him to enjoy his
football.''
Collymore weighed in with 50 goals -- 25 each season -- during his
time on the Trent, and Evans will be looking for him to help to ignite
Liverpool's championship bid and their progress in the UEFA Cup.

WHEN Hamilton Accies manager Iain Munro returns from holiday, it will
be back to work at the sharp end to face what could be a crisis which --
technically speaking -- means the majority of his squad being free to
walk out.
Hamilton currently have 16 players out of contract, although
realistically, some may find difficulty attracting other clubs, which
would seem to lead to a settlement of sorts, even short-term.
One very marketable player, however, is English hot-shot Peter
Duffield, who is attracting interest from clubs south of the Border.
Hamilton value the player at around #300,000, more than 10 times the
#25,000 they paid Sheffield United for his services in August '93.
Duffield hit 24 goals last season, taking his tally to 43 in 79
appearances for Accies.
Meanwhile, St Mirren last night signed freed Partick Thistle full back
Bobby Law. Manager Jimmy Bone swooped for the 30-year-old player and
predicted a good season ahead for the Paisley club.
He said: ''Bobby has the ability to be a really good signing for this
club. He can play at right back, left back, or even in the midfield
which is just the type of versatility we are looking for.''
Law, who joined Partick Thistle in 1984, was delighted with the switch
of clubs and claimed: ''St Mirren are as big a club as Thistle.''

TIM Law in the Cowes boat Katemba won twice yesterday to lead the
Etchells UK National and Open Championships being contested off Gourock.
Law, past national title holder and current southern area champion was
yesterday riding high on the confidence gained from Monday's fourth
place in the opening race.
Crewed by Steve Girling and Australian sailmaker Bruce Anson, he
picked off Poul Richard Hoj Jensen on the final beat after repeatedly
reading the shifting eight knot north westerly breeze better.
Double gold medallist Jensen's electric starting on Danish Blue was
the key to his substantial lead for the first two rounds of the Olympic
triangle. Danish Blue had a 20-yard lead within the first five minutes
of yesterday's first race before Katemba '''dug in'' for victory.
A second conservative start from the Katemba team in the afternoon's
windward-leeward race kept them clear of trouble unlike the seven boats
disqualified for starting line infringements -- among them Adam
Gosling's Yes!, Results: 1
Race Two -- 1, Katemba (T Law) Cowes; 2, Danish Blue (P R Hoj Jensen)
Burnham; 3, Yes! (A Gosling) Cowes; 4, Playback (K Lawrence) Gourock.
Race Three -- 1, Katemba; 2, Playback; 3, Jessica; 4, GBR 125 (P
O'Neill) Cowes; 4, Fiona IV (N Geaves) Burnham.
Overall after three races -- 1, Katemba 5.5 points; 2, Playback 8; 3,
Danish Blue 13; 4, Jessica 27; 5, Fiona IV 32.

* TODD Woodbridge and Pat Rafter were involved in a dressing room
dust-up after a doubles match in which Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde
beat Rafter and Mark Philippousis.
Feeling was stirred up by the vocal support given Rafter by his
girlfriend Alexandra, and Woodbridge confronted her after the match to
say she had taken her backing too far.
When the players reached the changing room, Rafter turned on
Woodbridge and a slanging match took place. Wimbledon officials are
unlikely to take action because the row was in private.

TOP seed Andre Agassi, having lost only one set in four matches,
believes he is playing well enough to triumph at Wimbledon again. And
Agassi's great rival, reigning champion Pete Sampras, is no less
confident.
Both appear to have easy quarter-final matches against unseeded
players. Agassi meets the aggressive Dutchman Jacco Eltingh, who as the
world's No.1 doubles player, is no slouch at the net. ''I know Jacco
will come in at every opportunity and try and crowd me so I know my
strategy must be to keep the ball deep,'' said Agassi.
Agassi, the champion in 1992, is through to his fourth Wimbledon
quarter-final, while Eltingh has not ventured into this territory
before. Though the Dutchman is a confident character, it is hard to
believe that he can win against a man who has won 22 of his last 23
Grand Slam matches.
Sampras, going for his third successive title, faces Shuzo Matsuoka,
the first Japanese player to reach this stage since Jiri Satoh in 1933.
Matsuoka, who did a lap of honour after beating American Michael Joyce
in the fourth round on Monday, has a big first serve and good second
delivery, but can he worry Sampras?
He did beat the American once but that was in 1991 while Sampras has
beaten him three times running, including a victory on grass in the
Stella Artois tournament last year.
Three times champion Boris Becker, like Sampras, is a strong favourite
to beat Frenchman Cedric Pioline. They have met three times and the
German has won them all.
The most unpredictable quarter-final is the clash between big-serving
Goran Ivanisevic, runner-up in 1992 and 1994, who plays Yevgeny
Kafelnikov.
The Russian is still only 21 but learning fast. He has come from 314th
in the world in 1992 to No.7 and he believes he is destined to make the
final.

WORLD Cup captain Francois Pienaar and two other Springboks, Hennie le
Roux and Gavin Johnson, last night failed to defuse a row within the
country's leading province, Transvaal, after meeting South African rugby
supremo Louis Luyt.
The players were believed to be demanding a bigger share of the
multi-million pound windfall from a broadcast deal with media magnate
Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation.
Pienaar and 10 other World Cup players boycotted a Transvaal practice
yesterday in protest at the provincial management's failure to resolve
unspecified grievances.
The players refused to comment after the meeting but Luyt, president
of both the Transvaal and national unions, said the issue was not
primarily about money and added that further talks would be held early
today.
One unnamed player was quoted in a Johannesburg paper as saying:
''Officials were aware of what we wanted before the World Cup, but we
were told to wait until it was over. Now we are saying what we would
like to happen.''

THE man who scored two goals for Partick Thistle in their Intertoto
Cup-tie against Keflavik last week, Tom Smith, will be in the squad that
leaves for France on Friday for the third game in the group, against
Metz. Although Smith is out of contract, he will sign a monthly
agreement to make sure he can play.
Smith would have been ineligible if he failed to sign a contract, but
manager John Lambie said yesterday there would be no problem. The same
cannot be said for the man Smith replaced, Ian Cameron, who has stuck by
his decision not to play again until his future is decided.
Lambie, who has not heard from Cameron, names 16 for France, with
Tommy Turner and Smith coming in, replacing two of the squad which drew
in Austria with Linzer ASK 10 days ago -- Cameron, and Rod McDonald, who
has an ankle injury and has been told to rest.
The news at the weekend that Linzer drew with Zagreb, leaving Thistle
top of the group, pleased and surprised the manager, who anticipated the
Yugoslav side being better than the others in his group.
Lambie and vice-chairman Brown McMaster will travel tomorrow, a day
ahead of the others, taking the team kit with them to avoid the
experience of Austria where their hampers and bags were left at London,
and did not arrive until late at night.

Exactly 21 years to the day since Beckenbauer led the Germans to a 2-1

Former Dutch captain Johan Cruyff is unable to play due to commitments

ALEX Ferguson, the Manchester United manager, has put the record
straight as regards the transfer of Paul Ince to Inter-Milan.
Ferguson has come under fire for allowing Ince to move to the Italian
side in an #8m deal. However, Ferguson has defended his decision to let
Ince go, in fact claiming that the player planned his more to Serie A.
''Before the end of the season, someone representing Ince was phoning
Milan and telling them he was desperate to join them,'' said the
manager. ''We were well aware of that and we must assume that Paul knew
about it. I would have to say that it annoyed and worried me.''
Ferguson also alleges that Ince told members of United's staff that
the FA Cup final defeat by Everton would be his last appearance in a red
shirt.
''It was a shock when Paul said he wanted to go and then Inter phoned
and asked about him,'' said the manager. ''In the end, we told Milan
that we wanted #8m and when they offered that we decided to let Paul
speak to them.
''I honestly felt he would stay. I phoned him three times and I
couldn't believe it when Paul told me he was leaving.''
* LIVERPOOL have completed the signing of Stan Collymore from
Nottingham Forest for a British record fee of #8.5m.

VICTORIA Park hurdler Ross Baillie is a surprise omission from the
first batch of names in the British team for the European Junior
Athletics Championships in Hungary later this month. Yet the 17-year-old
Scot is the only qualifier in his event.
Now he will have to prove himself all over again at the AAA
Championships in Birmingham next week.
The Clydebank High pupil was pipped by English rival Damian Greaves in
a controversial finish to the 110m event in the AAA Junior championships
at Bedford.
The photo-finish failed to work and the judges took 30 minutes to give
Greaves the verdict, with Baillie awarded the same time of 14.4sec. But
with no electronic timing and the following wind too strong, this did
not give Greaves the qualifying standard.
Baillie had already run 14.60 in his heat to beat the qualifying time
for the second time this season. His best is 14.56.
He had hoped to join two Scots who have made the pool, Des Roach
(Clydesdale Harriers), in the 1500m, and Alasdair Donaldson (Babcock
Pitreavie), in the 800m.

FOR much of the sixties, the Scottish rugby team's second row
contained the formidable figure of one Frans ten Bos of Oxford
University and London Scottish. Towards the end of his career, he was
having a difficult afternoon in an international trial when the
terracing loud-mouth gave vent to the cry: ''Away hame to...wherever it
is ye came frae in the first place.''
He was, as I recall, of Dutch extraction, but now, as then, Holland
were not much of a force on the oval ball scene. Frans gave loyal
service to his adopted country as a haul of 17 caps can testify.
And there should be no doubt that Greg Rusedski, currently on
lease-lend from Canada, will provide even quicker service to British
tennis. Beaten by Pete Sampras he may have been, but he brought a
charisma to the courts which the long string of home-grown failures,
from which I exclude Jeremy Bates, could never match.
I think now we could do without the Union Flag bandanas and ''the fans
are just wonderful'' quotes, but if he keeps booming them down at
140mph, and smiling, we surely can accept him as one of our own. He has
a lot more right to call himself British than Zola Budd ever did.
Yes, I can understand the disappointment of such as Chris Wilkinson,
seeing the No.1 spot going to what he considers to be a carpet-bagger,
but the remedy is in his own hands. He can beat Mr Rusedski and claim it
back.
International sporting qualifications are quite the most complicated
area in which to adjudicate, a veritable maze of passports and visas. I
note the advert presently appearing on our screens recalling that the
last Briton to win the women's singles at Wimbledon was Virginia Wade.
Indeed -- if you conveniently can forget she was South-African born.
Among my treasured possessions is a Scotland-Ireland rugby programme
of 1991, in which the visiting back division was listed as follows: Jim
Staples, born London, Simon Geoghegan, Knebworth, Herts; Brendan Mullin,
Jerusalem; David Curtis, Harare, Zimbabwe; Keith Crossan, Belfast; Brian
Smith, St George's Queensland; Rob Saunders, Nottingham.
Did poor Crossan manage to understand any of the team talk, one
wonders? Jack Charlton has built a Republic of Ireland football team
which has been a great deal more successful than any other outfit in
these islands. He did it by choosing players whose connections with the
Emerald Isle were often quite distant.
''If I have got to concentrate only on guys who are playing in
Ireland, then I guarantee we will win absolutely nothing,'' he declared.
''Let me go to England, Scotland, anywhere in the world where there are
quality players with Irish grannies, and I'll produce the results.''
All great teams take the best which is available. The All Blacks squad
in this World Cup was a mixture of Western Samoa, Tongan and Fijian
influence -- and South African.
The man who very nearly brought down the Springboks in the epic final
was none other than Andrew Mehrtens, born and coached in Durban.
Just for the record, I thought our most improved forward was the
Bristol-born and Bath based David Hilton.
We live in an ever shrinking world in which an increasing number of
young sportsmen flit from country to country. It is unrealistic to
believe that they can be coralled into representing only the land of
their birth.
What I do believe is required, however, is some consistency in the
qualifications muddles. As a point of principle, no player should be
allowed to switch from one country's colours to another - as Brian Smith
of Australia and Ireland was allowed to - unless the circumstances are
quite exceptional.
Once you choose sides, that should be it. Some form of residential
qualification is not unreasonable either, though hard to implement
within the United Kingdom.
A few years ago, Jason McAteer of Bolton Wanderers, discovered he was
qualified to play for Northern Ireland, Wales, England and the Republic
of Ireland, eventually being swayed by Charlton's blarney.
Now Matthew le Tissier, the exciting Southampton striker, finds,
because he was born in the Channel Islands, he could play for any one of
the home countries. In which case, young Matt, may I encourage you to
listen to the charms of Mr Craig Brown, a man who will be happy to give
you the freedom of Hampden.

ITALIAN Ivan Gotti came within eight seconds of taking the Tour de
France lead from Frenchman Laurent Jalabert yesterday, when the team
time trial shook up the overall standings.
Gotti, a renowned climber making his Tour debut and with no career
wins to his name, profited from a magnificent third stage ride by his
Italian Gewiss Ballan team, who covered the 41 miles from Mayenne to
Alencon in 1hr 13min 10sec.
Jalabert had confidently expected to retain the yellow jersey he won
in Monday's second stage with the help of his Spanish ONCE team.
Gotti, the best-placed Gewiss Ballan rider, was twenty-sixth overall
overnight, 43 seconds behind Jalabert, but with 15 miles left of the
time trial, ONCE found themselves 35sec down on the Italian team. Only a
supreme effort by Jalabert and his team-mates kept ONCE in the frame as
they finished second in 1-13-45, 24 seconds ahead of Miguel Indurain's
third-placed Banesto team.
Jalabert confessed afterwards he knew nothing of Gotti, now second
overall, and had not realised he was a threat. ''I did not know he was
so close in the overall standings,'' said the Frenchman. ''But we could
not have done any more today. We all rode flat out.''
Stage 3 (41.8-mile team time trial from Mayenne to Alencon):
1, Gewiss Ballan (Italy) 1hr 13min 10sec; 2, ONCE (Spain) 35sec
behind; 3, Banesto (Spain) at 59sec; 4, Mapei GB (Italy) at 1min 33sec;
5, MG Technogym (Italy) same time; 6, Motorola (US) at 1-59; 7, Festina
(Andorra) at 2-21; 8, Lampre (Italy) at 2-27; 9, Castorama (France) at
2-32; 10, Novell (Holland) at 2-51.
Overall standings: 1, L Jalabert (France/ONCE) 12hr 38min 35sec; 2, I
Gotti (Italy/Gewiss Ballan) 08sec behind; 3, B Riis (Denmark/Gewiss
Ballan) at 09sec; 4, G Colombo (Italy/Gewiss Ballan) at 12sec; 5, M

CHRIS Boardman, who is recovering from a fractured ankle and wrist
after crashing in Saturday's Tour de France prologue, said surgeons
operating on his broken left ankle found the bone had come away in seven
or eight pieces.
''They put the main bits back together and threw the rest away. The
cast has come off for a bit of physio to see how we are getting on and
will go back on later. Really it is just a question of waiting to see,''
he said.

THE UK dairy industry will be the casualty of the 1990s unless milk
companies face up to the realities of the increasingly competitive
post-deregulation market-place, Scottish Pride chief executive Jim Hosea
yesterday warned.
French, Belgian and other European Community producers of UHT milk
could pose a threat to the UK industry, if lower costs allow them to put
their product on British supermarket shelves as cheaply as domestic
dairy companies.
European and New Zealand cheese-makers are another danger, while the
perpetual improvement of distribution networks will ultimately make it
easier to transport liquid milk, which is already arriving in the south
by way of the Channel Tunnel.
Referring to the decline of UK engineering during the 1980s, and the
respective falls of the car and motor-cycle industries in the previous
two decades, Mr Hosea said: ''I think in the 1990s, if we don't get our
act together, the same will happen to the dairy industry.''
Mr Hosea, the company doctor who joined Scottish Pride in April last
year, made no bones about the ''tremendous pricing pressures'' facing
the former manufacturing arm of the old Scottish Milk Marketing Board,
following deregulation of the dairy industry last November.
Scottish Pride, now a public company in its own right, yesterday
announced pre-tax profits of #730,000 for the year to April 1. However,
with seven months of this period preceding deregulation, complex
accounting procedures were used to calculate the year's profit and a
re-stated loss for the previous year of #2.79m.
Perhaps more relevant is chairman Lord Sanderson's statement that
current trading is ahead of last year and Mr Hosea's confidence that the
full-year result will be an improvement on that for the 12 months to
April 1.
As indicated last October, no dividend will be paid for about three
years, until what Mr Hosea considers to have been a ''financially weak''
company is restored to a position of strength.
Mr Hosea is undoubtedly well aware that news of his #145,833 fee and
#100,000 performance-related bonus -- paid during a year when the
workforce was cut from 1108 to 981 -- may hit a nerve with Scottish
Pride's 3000-plus dairy farming shareholders.
He is keen to ensure Scottish Pride does not become tarred with the
same brush as the privatised utilities, on the issue of directors' pay.
Mr Hosea believes in ''market rates for the best in the market'' but
not market rates for incumbent chiefs, many of whom he considers would
not still be heading up utilities had their jobs been opened up to
outside competition.
Referring to his pay and his 990,000 share options, exercisable at a
price of 53p, Mr Hosea said: ''I want to be well remunerated for the
risks I took and the performance I will achieve.
''If I don't perform, the shareholders should get rid of me.''
Referring to market conditions, which make it virtually impossible for
small operators to survive, Mr Hosea said: ''There is no doubt there is
an excess of processing capacity in this country, as is evidenced by
announcements by Unigate and Northern Foods.''
He believes the demise of doorstep deliveries, hammered by
supermarkets sometimes willing to sell milk at a loss, can perhaps be
slowed but never reversed.
The big five supermarket chains, which now control nearly 70% of the
liquid milk market, have exacerbated pricing pressures in the
post-deregulation environment.
Scottish Pride, which aims to invest about #5m this year, is putting
money into plastic milk-bottle production and a butter-making facility
at Govan.
Seeing the production of the type of packaging supermarkets favour as
an important way of adding value, it is also investing in the
pre-packing of its Rothesay, Campbeltown and Arran cheeses.
With the current ''Rule 4.2'' arrangement for trading in Scottish
Pride shares due to cease in September, the company has applied to join
the Alternative Investment Market.

ANALYSIS.
MORE than half of the #17.5m trading surplus which Scottish Enterprise
reported yesterday was the result of the Government agency's decision
not to comply with generally accepted accounting principles.
Scottish Enterprise's unconventional decision to claim a #9.3m surplus
on the revaluation of its investment property portfolio as income more
than covered the #5.4m of losses it sustained in the Healthcare
International debacle at Clydebank, which proved an embarrassment to the
Government.
Tom Woodbridge, head of finance at Scottish Enterprise, last night
admitted: ''We don't really fully comply here.''
Statement of Standard Accounting Practice (SSAP) 19 states that, with
the exception of pension funds and the long-term business of insurance
companies, ''changes in the value of investment properties should not be
taken to the profit-and-loss account but should be disclosed as a
movement on an investment revaluation reserve''.
The SSAP was amended last August to provide for inclusion of the
changes in a more detailed statement of total recognised gains and
losses, along the lines of a revaluation reserve.
However, the principle that companies cannot claim profit on
unrealised gains on investment properties remains unchanged. Gains on
revaluation should only affect the balance sheet.
Revealing that the accounting issue had been a matter of discussion
with the National Audit Office, Mr Woodbridge said gains and losses on
property revaluation had been taken to the income and expenditure
account since Scottish Development Agency days.
He claimed that a change in this policy to comply with financial
reporting standards would have had ''quite a lumpy effect'' on the
accounts for the year to end-March.
Mr Woodbridge said: ''We are allowed not to comply with SSAPs where it
would give a wrong account of our business.''
Referring to previous deficits on revaluation of the property
portfolio, which were properly charged against income, Mr Woodbridge
said: ''We thought that putting that (#9.3m surplus) to our revaluation
reserves, when we are looking at a huge deficit situation, would not
truly reflect the position.''
However, Scottish Enterprise is talking with its auditors about
changing its treatment of surpluses on property revaluations in the
current year's accounts, which will consolidate the results of local
enterprise companies for the first time.
Following the appointment of receivers to Healthcare International
last November, Scottish Enterprise lodged a claim for outstanding debt.
Having formed the opinion that there is no prospect of recouping any
of its #1.4m of equity funding, and only a slight chance of recovering
any of its unsecured #4m ''leg-up'' loan, Scottish Enterprise charged
#5.4m in arriving at its surplus on trading activities.
With six other companies in which Scottish Enterprise had a
#100,000-plus stake going into liquidation during the year, the
Government agency had to charge another #1.2m in its accounts.
This included a #375,000 write-off, covering loan principal and
interest, which was a result of the collapse, this spring, of the
Strathclyde Institute for Computer Integrated Manufacturing.
The institute was set up by the Scottish Development Agency and
Strathclyde University in 1987. Its failure resulted in a #675,000
write-off for the university.
A team of eight, led by former institute chief executive Gordon
Colborn,   purchased the viable SI Associates' consultancy arm before
the institute went into liquidation.

HOLLAND House, the Glasgow-based electrical wholesaler, last night
claimed victory in its battle for control of Ferguson Shipbuilders in
Port Glasgow.
Frank Dunnet, the 80-year-old millionaire who owns Holland House,
revealed that the company had secured acceptances of its #4.9m bid from
shareholders who own 52.57% of Ferguson, after extending its original
June 20 deadline for acceptance.
A circular was sent out to all of Ferguson's 290 shareholders last
night, informing them that the 406p-a-share offer had become
unconditional and giving those who have not already accepted two weeks
to do so, if they so wish.
Last night's news ended months of uncertainty surrounding the
ownership of the Port Glasgow yard, which Ferguson chief executive Bill
Scott had considered a major obstacle to securing new orders.
Ferguson chairman Sir Ross Belch set the takeover ball rolling with
his own failed bid for the yard in February, with a cash-plus-shares
offer through his Altnacraig Shipping company.
This provoked a counter-bid by a management buy-out team led by Mr
Scott.
However, both withdrew after Holland House came on the scene with a
cash-only offer which valued Ferguson at #1m more than its net assets.
The board is known to have been privately divided over the sole
remaining offer.
Mr Dunnet, pleased with the way things have turned out, said: ''We can
now get on with the job in hand and that is securing orders for ships
and building them.''
Although commenting that it was too early to say what plans he might
have for the yard, Mr Dunnet said he was looking forward to working with
the management of Ferguson, which he believed had done very well up to
now.

the stock market had estimated.
The deal puts Dalgety well on the way to achieving the #300m worth of
disposals it was aiming for. It has made a strategic shift into pet
foods with the purchase of Quaker Oats' European interests in this

BRITISH Gas announced a further phase of its four-year restructuring
programme yesterday with the scaling down of its London headquarters
which is expected to result in annual cost savings of about #30m. By the
end of the year the company will move out of its 17-floor headquarters
in London and move to just two floors of another building in the city.
The bulk of the staff will be transferred from three ''inefficient and
expensive sites'' in London to a new office building next to its
existing exploration and production premises in Reading. The new
building is expected to be completed by next summer.

<HEADLINE>Abbey National in agreed #285m takeover of FNFC</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>977551496</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
ABBEY National is making an agreed #285m cash offer for Britain's
largest consumer credit house, First National Finance Corporation, as
part of its strategy of reducing its dependence upon the traditional
mortgage lending business.
When the deal is completed, one of the thickest files in the Bank of
England in the ''lifeboat'' section will presumably be locked away now
that FNFC has a secure lender of last resort in control.
In the early 1970s, FNFC acquired notoriety for its lending policies
under then chairman Pat Matthews and had to be rescued through Bank of
England funding in the secondary banking crisis. That was sparked off by
the collapse in property values as the inevitable consequences of the
expansionist policies of the then Chancellor Tony Barber's boom.
History partially repeated itself in the earlier years of this decade
when losses of #47m were seen in 1991 and of #57m the following year as
a consequence of the Lawson boom in 1988-89. That resulted in a rescue
rights issue of Preference shares and also bank debt having to be
rescheduled in an operation masterminded by Barings.
In the half-year to April, FNFC achieved pre-tax profits of #15.5m
which compares with the mere #1.3m achieved in the year to last October.
Its business was traditionally secondary mortgage lending and
commercial property financing. But in recent years, the emphasis has
been much more to unsecured lending for home inprovements which now
accounts for 55% of its new business.
However, it still has a large portfolio of loss-making loans which are
being managed down and one advantage of a takeover by Abbey National is
that the cost of funding will be lower, helped by the High Street bank's
high credit rating.
The attraction to chief executive Peter Birch that it goes some way
towards having up to 40% of business outside the mortgage market even if
that may be reversed if it emerges as the successful bidder for the
National &amp; Provincial Building Society with the #1000m decision probably
known before the end of this month.
FNFC uses a network of 2000 home improvement suppliers such as the
retail ''sheds'' and these could be used to sell other of the bank's
products in a highly competitive market.
FNFC has over 300,000 loan accounts and as most of these are joint,
the potential catchment area for new business will be over 500,000
people. The loan book is some #1110m.
Abbey National's existing unsecured loan book is relatively small and
the deal will turn it into one of the larger players in one step.
The terms are 110.5p cash for each FNFC Ordinary share (up 18[1/2]p to
108[1/2]p), for each First Preference 100p cash and 189p cash for each
Second Preference share.
Abbey National shares softened 3p to 473p.
FNFC, which employs about 1000 people, will be operated as a separate
entity within Abbey National. Finance director Tim Ingram will join the
Abbey National board.

THE long overdue management shake-up at the NFC transport group is now
taking place with the new team of chairman Sir Christopher Bland,
formerly of LWT, and chief executive Gerry Murphy taking harsh action.
Out goes Robbie Burns managing director of the transport and logistics
division who was heir apparent twice as chief executive. He resigned
some time after Peter Sherlock was appointed to the position in August
1993 after having left Bass.
But when Mr Sherlock was sacked just one year later, Mr Burns withdrew
his resignation and obviously hoped that as one of the ''old guard'' he
would eventually succeed to the post. He joined the then state-owned
National Freight Corporation in 1971 as a graduate trainee.
Instead, Sir Christopher brought in Mr Murphy from Greencore, the
former Irish Sugar beet processor, and who before that had spent a dozen
years with Grand Metropolitan.
The parting is described as amicable and as he is on a two-year
rolling contract, he may receive compensation totalling up to perhaps
#350,000.
Also quitting is Denis Olliver who was responsible for moving services
worldwide and who may be get slightly less at up to #330,000.
This results as part of the reorganisation which splits the group into
three regional units -- UK and Ireland, Europe and America, while two
separate worldwide supervisory boards will oversee logistics and moving
services.
Terry Stockley (50) has been brought in from BET textile rental
division to head the UK and Irish operations, while Graham Roberts (44)
is an in-house man currently in charge of Exel Logistics Europe to head
up the Continental activities. The search is on for someone to lead the
American operations.
In the half-year to April, NFC saw profits slump from #50.5m to #34.3m
before a #35m restructuring provision.

EVER-acquisitive Stagecoach has found another bus operator to buy
which will expand its interests in the East Midlands area of England.
It has agreed terms with Chesterfield Transport which values the
company at #3m. It operates bus services in and around Chesterfield with
a fleet of 154 buses and coaches and 320 employees. It also has an
engineering department.
Chesterfield Transport made profits of #111,000 on turnover of #7.6m
in the year to March, when it had assets worth #2m.
Stagecoach intends to merge the business with its existing subsidiary,
East Midland Motor Services. The combined operation will then be run
from a single site and further economies will come from group purchasing
and other advantages of scale. There will be additional investment in
new vehicles.
Overall the group reckons the purchase will strengthen its market
position in the competitive East Midlands area.
The deal follows the usual pattern of Stagecoach's development, with
savings realised in merging small local operators into existing
activities. The acquisition shows it is not going to be put off its
strategy of increasing its share of the national market towards 25% by
the recent referral of its #4.2m purchase of Ayrshire Bus Owners to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission and other brushes with the competition
authorities.

THE Prime Minister has emerged as the clear winner from the
Conservative Party's leadership battle, but the decisive victory the
City hoped for has not materialised.
There is little in the outcome for financial markets to celebrate. It
is difficult to see that John Major has been visibly strengthened by the
contest, and it is a fair bet that economic policy will be increasingly
influenced by electoral considerations.
The stock market had closed by the time the result was declared, but
throughout the day it was anticipating the Prime Minister's success. By
the end of trading the FTSE-100 share index had gained 25.5 points to
3349.2.
Just before Major dropped his bombshell the index had clambered up to
3403.8, the first time it had been clear of the 3400 mark for 16 months.
The rally came to an abrupt end and for a couple of days in the middle
of last week the Footsie was trading below 3300.
By last night the equity market had recovered more than half of its
politically induced losses and was 1.6% below its high point before the
battle began.
The pound lost ground in the morning, but was able to recover the bulk
of its losses before Major's victory gave it a final boost.
The trade weighted index, calculated at 4 o'clock, was 0.1 points
lower at 83.4. On this basis it lost 0.7% of its international value
over the period of the leadership struggle.
On the back of the result sterling gained nearly a quarter of a cent
and half a pfennig. Overall it added 0.21 cents to $1.5983 and 0.57
pfennigs to DM2.2093. In North American trading it continued to make
further headway.
Gilts were also give a late boost by the outcome, but remain around
three points adrift over the period of the contest.
Financial markets may have some further catching up to do in the next
few days, but earlier speculation that a decisive Major victory would
add 50 points to the Footsie looks a little excessive.
The worst result for the markets would have been a narrow win for the
Prime Minister, leaving him a lame-duck leader whose immediate future
remained in doubt.
His defeat and a second-round battle would have extended the
uncertainty which markets hate so much. A new leader could well have
meant a new Chancellor of the Exchequer and although Kenneth Clarke's
credentials have been somewhat spoilt by his dispute with the Governor
of the Bank of England over interest rates, he is seen as the man most
likely to deliver responsible fiscal and monetary policies.
Nevertheless one effect of the contest has been to put tax cuts firmly
on the agenda. Clarke made this clear last week when he unveiled the
Treasury's revised forecasts for the economy last week.
But it is a matter of degree. James Capel's Adam Cole said that he
expected Clarke to deliver #2000m to #3000m of cuts in November, against
the #5000m to #6000m that might have come under a different leadership.
The same point is made in NatWest's latest equity market commentary.
''Tax cuts were always on the agenda for Novembers 1995 and 1996. It
is a political imperative for the rehabilitation of the Conservative
Party. We assumed it will happen under the stewardship of the current
incumbents of Numbers 10 and 11 Downing Street. If either Mr Clarke or
Mr Major is replaced then it would be a reasonable assumption that tax
cuts might be even greater.''
The implication of this is that gilts and sterling would be
potentially vulnerable to a relaxation of fiscal policy and to the
continuation of a less than rigorous monetary policy. But the ultimate
beneficiary ought to be the equity market.
Treasury and independent economists are forecasting a recovery in
consumer spending on the back of tax cuts and the billions of pounds due
to be disbursed over the next two years as a result of the spate of
building society takeovers and mergers. Consumer stocks can be expected
to come back into favour as a result.
NatWest Securities has just made significant changes to its portfolio
of 15 shares which it hopes will outperform the market. Out have gone
the three utilities, British Gas, British Telecom, and South West
Electricity, and in their place have come Marks and Spencer, Scottish
and Newcastle, and Berkeley Group, the builder which is just preferred
Barratt Developments.
The firm's strategists say that the middle months of 1995 are proving
to be some of the toughest for companies exposed to the consumer.
''However, looking through to 1997 the balance of demand should shift
markedly towards the consumer, a view which is largely independent of
the political backcloth.''
Undoubtedly Clarke has the scope for fiscal easing in November. Next
year's PSBR is projected at 2% of GDP, well within the Maastricht
guideline of 3%.
The economic case for tax cuts is much weaker. It could make the
Government's inflation target more difficult to achieve. A higher PSBR
inevitably means that more gilts have to be sold.
Sterling has been under a cloud for most of this year and by last
night was 5.8% below its international value at the start of the year.
It is difficult to see a significant recovery for the pound.

SPLENDID news from India, where a Bombay magistrate has just solved
the problem of unfettered media power and cultural imperialism by
issuing a warrant for the arrest of Rupert Murdoch.
The tycoon isn't being held responsible for the Sun's efforts to win
the last General Election for John Major (''It's the Sun Wot Got Us Into
the Mess We're In Today'') but for the activities of his Star TV
satellite network. Couldn't happen to a nicer bloke.
It seems that recently a guest on one of Star's talks shows is alleged
to have made insulting remarks about Mohandas K Gandhi. In India, as the
Bombay magistrate has just made clear, this is one of the things you
never do.
Indeed, Gandhi's family are even threatening an action for defamation
over the incident, promising to claim a measly #100m from the man whose
News of the World has just done its bit for standards in journalism by
giving the universe the exclusive, high-minded, and morally blameless
story of Hugh Grant's hooker. Somehow #100m doesn't seem anything like
enough.
Blind spot
SPEAKING of which, ain't it just awful the things a tabloid hack has
to put up with when he's just trying to give large sums of money to a
blameless bawd? Or as Allan Hall, US editor of the Daily Mirror, records
of the junket -- sorry, ''exhaustive inquiries'' -- in LA to find the
girl who may or may not have shared a lime-flavoured condom with the
nice but dim Mr Grant: ''Many reporters, this one included, found
ourselves up blind alleys because the hookers' concept of truth is often
as refined as their sense of decency.''
Unlike, it goes without saying, Her Britannic Majesty's Press Corps.
English to a tea
IT IS obvious, of course, that any nation capable of becoming utterly
obsessed with tarts and silly thespians is in a bad way. As Richard
Cohen rightly stated in the Washington Post the other day: ''To the
question of why Hugh Grant did it, there can be but one answer: He's
English. Without a doubt, the English came up with their wonderful
language, high tea and chintz couches to disguise what dirty little
minds they all have.''
Couldn't have put it better ourselves. Or as Dame Barbara Cartland,
the recently interviewed 93-year-old blancmange and authorette of 621
unreadable hymns to lurve, feels obliged to reveal of the disturbing
national obsession with sex: ''It's revolting and nasty and very bad for
the young.''
We need only add that Mr Grant is soon to appear in a movie called
Restoration (no, not of his reputation) in which he plays a portrait
painter at the court of Charles II who advises the monarch's doctor on
the best way to seduce the royal concubine. Terrible thing, typecasting.
Hi, lover
STILL, if the darling boy was really desperate for novelty while in
California, he should have taken himself off to Santa Monica, where
pilots are available to help couples join the ''mile-high'' club. For
prices ranging from $199 to $279 lovers are flown around for a couple of
hours while they do whatever comes naturally. Chances of the vice squad
intervening are believed to be remote.
The American way
HAPPY birthday, meanwhile, to America, 219 years old as of yesterday,
and still growing up. Just to get the celebrations off to a good start,
the National Safety Council estimated this week that 30,000 people will
be injured in traffic accidents during the holiday while 630 will die
with exercising their constitutional right to drive very fast.
Meanwhile, 13,000 are expected to be hurt by fireworks.
It isn't all bad news though. Yesterday in Virginia thousands of
people were lining up before dawn outside police stations and court
houses so they could be among the first to obtain newly introduced state
permits to carry concealed weapons. You will be pleased to hear that,
according to one report: ''Most of the people who picked up applications
yesterday said they have no intention of breaking any laws.''

THAT seems to be that. It was a narrow squeak but, under the rules,
John Major has won. Loyalty is the first Tory virtue, and all loyal
Tories will now rally round. Any who refuse can expect the wrath of the
rest of the party to fall on them, and the result may not be a pretty
sight in certain individual cases.
But whether the Prime Minister's gamble has really paid off is another
matter. He remained unlikely to restore his authority in the country
while his authority inside his own party was shrinking by the day. To
have stopped the rot is at least a step towards the renewal of healthy
growth. But it will hardly come of itself.
There is a very cynical interpretation that could be put on the
Conservative leadership election. It is that the MPs have stared, are
still staring, into the abyss, and have made a simple calculation to
save as many as possible of their own necks. As was said by one minister
-- obviously not a beneficiary of the campaign to raise education
standards -- Major was the ''least worst option''. What we see therefore
is the British political establishment gazing selfishly at its navel,
which conceals no guts, thinking of only how many snouts can remain in
the trough. In other words, they have timidly opted for John Major's
cowardly Conservatism rather than John Redwood's courageous
Conservatism.
But perhaps a kindlier interpretation will emerge from the rest of the
week's events. In the rose garden of No.10 Downing Street 10 days ago,
Major presented his problems as the work of troublemakers who were
obscuring the Government's achievements and holding up the evolution of
policies to win back popular support. If he could shut these pests up,
why then, all would be well. This restated the familiar argument that
his real difficulties lie only in presentation.
But the events since that Thursday afternoon have surely shown that
this is no superficial matter but deeper forces are at work. For a
start, Major never expected one of his colleagues in the Cabinet to
stand against him, and was furious when it happened. In other words, he
had not appreciated how far the discontent was spreading beyond the
fanatical inner circle of Euro-sceptics.
It was also a matter of measures, not just of men. I wrote here, the
day after John Redwood declared his candidacy, that he deserved his
chance. Granted that a campaign for election does not always show a
politician to best advantage, I cannot say that he used his chance
especially well. His programme as a whole fell a little flat, and he
never got a bandwagon rolling.
Yet he did say things worth listening to. He had fresh ideas, though
he may have felt obliged to dress his lamb as mutton in the hope, vain
as it turned out, of luring support from those whose palates have long
been jaded by the political equivalent of fast food. In the process, he
managed to obscure some of the choicest specialities in his repertoire,
his readiness to take the people's side against the state, and to take
his country's side when its interests clash with others'. The nearest he
came to mother's cooking, plain, wholesome and tasty, was when he
declared he would never ''abolish the pound''.
Even behind an agenda which was only implied, it is no minor
achievement to have rallied 89 votes, nearly a third of the
Parliamentary Tory party. This is much more than the Euro-sceptic
faction as such has ever mustered. It is likely to harden up the already
apparent tendency in the Government towards a harder line against
Brussels and all its works.
And we must presume that the extra votes, beyond the Euro-sceptics
came to Redwood from those who found much to favour in his approach to
domestic policy, and in his complaint that this has lost direction
during the post-Thatcher era. He drew attention to the fact, that, for
all the rhetoric of the past 16 years, and the successes of
privatisation and curbing the trade unions, the Tories have never
actually succeeded in rolling back the state. Public expenditure rises,
taxes rise with it, and still the problems which all this intervention
is meant to solve are not solved.
The Prime Minister would be wise not to treat such points as the
grumblings of a minority. On the contrary, they are obviously true, and
he now has the chance to respond to them. He could not make a better
start than by putting Redwood in charge of finding some coherent
answers. That would combine the purposes of burying the hatchet with the
89 MPs, and moving the Government in a rightward, populist direction,
back towards the voters it has lost.
Obviously, in any event, some movement has to take place if the
Conservatives are to have a hope of retrieving victory from the next
General Election. The single most compelling argument for getting rid of
Major was that he could not win that election. He said this was because
of disloyalty in the ranks. His critics said it was because he had his
policy mix wrong. Though he has won the campaign, I would say they have
had the better of the argument. It was not just a matter of disloyalty.
On the contrary, it was a matter of policy. It is now for a generous
winner to draw the proper conclusions.

A YOUNG Easterhouse musician has overcome all the odds to win a
coveted place at an American music academy.
Only a handful of musicians from Scotland have been offered places at
the Berklee College of Music in Boston, which has a reputation for
accepting the most gifted young artists.
But before 16-year-old Marc Wotherspoon can take his place, he has to
raise at least #16,000 for fees and flights to allow him to start the
four-year Bachelor of Music course.
Yesterday his mother, Helen, who is divorced and on income support,
said: ''Getting into Berklee was really a great achievement, and if Marc
is that good, he should get the chance to be taught by the best.''
Marc was encouraged to apply for Berklee by Scots saxophonist Tommy
Smith, who taught at the college himself.
Marc said: ''The course is renowned in world music circles and would
give me the best training possible. They will only keep my place for a
year.
''It's the best opportunity I will ever have to learn from some of the
top musicians and then come back here and share the knowledge.''
The fact he was only able to practise on his instruments, which
include a seven-piece Pearl drum kit, guitar and bongos, in his tiny
bedroom, has not held Marc back.
Along with his brother Jason, 20, an accomplished guitarist, Marc
practised for hours in the family's flat at Elibank Street, Ruchazie.
The former Sensational Alex Harvey Band member Ted McKenna was so
impressed by Marc's ability that he agreed to take him on for drum
lessons.
Now, with the same determination which allowed him to start teaching
himself at the age of 11, Marc has launched himself into raising the
funds from trusts, sponsorship, and donations.
He has written hundreds of letters, including pleas to rock stars Phil
Collins and Jools Holland, to see if they are willing to back his dream.

Cape Canaveral, Tuesday
THE American space shuttle Atlantis and the Russian space station Mir
shared a last ''dance'' in orbit today, then parted company to bring to
an end the first international docking mission for 20 years.
Atlantis carried a crew of eight that includes an American astronaut
and two Russian cosmonauts who had lived on Mir for nearly four months.
Two cosmonauts in a free-flying Soyuz capsule snapped photographs and
took video footage of Atlantis as the shuttle released its embrace of
the space station.
At the controls of Atlantis, veteran commander Robert ''Hoot'' Gibson
said ''the words 'cosmic ballet' came to mind'' as he flew the shuttle
in a circle around the two Russian spacecraft.
The shuttle's departure from Mir closed the first chapter of what the
US and Russia hope will become a long story of post-Cold War
co-operation in space.
Atlantis is due to make six more trips to Mir by 1997, when the United
States and Russia aim to begin assembling a new #26bn global space
station with the help of Europe, Canada, and Japan.
''This is Nasa's finest hour,'' senior manager Tommy Holloway told a
briefing at Mission Control in Houston, Texas.
Ground controllers on two continents spent a few hair-raising moments
watching the space station drift abnormally as soon as the shuttle
undocked. Russian controllers in Kalinigrad, near Moscow, detected the
problem and what was said to be a loss of attitude control was described
as ''a minor hiccup''.
Atlantis had been locked with Mir in a metallic embrace since Thursday
while their combined crews carried out a hectic schedule of cargo
transfers and bio-medical research.
The shuttle will orbit Earth until Friday, when it is due to land at
the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida, the site of its June 27
launch.--Reuter.

A DOCTOR fighting to clear his name after Strathclyde Regional Council
closed down his old folk's home in Renfrewshire is to be given the
opportunity to highlight his concerns in full at an appeal tribunal.
Dr Sohail Chaudhry was given this assurance at the appeal hearing at
Paisley Sheriff Court yesterday, despite a warning that his case could
be flawed.
Dr Chaudhry's residential home, Caldwell House, was shut down last
December when his registration was revoked amid allegations of neglect.
Sheriff Principal Robert Hay and two other tribunal members heard
yesterday that he was so demoralised after being ''hounded and
harassed'' over a six-year period by senior social worker Davina Young
that he threw in the towel and offered to shut down voluntarily,
believing he could control the closure in a humane and properly
controlled manner.
The hearing was told the doctor's solicitor had written to the social
work committee on learning of its proposed cancellation of his
registration, offering to close voluntarily, intimating that he would
not attend the region's meeting to discuss the licence withdrawal, and
declaring that he would not be appealing against the decision.
Dr Chaudhry agreed that the letter had been sent to the council, but
claimed it contained misleading information. He said he had only spoken
to his solicitor on the telephone and that his instructions had been
misunderstood.
Sheriff Hay warned that the sole purpose of the tribunal was to try to
determine whether the council had acted reasonably or unreasonably. He
told the doctor: ''You may feel that the letter places you in some
difficulty.''
Dr Chaudrhy said he had decided not to attend the committee hearing
last December, as Mrs Young had led him to believe the meeting might not
even take place since he had volunteered to close down the operation
himself.
He claimed he would have attended had he known the meeting was to be
held, and that he decided to lodge a formal appeal only after stories
about the closure threat were subsequently leaked to the press by an
unknown source.
The sheriff warned that he was seeking to raise grievances now which
should have been brought to the attention of the social work committee
at that meeting on December 16.
However, he added: ''I am not saying that the appeal is hopeless. We
are prepared to hear evidence that you were deliberately hounded out of
Caldwell House, but none the less you in effect abandoned your appeal by
your non-attendance at the meeting.
''We will still have regard to the circumstances under which you did
not attend the meeting, and will listen to any evidence you may wish to
produce about events leading up to the closure decision.''
All three members of the tribunal have stressed that their prime remit
is to consider the procedures surrounding the final cancellation of the
doctor's registration and not the consequences of that decision.
Giving evidence yesterday, the doctor claimed that Mrs Young had
provided the social work committee with distorted reports about his
conduct and management practices.
He claimed that Mrs Young was biased against him and had made a number
of racist remarks about him.
He also claimed that she single-handedly set about trying to ruin him
and added: ''We were being starved to death. Even the vultures wait for
their prey to die, but not her.''
The doctor said that a year before closure the home was caring for 24
residents, but by the time it was closed there were only nine remaining.
The hearing continues today.

<HEADLINE>Conference told of drug and alcohol abuse. Doctors pour out litany of despair</HEADLINE>

ONE in 12 doctors is abusing drink, drugs, or both, and 10 commit
suicide every year, the British Medical Association's annual conference
heard in Harrogate yesterday.
The figures were part of a litany of despair backing a conference
demand for the NHS to establish a 24-hour helpline providing
professional counsellors for doctors.
Dr Michael Wilks, a member of the Association's ethical committee,
said that American research indicated that two per cent of doctors were
addicted to drugs, three per cent to drink, and three per cent depended
on or abused a combination of both.
Dr Peter Newman, a Norfolk GP, described how last week he had to drive
a friend and colleague to a psychiatric hospital after a breakdown.
After a successful surgical career, his friend had spent 10 happy
years in general practice before the introduction of the 1990 GP
contract.
Because of work-related stress, he had an enforced sabbatical for
three months last year to recover from anxiety and depression.
''When he returned the stress returned,'' said Dr Newman. ''Complaints
went up, satisfaction went down, the anxiety increased at each
consultation. He saw little point in getting up each morning.
''One day he walked out through a waiting-room filled with
open-mouthed patients.
''The patients always expected him to be there for them with no regard
to his own feelings or health.
''The drinking started, the self-administered medication -- valium and
anti-depressants. Then I got a desperate phone call last week: 'I can't
work. Please help.' I drove to see him. He confessed all his suicidal
feelings and his alcoholism.
''He sat there in his room, sobbing with his shoulders hunched. He had
let down his partners, his patients, his family. I sat for an hour
listening to this out-pouring.
''Admission to a psychiatric hospital 70 miles away was arranged to
protect him. That produced more anxiety because of the separation from
his family.
''I drove him there that evening. It was a devastating experience.
Here was a dedicated, innovative, and caring professional reduced to a
whimpering, tearful, dejected shadow of his former self.
''What right has the NHS to reduce this individual to this state? The
profession is in crisis. Recruitment is at an all-time low and
stress-related illness at an all-time high.''
A first-hand account of the same problem came from a Birmingham GP, Dr
Fay Wilson, who recalled coming off the wards as a junior doctor weeping
from fatigue.
''I had been in a one-in-two rota with little help. My marriage broke
down,'' she said.
''Three years after I became a junior doctor, I experienced despair,
insomnia, guilt, failure, and exhaustion. I knew the only way out was
for me to die.
''I phoned the Samaritans and I have to tell you the volunteer at the
other end of the line did not know what to do about a doctor crying for
help. Doctors are the ones who are supposed to help.''
After swallowing a cocktail of pills from an on-call bag, Dr Wilson
ended up in a psychiatric hospital. Now 39, and remarried, she is a GP
in Birmingham.
''I did not die, thank God, but I know people who did, for the want of
someone to speak to at the end of a telephone,'' she said. ''I know the
difference between speaking to a trained counsellor and speaking to your
consultant, the person to whom you have to confess failure.''
The conference later moved that all graduating medical students should
affirm an updated version of the Hippocratic oath. Contrary to popular
opinion, the Hippocratic oath is not compulsory.
Dr Stuart Horner, chairman of the BMA ethics committee, said that,
although much of the oath sounded anachronistic, originally being made
to the Greek gods, the principles still applied.
He added: ''There is concern now that the biggest threat to ethics is
the market.''
The chairman of the BMA Scottish Council, Dr John Callander, told the
conference that Scotland's Chief Medical Officer, Dr Robert Kendell, was
being marginalised as a result of the recent reshuffle in the Scottish
Office.
''It would appear that he is being left with public health policy as
his remit,'' said Dr Callander. ''He is losing most of his staff to the
Management Executive and would appear really to being edged out of the
mainstream of the NHS.''

A FORMER groom is suing for damages of #75,000 for injuries she
sustained in a riding accident after she had ''reluctantly'' gone
fox-hunting.
Miss Annette Cloughley, 26, broke her pelvis and collarbone in the
incident when her horse reared up as hounds were searching in a wood.
Miss Cloughley told a jury at the Court of Session in Edinburgh that
she started work at Balcormo Farm, near Leven, Fife, shortly before her
riding accident in October 1990.
She is seeking damages from the farm and the three partners in the
business, Sandra, Dougal, and Jacqueline Low-Mitchell.
Miss Cloughley said she had completed a degree in psychology and
travelled from her home in Northern Ireland to take up the job so that
she could pursue her interest in horses and show-jumping.
A training officer from Portadown, Miss Cloughley told the jury that
Ms Sandra Low-Mitchell had asked her to take a horse called Rio out
''cub-hunting'' because it needed the experience.
Miss Cloughley said she was not entirely happy about going. ''I didn't
hunt at home and I didn't want to start hunting in Scotland,'' she said.
However, she agreed to take Rio out ''cubbing'', a low-key kind of
hunting involving young hounds and horses.
In her action, Miss Cloughley claims that there was a failure on the
part of the farm business to provide proper training or instruction in
''cubbing'' or in handling Rio, which she said she had ridden only twice
before.
She is also alleging there was a failure to fit the martingale -- a
piece of equipment stretching from the bridle to the girth -- properly.
The farm partnership denies her claims.
She told the jury that, when she went to join the hunt, the other
riders had spread out and Rio appeared ''fidgety''. She tried to make
him stand still but he reared up and fell.
''I crawled on my hands and knees over to the side of the road away
from the horse,'' she said. ''As soon as I stopped moving, I couldn't
move again. That was when the pain hit me.''
The hearing continues.

SCOTTISH local authorities face the prospect of mass industrial
tribunal appeals from secondary teachers who say they are due payment
for doing the work of promoted staff.
The main teachers' union, the Educational Institute of Scotland, has
heard from between 250 and 300 assistant principal, senior, and
unpromoted teachers who have reported that they carry out the duties of
principal teachers, who earn more.
The EIS assistant secretary, Mr Ken Wimbor, said yesterday that he was
surprised by the number of equal-pay claims. The total could rise to
about 400, he said.
''After checking to ensure applications are correct in every detail we
will forward them to the central office of the industrial tribunal,''
said Mr Wimbor.
The Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association, which has made several
successful equal-pay claims for its members, is gathering evidence from
others who also say they are entitled to more money.
The EIS asked its representatives in schools to find out from staff if
they believed they had grounds for a claim. These details have been
passed on to the union.
The teachers' unions will seek to move quickly on the processing of
appeals because Strathclyde region has instructed secondary heads to
ensure that no unpromoted member of staff carries out principal teacher
duties.
The instruction is aimed at avoiding further cases from unpromoted
staff and at limiting claims from those who have already been carrying
out promoted teachers' duties.
A raft of successful tribunal cases could cost local authorities
significant sums in back payments to unpromoted staff.
The problem has arisen in smaller departments such as art, drama, and
religious education where schools have not appointed separate principal
teachers.
But, based on returns to the EIS, Mr Wimbor said claims were also
coming in from teachers in modern languages and social subjects.
Strathclyde's action could result in some courses being dropped
because of the unavailability of assistant heads to take on principal
teacher duties where they have been carried out by unpromoted staff.

YOU would think that if the purpose of a good alias is to create at
least some degree of confusion, Mark McGoogan aka Mark McGougan, which
appeared last week in the notice board for cases pending at the High
Court at Edinburgh, really doesn't begin to cut the mustard.
Doggone it
* THEIR lordships sitting in the Justiciary Appeal Court have decided
that an accused who shouted: ''F*** Off Deputy Dawg'' at the police, was
not committing a breach of the peace.
Tee off
* IF you want to know the laws of the game ask anyone but an advocate.
That appears to be the moral of a recent Bench and Bar golf outing in
which the respective winners of the scratch and handicap competitions
had to forfeit victory because of inadvertent breaches of the rules.
One discovered that he had one club too many in his bag, the other
asked a fellow competitor what club he had used for a particular shot,
which, as any hacker will tell you, is not allowed.
While it may seem like rough justice, Lord Marnoch, who ended up
winning one of the competitions by default as it were, was not
complaining. He was obviously careful to count his clubs before he set
out and consult his yardage charts before deciding on what club to hit.
Nil desperandum
* THIS week's award for persistence in the face of adversity goes to
advocate Robert Anthony who appeared to argue a case in the Court of
Criminal Appeal. Crucial to his argument were two previous decisions by
trial judges which had subsequently been criticised by the appeal court.
Mr Anthony began to quote from the words of ''the learned trial
judge'' in one of the cases when one of the three appeal judges, Lord
Cameron, interjected to point out: ''I remember it. I was the judge.''
The other case quoted by Mr Anthony featured Lord Weir as the trial
judge who had got it wrong. How was Mr Anthony supposed to know that
Lord Weir would be sitting as No 2 judge in the appeal court? Showing
some amusement, the appeal judges agreed that Mr Anthony had picked his
cases well and took the case away to think about it. We await the
outcome with interest.
Critic's choice
* HAS Mr Robin McEwan QC, temporary High Court judge and Sheriff at
Ayr, in some way offended Mr Gordon Nicholson QC, Sheriff Principal of
Lothian and Borders?
The reason we ask is because of a rather unkind review of Sheriff
McEwan's latest book -- Pleading in Court -- which appears in the
current edition of the Journal of the Law Society of Scotland.
The Sheriff Principal starts off by describing the book as ''somewhat
curious'', adding that the ''slim volume'' is likely to be of relevance
only to the small audience of advocates and solicitor/advocates.
He then offers the opinion that in some areas, the advice offered in
the book is ''somewhat suspect''.
''Given the very limited scope of this book (which in any event
extends only to 55 pages of text) and given the shortcomings which I
have already touched on, it is frankly difficult to describe this, as is
sometimes done in these pages, as a book which should be in every
practitioner's briefcase.''
It is then noted that in the preface of the book, Mr McEwan ''somewhat
quaintly'' refers to himself as ''the Sheriff''.
No exchange of Christmas cards this year, perhaps?
Hip cop
* IT seems that the efficiency of the hi-tech security system at
Edinburgh Sheriff Court is catching out even the police.
One officer set off the system as he stepped into the building and
duly emptied from his pockets all metallic objects such as coins and
keys. He tried again with the same result.
Security staff were at a loss until the policeman came up with the
only possible cause for alarm. His artificial hip joint.

STRONGER orders, coupled with contributions from acquisitions, enabled
Howden Group, the Glagow-based engineering company, to report pre-tax
profits 11% higher at #30.6m for the year to April.
Turnover increased by 17.3% to #438.2m with acquisitions contributing
sales of #32.8m and profits of #4m.
Also included in the turnover figure is #14.2m arising from the
disposal of the North American Buffalo Air Handling business which was
sold in April for #6.9m.
Howden's order book grew by #55m, or 14%, to #444m with growth
experienced in all markets except Germany where tough market conditions
for mechanical engineering products were seen throughout the year. The
European order book rose by 3% in the year.
Howden Sirocco in the UK won significant orders for heaters for power
stations in Egypt and China and for fans at a Chinese steelworks.
There was a healthy order intake for the aerospace equipment companies
and James Howden in the UK, which won contracts for tunnel-boring
machines for the Kuala Lumpur metro in Malaysia and for Waterloo station
on the Jubilee underground line in London.
The processing and packaging equipment business benefited from further
acquisitions and increased its contribution to group operating profit.
In contrast, Howden Buffalo in Glasgow had a poor year experiencing
lower margins in a competitive market.
Elsewhere, North American profits rose by #2m to #9.8m with order
intake up 11%. Howden Group South Africa had a record year with profits
almost doubling to #5m against #2.7m previously. The improved political
and economic climate has opened up opportunities elsewhere in southern
Africa. In the Pacific Rim, business grew steadily with order intake up
18% and profits up by almost a third.
There was an active programme of business development last year across
the world. The group technology department in Scotland continued to
develop improvements to fan designs. Wirth is building a directional
drilling rig for use in applications such as cable-laying.
The #24.9m cash cost of the acquisitions was partially financed by
#9.8m raised from share issues. The net cash inflow from operating
activities was #31.5m. Capital expenditure was #7m compared with a
depreciation charge of #7.2m.
The balance sheet was healthy. Gearing remained at 35% despite the
inclusion in borrowings of #8.6m export financing from Wirth's large
Taiwanese contract for tunnel-boring machines. Operating profits covered
interest payments nine times.
Earnings per share increased by 13% to 7.6p per share and the total
dividend was raised by 11% to 2.7p after a final payment to shareholders
of 1.81p.
The company is confident about its prospects for the current financial
year. The City shares that confidence and Howden added 2p to 85p where
it yields 4%. Edinburgh stockbroker Bell Lawrie White likes the look of
Howden, citing its strong market positions, further potential for margin
improvement and a good order book.

BLACK as sin. That is Lithuanian director Dalia Ibelhauptaite's
evident view of Verdi's opera, Rigoletto, staged on the vast arena of
Edinburgh's Festival Theatre on Monday night, by the enterprising young
English company, The Opera Company.
In general terms, her interpretation of Rigoletto is one intent on
exposing the corruption, self-interest and manipulativeness of its
characters. She turns over the stone, and the motives seep out like pus
from a festering sore. It is a consistent interpretation, running
through every strand of this economically-designed and staged (though
not cheap-looking) production.
Dark, bald sets -- the Duke's palace is simulated black marble -- and
dark, shadowy lighting are an emotional match for what is some of
Verdi's darkest music (though that fact is not always appreciated by
directors). Actions are cast accordingly -- the orgy  at the palace is
the real McCoy: bare-breasted, libidinous, with the suggestion of
deviant coupling and moral decay.
Within this generally effective framework, performances were variable.
Voices and orchestra (conducted by Roy Laughlin of Opera North) in the
first act sounded lacklustre and woolly. After the interval I shifted to
a different area of the theatre: perhaps it was that, but --
dramatically -- everything, words and gesture, seemed clearer, and there
was definitely more pace and drive.
Mixed quality of singers, with Julian Gavin's Duke a light, fine
quality tenor, Nicholas Folwell's Rigoletto increasingly ardent (though
straining), and Adele Paxton's Gilde a bit breathy and wobbly.
Interesting company, though.

Ian Hamilton, QC, reports that when it comes to holidays even their
lordships aren't entitled to an even break.
BEYOND this place of wrath and tears looms the broad sunny uplands
where everyone strolls about wearing a red jersey. I was in the front
row below the foothills not so long ago when the Solicitor General
presented his commission. A fine sight the full bench of judges made.
I watched with terrible gravity as each one took his place exactly
like, if they will forgive the simile, a herd of well-trained dairy cows
coming into the byre, each hesitating a little and then finding its own
way to its own stall.
A little later after Donald MacKay had taken his seat within the bar
of the court they all got up and went out again in exactly the same way
they had come in. Somebody must have known what it was all about.
Whatever! It was an impressive performance if somewhat lacking in the
ingredients of great comedy, or tragedy, or purpose, or anything else at
all.
I wonder how much it all cost. When I put in my attendance fee to
Legal Aid they indignantly repudiated it. Still, it was a famous
occasion and it all looked good.
But looking good does not necessarily mean feeling good, and there are
rumours that the upland grazing is not as lush as it once was. Judges,
so it is said, do not have any contract of employment. It would make a
good exercise for any class of constitutional lawyers to devise one. I'd
like to try my hand at it myself, although Lord ******* might find my
clause on never interrupting cross-examinations too restrictive.
Their lordships' real gripe, I'm told, is that having no contract of
employment they have no holiday entitlement, none at all. After all,
back in 1532, when judges first came on the scene much as they are
today, being a judge was one big holiday, and with that conception the
law of judges is stuck fast.
This is probably the reason why so many judges have moved from the New
Town to addresses convenient and adjacent to the Edinburgh city by-pass
so that they can slip away without being seen and shouted on to come
back by the Principal Clerk of Session, who is their real boss and
employer.
Sources close to the broad sunny uplands do not have a good word to
say about the Principal Clerk of Session. These sources say he is a
slave-driver, little better than a rude foreman, a person who loves his
pound of flesh, one who has ''Value For Money'' tattooed across his
forehead.
On occasion, in Edinburgh, when a jury has retired to consider its
verdict, the judge immediately has the justiciary gown torn from his
back to be replaced by a civil one, and he is shoved incontinently into
another court to hear a few divorces until the verdict is returned. All
this happens before he has time to shout ''Keys'', or even utter the
mystic word ''Avizandum''.
In other and lesser spheres tradesmen used to fight against what they
called ''dilution''. Dilution took place when people less qualified than
the tradesmen were sent to do a tradesman's job. In our time we have
seen what happens when the very judiciary itself suffers dilution.
Temporary judges have arrived with all the powers of full-time ones.
It is noteworthy that while the temps have the same powers as their
full-time brothers they are not permitted to wear the same fancy gown.
No ermine for them. There is considerable speculation in the Parliament
House as to where they eat their lunch. Surely they are not permitted to
sit at the Lords' table. A jurisdiction which has two classes of judges
is bewildering not merely to the litigants but to the judges themselves.
What is the protocol? Does a temp judge lift his hat to a permanent one?
Where precedence is all you have, precedence becomes desperately
important.
All this compares very unfavourably with the days of yore when to be a
Lord of Session was to be someone of prime importance. Forty years ago
no circuit, including the Glasgow one, lasted more than a week. If it
did, harsh words were spoken to the depute. All of us, judges included,
made our livelihoods in 32 weeks of the year. The rest of the time we
retired to our country estates and shot grouse.
The exception was the junior Lord Ordinary who had to stay in town
over the summer vacation. He got all of September off as a compensation.
In those days the Lord Justice Clerk himself took the September circuit
in Glasgow, and took all the counsel in attendance home to his house
afterwards for a drink. It's a long time since I've had a drink from the
Lord Justice Clerk.
In the country towns, Aberdeen, Inverness, Dumfries, everything halted
while the judge inspected a guard of honour from the local regiment.
Nowadays all we have is a few gabbled words from the local minister, but
never the local priest. So much for ecumenicalism.
All this departure from the leisurely job of dispensing justice has
had its effect on the justiciary, particularly on circuit. There is no
longer pressure to get through the work as quickly as possible.
Edinburgh is the Stalingrad of the legal profession. The judge on
circuit now usually has a local connection, such as a nearby country
cottage.
Not so long ago Lord ******** sent his macer to the depute to say he
wouldn't mind if things stopped early. The depute therefore announced at
3.30pm that he had run out of witnesses.
''This is an absolutely outrageous waste of the court's time,'' roared
his Lordship at the depute, and we all looked smugly on. Forty minutes
later the two of them were sharing the same salmon pool on the Dee.
Down here the view of the mountain top is ever-changing. I'm not sure
that the view from up there is quite as good. Up there all the question
marks have been ironed out into exclamation marks, and people tend to
stare into space quite a bit, realising there's no escape. I don't envy
them their job.
Lawyers find it easier to talk than to listen. Indeed the only reason
for becoming a lawyer is because you like the sound of your own voice.
The upper slopes may be sunny, but they're supposed to be silent. For
any who have a hankering after the job I recall the old pilots'
crew-room saying: ''It's better to be down here wishing you were up
there, than up there wishing you were down here.''

Raymond Fraser recalls the case of the Borders farmer killed by a
lethal casserole concocted by his young wife.
THIS week the Court of Criminal Appeal is due to consider the case of
Dr Paul Agutter, serving 12 years for attempting to murder his wife by
spiking her gin and tonic with the deadly poison atropine.
Dubbed the ''Safeway Poisoner'', Agutter was also convicted of
contaminating a number of bottles of tonic on the shelves of an
Edinburgh supermarket.
By coincidence, Agutter's conviction in February this year marked the
twentieth anniversary of another celebrated poisoning trial.
The accused in that case was Anne Marie Lindsay, who faced a charge of
murdering her husband, Peter, by lacing his casserole of stew with a
dash of gramoxone.
Anne Marie Farrell was born in London in 1952 but at the age of
two-and-a half emigrated to Australia where she grew up.
Peter Lindsay was six years older, one of four children born to
Borders farming stock and part of the Berwickshire county set --
refined, sophisticated and comfortably off.
He emigrated to Australia when he was 19 and when he first met Anne
Marie she was 13. They met again when she was 16, conducted something of
a whirlwind romance and were married the following year in Adelaide,
when Anne Marie was pregnant with her son-to-be. The boy was born in
1970.
In 1973 they had a second child, a daughter, and Peter Lindsay
returned to farm in the Borders at Foulden Hill, Aytoun, in
Berwickshire.
The marriage had not been a happy one. Anne Marie suffered from a
number of psychiatric conditions and had been treated in mental
hospitals, largely for depression and repeated suicide attempts. She
joined her husband in Berwickshire when she felt she had ''sorted
herself out''.
On July 4, 1974, Independence Day, Mrs Lindsay carried out an act
which was to guarantee her independence from her husband forever, but
shackled her own freedom for years to come.
On the evening of July 4, Peter returned from his toils on the farm to
sit down to his evening meal. He later complained that the stew had
tasted odd and blamed an excess of rosemary. As it turned out, an excess
of Anne Marie was the real cause. Eleven days later, Peter Lindsay was
dead -- poisoned by paraquat weedkiller in his stew.
Six months later, Ian Stewart QC (now Lord Allanbridge) and I beheld
our client -- 23 years old, attractive, intelligent (a member of Mensa)
and charming.
The trial began at the High Court in Jedburgh on January 6, 1975, with
Ranald Sutherland QC (now Lord Sutherland) prosecuting. He was an
extremely able and effective Advocate-depute, renowned for having taken
on the prosecution of mass murderer Peter Manuel when his senior, Gordon
Gillies QC, took ill during the trial in 1958.
He was nicknamed ''Speedy'' Sutherland because of his ability to cut
the frills and get straight to the point, and, true to form,
encapsulated the Crown case in two days.
It was based on circumstantial evidence, laced with peripheral
innuendo and two statements made by the accused which were contradictory
and, ultimately, damning.
Mrs Lindsay went into the witness box on the third day of the trial
and gave evidence all day, examined by a persuasive and extremely
effective Ian Stewart, whose capacity for ingenuous disbelief and
apparent misunderstanding masked an analytical brain, shrewdness and
single-mindedness.
Cross-examined by the Advocate-depute, Mrs Lindsay was little
discomfited. However, a number of factors mitigated against her.
She had written an essay about herself which was led in evidence,
describing herself as ''selfish, hard-hearted and mercenary''.
When Peter Lindsay was lying in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary with no hope
of recovery (although he did not know it) he was pointedly asked by the
senior attendant medical man whether there was a possibility of the
poisoning being other than accidental.
After a long pause the reply came: ''The thought had crossed my
mind.''
His mother gave evidence to the effect that in hospital her dying son
had said to her: ''What a stupid little wife to try to poison me.''
For the defence there was also the problem of the contradictory
statements: the first to a local CID officer, in which she blamed her
two-year-old daughter for bringing the paraquat into the kitchen from
the shed where it was normally kept.
Six weeks later, however, she gave another statement to a solicitor in
Newcastle in which she admitted bringing the container and contents into
the house herself for no explicable reason.
This was damning enough, but the critical factor was purely and simply
forensic.
This was not a trial where everything bar the kitchen sink had been
produced in the courtroom as part of the Crown case -- the kitchen sink
was there as well, and it was the sink that sank the sinking ship.
Dr Francis Fish, an extremely experienced and highly regarded forensic
scientist, gave evidence about the practicalities of the theory that the
paraquat could have got into the stew by accident.
A half-teaspoonful of paraquat was potentially lethal and Peter
Lindsay had ingested six to ten teaspoonfuls.
Dr Fish had simulated the pouring of the paraquat from the container
down the sink and established to his satisfaction that a normal careful
pouring would allow 1/250th of a teaspoonful to contaminate the stew.
A ''reckless'' pouring would allow five teaspoonfuls in the casserole
but at the cost of saturating the draining board, the side of the sink
unit and the floor.
Asked to repeat his experiment, he did. The casserole received its
five teaspoonfuls, the draining board, unit, floor and respective
clothing of Ian Stewart and myself the remainder.
On Thursday, January 9, the jury took 63 minutes to return with a
majority verdict of guilty of murder and Lord Robertson imposed the only
sentence available to him -- imprisonment for life.
Mrs Lindsay, who had gripped the rail of the dock, shook her head at
the verdict and wept. After the life sentence was handed down she swayed
and collapsed in the dock and two policewomen carried her unconscious
down the stairs to the cells.
A few points remain to be mentioned.
Before he expired, the victim gave a dying deposition to the local
sheriff. In it he indicated that he and his wife had read a newspaper
article about a case in England headlined: ''Lover gave wife paraquat
which killed husband.''
Mrs Lindsay was the principal beneficiary in her husband's will and
was to receive #13,000 from an insurance policy taken out on her
husband.
The gracious Mrs Lindsay had the courtesy to write a letter of thanks
to Ian Corbett, our instructing agent, thanking the three of us for
attempting to save her from life imprisonment. (Ten years earlier we
would have been fighting the death penalty).
Finally, Scots law showed once again its ability to deal with the
gravest of crimes with the minimum of fuss, bother and delay.
''Speedy'' Sutherland lived up to his nickname and we all left for
home on the fourth day of the trial.
Anne Marie Lindsay escorted from court during her trial for the murder
of her husband, poisoned by paraquat in a stew casserole. Her bid for
independence cost her her freedom.

Even by the incredible standards applied to great divas, Jessye Norman
is awesome. Not only in stature but also in the spirit which will
overwhelm her Glasgow audience tomorrow night, says Michael Tumelty.
THE season of divas draws to a close with the arrival of the Dark One.
Shrouded in mystique, emanating an awesome sense of dominance --
physical and spiritual -- Jessye Norman is about to take the stage of
Glasgow's Royal Concert Hall.
The story so far: we have had the chill, bleak uncommunicativeness
(until her encores) of Maria Ewing, who iced some of her audience to the
extent that they gave up and left. The cold one was followed by her
antithesis, Cecilia Bartoli: young, fresh, sparkling and ebullient,
every inch the artist and communicator, who won every heart in the hall
with one of the most sensational (and personable) performances ever
staged there.
And now the flagship arrives. Jessye Norman. The richest, most opulent
female voice on the planet. A voice oceanic in its depths, described
once as a ''dark continent'', with a dynamic range and radiant power of
expression that can scorch with the intensity of a laser, smoulder like
hot embers, or display the tenderness of a soft, seductive caress.
That sense of power suffuses her physical presence, too. There is
something noble and leonine about Jessye Norman. Everything about her is
writ large: her massive head, her gleaming teeth and huge smile; and
those unblinking eyes which register, it was once said, both ecstasy and
melancholy. She is the supreme black artist, fiercely proud, toweringly
independent, and coupling a radiant gregariousness with an impenetrably
solitary quality.
She will dismiss with a challenging flash from those ebony pools any
reference to her colour or size. ''Being big and black hasn't presented
any problems for me,'' she said to one questioner. ''Your size on the
outside has nothing to do with the size or quality of your voice.''
At the same time, she can be professionally realistic about her bulk
and -- according to legend -- send herself up. Unlike some large
sopranos, she has never undertaken roles which suggest a certain
waif-like fragility of their heroines, such as the emaciated Mimi in
Puccini's La Boheme. ''Heroines who die of consumption are not for me,''
said Norman. ''I simply don't look the part.''
And as for legend, the most famous story about Jessye Norman has to be
apocryphal, because it allegedly took place in almost every city in
which she has appeared, and in every circumstance involving a door: of a
hotel, a lift or even a train in Glasgow Central Station. Attempting
futilely to negotiate a head-on entrance to one or other of these doors,
Ms Norman was advised, delicately, by a well-wisher to try going in
sideways. ''Honey,'' drawled the big, black lady from the Deep South,
''there ain't no sideways.''
She has been subjected to maximum exposure, intense adulation, and
endless scrutiny: in 1989, dressed in a huge tricolour flag, she led
France's bicentenary celebrations by singing the Marseillaise at the Arc
de Triomphe; she has earned some of the longest ovations on record -- 47
minutes after a performance in Tokyo in 1985, and 55 minutes the
following year in Salzburg. And in the early eighties she was the
subject of Jean-Jacques Beneix's film Diva, about a young Parisian
postman who falls hopelessly in love with a black opera singer (a story
Norman confirmed was true).
And all the time she has kept a wall of mystique and privacy around
her, even in the face of controversy. Often accused of being the arch
prima donna, Jessye Norman has some of the most celebrated -- notorious
-- cancellations in the book. Never more so than in her
scandal-provoking withdrawal, without explanation and at the last
minute, from a performance in Chicago of Sir Michael Tippett's
Byzantium, with Sir Georg Solti and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.
Solti was so incensed he wanted to take Norman to court.
She has been dismissive of such incidents (and apparently curiously
contemptuous of her audiences -- one of which, at an Edinburgh Festival
concert in recent years, got fed up being kept waiting for her to
appear, and gave her the slow handclap before proceeding to adulate when
she finally made her entrance). ''We're talking about concerts, for
goodness sake,'' she said, ''not brain surgery and a surgeon who decides
he'd rather go out for dinner than operate.'' People, she is alleged to
have said, should realise that her personal needs were important.
Jessye Norman, 50 this September, was born to sing. Protected by her
middle-class parents -- mother a teacher, father an insurance broker --
from the worst excesses of racism and segregation in her home town of
Augusta, Georgia, Norman was brought up in an intensely musical family.
She was singing spirituals in the local Baptist church from the age of
four, and music -- from piano playing to impromptu performances of
extracts from Handel's Messiah -- permeated family activities.
She knew she wanted to be a singer from the age of nine, when she
inadvertently tuned in to a live radio broadcast from the New York
Metropolitan Opera and was swept away by what she heard. By 15 she was
singing at functions: ''I wish I had a dollar for every time I've had to
sing Climb Ev'ry Mountain,'' she said of those days.
Her singing teachers at university -- she first went to the Howard
University for black students, then Baltimore Conservatoire, and the
University of Michigan -- began to shape her voice from a natural
singing instrument into something more polished and refined. Especially
influential was the great French singer, Pierre Bernac, who locked her
into the importance of the word as opposed to the note -- something that
was to become a characteristic of her singing.
Her professional career was launched in Europe, not the States, after
she won an international singing competition in Munich in 1968. Within a
year she was back in Germany with contracts for recitals and a
three-year stint at the Deutshe Opera in Berlin. Italy followed, with
triumphant debuts in Rome, Florence, and -- climactically -- in Verdi's
Aida at La Scala, Milan.
Britain was next in the Norman conquest, where, in 1972 and just
turned 27, she stormed in rapid succession through festivals in
Aldeburgh and Edinburgh, a London Prom where she sang Verdi's Requiem,
and a sensational debut at Covent Garden in Berlioz's opera The Trojans.
Critics were stunned, writing ecstatically about her prodigious breath
control and her astonishing ability with words and notes.
Abruptly, in 1975, she withdrew from the operatic stage for five
years. She was, she said at the time, being pushed too fast. It was an
early sign of her stubbornness and independence. ''It was a hell of a
risk,'' she said. ''I might have disappeared. My voice was changing and
it needed time to develop. But I was considered difficult to deal with
because I said ''no'' so often.''
She has never taken her art with less than the utmost seriousness,
whether singing the spirituals that she claims as her heritage, or the
weightiest classical programme. (And the audience at her Glasgow concert
this week might note that there are no crowd-pleasers, lollipops, or
trivia, in her programme of songs by Berg, Wagner, Hugo Wolf, and
Poulenc.)
''Singing takes over your life,'' she has said. ''You have to be very
very sure it's what you want to do. This job begins at two in the
morning, when it is just you and the score and the books, and you are
trying to work out what in the world is going on. You have to have the
self-discipline to stay with it and do it.''
She has described herself as ''horribly self-critical -- the whole
performance replays in my head the moment I get home. The moment I'm in
bed and trying to get to sleep, on goes the tape.''
The great lady could probably rest assured of the reception she is
likely to receive in Scotland this week. And not just because, over the
years, she has been courted by a succession of Edinburgh Festival
directors. Since the early seventies, when she first appeared here, she
has had a special relationship with the country because of her fondness
for the late Sir Alexander Gibson, whom she considered a supreme
accompanist. They hit it off right away and worked together many times
over the decades.
When Norman was making a record of spirituals with the Royal
Philharmonic Orchestra she insisted on having Alex Gibson as conductor.
And when she agreed to make her flagship appearance in Glasgow with the
BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra during the city's celebrations as
European City of Culture in 1990, it was her one uncommitted week in the
season, and it was almost certainly the fact the Gibson was conducting
that drew her to the city.
It's possible that, for the Dark Goddess, her concert in Glasgow might
be just one stop on an international recital tour. For her loyal
Scottish fans, however, she'll almost certainly be coming home.

THIS exhibition of oil paintings by Joe Allen, who is Scottish by
birth but now lives in Germany, takes as its theme the idea of journeys,
described as ''real and imaginary''. For painters like Matisse and
Bonnard, both of whose work appear to have influenced Allen, the journey
to exotic places offered a kind of escapism from more mundane subjects,
and Allen continues that tradition, providing enigmatic and evocatively
entitled works of great fluency.
Rome Painting (1) a work of such joyful colour and half-remembered
shapes (green shutters closed against the fierce heat, a geranium), is a
tribute to hedonism but controlled and measured which is a sign of
Allen's maturity.
In Mountain Castello, as in other works, bits of wood have been
patched on to the surface of the painting as it has grown and developed
and this painting in particular makes use of black pigment with a great
confidence. The canvases are large, but seem to have been painted
rapidly; fresh oil paint is worked into an already wet surface creating
a sense of texture and richness.
The same confident painterliness is evident in the work of Fraser
Taylor, who trained at Glasgow School of Art. The juicy textures and
vestigal subjects are there too, as are the patched canvases and
suggestions of quiet pleasures.

IS figurative art an endangered species? According to graduates, many
art schools now seem to frown on it -- which must be wrong. Certainly
it's not done Jenny Saville any harm.
Dundee seems better at walking the tightrope of experimentation and
tradition. Here excellent life painting is a welcome sign that basic
skills are still valued, vide McGroarty's tiny intensely focused heads
framed by eloquent hands, Whyte's negro model, Rossevold's Viennese
elongations, McIntyre's nudes and Cook's portraits.
But there's still room for large-scale abstracts by Kay, Little,
Cordwell, and Lund while McAree's triptych would grace any boardroom.
McPhail's lyrical seascapes plus Schuerr and De Voys's landscapes
demonstrate a nice sensitivity.
Anatomical analysis led Hodges to an obsession with insects which he
presents in a novel way -- even painting on scalpels. Printmaking looks
good with students like Shotton, McIntee and Johnson using wax, latex,
and even suntan to extend boundaries. Hamilton's shelf installation is
excellent while Hansen ties Blackadderesque etching and watercolour
together.
The sculptors are an ambitious lot tackling log installations on
Tayport beach, canoe journeys across Scotland and rotting apples. Video
comes into its own in Spence's performance. The most memorable photos
come from Hutton while Mackenzie's tiles involve photography,
printmaking, and installation.

''WILL you love me when I'm old?'' asks Deborah. ''If you can manage
to look 18, yes,'' says her lover Danny. So many of the exchanges
between the characters in David Mamet's classic satire of the singles
scene are such perfect summations of the doomed dialogue between men and
women that you're certain to spend the 95 minutes of this production
blushing, wincing and nodding furiously with recognition. That's when
you're not laughing your socks off.
In a typically over-the-top production from the Arches Theatre
Company, Mamet's script is complemented by mimed mugging between scenes
and an hilariously appropriate soundtrack, which snatches tracks from
artists like Stevie Wonder and Diana Ross to offer snide exaggeration of
the onstage action. Pairing Marie Osmond's sugary Puppy Love with a
discussion on bestiality is a profanity which can only be applauded. And
it was.
It's an approach which can ride roughshed over the darker elements of
Mamet's work, and while Paul Riley's caricatured Bernie provided most of
the laughs he failed to adequately explore anything more than the
character's surface misogyny. William Leslie's Danny was more carefully
pitched, touching on the menace which lurked beneath his dullard
nice-guy personna.
The performances were below par in the opening scenes and the timing
somewhat sloppy, but Riley, Leslie and Tricia Reid (Deobrah) -- and the
magnificently sulky Morag Stark (Joan) -- soon gathered momentum,
rolling the narrative along with snappy confidence to the climactic
beach scene. Riley and Leslie played it like a male version of Viz's Two
Fat Slags, offering a crippling and hysterically funny indictment of the
male ego.

TWO years ago, Needham Chowdhry's passionate version of Lorca's Yerma
was one of the highlights of the 1993 London International Festival of
Theatre. A vivid orchestration of sight and sound and vibrant images, it
placed Yerma indelibly in the mainstream of debate about women's role in
India today. This year the same director is back in a musical adaptation
of Giraudoux's The Madwoman of Chaillot -- a somewhat harder
proposition. Can a production of a play in Punjabi of an out-of-fashion
dead French playwright have anything to offer us?
As so often with LIFT, the question is part of the challenge: what
LIFT continues to do so well after 13 years is rattle our preconceptions
of what a theatrical experience can be about. And here, at Watermans --
in a west London arts centre with a predominantly Asian audience -- it
becomes a rare and joyous interaction between performer and spectator,
of recognition, approbation and noisy comment.
Chowdhry's production, as always, is a feast on the eye and a glorious
celebration of communal energy -- a swaying, harmonious evocation of
traditional street life in a style that owes more than a touch to
Bollywood popular commercialism -- perhaps not coincidental since the
Mad Woman and in Ramanjit Kaur's seductive, heart-felt performance is a
warning against the forces of global greed and materialism. Chowdry also
uses the story for a virulent attack on the ''rich bitch'' syndrome,
casting actress Gick Grewal in the role of a money-grubbing corporate
president.

NOW don't get me wrong. I've nothing against white people. Indeed,
both my parents are white. And some of the greatest jazz musicians in
history have been white. Even some of the greatest jazz bands in history
have been white. (Okay, a few of the greatest jazz bands in history.)
But what we have with the Chicago-based Robert Mazurek Quintet is an
all-white revivalist band proporting to play one of the blackest styles
ever created: the funkified hard bop of the late 1950s and early 1960s,
the ''sound of badness'' as it was known at the time -- a steaming
ghetto brew of desanctified gospel fervour, greasy blues, bop harmonies,
racial pride, and extreme sexual urgency.
Skin tones aside, Mazurek's boys look the part. Sharp suits, sharp
haircuts and drinks on the bandstand. Musically they are more than
competent too. But, crucially, lack badness and the confidence to let
the music breathe. Mazurek's trumpet is aggressive enough but where are
the smears, bent notes, and half-valve effects with which Lee Morgan
defined hard bop?
Tenor saxophonist Eric Alexander is the most convincing soloist, on
Mazurek's Pretty Blue Butterfly giving a fair impersonation of Hank
Mobley. But like the other band members, he plays too many notes too
fast, barely leaving any space between phrases -- space for hard bop's
trademark atmosphere of looming menace to fester.
But there were some good moments. Mazurek shone on Stranger In
Paradise, his harmon mute enjoyably evoking Miles Davis circa the first
sextet, while Alexander gave a beautifully soulful reading of Darn That
Dream. Given time -- the musicians are still young -- and more attitude,
the band could yet deliver the goods.

THERE was a moment when I was out of here and back to my treasured
World Pacific Jazz Crusaders 45, or the Crusaders' Southern Comfort
album, or the Street Life single, but it was wise to stick around. This
wasn't just a new line-up with the old name, it was the first gig for
drummer Tony Saintjames, and there was a tentative feel about the first
couple of numbers -- bizarrely including a reading of Eleanor Rigby in
tribute to John Lennon.
But old values reasserted themselves, thanks to the two originals in
the band. Saxophonist Wilton Felder became more committed to the evening
around the time of his solo on the inevitable Street Life, and
trombonist Wayne Henderson was an irrepressible MC in jammies, baffies
and tartan-toorie bunnet. (The arrangement of the McCartney song as a
seventies cop-theme was doubtless similarly in tribute to Russell
Hunter, as one of the Lonely people.) The other star of the group was
Bobby Lyle on keyboards, energetically leaping from Steinway to
synthesiser from early on, especially on his solo feature of Billy
Strayhorn's Lush Life.
That was a highlight of the regrettable pic'n'mix aspect of the set,
which also included some dispensable, but sadly not ignorable, guitar
from a diminutive Italian chap, and Henderson's curious euphonium solo
of Loverman, with quotes from The Campdown Races. Personally, I could
have done without much of his rapping and cheerleading, but by the time
he performed his real party piece of one-note circular breathing on the
trombone there had been enough evidence of serious jazz-funk cooking
onstage to forgive just about anything.

THIS is politics Captain, but not as we know it. With more than 100 of
his very honourable friends unwilling to back him but the rest unwilling
to sack him, the Vulcan has left Major in the twilight zone. The Tory
Party is willing to wound but unwilling to strike what would have been a
fatal and humane blow.
The Prime Minister has come to resemble one of these Egyptian mummies
in an old Hammer movie -- dead for a few thousand years but still
stumbling around trying to find the elixir which will restore the life
blood of his leadership.
Surprisingly to some, the Major memoirs might well be worth reading.
The Prime Minister's most human quality has always been his petulance.
If he had been born in Scotland and loved the beautiful game rather than
the boring one he would have spent a good part of his boyhood running
hame with his ba.
As a result I can see him paying off quite a few old scores when he
finally comes to write his autobiography. Given a waspish ghostwriter
with a sharp turn of phrase, Major's ''Downing Street Diaries'' may
wreck a few careers. There will be no shortage of people to blame. It
could all make for a very entertaining read -- Alan Clark minus the sex.
The diaries could start by revealing who advised him to put his crown
up for grabs in the first place. My initial theory that the announcement
in the rose garden was a response to the first French try against
Carling's cry- babies had to be discarded since the press notice was out
before the match started.
We know that the Sunday Times advised him that it was a great idea --
a chance to stamp his authority on his fractious party. Last Sunday the
same paper's editorial took the opportunity to stomp on the Prime
Minister instead.
However even John Major must know better than to believe what he reads
in the columns of those with power and no responsibility. Perhaps he
really did consult the President of the Board of Trade, who no doubt
told him that everything in his long experience of bringing down Prime
Ministers suggested that an immediate contest was the only thing to do.
Or perhaps he asked his old pal Ian Lang. Of course Lang and the rest
of the lads will call the result a great triumph. As I recall they said
the same thing about the Perth and Kinross by-election!
The fact is that whoever told Major to risk all gave him a bum steer.
The essence of successful gambling is to have a chance of winning.
Major's gamble cannot be successful. Not only did his critics put up. In
defeat, with 111 Tory MPs failing to back their own Prime Minister, they
will not shut up.
The test will come in the first difficult vote on a European issue.
Then many of the third of his parliamentary party who failed to back him
will head back into the anti-Europe trenches.
If they had been conspiring against him Major's campaign team could
not have produced a more disastrous start to his campaign. First they
briefed that the Cabinet and the 22 Committee were all behind him when
in fact they weren't.
The next line being spun was that Major was really the ''stop
Heseltine'' candidate. This piece of information was being fed to an
electorate with several dozen passionate devotees of the old loin cloth.
Perhaps a few Vulcans had been beamed into Cowley Street?
In some ways the most plausible explanation is that Major had simply
had enough and subconsciously has been looking for the honourable exit.
If that is the case then his victory yesterday will prolong rather than
finish the agony.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the leadership race has been
the failure of the Scottish media to seize the Scottish dimension in
this contest.
Aside from the obligatory ''putting a kilt'' on the story by covering
the parliamentary future of Bill Walker, Scottish journalists have
become immersed in 10 days of Westminster farce.
Fascinating though the Blairgowrie question undoubtedly is the future
whereabouts of Bill's kilt is not the Scottish substance to this story.
The issue is not the candidates but the process. How can we arrive at
a position where Scotland's Prime Minister and the gift of the Secretary
of State is decided by 329 people, the bulk of whom are exceptional only
for their ignorance of our country.
It was Keynes who noted (about capitalism) that it was the
extraordinary belief that the nastiest of men working for the basest of
motives would somehow operate to the benefit of us all.
Unionism is now the belief that 10 men representing around 10% of the
Scottish population and around 3% of the Tory leadership electorate are
entitled to exercise a choice that properly belongs to the whole nation.
I'm not sure once the scale of the anti-Major rebellion sinks in
whether we will have another Tory election with a new cast or whether
the mummy will just continue to wander around the set bumping into
things.
What I am sure about is that this is no way to run a country or to
allow our country to be run.

THAT'S the last time I stick up for Paula Yates. Why, only recently I
was defending her honour after a taxi driver called her a ''high-class
hooker''. ''What?'' I spluttered. ''In Glasgow, we've got a word for
women like her,'' he ranted, warming to his theme: ''Slag.''
Despite all my protestations that one extra-marital dalliance does not
a Divine Brown make, and that Ms Yates had, after all, been married to
Sir Bob for many years, from a very young age, the philosopher of the
road was adamant. ''All those men in her bed,'' he scorned, ignoring my
reasoning that that was only a television show.
But now Paula is a big disappointment to me, announcing that she is to
have laser surgery to remove the tattoo which has been as much her
trademark as peroxide locks and frothily monikered girl-children.
Jumping jellyfishes, what a spineless wimp. Before you can yell
''sell-out'' the erstwhile wild child will be combing her hair into a
slick bob, slipping silk blouses over her newly sanitised skin, and
presenting the Holiday show.
Yates is clearly reinventing herself for the new man in her life,
Michael Hutchence. Not content with metaphorically shedding skin by
ditching His Bobness, she also has to do so quite literally, calling
upon the St Georges' of dermatology to attack the dragon dancing down
her arm, thus proving that nothing is permanent in contemporary culture;
love, marriage or dabbities.
How pathetic. Like marriage, the whole point of tattoos is permanence.
You enter into the venture in a spirit of commitment, although, like
marriage, this is often inspired by misplaced bravado. But a tattoo is a
life marker, even if it marks a mistake. Implicit to the thrill of
getting one is the thought that, even if you choose to cover it up,
it'll still be there when you're slapped on the slab.
It should be as much a statement of your experiences as the ugly scar
on your knee caused by falling out of a tree when you were six or the
grey hairs caused by a particularly fractious relationship. The message
is accept yourself, albeit with the aid of long sleeves, long skirts and
a pack of Clairol.
If you do display your tattoo you become part of an in-crowd,
instantly bonding with other tattooed folk, who ask you in a matey way
where you got it done, and then show you theirs.
Recently, while collecting a parcel, the chap behind the counter asked
me the significance of the black and white Celtic knot tattoo at the top
of my arm. ''Umm, I thought it looked nice,'' I said, thus emphasising
my lack of allegiance to crusty causes. Without prompting, he rolled up
his sleeve to display a turquoise flying-saucery thing surrounded by
lettering. I nodded approvingly, but was baffled. ''I'm a Trekkie,'' he
explained.
The un-inked public also engage you in conversation. You can guarantee
that the first question will be ''Did it hurt?'' to which, unless you
are a professional masochist or your pride's too big for your own good,
the only answer is a resounding ''Yes''.
The second query will be, ''Do you ever regret it?'' This will be
asked with thrilled curiosity by maiden aunt types and snarls of disgust
by macho men who reckon women with tattoos are aberrations of nature on
a par with females drinking pints.
Perhaps Hutchence, who hails from the machismo culture of Australia
and who had previously shown a penchant for the most girlie of girls,
the Supermodel, was not turned on by Paula's tattoo. Prince Charles, on
the other hand, had his attention caught by a woman with a tattoo on a
recent walkabout and one can imagine that quintessential Englishman Hugh
Grant finding tattoos fascinating in a ''gosh, how jolly interesting''
fashion.
I've lost count of the times I've had to justify myself to people who
don't even know me, patiently explaining to a middle-aged matron in the
doctor's waiting-room that it won't spoil my wedding day because (a) I
have no plans to get married, and (b) if I did it probably wouldn't be
in an off-the-shoulder Scarlett O'Hara number, and (c) even if I did
that, so what? A glimpse of tattoo surely wouldn't scare off the vicar.
A former lover was appalled and convinced I'd live to rue the day.
''What if you have to go to a very posh ball?'' he protested. I pointed
out that my social calendar did not brim over with invitations to very
posh balls. ''What if you end up married to a businessman and he's too
embarrassed to take you to the works' do?'' he smirked. My tattoo would
be an insurance policy against such a horrific eventuality, I retorted.
I reason that the kind of guy who would want to usher me to the
nearest laser surgeon would be the kind of guy I'd want to usher to the
nearest exit. It's a love me, love my tattoo philosophy which Paula
would do well to heed. She should reflect that tattoos are not just for
Christmas. Moi, je ne regrette rien. Yet.

JOHN STEPHEN asserts that the Sheehy Inquiry report was a good thing
and was not implemented because of ''rejection by the police'' (June
29).
Far from being a possible benefit to policing in the United Kingdom
the Sheehy recommendations if implemented would have forever altered the
unique style of British policing.
The police service would have lost its political independence, been
governed entirely by an obsession with scoring performance points in
order to maintain salary levels, have suffered greatly from low morale,
experienced redundancies in its most experienced ranks, seen its salary
levels substantially reduced below the present ones, and have seen the
reintroduction of a local negotiated pay scale varying from force to
force.
Most importantly the service would no longer be subject to the unique
accountability on a local level which the British police have long
acknowledged as the bedrock of our system.
Space prevents me from addressing all the points put forward by
Sheehy's misguided inquiry team. Suffice to say that there were no good
ideas in the whole report.
As to the report not being implemented because of ''rejection by the
police,'' words almost fail me. Either Mr Stephen was on another planet
during the campaign of opposition to Sheehy in 1993 or he is
deliberately trying to mislead your readers.
The police service has never had either the muscle or influence to
cause an elected Government determined to implement reforms to change
path.
Mere rejection by the police did not lead to the shelving of Sheehy.
That came about because of the loud opposition of MPs of all parties,
municipal councillors, community councils, church leaders, umbrella
groups such as Cosla, trade unions, and most pertinently ordinary
members of the public.
They saw the Sheehy report for what is really was, a harbinger of the
end of traditional policing in these islands, and a real threat to
democracy. What a pity Mr Stephen has not their collective vision.

THREE people were arrested in the Air and Space Museum here on Sunday
for throwing blood and ashes (they said it was blood) on the fuselage of
the Enola Gay. That was the B-29 bomber that dropped the atom bomb on
Hiroshima. It has been lovingly restored, and the front third of it put
on show to mark the fiftieth anniversary of that most contentious event,
on August 6.
The commander of the special Air Force unit that dropped the two bombs
was Paul Tibbets. He flew the Enola Gay himself -- and named it after
his mother. He is retired now, living in Ohio, and has no regrets.
Hiroshima was a military target, and using the bomb ended the war and
saved thousands of lives, American and Japanese. That accounting is
hotly disputed.
A second bomb was dropped on Nagasaki three days later. Its pilot,
Charles Sweeney (his plane was called Box Car), is as unrepentant as
Tibbets. About 80,000 people were killed at Hiroshima, 70,000 at
Nagasaki. Radiation sickness killed many more over the years.
The exhibition at the Air and Space Museum, the most popular museum in
America, has provoked much heat and passion since it was first discussed
last year. The demonstrators arrested on Monday carried on the debate by
other means. Witnesses said that they suddenly started chanting, ''We
regret, we repent,'' and poured a red liquid under the plane and cast
ashes into the air.
Originally, the exhibition was to include photographs and graphics
illustrating the horror of the atomic attack, with explanatory text
stating that the Americans were conducting a racist war of vengeance
against Japan, whose soldiers were bravely defending the fatherland
against colonialist oppression.
Furthermore, in this view, Japan was clearly ready to surrender when
the bombs were dropped; President Truman ordered the attacks, anyway,
partly to justify the huge sums that had been spent developing the two
types of bomb, partly to frighten off the Soviet Union, which was
already perceived as the enemy.
This rather one-sided view of history, which is now the received
wisdom in many American universities, was hotly challenged by veterans'
groups and members of Congress. The Smithsonian Institution (of which
the Air and Space Museum is a subsidiary), tried amending the
exhibition's script to modify its super-revisionism.
There were long negotiations between the institution and
representatives of the American Legion and members of Congress (who
reminded the Smithsonian that it survives on public funds). They said
public money should not be spent proclaiming that the US had waged an
evil war.
The revisionists compared that attitude to Japan's continued refusal
to admit any war guilt, and said that it was time that America faced up
to its history. The debate finally boiled down to the question of how
many casualties would have been lost if the Americans had not dropped
the bomb, but had invaded the home islands instead.
That over-simplification was probably inevitable, but it lost the
argument for the revisionists. It is altogether too much to conduct a
public debate using ''on the one hand and on the other hand'' arguments
about which factions in the Japanese armed forces were in the ascendant,
those who wanted to fight to the death or those who recognised that the
war was lost; how to win the war without allowing Stalin to share in the
occupation of Japan (there are some American historians who claim that
trying to prevent that was an illegitimate exercise of American
discretion); and how much fight was left in the Japanese army.
For several decades, revealed wisdom was that invading Japan would
have cost 1,000,000 American casualties. The revisionists said this was
nonsense, that the million figure had no real historical basis, and that
in fact American planners counted on no more than 250,000 casualties.
The original exhibition script proposed the curiously exact figure of
229,000 casualties but at the last moment, one of its panel of
historians, Barton Bernstein of Stanford University, California, revised
the figure down drastically to 63,000, of whom about a fifth would be
killed.
The revisionist argument was that Truman ordered 150,000 Japanese
killed to save the lives of about 20,000 Americans -- proof positive
that it was pure racism to drop the bomb. This was too much for everyone
concerned. The museum's director resigned and the script was scrapped
altogether: the exhibition, which opened last month, consists of the
plane's fuselage and various other artefacts, and nothing more.
Bernstein and his supporters denounce the Smithsonian for McCarthyism
and capitulating to political pressure from the right.
Their own extremism, fortunately, is blatant enough to answer that
one. If they had argued that a less-populated target than Hiroshima
should have been chosen, or that the Nagasaki bomb was quite
unwarranted, or that a last ultimatum should have been sent before the
bomb was used, they might have had a case.
But to say that conquering Japan would have cost only 63,000 American
casualties is patently ludicrous. Capturing Okinawa in June 1945, cost
the Americans 80,000 casualties, including 12,000 killed, and that was
just a garrison island far to the south of the sacred homeland.
Perhaps a million is too many -- but the final issue is that no
American President would hesitate to use a weapon guaranteed to end the
war when the alternative was many tens of thousands of American dead.
That's the way wars are fought, and this was a war that Japan began.
Sunday's demonstrators, however, were not concerned with these
abstruse debates. They contend, instead, that the atomic bomb itself is
and always will be evil.

THE report of the Government's intention to introduce certificates of
criminality for job seekers carried the comment from Mr Alan Miller,
Chairman of the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties, that it was hard
to see the reasoning behind this move (July 3).
On Sunday the Observer, reporting on the subject, said: ''Mr Michael
Howard, the Home Secretary, sees the White Paper as a key element in
reviving Conservative fortunes.''
The fact is that the present Rehabilitation of Offenders Act does
protect the public from the hardened criminal, yet offers a real
opportunity to thousands of ''one-off'' offenders to rehabilitate.
Spent convictions of minor offenders must remain just that -- spent,
and not to be resurrected to haunt them for the rest of their working
lives.
The poor, the sick, the elderly, the disabled, and the unemployed, to
name but a few groups, have all been victims of this mean-spirited and
spiteful Government. Rehabilitated ex-offenders can now be added to this
list.
There would appear to be no limit to the suffering which this Tory
Government will inflict on the vulnerable members of the community in
order to maintain their hold on power.
The only aspect more worrying than their malicious philosophy is that
there appear to be voters to whom their creed still appeals.

DOES David Rowan Henderson (July 1) really believe -- or expect Herald
readers to believe -- that the imprisonment (until this morning -- July
3) of Private Lee Clegg represented one of the ''grossest miscarriages
of justice since Alfred Dreyfus was wrongfully stimatised and
transported to Devil's Island''?
I think Mr Henderson's hyperbole gets the better of him.
With the serried ranks of the British establishment campaigning for
him, it was inevitable that Private Clegg would be released in next to
no time. Of course, that his release should take place on the morning
before the Tory leadership election will, no doubt, be purely
coincidental, will it not?
I have little doubt that Private Clegg will now be thanking God that
he is British. Thanking God because if he was Irish, like the Maguires,
the Guildford Four, or the Birmingham Six, he would not have had the
Telegraph, Daily Mail, or that other well-known campaigner against
injustice, the Sun, fighting his corner for him. Nor would there have
been deputations of old soldiers handing in petitions to 10 Downing
Street calling for his immediate release.
But when was justice, or equality of any kind, ever extended to
nationalists from the North of Ireland?
There has to be a peace dividend in the form of early prisoner release
in the North of Ireland. Conflict resolution, and agreement and
reconciliation among all of the Irish people, as well as between the
peoples of Britain and Ireland, require that all parties involved in
what is becoming an increasingly unstable peace process need to feel
that their hopes and fears are being taken on board.
Just as there will have to be some form of amnesty for Republican and
Loyalist prisoners, so this process must also include the odd British
soldier -- though anyone who seriously follows Irish political and
historical affairs will recognise that British soldiers have had a de
facto amnesty since 1969, 1921, 1867, or however far back you want to
go, in connection with the conflict in Ireland.
Perhaps it is the breach of this de facto amnesty, inherent in the
imprisonment of Private Clegg, that really angers Mr Henderson.

THE fact that hundreds of villagers turned out on a baking hot day, in
the middle of a working week, as reported in The Herald on June 28,
demonstrated just how high feelings had reached about the traffic
problem in Eaglesham, and is a warning shot across the bows of those who
have the responsibility for dealing with this blight on the community.
Irrespective of the rights or wrongs of the Brent Spar conflict
between Greenpeace and Shell, it is clear that environmental issues are
a major concern and those who ignore obvious signs of unrest in this
respect do so at their peril.
In the past 12 months we have seen villagers in England cause major
disruption to traffic carrying cattle in inhumane conditions to Channel
ports and it is not at all inconceivable that unless the situation in
Eaglesham improves radically the authorities could have a similar
problem to deal with.
The demonstration was the first part of a campaign to heighten
awareness of the problem and to make it plain that the villagers are no
longer prepared to be pushed around -- in anyone's book 30 years is a
long period for a series of promises to remain unfulfilled.
Meantime, while we wait for positive action in respect of the
long-overdue by-pass, those who pass through the village should be aware
of the fact that the campaign will focus on reducing the noise,
pollution, and danger which means forcing the traffic, one way or
another, to abide by the 30mph speed restriction which is blatantly and
consistently ignored.

Nic Outterside examines how an ambitious leisure project could secure
the future of the troubled Glasgow Zoo and be a model for others around
the world.
APIONEERING #20m project to turn Glasgow Zoo into a leading visitor
attraction and provide a financial lifeline to the loss-making amenity
was launched yesterday.
The scheme, backed by a consortium of architects and planners, aims to
revamp the 100-acre site on the eastern approach to the city to provide
an 8000-seat sports stadium, restaurant, travel lodge and other leisure
facilities as well as an interpretative visitor centre and open-plan
zoo.
The redevelopment of the zoo will include open-scape tiger, lion,
cheetah and primate compounds, new houses for reptiles and insects, and
a multi-purpose education and information centre.
The zoo itself will move to different land within the site with
viewing platforms and tunnels since the animals will no longer be caged.
The team behind the popularly named Glasgow Ark yesterday applied to
Glasgow and Motherwell district councils for outline planning permission
for redevelopment of the site, including reclamation of 30 acres of
derelict land which could be used for an indoor ski dome complete with
artificial snow.
Mr David Sellyn, the managing director of PLC, leading consultants to
the project, said: ''The need to upgrade the facilities at Glasgow Zoo
is obvious to most people.
''We wish to create an open environment for the animals and, secondly,
to create a modern education and information centre which will meet all
the expectations of our visitors.
''If our application is successful we will sell part of the land for
the leisure and service station developments. This income, together with
financial support from the Millennium Fund, will enable the Glasgow Ark
to implement this major restructuring programme.''
The consortium, which also includes Alex Gordon Tweedale, planning
consultants, and the Babtie Group of engineers, says funding for the
development will come from private and public sectors.
The cost of the redevelopment of the zoo facilities is projected to be
about #4m.
The cost of the community area, sports facilities and the petrol
station with drive-through restaurant will account for the #16m balance.
If the project gets the go-ahead, it will mean the zoo will survive
despite 20 years of running at a loss. Earlier this year the zoo faced
closure because of mounting losses. It owed #1.9m to the Royal Bank of
Scotland.
Yesterday Mr Sellyn promised a new start for the zoo, which was
established in 1947.
''If this project doesn't take place, it will mean a continued
hand-to-mouth existence. This is the way forward for the zoo,'' he
added.
Mr Sellyn said the consortium hoped to get #1.75m from the Millennium
Fund.
Zoo director Mr Richard O'Grady insisted: ''This is not pie in the
sky. This is a modest, fundable development based on our strengths and
avoiding our weaknesses.''
The zoo has become outdated in its present form and, kept open
throughout the year, has run at a loss for eight out of the 12 months.
Mr O'Grady said he had seen families trudge through nine inches of snow
to see the animals.
With the West of Scotland's poor climate, there was now a desperate
need to attract visitors to the zoo by putting more facilities indoors
and offering a modern package of leisure activities ranging from
basketball, football and tennis to a drive-in restaurant and even a
petrol station.
The number of full-time jobs at the zoo is likely to remain at about
18, but the leisure facilities will create up to 200 new jobs.
The zoo attracts 140,000 visitors a year, although the new scheme
would only need to draw in an extra 20,000 to be financially viable. The
aim is to attract about 200,000.
Mr O'Grady admitted: ''I am looking forward to the day when the zoo is
financed from profits, not from loans.''

THE concern of your correspondent Mrs C Maxwell (July 3) for those
''who feel genuinely called to the ministry'' is shared by the Church of
Scotland's Committee on Education for the Ministry which selects and
trains candidates.
There are however many ways for a person to be called to serve Christ
in the Church and express faith and dedication. Those who select
candidates for the ministry are assessing for a specific role within the
Church which needs other gifts in addition to a sense of call, a sincere
faith, and dedication if a ministry is to be sustained over the years in
a Church and a society which are undergoing change.
Mrs Maxwell refers to three different opportunities for selection ''in
their years of study at divinity college''. It would be the committee's
recommendation to applicants not to begin study in divinity before
knowing that the Church has accepted them for the ministry, especially
when an applicant has a family to support and is in paid employment.
Applicants who are not accepted are offered a counsellor (not a coach)
with whom they can talk over the experience and reflect on their call,
their gifts, and their suitability for the ordained ministry.
In 1990 a report to the General Assembly outlined the basic tasks of
the ordained ministry. There is no secrecy about what the work involves
and assessors try to ensure that those who are selected will, after
training, be able to do it satisfactorily.
Those who come with academic theological training largely behind them
or with considerable experience of life are expected to show that they
have benefited from such experience. Experience itself is not enough;
growth has to be seen to have resulted from it.
Assessors are nominated by presbyteries throughout Scotland and their
names are brought to the General Assembly before appointment. It is made
quite clear to applicants at any Selection School who will be
interviewing them and whether these Church assessors are ministers or
members of the Church who serve in a different role. There is no
question of assessors, men and women, being ''in mufti'' and concealing
their identity.
Mrs Maxwell can be reassured that ''new blood'' is being introduced
each year to the ministry with the acceptance of good candidates,
including committed and able young people.

ALASDAIR CAMERON'S concern that an independent Scotland would be
dominated by the West and Central Belt is surely somewhat ill-founded
(June 27).
This is especially so with all political parties in Scotland, bar the
Tories, for the present at least, agreeing in principle to a post
independent Scottish system of PR, both at governmental and local level,
being implemented.
If Mr Cameron is so concerned at the lack of real
democracy-cum-accountability in Scotland, then he really should refer
back to the origins of the ''devil he knows''.
This is, of course, the heinous coerced Act of Union of Parliaments of
1707.

MR Major has won his electoral gamble comfortably if not decisively,
certainly with a margin sufficient to rule out a second ballot from
necessity or from any personal calculation that he might have been badly
enough wounded to render going on impossible, despite the raw
statistics. In many respects little has changed, except that it is now
clear that although actual snipers may have been few in number, their
supporters were more substantial than the handful he previously sought
to suggest. Mr Redwood's support was large enough to be considered
serious, and the relatively small number of abstainers shows how
severely opinion was squeezed. The Prime Minister's camp will want to
talk up his victory -- they have already been doing so -- but the fact
is that everything now depends on how the right interpret the outcome
and how Mr Major himself responds to the opportunity to reconstruct his
Government, something which will become clearer today when he makes his
new, and confirms existing, appointments. It will pay him to be bold,
but it looks as if he has already lost his first and most important
battle: to persuade Mr Heseltine to be party chairman. His choices are
crucial; his new Cabinet will be the one that carries him through the
coming General Election.
Preliminary statements suggest that the defeated camp will not sulk,
but will accept the outcome and react positively to calls for unity,
though some Euro-sceptics said that their scepticism and their
willingness to articulate it will not be banished by yesterday's vote.
Much depends on their tone and how far they exercise restraint. One
possible Tory benefit from the outcome is that the Euro-sceptics may
indeed moderate their behaviour which has undoubtedly been damaging to
their party. If some of them supported Mr Major to ensure that Mr
Heseltine was kept at bay, the same logic ought to ensure their
commitment to unity now, lest their antics simply benefit Labour.
The outcome was the best for the Tories themselves and for the
country. Mr Major's defeat -- and it need not have been because he
failed to get a majority but because it was insufficient -- would have
opened up more weeks of intense internal bickering. The frantic activity
just passed has shown how unattractive that prospect would have been.
But Mr Major's defeat would have swung the Tories to the right, not a
desirable position; and had that been confirmed in the subsequent
ballots, and Mr Heseltine been rejected for Mr Portillo, it would not
have been desirable for Britain.
In some ways the outcome was puzzling; opinion surveys suggest that Mr
Heseltine would save more Tory MPs from defeat in an early General
Election, but Mr Major proved to be, as he did in 1992, a solid
campaigner and a vote-getter. He should not be dismissed as a poor
electioneer, yet it is hard to see the policies he can advance to stave
off Labour's victory whenever the election is called. Labour is bound to
be more vulnerable as it moves to put flesh on the bones of its vague
policy positions, for then there will be every opportunity to attack
specifically and, above all, to cost them and relate them to the
existing revenue base. The Tories have proved adept at this exercise in
the past, but experience since 1992 has left them exposed to the charges
of broken promises and financial as well as economic incompetence.
No matter the changes in personnel he introduces he cannot hope to
avoid problems over Europe: his party has been tearing itself apart on
hypothetical questions which are still some way off and where Mr Major's
own positions are both intelligent and reasonable. No matter what he
does, the divide over Europe will remain. It remains a sore point but it
could be ignored rather than constantly scratched. Interestingly enough,
it is more the outcome of doubts about Europe -- the civil war in the
party -- than its substance which worries the general public, which,
according to one opinion poll, rates it ninth in a list of important
issues. As always, more mundane matters of concern, like jobs, health
care and housing, loom far higher in the public mind. Europe may still
be perceived as a foreign policy matter which does not merit priority in
British minds. That ought to change, but it looks like being a slow
process.
Of course the continuing improvement in the economy, for all that it
is slowing, may come to the Prime Minister's aid. The drawback is that
all the improvement is going into exports and not into wage packets.
That may be the right priority -- it certainly is from the wider public
interest -- but it reduces the chance of people feeling better off,
something also postponed by the continuing slide in house prices. The
only thing Mr Major can do is reduce income taxes as soon as possible.
Can he carry Mr Clarke with that when public borrowing remains so
obstinately high? Even if he did, would that not drive a horse and cart
through all the protestations about cutting tax only when it was prudent
to do so? How can cuts be justified now, when the budget will be far
from balanced?
The Tories cannot expect anything but the most cynical scrutiny of
pre-electoral tax cuts when the experience of the aftermath of 1992 has
proved to be so painful and long-lasting. Even moves to help the housing
market will seem self-interested, especially when much of the suffering
derives from specific Government policies, such as reducing mortgage
interest relief, whose political consequences were almost certainly
underestimated if they were not actually ignored.
That leaves the Prime Minister in a position which admittedly suits
his temperament but deprives him of initiatives, waiting on events. He
has always been reminiscent of Mr Micawber, reacting to what turns up
rather than shaping things in a manner consonant with his own ideas.
This may ensure his classification as a pragmatic politician who can
apply commonsense and reason (and Mr Major is a reasonable man) to new
situations as they develop. It can equally expose him as a ditherer,
with no more compelling public role than hanging on to power for himself
and his friends. The gamble which has just come off reminds us of his
other dimensions of courage and boldness. He will need these qualities
again.

thought the evening was wonderful, as did the rest of the audience. The

I certainly don't feel one has to see the movie to appreciate the

Roy Rogers examines the reality behind an 'amazing' year's trading by
British Rail.
ON the face of it, British Rail achieved an amazing group profit of
#362m in 1994 despite the effects of last summer's signal workers'
dispute and paying interest charges of #106m.
But little can be taken at face value in the fast-changing rail
industry which is in a state of metamorphosis on the road to
privatisation.
In fact, trading income of #2944m was #156m down on the previous year,
with total passenger journeys 11 million fewer, at 702 million, and
freight business declining six million tonnes to 97 million tonnes.
And BR chairman John Welsby, now facing another summer of strikes,
warned: ''Investment in the existing railway is not at a satisfactory
level and will not sustain the industry in the long term.''
Shadow Transport Secretary Michael Meacher accused BR of engaging in
some creative accountancy while passengers have had to put up with the
biggest fall in investment since the war.
BR's declared profit reflected new financial flows caused by the
fundamental pre-privatisation restructuring exercise and a virtual
doubling of grants from central and local government -- denounced by
Labour transport spokesman Henry McLeish as ''an extra #1000m subsidy
for the railways used 'to pay the additional costs created by the
Government's artificial market'.''
These results were the first to be published after the reorganisation
of BR ahead of privatisation, which saw Railtrack take responsibility
for infrastructure from April 1, 1994, and other separate
Government-owned companies, European Passenger Services and Union
Railways, set up to operate the cross-Channel services and build and
operate the Channel Tunnel rail link.
In addition, within BR more than 70 business units were created with
responsibility for train operations, rolling stock, and the many other
services needed to sustain the railway industry.
Each business unit now charges prices calculated to enable it to be a
self-sustaining commercial company, earning profits to fund reinvestment
in assets and provide a return for shareholders.
This huge restructuring has resulted in a completely different
financial regime for BR, with the Government paying much higher grants
and the declared costs and profits of the different parts of the
railways far higher than before.
Operating profits of #571m were due mainly to the #450m profit made by
the three train-leasing companies which, for the time being, remain with
BR.
A further example of how the restructuring has distorted figures and
made comparisons impossible becomes evident when the 1993-94 BR-declared
loss of #108.4m on an operating profit of #23m is set beside the 1994-95
profit figures of #362m and #571m respectively.
BR emphasised in its report that the latest figures ''cannot be
compared in any meaningful way with those reported by the (BR) board
over the past years''.
Mr Welsby's remarks on investment, however, are far more relevant. In
his chairman's statement in the annual report, which reveals that BR
invested #300m in the industry last year, he said: ''Mechanisms need to
be put in place which will permit major investment programmes to be
undertaken well into the next century.''
He said these would need to involve all the key figures in the new
industry regime, adding: ''It is important that fragmentation is not
allowed to become an obstacle to worthwhile investment.''
The industry needed to work together to achieve this aim and to ensure
continuous improvement of quality across the whole railway.''
The immediate impact of last summer's strikes was an estimated #173m
loss of overall revenue, of which #153m was lost to the passenger
business.
However, BR got a #140m track charge rebate from Railtrack and taking
everything into account, the loss to the whole passenger business
amounted to about #16m.
But the strike, involving one and two-day stoppages from June to
September, caused total passenger miles for the year to decline from
18.9 billion to 17.8 billion.
And now for the good news.
* Camelon, on the Edinburgh to Falkirk line, was one of 17 new
stations opened last year and the 50th to be opened in Scotland in the
past 10 years.
* Passenger fatalities resulting from falls from trains were down to
seven last year, from a peak of 24 four years earlier, as fitting of
central locking systems on InterCity services nears completion.
* Reported crime on the railways fell by 7.1% in England and Wales and
7.7% in Scotland last year.

Bert Hardy's pictures from around the world are classics of
photo-journalism, but his Glasgow shots were favourites, says William
Hunter.
OLD Glasgow did no mean number of favours to photographer Bert Hardy,
who died on Monday, and had all of them returned.
His pictures showed the harsh optimism and the struggle for decency of
Gorbals people after the Hitler war. With his camera, he refocused the
stereotype image that the city's southside was populated only by gangs
and drunks.
Gorbals saw him as a nosey visitor, but one who knew what it was like
to be poor. They accepted him. Slum doors opened. ''Nobody took much
notice when I started taking photos,'' Bert Hardy said later.
His assignment was to complete a series of conventional pictures of
urban misery taken earlier by a colleague on Picture Post magazine.
Hardy was handed the job of capturing the human side of poverty.
He took shots of ragged kids using a graveyard for a playground. A big
wifie bathed her body from a basin on the kitchen table. Most memorable
was the street scene with the two scallywag pals, all dirty skint knees
and strong cheeky faces, who took the photographer back to his own poor
London boyhood. ''My favourite picture,'' he said.
''This reminds me of what I was like when I was a kid. In this story I
concentrated on the children, and how they kept their spirits up in
conditions which were often dreadful,'' he recalled in his memoirs, My
Life.
His Gorbals sequence in l948 won the first Encyclopaedia Britannica
Award.
Bert Hardy's first job was as messenger boy on a bike for a photo
agency. When he heard that newspaper photographers were rumoured to earn
as much as #5 a week, he saved up for a secondhand glass-plate camera.
He taught himself to use it.
He liked to say: ''I doesn't matter what sort of camera you have. It's
the person behind the camera that matters.''
For a bet, using only a box Brownie, he did a series of Blackpool
snaps for his magazine that included a picture of two young women on the
promenade railing with their skirts swirling in the sea breezes; it
remains a holiday classic.
Other enduring work was done during the Blitz of London, the relief of
Paris, the crossing of the Rhine, and the Korean war.
He was the first Picture Post photographer to have his name put on his
pictures. To his scenes of wartime firemen fighting bomb blazes the
magazine (it died in l957) inserted the caption: ''From our rule of
anonymity we except these pictures. They were taken by A Hardy, one of
our cameramen.''
Bert Hardy hung up his camera in l965. In a small way in Surrey he
became a farmer, which he knew as much about as he had of starting
photography.
He died after a heart attack on the way to keep an optician's
appointment. He was 82.

Lynne Robertson and Raymond Duncan examine the controversy over the
cost of providing a new building for Scottish Office staff.
VICTORIA Quay, the Scottish Office's new #47m home in the Port of
Leith, was always going to attract criticism before its doors had even
opened because of the amount of money being spent on it.
Only days before the reins of control of the new building pass into
the hands of the Government, Scots politicians yesterday launched a
scathing attack on the project costs.
Criticism has already been levelled at the apparently plush fixtures
and fittings -- including a #36,000 reception desk and specially
commissioned artworks costing thousands of pounds -- for the new
offices. The costs of a floor-tile design, tapestry, and a glass screen
have also come under fire.
However, trade unions representing the 1500 staff who will work there
said after a tour of the building yesterday that they were impressed
with the facilities and conditions in which staff will work.
Labour home affairs spokesman John McFall branded the building, with a
creche and swimming pool among the facilities, as one that ''smacked of
privilege''. He said the #14m cost to fit it out was scandalous.
Leith MP Malcolm Chisholm said: ''While I am pleased the Scottish
Office has come to Leith there is clearly some expenditure which has to
be looked at by the Public Accounts Committee.''
SLD Scottish chair Marilyne MacLaren, also an Edinburgh councillor,
said: ''From a Government that preaches the virtues of efficiency this
kind of excess sticks in the throat. While offices should be fitted out
to modern standards, the #14m cost does seem extravagant. The Scottish
Office must explain why this costs so much.''
However, Mr John Moffat, chairman of the Scottish Office trade union
side, one of nine officials on yesterday's tour, defended the cost. He
said the delegation had been impressed. The facilities were great in
terms of health and safety aspects for staff.
''It is a standing asset for the Government which is unlikely to lose
its value. If anything, its price is going to increase considerably in a
short period.''
He added that many of the facilities, including swimming pool and
gymnasium, would be paid for by the staff who used them.
Mr Moffat criticised the existing accommodation at New St Andrew's
House, describing it as ''a complete eyesore'' with ventilation
problems. He believed the new building would enhance the quality of life
for workers, and indicated that talks were being held with Scottish
Office management about improved transport links for staff to reach
their new workplace more easily.
Mr Robin McKendrick, president of the Scottish Office group of the
National Union of Civil and Public Servants, was equally delighted.
He said New St Andrew's House was ''one of the worst buildings ever
worked in''. He questioned where some politicians wanted staff to work.
''Do they want us in hovels that do not meet health and safety
requirements?''
The building, which will be officially handed over to the Scottish
Office on July 14, will replace New St Andrew's House and offices in
Jeffrey Street and Brandon Street.
For the first time, staff from three major departments -- Environment,
Industry and Education -- along with central support groups, will be
housed under the one roof. They are expected to begin transferring to
the new headquarters in September.
Old St Andrew's House, at the heart of the capital, will remain the
mainstay and Scottish Office HQ north of the Border. Mr Lang and his
team of ministers will not be moving to Leith, but facilities will be
available for them within the new building when business takes them
there.
New St Andrew's House, opened in 1970, will revert to Property
Holdings, the management arm of the Department of the Environment.
It was the recent discovery of widespread asbestos throughout the
building that effectively gave the go-ahead for a new home for the
Scottish Office. The old building will be overhauled and prepared for a
new life in the office market. Architectural and engineering firm RMJM
Scotland -- designers of the award-winning Glasgow Royal Concert Hall --
were engaged to ensure an energy-efficient design which has attracted
praise from the Royal Fine Art Commission for Scotland and the Royal
Incorporation of Architects in Scotland.
A Scottish Office spokeswoman last night defended the costs of the
project: ''The new building -- constructed at a cost 20% below that for
similar projects in Edinburgh -- has been planned to obtain maximum
value for money for the taxpayer.
''The move to Leith is expected to save over #3m a year on the bill
for rental and other running costs.''
She added that the move was agreed following ''consideration of a
range of options'' after the asbestos problem was discovered at New St
Andrew's House.

Singapore, Tuesday
BRITON John Martin Scripps was remanded in solitary confinement in a
Singapore jail today -- charged with murdering a South African, whose
dismembered body was found in the island republic's harbour in March.
Scripps, 34, from Hertford, dubbed the ''tourist from hell'', said
nothing as the judge set September 4 for committal proceedings to go
ahead. A trial date has been set for September 25.
Wearing jeans and a batik floral-patterned shirt, Scripps sat head
bowed among 12 other prisoners in the caged dock at Singapore's
secondary court.
Meanwhile in Thailand, Major General Amarin Neimsakul, head of the
Thai police foreign affairs division, said proceedings were already in
hand to charge Scripps with the murders of two Canadians in Thailand in
early April.
Like South African chemical engineer Gerard Lowe, who had checked into
the hotel in Singapore with Scripps, Mrs Sheila Damude, 45, and her son
Darin, 21, checked into Nilly's Marina Inn on the Thai holiday island of
Phuket at the same time as Scripps. Their dismembered bodies were found
later in jungle undergrowth.
General Amarin said that if Scripps were found not guilty in
Singapore, where the death sentence for murder is mandatory, the Thai
authorities would apply to have him extradited.
The possibility seems unlikely, however. Singaporean authorities have
placed 13 other charges against him, including passport forgery, credit
card fraud, and carrying weapons with intent.
When Scripps was arrested under the name Simon Davis he allegedly had
in his possession knives, a garrotte, 10 pairs of handcuffs, and
thumbscrews.
He has also been named in connection with the disappearance of south
London financial adviser Timothy MacDowall in Mexico, where Scripps had
allegedly been attempting a reconciliation with an ex-wife.
Scripps's mother, Mrs Jean Scripps, 53, a former Fleet Street barmaid,
is distraught at her son's treatment in Singapore. ''What chance are
they giving him?'' she asked from a friend's house.
Mrs Scripps said she begged the authorities at the Mount Prison, Hemel
Hempstead, not to release him on home leave last October, as she feared
he was going to run.
Scripps has been jailed four times for burglary and drug dealing, but
never completed a sentence. On each occasion he quit the country while
on home leave.

New Delhi, Tuesday
THE Dalai Lama began three days of 60th birthday celebrations today
with a dawn prayer meeting in a New Delhi park dedicated to Lord Buddha.
The Tibetan god-king, seated on a yellow brocade prayer mat, led a
baritone chant by 40 monks in traditional maroon and saffron robes,
facing a large golden statue of the Buddha amid burning incense and the
clashing of cymbals.
After the 45-minute prayer session, the Dalai Lama planted a pipal
tree sapling in front of the statue. The Buddha is believed to have
attained enlightenment under a pipal tree.
The Dalai Lama's birthday falls on July 6 but is being commemorated by
three days of seminars and cultural programmes in honour of the 1989
Nobel Peace laureate.
The four seminars, on non-violence and compassion in the 21st century,
time and transcendence, inner and outer disciplines, and sciences and
spirituality, will include internationally prominent academics.
Organisers said they had chosen India as the venue for the festivities
despite invitations from the Dalai Lama's disciples from all over the
world.
''In ancient Indian and Tibetan tradition, the 60th birthday is
considered an important milestone,'' said organiser Lakhan Mehrotra.
The spiritual leader has been living in exile in India's Himalayan
town of Dharamshala with thousands of his followers since an abortive
uprising in 1959 against Chinese rule.
Exiled Tibetans have been vociferous in demonstrating anger at China
but organisers insist that the celebrations, attended by scientists,
philosophers, and human-rights activists, would have no political
overtones.
They stressed that the programme would be purely spiritual, cultural,
religious, and academic, and would have no impact on India-China
relations.
Relations between the two Asian giants, who fought a brief border war
in 1962, have begun to warm in recent years, though Beijing watches the
Dalai Lama closely.--Reuter.

Gaza, Tuesday
ISRAEL and the PLO will sign a deal on expanding Palestinian self-rule
to more of the West Bank on July 25.
The date was set by PLO chairman Yasser Arafat and Israeli Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres in a joint statement following an afternoon of
talks in Gaza.
Palestinian Authority spokesman Yasser Abed Rabbo said the two sides
had yet to reach agreement but would hold intensive negotiations so as
to meet the deadline for signing.
''On July 25, definitely, we'll be signing the agreement,'' he said.
''Until then there will be intensive negotiations.''
Arafat and Peres met at the PLO leader's headquarters in Gaza City.
Their meeting was a resumption of talks on Israeli army redeployment
in the West Bank and Palestinian elections. The talks broke up without
agreement on Sunday.
Israel and the PLO missed a July 1 deadline for reaching a deal to
expand autonomy because of disagreement over control of security,
officials said. The PLO took control of most of Gaza and the West Bank
town of Jericho in May last year.
Israel delayed implementation of self-rule's second stage in response
to a campaign of attacks by militant Muslim groups.
Lower-level Israel-PLO meetings on the transfer to the Palestinians of
civilian authorities in the West Bank resume tomorrow in Cairo.--Reuter.

Imagination is essential in achieving fashionable flair. Anvar Khan
looks at four ways to wear a simple, black swimsuit creating both casual
and elegant looks for summer.
THE staff at House of Fraser seemed somewhat mesmerised by my ability
to hunt down suitable pieces of clothing for a fashion shoot. ''I just
don't know how you can go around looking at all these lovely things,''
one lady remarked. ''We get so much in here,'' she continued, faffing
around with forms and tissue paper, ''I'd have to put blinkers on to
stop myself buying things.''
As it happens, the self-control was easy. It's the difference between
being a detective and a bystander. The shuffling hordes dawdle and gawp
at fashion, the undercover agent investigates. I was hunting for four
ways to wear a black swimsuit, and I was more on the ball as a sleuth
than a consumer. It was agreeable, not being hampered by my own size,
weight, and shape, and I was enjoying the freedom to vet shops and
departments never vetted before.
It was generous of the women with positions in various stores to offer
their sympathies, for they thought I was under the intolerable burden of
temptation. It was understandable that they would presume I was
contemplating a sweet, silent surrender to the July sales.
And none of them would have condemned me if I had picked up a few
items, here and there, for my own wardrobe, whispering that ultimate
justification: ''You only live once.'' There is an unspoken empathy
between women when it comes to spending money. All women want nice
things in the linen cupboard or on the dressing table. Theirs is a
simple greed for comfort and pleasure.
However, the trip soon became an emotional experiment. It was
surprisingly easy to be hard. The urge to buy limped, dwindled, then
died. When you can have anything, it seems, you desire nothing. This is
why rich ladies shoplift, why millionaires still like a bargain.
I got a bigger buzz walking out of the few stores with attractive
goods, and not having paid for them. I am in no way advocating theft,
but it seems that when you cut out the act of purchase, you're removing
the satisfaction of the kill. Do that, and you run on adrenalin.
Shopping is, after all, the twentieth century version of hunting. Women
are suspiciously good at it. My press card and I were flying from
escalator to cash desk, only coming down to land when I had to take
everything back.
Of course, my sailing through various high-street departments with a
notepad, raised a few eyebrows. After explaining the objective of the
black-swimsuit exercise, I made the mistake of telling a nosy saleswoman
that I thought a designer lime green, sequinned, and gemstone mini-dress
with a strawberry pink lining would look good worn back to front with
the bathing costume underneath.
''Oh?'' she ejected, concerned. ''As over the top as that?'' Which
shook my confidence a bit, until I found my evening attire in swimwear,
in the metallic gold section, for people who like to overdress for the
beach. A find which seemed to support the principle of ignoring those
who profess to know best.
Revisiting shops to recap on possible clothing, however, has its
pitfalls. I was periodically accosted by professional perfume-squirters
and promotion girls who spend their Saturdays cutting up pizza slices or
cheese into cocktail bites for sampling. There was the whitecoat who was
also selling pots of clay which, she said, would turn your bathroom into
a spa. She must have been speaking metaphorically, because if you were
to redecorate, you'd need at least 100 of the #25 bowls she was selling.
She'd watched me coming and going, and as bad luck would have it, set
up camp in my personal space to interpret my blank stare as one of
spellbound attention.
She told me the most outrageous stuff. She said a #13.50 bar of mud
soap would last me six months. She asked me what I used on my face and
when I told her, she said that The Body Shop tricked people, that their
packaging always suggested more product than there was.
''Why pay #4 for a bar of soap there which will only last a week?''
she inquired, omitting the fact that Body Shop soaps don't sell at #4
each and that nowadays the standards of soap production are so high you
can actually count on any bar of soap lasting more than seven days.
Redcoats ensure holiday fun but whitecoats ensure pain. She told me I
had an oily T-zone and dry patches and that her mud soap would get rid
of my blackheads. And for this I said thank-you and hurried along my
way, mulling once again over shots for the paper, thinking about
perfection in its truest form, not as something to be aspired to, just
something fake to be designed.

NEARLY 100 staff and supporters yesterday joined a mock funeral to
protest against plans to close Belvidere Hospital in Glasgow.
A hearse with coffin and wreath led the demonstrators to St Andrew's
House in Edinburgh where a petition, containing thousands of names and
letters of protest, was handed in to Scottish Secretary Ian Lang.
Greater Glasgow Health Board plans to close the 111-bed hospital for
the elderly in the East End of Glasgow as part of a shake-up of medical
services.
Belvidere shop steward Eleanor Harvey claimed patients at the hospital
had wanted to join the protest but had been denied the chance by the
health board, which would not allow their minibus to be used to ferry
them to Edinburgh.
Wheelchair-bound Ella Murphy made the journey to support her three
daughters and step-daughter who all work at Belvidere. ''I have suffered
a stroke and might need the hospital myself one day,'' she said.
Pensioners' groups also voiced their concern. Their spokeswoman, Mrs
Bridie Leckie, 74, said: ''This is the only East End hospital in Glasgow
which takes in elderly people. We don't want to see patients thrown into
nursing homes away from their friends and trained nurses.''
Unison spokesman Jim Devine said: ''Belvidere Hospital provides care
for nearly 120 elderly people -- people who fought for the NHS, people
who contributed all of their working lives to the NHS, people who, when
they now need the NHS, are finding the NHS is not there.''
The union estimates nearly 8000 long-stay beds are threatened in
Scotland and has called on Mr Lang to halt all closures and initiate a
public debate on the future of long-term care.
A Scottish Office spokesman said no application to close the hospital
had yet been lodged.

THE hopes of young blondes called Avril, who may have been dreaming of
a fortune, were dashed yesterday.
Reports that a businessman had left his estate to the woman who won
his heart on a Spanish holiday six years ago proved sadly wide of the
mark.
There is a businessman -- but he has not died. He does want to leave
money to Avril in his will -- but it will be only a ''small'' amount,
possibly a two or three-figure sum.
And the real Avril has been traced. That, at least, was the word from
Birmingham office worker Richard Sutcliffe, who was at one stage
involved in the hunt for Avril.
Speaking on condition that the identity of his employers was not
disclosed, Mr Sutcliffe -- who is not a full-time investigator --
sounded harassed and nervous as the nation's media sought to track down
Avril.
''This is very very worrying, and I am getting a lot of hassle from a
lot of people. I don't want to get involved,'' he said.
Previously reports had said that Avril, a tall blonde from Glasgow,
could benefit from an estate worth hundreds of thousands of pounds.
The benefactor was a man who met Avril on holiday at the Castell
Montegri camp site on the Costa Brava between August 25 and September
25, 1989.
Mr Sutcliffe approached a Glasgow firm of accountants dealing with the
travel industry in the hope that records could establish her identity.
But Leslie MacIntyre, at the accounts firm, drew a blank.
Mr MacIntrye said: ''We don't know very much about it. But she must
have been a memorable girl. All we know is what we heard from Mr
Sutcliffe.''
Mr Sutcliffe said the story had become ''embroidered'' in the telling,
but was unable to explain how. ''There is a Scottish woman called Avril,
who may be left a small amount of money,'' he said.
He declined to give full details, but said: ''It has been blown up out
of all proportion. There is a chap drawing up his will, there is a small
sum involved -- and Avril has been identified.
''I would really rather not get involved. I am not working for a firm
of lawyers, my involvement is very minimal, and now I'm getting all this
hassle.''

A NEW age traveller attacked his girlfriend with an axe then set his
dog on ambulancemen when they arrived to take her to hospital, a court
heard yesterday.
Stuart Cummings, 27, was jailed for five years for assaulting Nan
Starks in their caravan in a lay-by opposite the new age travellers'
site at Kentallen, by Duror, Lochaber, in February this year.
He repeatedly struck her on the head and body with an axe to her
severe injury.
Cummings originally appeared at Fort William Sheriff Court but the
sheriff decided his sentencing powers were inadequate and sent him to
the High Court in Edinburgh.
Mr Colin Boyd QC, Advocate-depute, told the court yesterday that the
attacks on Miss Starks, who lived with the accused, took place either
side of midnight. Both were in an advanced state of drunkenness and
during an argument Cummings flew into a rage and struck Miss Starks with
an axe.
When police and ambulance were summoned, he behaved in an extremely
aggressive manner towards the paramedics and set his dog on them.
The victim was treated in hospital for serious wounds to the head and
body.
Cummings told police he had a drink and drugs problem and that he had
carried out the assaults in a fit of jealousy.
Mr James Reilly, defence counsel, said that Cummings was under the
impression that Miss Starks had been unfaithful. When he realised the
extent of the injuries he had inflicted he encouraged her to seek
medical help although she was reluctant to involve the authorities.
He denied setting the dog on the paramedics, claiming that the dog
attacked spontaneously because the ambulance team were strangers.
Miss Starks was standing by the accused, who now felt remorse, and
intended to resume their relationship when he was free.
Lord Ross, Lord Justice Clerk, told Cummings that the court always
took a serious view of assaults involving the use of a weapon such as an
axe.
The victim might well have forgiven him, but there was a public
interest to be served in such cases.

New York, Tuesday
BILL GATES of Microsoft, with an estimated worth of $12.9bn (#8600m),
heads Forbes magazine's ninth annual list of the world's wealthiest
people, the first time an American has occupied the top spot.
Warren Buffett, with an estimated stake of $10.7bn (#7130m) in his
Berkshire Hathaway investment company, is ranked by Forbes as the
world's second-richest person, taking over the position held by Gates
last year.
Both men overtook Yoshiaki Tsutsumi of Japan, who topped the 1994
list.
Forbes said Gates' interest in Microsoft, the world's biggest computer
software company, which he founded and still heads, rose by $4.7bn
(#3133m), or 57%, last year.
In all, Forbes reports, there are 388 individuals or families around
the world worth at least $1bn (#666m), 30 more than last year.
The total net worth of the 388 listed was put at $893bn (#595bn), with
Americans accounting for one-third.
The US had the most billionaires with 129, followed by Germany with 53
and Japan with 37.
Tsutsumi, who has suffered from falling property prices in Japan, was
estimated to be worth $9bn (#6000m). That is $500m more than last year
but less than half of the $20bn he was once thought to have.
Hans Rausing of Sweden, head of packaging giant Tetra Laval, was also
estimated to be worth $9bn, joining Tsutsumi in third place on the list,
which does not include royals or heads of state.
Paul Sacher of Switzerland, who married into the Hoffman family, heirs
to the Roche pharmaceutical empire, edged out Tsai Wan-lin of Taiwan,
founder of Cathay Life Insurance company, for fifth place.
Sacher's wealth was estimated at $8.6bn, just $100m more than Tsai's.
The rest of Forbes' richest individuals were Canadian media magnate
Kenneth Thomson and Hong Kong property mogul Lee Shau Kee, both worth
$6.5bn; Chung Ju-yung, founder of South Korea's Hyundai industrial
conglomerate, with $6.2bn; and Li Ka-shing of Hong Kong, whose interests
include property, energy, and telecommunications, worth $5.9bn.
Seven of the 10 were self-made billionaires.
Geographically, after the United States, Asia had the next highest
number of billionaires, with 107, followed by Europe, with 100. The rest
of the Americas had 35 and Africa and the Middle East contributed 17.

KEITH BRUCE speaks to Chan Parker about her husband's place in the
jazz hall of fame.
IN the mid-1940s the brownstone house at 7 West 52nd Street was one of
the hippest addresses in New York. There a former Ziegfield Follies girl
lived with her daughter. Mrs Richardson had the hat-check concession at
the Cotton Club, but her daughter Chan, then just turned 20, preferred
to hang out at clubs like the Three Deuces where the new music, bebop,
was to be heard.
Chan was a self-possessed young woman with a graceful dancer's body
and she loved the new music and the intense young men who played it. The
house became a salon for the new sound. Musicians were always welcome to
drop in, stay there a while, grab a bite to eat.
Particularly she loved Charlie ''Yardbird'' Parker, the alto
saxophonist who was one of the pivotal figures on the scene. They dated,
but Parker had other women, just as she, surely, had other men. But when
Parker's heroin addiction was already beginning to limit the days
towards the end of his life, it was Chan Richardson Parker who was his
partner.
Tragedy dogged them -- his mental illness, the death of a child -- but
50 years later Chan Parker, now living in Paris which she has made her
home since 1968, refuses to see Charlie Parker as the tragic figure.
''Living with genius is difficult, but it was rewarding and I don't
regret a minute of it. Nobody ever felt responsible for Bird.
''He was a strong man and nobody ever told him what to do. He was his
own man. He was responsible for me. Most of the time he was very happy
at his home, enjoying Sunday dinners with his family.''
This unlikely picture of Parker as a settled family man confirms the
already authoritative word of Ross Russell in the definitive biography
Bird Lives! (subtitled The High Life and Hard Times of Charlie
''Yardbird'' Parker), from which the tragic picture is mostly drawn.
When Bird, aged 31, began living with Chan, 27, and her daughter Kim,
4, in 1951 after his break up with Doris Syndor, quiet family life was
ostensibly the order of the day, except that the monkey was never really
off his back.
Russell's book lends its title to a concert that for many will be the
highlight of this year's Glasgow International Jazz Festival. It brings
together British saxophonist Peter King and his quintet (including
superb young trumpeter Gerard Presencer) and American altoist Phil
Woods. Both players are firmly out of the Parker mould: brilliant tone,
lightning speed, and sure harmonic sense. To have them both on the same
stage at the Old Fruitmarket is bebop heaven, and you can be sure Bird
will be smiling down upon the gig.
Less fancifully, the concert will be graced by the presence of Chan
Parker herself, making her first visit to Scotland to inaugurate the
GIJF's Hall of Fame, first entrant Charlie Parker.
Chan Parker is thrilled to have been invited, but unsurprised that her
husband's memory should still excite attention and his music such
respect. She admits it will have been a while since she went to a jazz
gig.
''I keep up with the jazz scene, and I have a lot of musician friends
in Paris but I don't go the clubs much. There's nothing new that thrills
me, but Bird will always be played.''
In her countryside home outside the French capital, Chan Parker lives
with a dog and a cat, a garden, a lot of records and a collection of 500
jazz films on video. It is appropriate that Chan Parker should continue
to see Bird as a homing hipster, while the received wisdom characterises
him as a wayward, self-destructive genius, romantically destroyed by his
talent. Towards the end of our conversation, she abruptly revises a
detail of their history from half a century ago. No, she hadn't first
met Bird at the Three Deuces (as Ross Russell reports), but at the West
52nd Street apartment.
''But I knew all about him anyway. His reputation went ahead of him in
New York. Everyone spoke of the new little guy from Kansas City,'' she
said.
Fifty years on they speak of him still.

Charles Mingus will be just one of many jazz legends featured on US
postage stamps this autumn. Rob Adams reflects on his influence style.
THIS autumn the US Government issues a set of postage stamps featuring
jazz musicians, among them bassist, composer, band leader, iconoclast,
the late Charles Mingus. It's probably the first time a former post
office worker has appeared on a stamp, an irony that would have pleased
Mingus as much as the honour, says his widow, Sue.
A mailman was Mingus's father's idea of a good solid job for his son.
But Mingus's spells delivering letters were not parental obedience -- he
simply needed the money when the musical jobs were thin.
Throughout his 40-year career he went his own way. It's been said that
there's been too much made of Mingus's personality and not enough of his
music. But music is a reflection of the composer's character and the
richness of Mingus's compositions, their incredible variety, from the
tenderest ballad to the fiercest orchestration by way of roaring
celebratory gospel chants, speak of a character indeed.
Dannie Richmond, Mingus's long-serving drummer, said that Mingus not
only wanted to be a pimp, a gangster, a musician and a great lover, he
considered himself to be all of these people. And in his autobiography,
Beneath the Underdog, whether you believe it all or not, Mingus
certainly portrayed himself along those lines.
Yet had he stuck to the biographical and musical essence Mingus would
have told a sufficiently interesting story. Born in Nogales, Arizona in
1922, Mingus was raised in the Watts area of Los Angeles, where the
first music he heard was at his stepmother's church. Having played
trombone and cello as a child, he found his real niche when, at 16, he
switched to double bass.
After studying piano and music theory with his rehearsal band leader,
Lloyd Reese, Mingus struck out on a career which included work with,
arguably, the four most influential musicians in jazz -- Louis
Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Charlie Parker and Miles Davis -- among many,
many others.
In the fifties, Mingus established his credentials as a band leader
and composer, founding his own record company, Debut, and beginning the
Charles Mingus Jazz Workshop, a quintet, sometimes a sextet, which
featured some of the great front-line partnerships of the time,
including trombonist Jimmy Knepper with saxophonist Shafi Hadi and
trumpeter Ted Curson with bass clarinettist Eric Dolphy.
Knepper and Hadi were recalled to play alongside saxophonists John
Handy and Booker Ervin on 1959's classic Mingus Ah Um album which
crystallises Mingus's gospel, blues and Ellington influences and hints
at larger scale works to come.
Through the Workshop's encouragement of collective improvisation and a
more vocalised instrumental tone Mingus became one of the motivators of
''free jazz'', although he later rejected the term.
By the time Mingus stopped playing regularly in late 1977, due to the
onset of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, the one area of jazz that
Ellington had covered and he hadn't was songs, and it was possibly with
this is mind that he contacted singer/songwriter Joni Mitchell, asking
her to write lyrics for his compositions.
This unlikely collaboration proved to be Mingus's last, although he
kept producing ideas, latterly singing them on to tape, having lost the
use of his hands, virtually up to his death in January 1979.
He died in Cuernavaca, Mexico, having gone there seeking treatment for
a disease which, says Sue Mingus, ''is terminal and for which the
established medical profession offers no hope whatsoever''. A few days
after his death Sue flew to an ashram in India, where Mingus had hoped
to go from Mexico, and cast his ashes into the Ganges' sacred waters at
sunrise. A few months later, determined to have his music played, Sue
was forming the band, Mingus Dynasty.
She met Mingus in the early sixties at a time when she knew nothing
about jazz. They became friends and eventually she became his manager.
She learned the business herself. Eventually Mingus moved in with her
and in 1975 they were married -- by poet Allen Ginsberg. In 1991 Sue was
looking for a way to have Mingus's music played by a band larger in
scope than Mingus Dynasty. That August she happened on New York's Time
Cafe, whose owners were willing to have a band play on Thursdays for a
month -- starting on September 5.
Sue called various musicians who had worked with Mingus and assembled
a band who on opening night were confronted with music they'd never seen
before but thrilled the packed audience. Four years on the residency
continues, with musicians from a pool of 120, many of them among New
York's most in-demand session players, turning up to play for the door
takings.
The Mingus Big Band has just released its first CD (which mistakenly
calls it Big Bang -- ''we hope that's prophetic,'' says Sue). It
captures brilliantly the spirit of Mingus's writing and in her liner
note Sue alludes to the presence of Mingus at the recording session as
some sort of overseer.
''A bass string snaps and the musicians say they've felt his presence.
When they performed his Epitaph in Washington, thunder and lightning
greeted the band and everybody felt Charles was up there making himself
heard,'' Sue says.
* The Mingus Big Band play at McEwan's Old Fruitmarket, Glasgow, on
Sunday.

<HEADLINE>Four hurt in Tokyo cyanide attacks</HEADLINE>

Tokyo, Wednesday
FOUR gas incidents, two involving cyanide, hit busy Tokyo train
stations last night and today in Japan's latest public scare. Four
people were slightly injured.
In two cases, police said they found sophisticated devices planted in
public lavatories at stations that would have emitted enough cyanide gas
to kill thousands of commuters.
''We have not established direct links among the four cases,'' said a
police spokesman, ''but we are treating at least two as attempted murder
cases.''
It was the worst series of gas incidents since the March 20 subway
nerve gas attack which killed 11 people and injured 5500. Guru Shoko
Asahara and top members of the doomsday cult Aum Shinri Kyo (Supreme
Truth sect) are in detention and have been indicted on murder and
attempted-murder charges in connection with the nerve gas case.
A spokeswoman for the cult refused to comment on the latest incidents.
''We just heard the news of the incidents and we are not prepared to
make a statement,'' she said.
In the first incident last night, a janitor found a device that would
have released cyanide gas at a lavatory inside Kayabacho subway station,
near the Tokyo Stock Exchange in central Tokyo, and reported it to
police.
Police said the timer set in the device would have mixed two agents to
release enough cyanide gas to kill 9000 people. No-one was hurt.
About six hours later, shortly after midnight, three commuters were
overwhelmed by mysterious fumes inside a bathroom at Tokyo station, the
capital's main railway terminal.
Police found no device and said the nature of the Tokyo station fumes
was not known. The three people were released from hospital soon after
being treated for sore throats.
Soon after the Tokyo station case, a cyanide-gas emission device
similar to the one found at Kayabacho was discovered at a lavatory in
Shinjuku station, the capital's busiest station.
One person walked to an ambulance at Shinjuku, but did not appear in
serious condition.
At least 30 fire engines rushed to Shinjuku station, which police
closed to media and bystanders. Police wearing gas masks and carrying
oxygen tanks entered the station and were followed by firefighters in
similar protective gear. They were later joined by the army's
anti-chemical warfare squad.
A small amount of cyanide gas was leaking from the Shinjuku lavatory,
but it was under control, police said.
The latest cyanide devices closely resembled one planted in a Shinjuku
station bathroom on May 5 which was also said capable of killing
thousands. On that occasion subway officials found the contraption and
nobody was hurt.
Japanese media have reported that arrested Aum members told
investigators they carried out the May 5 Shinjuku attack to confuse
police investigations of the March 20 nerve gas attack. The Aum sect has
denied any connection to the May 5 case.
In the fourth reported incident, unidentified fumes at Ginza subway
station in the heart of Tokyo's luxury shopping district raised an alarm
but no-one was injured.
Police did not find a device at Ginza station and said only that the
fumes smelled like very strong disinfectant.
The latest incidents followed two days of mysterious fumes reported in
Yokohama, Tokyo's twin port city to the south.
About 50 people were sent to hospital on Sunday and Monday but all
were discharged soon after they were treated for nausea and sore
throats. The fumes have not been identified and police have said they
may have been caused by a copycat prankster.--Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Final #118m profit for British Coal</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>977551573</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Coal made an operating profit of #118m last year before its
pits were sold to private owners, according to its annual report.
The former nationalised industry is on target to complete the sale of
all its non-mining activities by next year, 50 years after the
corporation was set up.
Chairman Neil Clarke said the sale of agricultural and development
land as well as property being offered over the next year will be the
last main element in the privatisation of the industry.
''The curtain will then close on half a century of state ownership,''
he said.
On the operating profit, which included #62m from deep mines and #41m
from open cast activities, he said: ''In spite of a 25% reduction in
sale to the electricity generators during the year, continuing cost
reductions and significant marketing successes meant the corporation was
able to maintain profitability.''
According to the annual report, profit per tonne of coal mined at
British Coal collieries last year was #2.90 compared to #1.57 the
previous year.
British Coal now employs fewer than 100 staff and is likely to be
dissolved by the end of next year. The Government yesterday extended Mr
Clarke's contract, due to run out at the end of this year, to next June.

AN 18-year-old who lost her mother in a car crash when she was 13
months has won #30,000 compensation from the driver of the other car.
With interest, the award becomes #60,546. She was also awarded costs.
In the unique case, she had sued William Osborne for the loss of the
love and care of the mother she was too young to remember.
The High Court in London heard that although she was too young to
understand the death of her mother, she was well aware of her absence.
She was also aware, and still clearly remembers, the unhappiness of
her relationship with her father's new partner. Until she finally found
comfort and security with her aunt and her three cousins around the age
of 11, Samantha, then a disturbed, unruly child, was unable to relax.
Samantha, who lives with her aunt, Mrs Heather Charlesworth, in
Burnett Place, Aberdeen, was in the rear seat of the Vauxhall car being
driven by her father when the head-on collision occurred in Essex in
October 1977.
Her mother, then aged 21 and five months pregnant, died from multiple
injuries.
Mr Osborne, of Benfleet, was later convicted of careless driving and
fined #25.
Samantha's father received #2000 insurance compensation at the time,
but no separate claim was made on her behalf.
It was 1987 before Mrs Charlesworth and Samantha were able to persuade
Essex County Council, which was responsible for her until her 18th
birthday, to pursue the case.
Samantha lived with her father for 12 months then spent four years
with various foster families in Essex before being allowed by her
guardians, Essex County Council, to move to Aberdeen. Since the age of
seven she has lived with Mrs Charlesworth, her mother's sister.
Announcing his judgment on the case, Mr Justice Sedley told the court
that Samantha's father had tried to look after her but after a year
Essex County Council had to assume parental rights over her.
''At 13 months Samantha was not capable of appreciating the fact of
her mother's death, but perfectly capable of becoming aware of her
absence.
''She was also aware of the unhappiness of her relationship with her
father's new partner.'' He said he was not interested in blame and that
what mattered for present purposes was that Samantha's perception and
abiding memory had been of a punitive relationship with the woman who,
in 1979, her father married.
''By now Samantha was formally in the care of the local authority, and
it is a measure of the unhappiness of her situation that the local
authority eventually removed her from the care of her father and
stepmother when she was about five, and placed her with an elderly
couple evidently by way of short-term or medium-term fostering.
''When finally she was able to be fostered by her aunt and uncle --
Sheena and George Taylor in Aberdeen -- she was a disturbed child.
''The stress was so great that the Taylors finally had to give up, and
Samantha was moved to her grandparents.
''There she was cosseted and happy, secure in their flat and enjoying
weekends and holidays with her aunt, Heather Charlesworth, and her
cousins Kelly and Ashley.
''When, however, Samantha was moved to live permanently with the
Charlesworths she reacted badly again to the uprooting.
''Her aunt Heather describes a frightened and aggressive child whose
relationships with the new family were a source of continuing difficulty
and tension.
''But Mrs Charlesworth persevered and Samantha slowly settled down.
She was almost eight when she moved permanently to live with her aunt,
and Mrs Charlesworth considers that it was not until Samantha was about
11 that she began to feel secure and to relax.''
The judge described Samantha as a ''sensible young woman'' who had
neither minimised nor exaggerated the effects of her early life
experiences on her self-confidence.
''She has done well at school and has gone on to further education
with the intention of going in due course to university.''
Miss Jacqueline Parry, for Samantha, had asked the judge to award
damages not just for the loss of her mother's services but to reflect
the ''trauma of being cast adrift in her upbringing''.
Mr Justice Sedley said the evidence in the case amply demonstrated the
death of her mother caused Samantha to suffer years of unhappiness and
behavioural disturbance.
He added that the law in recent years had tried to move away from the
mere ''commercial quantification'' of a mother's services in a bid to
''recognise the unquantifiable aspects of the loss of a mother's care''.
''In the light of authority my task is not, however, to make an award
of general damages proportioned to the personal trauma Samantha has
undergone, but to recognise that in the loss of her mother's care she
has lost the anchorage which her mother could have been expected to
provide and which her father, in the event, did not.
''In my judgment a fair sum to represent the pecuniary loss, in the
modern understanding of that term, caused to Samantha by the death of
her mother is #40,000,'' he said.
Reducing that sum by 25% to take account of Samantha's mother's own
contributory negligence because she was not wearing a seatbelt, the
judge awarded the teenager #30,000.
''Since this case has understandably attracted some public attention,
let me say very clearly that this sum is not the value which the law
places on a mother.
''The courts are called upon in cases such as this to quantify a loss
which in reality no sum of money can ever repair.''
Samantha did not attend yesterday's hearing.

A SUMMER of disruption on the railways moved nearer yesterday when
British Rail revealed profits of #362m last year and big bonuses for
board members, while insisting it could not afford to improve on its
''final'' 3% pay offer.
Board chairman John Welsby stressed that the figures were deceptive
and that they masked falling income and vastly increased subsidy. In
recent years, he said, the industry had lacked sufficient investment.
He branded as ''irresponsible'' Aslef train drivers, who are due to
begin a series of 24-hour stoppages next Tuesday in a bid to win an
improved offer. The pay offer was a good one and was as much as the
industry could afford, he said, adding that industrial action would
inevitably lead to job losses.
Aslef's general secretary, Mr Lew Adams, angrily complained that
former BR chairman Sir Bob Reid had walked away from the railways with
the equivalent of seven times the drivers' basic wage as a bonus for
improved performance, while train drivers were forced into strike action
because of yet another wage cut.
BR, he said, should realise that it was the staff who should be
rewarded for improving profits, not overpaid management.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the Rail Maritime and Transport
union (RMT), who expects to reveal on Friday whether members at BR and
on London Underground have also voted for one-day strikes, hit out at
what he saw as BR's ''double standards''.
While the workforce had been reduced by a further 10,000 and were
expected to accept a wage cut, he said, members of the board were
enjoying bonuses of up to 40% and even more in the case of the former
chairman, Sir Bob Reid.
BR's claim that the #362m was only a paper profit was a strange
argument, said Mr Knapp, because those bonuses were real enough, as was
the enormous contribution of the workforce over recent years.
Last year alone productivity increased by 19% yet BR's treatment of
its workforce remained ''shabby and tawdry''. RMT, he said, shared Mr
Welsby's view that the industry was massively underfunded and had been
arguing that case for 10 years.
RMT calculated that the average pay of BR board members rose by more
than 20% last year to #66,333, whereas BR employees saw their pay rise
by an average of 3.7% over the same period.
Against this background a pay offer below the rate of inflation was
just not good enough, declared Mr Knapp. The BR report would serve to
stiffen his members' resolve.
Asked if some rail staff might find the #77,300 bonus paid to Sir Bob
when he stood down earlier this year ''offensive'' at a time when their
own pay claims had been rejected, Mr Welsby commented: ''I understand
why some people can be emotional about this but it doesn't alter the
realities. This industry can only afford to pay a 3% rise.''
He said that he himself had not paid the bonus and that it had been a
matter for Sir Bob and the Transport Secretary, Mr Brian Mawhinney.
Mr Welsby said 1994-95 had been a ''difficult and frustrating year''
and that last summer's signal workers' strikes had ''lost the industry
money which has gone for good''.
Mr Welsby said BR was still seeing the effects of last year's strike
and ''to add to these problems by engaging in further strikes this year
is irresponsible''.
He pointed out that although the financial result looked good, a #450m
profit had been made by the rolling stock leasing companies -- and these
would soon pass into the private sector.
Labour's transport spokesman, Mr Henry McLeish, deplored the fact that
BR board members had awarded themselves big bonuses ''while rail
services are under threat'' and drew attention to the #177m spent on
rail privatisation over the past two years plus the additional #1000m
subsidy to BR last year as part of the privatisation process.

JUNIOR Defence Minister Roger Freeman confirmed yesterday that the
Trident works programme on the Clyde was expected to exceed the 1984
baseline estimate of #1100m at current prices by some #800m.
However, he told the House of Commons that the Trident programme
overall was expected to cost #11.7bn, representing a saving of #3700m
over the original estimate.
The issue was raised during Defence Questions by Liberal Democrat MP
Archy Kirkwood (Roxburgh and Berwickshire), who suggested that a 72%
overspend on the works programme was an ''absolute disgrace''.
He claimed that there were examples of construction of some parts of
the project starting before the design work had been completed, and that
50% of the overspend had been siphoned off from other projects.
He demanded to know whether, after the powerful Commons Public
Accounts Committee had investigated the matter, any Minister or official
responsible for ''this project's gross failure'' would reconsider their
position.
Mr Freeman repeated that the programme overall had come in
substantially under budget, with #3700m not required for the completion
of the submarines, missiles, and other parts of the programme.

Brussels
JACQUES SANTER, president of the European Commission, has given his
personal support to a Scottish lecturer who claims he is the victim of
discrimination in an Italian university.
Professor David Petrie, 43-year-old languages and literature lecturer
at the University of Verona, complained -- along with 12 non-Italian
colleagues -- to the European Commission after their wages were cut by
15% and they were blocked for promotion while Italian colleagues were
given pay rises and improved conditions. Such discrimination is illegal
under European law.
Professor Petrie, from Dumbarton, has won two judgments in his favour
in the European Court of Justice but the Italian authorities have mostly
ignored the findings. This led to the European Commission taking out
infringement proceedings against Italy two years ago.
An Italian court two weeks ago impounded the assets of the university
so that it could secure wages and back payments worth #21,000 for the
foreigners.
Mr Santer was asked by Professor Petrie to speed up infringement
proceedings and was supported by Mr Hugh McMahon, Labour Euro-MP for
Strathclyde West, whose constituency includes Dumbarton.
Mr McMahon yesterday released a reply from Mr Santer, who wrote: ''I
can assure you the commission fully shares your preoccupation.''
Mr Santer said infringement proceedings had resulted in the Italians
agreeing to amend some legislation. The commission would now request
more changes ''since the present situation is not yet satisfactory''.
But the president rejected a request by Mr McMahon for sanctions
against the Italian Government. The Euro-MP had wanted to have
educational aid from Brussels, under the Socrates programme, blocked
until the university gave way.
''The commission thinks that this would not be appropriate since the
main beneficiaries of this programme, who would be penalised, are the
students themselves and not the public authorities,'' Mr Santer argued.

CONVICTED television actor Eric Cullen, best known for his role as Wee
Burney in the Rab C Nesbitt series, is likely to spend another few days
in Barlinnie pending an attempt to have him released on bail.
Cullen was jailed for nine months at Hamilton Sheriff Court last
Thursday after admitting indecency offences and his lawyers had planned
to ask a judge at the High Court in Edinburgh yesterday to grant him
interim liberation pending an appeal against sentence.
However, the appeal did not go ahead because an updated background
medical report on the actor was not ready. Cullen's appeal is now
expected to go ahead either later this week or early next week.
He was jailed by Sheriff Alexander Macpherson after he admitted being
in possession of a quantity of indecent videos and obscene photographs
at his home in Hamilton, taking two indecent pictures of children,
taking an indecent video of young boys, and exposing himself in front of
children.
The sheriff was told that Cullen himself had been the victim of
systematic sexual abuse since the age of 13.

THREE English football players, including goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar
and Aston Villa striker John Fashanu, last night were facing the
prospect of being charged in connection with allegations of match
rigging.
The other player involved is Wimbledon's goalkeeper, Hans Segers.
They have been told that an exhaustive investigation into alleged
corruption in football has been referred to the Crown Prosecution
Service.
Last night's development follows months of inquiriesinto claims that a
Malaysian betting syndicate bribed individuals in England to fix
matches.
The three players and two others will be told on July 21 whether they
are to stand trial.
They were arrested along with Fashanu's wife, Melisa Kass-Mapsi, and
Malaysian businessman Heng Suan Lim. All three responded to police bail
yesterday at stations in and around Southampton.
Grobbelaar and Fashanu were detained for questioning for an additional
six hours yesterday after an approach was made to magistrates. The three
others were freed with instructions to return on July 21.
Detective Chief Superintendent Roger Hoddinott, head of Hampshire CID,
said it had been a complex inquiry and would take some time before it
was complete.
* Soccer player Brian Law has been charged with taking away a bus
without permission and drink driving, police said yesterday.
The 25-year-old Wolves star and former Welsh internationalist was
arrested with three other men after the single-decker bus was taken from
Wolverhampton town centre. It later ran into railings on a ring road.
All four were bailed to appear before magistrates on July 31, the West
Midlands police spokesman said.
Law, a former Queens Park Rangers player, was charged with taking the
bus without consent, driving with excess alcohol, failing to stop after
an accident, failing to report an accident, and driving without licence
or insurance.
The other three men were charged with taking the bus without consent.

A MOTHER who burned her baby son with cigarettes and scalded him with
hot water was jailed yesterday for 19 months.
The child, aged between 12 and 18 months at the time, was left with
second degree burns over 5% to6% of his body. A forensic medicine expert
described the injuries as ''staggering''.
A jury at Edinburgh Sheriff Court had unanimously found the
25-year-old woman guilty of wilfully assaulting, ill-treating, and
neglecting her baby.
The woman, who cannot be named to protect the identity of the child,
repeatedly slapped the child, burned his hand with cigarettes, scalded
him to his severe injury, failed to feed and clean him properly, and
failed to get him proper medical attention.
The incidents happened between January and August 1993. The woman
admitted failing to turn up for trial last October.
Dr Thomas Clark told the court he was called out to the house where
the mother-of-three was staying at the time after a report of a baby
being burned. He described a large burn on the child's left thigh, a
large scald on the right lower leg, and smaller burned areas around a
foot and on a hand.
He had been told that the baby had been playing with hot water, but
said that the facts did not fit the story. He decided that the boy was
in danger and had him taken to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children.
Anthony Busuttil, Professor of Forensic Medicine at Edinburgh
University, examined the boy. He noted: ''The multiplicity of bruises
and other injuries on this child are staggering.''
The woman with whom the mother was staying when the scalding happened
told the court that her boyfriend called a doctor after hearing the baby
crying and discovering the burns. Asked if the woman was a good mother,
she replied that, on a scale of one to 10, the woman would not even get
on the scale.
The mother wept as her solicitor, Mr Kenny McFarlane, told Sheriff
Peter McNeill that none of her three children now lived with her. The
scalded boy had been adopted.
Mr McFarlane said that the woman had had a troubled background. It was
a classic situation of an abuser having been abused.

<TEXT>
A FAMILY'S two-year fight with the Church of England to have the words
''dad'' and ''grandad'' on a gravestone ended yesterday when the
deceased was exhumed and reburied in a second service.
However, Charles and Wendy Brown, who were told by a vicar the words
could not be used because they were ''pet names'', called on the church
to make its rules clearer to avoid causing grief to other families.
Mr Brown's father Frederick, 83, a former naval officer, was exhumed
at dawn from the churchyard of Holy Trinity at Freckleton, Lancashire,
where the vicar, the Rev Stephen Brian, had banned the use of the words.
He was reburied five miles away in a public cemetery in Lytham St
Anne's. There, the family will erect a headstone with the inscription
''a devoted and much loved husband, dad, and grandad''.
The couple won a rare order allowing the exhumation after winning
their case on appeal at a Church of England consistory court.
Mrs Brown, 34, of Clayton-le-Woods, Lancashire, whose husband, a
39-year-old dentist, is organist at their parish church in Bolton, said:
''No member of this family will ever be buried in a Church of England
churchyard in the future.
''In its bereavement this family look to the church for comfort, not
conflict. We expectd a caring church.
''In many cases the vicar has never met the person he is asked to
bury. What right does he have to dictate the headstone inscription
instead of the relative who has spent their life with that person and
who will derive comfort from that inscription?''
She added: ''It would have been nice if all this could have been
avoided; I still think it could have been if the church laid out the
rules and regulations. It is an easy thing to do and it would save a lot
of grief.''
Mr Brian said leaflets were now available at the back of his church
explaining the rules. But in a letter to his local newspaper, the Fylde
Express, he said: ''For people who live here, having their loved ones
buried in their local churchyard is far more important than any rules
about headstones.
''And they find the decision to exhume the body of a loved one, for
any reason whatsoever, hard to understand.''

A COMMUNITY centre for gays and lesbians is to open in Glasgow later
this year after planning permission was granted by the district council
for conversion of part of a city centre building.
The two-storey centre in the former Custom House in Dixon Street will
be only the second of its type in Scotland. A similar centre is based in
Broughton Street, Edinburgh. Another was located in Glasgow's
Sauchiehall Street but closed several years ago.
The Glasgow Gay and Lesbian Centre Ltd (GGLC), a company set up in
March to lease and manage the new centre, is planning a mixture of
commercial and community spaces for the building, and sub-tenancies will
be available for businesses.
It is hoped the centre will eventually include a cafe and two shops,
including a bookshop. The company says a number of gay and lesbian or
''gay and lesbian-friendly'' organisations are to be approached with a
view to using the premises.
These might include charities such as Scottish Aids Monitor and PHACE
West, the Project for HIV and Aids Care and Education, which is the main
voluntary organisation for combating the spread of HIV and Aids in the
West of Scotland.
GGLC hopes that income from rental charges will allow the centre to be
a self-financing project. Two key telephone services for gays and
lesbians -- Strathclyde Lesbian and Gay Switchboard and Lesbian Line --
will also complement their own services by having counsellors based at
the centre.
The #70,000 refurbishment of the building, which is due to start
shortly, will be financed with #23,000 of funds raised by a gays and
lesbians charity in Glasgow during the past four years and a #47,000
capital grant from Strathclyde Regional Council's social strategy
programme.
The programme was established by the council to help minority groups
such as black and ethnic people and single parents in providing their
services, and recognised for the first time the specific needs of gay
men and lesbians when it awarded the grant last year.
Mr John Wilkes, chairman of GGLC, said: ''We are seeking to provide a
centre for gay men and lesbians in the West of Scotland that offers a
variety of services and meeting spaces, with a backdrop of them growing
up in a society that doesn't always look kindly on them.
''This will be part of the positive affirmation for them and a place
people can call their own.''
Mr Wilkes added that the centre would welcome friends and relatives of
gay and lesbian people.
The centre is expected to be opened in late October or early November
to coincide with the Glasgay arts festival for gays and lesbians.
The planning application for the centre attracted one objection, from
a neighbouring business which claimed access to the building was
unsuitable, that more young people would be attracted to an area it
called a trouble spot, and that it would discourage tourists from using
the area.

<HEADLINE>Decision on Clegg 'crass blunder'. Sinn Fein joins in appeals for calm</HEADLINE>

NORTHERN Ireland remained tense last night after the street violence
which greeted the release of Lee Clegg from Wakefield Prison, where he
had served four years of a life sentence for the murder of 17-year-old
joyrider Karen Reilly.
Political and business leaders were counting the cost of the rampage
in nationalist areas, and warned that inward investment could be
jeopardised if the violence continued.
The RUC and Sinn Fein appealed for calm as the head of the Roman
Catholic Church in Ireland, Cardinal Cahal Daly, branded the release of
Private Clegg a ''grave blunder''.
Cardinal Daly said the Government had shown crass insensitivity in
separating the soldier's case from that of other prisoners, and he urged
speedy action on other ''victims'' of the conflict.
''It seems to me that the release of Lee Clegg at this time was a
grave blunder,'' he said. ''It was a grave blunder in substance and it
was a grave blunder in timing.
''It showed what I can only call crass insensitivity to separate the
case of Private Clegg from that of so many other prisoners.''
At Westminster Mr Major accused Sinn Fein of orchestrating the
violence.
He insisted it was ''absurd'' to equate the case of Lee Clegg with
deliberate acts of murder by paramilitaries, and added that the
decision, and its timing, was ''a judicial matter decided by Northern
Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew on its merits''.
Meanwhile Private Clegg's parents told the press in Richmond, North
Yorkshire, that their son had been helped by his time in prison.
His mother, Mrs Wynne Johnson, told a news conference: ''I think Lee
has matured immensely while he has been in prison.''
His father Mr Stanley Clegg, sitting at his former wife's side, added:
''He has certainly grown in stature.''
Clegg was to join a family reunion last night after being fitted out
with a new Army uniform.
Asked if she could understand how people in nationalist communities
felt, Mrs Johnson said: ''To some extent, yes. They feel as if they are
getting a raw deal.
''But campaigns have been going on for quite a number of years for the
Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four. It's the same as we were doing
for Lee. We feel just the same as they do.''
As sporadic trouble continued on the streets of the province
yesterday, a spokesman for the Department of Economic Development said:
''The violence in no way reflects the peaceful and prosperous situation
the people of Northern Ireland have enjoyed over the past 10 months.
''The fact remains that the world is watching the events and the world
will wonder why such disorder is happening.''
The Northern Ireland Tourist Board said it was concerned the violence
would have a detrimental effect on efforts to attract visitors.
A spokeman said: ''With a 20% increase in tourism forecast for this
year resulting from the peace process, it would be a bitter
disappointment if we were to lose the ground we have gained in the past
10 months.''
Northern Ireland's Economy Minister, Baroness Denton, said she was
also discouraged by the violence. She had been entertaining Japanese
businessmen due to open a West Belfast factory in the autumn when the
streets erupted.
She said: ''You are out there, one of hundreds of people trying to get
investment into West Belfast, and this happens. It's very depressing.''
Sinn Fein gave notice yesterday that it planned a series of protests
to back its campaign for the release of its prisoners. Pickets were
outside police bases in North and West Belfast last night.
The RUC assistant chief constable for Belfast, Mr Bill Stewart, urged
the organisers of any of the protests to ensure they were peaceful.
The taxpayer faces a bill of up to #4m after Monday's violence in
which 160 vehicles were hijacked and destroyed in West Belfast alone.
Rioters caused damaged of #400,000 to buses.
Thirty-two people were arrested, and the RUC opened fire with plastic
bullets on a number of occasions, in some instances when vehicles were
petrol bombed.
Yesterday there were several hijacking incidents, and a bomb alert
after a dustbin was left on a hijacked bus, leading to the evacuation of
the South Tyrone hospital in Dungannon. It was later found to be a hoax.

IT was a royal day for Scotland yesterday as the Prince of Wales
visited three towns in Galloway, and the Queen, with the Duke of
Edinburgh, was at the Palace of Holyroodhouse to present awards.
Prince Charles visited a drop-in centre for youngsters in Dumfries,
toured the Abbeyfield Stewartry Home for the elderly at Dalbeattie, and
opened a multi-million pound housing development at Kirkcudbright, the
last to be built by Stewartry District Council.
At the Abbeyfield Home, which is celebrating its 30th anniversary, the
Prince received a box of fishing flies made by Mr Richard Pickup, of
Kirkpatrick Durham. He is a former pupil at Gordonstoun, the Prince's
old school, and a maker of salmon flies.
The Prince accepted the gift from Mrs Jean Farish, an Abbeyfield Home
worker.
At Holyroodhouse, identical twins who have served as dairymen for
nearly 47 years at a Wigtownshire farm were rewarded with the MBE by the
Queen.
Mr Jim Johnstone, 61, and his twin Alan, of High Three Mark Farm,
Stoneykirk, near Stranraer, stood together for their investiture.
The brothers rise each morning at 4.30am to milk Mr Norman Brown's
herd of 200 holstein fresian cows and also look after the calves. They
started work at the farm after leaving school in December 1948, and are
the third generation of their family to have worked there.
The 91 recipients of awards included three new knights. They were
Professor Sir Michael Bond, professor of psychological medicine and
VicePrincipal of Glasgow University, Sir Alastair Dunnett, former editor
of the Scotsman, and Sir Bruce Pattullo, governor and group chief
executive of the Bank of Scotland.
Two officers in The Highlanders, Major Mark Dodson and Captain Hugh
Eaton, each received an MBE in the military division for services in
Bosnia during efforts to bring about a ceasefire. They are now serving
in Northern Ireland.
Meanwhile, the Duke of Edinburgh sported a Panama hat to shield the
bright sunshine when he strolled in the grounds of Holyroodhouse to meet
some of the 450 young Scots who had gathered for this year's Duke of
Edinburgh Gold Award presentations.

MELANIE GOODFELLOW in Rome, Tuesday
THE co-chairman of the Greens group in the European Parliament,
Italian Alexander Langer, was found hanged from an apricot tree in
Florence today. Police said he had killed himself.
Langer, 49, was found in a field above Piazzale Michelangelo, a
hillside square which attracts hordes of tourists because of its
stunning view of the city.
''All indications are that it was suicide. All other motives can be
ruled out for the moment,'' said a police spokesman in Florence. A
post-mortem examination will take place tomorrow.
The motive for suicide was not immediately clear but police said a
note addressed to Langer's family was on his body.
Police said Langer, whose home was in Florence, had been missing since
yesterday. His wife Valeria alerted police this morning and a search was
launched, including by helicopter.
''He was found hanged from an apricot tree,'' said Enrico Falqui, a
Green member of the Italian Senate.
Langer, a native of the German-speaking Alto Adige region of northern
Italy, had been an MEP since 1989 and was co-chairman of the 23-member
environmentalist group in the assembly with German Claudia Roth.
''We are all devastated by the tragic news,'' said Roth in a statement
from the European Parliament in Brussels.
''It is not yet and may never be possible to understand this terrible
end to such an outstanding life.''
One of the world's best-known environmentalists, Petra Kelly, and her
lover Gert Bastian ended their lives in a suicide pact in October, 1992.
Bastian, a former German army general turned pacifist, shot Kelly then
himself with a pistol in their Bonn home. Both were MPs. German
prosecutors said after an inquiry that they sealed their death pact for
personal reasons.
News of Langer's death reached the Italian Greens as leaders were
about to attend a news conference about a protest at the French embassy
in Rome against France's decision to resume nuclear testing in the South
Pacific.
''I don't understand what happened,'' said Carlo Ripa di Meana, leader
of the Italian Greens and a former European Commissioner.
''I spoke with him yesterday morning at about 11 o'clock. I didn't
detect anything in his voice. To me he seemed like someone immersed in
life,'' he said.
Irish Green deputy Nuala Ahern said Langer had recently visited
Ireland to learn about the peace process there. ''I'm overcome by the
news. He was a real peacemaker,'' she said.
Pauline Green, leader of the Socialists group, the European
Parliament's biggest, also paid tribute to Langer.
''Mr Langer was greatly respected by our members for his absolute
commitment and hard work in the cause of the environment and human
rights in particular,'' she said.--Reuter.

LAST night, the discussion concerning the leadership of the
Conservative Party was ended, and there can be no doubt that John Major
will lead us into the next General Election. It is clear that each side
has emerged from this contest with honour.
Mr Major has obtained 218 votes, which he rightly points out is more
than Margaret Thatcher obtained in the last leadership election.
However, Mr Redwood obtained 89 votes.
In the last fortnight, the Prime Minister has conducted himself with
vigour and good humour. He has demonstrated those qualities of detailed
and careful leadership which we have all come to expect from him.
There has been nothing new in the plans that he has put forward. It is
now plain that the Tory Party demands that there should be continuity of
leadership until the next General Election. This decision will be a
source of consolation and relief to many Tory voters throughout the
country.
Mr Redwood suffered under formidable disadvantages. First, unlike the
Prime Minister, he did not know that he would be fighting an election.
He had no team. He had no back-up.
However, there can be no doubt that on the central issue of this
election he provided much that was principled and thought-provoking.
There is a longing in the Tory Party for a clear statement of principle
on the single currency.
This longing was demonstrated in the famous meeting of the Fresh Start
Group. There, even those who in this election have supported the Prime
Minister were determined to argue for a clear statement of principle on
the single currency.
Yes, the leadership issue is settled but politics has not come to an
end. There will continue to be a lively discussion about our
relationship with Europe. We expect to be able to argue the issues of
principle about the reduction in sovereignty that may occur if we go
into a single currency in Europe.

SCOTTISH Enterprise has dropped job creation claims as the main plank
for justifying its existence as the country's leading agency charged
with generating employment and prosperity.
Another year of ''outstanding success'' was unveiled on publication of
its annual report yesterday -- but the usual claims of creating or
safeguarding jobs were, to all intents and purposes, missing.
Only figures for SE's inward investment arm, Locate in Scotland, were
recorded -- put at more than 12,000 created or safeguarded, its best
ever.
It was clear that the agency, with a #467m budget, also had taken into
account other matters of concern raised earlier this year by the
powerful Commons Scottish Affairs Committee, which included
accountability and secrecy in carrying out tasks.
The MPs' five-month inquiry followed The Herald publishing extensive
details of directors' interests in contracts and grants awarded by the
agency's network of 13 local enterprise companies.
The committee subsequently declined to accept SE's repeated claims of
creating 40,000 jobs a year, suggesting the true figure was between
16,000 and 20,000.
Chief executive Crawford Beveridge said a new, more rigorous system of
measuring job creation was being introduced -- and was loth to make
claims, or provide totals, until fully in place.
On producing the annual report, the agency also enclosed a code of
practice and, for the first time, published a register of interests of
board members.
It also announced that, from next year, the Lecs' accounts would be
consolidated within the agency's annual report. That should make it
easier to see where taxpayers' money is going. In addition, the agency
plans to list all grants and loans issued.
The register of interests showed that without exception the 14 board
members have other business or financial interests, with 13 also having
interests in publicly funded or representative bodies.
Meanwhile, the annual accounts showed that Pieda plc received
contracts to the value of #163,300 from the network, compared with
#494,000 the previous year. Professor Donald MacKay, the agency
chairman, is a director of Pieda.
The accounts also showed that firms with connections with two other
board members, Mr Tom Farmer and Professor John Shaw, had received more
than #11,000 in consultancy fees or property rentals.
Outstanding successes ranged from creating 5000 new business ventures
to securing #150m worth of exports for Scottish firms and #44m of
European funds for projects.
The agency was especially proud of efforts to improve training and
employment opportunities, and will over the next three years manage a
#34m Government training programme focused on ''skills''.
Professor MacKay later rejected allegations that the Glasgow
businessman and leading Tory fundraiser, Mr Jack Harvie, had received
preferential treatment in property and land deals with SE's predecessor,
the Scottish Development Agency.
The agency was adamant that sound reasons existed for extending loan
repayments after Mr Harvie's Citylink Development bought Merlin House
and a nearby plot of land at Hillington industrial estate in 1987.
These included costs associated with the discovery of asbestos at
Merlin House and delays in securing planning permission for the other
site.
Professor MacKay added that he would supply Shadow Scottish Secretary
George Robertson with full details of the deals, which will also be made
public, and added he was confident the loans would be repaid as
scheduled.
Asked about Mr Harvie's politics, he replied: ''I do not care if he
was a member of the Tory Party or the Monster Raving Looney Party or
both . . . what we judge is whether this kind of scheme should be
supported and this kind of company should be supported. The deals were
handled in an appropriate and professional manner.''
He believed the Health Care International hospital at Clydebank, which
cost taxpayers millions and promised 1800 jobs, would still be a
success.
Accounts show SE provided #4m in grants, and #1.4m in equity funding
-- with the latter already written off despite the Abu Dhabi takeover
after HCI went into receivership.
The accounts also show Mr Crawford's salary stands at #116,963, up
from #110,690 the previous year. He confirmed he would be entitled to a
bonus of up to 10%, subject to a performance review.
Labour MP Willie McKelvey, the Scottish Affairs Committee chairman,
said last night he welcomed signs that the agency was becoming more
open. He said the register of interests would also reduce apprehension,
fears, and gossip about the network's operations.
Scottish Industry Minister George Kynoch praised the vital
contribution the agency had made to the Scots economy. He said the
report reflected yet another successful year.

A PRIME MINISTER driven to seek a vote of confidence from his own
troops can't win. If it was tactically clever, the tactics were dictated
by desperation.
John Major has reached the winning line, but not safety. More than 100
of his colleagues refused to back him. His majority is made up of the
placemen, those promised places, those who want Michael Portillo but
think his time has yet to come, those who don't want Michael Heseltine.
Positive enthusiasm for Mr Major is a scarce commodity in Westminster.
Policy, not personality, lies at the heart of the matter. The party is
deeply and hopelessly split. Another dose of consensus politics, however
well intentioned, can't put it together again.
On Europe and a range of social and economic issues the Government is
left paralysed. The Redwood vote is alive and well, and a threat. Who
believes the Prime Minister can take a coherent leadership line at next
year's inter-governmental conference.
The Cabinet reshuffle will still be a survival exercise. A badly
wounded Prime Minister will have to offer rewards to his enemies. In
bitter times, appeasement chokes friends and can only encourage the
''bastard'' tendency.
Mr Forsyth at the Scottish Office amounts to an admission that the
height of Tory ambition is to claw back a little of the lost heartland
and evidence that Ian Lang has done enough under fire in the last
fortnight to earn his ticket of leave.
One of the Prime Minister's majority said last night that he was
voting for his man with a heavy heart to give him ''one last chance''.
In truth, the leadership contest has not been settled. It has been given
new momentum for the pundits and increasingly the Tory Party, the one
dominating question will be how to stop Michael Portillo when John
Major's interregnum limps to a close.

THROUGHOUT the days of the Tory leadership contest, there has been a
feeling of ''Gone With The Wind'' in the Scottish political air. The
best-ever exit line in film history must surely have been: ''Frankly my
dear, I don't give a damn.''
The number-crunching and rave reviews have hardly been drawing
capacity crowds. The electorate does not share the fevered egotism of
Westminster,
The plot was pretty thin. Both candidates adopted the narrow
pro-London view: ''Don't give any powers to Scotland and Wales, but
we're damned if we want any of these strange Europeans to dictate to
us.''
Leaving aside their paranoiac love of London as the centre of the
universe, and Westminster as the mother of democracies, there was little
choice in the substance of their scripts.
The tearoom was as chaotic as Atlanta during the American Civil War.
And the reality is the civil war in the Tory Party has not ended -- even
on American Independence Day.If John Major wanted to clear the air, it
is now even murkier than ever.
He called on his opponents to put up or shut up. They put up a
candidate but it is clear they will not now shut up. John Major has now
formalised the split in his own party and it will take more than this
technical victory to restore his authority.
The Scottish people will see this is no way to govern, or to meet the
challenges of the real world. They want a General Election.
This spectacle exemplifies all the vagaries of Westminster. The
Scottish people can only conclude that a parliament in Edinburgh is far
superior to a Tory farce in Westminster.

THIS election has shown little more than that John Major is a man Tory
MPs want to lead them to defeat at the next election. What the country
needed was a General Election so that we could all pass our verdict on
this exhausted and divided Government.
John Major called this election on his own initiative, at his own time
and as a matter of his own judgment. One third of Tory MPs have failed
to back him, and that must put his judgment into question.
Very little has been changed by this election. There are no new policy
initiatives. All that has been highlighted is the depth of the division
in the Tory Party.
I confidently predict a great show of unity over the next few weeks,
but such sticking plaster cannot conceal the real divisions for ever.
Scotland was effectively sidelined in this contest. John Redwood added
insult to injury when he referred to Britain as one nation with only one
language, one culture and one common law. It reflected the lack of
understanding of Scotland shared by so many in the Tory Party.
It is an insensitivity likely to be underlined by the imminent
appointment of Michael Forsyth as Scottish Secretary. While he at least
is sometimes prepared to listen to argument, his political baggage of
the poll tax and privatisation and his general ideological stance may
only alienate Scots voters further.
In short, a Prime Minister who some time ago lost the confidence of
the nation now struggles to retain the confidence of his own party.
Mr Major should take the only honourable course and give the people
their chance to voice their opinion at the ballot box.

WHILE the prime ministerial contenders were slugging it out over
arcane differences on the Europe question, one British builder was
longing for the introduction of a single European currency.
Steve Draper, of Lovell Espana, is a man in a hurry. After a sticky
period during the recession he has two upmarket developments in Spain to
market. But currency fluctuations and uncertainties about the pound are
not helping his business.
While long stretches of the Spanish coastline have been spoiled by
poor quality apartment developments, Draper claims his company is
providing something new.
While one development is perched high in the mountains with sweeping
views to the sea, the other is located on one of the most stylish parts
of the coast, close to Marbella.
During the heady days of the Eighties, when it seemed that the whole
of Europe was going through a property boom, Croydon-based Lovell Espana
decided to look for a place in the sun. But, like most other developers,
the firm got its fingers burned when the market overheated and many of
the properties at its two developments are now cheaper than they were in
1990.
On its hilltop eyrie, Puebla Aida has been designed to look like a
traditional Spanish pueblo. No two houses are the same, either inside or
out. even the chimneys are all different. Even the chimneys are all
different.
A team of traditional craftsmen works under the direction of a
designer. Local materials and techniques have been used throughout,
including old clay roof tiles, stained timber, hand-painted ceramics and
cool marble.
The development abounds with interesting little alleys, mysterious
staircases, open areas with swimming pools, broken up by the occasional
square with seats in the shade.
Everywhere is the sight and scent of bougainvillaea, hibiscus and
mimosa.
In some ways it is reminiscent of Portmeirion, the Welsh fantasy
village created by Clough Williams-Ellis which became the setting for
the cult TV series The Prisoner.
No one would feel locked in at Puebla Aida. Each house has its own
balcony, but most of them do not look like balconies. The designer
favours terraces built onto the roof of the house below, often linking
them with elegant little bridges.
The terraces offer tremendous views over the famous courses at Mijas
Golf to the sea at Marbella, about ten miles away.
Draper says: ''The village is about 50% occupied at any one time, and
around 25% of our purchasers live here permanently.''
For those who prefer the waterfront to the mountains, White Pearl
Beach is an upmarket development overlooking the sea near Marbella.
Inspired by the bullrings of Ronda and Seville, the circular design of
White Pearl Beach evokes the classical Andalucian style. Just over 100
garden apartments, most with views over the Mediterranean, surround a
natural arena of central water gardens and pools.
The environment offers an impressive security system with closed
circuit surveillance operating at all times and controlled entry. Most
apartments have separate laundry and utility rooms, each with washing
machine and dryer. All homes have satellite TV, radio and telephone
points, video entryphone, wall safe, and spa bath.
Every apartment has a built-in alarm system incorporating fire
warnings and emergency button linked to central control. A wide range of
nationalities is purchasing properties from Lovell Espana, and the two
developments are attracting different types of buyer.
Puebla Aida is favoured by UK, Swedish and German buyers in roughly
equal numbers. At White Pearl Beach most of the purchasers are German or
Spanish.
''Puebla Aida appeals more to the northern Europeans than to the
Spaniards,'' says Steve Draper. ''When Spaniards buy a second home they
want it to be right on the beach.''.
Neither of these developments is cheap. Prices at Puebla Aida range
from #69,500, while those at White Pearl Beach are from around #180,000.
Buyers should add a further 7% for VAT and about 2% for notary and land
registry costs.
Community charges at Puebla Aida cost around #700 per year, which pays
for all external maintenance of the buildings. Maintenance charges at
White Pearl Beach are between #2000 and #3000. Many of these costs can
be offset by letting the property out to holidaymakers.

DO standards really matter nowadays, in personal dealings, including
business and property matters? ''Of course they do. Most certainly,''
says Geraldina Cragg.
Celebrating 10 years in her Business and Property Bureau in Bearsden,
means celebrating 10 years of high standards, she points out.
''In fact, I can say I have turned down more business than I have
accepted,'' she adds. ''That's not being crazy. That's looking after my
clients' interests.
''When people need to live abroad, as many do nowadays, they are
actually more concerned with the care given to their home and
furnishings than getting the highest possible income.''
That's why the Bureau takes on as tenants only people who can be
trusted to look after a property as if it were their own. That's why a
deposit, and suitable references, are sought.
''It's not all one way,'' Geraldina adds. ''People should be assured
there are rules and regulations, looking after their interests as
tenants.''
In simple terms, a residential property has to be in a fit state for
habitation. Gas appliances have to be safe. Electrical appliances have
to be safe. Even furniture has to be safe.
''The situation is a bit complex,'' Geraldina points out, ''and there
will always be cowboys ready to exploit people. But the good estate
agents know what is needed, and are happy to meet the requirements.
''It is so important that tenants are protected. Granted it means
extra paperwork for us, but it is well worth it. Steer clear of the
cowboys and the fly-by-nights.
''What it comes to is knowing you are dealing with people you can
trust, for both sides. Ask around. See who gives a good deal, has local
knowledge. Word of mouth is as good a recommendation as any.''
What, then, would Geraldina recommend? Out of the top drawer comes a
new detached villa in the Baljaffray area of Bearsden. Five bedrooms and
three public rooms, plus three bathrooms and a patio door to the garden.
For this upmarket property, #1600 a month.
Going to the St Germains area of the district brings a selection of
flats. Typically #900#-1200 gets a lounge/dining room, good size
kitchen, two or three bedrooms - usually with master en suite - and
separate shower room. Central heating, and single garage.
Jordanhill has the same kind of ambience. There, a semi-detached
stone-built villa gives lots of space for a good-size family. Three
public rooms, large family kitchen, shower room, four bedrooms and
bathroom on the first floor. Two further rooms on the floor above. Gas
central heating. Ample parking in the driveway. Say, #1500 a month.
Or a flat in Kelvinside, perhaps. Look to pay around #750 and expect:
a first-floor flat with lounge/dining room, fully fitted kitchen, two
bedrooms - master with en suite shower room - and separate bathroom. Gas
central heating, underground garaging.
Alternatively, a ground floor flat in traditional style, with lounge,
kitchen, dining room, two bedrooms, two bathrooms. Gas central heating.
There are flats in Hyndland too, in the #650-#700 range. You get
lounge, kitchen with open plan dining area, two bedrooms and bathroom.
Gas central heating and off-street parking.
Or lounge/dining area, two double bedrooms - one with en suite shower
- fully fitted kitchen, and bathroom. Gas central heating and private
parking.

YESTERDAY'S result was a stunning victory for the Prime Minister --
bringing together all sections of the Conservative Party: more than 90%
of Conservative constituency associations and a 2-1 majority in the
parliamentary party. Yesterday the divisions, speculation, and
uncertainty that has plagued the party for months was brought to an end.
In calling a leadership contest, John Major acted with his customary
determination and guts. Some have said that throwing down the gauntlet
was a mistake, a fatal tactical error. Yet he was right to do so. For
months the important business of government and the success of our
policies were being obscured by rumour, whispers, and uncertainty.
Far from being an error of judgment, the decision has proved to be
inspired leadership. Over the past 10 days the party and the country
have seen the real John Major: the fighter and the winner. If any had
forgotten just why we won the last General Election, this week reminded
them.
Yesterday the parliamentary party delivered the result activists
wanted -- a ringing endorsement of John Major's leadership. Now all
sections of the party, in Parliament and in the constituencies, will
unite foursquare behind our leader. Now all our attentions will be
turned towards fighting the Labour Party and the SNP.
In speaking to my constituency association in South Aberdeen the day
after the Prime Minister made his announcement I said that the madness
of the past 18 months must end. Yesterday, the Conservative Party
consigned that period of rancour and indiscipline to the history books.
I do believe that yesterday the madness ended.

FORMER world-indoor bowls champion Hugh Duff and Scottish team-mate
David Miller were sent home from the Home International Championships in
Wales yesterday after being found guilty of breaking a drinks curfew.
However, the players last night claimed they may have been ''set up''
to prevent their selection for the forthcoming World Championship.
Both players were ruled to have broken a midnight curfew imposed by
team manager Gordon Neil after apparently being caught drinking in a
hotel bar in Llanelli in the small hours of Monday morning.
Later that day, when the Scots played the English in the first round
of the Home Championships, they were beaten 135-103.
Duff, 32, and Miller, 27, could now be banned from the Scottish squad
for up to three years.
Duff had returned to the national squad after a five-year absence, and
was regarded by most observers of the sport as a sure selection.
However, it appears this view was not universal. Miller's chances of
selection were less clear cut.
Asked last night to respond to the accusation of a ''set-up'',
Scottish Bowling Association officials refused to comment.
Mr Neil, the manager, took the unusual stance of imposing the curfew
on his players at their Welsh hotel before the tournament began.
Mr Neil said: ''I'm bitterly disappointed at the action of the two
players concerned. Given the circumstances, the selection committee were
left with no alternative but to take the course they did.''
Mr Bob Colthard, Scottish Bowling Association president, said:
''Players were told to be in their rooms by midnight on Sunday, as we
had an important match against England the following day.
''It transpires that Duff and Miller both reappeared in the hotel bar
around 1am and continued drinking for some time.''
The SBA's decision was also backed by captain Richard Corsie. He said:
''All of the players are 100% behind Gordon Neil and the selection
committee. I feel personally let down by the actions of Duff and
Miller.''
Mr David Bell, a committee member of Cumbernauld Indoor Bowls rink --
where Duff is the manager -- and Scottish Indoor Bowls association
representative, said he was shocked at the actions of the two
Cumbernauld players.
''I am particularly surprised that David Miller should do something
like that,'' he said.
''As for Hugh, he is the manager here, and although this is an outdoor
bowls matter I really don't know how it may affect his job with us until
we have heard the full circumstances of what happened.''
A spokesman for Cumbernauld outdoor bowls club said he was also unsure
whether Duff would face disciplinary action from the club upon his
return.
But Duff, who took part in the match against England on Monday, said
he played ''really well, giving his all'' and was not affected by any
late-night drinking.
''There is no way I was even drunk on Sunday night,'' he said. ''When
I go out to play for Scotland I give 150%, and I would never do anything
to jeopardise my chances.
''I had a good drink on Sunday night -- but I wasn't the only one
drinking -- and went up to my room before midnight.
''I came down again to telephone my girlfriend. But the phone was in
use, and while I was waiting I joined a friend in the lounge -- we
weren't out of order in any way.''
He said he was bitterly disappointed to be sent home, and felt the
whole affair had been blown out of all proportion.
''I didn't set out intentionally to break the rules, but have to
accept I signed a Code of Conduct before the championships,'' he said.
He said it was only after the England match that he and Miller were
ordered home by the SBA management.
''I am still very upset and can't sleep thinking about it all. I have
played internationally for 12 years and nothing like this has ever
happened before.
''It was only on the way home that David suggested we may have been
set up as the selection for the World Championship in Adelaide is due to
take place soon, and there are only five places up for grabs.''
However, one former internationalist said the players could expect to
be ''hauled over the coals'' when they returned.
Ayrshire bowler John Fullarton was sent home in disgrace from a
Scottish indoor match in Aberdeen in 1987 for drunken behaviour. He was
suspended from the Scottish team for three years.

Malcolm Dickson finds little comfort for the Conservatives in the
events
of the past week
JOHN MAJOR'S victory has assured his survival as Prime Minister, at
least for the moment. However, his desire to have the ''air cleared'' at
Westminster may not have been fulfilled. The divisions that have been
bitterly paraded on our television screens over the past week will not
simply disappear, no matter how much authority Mr Major may now seem to
have.
It is clear that the authority the Prime Minister commands within the
parliamentary party is broadly similar to that which existed before this
leadership contest began.
In numerical terms, Mr Major has succeeded in capturing a larger share
of the votes of MPs than Margaret Thatcher did in 1975 when she saw off
Ted Heath, Douglas Hurd and Willie Whitelaw over two ballots.
Mrs Thatcher finally won with a small overall majority of 53% of her
parliamentary colleagues. However, that was when the Conservatives were
in Opposition. When John Major won in 1990, he commanded slightly fewer
votes (185) than his two rivals Michael Heseltine (131) and Douglas Hurd
(56) put together. However, on both of these occasions it was the
challenger, or the alternative, who won.
John Major wryly pointed out during a well-received performance in
Parliament last Thursday that 40% of the possible electorate had not
voted for Tony Blair in last year's Labour leadership contest. However,
Mr Blair was not attempting to hold on to the post of Prime Minister.
Comparisons with previous leadership contests on both sides of Commons
leave yesterday's result looking not too bad for Mr Major. However,
questions remain. Is the support of two-thirds of the parliamentary
party enough to provide effective government for the next eighteen
months?
Does the fact that 89 MPs voted for an alternative leader rather than
simply abstaining leave a cloud over the Prime Minister's position? And
after the dust has settled, does this all leave the Tories better placed
to win the General Election?
Mr Redwood has commanded enough support to see the mutterings
continue.
The executive of the backbench 1922 committee already has attempted to
rule out a further challenge in the autumn. Whether it would be willing
to refuse a challenger with sufficient nominations is another thing.
Technically, it would be obliged to run a new ballot. Even if this
proves not to transpire, Mr Major undoubtedly has been wounded.
His best strategy may be to follow the example of his precedessor in
1986. By mid-1986, Mrs Thatcher had survived several months of
backbiting and questions about her hold on government in the wake of the
Westland affair, which had seen the resignation of two Cabinet Ministers
in Michael Heseltine and Leon Brittan.
It was at this point that Mrs Thatcher effectively called a General
Election for a year's time in 1987 by responding to a research document
from Saatchi and Saatchi which suggested that the public perception of
her leadership had hit the rocks. The outcome was to bring renegade Tory
MPs back into line in the run-up to the 1987 election.
Mr Major really must do something similar. Yet in electoral terms the
news is far more bleak than it was for Mrs Thatcher in 1986. In the
second quarter of 1986, published polls by Mori, Gallup and Marplan
showed an average 6% lead for Labour over the Tories. This was clawed
back by October.
Now, Mr Major's party still lags around 30 to 35% behind Labour and
has done so for a worryingly long period. The leadership election is
unlikely to alter this, although a short-term fluctuation in Tory
fortunes for the better is probable over the coming month.
Any prospect of a snap General Election will certainly evaporate if
the Conservatives' poll rating remains below 20% nationally over the
next two months. Even if Tony Blair forces a no confidence vote in the
Commons, it is highly unlikely that those Tory MPs who did not support
Mr Major in yesterday's ballot would not then support the Government.
In fact, Mr Major was well placed with an actual lead during the
months of the Gulf war in 1991. Yet even in late 1991 when Labour was
ahead again, it was only by an average of 2 to 3%. That lead evaporated
into an eight-point defeat in the General Election of 1992.
Today's position is fundamentally weaker for the Conservatives. They
trail not only on possible vote share, but also on leadership
popularity, on economic competence and in other areas.
It is hard to discern comfort for the Conservatives in the events of
the past week. They may have bought Mr Major time with his party; but
with an electorate that sees problems in almost every key area of
Government policy, the recipe of ''no change'' that Mr Major campaigned
on can hardly do much to satisfy the spin doctors of Tory Party Central
Office, let alone the voters
It is still John Major's firm belief that his policies will win in the
end. However, with public sector pay problems looming, with strong
pressure for tax cuts in the November Budget, with the divide on Europe
still very much there, Mr Major faces a winter as cold and potentially
cruel as any seen by Good King Wenceslas.

PART-exchange in homebuying may still be an unfamiliar concept for
many families on the move but it is a concept which keeps growing.
''Our figures for the past year show that 20% of Wimpey Homes'
business in Scotland was linked to our Keychange part-exchange scheme,''
said Ian Brown, regional sales and marketing director at Wimpey Homes
Scotland West.
''In fact, we have offered this scheme to customers for the past 12
years. It was primarily introduced to combat the difficult market
conditions at that time. Today we see it as being part of the housing
business, and it is here to stay.''
Keychange has the basic target of freeing potential housebuyers from
all the worry of selling their own home. It is one of three assisted
packages operated by Wimpey to serve customers. The second is Keymove,
an assisted sales scheme operated through a leading estate agent, where
the customers are free to change their minds if the existing home does
not sell within eight weeks. The third is Keystart, a special first-time
buyer's package including free survey fees and free solicitor's fees up
to #500.
Under the Keychange exchange plan the criteria operated can vary and
the offer made depends upon the property involved. Wimpey Homes will
consider buying a customer's property provided that its value is not
more than 70% of the price of the new Wimpey home.
''The scheme has proved so popular with the public that we have now
opened an office in Renfrew to cope specifically with the demand that
exists,'' said Ian Brown. Located at 1B Paisley Road, the shop-office is
the first time that Wimpey has invested in a high street shop front.
Potential customers can visit and discuss the possibility of entering
into a part-exchange agreement.

IN the end it was the refrigeration engineer who on a hot day voiced
the chill will which the Scottish public has for the Prime Minister.
Mr Jimmy McTear, 25, broke away from his pint in Glasgow's Horseshoe
Bar to play to perfection the role of the political pundit.
When asked his opinion on the returned leader of the Conservative
Pary, he replied: ''John Major? Have you seen the comedy Airplane? Well
he's Ted Striker a man capable of boring you to death and that's what he
has done. He remains, but without charisma, or pzazz, just his grey
suit.''
Shortly before 5.30 pm yesterday, the pub populace were performing the
difficult art of sipping with their heads back as eyes were glued to the
TV reports on the leadership election. No one spilled a drop, but then
no-one seemed particularly bothered.
There was certainly no pints spat out in shock as John Major was
returned, in fact it seemed to satisfy the supporters of both the Labour
Party and Conservative Party. To the left it was the return of the man
they believe will lose the next election. To the right it was a
respectable pay-off for a brave gamble.
Neil Mulholland, 21, a student in art history, felt the affair was
anti-democratic, with the Conservatives wracked by infighting. However,
he was relieved that Major had not been ousted. ''I want somebody who
will lose the next election.
''What we don't want is somebody fresh-faced who the public can take
seriously, like Heseltine. That was what happened last time. Thatcher
went out, Major came in, and they won the last election. That,
unfortunately could happen again.''
The sound of a resounding victory rang in the ears of the pub's
manager for the past 12 years, Dave Smith. He believed Mr Major kept his
nerve and won a war with dignity. ''Look, he won by around two-thirds
which is more than Tony Blair was elected with. . . the green shots of
recovery are here. We can see them in the pub.
''The economy is definitely on the turn, people are spending more in
the pubs. I was manager here under a Labour government. Twelve years ago
we took about #5000 a week. Now we take in #45,000. I think people will
respect Major more after this.''
Another Conservative, Mr Andrew Logan, 30, who works for Oddbins, felt
that though Major had survived a five-year spell in opposition would be
beneficial. ''There are too many tired old men in the Cabinet.''
His workmate, Roddy MacInnes, 23, was convinced the affair was a PR
stunt which has backfired. ''We now have a Prime Minister with less than
half the support of the House of Commons. What is going on?''
Abuse towards the only Prime Minster was the contribution by a crowd
of annoymous young people at the back of the bar. ''He is a wee squeaky
mouse'', ''Useless'', ''Don't vote, it just encourages them.''
Mr John Redwood, far from being praised as a potential new leader, was
ignored as  a plastic fall-guy. No one seemed to want a second ballot,
no one seemed to care. The results had been announced and now there were
pints to be bought.
Stuart Winning, 53, who said his business had been wiped out under the
Conservative Government,  dismissed the whole affair as meaningless.
''Anything that happens down there will have no relevance up here. We
simply do not exist.''

PLANS by the new laird of Eigg to develop environmentally sensitive
tourism projects and to allow estate tenants to buy their homes have
been welcomed by islanders.
On a flying visit, Professor Marlin Eckhard Maruma, a German artist
who is known simply as Maruma, told a residents' meeting he would be
seeking a way for everyone to buy their house.
''Everything he proposed was favourably received by the local people.
It was all that people would want,'' said the secretary of the
residents' association, Mrs Karen Helliwell.
She said Maruma was also setting up over the next six months a
database of the island's agriculture, forestry, and tourism.
''He is interested in developing soft tourism but only a certain
amount aimed at people who are particularly interested in a place with
this kind of environment,'' she said.
''It will be a case of taking decisions on the scale and type of
development but at the moment he is talking about employing a Swiss guy
who has done this sort of thing before -- tourism environmental impact
studies and studies on the impact on the local population.
''He does appear to be prepared to take our views on that into
account. The main feature of the place is its wilderness and
environment. If you flood it with tourists, that would ruin it.''
She added Maruma was considering a new catamaran ferry service but
there was no question of island traffic being allowed to increase.

IN the heart of Edinburgh's business community, reaction to Mr Major's
victory was swift and to the point.
The lawyers, architects, and businessmen who gathered in one of the
city's trendy West End bars believed it would not make any difference to
the Tories future election chances, particularly in Scotland.
They were certain Labour would romp to victory, regardless of who was
at the helm of the Conservative Party. Widely-expected changes in the
Tory hierarchy north of the Border would not have any positive effect
either.
Those in Ryan's bar, the in-place for young, professional business
people in the capital, glanced up only momentarily from their pints when
the result came through on television.
Up until then the talk in Ryan's, just off Charlotte Square, had been
of Wimbledon and the chances of Steffi Graf in the women's singles
quarter-final which was being shown on the other channel.
Now they turned their attention to that other head-to-head battle
between Mr Major and Mr Redwood. When the result came through, one wag
said the contest between the two had been as unexciting and as grey as
Mr Major himself.
One lone Conservative supporter, out of the 30 or so drinkers who
watched the result, avidly tied his colours to the mast.
Mr Adrian Hanger, 25, an Edinburgh hotel manager, said he was pleased
that Mr Major had won the election battle by what he saw as a creditable
margin.
Mr Hanger, who has swung back to supporting the Tories over the last
two years, said: ''I'm glad this is over now. By this time next month,
us Tories will have forgotten this happened and will be back fully
supporting Mr Major.
''I am pleased he won the vote but am realistic enough to accept it
won't make any difference to any General Election result.
''As far as Scotland is concerned, whoever is in charge of the party
wouldn't have made any difference up here.''
Mr David Edwards, 44, an architect, said the battle for control of the
Conservative Party would come to a head after the General Election.
When asked what difference Mr Redwood would have made to Scotland, Mr
Edwards said: ''Speaking as a non-Tory voter, I don't see he would have
made any difference. People up here see him as an English anti-European
Tory.''
Mr Jim Gunn, 58, who has a structural engineering business in Glasgow
and Edinburgh, believed there was a hidden agenda behind the election
battle.
Mr Gunn said: ''I believe that people like Mr Heseltine and Mr
Portillo miscalculated. They got it wrong thinking there would be a
second ballot in the leadership race.''
Mr Scott McCauley, 24, a Labour supporter from Renfrew, said Mr
Major's win would make no difference to Scotland.
Mr McCauley said: ''Labour will win the next election so it never
really mattered much who would be the leader of the Tory party. I don't
think Mr Major's win will mean a new start for the Tories.''

A SHERIFF heard yesterday that a Roman Catholic priest had forgiven a
young woman who had defrauded him of more than #600 and was allowing her
to pay him back by cleaning his house.
Sheriff Roger Craik fined Susan Gilfillan #150 after reading a letter
to Edinburgh Sheriff Court from 84-year-old Canon Hugh Gordon.
The sheriff said that, although 23-year-old Gilfillan's crimes had
been serious offences of dishonesty, he could be lenient. ''You have
been of good behaviour and Canon Gordon seems to have forgiven you,'' he
told Gilfillan, of Park View, Newcraighall.
Solicitor Brian Gilfedder said: ''The priest seems to be more
concerned with her moral welfare rather than getting the money back.''
The depute procurator-fiscal, Ms Alison Brown, said that Gilfillan was
introduced to Canon Gordon by a friend, because he was concerned with
helping young people.
The priest had given Gilfillan #648 when she said she had received a
wages cheque which she could not cash. The cheque she gave him in return
was stolen.
Gilfillan encouraged him to hand over his cash by saying she had been
threatened with violence unless she came up with #300 quickly.
Gilfillan admitted stealing five cheques from a house in Fraserburgh
between October and November 1993, getting money from Canon Gordon by
fraud in November 1993, and stealing a giro cheque in Portobello in
January 1994.
The case had been deferred for several months.
Mr Gilfedder said that Gilfillan had a bad drug problem at the time
but had made considerable progress towards dealing with it since.
After the case, Canon Gordon, who is chaplain of St Joseph's House, a
home for the elderly, said: ''Jesus tells me to forgive and that's what
I did.''
Last week, Gilfillan had approached him and offered to clean his house
regularly.
He said: ''I suppose she's grateful. I live alone and she thought the
house could do with a bit of cleaning.
''There were plenty of young tearaways in my last parish in
Linlithgow. I worked with them because my aim is to keep people out of
court and out of prison. That leads to them making bad companions and it
costs an awful lot of public money.''

Firmly established as a permanent aspect of the modern house market
theme, part-exchange has become a valued option to many a family as they
seek a worry-free path through the uncertainties which can lie in wait
on the way to a dream home.
The reasons are not hard to find. One prominent Scottish builder
describes part-exchange as a ''valuable back-stop scheme, offering
welcome security to the purchaser, and giving builders a similarly
positive view of their market ahead.''
Said another, ''The reason that part-exchange can work to such
advantage for both the customer and the builder is that builders are
using their knowledge of the property market to overcome the delays in
the sale of the original home caused by slow market conditions or by
property not being marketed to the best advantage.''
Sale figures from one new and popular West of Scotland housing estate
show that in one recent period, over a quarter of the houses sold either
involved part-exchange or had part-exchange option figures requested
along the way towards a sale.
Part-exchange options involve one-to-one situations between customer
and builder, each agreement being reached on an individual basis. But in
most cases the customer is asked to state what price is expected for the
existing family home and this is followed by the builder then arranging
for two valuations to be carried out, one by an estate agent and one by
a building society. The part-exchange price offered is an average
between these two figures.
''It has to be said that often the customer is trying to sell his
existing property at an unrealistically high figure,'' said a Glasgow
estate agent involved. ''That has to be understood and accepted in any
part-exchange negotiation.''
Part-exchange schemes usually operate best for the customer who is
''trading up'' to a more valuable property.
On the one hand, part-exchange values offered may be slightly less
than a lucky seller might obtain in the uncertainties of the open
market. But as a back-stop scheme, which can often be negotiated months
ahead of the new house purchase, it can remove much of the worry and
hassle from moving house and save the seller much of the money involved
in the ordinary selling process.

HAS John Major's gamble paid off? Was it worthwhile? Some gamblers
stake their all on winning big; some to keep a roof over their head.
Mr Major has kept the roof of No 10 over his head until the next
election. He has certainly not won big.
No spin doctor in the world can conceal that just under a third of his
parliamentary party has refused to back him.
So is he just back where he started in the Downing Street rose garden?
Then, we knew that about a third of his MPs were disaffected. Now, the
figures confirm it.
He is undoubtedly better off than he would have been had he waited
until November. With Labour likely to be still well ahead in the polls,
another by-election defeat recorded at Littleborough and Saddleworth and
the General Election at most 18 months away, dissatisfaction with him
and the fear of losing their seats among MPs in the 5000 to 10,000
majority range, strengthened the chances that a challenge would have
been successful.
Knowing that, he caught his MPs on the hop, invited them to take the
decision earlier than they expected and probably retained 20 or 30 votes
which might have slipped out of his reach in November.
One former Cabinet Minister has remarked that the thing that frightens
him most about his fellow Tory MPs is that they are still not as
frightened as they should be about losing the next election. ''They
still think some tax cuts in two Budgets will swing the voters back to
us and they're probably wrong.''
A properly frightened parliamentary party would have ditched Mr Major
and gone for Mr Heseltine with whom a deal on Europe by the right wing
would, apart from personal paranoia on the part of some Euro-sceptics,
have been perfectly possible.
But even a wrong-footed parliamentary party gave surprisingly strong
support to John Redwood. When close supporters on the eve of polling
gave 80 as their idea of his best shot they were not being
Machiavellian.
A couple confided that something in the 60s was likely given that
several Euro-sceptics had decided to stay with Mr Major for fear of Mr
Heseltine. Mr Redwood's strong showing means that the Prime Minister
will have to remain a Euro-sceptic rather than his natural pragmatic
self up to and through the next election.
The Redwood campaign faded after a brilliant debut and was hurt by its
failure to produce any converts from the upper echelons of the party. Mr
Major may receive some respite if the right starts squabbling over
whether Mr Redwood or Michael Portillo should be their standard-bearer.
If Mr Redwood is not readmitted to the Cabinet he will be in a better
position to play the part from the back benches. The Prime Minster might
feel it safer to include him, although one person who talked with him
recently said he was so fed up with Euro-sceptic attacks on him that he
did not feel inclined to make any more concessions to them.
Perhaps the supreme irony of this contest lay in Mr Major's claim to
be the only man able to unite the party which, as the opposition parties
have delightedly spectated, has in the last fortnight quarrelled with
almost unprecedented fury in public.
In some television and radio leadership contest programmes involving
grass roots Tories it was sometimes difficult to believe they all
belonged to the same party. Mr Major thought that a price worth paying
and, considering what a second round scrap between Mr Heseltine, Mr
Redwood and Mr Portillo would have involved, he might have been right.
At least he does not engender hate in his own ranks.
Apart from a Redwood win, yesterday provided Tony Blair's dream
result. A bewildered, factious Conservative Party, divided even about
the causes of their unpopularity, have ended up wounding but not
assassinating their leader.
They are now, barring accidents, stuck with him until the next
election. But their performance while the contest raged offered little
evidence that any show of unity can be long maintained.
Mr Major's gamble on keeping his job has paid off. The success or
otherewise of the party's gamble in keeping him on will be answered by
the voters.

UNLIKE most country houses with a historic and literary connection,
which are usually well outwith the price range of most of us, a cottage
once owned by diarist James Boswell is on the market at a fairly modest
price.
Boswell inherited Auchinleck House Estate after his father died in
1782 and spent the last 13 years of his life there.
They were unlucky years. His great friend Samuel Johnson died in 1784,
and seven years later Boswell's wife Margaret also died. Boswell's
attempts to carve out a new political career were not successful and he
struggled to write a biography of Johnson.
Five years before his own death in 1795, Barnsdale Cottage was built
on the Auchinleck estate. In 1815 the cottage, at that time thatched,
was converted to house a printing press in 1815 by his son Alexander.
At one time MP for Ayrshire, Alexander Boswell was a poet and he used
the press to publish his own works and republish many of the old Scots
classics.
In 1816 he wrote Skeldon Haughs or the Sow is Flitted, published by A
&amp; J Boswell at Barnsdale Cottage. In a poem called On Erecting a
Printing Press at Barnsdale Poultry Yard, the younger Boswell celebrates
the labour-saving benefits of new technology for writers of the day:
Sires of the typographic skill
Who sav'd us from the sluggish quill
And gave the faculty to mind,
To body hitherto confin'd
And more - its offspring never die
But live, increase, and multiply.
Great Fust and Guttenberg renown'd!
If thy proud spirits hover round
Frown not that in this lowly shade
We profit by thy wond'rous aid.
The cottage stands in 1.85 ares of wooded ground overlooking the
Dippol Burn. It has three reception rooms, two bedrooms and bathroom,
partly-walled garden, garage and stores. It is remarkably unspoiled and
is listed Category B as being of special architectural and historic
importance.
Cluttons is asking for offers over #90,000.

<HEADLINE>Opposition parties say result leaves Major as lame-duck Premier until election. Scots Tories hail outcome</HEADLINE>

THE consensus among Scots Opposition leaders last night was that John
Major had been left as a lame-duck Premier as a result of a third of his
MPs failing to support him.
However, their war-cries and demands for an early General Election
came across as somewhat muted in contrast to the celebrations of the
Scottish Tory hierarchy, which breathed a collective sigh of relief at
the outcome.
Party chairman Sir Michael Hirst said: ''Once again, the Prime
Minister has confounded the political pundits and has won a ringing
endorsement for his leadership. His level of support was substantially
higher than Tony Blair has received from the Labour Party.''
He added that the last fortnight had shown Mr Major as a ''bold and
courageous leader who is determined to stand up and defend what he truly
believes in.''
Now these talents could be focused on attacking Labour, Liberal and
Nationalist opponents whose policies would destroy the UK and bring
economic decay.
Sir Michael said: ''History shows that there is one political lesson.
Disunited parties have no electoral appeal. The critics have had a clear
opportunity to put forward their alternative agenda and that has been
rejected. The party must now unite and rally behind the Prime
Minister.''
However, Labour scorned the parallel of Mr Blair's support, with
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson pointing out that a mass
membership had decided on their leader, in contrast to ''300 squabbling
back benchers.''
He added: ''This election has spotlighted a Government in permanent
disarray and incapable of running the country. The indecent exposure of
Tory splits will linger in the public mind and John Major will never
recover.
''The divisions within the Conservative Party are irreconcilable. The
public will not be fooled by post-election Tory shows of unity.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond said Mr Major had merely bought himself a stay
of execution, arguing that it would be naive to expect more than a
hundred party dissidents to shut up. ''What Scotland wants is a General
Election so that the people can pass their verdict on the Government and
drive them out of office once and for all.''
He added: ''This Westminster spectacle started as high drama and has
now degenerated into farce.'' Mr Jim Wallace, leader of the Scottish
Liberal Democrats said of Mr Major's failure to secure the support of a
third of his MPs: ''Whatever kind of spin the Prime Minister's campaign
may try to put on this, the fact remains that he is damaged goods.
Perhaps not damaged enough to go, but sufficiently damaged to ensure
that Britain is led by a lame- duck Prime Minister until the next
election.''
This was echoed by the Scottish TUC, where deputy general secretary
Bill Speirs said the Premier's authority had gone. ''If he tries to limp
on, it will only mean continued confusion and misery for the country. It
is clearly now time for the people to cast the votes that really matter,
in a General Election.''
However, Glasgow Chamber of Commerce called for a period of stability.
''John Major must now listen to the voice of the business community and
act on it if he wants to win the next election,'' said chief executive
Geoff Runcie.
Grassroots supporters across Scotland welcomed the outcome --
including in North Tayside, whose MP Bill Walker was the only Scottish
Conservative MP to publicly support Mr Redwood.
Mr Charles Cormack, vice-chairman of the North Tayside Tories, said:
''He made his decision and he was proved wrong. He was in the minority
as I always said he was. I'm just very relieved that John Major has
won.''
Mr Cormack said there was a fairly committed group within the party
who were still looking to unseat Mr Walker but he did not believe there
was any likelihood of that succeeding, and called for unity.
Mrs Jane Slater, constituency party chairman for Edinburgh West, the
seat held by Lord James Douglas Hamilton, said the reult was an
overwhelming endorsement of John Major's leadership. ''We are very
pleased he has been so well supported. We were fully behind him all the
time.
The ballot had helped clear the air, she said. ''I hope the party will
now pull together.''
Mr Robert Bell, constituency party chairman for Edinburgh Pentlands,
which returns Mr Malcolm Rifkind, said: ''We supported John Major as an
association and are pleased to see him re-elected. With the election
over, I think the party should unite behind him and continue with his
policies.''
Mr Ritchie Robertson, chairman of the Stirling Conservative and
Unionist Association in Michael Forsyth's constituency, said :''I'm
absolutely delighted with the result. Our Conservative association
wanted it, Michael Forsyth wanted it, and we backed him very strongly on
that.
''Unity is what we need and must now have.''
Mr Robertson declined to speculate on Mr Major's Cabinet reshuffle and
the implications for Scottish Secretary Ian Lang and for Mr Forsyth, who
some believe will be promoted to Scottish Secretary if Mr Lang is moved
elsewhere.
He said: ''I know no more than anyone else about what the Prime
Minister will do but Michael Forsyth is an outstanding constituency MP
and if he was promoted in any way we would be delighted.''
Mr John Duncan, constituency party chairman in George Kynoch's
Kincardine and Deeside, said: ''I think this result makes John Major a
lot stronger than he was before and that the rest of the members who
were against him must now give him their full backing in the fight
against the real opposition that is the Labour Party.''
Mr Duncan said that he would not have welcomed Mr Redwood becoming
Prime Minister and he disclosed that a number of local association
members had threatened to resign if there had been a change of leader.
''People felt that John Redwood was a little too far to the right for
them and would not have been able to unite the party because of his
right-wing stance.''
Former Scottish Office Minister Allan Stewart's constituency chairman
in Eastwood was also delighted with the result.
Mr Ian Muir said: ''I would have liked Mr Major to have got more than
230 votes but I thought that he would fall short of that. The important
thing was that we got this over with in one go.''
Mr John Findlay, constituency party chairman for Ayr, the seat held by
Phil Gallie, said he was more than happy with the result of the ballot.
''John Redwood had new ideas but you can't change tactics in
mid-stream. The party wil now get together to attack Labour and not
ourselves.''
The feeling was mirrored by the South Aberdeen Conservative
Association, whose MP is Raymond Robertson.
Councillor Marjorie Graham, the association's deputy chairman, said:
''This result proves beyond doubt that John Major is the man to unify
the Conservative Party and lead us to a fifth successive General
Election victory. I am delighted with the result.''

Brussels
MRS Pauline Green, leader of the European Parliament's 221-strong
socialist group, dismissed Mr Major's victory, claiming: ''This proves
the point that what is really needed in Britain is a General Election.
''We expect hostilities to break out in the Conservative Party very
soon. They are still deeply divided on Europe.
''This vote and a Cabinet reshuffle will not be enough to save John
Major's skin. The fact that more than 100 MPs -- a third of those voting
-- didn't want him to stay in office shows how mortally wounded he is.
''European socialists are very worried about the direction in which
Major will now take the Conservative Party on Europe. If he now begins
to pander to the Euro-sceptic backwoodsmen in his ranks, he will be
selling out the best interests of both Britain and Europe.''
However, Conservative Euro MPs celebrated the leadership result,
insisting John Major was the right man to represent Britain in Europe.
All 18 Tory MEPs, including a handful of the most Euro-sceptic, had
publicly pledged their support for Mr Major before the vote.
There was delight in Brussels when news of the result came through in
the middle of a meeting with Britain's departing ambassador to the
European Union, Sir John Kerr.
The chairman of the Euro Tories, Tom Spencer (Surrey) said: ''We are
all delighted. We were 100% behind John Major. We hope that the party
will now rally behind him.
''It seems to us that this is the right decision. It has no affect at
all on the Conservative Euro MPs.''
One of the group's most Euro-sceptic members, Giles Chichester (Devon
and East Plymouth) agreed it was the right result. He said: ''I do not
think John Redwood was a serious candidate. I hope now that Mr Major can
bridge the party extremes on Europe. He stands for majority opinion in
the party and the country. I wish him well.''
However, there was also frustration that Tory MEPs, unlike their
Labour counterparts, are denied a say in the leadership.
Anne McIntosh (Essex North and Suffolk South) said she wanted to see
changes made so that Euro MPs could have a say in such elections in
future.
''After all, this was an election very much about Europe and we Euro
MPs were left on the side lines,'' she said.

THE Prime Minister was in no doubt when he emerged from Downing Street
about what yesterday's result meant. Tory MPs had made up their own
minds, not had it made up for them by the media.
Britain's traditional true-blue newspapers were in little doubt as to
what was needed in the advice they offered Conservative MPs in the
run-up to yesterdays' leadership election. It was time for a change.
But that advice was rejected by the majority of those it was intended
for.
With 218 votes, the Prime Minister hailed the result as ''clear cut'',
said the issue of the leadership was settled up to and beyond the next
election, the time for division was over, and the matter now was
concluded.
''Let me just say one thing in conclusion,'' he said. ''This election
has been decided by Members of Parliament in Westminster, not
commentators outside Westminster with their own particular views. I
believe that is the right democratic way to determine these elections.''
Given what the Tory press have been saying, those commentators must
either eat their words, or demonstrate they were justified.
Maybe the power of the press is not what it was but the last thing the
Government needs is for the Fleet Street sniping to continue. A lot will
depend on today's reshuffle, on how the reshaped Government fares.
The Major camp was said to be worried last Saturday about what the
Sunday papers would say. In the event, it had little to worry about. It
was the Tory dailies who tried to unseat their man.
Yesterday's Daily Mail's banner headline shouted ''Time to Ditch the
Captain'' with a cartoon showing Mr Major at the wheel of the Titanic.
It advised Tory MPs to deny him their votes to allow a decisive battle
between Mr Michael Heseltine and Mr Michael Portillo.
The Mail also gave space to Sir George Gardiner, MP for Reigate, one
of the four MPs who helped put Mrs Margaret Thatcher in power, to argue
that a vote for Mr Redwood would enable a second ballot to be held. Sir
George, chairman of the backbench 92 Group of right wing MPs, is a
Portillo-ite.
The Sun, the wavering voice of Thatcher, declared yesterday that Mr
Major could not even organise his own political funeral properly and
accused him of a typical blunder in calling the election.
On Monday, it warned that a vote for Mr Major would let in Labour,
described his tenure of office as lacklustre, and said that, if he was
the answer to the country's problems, then heaven knew what the question
was.
The Times said yesterday that to elect a new leader was ''the only way
out''. It also gave space to Mr Iain Duncan Smith, MP for Chingford, to
put the case for Mr Redwood.
On Monday, the Daily Telegraph, no friend of the Prime Minister,
declared: ''It is time for Mr Major to go and give another leader the
opportunity to save the fortunes of the Tories, not least from their own
divisions.''
Mr Redwood was endorsed by the Sunday Telegraph, which said his
competence, ability, and knowledge of the issues were not in doubt.
The Sunday Times said that Tory MPs must either back Mr Major or sack
him, but there should be no doubt about their decision. To remain
remotely credible, he needed a resounding win.
It then praised Mr Redwood's courage in resigning to set out his
stall, revealing himself as a figure of cool determination with dash and
style. He was not the right man to lead the party. What was needed was a
more charismatic figure like Mr Heseltine or Mr Portillo in a second
ballot.
Its verdict on the Major premiership was that the British people, fed
up with the fudge and mediocrity of the past few years, needed to be
re-energised. Its former editor, Mr Andrew Neil, used his leader page
column to argue that a vote for Mr Major was ''a vote for
annihilation''.
The Tory press has tried to kill off Mr Major's career with the power
of print but the job may have to be done by the real electorate.

JOHN Redwood's wife, Gail, stopped chatting with journalists outside
her home and rushed back indoors as soon as she heard he had lost the
election for the Tory leadership.
Refusing to answer questions, she said she wanted to wait for a
telephone call from him.
Mrs Redwood had stood chatting with reporters at her home near
Wokingham, Berkshire, while listening to a car radio during the build-up
outside Westminster.
On hearing the result, Mrs Redwood said: ''What will be will be.
''I think I had better go in now. I don't think John would be very
happy if he calls and I am out here chatting to you lot.
''I will go in and wait for his call.''
Asked if she had had the radio or TV on, she said: ''I am not glued to
anything.''
Then she joked: ''Well, I am glued to the ironing.''
Refusing to discuss the implication of last night's vote on her
husband's political career, she said: ''There is nothing I can do. It is
in other people's hands.
''I am not the policitian. He is the politician.
''I must get back to my man. It doesn't matter what happens, I still
love the guy.''
Mrs Redwood has been in close contact with her husband throughout his
campaign.
She added: ''John's happy with the way the campaign has gone, so I am
happy.''
Smartly dressed, the deputy company secretary for British Airways
stood chatting over mugs of tea she had poured for reporters.
She said: ''I am known as the tea-pot in our family. My secret is out
-- I always have the Peter Rabbit mug.''

To the losers, the spoils? George Birrell gives heart to the defeated
right.
THE RIGHT of the Tory Party will be disappointed but should not be
disheartened by the result. What they sought more than anything was to
set in train a vote-winning package for the election which really
matters in 18 months.
Who now doubts that this will not include substantial tax cuts and
defence of the pound against the ''sell-out'' to Europe by the Labour
Party.
In truth, there is as much chance of a single currency, even by the
revised date of 1999, as Hugh Grant being cast as Jesus of Nazereth in
his next film.
What was central to John Redwood's campaign was the presentation of
policies. He had no argument with the strength of the economy which will
be one of the top performers in Europe this year.
He had no quibble about the social contract opt-out John Major
achieved at Maastricht which has resulted in our labour costs being half
those of Germany. Nor did he question the fact that the UK is now the
largest recipient of foreign direct investment in the EC. Around 40% of
all Japanese and American investment in Europe comes to these shores,
much of it to Scotland.
But how many of the electorate, worried about the negative equity in
their homes and fearful of losing their jobs in a highly competitive
global market place, know about it? It is not their fault but the
Government's.
Yet it is this resounding economic success which is in sharp contrast
to France's soaring unemployment and the fleeing of industry from
Germany.
This is why ''Europe'' was at the heart of Mr Redwood's campaign. It
is of little use trotting out figures about how many billions of pounds
of foreign investment Britain is attracting. What is significant is that
it accounts for one third of manufacturing investment and one job in
five -- 20% -- is dependent on it. That is the message which has to get
across.
John Major has been fighting Labour with one hand behind his back.
When he is taunted about the economy only improving after Britain fell
out of the EMS how often does he remind the critics that before we
entered Labour, the Liberal Democrats and most newspaper editorials were
hailing the fixed exchanges as a panacea. And does he remind them that
had we tried to stay in interest rates would have been around 20%?
So while it may seem at times tired and cliched to claim that the
Government's message is not getting across there is an element of truth
in it.
If yesterday's leadership election has brought these matters sharper
into focus then it will all have been worthwhile. Arch Euro-sceptic Bill
Cash has already put out soundings to find common ground with the other
wing of the party. Here it is.
What the Prime Minister must now do is reshuffle his Cabinet in an
imaginative and bold fashion. He should take the manacles off those in
the Cabinet like Michael Portillo, Michael Howard, and Peter Lilley to
beat those within Europe and their unquestioning disciples within the
Labour Party who want protectionism and corporatism. He should re-invite
Mr Redwood back into the Cabinet and give him a job in a big spending
Ministry like Social Services and ask him to make the cuts. He should
appoint Michael Heseltine as party chairman to spread the gospel.
The right wing will have done the country an enormous service if it
finally instills a bit of backbone in John Major. He has been Mr Nice
Guy for too long. As a result he has suffered the bumblings of
characters like Jeremy Hanley, the eccentricities of John Selwyn Gummer
and the silly utterances of Kenneth Clarke, whom only 3% of Tories
regard as a possible future leader.
Mr Major need have no fear about disunity so long as he shows some
steel. The entire party is now in the same lifeboat and he is the only
one with the chart. He should let them glimpse it.
Not only is the party willing to huddle around him but the majority
have demonstrably done so in the past. Yesterday's vote shows that it
was not only the formerly whipless nine who had a grievance -- more than
100 Tory MPs have. Yet at every division most have shuffled through to
support Mr Major.
Now it is down to him. He will not get another chance. Neither will
the left nor the right.

THE Scottish Tory hierarchy was last night preparing to welcome back
Mr Michael Forsyth as Secretary of State, with Mr Ian Lang moving up the
Cabinet as part of today's reshuffle.
While political opponents in Scotland attempted to label Mr Major a
lame-duck Premier, a delighted Conservative leadership north of the
Border celebrated the victory the Tory grassroots had demanded, and then
promised them a greater say in party democracy in the future.
But it was on the knock-on implications of Mr Major's win, and the
part played in it by Mr Lang, that attention focused. Senior party
figures claimed last night that Cabinet promotion was Mr Lang's for the
asking, and his expected successor was Mr Forsyth.
The Scottish party chairman, Sir Michael Hirst, hailed the Prime
Minister's victory as a ''ringing endorsement''.
On the speculation surrounding Mr Forsyth, Sir Michael insisted that
there was a convention that the chairman did not speculate on
ministerial changes but he added: ''As chairman it will be a privilege
to work with whoever John Major considers to be an appropriate person as
Secretary of State for Scotland.''
The president of the party's voluntary wing in Scotland, Mr David
McLetchie, was more forthcoming. ''The Prime Minister has to keep up the
momentum,'' he said. ''He has key posts such as Foreign Secretary to
fill and that requires safe, pragmatic hands.''
He defined the type of person the Prime Minister needs there. ''You
cannot slide a piece of paper between his views and the Foreign
Secretary's. Ian Lang would be a very strong contender.''
Of Mr Forsyth as Scottish Secretary, Mr McLetchie, president of the
Scottish Conservative and Unionist Assocation, said: ''I have no doubt
the party would rally round Michael. I don't think we would have any
difficulty about that whatsoever.
''He is a different Michael Forsyth from 1990. Policy difficulties are
past and his position has been vindicated. In many respects, if he did
return he would do so as a man whose time had come.''
He also indicated that in the aftermath of the traumatic leadership
struggle party rules would be changed to extend democracy to the
grassroots.
''There is going to a fresh look at the rules anyway,'' he said. ''One
element the 1922 Committee will look at is raising the issue of giving
ordinary members a say in some kind of electoral college. That is now
inevitable.''
The Opposition parties also clearly believed that Mr Forsyth was
destined to move on from his Minister's job at the Home Office back to
the Scottish Office.
The SNP is gearing up to hit him with a high-profile campaign turning
the spotlight on his past endorsement of Thatcherite policies such as
privatisation and the poll tax.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson gave a taste of what can be
expected from Labour. ''Michael Forsyth may be a gift for Labour but he
would be a disaster for Scotland. Scotland must not be sacrificed to the
right in order to heal divisions in the Tory Party. Scotland must not
become the ideological plaything of Mr Poll Tax, Michael Forsyth.''
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace was also scathing. ''If
history is any guide, Mr Forsyth's ideology will be even more out of
tune with the Scottish electorate than his predecessor.''

IN THE intensely competitive world of property marketing, estate
agents and lawyers are normally at each other's throats in the search
for business.
But in an unusual peace pact, estate agents Slater Hogg &amp; Howison have
entered into a small but significant partnership with a Burntisland
solicitor. The idea is to provide an improved service for house sellers
in Burntisland, Kirkcaldy, and Dalgety Bay.
Slater Hogg &amp; Howison have taken over the window display of Pirie's
office on High Street, Burntisland, and are displaying local properties.
Enquiries from potential purchasers are referred back to the local
branch.
Donald Cowie, Pirie &amp; Cowie's senior partner, said: ''In an ideal
world situations like this would be commonplace, where estate agents and
solicitors are both doing what they are good at. Slater Hogg have
furnished the window to a branch standard and professionally displayed
their quality stock of properties.
''The increase in traffic and attention that is being paid to the
branch as a result of this is providing a spin-off for solicitor
services. Each business is, therefore doing what they are best at, but
to the benefit of the client.''
Michael Luck, Slater Hogg director, said: ''We have always been
advocates of every profession concentrating on their own business. We
are estate agents and consider ourselves good at selling houses.
''Pirie &amp; Cowie are a long-established local firm and provide
excellent legal services. Their branch in Burntisland provides a link
for us between our Kirkcaldy and Dalgety Bay branches which can only
help assist those selling, through the added service it provides.
''It may well be a small step, but we think it is an enormously
forward-thinking arrangement which ultimately benefits the consumer.''

THE Prime Minister's authority has been re-established by Tory MPs,
who backed him sufficiently as their leader for the next General
Election, but dented by Mr Michael Heseltine.
Mr Major announced there would be an immediate reshuffle of his
Government, and found his Trade Secretary giving him his biggest new
problem: Mr Heseltine did not want to move.
One post, however, very quickly became vacant. Treasury Chief
Secretary Jonathan Aitken resigned.
It offers the Prime Minister the possibility of recognising the firm
vote of 89 achieved by his challenger, Mr John Redwood. The Chief
Secretary role may be passed to a right winger if Chancellor Kenneth
Clarke agrees.
The leadership vote, 218 to 89, was quickly established as having
achieved Mr Major's goal: to sort out the leadership question ''once and
for all''.
Mr Redwood acknowledged this as did Mr Michael Portillo. Only the
hardened cynics at the Commons were talking of a ''grey'' area
remaining.
Mr Major, on all wings of the party, was accepted as the best leader
they have got. There was a stated determination to make the best of him
they can.
A gust of unity flowed through the 329-strong parliamentary party, all
but two of whom voted. Twelve spoilt their ballot papers and only eight
abstained. This is a better result -- two-thirds of the party -- than
any leader has achieved before, despite having a larger electorate.
At once the Tories started concentrating on Mr Major's new Government.
He stated in Downing Street after the result that he was starting work
on it.
Two immediate problems face him. After a long talk with Mr Heseltine,
it emerged the President of the Board of Trade was not accepting the
offers being made to him. He is to make a statement today.
Despite the prospect of becoming deputy Prime Minister, and party
chairman, with a key role to play in Cabinet committees, there were
signs this statement could be a resignation from Government.
He has supported Mr Major through this attack on his leadership, but
his leader's success means an end to his chances of supplanting him. The
only thing he said was: ''I am returning to the job I love best.''
This meant his position as President of the Board of Trade. Mr Major,
however, does not appear to be in the mood to keep him in this post. He
wants him as party chairman to rally Conservatives throughout the
nation. If he will not take this, he may be offered nothing.
Both men agreed to sleep on it after they talked.
Mr Redwood did better than he expected with 89 firm votes, but there
were not enough vital abstentions to force a second ballot involving
Heseltine and Portillo. This would have been a true battle for the soul
of the Tory Party.
Mr Redwood, who resigned as Welsh Secretary nine days ago,
acknowledged his defeat gallantly: ''He won fair and square and I pay
tribute to that victory.'' He omitted a further sentence that might have
ensured his immediate return to Cabinet. He failed to urge all his
supporters to throw their weight behind the Prime Minister.
This presents Mr Major with his second dilemma: whether to overlook
this omission and criticisms of his Cabinet conduct on the hustings and
bring him back into Government today, or let some time go by before the
able and articulate Mr Redwood is re-established. Mr Major must now
sustain last night's momentum for party unity: a reappointment of Mr
Redwood, who has made himself a household name as a hero of the right,
would be a great boon to this.
Mr Major, however, is being guided by his new chief whip, Mr Alistair
Goodlad, that he must not overcompensate his critics for their defeat.
Mr Ian Lang is set for a move to the Home Office as a reward for his
star conduct of Mr Major's leadership campaign. Mr Michael Forsyth is
set for a return to Scotland and a Cabinet position replacing Mr Lang.
Home Secretary Michael Howard is due for a move and a distinct
possibility is that as a member of Major's victorious team he will
replace Mr Douglas Hurd at the Foreign Office.
Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney, another key member of the Major
camp, also has to be rewarded. If Mr Heseltine fails to take the party
chairmanship, Mr Mawhinney is a runner. But Viscount Cranborne, leader
in the Lords and titular head of the Major camp, may take on the party
chairmanship as well.
Mr Heseltine's final decision on this issue will affect the whole
shape of Mr Major's new Government which will involve a review of all
110 posts.
Mr Clarke also saw Mr Major in a one-to-one meeting yesterday, before
his monthly meeting today on monetary policy with the governor of the
Bank of England. Mr Clarke is expected to stay in place.
Mr Major could reward one of those from the right who voted against
him in the cause of reassuring his critics that he is serious about
producing a new model leader and a new model Tory Party to take on Mr
Tony Blair, who claimed that with one third of his parliamentary party
opposing him, Mr Major is in effect leading not one Conservative Party
but two.
The Prime Minister's problem is to turn his success last night into an
on-going movement to put up a serious challenge to Mr Blair.
How he fashions his new Government is essential to this if the gust of
unity is to be maintained. The balance of critics and supporters in his
new administration is vital.
Mr Redwood's cock-a-hoop supporters insist he should be brought back
into Cabinet immediately after such a firm vote, bolstered by those who
wanted to keep Mr Heseltine out of any possible challenge in a second
round.
They claim he has supplanted Mr Portillo, who yesterday promised his
''full support'' to Mr Major, as a challenger for the leadership after
the General Election.
Mr Major's result last night was sufficient for him to have made his
point and draw the Tory Party back from what he has called the
''abyss''. The tiny number of abstentions was a relief because the
parliamentary party has clearly done what he wanted -- make a clear
decision.
Whether the anti-Major Tory press accepts the result is another
matter. This will be one more problem the Prime Minister has to face.

THERE was a mixed reaction last night to John Major's win in the
ballot, with most Conservative MPs being supportive but some not
entirely convinced.
Labour leader Tony Blair made clear his view that the Tories would not
reunite, stating there was a ''very, very substantial part of the
Conservative Party against Mr Major'' and that he was not in effect
leading one Conservative Party but two.
Mr Blair said: ''I cannot believe that after the events of the last 10
days, and everything that has been said, that the Conservative Party
will reunite in any honest sense. It may come together in some show of
unity, but the divisions are there and completely fundamental.
''Whatever presentational changes are made to the Cabinet, that drift
and lack of direction will simply continue. The country will now be
faced with a very clear choice of no change under the Conservatives or
change under Labour.''
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang, one of Mr Major's key supporters, said:
''This is the clearcut win we predicted. It is what the party and the
country wanted. They will now expect us all to unite behind our leader
and the Prime Minister.''
Conservative Party chairman Jeremy Hanley -- expected to be one of the
victims of the forthcoming reshuffle -- described Mr Major's victory as
''absolutely wonderful.''
He continued: ''It is a marvellous result, a clear and decisive
majority, and means the party can unite behind the Prime Minister.
Grim-faced Euro-rebels Teresa Gorman and Tony Marlow walked briskly
past reporters without answering their questions, but Home Secretary
Michael Howard said within minutes of the victory: ''This was a very
good result by any standard.''
Former Tory Party chairman Sir Norman Fowler said: ''That was a clear
win. This is a personal victory for John Major.''
Mr Michael Portillo, seen as a likely leadership contender had the
contest gone to a second ballot, said: ''John Major has won. I
congratulate him and I give him my full support. We shall all work
together for unity in our party and victory in the next election.''
Arch Euro-sceptic Bill Cash appeared resigned to the Prime Minister
carrying on. He said: ''This is a very reasonable win by the Prime
Minister, although John Redwood has done remarkably well. He has fought
a very honourable, straightforward campaign with integrity and principle
and I think he comes out of it with very great credit.
''We all have the opportunity now to work together towards ensuring
that we defeat the Labour Party and that we manage to win the next
election, which I am quite sure we can do.''
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke welcomed Mr Major's victory, stating: ''I am
delighted by the result and I trust the whole party will rally behind
the prime Minister.''
Education Secretary Gillian Shephard said the result had vindicated
the Prime Minister's decision to stand. ''It also reflects the
firmly-held views of our constituency associations -- the Conservative
activists up and down the country -- which we at Westminster forget at
our peril,'' she said.
''The Prime Minister, in calling this leadership election, said phoney
leadership threats undermined the Government and damaged the
Conservative Party. Those behind those threats have had their chance.
The Prime Minister has won.''
Mr Phil Gallie, Tory MP for Ayr, said he was delighted with the
result, which left Mr Major in a position of strength, but he argued
that Mr Redwood should stay in the Cabinet.
Mr Gallie said: ''Mr Major should recognise that Mr Redwood had the
courage to take up the challenge he threw down, the courage to represent
views slightly different from his own.
''Perhaps he also should recognise that John Redwood has his own
capabilities and perhaps there should be a place for him in the future,
provided John Redwood accepts that John Major is the boss.''
Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown said: ''The Prime Minister
called this election to clear the air but it has cleared nothing. What
is clear is that a third of his own MPs have not been able to support
him as Prime Minister. The splits, especially over Europe and the
economy, are as deep as ever.''
Mr Michael Forsyth said: ''It is Wimbledon week and it is game, set
and match to the Prime Minister. He has done far better than the media
pundits were predicting. John Redwood has run his campaign and, having
lost, has behaved impeccably by calling on the party to unite behind the
Prime Minister. I am sure we will do that.''
Mr Bill Walker, who supported John Redwood, said there was no question
that under the rules Mr Major had won the election and was leader of the
party. However, the Prime Minister had to acknowledge that about a third
of the parliamentary party had expressed concern or abstained.

IT IS a long way from New Zealand to Old Kilpatrick, but when a Scots
couple decided to come home from Down Under they chose the north bank of
the Clyde.
Rose and James McGuire spent ten years living in New Zealand, and when
they came back to Scotland they rented a home in Bearsden. Now they have
been welcomed by sales negotiator Alason Doak as the first new
homeowners at Wimpey Homes' Claremont Rise development in Old
Kilpatrick.
There are eight different house types, four of them on show, including
the Spey, a two-bedroom semi-detached; the Severn, a three-bedroom
detached; the Tweed, a three-bedroom semi-detached; and the Lea, a
four-bedroom detached.
Prices range from #49,995 to #119,000 with 125 homes being built.
Meanwhile Wimpey has started selling at The Vines in Irvine and
Seaforth Gardens in Ayr. Companies in Ayrshire are working on the
developments having won contracts worth #1.65m from Wimpey Homes.
Some 72 homes are being built at The Vines, ranging from two and
three-bedroom terrace to two and three-bedroom semi-detached homes.
Prices start at #39,500.
Seaforth Gardens in Ayr offers a range of one-bedroom flats and two
and three-bedroom semi-detached and terraced homes, with 85 homes being
built. Prices start at #43,500.
John Patterson, production director at Wimpey Homes (Scotland West),
said: ''Where possible we try to use contractors from the surrounding
area for each development.

THE battle that everyone had predicted is indefinitely postponed. Mr
Major's victory, if not overwhelming, has killed off any chance of a
second-round showdown between Mr Michael Heseltine and Mr Michael
Portillo.
So, after 12 days of political mayhem, the followers of both men will
have to scrap their contingency plans, cancel the extra telephone lines
ordered from BT, and dispel any dreams of Ministerial promotion on the
coat-tails of their champion.
The two Michaels have been the Banquos of the feast ever since Mr
Major walked into the Rose Garden at 10 Downing Street and declared it
was time for the party to decide once and for all who should lead it
into the next, potentially devastating, General Election.
Even the surprise entry of Welsh Secretary John Redwood into the
contest failed to distract attention from the undeclared candidacy of
Messrs Heseltine and Portillo, considered by everyone with an opinion to
spare to be the true contenders from left and right, poised to strike
once the sideshow between a worn-out Prime Minister and an unknown
Vulcan was settled.
In 1990, it was Mr Heseltine who rose up to challenge Mrs Margaret
Thatcher. His boldness came at a price. Not only did he lose out to Mr
Major, he made himself enemies. For every MP grateful to him for ridding
the party of an electoral liability, there is one who will never forgive
him for destroying the heroine of the right.
This time, the President of the Board of Trade recognised the risk and
chose to do nothing that could be interpreted as disloyal.
The furthest he went was last week on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
When asked the question that is forever associated with his leadership
ambitions -- ''under what circumstances . . . '' -- he replied he would
not stand in ''this particular election''. It was all that was needed.
Hours later, the London Evening Standard declared ''Heseltine enters
fray''.
Throughout the contest, Mr Heseltine received encouragement. His
combative style, his charisma, his ability to rally the troops when all
was going terribly wrong, were cited as possible election savers. Then
came a Mori poll in the Economist last Thursday which suggested the
Tories would lose 52 fewer seats if he was leader than under Mr Major.
The same poll claimed that with Mr Portillo the party would lose at
least 50 more. That was enough to make even those on the right who
loathe his Heathite, interventionist, one-nation Toryism, think again.
For Mr Portillo, the leadership contest was unexpected. Mr Major's
decision, and Mr Redwood's response, wrong-footed the Employment
Secretary, who until now had been tipped as a future contender. Unlike
Mr Heseltine, Mr Portillo made little effort to dampen speculation that,
were Mr Major to fall at the first ballot, he would be prepared to come
forward. Left and right alike thought this smacked of cowardice.
Mr Portillo's lukewarm endorsement for Mr Major and the brashness of
his supporters have also harmed him. Throughout the contest, he issued
terse statements of loyalty while his backers openly manoeuvred against
the Prime Minister. The worst came last week when journalists spotted BT
engineers installing an extra 20 telephone lines in a house near the
Commons frequented by his supporters.
In consolation, he can consider the eminently sensible justification
for his hesitance. He is a man of talent, still young in political terms
at 42, who remains a likely candidate for the future leadership of his
party. Had he stood and been elected, he would have faced the prospect
of fighting the next election as a new and not necessarily popular
leader.
The conflict between left and right for the soul of the Conservative
Party remains unresolved. Until the election, Mr Heseltine will remain
the favoured candidate of the Tory left to save the party.
Mr Portillo, meanwhile, will have to mend his reputation while he
plays the long-game. The next leadership contest will, on current
trends, be to choose who rebuilds the party after the electoral disaster
that awaits it. The battle between right and left is merely battle
deferred.

TREASURY Chief Secretary Jonathan Aitken resigned from the Government
last night, producing another Cabinet job for the Prime Minister to fill
today. Mr Aitken has law suits against the press concerning his private
and public conduct.
Mr Aitken is also friendly with Mr Redwood. He refused to debunk him
on his taxation and spending platform at the height of the contest.
The futures of Agriculture Minister William Waldegrave and
Attorney-General Nicholas Lyell also now come into consideration. Both
are involved in the Scott Inquiry into the Government's conduct over
arms to Iraq.
If Mr Major wants to start with a clean slate today their resignations
may be sought.
The Aitken resignation highlights the opportunities now afforded to Mr
Major to be ruthless in his reshuffle, to present to the nation an end
to all the scandals, private or political, that he has been faced with
over the last three years.

JOHN MAJOR played his game of political chicken to the end.
He waited until the last minute to cast his vote, declaring only as he
swept past the press of journalists in the Committee Corridor that he
expected a ''convincing win''.
Less than an hour later, he had what he wanted. The Yorkshire tones of
Sir Marcus Fox, the chairman of the back bench 1922 Committee, crackled
via speaker out of room 14, where the Tory faithful and unfaithful had
gathered to hear the result.
The corridor, which runs the length of the Commons, was by then packed
with a sweating mass of journalists, researchers, and curious Labour
MPs, who perched on the fake leather benches and crowded around the
loudspeakers set up for the occasion to hear the result. When Mr Major's
score of 218 was announced a vulture-like ''ooooh'' went up from those
who hoped for a mortal wound.
They were drowned out seconds later by the sustained banging of desks
from inside Room 14, where Mr Major's back bench supporters sought to
reinforce a potentially equivocal result with a raucous show of
enthusiasm. Then the corridor emptied, as journalists scrambled to find
calculators and someone to explain what it all meant.
Voting had gone on since 10am next door in Room 12. MPs trickled in,
Mr Redwood voting early. Some stopped to speak to the cordoned-off
journalists keeping score. Others, many with the guilt of betrayal
written on their faces, hurried off without a word.
At 11.25 Kenneth Baker, former party chairman and potential
Redwoodsman, ignored reporters' questions and smiled enigmatically,
prompting an ''oooooh'' of mock speculation. Julian Brazier, a confirmed
Redwoodsman, denied he had been promised a job for his vote.
Minutes later Sir Julian Critchley, retiring MP for Aldershot and
outspoken Heselteenie, arrived in his wheelchair. As he opened the door
Christopher Gill, Euro-sceptic and Redwood campaigner, tried to whisper
in his ear. ''F... off'' was the reply, possibly the only heartfelt
words spoken all day.
Michael Heseltine and Kenneth Clarke, each a potential candidate,
stayed aloof and avoided comment.
At 3.05 Alistair Burt, as laid-back as only a junior minister safe in
his job can be, offered to detail ''why I hate the right wing''. But he
failed to spot the patrician Douglas Hurd coming up behind him, who
snapped ''Mr Burt!'' in the way only an Eton-educated grandee can.
Mr Burt promptly changed tack like a chastened school-boy: ''The
Conservative party is a broad church. I love all my colleagues dearly. I
only hope they make the right decisions.'' His tongue could be spotted
tucked firmly in his cheek.
At 3.10 Sir Teddy Taylor emerged, looking resigned. ''I have huge
regard for John Major as a person but I think I would be letting my own
feelings down because Mr Redwood represents the same things I stand for,
I think. I have taken the plunge.''
At 3.30 the crowd thickened, tipped off by Central Office that Mr
Major was about to vote. As the minutes ticked by, the speculation
intensified. Was he wavering? Was he buying himself a cup of tea to
persuade himself how to vote? Was he twisting his own arm? Or was he
abstaining in the interests of party unity?
At 4.33, as the division bell tolled for those MPs still interested in
the progress of the Pensions Bill in the Commons, Mr Major arrived. It
took him three minutes to vote.

IN ONE of Scotland's most remarkable conservation projects a historic
country estate with a mansion, a mill, farm houses, lodges and cottages
is being restored and the 17 properties put up for sale.
Although most of the buildings were designed at the turn of the
century by the famous Scottish architect and country house specialist
Sir Robert Lorimer, most have never been lived in. It is a story of a
rich man's dream which turned into a financial nightmare and of a unique
estate which was eventually sold for #1.
Formakin was the dream of a self-made man who went bust before he
could move into his Xanadu. John Augustus Holms, a stockbroker from
Paisley, acquired the four farms which were to form the estate around
1902. He moved into Gatehead, a house on the estate, while he supervised
the construction work.
Determined to have nothing but the best in which to store his vast
treasure trove of rugs, porcelain, art works and tapestries, he
commissioned Lorimer to design a mansion house, outbuildings, estate
buildings, and formal gardens in the 150-acre grounds.
Holms was a passionate gardener and horticulturist, and he ordained
that the park and gardens should follow the style of Gertrude Jekyll's
work at Munstead Wood, Surrey. The tall south-facing window of the
proposed mansion house would look across open grassy parkland and a lake
towards Glasgow.
Formal gardens, each with its own theme such as the oriental garden
and fountain garden, were laid out to the North-east of the house.
He then turned his attention to the construction of the estate houses
in 1904. Many alterations were decided on and made after work was well
under way.
Concerned that some of the roofs looked a little flat, Holms suggested
the addition of little diabolical figures. These were later changed to
the stone monkeys which now adorn the roofs throughout the estate,
earning it the local nickname of the Monkey House.
After developing the stable block, restoring a seventeenth-century
miller's house and repairing the mill, work began on the imposing
mansion house in 1911. Although it has never been lived in, and was
never completed, the great hall in the mansion house still has a
dramatic impact on the visitor.
Designed to house a fifteenth-century Persian carpet owned by Holms,
the room has vast windows, a fireplace that fills a whole wall, a
minstrel gallery, and a large outside terrace. In various corners of the
bare room there are hints as to how it might have been decorated - a
ceiling panel, a yard or so of balustrade on the minstrel gallery - in
effect, Lorimer's samples from which his client could choose the final
interior decor.
But it never got that far. As soon as the roof was put on in 1913,
Holms limped into the bare house and told the workmen to put down their
tools and leave the building. He had had a terrible year.
A serious riding accident was followed by something even more painful,
the loss of much of his fortune. He had to settle the debts of his then
partner, James Filshill. ''Done in the eye to over 100,000. It's not
such a funny job, Eh?'' he wrote at the time.
Ironically, the motto over the living room fireplace reads: ''God help
the rich for the poor can beg.'' The monkey of fate had had the last
laugh.
Holms continued to live in Gatehead, from where he could see his
uncompleted project. He died in 1938 and the estate was bought by A E
Pickard, a Glasgow entrepreneur. But very little maintenance was carried
out and the estate, in which no-one had ever lived, stood wind and
watertight... but lifeless.
In 1978 the Formakin Trust took it over and, with the help of Renfrew
District Council, made progress in maintaining and restoring the
buildings. But the cash was never available to bring it back to life. In
a most unusual deal the whole estate was sold for #1 on condition that
purchaser Kit Martin carefully restore and convert all of these unique
buildings for sale. Another condition is that there should be public
access for walks in certain parts of the estate.
Kit Martin has a distinguished track record in the sensitive
restoration of great houses. His other major projects include:
Tyninghame, East Lothian; Cullen House, Banff; Keith Hall Aberdeenshire,
and Callaly Castle, Northumberland.
Yet Formakin was almost destroyed as an integrated concept. Several
years ago a builder applied for consent to build 195 new houses on the
estate. ''The local authority was extremely enlightened in preventing
aggressive redevelopment at Formakin,'' says Martin.
''The problem was that they never had an end-user for the estate. Now
by restoring all 17 buildings and selling them we will have people
living here and the wider grounds will be restored for public use.''
His enthusiasm for the project is infectious. ''This group of
buildings is remarkable because they were almost all designed by one man
and at one time. Most big country houses and estates grow over a long
period of years, sometimes centuries. Formakin was started from scratch
and almost completed within a decade, which is most unusual.''
The mansion house and the estate buildings are being restored to as
near the vision of Holms and Lorimer as possible. With the support and
assistance of the National Trust for Scotland and strict feu conditions,
the long-term future of the estate will be secured.
The gardens and grounds are naturally beautiful and are part of a
planned landscape. They will be maintained by contributions from the
residents as well as the visiting public. The grounds will be in the
name of Formakin Garden Company Ltd, and both the National Trust for
Scotland and residents will appoint directors to the company.
When complete, some 17 houses will have been brought to life, five in
the mansion and others throughout the grounds. The buildings are Listed
Category A as being of outstanding Architectural and Historic Interest.
Prices range from #70,000 for the small lodge houses at the gates to
offers over #210,000 for the miller's house. The properties within the
mansion house are not ready for sale. Selling agent is Cluttons.
