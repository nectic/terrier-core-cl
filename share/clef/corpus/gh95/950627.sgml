THE Rugby World Cup in South Africa has set the benchmark for all the
tournaments which will follow but its spectacular success means that the
organisers of the 1999 tournament, with the final in Cardiff, face a
massive challenge to ensure that the advances made in each competition
since 1987 are maintained.
At the weekend, RWC chairman Sir Ewart Bell, speaking with
satisfaction and relief, declared: ''There was a period when grave
doubts were expressed about the decision to come to South Africa but the
board of the RWC kept their heads down and their eyes on the target and
we are very happy to say that it has all proved worthwhile.''
Even the insensitive and boorish weekend comments by South African
Rugby Football Union president Dr Louis Luyt to the effect that had the
Springboks been allowed to compete in 1987 and 1991 then they, and not
New Zealand and Australia, would have been world champions have failed
to take the gloss off what has been a spectacularly successful
tournament.
Luyt, a millionaire businessman with an autocratic style and an
unfortunate propensity for running off at the mouth, deserves his moment
of glory for the success of the tournament but as a rugby administrator,
and a diplomat, he leaves much to be desired.
The tournament which ended in such spectacular and story-book fashion
on Saturday with a win for Francois Pienaar's Springboks has been the
biggest rugby event the world has ever seen.
In size it was rivalled only by the Olympic Games and the football
World Cup. More than one million people attended the matches and, in TV
terms, it took rugby on to a new plane.
Some 2.5 billion people in 120 countries tuned in during the course of
the four-week extravaganza, making it one of the most popular events in
the history of sports broadcasting.
But, amid the euphoria, there are a number of points to be made which,
perhaps, the RWC directors and the International Rugby Football Board
should examine before the circus moves to the Five Nations in 1999.
Top of that list is the fact that the tournament is too long. During
the first two weeks of the competition the rugby came fast and furious,
staccato-style, with the 16 teams competing for a place in the
quarter-finals.
After a fortnight, though, the competition went flat. Is it really
necessary for a week to elapse between the quarter-finals and the semis?
That is a debatable point.
What is not debatable, however, is that for a further week of
inactivity to be endured before the grand finale is just plain daft.
That week of rugby famine is broken by the third-place play-off but, in
the opinion of all involved -- players, coaches, and spectators -- that
is game too many and one always destined to be a damp squib.
For evidence that this is true look no further than the England v
France play-off last Thursday. Both sides looked as if they would far
rather have been somewhere else.
The tournament organisers argue that the reason for the lull at the
back end of the tournament is to allow players time to recover from the
rigours of what is an intensely physical sport.
But, the game is just as physical in the pool stages when players are
subjected to three Test matches within the space of nine or 10 days so,
logically, the argument falls.
In 1999, when the tournament moves back to the Northern Hemisphere,
the organisers are going to have a devil of a job to ensure that
standards set in South Africa are, at least, equalled.
Immediately, there are two factors against which the Five Nations
cannot compete. The weather in South Africa has played a major hand in
the success of the tournament. It is mid-winter here but the sun has
shone continuously since we arrived six weeks ago.
Gavin Hastings is a firm advocate of summer rugby and, having
experienced just what a difference the sunshine makes -- for players and
spectators -- it is impossible not to concede that he has a point.
The other factor which has contributed to the success of RWC 1995 is
the fact that South Africa has the best rugby stadiums in the world.
The refereeing throughout the tournament, at least in the latter
stages once the make-weight officials from second-line rugby nations had
gone home, was of an acceptable standard.
With the exception of the bar-room brawl which disfigured the game
between Canada and South Africa, the tournament has been largely free of
the thuggery which gives rugby a bad name and which prompts parents to
steer their offspring to more gentile sports.
However, on the subject of discipline, there is one serious point to
be made.
If a player is sent off by the referee, or if retrospective action is
taken against him on the basis of ''citing'' by tournament officials --
as happened in the Springboks v Canada game and to Western Samoan Mike
Umaga (again against the Springboks) -- then the penalty should be borne
not just by the individuals concerned but by the squad as a whole.
It is nonsense for the tournament organisers to say, as they did, that
they viewed discipline as a collective responsibility and then allow
squads depleted through indiscipline to make up their numbers so long as
the union concerned did so at its own expense.
It was such a situation which allowed Chester Williams to come back
into the Springbok squad after he had been sidelined through injury.
Williams was the only black man in the South African side and it was,
undoubedtly, a major PR coup to have him back in the myrtle and gold but
the manner of his return flies in the face of logic and natural justice.
What of Scotland? They should have beaten France in the final pool
game and, if they had, they would not have met the All Blacks in the
quarter-finals and, in all likelihood, would have progressed via victory
over Ireland, to the semis.
That would have been a fairer reflection of their contribution to the
tournament as a whole. However -- and this was the thought which kept
running through the mind during the epic final struggle between South
Africa and New Zealand -- Scotland are not yet at a stage when they can
take a game by the scruff of the neck and, consistently, pull off a win
when the odds are even.
The most impelling facet of the Ellis Park final -- which was not, it
has to be said, a classic game of rugby football -- was the intensity of
the occasion and the mind-numbing concentration exerted by both teams
over the entire 104 minutes.
Neither side gave an inch. Both sides refused to contemplate the
prospect of defeat. And, as a result, they almost cancelled each other
out. It is that killer instinct which separates the top sides from the
also-rans. And very few sides have it.
However, and this is not viewing the world through blue-tinted
spectacles, Scotland were, to my mind, the most impressive side of the
home nations.
Wales were woeful and a disgrace to the memory of the great Welsh
sides which have gone before.
Ireland, as always, played with spirit and not much else.
England, with their massive resources and star-studded side, were a
huge disappointment.
Compare the relative performances of Scotland and England against the
All Blacks.
Scotland, ultimately, were well beaten but Hastings and his men never
gave in.
With the meagre playing resources at their disposal, Scotland will
always struggle when facing the top sides on the world stage but they
could, and should, have beaten France.
For the future, it is the mental toughness of the Springboks and the
All Blacks to which all sides -- and Scotland -- must aspire.
For South Africa, winning the William Webb Ellis trophy has been the
realisation of an impossible dream. In the course of the past six weeks
one has seen a transformation in the attitude of the country's 28m
blacks.
Of course, it is not possible to generalise or to claim to have taken
a percentage perfect poll. But something quite magnificent has taken
place in this country which is striving, after years of
apartheid-induced isolation, to find its true place in the world scheme
of things.
When the British Lions toured here before South Africa was, rightly,
sent into international isolation, any blacks who were interested gave
their support to the Lions.
As the past six weeks have progressed -- and with Nelson Mandela in
the van -- the Afrikaaner sport of rugby and Pienaar's Springboks have
acted as a catalyst for nationhood, for togetherness.
That is an achievement which transcends sport and, even for that
achievement alone, the South Africans deserve their place in the rugby
sun.

THE fund managers of the #610m Mercury European Privatisation Trust,
disappointed that shares are trading at a 15% discount to net asset
value, yesterday attempted to set their record straight with
institutions and investment intermediaries in Glasgow and Edinburgh.
The Mercury Asset Management investment trust, whose net asset value
has risen from 95.50p to about 104p since its launch in March last year,
made it clear from the outset that other European governments were less
disposed than the UK administration to selling off their assets cheaply
to promote wider share ownership.
However, in spite of this, some non-professional investors seem to
have been disappointed with Mercury European's performance because it
has not benefited from the major windfalls which characterised some UK
privatisation issues.
The trust, however, is confident that the longer, flatter economic
cycle which it is predicting will allow privatised companies to make a
lot of money.
Fund manager Paul Harwood said: ''We are a bit disappointed that the
share price (of 88p) does not better reflect what we have done in terms
of making the assets perform.''
Mercury European's Glasgow and Edinburgh ''roadshows'' will be
followed by similar briefings in Manchester, Bristol and London. The
trust has already put its case to investors in Birmingham.
Included in Mercury Asset Management's presentation is the message
that Mercury European has enjoyed the best net asset value performance
in the European regional development investment trust sector during the
period from its launch to the end of last month.
The fund, whose three largest holdings are British Airways, petroleum
giant BP and Dutch post office and telephone company Kon PTT, also has
an #8.9m stake in Perth-based bus group Stagecoach Holdings.
Having anticipated regulator Professor Stephen Littlechild's recent
body-blow to English regional electricity companies, Mercury European
took a #5m stake in Eastern Group after prices plunged.
Mercury European has about #25m invested in privatised UK water
companies. However, these are shorter-term tactical holdings and Eastern
Europe is one of the areas where the trust anticipates attractive
opportunities in the second half of its 10-year life.
In the shorter-term, Mercury European will be looking to cash in on
further privatisation opportunities in the telecommunications sector, in
Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Sweden, Italy and France.

A GORGEOUS Can-Can girl yesterday provided a touch of Parisian
elegance on top of Glasgow's newest hotel development, the Holiday Inn
Garden Court.
Maurice Taylor celebrated the moment at which contractor Balfour
Beatty reached the highest point of his new hotel with a ''topping-out''
ceremony, along the lines of those performed by ancient Asian
civilisations 7000 years ago.
The #4m, 80-bedroom hotel, on the corner of West Nile Street and
Renfrew Street, has a facade which would not be out of place on any
Parisian boulevard and will incorporate Taylor's trademark French
brasserie La Bonne Auberge.
It is due to open in January and is the result of a franchise
agreement between Taylor and Holiday Inn Worldwide.
Also joining in the celebrations was Frenchman Tibo Heinrich, Balfour
Beatty's site engineer.

WPP chairman Gordon Stevens was forced to call for a poll at
yesterday's annual meeting over the potentially lucrative options and
incentives package proposed for chief executive Martin Sorrell.
The original terms worth a maximum of some #31m were reduced after
protests from major institutional holders to a maximum of #28.5m if
demanding performance criteria are met. The change appeared to satisfy
some of the institutions.
The meeting attracted a handful of questions from small shareholders
over the benefits package but it was overwhelmingly approved by the
shareholders present, with 36 voting in favour and only three against.
Pension and Investment Research Consultants (PIRC) initially called on
the meeting to be postponed so that shareholders could have more time to
consider the revised benefits proposal.
When this failed it forced a poll of all shareholders' votes on the
matter.
Anne Simpson, joint managing director of PIRC, claimed that many
institutions remained opposed, including Standard Life and Legal &amp;
General. She said her action in calling for a poll would make this
clear.
Later, WPP announced that the poll had indicated 74% of the votes cast
in favour and 26% against. This showed that some major holders did
indeed continue to oppose the amended options package.
Mr Stevens told shareholders that the group was making progress, with
worldwide revenues up 8% in the first five months of the current year.
''The company as a whole is ahead of budget and of last year and it is
clear that the trading environment is strengthening,'' he declared.
''However, the company continues to make a cautious approach to
evaluating future trends.''
Revenue growth is moving in the right direction, rising 4% in the
first half of 1994-95, 6% in the second and now 8% over the latest five
months. Mr Gordon added that margins continued to improve in accordance
with the business plan which calls for an improvement of 1% in the
current year and a further 1% in the subsequent year.
The two advertising agencies, J Walter Thompson and Ogilvy &amp; Mather,
have seen 10% growth in revenue, the three market research companies 8%
and the public relations companies have trading in line with budget
which predicts break-even over the year.

SOUTH African rugby president Louis Luyt, at the centre of controversy
following remarks made at a dinner after the recent World Cup final,
again was the centre of attention yesterday when he claimed that he was
very annoyed by suggestions that New Zealand players may have been
''nobbled'' before the final.
''That is going very low indeed,'' said Luyt. ''Why would we do
anything like that? We wanted to beat New Zealand fair and square, which
we did.''
The official then back-tracked over his weekend remarks that the
Springboks would have won the 1987 and '91 tournaments if they had taken
part.
''I had my tongue in my cheek,'' said the South African. Asked if he
really believed South Africa, who were banned from world competition
during the apartheid years, would have won, Luyt replied: ''No way, no
way, I don't think so.''
On the food poisoning which struck New Zealand on the eve of the
final, All Blacks press officer Ric Salizzo tried to defuse the
situation by describing the incident as ''an unfortunate coincidence.''
Eighteen members of the 26-man squad suffered after a lunch in their
hotel on Thursday, and coach Laurie Mains claimed the after-effects had
''significantly affected'' his side.

SCOTLAND striker Susan MacDonald salvaged some pride for Britain at
the European Nations Women's Hockey Cup in Amsterdam when she captured
the tournament's top scorer award.
With England and Scotland both failing to win a medal, this was the
only prize taken back to these islands and for the Western Klick
Photopoint player to finish above such players as Germany's Nadine
Ernsting-Krienke and Franziska Hentschel, the Dutch pair of Ellen
Kuipers and Wietske de Ruiter, and Sophie Llobet, of France, helps
confirm the class of the Glasgow languages teacher.
MacDonald, of course, has a habit of cracking in goals on the domestic
front. The 50 mark each season is reached regularly but she doesn't hang
around on the international scene, either.
Her double in the 2-2 draw with Russia on Saturday to decide fifth
place brought her total for Scotland to 40 in 59 appearances.
They also gave her 10 in the championship to place her one ahead of
her rivals.
This feat could not have come at a better time as far as MacDonald is
concerned for the Great Britain management is in the process of revising
its Olympic training squad.
With their qualifying tournament for Atlanta being hosted by South
Africa in Cape Town in just five month's time, the name of MacDonald is
likely to be more prominent than ever.

ABERDEEN have rewarded their fans for rallying around their successful
fight against relegation by placing a price freeze on season tickets for
the forthcoming campaign.
''This is partly our way of saying thank you to our supporters for the
backing we received when it mattered,'' said Aberdeen general manager
David Johnston. ''We want to build on this and have introduced a scheme
whereby supporters can spread payments over a period and still save
money. We believe these initiatives will be warmly received.''
* FIRST division newcomers Morton are offering their senior citizen
fans the chance to watch games next season free.
All supporters over 70 will get a free season ticket for the stand.
And for those 65-69 it is a free season ticket to the ground. But the
club also is aiming to attract young fans and they are introducing
special deals for under 12s and students.
With Morton meeting Rangers in their opening Coca-Cola Cup-tie, all
adults who buy a season ticket will get a voucher to allow them to
purchase two tickets for the Ibrox visit, while juveniles get a voucher
for one ticket.
* LIVINGSTON, formerly Meadowbank, have signed striker Steve Laidlaw
and midfielder Colin Bowster from Easthouses.

DRESDNER Bank formally made its #1000m cash bid for one of the few
remaining independent British merchant banks yesterday when it offered
an agreed 725p-a-share for Kleinwort Benson.
Jurgen Sarrazin, chairman of Germany's second-biggest bank, said that
several British banks had been bought by foreign banks but he did not
intend taking any of these examples as a precedent.
Already this year, ING of Holland has rescued Barings while the Swiss
Bank Corporation has acquired S G Warburg with many in the City now
confidently expecting securities house Smith New Court to lose its
independence before the year-end.
Slightly understating the occasion, Kleinwort chairman Lord Rockley
said it was a momentus occasion for the bank which can trace its origins
back to 1792 and that it was ''a partnership made out of our strategic
choice''.
Chairman Lord Rockley said that current trading has been unsettled
with losses incurred in US mortgage-backed securities being
''exceedingly painful'' so far this year. The bank's performance overall
has so far this year been substantially below expectations.
He will retire as chairman next March and be succeeded by the present
deputy chairman Simon Robertson who will be appointed to the advisory
board of Dresdner to join 20 other senior officials. He will be allowed
to join the deliberations of the main board only when investment banking
is being discussed.
Dresdener is acquiring Kleinwort at 13[1/2] times last year's earnings
and would seem to be paying a somewhat higher multiple on likely
earnings for the current year. But that is is seen as a short-term cost
to propel it into a leading role in international investment banking in
equities and corporate advice such as on privatisations where Kleinwort
is the international leader.
For the last five years, it has concentrated on its own backyard
through building up its branch network in the former East Germany and
decided that organic growth overseas would take too long.
Very much aware that Deutsche Bank has achieved a signal success when
five years ago it bought Morgan Grenfell in raising staff morale and in
contrast the defections at Warburg after the failure of the merger talks
with Morgan Stanley, Mr Sarazzin will have to handle the 2900 Kleinwort
staff with care.
The bid has been declared final except in the event if a counter-bid
appears which does seem unlikely.

<HEADLINE>Wise-cracking Sampras proves a big hit a Wimbledon.  Pistol Pete packs aces.</HEADLINE>

HOLD it, who was that wise-cracking American who left his inquisitors
slapping their thighs yesterday?
Could it really have been that well-known lugubrious straight-man Pete
Sampras who had them rolling in the aisles?
It sure was. And Sampras, who is normally so intensely focused in
trying to drill tennis balls through opponents, even smiled after he had
showered away the excesses of another day at work.
Perhaps it was relief at having dismissed a troublesome obstacle,
Karsten Braasch, placed in his path towards becoming only the third
player in Wimbledon history to win three successive men's singles
championships that made the No.2 seed behave out of character.
Whatever, after his 7-6, 6-7, 6-4, 6-1 win in a match which opened the
Championships on Centre Court, Pistol Pete staged something approaching
a cabaret during his interview.
Then again, he could afford to relax knowing that he faces a Brit, Tim
Henman, in the next round.
Henman is not as unorthodox as Braasch, whose style Sampras described
as ''a pain in the ass.''
Braasch, a 27-year-old German, who is ranked No.120 in the world,
serves as though he has lost all co-ordination.
He tosses the ball, winds his racket all the way up and round from his
heels, and staggers forward as he makes contact.
''I know it's unusual,'' he said, ''and, sometimes, when I watch
myself on television, I laugh, too.''
For a while, though, Sampras wasn't laughing -- ''I wasn't exactly a
happy camper out there for a bit'' -- and when he lost the second-set
tie-break his bottom lip jutted out like a window sill.
However, he pulled together enough parts of his game, although his
service returns were not convincing, to win the next two sets and ease
through.
Asked about Wimbledon's decision to use heavier balls in an attempt to
reduce the devastating effectiveness of the power servers like Sampras,
the defending champion said: ''The balls fluff up quicker, but I think
they will hinder the weaker servers more,'' he said.
That wasn't enough, and he was asked to describe what else was
different about the balls. ''The noise,'' he said.
Someone asked if he could describe the noise and Sampras answered:
''It would be like hitting your head.''
Hilarity all round as the American, who has never been known for his
sense of humour, continued to throw in some decent one-liners. ''How do
I know, I didn't graduate,'' was his repsonse to a request to reveal the
tension of his racvket strings in pounds rather than kilos.
In fact, he strings his weapon at 68 to 69 pounds and it can be lethal
when he connects properly.
''Today, I just didn't get into any kind of groove at all,'' he said,
''but, hopefully, I'll be playing better as the tournament progresses. I
hope to be here for a while.''
Braasch, who admits to liking a beer and a smoke, which might help
explain his peculiar style of play, said he had been nervous going into
the game on Centre Court, but after a few shots felt he could win. ''I
had that feeling all the way through,'' he said.
It was pointed out to him that Sampras had felt his play was a ''pain
in the ass,'' and he said: ''Why, thank you.
''Look, I know it is a little bit unusual, but it isn't self taught. I
was helped by some tennis coaches in my home town, Marl. Maybe they were
just bad coaches, but if it works then why change it?''
Why, indeed. With a little more luck and perhaps also a shade more
self-belief, Braasch might have won a match on which he could have dined
out on for the remainder of his career, but it wasn't to be and he slips
back into obscurity provided he can remember where that is.
0 Richard Krajicek, meanwhile, was the first seeded player to be put
to the sword. The Dutchman lost 7-6, 6-3, 6-3 to Bryan Shelton, who
occupies a berth 71 places below him in the world standings.
Michael Chang, seeded five and who is a real threat to Sampras and
everyone else, beat Lionel Roux 6-3, 6-4, 4-6, 6-2, but for Jeremy
Bates, for so long Britain's top player, Wimbledon was brief.
He lost 7-6, 6-4, 7-5 to Derrick Rostagno and then said: ''It's Monday
and it's all over already.''
He could have arranged to meet one or two of his countrymen in
Wimbledon village where they could have wept into their beer because it
wasn't a particularly good day for the Brits.
Mark Petchey lost 7-6, 6-1, 6-2 to that old hippy Mats Wilander, who
plays these days only when he feels like it or when his guitar is away
being restrung, Danny Sapsford was beaten 7-5, 6-2, 6-3 by Daniel
Nestor, and Gary Henderson had the misfortune to meet the No.16 seed,
Guy Forget. The Frenchman won 6-1, 6-3, 7-6.
Britain's new No.1, Greg Rusedski, who has traded the Maple Leaf for
the Union Jack on the strength of his English mother, Helen, has angered
players like Chris Wilkinson, who beleive the newcomer has pushed them
further down the pecking order, but the controversy didn't seem to
bother the new Brit yesterday. He beat Stephane Simian 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 to
help keep the new flag flying and prove he has recovered fully from an
ankle injury which forced him to attend the sports injuries clinic at
Lilleshall for six weeks.
Henman also did well to beat Kenyan Paul Wakesa 7-6, 6-0, 6-4 and a
game against Sampras seems poor reward.
As the sun was setting, a graceful sight -- all the more appealling
given the stunted performance of Braasch -- appeared on Centre Court.
Gabriela Sabatini strolled out to play the Frenchwoman, Lea Ghirardi,
and won 6-3, 6-4 while reminding everyone in the process that not all of
the beauty has been bludgeoned out of the sport.
It would be nice to see the Argentinian win Wimbledon, but I fear her
temperament is too brittle and her serve, which is as solid as a
marshmallow, disintegrates under pressure.
However, at least she is still in the tournament which is more than
can be said for the eleventh seeded Iva Majoliu, who lost 1-6, 6-3, 6-1
to Angelica Gavaldon.

FRANK Bruno's World Boxing Council world heavyweight title challenge
against Oliver McCall has been rescheduled for September 2 at a venue
yet to be decided.
McCall pulled out of the original July 22 date last week because of a
cut left hand which required stitches.
Wembley Stadium was the original venue and could still be the site for
a show that promoter Frank Warren describes as ''Britain's biggest.''
There is also a chance that Prince Naseem Hamed, the leading contender
for the WBO super-bantamweight crown held by the hard-punching, unbeaten
Mexican Marco Antonio Barreras, could be added to the McCall-Bruno bill.
Nigel Benn's WBC super-middleweight title defence against Italy's
Vincenzo Nardiello, scheduled for the McCall card, will still go ahead
on July 22, but at the London Arena.
That bill will also feature WBO bantamweight champion Alfred Kotey in
a defence of his championship against an opponent yet to be named.

LINFORD Christie yesterday began preparing for the season's first
confrontation with his American rivals as moves were made to sort out a
pay dispute with the British Athletic Federation.
Christie's agent Sue Barrett was believed to be meeting the
federation's executive chairman, Peter Radford, to try and strike a
deal.
The two sides have been deadlocked over how much he should receive for
competing at the summer's domestic events.
Christie will have strengthened his bargaining position with two
blistering runs at the European Cup in Lille.
A 10.05sec win in the 100 metres and a 20.11 success in the 200m --
his fastest around the curve for seven years -- silenced talk of an
early-season crisis.
But unless agreement is reached, Christie will not run at the
showpiece KP Games at Crystal Palace on July 7.
Meanwhile, in Sunday's first major British meeting at Gateshead,
Jonathan Edwards' stunning triple jumping could not have been better
timed for the meeting at his home stadium.
Edwards suddenly is a hot property after the longest leap of all time,
a wind-assisted 18.43m, followed by a legal British record of 17.72.
There is no doubt in his mind that he can sustain the form and even
threaten Willie Banks' world record of 17.97.

IRON the wrinkles out of the Saltires and get the kit looked out. This
could be a job for the Tartan Army, who have never been averse to
tackling special assignments.
Yesterday, opening day of the Championships, adrenalin-charged
Scottish blood -- a fierce mixture -- coursed through the terribly
English gardens of Wimbledon when Miles Maclagan recovered from a shaky
start to his match against Renso Furlan and made it through to the
second round for the second time in three years.
Maclagan is a strapping lad who looks as though he is made of girders
even if he wasn't born in Scotland.
He came into the world in Zambia of Scottish parents, Ramsay and
Elsie, was brought up in Zimbabwe, and trained in England from the age
of 13, but that wasn't his fault.
He doesn't speak Glaswegian, but let's not hold that against him
either.
The point is Maclagan, whether he likes it or not, is the
standard-bearer of the Lion Rampant in these parts where accents and
attitudes are public school and he just might require a little
assistance, some vocal back-up.
It would be a sight to behold if the leafy and ivy-clad grounds of the
All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club were to be provided with an
additional splurge of colouring.
Come to think of it, there is a distinct lack of tartan about the
place and one or two banners urging the English to ''Remember
Bannockburn'' might add a little something to the place.
The troops could use the experience of a sortie across the Wall in
preparation for the European Championship finals in England next summer,
provided Craig Brown's footballing lads can negotiate their remaining
qualifying matches.
A stint at Wimbledon in support of Maclagan, who excelled himself in
beating Furlan, would certainly be worthwhile, although the kilted
hordes might end up banned from the tennis, especially if they decide to
take little bits of the hallowed Centre Court turf home with them to be
transplanted in the back gardens beside the sods from Wembley '77.
Had Glasgow's Ross Matheson not lost 6-3, 5-7, 6-7, 3-6 to America's
David Wheaton, there probably would have been no stopping them, but he
was unable to make it a Scottish double despite a stirring effort.
''He was there for the taking and perhaps I should have had a more
mature approach,'' he said. ''However, I'll be stronger for this
experience.''
If the truth be told, Maclagan doesn't consider himself to be
''particularly Scottish'' and wouldn't relate much to fans wearing
football tops, kilts, and burst sandshoes.
Nevertheless, he played like a Scot on Court 3 yesterday. His Italian
opponent is ranked 239 places above him in the latest world rankings and
Maclagan was widely expected to provide no more than a testing workout,
but the loss of the first set galvanised the Scot, who took the next
three sets to win 2-6, 6-2, 7-6, 6-3 in two hours and 22 minutes.
Having dropped serve twice in the first set, he broke Furlan twice in
the second and after both players each had dropped serve once in the
third set, which was a tense struggle, Maclagan won the tie break 7-5.
He broke his opponent, whose nerve and temper were fraying, in the
opening and ninth games of the fourth set.
He now will meet Chris Wilkinson, who defeated Germany's Hendrik
Dreekman in straight sets, in the second round.

SCOTLAND'S senior clubs have been given some assurance by the Scottish
Rugby Union that the perceived problems arising from a new sponsorship
deal with Tennents will be addressed although, as yet, little seems to
have been resolved.
The main worry is that the terms of the Tennents' deal could make it
difficult for clubs to negotiate individual contracts which, for most,
means the difference between financial success or otherwise.
Bill Hogg, the SRU's chief executive, said at the conclusion of a
''closed doors'' meeting at Murrayfield last night with the sponsors and
representatives of the premier clubs -- the 32 which form the elite
strata in the reformatted league structure next season: ''We will be
issuing further guidelines to clubs in the near future.''
In a prepared statement, Hogg went on to say: ''Representatives of the
SRU, the clubs who previously met at Myreside, and Tennents have had a
positive meeting, at which various concerns of the clubs were addressed,
clarified, and others will be taken on board by the general committee
and Tennents.
''Further guidelines will be issued by the Union to all clubs to
clarify how the sponsorship will operate. All at the meeting agreed to
work together in resolving issues to the mutual benefit of the clubs and
Tennents.''

ON the surface at least, the Partick Thistle party which yesterday
returned from a laudable draw in the Intertoto Cup was in good humour,
but there were rumblings of discontent. The players, it seems are not
enamoured by the refusal of the club to pay bonuses for each of the four
ties in their group and requested a meeting with manager John Lambie in
Austria to air their grievance.
The chances are they will not win their case, although they did get
some pocket money to spend on lemonade on Sunday night following their
2-2 draw with Linzer ASK. Chairman Jim Oliver remains adamant that the
deal struck, which involves a bonus if the team qualifies, is fair.
''There is always unrest among players,'' he said, ''but bonuses should
only be paid for achieving something. The four-game campaign in this
competition effectively is the equivalent of a single cup-tie elsewhere.
If we win through to the next stage there will be bonus money paid. As
it is, the players already get appearance money.
''And we have to remember that the club takes them abroad, feeds them,
clothes them, and gives them money to spend.''
Lambie pointed out that the club made more than any other for winning
promotion last year, ''and that's probably true for staying up this
season.''
Some of the players feel differently, although none was willing to go
public. They had anticipated win money for each game as some
compensation for playing during the summer when they might have been
enjoying a break in the sun.
However, the dispute did not appear to have any influence on what was
a decent display in Linz, especially after having to recover from a
two-goal deficit.
Lambie, none the less, confirms that he is a hard man to please. ''I
felt we played the wrong kind of game for a while,'' he said.
''These teams give you plenty of time at the back and we played and
met lots of short passes there when it is not really our game.
''I prefer to see us play the Scottish style, aggressive and running
at people. When Ian Cameron and Alan Dinnie did that we caused them
problems.
''If the Austrians represent the quality of the group I would be
confident of qualifying, but I'm sure that Zagreb, for one, will be a
really good team.
''We have got to win our home games if we are to have any chance of
progressing to the next stage.''
That would mean reaching the last four of a competition which, perhaps
uniquely, has no trophy to be won. Even so, Oliver believes it was the
right decision to enter. ''We will probably meet our costs with money
from UEFA and keeping our home gate cash, but we'll see.
''I was surprised at clubs who have said how much a UEFA Cup place has
meant to them pulled out of what is the easiest route to getting into
it. I think too much is made of playing four games in the summer. For
our players it replaces pre-season training.''
Dinnie, who had an impressive game was honest enough to admit that ASK
were a ''bad'' team who should have been beaten.
''We will look to win our remaining games to qualify,'' said the
former Dundee player who hopes the next away trip will be less taxing in
travel terms.
The two planes and a three-and-a-half hour coach run did not impress
the men at the sharp end, but they will still be keen to please their
own fans against Keflavik on Saturday.
Lambie would like to have a new signing by then, but thinks it will
take a little longer to get his man, probably Neil Caldwell, who was
freed by Rangers.

TO describe Kenny Dalglish as enigmatic is an understatement. The man
who remains Scotland's favourite soccer son seems to delight in doing
the unexpected.
More than that, he appears positively to relish the consternation he
causes in certain circles when he makes one of his abrupt, but momentous
decisions.
Yesterday the news broke that Dalglish had ''moved upstairs'' at
Blackburn Rovers, taking a post as director of football and allowing his
highly respected lieutenant Ray Harford to become team manager.
Comparisons began to be drawn with the events of four-and-a-half years
ago when Dalglish turned his back on the manager's job at Liverpool and
took a six-month sabbatical from football.
Those who went that route, however, missed several salient points.
First, in this situation, Dalglish remains with Blackburn in a
position of importance. Secondly, the move mirrors a growing trend in
the game where a two-tier managerial structure is often preferred by
major clubs. Thirdly, it looks certain that this new set-up at Ewood
Park was suggested by Dalglish himself who, as always, is aware of
changes taking place in the game across Europe.
At Lazio, the former Italian international goalkeeper, Dino Zoff, is
the high-profile official in charge of the playing side with a coach
involved in the day-to-day running of the team.
At Bayern Munich, the comparison is probably even closer to the
Blackburn scenario. There, Franz Beckenbauer, the Kaiser of German
soccer, is deeply immersed in the playing side of the Bundesliga club --
but someone else works directly with the players just as Ray Harford
does at Ewood Park.
Yet, when players are being bought it is Beckenbauer who takes the
most prominent role, as in the buying of Jurgen Klinsmann from Spurs.
When White Hart Lane supremo Alan Sugar was told over the telephone that
England's newly crowned Player of the Year was returning to his
homeland, it was the Kaiser himself who broke the news.
Beckenbauer, quite simply, is Bayern. He has the reputation and the
glamour which can attract top players to the club. And he has the
stature which will open doors for him around the football world.
Dalglish falls into that same special category. Striker Alan Shearer,
who has committed himself to the club or a further four years, has
admitted that it was Dalglish who attracted him to join Blackburn rather
than the unfashionable club itself.
Others have followed Shearer's example and most would agree that as
well as the prospect of joining a growing club backed by millionaire
Jack Walker's millions, Dalglish was always the trump card.
Now he has achieved what he wanted to do most of all, to deliver Uncle
Jack the championship, Dalglish has clearly looked at the set-up and
suggested change.
It is typical of the man that he would want Harford to be promoted
and, at the same time, give credit for the work he has done in tandem
with Dalglish as Rovers have been transformed.
Harford left the manager's job at Wimbledon to team up with Dalglish
in October, 1991. The Scot admired the Yorkshireman's coaching abilities
and gave him great freedom as the rebuilding of the once famous old club
was carried out.
Now Harford has a title to match his talents, the Blackburn players
will recognise and respect his new title, and the clubs who hovered
around Ewood Park throughout the summer with the No.2 as their
managerial prey have been given their answer.
Ray Harford stays where he is because he is important to Blackburn, a
club which is not going to be content to relax -- will not be allowed to
relax with Dalglish still in a position of power -- and will look for
further honours in the seasons ahead.
As for Dalglish, his partnership with Harford remains in place. The
two men have always worked closely and that will not change. Dalglish,
however, will have more opportunities to see how the game is developing
in other parts of the world.
In common with most British managers he has been at the mercy of a
demanding fixture list which allows little time for anything other than
the grind of game after game after game in a season which is
over-crowded and which would not be tolerated in most other countries.
Dalglish could, for example, spend a week with Ajax and see what can
be learned from the new European Cup-holders. Or, he could search the
Continent for the talent which Blackburn will need to retain their
new-found status.
Whatever he does will be immensely influential. How could it be other
than that for the gritty Glaswegian who has pursued soccer success
relentlessly since he was a teenager with Celtic?
Sure, he will spend more time on the golf course near his Southport
home, but his committment to Blackburn Rovers will remain as intense as
ever it was with his previous clubs.
He won countless medals as a player with Celtic and Liverpool, he
played 324 games for the Parkhead side and scored 167 goals; for
Liverpool he played 515 games and scored 173 goals and he remains
Scotland's most-capped player appearing 102 times for his country and
scoring 30 goals, another record he shares with Denis Law.
Now, he may have stepped out of the limelight and away from the glare
of publicity he never has enjoyed, but Blackburn will still retain the
stamp which Dalglish has placed upon the club.
And no-one will ever replace him in the hearts of the people from that
grim and gloomy Lancashire town who saw him make all their football
dreams come true.

IT was Dominic Cork, naturally enough, who popped open the champagne
at Lord's yesterday following his dream England Test debut, when he took
seven for 43 as West Indies were bowled out for 223 and beaten by 72
runs in the second Test at Lord's.
The fast-medium bowler was given the man-of-the-match award but the
game threw up a host of fine home performances, to which captain Mike
Atherton rightly paid tribute.
There were first-innings half-centuries from Robin Smith and Graham
Thorpe, a five-wicket haul from Angus Fraser, Smith's second knock of
90, Graeme Hick's 67, and Thorpe's 42 after hasving been hospitalised by
Courtney Walsh.
Then, even though Cork stole the show yesterday to thrill 8000
spectators and several million more armchair fans, Darren Gough played
his part with three wickets, while wicketkeeper Alec Stewart held a fine
catch to dismiss Brian Lara.
''We were always under pressure, and when people perform well under
those circumstances they deserve all the credit going,'' said Atherton,
who picked out Smith's second-innings contribution as being ''worth its
weight in gold.''
The captain added: ''We've set ourselves a standard here and we don't
want to fall below it. We want to see this kind of performance
reproduced. Provided my guys are convinced we are going to win the
series I think we will. But I would expect it to be close.''
Chairman of selectors, Ray Illingworth, added: ''I bet they'll have no
trouble selling tickets for the third Test at Edgbaston. I said we've
got to win tight-fought matches and we've done that here. It will stand
the team in good stead.''
And of yesterday's play he said: ''Cork bowled brilliantly. He's shown
he's got the ability to take wickets and make runs at Test level. Now
it's up to him to show he can be England's all-rounder.''
Illingworth revealed he had not yet had time to discuss the captaincy
issue amid the excitement of yesterday's series-levelling victory. But
it now looks a sure thing that Atherton will be reappointed for the
second half of this summer sometime during the Edgbaston Test.
He has got his team fighting after a miserable, nine-wicket defeat at
Headingley a fortnight ago. And, not surprisingly, Illingworth was
equally delighted that his decision to change the Lord's side at the
last moment -- axing keeper Steve Rhodes and asking Stewart to double up
again -- worked out.
When West Indies resumed yesterday morning at 68 for one, with Lara on
38, a victory target of 296 looked within reach. And, for another 30
minutes, there was little sign of a breakthrough as the tourists moved
to 54.
But when Gough found the edge, Stewart dived left and held a
one-handed chance. England were delighted -- and understandably so
because with him gone, the door was open.
And Cork was the man to give it a good push. Jimmy Adams drove at a
widish delivery and Graeme Hick swooped, while captain Richie Richardson
fell lbw for a ninth-ball duck and England were on their way.
So a victory that had looked so unlikely on Saturday afternoon when
England were in trouble at 51 for two in their second innings, only 10
runs ahead overall, had been completed with 100 minutes to spare.
When the dusrt had settled Cork stressed that England's victory had
been built on a fine team performance. ''Robin Smith's batting was
vital, as was Graham Thorpe's bravery in our second innings. Then there
was Angus Fraser's five wickets in their first innings, and Alec
Stewart's brilliant catch to get rid of Lara,'' he said.
Cork, who has appeared in eight one-day internationals, is a graduate
of four England A tours and was desperate to get rid of the tag of being
a limited-overs specialist.
''I've always said I didn't want to be classed as just a one-day
player and hopefully this goes some way to disproving that,'' he said.
''But I've still got to go out and perform again and for the moment I'm
just happy to be involved and to be part of a team that has beaten the
West Indies for the first time at Lord's since 1957.

SOBA UP proved that last week's victory in the Edinburgh Gold Cup was
no fluke when she returned to the same track yesterday and trotted up in
the Moorfoot Hills Handicap Stakes.
A 20-1 outsider last Monday, she was sent off as 13-8 favourite but
the ease with which she disposed of her four opponents made even those
odds look generous.
Jim Goldie's Thisonesforalice made all the early running but when Tony
Culhane shook up his mount just more than a furlong from home the filly
quickened into the lead and won with a length-and-a-quarter to spare.
Vain Prince won the twentieth race of his illustrious career with
comparative ease in the Yvonne Murray MBE Handicap Stakes.
The gelding, who cost 8000 guineas as a yearling, has now won seven
times on the Flat and 13 times over jumps for trainer Nigel Tinkler.
Everyone Can Dream, who bolted on the way to the start at Nottingham,
was on his best behaviour for the Craigleith Claiming Stakes, sprinting
in by six lengths ahead of the favourite, Chilibang Bang.
It was Mark Johnstone's forty-sixth winner of the season.
His wife, Deirdre, was delighted by the ease with which the
two-year-old colt won after a 12-week layoff, but her mood changed to
dismay soon afterwards when the winner was claimed for #6000 by Rosewell
trainer Peter Monteith.
However, there was some compensation for Johnstone and his wife when
Russian Heroine (7-4) won the Firth of Forth Handicap Stakes to give
them a double.
* RUNNING plans for the Budweiser Irish Derby were thrown into
complete disarray yesterday when doubts emerged about the participation
of both leading contenders.
Not only did Celtic Swing's owner, Peter Savill, describe his colt's
chances of running as ''no better than 50-50'' but connections of
Lammtarra also revealed that the Derby winner has a slight injury.
The likelihood of good-to-firm ground at the Curragh is deterring
Savill from committing his Prix du Jockey Club winner to the Irish
Classic with the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud in France now a serious
alternative.
And Lammtarra was put on hold when he was found to be ''slightly
behind in preparations.''

AFTER a spell of heavy rain, a not uncommon occurrence in Scotland,
you venture on to the course and hit a ball into trees.
There, your backswing is restricted by a large branch and you figure
that if you hit it, you are going to be soaked by a shower of water from
the tree. So you give the branch a shake first. Is this legal?
* NO, get your waterproofs on and prepare for the worst.
Decision 13-2/23 rules that such an action is improving the area of
your intended swing by eliminating the distraction caused by the water.
It's a straightaway two-stroke penalty.

THE NatWest Trophy gets under way today, with Scotland pitched in
against Nottinghamshire in the first round and Trent Bridge the venue.
It would not take much from the Scots to improve after their B &amp; H
debacle in which they played four matches and lost by a distance each
time against the major counties.
However, there was a substantial lifting of standards by the Scots
against the West Indian tourists a few weeks back, enough to raise
expectations for today's match.
Having tried the new order during the previous one-day games, Scotland
again call upon one of the old guard to get their innings off to the
best possible start.
Bruce Patterson has scored enough runs to make it impossible for the
selectors not to notice him, and he will top the order against Notts
with captain Alastair Storie.
The decision on who should face the new ball was made simple by the
withdrawal of Stenhousemuir's Iain Philip, ruled out with a hand injury.
Top scorer against the West Indies, Philip's damaged hand is a legacy
from that encounter, having been cracked on the knuckles by a lifter
from Winston Benjamin.
Philip had to give up wicketkeeping duties for his club on Saturday,
had difficulty in batting, and as a result decided to miss out on the
trip to the Test location.
Clydesdale's Donald Orr will take over behind the stumps, while
filling a batting berth in the middle order.
A C Storie (West of Scotland), (Captain), B M W Patterson (Ayr), G B J
McGurk (Grange), M G D Allingham (Heriots), G Salmond (Arbroath), M D
Marshall, J G Williamson, I M Stanger, D A Orr, (All Clydesdale), J W
Govan (Carlton) and K Thomson (Strathmore).
* NORTHAMPTON maintained their lead at the top of the Britannic
Assurance County Championship table with a sixth consecutive win in the
competition.
Allan Lamb's men needed to bat once against Leicestershire, dismissing
the visitors for 160 in their second innings. Scores:
Hampshire 428 (M Nicholas 73, V P Terry 73) and 344-5 dec (M Nicholas
138 no, P R Whitaker 119); Worcestershire 289 (D A Leatherdale 83, J N B
Bovill 4-66) and 413. Hampshire (24pts) beat Worcestershire (5pts) by 70
runs.
Lancashire 496 (M Watkinson 161, S P Titchard 130, M Ilott 5-86) and
106-0 (N J Speak 64 no); Essex 248 (G A Gooch 123, Wasim Akram 4-86) and
350 (D D J Robinson 86. Lancashire (24pts) beat Essex (2pts) by 10 wkts.
Northamptonshire 564 (D Capel 175, R J Warren 75); Leicestershire 367
(B F Smith 112) and 160 (N A Mallender 4-49). Northamptonshire (24pts)
beat Leicestershire (6pts) by an innings and 37 runs.
Kent 533 (P A de Silva 225, M A Ealham 121 and 287-3 dec (N R Taylor
99 no); Nottinghamshire 491-9 dec (R T Robinson 196 and 331-7 (R T
Robinson 88). Nottinghamshire (23pts) beat Kent (6pts) by 3 wkts.
Somerset 178 (K A Parsons 59, E Giddins 6-73) and 345 (P Holloway 129
no, E E Hemmings 4-57); Sussex 227 (A Wells 106, Mushtaq Ahmed 6-54) and
172 (Mushtaq Ahmed 4-62). Somerset (20pts) beat Sussex (5pts) by 124
runs.
Glamorgan 450 (P A Cottey 125) and 329 (M P Maynard 97, H A G Anthony
91, N M Kendrick 59, M A Butcher 4-72); Surrey 397 (N Shahid 125, A J
Hollioake 88, J D Ratcliffe 56, S D Thomas 4-95) and 302-9 (A D Brown
92, J D Ratcliffe 75). Surrey (7pts) drew with Glamorgan (8pts).

Right: club at base of fingers, thumb and hand together.
Wrong: club in the palm and a gap between thumb and hand.
Check the
left grip
* This week's tip comes from ALASTAIR FORROW, the professional at
Whitecraigs Golf Club, Glasgow.
DO you suffer from a slice or lack of distance? Then take a tip and
check your left-hand grip. Many handicap golfers settle for the comfort
zone by holding the club in the palm of the hand and placing thumb down
the top of the grip. If you can see fewer than two knuckles, it is a
poor, weak grip.
The remedy to strengthen the grip is to secure the club beneath the
heel of the hand in the fingers and have at least two to three knuckles
in view.
The thumb should be placed slightly right of centre with no space
between the bottom of the thumb and the hand. They should be stuck
together as if by glue.
A good left-hand grip helps promote a better takeaway, a better
release at impact, and will improve distance and accuracy. It may take a
great deal of practice to feel comfortable -- but the perseverance will
prove worthwhile.

DIRECTORS of London &amp; Clydeside (L&amp;C) have agreed takeover terms from
fellow housebuilder Wilson Connolly which values the Glasgow-based group
at #11.8m.
Terms are six Wilson shares for every seven London &amp; Clydeside,
valuing each at 130p, with a cash alternative of 125p. The news came
after the market closed yesterday, when L&amp;C shares were quoted at 110p.
Directors holding 49% of the equity have agreed to accept the bid.
The two companies have been in talks since March and L&amp;C directors
considered accepting the offer from Wilson Connolly was the best way
forward for shareholders, taking into account the prospects of a slow
recovery in profits if the company were to remain independent, even
under a new management team.
L&amp;C reported profits for the six months to March down from #327,000 to
#281,000. Before a property wrote-off there were profits of #702,000 but
they came largely from the sale of part of the Darnley site.
Housebuilding encountered difficult trading conditions, with sales down
from 118 to 108 units.
Britain's fifth-largest housebuilder, Wilson Connolly already has a
Scottish housebuilding operation under the Wilcon name, of a similar
size to London &amp; Clydeside's 250-a-year output.
Ian Black, managing director Wilson Connolly, said the purchase was a
good fit. He added it was too early to assess the effect of the deal on
L&amp;C employees but pointed out that its sites still had to be managed and
the office in Glasgow would still be needed.
The deal is something of a homecoming for Mr Black as he was born and
bred in Glasgow, attending Paisley Grammar School and he worked in the
city until the age of 36.

SOMETIMES it's not enough to just have an eye for a picture. If you
haven't got the right equipment to back you up, then you easily could
fail to get the pictures you're after or, at the very least, experience
the frustration of knowing the results you achieved could have been much
better. It's a common predicament, but it's one that, with a little
foresight, could be avoided, and it shouldn't involve you breaking the
bank.
First you have to decide what it is that you're hoping to achieve, and
how advanced you want to become. At the most basic level the single use
camera -- David Bailey's version, complete with Bailey logos and
built-in flash is priced at under #10 -- can produce perfectly
acceptable snaps, particularly in sunny conditions.
They have other advantages too: because they're cheap they're also
relatively expendable, so you take more risks with them. If you're on
the beach at a holiday resort, for example, you don't have to worry too
much about sand and seawater getting into the mechanism, and if you
fancy a quick dip there's no tempting camera gear left unguarded for a
thief to make off with.
The most simple compact cameras won't offer you much more in the way
of facilities than the single use cameras will. Move up into the #40-#50
range and beyond, however, and things get a little more advanced, and
then it's up to you to decide which things would really help and improve
your photography: one man's useful feature is another's worthless
gimmick.
A camera such as the #50 Fuji Clearshot Super for example, offers a
switch which allows you to change to a panoramic mode, something which
is proving increasingly popular with landscape photographers, who like
the options this long, thin format opens up. If that's what you're after
then the camera is a bargain, but if it's portraiture which takes your
fancy then paying for a panoramic option makes little sense.
Some classic compact features are there largely to save time and
effort -- such things as drop-in film loading, motorised film transport
and autofocus. You could cope with all of these three functions, but if
you're primary aim is to cover something like a wedding or a party or
snaps of the kids in their unguarded moments, then the seconds that will
be saved might be the difference between a delightful candid moment and
a self-conscious and static portrait.
Other functions are designed to improve the actual picture-taking
process. Red-eye reduction, for example, can help you overcome one of
the biggest problems you'll face when shooting portraits with flash,
while a built-in zoom lens might bring you pictures which the standard
lens simply couldn't offer.
What else might you need? Well there are plenty of features to
consider: the Konica Big Mini Zoom TR, priced #170, contains a neat pair
of built-in legs which can be used as a tripod. The Konica Mermaid, at
#200, is even more striking: it's basically the company's Big Mini
compact enclosed in a waterproof jacket so that it be used safely on the
beach and in the water. And it's shockproof if you should happen to drop
it.
Because of their size, compacts are of course the ideal cameras to
take everywhere, but if you want to take your photography really
seriously then it's likely you'll be looking at the single-lens reflex
market. Here the sky's the limit in terms of features and -- it has to
be said -- price too. Faced with a bewildering array of cameras to
choose from, it's important not to panic: decide what you need for the
kind of photography you want to do, and don't get taken in by
unnecessary gadgets.
You could, for example, pick up a Russian-made Zenit 122 for as little
little as #60 new. For the price it's obviously very basic, and not
particularly flexible, but you do get the key SLR advantage, in that you
see the image directly through the camera's lens, and can swop lenses as
required. That helps you to compose and focus quickly and accurately.
For #190 you can buy a lot more in the way of features by investing in
the Praktica BX20s. This is a good quality and adaptable camera,
suitable for all kinds of use: it has extensive viewfinder information
along with through the lens flashmetering, which is a real bonus if
you're photographing inside on a regular basis and want to get easy and
accurate exposures when using flash.
The SLR market has embraced autofocus extensively in recent years, and
systems now are fast and efficient and a real alternative to manually
focusing the camera. All kinds of photographers find autofocus
invaluable. Areas where it is particularly useful include sport --
especially the most fast moving, such as motor racing -- wildlife and
any situation where your focusing has to be really fast and precise.
Moving on to video the first thing you'll find is that camcorders
feature zoom lenses and autofocus systems as standard, which sounds like
a real boon except that like most gadgetry it tends to get used too much
simply because it's there. A shaky zoom in on a subject is not the most
attractive feature of a home movie, and once you've reached the
telephoto end of your range it's remarkably difficult to hold the camera
still. With video, one of the most important extras of all you can
invest in is a good quality tripod, one which will keep the camera firm
even if it's a windy day.
The other key point to watch with a camcorder is size. The quality of
some of the smaller cameras now is superb: they generally cost more than
the large more cumbersome machines, but their portability could mean the
difference between you bothering to take the camera around with you or
leaving it at home. The smallest of them these days is comparable to an
SLR camera, and they can sit all day on your shoulder with no bother.
So, to recap, don't head down to the camera shop and buy the first
do-all camera which catches your eye. Decide what your budget is, list
the features which are indispensable for your area of photography, and
choose accordingly.
Enjoy the view: the David Bailey single use camera is decorated with
his own famous images, while an SLR is a good starting point for more
serious amateur photographers

* BALMORE veterans have had three causes to celebrate recently. First,
Norman McAulay holed in one at the thirteenth in a Sunday game. The
following Thursday, during a Senior McIntyre League home match against
Dumbarton, Eric Semple holed out with his tee shot at the second, then
Bob Frazer did likewise at the sixth. Alas, the match was only halved.
All three are members of the over-70 brigade.
* THE Head Injuries Trust for Scotland (HITS) are holding a
fund-raising tournament at Hilton Park on August 31.
The event will be based on teams of three -- with the option of a

EVIDENCE that golf is a game for life is provided this week by Nancy
Mitchell, of Falkirk Tryst, who beat her age by five shots to claim top
spot in women's handicap and a share of the honours in the scratch
section, writes Douglas Lowe.
The 77-year-old 10-handicapper shot a gross 72 against a standard
scratch score of 71 for Parbusters scores of minus 9 and plus 1
respectively.
The performance came in a hidden holes competition, which she won, but
the card submitted was 18-holes strokeplay and a handicap counter which
is the requirement for Parbusters.
Nancy has been playing golf since 1921. She is a multiple winner of
the ladies' club championship, and she last won it in 1989 exactly 50
years after her first success.
Bandit of the week is another veteran, 64-year-old Jim Connell, who
beat his 24 handicap by 13 shots in the June Medal at Rothesay and has
been cut to 16 for his trouble.
The retired naval architect, originally from Glasgow, took up golf
again three years ago after a spell in Canada and could even afford to
three-putt the last green.
This week's leading scores:

FEW of the many thousands of farmers, and indeed the general public,
who visited the Royal Highland Show over the weekend will have been
aware that in terms of both financial worth and employment fish farming
is more important to Scotland than sheep production.
And as every fish farmer in the land will confirm there are almost no
subsidies, and no headage payments, without which much of rural Scotland
would soon revert to wilderness.
Two species of fish are farmed in Scotland -- salmon and trout, with
the former being concentrated in the Highlands and Islands where the
environment is a major marketing aid.
According to recent figures salmon production is worth over #250m from
a total production of 73,000 tonnes and employs a total workforce of
around 6000, of which a sizeable proportion is concentrated in the
processing sector.
Times have been very tough recently but, according to William Crowe,
the chief executive of the Scottish Salmon Growers' Association, this
year has brought some relief. ''Touch wood, we've had a reasonable 12
months but that's the first for five years.''
However, there are problems just ahead as Mr Crowe explained: ''The
crunch is coming with many farms urgently needing to reinvest and
replace cages and equipment which were first put in place around 10
years ago.''
Cages are a major capital item but work-boats are also essential.
However, on the cage front, technology has come to the assistance of the
salmon farmer. Said Mr Crowe: ''Because we are now using plastic cages
the capital cost has come down from #5000 per tonne to nearer #3000, but
in any event we are talking of many millions of pounds and the cash has
to be found from a profitable industry.''
Those profits, which have often proved elusive, are notoriously
subject to the actions of Scotland's major competitor -- Norway. Few in
the Scottish industry are certain just to what extent the Norwegian
Government supports its industry, but there is absolutely no doubt in
the mind of William Crowe that the battle is far from equal. He said:
''We have reported the Norwegians to the EFTA (European Free Trade
Association) Surveillance Complaints Authority and it is currently
investigating our anxieties.''
Of particular concern to the Scots is the degree of subsidy on freight
charges in Norway. It is estimated that these may be close to 50%.
Meanwhile virtually the only subsidy available to domestic producers
through Cal Mac ferries is about to be removed following Government
plans to alter the grant support to island communities. This will have
particularly serious implications for Orkney and Shetland where much of
the salmon industry is concentrated.
However, producers can reflect on a 22% growth in consumption during
the past year which, says Mr Crowe, could in due course see Scottish
production double over the next few years, especially if the decline in
sea fish catches continues.
The downstream effects of a larger fish-farming sector are already
becoming evident in that the large pharmaceutical companies are now
willing to invest in research and development aimed at producing
specific products for this market.
Trout production in Scotland is running at 4000 tonnes per annum and
here, too, there are signs of recovery from a near-disastrous position.
Graeme Gordon, who combines fish farming with his duties as convenor of
the Scottish Landowners' Federation, however, believes it will be
difficult for many to find the necessary cash for investing in better
processing facilities.
Mr Gordon is also keen to see the importance of fish farming
recognised in the Government's forthcoming White Paper on the future of
rural Scotland. He said: ''We want to see our industry more fully
appreciated both in terms of output and employment.''

A 23-YEAR-OLD woman has joined the new Oban mart as an assistant
auctioneer.
Sandra Wilson, who comes from Troon, is set to become part of an elite
group as there are only a couple of women auctioneers in Scotland.
But she has certainly got the right background for her new job as she
is from an auctioneering family. Her father, Sandy Wilson, and uncle,
Robbie Wilson, are both auctioneers at their family-run mart in Paisley.
Sandra has successfully trained for a diploma/HN certificate in
agriculture at a college in Ayrshire. Sandra, who is now living in
Taynuilt, near Oban, said: ''I used to go round the mart when I was
young and I have always wanted to do this. It must be in my blood.''
Tom Wallace of Argyll Auction Company said: ''I think there are only
about two women in Scotland who are auctioneers in livestock. She
applied for the job along with many others and she fought off a lot of
men to get the job.''

THE Martin Retail Group, which trades in Scotland as RS McColl, has
added 60 shops to its empire with the purchase of Glasgow-based Clark
Retail.
Ironically, Clark Retail was built from nothing by four former
employees of RS McColl who left the company after it was taken over by
Ernest Saunders' Guinness in 1985 for #24m.
Martin, which was built up and sold off by Guinness to Australian
syndicate Panfida and is now largely owned by a consortium of banks, did
not disclose the price of Clark Retail, which had shareholders' funds of
about #860,000.
The 60 Clark Retail confectionery, tobacco and newspaper outlets
(CTNs), which trade as The Newsagent and Supersweet, are concentrated in
and around Edinburgh and Glasgow.
In the year to May 1993, Clark Retail made a loss of #350,000 on
turnover of #24.3m. The group has about 320 employees.
Essex-based Martin, which trades south of the Border as Martin the
Newsagent, has more than 760 branches, about 180 of which are Scottish
RS McColls.
In the 1980s, Guinness bought the Martin newsagents chain in
south-east England, added Lavells and Lewis Meeson in the north-west,
and finally picked off McColl. By August 1985 it had a chain of more
than 1000 outlets nationwide, and started trying to impose a uniform
trading format, under the brand name Martin McColl.
Wighton Clark, then McColl's retail operations director, found the new
regime increasingly disillusioning.
Clark, deciding to set up for himself, was joined in his venture by
colleagues Gerry Daly as finance director, John Pearson as merchandise
director, and Peter MacNab as sales director.
They opened two Supersweet shops, before making an unsuccessful #155m
bid to buy the entire Martin Retail business, including McColl, from
Guinness, where Anthony Tennant had replaced Saunders at the helm.
In October 1989, Clark Retail bought a clutch of Scottish CTNs from
Forbuoys, a retailing subsidiary of Gallaher, the American tobacco
giant.
Buying more than 30 shops at a stroke, in a #2m-plus deal, transformed
Clark Retail's growth profile and took the company to 55 shops.

Ann Donald spends a night at an Edinburgh poetry club and discovers
The Yellow Cafe is brimming with talent and a drive to dispel popular
preconceived myths about poetry readings.
DJ's Frosty and Midnight 33 are pumping out a steady diet of heavy
dub, techno, and happy house. The lively throng of 20-something club
kids are grinning and chatting away over candlelit tables, while
overhead TV screens rotate a loop of scratchy, humorous videos. The
basement cellar is full to bursting and I'm vainly searching for any
vague indication that this is, in fact, a poetry club.
For The Yellow Cafe, housed in Edinburgh's Negociants cafe-bar,
torpedos every preconceived notion one could ever hold about such a
venue. With not even the whiff of a Gauloise to sully the air, nor the
sight of a pensive black polo-neck wearer about to vent their pent-up
existential angst, the only concession to traditional cafe/poetry
society is the vast amount of black coffee consumed greedily throughout
the evening.
According to The Yellow Cafe founder and poet, Rodney Relax, the
ambience is vital if the public's cynical preconceptions of a poetry
reading are ever to change. ''We're not going to bully them,'' stresses
the Edinburgh College of Art writer-in-residence. ''We just want to give
as many people as possible easy access so that they can make up their
own minds.''
To this end, the energising Relax has teamed up with graphics lecturer
Jonathon Harker to create a basement space where poetry, music, visuals,
and film coexist and feed off each other. As Harker, whose own Degree
show was inspired by a series of Rodney's poems entitled Queens of
Techno, explains: ''It's more a holistic creative thing than a literary
event. That's why I've got my students from the art college involved
doing everything from making videos to designing sheets of typography,
wall hangings and using projectors.''
The fruit of Harker and Relax's labour is not limited to those
''static'' art pieces adorning the Cafe walls, but smaller
consumer-friendly gifts intended to be taken away by the curious
audience. Jenny Holzer-inspired quirky slogans such as ''what surrounds
you'' or ''everything must be seen by you and done by you'' have been
printed up on tiny calling cards that litter the tables. The
sun-coloured postcards emblazoned with poems bearing titles like
''Eurostars'' and ''Punk Rock Revival 1997'' are tucked up neatly in
plastic packages alongside the handprinted typographic flyers and
posters; all of which are snapped up by the end of the night. ''The
point of that,'' says Harker, ''is that you don't just sit down, listen
to the poems then go home. You can take something away with you and read
it the next morning. It's all meant to resonate.''
For many of those involved in The Yellow Cafe, the club is just the
latest incarnation of something that started three years ago in the
Antiquary Bar, Stockbridge. From these embryonic readings, a pool of
writers that included Kim Oliver, Irvine Welsh, and Sandi Craigie went
on to find a vital outlet for their work in Rebel Inc. In an attempt to
break free from the usual sterile poetry reading circuit, the magazine
organised ''happenings'' to enable these poets and writers to perform
their work in more relaxed surroundings.
As former assistant-editor at Rebel Inc and a Cafe regular, Sandie
Craigie is well placed to comment on the changes on the Edinburgh
''scene''. ''There was a big gap when Rebel Inc left'' (and editor Kevin
Williamson moved to Glasgow), she says. ''I think this club is opening
up even further than Rebel Inc with mair of an emphasis on music. As
well as that there's a lot mair honest and natural writing getting
through and a lot mair folk getting up and daen their stuff. There's nae
pretention about it at all.''
Certainly the performers on this evening's bill bears this out. First
up is LA-born Marina Blake, whose alternating spacey yet chilling
portrayal of the ''like, totally bummed'' heroine in her short story,
Nosferatu -- The Valley Girl, was sublime. The Serpent's Tail author is
in full agreement with Craigie. ''There's definitely a warm, club
atmosphere which is much more informal and supportive than any other
poetry reading I've done,'' she says.
Next up is the Opportunity Knocks or ''open mike'' spot where a
hotchpotch of unknown, semi-known, and published writers grab the
spotlight for a fleeting five minutes. The Man In Black, Barry Graham,
blasts off with a vibrant piece about Vlad the Possil Impaler who
receives his unlikely comeuppance at the fists of a wee, speccy guy.
Gavin Jones puzzles the audience with a weird sci-fi pastiche, then cult
figure Keith Mackie winds-up the audience with one of his infamous
''splatter'' poems. In deadpan tones the man in the moustache delivers a
visceral tale of severed torsos, sinews, and eyeballs, all culminating
in the revelation that God Is A Serial Killer. Mackie's coup d'etat is a
parting shot explaining that ''it's all done in the best possible
taste.''
However, the validity and vitality of a club like the Yellow Cafe
becomes glaringly obvious when Alison Death takes the stage. Having only
read thrice before, the Goth-dressed performance poet mesmerises an
unsuspecting audience with her passionate but developed work. From
lambasting ''schemies'' to delivering a poignant tribute to Ruth Ellis
and a searing indictment on the schizophrenic nature of the Festival
city, the spiky-haired poet blew a cheering audience away. ''I want to
exorcise my demons,'' smiles Death who reveals that she was first
published in The People's Friend. ''Words are my weapons that I use to
get back at the people that battered me.''
As Marina Blake succinctly sums up the importance of the venue:
''Shakespeare had his day and that was great. But different things are
happening now and the new, innovative, and exciting poetry needs a
similar forum. And that's what the Yellow Cafe is.'' With plans to
diversify into publishing books and pamphlets this band of
well-organised poetic mavericks will ensure that they leave a suitable
legacy that testifies to the influence they will hopefully have over a
new generation of performance poets and novelists.
You can take something away with you and read it the next morning.
It's all meant to resonate.
Shakespeare had his day and that was great. But different things are
happening now

AN excellent year for silage boosted milk producers' incomes last
year, according to the Scottish Agricultural College.
Results from its Milk Manager dairy costings show increased yields of
nearly 200 litres per cow in the 1994-95 quota year at an average 5949
litres per cow -- despite an 8% reduction in concentrate use.
Area adviser David Scrimgeour said: ''The high-quality first cut
silage allowed farmers to reduce concentrates, with no reduction in milk
yields.
''This was reflected in a 20% increase in the amount of milk from
forage and shows what can be obtained from high-quality silage. Many
farmers adjusted concentrate inputs to avoid exceeding quota.''
Margin-over-concentrates rose by 8% to average #1149 per cow and
19.32p per litre.

THE tropical radiance of the past few days has done nothing to lift
Britain's miserable spirit. For according to a new poll by Gallup we are
among the most discontented people in the world. If given the chance 38%
of us would hotfoot it out of the country tomorrow, leaving only the
Venezuelans more ready to tie on the luggage labels and send themselves
packing.
Three years into the kind of invisible recovery which delights
economists but creates scant joy among the public the prospect now of a
new British leader does little to shift the gloom. Why? In searching for
an explanation perhaps we need to ask another question: Whatever
happened to the notion that this would be the decade when honour shaped
the new order of government in this country?
Well, so much for the tenderised nineties. There is a sneering
loutishness in high places here and it has decency on the mat. We see it
in the bull-necked emergence of businessmen who believe their roaring
greed makes them invincible. We see it, too, in the arrival before the
cameras of a certain type of politician whose unearned dominance amounts
to the bully's push. Tony Marlow is a perfect example. He stands on that
well-trodden lawn before the Commons, and he tells us that like everyone
else he believes: John Major is a nice guy, but he's a loser.
Most of us know that Major has not been an impressive Prime Minister
(in the Gallup poll only 21% approved of his premiership), but if we
take the phrase nice guy to mean a decent man then in that context
Marlow's smooth demeanour barely conceals his committed menace. He
rubbishes niceness as a weakness, but in preference to what? Political
yobbery, the shaming bawl of xenophobes? What rules in his circle is the
voice of arrogant hypocrisy, the stroppy priggishness of the
Euro-sceptics which is meant to illustrate contempt for foreign ways of
doing things, but its real concern is one of self-interest, not national
interest. In the event of our greater participation in the EU, the
Euro-sceptics know power will drain away from themselves.
Of course politicians always claim to understand power and respect it,
yet power is still devilishly tricky to get right if it is to be
something more than a hard, cold-blooded game: Survival of the fittest.
Dog Eat Dog. Deliver or get out. What everyone is seeking, though, is
the conviction that they count for something, that they matter to
others, that they receive due recognition for their work and from their
peers, and the good politician, of whatever party, recognises these
aspirations in every single constituent.
But the bleak findings of Gallup suggest people have little faith in
any who would rule them today. Instead, the politics of Britain in the
mid-nineties is covered by a pall of disillusionment and suspicion, and
part of the reason is linked to the post-cold war phenomenon. For
Germany this has brought the specific problem of unification. For Italy
the party system, established after 1945, has collapsed. But something
even more profound may be happening all over the democratic world.
Now that the battle between communism and pluralism is over there is
no longer a fight to the death between two mighty but irreconcilable
ideas. As a result politics has turned into a relatively unexciting
competition between rival versions of the same idea, and as parties and
politicians themselves become greyer they fail to attract the old
loyalties.
Some years ago, in the middle of the Maastricht furore, John Major was
asked at a Downing Street reception how he endured the constant
undermining from within Conservative ranks. ''By knowing that there are
other more important things in my life than being here,'' he said,
gesturing towards the state grandeur of the pillared room. And today how
does he feel when the possibility of being ousted is more evident than
ever?
Major is shrewd enough to have a contingency plan in this pocket and
it might very well be this: should he fail in the first ballot Michael
Heseltine steps forward to win and, with Douglas Hurd decently vacating
office, the new PM turns the old PM into the Foreign Secretary, thus
stymying the Euro-sceptics. But if Major just squeaks by it will surely
be more of the same, and, as the City has already noted, the wounded
animal vowing to fight on is the worst scenario of all. Dog eat dog. A
hard, cold-blooded game. If politics continues in this manner, some day
there will be only one dog left, a thought to make the rest of us even
more sick to our stomachs.

THE Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors in Scotland has
highlighted a five-point plan in its submissions to the Scottish Office
on the proposed white paper on Rural Policy.
It calls for payments to maintain people and jobs in agriculture and
forestry in rural areas:
* Planning policies that allow generation of non-agricultural jobs.
* Better public transport with maintenance of train services.
* Provision of land for essential rural housing.
* Energy and waste disposal strategies.
George Gourlay, chairman of the RICS rural policy working party said:
''I do not believe that radical change is required immediately but the
Scottish Office must encourage a co-ordinated approach to the
countryside. A balance has to be struck between all the competing
priorities of housing, employment, conservation, agriculture, transport
and development.''

ASSOCIATED Nursing Services, which intends to change its name to ANS,
continues to benefit from growing demand for private nursing homes as
the population ages and the NHS and social services offload their
responsibilities.
Profits last year rose by 14.4% to #2.7m with turnover up 7% to
#20.6m. The final dividend is raised by 50% to 2.25p taking the total
shareholders' payment for the year to 3p. This compares very favourably
with last year's 2p dividend.
The nursing home industry is very capital-hungry. The appetite for
rights issues by shareholders is not finite and so companies are looking
for alternative forms of financing their development programmes.
ANS has pioneered the use of joint ventures with financial
institutions to fund its expansion. Under these joint ventures it
receives an operating management fee and a share of the retained
profits. Two new partnerships are due to be announced in the next couple
of weeks.
This means that the only constraint on its rate of growth is finding
suitable sites. ANS intends to increase its number of beds in operation
by 70% between now and the end of next year, to just under 3000.
Sites earmarked for development include a 120-bed home in Falkirk. ANS
already operates in Scotland with its Downley Court home in Glasgow and
Braid Hills in Liberton, Edinburgh, a joint venture home which opened in
January. The 120-bed home, aimed primarily at the middle to top end of
the market, is so far one-third full.
For the current year analysts are expecting ANS to make taxable
profits of #3.8m. The upbeat trading statement saw the shares gain 3p to
188p.

SHARE prices crashed after Welsh Secretary John Redwood resigned from
the Cabinet to challenge John Major for the leadership of the
Conservative Party.
The FTSE-100 index crashed 70.2 points to 2309.2, wiping 2% off the
value of leading shares. This was its biggest fall since February 24
last year and chartists feel the FTSE may next test support at around
3250.
''There was just a massive lack of buying interest. The move down was
very much due to futures. No-one wants to get involved until we get a
clearer picture of what's going on,'' one senior trader said.
Government bonds and the pound were particularly badly hit by the
turmoil in the Conservative Party, piling even more pressure on
beleaguered shares.
The September long gilt future fell 1[1/2] to 103[3/4], while sterling
shed almost two pfennigs to DM2.2066.
Dealers' screens were a sea of red as share prices were marked down
across the board. But mid-range companies suffered less than blue chips.
The FTSE Mid-250 index fell 37.8 points or just over 1% to 3625.5.
The privatised utilities took a hammering as investors feared an early
general election. British Telecom lost 10p to 393p, British Gas dropped
9[1/2]p to 294[1/2]p and the share price of every electricity company
fell.
Eastern Group lost 27p to 644p despite its announcement of a higher
dividend. ScottishPower was down 9p at 327 and Scottish Hydro-Electric
fell 8p to 320p.
Water companies were also punished. Severn Trent shed 26p to 536p and
North West Water plunged 24p to 554p. South Staffordshire was the only
one to remain unscathed, unchanged at 2210p.
Shell Transport &amp; Trading was the only share in the FTSE-100 to
register an advance. It rose 4p to 753p, encouraged by the rise of its
sister company Royal Dutch Petroleum in Amsterdam and a switch of
investments from Royal Dutch back to Shell UK as adverse reaction to the
Brent Spar saga melted away.
Kleinwort Benson also bucked the market's downward trend, rising 7p to
725p after Dresdner Bank said it would offer 725p per share in its
well-publicised bid for the UK merchant bank.
''It's a fair price for it,'' one dealer said. ''I think a few of the
people were hoping to get 750p, but it will go through at 725p,'' he
added.
Reports that Asprey the jeweller is set to plunge into the red after
heavy writedowns pushed its shares down 7p to 59p.
Dwyer Estates unveiled a 133% jump in half-year profits and announced
a resumption of dividend payouts, sending its shares up 3p to 36p.
Associated Nursing was another winner, up 3p to 188p in response to its
higher dividend.
Allen, the building-to-civil engineering group, doubled pre-tax
profits for the second consecutive year, but held steady at 163p.
A buoyant trading update from WPP, the world's biggest advertising
group, failed to make any impression in the market gloom. It stayed
static at 122p, even after chief executive Martin Sorrell won
shareholder backing for a modified less generous pay package.
Cordiant, formerly known as Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, eased a penny to 105p
despite WPP's good news.
Cable &amp; Wireless continued to slide after a strong run on speculation
that British Telecom may launch a takeover bid. The Mercury phone parent
lost 16p to 413p.

<TEXT>
IN a display of academic pique Dr Alan Riach has assumed that he is an
authority on my reading, writing, and study habits (June 15). He is as
mistaken on that account as he is on so many other things in Scottish
literature since the Act of Union.
He has, on his own admission, finally abandoned a debate about the
greatest poets in Scottish history to spend more time on The Waste Land
with Ezra Pound and Hugh MacDiarmid.
Despite two lengthy contributions to the debate he could not bring
himself to mention either the name or the poetry of Robert Burns. That
omission speaks volumes aand inflicts more damage on the credibility of
Dr Riach's opinions than the imagined stones he accuses me of hurling.
Robert Burns is the imperishable voice of poetic beauty in Scotland:
Or like the snow falls in the river,
A moment white -- then melts for ever.
There is more poetry in these two lines by Burns than can be dreamed
of by those with only an academic interest in literature. In the simple
dance of nature Burns can lucidly express the infinite and the finite,
the transient and the eternal, and see divine immortality in a
perishable moment in winter.
Time is the mysterious secret at the heart of Burns' poetry and his
time is now, which is why the world will celebrate his existence
throughout the coming year and thereafter.

TO mark the wonderful contribution made to the music of Scotland in a
lifetime of work, we feel that the portrait of Jimmy Shand, MBE, should
be painted ultimately to hang in the National Gallery of Scotland to
complement the picture of Niel Gow in the eighteenth century.
Jimmy has agreed to sit for George Bruce, president of the Royal
Society of Portrait Painters. While the councils of the region and
districts of Fife, together with several others, will join in the
commission, it is felt that many people, as well, may like to contribute
so that the gesture may truly be one of a myriad of grateful hearts.
It will be known as the Jimmy Shand (Snr) MBE Portrait Trust. An
account has been opened with the Dunfermline branch of the Bank of
Scotland, 52 East Port: Account No 00199738, Code No 83-33-00, and the
trustees will be the Earl of Elgin, Sir Kenneth Alexander, and Mr
William Moodie, Chief Constable of Fife.
Contributions may be made at branches of the Royal Bank of Scotland
and the Dunfermline Building Society or sent to me here at Broomhall.

BOCA RATON: A man previously charged with trespassing at tennis star
Steffi Graf's Florida home has again been ordered away from her housing
complex. A sheriff's report said Michael Salata complied with a request
to leave the Boca Raton Polo Club last Wednesday. Salata, 40, of West
Palm Beach, was given a warning but was not arrested.
The police report said Salata arrived at the complex by taxi and was
recognised by a security guard. He had been arrested and jailed on a
charge of trespassing at the complex in December 1992 and was warned
then not to return. Graf herself is playing at Wimbledon.

Roy Rogers surveys the coal industry 10 years on from the acrimony of
the miners' strike, and finds signs of conflict in England and
compromise in Scotland
A DECADE on from Britain's longest and most bitter industrial dispute,
the year-long miners' strike, and you could be forgiven for thinking
little had changed.
NUM president Arthur Scargill is poised to call widespread industrial
action throughout most of the English coalfield which, but for a legal
technicality, would by now have been hit by stoppages every Monday and
Friday.
Scargill warns that he will re-ballot the miners concerned who have
already voted by more than 80% for industrial action over a threatened
three-year pay freeze which follows a two-year wage standstill.
But the industry is remarkably different now, largely as a result of
the trouncing the miners were given in 1984-5. Britain's coal industry
has been run down to a fraction of its former self -- down from some
175,000 miners and 175 pits at the onset of the strike to around 12,000
miners at about two dozen collieries.
Moreover at the turn of the year those few pits remaining were
privatised with the bulk of the English coalfield going to RJB Mining.
RJB Mining now has 22 pits and 18 open-cast sites, with the sole
surviving Scottish deep mine complex at Longannet and nine opencast
sites being bought by Mining (Scotland).
The coal industry in South Wales now comprises just one pit, which was
bought over by its management, and nine open-cast sites bought by Celtic
Energy.
The other major player in the industry is Coal Investments which owns
five former British Coal pits, and also has a one-third stake in the
Mining (Scotland) consortium.
Scargill's row is with RJB Mining. Its chairman, Richard Budge, will
see his salary leap to an impressive #290,000, which could be doubled by
way of a performance-related bonus scheme, at the same time as he tries
to freeze miners' pay.
In Scotland, however, the situation could hardly be more different.
The Scottish TUC and Scottish NUM are firm backers of Mining (Scotland),
which trades under the name Scottish Coal. Together with its main
customer ScottishPower and the STUC, it jointly sponsored the recent
Scottish miners' gala.
Given this co-operative approach, which contrasts starkly with the
combative situation south of the Border, Scottish miners have no
problems in arranging negotiations, something which has been denied
their English counterparts at RJB. However, Richard Budge has now hinted
there might be scope for a pay review at the end of the year -- subject
to performance.
But Scottish NUM officials do not expect everything to be sweetness
and light, and the management can be expected to drive a hard bargain in
an attempt to reduce costs leading up to the renegotiation of a
long-term supply deal with ScottishPower.
Like Budge's big supply contracts with National Power and PowerGen,
Longannet's contract to fuel ScottishPower's adjacent power station
comes up for renewal in April 1998.
Longannet, which employs 900 people, is seen as overmanned compared
with pits down South, and moves to begin whittling those numbers down to
nearer 500 are expected to be insisted upon before management can
justify an ambitious #25m investment programme virtually to rebuild the
pit, and give it an additional 25-year working life.
Scottish miners' leaders will seek to limit job losses to the outside
contractors, now making up 250 of the Longannet workforce, and can be
expected to press for the retention of a core workforce of about 650.
Scottish Coal, which has moved its operations from Glasgow to former
British Coal premises at Corstorphine, Edinburgh, is seeking to
introduce a redundancy package. This, together with natural wastage,
should ensure compulsory redundancies can be avoided.
There could be argument on the detail of the redundancy package in as
much as management envisages setting a ceiling of about #20,000. This
looks poor when compared with the old British Coal maximum of #27,000,
which those who went to RJB Mining will enjoy until April 1998.
By then Budge has to renew his long-term supply contracts with the big
generators and the signs are that these will be hit further by the dash
for gas-powered generation and proposed conversion of several stations
from coal to imported Orimulsion. RJB could well face having to impose
its own pit-closure programme.
But in Scotland the future looks good with the upgrading of the
interconnector with England. Construction of a similar link to Northern
Ireland is expected to boost ''exports by wire'' and push Scotland's
coal burn to something like 6,750,000 tonnes a year, of which about a
third could come from Longannet.
To meet this challenge, Scottish Coal plans to sink two new drifts to
open up the Kincardine reserves to the west of the current workings, and
reduce considerably the haulage distances from coalface to the existing
surface facilities.
Once complete, this programme should leave Longannet a modern,
efficient colliery providing secure employment for Scottish miners for
at least 25 years. But for how many?
Given the good relations that exist in the Scottish coal industry, a
fair compromise deal should not be impossible.

Dick Louden reports on a staff and pupils sent packing for summer and
a new seat of learning in August
THE pupils of Kilbowie Primary School in Clydebank have been looking
out of their classroom windows, watching their new school take shape
across the playground. It will be theirs in August after the old
building, which is lined with asbestos and now classed as sub-standard,
has been demolished.
The new school will be a focal point for the Radnor Park area of
Clydebank, revealed by the 1992 Census to have the largest incidence of
single-parent families in Strathclyde. Of the present roll of 329 pupils
-- rising to 345 in August -- 270 are entitled to free school meals.
In 1993 the nearby Dalmuir Primary was closed and part of its
catchment area reallocated to Kilbowie. Many Dalmuir parents reacted by
sending their children elsewhere but the drift back has started and
Kilbowie's new Primary 1 intake of 45 includes nine from Dalmuir.
With a capacity of 396, the new Kilbowie offers an open-plan design,
with no internal partitions. Apart from 12 class bases, it contains a
quiet room, ''gallery'' (elevated computer workspace) and ''studio''
(audio-visual room).
Moving school, even across the playground, is a massive task. Kilbowie
pupils are excused attendance this Thursday and the first two days of
next session. Though the school will be stocked with new furniture and
equipment, the staff will take their curricular materials and equipment
with them and the packing process is well advanced.
Head teacher Sheila Campbell initiated staff preparation last autumn.
All teachers have been doing collaborative work and now they have been
arranged into pairs for next session and are happy with the pairings.
''We visited another open-plan school, Our Lady of the Missions in
Thornliebank, and all our staff did a day's teaching there to
familiarise them with the design.'' said Mrs Campbell.
Inevitably, there is some concern about noise. ''The problem may well
exist,'' said Mrs Campbell, ''but it will be more obvious and easier to
support. No teacher has applied for transfer. We are a family -- we have
built a climate of trust among staff and parents. We operate a programme
of parent helpers throughout the school.''
Parents have been kept informed of progress by newsletter and they,
former pupils and friends of Kilbowie are invited to pay a farewell
visit to the old school on Wednesday between 3 and 4pm. Responding to an
initiative by Kilbowie's pupil-teacher council, the main contractor,
John Dickie, will have engraved a time capsule, which is being made at
Clydebank College. The contractor will also donate a plaque to be placed
over the capsule when it is buried at the time of transfer.
Kilbowie's head janitor, John McArthur, a former Marine who took up
post only a year ago, is centrally involved in the packaging process and
in liaising with the site manager. ''All materials will be stored first
in Clydebank High School,'' said Mr McArthur. ''I shall be located there
after handing over the keys to this building. The manageability should
be easier. I always seem to be repairing things here.''
Others have mixed feelings. Senior teacher David Mitchison was a pupil
at Kilbowie. ''It has good points,'' he said. ''It offers a lot of
space, but also a feeling of togetherness. The staff have been
apprehensive about open-plan but they can't wait. They just want to get
on with it.''
Another teacher, Johanna McClelland, has taught in an open-plan
school, Knoxland Primary in Dumbarton. ''Staff have to reach
understandings,'' she said, ''and timetable open areas and facilities
like televisions. Children must be considerate to other classes, and
teachers must learn not to raise their voices unnecessarily.''
As usual, pupils had interesting perspectives. ''This building is old
and grey, the new one has a nicer colour,'' said Neil Chalmers in
Primary 4. There's loads of open space. If you make a noise, you'll get
sent to the head teacher and that's trouble.''
''We'll have new painted walls but not many of them,'' said Gillian
Dawson, also in Primary 4. ''I don't think the glass doors are a good
idea -- what if you fall?''
''I'm looking forward to being a monitor over there,'' said Andrew
McLafferty in Primary 6. ''It'll be easier because there are no
corridors. At first I didn't fancy it because I like the sheds here and
climbing up the poles inside them.''
Another Primary 6 pupil, Stephanie Barr, favoured the new school.
''There'll be less noise when you do projects. That will help pupils
doing silent reading. And the toilets here are awful small. Sometimes
spiders crawl up the wall.'' The reason for the open-plan design, she
reckoned, was that ''it costs money to build walls''.
* We'll take another look at Kilbowie in their new home in August.

BY THE middle of June most schools in the United States are shut for
the annual three-month summer break.
Summer for young Americans, the education authorities have decreed, is
a time for relaxing, socialising, and travel.
Many thousands of pupils will spend a large part of their vacation at
summer camp, where trained leaders and student helpers supervise a range
of outdoor activities including hiking, climbing, and canoeing. Other
teenagers will spend their long holidays with families in countries like
Japan and Australia as part of the overseas stay programmes organised by
many states.
Independent-minded students use the long break for trekking or touring
holidays worldwide. Indeed many students say they learn more about
subjects such as geography and foreign languages from their summer
travel expeditions than they do from lessons.
For some pupils, however, much of June, July, and August has to be
spent at summer school catching up on work they missed or had difficulty
with. The thought of attending summer school while their friends are
enjoying a long break is enough to encourage most pupils to work extra
hard during term-time.
Nonetheless, the shortness of America's school year has been blamed
for the poor performance of the country's students in international
tests.
The 180-day American school year is considerably shorter than the
220-day year in Japan and the East Asian countries which perform so well
in such comparisons.
But suggestions that academic attainment in the US could be raised by
lengthening the academic year and shortening the summer vacation bring a
hostile response from teachers, parents, and pupils. The long American
summer, it is argued, has too much social and cultural value to be
changed.
Many European schools have a similar preference for long summer
breaks. The average length of the school session in Europe is about 190
days, with summer vacations ranging from five to 10 weeks.
In mainland Europe, secondary school pupils often use long vacations
to enrol at overseas language schools, usually English ones, where they
can improve their foreign language skills and enjoy a holiday with other
teenagers.
Before stopping for the summer, pupils in most European countries can
take part in organised trips and study-tours. During June and July the
capital cities of Europe become crowded with inquisitive children
examining some of the Continent's most important landmarks.
In Russia, meanwhile, pupils are able to attend the summer camps built
in the country's forests, mountains, and coastal areas. The camps, which
were previously operated by the Young Pioneer youth groups, are an
important part of the infrastructure for Russia's education for leisure
programme.
Young Russians are taught how to make good use of their free time by
taking an interest in nature, outdoor activities, and sport. The camps
also enable children and disadvantaged families in Russia's big cities
to enjoy some time in the countryside.
In Japan the annual shugaku ryoko or school study tour does the same
thing. The four-day trips were introduced when parents had little time
to organise holidays, and school trips allowed young people to visit
some of the country's historical and cultural centres.
In spite of the new wealth of Japan, and the increasing tendency for
families to take holidays together, the study tours remain a popular
part of the school year.
The Japanese Government's recent decision to encourage workers to work
less and relax more has encouraged schools to organise additional trips
such as hiking and skiing.
With Japan's summer break falling during the school session, which
begins in April, teachers organise training sessions and competitions
for clubs and sporting groups.
However, many pupils are spending more of their five-week summer
breaks at Japan's network of crammers. Leading cramming schools now
organise summer study camps to give their students an edge in exams.
However, foreign trips remain a popular part of British schools'
efforts to offer adventurous and enjoyable educational activities. In a
recent survey of what people remembered about their schooldays, most
young adults said the highlights were school trips.

FINANCIAL markets were torpedoed by John Redwood's decision to
challenge John Major for the leadership of the Conservative Party. The
FTSE-100 share index had its worst day since February 24 last year when
it was preoccupied with the rise in US interest rates.
Sterling fell sharply against the dollar and the Deutschmark and
Government stock plummeted ahead of the gilts auction on Thursday
morning. There was even talk of the situation deteriorating to the point
where the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, would be forced
to raise interest rates.
Redwood is a much stronger challenger than had been envisaged when
Major embarked on his gamble last week. Moreover he seems to gain
stature when he is under the spotlight.
At the end of last week the City feared that Major would be wounded by
the contest, and carry on as a lame duck leader. Now Redwood is seen as
a big enough threat to force the contest into a second round, when
presumably Major would not be standing.
The uncertainty could drag on for weeks leaving financial markets
rudderless. There is also the danger that a new leader (from the right
or the left of the Conservative Party) might follow less responsible
fiscal and monetary policies.
If Major is re-elected it is even possible that he would put pressure
on Clarke to relax his grip on the economy. The Chancellor is already
adopting a more relaxed stance on inflation than the Governor of the
Bank of England, Eddie George.
Discounting all of this the reaction of the financial markets to the
deteriorating situation was quite savage. The FTSE-100 share index fell
by 70.2 points to 3309.2. Since Major's announcement on Thursday night
the market has lost the better part of 100 points in two sessions.
Trading volumes have, however, been thin. Just over 500 million shares
were traded yesterday against 800 or 900 million on a busy day.
Uncertainty invariably causes institutional investors to sit on their
cash piles. An England vicory against the West Indies at Lords was
doubtless a distraction.
Plunging gilts have dragged the equity market lower. Yesterday
Government stock fell by nearly one-and-a-half points after losses of
one-and-a-quarter on Friday. Interest rates fears were at their most
intense on this front.
Sterling, which had held up surprisingly well last week, was back in
the firing line. It fell by 1.91 cents to $1.5857 and 1.91 pfennigs to
DM2.2066. This translated to a loss of 0.7 in its trade weighted index
to 83.3, just 0.6 above its all-time low on May 9 after Clarke had
rebuffed the Governor of the Bank of England on interest rates.
Yesterday's movements extended the pound's losses to nearly 6% this
year and strengthened the Bank of England's hand in subsequent arguments
over rates.
The upset in financial markets coincided with balance of payments
figures showing that the current account had moved back into the red.
A drop in investment income ate into the traditional surplus on
invisible trade in services and investment income.
Britain produced a current account surplus of #446m in the third
quarter of last year. A surplus of #628m was provisionally estimated for
the fourth quarter, but this has now been revised to a deficit of #514m.
The provisional figures for the first quarter of this year show a
deficit of #397m. The improvement from the revised figure for the fourth
quarter resulted from a reduction in the deficit on visible trade from
#3000m to #1989m, offset by a deterioration in the invisible surplus
from #2486m to #1592m.
The current account deficit for last year has also been revised
upwards from #200m to #1684m, but it remained by far the best outcome
since 1986's #864m.
The worst years were 1988 to 1990, when the deficits were #16.5bn,
#22.4bn, and #19.3bn as the economy moved from boom to burst.
Hopes of a current account surplus this year (the last was #2238m in
1985) must now take a back seat. Invisibles are notoriously erratic and
subject to substantial revision. Last year the surplus was a record
#8910m despite the latest downward revision.
Investment income was in surplus to the tune of #10.5bn, but this was
exceptional and, therefore, unsustainable. In the latest quarter
investment income's contribution was down to #1372m after four quarters
in which it ranged #2455m to #2995m.
Yesterday's figures caught the City off-guard. The pundits had been
looking for a current account surplus of around #600m on the back of a
visible deficit just below #2000m.
But in the final analysis 1995 is on course to produce a current
account deficit of around #2000m, which would make it one of the better
years for British trade.
A separate set of figures confirmed that gross domestic product grew
by 0.7% in the first three months of this year, but because of revisions
to earlier quarters the economy grew by 3.8% against the same three
months a year ago. The previous estimate had been 3.7%.
There was a fairly even division between services, up 0.8% on the
quarter, and industrial production, up 0.7%. But there was concern that
an original estimate of a 1.8% rise in investment was revised to a fall
of 0.2%. After tax income grew by an unexpectedly strong 1.9%, but
consumers kept their hands in their pockets. So the savings ratio jumped
from 8.8%, revised down from 10.3%, to 10.6%.

THE greatest difficulty in responding to Geoffrey Jarvis's letter on
the development of the former Garden Festival site in Glasgow is
choosing which of his many misleading and inaccurate statements to deal
with first (June 22).
Mr Jarvis has gone out of his way to describe Pacific Quay as a
''car-park and business park''; in fact, he knows that over half of the
site is allocated to leisure and visitor attractions in our proposals.
Nor does he choose to mention that his own proposals, recently rejected
by the Millennium Commission, comprise more parking and more office
space than the Pacific Quay proposals.
However unintentionally, Mr Jarvis's comments do support the case for
quality office development at Pacific Quay. He states with some accuracy
that Locate in Scotland has not lately attracted large office users in
Glasgow.
That is because there is a desperate shortage of business-park space
close to the centre of Glasgow. The evidence is overwhelming whether you
read market reports or rely on the anecdotal experience of developers,
agents, and potential occupiers.
Rather than suck office users out of the city centre, Pacific Quay
will help to keep them there rather than force expanding companies out
of Glasgow altogether because there is no suitable accommodation in the
city centre.
Mr Jarvis should be pleased that the GDA has commissioned a
feasibility study on the future of privately owned dry docks in Govan.
Instead, he seeks to pre-empt the outcome of this study by presenting
personal opinion as fact.
He expresses the opinion that the Science Centre and Millennium Tower
are not the major tourist attractions that Glasgow requires.
Fortunately, his opinion does not concur with the vast raft of
supporters for a National Science Centre, not to mention the Millennium
Commission, which last week selected the GDA proposal as Category A, one
of only 14 such projects across Scotland.
Mr Jarvis has consistently criticised the aesthetic qualities of
Pacific Quay despite the fact that only one building, the Science
Centre, has progressed to the design stage. Does he know something we
don't or is he out of step on this issue as well as all the others?
All of this sniping and bickering about Pacific Quay may provide an
amusing sideshow and good copy for the media. However, it does nothing
to progress the development of this important site which has lain vacant
for seven years.
The options have been explored at length. Divisions have been made
based on hard evidence and proven know-how. The time for talking is
over. Let's get to work and deliver a development Glasgow can be proud
of.

John Mitchell congratulates those teachers who have secured an early
release -- and gives hope for those who haven't
THERE'S a strange new breed of teacher in staffrooms across the land
these days. Maybe you've seen some of them: fresh-faced, dewy-eyed,
eager with anticipation?
No: I'm not talking about trainee teachers, or even probationary
teachers in the first flush of employment. I'm talking about successful
early-retirement candidates, those just-past-middle-agers all set for an
early release from the chains of pedagogy.
For them, this week will mark not just the end of term, but also the
getaway-day of all time as they reach out -- for an enhanced early
pension with one hand, and a holiday brochure for the other. At the
grand old age of 55, and even as young as 50, teachers and lecturers
across Scotland are declaring that enough stress is enough stress. As an
ex-teacher whose job also took him into schools, I've met many of them
on an increasingly frequent basis in recent months. And I'm sad.
Sad to see teachers whose sense of vocation has been snuffed out by
mountainous volumes of paperwork; teachers whose love of the job has
been replaced by endless digital acrobatics with a pocket calculator to
discover whether they really can manage on what is on offer plus a lump
sum. Usually the chance to maintain a living standard at anything close
to subsistence level will be grasped with both hands.
Such thoughts came to mind as I met one of my former college lecturers
the other day. Having gone the way of many 55-year-olds and over, one of
his first retirement acts had been to take a holiday to Malta. The
outgoing aircraft, Brian reported, was packed with fellow ex-teachers
and lecturers, all agape with wonder at their luck, though also replete
with that professional sense of guilt -- unique to teachers? -- which
teachers will experience if they feel they're not doing something
useful. Could it really be happening? Would someone from the education
offices turn up at Luqa airport and tell them to report back to school,
post-haste?
But by the time the happy campers were on their way back home, such
angst-ridden thoughts had been banished. Instead, there was only one
topic of conversation: where do we go for a holiday next time? Hell's
teeth: who would begrudge them? It's just that Brian and I couldn't help
wondering how long it would last -- and who was paying for it? ''My big
worry is what happens to you lot,'' he admitted bashfully to me.
''Who'll pay for your generation to retire early?''
Well I've left teaching, of course, and in my line of work early
retirement is less frequent than under the apparently generous terms
offered to regional council employees (the commercial world has a
different word for it: redundancy), but I still felt he had a point.
So if you're about to retire early, and the jokes about Saga holidays
are flying thick and fast across the staffroom, spare a thought for
those you leave behind. Try telling them to keep their love of the job,
in case the generous terms don't go on for ever. And tell them this
story, culled from my days of wandering around schools.
I met a Perthshire primary head teacher due for retirement four weeks
after my visit. ''Ah well,'' I ventured, realising that an order for the
books I was peddling was unlikely but deciding to pass the time-of-day
with an inconsequential piece of chit-chat: ''You'll be looking forward
to getting out of it all, I suppose.''
He sighed, shook his head, and (I swear) a tear filled his eye.
''It'll be the worst day of my life.'' Gesturing across an assembly hall
filling with children he said: ''I know them all by name, and they're my
own wee bairns. I'll miss them something awful . . .''
Couthy, maybe, but it reminded me why most teachers enter the
profession. It's to do with working with young people, with a chance to
influence young minds for the better, and to enthuse those minds with a
love of learning, and the love of serving others which can inflame us
all from time to time.
And it's maybe worth remembering that, as you're casting envious eyes
over the retirement presentations, when it's going well, and you've
actually got time to teach, then teaching can still be the best job in
the world.

Concern is growing about the amount of time and resources being
swallowed up by quality control, as Barclay McBain finds out
AT a recent lunch to recognise universities which had received the
excellent rating for the way they taught the first 10 subject areas to
come under scrutiny, Professor Stewart Sutherland, Principal of
Edinburgh University, was asked if the awards were worth the candle.
Quality is as rigorously pursued in higher education as it is
elsewhere, but there is growing concern in the sector about the amount
of time and effort the many forms of assessment are taking up.
Yes, said Professor Sutherland, the teaching awards were worth the
candle but, echoing concerns about the system becoming overburdened, he
said ways had to be found to slim down the bureaucracy involved.
Institutions argue for more resources from the public purse and, said
the Principal, such awards demonstrated to the Government and the
Treasury that universities spent public money well.
But they diverted his colleagues from the jobs they should be doing,
teaching and research.
So are we at the stage where quality controls the sector? Not quite,
but aside from cyclical assessments of the way they teach subjects
(which carry funding rewards and potential penalties) the research
activities of institutions are also assessed (and rewarded depending on
their ratings) every five years.
And, leaving aside their internal processes for monitoring quality,
they go through a rigorous quality audit roughly every six years.
These audits, which do not carry funding rewards or penalties, are the
responsibility of the Higher Education Quality Council, a body owned
collectively by HE institutions.
But again, there are concerns about the implications of audits. One HE
source said: ''It involves institutions in an enormous amount of effort
and resources to prepare for audits, and the best people are often taken
out to act as auditors. It's a penalty on the whole system.''
Of course they are delighted when they come out well from such
assessments. As far as the quality audit of an institution is concerned,
a four-strong team drawn from other establishments will spend about six
weeks scrutinising documentation about the way it assures quality and
standards.
The auditors will also spend three days at the institution speaking to
staff and students about their areas of concern which include:
* The design, monitoring, and review of courses and study programmes.
* The teaching and learning environment.
* Procedures for assessing students and classifying degrees.
* Academic standards.
The whole exercise is concerned with the way institutions discharge
their responsibility for the quality and standards of their programmes
and awards.
One of our newest universities, Paisley, this month received what it
described as a glowing report from a recent HEQC quality audit. The
audit team which assessed the university found that the quality issue
pervaded the institution.
The university Principal, Professor Richard Shaw, said: ''We have been
held up by our peers as an institution with a focus on vocational
education, an emphasis on teaching, strong links with the local
community, and a wide concern with standards and quality. No university
could, I believe, ask for more.''
In the circumstances Paisley was quite right to blow its own trumpet.
It knew it was not running a risk in doing so, because the accuracy and
fairness of publicity material is one of the nine main concerns of audit
teams.
Paisley would also say the exercise was worth the candle, but it also
has reservations, as academic registrar David Rigg pointed out.
''Both quality audit and quality teaching assessment are useful in
demonstrating that universities give good value to students and society,
although their main importance is in quality improvement.
''There is scope for the two processes to learn from one another, to
minimise their overlap, and optimise the feedback they offer
institutions. If they could be brought together into a single quality
assurance framework it would be a major step forward.''

<HEADLINE>John Sutcliffe is third bidder for Dundee port</HEADLINE>

JOHN Sutcliffe &amp; Son, an English company that wants to buy a string of
ports along the east coast of Britain, has emerged as a third bidder for
Dundee.
Scottish rivals Forth Ports and Clydeport also want to purchase the
small but profitable trust port from the government.
The fact that there are three serious contenders for Dundee should now
push bids towards the upper end of the expected #10m to #20m price
range.
''Basically we already own and operate the port of Boston in
Lincolnshire and Dundee is about the same size,'' said James Sutcliffe,
chairman of John Sutcliffe &amp; Son, explaining the bid.
But the ambitions of his family-owned shipping company based in
Grimsby go much further.
Mr Sutcliffe wants to buy a whole chain of ports stretching from
Scotland to the English channel.
He has been lobbying Transport Secretary Brian MaWhinney to privatise
the English trust ports of Newcastle, Ipswich and Dover and wants to bid
for all three when they come to market, possibly this autumn.
''What we are looking to do is to establish a new network of ports
along the east coast,'' Mr Sutcliffe told the Herald.
John Sutcliffe &amp; Son's bid for Dundee was a well-kept secret until the
weekend when Mr Sutcliffe revealed the move.
Forth Ports and Clydeport confirmed earlier this month that they want
to buy Dundee. Clydeport has teamed up with Dundee's port management in
a company called Caledonian Ports.
But when the deadline for submitting pre-qualifying bids passed on
June 13 there was no public indication that any other bidder had come
forward.
The contestants will learn tomorrow whether they have been approved as
preferred bidders.
Those who are cleared must submit final proposals by July 28.
''There are not many trust ports left and the very fact that three
people have put up their hands for this one does increase competition
and put up the price,'' one analyst at a Scottish brokerage said.
He forecast that bids would come in between #15m and #20m, but
estimated the commercial value of Dundee port at only #12m.
''Trust ports are few and far between so there is something of a
scarcity premium to be paid,'' he added.
Dundee port handles about one million tonnes of cargo a year and made
a profit of #825,000 on turnover of #5m in 1993, the last year for which
figures have been published.
John Sutcliffe &amp; Son has arranged finance through a merchant bank to
bid for the port, but Mr Sutcliffe said he would float shares in Boston
to finance any further acquisitions.
The group has been a shipping agent and charterer on the east coast of
England for 130 years.
It bought the port of Boston for #5m at privatisation in 1990 with the
help of venture capital firms 3i and Charterhouse, which still own 60%
of the equity.
Boston has boosted its cargo throughput by a third to 1.3 million
tonnes since then and Mr Sutcliffe expects the port to make a pre-tax
profit of about #500,000 before interest this year on turnover of #3.5m.

A MEDIEVAL town crier heralded a venture into cyberspace yesterday
when the first major Scottish magazine was launched on to the Internet.
Software Echo, Scotland's leading software publication, officially
went on-line in Glasgow, when the managing director of Scottish
Enterprise Operations, Dr Robert Crawford, clicked a simple computer
command.
As its first pages illuminated a giant computer screen, the town crier
proclaimed: ''On this day being the 26th of June 1995, the Software Echo
is available to all good people on the World Wide Web. All surfers,
browsers and readers are invited to get wired right in.''
The launch follows the issuing of The Herald on to the Internet last
month, the first Scottish quality newspaper to appear in electronic
format.
The magazine will appear free in abridged form as Software HotEcho to
anyone whose computer is linked to the World Wide Web, the global
information network which serves between 20 and 30 million people.
Robin Mair, the editor of Software Echo, said the launch offered
immense potential to expand the magazine's readership.
The transfer of the material from magazine format to electronic pages
was carried out by Scottish Enterprise and Caledonian Information &amp;
Media Services.
Dr Crawford said the venture would show Scottish companies the huge
instant audience for information and advertisments transmitted via the
Internet. He added: ''This is the most important single area Scottish
Enterprise is currently engaged with.
''We must seize on the opportunity or our own competitors will be
eating our lunch in our marketplace. Scottish companies who think they
can ignore the Internet process are kidding themselves.''
John McCrossan, Scottish Enterprise's head of software, said the high
standard of Scotland's cable and telecommunications networks gave it a
head start in linking up to the Internet on European competitors.
Several Scottish companies already transmit on the World Wide Web,
including Borders Enterprise (Tweednet) and the manufacturer, Weir
Paper.
The Software Echo can be accessed on the World Wide Web on

EASTERN Group, England's biggest regional electricity company (REC),
yesterday reported a 15% increase in full-year profits from #176.8m to
#203.5m.
The company, which wants to remain in the upper quartile in dividend
growth, raised its total dividend by 23% to #28.3m after a final payment
of 20.05p.
The results included a #50m charge to cover the sale of its electrical
retail stake. Its retailing interests showed a net operating loss of
#2.5m reflecting poor results from the Powerhouse joint venture with
Midlands and Southern Electricity. The business is now up for sale, with
ScottishPower thought to be interested.
Profits were at the top end of City expectations helped by a good
performance in the supply and generation businesses. The mild winter
meant that the units distributed were just 0.3% higher than in 1993-94.
The company is keen to further expand its gas interests as the UK
market opens up next year. It is already the biggest REC in gas and the
seventh-largest gas firm in the UK and may buy some excess capacity from
National Power and PowerGen. It said its prices are as much as 12% less
than those of British Gas. Last year, its gas sales rose by 2[1/2] times
and profits were five times bigger than in 1993-94 at #2.8m.
Chief executive John Devaney defended the group's decision not to
follow rival Seeboard's lead and announce a savings package for
shareholders and customers. However, the company is seeking shareholder
approval to buy back 14.9% of its share capital at its annual general
meeting in August. The company repurchased 3% of its shares last year.
Eastern is not planning to ask sharheolders to lift a protective 15%
limit on single stakes in the company, imposed at privatisation in 1990.
Next month, OFFER, the industry regulator, is due to make known its
view on price controls. Chairman James Smith said that any further price
cuts by the industry regulator would be both ''inequitable and
unwarranted''.
Eastern has been one of the companies urging Professor Littlechild to
take a harsher line with companies such as Swalec and South Western
Electricity whose prices are relatively high. Eastern, which has frozen
domestic unit prices for the third year and recently announced a 22% cut
in domestic standing charges, said it has the lowest dustribution unit
prices and net operating costs per customer in the country.
The company's aggressive stance on the regulatory review is thought to
make it the most likely to opt for a Monopolies and Mergers Commission
referral. For this reason the shares are not recommended by the utility
analysts at brokers Smith New Court.
The regional electricity companies are some of the most
politically-sensitive stocks and as such their shares are likely to
remain out of favour as long as the uncertainty persists over John
Major's premiership. In addition there is some caution ahead of the
regulatory review.
Yesterday, Eastern shares were marked down 27p to 644p where they
yield  5.5%.

A WIRE-COPY profile of John Redwood circulating yesterday morning
likened the ex-Welsh Secretary to a halibut on a fishmonger's slab, a
creature from the frozen deep. It was, I suppose, an attempt to wring
some metaphorical changes on all those weekend references to Redwood the
Vulcan, the other worldly, extra-terrestrial, temporarily disembarked to
sort out earthlings in the Welsh valleys.
On the evidence of the Commons media scrum to confirm his bid for the
Tory party leadership, where Redwood, belying that cold-fish tag,
brought poise, humour, and a demonstrably nimble mind to a sustained
barrage of tough questions, John Major now faces the father and mother
of all battles to keep his job. Although he protests he wants a ''debate
among friends'' Redwood has the determined sense of purpose to do the
Prime Minister serious, potentially fatal, damage. From where I sit,
John Major looks finished.
After Redwood's adrenalin-fired castigating of the way the Prime
Minister chose to engineer an early contest for the leadership without
consulting his Cabinet, after his prediction that he, Redwood, would win
that contest in the first ballot, the follow-up statement read by Lord
Cranbourne from the steps of the Major campaign bunker in Cowley Street
carried all the conviction of the newly condemned, dreaming of
deliverance. The echoes of Peter Morrison, in Paris, defending La
Thatcher after her first-round rebuff are almost tangible.
The halibut was suddenly showing all the surface animation of a
porpoise. The Vulcan could, and did, laugh and joke at his own expense.
Redwood seemed almost serene. All those who have whispered for months
about how hopeless Major is as leader had been bested. Redwood alone has
resigned his first Cabinet post to do something about it. Michael
Portillo has an entire Panorama profile devoted to him, while swearing
undying loyalty to the incumbent. This ''bastard'' has put up. This
''bastard'' has guts.
Four days earlier, conventional wisdom had it that John Major had
pulled off the masterstroke by resigning, triggering a leadership
election and catching any would-be pretenders off-guard. But as soon as
the Prime Minister opened his mouth in the Downing Street rose garden
last Thursday, I was convinced he had committed a serious tactical
blunder.
As I wrote at the time, two issues currently animate his party at
Westminster. One is Europe. The other -- a very personal issue for every
Tory MP with a majority under 10,000 -- is getting re-elected sometime
within the next two years.
On both issues the key question is whether those in the firing line
believe, in their heart of hearts, John Major can deliver. Can he hold a
policy line on Europe which both meets some of the main concerns of the
Eurosceptics while reaffirming that Britain still wants to play a full
part in the evolving European Union? And can he, whether by soapbox or
soundbite, claw back Labour's 40 point plus lead in the polls, and
somehow engineer a fifth consecutive Tory victory?
On Europe, the time for holding any sort of policy consensus within
the Tory party, embracing every view from Kenneth Clarke to Bill Cash,
may actually have passed. The sceptical tendency may still be a
numerical minority among Tory MPs. But, with the departure of a
Europhile Foreign Secretary from Westminster and the search for a policy
edge on New Labour growing ever more frantic, Europe looks increasingly
like the most promising battleground.
The Prime Minister's weekend outburst about Eurocrap was charged with
tense feeling. But, given that the policy to date is his, any dramatic
changes in his own stance over the next few days would smack of
desperation and deepen Major's plight. Redwood has yet to spell out his
detailed views on Europe, but we already know enough about them to be
sure they will be distinctively more sceptical than the Prime
Minister's.
Redwood says he is not contemplating withdrawal from the EU, but would
not abolish the pound while he is in Downing Street. He would certainly
call a halt to ceding any new powers to Brussels and would look at what
powers could be clawed back. In other words, Redwood's is the language
of Marlow and Budgen, Taylor and Gorman. It is not the language of Heath
and Hurd, Clarke and Heseltine.
Asked what his underlying approach to policy is, Redwood says ''common
sense''. He might equally have said a sense that a more stridently
Eurosceptical tone will play well with the common people who will, of
course, decide the outcome of the next election. Although the Major camp
was yesterday trying to brand them the asylum tendency, it has always
been a part of the creed of the Eurosceptics now gathered around
Redwood, that the policy they propose on Europe will play better in the
country than Major's middle way.
I do not know whether John Redwood can actually defeat John Major in
the first ballot. Much will depend on his policy message, and how he
delivers it, in the days ahead. But I'm certain that he will take enough
votes to inflict a deep and grievous wound. I doubt the Prime Minister
can recover from that. I doubt he will have the stomach for a second
round.
What will happen then will be a battle, not just of Cabinet
heavyweights -- with Redwood carrying a weight advantage for having had
the guts to put up in the first place -- but also for the soul of the
Tory party. It may be -- just as Michael Heseltine's resignation and
subsequent challenge to Thatcher opened the door for John Major -- that
Redwood's challenge now, by some delicious symmetry, will give Heseltine
one more chance of the crown.
But the President of the Board of Trade's views on Europe are
increasingly in danger of being eclipsed within his own party. The soul
of the Tory party may be slipping from his grasp. Indeed, if the asylum
tendency wins the day, the Europhile and Eurosceptical wings of the Tory
Party may have to divide and go their separate ways.

GLASGOW International Folk Festival's Saturday concerts juxtaposed one
of the folk scene's older hands with a more recent arrival.
From his days with early 1970s folk/rockers Contraband through the
more sedate Ossian and his larger-scale pieces such as 1985's Wellpark
Suite, William Jackson has developed into a composer who, as the string
settings on his latest album, Inchcolm, prove, is ready to take on a
major work. What he achieved here with a fiddle, cello, guitar, and
small pipes ensemble assembled an hour beforehand, represented a minor
miracle.
Encompassing his own relaxed solo harp tunes, some beguiling Gaelic
singing from Mairi MacInnes and Jackson's gorgeous, calming Columcille
in frugal string section form, this was a thoroughly engaging
performance. And while much of Jackson's music today points to a
Celtic-accented extension of the baroque and classical traditions, he
can still supervise a set of reels. The finale, with Fred Morrison's
audacious piping, may well be as exciting a tune as is heard all week.
Although the constituent parts have been around a bit longer,
Aberdeen's Old Blind Dogs are definitively a folk item of the 1990s,
during which time much roadwork has produced a full, more solid group
sound than of yore. Because of the nature of their roles, fiddler Jonny
Hardie and singer/guitarist Ian Benzie still tend to dominate. Hardie
can be both seductive on slower tunes and genuinely exciting in a higher
gear, and Benzie's singing, gruffly honest at all times, was memorably
resonant in describing a young man's prognosis following an ill-advised
liaison.

Scottish audiences, explains Vin Garbutt, leave his gigs thinking,
''aye, it'll be another four years before I try that again''. While the
self-deprecation is admirable -- and typical -- it remains curious that
the Cleveland-based Garbutt has never really caught on up here.
True, his singing is very English, very stylised, as he admits
himself, and Scots don't really go for that. But it's also passionate.
And honest. He means it, which is the acid test for any singer.
In the past Garbutt's addressing of issues could border on soap-box
preaching. Here, his messages were eloquent, reasoned, and came across
in the end as common sense. Mining. Cardboard City. Oppression. The
Irish Peace Process. He covered all those topics without ever forgetting
that his primary mission was to entertain.
Entertain? The man's a hoot. With a love of word play not dissimilar
to Chick Murray's, Garbutt's verbal flights of fancy can leave you
feeling as if you're standing in a strange station not knowing which bus
to catch.
No opportunity for a routine is missed. His guitar-tuning exploits are
a kind of performance art in themselves. Breaking a string offers him a
chance to excel on penny whistle, with a mind-boggling series of key
changes, or recite and then sing a First World War poem which finishes
with a clever variation on the ''is this microphone working?'' gag.
His reasons for singing the Rose of Tralee were so convoluted that
I've forgotten them now.
But he sang it, as he did everything else, in a fashion that makes a
four-year wait for another helping more than a little excessive.

WHEN Franco Zeffirelli staged La Boheme at the New York Metropolitan,
he demanded 300 choristers for the Cafe Momus scene. Such elaboration
was clearly beyond the scope of Travelling Opera, which brought a
different sort of philosophy, and a different sort of budget, to its
solitary Edinburgh appearance on Sunday.
Without a chorus at all, and with only 16 players in the pit, this was
a Boheme presented with Thatcherist rigour, but it reduces Puccini to a
good deal less than his essentials. In a village hall, some of the
deficiencies might have passed unnoticed. On the biggest stage in
Britain, they were ruthlessly exposed.
Not only did the Cafe Momus scene prove false to the composer's
intentions, it made nonsense of his carefully calculated theatrical
effects.
With good voices or with telling portrayals, something might have been
made of the rest of the work. But these were singers -- Michael
Preston-Roberts as a strained Rodolfo, Helen Gasztowt-Adams as a
dim-toned Mimi -- who had insufficient reserves of power, and were
crippled by a clumsy English translation. Whatever benefit was meant to
derive from updating the story to the 1930s remained obscure.
Though Puccini's imperishable opera emerged unscathed, the crudely
pared-down orchestration did him no favours and Peter Knapp's poorly
executed production seemed cheap in every sense.
If the scene changes, at least, were swiftly accomplished, that was
because there was almost no scenery to change. Was this really what
Edinburgh's Festival Theatre was designed for? The large audience,
astoundingly, seemed satisfied.

Mary Brennan
describes the triumphant relaunch of Ballet Rambert and looks at what
the future holds
CHRISTOPHER BRUCE admits -- with engaging candour -- that running
Rambert Dance Company has already reduced him to tears.
Earlier this year, the company -- performing his new piece, Meeting
Point -- took audiences by storm in San Francisco. The occasion was
UNited We Dance, an international festival celebrating 50 years of the
United Nations. Rambert had been given the honour -- and the onus -- of
representing Britain at this prestigious event. It was a major challenge
and one the dancers took brilliantly in their stride. The response was
genuine and rapturous.
Bruce, naturally, was relieved and very proud. But what really brought
him to tears was the utter dedication, the loyalty, and the unflinching
effort put in by the dancers. This was, remember, a company that had
been performing publicly for just six months. In many ways it was still
a young company but they had already melded into a formidable team. ''I
was just so moved when I saw them on stage,'' says Bruce. ''One boy, he
had a finger broken in three places, and he still went on. And they
danced so well. So wonderfully well. They really stood out. And I
thought -- 'We've done it! We've survived, and we've proved ourselves at
home and abroad. And so much faster than I hoped.' And yes, I did cry a
bit.''
It's clear from the way he speaks of Rambert that Bruce has poured all
his energies into rebuilding the company's profile and fortune --
possibly at the expense of his own creative output, though he still
continues to make work when he can. ''Well yes, I do find it very hard
to make my own work and run the company. Because that's a job in itself
really. And it's so much more complicated than you can ever conceive.
But the real problem is limited finance. Not enough money to make the
vision work as one would like. And cutting back on the company is only a
short-term expedient, it will only create other headaches. It's as if
you are left trying to make dance, make things work, with one leg tied
up behind you.''
If these glitches reduced him to tears, he certainly doesn't let on.
Instead he reiterates, with unforced enthusiasm, the way he hopes the
company will evolve. That vision he refers to is of Rambert flourishing
as a provider of popular, good-quality contemporary dance that really
reaches audiences. Big audiences to boot.
At the same time, he carries a palpable concern for the company's
heritage and for the dance scene of the future. ''The need is to
consolidate and develop. Tradition is important, even if it's as
something to bounce against. But I am aware of the Rambert legacy, the
repertoire. What you might call its DNA. And I intend to foster that and
look within the company for future directors who will also be a part of
that and know how to nurture it.''
In the meantime he is nurturing audiences by sending out two touring
programmes full of established favourites and intriguing new work --
strong entertainment, spiked with challenge. Alongside Kylian's
mordantly witty Petite Mort -- a tremendous success on the last tour --
and Rooster, Bruce's own strutting stuff (to Rolling Stones music),
there are works by rising new young choreographers like Mark Baldwin,
Per Johnsson, and Matthew Hawkins.
Hawkins is, undoubtedly, one of the liveliest and most
thought-provoking dance makers of his generation. His own background
encompasses classical ballet training, Cunningham technique, contact
improvisation, and performing with Rose English -- an entire education
in itself. He has, therefore, an acute awareness of how styles have
continually crossed-over, produced hybrids, and of how theatre and
performance have also had an influence on contemporary dance.
Transition, is, it emerges, an underlying theme in the work he has just
made with Rambert -- it receives its world premier in Edinburgh tomorrow
night.
Enigmatically called Dancing Attendance on the Cultural Chasm, and set
to music by Rameau, the piece is his response to the times that Rambert
are going through. ''Basically I walked into the building with my
antennae out. I wanted to see what could be usefully provoked. Because
this is a company in a point of transition and I was interested -- well,
curious -- to discover what might be precious in its own heritage.''
Underpinning these questions was Hawkins' cogent understanding of
transition. ''Dance survives by what people perceive at the time. And
not all dance movements survive to become traditions!'' He talks rapidly
and eloquently about the fragile nature of traditions, since they
depend, it seems, on a random process of selectivity -- and on our
tendency to construct reasons and relevances, histories, and heritage
with hindsight. He wanted, wherever possible, to be alive to those
elements of Rambert that are its traditions past and future. ''There
was, I must say, a real temptation to go in with an entire package. My
own dance vocabulary -- which is certainly different from theirs -- and
my own agenda. But that didn't seem appropriate. So instead, I've tried
to draw on their history, on the dancers' own sources, for what is
something that expresses a time of change.'' One thing that hasn't
changed, however, is the impressive quality of technical ability within
the company as a whole.
Judge for yourself whether the new works will move you to tears when
the company presents two different programmes at the Edinburgh Festival
Theatre this week.
* Rambert Dance Company Programme One, Wednesday/Thursday and
Programme Two Friday/Saturday all at 7.30pm.

THE programme note for this latest instalment in the Colin McIntyre
weekly rep puts forward some reasons for the abiding popularity of the
detective thriller. It mentions Id impulses, Holy Grails, Oedipus myths,
and crossword puzzles. All possible, of course, but could I have been
the only wag to turn up hoping to be amused by the death throes of an
old-time theatrical institution?
Brian Clemens's play was written in the 1970s though, set at the turn
of the century, it could easily be from any era that regarded chaise
longues and french windows as integral to the theatrical experience.
It's about a middle-aged couple who rediscover their daughter -- or is
she? -- who had disappeared three years earlier -- or did she? -- and
now suffers memory loss.
They employ a suspicious-acting butler -- or is he? -- and bump off a
man who says he's their daughter's husband -- or was he? Every scene
finishes with the kind of cliffhanger that demands the audience make a
humming noise that shows they're intrigued or just that they're still
awake. Or perhaps they were groaning.
I suppose, with only one week to rehearse, director Richard Stockwell
should be congratulated for getting the thing on at all, and the actors
commended for only occasionally stepping on each other's clothes and
bumping into the furniture, and applauded for having even a tentative
grasp on the lines.
At least come the closing line -- some pat phrase about the daughter's
amnesia being a blessing after all -- I could feel the whole thing
passing as effortlessly from my own memory as it had entered.

Sara Villiers
reports on a project aimed at improving the quality of theatre
available to young people
AS a taster it made a few of us gulp. With surprise. With shock. With
emotion. The performed reading of Mirad, A Boy From Bosnia, Part One by
the Oxford Stage Company at the McRobert Arts Centre in Stirling was a
preview for the company's autumn season, Making the Future. Its stark
portrayal of the conflict from a child's viewpoint succeeded in exciting
considerable interest in the project from the teachers and theatre
education officers present.
The project, facilitated by a #60,000 grant from the Vivien Duffield
Theatre Award, aims to improve the quality of theatre available to young
people and will involve intensive residencies at theatres around the
country with Oxford Stage Company presenting four new European plays,
Mirad, Parts One and Two, Hitler's Childhood and Grace. They arrive at
the McRobert, where they have built up a good relationship over the past
few years with visiting Shakespeare productions, and which is
increasingly establishing itself as a premiere venue for children's
theatre in Scotland in November, with a week's residency from the 13th
to 18th.
The project title refers not only to the progressive plays but also to
Oxford Stage Company's own far-sighted agenda. ''We've been working with
young people increasingly,'' says director Karl Jones. ''The company has
a loyal audience who have been following our work for years, who are now
in their fifties. We can't afford to lose them but if we want an
audience in the future we have to start building it now. As a society we
seem to be very good at talking to kids as a market, selling them
everything from computers to trainers, and we have to evolve a dialogue
with them which gets them interested in the theatre.''
Making The Future showcases challenging works with a common theme of
childhood, which represent the best of the innovative drama which has
developed in Northern Europe as a consequence of enlightened and, more
significantly, state-funded education policies, which enables companies
to tour new work around schools.
However, rather than taking theatre into schools, Oxford Stage, a
medium-scale company used to playing houses of 400 to 500, want to bring
schools to the theatre, hoping to develop the established British
tradition of school children visiting performances of the classics and
pantomimes at Christmas by introducing them to new writing aimed
directly at them.
''Most of the work from Europe seems to avoid naturalism and to find
fresh means of expression. The many productions that I have seen are
contemporary, audacious, and thought-provoking in content,'' says Jon
Retallack, artistic director of the company. ''The best work is of
universal interest to adult and teenager alike.''
Indeed, Oxford Stage's performance of Mirad (already a celebrated text
in Northern Europe) last year, with Jeremy Irons and Sinead Cusak
playing Uncle Dguka and Aunt Fazila, resulted in the play being
published by the Longman literature series and becoming a GSCE text.
If Mirad is anything to go by the plays Retallack has chosen are
powerful stuff. The tale of the 13-year-old's experiences of the war and
subsequent evacuation to Holland is described in this two hander by his
aunt and uncle, who unravel their own horrific experiences as well as
alternately voicing Mirad's diary entries. It is a harrowing account,
simply and effectively dramatised with the two actors facing the
audience to deliver their story in a confrontational fashion which is
intensely involving.
The project is also complemented by an extensive teaching pack
sponsored by educational publishers Longmans, which not only provides
background and samples of the plays but also offers examples of
discussion topics.
''The project doesn't provide answers,'' says Jones. ''It just asks
better questions.''

A GROUP of independent management consultants is bringing success to
businesses on both sides of the border with a radical approach involving
communication, training, and team effort.
Transition Partnerships is trying to overcome the cynical excesses of
the last decade; a culture which has led too often to cold wars between
management and employees fought on a no man's land of fear and
insecurity.
More particularly, its eight consultants offer a mixture of seminars,
workshops, and one-to-one discussions. These are designed to help
companies deal with a range of matters such as improving procedures,
introducing new technology, complexities of takeovers and mergers; the
wisdom of staff training and confidence building.
They use buzzwords like ''change management'', ''mentoring'',
''coaching'' and ''performance appraisal'' but scrutiny shows us that
this is more than mere jargon. What they quite refreshingly mean is that
they try to get people to talk to each other, grasp the nettle of
change, get rid of old ideas, accept new methods and put them into
practice.
All of which is a tall order but they say it can be done if people
work together. They insist that the way to do it is by being ''tough
with issues, gentle with people''.
The consultants hail from diverse backgrounds and each offers
specialist expertise. They came together about two years ago. Unlike a
normal partnership, they are not bound by formal links and maintain
individual bases throughout the country. But they work with each other
pooling their individual skills to help solve the business problems of
client companies.
David Adams has been consulting in business strategy and human
resources for 15 years, having left export finance and project
management for an international consulting group. He set up his own
consultancy in Fife nine years ago focusing on policy, organisation,
management and team development, remuneration, and incentives.
He enjoys working with Scottish companies from his base in Kinross. He
says: ''There are attractive strengths in Scotland. For example,
prosperity on Clydeside is IT, in Edinburgh it is financial enterprise.
''There are two factors currently helping Transition Partnerships to
function: a recovery from recession which is steady enough for people to
make investments; and a huge awareness of a trend towards using people
(staff) more cleverly to gain a competitive advantage.''
One of Mr Adams' clients is a leading international whisky distiller
whose values he describes as traditional and hierarchical. He says :
''It is competitive and one of the best but to modernise that hierarchy
it must have more of a team ethos and some softer values in the way the
company is managed.
''The company has identified a new philosophy of management but there
is a contrast between recognition and doing. It is crucial to get staff
with old value systems, geared up to put the new ones into practice. The
effectiveness of any organisation depends on relationships. If you get
them right, it does not matter what the structure is.''
David Maitland, who comes from Kirkcudbright, also set up his own
consultancy nine years ago. He spent 15 years as the manager with an
international bank in Hong Kong, Tokyo, New York, and London. His last
position was in charge of management development and training world
wide, dealing with the problems of organisation and performance.
He explained that all the partnership consultants have a good
understanding of how business is done as all have had first-hand
managerial experience and responsibility.
''We can give confidence to people who are in an experimental state of
development and take them through the transition. It is a question of
balance, a trade off between the important and the urgent,'' he said.
''Pressure on managers is growing, more output is asked for and people
tend to revert and behave in a way they found appropriate in previous
jobs even if it does not necessarity suit the new situation. When your
job, your livelihood and your career are at stake, you feel threatened
by the possibility of getting it wrong. You have been conditioned to
avoid mistakes all through your life but the most exciting managers
today are those who are open to the possibility of making mistakes and
who can say to someone who reports a mistake -- how can we learn from
it.''
Peter Jones, who is based in England, provides support in human
resources management projects and in organisation and staff development.
He comes from a background of senior personnel positions in UK and US
companies where he also directed itT and logistics activities.
He describes the consultants work as a partnership with their clients.
''From the outset we work with individuals and groups to talk through
issues,'' he says. We provide a sounding board to someone whom they can
say 'Help, I don't know what to do with this'.''
Part of the philosophy of Transition Partnerships is to accept change
and it is not by accident that its publicity material makes much of a
line from Robert Burns, ''Look abroad thro' Nature's range, Nature's
mighty law is change''. What the consultants do is inject businesses
with the willingness and courage to make that change.

<HEADLINE>Date set for cheese's court showdown</HEADLINE>

A BATCH of royal favourite Lanark Blue cheese is to have its day in
open court eight months after being impounded.
Yesterday Lanark Sheriff Court agreed to hear an application by
Clydesdale District Council for an order to condemn nearly a tonne of
the cheese, which was impounded in December last year.
The cheese was locked up after a random environmental health test at
an Edinburgh shop allegedly showed unacceptably high levels of the food
bug listeria.
A JP granted the council an order to condemn #27,000 worth of the
cheese and have it dumped on a landfill site after a private hearing at
the council's Lanark headquarters in February.
Facing financial disaster, cheesemaker Humphrey Errington appealed the
decision and won a judicial review at the Court of Session in Edinburgh
after the judge said he had been denied natural justice. The JP
conducting the hearing had refused to allow cross-examination of expert
witnesses by Mr Errington's lawyers.
The council appealed against that -- but lost. Now it plans to go back
to court and apply for an order to condemn the cheese -- except this
time it will be held in open court before a sheriff.
Yesterday lawyers representing both sides held a private meeting with
a sheriff to fix August 14 as the date to hear the destruction
application.
A spokeswoman for the sheriff's clerk's office confirmed that the date
had been fixed and a week booked to hear the application.
Yesterday Mr Bob Russell, director of housing and environmental
services on the council, said that his office would write to Mr
Errington notifying him.
He said: ''Our department will apply for an order under the 1990 Food
Act to condemn the batch of cheese. We insist that the levels of
listeria found in this cheese was a danger to the public.
''It's unfortunate that we have had to go to these lengths. But we
have followed the letter of the Act and obeyed the guidelines from the
Scottish Office in doing so.
''Through no fault of our own we find ourselves in this test case
situation.
''The Act appears to be flawed and if we have done something wrong
then someone needs to speak to the Scottish Office about its
guidelines.''
Mr Russell said he had no intention of asking for the hearing to be
held in private -- in fact he would rather it were held in public. ''But
the sheriff could decide otherwise, although I think that unlikely,'' he
said.
At his Ogscastle Farm, near Dunsyre, Lanarkshire, last night Mr
Errington said he would engage the same QC and firm of lawyers to defend
his cheese. He would pay his defence out of his own pocket because a
fighting fund from public donations had run out.
He said: ''I'm delighted at the chance of a fair hearing before a
sheriff. It's what we wanted since this began last December. The cheese
has listeria in it but its a non-toxic variety and perfectly safe.''
The suspect batch of 44 cheese rounds -- six were released as safe for
sale after tests -- have been deep-frozen at his farm.
This year's Lanark Blue -- made from unpasteurised ewe's milk -- is
selling at the rate of half a tonne a week and no fault has been found.
At last week's Highland Show in Edinburgh Mr Errington said the cheese
sold out its entire stock. Hundreds of people shook his hand to wish him
well in his legal battle.

JEFFREY ARCHER couldn't have scripted this. To describe such drama as
Shakespearean was mere cliche. It is farce; it is tragedy; it is
Gotterdammerung, right at the top of our politics. On Thursday the Prime
Minister decided to play with fire. Now, courtesy of John Redwood,
Secretary of State for Wales, as was, the First Lord of the Treasury is
juggling bottles of nitroglycerin. Slippery ones.
Terrific fun to watch. Until you start soberly to reflect on the
issues involved.
Most troubling, perhaps, is the wretched position of the Prime
Minister. What like of leadership is this? For two years and more he has
been besieged on all sides, scarcely a month passing without some new
embarrassment, some further scandal, some other ridiculous and
unnecessary debacle. Major has made dreadful mistakes. Having
emphatically declared that Britain would never, never leave the exchange
rate mechanism, within days he unblushingly pulled us out of it, as the
markets tore sterling to pieces.
Every precedent called for his resignation, that wild Wednesday in
September 1992. But he remained where he was. Months later, his
Chancellor Norman Lamont -- who had never liked the ERM anyway -- was
thrown to the wolves, a token scapegoat. It was a cheap trick and Major
has paid dearly for it.
Some Ministers, like David Mellor, would be exposed for rumpy-pumpy;
Major would declare his wholehearted support, defy press and nation to
change his mind, then buckle and dump the unfortunate colleague. From
the end of 1992 the fundamental weakness of the man was apparent to all.
Worse, his regime has calmly rewritten standards for public life. Party
manifestoes have been reduced to cynical vote-grabbers: VAT went on
fuel, in Lamont's last Budget, and exposed General Election pledges as
miserable lies.
Ministers misled the very House of Commons -- and kept their jobs.
Sleaze allegations -- undeclared private interests, cash sweeteners,
treats in expensive hotels -- have touched too many members of the Major
administration. Senior Cabinet Ministers, still in office, were happy to
sign ''certificates of public immunity'' that almost put innocent men in
prison.
Unlike Napoleon's ideal general, Major -- humanly speaking -- has been
dogged by monstrous ill-luck. His Government was launched at the dawn,
official, of what has now proved the longest recession in economic
history. It has coincided with a string of highly publicised troubles in
the royal family, in the Church of England, in the Bank of England --
all venerated national institutions, on whose supposed good character
Britain's morale, and the reputation of her Government, has stood for
far too long. Major has suffered from the venality of those about him.
It would be hard to imagine a nastier pack of rascals than some of his
colleagues -- Clarke, Lilley, Portillo -- or to conceive of how it must
feel to work alongside such hardened men, their contempt for you a
matter of common knowledge, their hearts set on the main chance for
themselves.
The Prime Minister, too, has had to endure the malice of his
predecessor, a bitter and increasingly bizarre old lady. He must be
granted one outstanding achievement: the peace so far wrought in
Northern Ireland. I have never liked the terms of that peace. I cringe
at the growing lionisation of Gerry Adams and his murderous gang
overseas. But, should the whole uneasy truce crumble tomorrow, Major has
at least wrung these eight months and more without killing.
Yet, against his Northern Ireland endeavours, Major's Scottish policy
looks all the more facile and ridiculous. He simply does not understand
our little country. He refuses, in the teeth of ever worse Tory
performances, to question for a moment his hardline Unionism. His public
statements on home rule insult our intelligence. Major may have stopped
bombing in Ulster. But such intransigence, over a long period and in
almost any other nation on earth, could have roused the unstable and the
crazed to terrorist atrocities on his northern Border.
And if I had to point out Major's worst and most damaging mistake, it
would be his clumsy treatment of the Euro-rebels. He was foolish enough
to make violent threats against any that might defy his party line on a
Commons vote in December. Some called his bluff. He stripped them of the
Tory whip, merrily reducing his Government to technical minority status
in the Commons. Months later, with no concession or apology from them,
the Tory Whip was restored. Here, indeed was a leader without judgment
and without guts.
And he has learned nothing. Yet again, tired, tormented, childish, the
Prime Minister has recklessly dowsed himself in petrol and struck the
match. With characteristic petulance, he throws down the gauntlet, quits
the leadership, defies any to stand against him. Surely only the
ridiculous Norman Lamont would take him on? But, once more, his bluff
has been called. A Cabinet colleague coldly resigns, coldly announces
his own candidacy. John Redwood does not carry the Lamont baggage; about
him there is no whiff of sour grapes, no air of raffishness. Whatever
else might be said of Redwood, he is calm, articulate, and brave.
What are the characteristics of the great leader? First, he has a
vision of what he wants to achieve. It may be a patriotic vision, as de
Gaulle had for France; a social vision, as Attlee had for Britain; a
depraved vision, as Hitler had for Europe. But the born leader has a
purpose, a dream. Upon it he sets his eyes and to it he marches
undeviatingly.
Secondly, he has persistence. The definition is simple: it is that
man, that woman, who gets up one more time than he falls down.
Thirdly, he has decision. The leader has only one need to function: to
be respected, and that is won by ability, by achievement, and not by
charm.
The tragedy of John Major is made all the worse by the genuine
niceness of the man. He is not easy to dislike: he is affable,
even-tempered, unpretentious, and possessed of a humility unusual in
politicians.
Others are better placed than I to speculate on the bizarre
possibilities of Tory leadership election arithmetic, to unfold the mind
and vision of John Redwood, to delight in the dilemmas of Heseltine and
Portillo, to cover this whole amazing drama. One thing now seems
certain. We will shortly have a new Prime Minister. I cannot but be
relieved, for the country and for the party; but I feel truly sorry for
John Major.

Geraldine Abrahams speaks to two artists who have pulled off the
masterstroke of uniting work and play
THE image of the artist living and working in a garret may seem far
removed from reality.
However, most art school graduates find it almost impossible to make a
living as artists, and often have to do something totally unrelated to
art, just to survive.
Some find they can combine art-related employment with their work as
artists, such as Norah Campbell and Val Leckie, two of the eight Mull
Colourists who will exhibit at the Mendelssohn on Mull Festival from 1-9
July.
Norah Campbell grew up on the island of Mull. She had always had an
aptitude for art and when she left Oban High School, she applied to art
school in Edinburgh.
When she was not accepted on the first application, she spent a year
at Glasgow College of Building and Printing on a Design For Print
course, then successfully re-applied and specialised in drawing and
painting.
After graduating in 1991, she was fortunate to find work almost
immediately with Jim Heggie of the Edinburgh Gallery, helping to
organise openings and prepare Edinburgh Festival exhibitions.
The next step was to go to Jordanhill for a teaching qualification
which proved instrumental in helping her get back to painting.
''Meeting other people of like mind takes you back to how you felt in
the first place,'' she says. ''It gives you a belief in what you are
doing.'' Following a trip to India, she has been painting ever since.
She finds that the combination of exhibition work and painting works
positively for her. ''When I'm painting and it is going badly, I involve
myself in exhibition organising,'' she explains.
''Although art based, it is organised, formulated, something I can do
without having to think intensively, so I find that they complement each
other.''
Apart from the gallery work, she has also organised her own one-woman
shows. ''Both Val and I have been lucky enough to have had our own
shows. We have sold in the past and continue to to sell, but it is not
consistent enough and we haven't broken into the circuit where someone
is brave enough to back you.''Val Leckie, originally from Glasgow and
now living on Mull, agrees totally. ''Making a living as an artist is
almost impossible,'' she says. ''You usually always have to do something
else as well.''
She left school at 15, and having exhibited a flair for art, started
work as a design trainee at the Templeton carpet factory at Glasgow
Green. She spent two years there and decided that she did not want to
design, but was desperate to draw and paint. Returning to a 6th-form
school in Edinburgh, she acquired the necessary qualifications for art
school and chose to go to Nottingham for four years.
''I began to understand the direction I wanted to go in. I got very
involved in print making and silkscreen painting -- all media based, but
by the end of four years, I felt a strong need to return to Scotland.
''During the holidays, I had worked in the Innemore School of Painting
at Mull, so my partner and I decided to come up to live and work on
Mull, and we started a print workshop there.''
She had always wanted to teach so, following the birth of her two
children, she went to Jordanhill where she met Norah, and they have been
friends ever since.
She spends much of her time working with primary school children in
the Oban/Lorne area, taking them out into the countryside. She also
teaches children with special needs, using varying approaches designed
to help them make connections as well as achieve a sense of fulfillment.
''It is important to show children the whole range of artistic
experiences,'' she says. ''Art should be in every aspect of our lives --
everyone has the potential to be creative.''
Like Norah, she finds her teaching experience enhances her painting,
and when she is working well as a teacher it is reflected in her
painting.
Norah and Val say it is necessary for everyone to experience the
negative as well as the positive aspects of working as an artist.
''It doesn't matter how much you do ahead of the time, when it comes
to the month of May and you have three weeks left to put your stuff on
the wall for Judgment Day, nothing prepares you for that, it is
something you have to experience yourself,'' says Norah.

WE are in receipt of a copy of the Chicago Sun-Times newspaper where
we read that the good people of the suburb of Andersonville are having a
telephone poll about the Scottish accent emanating from a talking cash
machine at a local bank.
The machine was built in Dundee, at the AT&amp;T factory (NCR as was)
where most of the world's hole-in-the-wall money devices are made. The
voice facility is an optional extra to help the visually impaired (or
those with really bad eyesight, as we call them at the Diary).
These machines are not common in Britain but are used in the US and
the Far East. The hole-i'-the-wa' (as they say in Dundee) comes with a
basic default set of audio responses as recorded in Clootie City by
Sally Masterson, late of Radio Tay.
There is a facility for banks to input their own voice but the bank in
Andersonville preferred to keep Sally's cute Scotch accent. The town
appears to be divided on the issue.
Some get confused by the strange lilt. Others just love it. Including
one chap who loved and lost a Scottish lassie and goes regularly to the
cash machine just to hear the Scottish accent and mope a little.
Alas the technology at Dundee has moved on and Sally's tape has been
replaced by digital technology. Banks everywhere can customise the
spoken word to suit their clients.
The nice man at the AT&amp;T Dundee factory said there appeared not to be
a great demand from Scottish banks for the verbals. Which is a great
pity since each airt and pairt could make their individual mark.
In Aberdeen, the machine could ask ''Fit like?'' In Paisley, it might
say: ''Surely, you're not going to spend all that?'' In Edinburgh the
voice would ask if you had had your tea. In Glasgow, a voice could very
well ask in which pub you intend to spend the folding stuff.
Desperanto
THE power of language and the way it can break down frontiers. Or not,
as the case may be. A woman from Carfin was on a pilgrimage to Lourdes
and wanted to take back a memento of her visit. She was having terrible
trouble making herself understood and was relieved to find a little
souvenir shop with the sign ''English spoken here'' prominently
displayed in the window. The woman carefully selected her preferred
religious artefact, a statue of Mary and the baby Jesus, and approached
the girl asking: ''Excuse me, hen, whit does the likes of this run in
at?''
All screwed up
FURTHER proof, were it needed, that librarians lead a sheltered life
is contained in a communication from the British Library to Alan
Caldwell, a dear colleague of the Diary whose day job is resident
Rottweiler on our sister paper the Evening Times.
Mr Caldwell is author of Sack the Board -- Celtic, the End of a
Dynasty, the inside story of the coup d'etat at Parkhead. His tome has
obviously come to the attention of the British Library who took the
opportunity to write to ask: ''Are you also the author, editor, or
translator of Caldwell's Screw Tug Design?''
He claims not.
European airbus
A VISITOR to these parts from the United States was extolling the
virtues of all things Scottish after returning to the home of the brave
and the land of the free. She waxed lyrical in particular about the
treatment she had received at Glasgow Airport from all of the staff both
on the ground and on the Loganair plane aboard which she was bound for
the islands.
The plane was the rather Transit van-like but very functional Shorts
360. Our friend wrote a wee note to those at the airport who had treated
her so well: ''We were taken on board and headed out towards the runway.
It was all very comfortable, but imagine my surprise when what I thought
was the airport bus taking us out to the airplane suddenly picked up
speed and took off.''
* THE lengths to which the Americans will go to be health conscious
and at the same time a little different know no bounds. In a New York
coffee house one of the specialities is a double decaffeinated
cappuccino made with skimmed milk and flavoured with NutraSweet. It is
known as a ''Why Bother?''
* GOING the rounds in the US at the moment: What is the difference
between O J Simpson and Superman? O J is going to walk.
Soup's aff
WE return to the Auld Alliance with tales of how young Scots coped
with having your tea French-style. Marlene Barrie of Blairdardie,
Glasgow, recalls hitch-hiking through France on a budget of thruppence a
day.
She and her chum decided to blow their last centimes on dinner in a
small hotel. They were famished and delighted when a huge tureen
containing a gallon or so of homemade lentil soup was planked on their
table.
It was something of a challenge but they managed to finish all of the
soup. Much to the chagrin of the other dozen or so other diners who had
been patiently waiting for the tureen to be passed on so they could have
their portion of soup.
They realised their gaffe and apologised to the patron. He recognised
the accent and asked ''Ecossaises?'' At which point the fellow diners
shrugged, smiled, and accepted that ''the soup was aff''.
Mike Blair of Rothesay tells of the time he was dispatched by his
school for a month with a family in Brest, Brittany. At meal times the
choice of drink was red wine which, as a mere lad of 14, he felt was out
of bounds, or a golden-coloured drink in a bottle with the lable ''Viva
Limonada''.
He opted for the lemonade, which was extremely pleasant and which he
drank in copious quantities. It had the side-effect of causing him to
feel light-headed, lose co-ordination, and have a bit of a headache of a
morning.
The reasons for this became apparent the next weekend when the French
father loaded his car with the empty lemonade bottles and drove to a
local farmyard where they were filled with the Breton equivalent of
scrumpy.

Eric Kennedy spotlights a man whose profession needs requires plenty
of class
PERHAPS end-of-term is not the best time to interview a teacher:
everyone knows the run-down period before the summer holidays is a time
when things look rosy.
Maybe this is not such a bad job after all. Six weeks or more of
freedom.
It is, as Michael Reynolds admits, one of the perks of the job. ''But
most teachers would say they need their holidays,'' says the principal
teaching of computing at Uddingston Grammar.
''It can be a stressful profession. Teachers have certainly seen their
workload increase over the past few years.''
Michael originally studied architecture at Strathclyde University for
just over a year after leaving St Bride's High School, East Kilbride, in
1974 with five Highers including Maths, Chemistry and Physics. He
swopped courses, to civil engineering, and graduated BSc. (Civil Eng.)
four years later.
Recession in the building industry, and allied career uncertainties,
led to him taking a year off, driving a bus, while considering what to
do next.
He decided on teaching and entered Jordanhill Teacher Training College
(now part of Strathclyde University) in 1981.
He emerged from his one-year course for graduates in 1982, with his
teacher-training certificate. He taught maths for a year at St Michael's
Academy, Kilwinning, moved on to John Ogilvie High School in Hamilton in
1983, and continued teaching maths.
He also graduated BA from the Open University in Maths and Computing,
and in 1990 he was promoted to senior teacher in charge of computing.
''I had an interest in the subject,'' he says. ''It was a new subject
with new possibilities. It just seemed the right time to go into it.''
In 1992 he moved to Uddingston Grammar as Principal Teacher of
Computing and has been there ever since, in charge of an expanding and
ever-changing subject which continues to fascinate him.
Part of his work involves bringing reports and other documentation
home, so it is not quite the nine-to-four job people might think. He is
expected to be up-to-date with educational initiatives, and with
developments in software and hardware which might benefit his school, so
this work can even spill over into his weekends.
His department provides an introductory course for first-year pupils,
and offers third-year pupils the opportunity to attain Standard Grade
Computing, Higher Computing, and Computing Modules.
They study how computers work, computing systems, general-purpose
packages (including word processing, databases, spreadsheets and desktop
publishing packages), commercial data processing, and robotics.
As we spoke he was preparing to go to an Internet conference and is
confident he will soon be heavily involved in the information
superhighway.
Meanwhile, his career would seem to be on a sure path. ''I like what I
do, I like kids, and no, I don't think computers will ever replace
teachers,'' he says.
''You will always need the human touch in this job.''

TWO DAYS on the trot appeared the name of Cotton Mather. Once would
have been a lot. Twice rapid seemed too much. Was some message trying to
get through? Besides, the second time that old Cotton cropped up there
near him was my name. It is not a happening to keep mum about.
Anyhow, and talking about mum, what kind of parents lumber an
offspring with a handle like Cotton?
Previous acquaintance was unlikely. For the pages we shared were an
eight-volume tome of religious writing that sought to tell the total
story of Christianity from the year dot and throughout the whole world
including Paisley, where the book was published some mature time ago,
like in 1730.
Since when there has been one popular Cotton. He has a back-up place
in cops-and-robbers fiction. Cotton Hawes is a detective in the 87th
Precinct novels of Ed McBain. He is a tall elegant shamus with a streak
of white hair from an old knive wound above the left temple of his red
head.
The material Cotton -- the Mather boy -- is somebody else encountered
on a ScotRail rattler to Dundee. For company I had The Years With Ross,
the reminiscences by James Thurber of his long time on New Yorker
magazine.
Thurber was recalling bits of bother with lawyers, especially one rub
that became historic.
He had rewritten an article about a former child prodigy, name of
William James Sidis, a mathematical whiz-kid. At one time (early this
century) Sidis's name was often on newspaper front pages. But when he
grew up, he was not heard of. That was the point of Thurber's article.
It was one of those Where Are They Now? space fillers beloved by
sun-numbed editors during long summers when news is quiet. Their virtue
lies in permitting journals to vamp their way through June when, except
for this year, nothing much newsworthy happens.
What did happen was that William James Sidis objected to the dragging
of his name back into print after 20 years of decent obscurity. His
privacy had been invaded. When, after four years, his case reached the
Supreme Court in Washington, he lost. His defeat remains a big score in
the international fight for press freedom.
In more elaborate language, the judges said that anybody who had once
been a public figure stayed a public figure. He was fair game.
So, legally, people had a right to be reminded how sweet-faced WJ
Sidis, wearing black velvet knickers, had addressed a gathering of
higher mathematicians when aged 11. At nine he had been clever enough to
go to Harvard University, but had to wait until all of 12. ''It was the
same age at which Cotton Mather had entered Harvard,'' James Thurber
wrote.
He just pops the name. No explanation appears. It is assumed that
Cotton was common knowledge which everybody picked up like a rich tea
biscuit along with the school milk.
If pressed, I'd have guessed he was an early plantation owner who
freed his black slaves. Since nobody asked, I forgot it. That seemed
sensible -- until yesterday. Cotton reeled right back.
There he was again -- more than once and stacked like a whole packet
of tea biscuits -- in the work of the Rev Robert Millar, an
eighteenth-century Paisley divine, unknown to me and perhaps to
everybody.
Millar's devotion to tell the entire history of Christianity included
calling his book The Whole Works, and no wonder. For some of the
American end of his mission he confessed he cribbed from Cotton Mather.
So now it can be told that old Cotton was a zealous puritan historian.
His dates were 1663-1728. He married three times and believed in
witches. He wrote about them and nearly everything else. To his name he
has about 400 publications. Among his honours was a doctor of divinity
degree that Glasgow University gave him. He began to seem almost a local
boy.
For where The Whole Works has resurfaced is in the hands of Adam
McNaughtan, scholar, rhymer, and bookseller of this parish. Somewhere he
has picked up most of its volumes, or otherwise had them wished upon
him.
As well as at great length, the Paisley gospeller writes wonderfully
well in bright simple words. ''But in an idle moment it was seeing that
the book had an index that interested me,'' Adam McNaughtan conceded.
Apart from digging up my Cotton, another lesson of The Whole Works is
that nothing in the world is new about flogging books. A reprint in 1789
of Mr Millar's lamp-burning researches was sold out before the first
volume appeared. Doors had been chapped all over the West of Scotland
and money promised.
Before the first chapter was inked, buyers were lined up all over the
place, even Paisley. They promised to pay in instalments for one volume
every two months. In return they would see their own names in print.
Such publishing in numbers attracted about 1200 subscribers --
shoemakers, brewers, weavers (all 475 of them), and even ministers. Adam
McNaughtan is putting their names and trades in a computer to study how
working-class readers used to pay as they read.
And, lo, on the list of subscribers in the last volume after Alexander
Hodge, of Newmills, appears one William Hunter, weaver, of Lochwinnioch
(as it is spelt). It was a moment too golden not to share, and there is
more.
Recounting how one strange name led to another has left out an odder
one. It belonged to Cotton's old man. He was called Increase (yep!)
Mather.

A FATHER and son business partnership are proving that management
training is one way forward for small companies keen to increase
efficiency.
Raymond Murray Jnr has recently gained a certificate from the
Intermediate National Examination Board of Supervisory Management
(NEBSM) course run by East Kilbride Business Centre and largely funded
by Strathclyde Business Development -- the economic arm of the regional
council.
Among the participants sharing the honours on the same day from
another course run by the Centre into Computers in Business was his
father Raymond Murray Snr (50).
Both were part of the original team, along with Donald Kirkwood and
Albert King, who set up East Kilbride Industrial Plastics in 1987.
For Raymond Murray Snr, his course provided him with a chance to
evaluate the power of computers in business, and the vision to implement
time and cost-saving practices, while his son Raymond Jnr boned up on
management techniques.
Raymond Jnr said: ''The course really opened my eyes up to a whole
range of issues from health and safety to time management and the proper
management of people and resources.
''As a result we are now instituting our own quality procedures, which
I believe will have long-term benefits for the firm.''

IT HAS become something of a cliche to say that the Conservative Party
is tearing itself apart. Cliche or not, that phrase will be heard more
frequently as we move towards the leadership election, but the truth in
the phrase should not be dulled by constant repetition. The fact is
that, instead of reaching for the safe ground of former unity, the
Conservatives are rowing madly in all directions. The intervention of Mr
John Redwood in the leadership contest will merely exacerbate this
condition. He is not an emollient person, his views are much closer to
the extreme right than to the centre, and any possibility of him
providing either the impetus for unity, or a figure around whom various
elements of the party could unite, is wholly fictitious. A most
important question follows from this. If the Conservative Party cannot
unite under Mr Major, could never unite under Mr Redwood, and is
unlikely to unite under Mr Portillo or Mr Heseltine, where is the
Conservative Party? The question can be taken further: is there a
Conservative Party in terms which would be recognisable to the bulk of
the country?
Fortunately, there is. It is the remnant of the One-Nation Toryism of
the post-war years which believes in a United Kingdom united by mutual
interest. It does not wish to dismantle sensible welfare provision, does
not want to leave the European Union, and most emphatically wishes to
remain at the centre of European and world affairs. It is represented by
Mr Major, Mr Heseltine, and Mr Clarke, though all of them would have to
admit that their basic policies have been whittled and distorted by the
nagging attacks of their right-wing colleagues. Clearly they are on the
defensive, and not the least sign of this was the confidence displayed
by Mr Redwood yesterday. His announcement of intention to compete for
the leadership was accompanied by the waving of the usual right-wing
banners on Europe and the impossibility of Britain joining a single
European curency. But the tone of Mr Redwood's statements, and the core
of his coming appeal to the party, is clearly concentrated on the need
for firm leadership. It is true that Conservatives love firm leadership.
They regret the passing of Margaret Thatcher because of the power of her
leadership rather than her frequently disastrous policies (not least the
poll tax, hatched in Mr Redwood's policy unit), but they must put aside
their need for imposed discipline and consider the wider picture.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer was devastatingly accurate yesterday
when he pointed out that an ultra-right-wing programme of the sort
espoused by Mr Redwood would keep the Tories out of power for 1000
years. Mr Redwood will produce his programme and policies today, but
those many Tory MPs whose parliamentary seats hang by a thread should
take a long, hard look at the Redwood proposals and calculate whether
they will win votes in the country at large and for Tory MPs in
particular. Mr Redwood, they should recall, is the man who clearly
cannot abide the welfare state and who had such morally repugnant things
to say last year about single mothers. Moreover he is the man who has
used Wales as a test-bed for some of these theories and who cannot by
any means be said to have endeared himself to the Welsh electorate.
Although it is unlikely that Mr Redwood will win the election, the
general right-wing cause within the Tory party will probably remain in
the ascendant. Unity, whoever leads, will not be achievable and it is at
least possible that the Tory party will split. At the moment, this is
the unthinkable. In the long-run it may represent the only salvation for
decent Conservative policies.

THE Egyptian President's narrow escape from assassination in Addis
Ababa will be welcomed as warmly internationally as it was by officials
when he returned to Cairo. The incident is a reminder of the basic
nature of Middle Eastern political life: Mr Mubarak, like the leaders of
the other moderate (and the traditional) Muslim states, is permanently
in danger of his life. Although the would-be murderers, three of whom
lost their own lives, have not yet been identified and no organisation
has claimed responsibility for their operation, it seems likely that
Egyptian Muslim fundamentalists will have been involved. Their battle
with the Mubarak administration is relentless and, since their aims
cannot be accommodated in the secular society he seeks to maintain,
conflict is unavoidable. The only certainty is that yesterday's attempt
will be repeated if the opportunity presents itself again.
While direct violence is a vital tool of the Egyptian fundamentalists,
it is not their only approach, and may even be seen as a mere adjunct to
a far more comprehensive political movement designed to demonstrate the
advantages of an Islamic state: that is a community whose legal,
political, and economic affairs are dictated by religious considerations
and prescriptions. There is no doubt of the appeal of such dictates for
many Muslims who prefer them to the far looser social and economic norms
of a secular society on the Western model. Given the enormous stress
imposed on the Egyptian economy by the country's soaring birthrate,
Western modes are far from seeming to deliver even the enhanced
materiality they suppose. Mr Mubarak's Government has to run very fast
in order, almost, to stand still. He has not been able to point
convincingly to economic improvement for, although it has occurred, it
has not been dramatic enough to have impressed the popular imagination.
Moreover the Government has been utterly ruthless in its repressive
techniques and has tended therefore to extremism itself. It might be
better advised to try to insert wedges among its opponents, who are not
as monolithic as they are often portrayed. A battle for hearts and
minds, which is what is involved here, is for opinion in the middle, the
mass of Egyptian people. The fear is that the fundamentalists may be
waging this battle better than the Government. They have a greater
appeal to the mosques and to the Muslim welfare associations and
charities which are vital to a society without a developed social
security system.
That the assassination attempt was made in a neighbouring country
rather than Egypt itself is a reminder that the fundamentalist movement
is an international one, though it is inspired, and mainly financed, by
Iran. Egypt is not the only target of this movement but it is, with
Algeria, the major focus. In its case its strategic location, wealth,
and accord with Israel all testify to its importance. It is the richest
country in the Islamic world and, with Algeria, the one best placed to
make the transition to a successful secular society in which religion
could flourish without dominating everything else. Were Egypt to fall,
the whole matter of Israeli security would be re-opened just at the
point when it might be settled on the one remaining exposed frontier
with Syria and Lebanon. Other states with Muslim majorities which have
already made the transition (the most important is Turkey) would
suddenly look less stable, and traditional states with Western
associations, like Saudi Arabia and Jordan, would soon be at risk. There
is a lot at stake in Egypt, which makes the assassination attempt more
than ever regrettable, especially if it hardens President Mubarak when
he really needs to be more flexible.

I WISH to set the record straight about the work being undertaken by
the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties on the operation of closed
circuit television in public places.
From James Freeman's article (June 17), it would appear that our
campaigning is confined to placing articles in newspapers, which is a
nonsense.
SCCL has spoken at meetings, researched two briefing papers on the
issue, and published draft rules for the use of CCTV which produced
responses from the Scottish Office, individuals, local authorities, the
police, and voluntary organisations.
These rules have now been finalised.
We have written numerous letters to a variety of agencies, including
CityWatch, furnished information to local authorities, individuals and
groups, answered inquiries, and made available our files of articles and
clippings to people who visit our library.
The work carried out on this single issue has occupied a significant
part of our time since 1992. Whereas the supporters of CCTV have a very
active and well-resourced machine, SCCL is a small voluntary
organisation with only two full-time and one part-time members of staff.
Although the Chief Constable of Strathclyde is reported as saying that
he has received '' . . . no direct complaints from members of the public
on civil liberty issues surrounding the cameras . . . '' SCCL has
received lots and from a variety of sources.
We would of course expect to be the recipient of such complaints
because our campaign questions establishment logic and recognises that
civil liberties can be protected by numerous crime prevention measures.
The Chief Constable of Strathclyde Police in a letter to us (August
10, 1994) declined to comment on our draft rules and preferred to leave
it to the crime standing committee of the Association of Chief Police
Officers in Scotland.
This was a pity because we specifically addressed the issue of the
failure of the police to provide crime displacement figures as a result
of the scheme in Airdrie Town Centre.
Individuals, organisations, and local authorities were encouraged to
set up CCTV schemes because of the alleged ''success'' of the Airdrie
scheme. Were accurate and reliable figures on crime displacement to be
made public, then a more tempered assessment could be made.
James Freeman's article focused solely on those who were promoting
CCTV in Glasgow City Centre. What about the famous rule that balance is
required for any story? Given that adverse comments were made about
SCCL, I would have expected that at least we would have been invited to
comment!
Carole Ewart,
Director, Scottish Council for Civil Liberties,
146 Holland Street,
Glasgow.

A STIRLINGSHIRE farmer left sick sheep in a field last winter with
just mould in their feeding rack, a court heard yesterday. Six animals
died from the effects of disease and malnutrition, and another four were
found almost on their last legs, Stirling Sheriff Court was told.
Charles Hillhouse, 37, of Strewiebank Farm, who blamed pressure of work,
was fined #500.

IF, after a General Election, anyone who was not the leader of the
largest party in the House of Commons, went to the Palace to ask for the
Seal of State as Prime Minister, he or she would be led away and advised
to seek help.
Presently we have a Prime Minister who is not the leader of any party.
There may be fine constitutional justifications for this state of
affairs but surely John Major is morally bound to offer his resignation
of Her Majesty rather than use his office of the Crown as a kind of
joker in his power game within his own party.

WAS John Major's decision to resign the leadership of the Conservative
Party not really an admission that he had failed and had no confidence
himself, in being able to maintain support for his Government in both
Houses of Parliament?
Were the situation that there had just been a General Election and his
party had been returned without an overall majority and no hope of a
coalition -- as happened to Ted Heath in 1974 -- then a constitutional
procedure would have been applied.
This would involve the anonymous advisers to Her Majesty suggesting
that the leader of the next largest party be asked to form a new
Government, which is exactly what the country needs at the moment.
Mr Major's supporters seem to be falling over themselves to compliment
him for being so righteous and bold. His re-election, it is hoped, will
be good for the Tory Party and, in the words of his campaign manager,
Ian Lang, be in the national interest.
In this instance, as in so many others in recent times, the party
comes before the country.
In my opinion, the only honourable course for the Prime Minister would
have been to have asked for a dissolution of Parliament and to have
called a General Election. This would have enabled the rest of us to
have had a say in who the next Prime Minister should be, rather than 300
or so mixed up Tory MPs.

MICHAEL FRY'S article, The Perversion of Democracy (June 21), is
remarkable for its failure to expand its analysis of the problems of a
one-party state to include the 16-year term of the Conservative
Government and the appalling and ongoing example of corruption and
sleaze set by the current Government.
Michael Fry thinks voters must be mad to elect the Labour Party in
perpetuity. I also think that a part of the electorate must be mad to
have voted for four consecutive governments in a row. But then, I am not
a beneficiary of the bribes to part of the electorate to which much of
the Government's policy-making has been shamelessly directed.
We have recently heard much concern from senior Conservative Party
figures such as Michael Portillo on the need of the Government to
recapture its natural voters by producing policies which are attractive
to them.
Presumably Michael Fry believes that it is as defensible for a
Conservative Government to shape its policy to attract votes as it is of
socialist councils to attract voters with cheap council housing rents
(no mention here of MIRAS), jobs, and capital investment.
At least the policies of the Socialists result in a redistribution of
wealth towards things essential to the quality of life, ie, housing and
employment, and do not focus on the morally bankrupt and irresponsible
end-game of producing higher and higher disposal incomes.
I do not accept that Socialist councils have relieved themselves of
the obligation to pay for these forward-looking -- if sometimes badly
implemented -- ideals since they are only claiming money available to
them through the Exchequer.
But, even if that were the case, it would be no more reprehensible
that the actions of the Thatcher Government and its successors for whom
mass unemployment was a policy and who then disowned the unemployed and
marginalised the needs of the elderly, the sick, and those who were
incapable. More generally most readers will have no need to be reminded
of how very rotten we have discovered the core of Conservative
philosophy to be these last 16 years.
It is to be hoped that most of the rotten apples in Monklands have
once and for all been shaken from the barrel. Any proven corruption
should be met with the full force of the law. In the same way it is to
be hoped that the inquiry into Westminster City Council will put an end
to that shameful example of funding social and political engineering
through taxpayers' money.
Corruption in government, local or otherwise, is the result of the
heady combination of the power to command resources and the human
capacity for self-aggrandisement. That does not mean it is inevitable or
or acceptable.
But in every area of local government and in every Government,
irrespective of poltical colour, the search would not need to run too
deep to find examples of corruption. At best we can put in place
arrangements to detect and punish transgressions and encourage an ethos
in which corruption is seen to be unacceptable.
This process would be very much easier if Government Ministers and MPs
used their highest standards by which all other public servants could be
judged. Alas, the current Conservative Government leave behind it a
trail of corruption and sleaze which sets the very worst of examples.

MICHAEL FRY'S article, The Perversion of Democracy (June 21), gives
food for thought.
If the SNP had its way and Scotland became independent, we would end
up with a Government dominated by West of Scotland and Central Belt
representatives, and therefore overwhelmingly Labour in its composition.
Monklands would, as implied, be writ large across the new nation, and
with independence achieved the Nats would become an irrelevance.
Purely on the basis of ''better the devil you know,'' if for no other
reason, I would be for sticking with the Union as it is.

Baroness Thatcher in America was equivocal. Last week she supported
Major. Now she says: ''Both candidates are sound Conservatives -- next
question?'' She spoke, however, of Mr Redwood's swift rise to the
Cabinet and said he was ''very able''.
She had received a report of the Redwood news conference from Lord
Tebbit. The challenger did well: articulate, clear-minded and charming.
This surprised the parliamentary lobby, more accustomed to regarding him
as the equivalent of Mr Spock of Star Trek.

<TEXT>
THE mother of a teenage joy-rider murdered by Paratrooper Lee Clegg in
West Belfast five years ago was awarded undisclosed damages yesterday.
It was understood to be a five-figure sum. Karen Reilly, 17, was
killed along with Martin Peake, 18, when soldiers fired 19 bullets into
a stolen car as it crashed through a checkpoint in 1990.
At the time she was earning #90 a week in a clothing factory and in
papers before the High Court in Belfast it was claimed that she
contributed to the family budget.
Her mother, Mrs Mary Reilly, from Jasmine Walk, Twinbrook, Belfast,
sued the Ministry of Defence and the case was settled out of court.
Under the settlement Mrs Reilly and her legal advisers were bound by a
confidence clause preventing them from diclosing any details.
Meanwhile, an announcement is expected shortly on whether Clegg, 26,
sentenced to life imprisonment in June 1993, is to be released.
His case was recently considered by the Life Sentence Review Board in
Belfast and its recommendation is now in the hands of Northern Ireland
Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew.
More than two million people have signed petitions supporting a
campaign to free Clegg who is in Wakefield Prison. One report last week
said he would be released soon into military 'care'.
The House of Lords turned down his appeal against conviction in
January.

Lynne Robertson reports on the man who promises to give Edinburgh a
railway station to be proud of.
THE new man in charge of Britain's 14 biggest railway stations has
pledged that Edinburgh will have a showpiece station for the
twenty-first century.
Edinburgh-born Peter Monaghan also claimed that nothing would change
when control of Scotland's busiest stations, Edinburgh Waverley and
Glasgow Central, moves South of the Border in about a week's time.
The 47-year-old general manager of Railtrack Property, who now lives
in Solihull in the West Midlands, said one of his first tasks would be
to give every single customer at each of the 14 stations a say in its
future.
Previously the two Scottish stations were under the management of rail
bosses in Glasgow, most recently under the wing of Railtrack Scotland,
based in Cowcaddens.
Speaking on a whistle-stop tour of all 14 stations, Monaghan claimed
the rail links, which collectively employ more than 600 staff, were in
safe hands.
''My colleagues in London are going to be looking at me very carefully
to make sure that I don't actually give too much preference to the
Scottish stations,'' he joked.
Monaghan is a son of the manse (his father, Jim, was formerly minister
at Davidson's Mains Church in Edinburgh), and was educated at George
Watson's College and Heriot-Watt University, where he gained a BA in
commerce.
He was retail development manager for John Menzies in Edinburgh until
1981, before embarking on a wide business career, which included jobs
with retail group Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Storecard, Dolland &amp; Aitchison, B&amp;Q
and Asda.
The newly appointed property chief said all travellers at his stations
would be consulted through questionnaires about the changes and
improvements they want to see.
He emphasised the importance of improving Edinburgh's main railway
station because of the huge numbers of tourists who flood into the
capital each year.
As an Edinburgh man, the new chief said he fully appreciated the
importance of ensuring visitors received a good impression of the
capital when they stepped off the train.
Mr Monaghan admitted many improvements could be made to the historic
Victorian metal and glass-roofed structure housing Waverley Station,
which suffers frequent leaks during bad weather. ''I know there is an
opportunity here, but I know there is a lot of work to be done.''
Waverley Station started life as the North British Station in 1846 and
was designed by John Miller for the North British Railway Company. It
changed its name in 1854 and was rebuilt by engineers Blyth and Westland
in 1892.
Mr Monaghan said he hoped to lure people to the station, not only to
travel, but to socialise and shop. ''I want to make the station not only
the place you go to to catch a train, but a place you go to at lunchtime
for a cup of coffee or to shop. I want people to say 'let's go to the
wine bar in Waverley Station or let's have a pizza there'.
''By the year 2000, I would hope we would be well on the way to having
a showpiece station, a station that everybody in Edinburgh can be proud
of,'' he said.
He also hinted at new plans for the award-winning Glasgow Central,
which has gained top architecture and rail heritage prizes.
''Glasgow Central is built around arches. There is a lot of surplus
space there and I will be looking to see what we can actually do with
all that space,'' he said.
Glasgow Central was designed by Sir Robert Rowand Anderson for the
Caledonian Railway Company. Completed in 1879, it was extended between
1899 and 1905 by architect James Miller.
Summing up his vision for the future of Britain's most important
stations, Monaghan said he was aware of the problems he faced.
''I'm not a transport person. I have come from outside the industry
and I am very much a commercial person. My challenge is enormous in
terms of its complexity.
''Because of the size of the stations, I don't expect people to see
changes overnight. What is important is to do the job properly.''

John Linklater takes a walk on the sunny side of the street and finds
the weather has transformed moods and styles.
WHEN traffic wardens crack jokes and motor-cycle traffic police
gallantly turn up their visors to swap pleasantries, there is
confirmation that the general disposition is sunny. It is a mood thing.
A tempo thing. Slow and easy. All it took was a few days of blue skies,
and the whole mood changes.
Peter the traffic warden is walking down the Broomielaw in shirt
sleeves. Not out to meet any pressure quotas for tickets issued on
vehicles, but just walking about and trying to get a little bit of a
sun-tan, like any other sane soul with the excuse of a job out of the
office yesterday afternoon. We are all in heatwave mufti, to whatever
extent is permissible.
What is it about the sudden absence of a uniform jacket that humanises
its non-wearer? ''Most of these uniforms are just painted on, anyway,''
says Peter by explanation. No, there is not a regulation temperature
level which must be reached before he is authorised to lose the jacket.
As long as he wears the tie and the hat, he thinks.
At 23C again for Glasgow yesterday, and one of the hottest spots in
Europe beyond the Mediterranean coast, the sun has got its helmet on for
Sergeant Duffy and Constable Curson. Until traffic police are equipped
with baseball caps, and it would be a poor safety example, they are a
bit limited in the way they can celebrate this glorious change in the
weather. ''The sweat is running down my leathers,'' confides Sergeant
Duffy. Wouldn't he be happier riding bare torsoed through the city?
''Some of us don't have the physique for that. Too many beer bellies,''
is the surprisingly candid response. This weather has a way of getting
under people's shells, even if they are still forced to wear them.
Like street orderly William Docherty. He has a route, and that route
takes in the plum job on a day like this: George Square. Now, it would
take more than his regulation-issue orange trousers, the fluorescent
yellow sleeveless worn bare-armed, and the steel toe-capped boots to get
him down. George Square on an office lunchtime is a very pleasant
prospect, offering many stirring sights, and William is relishing them.
''It's this wind,'' he suggests methodically. ''It blows up a lot of
dust and rubbish.'' That is why he reckons it will take him at least an
hour to get round the square with his Green Machine, like a big open-air
street Hoover. What is it about men, though, that leaves us so
conspicuously gobsmacked by a change in the weather like this? We just
don't appear to have the wardrobes to cope with our good luck, and if
there are not the regulation uniforms to look uncomfortable in, we do
our best with something of our own to fling on. The ancient shorts
exposing puce knees. Ankle socks. And shoes, usually everyday shoes that
look embarrassed by the withdrawal of a covering trouser cuff. Women
just wear lighter versions of their normal gear, and look great. When
the sun shines, men look as though they are answering a fire alarm in
the middle of the night.
Or there is the dive to invest in something ''summery''. Again, women
know how to turn the opportunity to their advantage. Men panic
themselves into spending a fortune on anything they vaguely associate
with sun. Usually a Panama hat. At the Glasgow Hat Shop, managing
director Jennifer Lavelle reports tremendous sales on the items that
collapse neatly back into their tube, at #57.50 a shot. Has anyone ever
been known to wear one of these things after the first day's guffaws?
''Particularly balding men,'' says Jennifer. She adds with a motherly
note: ''They need protection.'' From themselves?
Yet this sunny affability that is generated all around the place is
capable of absorbing such eccentricities and sartorial affronts. We all
assume a new generosity, and smile encouragingly, even if it is really
just the bright light making us squint. But it is infectious. At
Scrimshaws, the hairdressers on Wilson Street, they had their customers
out on the pavement, in shades, to get their trims. ''It saves on the
blow drying,'' says Sharon Parry, working away with her scissors as
customer Liam just lies back and enjoys himself.
Saddest failed al fresco yesterday was at the newly opening Cafe
Rouge, by the Italian Centre on George Street. They had turned away 150
customers yesterday who were desperate to be served in the sun, and the
chairs were stacked up against tables. They were completing inside
renovations and staff training for an official opening tomorrow. If
that's not a guarantee of a return to normal by midweek, then fortune is
really determined to shine down on us all.

JOHN REDWOOD at last spoke to the Prime Minister yesterday morning for
the first time in five crucial days. On a mobile phone he told Mr Major:
''I'm against you. I resign from your Cabinet. I'm going to fight.''
In this exchange the former Welsh Secretary made his bid to restore
Thatcherite ideology.
It appeared a bold opening. Nine hours later, there was the first
apparent gaffe.
One hundred Tory Party chairmen were angered late last night when Mr
Redwood ducked out of a television confrontation with them at the last
minute.
They had been brought to London from all over the country for a
special BBC Panorama programme to debate with Mr Redwood. They were told
to return home by a ''disappointed'' BBC: he would not be appearing.
The hard-line Redwood had earlier charmed the media at a Westminster
news conference.
At the conference, and subsequently among Tory MPs of all factions, he
was earning praise for having the guts to resign from Mr Major's Cabinet
and put his political career on the line. His withdrawal from Panorama
sets a different judgment on this, claims the Major campaign team.
Mr Redwood told the BBC on Sunday he was prepared to take part in the
special Panorama programme and, it is alleged, asked Tory Central Office
to help to organise the 100 constituency and regional party chairmen to
be brought to London at short notice.
Yesterday morning he confirmed he would take part; by six o'clock last
night the BBC was told Mr Redwood was changing his mind; and later
Panorama had to go out without him or the Tory chairmen.
Told that this debate was to be called off they dispersed in some
fury. The majority do not believe Mr Redwood should be challenging the
Prime Minister and would have told him so live on BBC television.
Mr Redwood chose instead to attend a Tory ''no turning back'' group
dinner and then to go on BBC Newsnight.
He explained his weekend turnaround from supporting Mr Major to
opposing him as an urgent issue of doing ''what is right for Britain and
the Conservative Party''.
Throughout the weekend the Major camp tried to contact Mr Redwood by
telephone and by fax and got no response until he made his phone call to
the Prime Minister at 9.30am.
Today he launches his alternative agenda: all the policy points he put
to the Prime Minister last Wednesday to rebuild support in Parliament
and in the country and believes were rejected by Mr Major.
Mr Redwood, 44, hinted yesterday what his first campaign pledge would
be. If he becomes leader, he said, he would never allow the
''abolition'' of the pound or let Britain join a single European
currency.
The rest of the Cabinet, including Mr Michael Heseltine and Mr Michael
Portillo, is standing firm with the Prime Minister at this stage.
Mr Heseltine reacted with even firmer support for Mr Major. Mr
Portillo was so consumed with fury by the action of the ''upstart''
Redwood in trying to steal his right-wing standard that he stayed
silent.
Last night at Westminster all factions were scurrying around to try to
work out how to handle this long-awaited fight for the soul of the Tory
Party. The immediate reaction of the Europhiles was to publish a
resolution from a 90-strong meeting declaring ''overwhelming support''
for the Prime Minister.
The Euro-sceptics also met, deciding nothing but to find a way of
supporting Mr Redwood without spoiling his chances. They await the
Redwood manifesto today.
The rest of the Tory Party is torn and bemused by the new dilemma they
face now since the brilliant Fellow of All Souls Oxford issued his
challenge.
In Cannes at the European Summit, Mr Major was defiant, insisting that
this straight-up one-to-one fight will convince the Tory Party that
there is no room for abstentions now. A clear victory will settle the
issue.
At the Commons last night it did not seem so simple to supporters of
Mr Portillo and Mr Heseltine. Both sides need abstentions to force a
second ballot for the leadership even if it means they have to grit
their teeth and vote for Mr Redwood. The Major camp advisers are certain
that the supporters of Mr Portillo still need to protect him from the
leadership for another couple of years or so.
They are already pointing to the calibre of Mr Redwood's support
attending him at his conference yesterday -- Mr Norman Lamont; Mrs
Teresa Gorman; Mr Edward Leigh; Mr Bill Walker; Mr David Evans; and Mr
Christopher Gill. They mock these people presenting as putative
Secretaries of State in a Redwood Cabinet.
When the former head of the Thatcher policy unit in Downing Street
launches his alternative manifesto today, this mocking will increase.
In a long resignation letter to the Prime Minister, Mr Redwood claims
he was ''devastated'' by the news that the Prime Minister last Thursday
had decided to resign the leadership, without telling him personally.
The Prime Minister responded with a very curt two sentence letter,
saying thank you and goodbye.
Mr Redwood, at his news conference, read from his resignation letter
to Mr Major in which he said he had voted for him as party leader in
1990 and had supported him continuously since.
He said he had been to see Mr Major last Wednesday when he had offered
the Prime Minister a number of ideas to rebuild support in Parliament
and in the country.
''I explained how this could calm the present position and probably
avoid any challenge in the autumn,'' he said
''You didn't hint at your intended course of action, nor did you tell
us at Cabinet on Thursday. When I finally heard of your plans from
another Minister I was devastated.
''Your decision to resign leaves our party in limbo when it needs firm
but understanding leadership. It makes a contest inevitable.''
In this contest, right wingers are worried that if Mr Redwood forces
the Prime Minister out and causes a second ballot their vote will be
split if Mr Portillo feels he has to intervene.
Heseltine supporters like this prospect but they find it very hard to
vote in the secret ballot for the man they regard as the Prince of
Darkness.

Phnom Penh, Monday
A FORMER Khmer Rouge guerrilla being held by Cambodian police today
confessed to the murders last year of three Westerners in the southern
province of Sihanoukville.
Chuon Samnang, 34, said six Khmer Rouge members had been responsible
for the killing of Australian Kellie Wilkinson, 24, her British
boyfriend, Dominic Chappell, 25, and their friend, Tina Dominy, 24, also
from Britain.
Asked if he was one of the executioners, Samnang, also known by his
nickname, Mean, replied: ''Yes.''
''I am very regretful, I am an uneducated man. I would have been shot
if I had refused the order,'' he said in a televised interview in
Sihanoukville prison.
Samnang said he was a nephew of Khmer Rouge commander Sem Bo of
regiment 27, based in the Bokor Mountain area.
Samnang said the three Westerners were shot in an early-morning
execution on April 12 last year.
They had been taken hostage a day earlier after their taxi was stopped
at a Khmer Rouge roadblock on southern Highway Four from Phnom Penh to
Sihanoukville.
Police chief Brigadier-General Tak Van Tha said Samnang had
co-operated with police and had been handed over to the provincial court
to face murder charges.
Samnang will face between 10 to 20 years in prison if found guilty,
but a court spokesman said his sentence could be reduced if he provided
information leading to the arrest of the other suspects.--Reuter.

Addis Ababa, Monday
EGYPTIAN President Hosni Mubarak survived an assassination bid
unscathed today when gunmen sprayed bullets at his armoured limousine
taking him to an African summit in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa.
Mubarak, 67, whose predecessor Anwar Sadat was gunned down in 1981,
flew back to Cairo after the attack, launched by at least five men on
the road from the airport to the Organisation of African Unity (OAU)
summit.
Ethiopia said the attackers were of Arab origin and that two were
killed. Two Ethiopian security agents were killed and one was wounded in
the attack.
Other gunmen and the driver of a van that intercepted Mubarak's
three-car motorcade fled.
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, who was in the motorcade, said
there were fewer than 10 assailants.
A delegate close to Egyptian officials said 12 bullets from AK-47
assault rifles hit Mubarak's car, which he brought from Egypt, but did
not penetrate the armour.
The Palestinian ambassador, who happened to be coming out of his
mission building, was hit in the foot.
Afterwards the road was stained with blood and littered with glass and
spent bullet cartridges.
No-one claimed responsibility for the assassination attempt although
the Vanguards of Conquest, a revival of the Jihad group that killed
Sadat, welcomed the attack and vowed to finish off the Egyptian leader
next time.
Muslim militants who was Egypt to become a strict Islamic state have
waged a low-level guerrilla war for three years.
Mubarak said after returning to Cairo that he suspected the attackers
had gone to Ethiopia to launch the attack, possibly from neighbouring
Sudan. Egypt has repeatedly accused Khartoum of sheltering its Muslim
militant foes.
Sudan, however, denied involvement. In a statement in Khartoum,
Minister of State at the Foreign Ministry Ghazi Salah al-Din Atabani
expressed deep regret over the attack.
In a vivid account, Mubarak said: ''I wasn't afraid at all because it
was an armoured car. The car windows were hit by one of the bullets,
which almost went through . . . it had no effect at all.
''I was cool all the time. There is a god and no-one is going to live
longer than he was given to live,'' he added.
Mubarak has already escaped at least two assassination plots since he
succeeded Sadat, but today's attack was by far the most sophisticated
and came closest to success.
As Mubarak's motorcade drove past the Palestinian mission, a Toyota
vehicle rammed into the car carrying Foreign Minister Moussa, which was
ahead of Mubarak's limousine.
''Two men with Kalashnikov rifles came out of the jeep in the middle
of the road and opened fire on the presidential limousine,'' said
Egyptian ambassador Said Refat.
''The presidential guard following in another vehicle jumped out of
their car and opened fire, killing two men.''
Mubarak recalled: ''Suddenly I found a blue van blocking the road and
also a man flat on the ground. A machine gun started . . . I can't tell
you exactly what nationality they were but they didn't look like
Ethiopians or blacks.''
It was not the first time that Mubarak has looked down the barrel of
an assassin's gun.
As vice-president in 1981, he was sitting next to Sadat at a military
parade when soldiers belonging to the Jihad movement attacked officials
sitting in the reviewing stand.
One of the attackers asked Mubarak to move away before spraying rifle
fire at Sadat. Mubarak was slightly wounded in the hand.--Reuter.

Washington, Monday
A KINDER, gentler Tim McVeigh appeared today, no longer the grim
bomber seen briefly two days after he allegedly killed 168 people in the
federal building in Oklahoma City.
His hair has grown a bit, he even smiles for the cameras, though with
difficulty.
He doesn't proclaim his innocence, either, instead saying: ''The only
way we can really answer that is that we are going to plead not
guilty.''
McVeigh gave his first on-the-record interview to Newsweek magazine.
His lawyer is frank on his reason for letting his client answer
questions by the press: the only image we had of McVeigh was a grim film
clip of the man in the orange prison uniform, surrounded by police,
hustled from a county jail to a waiting helicopter.
The lawyer wants to offer the alternative image, ''the boy next door.
A boy wonder''. The journalists who interviewed him said he seemed
''much more a typical Generation X-er than a deranged loner, much less a
terrorist. His handshake was firm, and he looked his visitors right in
the eye. He appeared a little nervous, maybe, but good-humoured and
self-aware. Normal.''
The lawyers also released a short, silent film clip, showing him
talking animatedly with them, and even laughing.
He offered nothing very new in the interview: the stilted reply to the
question of his guilt was clearly learned from the lawyers. He was
asked: ''You've got a chance right now to say ''Hell, no!' '' The reply
was: ''We can't do that.''
He tended to evade questions about his knowledge of explosives and
whether he had read some of the texts of the far-right militia movement.
He said the first time he heard about the bombing was from the policeman
who picked him up on a traffic violation 90 minutes afterwards.
He said he was horrified at the death of children in the bombing:
''It's a very tragic thing.''
The magazine quoted his lawyer, Stephen Jones, as saying that McVeigh
was innocent. Now Mr Jones says: ''I frankly don't remember saying that
he's innocent, and I do not think that is something I would have said.''
The dilemma of the lawyer defending a man he suspects may be guilty is
summed up in that comment.

Karachi, Monday
AT LEAST 22 people were killed in Karachi today and an ethnic faction
that has paralysed the Pakistani port for three days said it would stage
fresh protests until its demands were met.
Police said 22 people were killed in separate incidents in the city of
12 million.
They included five men whose bodies were found together in sacks in
the Saeedabad area. They had been kidnapped and tortured.
Normal life in the city came to a standstill on the third successive
''day of mourning'' called by the ethnic Mohajir National Movement
(MQM).
About 100 people have been killed in Pakistan's biggest city in the
past four days. At least 276 people have been killed this month and more
than 850 this year.
An MQM spokesman said there would be no protests tomorrow but more
anti-government days of action were planned.
''We will be holding such days of mourning every Friday and Saturday
until our demands are met,'' said the spokesman, Shoaib Bukhari.
The MQM says it is fighting what it sees as oppression of Karachi's
Mohajirs -- Urdu-speaking Muslims who fled from India at Partition in
1947 and their descendants.
The group has demanded the release of arrested party workers, the
arrest of the alleged rapists of an MQM activist's sister and the
killers of an MQM leader, and the recovery of two missing MQM workers.
The MQM's London-based leader Altaf Hussain, 41, said his people
wanted a separate province.
''A time may come when the MQM will have no alternative but to accept
the voice of the people for a separate province for Mohajirs,'' he
declared. ''If the genocide will continue, this demand may go further.''
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's government accuses the MQM of
instigating much of the trouble in Karachi and says it must lay down its
guns and renounce violence before any talks.
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, in a report released today,
urged the government to invite all parties to peace talks.
The city's usually bustling boulevards were deserted today. Shops,
banks, and businesses remained shut. Burned-out vehicles lay skewed
across main roads leading into strongholds of the MQM as police and
paramilitary forces kept a low profile.--Reuter.

San Francisco, Monday
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton praised the United Nations on its 50th birthday
today, and said the United States must not turn its back on the
beleaguered world body.
Clinton's speech, at a solemn ceremony marking the 50th anniversary of
the signing of the UN Charter in San Francisco, was a rebuff to
Republicans in Congress who are hostile to the 185-nation organisation.
''Turning our backs on the UN is no solution,'' Clinton said. ''It
would be short-sighted and self-destructive. It would strengthen the
forces of global disintegration.''
Clinton said the United States dared not reject decades of bipartisan
support for international co-operation. ''Those who would do so, these
new isolationists, dismiss 50 years of hard evidence,'' he said in a
warmly applauded speech.
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Polish President Lech Walesa,
and more than 150 ambassadors to the United Nations attended the
ceremony at San Francisco's Opera House, where delegates from 50
countries haggled over the text of the UN Charter in a nine-week
conference in 1945.
They were inspired by a dream of world peace after the bloodiest
conflict in history.
Clinton spoke from the same stage where President Harry Truman
addressed the UN's founding conference on June 26, 1945, as nervous
delegates signed the Charter in the Veterans Auditorium next door.
The United Nations celebrates its anniversary with its finances in
tatters and at a time when it is under fire for its inability to end the
Bosnian conflict, faces increasing hostility in the US Congress, and has
been criticised for bureaucracy and mismanagement.
Boutros-Ghali looked on the bright side today, pledging that the
United Nations would keep alive ''the dream of global co-operation''.
''As long as people seek national identities; as long as people seek
protection from aggression; and as long as people yearn for a better
world for their children, the United Nations will endure and it will
succeed,'' he said.
Clinton listed the achievements of the United Nations in helping
refugees, feeding the hungry, and brokering an end to 12 years of civil
war in El Salvador.
He added, however, the United Nations did not work as well as it
should and needed reform.
''We the member states must create a UN that is more flexible, that
operates more rapidly, that wastes less and produces more,'' he said.
Clinton won loud cheers from the audience when he pledged that ''as we
work together to improve the United Nations, I will continue to work to
see that the United States takes the lead in paying its fair share of
our common load''.
The United States is the UN's biggest debtor, owing $1.2bn (#800m) of
total unpaid assessments of $2.8bn (#1866m).
Clinton also called on the United Nations to strengthen efforts to
isolate ''states and people who traffic in terror''.
''We should quarantine the terrorists, terrorist groups, and the
nations that support terrorism,'' he said.--Reuter.

A #6.5m heritage project which will tell the story of the Clyde, its
ships and people has received the backing of Strathclyde Regional
Council.
The project, masterminded by the Clyde Maritime Trust, aims to
redevelop the Glasgow Garden Festival site and involves restoring the
1896 Clyde-built sailing barque, the Glenlee, and upgrading the Queens
Dock Pump House and former Anchor Line warehouse on the Clyde to provide
an exhibition and maritime heritage centre.
The council's policy and resources committee agreed yesterday to have
urgent talks with the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre to
clarify issues including land availability and parking at Yorkhill Quay.
The heritage centre has enjoyed early support from Glasgow District
Council, Glasgow Development Agency, and the private and public sectors,
but the formal backing of the region is viewed as its strongest card to
date.
The trust is applying for the #6.5m capital funding required to the
National Heritage Lottery Fund, the European Regional Development Fund,
and Glasgow Development Agency.

A 14-YEAR-OLD boy was being comforted by relatives yesterday after
finding his mother shot dead and his father with a fatal gunshot wound
at their home.
John Egerton called the ambulance and police after discovering his
mother Mrs Kathleen Egerton, 39, a former local councillor in Morecambe,
Lancashire, had been shot in the head with a self-loading pistol
belonging to her husband Philip, 47, said police.
Mr Egerton, who also had a gunshot wound to the head, was taken to
hospital in nearby Lancaster but died shortly afterwards.
Police said they were not seeking anyone in connection with Sunday
night's tragedy in Bare Avenue, Morecambe.
John Egerton was said to be severely shocked and was being cared for
by relatives and social workers yesterday.
Mrs Egerton was an independent councillor until the last local
government elections.
Lancashire police said the weapon found in the house was registered in
Mr Egerton's name.
Detective Inspector Neil Smith said: ''There is some evidence the
couple seemed to be having some matrimonial difficulties. But at the end
of the day we may never know how this happened.''
He said police were not looking for anyone and were working on the
theory that Mr Egerton shot his wife before turning the gun on himself.
Mr Smith said the couple's only son John was with a 13-year-old friend
in a room at the front of the house when they heard two shots at around
5.30pm and called the emergency services.
John was staying with relatives yesterday and was said to be seriously
traumatised. The two boys are to receive counselling over their ordeal.
Mr Smith said that he was not aware of any other person being involved
in the couple's problems. ''They seem to have been general domestic
difficulties,'' he added.
A former chiropodist, Mr Egerton was a member of a local gun club and
was licensed to use the small handgun with which he and his wife were
shot. Three other licensed weapons, all kept secure in accordance with
gun rules, were found in the house.
A post-mortem examination by Home Office pathologist Dr Edmund Tapp
confirmed the couple had both died from shots to the head.

RAIL workers are set to vote ''massively'' in favour of pay strikes,
signalling the prospect of another summer of chaos on the railways, it
was predicted yesterday.
Members of the Rail Maritime and Transport Union at British Rail and
London Underground are voting this week on whether to support a series
of 24-hour walkouts in protest at offers of 3% and 2.75% respectively.
RMT general secretary Mr Jimmy Knapp speaking yesterday, at his
union's annual conference in Swansea, said that he expected a massive
''yes'' vote.
''That would give us a mandate for strikes and we would have no
hesitation in taking action,'' he said.
However, Mr Knapp added that he hoped BR and London Underground would
agree to reopen negotiations.
Members of the train drivers' union Aslef are also voting on strikes
and look even more likely to return strike mandates. Aslef's first
result is expected next Monday and the corresponding RMT result will be
available the following Friday.
Aslef's executive decided yesterday that its London Underground ballot
would begin on July 5, with the result due on July 19.
Earlier yesterday Labour was urged to commit itself to a
publicly-owned rail system as Mr Don Loughlin, the RMT president,
attacked the ''mania'' of privatisation and emphasised that a
''cosmetic'' return of a privatised BR to the public sector would not be
enough.

Sarajevo
BOSNIAN Serbs launched fresh mortar attacks in and around Sarajevo
today, killing one man and wounding eight, including two French
peacekeepers.
The civilian casualties occurred when at least three mortar bombs
landed near the Roman Catholic cathedral in the city centre.
The two peacekeepers were wounded in separate incidents after being
targeted by Serb forces surrounding the city, said a UN spokesman.
Fighting in the Bosnian capital has returned to levels not seen since
the worst days of the city's 38-month-old siege. Nine people were killed
in shelling and sniper fire yesterday, five of them children. Police
said 30 people were wounded.
And Government and Serb forces fought a fierce artillery duel around
Srebrenica today, the heaviest exchange of shells that eastern
government enclave has seen this year.
As the violence worsened, EU leaders gathered in the French resort of
Cannes to hear EU peace envoy Carl Bildt present conclusions after his
first trip to the Balkans.
France puzzled its EU partners by saying President Jacques Chirac
would present an ''action plan'' for Bosnia at the summit, but Chirac's
spokeswoman later played down expectations of a radical new initiative.
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl was expected to brief the summit on his
Cabinet's decision, subject to parliamentary approval, to commit Tornado
fighter planes to support the UN peacekeeping force.
* An advance party of 100 logistic experts has been in Bosnia since
last week preparing for a big deployment of British forces, Defence
Secretary Malcolm Rifkind revealed.
He said the support troops were sent to prepare for a 4000-strong
force which will be in place by the end of next month.
Meanwhile, the US announced that within days it will send its latest
unmanned hi-tech spyplanes over Bosnia to gather intelligence for Nato
peacekeeping forces there.
A system of ''Predator'' unmanned aircraft, which gather data under
remote control from the ground, will be sent to Albania by next week.
The move follows the shooting down of a US jet fighter by a Serbian
missile over northern Bosnia last month.--Reuter.

THE odds on John Redwood leading the Conservative Party into the next
election last night dropped from 25-1 to 10-1, as bookmakers predicted a
stiff challenge for John Major.
William Hill shortened the odds after the former Welsh Secretary
announced his decision to stand in the leadership battle.
Hill's spokesman Mr Graham Sharpe said they had taken #5000-worth of
bets within the first hour of his announcement.
He predicted that Mr Redwood's entry into the contest would spark a
#1m betting turnover.
Mr Major is the 4-5 favourite, with Michael Heseltine at 2-1 and
Michael Portillo at 5-1.

for a half-day ticket (lunch included) to #112 for the full week
(five-week season ticket, #480).
Kings Sports Camps, a Sheffield based charitable organisation (Tel:
0114 267 0800) set up in business five years ago and now operates from
18 centres in 14 cities throughout the UK (14,000 children attended last
year) including Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Dundee (Aberdeen next year). In
Glasgow there are camps at Jordanhill College and St Andrews College,
Bearsden, where up to 600 children, aged five to 13 years, will take
part in all manner of sport from 10am to 4pm, Monday to Friday, for
between one and three weeks during July (#49 per week).
Kids College, set up by Anniesland College (Tel: Pauline 0141 357
3969, extension 158) last year, runs Monday to Friday, 9.30am to 4.30pm,
for a five-week period between July 3 and August 11. Seven to
13-year-olds (5-7-year-olds may also be considered) choose from
swimming, sports, team games, arts and crafts for five half-days, #25;
five full days, #45 (lunch included), or one full day, #9. (Other
community education colleges may also be running schemes.)
The YWCA in Glasgow (Tel: Donna Calder 0141 248 5338) has been running
a summer activity scheme for children aged four to 14 for more than a
decade. At #25 for five days, 8.45am to 6pm, it's probably the best deal
in town. The scheme is based at Anderston Church in Elderslie Street and
as well as the usual programme of arts, crafts, and games, there is a
trip outside the city every week plus numerous minor excursions to
swimming-pools, museums etc.
Enterprising parents at Hyndland Primary School (Tel: Fiona 0141 339
9526 between 2.30pm and 6.00pm weekdays or call in at the school) set up
their own playscheme last summer but it's open to all
primary-school-aged children throughout the city who are fully
supervised in the playground, gym, dining-hall, etc. Daily sessions
which run from 8.30am to 6pm, are #10 with reductions for single parents
(half-days possible).
Check with your local schools to see if they offer a similar service.
Wellington Church in the West End of Glasgow has run a free summer
playscheme for local children aged five to 14 for the past 10 years. It
takes place during the last week of the holidays and is based in the
church hall during the morning and, weather permitting, in a nearby park
for the afternoon sessions.
Said an organiser: ''Our activities centre around a different theme
each year and although we certainly don't Bible-thump, the emphasis is
on Christianity. Above all, however, we want the children to have fun.''
Many churches, as well as community centres, throughout Scotland also
organise summer playschemes, she added, some lasting for as long as a
month or more.
Glasgow District Council's parks and recreation department, in common
with many other local authorities, offers a special programme of
development, coaching, and come-and-try sessions for a wide variety of
sports during the summer holidays for the five-to-16 age group. Check
your nearest sports or leisure facility for details (not forgetting the
privately run centres).
The Scottish Football Association (Tel: 0141 332 6372) runs soccer
weeks throughout the country during the summer for boys and girls aged
eight to 14 years. In the Glasgow area they are at Jordanhill College
and Mearns Castle High School from July 10 to 14 and August 7 to 11.
Cost for a week, Monday to Friday, from 10am to 3pm, is #45.
Horse-mad teenagers aged 16 and over can go pony trekking minus
parents with the Scottish Youth Hostels Association (Tel: Head Office in
Stirling, 01786 451 181) near Hawick. #59 for two nights, #107 for five.
Glasgow School of Art (Tel: 0141 353 4515) is offering a series of six
Saturday-morning classes (10am to noon) for keen youngsters aged 10 to
16, for #25, starting on July 8 and finishing on August 12. Check other
colleges and universities for their summer courses.

The summer holidays stretch ahead -- a dream come true for youngsters
but a nightmare for the unprepared parent. Is it possible for families
to survive intact until August? Yes, says Andrew Popple, armed with a
survival plan he prepared earlier.
IT'S easy. Sit them down in front of the video, throw them packets of
crisps occasionally, and eight weeks or so later -- it's over. They're
back to school and life can return to normal. One snag -- we don't have
a video. Can they pull the tape out of the cassette and hold it up to
the light? Winding it back in again sounds a nightmare. Anyway, I tend
to think they deserve better than that. Perhaps we should think this one
out a bit further.
As a newcomer to this looking-after-the-children lark, it strikes me
that we've got to get a balance between what they want to do, what I
want to do, and how far the finances will stretch. All the while bearing
in mind practicalities like the weather.
Our lot are showing definite signs of being ready for a break, so to
start with we will take it easy, let them recover. That takes us to
10.30 on the first morning. Only seven weeks, four-and-three-quarter
days to go.
For a chosen few, the rest of the holiday will fall naturally into
place. For mere mortals like me, the thing to do is to plan just a
little, based on what your children like doing. Especially if they have
different tastes, every day will be something of a compromise. So make
sure they each get an enjoyable bit. And don't do all the most exciting
things in the first few days, because the rest of the holiday will risk
going downhill.
I've tried to think of a variety of things to do, places to go --
getting a blend of old favourites and new experiences. No doubt a lot of
these ideas will never get done, and others will be done to death. You
will have to make up your own plans, and there are many things to do
nearby, wherever you are. Take what follows as just a flavour of what's
about.
I've two relatively outdoorsy children, and no doubt we will be
finding new walks and bike rides. Picnics are likely to figure high on
the list. My eight-year-old is ace at picnics. A couple of years ago we
set off for a walk, she having insisted on carrying her own backpack.
When we stopped for a break, out came a plastic bag -- ''the ground may
be wet, it's to sit on''. Then we were all offered a choice of snacks
and juices. She even had a second bag for the rubbish.
There are plenty of country parks and the like around, all big enough
so you can't say you've ''done'' them on a single visit. Most have safe,
accessible routes for wheelchairs, prams, and pushchairs. The newly
published series of ''25 Walks'' books from HMSO -- or your local
library, another really good place to explore -- covers Glasgow, The
Trossachs, Edinburgh and Lothians, and Highland Perthshire, with others
on the way.
They are good, and up-to-date -- an instruction ''turn left at the end
of the forest'' is not a lot of use if the Forestry Commission cut it
down a year or so ago. You will find some good ideas for places that
children can explore, without having to aim at the official objective.
All of the starting points mentioned are accessible by public transport,
while it still exists.
Then there are the gardens and country houses. Again, you have to
balance your interests and those of the children -- not a lot of six or
eight-year-olds can take an extended tour of some mansion, but will find
more to interest them in the likes of Braemar Castle, with its circular
stair and places to explore. A trip to Brodick fills an entire day, with
the ferry rides an added bonus.
Variety is all. Bell's Cherrybank Gardens in Perth is much more
extensive and interesting than I had imagined. After the first million
or so heather beds I was ready to give in until we came across the
ponds, an aviary, and so on. It has a reasonably good children's
playground, too. If you miss the signposted route, you pass the Bell's
main entrance -- chief attraction: the staff having a quick drag outside
their presumably no-smoking offices.
But entry to houses and gardens is typically not cheap, and on top of
that you are likely to buy snacks and/or lunches. Plan to get best value
for money. And make sure of opening times before you go -- at certain
places, the House of Dun, for instance, everything seems to open and
close at different times this year.
Given the unlikely event of inclement weather - you have to be an
optimist s- s there are still lots of places to go. That great standby,
the Transport Museum, is best visited, perversely, in good weather --
it's less likely to be mobbed. We recently discovered the Hunterian at
Glasgow University. This was during exam time and we were warned that we
may see students sobbing quietly in corners, but that this was quite
normal and we should not disturb them. Hopefully that season now has
passed.
Scotland has lots of galleries, museums, castles, re-created villages,
and exhibitions, and it's up to the likes of you and me to use them.
Many are pitched primarily to entertain: they educate in a subliminal
way. Ideal for planting the seeds of interest in young minds.
In among all this healthy and cultural stuff we will no doubt be going
to the seaside, to the cinema, not to mention the pool and probably
roller-skating too. A spot of putting in St Andrews always goes down
well. We have a stock of jigsaws and games for the ''can't be bothered''
times: Monopoly can cause family strife, but Uno and Sorry are
reasonably safe. And I hope they will pick up the occasional book, so at
least they remember how to read when they go back to school.
Hopefully friends will come to play, and ours will be invited out too.
Granny and Grandpa might feel brave enough to have their grandchildren
(it works better if you put it that way) for a few days. Before we know
it the new term will be upon us, and there will be lots left on the To
Do list. So we will have plenty of ''new'' ideas ready for the next
year. Gulp.

IT WAS clear after about 10 minutes of John Redwood's resignation news
conference that, if we were not watching the next Prime Minister we were
certainly watching the emergence of the political Son of Thatcher.
The ideological certainty, clarity of expression and assured
self-confidence were all there, minus the occasional shrillness and
plus, perhaps most surprising of all, a pleasant sense of humour which,
if the Baroness has, she never much indulges in public life.
Of course, any Cabinet member who chose to resign to fight the Prime
Minister could command the scrum of cameras and journalists that packed
into the considerably too small Jubilee Room off Westminster Hall. The
harder test is to look a credible challenger rather than a stalking
horse out to test the waters for others.
Mr Redwood passed it with aplomb. He fielded questions smoothly and
cleverly. It was clearly not ridiculous to imagine him as party leader
or Prime Minister, something which could not be said of Mr Norman Lamont
beside him or several members of the present Cabinet.
Perhaps the only tactical mistake was the line-up behind him of early
supporters. Heavily Euro-sceptical, its most striking feature was an
amazing blazer which looked as if tailored from Joseph's Amazing
Technicolour Dreamcoat, worn by Mr Tony Marlow (Northampton North) which
achieved the improbable feat of overshadowing the outfit of Mrs Teresa
Gorman (Billericay).
In case anyone should think this is going to be a sporting contest, we
record the reaction from Mr Major's Cowley Street HQ after scanning the
pictures -- ''Ward eight at Broadmoor.'' What with ''bastards,''
''Eurocrap'' and ''spitting in the centre of the pitch,'' raising the
tone of political debate can hardly be in the Prime Minister's election
manifesto.
On the whole, everything went off well. Fortunately, the truculent Mr
Bruce Anderson and Mr Lamont, once colleagues in the first Major
leadership campaign, were well apart when the former accused the latter
of saying Mr Redwood was ''no politician.'' The latter denied it. The
former persisted.
Mr Redwood neatly blamed his challenge on the Prime Minister who, he
said, had jeopardised the position of the party by resigning the
leadership. Could any journalist he had spoken to recall any disloyal
words while he had been in government? A query one has to be pretty sure
of oneself and have a good memory to make.
He would never abolish the pound, he promised. A little more quietly,
he said he had no plans for Britain to leave the European Union.
But more important than Europe, had he a sense of humour? Did they
hurt when he was called the Vulcan and other nicknames? No, he said,
smiling, as he frequently did to show that he can do that as well as
think, no, they didn't. ''And I can now see the joke though, as you
know, it took quite a long time.''
What support did he have? He wouldn't offer dodgy figures, he said, or
accurate figures either, because in this election there weren't such
things. He had not given any personal pledges to Cabinet colleagues that
he would not run, he said, tackling his hardest personal question
head-on.
He put across his ''man of ideas'' pitch. He had put various ones to
Mr Major only six days ago. He didn't say so, but one was left with the
impression that minds had not met.
When the Home Secretary told him Mr Major had decided to bring the
leadership election forward, he told Mr Howard he thought it ''a very
dangerous thing to do.'' Mr Major, a little belatedly may be coming
round to that view too.
As all candidates must, he acknowledged that the party was a broad
church and he would want all schools of thought in his Cabinet, provided
-- and a glint of Thatcher steel showed -- they agreed with the
principles for the Government he had set out.
Mr Blair was ''perpetrating a fraud'' on his party and the British
people and should be exposed.
It was a vivid performance benefiting from the rather unflattering
personal profiles of him which most of his audience had either read or
written.
If Mr Major perhaps received the Thatcher legacy by default and Mr
Portillo has been tardy in claiming it, it looked yesterday as if the
true heir has turned up to demand his inheritance.

HUNDREDS of friends attended the funeral yesterday of Lord Hugh
Douglas-Hamilton, who died of a suspected heart attack at his home in
East Lothian last week. He was 48.
Lord Hugh, brother of the Duke of Hamilton and of Scottish Office
Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, was buried in the thirteenth
century Bolton Kirkyard, near Haddington.
The countryside ceremony followed a Requiem Mass at Our Lady of
Loretto and St Michael's Roman Catholic Church, Musselburgh, attend by
almost 500 mourners.
The grave of Lord Hugh -- a poet, author, and historian who loved
Scotland and was a staunch SNP supporter -- was set in a quiet corner of
the churchyard where Robert Burns's mother, brother, and sister are
buried.
In bright sunshine, Lord Hugh's son by his first marriage, Brendan,
20, and his brothers, the Duke of Hamilton, 56, Lords James, 53,
Patrick, 45, and David Douglas-Hamilton, 43, took the eight cords with
family friends.
Lord Hugh's widow, Sheilagh, stood comforted by his mother, Elizabeth,
Duchess of Hamilton, 79, and his daughter by his first marriage, Kitty,
19.
Among 250 other mourners at Bolton were his first wife, Lady June
Douglas-Hamilton, and Sir Hew Hamilton Dalrymple, Lord Lieutenant of
East Lothian.
Lord Hugh died at his home at Begbie Farmhouse, Haddington, last
Wednesday, with his wife, whom he secretly married in London just over a
year ago, was at his side.

A NUN, who is one of America's foremost campaigners against the death
penalty, is to receive an honorary law degree from the University of
Glasgow next month.
Sister Helen Prejean, 56, is known for her work in befriending
murderers and counselling the families of their victims. She has been
present at the execution of three prisoners in her capacity as their
spiritual advisor. Her book about her experience, Dead Men Walking, has
been nominated for a Pulitzer prize.
Sister Prejean makes regular visits to the university to address
students. Dr Pat Lucie, a Glasgow university law lecturer, said: ''She
has achieved an incredible understanding of the legal process for a lay
person but combines this with a spiritual dimension, not appropriate to
lawyers, and a great humane capacity.''
Twelve law students due to graduate on the same day are to fly to the
US with the nun to work with death row prisoners. The William Brennan
Scholarships involve students gathering mitigating evidence for
condemned prisoners which may have been overlooked in trials.
Dr Lucie said: ''Scottish law firms found the experience was of
immense benefit to the graduates who went last year. If they can go into
a death row prison alone and gather information from inmates face to
face, they can handle any interview situation they might encounter as
lawyers at home.''

A CHURCH report has called for all young drug users, and not just
registered addicts, to be entitled to prescriptions for drugs from their
doctors.
It says such a policy could be incorporated into the National Health
Service.
The study, prepared by the division of social responsibility to the
Methodist Church Conference in Bristol, won backing from one its leaders
in Scotland. It says: ''Instead of impure drugs being bought on the
streets in an environment of crime, prostitution, and social exclusion,
drugs could be under medical control, with the prospect of hopeful
change.''
The report urges church members to gain more ''street credibility'' by
working with more people who are heavily dependent on drugs and calls
for open and informed debate on all substances of abuse.
''At present there are 10 times more deaths from alcohol-induced
disease than from illegal drugs, and smoking-related deaths are many
times more common still,'' it says.
Calling for ''comprehensive treatment services'' for drug users, the
report adds: ''At the core of treatment services must be a sensible
prescribing policy, which needs to be incorporated into the NHS and
become available through GPs.''
At the moment, only registered drug addicts can get certain drugs on
prescription.
Speaking from the conference, Mr Alan Anderson, chairman of the
Methodist Church Synod in Scotland, supported the idea in principle and
said the report encouraged members to think that such a move ought to be
considered.
''Our concern is that we simply should not leave people to the mercy
of what can be a very unhappy and unlawful situation. The report gives
us encouragement to think more deeply about how to deal with this
situation.
''We have to care for those who are the drug users and it might be
that, as an interim measure in order to help them cope with their
problem, provision should be made as it is already for other drugs such
as morphine substitutes.''
He said such a system ''would be better than being at the mercy of a
profit-driven market with illicit drugs being sold on the streets''.
The report is being sent to branches of the church throughout the UK
for discussion.

A FIRST glance at charitable bank balances would suggest that Scots
love their cats more than their kids. In 1993 the Scottish Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals raised more than #4.2m. The
children's counterpart, RSSPCC, mustered only #1.8m.
The new look and name for the ''cruelty'', Children 1st, was launched
in March, and now aims to equal the RSPCA contributions.
It is hoped that a series of hard-hitting newspaper advertisments will
put the children's charity back in the apple of the public's eye. The
potent images have been designed by Fauld's Advertising. In one image a
little girl holds her cuddly rabbit and stares at the camera. The adline
runs: ''If you only give money to animals: she's been treated like one
all her life.''
The truth often hurts.
A recent report by the NSPCC said that one in six adults had been a
victim of sexual assault and that more than 50% did not tell anyone at
the time of the abuse. The survey of 1032 adults reported that 168 (16%)
said abuse had taken place. In Scotland one in eight children suffer
some form of cruelty such as neglect, emotional, physical, and sexual.
The adverts are set to run from September in a comprehensive campaign
which could cost #400,000 but which should raise #4m for the charity
within the first 15 months. Donations will go towards creating new
family-resource centres. Five currently operate with a sixth being
planned for either Grampian or Dumfries and Galloway.
The charity's campaign director is James Tysoe who masterminded the
campaign which raised #11.8m for the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in
Edinburgh. He said that recent research showed that people were
uncomfortable with the subject of child abuse.
''People just don't really want to acknowledge cruelty in that detail.
The justification for the society's existence is that cruelty and abuse
do exist.
''We have to draw people's attention in as powerful a way as we can.
It's really trying to alert people to the fact that tragically there are
children here in Scotland who are literally treated not like, but worse
than, animals.''
Currently influential Scots are being targeted by mailing leaflets and
information sheets and the major push -- highlighting the aims of
preventing abuse from occurring and keeping the family together --
begins in eight weeks' time.
''We don't make any apologies for emphasising the primacy of
preventing cruelty to children,'' said Mr Tysoe. ''The reality is that
in today's charity market you have really got to say to people: 'Hey!
This is a significant issue, we need your help, something has got to be
done.' That is why we have gone for a fairly strong approach.''
It was a Glaswegian accountant, James Grahame, who founded what would
become The Royal Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children after visiting New York in the 1880s. There he discovered that
while there was no society charged with child care, a society to protect
animals had existed for 50 years.
Douglas Turner, Children 1st's press officer, said: ''It's not to say
that we wish people not to contribute to animal charities and we would
never like to see any animal maltreated, but nothing is more important
than the welfare and protection of our children. They are our future.''
* Donations to Children's 1st can be sent to 41 Polwarth Terrace,
Edinburgh EH11 1NU.

AS a 14-year-old boy was recovering in hospital after being stabbed in
Hamilton on Sunday, his mother yesterday claimed it was part of a
vendetta being waged against her family.
Billy Mair was stabbed in the stomach in the town's Whitehill area,
after being approached by three youths as he made his way home from
Strathclyde Park with a friend, Lisa McDade, and her seven-year-old
sister, Ann.
Billy was carrying Ann on his shoulders when they were approached by
the youths who shouted to him: ''You're going to get stabbed.''
The boy, who has collected numerous footballing medals and trophies,
was taken to Hairmyres Hospital East Kilbride, where he underwent
emergency surgery. Surgeons said that only his youth and fitnesses saved
him after he lost several pints of blood.
Last night, an unnamed witness to the attack said: ''The three told
Billy he was going to get stabbed whether he put wee Ann down or not.
''We screamed at him not to put her down because we knew what they
would do.
''But then one of them shoved her off his shoulders and they just
stabbed him there and then. It was a horrific thing to see. He was not
wearing a top because of the weather.
''One of them even tried to stab him in the back.''
''Lisa was hysterical. She started knocking on doors begging people to
telephone for an amublance.''
Mrs Maureen Mair, 34, was last night being comforted by family friends
at her home in Donaldson Street, Hamilton.
She said: ''We know who did this.
''Our family is being attacked all the time because of a vendetta.
''We have had concrete slabs coming through the windows.
''But this is the final straw. My son came very close to dying because
of these thugs.''
Billy was last night taken off the danger list in hospital, but Mrs
Mair said: ''We don't know if he will make a full recovery.''

<HEADLINE>Maxwell trial told of #400m offer</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>977682668</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
AN unknown Israeli investor was prepared to inject up to #400m into Mr
Robert Maxwell's companies after his death at sea, an Old Bailey jury
heard yesterday.
Mr Ron Woods, a tax adviser, said that Mr Kevin Maxwell had asked him
to draw up a detailed structure of the scheme days after his father's
death, making it as attractive as possible.
Mr Woods said the investor, who was unidentified and about whom he
knew no details, was going to get a 20% return. If the money was not
repaid, he would be able to hold up to 75% of the equity.
The jury has heard that the Maxwell empire collapsed before this new
investment came to fruition. Mr Woods was giving evidence in the fifth
week of the trial of Mr Kevin Maxwell, 36, Mr Ian Maxwell, 39, and two
former financial advisers, Mr Larry Trachtenberg, 42, and Mr Robert
Bunn, 47.
All four deny conspiracy to defraud beneficiaries and trustees of the
pension funds by dishonestly using #22m worth of shares in Teva, an
Israeli company, in a bid to prop up the crumbling Maxwell Group after
Robert Maxwell's death in November, 1991. Mr Kevin Maxwell alone denies
conspiring with his father to misuse #100m worth of shares in another
Israeli company, Scitex, to pay private Maxwell company debts.
Mr Woods, a former tax inspector, said he joined the Maxwell
Communication Corporation and private Maxwell companies to advise on tax
matters.
Cross-examined by Mr Alun Jones, QC, for Mr Kevin Maxwell, he agreed
he advised that the sale of the Scitex shares should be routed through
various companies within the group to minimise tax liability.
Mr Woods also described how a #300m debt disappeared overnight from
the Mirror Group's balance sheet before it was publicly floated.
He said this was achieved by selling ''valuable'' titles of newspapers
within the Mirror Group to another company, thereby wiping out the debt.
It was ''lawful financial engineering''. The trial continues.

THE Labour-controlled Strathclyde Regional Council came under strong
attack yesterday for failing to instruct its pension fund managers to
support the campaign to sack the British Gas board following the
controversial 75% wage increase awarded to chief executive Cedric Brown.
As part of a broadside aimed at the big pension funds, Scottish
National Party leader Alex Salmond claimed that the region's reluctance
to advise the fund managers ahead of the company's annual meeting last
month helped to keep its directors in a job.
He said that the British Gas chairman Richard Giordano produced
millions of proxy votes at the meeting from major pension managers,
including those controlled by Strathclyde's #3400m fund, after furious
shareholders voted to sack five directors, including Mr Brown.
The SNP leader ridiculed the Labour group's ''naivety and
incompetence'' for failing to follow the examples of other regional
councils in realising the ''sensitive issue'' in which they had a major
holding. He said Strathclyde was ''at best slow to move, and at worst
neglected its duties''.
His comments were immediately rebutted by the Labour group leader,
Councillor Bob Gould, who denied that the matter was an
''embarrassment'' for the council.
He accused Mr Salmond of having ''little else to occupy himself with''
by choosing to focus on the matter and said that ''neither the SNP
leader nor anyone else'' had the right to play ''political football''
with someone else's pension.
Mr Salmond told a news conference in Glasgow that instead of telling
its fund managers to vote with rebel shareholders to oust the directors
at the meeting, Strathclyde region effectively backed ''corporate
greed''.
He argued that Grampian and Central regions had instructed their fund
managers to vote with rebel shareholders in trying to change the
direction of British Gas while other regions, who had no shareholding,
said they would have been sympathetic to the campaign.
The opposing resolutions included a demand to have a consultative
committee on the board, composed of small shareholders and members of
staff, and an attack on salary increases -- including the near 75%
increase given to Mr Brown which took his total salary and benefits in
the past year to #492,602.
Mr Salmond highlighted the ''appalling'' handling of the matter by the
fund managers and said it amounted to ''hypocrisy'' given the attack
earlier this month by Labour's consumer affairs spokesman Nigel
Griffiths on pension funds that did not take account of members' wishes.
The SNP leader said: ''I suspect among the 57,000 pensioners
represented by the Strathclyde pension fund you would be lucky to get
into double figures those who supported the salary increase of Cedric
Brown.
''Yet their votes and their voice were cast undemocratically by the
fund managers against the wishes of the small shareholders at the agm.''
He went on: ''The Labour group have abdicated themselves from all
responsibility and allowed their fund managers to thwart the wishes of
their shareholders and most of the people of Scotland.
''Without a full disclosure of how pension funds vote at meetings like
the British Gas agm we will never have proper shareholder democracy.''
Councillor Sandy MacQueen, secretary of the SNP group in Strathclyde,
argued that the local authority should take its business elsewhere if
the fund managers could not vote in line with the wishes of its members.
Councillor Gould said: ''Neither Alex Salmond or anyone else has got
the right to play political football with someone else's pension. If he
wants any change in pension fund legislation he should do it through
Parliament.''
The council leader said he also held grave concerns about the 75%
salary increase awarded to Mr Brown. However, he added, ''If you take
this argument to a logical conclusion then the market-led pension funds
would not be able to invest anywhere.''

Kvaerner Govan shipbuilders,
the last major yard on the upper Clyde, has secured a new #10m order.
The Norwegian-owned yard fought off intense foreign competition for
the contract to build a 6150-ton oil products carrier for a subsidiary
of the British ship-owning group, Giles Pritchard-Gordon.
Mr Kjell Mikalsen, managing director of Kvaerner Govan, said the order
would provide ''much needed continuity of work during the second half of
this year while other major projects are still under discussion''.
Mr Giles Pritchard-Gordon expressed his delight that the order had
been won by a British yard, enabling his group to maintain its record of
support for the UK shipbuilding industry.
The deal is the second contract won by Kvaerner Govan this year. In
March, the yard, which employs 1400 workers, won a #12m order to build a
platform supply vessel for shipowners Harrisons (Clyde) Ltd.
Production director John Dunlop said that, on top of work on a
helicopter carrier and the platform supply vessel, the new order would
give the yard vital steel work until the end of the year.
The announcement of the latest deal came just four days after Kvaerner
Govan confirmed three key managerial staff had left the company. It
refused to give reasons, but the move was thought to be linked to the
yard's failure to achieve productivity objectives.

ARAB, Israeli, and world leaders have condemned yesterday's
assassination attempt on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
Mr Mubarak was unhurt when gunmen sprayed bullets at his armoured
limousine taking him to an African summit in the Ethiopian capital Addis
Ababa.
Egypt's outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, a moderate Islamic fundamentalist
group, also sent messages of support to Mr Mubarak, who flew back to
Cairo.
Mr Major, President Bill Clinton, and French President Jacques Chirac
were among the leaders who expressed their outrage and sent messages.
The support from the Arab world ranged from King Fahd of Saudi Arabia
to Colonel Gaddafi of Libya.
The 22-member Arab League described it as a ''treacherous attack''.
Ethiopia said the would-be assassins were of Arab origin. A foreign
ministry statement said two of the gunmen were killed. It said two
Ethiopian security agents were also killed and one was wounded.
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin congratulated Mubarak for
surviving ''a dastardly and murderous attempt on his life'' and hinted
Iran could have had a hand in the attack. He said the extremist Islamic
wave, backed by Iran, was the main enemy to stability in the Middle
East.
In Gaza, PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat said the attempt was a ''terrorist
and criminal act''.
Muslim militants have waged a three-year campaign of violence to try
to overthrow Egypt's secular government and replace it with strict
Islamic rule.

A MOTHER and her two young daughters were murdered yesterday when a
fireball ripped through their terraced house after a massive blast,
police said.
The victims were named as Mrs Susan Lowell, 24, who was thought to be
pregnant, and her daughters Kylie, six, and Julie-Anne, four.
Neighbours heard an explosion and raised the alarm as flames leapt
through the roof of the home in Preston Road, Abingdon, Oxfordshire.
Police said a man of 24, arrested in connection with the blaze, was
being questioned at Abingdon, after treatment for minor burns at
Oxford's John Radcliffe Hospital. He gave himself up to police.
Neighbours said the children had a live-in child-minder who answered
an advertisement in the local newsagent's shop. Friends said he was not
romantically involved with Mrs Lowell, who had been married twice.
The fire was being treated as a triple murder, said a Thames Valley
Police spokesman. No charges have yet been brought against the man
police are interviewing.
Mrs Lowell's father Mr John Foulsham said he was devastated to lose
his daughter and grandchildren: ''It is hard for us to accept that
someone may have deliberately wiped out a whole family,'' he added.
As forensic experts picked their way through the charred debris,
neighbour Ms Angela Powell said: ''There was a huge bang which I thought
was thunder. Then everything was lit up orange and we heard screams.''
The mother-of-two, who lives two doors away, said: ''Flames were
coming out of the front of the house and smoke was billowing out of the
back.
''Just a matter of seconds after the explosion the house was
completely gone.''
Firefighters recovered the bodies from the blackened shell of the
house. It was the second time the family's home had been burned to the
ground.
Three years ago, when they were living in Ock Street, Abingdon, Kylie
lit a gas fire while her mother, who worked selling flowers in pubs and
clubs, slept nearby. The family had to be rescued by neighbours.
Mr Foulsham said Kylie's father, Mr Robert Roberts, who never married
Mrs Lowell, died in a tragic accident in 1990, when he drowned in the
River Ock at Abingdon.
She then married Mr Robert Lowell, father of Julie-Anne, but they
later divorced, and she married a local man called Mick, but that
relationship broke down soon afterwards.
Neighbours said the two girls had been in care and were ''underfed and
neglected''.
Mrs Foulsham said her daughter was ''an intelligent girl, but always
had problems with relationships'', and had been dogged by problems since
she was a teenager.
She suffered from diabetes and epilepsy and had problems looking after
her daughters. They were taken into care for a short time after the fire
at her previous home.
Oxfordshire County Council disclosed that it had been involved with
the tragic family, but closed the case last year. Director of Social
Services Ian White said Susan Lowell, who once worked as an Avon
representative, had appeared to be managing much better.

<HEADLINE>Nine regional offices to be hit as ScottishPower centralises customer services operation. 350 jobs go in electricity shake-up</HEADLINE>

SCOTTISHPOWER is to cut 350 jobs as it centralises its customer
services operation in a bid to ''increase efficiency'', the company
announced yesterday.
Union leaders said they were ''appalled'' by this latest example of
large numbers of jobs being shed in previously public-sector
organisations.
The decision to establish a new customer services centre at the
company's Cathcart business centre in Glasgow will affect staff at nine
regional offices. It is understood the biggest impact will be on offices
covering Ayrshire, Fife, the Borders, and Dumfries and Galloway. Part of
the strategy behind the shake-up seems to be ScottishPower's desire to
take full advantage of opportunities presented by the deregulation of
the power supply industry, including markets south of the Border.
The company, which has about 8000 staff, said yesterday customer
service employees in the local offices would be considered for positions
in the new centre, and it was confident the required job losses could be
achieved through voluntary measures. All nine offices would remain open
to provide local facilities for debt counselling, cash collection, and
community relations.
The company said the centralisation would provide ''a faster and more
direct service for more than 1.7 million customers in Scotland and the
capability to serve customers throughout the rest of the UK''.
A multi-million pound investment would be made at the Cathcart centre
where some 500 staff would use the latest technology to handle three
million customer telephone calls a year. The new centre would be
developed in phases starting in January next year and becoming fully
operational six months later.
The re-organisation includes the formation of an energy supply
business, under managing director Mr Bill Landels, to administer
customer sales and services and to develop new markets.
Mr Landels said: ''ScottishPower is committed to delivering the
highest level of customer service. By introducing a 'one-stop shop' for
our electricity and gas customers, we will be able to offer a faster,
more efficient, and more personal service.
''We want to continue to improve our communications and service
levels. From benchmarking against world-class organisations for best
practices, we are convinced that the most efficient way to achieve this
is through an integrated customer operation using the latest
technology.''
News of the jobs cut was greeted with dismay by Mr Matt Smith,
Scottish secretary of the Unison union. He said: ''We are appalled that,
once again, decent jobs are being cut in areas which were formerly in
the public sector. The situation is becoming critical. One wonders when
it is going to stop.''
Ms Rosetta Fitzpatrick, secretary of Unison's Scottish electricity
branch, said: ''We are obviously concerned about the job losses,
especially in the outlying areas. The hardest hit will probably be areas
like the Borders and Fife. Both Unison and the company hope the
reduction in jobs can be achieved through the existing voluntary
severance scheme.''
There were many details which the union would be discussing with the
company, including relocation packages for staff who decided to move to
the new centre.
Other aspects of the re-organisation include the electricity network,
comprising both the high-voltage transmission and distribution networks,
becoming the responsibility of a new power systems business under
managing director Mr Alan Richardson. This business will be managed in
Glasgow with all operational centres remaining at the company's local
offices.
A new metering business will also be formed, with its head office in
Portobello in Edinburgh employing 120 staff.
ScottishPower, which achieved a 7% rise in pre-tax profits to #375m in
the year to the end of March, has been expanding its electricity
operations outside Scotland, exporting more power generated north of the
Border to England, and even opening a generating station in Yorkshire.
It has also extended its activities to include gas and
telecommunications.

LAST week, Mr Michael Lunn, the chairman and chief executive of
Glasgow-based Scotch whisky distillers Whyte &amp; Mackay, was doing
business as usual. At the start of the week, he visited Vinexpo in
Bordeaux, a rare personal appearance at a major wine and spirits trade
show for a man thought by some in the industry to be somewhat aloof. ''I
didn't think it was his scene,'' said one.
By Thursday, Mr Lunn was part of a mob-handed contingent from the
Scotch Whisky Association listening to MPs Mr Jack Cunningham and Mr
George Robertson at Labour's launch of its Scottish Industry Forum in
Edinburgh. The SWA, with only the SNP so far on its side, was
unashamedly lobbying on the issue which has obsessed it for years -- tax
harmony with other alcoholic drinks, here and abroad.
However, by yesterday morning, Mr Lunn certainly was not engaged in
business as usual. In his sumptuous Dalmore House headquarters on the
north approaches to the Kingston Bridge, he was closeted with lawyers
and advisers, working out the details of a rapid exit deal for himself.
Out of a clear blue sky, after 17 years with the company, he had just
been fired by Whyte &amp; Mackay's owners, American Brands, and replaced by
an Australian, Mr Ken Hitchcock, who has made his name within American
Brands selling Jim Beam bourbon and some of Whyte &amp; Mackay's own Scotch
brands to antipodeans. Mr Hitchcock was already in town to take over the
reins from Mr Lunn, 53.
As in all such exits, Mr Lunn, until yesterday scheduled to become the
next chairman of the Glasgow Development Agency, is euphemistically
leaving ''to pursue other opportunities''. Because of contractual
negotiations, he cannot talk publicly about the circumstances of his
going. But it is clear he was fired.
It is equally clear that his going marks a significant change of
strategy for one of the five biggest companies in the Scotch industry.
His masters clearly decided that Mr Lunn was not the best person to
carry that change through. But that new direction could carry profound
implications for the entire whisky sector, which is enduring perplexing
times.
American Brands, through its Gallaher subsidiary, bought Whyte &amp;
Mackay in 1990 for #160m. It followed that up in 1993 by swallowing
Invergordon Distillers at the second attempt for #350m. Invergordon had
been the subject of an earlier, successful management buy-out in 1988
and had gone on to achieve a Stock Market listing in 1990.
In all, American has invested the best part of #600m in its Scotch
capacity. At best, it is getting erratic returns. In terms of profits,
perhaps as little as #20m a year at present. ''Not nearly enough to
justify the spend,'' said one shrewd observer.
The root problem is weak demand and the poor prices which Scotch
whisky, particularly secondary and buyer's own label (BOB) brands, is
getting in the domestic market place. Invergordon was the leading
supplier of BOB brands to supermarkets like Tesco. When Whyte &amp; Mackay
first bid for it, unsuccessfully, in 1991, such whisky was getting up to
#16 a case.
Now the price has slumped to between #8 and #10 a case. Similar price
erosion is affecting brands at every price point throughout the range.
And Whyte &amp; Mackay, as overall leader in the UK marketplace with a 25%
share, is taking that painfully on the chin.
Given Whyte &amp; Mackay's domestic exposure -- its Claymore and Whyte &amp;
Mackay Special blends are both in the UK top six -- others in the
industry have been looking to it to put more pressure on customers to
accept better margin pricing. But, if the new strategy being imported
from Australia is, as is hinted, more short-term, the approach may now
be to accept even slimmer margins in search of even higher volumes. That
could prove very bad news for the industry as a whole.
The other short-term palliative facing Mr Lunn's successor is major
cost reduction. Whyte &amp; Mackay has already mothballed three distilleries
in recent months, all part of its inheritance from Invergordon. But
Invergordon continues to run as a separate company from its Leith base
where, apart from administration, it has its own bottling capacity.
Invergordon is run by Mr Charles Shaw, Mr Lunn's long-time right-hand
man.
Whyte &amp; Mackay's own bottling capacity is across the road from
Invergordon at William Muir Bond 9, an earlier Lunn acquisition. Whyte &amp;
Mackay's main Glasgow presence is purely administrative, in a stylish
office block at the top of St Vincent Street.
If part of Mr Hitchcock's agenda is to rationalise and merge the two
operations, the Glasgow presence would seem to be the most likely
casualty, since it is relatively high-cost and removed from the bottling
operations. Even if Mr Lunn retains the chairmanship of the GDA he is
due to take up next month, he could yet be overseeing the departure of
another Glasgow corporate headquarters.
Mr Lunn took some stick for extinguishing the independence of a
recently floated Scottish company when he first bid for Invergordon in
1991. But the departing Whyte &amp; Mackay chairman was no stranger to
corporate wheeling and dealing in his 17 years with Whyte &amp; Mackay. He
joined not long after the company had been bought by Lonrho as part of
Scottish and Universal Investments.
In 1986, as the highly contentious Guinness bid for industry leader
Distillers unravelled, Mr Lunn and Lonrho's chairman, Mr Tiny Rowland,
made a highly opportunistic offer to buy various brands and stocks from
Distillers to reduce the danger of the agreed Guinness bid being
referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Mr Lunn made various attempts to mount a management buy-out from
Lonrho but eventually in 1989, after he had masterminded the purchase of
William Muir, Mr Lunn saw the business sold from under his nose with
little warning to casino and leisure group Brent Walker.
Brent Walker quickly slid into financial difficulties of its own and
Mr Lunn renewed his interest in a buy-out. For a time, he was persuaded
to tie up with the management buy-in team at another distiller, Burn
Stewart, to mount a joint bid for Whyte &amp; Mackay. But the approach broke
up in great acrimony in late 1989 with Burn Stewart's chairman, Mr Bill
Thornton, and Mr Lunn both alleging dirty tricks and double dealing by
the other side.
In the end, in February 1990, Mr Lunn gave up his hopes of doing his
own deal and oversaw the whisky group's sale to American Brands, through
its Gallaher operating subsidiary.
The following year, Mr Lunn, backed by the deep pockets of his new
parent, was on the trail of Invergordon with a hostile #286m bid.
Invergordon fought a feisty defence and left Whyte &amp; Mackay with a large
minority stake and heavy carrying costs. Whyte &amp; Mackay lost nearly #8m
in 1992 and only got back into the black the following year when
Invergordon finally fell to an improved #350m offer.
However, by then the price rot at the bargain end of the market had
well and truly set in. The commercial logic of the bid -- to build a
broader portfolio of brands and bring grain distilling capacity into the
enlarged group -- may have seemed impeccable on paper back in 1991. But,
like the spirit in the cask, it was evaporating by 1993. The market
pressures since, coupled with the Chancellor's December 1994 decision to
raise spirit taxes yet again to make good the shortfall from the
abandoned VAT on domestic fuel, have done nothing to relieve Whyte &amp;
Mackay's agony.
Some in the industry believed it was only a matter of time before his
American masters started cracking the whip over Mr Lunn. ''I thought he
was regarded as a good pair of hands by his lords and masters,'' said
one rival. ''But the crazy prices we are now enduring must have
undermined that.''
Another, Mr Geoffrey Maddrell, chairman of Macdonald Martin, echoed
that. ''I have to confess maybe it was something that was anticipated if
you look at their level of profitability,'' he said.
The big question now is what the new Whyte &amp; Mackay management will do
to improve returns on that massive initial investment in a troubled
industry. If Mr Hitchcock ushers in a new era of price cutting in a bid
to build volume, a collective groan will run round the industry. If that
happens, there are likely to be more distillery closures, more
rationalisation, and more undermining of the image of Scotch as a
quality product and a premium drink.

MINIMUM wage levels in Scotland are needed to make the country more
competitive and keep the workforce motivated, a leading trade unionist
claimed last night.
Mr Bill Speirs, deputy general secretary of the Scottish Trades Union
Congress, said that people north of the Border were suffering more than
most from low pay. Poverty was a cancer in society and there was strong
public support for a national minimum wage of #4.15 an hour, he said.
Many of the people on low pay in Scotland were in service industries,
involved in such things as tourism or caring for the elderly. It was
vital that those people should remain motivated so that they could
provide a high-quality, competitive service.
His comments came after a survey revealed that 79% of people in
Scotland supported introducing a minimum level of pay. About 55% said it
should be set at around #4 an hour.
The findings are included in a survey carried out by the National
Union of Civil and Public Servants, which has 15,000 members in
Scotland. The survey showed growing disquiet about the number of ''fat
cats'' earning vast sums compared with other people who were working for
low wages.
It contrasts the massive pay-outs given to heads of private utilities
with the fact that Oxfam is now turning its attention to Britain. It
singles out British Gas chief executive Mr Cedric Brown's #475,000
salary and his performance bonus of up to #590,000.
The luxury lifestyle of the rich is shown by the 24% increase in the
sale of Rolls-Royce cars and the increased British market for caviar.
Contrasted with that are pay rates spotted for shop assistants paying
#1.66 an hour, #1.43 an hour for a hairdresser, or #2 for a fire safety
consultant.
Mr Chris Easterling, of the Low Pay Unit, said Scotland was suffering
from the crime of under-payment. He said the report made it clear that
British workers were in danger of being exploited by international
companies who have targeted Britain's pool of what he described as cheap
labour. Pay rates in Korea and Taiwan were in some cases higher than
those in Britain, he said.
Around 300,000 out of a two million workforce in Scotland are believed
to be earning under #4.15 an hour. Mr Easterling said respectable
companies paying fair rates would be unaffected by any reform of the
wage structure, but employers who exploited their workforce by paying
poor wages would be forced out of business, if a minimum wage was
brought in.

A TEENAGE mugger was ordered to be detained in a young offenders'
institution for five years yesterday.
Scott McKenzie, 17, of Montrose Court, Paisley, admitted carrying out
five assaults and robberies in Paisley. His not guilty pleas to six
other charges were accepted by the Crown.
The High Court in Glasgow heard that McKenzie's arrest brought to an
end assaults on victims aged from 20 to 66, over a span of six months.
In one attack, in Fulbar Road, Ferguslie, McKenzie held a knife at the
stomach of Mrs Catherine Guthrie, 66, as she was walking home at 5pm.
Advocate-depute Mr Jock Thomson said: ''Mrs Guthrie flagged down two
passing cars. McKenzie tried to steal her bag, but Mrs Guthrie held on
so tightly that she was pulled to the ground. McKenzie ran away as the
cars stopped.''
In another attack, on January 13 this year, McKenzie attacked Mrs
Maire Green and robbed her of her bag and purse containing #8 and
personal items.
Mrs Green, 42, was dragged along the ground and her hands and knees
were cut and bruised.
In his first attack, on July 26 last year in Main Road, Ferguslie,
McKenzie assaulted a 20-year-old couple, threatened them with a knife
and stole a bag containing #60.
In a second attack a man had a knife held at his throat by a companion
of McKenzie and was robbed of #40.
Five days later Sharon McGuire, 33, was mugged of her bag holding #6
and personal items.
Defence advocate Mr Ronald Bain said that McKenzie had been released
from a children's home when he carried out the attacks while under the
influence of temazepam.
McKenzie had a ''sad and tragic background'', he said. His father had
been murdered two years ago and he was found sitting by the graveside.
Mr Bain said: ''He accepts the terror he imposed on his victims, and
he asks me to apologise to them on his behalf.''
Lord Milligan told McKenzie that his attacks were ''appalling, mean,
and cowardly'' and must have had an on-going emotional effect on his
elderly victims. The judge said that he would have imposed a more severe
sentence if McKenzie had been older.

HOUSING experts backed by the Archbishop of Canterbury are appealing
for housing to be given equal weight with unemployment, education, and
crime on the agenda of all political parties.
A report by the Chartered Institute of Housing due to be published
today claims that under-investing in housing leads to higher levels of
crime, ill health, and poor educational attainment.
The institute says that investment in council housing has fallen in
real terms, at recent prices, from more than #7000m in 1979-80 to around
#3000m in 1994-95. Research also shows that people renting council
houses are likely to die earlier than owner occupiers.
Case studies for different parts of the UK, however, reinforce the
argument that partnerships between housing organisations and other
agencies in the community can improve the situation.
For example, in Dundee, district council housing management working
with other agencies on the Whitfield estate has meant vandalism being
reduced by 60% in three years, housebreaking cut by 300%, and total
reported crime being reduced to half the neighbourhood average.
In Sheffield, according to the institute, co-operation between the
city council and the health authority resulted in well-targeted funds
combining in an effective campaign to prevent ill health, rather than
millions of pounds being spent later on trying to cure patients.
CIH chief executive Ms Christine Laird will launch the report, A Point
To Prove -- Why Housing Matters, at the institute's annual conference in
Harrogate today.
Also addressing the conference will be the Archbishop of Canterbury,
Dr George Carey, who will call for more action on housing and explore
the links between escalating crime, poverty, and preventing the growth
of a social underclass.
Ms Laird will tell delegates that the consequences of poor housing
affect the whole of society. They lead to poor health, reduced
employment prospects, educational disadvantage, and ultimately crime.
Investment in housing, she will stress, contributes to the economy and
generates not only capital growth but rental income. It produces VAT and
income tax receipts and plays an enormous part in employment creation,
with every #100m invested in housing creating 1000 jobs in the
construction industry and hundreds of jobs in other sectors of the
economy.

ONE of Scotland's most prominent and highly-paid business leaders last
night fell victim to the declining Scotch industry when he was ousted by
one of the country's leading whisky producers.
Mr Michael Lunn, the chairman and chief executive of Whyte &amp; Mackay,
was pushed from his #174,706 job only four months after the company
mothballed three of its seven Scottish distilleries.
And his appointment as the new chairman of the Glasgow Development
Agency -- a position he is to take up on July 6 -- could now be
threatened due to technical ineligibilities caused by his removal from
the Glasgow-based whisky giant.
Mr Lunn was last night said to be ''shocked'' at the ''out of the
blue'' resign ultimatum he was given by Whyte &amp; Mackay.
His departure, described as a ''resignation to pursue other
opportunities'' by Whyte &amp; Mackay, is believed to be a direct result of
the company's performance.
Whyte &amp; Mackay, a subsidiary of American Brands and Gallahers, was
recently ranked the UK's number one supplier of Scotch with 25% of the
market share.
But in 1992-93 -- the last year for which full figures are available
-- it made just #14m pre-tax profit from a #164m turnover. Despite the
buy-out of the independent Invergordon Distillers that profit margin is
not believed to have increased.
Mr Lunn spent most of yesterday morning engaged in negotiating a
golden handshake reported to run to #500,000. He refused to comment on
his departure, but was understood to be shocked by the decision to
replace him.
In a prepared statement Whyte &amp; Mackay said his 17-year commitment to
the company had been ''very considerable''. But Mr Lunn now faces an
equally unexpected second rub.
A spokesman for the GDA, the public enterprise company responsible for
economic development in Glasgow, last night told The Herald that
although Mr Lunn's appointment would not be affected, he would have to
obtain another company directorship in Glasgow to continue in office
after July 1996.
At Whyte &amp; Mackay Mr Lunn has been replaced by high-flying Australian
businessman Mr Ken Hitchcock, 53, managing director of Fortune Brands
Pty Ltd, the Australian subsidiary of Jim Beam Brands, a fellow
operating company of American Brands.
Mr Hitchcock's move to Scotland is an important tactical manoeuvre by
the parent company as Jim Beam Brands is still twice as large in terms
of profits as Whyte &amp; Mackay's grouping.
Under the direction of Mr Hitchcock, Fortune Brands has grown to
become the third largest distilled spirits company in Australia. Prior
to joining Fortune Brands Mr Hitchcock had served since 1988 as chief
executive officer of Carlton and United Breweries Pty Ltd, a subsidiary
of the Australian-based Fosters Brewing Group.
Last night a company spokesman told The Herald that reorganisation of
the Whyte &amp; Mackay structure was not on the agenda as a result of the
managerial change, but added that ''it would be up to Mr Hitchcock to
determine the future direction''.
A year ago Mr Lunn's future with Whyte &amp; Mackay appeared on a firm
footing as he announced a readiness to make a spirits purchase in
continental Europe to supplement the core Scotch whisky business.
He said he was looking at national spirits brands, and national
distribution companies, which might include brandy, gin or cordial
interests.
American Brands spent #600m, over the previous five years, on its
drinks side. Mr Lunn said its objective was for spirits to be a very
large core business, but that it could wait to get the right target over
a period of years.
His buoyant attitude followed the #350m takeover the previous November
of rival distillers Invergordon -- which supplies one quarter of all
own-name supermarket brands -- and the merger into Gallahers in 1990,
pushing the combined group to third place in the world Scotch whisky
market with a 9.6% share.
But in February this year, with the market awash with surplus whisky
and the tax differential favouring cheaper foreign wines and spirits,
Whyte &amp; Mackay announced the closure of three of its prime malt whisky
distilleries.
The Bruichladdich distillery on Islay, Tamnavulin-Glenlivet on
Speyside, and Tullibardine, near Dunblane, each ceased production.
Last night Mr Wallace Milroy, Scotland's leading whisky expert and
author of the Malt Whisky Almanac, told The Herald that Mr Lunn's
removal was symptomatic of the state of the whisky industry.
''The whole industry is fighting for survival on the back of the cross
channel threat and companies are having to take drastic measures in
their fight for the market share,'' he said.
''Survival seems bound up with high volume sales which make a small
but measurable profit and this is unfortunately all at the expense of
malt lines, individual distilleries and those who seek to protect them.
''Let's face it, many of the supermarket own labels are superb, with
very high malt content and that appears to be where the market's future
lies.''

AN advocate's wife who was jailed for 18 months for growing cannabis
in her Perthshire home was freed on bail yesterday pending an appeal
against her sentence.
Rosalind Henderson, 44, was sentenced by temporary judge Mr Robin
McEwan QC at the High Court in Edinburgh last Monday.
Yesterday, at the same court, Lord McCluskey granted her interim
liberation until her appeal on the basis that the sentence was too harsh
can be heard. No date for the hearing has yet been fixed.
Mrs Henderson admitted cultivating cannabis at the family home at Brae
of Monzie, near Crieff, between February 1993 and May 31 last year.
The case against Mr Keith Henderson, her advocate husband, was found
not proven.

PATIENTS, carers and organisations that contribute to the health of
the community have the chance of sharing the honours in this year's
Action Health Awards, promoted by Argyll and Clyde Health Board.
Nominations close at the end of the week for the three categories of
entrant who claim recognition for putting a spring in the step of the
area's 433,000 population.
The three categories are:-
* Personal achievement:- there will be two awards in this category,
one for an individual who has overcome serious illness and is leading a
fulfilled life while helping others to do the same, and the other for a
carer looking after a dependent relative or friend;
* Corporate achievement:- this is open to commercial and industrial
concerns, schools, voluntary organisations and health services, and
there will be three awards -- for contributing to the adoption of
healthy lifestyles, for contributing to improvement in quality of life
of those who are frail through age or handicap, and innovations in
health care which make a particular service more effective, acceptable
to patients or accessible;
* Sponsorships:- this will be given to a voluntary or educational
organisation -- a sports team or club or exercise group -- which
promotes healthy lifestyles.
Last year, the inaugural year, the Inverclyde area swept the board; in
the hope of sharpening up the competition this year the board have
blitzed the area with leaflets, from Clydeside all the way up to Oban.
As well as trophies and citations the prizes include #250 each for the
personal awards; a school winning the healthy lifestyle corporate award
will also get #250, and the sponsorship will be up to #1000.

A TEENAGE knife-wielding robber fled on his young brother's mountain
bike after his 74-year-old victim decided to have a go, a court heard
yesterday.
Peter Bell, 17, was armed with a knife that had a five-inch serrated
blade when he staged the robbery at a filling station, the High Court in
Edinburgh was told.
But it failed to scare off Mr Walter Hill, the elderly owner of St
Margaret's filling station, Salmon Inn Road, Polmont, Stirlingshire, who
grabbed his arm and swore at him when he demanded money.
Bell ran from the shop clutching the few notes he had managed to hold
on to, jumped on the bike, and cycled away. He was detained shortly
afterwards in the nearby village of Brightons after a shaken Mr Hill
raised the alarm.
Bell, of Garry Place, Grangemouth, admitted assaulting Mr Hill on
September 23 last year by menacing him with a knife and robbing him of a
sum of money.
Mr Ian Donaldson, defence counsel, told the court that his client had
committed an extremely stupid crime out of desperation. He owed a
moneylender #90, was under pressure and had already been assaulted in an
effort to make him pay.
Temporary judge Mr John Wheatley, QC, told Bell that because he was a
first offender who had acted out of character and made no attempt to use
the weapon he would place him on probation for three years.

UP to 300 nursing jobs are to go under plans announced yesterday by
one of Scotland's leading health trusts. The cuts were revealed in
Grampian Healthcare's three-year plan for 1995 to 1998, published
yesterday.
A trust spokesman said it was anticipated the jobs would go over the
next three years and there would be no need for compulsory redundancy.
He admitted nursing posts would be the hardest hit but said that
management and ancillary jobs would also be lost.
''The reduction is largely due to the community care scheme because we
are discharging patients into the community all the time, thereby doing
away with the need for nurses,'' said the spokesman.
He claimed there was evidence that the staff who lost their jobs would
pick up employment in the private sector, often looking after the same
people. ''We are optimistic that we can account for most of these
through natural wastage and voluntary redundancy,'' he said.
When the trust was established in 1993, it employed 6500 staff.
Yesterday's announcement will leave it with 4400 by 1988. A spokesman
for health union Unison said it would be discussing the matter at a
branch meeting in Aberdeen tonight.
Meanwhile, the trust is set to invest #15m in new services over the
next three years including a centre for non-emergency orthopaedics at
Aberdeen's Woodend Hospital. This had become necessary because of the
growing demand for hip and knee surgery. A new #1.5m outpatient clinic
will be opened at the hospital in March 1996.
The trust said it had worked closely with GPs and Grampian Health
Board in a bid to launch a pilot community health care centre in
Aberdeen.

Euro-sceptic Tory MP Nicholas Budgen assesses John Redwood's chances.
I SUPPOSE that every time a Government suffers a mild embarrassment or
a minor success, there is a tendency for over-excited journalists to
write that Westminster is buzzing with excitement. Yesterday, the cliche
was true.
In one bound, John Redwood became a credible candidate offering views
on a wide range of important issues.
There's some recent history here. We, the ''rebels'' were at Malvern
on Thursday. Only Teresa Gorman was in London. We were caught completely
on the hop by the Prime Minister's announcement.
Many of us thought that we would vote for Mr Major in any election
that might occur in the autumn because we believed that he had moved and
would move further towards our Euro-sceptical view.
However, we had expected that we should be able to consider events and
personalities carefully and slowly before a possible election in the
autumn.
As it was, we found that the Prime Minister blamed a small minority
who opposed him and he argued that the boil of Europe should be lanced.
We assumed that we were the small minority to which he referred. It was
clear that the boil could only be lanced by a proper election, with
candidates, discussion and even a manifesto.
Our immediate view at Malvern was that the issue of Europe influences
and transcends all others. If no-one else was prepared to stand as the
second candidate, then we were prepared to propose that one of our
number should stand.
John Redwood's decision has changed all these calculations. He is now
the candidate who can argue the case for a decisive Euro-sceptical
policy. He is also the candidate who can offer arguments about where the
Tory Party may go in the next few years. He has overtaken any stalking
horse and he has overtaken Michael Portillo and Norman Lamont.
What happens now? The short answer is that no one knows.
By bouncing the electorate of 328 Tory MPs, the Prime Minister has
prevented them from discussing the second candidate with their
constituency associations until next weekend.
One thing is clear. Mr Redwood is a serious candidate and there is
every chance that his vote and the abstentions may erode the authority
of the Prime Minister, even fatally.
The next question is what does Mr Heseltine do? He knows that Mr
Redwood may acquire by his boldness a lead which gives him a great
advantage in the second round. Mr Heseltine is now constrained by his
promises to the Prime Minister and the Cabinet.
He may now attempt to obtain release from his promises of chastity,
poverty and obedience. If he was released and he stood in the first
round, the issue of leadership would be settled for some time.
For Michael Heseltine, the movement of events for this his last chance
have not been favourable. John Redwood's boldness will gain him votes
from some people.
But apart from the issue of character, there are two main strands of
support for Michael Heseltine.
Michael, while in the wilderness as he hoped others would see it,
wrote a book on his political philosophy. It advocated a rapid and
detailed progress towards an ever more federal Europe.
Just as Ken Clarke's stock has fallen in value, so has this element of
Michael Heseltine's support diminished. It is now obvious to everyone
that support for European integration has been greatly reduced in the
last year amongst at any rate this electorate -- Tory MPs.
The second strand of Mr Heseltine's support was his appeal to those
who like a strong, good-looking and, where necessary, authoritarian
leader. ''Never mind his views, he is a winner and he may save my
seat.''
Now such colleagues are believed to be supporting Mr Redwood in the
first ballot. They might not transfer to Mr Heseltine in any second
ballot.
If somebody tells you he knows what will happen, he's either a liar or
a fool. But I have a feeling in my bones that yesterday we saw a
historic step which may affect the Tory Party for many years and may
lead to a looser and happier relationship with our continental
neighbours.

ANNOYANCE with Britain's continuing domestic row over Europe was
expressed obliquely yesterday by Mr Klaus Hansch, president of the
European Parliament.
He told the EU summit, where Mr Major is the centre of attention: ''A
domestic crisis should not paralyse the European Union, especially when
it is in one party and not in one country.''
He used the convulsions in the Conserative Party as an example of why
there should be more majority voting in the EU as it enlarges eastwards
in the early years of next century. Britain's strongest argument at next
year's super-summit to review the Maastricht Treaty will be for
retention of the national veto in all existing areas.
If Britain fails in this objective, the council will be able to brush
aside the wishes of states which cannot summon a blocking minority of
votes in the Council of Ministers.
The whole controversial question of qualified majority voting (QMV) is
certain to be at the centre of Britain's next General Election campaign.
However, Mr Hansch, a German Social Democrat, did not call for
abolition of the national veto as many German and Benelux politicians
wish. Instead, he said the veto should continue to exist at EU summits
where unanimity should be the rule for heads of state and government.
He also joined in the growing debate about economic and monetary union
(Emu) by saying that the planned single European currency should retain
the existing names of national currencies. If Britain joined, this would
mean the pound becoming the Europound, the German mark the Euromark, the
French franc the Eurofranc, and so on.
For the benefit of doubting British politicians worried about a name
for the currency, Mr Hansch quoted Shakespeare: ''What's in a name! A
rose by any other name smells as sweet.''
He warned the EU to ''look before you leap'' into the ''massive
political task of overcoming psychological barriers'' facing a single
currency.
''The introduction of the common currency is totally unlike anything
else that has gone before in the process of European unification,'' he
added.

FIVE teams of researchers are being brought under one roof in a bid to
crack the secrets of Alzheimer's disease and other neurological
disorders.
Construction started yesterday on the #250,000 building which will
house the Dundee Neurosciences Research Institute at Ninewells Hospital.
The first multi-disciplinary research centre in Scotland focusing on
the causes of neurological diseases, it is funded by Dundee University,
Scottish Enterprise Tayside, and Drug Development Scotland, with #1m to
set up and run for the first five years.
About 50 researchers and technicians currently working in the
university departments of biological sciences, biochemistry,
pharmacology, and clinical pharmacology will transfer to the institute.
They expect to attract annual funding of #600,000 to research problems
including Alzeimer's, genetic defects in the brain, the molecular basis
of drug dependency, the reasons for brain damage in stroke, and the
influence of steroids on the brain.
Professor of Neurochemistry David Nicholls, one of the instigators of
the project, saidthat they were beginning to understand the underlying
causes of these brain disorders, and hoped it would eventually lead to
cure.

PRINCE Charles declined an offer from a tattooed lady on a visit to
Dundee yesterday.
The Prince of Wales asked Mrs Pat Waugh, 40, about the tattoo of her
three son's names on her right arm. But he turned down her offer of a
cheap tattoo.
Prince Charles met Mrs Waugh during a walkabout in Dundee's
regenerated Whitfield housing estate. Mrs Waugh, who has the names of
her sons Sandy, Gary, and James inscribed on her arm, explained that the
Prince asked her about her tattoo.
She said: ''I told him you can get it done very cheaply in Dundee, but
he didn't take me up on the offer.
''I told him he was looking well and to keep his chin up and not let
things get him down. He's making a good job of it despite his personal
problems.''
The Prince was touring the once-notorious Whitfield housing estate in
Dundee as part of a two-day visit to the city.
Mr Tom Farmer, Kwik-Fit chief and chairman of the Scottish Business in
the Community, introduced the Prince to members of housing co-operatives
in the scheme.
Scottish Homes has recently revealed a #4m housing boost for the
scheme, taking its investment in Whitfield to more than #26m since 1989.
Mr Bob Wallace, chairman of the Whitfield Partnership, said: ''The
residents have put a lot of effort into this area and it's satisfying
that the Prince has come to see all the hard work. People were hurrying
to get out of Whitfield a few years ago, but now they're desperate to
get in.''
Prince Charles also had time for a cooling glass of orange juice at
the home of Hamish and Pat Lawrence in Kirkconnel Terrace, Whitfield.
The Prince later planted a UN Peacekeeper rose, to mark 50 years of
the United Nations, at Dundee's Stobsmuir Park.
The Royal Yacht Britannia is berthed in Dundee harbour for the
Prince's visit and last night the Band of the Royal Marines performed a
Beating the Retreat ceremony on the quayside.
The Prince will carry out a full day of engagements in Dundee today.
On Thursday he is scheduled to make a flying visit to Castlebay on
Barra in the Western Isles.
The Prince, who is also Lord of the Isles, has been involved for
months in the planning of eight new houses for the Barra and Vatersay
Housing Association.
Barra councillor Captain Roddy Mackinnon said: ''Somehow, probably
through his interest in architecture and housing, he heard of the
project and asked if he could help.
''His architect is working closely with us and we hope the Prince's
interest will help with getting funding.'' Mr Mackinnon hopes that when
the houses are eventually completed, they will be named after Prince
Charles.
During his 2[1/2]-hour visit, the Prince also plans to meet the
island's representatives on the Prince's Trust.

A BUSINESSMAN'S claim to be the victim of a malicious prosecution for
fraud as part of a bid to discredit former Manchester Deputy Chief
Constable John Stalker has been settled out of court, it was confirmed
last night.
Mr Kevin Taylor's High Court action against Sir James Anderton, former
chief constable of Greater Manchester, was stopped yesterday.
A spokeswoman for Greater Manchester Police confirmed that a
settlement had been reached, but said she could not comment on reports
that the sum agreed was about #1m.
Sir James's successor as chief constable, Mr David Wilmot, said it was
''a matter of regret'' that the case had been settled for commercial
considerations -- because of concern about the ''enormous'' costs of
defending the action.
The hearing in the High Court in Liverpool, began seven weeks ago.
Mr Taylor, 63, of Baxenden, near Accrington, Lancashire, claimed he
was the victim of a malicious prosecution for fraud brought by Sir
James, now retired.
He maintained that the prosecution was mounted with the aim of
discrediting his close friend Mr Stalker, who was heading an inquiry
into an alleged official shoot-to-kill policy in Northern Ireland.
Greater Manchester Police said in a statement: ''Municipal Mutual
Insurance Company plc are the insurers of the Greater Manchester Police
Authority. It was the wish of those insurers to bring the proceedings to
a speedy conclusion, having regard to the enormous costs involved.''
0
Mr Taylor said later he was not happy with the settlement, but
had been forced into acceptance because he faced losing legal aid.
Mr Taylor said that when he arrived at court yesterday, his counsel
had told him of the insurers' offer, which he had been bound to report
to the legal aid office because he thought it reasonable.
The 1990 trial of Mr Taylor -- he was alleged to have defrauded the
Co-operative Bank of more than #200,000 -- collapsed. He had claimed the
police fabricated evidence.
Mr Stalker was subpoenaed as a witness for Mr Taylor at the High
Court. But when the case opened, Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick
Mayhew moved to stop much of Mr Stalker's evidence.
Mr Ian Burnett, counsel for the Crown, said Sir Patrick objected
because public interest demanded confidentiality in the criminal
investigation process, and because some of Mr Stalker's evidence would
be ''contrary to the interests of public security''.
He suggested that evidence about Mr Stalker's investigations in
Northern Ireland could endanger the peace process.
Mr Justice Owen partly upheld the application, ruling that much of Mr
Stalker's planned evidence could not be heard.

Redwood played for his village team while his party was wondering what
he planned. In the end, writes Stephen McGregor, Parliamentary
Correspondent, he came up with a googly.
IN THE tough game of politics, it is as well sometimes to play hard
ball. That is precisely what Mr John Redwood did on Sunday, playing in a
village cricket match while all about him the world was going mad.
It was difficult to tell at the time -- he in a cricket pullover, his
wife offering mugs of tea to the media -- exactly what was going on in
his mind, but now we know and by early yesterday all doubts were
dispelled. Mr Redwood had decided to exchange village cricket for a
full-blown Test Match, and had done a bit of a phone round of the
selection committee.
The seeds of discontent in the mind of this quiet, but right-wing MP
were probably sown further back than his meeting with the Prime Minister
on Wednesday of last week.
An ultimate Thatcherite -- head of her policy unit from 1983-85 -- he
probably always felt that in the Major era he was banged off to Wales as
something of an afterthought to give him a Cabinet position without
allowing him to cause too much trouble on the hard right.
However, the right wing of the Tory party never dies, and the bearers
of its flags certainly do not fade away. Mr Redwood has spent his years
as Welsh Secretary nursing his wrath to keep it warm and continuing to
hold true to, and put forward, his right-wing credentials.
As one source put it yesterday: ''Mr Redwood was not popular in Wales
which, it is alleged, he used as a laboratory to experiment with his
distinctive policies and exploited his Cabinet rank as a platform to
appear on TV.''
Matters came to a head last Wednesday, at a meeting between Mr Redwood
and the Prime Minister. By Sunday, the Prime Minister was saying on the
BBC that he did not know whether there was a problem with his Cabinet
colleague, adding: ''I suggest we wait and see.'' We all waited, and saw
less than 24 hours later, and now it is game on.
Last Wednesday, the day before Mr Major made his dramatic announcement
precipitating the leadership contest, he met Mr Redwood but, in a move
guaranteed later to annoy his Welsh Secretary, did not tell him what was
on his mind, and rejected some ideas Mr Redwood put forward about the
future direction of party policy.
On the day of the Prime Minister's decision to stand down, Mr Major
spoke to some of his inner-circle of senior Ministers and told them to
contact those thought to be marginally more junior.
Home Secretary Michael Howard was detailed to phone Mr Redwood, which
he did. He explained the situation and why the Prime Minister, under
pressure, could not speak to him personally. Sources said Mr Redwood
made no protest, declared that he fully understood, and promised full
support.
On the same day Education Secretary Gillian Shephard spoke to Mr
Redwood. Later, he rang back promising full support for the Prime
Minister, and it is understood that she was the last Cabinet member Mr
Redwood spoke to before his announcement yesterday morning.
On Friday, the Cowley Street headquarters of Mr Major's campaign spent
the entire day trying to get through to Mr Redwood, and failing. Alarm
bells as to what he was up to began to ring, and the same tactic was
tried on Saturday. Attempts were made to send faxes to his home, he was
phoned at home, and attempts were made to get him on the party network.
The phone was found to be not responding or engaged.
What was happening was that in the background Mr Redwood, while not
returning phone calls, had been in touch not only with Norman Lamont but
with other right-wingers urging him to go for it. Mr Lamont apparently
told him: ''You should do it, not me, and if you do I will stand aside
and support you.''
Mr Redwood then went through further consultation with people on the
right of the party and pieced together a campaign team, details of which
will be announced today. He reckons he has, at the very least, put
together enough support to avoid humiliation.
The text of his resignation letter to Mr Major tells its own story.
''Your decision to resign leaves our party in limbo when it needs firm
but understanding leadership. It makes a contest inevitable. This
weekend has shown how strong feelings are and there is no shortage of
people wanting to stand or support someone other than you.''
The man is playing hard-ball indeed.

A STIRLING woman who inherited a rare signed first edition of Beatrix
Potter's The Tale of Peter Rabbit has discovered it could fetch #25,000.
The 48-year-old mother took the book to The Antiques Roadshow,
recorded in the town last week, to have it assessed by the BBC's
experts.
And yesterday she revealed the limited edition book, published in
1900, is highly sought after by collectors and could fetch up to #25,000
at auction.
Antiquarian books expert Clive Farahar, who examined the title during
the recording of the show, said last night: ''As soon as I saw it, I
started shaking and had to put it down.
''Another signed first edition was recently sold in the States for
#45,000, but that was in much better condition.''
Meanwhile, the owner, a divorcee who works as a secretary and has not
been named for security reasons, was planning to sell the heirloom.
She said: ''My house is requiring some serious roof repairs and the
money will come in very handy indeed.''
The woman's great aunt was a friend of Beatrix Potter.
The present owner had telephoned a Glasgow auction house to ask for a
rough value and had been told it might be worth #500. Mr Farahar added:
''At the turn of the century, Beatrix Potter was leading a rather
unhappy life looking after her parents in London.
''She kept a pet rabbit which became the subject of her drawings and
despite having friends in the publishing trade, she did not believe her
first little book would be acceptable and therefore published 250 copies
privately.
''It was so popular that she soon had a second run printed and after
that, the book was taken up by Warne &amp; Co and became a children's
classic.

TORY right-winger Mr Michael Forsyth is now certain to become
Secretary of State for Scotland whatever the outcome of the present
leadership battle, senior figures in the party north of the Border
believe.
The Stirling MP, at present a Minister at the Home Office, has shown
deft political footwork to manoeuvre himself into an unassailable
position as successor to Mr Ian Lang, whose future is now so closely
bound up with that of John Major that he is regarded as a certainty to
move on, once the dust settles.
Whether that move is up to a more senior portfolio or out of the
Cabinet will hinge on the success or failure of the Major campaign, but
either way it is believed that there is now only one credible successor
at St Andrew's House.
''Ian Lang is an elegant batsman on the back foot playing defensive
strokes,'' said one senior figure, ''but we need someone who can play
off the front foot and go on the offensive against Labour.''
Admirers speak of Mr Forsyth as a street-fighter who will take the
battle to Labour and give them a hard time in the media, whether he is
put into the office as part of a right-wing slate in a new Cabinet, or
whether a new Government led by Mr Michael Heseltine feels it has to buy
off a degree of right-wing support.
Mr Forsyth spent yesterday continuing to work hard for a Major victory
at his campaign office in Cowley Street near Westminster, as he did in a
public show of support for the Prime Minister last Saturday.
As he left a dinner at the Institute of Economic Affairs last night,
he reiterated his support for the Prime Minister.
Asked why he was at a meeting with Mr Redwood, he said: ''It was a
meeting of the No Turning Back group, of which Mr Redwood is a member.''
Asked if Mr Redwood's leadership campaign had been discussed, he said:
''Certainly not.'' The dinner had been arranged some time ago.
He is said to be a Major supporter in the current election for reasons
of both principle and pragmatism. On the first point, he was known to
have been devastated when Baroness Thatcher lost the leadership while in
office and to believe that this is wrong.
On a tactical front he is understood to have looked at the numbers and
concluded that backing Mr Major represents the best chance of beating
off the likely challenge from the Euro-phile left of the party
represented by Michael Heseltine. For these reasons, at least until
after the first ballot a week from now, Mr Forsyth is working hard for
Mr Lang on the Major campaign team.
Most party insiders now believe that, regardless of the ideological
battle for the leadership of the party, Mr Forsyth is destined to take
over at St Andrew's House, where he will have a much higher profile than
at present, which will help him in the tough battle ahead to retain his
marginal Stirling seat.
Eastwood MP Mr Allan Stewart is one prominent Tory who has said that,
if Mr Lang is promoted, there is only one candidate for the job.
''Michael is the obvious candidate,'' he said.
The president of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Association,
Mr David McLetchie, said he considered Mr Lang an outstanding Secretary
of State, ''but if the Prime Minister promoted him Michael Forsyth would
make an excellent successor''.

European editor Murray Ritchie reports from the Cannes summit on the
perils of politics.
EUROPEAN summits can be bad for the political health, and not just for
John Major.
In the eerie atmosphere of Cannes yesterday, Mr Major arrived for the
EU's six-monthly gathering of leaders. It should have been a pleasant
out-of-towner to the French Riviera. Instead, he was fighting for his
political life.
Not for him the pleasures of the beaches, palms and blazing sun over
the Cote d'Azur, or the tented buffet by the shore where spoiled
journalists were force-fed the best of French cuisine as they waited for
Mr Major and others to arrive.
The Prime Minister must have been haunted by the ghost of Lady
Thatcher's famous failure to triumph in a first ballot for the Tory
leadership when she attended an EU security conference in Paris. If
Europe could let that happen to her, of all people, what must be his
chances?
He knew, too, as he stepped from the limousine to be met by a beaming
President Chirac, that some of his fellow-summiteers around the table
had their problems. However, nothing to compare with his.
Lady Thatcher, the most determined of British post-war leaders, fell
because of Europe. John Major, one of the least determined, looked
yesterday like following suit. It must be the French.
Having got shot of the socialist, Roman Catholic, intellectual
Frenchman, Jacques Delors, the ultimate Euro-bogeyman to Tory
Euro-sceptic eyes, Mr Major could have been forgiven for thinking things
at last could only get better. He has a colleague ''with whom we can do
business'' -- a Thatcherite phrase from the Gorbachev years -- in the
Elysee, and a clutch of right-of-centre leaders around him.
However, like most summits, this one is a painful reminder of the
transitory nature of politicians.
This summit's crop of casualties is typical. There is Mr Major,
possibly on summit duty for the last time.
Long-serving Felipe Gonzalez of Spain appears in danger of losing his
premiership if the Catalan nationalists pull their support for his
coalition. Like the British Tories, his socialist government is beset by
scandal and sleaze.
John Bruton of Ireland is at his first summit simply because his
predecessor Albert Reynolds was overthrown after failing to distance
himself from a scandal involving the extradition of a priest child
abuser.
Silvio Berlusconi's premiership of Italy is history largely because
his murky business methods look like keeping Rome's finest occupied for
the foreseeable future. His place is taken by Lamberto Dini.
Belgium's Jean-Luc Dehaene is at the top table but only by the skin of
his teeth. He has just won an election but, being Belgian, he needed
several weeks to put together a coalition government. He managed with
hours to spare.
Jacques Santer of Luxembourg, a summit veteran, is also a casualty of
sorts. He was the prime minister until Mr Major propelled him into the
presidency of the European Commission because the British Government did
not like Mr Dehaene. Now Mr Santer is in Cannes as a bureaucrat, however
exalted, while Luxembourg is represented by his successor, Mr
Jean-Claude Juncker.
Mr Delors put in a decade of summits before his departure. His old
comrade, Mr Francois Mitterrand of France, now retired and terminally
ill, was absent for the first time. He turned up at these gatherings for
14 years and is probably relieved to be shot of them, although he would
have enjoyed the limelight as chairman of this one.
This summit is also a glimpse of tomorrow's European. Those states
which have just joined the Community and those which will one day be
members are all here, too. The newcomers are Sweden, Finland and
Austria.
However, there are leaders from Poland, Romania, the Czech Republic,
Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Cyprus and
Malta. They must love the climate of Cannes, marvel at the fine wines
and beautiful people promenading along La Croisette. But they must worry
at the survival rate.

BUSINESS travellers were yesterday urged to support direct
transatlantic services from Glasgow Airport.
The call came from Mr Bob Buntin, former general manager in Scotland
for Northwest Airlines, one of three American carriers which axed or
suspended direct scheduled flights from Glasgow last year.
The guest speaker at a meeting of Glasgow Chamber of Commerce told his
audience they must support those transatlantic services still operating
from the city's airport. He said: ''I believe Glasgow can sustain more
transatlantic operations. But fares have to be sustained at a realistic
level. If you want to fly club class or executive class, you must be
prepared to pay for the service.''
Last year, Northwest ended its Boston service, United Airlines stopped
its flights to Washington, and American Airlines suspended its service
to Chicago for the winter.
Mr Buntin, now managing director of the Greenock-based Destination
Company, described the events of 1994 as a ''debacle''. Most of the
responsibility lay with airlines themselves, he said. A new market
entrant had destabilised the market by operating free upgrades and
cheaper fares, and all the carriers had ended up trying to outdo each
other.
But he added: ''Some portion of blame also lies with consumers who
demanded ever-better services for ever-reducing fares. The airlines who
pulled out of Glasgow did not do so because there was insufficient
traffic but because that traffic did not provide profit.''

Cannes
PRIME Minister John Major dismissed John Redwood's chances of
capturing the Tory leadership last night and condemned his rival as a
Cabinet malcontent.
Mr Major took a brief break from the EU summit to step into the
evening sunshine of the Cote D'Azur where he told reporters: ''I am
every bit as confident as I was last Thursday. I expect to win.''
In his first and careful response to his deepening troubles the Prime
Minister denied that Cabinet right-winger Mr Redwood had destroyed his
initiative in provoking a leadership election as a means of healing the
Tory running sore over Europe.
''I don't think it is like that,'' he said. ''I think we now have an
election which people can take seriously and it gives us an admirable
opportunity to clear the air.''
He predicted that when he had seen off Mr Redwood he could turn a
united Conservative Party's attention to defeating Labour in a General
Election.
Rounding on Mr Redwood's act of defiance, Mr Major said: ''John has
sat in the Cabinet for the past two or three years. He knows what our
policies are. He sat there and accepted them throughout that time. I am,
therefore, rather surprised that suddenly he should take a different
position from the rest of the Cabinet.''
Asked if he was angry with the stand taken by Mr Redwood -- whom he
once famously denounced as one of the Cabinet's ''bastards'' -- Mr Major
replied: ''I am not angry. I am intrigued but I am certainly not
angry.''
Then he turned on the Welsh Secretary, saying: ''There is one
malcontent in the team rather than malcontents.''
Mr Douglas Hurd, Foreign Secretary, who yesterday announced he was
quitting as an MP at the next election, predicted Mr Major would win.
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke, meanwhile, issued a warning to Conservative
MPs that a right-wing programme inspired by John Redwood could keep the
Tories out of power for 1000 years.
Expressing undisguised anger at Mr Redwood, Mr Clarke predicted that
Mr Redwood would stand on an ideological right-wing platform that would
see Britain ''adopt attitudes towards Europe which would detach us from
the European Union'' -- and lose the country huge benefits.
Tory right-winger John Carlisle, who opposes Mr Major, predicted Mr
Redwood would have ''broad support'' across the party.

THE Prime Minister won a new Euro opt-out in Cannes early this
morning, a move calculated to appease his Conservative Euro-sceptics.
Over dinner at the summit, Mr Major insisted Britain would not accept
any powers for the European Court of Justice in the running of Europol,
the new EU-wide intelligence-gathering system to combat cross-border
crime and drugs trafficking.
After some tough talking, other EU leaders agreed that Europol would
come into force immediately, but with a one-year delay before any
decision is taken on a disputes procedure.
The plan had been to give European Court judges the final say in any
legal disputes either between member states or between individuals from
the member states over information supplied by the Europol data base
which leads to prosecutions.
For two hours over dinner at a restaurant in Cannes Mr Major insisted
that European Court jurisdiction would effectively give the EU a role it
was never intended to have under the Maastricht Treaty.
The Europol Convention, he emphasised, was an inter-governmental
agreement between member states.
He said he was determined to safeguard British national interests.
He warned that Britain would still reject the courts involvement in a
year's time when the other member states try again.
Senior government officials said Mr Major was pleased with the outcome
and had gone to bed ''in an optimistic and upbeat mood''.
One offical added: ''He was calm, confident and determined.''
Oficials said the talks had been ''hard-pounding'' and added: ''We
feel that the control of police intelligence is absolutely not a
supra-national issue. This goes to the heart of national sovereignty.''
The outcome angered German officials. One said: ''It is 14 to one.
Britain alone stands against its citizens having recourse to the
European Court.''
The deal is due to tbe clinched formally at today's final session of
the Summit. Mr Major flies home tonight able to claim another victory
against the powers of Brussels -- hoping it will swing Euro sceptic
votes his way.

A SCOTTISH local enterprise company launched its annual report in a
classroom yesterday, to highlight the success of one of its projects
aimed at providing jobs for school leavers.
Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise Limited said it was delighted at the
success of its Compact scheme, which is designed to help young people
from disadvantaged areas.
More than 1200 teenagers in four Edinburgh schools have signed up for
the project. Local employers provide pupils with mock interviews,
information on the jobs market, and work experience placements.
To highlight the success of the initiative, the company's annual
report was launched at one of the participating schools, Castlebrae High
School in Craigmillar.
Chief executive Dr Des Bonnar described the project as a tremendous
success.
Meanwhile, Dunbartonshire Enterprise, which last year helped create
2220 jobs, has exceeded its jobs creation target by more than 10%.
Its annual report also reveals that with 360 firms being set up with
assistance from the local enterprise company and its partner
organisations, it exceeded target figures by 4%.
Chief executive Donald MacInnes said: ''The report shows that we have
achieved, and in some cases beaten, most of our targets.
This is a tribute to the hard work of our staff but, more importantly,
it means that we have enhanced the lives and livelihoods of so many
people.

SCOTTISH Office Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton insisted last
night that the Government was looking at action that could be taken
against anti-social tenants and bad neighbours.
In a late night Commons debate he argued that one of the most basic
human needs was to be able to have quiet enjoyment of one's home. There
were, however, occasions when this broke down and he outlined a range of
measures the Government was looking at to address the problem.
Labour has recently said that it believes the ultimate sanction for
anti-social neighbours should be imprisonment, but Lord James pointed
out that the Government already had mechanisms in place and was looking
at others.
One would be probationary tenancies, on which the Scottish Office had
issued a consultation paper a month ago. A number of authorities on both
sides of the Border had made the suggestion that new tenants should be
on probation initially, until the landlord could judge that they were
able to behave responsibly and were not disruptive.
When it had been first announced that there would be consultation on
the matter, Lord James had made clear he would keep an open mind. That
remained the position.
The subject of bad and noisy neighbours was raised by the Liberal
Democrat MP for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, Mr Archy Kirkwood, who called
for greater powers and more resources to be made available to local
authorities to deal with the escalating problem of anti-social tenants.
He said: ''Drug pushing, racial harassment and domestic violence are
all on the increase in a worrying way. It may only be a minority of
tenants engaging in this unacceptable behaviour, and safeguards have to
be maintained to protect mentally ill tenants and families with genuine
difficulties, but the Government's plans are totally irrelevant to the
problems being faced by local authorities in Scotland.''

FOREIGN Secretary Douglas Hurd will not stand at the next election, he
announced yesterday.
Mr Hurd, who announced last week that he would resign from his Cabinet
post after the Tory leadership election, was speaking from the EU summit
in Cannes.
He said: ''I have decided by the end of the next Parliament certainly
I will be over 70. I think the time will have come to move on.''
Mr Hurd is MP for Witney in Oxfordshire. His constituency chairman
expressed regret at the news.
''I can't tell you how much the man was respected here,'' Mr Mike
Osborne said.
''We are all terribly sad to lose him. I have never worked with
anybody in any institution or organisation who is held with quite the
regard he is.
''So many times constituency members have said they have had
hand-written letters from him and then turned on the TV and seen he was
in Timbuktu and they just say 'How does he do it'?''
Mr Osborne continued: ''The fact of the matter is he always responded
immediately to any constituency member who had a problem and nine times
out of 10 gave a hand-written reply.
''Only twice did he break engagements here -- once during the Gulf war
and once during the Balkan crisis. This shows the respect with which he
treated us,'' Mr Osborne added.

A POLICEMAN told a murder trial that he found a dying man slumped in
his bloodstained flat, clutching a telephone.
The discovery followed a 999 call in which no words were spoken and
all the telephonist could hear was a moan.
PC John Donoghue was giving evidence at the High Court in Edinburgh,
where Paul Strathearn, 33, denies murdering Mr Lawrence Leydon in the
latter's home at Southhouse Medway, Edinburgh, on February 11 this year.
It is alleged that Strathearn punched Mr Leydon on the face and
repeatedly struck and stabbed him on the body with a knife. Strathearn
has admitted killing Mr Leydon, but the Crown refused to accept his plea
to culpable homicide.
PC Donoghue said he was the first policeman on the scene after the 999
call had been traced. The door was ajar.He found the victim lying in the
hall, with his head in the doorway leading into the lounge. His left
hand was across his chest and his right hand was clutching the
telephone. There were bloodstains in the lounge and kitchen.
There were also bloodstains on the victim's shirt, but he couldn't see
what his injuries were. ''I realised he would need medical assistance. I
checked for a pulse and could find none.''
An emergency medical team arrived within five minutes and, as they
took Mr Leydon downstairs, they stopped every few yards to give him
heart massage. However, by the time he reached the ambulance, life was
pronounced extinct.
At the mortuary he observed that the victim had nine stab wounds to
his torso and upper body.
The trial continues.

THE City suffered its worst day this year as nearly #12bn was wiped
off share prices and the pound lost about two cents on the dollar and
two pfennigs on the mark. Mr John Redwood's intervention in the
leadership battle was seen as increasing the risks that the contest
might be extended to a second round. There were fears the outcome would
be a damaging shift in economic policy as the victor strove to win back
public support. The FTSE-100 share index fell 70.2 points to 3309.2, its
biggest setback for more than 16 months, with 98 of the top 100 shares
dropping in price. Privatisation issues were among the biggest losers
with British Telecom dropping 10p to 393[1/2]p, British Gas 9[1/2]p to
294[1/2]p, and Scottish Power 9p to 327p. The pound has lost nearly 6%
of its value this year adding to inflationary pressures in industry and
increasing the cost of holidays abroad.

THERE was much rejoicing in the valleys and in the hillsides as word
quickly spread around Wales that John Redwood was no longer Secretary of
State.
''What we have gone through over two extraordinarily long years is
what you in the rest of the UK can expect from now on should he become
Prime Minister,'' was the message coming out of the principality.
In the brief period since Mr Redwood was promoted to the Cabinet, he
has created an air of doom and despondency in Wales. Never before can so
much upset have been caused by one man, according to many you speak to
in Wales.
As a theorist on the far right of the party, Mr Redwood's mission was
to root out and destroy anything that he felt was tainted by socialism.
In the process he did not care whom he upset.
A devoted fan of the Sun, he once listed not reading the Guardian as a
hobby in Who's Who. A whole-hearted supporter of the market economy, he
is against abortion but supports capital punishment.
Like Margaret Thatcher, Victorian values are paramount in his book.
During a visit to a Cardiff housing estate he lambasted what he saw as
the trend of young women having babies with no apparent intention of
even trying marriage or a stable relationship with the father.
Like John Major, he is passionate about cricket. A medium pace bowler,
he is always looking for cracks in pitch that might win him the match.
On taking up his job as Welsh Secretary, he boasted that his only
connection with Wales, apart from one holiday there as a schoolboy, was
that the M4 ran through his Wokingham contituency.
The Tory party in Wales is now all but non-existent. The
Conservatives' standing there can hardly get any worse and many put it
down to him personally.
They were nearly wiped out in the recent council elections. Their
annual conference a few days ago could have been held in a telephone
box.
''He will go down like a rat sandwich,'' was the assessment of Mr
Ieuan Wyn Jones, Plaid Cymru whip, when Mr Redwood was appointed to the
top job in Wales.
Yesterday that party's verdict on his subsequent performance was: ''He
has nothing to commend him to the Tory party except his loony right-wing
credentials .
''The only thing he has done with any passion during his tenure at the
Welsh Office has been to pursue his own personal career ambitions.''
Mr Redwood came in to Wales with his own right-wing Thatcherite ideas
and immediately got up the nose of most Welshmen. A common theme put to
me was: ''The last thought in his mind was what would be good for
Wales.''

SCOTS Tory maverick Bill Walker is braced for a constituency backlash
over his decision to become the only Scottish MP to come out against the
Prime Minister in the leadership battle.
The party leadership in Scotland was quick to point out yesterday that
representatives of his Tayside North constituency association had voted
in favour of Mr Major at a meeting of Scottish party activists at the
weekend.
His constituency chairman, Mr Michael McPhail, said last night: ''I
think it will make for an interesting period within the constituency.
Those who have been in touch have been unanimously in favour of John
Major, but all of those did so prior to John Redwood entering the race.
''Bill's way of putting it is that he is a representative and not a
delegate. In the interests of trying to hold the constituency together,
I wouldn't like to say more than that I understand Bill's position. He
is someone with very strong views on Europe.''
Scottish Tory chairman Sir Michael Hirst criticised Mr Redwood's
decision to stand as a display of ''remarkable pique'' based on a
''specious excuse that was extraordinarily petty.''
However, Sir Michael conceded: ''For better or worse, John Redwood is
a credible candidate who will ensure a proper election, for at the end
of the day we must resolve this because the party is looking over the
precipice.''
Eastwood MP Allan Stewart said that while he had great respect for Mr
Redwood he would be sticking with Mr Major in next week's ballot.
However, he added: ''If we were to get to another ballot with
different candidates -- and that in practical terms means a ballot
without John Major -- then obviously a whole range of different
considerations apply, but I haven't thought that far ahead.''
Mr Walker was among the Tory MPs who lined up behind Mr Redwood at his
resignation press conference. The Tayside North MP had made clear he did
not favour a mere stalking horse, but he considered Mr Redwood a serious
contender who could ''offer the intellectual leadership the party has
been lacking.''
He said afterwards: ''We learned at least two things. One, he has got
a sense of humour. Two, we have a high-quality candidate for the
leadership who I believe is capable of uniting the Conservative Party
and, even more important, is capable of defeating the Labour Party.''
Mr Walker said Mr Redwood would defend the Union as Mr Major had done.
''But because of his experience in Wales, he will be able to bring to
that task fresh qualities that expose Labour's badly-thought-out and
flawed plans for devolution.''
Mr Walker, a supporter of the idea of a Scottish Senate to take the
sting out of demands for a directly-elected assembly, later hinted that
Mr Redwood's constitutional agenda to be launched today would reflect
that.
''He knows that we have a problem that has to be addressed, a deficit
that exists in the eyes of the Scottish people, and unworkable proposals
of a kind that the Labour Party are bringing forward are not on the
agenda.
''But neither is doing nothing, and he understands that from his
experience in Wales. He can do what Margaret Thatcher did for us in
Scotland, get us from a very low position in the poll.''
The idea that Mr Redwood's Welsh experience would give him appeal here
was scorned by SNP leader Alex Salmond, who said the danger of a
stalking horse was that it could gain a lead and be difficult to catch.
He said Mr Redwood had made Wales a testbed for his theories of the
quango state and added that his intervention meant that John Major's
campaign was ''holed if not below the water then very close to the
water.''
Mr Salmond said the Major campaign had claimed over the weekend to
have the entire 1922 Committee and the whole Cabinet on board. Now that
this had been proved to be a lie, he said the re-election strategy was
in tatters.
He added that Scots MPs made up less than 3% of the Tory total. The
Scottish people should be allowed to vote in a General Election.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said: ''The Tories are
irreconcilably split from top to bottom on every issue and have
completely lost the trust of the Scottish people.
''While the Tories are tearing themselves apart, it is the country
that is suffering. Our country doesn't need a Tory leadership election.
It needs a General Election and a Labour Government.''

John Major's big gamble in the Tory party election rested on his
belief of a Cabinet united in support behind him. His new challenger has
blown that apart. analyses the new leadership odds
FOR the second time in six days Tory MPs have been forced to
contemplate the electoral abyss.
John Redwood has quit the Cabinet and stands against Mr Major on July
4 seeking to become the next Prime Minister. He has created an
eyeball-to-eyeball fight for the soul of the Tory party.
Last week the Prime Minister surprised everybody by resigning the Tory
leadership in the expectation that his Cabinet would back him 100% in
this ultimate attempt to confront the parliamentary party with reality.
Yesterday the gamble -- be it one of courage or folly -- was
transformed when the hard-right, Thatcherite, Welsh Secretary resigned
to challenge him. Today week the 328 Tory MPs, including the
contestants, will be faced with a stark choice about how they want the
Conservative Party presented to the electorate in two years' time -- if
they can last that long in Government.
Today, Mr Redwood will have a chance to present his policy on a wide
range of issues while the Prime Minister is still at the Cannes European
Summit. Yesterday, he surprised everybody at his launching press
conference by showing charm and wit as well as his celebrated intellect.
The Prime Minister shocked his party with last Thursday's challenge to
his critics to ''put up or shut up . . . I've had enough . . . I want it
sorted out once and for all.'' That challenge has now had its retort
from a man whom the Prime Minister thought was accepting Cabinet
collective solidarity. How does that change the situation on the Tory
benches at Westminster?
The various factions were holding frantic meetings to reassess the
situation. All of them noted that at Mr Redwood's side at his press
conference was Mr Norman Lamont, the former Chancellor who ran Mr
Major's leadership campaign in 1990.
The key question still is whether there will be enough abstentions on
July 4 to damage Mr Major sufficiently to force him out and enable other
rivals to enter the lists in a second ballot on July 11.
Both the Heseltine and the Portillo camps have some serious thinking
to do. Michael Portillo, the first choice darling of the Tory right (on
Europe and other matters) is spitting blood over Mr Redwood's audacity
in snatching the limelight in what is regarded as a dishonourable
manner. Cabinet Ministers are lining up to reveal how Mr Redwood has
double-crossed them and destroyed their first intention of backing the
Prime Minister solidly on July 4 and then be able to reassess the
situation after they had counted his first ballot support.
The key to the Redwood challenge is in the third and fourth paragraphs
of his resignation letter to the Prime Minister yesterday: ''On
Wednesday (last week) I came to see you. I offered you a number of ideas
to rebuild support for you in Parliament and for us in the country. I
explained how this could calm the present position and probably avoid
any challenge in the autumn.
''You did not hint at your intended course of action nor did you tell
us at Cabinet on Thursday. When I finally heard your plans from another
Minister I was devastated.'' Mr Major, who once described Mr Redwood as
one of the three ''bastards'' in his Cabinet, seems to have made the
same kind of fundamental error as Lady Thatcher in 1990 when she
underestimated totally the strength of feeling against her.
Sir Edward Heath made the same mistake in 1975 when she came from
nowhere to topple him.
After Mr Redwood's press conference yesterday, Tory MPs on all sides
were beginning to think that Mr Redwood may have been under-estimated as
a potential leader.
The Major campaign team had been saying in the morning, after Mr
Redwood's resignation, that the team slogan was: ''Save the earth, vote
human.'' It was a mood-music remark intended to denigrate Mr Redwood,
whose cold-eyed, Fellow of All Souls, Oxford, ideological academic
approach to politics has won him his Star Trek soubriquet.
After the Redwood press conference the analogy looked a bit feeble. As
the day progressed the Major team's immediate analysis of the changed
situation was also looking a bit questionable.
However, Mr Redwood could blow it all if his policy proposals today
look too much like the Tory answer to the US Republican Congressional
leader, Mr Newt Gingrich.
The Major camp believes that Mr Redwood's hair-raising ideas -- some
of which even Lady Thatcher rejected when he headed her policy unit --
will frighten the life out of the Tories and ensure a Major victory on
July 4. They believe that Mr Portillo's supporters will not vote for Mr
Redwood in their outrage that he should try to usurp the right-wing
mantle when Mr Portillo has denied it to himself.
The Major camp is also arguing hard that the tricky question of
abstentions has now gone away. They claim it is going to be a straight
heavyweight fight which Mr Major is bound to win more convincingly than
he might have if he had faced only a stalking horse candidate like Mr
Lamont.
But the Portillo supporters were showing signs of disagreeing with
this analysis. They are now pondering a situation in which they might
support Mr Redwood in order to force a second ballot which their man
could enter, along with, of course, Mr Michael Heseltine. By tomorrow
night the Portillo people may adopt this policy unless they believe that
Mr Major can humiliate the upstart Redwood.
Lady Thatcher was thought to be committed to Mr Major, as was Lord
Tebbit who attended Mr Redwood's press conference yesterday as a
watchful observer. Both believe that neither Mr Portillo nor Mr Redwood
should be exposed too soon to leadership, for fear that they would get
chewed up by Tory back benchers, much like John Major in 1990.
The Euro-sceptics were meeting last night to try to decide what to do
about the Redwood challenge. Some of them are already committed --
Bernard Jenkins, and John Biffen -- publicly to the Major camp. Others
like Richard Shepherd are Heseltine supporters.
The Euro-philes are in as much disarray, although they will probably
take their lead from Sir Edward Heath who went out of his way on
breakfast television yesterday to denigrate Mr Redwood as a man to unite
the party. But they also are tempted by a situation that might allow Mr
Heseltine into the action in a second ballot. In order to achieve this
they might have to steel themselves to vote for Mr Redwood -- which in
their opinion is like a turkey voting for Christmas -- or resort to
massive abstention on July 4.
The middle-of-the-road Tory back bencher is totally bemused about
everything except the inevitability of his telephone constantly ringing
to engage his support for the various camps.
It will take several days before the Westminster party gets anywhere
near sorting itself out. Mr Redwood, irritatingly out of touch all
weekend, eventually phoned the Prime Minister at 9.30 yesterday morning.
The conversation, not yet revealed, is described only as ''short and to
the point'' by Downing Street. Mr Redwood, like Mr Major, has staked his
career on the leadership issue -- and that is a gutsy factor that could
dominate the voting on July 4.

Madrid
A BRITISH animal rights campaigner was yesterday gravely ill in a
Spanish hospital after being gored 11 times by a bull.
The head of intensive care at a hospital in Caceres, near the
Portuguese frontier, Dr Jose Raimundo Garcia, said Mrs Vicki Moore was
on a respirator and her condition remained ''stable but very serious''
after almost six hours of surgery.
He said that she had a punctured lung but the bull's horns had not
penetrated her stomach wall. She also had injuries on her face and upper
body and had fractured ribs.
Mrs Moore, 39, of Southport, Merseyside, was on an under-cover mission
at the remote village of Coria with a team from Carlton Television.
She had made several previous trips to the summer fiesta in Coria, in
which bulls are run through the streets for several hours and pelted
with sharp paper darts fired from blow-pipes before being eventually
shot.
Well known to villagers and resented for her attempts to have the
fiesta banned, Mrs Moore had dyed her black hair blonde and was using a
false identity as a Scotswoman named Lucille Eva Valentine Hayward.
She was using a video camera to film an encierro, a miniature version
of the Pamplona festival in which the town centre is barricaded off and
bulls let loose so that local youths can test their nerve by taunting
the animals and running in front of them.
After booking into the Hotel Los Kekes she set about her mission on
Sunday afternoon watched over by the TV unit.
She was in the fenced-off maze of narrow streets when the bull caught
her. She was repeatedly tossed on its horns before the enraged animal
was lured away to allow fiesta organisers to carry her to safety.
She was taken to the local Red Cross post and then rushed by ambulance
to Caceres where a team of surgeons were on standby.
A police officer said: ''This woman is lucky to be alive. The bull
would not leave her alone, ravishing her with his horns, tossing her in
the air, and twice hurling her against the fencing.''
Yesterday, Jose Sanchez, owner of the 22-room Los Kekes told how Mrs
Moore had booked in alone using the false name, which he insisted was on
a passport which she produced.
He said: ''She left her bag in her room, but of course did not return.
We gave it to the police who handed it over to a man called Thomas
Anthony Rhys, from Carlton Television.
''The accident is the talk of the village. She took a big risk to get
as near as she did to make her video. Many who saw what happened were
amazed that she survived. Usually a bull makes one swipe with its horns
and then thunders on. This animal continued to attack for what seemed an
eternity, although I suppose it was only for a few seconds.''
Her husband, Tony, 50, said yesterday before leaving for Spain to be
at her bedside today: ''I don't know exactly how the accident happened.
''Vicki was not trying to disrupt the fiesta. She was merely observing
and taking pictures. Her ribs were pierced and a lung was punctured. No
other vital organs, nor her spine have been damaged.''
He added: ''She is on the critical list, but her condition is
stable.''
A former actress, Mrs Moore has devoted years to exposing cruelty to
animals at Spanish fiestas. She has been threatened several times by
villagers and run out of town. Police often had to protect her.
Some years ago she bought two young goats which had been tossed into a
tarpaulin from a church tower at a village in north-west Spain, and took
them to an animal sanctuary on the Costa Brava.
The campaigner, who has made Coria one of her main targets, has seen
many acts of cruelty banned because of her efforts.
Her most famous exploit was to take Blackie the donkey to a Devon
sanctuary after a European campaign to save him. At another Spanish
village fiesta, Blackie was ridden through the streets by youths until
he collapsed.
An official at the Animal Defence Association in Madrid said: ''Vicki
is well known to us. She is an extremely brave woman and we are all
praying that she will make a full recovery.''

JOHN Redwood's wife Gail is certain to have been involved, discreetly,
in her husband's secret weekend decision to stand against John Major.
Gail Redwood, a striking contrast to Norma Major, whom she could now
supplant as chatelaine at No. 10, is a consummate professional career
woman in her own right.
Mrs Redwood, a barrister, was company secretary of British Airways,
the senior administrative officer of the world's biggest airline, until
last year, when she reverted to the post of part-time deputy secretary.
At the top of one of the world's most successful companies, she has
been accustomed to giving advice on strategic decisions at the highest
level.
None of those decisions, however, could have had such profound
implications for her private life as that which her husband took over
the weekend.
Colleagues at BA say she is a ''very private person. She does not
court publicity -- very much the opposite''.
Now, the votes of a handful of Tory MPs could propel her into the
national and international political limelight at her husband's side.
Mrs Redwood is used to holding her own in powerful circles, but her
role in political life has until now been in the back room.
As a commercial lawyer, her professional and personal networks are,
like those of her husband, in the City.
But she is also a political animal whose views are very much in line
with those of her husband.
Mrs Redwood regularly took time off from her job at BA to spend time
with her husband at the annual Tory party conference.
The image-makers may have their work cut out if they are to round off
the edges of John Redwood's public persona -- but former colleagues at
BA say his wife was well liked, as well as very good at her job.
She is said to have made few enemies in the high-pressure, highly
political world at the top of a major company.
Acquaintances described her as ''reasonably up-market without being
snobby; well-spoken but not plummy -- and very smiley''.
However, like her husband, she is said not to suffer fools gladly, and
to have little time for small talk.
Mrs Redwood, who is in her mid-40s, exhibits little personal vanity:
She is allowing her blonde hair to turn naturally grey, and wears little
make-up.
The couple married in 1974 and have two children, Catherine, 16, and
Richard 13.
Like her husband, Gail Redwood was educated at Oxford, where she
graduated with a degree in jurisprudence. She then went on to join the
Bar.
She joined the Civil Aviation Authority in 1972 as first assistant and
then deputy secretary, working latterly as legal adviser.
