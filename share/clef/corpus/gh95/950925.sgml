SNP leader Alex Salmond sent delegates home from their conference in
Perth with a final plea for them to make the party an open, inclusive
organisation which welcomes in everyone with Scotland's interests at
heart.
In his summing up, he told delegates that the highlights of the week
for him had been to welcome the new grouping, Scots Asians for
Independence, into the fold. He also welcomed the setting up of the
party's new business group and pointed out that the SNP had been the
only political party to welcome in a group of trade unionists from
Customs who were worried by the impact of cutbacks in their numbers.
He repeated, also, the party's strong opposition to nuclear weapons
which they feel gives them a unique perspective in mainstream UK
politics, typical of where they find themselves on many issues now --
radical compared to the London-based parties but in tune with what they
call ''mainstream Scotland''.
The final day's business saw the conference pass a series of motions
attacking Government policies which condemn students to poverty and
long-term debt. There was also a motion on privatising Scottish Nuclear
and an emergency motion on proposals for Dounreay to handle
international waste for reprocessing.
SNP president Winnie Ewing, who very comfortably saw off a challenge
to her presidency, told the conference in her address that Scotland had
been ''smeared with the rottenness of the selfish South'', as a result
of the Union.
She added: ''We are bound in a partnership which has opted out from
European social policy. The UK is a banana monarchy where our cheap
labour is meant to attract industry, which still seems to prefer setting
up in Ireland.''

CELTIC have approached Liverpool in a bid to bring veteran striker Ian
Rush to Parkhead.
They side are ready to fork out almost #1m for the 34-year-old front
man who has been unable to hold a first-team place at Anfield since the
arrival of Stan Collymore, writes KEN GALLACHER.
Celtic desperately seek a penalty box player who can add the killer
touch to their clever outfield play and manager Tommy Burns is ready to
gamble on the Welsh international.
Rush could be signed in time for the second Old Firm clash at Parkhead
this weekend.
In the meantime, Burns yesterday insisted he had never asked John
Collins' agent to find a buyer for the Scotland star.
In a television interview Burns stressed: ''The agent spoke to me two
weeks before the Scottish Cup Final and asked if we would be prepared to
sell John Collins.
''In a reply which was completely hypothetical, I pointed out that we
wanted to bring in more quality players. If, in doing that, we required
further financing then it was possible we would sell John. But, at no
time, was it suggested that he should find a buying club.'' Burns then
went on to point out: ''A few weeks back, the player's agent told Mr
McCann that John wanted to leave the club. I asked John if it was
worthwhile putting together a signing package if he was going to leave.
He told me there was no point in putting anything together because this
was not just about money.''
* MANCHESTER United will provide the opposition for Paul McStay's
testimonial. Alex Ferguson's side will travel to Celtic Park on
Wednesday, December 13 to mark McStay's 14 years with the club.

RANGERS' captain Richard
Gough, the outstanding outfield player at Ibrox this season, may miss
the Champions' League clash with Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday.
The central defender took a kick on the shin in the 1-0 defeat from
Hibs at the weekend and spent Saturday night in hospital because of
internal bleeding in the leg.
Manager Walter Smith explained yesterday: ''Richard spent the night in
hospital mainly as a precaution. The doctor wanted him to keep his leg
raised because of the internal bleeding.
''He went back home this morning and is OK, but he remains very
doubtful for the game. It will be a last minute decision because the leg
is still very painful.''
Left back David Robertson is another player who will face a late
fitness test on the hamstring he damaged in the Old Firm game. Central
defender Alan McLaren and midfielder Stuart McCall are both already
ruled out.
The only good news Smith could provide yesterday was that Charlie
Miller, injured against Hibs, and Ian Ferguson, who has been out since
the start of the season, will be ready.
Said Smith: ''Charlie has an ankle knock, but he will be OK and, while
I left Ian Ferguson out of the Hibs' game, he is fit.''
Smith saw the opposition defeat Eintracht Frankfurt 4-3 on Friday
night. That was the second time in under a week they had lost three
goals. In their other game they won 6--3.
Says Smith: ''German football, as you would imagine from these score
lines is very open. Borussia look very good going forward. From midddle
to front they have exceptional players and Matthias Sammer and Andy
Moeller are magnificent.
''What we don't know yet is how they will approach an away game in the
Champions' League and how much they will adjust defensively, if at
all.''
Smith maintains that he will not be rushing into the transfer market
after the sale of Mark Hateley to Queens Park Rangers for close to #1.5m
is completed in London today.

UEFA have confirmed the three-year European ban on Dynamo Kiev for
attempting to bribe a referee prior to their recent Champions' League
match against Panathinaikos in Kiev.
The board of appeal also stuck by a life ban on Vasyl Babychuk,
Dynamo's vice-president and general manager, and club board member Igor
Surkis. Danish champions Aalborg -- beaten Kiev in the preliminary round
-- replace Dynamo in the Champions' League.

REGAL MASTERS SNOOKER:
WORLD champion Stephen Hendry kept the fans happy in Motherwell Civic
Centre yesterday when he won the Regal Masters for the third time,
beating tenacious Peter Ebdon by 9-5 in the final.
''It's the only major event north of the Border so obviously, being
Scottish, I get great joy from winning it,'' said Hendry.
He expressed his disappointment at having failed to win the title
since 1990, although he did get to the final last year, but pointed out
that the event always contained an elite field of the best players in
the world.
''It has been frustrating to go out in the first round when I'm trying
to prove myself in front of my home crowd,'' said Hendry. But he was
pleased to have played like a world champion this weekend in front of a
Scottish audience.
The final was not Hendry at his very best, but he is usually too good
for anyone else in the world, even when he steps down a gear.
Until his winning clearance of 98 in the fourteenth frame, his highest
break in the match had been an 82 in the second frame, but he was able
at least to score consistently enough to collect the #55,000 winner's
cheque and regain the trophy which he first won in the inaugural year
and defended successfully in 1990.
Ebdon said: ''Stephen played tremendously well and thoroughly deserved
to win. But I have the saving grace of knowing that I'm capable of
beating the best player in the world, as I have done in the past, and
I'm very proud of that.''
Ebdon overcame the psychological blow of having led in the second
frame with a break of 57 only to lose it and go 2-0 down. The
25-year-old battled back to lead 3-2, although he finished the session
with the deficit back to two frames at 5-3 in Hendry's favour.
The Englishman began his recovery with a break of 114 and followed
that with half-centuries on either side of the interval. But he must
have been dismayed to watch Hendry seize no more than a half-chance to
conclude the sixth frame and finish his afternoon's work with breaks of
57 and 67.
The Scot produced breaks of 41, 30, 59, and 60 as he marched on to a
daunting lead of 8-3. But the world No.10 clearly was not going to be
content with the #27,000 cheque as runner-up and cut the arrears to 8-5.
However, he could do nothing when Hendry stepped in with a clearance to
the pink of 98 to clinch the first major title of the season.
Hendry reached two milestones during his 6-2 demolition of Darren
Morgan in Saturday night's semi-final. The world champion compiled a run
of 129 in the second frame for the 300th century of a remarkable career,
and surpassed that as the highest break of the tournament with 136 in
the next.
Further frame-winning efforts of 77, 91, and 116 were interrupted only
in the sixth frame and Hendry sealed victory with a run of 56 in the
eighth.
Earlier, Ebdon had beaten teenager Ronnie O'Sullivan 6-1 in his semi.

PORTUGUESE GRAND PRIX
PROMISE turned into sweet reality in Estoril yesterday when David
Coulthard won the Portuguese Grand Prix, his first Formula 1 triumph,
and possibly his only one in the livery of Williams Renault, who have
decided that the Scottish driver was surplus to requirements.
That decision, born of political and financial requirements rather
than ability, may come back to haunt the Didcot team now that Coulthard
has come of age.
A season which started with Coulthard fuelled by great promise and
expectation slowed dramatically as his car ground to a halt five times
because of mechanical failure, and a pit-lane speeding penalty at
Silverstone in July when he was in a winning position left many
believing the fates were conspiring against him, and others convinced he
didn't have what it takes.
Starting in pole position for the third time, Coulthard became the
first Scot to triumph in Formula 1 since Jackie Stewart's victory at the
Nurburgring in 1973.
The 24-year-old from Twynholm finished just more than seven seconds in
front of defending world champion Michael Shumacher and Williams
team-mate Damon Hill, whose race strategy yesterday virtually ended his
championship challenge. He is now 17 points behind Schumacher with four
races remaining, and the 34-year-old Englishman said: ''It would take a
miracle now for me to beat Michael.''
However, Coulthard now knows he has the necessary qualities to succeed
at the top of his sport. His first win after half-a-dozen podium places
in 21 races will top up his confidence, which must have been drained
slightly because of the problems which have beset his first full season
in Formula 1.
There may have been times this season when he was unhappy about the
preparation of his car, but he was anxious to make sure everyone knew
his win was the result of a team effort, and there was a touch of
poignancy about the warm greeting afforded him by Schumacher at the end
of the race, because the German has made no secret of his desire to have
Coulthard with him in the Ferarri team next season.
Coulthard was asked yesterday if he knew who he would be racing for
next term and said: ''Yes.'' When asked if he would say who will be
employing him he replied: ''No. I'll tell you next week.''
The likelihood is, however, that he will be driving for McLaren,
especially after Alain Prost announced yesterday that he will not be
racing for that team next season.
Coulthard's right arm snaked out of the cockpit to wave to the fans,
and among them were his mother and father. ''This means more to them
than me, said Coulthard. ''They do not come to every race so it was
great for them to be here.
''In a way it is what I am here to do. But they have been trekking up
and down from Scotland ever since I was 11. My father will use this as
an excuse for getting drunk over the next few months.
''Ever since I was young, even before I started karting, I always
imagined what it would be like to be a grand prix driver and to win. Now
I know what it's like to win.
''It's an amazingly warm feeling inside when you succeed. With 10 laps
to go I was not under a lot of pressure from Michael (Schumacher) and
Damon (Hill) but it was the hardest part of the race.
''Over the last few laps I kept thinking something might go wrong as
it has in the past. I did not know what to do. I wanted to talk to the
team but thought I would tempt fate. I did not talk until I came out of
the last corner, then just swore.''
Coulthard planned to celebrate his victory with his parents and model
girlfriend Andrea, quipping: ''I think I am on a promise.''
The Williams team had decided to play safe by not using the revised
FW17B which had dominated qualifying because of reliability fears, and
that decisilon was justified with Coulthard and Hill finishing, although
the latter's strategy was wrong.
By the time the top three emerged from the first series of pit stops,
Coulthard held a five seconds advantage and refuelling difficulties with
Hill's team dropped him back to fourth place.
He was held up by Jean Alesi, and by the time Hill went past he was 20
seconds behind his team-mate and 15 off of Schumacher. Hill hit the
front when Coulthard and Schumacher made their second stops, but the
Englishman went in seven laps later, banking on a two-stop strategy,
which failed.
0 The irony of an afternoon during which Hill's championship challenge
disintegrated as his team-mate for not very much longer got it
absolutely right, was not lost on any of the top three finishers, but
showing a gracious side which is not always evident Hill said: ''Today
is David's day. After a lot of near misses he has done a great job.''
The race was only seconds old when it was brought to a halt after the
Tyrell of Japanese driver Ukyo Katayama flipped off the front of Luca
Badoer's Minardi and crashed into a steel fence in front of the
grandstand before stopping in a twisted wreck.
The 32-year-old's was rushed to hospital, but bulletins said he was
suffering no real physical damage. Leading placings

MONEY is the root of all evil. That was the proposition which it was
my task to oppose at the Hawick High School debating club more years ago
that I now care to remember. We won, and the motion was defeated.
More than a quarter of a century down the line, the concept that
filthy lucre corrupts everything it touches takes on a fresh
significance in this game of ours.
Last week, I spent three or four hours in the company of Geordie
millionaire Sir John Hall. He had just signed up Rob Andrew, at well
over #100,000 a year, as the first step towards his five-year vision of
making Newcastle-Gosforth the best rugby club in Europe.
Hall turns out to be a hugely engaging personality with a wallet to
match. Money talks and on Tyneside it is now screaming from the
rooftops. The message is that Hall and Andrew have access to funds which
no side in Britain can match.
He set out his store quite candidly. He expects the professional game
to be run by the professionals and he expects, too, that this will place
the new professional clubs on a collision course with the game's
administrators.
He has his eyes set firmly on Europe and the new European championship
and, importantly, the revenue (TV rights and all the rest) which will
accrue.
Already in England the top clubs -- Newcastle-Gosforth were not
included and this rankles with Hall -- have set up their own limited
company but are in dispute with the Rugby Football Union, over
legitimised payments to club players and the ruling which limits
recruitment of non-Englishmen to club ranks.
Probably, now that the game is on the brink of professionalism, the
legislation which the RFU wants to impose is illegal in terms of
restraint of trade and Twickenham would be on a loser if the issue went
to court.
However, at the heart of the matter is money. TV broadcasting
contracts are negotiated at national level by the Home Unions. Over the
weekend, it emerged that England will once again demand a bigger slice
of the #37m BBC, BSkyB deal when it comes up for renegotiation in two
years' time. Even that hoary old chestnut of the Five Nations'
tournament being threatened popped up again.
However, and important though it is, that is very much a sideshow to
the real issue which is that with professional clubs playing in a
lucrative European competition (it starts this winter with Scotland and
England coming in next season) the clubs want a bigger slice of the TV
cake and they want a much greater say in the negotiations which will
lead to the Euro TV deal.
''The professional game must be run by professionals and we demand a
measure of control for the cash that we are putting into the game,''
says Hall. Although he has, thus far, been excluded from the
machinations of the top 10 clubs which comprise the top echelon of the
English game, they are all reading from the same hymn sheet.
They say that when England sneezes, Scotland catches a cold and there
are, indeed, echoes of the English experience here in Scotland. It was
evident at the SRU annual meeting in June that the clubs feel isolated
from the Murrayfield decision-making process.
Their feeling of isolation has not been helped by Jim Telfer's
forcefully expressed view that, come next year, Scotland will be
represented in Europe by districts and not clubs.
In a playing sense he is, of course, right. A properly prepared
Edinburgh, or Glasgow, or the South could probably give the opposition a
run for their money.
And money is what it is all about. Ambitious clubs like Watsonians and
Melrose fancy their chances in Europe and they certainly fancy some of
the sponsorship and TV cash that would come their way.
Sometimes the worst thing that can happen is that you have your wish
granted. Let this season's champions and runners-up fly the flag for
Scotland in Europe next season and, very soon we fear, the validity of
Telfer's beefed-up districts concept will be there for all to see.

Boroughmuir 10, Stirling County 16
BACK to basics, boys, was the message that County coach Brian Edwards
has been drumming into his charges these past few weeks as the sky
threatened to cave in at Bridgehaugh and the champions began their
embarrassing tumble from cloud nine.
Basic instincts were well to the fore at Meggetland on Saturday as
County ground out a convincing win over championship contenders
Boroughmuir. There was no Sharon Stone and the only appendages being
crossed and uncrossed, alluringly or otherwise, were the fingers of the
Stirling faithful desperate as they were to breath life into a comatose
premiership campaign and to set themselves up for the show game against
the Barbarians tomorrow.
There were still lapses in concentration which allowed Boroughmuir
back into the game but, overall, the strategy of keeping it simple and
building a winning platform one step at a time offered glimpses, but no
more than that, of the form which secured the championship last season.
However, the most difficult area for a coach to have any influence
over is the four inches above the players' eyes and, in this regard,
Saturday's win will have served as a wonderful tonic against the
corrosive mind-set of defeat, a factor which Edwards was quick to
acknowledge afterwards.
''That's taken some of the pressure off. We've now got a couple of
wins under our belts and with Heriot's at home on Saturday a win there
would mean that we would be better placed to battle it out with the top
dogs,'' he said.
The return after injury of Kenny Harper at scrum half was one of the
main factors in the upturn in County fortunes.
Murray Fraser has the look of a handy enough footballer but he is not
a scrum half and one of the main beneficiaries of Harper's reappearance
was stand-off Mark McKenzie.
He still took the occasional wrong option but looked more comfortable
on Saturday than he has done since the season began three weeks ago.
Both sides suffered last-minute changes in personnel. John Manson
damaged his back at training on Thursday and John Gibson took over at
loose-head prop.
For Boroughmuir, Graeme Beveridge was suffering from a poisoned heel
and was replaced by Stuart Thom.
That was a pity because I, for one, was looking forward to watching
the Scotland under-19 scrum half perform at this level.
He was one of the success stories in Bucharest back in the spring when
Scotland competed in the FIRA junior world cup tournament and, at the
risk of blighting a promising career, I'll warrant that one day he will
play for Scotland.
A player at the opposite end of the playing spectrum is Boroughmuir's
Sean Lineen.
What a miss he is going to be at Meggetland whenever he decides to
hang up the boots for good. On Saturday he was, invariably, at the heart
of all that was good about Boroughmuir.
The devilish Meggetland wind, blowing hither in the lee of the stand
and tither on the opposite side of the pitch, conspired to produce a
game which lacked discernable pattern.
Both fly halves harnessed it well in turn, McKenzie the more so in the
second period when Stirling exerted more control and by which time they
had got their lineout sorted out.
McKenzie, it was, who kicked Stirling into a six-point lead with
penalty goals in 12 and 20 minutes. Boroughmuir clawed back three points
after 25 minutes with an Andy Knight penalty goal.
However, County reached the turn with a six-point cushion after
McKenzie's third successful penalty goal on the stroke of half-time.
It followed a disallowed try by Harper, the scrum half capitalising on
a lineout breakaway by Gareth Flockhart -- making a convincing return as
a replacement for the injured Brough -- but the ball was spilled in the
act of touching down.
Ian Jardine put Stirling further ahead with a try after 57 minutes
when he found himself, unaccountably, in the clear and, with Boroughmuir
defenders conspicuously absent, he dotted down under the posts for
McKenzie to stroke over the simplest of conversions.
County indiscipline and wandering minds allowed Boroughmuir back into
the game seven minutes from the end when Laird's penalty kick took
Boroughmuir to a lineout five metres out. Darren Burns tapped for Wright
and from the ruck Stuart Reid charged over for a try which Knight
converted.
A win for County, then, and a desperately needed one at that.
Tomorrow's game against the Barbarians, however welcome it might be,
is but a gilt-edged distraction from real world and only by their
efforts against Heriot's on Saturday will we be able to answer the
question of whether or not they are back where they hope they belong.
Boroughmuir -- D MacRae; D A Stark, D Laird, S R P Lineen, A R McLean;

WOMEN'S HOCKEY
WESTERN Klick Photopoint edged Bonagrass Grove and Edinburgh Ladies
out of the first division title on goal difference last season and,
judging by their performances yesterday, all three should figure in the
championship race again -- and Hyndland may play a key role in the
proceedings, writes Joseph Dillon.
They were all involved in draws yesterday at Forthbank, but in the
final analysis Western and Edinburgh will be the teams most disappointed
at not taking more from their confrontations.
Western's demise came in their confrontation with Grove. Player-coach
Wendy Fraser had the misfortune to rattle the woodwork early in the game
with a penalty and then the Glasgow side twice had to hit back with
scores from Fraser and Sheena McKelvie to nullify goals from Nikki
Klepplang and Pauline Robertson to secure their point.
Edinburgh, too, squandered a first-half penalty against Hyndland.
Morven McLeod, the Hyndland goalkeeper, had no difficulty in saving
Janet Jack's miscued effort. The capital girls were on the offensive for
most of the game and from early on a scoreless draw looked inevitable.
Menzieshill made their first division debut in brilliant style,
beating Broughmuir 7-0 with Sarah Chalmers and Lynda Thom sharing four
of their goals. Results:
Saturday. National League: Division 2 -- Melrose Croall Bryson 1,
Aberdeen Bon Accord 0; Carmuirs 1, Stepps 4. Division 3 -- Hillhead 3,
Hyndland A 1; Hutchesons' FP 0, Trinity 2; Gymnasts A 0, Grove A 0;
Perthshire 3, Central Wanderers 1. Division 4 -- Highland 3, Grange A 1;
Stepps A 0, Dumfries 2.
Yesterday. Division 1 -- Western Klick Photopoint 2, Bonagrass Grove

SHINTY
INVERARAY passed their stiffest test of the season so far when they
took a point off reigning league champions Kingussie at the Winterton.
The result, which allows Kingussie to retain their top spot in the new
premier league, means that Inveraray maintain their unbeaten record and
have taken points off all four north teams in the division.
It was the second week running Kingussie had gone behind, but it took
the young Inveraray team an hour to get ahead. When the goal came, it
was almost inevitably from the caman of Garry MacPherson, who will play
in Scotland's under-21 international against Ireland at Fort William on
Saturday. When the equaliser came, 10 minutes from time, it was equally
inevitably from goal machine Ronald Ross.
Inveraray are in third place having taken five points from a possible
eight.
Fort William stay in second place following their draw at Oban
Camanachd. The home side took the lead through Duncan Gibson in five
minutes. It took Fort William until 50 minutes to level.
Oban Camanachd's Gordon MacIntyre, who lost an eye in an accident when
playing a week ago, continues to recover in hospital in Inverness. He's
due to get home this week and has been invited to Saturday's
international by the Camanachd Association.
Newtonmore's dismal form continues with a home defeat against Glasgow
Mid Argyll. It will not have helped Newtonmore's distress about their
poor form that the winner, in 25 minutes, came from former Kingussie
player Kevin Thain.
In the other premier league match, Glenurquhart made better use of the
elements against Oban Celtic at Drumnadrochit and the Oban side plunged
to their fourth successive defeat. Peter MacDonald scored a goal in each
half in the Glen's emphatic 3-0 victory.

Hawick 17, Watsonians 33
THEY were the Kings of the Scottish game, the town the Queen o' a' the
Borders, the club the Rangers of rugby. From season 1973/74 onwards, the
start of the official championship, Hawick won five titles in a row and,
though their domination diminished, they have still added another five
since then. A Scotland team without a Hawick man was like a Welsh side
without an Evans.
Today Hawick prop up the first division. Tony Stanger might still find
a place in the Scotland back division but not at centre where he wants
to play. There is no-one else remotely challenging.
It has to be said -- Hawick are in the greater danger of disappearing
down the relegation plug than at any time in their history. And they
know it.
''I'm not going to scream at these laddies,'' said the backs' coach,
Jim Renwick. ''They are trying their best and they need time to
develop.''
In the new helter-skelter championship, time is a luxury no-one can
buy.
For their part, Watsonians shrugged off the mauling from Melrose the
previous week and displayed the kind of form which makes their coach,
Peter Gallagher, amused and bemused at the same time.
''When they are good, they are brilliant, when they are bad . . .''
and he didn't have to finish it.
Watsonians should have won by more than 50 points and they might kick
themselves if they are pipped at the post by a superior differential.
The warming factor for them was the exciting forward play of Tom Smith
and Gordon Hannah.
Smith is the steal of the season. He came from Dundee High and, in his
new coach's words, ''is a prop who can run like a winger and handle like
a fly half.''
Can he prop? ''He is improving the technical side of his game all the
time.''
And, significantly, no doubt, Alan Kittle, who has fallen out
seriously with Stewart's Melville, travelled to Hawick on the Watsonians
bus. If he joins, and he is perfectly free to play for a first division
club in the championship, the front row riches will increase.
Hannah, the No.8, twice sprinted the length of the field, leaving the
home back division as spectators. The first time he was denied a try
when replacement referee Jim Fleming decided that Scott Hastings' mighty
punt had rolled over the dead-ball line.
''It was definitely in play,'' declared Hannah, and Gallagher cited an
impartial witness: ''A wee Hawick man told me it was a try.'' He wasn't
going to leave his name, mind you.
Hannah, not to be denied, hurtled out of the twenty-two again,
goose-stepped through three tackles, and claimed the try he deserved.
Mr Fleming, as is his wont, took the ribbing in good heart. For
reasons that escape me -- wouldn't he be better employed in the second
division when exchange refs come up? -- our No.1 whistler started as a
touch judge. Just after half-time Huw Lewis, of Bridgend, succumbed to a
groin injury and Jim took over.
The gale, straight down the pitch, bent the flags into paper-clip
mould. ''At least,'' observed Renwick wryly, ''we should manage into
their half at some stage.''
They did indeed, with Colin Turnbull slotting four penalties.
Significantly, however, Watsonians scored the tries.
The first was made for Jamie Weston by a Hannah break, the second for
Fergus Henderson when Gavin Hastings, enjoying himself hugely, entered
the line. Duncan Hodge managed a penalty goal so the visitors led by a
single point at the turn.
Now with the wind, Watsonians would surely cut loose. No, they moved
into their irritating mode and frittered away good possession for a
while.
Eventually, a Hodge dropped goal was followed by a try from John Kerr.
Smith then sold deft dummies for an outrageous try, converted by Hodge,
before Hannah closed the visiting account.
Hawick, for whom Jim Hay and skipper Brian Renwick had toiled
mightily, managed a late try by Cameron Murray. In scoring he damaged a
shoulder, the kind of luck that is dogging the Greens right now.

MEN'S HOCKEY:
TOUCHE Ross Gordonians, with new coach Jimmy Cox at the helm, have
finally begun to fulfill their potential in the league. They went top of
the table on Saturday by beating Western 3-1 and are beginning to reap
the rewards of their professional approach.
Richard Freeland, however, confessed after the game: ''We were
fortunate to take all three points for Western had more of the
pressure.''
But Cox remarked: ''This is a match in the past Gordonians might have
lost, but the players now have a better attitude and it should bring
them success.''
Western showed a lack of discipline, twice being penalised for stick
tackling in the circle. They were punished each time by Phil Webster,
who converted the resulting strokes.
Defending champions Grange kept on the trail of Gordonians with a 2-1
victory at Maryfield against Menzieshill. Donald MacFarlane netted their
winner 10 minutes from time after Andy McBride had put him through.
In the relegation zone, Pender Uddingston suffered considerable pain
against Torbrex Wanderers, who crushed them 11-0. MIM are also
struggling, going down 6-1 at Kelburne and have now conceded 10 goals in
just two games. Results:

Heriot's FP 59, Gala 10
PAST form, it seems, is proving an unreliable guide to the Tennents
championship. Having suffered heavy defeats in successive games against
Watsonians and Edinburgh Academicals, Heriot's confounded their
faithless by running up a seven-try tally and the highest division one
score this season.
Rarely has one seen a Heriot's side with the killer instinct to put
the opposition to the sword. But that is exactly what Heriot's, after a
cautious start, achieved, their pursuit of points amply illustrated when
Terry Rahui was asked to kick at goal with the scoreline at 49-10.
Rahui's kicking generated 24 points but his contribution was
considerably more. Notably the quickness of pass off the wrist allowing
his centres to operate in generous quantities of space and time. The
principal beneficiary of Heriot's decision to move the ball wide was
Gordon Lawrie, who, helped by playing alongside Tony Glasgow, seemed to
rediscover the confidence of his earlier years in a fine display of
incisive running that was rewarded with two tries.
There were two-try contributions also from Campbell Aitken, a late
replacement for Hugh Gilmour on the right wing, and David Officer, whose
brace of touchdowns in the last eight minutes of the first half
effectively turned the game for Heriot's at a period in the match when
59 points were the stuff of dreams.
The powerfully built Officer, who played at full back for Edinburgh
University and Scottish Universities before arriving at Goldenacre this
season, not only looked utterly dependable in defence but, crucially,
provided the kind of intrusive, thrustful running in midfield that
ensured the gain line was breached and, in turn, quick ruck ball
recycled by Heriot's eager forwards.
In fact, the Heriot's pack was more then eager. Having been subdued by
Edinburgh Academicals a week earlier, the forwards got their act
together in the lineout to achieve parity and in the loose play, where
Graham Dall and Tam McVie excelled, the home eight always looked
sharper.
Mercifully, the second half was not all one-way action as Gala ran in
two tries, the first inspired by Mark Moncrieff's ability to beat
opponents in a run out of defence and finished by Brian Swan, and the
second a close-range score by Matthias Stolz from Robert Hogg's pass.
But, by then it was too late for Gala, who, without John Amos, appeared
much slower about the field and who, crucially, failed to snap up early
scoring chances. Goldenacre has been an unhappy course for Gala in
recent seasons. On Saturday they again finished second but on this
occasion by more than a short head.
Heriot's FP -- D Officer; C Aitken, G Lawrie, A Glasgow, P Smith; T
Rahui, F McMillan; J Bryce, K Milne, S Paul, P Young, C Humphries, S
Elliot, T McVie, G Dall.
Gala -- M Changleng; M Moncrieff, M Stumbles, B Swan, S Paterson; D
Changleng, D Boland; G Isaac, I Corcoran, H Hunter, R Hogg, M Stoltz, N

BOWLS:
SCOTLAND enjoyed a great day yesterday when the Saga International
Open got under way in Preston's Guildhall with all four Scots involved
in the opening day's matches winning through to the second round.
Alex Marshall set the ball rolling yesterday morning when he needed
just eight ends to complete a 7-1, 7-2 win over former British champion
Jeremy Henry.
Scottish champion Paul Conlan then joined him in the last 16 when he
sent No.5 seed Mervyn King tumbling to defeat. Conlan hit back from 5-6
down with a ninth-end double to take the opening set 7-6 and then
coasted through the second 7-1 in just six ends.
The run of Scottish victories continued when Willie Wood beat John
Price in straight sets. Wood counted singles on the sixth and seventh
ends of the opening set for a 7-4 win and then repeated that scoreline
in the second, starting the set with a maximum count of 4.
David Gourlay then added the icing to the cake when he beat the
highly-rated Australian Cameron Curtis. Gourlay took the opening set
7-1, lost the second 6-7, but dominated the decider and ran out a 7-2
winner.
Australia did have a victory when Adelaide's Ian Taylor beat English
champion Ian Bond 7-6, 7-3, while the first upset of the championship
came when crown green player Robert Hitchen hit back after dropping the
opening set to beat former UK champion Stephen Rees 1-7, 7-5, 7-1. First
round results:
A Marshall (Scotland) beat J Henry (Ireland) 7-1, 7-2; R Hitchen
(Crown Green) beat S Rees (Wales) 1-7, 7-5, 7-1; P Conlan (Scotland)
beat M King (England) 7-6, 7-1; I Taylor (Australia) beat I Bond
(England) 7-6, 7-3; W W Wood (Scotland) beat J Price (Wales) 7-4, 7-4; D
Gourlay Jr (Scotland) beat C Curtis (Australia) 7-1, 6-7, 7-2.

ATHLETICS
THE reek of nostalgia overpowered even the smell of wintergreen as the
Scottish Veteran Harriers staged their Silver Jubilee championships --
on cinders, over old-fashioned yards, not metres.
You could tell Saturday's was a track meeting with a difference just
by the banter, from still whippett-thin thoroughbreds and men with a
lifetime investment in a beer-belly, united by a common obsession.
John Emmett Farrell is to athletics what the late Bill Shankly was to
football.
He was reading philosophy at Glasgow University in the twenties when
his father died. No grants then, and teenager Farrell was forced to
leave, spending most of his working life reading gas meters.
But his philosophic bent survived, and he epitomises this obsessive
breed. ''I'm pretty fit for a man of 100,'' he says. ''Unfortunately I
am only 86. Where once there were wings, anno domine has put lead in our
heels . . . We are all Peter Pans under the skin. Mercifully,
ocassionally, he gets out for a while.''
When not looking after his wife, Farrell trains thrice a week. But
there was no concession in the mile handicap to a man who, in 1938 and
1948, won the Scottish cross-country title, and who has set world
age-group bests since.
Farrell was given a mere 225 yards' start against the eventual winner,
Andy McLinden, a man half his age.
One of Farrell's Maryhill clubmates, 81-year-old Gordon Porteous, was
a reluctant timekeeper. Porteous, who broke the UK record last year for
10,000m, and who holds every UK age record from 800m to the marathon,
was suffering from blisters.
Porteous attacked the world marathon record earlier this month at
Inverclyde, failing by just three and a half minutes. ''I'd to walk at
21 miles -- I've just not been getting the training in,'' he said.
Despite that, he sliced 68 minutes -- yes minutes -- from the British
80-plus record, with 3hr 47min.
Brian Kirkwood, 43 last Wednesday, retained the Andy Forbes Memorial
Trophy for the six miles with 31-54.0, a time which a 25-year-old might
envy, but still well short of the 30-35.9 with which Forbes won Empire
Games silver in 1950.
Willie Spark took up the sport aged 50, when he was made redundant.
Nine years on, he admits it has given his life a focus. He hitch hikes
the length and breadth of Scotland to meetings, often taking half a day
to get there.
He was rewarded on Saturday with victory at 100 and 220 yards in the
55-60 group. He also won a special sartorial award. Sparky wore a
Victoria Park vest with the badge trimmed from the 1952 singlet worn by
Forbes's brother, Chick, when their club won the English national
cross-country team title -- still the only Scottish club to do so.
Chick, who suffers from a heart condition and can no longer run,
loaned the singlet ''still with the 1952 mud on it,'' he claimed.
Tartan tracks may be the rage, but many vets, for whom life begins at
40 (35 for women), prefer old-fashioned cinders -- less jarring on the
joints.
Several clubs in England are laying cinders, and Saturday's venue, the
year-old track at Bent Park, Hamilton, had been specially prepared -- a
white line about a foot from the kerb, not to be crossed on pain of
disqualification -- eliminating the difference between 400 metres and
the traditional 440 yards of 25 years ago.
Hugh McGinlay crossed this line, though not on the bend, and was
spotted by referee Danny Wilmoth. ''I'm going to disqualify him, but
I'll wait until he's put his teeth back in -- really give him something
to choke on!'' said Danny. ''Ach, I'd better be lenient. He's over 70,
and it was on the straight. He didn't gain any advantage!''
Molly Wilmoth (nee Ferguson), twice national half-mile champion in the
fifties, took the 100 yards title in the 55-plus division, while in the
over-50 class former national sprint champion Esther Linaker (nee Watt)
struck a feminist blow -- one tenth faster than John Robson, male winner
in the same age group.
Anecdotes were traded freely. Norrie Neilson, who flew 41 Lancaster
sorties over Germany, recalled a training session in Hull: ''Our pack
was joined by two men in black singlets and shorts,'' he said. ''They
left us after a couple of miles -- and later it emerged they had escaped
from the local jail!''
''Some people think we're daft,'' concluded Farrell. ''Yes, it is an
obsession. But it is a magnificent obsession. I don't know whether
running adds years to your life, but it certainly adds life to your
years.'' Results:

A HISTORIC decision by members of IBM Spango Valley paves the way for
a new Greenock athletics club, to be called Inverclyde AC.
Spango on Saturday voted unanimously at their annual meeting to delete
track and field from the club's activities. This action, restricting
them to competing in cross-country and road-running throughout the year,
follows the same decision taken recently by Greenock Glenpark Harriers.
The two clubs, with the backing of Inverclyde District Council, will
shortly set up the new club, for track and field only, competing next
season in the Scottish Men's League, Scottish and Northwest League, and
McDonald's Young Athletes League.

We have one of the only games in the world where you can deliberately
stop the whole spectacle by kicking the ball out of play.
CAN I just annoy my pal, Brian Meek, and get my retaliation in first
when it comes to what must happen to the laws of rugby to make the game
more attractive in a professional era?
I absolutely and utterly believe it must be more attractive. You see,
there we were on Saturday at Boroughmuir, and a good old piece of rough
and tumble it was, too. Quite enjoyable, really, after a slow start. In
between the gaps that is.
You see, rugby has these huge passages in a game when nothing happens.
Absolutely nothing. It struck me as Andy Knight kicked the ball into
touch that we have one of the only games in the world where you can
deliberately stop the whole spectacle by kicking the ball out of play.
Football doesn't have that, and neither does rugby league. Madness.
I think the game should ban touch kicks. Fair enough if a player is
bundled into touch have a lineout, but the desperate kicking for touch
should be completely banned. What a waste of time it is as we wait for
the ball to be retrieved, the codes are called, and the ball is thrown
in. A complete and utter waste of time.
I have always thought that kicking stand-offs should be executed, but
we could take them out of the game completely by not allowing the little
devils to kick to extreme in the first place. I am not naive enough to
think they will never kick, but if they do, and they won't be allowed to
kick for touch, then it will be up to the defending team to keep the
ball in play if they've received it.
It also struck me as we waited for either Knight, or the back in form,
Mark McKenzie, to kick for goal that this is another area rugby really
has to examine. For starters, after a penalty is awarded we have to wait
for some poor little sod of a ball boy to run onto the pitch with one of
these plastic kicking tees. Or, lower down the ranks, a spectator hurls
the thing onto the pitch.
Why can't the referee carry one in a pouch during the game and give
the dammed thing to the kicker? On Saturday, it was sand the kickers
were after, and the ball boy had to fill his cup and run onto the pitch
with it. ''Make the ref carry the sand,'' said a wag beside me at
Meggetland.
Honestly, what a complete farce this is waiting for these penalty
attempts, or conversions, to be taken.
You could skip the whole problem of waiting for a ball boy to bring
either the sand or the tee onto the pitch, or save the referee the chore
of remembering to carry the tee in a pouch and a bag of sand over his
back, and the monotony of waiting for a kicker to line up a kick, by
making all kicks at goal drop kicks to be taken within a time limit.
Let's look at rugby now. Rugby is now played by fit young blokes who
have outgrown the pitch they are on. There's hardly as much space as
there used to be even 20 years ago, because all the forwards can run,
and most of the backs can tackle. Most players get the ball and run
three yards before being hit, or so an All Black analysis showed a few
years ago.
So there are only a couple of options left to make more spaces on the
pitch and they are to either decrease the rest available to players on
the pitch to knacker them more easily . . . or to increase the size of
all of the rugby pitches in the world.
Plainly, you can't increase the size of rugby pitches just like that.
The groundsmen of the world would revolt, and you'd have to move every
stand in the country. Instead, I think you have to make the game much
more of a game of constant movement with as few stoppages as possible by
cutting down time when nothing happens.
If, instead of having an alleged 20 minutes of the ball in play in a
rugby match you could have 70, you would find very quickly that there
would be more spaces appearing. As an ex-player I can feel my legs
tremble.
And another thing. I find rugby games short. Why only 80 minutes? Why
can't we have 90? Yes, when Bill McMurdo called the GHK v West game
''tranquil'' I didn't know whether to be insulted or enlightened. Maybe,
just maybe, it was enlightening.

DIVISION 3
IT was a mixed day for
Biggar. They came out on the right side of a top-of-the-table penalty
kicking contest at home to Kirkcaldy. But they lost lock Geoff King to a
second half early bath. Warned in the first period following a brawl, he
was later sent off for kicking.
John Mitchell put over four first-half penalties to give the Fifers a
12-0 lead. In the second, period Denis Lavery kicked five to give Biggar
a win they just deserved.
Glasgow Academicals won 30-9 at Preston Lodge to go second. Accies
opened with a penalty from Calum MacGregor who soon converted John
Mason's try.
But when Brian Sandilands added two penalties, within eight minutes of
the second half, to his first period success, Accies trembled.
However, they re-asserted forward control, MacGregor kicked a penalty,
and rifled passes sent over Mathewson ) and Mike Davis with MacGregor
converting one and closing proceedings with a penalty.
Peebles contributed to the Border gloom by losing 26-19 at home to
Musselburgh. Tries from Alistair Bonthron and Stuart Young were at the
heart of the visitors' 15-12 lead with all Peebles' points coming from
the boot of Andre Bell.
A penalty from Cliff Livingstone and a second from Neil Lockhart eased
Musselburgh away to 21-12. An excellent try from Colin Kerr converted by
Bell set Peebles up, but instead Musselburgh closed with a Colin Pow
try.

DIVISION 4
GLASGOW Southern kept themselves tucked in behind leaders Kilmarnock
with a 53-6 win over Edinburgh Wanderers.
Yet, after James Dunlop had eased Southern ahead with his first
successful penalty out of three attempts, Wanderers for a spell, gave as
good as they got in midfield.
Southern's first try came from a wild Wanderers' kick and the
visitors' morale immediately nosedived. By the turn, Southern led 34-0
thanks to tries from Brian Middler, John Clinkenbeard, Andy Tunn, Gavin
Walsh, and Ryan Anderson, of which Dunlop converted three. Walsh grabbed
a second try and Clinkenbeard his fifth in two matches. Dunlop had one
of his own and kicked two conversions.
Robbie Stewart made a big contribution to Kilmarnock's 19-12 win at
Langholm by kicking a conversion and a penalty into the strong downfield
wind in the first half, allowing Kilmarnock to turn a point ahead.
Langholm had taken the lead with a Gary Brannan penalty and Mark
Grieve drop goal. When Kilmarnock did fight their way to Langholm's
danger area, Stewart saw a penalty come back off a post, but Killie
secured possession and Jason Sharp got over.
Although Grieve dropped a second goal before the turn, three Stewart
penalties took Kilmarnock well away before Brannan kicked his second
penalty.
Ayr's powerful rucking took Gordonians by surprise and they won 23-7
at Millbrae.

BENJARONG, a 200-1 outsider in her last race at Ayr 10 days ago, was a
well backed 3-1 joint second favourite when landing the GTX Protection
Plus Claiming Stakes at Hamilton Park yesterday. Trained at Lesmahagow
by Robert McKellar, she was hard driven in the final furlong by Tyrone
Williams and got home by a head from Jackatack. It was McKellar's sixth
winner of the season, five of which have been at Hamilton Park.
At the Western Meeting at Ayr, Benjarong opened at 500-1 and came in
to 200-1 when finishing tenth to High Premium in a claiming race. Her
best previous performance was when she was successful at Edinburgh as a
two-year-old when trained by Mark Johnston.
Originally owned by Alex Penman, chairman of Raith Rovers, Benjarong
was sold privately this summer at a ''very reasonable price'' to Mrs
Margaret Brown, wife of a Bellshill publican.
McKellar said Benjarong had to be ''tucked away'' for a late run and
that was exactly how Tyrone had ridden her. Penman decided to sell her,
said McKellar, because ''he didn't want to keep horses that couldn't
win.'' He added: ''I phoned him up and advised him to back her today.''
Vindaloo, attempting to set a new twentieth century record by winning
10 handicaps in a season, failed by four lengths in the Evening Times
Handicap, the feature race of the meeting, which was sponsored by the
Scottish committee of the Variety Club.
An incredibly tough gelding, Vindaloo battled on bravely inside the
final two furlongs but could make no impression on the winner, My Gina
(15-2), or the runner-up, Nigel's Lad (12-1).
Trainer Jimmy Harris confirmed that the three-year-old would
definitely run again soon, if well. He said: ''He was just tapped for
speed, but you cannot be disappointed at anything this horse does, win
or lose.''
It was Vindaloo's twenty-ninth race of the season and his ninth
attempt at setting a new record.
My Gina, a lightly raced three-year-old trained by Michael Stoute, hit
the front two furlongs from home and stayed on by one and a half lengths
to give Keiran Fallon his eighty-first winner of the season. Fallon, who
was given an eight-day ban at Haydock on Saturday, said: ''The filly was
always travelling well and I knew from the start she was good enough to
win.''
Sepoy, 7-4 favourite, was an easy winner of the Variety Club Auction
Maiden Stakes, coming home eight lengths ahead of Linda Perratt's Termon
(20-1). Sepoy will go to the Doncaster Sales next month as his
71-year-old owner, Jack Hanson, has decided to reduce the number of
horses he keeps in training.
Sheik Mohammed's promising two-year-old Marcomir, 8-13 favourite,
showed his inexperience in the Adrenalinn Maiden Stakes, but had
sufficient class to beat Ocean Stream (9-2) by a length and
three-quarters.
Meanwhile, Ayr trainer Lindd Perratt makes a determined effort to win
the last race of Hamilton Park's final meeting of the season today when
she has five of the 16 runners in the Tennents Eighty Shilling
Apprentices Handicap.
Diet, with six successes over the Hamilton track, must be the choice
from the Cree Lodge stable, but Mr Westsound is also one to be
considered if he is not too slow in leaving the stalls.

HENRY Cecil let Bosra Sham do the talking to answer any doubts about
his training ability and secure his fifth victory in the Fillies' Mile
at Ascot yesterday.
Bosra Sham's three-and-a-half-length defeat of Bint Shadayid with
Matiya the same distance back in third was the perfect riposte from the
10-time champion who has endured a traumatic last two weeks.
During that time he has not only learned that leading two-year-old
colts Allied Forces and Mark Of Esteem were joining the annual exodus to
Dubai, but he was also on the end of a rebuke from owner Sheikh
Mohammed.
Following Natalie Cecil's comments on the effect of the loss of Mark
Of Esteem, the Sheikh told him ''not to listen to people who know hardly
anything about thoroughbred racing. He must remember that he has been
champion because of his tools and they are the owners, horses and the
good people around them.''
Cecil would not be drawn into a response today. ''Enough has been
said. Let's all look forward to next year. I am sure the Sheikh is and
so am I.''

MAREDO OPEN:
RACHEL Hetherington, 23, from Australia, became the fourth first-time
winner on the American Express Tour this year when she shot a closing
round of 72 to win the Maredo Open at Treudelberg in Hamburg yesterday.
With a 17-under-par total of 275, Hetherington finished two clear of
Britain's Caroline Hall with Corinne Dibnah, another Australian and the
former British Open champion, two strokes further behind.
Julie Forbes was the best of the Scottish contingent when she handed
in a final round of 74 to share eighth place on 283, one stroke ahead of
Dale Reid who shot a last round of 70.
Hetherington finished third in the Dutch Open last year, her first
season as a professional, and has made the cut in each of the 15
tournaments she has played this year with eighth place in the Hennessy
Cup her best performance until yesterday.
Last Tuesday she worked on her swing with Treudelberg professional
Gary Hillson who made slight adjustments to her backswing. This
increased her confidence though it was her putting which set her apart
in a course record third round 64 on Saturday.
Hetherington had only 25 putts in her lowest ever round which left her
five strokes ahead of Wendy Doolan with Hall and Dibnah two behind at
the start of the final round.

MOTORSPORT
RENAULT snatched the Auto Trader RAC British Touring Car Championship
manufacturers' title yesterday with a pair of dominant race victories at
Silverstone.
Alain Menu and Will Hoy shared the wins in their Renault Lagunas to
beat Vauxhall into second place in the points table, despite the best
efforts of newly-crowned drivers' champion John Cleland.
The first race was a lights-to-flag demonstration run by Menu, who
took advantage of Cleland's poor start to drive home his car's
superiority on the opening lap, chased by team-mate Hoy, Cleland, Julian
Bailey (Toyota) and Kelvin Burt (Ford).
With Cleland starting from sixth on the grid in the final round, and
with Menu on pole, the Vauxhall man was always going to have his work
cut out. Nonetheless, the Scot tried his hardest, fighting through to
fourth place by mid-distance.
At the front, the battle was between Hoy, Menu and Leslie, the Honda
man snatching second from Menu to split the Renaults on lap 11. For six
laps it looked as though Leslie might manage to get on terms with leader
Hoy. But then Menu reasserted Renault's superiority to follow his
team-mate home for their second one-two of the day. Results:
Round 24 -- 1, A Menu (Switzerland), Renault Laguna, 32min 34.72sec,
87.69mph; 2, W Hoy (Britain), Renault Laguna, +1.11se; 3, J Cleland
(Britain), Vauxhall Cavalier 16V, +5.75; 4, K Burt (Britain), Ford
Mondeo Ghia, +6.72; 5, D Leslie (Britain), Honda Accord, +15.39; 6, M
Briggs (South Africa), Vauxhall Cavalier 16V, +16.65; 7, R Rydell
(Sweden), Volvo 850 20v, +19.72; 8, D Warwick (Britain), Alfa Romeo 155,
+21.43; 9, D Brabham (Australia), BMW 318i, +24.48; 10, T Harvey
(Britain), Volvo 850 20v, +26.05.

West of Scotland 24,
Stewart's Melville FP 14
WHEN Dave Barrett weaved through the Stewart's Melville ranks for a
try after only two minutes it seemed that West of Scotland were about to
carry on where GHK had left off a week earlier. But West scored only two
more tries on their way to an uneasy victory at Burnbrae.
Those tries by John Lonergan and Alan Williamson came just before the
interval and provided West with a 21-6 lead as insurance against the
gale.
Stewart's Melville suffered a blow when they lost their captain, Les
Hamilton, who limped off after only seven minutes. Yet their almost
completely recast pack emerged with credit for their undying
competitiveness.
Barrett's opening try was initiated when David McLeish stole
possession from Stew-Mel's long throw-in in their own twenty-two. The
West lead, though, was stretched only by two Wiliamson penalty goals
before Graeme Stirling replied with two of the same. However, just when
it seemed West would have to settle for a meagre lead at half-time they
struck twice with tries from Lonergan and Williamson.
Jason Conlin went over for the Stew-Mel try early in the second half,
but the only other scores were penalty goals from Barrett and Stirling.
West of Scotland -- A C D Greenshields; D Riding, A J Bulloch, R
Little, A Williamson; D N Barrett, F H Stott; S McGregor, G C Bulloch, D
Jamieson, S G McKechnie, G C Perrett, J Shaw, J Lonergan, D R McLeish.

FILIPINO Fernando Piccio is on a life support machine in a Brisbane
hospital after being knocked out in a bout in Toowoomba at the weekeend.
Piccio was stopped in the seventh round of a lightweight contest against
Australian Selwyn Currie.
He suffered a suspected brain haemorrhage after the bout and was taken
to a local hospital for treatment before being transferred to the Royal
Brisbane Hospital. He was ''unconscious, on a life support machine and
in a serious condition.''
Piccio was counted out by referee Wally Lewis after slipping down the
ropes after having taken a flurry of punches in what had been a close,
hard-fought contest.

Jed-Forest 12, Dundee HS FP 25
JED-FOREST coach Donald Miller blamed a ''stupid'' change of tactics
as Dundee claimed their third Border scalp of the season at Riverside
Park. Playing into the wind, the home side dominated the early stages
with their slick passing and driving forward play before, inexplicably,
getting drawn into a kicking game.
''It was just gross stupidity'' claimed Miller. ''We played some good
stuff for the first 20 minutes, then for some reason we started to kick
the ball into the wind!''
A penalty from Chris Richards and a drop goal from Harry Hogg put Jed
in front, but Dundee's New Zealand stand-off Chris Robinson twice
levelled the score.
Robinson forced Dundee forward and after 32 minutes he broke through
the Jed defence, moved the ball wide, then popped up in support to take
the scoring pass. He converted and Dundee led 13-6 at half time.
Jed were under pressure after the restart and whenthey conceded a
penalty on their goal-line, Dundee opted for the scrummage and Robinson
released skipper David Hamilton who crashed over under the posts.
Richards converted a couple of penalties but any faint chances of a
comeback were dashed when Steve Newton touched down in the corner.
When Kevin Armstrong barged over for a try it was little more than a
consolation score.

GHK 35, Kelso 5
CAMMY Little is proving to be the little big man behind the
rejuvenated GHK. The scrum half's activity is infectious, his commitment
highly commendable and his effect on the rest of the team, uplifting.
It was Little who set up the first try for Murray Wallace in seven
minutes and Harry Bassi popped over his only conversion of the day.
GHK were playing expansive rugby and after a grand handling move
involving Andy Ness, Sean Little, Scott Hutton and Steve Hirini,
fullback John Breckenridge dived over from the Kiwi flyhalf's flip pass.
Kelso's White Shark John Jeffrey earned his own special applause when
he picked up the ball on his own line, outstripped two GHK attackers and
hoofed a great kick to the halfway line.
Gerry Hawkes finished off the home first half scoring with a try from
Hirini. Bassi increased the lead with a penalty goal then Scott Hutton
crashed over after Wallace had chipped the defence and set up a ruck.
The 64th minute brought the most outrageous of tries from George
Breckenridge. He received from Hirini behind his own line and sped off
beating two defenders. He kicked ahead, got to the ball again and toed
on once more. Graham Agnew side-footed the ball to him and the fullback
went over for a remarkable try. Breckenridge then put Hawkes over, but
the Borderers had the last word when Mark Pearson dived over.
GHK -- G Breckenridge; G Agnew, S Little, H Bassi, G Hawkes; S

Greenock Morton 2, Dunfermline Ath 0
HAVING tagged their address to their name, Morton have started to put
themselves back on the main map. They took highway one against
Dunfermline, rolling over them in style and hardly seeing them in their
road.
Victory was only a part of their delight. In every way it was
Greenock's day. Even the rain had an especially biting local quality.
Dunfermline ended in more than a little disarray. In a cruel way, they
became comical. Before the finish, they had the look about them of a
cartoon motor car, which after many hairy escapades, has steam coming
out its ears, while it flops down on its springs and the wheels come off
one at a time.
Morton's team effort was total. Their invention and energy abounded.
Their good work across the park was typified by a five-man move that
needed a diving save by Guido Van de Kamp to keep out from Marko
Rajamaki.
Given abundant space, Rajamaki made even more for himself. He again
warmed the goalkeeper's hands before Derek McInnes looped in Morton's
first after half an hour.
Captain McInnes led by inspiring example throughout, abetted by some
uncanny positional play by Alan Mahood until the interval.
Morton's defence, which has been a worry to them, often had the break
of the ball, but no more so than John Anderson and Steve McCahill
deserved. More corners were conceded than looked prudent. Inviting the
bulky invasion of your house by Ivo den Biemen, Andy Tod, and Norrie
McCathie is risky, especially if it is a small house. But Dunfermline
were more clumsy visitors than destructive. They were cumbersome. It was
as if breathing the thin air at the top of the division had slowed their
thinking. Often enough they did the right thing, but needed two attempts
at it.
A trundling shot by Stewart Petrie that didn't so much hit a post as
bump into it was as close as they came.
After some rousing words at the interval, Dunfermline created more
problems, but nothing much that Morton could not play themselves out of.
Janne Lindberg and Derek Collins sustained the buoyant mood.
Presented with an open net, Warren Hawke rubbed in that Athletics'
winning run of games had come to a lame conclusion.
A further part of the collapse of the Pars included the bookings of
Petrie, Paul Smith, and Allan Moore. A desperate reshaping of the team
that pulled Marc Millar out of defence to be a front-line cannon led to
his being sent off after clashing with McInnes and Mahood.
The same little squawl also put McInnes in the referee's book. But he
had been everywhere else on the park on a bright day for Morton.

Currie 32, Selkirk 24
IT was a thoroughly entertaining game at Malleny Park on Saturday.
Despite a dire weather forecast the sunny weather and good ground
provided conditions for running rugby and seven tries were scored.
''The best match I've seen this season,'' said Arthur Hastie, watching
the match on behalf of the Edinburgh selectors. He was right, and some
of Currie's back play in the first half in particular was a joy to
behold with the backs lying flat and relying on quick passing.
Ally Donaldson was the orchestrator, often feeding his centres, and he
landed another five place kicks to bring his league total this season to
83 points in five games.
After 23 minutes, second phase possession saw Donaldson and Marrick
Tonkin give the ball quickly to David Wilson, and the fullback took the
ball at speed to score under the posts.
Five minutes later, the ball was spun right down the line and when
Geoff Keen was stopped on the left wing near the corner, flanker Stewart
Hardie snapped up the loose ball to score.
That was his second try, his first being a stunning individual effort
after taking the ball at the back of a lineout on half-way.
A 27-point deficit at half-time seems daunting, but the Selkirk backs
are used to feeding off scraps of possession.
Full back David Hunter was involved in two tries, his pass putting
Mike Jaffray in at the corner, and providing a pass inside to Scott
Nichol after a break by Keith Johnston.
The pity was that the game was watched by only about 300 people.
Currie president Mike Beckwith said: ''We are disappointed with the
crowd, but there is a lot of competition from the Division One clubs in
Edinburgh.''

Melrose 22, Edinburgh Academical 3
WHAT had all the initial promise of a rip-roaring Greenyards contest
was marred, unbalanced and fractured by an unprecedented series of
injuries that befell Edinburgh Academicals.
These events so disorganised their effort that it required a herculean
contribution, in particular from each of their loose forwards, to
prevent a Melrose landslide.
David McIvor was an inspirational dynamo with high workrate support
from Rob Hoole and Martin Waite and those three stayed upsides with
their southern hemisphere rivals, although Isaac Feaunati proved a
menace in backline augmentation and Nick Broughton in link and
regeneration while no one could match Scott Aitken for clean catching
near the line-out tail.
Aitken, Robbie Brown and Ewan Simpson gave Melrose a throw-in edge
although the 19-year-old Scott Murray had his moments.
It was hard enough on Academicals to have to switch Duncan Wilson to
hooker at the eleventh hour, albeit he held his own in a scrummage that
eventually felt the strain.
Their line-out resources were seriously reduced when first their
cornerstone Jeremy Richardson (knee) had to retire as, 15 minutes later,
did his replacement Malcolm McVie (shoulder).
Academicals also lost, after only eight minutes, their playmaking
centre Chris Simmers (hamstring) and their tactician, Brian Hay-Smith,
hirpled with Achilles damage for 36 minutes before having to depart
eight minutes from no-side.
Academicals had to use all four replacements and finally a prop,
Charlie Malcolm-Smith, operated at lock and scrum half Philip Simpson
moved from flanker to stand-off.
Melrose were in poll position at the interval with a 12-0 lead and a
bustling wind as an ally thereafter. The loss of Rowen Shepherd at
half-time was not such a handicap, so effectively did Derek Bain
deputise.
Bain is gifted with arts of deception, good hands and accelaratory
pace and seems far too effective to be consigned to the bench or the
second string when Craig Joiner resumes.
Whilst Craig Chalmers has place kicked with more handsome outcome, the
buffeting wind reducing his haul to one conversion from five attempts,
he yet directed operations with practised touch and, with one massive
hoof over 80 metres, set the required example by which he and his
disciples dictated the trend of pegging Academicals in their own strain
area for much of the second half.
The Academicals' reshaped forward platform battled with rare verve,
their creaking scrummage conceding only one strike against the put-in,
but it sapped their puff to make spirited inroads only to be sent
chugging backwards whenever Melrose regained possession.
Kevin Troup improvised astutely, although unable to ask quite the same
questions as that livewire Bryan Redpath, there were rare hints that
Richard Porter might have made stronger impact with better service and
the 19-year-old Kenny Baillie is proving a maturing stand-in for Simon
Burns.
The only Academicals score was an offside penalty goal by Hay-Smith
for 12-3 soon after the interval, but it spoke volumes for Academical
tenacity that they limited Melrose to four tries.
Two of these were by Millan Browne following combined operations in
each of which Feaunati took a prominent surge and link role, a scrummage
pushover score by Feaunati and a typically cheeky effort by Gary Parker
who sizzled in off his left foot after creative setup by Broughton and
Chalmers.
Melrose -- R J S Shepherd; D C Bain, J G L Turnbull, A G Shiel, G A
Parker; C M Chalmers, B W Redpath; M G Browne, S J Brotherstone, K R

Dundee Utd 1, Airdrie 2
THE swirling wind had all sorts of discarded crisp packets and white
napkins handed out at the pie stalls trapped in a corner of Tannadice.
They were going nowhere. It was an omen.
Dundee United had looked good, thoroughly deserved their one-goal
lead, and then were blown away in the last five minutes by an Airdrie
side who were still on a high after their Coca-Cola Cup win in midweek.
As the players trooped off after the final whistle into that same
corner, the Airdrie fans celebrated mightily, their players showed
appreciation.
Dundee United's squad left, heads down in front of a stand which one
minute had been filled with fans waving tangerine scarves and favours.
Suddenly, it was almost empty.
But to the victors. Steve Cooper did his back a mischief three weeks
ago when he was moving house in East Kilbride. ''Just a couple of
streets away,'' he said. ''I strained it lifting boxes. Although I have
not missed a game, I've hardly trained.''
You would never have guessed as he rose to a superb Jimmy Boyle cross
from the right to head the winner a minute from time.
The spur for this had come only a minute earlier, and what a double
kick in the teeth it was for United. Peter Duffield sprinted on to a
superb pass from Jimmy Sandison that left the United defence wondering
where they were going, never mind where the ball was.
Duffield rarely misses these chances. But the irony was that if United
had been a couple of hours quicker earlier in the season, the former
Hamilton striker could have been playing for them.
As manager Billy Kirkwood said: ''We made a formal offer for him only
to discover that he had just joined Airdrie. We could do with him now.''
And Kirkwood, who branded the result with a short sharp ''we got what
we deserved -- nothing...it was disgraceful,'' also calmed down enough
to reflect on his fortunes -- more accurately, the lack of them -- with
United since he joined them at the back end of last season.
''I must have done something wrong. From day one, it has been an
absolute nightmare with injuries. In fact, from eight seconds into my
coming here when Craig Brewster broke a toe. Since then, it has been
nothing but injuries.''
Paddy Connolly is the latest. He's not long back after a broken leg.
Now he will be out for a couple of months with a broken collar bone when
he came out second best in a collision with keeper John Martin and
another Airdrie defender. For such a wee fella, to land at the bottom of
such a heap was bound to have dire consequences.
Also still out are Scott Crabbe, David Bowman, Brewster, David Hannah,
Neil Caldwell and Sandy Robertson.
The end result does not reflect United's superiority, particularly in
the first half when Martin had made several excellent stops.
But he had no chance when Mark Perry was left in what seemed to be
acres of space. The full-back rose to power home a header from an Andy
McLaren cross to put United ahead.
Martin still had to be on his toes early in the second half,
particularly when McLaren hammered in a shot from 25 yards. The keeper
blocked it, and was still alert enough to stop Connolly's effort from
the rebound.
Then Duffield was sent on to replace Paul Harvey, and suddenly things
began to happen at the other end.
You could almost sense the disaster waiting to happen midway in the
second half when suddenly it was Ally Maxwell who was busy, pulling off
a particularly superb stop with a foot from a Cooper header after 74
minutes.
Cooper said: ''We seemed to be tired in the first half, but once we
got our second wind, then we always had a chance.''
Airdrie assistant manager John McVeigh said: ''I know Dundee United
dominated much of the game, but it is the result that counts. You've got
to admire the character of our players to come back from a goal down and
win, especially after midweek.''

Dumbarton 1, Dundee 5
DUNDEE, having been involved in a punishing 120-minute football
marathon which culminated in a psychologically draining, albeit
ultimately successful penalty shootout in midweek, the players would
have been forgiven had they demonstrated some signs of fatigue during
this encounter with Dumbarton in the unrelenting Boghead drizzle.
Such notions, however, were eliminated after one minute and 19 seconds
of play when the Dens Park side's highly rated young winger, Neil
McCann, sent over a venomous cross, and the ball was glanced into the
Dumbarton net via the head of George Shaw.
It was the first act in what was to be a memorable performance from
McCann. His name did not find its way on to the scoresheet, but he was
the creative force behind all five Dundee goals in a ritual demolition
of a disjointed Dumbarton side.
''There was no question of us being tired after beating Hearts on
Wednesday night,'' said McCann afterwards. ''The result gave us all a
great lift, and today's performance was just a natural progression from
that.''
McCann, of course, has been the subject of intense transfer
speculation since he broke through to the Dundee first team two years
ago, a fact which has undoubtedly had a detrimental effect on certain
aspects of his game.
''Neil's sometimes lacked a bit of consistency,'' confirmed manager
Jim Duffy, ''but this season, he seems to have overcome that problem.
What he has to do now is forget all the transfer speculation, get his
head down, and concentrate on his game. He was outstanding today but I
want him to play like that every week.''
After a spectacular own goal by Dumbarton skipper Paul Martin had
given Dundee a 2-0 interval lead, early second half strikes from Shaw
and Kevin Bain put the Dens Park men in an unassailable position.
Substitute Martin McGarvey pulled one back for the Sons, but Jim
Hamilton restored Dundee's four-goal advantage in the closing stages.
Dumbarton relied heavily on the creativity of Chic Charnley but,
although he almost caught out Michel Pageaud with an audacious 45-yard
lob, the midfielder's efforts rarely troubled an astute Dundee defence.
Manager Jim Fallon must now be questioning the wisdom of accepting his
appointment as manager of the club last month.
While acting in an unofficial capacity following Murdo MacLeod's
departure, he guided the team to victory in the two opening league games
of the season. Since his position was ratified by the Dumbarton board,
however, he has suffered four successive defeats, losing 14 goals in the
process.

PETERSHILL'S eight-game unbeaten run almost came to an end on
Saturday. Trailing Cambuslang 1-0 with only six minutes left, a Joe
Reilly own goal brought them the equaliser. A strike a minute later by
Stuart McDonald and an injury time clincher by Danny O'Halloran secured
the points which keep them at the top of the Reebok premier league.
Similarly Arthurlie's good form almost came to an abrupt halt against
a well organised Larkhall Thistle team. Arthurlie's winner came in the
last minute when a speculative cross was knocked into the net by centre
half Bobby Brown.
A Scott Clark double for St Anthony's brought Carluke Rovers back down
to earth following last week's victory over Glenafton.
Greenock continue to lead the Reebok second division thanks to an Alan
Rush goal against Renfrew. Largs Thistle's newly appointed team manager
Phil Bonnyman watched his team draw 1-1 with Auchinleck.
A second half hat-trick by ex-Darvel player Scott Reid put Kilbirnie
on the way to a convincing win against his former club. Further second
half counters from Andy Coull and Martin Walsh overturned Darvel's 1-0
half-time lead.
Beith bounced back from last week's defeat by Maryhill to beat Ardeer
Thistle 2-1. An Eddie Allan goal three minutes from time sealed the game
for Beith.
Linlithgow Rose reached the semi-final of the Skol League Cup by
beating Bonnyrigg 3-2 away from home.
They will now meet the winners of next week's Newtongrange v Whitburn
quarter-final tie. In the other quarter-final Ormiston beat Armadale
1-0. They will meet either Camelon or Livingston in the other semi.
Four goals by Scottish internationalist Willie Spence against Thornton
Hibs took Hill o' Beath through to the final of the PSM Cup where they
will meet Kelty Hearts who beat Rosyth 3-1 on penalties after extra
time.
Two clubs are excluded from today's OVD Scottish Junior Cup first
round draw in Glasgow -- Dalry Thistle as a penalty for indiscipline in
last season's Scottish Cup tie with Whitburn, Shotts Bon Accord because
of a a one-year suspension from the Central Region Junior FA.
Blantyre Vics will attempt to secure silverware for the first time in

St Johnstone 2, Clydebank 2
CLYDEBANK are finding that ''later in life'' is rather difficult these
days. And if that continues, they probably will age considerably.
For the second week in succession, they were deprived of vital points
by the loss of a goal.
After losing out to an injury time penalty against Dundee United last
week -- and that was some injury time -- Bankies' coach Brian Wright and
his players kept silent, fearing they would talk themselves into trouble
with the authorities.
Seven days on, the Bankies had to settle for a point as St Johnstone
striker George O'Boyle snatched a dramatic leveller seconds before the
final whistle.
But on this occasion, the Bankies coach was more philosophical, having
seen his side pummelled for long spells by a Perth team short of the
killer instinct to round off imaginative outfield play.
Wright admitted: ''I've got mixed feelings about this one. Saints
played all the football and totally dominated the game. At half-time, we
would certainly have settled for a point.
''We were lucky to get a draw, scoring two of our three chances, but
on the other hand, having got ourselves ahead, we could have taken off
three points. We thought we had it won, but that was a terrible goal to
lose in the last minute. It's very frustrating.''
The Bankies somehow survived to half-time with the scoresheet blank as
Saints pressed them back with slick passing inspired by former Scotland
under-21 midfielder Philip Scott.
But Bankies' midfielder Dave Nicholls unleashed a thundering strike
from fully 25 yards minutes after the break to net with the Kilbowie
club's first on-target shot. Their second effort also brought reward,
when veteran Ken Eadie rose at the back post to head home a tempting
Gary Bowman free kick with five minutes left.
Between those goals, Saints substitute Roddy Grant netted his first
strike since returning to Perth from Partick Thistle, prompting manager
Paul Sturrock to comment: ''It was a real striker's goal and one the
player was needing.''
The Saints manager said he was exasperated by his side's failure to
finish off Clydebank in the opening period but he added: ''That's the
first time this season we've taken anything from a game in which we've
lost the first goal. The team showed character to come back, and a point
was the least we deserved.''

Hamilton 2 St Mirren 2
NEW #50,000 striker Mark Yardley, signed from Cowdenbeath, could yet
prove to be an important piece of the team-building jigsaw puzzle for St
Mirren manager Jimmy Bone.
The Love Street manager has long praised the outfield play of his side
as he has introduced an increasing number of younger players into the
scheme of things.
Without the finance needed to go out and buy big, Bone received a
financial helping hand from the directors on Friday when they dug into
their own pockets to provide the fee for Yardley to be signed from the
Fife club.
Within a minute at Firhill on Saturday, they must have felt that their
investment had been worthwhile as the striker had already marked his
debut by heading the opening goal.
They must have been almost ecstatic when, after only eight minutes,
Yardley created the opportunity for a second from John Boyd.
But Saints fans have learned the hard way that nothing is simple for
their side, and they watched in horror as Saints proceeded to shoot
themselves in the foot with Paul McIntyre being sent off, leaving them
to battle on with 10 men for the next hour.
And they knew that it would be a long afternoon when, six minutes
later, Sean McEntegart opened the Hamilton account to cut the deficit.
Before the interval, Paul Hartley had popped in an equaliser for the
homeless Hamilton, and it seemed as if they could go on for what would
have seemed after those opening minutes to be an unlikely win.
Hartley could have won it for them with two second half efforts,
before Yardley almost had the last say with a snapshot.
In the end, the sides had to settle for a share of the points which
leaves Hamilton firmly anchored at the foot of the table, with three
clubs including St Mirren, four points ahead of them in the lower
reaches.
But neither side was satisfied at the end, with the Hamilton manager,
Iain Munro, pointing out: ''After we drew level, we should have taken
the game to them and looked for the decisive third goal. We never really
did that.''
St Mirren manager Jimmy Bone was happy with the first showing of
Yardley. ''He fitted in well, and his header for the opener was well
taken.
''His threat in the penalty area will be important for us, for he
could finish off our outfield play.
''But that McIntyre sending off was the turning point of the game. Up
to then we were in control.''

Kilmarnock 1, Aberdeen 2
JOE Miller, one of the men manager Roy Aitken relied on to dig
Aberdeen out of a heap of trouble at the end of last season, is
convinced that there is no chance of a repeat of the club having to
battle for premier division survival -- because they got too big a
fright last time.
Miller was the man who sparked off another win for the Dons at Rugby
Park on Saturday with an opportunist goal after 30 minutes.
He said afterwards: ''We regard last season as being something of a
freak, but we also know you can't take anything for granted in this
game.
''That was my first time involved in a relegation struggle. I had
always been used to being at the top end with Aberdeen and Celtic, so
last season was a bit of a frightener. It was a horrible experience
which I hope I never have to go through again.
''Things are different now, however. Big Roy has got the lads doing
the business, and Tommy Craig has also been a very influential figure
since he arrived. There is a freshness about the club, we are playing
with a lot of confidence and flair, and we are looking to win a trophy
this season.
''Personally, I'm thriving on the free role the boss has given me and
the players around me are responding by giving me the ball.''
Kilmarnock just didn't know where Miller was going to pop up next on
Saturday, and they paid a heavy price in 30 minutes when a long
clearance from goalkeeper Drago Lekovic fell to Stewart McKimmie. The
Aberdeen captain knocked it back into space in the Killie half and
Miller was quickest to respond. He raced through unchallenged and shot
low inside the right hand post.
Kilmarnock manager Alex Totten thought Miller was a couple of yards
offside, but I don't agree. And there were absolutely no doubts about
Aberdeen's second strike three minutes before the interval. There was no
hint of danger when Colin Woodthorpe picked up a ball 35 yards out, but
all of a sudden the left back let fly and the ball screamed past Lekovic
for one of the most spectacular goals we are likely to see this season.
Kilmarnock did manage to get their first league goal of the season
three minutes after half time when Tom Brown launched himself at a Mark
Reilly corner and powered a header past Michael Watt, and the little
fellow should have scored again shortly afterwards when he was given
another great chance, but headed it past.
Credit must be given to Kilmarnock, who are now on their own at the
bottom of the table. For a long spell after half time, they had Aberdeen
reeling, and, with a bit of luck, could have salvaged something from the
match.
Said manager Totten: ''I couldn't fault my players for effort. They
are a determined bunch and they want to do well, and the fans appreciate
that. We were bottom of the table after nine matches last season, so
there is no reason to panic -- that's when real problems arise. We just
have to keep working and keep up our good habits.''
And striker Paul Wright, a former Aberdeen player, agreed. ''We are
disap-pointed at not getting anything out of the game, but there's
certainly no despondency here,'' he said.
''All we need are a couple of breaks, which we are not getting at the
moment.''
But the day belonged to Aberdeen and, indeed, maybe the week. In eight
days they played three matches away from home, drawing at Easter Road,
beating Motherwell in the quarter finals of the Coca-Cola Cup, and then
winning at Kilmarnock.
That is a lot of travelling and three demanding matches for Aberdeen,
and the way they have come through the spell could be a pointer that
better things are on the way.

FOR thousands of Fantasy League managers in England, the season
officially began on Saturday, and by a happy coincidence it was
goalscorers' day. The celebrations therefore spread far beyond normal
club allegiances as hat-tricksters Alan Shearer and Tony Yeboah,
four-goal Robbie Fowler, and even Arsenal's Dennis Bergkamp -- at last
-- found the net.
Shearer has been the one positive element throughout Blackburn's
tribulations, and it was fitting that he should record his 100th goal
for the club (in only 133 games) as they came good again by beating
Coventry 5-1.
Rosenborg of Norway, will have been hoping that rather more
demoralised opposition would be arriving in their country for
Wednesday's European Champions' League game.
Liverpool and Leeds, both winners in the away leg of their UEFA Cup
ties, also warmed up with emphatic victories inspired by individual
scoring feats. Liverpool's Fowler had four to his name before opponents
Bolton managed one in what turned out to be a 5-2 romp.
Yeboah's power was again evident at Wimbledon in a wonderfully
entertaining game that finished 4-2 for Leeds.
Matches between Sheffield Wednesday and Manchester United are normally
of a similar type to that, but on Saturday they missed out on all the
goals and most of the excitement.
Nottingham Forest, beaten in successive midweek matches by Malmo and
Bradford City, regained some form and confidence in a 1-1 draw away to
Aston Villa, though they benefited from Andy Townsend's sending off only
two minutes after he had given Villa the lead. Des Lyttle equalised just
before the end.
Arsenal's 4-2 win over Southampton will go down as the game in which
Dennis Bergkamp at last got off the mark. His brace of goals were of the
quality that you pay #7.5m for.
Everton were the only European competitors to lose, though their 2-1
defeat at West Ham will not adversely affect their prospects of holding
on to a 3-2 lead from the away leg of the European Cup Winners' Cup tie
against Reykjavik.
Manchester City continue to struggle, going down 1-0 at home to
Middlesbrough.

Rangers 0, Hibernian l
IF TELEVISION evidence is ever allowed by the Scottish Football
Association, then Paisley referee Kenny Clark will be hoping he does not
pick up another game at Ibrox.
It was Clark who was the referee involved in the now notorious
''head-butting'' incident involving Duncan Ferguson and John McStay, and
while the Everton player was eventually hauled before the Disciplinary
Committee at Park Gardens, it was missed by the man from Paisley.
At the weekend, Mr Clark was booed from the field after twice turning
down strong penalty claims from Rangers, and then awarding Hibs a
questionable spot kick which brought them this win.
And would you believe that television demonstrated that the
unfortunate Mr Clark was wrong with at least two of his decisions.
A first-half challenge by Pat McGinlay on Oleg Salenko was shown quite
clearly to have been a foul, and to have been inside the 18-yard line.
Then the seond half tackle by Gordan Petric on Kevin Harper which
brought the Darren Jackson goal was outside the penalty area, according
to the cameras.
Poor Mr Clark!
It was little wonder that Rangers' manager Walter Smith pointed out
that important decisions had gone against his club as Hibs notched their
first victory over Rangers at Ibrox for five long years.
But while Smith was obviously upset at the defeat, it was a day to be
savoured by the Edinburgh side, even though penalty expert Jackson
admitted that his team had been put through the mill by the champions.
''They gave us a bit of a doing,'' grinned Jackson, ''but in the end,
we won and that was very important for us. Last season our away record
was terrible, and it was obvious to everyone at the club that we had to
improve on it.
''Today we got a result even though we did not do ourselves justice.
We were really hard-pressed at times out there, but when the penalty
came, I did not have any worries about taking it even though I had
missed one against Airdrie this season.
''This is the kind of result which can give everyone at the club a
lift.''
It was also the kind of result which can give the rest of the premier
division a lift as well. No matter that Hibs were fortunate to leave
with all three points, the basic fact is that they went to Ibrox, faced
down a 44,364 crowd, and sent the champions tumbling to defeat.
Not only to defeat, but also from their familiar top-of-the-table
position which has now been taken over by Celtic.
The message for the rest of the clubs is clear -- they don't have to
travel to Ibrox in fear and trembling. They can go there determined to
survive and, if they get as lucky as Hibs, then they can do more than
simply survive. They can win.
Hibs' manager Alex Miller confessed: ''Coming here without several
first-team regulars was a problem for us. But the lads we sent out
performed really well, and I have to praise Kevin McAllister for the way
he played. He read things so well for us.
''Then the two central defenders did magnificently against quality
strikers. It's a long time since we had a win here -- five years I'm
told -- and it's nice to get it so early in the season.''
For Rangers, the defeat was a blow, coming as it did on the build-up
to the Champions' League clash with Borussia Dortmund in midweek. The
Ibrox men would have liked to carry on from their Old Firm Coca-Cola Cup
victory with another win.
But they paid for missing chances in the first half when they
dominated for lengthy periods. Neither Salenko nor his front line
partner Ally McCoist were able to turn even one of them into a goal.
There remain indications that this will be a profitable partnership
for the Ibrox side in the future. At the moment, however, there are
signs that they have still to sort out a really, lethal understanding.
Until they do, Rangers may have to look for some of their goals arriving
from other areas of the team.
Unfortunately, Brian Laudrup and Paul Gascoigne don't look as if they
are going to get the goals which manager Smith may want from the
midfield area, and so the job may be left to young Charlie Miller.
On Saturday, though, he was one of the Ibrox casualties and was
replaced by Neil Murray at half time, further lessening the threat to
the Hibs' goal.
By Wednesday, when they meet the German champions, McCoist, that
renowned big game hunter, and his new Russian mate Salenko must have
their act together against a Borussia defence which has been leaking
goals in the Bundesliga this season.

SECOND DIVISION
TWO of Scottish football's most experienced managers got the chess
pieces out again on Saturday at Broadwood for a generation game.
Apart from Charlie Nicholas and substitute George McCluskey, Clyde
have a very young team whereas Stenhousemuir have been nicknamed the
''Thirtysomethings.'' It was a victory by 1-0 for Terry Christie's older
fellows.
Alex Smith's inconsistent youngsters squandered two early chances and
paid dearly.
New signing Paul Hunter set up the goal on the hour mark when he cut
the ball back for Ian Little to score. To add to Clyde's unhappy day,
defender Jim Brown was sent off.
The division produced three other red cards in the closing stages --
Don McVicar of Forfar, who lost to Tommy Graham's first half strike at
Berwick, Vinnie Moore, whose Ayr colleagues gained their first win
through a Paul Chalmers' header at Montrose, and Queen of the South's
Andy McFarlane. The Dumfries team surrendered an early lead at Methil,
where goals by Mark Donaghy and Gilbert Allan took East Fife back into
the outright lead in the division.

THIRD DIVISION
ONE of the recent wonders of Scottish football was how the rebel fans
at Meadowbank managed to secure thousands of signatures on their
petition opposing the club's move to Livingston, in view of the
desperately low attendances at the Commonwealth stadium.
Chairman Bill Hunter's decision to move the team franchise to
Livingston will be fully vindicated only when we see the size of the
crowd once Jim Leishman's men play in their new home next month.
For sure it will not be hard to improve on Saturday's figure of 227
who bothered to turn up to watch Livingston extend their 100% league
record at the expense of Albion Rovers by 2-1.
In contrast to the ghostly atmosphere at Meadowbank, a crowd of
1571 at Dingwall saw Ross County surrender a two-goal lead as goals by
Gary Wood and Graham Buckley earned Cowdenbeath a draw.
Caley Thistle had a 5-0 win at Alloa through a Charlie Christie
hat-trick and double by Ian Stewart.
East Stirlingshire scored first and last in the 2-2 draw at Arbroath,
while a second half double by Ralph Brand earned Brechin the points
against Queen's Park at Hampden.

HIGHLAND LEAGUE
HUNTLY'S well-earned reputation as Scottish Cup giant-killers is
enough to instil fear in any Scottish League club.
Yet, even by their standards, the sheer power and ruthlessness of
early season showings suggests another cup adventure is on the cards.
The Tigers disposed of Rothes in characteristically clinical fashion
in Saturday's Qualifying Cup second round. Front men Brian Thomson,
Martin Stewart and Craig Yeats (2) showed why Ross County and Caley
Thistle continue to eye their former Highland rivals with some envy.
Elsewhere, Peterhead's #6500 bargain buy, Paul Bridgeford, hit a
hat-trick as the Blue Toon cruised to a 7-2 demolition of Cove Rangers.
Peterhead now face an exciting showdown with league leaders Keith in
the quarter-finals. Keith survived some spirited Wick Academy
attack-play, to win 2-0, while Fraserburgh eased through 4-0 against
Forres, helped by a Marino Keith double.
Buckie Thistle made heavy-weather of non-league Golspie, but a 3-1
scoreline flattered Fort William away to Deveronvale. Brora Rangers and
Elgin, and Lossiemouth and Nairn have it all to do again.

The full details of all 12 singles matches from yesterday's
extraordinary final day of the Ryder Cup at Oak Hill.
Tom Lehman v
Seve Ballesteros
OFF-form Ballesteros crashed 4 and 3 to Lehman, and the Spaniard was
booed by the crowd when he asked the American to take a one-foot putt
again after he told him he had putted out of turn.
The Spaniard was wildly erratic over the front nine, but turned only
one down thanks to his short game. Lehman won the first with a par 4,
but the Spaniard chipped in at the second, sank saving putts of seven
and nine feet on the fifth and seventh, but had to concede the eighth
after carving another drive.
Ballesteros got up and down from sand at the tenth for a half, but
lost the eleventh, thirteenth, and fifteenth as his waywardness finally
caught up with him.
Lehman was inspired rather than upset by the one-foot putt incident,
winning the next two holes.

Peter Jacobsen v
Howard Clark
CLARK made the fourth ace in Ryder Cup history -- and second in as
many days -- at the 192-yard eleventh, then sunk a nerve jangling
two-and-a-half foot putt at the last to beat Jacobsen by one hole.
The Yorkshireman chipped in from rough at the second -- for a par, but
went one down at the par-5 fourth where Jacobsen holed a nine-foot
birdie putt.
Jacobsen lost his advantage when he bogeyed the fifth, but regained it
at the short sixth by pitching to four feet and sinking the putt.
However, he followed that with another bogey at seven and the pair were
all square at the turn.
Clark squared the match at the eleventh, but bogeyed the thirteenth,
Jacobsen the fourteenth, and when the American missed a 10-footer for
par at the sixteenth, the Yorkshireman led for the first time. He kept
his nerve over the final two holes to record his fourth singles win in
six matches.

Jeff Maggert v
Mark James
JAMES notched up Europe's first point of the day, beating Jeff Maggert
4 and 3. The Englishman was never behind from the moment he made a
20-footer on the second and sank a bunker shot on the fourth before the
American went into the creek at the fifth to fall three down.
It was only the second singles game James has won in seven cup
appearances.
James, like foursomes partner Clark a spectator since the opening
morning, holed a 20-foot putt on the second to go ahead, sank a bunker
shot at the fourth and went three ahead when Jeff Maggert hit his
approach into the creek on the ninth.
They halved the sixth in birdie 2s, Maggert holing from 18 feet and
James following him in from 15, but Maggert narrowed the gap to two with
a 12-foot downhill effort on the next.
James won the tenth, Maggert the eleventh, but the Ilkley-based golfer
holed a crucial 10-foot putt on the next and went on to take the match
with a five-foot putt at the fifteenth.
It gave Europe their first point of the day and cut America's lead in
the match back to two points at 10-8.

Fred Couples v
Ian Woosnam
WOOSNAM is still looking for his first singles win in the Ryder Cup
after Couples, who came from two down with five to play to halve with
the Welshman at The Belfry two years ago, staged another fightback.
This time two down with eight to play, Couples birdied the eleventh
and seventeenth to draw level and Woosnam then saw an 18-foot putt for
victory at the last trickle by the hole.
Couples had a stroke of luck at the first, where his drive hit a tree
and rebounded off a marshall and into light rough. He made par while
Woosnam bogeyed.
The 1992 US Masters champion three-putted the third, fourth, and fifth
-- missing twice from four feet and once from three -- to hand Woosnam a
two-hole advantage.
That was reduced to one when he bogeyed the seventh but he then rolled
in a 25-footer to reach the turn two holes ahead.
Couples cut the deficit to one hole with a birdie at the eleventh and
then drew level by sinking a breaking, 15-foot putt at the seventeenth.
Woosnam had an 18-foot putt to win the last -- and his first singles
match in the Ryder Cup -- but it trickled past the edge of the hole and
Couples, who had found the trees with his drive and sand with his second
shot, holed a four-footer for a half.

Davis Love v
Costantino Rocca
ROCCA failed to avenge his last-green defeat to Love at The Belfry two
years ago, going down 3 and 2 this time. The Italian, winner of three of
his first four games, went ahead at the second, but by the eleventh was
four down as Love produced sparkling golf.
Fittingly, the match ended in birdie 3s at the sixteenth, Love holing
from five feet.
Rocca, hole-in-one hero of the first two days and Europe's top
points-scorer with three wins out of four, struck first at the second,
but Love started to turn things round by pitching to four feet on the
fourth and hit his approach even closer at the seventh.
Love birdied the tenth and eleventh to open up a four-hole lead. Rocca
got one back at the thirteenth, where when his opponent ran up a bogey
6, but the next three were halved.
At the sixteenth, Rocca hit his approach to three feet, but Love
followed to five feet and made the birdie putt for victory.

Brad Faxon v
David Gilford
CREWE'S Gilford hung on for a vital one-hole victory, despite making a
bogey at the last. While he sunk a nine-foot putt, Faxon missed from
five for the half.
Gilford drew first blood, holing a 30-foot putt across the green at
the fourth for a birdie. He surrendered that advantage with a bogey at
the fifth and both players then birdied the sixth - Gilford holing from
12 feet and Brad Faxon following him in from seven.
Gilford bogeyed the seventh and Faxon the ninth to leave the match all
square going into the back nine.
Gilford regained the lead at the fourteenth, where Faxon bogeyed and
held it all the way to the last, where he hit his second shot into the
gallery and left his third in the rough.
He holed a brave, nine-foot putt for a bogey but Faxon, who was in the
bunker with his second shot, still had a five-footer for the hole. He
slid it by on the right and a relieved Gilford won by one.

Ben Crenshaw v
Colin Montgomerie
MONTGOMERIE gained the notable scalp of Masters champion Ben Crenshaw
by 3 and 1. Brought back from two up after eight to level after 12, the
32-year-old Scot birdied the fourteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth.
Montgomerie bogeyed the second, but Crenshaw dropped strokes on the
third, fifth, and eighth to give Europe's Order of Merit leader a two-up
advantage, only for Montgomerie to lose the 419-yard ninth to a par 4.
Crenshaw levelled when Montgomerie double-bogeyed the twelfth, but
Europe's leading money-winner for the last two years had a run of four
3s, three of them birdies.
He finished the match with an eight-foot birdie putt bring Europe back
to only a point behind at 11[1/2]-10[1/2].
CRENSHAW

Curtis Strange v
Nick Faldo
FALDO, one down with two play, won the final two holes for a
remarkable victory over Strange. The Virginian missed from 10 feet at
the seventeenth and from six at the last, where Faldo got up and down
from over 100 yards.
Strange, who beat Nick Faldo in a play-off for the US Open in 1988,
fell behind at the fifth when he missed a putt from little more than two
feet.
He squared the match with a birdie at the next and both players holed
long birdie putts at the 426-yard eighth.
Strange went ahead with a birdie at the eleventh and the Virginian
held on to his lead until the seventeenth.
He missed a par-putt from 10 feet and Faldo, putting along the exactly
the same line from around seven, made no mistake.
Faldo hit his drive into the rough at the last and could only lay up
with his second. But Strange put his second into the bunker and it was
all down to putting.
With Walton two up with two to play Faldo's win guaranteed Europe a
tie.
STRANGE

Loren Roberts v
Sam Torrance
TORRANCE showed the form which has won him three titles and taken him
top of Europe's Order of Merit this season with a 2 and 1 victory over
the previously unbeaten Roberts.
Torrance went ahead with a par 3 at the third and, after the American
had levelled on the fifth, took the sixth and ninth.
Par figures were good enough for the 42-year-old Scot, winner of only
one of his previous seven singles games in the cup, but playing the best
golf of his life this season.
Torrance and Roberts both birdied the eleventh, then the American
narrowed his deficit to one on the next. But Torrance was not to be
denied.
He made a six-footer to win the sixteenth and halved the seventeenth
to take Europe back level at 12[1/2]-12[1/2].

Corey Pavin v
Bernhard Langer
PAVIN, the man whose 20-foot chip shot at the eighteenth in the final
foursomes gave the United States a two-point lead going into the
singles, had four birdies on his way to a 3 and 2 three and two win over
Langer.
Langer was two down after four holes, Pavin grabbing birdies at the
third and fourth, but an eight-foot putt at the fifth cut the deficit.
The German hit his tee shot to three feet at the 167-yard sixth, but
he missed the putt and Pavin went two up when he holed from 20 feet for
birdie at the eighth.
Langer's response was to sink an 18-footer at the ninth to turn only
one behind.
Pavin increased his lead to two holes when Langer took two to get out
of a bunker at the twelfth and then made it three with his fourth birdie
of the round at the thirteenth.
There was no way back for Langer and the next two holes were halved.

Jay Haas v
Philip Walton
IRISH rookie Walton was the man who secured the point that won the
Ryder Cup back for Europe as he beat Jay Haas on the final hole.
Walton was three up with three to play but Haas holed his bunker shot
at the sixteenth and he then missed from four feet at the seventeenth.
Haas, however, made a mess of the final hole and a bogey 5 was enough to
give Walton victory.
Used only in one foursomes match on the first two days, cup rookie
Philip Walton won the opening two holes -- the first with a bogey five.
The American levelled by the fifth, only to lose the eighth to a
12-foot birdie putt from the Irish 33-year-old and the ninth to a par 4.
Walton won the fifteenth with a birdie to go three up with three to
play.

Phil Mickelson v
Per-Ulrik Johansson
LEFT-hander Mickelson made three successive birdies from the tenth to
beat his former Arizona State college golf team-mate Johansson 2 and 1
in the final singles -- but the destiny of the cup had already been
decided.
Despite losing the first with a bogey, Johansson made four birdies in
the next five holes and with Mickelson bogeying the fourth, found
himself three holes ahead. He bogeyed the seventh but still led by two
holes at the turn.
Mickelson made three successive birdies from the tenth to lead by one
hole but the match was irrelevant when Johansson bogeyed the 17th to
lose by two and one.
MICKELSON
Out: 4 3 3 5 5 3 4 4 5 - 36.

NICK Faldo, for whom in terms of major achievements this season has
been a constant disappointment, yesterday reassembled his swing's
fragile mechanisms and his noted resolve to come from one down with two
to play and beat Curtis Strange, his nemesis in the play-off for the
1988 US Open championship.
Thus, for only the sixth time in 31 matches, and the second on their
own soil, the United States were beaten in the Ryder Cup match. It was
the first time since 1985, when the event began to become a serious
contest, that Europe took a single series, by 7[1/2] points to 4[1/2] in
this instance, to win by 14[1/2] tp 13[1/2] overall.
Going into the last day in superb autumn weather at the Oak Hill club,
two points behind and faced with the seemingly impossible target of
taking 7[1/2] points from the 12 games to regain the cup, the Europeans
confounded critics of an ageing team's erratic form, dubious health, and
the singles order of battle to give Bernard Gallacher his due as captain
at the third attempt.
Gallacher and his opposite number Lanny Wadkins, could scarcely bring
themselves to watch the agonisingly, and slow unfolding of the climax as
first Faldo produced from oblivion an absolutely crucial point and
Philip Walton, one of Europe's only two newcomers to the contest, clung
desperately to his lead over Jay Haas.
America's downfall began with Strange, drafted into the side at 40 for
his experience and composure. But he missed the sixteenth green where
Faldo holed solidly from eight feet for par to square. Then at the last,
Strange, from a fine drive, came up short and could not save par,
whereas Faldo, having driven into trees, pitched his third to four feet
for the hole and the game.
Walton, aged 33, seemed to have control over Haas, 41, and playing
again after 12 years, when he stood dormie three. But Haas holed a
bunker shot to win the sixteenth and took the next with a remarkable,
and somewhat fortunate, shot from trees on to the green. Walton, also in
trouble, then missed from four feet for the match with his long-handled
putter.
Although the Dubliner drove into rough at the last Haas was again in
trees and after what seemed like an age, the hole was halved in bogeys
that may have been unprepossessing as a way to finish, but was more than
enough to trigger an explosion of emotional joy among Europe's players
and their supporters.
Gallacher later explained: ''This Ryder Cup's getting almost too much
to bear. The A-team in the middle of the singles order got the points I
wanted from them, but really all the players were magnificent over the
three days.'' There should be no disparaging comment now of inadequate
leadership.
Gallacher did seem to have deployed a high risk strategy, leading off
with Ballesteros, a wandering pilgrim searching for his game, Howard
Clark and Mark James, neither of whom had played since Friday morning,
and Ian Woosnam, like Ballesteros, at odds with his swing.
In the first instance worst fears were confirmed. Spanish pride and
passion were no substitute for the accuracy demanded by the 6902-yard
course set up for a US Open on which Ballesteros has never been
comfortable. The only hole he won was the second where he lobbed in a
chip for a birdie 3 to square, having hit his first drive unplayable.
Tom Lehman then took four of seven holes from the eighth, two with
birdies.
Clark had not played well since he finished second, albeit shakily, in
the Czech Open to return to the match after six years. Two shots in
particular steadied and encourged him -- the chip he holed to halve the
second in par and the No.6-iron shot he holed at the 192-yard eleventh.
The first time Clark led against Peter Jacobsen, at 41 the same age,
came at the sixteenth where the American drove into rough and Clark
recovered from a greenside bunker to two feet. An established exponent
of the cross-handed putting grip, Clark then holed from two feet and
three feet on the last two greens for Europe's second point.
James, another 41-year-old, gained only his second singles win in
seven tries, striding away from Jeff Maggert by winning three of the
first six holes in two under par. Like Sam Torrance and Walton, the
wielder of a broom-handled putter, James initiated the run with a
25-footer at the second and was never more than two down.
As Costantino Rocca did with Davis Love, so Woosnam had a rematch from
two years ago with Fred Couples. At The Belfry, Couples halved after he
had been two down with six to play and he escaped defeat again by
squaring at the seventeenth with a long putt for a rare birdie there and
then making a character-building half at the last.
Rocca, who lost to Love after having been one up with two to play, was
not seriously in the hunt after Love took four out of five holes from
the seventh, remarkably each with a birdie. Love's third point from his
five games must have come as a timely relief, for at that point the tide
was against the United States.
That reverse came about when David Gilford halved the last with Brad
Faxon, also in bogey 5s, and if that too was not the most memorable way
of winning since Gilford was ahead by the birdie 4 with which he took
the lead at the long thirteenth, was sufficient unto the day. Indeed
Gilford's putt of 15 feet was brave indeed for Faxon, rated the best
putter on the US tour, then missed from six feet for the hole.
Then Colin Montgomerie gained his second singles victory at the
expense of the Masters champion, Ben Crenshaw. At 43, he was his side's
oldest member, but one half his age would have been pressed to resist
Montgomerie's lethal finish. All square with four to play, Montgomerie
produced four successive 3s and since three of them were birdies that
was effectively that.
Hard on Montgomerie's heels came his fellow Scot, Sam Torrance. His
defeat of Loren Roberts, a newcomer to the match at 40, not only ended
the American's 100% record from three previous games but doubled his own
modest record in the singles from one win to two. Torrance won three of
his four holes with par figures, incidentally.
Meanwhile, the US Open champion Corey Pavin, who holed the chip shot
for the winning birdie in the final foursomes game on Saturday evening
which gave his side an apparently crucial two-point lead, continued in
unanswerable form. He was three under par for 16 holes in defeating
Bernhard Langer, twice the Masters champion, and becoming, with four out
of five, the highest points scorer on either side.
It was left to the two youngest members of the respective sides,
Per-Ulrik Johansson, aged 28, and the first left-hander to play for the
United States, Phil Mickelson, aged 25, to settle their personal duel,
whose result could not affect the match. In the end Mickelson recovered
from having been three down after six holes to take command on the
inward half.

BERNARD Gallacher, the 48-year-old Bathgate-born captain of the
victorious European Ryder Cup side, summed up his feelings and those of
his players after the closing ceremonies. ''It was a very emotional
afternoon, see-sawing from being close to winning to the moment of
victory itself,'' he said.
''We were a bit down after Corey Pavin holed that chip shot on
Saturday evening to put his team two points ahead. But we got the
singles order the way we wanted. It was always going to be close and I'm
just glad that after two defeats by one point and two points, it was my
turn to win.''
On that theme the American captain, Lanny Wadkins, remarked: ''I've
sat in their seats before, as one of a losing side, and it's not much
fun. The Europeans played composed golf and they've got a lot of very
solid players.'' He subscribed to Gallacher's final verdict: ''There was
nothing between these teams, just the best on the day won.''
Gallacher added: ''The important thing from this team's point of view
was that every player contributed a point. I couldn't single out any one
person for praise, and before I decide on partnerships and the order of
play I listen to people. I don't think there's anything wrong with
that.''
As for the captaincy in two years, when the match is at Valderrama in
Spain, Gallacher said: ''It won't be me. It's a question for the Ryder
Cup Committee to answer and that shouldn't be difficult if the person
asked wants to do the job. The only issue is whether he wants to be a
playing or non-playing captain.''
By coincidence, as the teams passed each other on the way in and out
of the media centre, Peter Jacobsen said to Ballesteros: ''See you in
'97.'' To which Ballesteros, who described himself as having hit ''three
fairways in three matches,'' responded: ''Yes, I'll be of the marshalls
looking for your ball in the rough.''
But the importance of the result was analysed by Colin Montgomerie.
''I was good for us, good for the European Tour, and good for you in the
media -- all down the line.''
Tom Lehman took the opportunity to clear up the incident on the
twelfth green when Ballesteros insisted he had played out of turn by
knocking in a putt inches from the hole which he had not conceded, and
that he insisted Lehman's ball marker be replaced because that was the
line he wanted to aim at.
Lehman said of Ballesteros, who more than once eventually conceded
very short putts his opponent had begun to line up said: ''I didn't
think he was being a gamesman at all. He had every right to have me put
the ball back down. So I don't think he was messing around with me. I
just think he was wanting to win'' -- which, of course, Lehman did by 4
and 3.

Falkirk 0, Motherwell 0
IT is going to be another one of those Monday mornings for the
faceless wonder at the SFA. He will be pleased.
Which faceless wonder? The one who clipes on people with whom the
football authority rules with absolute power and can send down
punishment like a head teacher to a first-year pupil.
Think about it. This little guy's face lighting up as he scurries
along the corridors to inform Mr Big that he's found another who would
dare speak his mind to the media, however justified. Pathetic, eh?
And whose name will be on the letter that will wing its way from Park
Gardens? The answer is Alex McLeish, and his ''crime'' will be for
asking -- politely -- if more could be done to halt his striker, Dougie
Arnott, and men like him, from being kicked more times than the ball
during a game.
''We keep hearing that the challenge from the back is outlawed,'' said
McLeish, his face like thunder after his Motherwell side had drawn at
Brockville. ''Well, you could have fooled me. Once again Dougie Arnott
has taken a pounding, and I feel that he is not getting the protection
he deserves.
''No doubt I'll have a wee word from the SFA about this, but I feel so
strongly. We talk about cleaning up the tackling side of the game, but
when you are being bumped off the ball by guys who are three or four
stones heavier, and it's blatant, well. . . Arnott has scars down the
back of an ankle.''
The big man shook his head, probably forming the opinion that he had
said enough. Pity, for young managers of McLeish's pedigree should be
listened to by the SFA and not threatened with censure for telling it
like it is.
Fans witness incidents, or they are shown them on TV, happenings that
are spoken about at length by the customers who keep the sport alive,
but, alas, because of out-of-date rules that are laughed at by other
sports, the ones at the centre of the proceedings are gagged. How daft.
Of course, it would be satisfying to report that this goalless draw
was worth the admission money, but it was only the Falkirk following who
did not have long faces after the final whistle. And the way their team
had performed until Saturday, anything would have been an improvement.
Falkirk's leader, John Lambie, slouched in his chair, going on about
how there was a ''big, big vast difference from what had gone on in the
past and was quite happy with the overall performance.'' Lambie is
easily pleased, for the fact remains that Falkirk made Motherwell keeper
Scott Howie really soil his gloves only twice, saves that were hardly
out of the top drawer.
Anyway, good luck Alex, when the letter drops. As almost everyone on
the planet knows, you were perfectly correct to have your say, and you
never know, perhaps some day the powers will realise that and get on
with improving the game at large.
But what will the faceless wonder do then?

Raith Rovers 3, Partick Thistle 1
RAITH Rovers could pay a heavy price in Europe as a consequence of
their victory over Partick Thistle in which three players were injured.
Striker Ally Graham, carried off with damaged ankle ligaments in the
win at Starks Park, is out of the UEFA Cup tie against Akranes in
Iceland. So is winger Tony Rougier. Midfielder David Kirkwood, who had
intensive treatment for a knee injury yesterday, will travel, but is
highly doubtful.
''I'll have to do without Ally and Tony, which is a great shame,''
said manager Jimmy Nicholl. ''Ally has damaged ankle ligaments and could
be out for a few weeks while Rougier has knee trouble.
''It's a pity because Graham troubled Akranes when he came on in the
first leg and I don't think they fancied facing him on Tuesday. I have
players who can come in and finish the job. We won't let these setbacks
affect us.
''At the start of this month I set my team a four-match target and it
was an achievable one. That was to beat Akranes at Stark's Park then
follow up with wins over Kilmarnock and Partick at home.
''The players are now 75 per cent of the way towards their goal, and I
could not be happier with our form going into the last leg.
''The performance and the goals against Partick delighted me. I
enjoyed it all and could not have asked for more. This sets us up nicely
for Europe.''
The reward for reaching the second round of the UEFA Cup will almost
certainly be a draw against one of Europe's leading clubs, providing
finance which has largely been denied Nicholl in his remarkable reign in
Fife.
A team assembled mainly from players cast off by other clubs and
augmented by the introduction of several youngsters from their youth
scheme has, nevertheless been able to match the best.
The catalyst has been Nicholl, a man who commands the total respect
and confidence of his players. His tactics, always geared to winning,
endear him to his supporters.
Their is every possibility that a more defensive strategy will be
deployed tomorrow night to protect their 3-1 lead against Akranes, but
Nicholl will demand his players pose a threat to secure the goal which
would virtually ensure their passage into the second round.
Colin Cameron, equally effective in midfield or attack, scored a goal
in each half and a searing drive from Jason Dair in 39 minutes ensured
victory.
But those injuries and an understandable desire to save themselves for
the task ahead allowed a Partick revival in which Rod McDonald pulled a
goal back, then Derek McWilliams had a penalty saved by the improving
Scott Thomson in the dying seconds.
Anything other than a win for Raith Rovers would have been a travesty,
given the outstanding quality of their play, and this was acknowledged
by Firhill manager Murdo MacLeod.
After seeing his unbeaten league record blown away, he admitted: ''I
badly need new players who want to play for this club. Right now, I have
too many who have the wrong attitude. I will be asking my board to try
to find the money to go into the transfer market.''
In the meantime, he will be without defender Grant Tierney, who
suffered a double fracture of his arm at Stark's Park.
The former Celtic striker, Dariusz Dziekanowski, today begins a week's
trial period. Now with Cologne, he is available for a nominal fee and
anxious to return to Glasgow, where he still has a house.
* JIM Duffy may gamble on striker Gerry Britton in tonight's Challenge
Cup quarter-final tie against second division Stenhousmuir at Dens Park.
Britton has missed the last five games because of damaged ankle
ligaments.
But Duffy, with an eye on the first division derby meeting against
rivals Dundee United at the weekend, may risk Britton for an hour.
Stenhousemuir manager Terry Christie will put in an important call
this morning to the Scottish League, with the hope that he can include
#20,000 signing from East Fife, striker Paul Hunter. Christie said:
''Paul tells me he is not cup-tied, and if that is the case I will
include him.

Hearts 0, Celtic 4
THEY may see things from opposite sides of the argument, but both John
Collins and Celtic manager Tommy Burns showed considerable courage at
the weekend, and maybe if they could settle their differences, the
merged strength of character could be a big asset to the club.
Collins, rightly or wrongly, felt he had to give his side of the story
after further speculation about his future at Parkhead. Burns reacted by
dropping his international midfield man on Saturday morning, and sending
him off to play for the reserves.
Collins took a gamble that his career with Celtic would be ended
without being certain of a future anywhere else: Burns took an even
greater risk, especially as he was taking a team to Tynecastle already
minus three top players, Pierre van Hooydonk, Andreas Thom and Phil
O'Donnell. Had the result gone the wrong way, the manager would have
suffered a great deal of criticism.
Instead, his relatively makeshift side produced their best result for
a long time and Burns could afford himself a satisfied smile. Now comes
the next hard bit. Unless he sells Collins this week, and Blackburn are
reputedly joining in the chase, he has to decide whether or not to bring
back Collins, smooth over the dispute, and get on with the preparation
for two vital games -- the European Cup-winners' Cup-tie with Batumi on
Thursday at Parkhead, and two days later the second Old Firm meeting of
the season, at the same venue.
Chris Hay and Brian McLaughlin did well for the club at Tynecastle and
are entitled to think they should be candidates for a place in the next
two games as well but, especially in the meeting with Rangers, the
experience and influence of a player of Collins' talent is hard to
replace.
The absence of suspended Peter Grant for Saturday's match, with
O'Donnell doubtful, makes the manager's dilemma all the more acute.
Burns said that he had left Collins out ''to avoid turning the match
into a sideshow.'' Asked if the demotion was a one-off situation, he
replied, somewhat cryptically: ''You never shut the door on anything in
football.''
Sod's Law being ever present in the old ball game, the man who wore
the Collins shirt, McLaughlin, scored twice, yet he had never scored for
the club at first-team level. In fact, despite the shenanigans that were
to follow, it was Brian's two-goal stint inside the first nine minutes
which virtually settled the points.
Hearts never abandoned hope, and had much of the play at times, but
there was never any danger of them catching, let alone overtaking the
Parkhead team. There was much argy bargy, of course, not assisted by a
referee who did not act decisively when it mattered, and was too strict
when it didn't.
The sending off of Peter Grant is a case in point. Despite all the
protestations, both from Grant and his team mates, as well as John
Robertson who was involved in the incident, the fact that the Celtic man
appeared to swing a boot at Robertson as they clashed off the ball in
midfield was an offence that would have warranted his dismissal. But TV
evidence showed him to be innocent.
Robertson had been guilty of responding with a push on Grant's face,
but quickly soothed troubled waters by politely helping Grant to his
feet. That subterfuge seemed to work because Robertson, who had been
booked earlier, did not receive any admonishment, yet the stand side
linesman, who was a lot further away from the incident than either of
the other officials, apparently saw Grant's so-called misdemeanour, but
not that of the Hearts man.
It was the linesman who brought the attention of the referee, who had
been no more than 20 yards away from the incident, to the collision and
once the two had conferred, referee Bobby Orr showed Grant a red card.
The Celtic man had also been booked earlier, but it seemd this second
offence was treated as violent conduct on its own. He may miss more than
just the Old Firm match as a result, when his disciplinary points are
tallied. But he and the club may approach the SFA in light of the TV
evidence.
There was a further red card to come, this time for Scott Leitch, who
got worked up when he was assailed by a posse of Celtic men and lashed
out at Paul McStay. Off he went, too. In all there were six yellow cards
and two reds shown, but it was by no means mayhem. Quite a few of the
bookings were marginal and generally there was more energy than malice
about the action.
Celtic could be well pleased with McLaughlin's contribution. His
opening goal was a quick reaction to a parry by keeper Craig Nelson of a
McStay shot, but his second, a raking run past a trio of defenders
before shooting into the net, was one he will cherish.
Hearts may have harboured some hopes when they came out for the second
half, but within two minutes they knew it was not to be. Andy Walker who
had already shown signs of his best form for some time, did tremendously
well to hold off challenges from Dave McPherson and Paul Ritchie before
steering the ball past Nelson. Grant was sent into the dressing room
four minutes later and Leitch joined him 15 minutes after that. Walker
chipped in the fourth and that was definitely that.
''What we need is not cosmetic surgery, but major surgery,'' said
Hearts manager Jim Jefferies who at least has been made aware quickly
how tough a task he has taken on.

WORLDWIDE
PRESIDENT Ramon Mendoza admitted yesterday that the package to rescue
Real Madrid had failed and that debts had risen to #62.5m.
In an astonishingly frank television interview, Mendoza revealed that
the Bernebeu board could find no solution to their escalating financial
crisis.
There is now the very real threat that UEFA could intercede and
forcibly relegate the stricken Spanish giants unless some fresh
initiative is forthcoming.
There was no sign of that when Mendoza said: ''The debt is now out of
control. There is not enough income to keep pace with interest charges.
''We could live with the problem as long as the team was winning, but
now that the form is not so good our supporters have turned against us.
''Perhaps if we were to win the UEFA Champions' Cup this would help
save us. If we don't, we will need a miracle .''
Real Madrid will also need a miracle on the park to dominate Europe's
premier event after making the worst start in many a year. Already they
have suffered defeat on three occasions in the Bernebeu and could only
manage a goalless draw against Betis Seville away from home on Saturday.
Reigning champions Ajax inflicted an opening defeat in the first round
of the Champions' League and Wednesday's home tie against their Swiss
opponents, Grasshoppers, is now one of the most critcical in their
history.
Real's former striker Hugo Sanchez has joined Austrian Second Division
club, FC Linz after an unsuccessful spell in his native Mexico.
UEFA must be hoping that this week's Champions League ties regains
some of the ground lost in first round.
Compared to last season at the same stage, the eight games attracted
258,000 spectators, a drop of 100,000. Three players were ordered off
and 20 booked as against two red-cardings and 25 bookings.
Bo Johansson will succeed Richard Moller Nielsen as coach of Denmark
when their interest in the European Championships is ended.
The Danes chose Johansson ahead of a short list which surprisingly
included Andy Roxburgh, Roy Hodgson and Morten Olsen.

NICK Faldo's gutty, come-from-behind victory yesterday over his old
rival Curtis Strange proved crucial in Europe's win over the United
States.
In a replay of their 1988 US Open play-off, which Strange won, Faldo
took the final two holes yesterday to give his team their first lead
since they won the first match on Friday.
''That was the biggest putt of my life,'' the big Englishman said just
after he holed a three-footer to beat Strange one up and give Europe a
13[1/2] to 12[1/2] lead with just two matches still being played at Oak
Hill Country Club.
''Everything was shaking but my putter,'' Faldo said of the winning
putt, which came after Strange missed a seven-footer that would have
halved their match.
Europe began the 12 singles matches with a two-point deficit, but
Faldo said his team-mates were not worried. ''Nobody talked about it
last night,'' said Faldo. ''Everybody knew we had to go out and win our
points.
''It might have been an advantage (being down), because we had nothing
to lose. Everyone just tried to win his match.''
Strange, who won the second of his back-to-back US Opens at Oak Hill
in 1989, was disappointed in defeat and admitted that his game might not
have been up to the most intense competition in golf.
''There is no-one in the world that I would rather go head-to-head
with than Nick. He's one of the greatest players in the world,'' said
Strange. However, the 40-year-old Virginian had not won a Tour event
since his victory at Oak Hill six years ago and his selection by captain
Lanny Wadkins surprised many people.
''I've been fighting my swing for three years. I don't know how long
I'm going to be able to keep fighting it,'' Strange said immediately
after his bitter defeat. ''Mentally I was fine, but my swing didn't hold
up. I didn't finish well.''
Strange said he expected to get criticised by the media after failing
to win any points in these matches.
''I probably deserve what I am going to get from the press about my
play,'' he said. ''But however they beat me up it won't compare to how I
will beat myself up. I can't believe we lost.''
Irishman Philip Walton admitted his nerves were jangling on the
eighteenth green -- even though he had two putts to beat Jay Haas and
bring the Ryder Cup back to Europe.
''I said to myself, 'just calm down, you've got two putts to make it,
why not use them.' It was an unbelievable moment,'' said the 33-year-old
from Malahide, Dublin, who was the last automatic qualifier for the
team.
Asked whether he knew the four-footer he missed on the seventeenth
green was for the cup, he replied: ''I had a feeling it was. There were
a lot of people around the green and I just pulled it a bit.
''I just tried to hit the fairway at the last and make him score 3. It
didn't work out that way, but I still managed to hold on.
''The support all week has been absolutely fantastic and there have
been a lot of people over from Ireland. There is a lot more pressure on
you when you are playing for a team.''
The European team sprayed champagne over an army of fans besieging the
clubhouse. Around 4000 Europeans, the Duke of York among them, swelled
the attendance to around 25,000.
Seve Ballesteros gave David Gilford a piggy-back ride while Ian
Woosnam pointed to Howard Clark and told the fans: ''You know he had a
hole-in-one today. Well now he's going to buy a round of drinks.''
Captain Bernard Gallacher told them: ''We would like to thank you for
your support and encouragement, you were all fantastic. We'll see you at
Valderrama.''
Gallacher said: ''To win the Ryder Cup back in America is a tremendous
achievement. I have kept saying there is nothing between the teams. The
best team on the day will win. Today was our day.''
Gallacher added: ''It was a very emotional afternoon. We were a bit
down when Corey Pavin chipped in last night, but we got the draw we
wanted in the singles.''
Asked how proud he was of his veterans, he replied: ''They don't think
they are veterans at all. They will be all be pushing for places in
1997, don't worry about that.''

EUROPEAN golf in general and British golf in particular is entitled to
bask in a little glory, an experience that, in team events against the
United States, is by no means a frequently recurring factor, writes
Raymond Jacobs.
Individual performances in the international arena have been more
frequent in their success. But with the men amateurs having earlier this
month regained the Walker Cup at Royal Porthcawl, the complete set of
three now occupies sideboards on this side of the Atlantic. For the
women, too, have more than made their contribution.
Last summer the Curtis Cup was retained after a halved match in the
sweltering heat of Tennessee and now, little more than a year later, the
men professionals have joined in the pleasurable, if admittedly
infrequent, activity of putting American teams in their place.
On this occasion the mixed representation of countries, with players
coming from Britain, Ireland, Spain, Germany, Sweden and Italy, meant
that before the match had even begun, as one sceptic at the opening
ceremonies last Thursday put it: ''Europe is already ahead of the United
States -- by six national anthems to one.''
Now all that remains is for the Solheim Cup to be returned to these
shores and a unique quintet may have been assembled. Next year, of
course, the women amateurs defend at Killarney, in Ireland, and the
women professionals later do battle at St Pierre, Wales.
The Ryder Cup must surely be unique among modern professional sports
in that the players on both sides receive no payment other than the
obvious out-of-pocket expenses. Yet, surrounding the event has risen a
vast and complex organisation -- cashing in on the exploits of these
unhired hands.
The thirty-first contest in the series, at the Oak Hill club in
Rochester, in upper New York State, was expected to generate $40m to
$50m in the region along Lake Ontario's southern shore.

WHEN you cut through all the thespian nonsense, there really are only
two types of actor. There are the ones who play themselves. Robbie
Coltrane is Fitz in Cracker but, let's be honest, Fitz in Cracker is
Robbie Coltrane. It's brilliant but it's not an act. Not really.
Similarly, Sean Connery is Sean Connery. And nothing ever changes; not
the accent, not the mannerisms. What you see is what you get.
Then there's the other kind. And the other kind is Bobby Carlyle. The
last thing he does is play himself. Which is why, right now, he's one of
the most powerful actors in Scotland. Properties do not come hotter than
Mrs Carlyle's wee boy.
A year ago it was ''Bobby who?'' But now it's different. They're
beating a path to his door with lucrative offers of film and TV roles.
The only problem is that Bobby's not at home right now. He's 200 miles
away from Glasgow, all dressed up in a police uniform, and driving a
Land Rover around the remote Highland village of Plockton.
Hamish Macbeth is back filming a second series. In one fell swoop, the
local population has increased by a third with an invasion of more than
80 cast and crew, ensconced in every available bed-and-breakfast house
over a 15-mile radius. And make no mistake, the villagers love it.
They're selling We Love Hamish T-shirts in the grocer's shop and one
enterprising landlady, who used to hand out tartan tins of shortbread to
her holiday guests, is now giving them pirate videos of the first series
as ''a wee minding of Plockton''. Canny folk, the Highlanders.
The original production brief for the series was simple. Zenith, the
independent company given the task by BBC Scotland, was asked to make a
drama series about a Highland policeman. They were told that it had to
do two things: it had to sell and it had to have legs. Consider it done.
Hamish Macbeth was a runaway success, exceeding the expectations of even
the most optimistic BBC executive.
No-one was more delighted than Bobby Carlyle. ''The thing is that
you're never sure what an audience is going to like,'' he explained as
he relaxed between scenes. ''They could just as easily have hated it.''
If truth were told, he worried more about the reaction from the local
community. He said: ''It's always difficult when you're making a
programme in Scotland, about Scottish things and about Scottish people.
You worry that you're going to get their back up right away because they
think you're going to take the piss. Now, having seen the first series,
they know that we weren't.''
Personally, Carlyle was happy with the first series which, he said,
served to establish the main characters. It worked best for him when the
storyline took it away from the normal -- like when the lobsters started
eating the dead body and then the locals started eating the lobsters.
That was an example of how a series could lift itself away from the
mundane and the predictable. It gave it a curious edge.
Danny Boyle, the Greenock writer who scripted most of the episodes, is
one of the best in the business, according to Carlyle, ''a true
black-comedy writer who can combine humour and tragedy''. But, as an
actor, was he worried, with the second series now being filmed and a
third in prospect, that he might become identified too much with the
character?
''I was aware that there was more than a possibility of that
happening. If I hadn't done anything else over the period then it could
have been a problem but, so long as I can carry on with my other work --
which is very different -- then it should work out. I mean, I'm
certainly not precious about it but I don't want to be known as Hamish
Macbeth or, worse still, 'Didn't you used to be Hamish Macbeth?' '' he
explained.
''I try to be very careful about the work I do. I am not a jobbing
actor. But I always think when people go away and do soaps, well, good
luck to them. They've got mortgages and bills to pay so circumstances
force their hands a lot of the time. Physically starving does make you
hungry for success, but it really does depend where your horizons are as
an actor. You have to push your boat out just that wee bit further. At
one point in my career I did nothing for two years. I was holding out,''
he added.
Carlyle first established himself as a film actor in 1990 with Ken
Loach's Riff Raff. But it was not until three years later -- with his
memorable performance as Scouse serial killer Albie in the first series
of Cracker -- that he really came to the public's attention. Since then
it's been, well, just one thing after another. There was Antonia Bird's
award-winning movie, Priest, and Go Now, a beautiful and very moving
drama (shown on BBC2 last week) about a young man stricken by multiple
sclerosis and how the disease affects his personal relationships. It is
no coincidence that both films were written by Jimmy McGovern, who also
scripted Cracker.
''Go Now was the most difficult thing I have ever done. The subject
matter was very, very tense. I felt a huge responsibility to get it as
accurate as possible and that's where the trouble started because we had
a very tight timescale for filming. It was only four weeks.
''I was pleased with it. Particularly when Paul Powell (the MS
sufferer who co-wrote the piece with McGovern) said that I convinced him
that I had MS. The thing about McGovern is that he writes with such a
fierce honesty and he can shock people without really intending to.
''If you look at the Albie character in Cracker, here's a guy who sets
out to kill 96 people but, the way McGovern writes it, you can have some
sympathy for him in the end. He just writes with this stunning honesty
and that's why people respond to him,'' he explains.
Immediately before he returned to Plockton, Carlyle completed work on
Trainspotting, a feature film adaptation (by the Shallow Grave team) of
Irvine Welsh's controversial novel about the Edinburgh drugs culture.
His role was about as far removed from Hamish as it is possible to get.
''I think there could be really heavy problems with a certificate for
Trainspotting because of what it deals with -- sex, drugs, violence, and
bad language. The philosophy of the film will also be a problem. It
speaks for a lost generation.
''It seems to me that, in Scotland in particular, there is an age
group between 18 and 25 who are told they are s**** and that there is
nothing for them. So they get into this nihilistic frame of mind. Now
people might look at the film and think that it advocates the use of
drugs. But it doesn't. It says that drugs are maybe okay if you can
handle them.
''It shows a variety of different characters who have been introduced
to heroin and how some of them react to it and others don't. And it's
suggesting that you have to be really down to get into drugs. It says 'I
might be in the gutter but I'm looking at the stars','' he added.
Curiously, Carlyle says that a character like Hamish presents as much
of a problem to him as his character in Trainspotting.
''A lot of the time it's much more difficult to be engaging than it is
to be nasty. And, to be honest, I do take it all incredibly seriously.
I've been thinking about it a lot recently.
''I was working on something and there was this actor who had to break
down and cry. When the director said cut, the actor left the room but he
was still crying. And that's the point. Just because the director says
cut it doesn't mean that your emotions leave you. And, when you're doing
maybe 15 hours a day, five days a week of anger you tend to take it home
with you. It doesn't go away.
''The tougher and more psychologically disturbing the character the
longer it takes you to cleanse the system. It's not about method acting
-- it's nothing to do with that. It's just that you're not in the mood
to go out and have a laugh with the crew. Anyway, I'm not a gregarious
person. I'm a dour-faced bastard, really,'' he added.
When he finishes work on Hamish, Bobby Carlyle plans to take a
well-earned (if indecently short) break before starting work on a new
film which will reunite him with Ken Loach. Shot in Glasgow and
Nicaragua, Carla's Song is at once a love story and a political thriller
set against the backdrop of the Iran-Contra affair. It also stars
American actor Scott Glenn who, Carlyle presumes (Loach hasn't told him
much about the plot as yet), will play some kind of sinister CIA spook.
What he does know, however, is that he will play a Glasgow bus driver
who, when he becomes involved with a Nicaraguan woman, departs for an
adventure in Central America. A stickler for verisimilitude, the
director has arranged for his principal actor to spend a week at
Knightswood Bus Garage. Carlyle (who only passed his driving test
earlier this year) suggests that Glaswegians keep off the streets in
November.
''Ken Loach is a wonderful director to work with. He'll put everything
he has into something but he doesn't believe it will change the world. I
remember a conversation some of us were having during Riff Raff. We were
talking about a particular scene in The Godfather II and we asked Ken
what he thought. And he couldn't tell us because he'd never seen the
film! He's just not interested.
''The thing with Ken is that he never works with the same people
twice. To him I'm Stevie in Riff Raff. But, though he is not really
aware of what's been happening in movies and television, he was aware of
what had been happening to me.
''Now, he took me for dinner a couple of times and we chatted. What I
didn't realise was that all the time he was trying to find out if this
was the same guy he met in 1990. Here was the king of social realism
asking me to go and make another film with him!'' The honour, one
suspects, is Loach's.
A lot of the time it's much more difficult to be engaging than it is
to be nasty. And, to be honest, I do take it all incredibly seriously

FIFTY miles north-east of Hyde Park Corner lies rural Essex
countryside steeped in England's heritage yet still, thankfully,
neglected by the weekend horde.
Few indeed have heard of names like Gestingthorpe, Toppesfield, Castle
Hedingham and Pebmarsh. Yet A12 drivers hell-bent for the east coast
seaside pass within a dozen miles of this haven.
Only comparatively recently has Castle Hedingham sprouted a rash of
antique shops, the hallmark of quaintness. Already these dusty emporia
outnumber the other shops in the main street. And no wonder. The village
is a piece of Norman England clustering about its castle and red
brick-towered church with exquisite Norman doors that today admit a 25th
generation of worshippers.
For 600 years the castle was held by the De Veres, Great Chamberlains
of England, and the huge keep they knew still soars dramatically from a
skirt of trees on the slope of the hill overlooking a compact little
community of houses that have seen a trio of centuries.
Nearby Great Yeldham is famous for a 1000-year-old oak. It stands at a
junction heavily propped with iron and concrete but still defying the
years. Together with a hollow elm in the beautiful churchyard, they are
the grand old men of this pleasant village.
Between these two communities runs a resurrected section of the Colne
Valley Railway, with steam trains and railway furniture of a bygone era
retrieved from miles around.
Gestingthorpe village was once the home of Captain Oats, who, with
Scott's ill-fated Antarctica expedition, walked out into the blizzard to
die, thus offering a better chance for his colleagues to live. In the
little 14th century church of flint and red brick there is a brass plate
which reads simply: ''In memory of a very gallant gentleman.''
Great and Little Maplestead are villages of rural charm. Little
Maplestead shares a distinction with London, Ludlow, Cambridge and
Northampton by possessing one of five medieval round churches built by
the Knights Hospitallers nearly 700 years ago.
On the Cambridge-Colchester A604 road east of Halstead are a string of
villages worth exploring. The township of Earls Colne may have lost its
medieval priory founded by the Earls of Oxford while even their tombs
have gone -- if only to the nearby village of Bures across the Suffolk
border.
The de Veres, a name that crops up all over north-east Essex, were
perhaps the county's most powerful and influential family. King Richard
II came to Earls Colne to clasp the dead hand of Robert de Vere, killed
in a hunting accident, whose meteoric career was the talk of all
England, for it was said that the King loved him more than his throne.
The urban jewel in the crown is Colchester, the first Roman city in
the land. Walk some of its hidden streets and it seems that time has
slipped back 1800 years. All through the centuries the Romans have been
here, and everywhere before your eyes are the bricks of Roman
Colchester.
They are present in their hundreds of thousands in arches and doorways
and windows, bricks the Romans made, the Saxons handled, and the Normans
used again; bricks that have seen the world go by from the Roman Empire
down through our own. Camulodunum was its name and its ancient castle
and the remains of its walls speak to one of the events during the
town's sacking by Boadicea in AD62.
A worthy climax indeed to a treasure hunt around secret Essex.

FANCY a holiday in Atlantis? Or strolling through a moonscape before
dinner? Both might just be available if you know where to look.
People have been searching for the Lost Continent for many years now
-- maybe 12,000 -- as that is generally held to be the length of time
since the fabled kingdom disappeared in seas of lava and maritime tidal
waves.
If it existed at all, that is. Plato, who did a lot of thinking about
Utopia and philosophy, once suggested that the catastrophe left only
seven mountain tops above the sea, making seven islands.
He wasn't in the travel-writing game and had no axe to grind, but
lesser mortals have no hesitation in pointing out that there are seven
Canary Islands scattered around the Atlantic, west of Spain, as Atlantis
is said to have been, and about as volcanic as you can get.
The most dramatic of all is Lanzarote, the fourth-biggest, just 68
miles off the African coast, and probably quite unlike anywhere you have
been before.
Had Plato been asked to abandon philosophy for a couple of weeks and
do a travel piece, he quite possibly would have argued that a holiday
should offer new and exciting experiences. So as you stand watching
lunch cooking on a giant grid over a volcano in the Montanas del Fuego,
your only thought of home might be: Why can't I get free fuel like this?
You are on an island which fires the imagination. The cliches have
already been used up in describing its eerie landscape. Volcanic debris,
petrified lava, craters, and acres of black ash amount to a lunar
spectacle which challenges not only the visitor's imagination but also
induces serious respect for the Lanzaroteans' ingenuity in scraping a
living.
The island's roads network has been greatly improved in recent years
to aid the tourist influx. Road signs are easy to follow, the directions
uncomplicated. All of this means it is easy to propel your hired Corsa
through a terrain so desolate and alien that you might as well be in a
lunar module.
Not much wildlife survives here, although goats still have a
600-strong foothold. If you are very lucky, as I once was, you might
spot a camel, munching morosely on some strange scrub which has survived
in the malpais (badlands).
All around are the volcanic mountains -- 300 of them in total -- and
the scatterings of rocks, lava caves, and ravines testifying to a
tumultuous past.
If indeed Lanzarote is a surviving fragment of Atlantis, it itself had
to go through nearly six years of volcanic nightmare between 1730 and
1736 when 11 villages and much of the island's agriculture disappeared
under a torrent of lava and rocks.
There were further eruptions in 1824, but the damage was done. This
was now an inhospitable island, and the surviving inhabitants had to
make the best of it.
Joined by returnees who had fled to Gran Canaria, they gradually
carved a living out of this moonscape, using the black ash to lay on top
of crops to protect them from fierce sun and winds, absorb the overnight
dewfall, and pass the moisture to the plants underneath.
Windbreaks constructed from volcanic boulders protected vines,
tomatoes, and banana crops from the wind, and even melons and tobacco
are now grown here.
Today they are reaping further rewards in a new harvest: tourism.
Planeloads arrive at Arrecife airport each day from all over Europe and
Scandinavia.
There might be mixed feelings about the impact of so many visitors on
an island of clear environmental interest. But Lanzarote has learned
from the errors of neighbours Tenerife and Gran Canaria.
Hotels and apartment blocks are strictly low-rise, their whitewashed
exteriors blending perfectly with the surrounding beaches with which
Lanzarote is blessed.
An island which comes as a bit of a shock at first sight has made sure
you can recover in luxury.
Its airport brings tourists from Britain, Germany and Scandinavia. Its
main resort, Puerto del Carmen, is a 10-minute drive from Arrecife and
offers everything the post-volcanic tourist could wish: superbly
comfortable accommodation, sparkling swimming pools, and a plentiful
nightlife which somehow rarely interferes with the serenity of the
apartments and hotels set a few blocks back.
All kinds of food are available and competition is fierce for the
tourist peseta. Incongruously, high-quality Indian and Chinese
restaurants vie for your custom with Mexican, American, Italian and --
of course -- Canarian cuisine.
A menu del dia can set you back as little as #5 (thick Canarian
vegetable soup, pork chops, and a banana).
All over the island are tourist attractions of an unusual nature. At
the restaurant atop Fire Mountain the food is barbecued on a huge grill
straddling a volcanic opening. That the volcano is still alive is
disconcertingly obvious, especially when a guide produces a ferocious
steam geyser by pouring water into a hole outside, then ignites branches
of scrub simply by placing them in a hollow only a couple of inches
deep.
There is the opportunity to take a bumpy and often hilarious ride up
the slopes of Fire Mountain on an ill-tempered dromedary. And a bus ride
later through the jagged and surreal acres of the Timanfaya National
Park, where the chain of eighteenth-century volcanic eruptions began,
gives an awe-inspiring insight into what can happen when nature's darker
forces are unleashed.
At El Golfo, there is the chance to stand in the shadow of a volcanic
cliffside and wonder at a stretch of trapped seawater forming what
appears at first sight to be a free-form lagoon, probably unique for its
emerald-green appearance and its dramatic setting.
The islanders might affect not to know the source of its striking
colour, but it seems clear that its high mineral content is the
explanation.
There are other resorts. One is the purpose-built and generally
luxurious Costa Teguise, haunt of Jordan's King Hussein among others.
Further north on the island, the volcanic caverns of the Jameos del
Agua provide an underground journey of a more restful nature, and lead
to one of the most beautiful man-made oases on earth, with blue waters
and palm trees.
Lanzarote is an island of contrasting beauty. If Plato had stopped
philosophising for a couple of weeks, he could have done worse than go
there for his holidays.

HEALTH and fitness is a serious business -- but that doesn't mean it
can't be enjoyable. At the David Lloyd Club, the objective is to make
working towards a healthy lifestyle even more than that -- it offers a
complete social experience.
The club, located a few minutes' drive from junction 27 off the M8,
can boast a healthy state of affairs. They are celebrating a successful
first two years by expanding the indoor racquet game resources, offering
more tennis courts and new badminton facilities.
Badminton is a sport which is becoming increasingly popular among men
and women of all ages as it can be played at a pace to suit all levels
of fitness. With their customary professionalism, however, the club is
in the process of negotiation with Gillian Martin, the Scottish number
one player, to provide badminton coaching at the club.
When the David Lloyd Club opened two years ago, fitness enthusiasts
flocked to the Cockleshill Park location to enjoy the benefits of seven
indoor and four outdoor tennis courts, four squash courts, a 12,000 sq
ft gymnasium, a 25m indoor swimming pool, and an outdoor pool of 20m.
When you add to that the Turkish steam room, a 25-seat sauna, the
state of the art aerobics studio, a hydrospa and spacious changing
rooms, it was no wonder that everyone from those simply wishing to
improve their overall fitness and body shape, to professional
triathletes looking for good training surroundings decided to join.
Despite the fact that David Lloyd, who retired from the professional
tennis circuit at the end of the seventies, had already opened eight
successful clubs in England, no one was prepared for the interest shown
by Scottish fitness aficionados. Already money has been invested in the
club, which initially cost #6m. The car parking facilities have been
extended and the gymnasium has been constantly upgraded with #200,000
ploughed into new equipment and expansion into what is currently the
juice bar area. The gym has a deliberate open plan design to give the
area a more social atmosphere.
Blane Dodds, the club's assistant manager who is also responsible for
promotions and marketing said, ''We're looking forward to the new courts
opening. The building work is on schedule for completion in mid to late
October. We will now be able to offer the three racquet sports --
tennis, squash, and badminton. This expansion has also enabled us to
open our tennis membership again, which was closed due to overwhelming
interest.''
Although tennis was undoubtedly the main attraction for many members
when the club first opened, half the membership had never played the
game before.
Staff at the club, which opens from 6.30am to 11.30pm 364 days a year,
are committed to their own areas, whether it be greeting members at
reception or serving in the restaurant. There are 12 qualified fitness
instructors who monitor the progress of each member. They are based in
the gym to make sure everyone is using the sophisticated equipment
properly, and deriving the greatest benefit from it.
On joining the club, each member is assigned to an instructor who will
detail what is required -- it could be a degree of weight loss or
fat-burning or working the heart and lungs -- always taking into
consideration the present level of fitness. They monitor progress,
changing the programme to suit the advances made.
The perfect way to fitness lies in the middle of the gym in the heated
25m pool. A curtain of air separates the pool from the equipment,
keeping the air round the pool at 82[DEG]F while the air in the gym
stays at a comfortable air-conditioned 62[DEG]F. The outdoor pool is
also heated and was a welcome oasis for suffering in this summer's
sweltering heat.
Although the clubs were sold to Whitbread plc a few weeks ago, David
Lloyd is staying with the company to monitor and guide the
ever-expanding network.
''The sale to Whitbread has given even more opportunity for faster
expansion,'' Blane Dodds explained. ''We have more clubs opening in
England in the near future and hope to be opening our second Scottish
club in Edinburgh by October of next year.''
Location is all-important to success, but the Renfrew club has proved
that if facilities that the public can't find elsewhere are provided,
they are willing to travel.
''We have a million people within a 15-minute drive radius,'' Blane
went on. ''Around a fifth of our membership is from Paisley and Renfrew
with the remainder travelling from areas such as the West End of
Glasgow, Newton Mearns, and Shawlands. Members from Bearsden drive
through the tunnel -- the membership has a very wide spread in social as
well as geographical terms.''
The notice boards at the centre are at the heart of the social
activities which the club provides -- from special new members' nights,
to weight control clubs, to disco nights. Hours could be spent at the
club, starting with a work out, going on to a swim and then finishing
off with a relaxing hour in the lounge, or even a special meal in the
restaurant.
The restaurant can also cater for special occasions held in the club's
function suite. Weddings, parties of any kind, and conferences can be
accommodated in the airy, attractive surroundings. Although they have a
degree of Scandinavian cool, they are warm and welcoming. Could there be
a healthier way to start your new life together or get your business
ideas off the ground?
We will now

INVERLEITH House, the junior school to Fettes College, is about to
open its doors to the most ambitious development in its history.
The #1m single-storey extension, which will be formally opened by Lord
Weir, Chairman of the Board of Governors, on Saturday is testimony of
the school's success over the past 10 years.
Four years ago, Inverleith's new senior house master, Andrew
Alexander, brought a different approach to independent day school and
boarding care. The emphasis was channelled towards creating a warmer
home from home atmosphere in which pupils would feel happier and more
secure whilst parents, especially mothers, would be more reassured about
their youngsters' wellbeing.
The new policy has brought about a 55% increase in Inverleith's pupil
roll call, with 101 boarders and day children attending and a lengthy
waiting list.
One delighted parent is Mrs Jane Henry, who has a 12-year-old son
James, as a day pupil at Inverleith. She says:
''It is wonderful to see how he has developed both educationally and
as a young person in his own right. Inverleith has given him confidence
and a truly developed personality.''
The cornerstone of the home from home policy is Inverleith's
flexibility towards the school day, which helps to integrate boarders
and day pupils.
In practical terms this means extending working school hours beyond
8.30-5.30 to accommodate day pupils working on late, doing homework
alongside their boarding friends either out of companionship or because
parents have late working commitments or unavoidable social
arrangements.
This extension of child care even includes overnight stays for day
pupils when a parent or parents have other pressures on their time, or
longer when they are away for entire weekends or lengthy periods.
''We can accommodate these requests at relatively short notice, which
for a great many of our parents has proved immensely helpful and has
been greatly appreciated,'' says Andrew Alexander.
' ''We see our pupils' education and personal development as a
partnership between ourselves and their parents. Only by working
together will we achieve the best for them.''
The new extension will provide an enlarged boarding wing for girls,
additional classrooms and offices, an assembly hall and girls' changing
rooms.
''The girls will enjoy new and expanded accommodation. Boys, too, will
have more space and room for themselves whilst the staff will also be a
lot less cramped. We're all absolutely delighted,'' says Andrew
Alexander.

WITH its soaring pinnacles and imposing Gothic facade Fettes College
looks the ultimate symbol of unchanging tradition.
However, in its 125th year, and with a #1m extension to its junior
house about to be opened on Saturday, a forward-thinking school of the
nineties is emerging from behind the old facade, building on its success
and popularity.
The school's academic and attendance record books show a catalogue of
achievement and growth.
Academically, 1995 has been the best year on record for Fettes, with a
99% pass rate for GCE A level examinations. Furthermore, 52% of passes
in the 651 GCSE examinations sat by 81 pupils, were in A grade and 21%
were A grade with distinction. Three pupils, including Samantha Brown,
gained A* passes in all the exams they sat.
Jonathan Bowman collected 11 A* grades, while also participating in
the successful school expedition to 8092ft Mt Fettes in New Zealand. He
then auditioned for the British National Schools Orchestra on the cello.
In growth terms, Fettes College is confounding national trends for
independent schools by actually increasing its boarder intake.
Last year the intake rose by 5.5% whilst this year the figures were up
by a further 2%, giving the College a total attendance of 485 pupils,
78% of them boarders in the main school and its junior Inverleith House.
However, the growth in numbers is only part of the picture. Fettes in
recent years has drawn pupils from a total of 48 different countries as
far afield as Papua New Guinea, Bulgaria, and Brazil.
Its character, however, remains resolutely Scottish, with 56% of the
school community being made up of indigenous pupils and 12% coming from
England and Ireland.
Malcolm Thyne took over as headmaster of Fettes eight years ago. His
policy of high academic standards coupled with a firm but fair
disciplinary regime has laid the foundations of the strengths and
successes the school enjoys.
Mr Thyne says: ''We have never in all my time here looked in better
shape. This year's GCSE exam results have surpassed all expectations and
everyone at Fettes has been absolutely delighted.
''Similarly, we are all equally pleased with the sure and steady
growth which the school is maintaining against all national trends in
the boarding pupil market. It reassures everyone from the Governors to
the teaching staff and pupils that we are getting it right and that we
are being recognised by parents as creating an educational environment
where excellence, both academically and in terms of personal
development, flourishes.
''Furthermore, I believe the international cosmopolitan character and
diversity of Fettes is a most valuable climate in which to prepare young
Fettesians for their lives to follow.''
However, an even greater factor in the re-defining of the character of
the Fettes pupil community was the introduction, 25 years ago this
month, of co-education. For die-hard Old Fettesians it was regarded at
the time as the ultimate body blow to the traditional ''rugger and
classics'' image of the school.
But with 160 girls representing 45% of the school's present
population, current perceptions about the move to co-education are now
very different. Parents, pupils and staff alike all acknowledge it as
the critical step in the re-building of the new Fettes College of today.
One Old Fettesian and parent of two present pupils remarks: ''It is a
very different place to the school I attended -- it's far, far better,
more enlightened and with better standards of excellence and personal
development all round.''
Mr Thyne says: ''I believe we have retained the best of our old,
traditional values and successfully married them with new and exciting
policies. There is no doubt that co-education has made Fettes a far more
civilised and healthier atmosphere in which both boys and girls can
prepare themselves for their future adult lives.
''It is a feature of school life that friendships made here so very
often endure long into their adult years.''
Co-education also brought with it a widening and enrichment of the
non-curricular and cultural activities of Fettes, taking the school into
the areas of music, drama and the arts. Today it enjoys the same
distinction and acclaim in these fields as it has previously enjoyed in
its sporting pursuits.
In four successive years the school has staged received productions on
the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, and this year they were its youngest
directors. The Chapel Choir has completed a successful tour of Eastern
Canada which culminated in a performance at the Parliament Buildings in
Ottawa, whilst the National Youth Orchestra has recently invited the
school's star cellist to an audition.
On the sports field, numerous boys have been selected for various
Scottish schoolboy rugby sides and a number of girls have been similarly
recognised for their prowess at lacrosse.
In squash, the Fettes head of school, Alistair Campbell, is Lothian
Schools Under-19 champion, whilst to demonstrate the successful
participation of girls in all aspects of Fettes life, head girl, Fiona
O'Reilly was one of only two pupils to reach the peak of the 8092ft Mt
Fettes in appalling weather conditions on a special expedition to New
Zealand earlier this year.
She, like all the other pupils at Fettes, exemplifies its modern day
credo of achievement by excellence and industry -- strengths which gave
the school its great past and which today are building for it an
exciting new future.

<TEXT>
I can think of no better way of illustrating for you the
transformation of our year from glory to gloom than to tell you about
Mossie's field of wheat.
On the last day of our tropical summer he cut half that field with his
wonderful new #160,000 combine. It has what Mossie calls a
''clapometre'' which tells you all you want to know about your crop as
you cut it. It will tell you to the pound per acre how many wet tonnes
you are harvesting to the acre at any instant. And if you are cutting
away from home it will give you up to the minute statements and print
out an invoice.
On that last glorious day, when Aberdeenshire was going to pay off its
overdraft at last, the clapometre showed that Mossie was harvesting just
over four tonnes to the acre. As it was at about 15% moisture the thing
could hardly have been better.
But when Mossie got back to that same field, a fortnight and a quarter
of our annual rainfall later, the yield had gone through the roof. The
clapometre registered eight tonnes three cwts. If you think that is good
you are showing your ignorance, just like the combine, for there cannot
have been any more wheat.
All the extra must have been water, sprouts, and roots. It is a fairly
complicated sum to work out, and the losses over the tail of the combine
will have been much greater after the flood, but the moisture content
must have been over 60%.
At commercial rates the man who dries that stuff gets a huge bill
instead of a cheque for his crop.
One of the depressing things is that so many people in the North-east
still haven't realised how bad things are. I met a man with several
hundred acres to cut yet and he told me, and I quote, ''Na, na. There's
not too much wrong yet as long as we get a good week this week.''
Either he thought his banker was listening or he's been assessing his
crops from the road. At fifty miles an hour the barley and oats look
O.K. and the wheat looks good if a bit black. But if you go in amongst
you see that they are ninety per cent sprouted. Unless it happens in a
malting shed, ''sprouted'' means knackered.
Because the thing has got so serious, none of the discussion group is
willing to be quoted. At times like this I wish they weren't real
people.
Mind you, Big Hamish has told the local evening paper that there is
none of his seven hundred acres that can be harvested.
One thing that is upsetting us is the misunderstanding about the
effects of the floods. The flood plains of the North-east have carried
much more water than usual. And many fields that normally get away with
it have been washed out in the biggest floods in living memory.
There is said to be a big bale of straw which has been left by the
receding waters half way up a tree on Turriff golf course.
But John Ross, the Scottish National Farmer's Union President, as
reported in the press, and the media in general, are making too much of
the effects of the floods, we think. It is not that such floods don't
devastate any harvest that is left in its way. What we think people are
forgetting is that this year the crops were knackered anyway.
It is true that those who have not been flooded can still salvage
their straw and this year that will be important. But the man who grinds
away with his combine and his drier chocking to salvage sprouted wheat
at 50% moisture is simply throwing good money after bad. At least if you
have been flooded you can get on with addressing the problem of how and
when to start ploughing.
Of course, I haven't found a farmer who will refuse EC compensation if
it can be won, but most feel that with high subsidies our case is weak.
On the other hand, we will be very aggrieved if compensation goes to
crops knackered by floods alone. The floods, photogenic and spectacular
though they were, have been only a small percentage of the problem.
Bad as this harvest has been for many, it has not been as bad as that
of 1281. I have that on the authority of an Australian film
actor-director for the Breadwinner and I have been to see Braveheart.
It is not a course of action which I would recommend to my fellow
farmers. I have told you often how lucky we are because, when we travel
the countryside we don't just see one damned field after another. We
farm the time away admiring and criticising the efforts of every farmer
along the road.
But that same interest in the soil fairly spoils a film. The harvest
field was a disaster. There was a tiny patch, maybe a quarter of an acre
of tiny stacks, and heaps straw had been left everywhere on the ground.
There was obviously a problem with staff on the farms even then or
they'd surely had somebody out with the smiler raking that up.
Mind you, it would have been a complete waste of time giving that (or
any other job in the real world) to the guy who tried to shovel earth
into the Wallace grave.
The Simmental Cattle were looking well, though, and there was I
thinking that they arrived in Britain in 1970. On the other hand there
were two magnificent Longhorns pulling a cart with William Wallace's
dead father and brother in it. They were a treat.
It was the first time the Farmer had been to the pictures for many
years and he was on the whole unimpressed. Indeed he was infuriated. Not
because there were times when you couldn't hear the action for the noise
of his fellow Aberdonians grazing, but by the fact that the huge troughs
they had their snouts in were of American Popcorn. It would have been
more bearable if they had been munching tattie crisps.

FARMER and champion fly fisherman Mike Forbes has found the ideal way
of spending more time on his favourite hobby -- by turning it into a
moneymaking extension of the farm business.
At Omachie farm, just four miles from Dundee on the A92 road to
Arbroath, he now spends two thirds of his time on his new project,
Kingennie Fishings. He has moved the farm office down to the fishings
and keeps in touch with the eight full-time staff by radio.
Any suggestion that he is using the fishings project as a guise to
allow him to indulge himself in his favourite pastime is firmly
rejected. ''I am in this to make money,'' he says. And it looks as if he
is on to a winner.
Mike is in partnership with his father Graham in the farm business
which is run in tandem with the wider Forbes family enterprise,
including East Coast Viners. The fishery, however,is his own baby -- a
#250,000 project which has to earn its keep.
Not only is it a welcome diversification -- turning a disused pond
into a money earning asset -- but it has also helped to maintain good
relations between father and son.
Mike and Graham had reached that delicate stage where father was,
wisely, stepping down to give the younger generation a crack at the
whip. He was still around and active of course and Mike's version of
events is: ''I was running the show -- and then he would come in off the
golf course and start putting his oar in.''
The potential for discord was avoided when Mike came up with the
fishing project which, he says, allows him to combine two jobs. ''I can
still run the farm the way I want it and I can also run the fishing
business which is something I love doing.'' Meanwhile, dad has resumed
responsibility for potatoes and cereals within the farming project. ''I
think our relationship has probably improved,'' says Mike.
The fishings are based on three pools, one of which appears to have
been created in 1855 -- the date inscribed on the boathouse -- to allow
the then occupant of the farm to enjoy an evening's fishing.
Two other pools have been pressed into service. One still is the
farm's irrigation pool and the other has been created from a marshy
area. Between them they offer a challenge for anglers at all levels of
competence.
The transformation began last year when Mike decided that the pool
beside the boathouse should be rescued from its derelict state. With the
help of a builder friend he took out 25,000 tons of silt. With European
larch harvested from his own woodlands he built pontoons as a platform
for anglers.
Bullrushes which were cleared from the pool were re-planted along the
edges. The irrigation pool was then drained and pontoons built there.
Finally the beginners pool, aimed mainly at youngsters, was created from
an adjacent marshy area.
''I wanted to take great care that the natural surroundings were
preserved,'' said Mike. ''I didn't want to take trees down or put in
concrete roads.'' The result is a secluded fishing area with a feeling
of isolation, and yet only a few miles from the bustling centre of
Dundee.
The close proximity of Dundee, with its large population base, is an
asset but is far from being the only asset, says Mike. He is approaching
the business on an international scale and has his eyes set on
attracting overseas visitors who will stay in the chalets which have
been erected within the complex. There are three already in use, one of
them specially adapted for disabled visitors. If things go well another
three can be added later.
Even the most enthusiastic angler is unlikely to want to cross the
Atlantic to fish in three man-made ponds, no matter how tastefully they
may have been created. Mike points to the proximity of Loch Leven, world
renowned for its trout fishing and to the North and South Esk --
prolific rivers for salmon and sea trout.
''The family already owns a beat on the North Esk and I have taken a
beat on the South Esk,'' he says. ''Now that the River Dee has gone over
to a catch-and-release policy a lot of its regulars have said 'no
thanks' so I have bought a number of days there. I think Americans will
love catch-and release.''
His idea is to put together packages for the top end of the market,
arranging top class angling outings for guests at the lodges. Golfers
will be equally welcome and again many outstanding courses are within
easy driving distance.
''For a corporate package we will pick them up at the airport, bring
them here, cook for them if necessary and arrange all their golf,
fishing, clay pigeon shooting or whatever else they want to do.''
He already has one $20,000 deal with a US firm who will take over the
complex entirely for a week -- all the lodges plus exclusive fishing
rights on the ponds.
As a former Scottish national fly fishing champion, and captain of the
international team in 1993, Mike is well placed to offer advice which he
does freely to those paying up to #28 a day to fish in the pools. A
formal lesson costs #30, however, and he has a back-up team of first
class anglers prepared to give instruction.
His plan, he insists, is not to spend his time going fishing with his
paying guests. His wife Gail might not accept that as a definition of
work. If anyone really insists that they want to spend a day with a
champion angler they will have to pay ''a lot of money'' for the
privilege,'' he says.
Mike is not afraid to charge for quality. The #28 day ticket for the
top of the range ''specimen'' pool makes Kingennie the most expensive
small water fishery in Scotland, but it is the only one with big fish.
The ponds are stocked with both trout and salmon. Fish sizes range
from about 1lb in the kiddies pool to 25lbs in the specimen pool. A day
on the middle range pool, with smaller fish, comes in at #14.
Each week the catch is checked and the pools are re-stocked
accordingly with 10% added for poaching and the occasional visits of a
heron which finds the pools a handy source of feeding.
While Mike provides the expertise the front-of-house operation is in
the hands of his sister Anna who has a degree in tourism and hotel
management.
She worked for a spell at Gleneagles Hotel before coming home to
Kingennie to handle the bookings for both the fishing and the lodges.
She is also taking lessons from big brother so that she becomes more and
more knowledgeable about the flies and rods and other equipment on sale
in the shop. She has been kept busy. The complex attracts about 200
anglers a week.
Meanwhile, Mike is still very much a farmer with responsibility for a
300-strong outdoor pig herd, 20 acres of strawberries which are picked
and packed for the supermarkets, 100 acres of broccoli, and 100 acres of
peas and broad beans. He is also involved in an outdoor pig business
near Lossiemouth with a cousin.
Dad, of course, looks after the potatoes and cereals but it was Mike
who drove the combine this year and got the crop in before the rain
came. ''We worked very late over a short period and harvested it all in
grand condition,'' he recalls.

THE size of this year's lamb crop has dropped -- partly as a result of
a fall in the number of breeding sheep, down 2% since 1992 at 3.7
million, and partly as a result of fewer lambs born -- particularly in
hill flocks.
The latter is a reflection of the long and difficult winter that ewes
came through the previous year, and demonstrates how long-term changes
in body weight affect reproductive performance.
Most sheep are in good condition owing to the dry weather, but because
drought on many farms has resulted in swards shorter than normal, any
sheep with missing or slack teeth will be much thinner than usual.
It takes a long time for ewes to increase in body condition. For
example, a 70kg lowland ewe in condition score 2 (thin) needs to put on
8kg of fat to get to the ideal score for mating. To do this requires a
diet that is twice maintenance and is fed for three months.
So thin ewes need access to better grazing if they are to be fit by
tupping time. Hill ewes face the same problem, and should be weaned in
August, not September, so they can get back in condition on the hill
while the grass there is still reasonably digestible.
Some sheep on the farm may be too fit at tupping time -- in particular
bought-in replacements, which are often pushed on for sales and can be
in score 3[1/2]-4. These replacements should be run separately on
stubbles to bring their condition down to score 3 before joining the
rest of the flock for tupping.
Once tupped, management should aim to maximise the number of embryos
that implant and produce a lamb. Known causes of mortality include
stress, mineral deficiency, rough handling, and long periods of bad
weather that interfere with grazing.
Thin ewes on the hill or on bare re-seeds going back in condition are
prone to ending up barren. They should be supplemented in bad weather
with big bale forage fed in sheltered areas.
Feedblocks can provide a useful supplementary feed that does not
interfere with grazing or cause feeding stress. One block to 30
ewes/week should be sufficient.
Too much feed after mating can also cause embryo loss. This is more
likely to be a problem in early lambing flocks, which should have their
access to grazing restricted (bare pasture).
Finally, it is worthwhile ensuring ewes do not get overfat two-three
months into pregnancy, as this causes appetite problems later on,
predisposing ewes to pregnancy toxaemia and other metabolic disorders.
Once ewes are safely tupped (six to eight weeks after the tup went
out) slim back overfat ewes by restricting access to forage to bring
their condition score back to 2[1/2]-3.
By ensuring, thus, that sheep change body condition over the yearly
reproductive cycle, the reproductive potential can be fully developed
and the ewe can transfer cheap grazing as fat in its body to times of
need.
John Vipond is senior sheep specialist with the Genetics and
Behavioural Science Department, SAC, Edinburgh.

<HEADLINE>Reservations about a trip to lowland crofting</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ROBERT ROSS</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>17</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976208052</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
JIM Sibbald, West Lothian Distict Council's planning chairman, spoke
last week of a rare idea -- one that created many winners and no losers.
He was referring to West Lothian's ''lowland crofting'' concept where
farms are transformed into a series of small holdings where rural
businesses can be sited.
The occasion for his speech was the coming to fruition of the first
lowland crofts development on the former West Harwood Farm, near West
Calder. The 220 acres are now home to 14 ''crofts''. Everyone approved
apparently and Scottish Office Environment Minister, the Earl of Lindsay
was lavish in his praise.
I felt like the only party pooper until I spoke to a few others and
found that we were all in some way disappointed. The problem was the
word ''croft''. We had built up this image of Richard Briers and
Felicity Kendal in television's The Good Life, lavishing tender loving
care on their broad beans and potatoes.
In reality West Harwood doesn't look like that. It looks more like
Cala Homes with acres of ground between the houses. Even Donald Turner,
who resigned as director of the Central Scotland Countryside to adopt
the role of developer at West Harwood, admits that the crofting title
has become a bit of a misnomer and and embarrassment.
The houses -- all to individual designs -- look out of place in the
countryside and he admits to wishing a few more were of traditional
rural design. However, 100,000 young and semi-mature trees have been
planted and in time they will provide screening which will make the
houses less of an intrusion.
Maybe it is true that fools and bairns shouldn't see partially
completed projects.
To be fair more than half of the modern-day ''crofters'' plan some
kind of business activity on the site. There is a sprinking of
small-scale builders, a lady who will provide stabling for 15 horses, a
breeder of Persian cats, and someone who plans to rear game birds.
It is perhaps significant that Lord Lindsay was wearing his hat as
Environment Minister and not Agriculture Minister when he performed the
opening ceremony. However, he argued that farming, forestry and
environment are inextricably linked, as demonstrated by the Harwood
project.
He hailed the idea as exciting, important, and innovative and forecast
that lowland crofting would become a household term. While some guests
at the ceremony (including me) had their reservations, he congratulated
West Lothian on realising that the role of a planning authority is to
guide and not to control in an absolute sense.
It was an example to planners everywhere that they should maintain a
fresh outlook.
On the plus side, he listed the benefits of new enterprises, new high
quality housing, and new opportunities which could not be accommodated
within existing buildings.
The area had been described as an agri-desert, although it is
acknowledged that such a description is a bit harsh. It must have
sounded particularly so to Bill Smith who used to farm the there,
running a 300-ewe flock of sheep, fattening cattle and growing barley to
feed his livestock.
However, he had reached his sixties and had no son to fill his shoes
so he determined to sell. There was one farmer interested in a deal but
by selling out for ''crofting'' he achieved a 20% premium over the
agricultural price, which must ensure a more comfortable retirement.
Donald Turner has plans for two other similar developments -- at
Stoneheap Farm, near the village of Bents, and at Woodbank Farm, near
Torphichen. The district council has earmarked five sites which it
thinks would be suitable for conversion providing 55 ''crofts'', 400
acres of trees and wildlife habitat and 10 miles of new footpaths.
In general, the plan is to split each developments into three segments
-- ''crofts'', trees and farmland leased to neighbouring farmers. In
that way, argues Donald Turner, larger and more viable agricultural
units can be created alongside the developments. In due course the
neighbouring farmer might take over the management of the woodland or it
could be purchased by one of the ''crofters'' as it reached maturity,
ready to be cropped and re-planted.
Perhaps the last word should go to planning chairman Jim Sibbald who
said that for his money the lowland crofting idea was better than
set-aside, and aesthetically that is true -- but it is permanent in the
sense that once houses in the #100,000 plus bracket have been built the
land it will never come back into mainstream agricultural use.

<HEADLINE>Scots breeders to the fore in Charolais sale</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>17</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976208053</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SOME of Scotland's top pedigree Charolais cattle breeders were amongst
the buyers at Saturday's production sales of the Maerdy herd belonging
to Esmor Evans of Mold, Clwyd, North Wales, and the Fairway herd owned
by David Fattorini of Tockwith, Yorkshire, who hosted the sale on his
farm; Skewkirk Hall.
Mrs Lucy Poett of the Harvieston herd at Dollar, Clackmannanshire,
paid the top Scottish price of the day -- 5500 gns for Maerdy Isabelle.
This two-year-old heifer by Maerdy United is in calf to Maerdy Jasmin.
Mrs Poett also paid 4000 gns each for two further females from the
Maerdy herd. The first was Halstead Fiona, a 5[1/2]-year-old third
calver by MMB Occidental, sold with her four-month-old bull calf by
Lamberhurst Volunteer at foot and in calf again to Goldies Harvey,
purchased for 20,000 gns at Perth October 93 when he was Reserve Supreme
Champion. Mrs Poett's other purchase was Maerdy Greta, a five-year-old
second calver.
Gavin Russell, who over the last 15 months has put together a pedigree
breeding herd of 160 cows at Barochan Estate, Houston, Renfrewshire,
added two more heifers to his herd. His more costly purchase at 4500 gns
was Maerdy Joy, a January 94 heifer by Echo and out of Maerdy Delyth --
a full sister to Maerdy Director, Perth Supreme Champion in October 89
and breed record price holder at 56,000 gns.
The day's trading saw 36 prices of 3000 gns or more, with prices
peaking at 7800 gns for Maerdy Hose, a three-year-old heifer in calf to
Goldies Harvey and sired by Tattenhall Impeccable.
The sale's second top price of 7000 gns was earned by Maerdy India a
2[1/2]-year-old heifer, in calf to Maerdy Forum. This heifer, by
Cockerington Baron, had been placed fourth in her class at last year's
Royal Show. She was bought by Robert Hutchison of Newark,
Nottinghamshire.
The Fairway herd, although hosting the sale, was well outnumbered by
the Maerday herd.
The top Fairway price of 4100 gns was claimed by the three-year-old
in-calf heifer Fairway Hola, a daughter of the Irish bull Drumlone
Censor. Hola was purchased by Ulsterman Michael Flannagan, who was just
one of 14 Irish buyers at the sale who bought a total of 33 lots --
helping to put a sound bottom in the trade.
Averages: Maerdy Herd: cows with bull calves, #2323.12; 11 cows with
heifer calves #3493.63; 16 in-calf cows, #2132.81; 7 heifers and calves,
#3120; 10 in-calf heifers (autumn calving), #2871.75; 44 in-calf heifers
(spring calving), 2597.55, 7 maiden heifers, #2632.50; 1 bull, #2625;
overall, 104 lots, #2663.87.
Fairway Herd: 12 cows and calves, #2791.25; 11 in-calf heifers,
#2548.63; 3 maiden heifers, #1749.99; overall 26 lots, #2446.15.

Paul Green, back on the business merry go round.
THIS week Paul Green and his business associates will sit down with
representatives of Glasgow East End communities and listen to their
proposals on how best to use a financial donation he has made to the
area.
The sum involved, #50,000, is insignificant compared to the
multi-million pound projects Paul Green's companies have been involved
in at The Forge shopping centre in Parkhead, Glasgow, or the Great
Western Retail Park on the other side of the city.
Asked if such a small sum warrants his personal attention, Green
explains that it is all part of his ''Project Dream Maker''.
Spotting a raised eyebrow, he explains that what people in the poorer
areas need are jobs, and he tries his best to provide these through his
various projects.
He operates a number of companies such as Ramjet Developments and
Atlas Investments throughout the UK but in Glasgow the figures show that
he has succeeded in providing job opportunities.
At The Forge more than 2000 jobs have been created while at Great
Western Park, the site of the former Goodyear tyre factory, 1400 are
currently employed, and, says Paul Green, in both cases 70% of the jobs
are taken up by local people.
His next project is at Darnley on the south side of the city where one
of his companies, London &amp; Clydeside Properties, would like to build a
retail warehouse and leisure park.
Both Glasgow District Council and Strathclyde Region oppose this move
as the land is designated as ''strategic industrial land'' but Paul
Green hopes to be able to persuade them to change their minds.
''I believe you should never do business unless you can smile,'' says
Paul Green, ''and the more jobs you can create the more self esteem you
give back to people.''
In addition to the 1400 jobs created at Great Western Retail Park,
Paul Green has contributed around #300,000 to local community projects,
and the #50,000 to the East End community is only his latest donation,
and he says it will not be the last.
''If the #50,000 works well then there will be more,'' he says. ''I
believe in giving part of my profits back to the communities where we
have developments.''
Although he is based in Jersey, Paul Green is a frequent visitor to
Scotland and is at present looking at several projects, one of them in
the Edinburgh area.
He retired to Jersey in 1984 after selling his then property portfolio
and successfully floating a law stationery company on the Stock
Exchange. He explains: ''I was only retired for a month then I got
bored, and my wife got fed up with me, so I started all over again.''

Inside Business
Today The Herald begins a weekly series highlighting the successes in
the smallbusiness sector that plays such a vital part in the Scottish
economic picture. The spotlight is on companies whose drive and
resilience have seen them through the bleak days of recession. Now their
energies are devoted to an expanding future. Harry Conroy reports
FIFTY highly skilled aero engineers faced with redundancy could find
themselves switching industries and starting new careers thanks to Tony
Boswell.
The plan is to retrain process and machine engineers facing redundancy
at Rolls-Royce to allow them to adapt their skills to the computer
industry.
Tony Boswell, boss of Retronix, has approached several companies
within the computer industry, and they have indicated their support for
the initiative.
Tony believes that fifty jobs could be found for retrained engineers,
and he has already approached Rolls-Royce, and those facing redundancy
to explain his proposals.
''We would only train people whom we reckoned we could get jobs for,
and we have spoken to companies in the industry who are interested in
offering employment to such people who have experience of working in a
highly complex industry.''
Tony Boswell certainly has personal experience of starting a new
career.
Three years ago he was a sales engineer in the computer industry when
he went along with his brother-in-law to a day seminar on
entrepreneurship run by Lanarkshire Development Agency.
This led to Tony forming Retronix which he launched in October 1992
with nine employees to repair faulty circuit boards and other computer
equipment.
Today, Retronix employs 1000 and Tony has plans to build a #500,000
factory in Coatbridge.
''I didn't even have the #50 for the one day course,'' laughs Tony.
''I had to borrow the money from my brother-in-law.''
Following the seminar, Tony signed up to attend an entrepreneurship
course which convinced him he could start his own company.
''I had noticed that many of the computer companies I visited had no
way of dealing with any faulty units they produced, and in many cases
they were just discarded,'' explained Tony.
LDA helped Tony put together a #90,000 package to start the company,
including #30,000 finance from the Bank of Scotland, and #10,000 each
from the job creation arms of British Steel and British Coal.
He also put his home on the line.
At present the Retronix has three small factory units in the Shawhead
Enterprise Zone on the outskirts of Coatbridge, and is taking over a
fourth but the plans are to move into a new custom-built factory.
''In addition to the employees we have in our factories we also have
staff in eight sites throughout Scotland, as we repair most units on our
customers' own premises,'' said Tony Boswell.

SCOTTISH industry Minister George Kynoch continues to clock up
thousands of miles of travel as he puts into practice his objective of
improving Scotland's export performance.
Yesterday he flew to Boston, USA, on a trade mission with
representatives of 24 Scottish companies hoping to create new business
links with North America.
The trip comes less than a month since the Minister led a group of
Scottish businesses to Taiwan and Hong Kong. He is hoping for a calmer
reception in America after his Hong Kong trip was disrupted by a
typhoon.
The Scottish companies, including textiles, seafood, and engineering,
will take part in what are called match-making sessions when they will
meet American companies which have expressed an interest in doing
business with them.
Although no significant orders are likely to be concluded immediately,
the trade mission is expected to lead to major future deals between
Scottish and American companies.
Trade mission organisers, the Scottish Council Development and
Industry, has mounted 262 missions to more than 50 markets since
pioneering such missions in the 60s.
Since then however there has been confusion in the business world with
the proliferation of public and private agencies offering such services.
The SCDI has attempted to cut down on the confusion by mounting the
Boston trip in partnership with the Government's Scottish Trade
International.
One problem for companies trying to do business in America is that
such trade missions do not qualify for financial assistance from the
Department of Trade and Industry which is attempting instead to
concentrate on the emerging Asian markets.
But as the USA is Scotland's third-largest market for manufactured
exports, the SCDI was keen to continue to mount trade missions there and
was able to do so with financial help from Scottish Trade International
and the Royal Bank of Scotland.

THE Royal Bank of Scotland and The Herald are again sponsoring the
Lanarkshire Business Awards.
They will join forces with Lanarkshire Development Agency and the
county's civic pride campaign, Supercounty, to back the third awards
dinner.
The awards, which honour the performance of Lanarkshire companies and
business people, will be announced in Motherwell's Civic Centre on
October 26.
Mr Terry Currie, LDA's director of business development, said: ''We
are delighted that since the inaugural ceremony in 1993, the Business
Awards have grown to become the key highlight in many business diaries
througout the country.
''It's Lanarkshire's chance to show the quality and varied skills of
the county's business community and to highlight how Lanarkshire is
re-establishing itself as one of the great business centres in Europe.
The fact that we are joined by the Royal Bank of Scotland and The Herald
reaffirms this fact.
''It also gives the sponsors the chance to recognise many companies
and business leaders who are helping to get Lanarkshire's message
across.''
The Lanarkshire Business Awards feature five categories including
Lanarkshire Business Person of the Year, which has been awarded
previously to Alan Wiseman of Wiseman Dairies and John Crawford of
Motherwell Bridge.
Other categories include: the Small Business award; export award;
quality award; sub Contractor award.
Other successful companies who have gained a Business Award include
Peter Tilling Plastics, Inver House Distillers, Philips Business
Communications Systems, and Oakwood Foods.
More than 400 businessmen and women from all over the county attend
the award dinner which includes two top class speakers.
In the past, the event has heard from Lord Whitelaw and Alf Young,
economics editor of The Herald.
Nominations for 1995 are collected from the local enterprise network,
including LDA, Scottish Enterprise, Strathclyde Business Development,
and the five local enterprise trusts.
Companies are given an on site assessment by a panel of judges before
going forward to a shortleet of firms. The Lanarkshire Business Person
award is given to outstanding individual whose leadership qualities are
helping to fuel Lanarkshire's regeneration.

SCOTTISH AMICABLE, the Glasgow-based leading life office, is in talks
with Alliance &amp; Leicester, Britain's fourth largest building society,
which could lead to to some form of tie-up between the two mutual
operations. The discussions initially centred on the provision of third
party servicing for the building society's life business following its
decision to launch a life company.
However, there is now speculation that something more substantive,
possibly even a full scale merger could be contemplated though, equally,
the talks may come to nothing.
As it is, Scottish Amicable is examining its future strategy,
including the possibility of demutualisation by turning itself into a
public company although various options are likely to be considered and
no decisions have yet been taken.
ScotAm has said it is not actively considering a change. A merger with
a building society and possible demutualisation thereafter could,
though, be a tasty package in stock market terms.
Alliance &amp; Leicester has been considering considering a flotation but
would probably need to merge with another building society fist to
launch a successful flotation.
If not a building society a well regarded life office would be even
better if an agreement could be reached.
Meanwhile, Edinburgh investment fund managers Ivory &amp; Sime are
believed to be about to announce the purchase of specialist
venture-capital fund manager Baronsmead. The purchase will about double
the venture capital funds to #200m.
The deal, estimated at about #3m, comes under the auspices of Colin
Hook, Ivory &amp; Sime's managing director who moved over this year from
Caledonia, the Cayzer family's investment company which now owns nearly
30% of Ivory.
It would follow the recent purchase by Ivory &amp; Sime of Clan Asset
Management which was 75% owned by Caledonia. Ivory &amp; Sime now has some
#3000m funds under management.
Baronsmead, which has #90m under management, is launching an
investment trust next month specialising in the new Alternative
Investment Market (AIM).

BANKING
DUTCH banking group ING, rescuer of the crashed Barings merchant bank,
is joining the raidly expanding cross-border electronic banking network
IBOS (Inter Bank On-line system), whose technology is operated by a
separate holding company IBOS Ltd jointly owned by Banco Santander, The
Royal Bank of Scotland and EDS, with Goldman Sachs also holding a small
stake.
ING, third largest banking group in the Netherlands in terms of assets
and ranked 58th in the world, becomes the third European bank to join
the IBOS Association this year.
The IBOS system provides instant branch-to-branch banking across
frontiers allowing commercial, corporate, and private customers of
association member banks in Britain, Spain, France, Portugal, Belgium,
Denmark, and Italy to treat branches of all the banks as if they were
there own.
IBOS, which has seven member banks, has also expanded its coverage to
North America through First Fidelity Bancorporation -- one of the 25
bank holding companies in the US.
Norman McLuskie, managing director of the The Royal Bank of Scotland's
operations division said: ''ING is yet another first-class partner for
the association and is a major extension of the IBOS network. The
Netherlands is at the centre of European trade and its addition
highlights the growing importance and potential of the system.''
ING Bank executive Ad Adriaansen said: ''The link into the IBOS
network offers ING Bank a platform for developing advanced value-added
services for cross-border cash management. In the fast changing world of
international trade and commerce where speed is paramount, it is
essential that we are able to deliver to our clients the most efficient
and reliable methods of managing their international funds.''

BRITISH manufacturing capacity should be able to expand at 3.6% a
year, according to a report from the Foundation for Manufacturing and
Industry, a business think tank.
The report opposes any deliberate policy of slowing the rate of growth
of manufacturing output because of fears that capacity restraints will
spur inflation.
Dr Andrew Sentance and Dr Rebecca Emerson of the London Business
School say that there may be a case for pushing up interest rates
slightly from their current level of 6.75% to counter the upward
pressure on inflation from a weak exchange rate, higher commodity prices
and indirect tax rises, but the existence of capacity constraints in
themselves does not provide support for such a move.
They show that cuts in UK manufacturing capacity in the late 1970s and
early 1980s were more than reversed in the late 1980s. The rising trend
came to a halt during the recession but unlike the early 1980s, the last
recession did not see reductions in total UK manufacturing capacity.
The report also highlights the contribution of more effective
management and changes in working practices for the growth of
manufacturing capacity.
This strong productivity trend gives grounds for optimism about future
capacity growth, says the report. It says that with the recovery now
firmly established, manufacturing should be able to expand at 3.6% a
year.
The report gives two reason why lack of manufacturing capacity is not
a serious threat to the UK recovery. First, manufacturers are increasing
their investment, particularly in industries where capacity constraints
are greatest.
Second, high utilisation of manufacturing capacity has not been
associated with upward pressure on wages and prices across the economy
as a whole. The authors say the current situation is different from the
late 1980s when reports of capacity restraints were accompanied by
balance of payments problems and rising inflation.
The key difference is that recent manufacturing growth has been
strongly export led, while other sectors of the economy, more dependent
on consumer spending, have been held back by tax rises.
The authors say that as long as the economy as a whole is not too
buoyant, the current reports of capacity constraints should be seen as
''growing pains'' of manufacturing industry, which will ease as the
effects of higher investment come through.

STANLEY EVELING makes claims that his new play, his first in 12 years,
is a tragedy. If it is, then it's a tragedy in sit-com clothing. A
sit-trag perhaps.
Its focus is on a middle-class nuclear family -- two grown-up
children, inexplicably tardy in leaving home, their intelligent but
frustrated mother and their academic father who, like his wife, is going
through a mid-life crisis.
Thematically it sets itself somewhere between Ibsen's The Master
Builder (the father at the top of his profession and the end of his
career with grand ambitions still to fulfil) and Sartre's Huis Clos (the
tragedy is that these characters are tortured by the inescapable horror
of their own personalities).
Aside from that, we're on Eveling's home territory of abstract
philosophical debate made flesh through the lives of ordinary people.
There's a lively energy to the playwright's dialogue, and his big
speeches clearly bring out the best from the actors in Sandy Neilson's
absorbing production for Fifth Estate. But while Eveling's weakness for
smart-arse one-liners -- clever but not funny, intelligent but not
insightful -- is largely tempered by the drive of his language, language
alone cannot get round the play's central problem of how to create a
modern-day tragedy.
Having spent the play moaning at some length about his lot, the father
is eventually brought low by the realisation of a deeper conceit -- his
own hypocrisy. It's a strong moment, but the revelation isn't compelling
enough for a tragic end to seem inevitable. This uncertainty presumably
accounts for the odd out-to-audience address with which Eveling feels he
has to round off a generally engaging but ultimately elusive piece.

FROM an attention-catching introductory voice-over, describing the
state of affairs in Denmark in BBC World Service-speak, to a conclusion
which exploits to the fullest the horror of the onstage carnage, this
production by the Scottish-based Theatre Babel successfully realises
their intent of addressing a younger generation.
Director Peter McAllister has crafted a a compelling piece of theatre
with the slimmest of resources, opting for a stark set -- Elsinore is
simply represented by a square sheet of metal over which his actors
practically glide -- but achieving visual dynamism through inventive
lighting and precise movement, with every entrance a formidable one.
There is a spirited and varied use of music, which seems more informed
by filmic soundtrack than stagecraft, with snatches not only
exacerbating atmosphere between scenes but also often acting as
background to onstage dialogue -- a device which works remarkably well.
The company's catering for the Tarantino generation is evinced on a
superficial level with our first glimpse of Hamlet in Reservoir Dogs
attire -- sharp dark suit and blacked-out sunglasses, his mourning gear
-- but also through an ironic edge, with flashes of black humour, eg,
the tarty Gertrude increasingly fumbling through her handbag for Valium.
The company's command of language is occasionally shaky, with a
sprinkling of fluffed or strangulated lines, and the self-conscious
ironic performances sometimes pitch into unnecessary melodrama but this
is a stylish, vital, and impressively accomplished work.
Incidentally, contrary to reports from the Ticket Centre, there are
still tickets left for their performances at the Tramway this week, when
they present Hamlet in a repertoire bill with Romeo and Juliet.

Clare Henry in celebration of a remarkable artist who is in Glasgow
for an eightieth-birthday exhibition that includes a wide cross-section
of his life-time's work
AS a boy William Crosbie arrived at Glasgow Academy in the 1920s
speaking only Mandarin Chinese. Already he knew he would be an artist.
Now 80, he is bright-eyed, agile, and sharp as a tack. ''And I still
keep my cheque book in Chinese!''
So how was it in Hankow in 1915 or at Glasgow School of Art in the
1930s? Or in Paris when surrealism was at its height? What's it like to
look back on a lifetime of painting? Crosbie has all the answers.
''When you're young you live in the realm of objectivity; when you're
old, in the realm of subjectivity. The first half of life is a period of
gestation; you're just fumbling. You're so full of training and anxiety,
there is no 'you'. The second half is more fun. You're putting out what
you know; what you've learned. That's why the Chinese venerate old
age.''
Dressed in his distinctive black beret, wearing cuff links with the
Academy crest (a present from his mother whom he idolised), Crosbie is a
distinctive Bohemian-looking figure, in Glasgow to celebrate the opening
of his 80th birthday show at Ewan Mundy Fine Art -- and to join his old
school for their 150th-year celebrations. ''I was a bit disappointed. So
few of my contempraries were there.''
But I promise you won't be disappointed with his exhibition: an
impressive collection of top-class work which demonstrates both his
versatility and superb draughtsmanship. It ranges from a 1934 student
abstract, Heart Knife, on loan from the Scottish National Gallery, to
brand-new still lifes wet off the easel. ''The Protestant work ethic is
a great thing. And it keeps you out of mischief.''
Despite an unusual start (''I was brought up by an ayah in a Chinese
family''), he has accrued a vast reservoir of wisdom which he
distributes with engaging wit.
With his mother's backing, and despite objections from his engineer
father, he got to Glasgow Art School where he was a brilliant student.
In 1935 ''the heavens opened! I won a travel scholarship: #120 for three
years''. Riches indeed. On to Paris, studying in Leger's studio; hawking
his pictures around the streets with Vlaminck. (''We couldn't sell them
even at 300 francs, and the exchange rate was 117 francs to the
pound!'')
He went on to earn a successful living as a professional artist,
supporting wife and daughter by tackling ''any damn thing that turned
up'': oils, portraits, book illustration, sculpture and murals for
architects Jack Coia and Basil Spence. ''Where there's a will there's a
way! If daylight is available, you should be working! I believe if the
energy is there, it has to make something.''
Glasgow's training was, says Crosbie, exceedingly thorough, but it was
still rooted in the nineteenth century. ''When I got to the Beaux Arts
in Paris it was just as bad -- that's why I went to Leger's studio. You
had to prove you could draw before he'd take you. I could certainly do
that!
''There were four of us, a Japanese, a Chinese and a German woman from
America. We were encouraged to look, then work from memory, not from
life. He never gave advice, only criticism. He used to say my work had
''too much volume'' -- ironic when you think of his own style!
He also studied with ''old man Maillol'' the famous sculptor. ''It was
a really happy time. I washed dishes; swept up the leaves in the
Luxembourg Gardens; they weighed them before they paid you! I had a room
high up under the roofs of Paris. I found like-minds, imagine the thrill
for a 22-year-old!''
He also went to Egypt. ''I had to cross the border to get my visa
stamped every three months anyway. Also, I'd been reading Flinders
Petrie. In Cairo I got a job copying the frieze of the newly excavated
Temple of the Bulls.'' Egypt inspired two pictures on show at Ewan
Mundy, one a surreal Flight Into Egypt.
Careful with his grant, he arrived home in 1939 with #60 in hand,
offered himself to the navy (who turned him down saying no war was
imminent), so rented D Y Cameron's superb studio in Glasgow's Ruskin
Lane, where Pavlova had danced.
''My name was mud. I had gone off to Paris and come back with new
ideas. Scotland doesn't like that!'' After the war (he was eventually
conscripted), he bought the studio for #400. He painted many of his best
pictures in this haven of delight.
The exhibition contains an important group of early radical abstracts
done in Paris, several splendid linear self-portrait drawings (including
one painting of himself and Hugh McDiarmid which surely the Portrait
Gallery should buy) and a handful of stunning big early oils from the
1930s and 40s.
Cats Cradle, 1943, fresh as the day it was painted, shows Crosbie in
his garret. ''I had one room. I painted in one corner, cooked in
another, slept in the third, and abluted in the last!'' There are
several lovely, characteristic nubile nudes, plus some landscape
drawings (cheap at around #400) and a Glasgow Jug still life (#4800).
''I took a shine to them; I had about 40 jugs. The other vases and
dishes I often make up.''
For years Crosbie was best known for his murals. I remember seeing him
paint the one in Edinburgh's City Art Centre cafe around 1980.
His first mural was for the 1938 Empire Exhibition in Bellahouston
Park. This was followed by schools and churches. He worked closely with
Coia and Spence. Both also bought his pictures. His father, a Wee Free,
was appalled at his son working for Catholic churches, ''he thought the
disease would spread through the whole family!''. Crosbie was especially
good at dealing with the scale necessary for big walls.
The sketch for one project: City &amp; Park, 1940, for Glasgow Police
headquarters, exemplifies Crosbie's attractive mix of the surreal and
everyday. Here Glasgow's skyline sits under a floating park where
children play and architects plan.
Meanwhile, men fish with ropes through holes in the sky like puppet
masters pulling civic strings. One chap is sawing off the top of a
ladder which protrudes upward. Allegorical snakes and ladders? Crosbie
explains: ''We all live on two planes. We present one facade in public;
the other in private. Both provide us with datum.
''No-one is satisfied with only one plane. I got to know the police
well. We had a rapport. Sometimes the constables came to the studio at
5am as they went off duty and we had tea and rolls. In another sketch I
put two policemen inside a gasometer having a smoke. It was my little
joke!''
Crosbie is a delight -- so too is his work. See it at 211 West George
Street till October 5.

The Bank of Scotland is supporting arts events in its tercentenary
year with an extra #3m worth of sponsorship. KEITH BRUCE finds out what
it expects to achieve
IF YOU were paying attention, there was no way the arts-lover could
have avoided the Bank of Scotland this year. The bank's money was
helping to fund productions at around half the regional theatres in
Scotland. It put up the cash for a new initiative at the Scottish
International Children's Festival, and backed Scottish Opera and
Scottish Ballet.
At the Edinburgh Festival it made possible Philip Prowse's lavish Don
Carlos for the Citizens' Theatre, and it took over the sponsorship of
the hugely popular fireworks concert after Glenlivet dropped out.
But the remarkable fact is that you had to be paying attention to know
that. It would have been perfectly possible to attend half of these
events and be unaware of the common link. Perhaps you may have noticed
the bank's logo on the publicity for one of them, but will you be
rushing to switch your account?
As surely as the Government tries to justify its level of arts funding
by pointing to the importance of the contribution of the private sector,
arts organisations will point to the fickleness of such support. It is
not something they can budget for in an era when government funding
agencies are demanding three and four-year plans, they say. It is the
icing on the cake.
Such remarks are disingenuous. Commercial sponsorship very often makes
the difference between something being well-produced or not, between it
being effectively promoted or not. Remarkably, it can be money with
fewer strings attached to it than public funding.
In some respects the core question is why commercial companies bother
to sponsor the arts at all? Often, as we have seen, there can be little
to show for it. This newspaper has a policy of acknowledging sponsorship
on reviews, yet critics often miss the support credit because the
profile of it has been so modest.
The Bank of Scotland has been celebrating its tercentenary this year.
They hope you have noticed. One of the ways it did so was to add #3m to
its sponsorship budget for this year only. The arts received a generous
slice of this and the support covered a remarkable range of events from
the National Mod and the Scottish Fiddle Orchestra to TAG's Lanark, and
a vast geographical range.
Their strategy might have come from swallowing the Arts Council's line
about access to the arts wholesale -- except that the Arts Council has
nothing to do with the bank and the bank's staff thought it up for
themselves and implemented it for their own reasons.
It will come as little consolation if they have just charged you #15
for going over your overdraft limit, but the philosophy stems from
governor Bruce Patullo's belief in ''putting something back from whence
it came'', and much of the bank's purpose in marking the tercentenary
was to acknowledge the support Scotland had given the bank over the past
300 years.
''It is the same policy we apply to arts sponsorship generally,'' says
the man in charge of it, Eric Scott. ''We spread it across as many art
forms as possible and the widest possible geographical spread, from Wick
and Thurso to Dumfries and the Borders.''
Marketing director Iain Fiddes notes that touring companies tend to
benefit because they fit in with this aim, but acknowledges that the
bank will also deliberately invest its largesse in an area where it is
trying to make a commercial impact.
It is this mix of philanthropy and commercial hard-headedness that
makes commercial sponsorship so hard to call for arts organisations. The
bank -- for example -- is hardly likely to make publicly available its
own development plans and give the Royal Bank advance notice.
The bank announced its tercentenary celebration plans last December,
although it had been working on them for some eight years. It was,
predictably, inundated with sponsorship applications -- around three
times the usual number, although no-one wants to say what the usual
number is.
A committee chaired by the company secretary and including the
governor and deputy governor was officially in charge, but the
''sleeves-up'' work was done by Scott, Fiddes, Stuart Murray, and
others.
All three are reluctant to give me figures that are a matter of public
record anyway, since they were announced at the time of the event they
supported, and there is no way they are telling me what sort of
percentage of their total sponsorship budget is represented by the
tercentenary year's #3m hike.
So it is almost surprising that they are prepared to explain why they
chose to spend the money in the way they did and what they expect in
return.
''We identified things we wanted to be associated with and went for
specific one-year opportunities,'' says Scott.
Troubled Scottish Opera are, he says, well aware that they cannot
expect another six-figure sum like the contribution to David Leveaux's
Marriage of Figaro, although the bank remains a supporter of the
company. Ditto Scottish Ballet, which received slightly less for Swan
Lake and a small-scale tour. Pitlochry cannot expect to have its whole
season sponsored, just the usual single production.
Scott says there was never anything as structured as a fixed sum
earmarked for the regional theatres of Scotland, but the regional
theatres have certainly benefited. Fiddes explains that this was because
of a conscious decision to devolve decision-making to the bank's 17
regional offices where the area's director of banking operations was
empowered to vet and support applications in his area.
The complaint that sponsorship tends to gravitate to the safe and
middle-of-the-road is gently refuted with examples such as Lanark and
the bank's growing association with Ian Brown's Traverse Theatre. ''We
try to understand what things are going to be like before we back them,
and we've never had a problem,'' says Scott.
''A very strongly political production might make us stand back
because of our non-political stance, but we always take along guests and
pay attention to their feedback,'' says Murray.
''We've introduced a lot of people to ballet and opera because of
that. It is not an objective of what we do, but a spin-off and the
artists are very good at giving of their time to speak to us,'' says
Fiddes.
The good news for the arts is that none ofthe men saw any reason to
change their current approach. The bank is satisfied that it is reaching
the market it wants to with sponsorship ''as part of the mix''.

THIS is the season of siren sounds. Those of my generation recall the
haunting wail, exciting and alarming, that meant: ''They're after the
Clyde again, out your beds and take cover.'' Others may think first of
the mythical and comely sirens who beckoned unwary travellers with their
forefingers and other parts of their anatomies.
Either connotation will do in the political conference season. Here we
have the Liberal Democrat leadership again beckoning to the Labour
party, and vice versa. You can rely on this happening every autumn just
as you can count on marvelling again at the gleaming brown beauty of the
horse chestnuts, spilled out of their fallen spikey shells.
Here we have the Prime Minister, gesticulating to Sinn Fein leader
Gerry Adams, much like a boxer at the weigh-in: ''A return to violence?
Who is going to return to violence? Put up or shut up. I'll take you in
round five.'' He might have added that his fight promoter, the Irish
premier John Bruton, agrees with him.
Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten (I think we can address this
pre-Blairite, Tory Blair thus familiarly -- he eschews the Governor's
traditional feathery hat and breeches), belatedly begs the Government to
relent on passports for three million ''or more'' citizens. The Home
Secretary Michael Howard, an unwary traveller if ever there was one,
knocks back his erstwhile Cabinet colleague.
He has to make another feisty Tory conference speech next month.
Political whirlpools to left and right, he must avert his eyes from the
prospect of granting three million full British passports before China's
take-over of Kong Kong in 600 days.
Patten argues that even if they all came here, they would do the
economy a lot of good. Essex man, I guess, winces at this worthy
proposition, concerned that Hong Kong industriousness might do him out
of even more job security.
Everybody is after Essex man these days, even Paddy Ashdown who
pitches the ''honest politics'' line to him. Mr Blair woos his vote with
street cred. The Tories are still working out how to get him back. The
new Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind beckoned to him last week, with a
robustly Little England approach to the European Union and the Brussels
apparatchiks. Sir Teddy Taylor (Southend) noticed this, as did other
Euro-sceptics who are now promising to be ''as good as gold'' at the
Tory conference.
The siren sound of the season comes from the Treasury Ministers. There
is no doubt that Essex man will find this one alarming. At best, he is
7p in the pound worse off under this Government; at worst, he has had
his home devalued in the market, if he has not had it repossessed.
What he is hearing from Chancellor Kenneth Clarke and his No 2, Chief
Secretary William Waldegrave, is the unmistakable Treasury raid warning
that he has to take cuts in state services if he wants any part of his
7p in the pound back. The Treasury Ministers' quandary is unlikely to
reconcile lost Tory voters, in Essex or anywhere else.
The right thing to do to stand a chance at the next election is to cut
taxes now and cut them savagely so that the benefits can be felt in the
voters' pockets within a year to 18 months. At least, the Tories could
then claim to have restored taxes to below the level they were when they
were last elected in 1992. This is the siren call from the Tory back
benches.
This is the proposition that beckons, but is being rejected. Clarke
and Waldegrave, indeed Heseltine and Major, are trying to make a virtue
of necessity because such cuts on this Budget Day November 28, seem to
be beyond them. So they rely on financial prudence so far, even if it is
going to hurt. They might get away with it at their Blackpool conference
next month. The Tories long for unity as much as Labour longs for power.
The nation is still deeply in debt after the recession and the debacle
of the Exchange Rate Mechanism; more so than the Chancellor forecast
last autumn. Experts are looking at a Public Sector Borrowing
Requirement as high as #33billion this year, slightly less next year,
and not dropping sharply until 1997-98. Too late for the political cycle
to help the Tories.
So far on this issue the spending Ministers have been taking cover as,
week after week, the Treasury siren sounds. The National Debt of about
#330bn requires no less than #25bn a year to service. That is #25bn that
the taxpayer has to find.
Despite all this, Mr Blair is convinced that the Chancellor will find
a way to reduce the tax burden by between #2bn to #4bn. A much-flagged
part of this could be the Prime Minister's pet, reduction of inheritance
tax; this might even help the hard-pressed housing and construction
industries.
So Mr Blair has been very careful to say that he believes that the
nation is in no mood for increased taxes, whether under a Tory or Labour
Government. It is just short of a promise not to revoke a tax cut. But
if it is to be the inheritance tax that is cut, what will Mr Blair and
Labour do? To accept it as a good thing would be a really radical
manifestation of New Labour philosophy.
What, allow the sons and daughters of the rich to keep more of their
inherited wealth? Well, yes actually, if it means that the far more
numerous sons and daughters of the middle classes can do the same. These
folk are now regarded by Labour as their natural supporters and vital to
putting the party back into power.
Rab C Nesbitt, whose ability to bequeath is questionable, is good for
a laugh, but would you rely on him to make it to the polling station?
Even if a Labour limo was despatched to get him there? Those limos are
destined for more cost-effective journeys on election day. Perhaps then
Mr Forsyth would send one round for him in Govan on the off-chance. Or
Mr Paddy Ashdown, who is all things to all men?
I rather think, as Mr Blair has discovered, that there are always too
many siren voices on the Nesbitt way to record his cross on the ballot
paper. The underclass, after all, is capable of waxing long and lyrical
about the sad beauty of a fallen chestnut.

IF you want to do something by stealth, first choose your target with
care. If you want to put in place an experiment which will sound the
death knell of a national system of health care as you and I know it,
select somewhere outside the media-infested central belt. Make sure it's
in that rare geographical location represented by a Conservative member
of parliament. And have to hand neat piles of sticks and carrots with
which to manipulate the participants.
The template for this strategy was struck in Ayr where Scotland's
first trust status hospital was created with all these elements in
place: a Tory Minister at the constituency helm, a local health board
who enthusiastically embraced private medicine, a medical staff advised
not to publicise their reservations under pain of sudden unemployment,
and a new hospital which was to be promised all manner of technological
goodies dependant on the level of its ideological soundness.
And with this stalking horse up and trotting, the full-blown game plan
was put in place with most of Scotland's hospitals advised that their
funding status was essentially about to be dependant on the trust
variety (or, in some cases, trust status their only defence against
closure). By now all pretence of this being a device to encourage
healthy competition between health ''providers'' had been abandoned.
With whom is the Aberdeen Trust supposed to be in competition? But now
comes an even more significant threat. And if the Stonehaven proposal is
not fully exposed and fully resisted then we will all be guilty of
helping our health service to bleed to death.
The scenario is not complex. The area has two hospitals which, it is
generally agreed, need replaced and upgraded. They offer a wide range of
health care from geriatric to acute beds. Grampian Health Board began
discussions with the Scottish Office for a new hospital. Perhaps they
thought it wouldn't hurt that the local MP, George Kynoch, was now a
Minister.
The Scottish Office had a suggestion. It would agree to a new hospital
under certain conditions. These essentially were that all the hospital
services be put out to tender.
Not just the meals, the laundry, and the cleaning, but the lot. All
medical care too.
No agreement, no deal. No hospital.
The local health council was put in charge of a local consultation
exercise to ask the views of the populace. They held eight meetings of
25 people each, most of them at times of day when the populace could be
depended upon to be about their lawful gainful employment. Many of those
who did make the meetings reported that the one question they were not
allowed to ask was why the hospital was being put out to tender. That
was a political question and not part of they remit, they were told.
The findings of that consultation exercise are being collated and will
result in a tender document within the next two or three weeks. That
tender will be advertised Europe-wide. Those of you with memories of the
trust exercise will remember that one of the clarion calls was that it
would make management truly local.
How that chimes with a potential investor from mainland Europe hiring
the staff and calling the shots may not be entirely clear to you. It
isn't to me.
Meanwhile the local health care provider, Grampian Health Care Trust,
suddenly finds itself cast in the role of stray bidder for what are
currently its own services. It might win the contract, it might not. In
the meantime it, too, has been advised of new ground rules.
Because of the Government's new private-finance initiative, it, too,
has been obliged to advertise for private-sector partners before it can
put in an offer. Already 30 private companies have expressed an interest
including bankers and builders. You may rightly assume they are not
contemplating a late change of career direction into appendectomies.
What they sniff is profit. Profit comes from keeping costs down. The
major cost in hospitals is salaries and equipment. Draw your own
depressing conclusions.
Local pay bargaining within the NHS is a disruptive enough thought.
But here we have a real possibility that several different health
providers may carve up the contracts and pay different rates to nursing
staff within the same unit. We already know that private-health insurers
have no enthusiasm for non-fast profit-generating sectors like chronic
sickness, mental illness, or geriatric care.
What happens if nobody but the local trust offers to cover these, and
it loses out to a cheaper bid? According to the local health board they
will insist on a quality threshold both in the initial contract and
subsequent management. But given how they were manoeuvred down this
route in the first place, how free a hand will they be given? And what
if a private health provider wins the contract then bails out halfway
down the agreed period? It appears that only two other places in the UK
have been talked into putting health care itself out to the vagaries of
the market-place. One in England, one in Wales.
Neither is yet operational. So the Stonehaven experiment is just that:
a dogma-driven attempt to create an appallingly dangerous precedent.
Last week I went up to the area to make a radio programme where all the
participants in the debate would have their say. They did. And even
those who had no philosophical opposition to being able to use private
health care were unanimous with the others in wishing the local health
professionals to be allowed to continue providing care in the area.
We have reached the stage today in Scotland where the medical
profession has quite literally been frightened into silence.
Only those who have left or retired now feel able to register their
profound alarm at the dismemberment of the NHS. It's therefore down to
the rest of us to defend the service on their behalf and in our own and
our children's interest.

FORMENTOR
ALMOST 30 years have passed since I last saw Majorca. My, how the
place has changed, and not all for the worse. In those days Franco's
police were notorious, scowling as they lounged in doorways when they
were not routinely shoving tourists off the pavements at gunpoint for
the crime of coming too close.
Intimidated by this memory, I thought twice about asking a policemen
where I could find a late-night taxi. The chap smiled, saluted, and
promptly barked a command into his mobile phone. A taxi duly
materialised. He even opened the cab door and waved us a cheery
goodnight.
For which, Sir Teddy Taylor and Bill Cash please note, a prayer of
deep gratitude is due for the European Union, without whose generous
economic help for Spain and Portugal the bad old days of fascism could
still be with us. These are still countries in difficulty. In Spain,
with the highest unemployment in Europe, there are those who remember
fascism with fondness. But, with the EU underpinning democracy and
freedom, even the polis are smiling and friendly. Pity it doesn't work
everywhere.
John Major spent a wet weekend in this sun paradise on the theme of --
in his words -- ''Europe, whole and free.'' He was talking in the
context of bringing in new members from Eastern Europe whose own
totalitarian past is still fresh in the memory.
Like some Spaniards and Portuguese, there are still impoverished
Hungarians and Poles and Romanians and Slovaks who sigh nostalgically
for the age in which all was peace of a communist kind and jobs were for
all if you did not know what you were missing in the way of reward. The
EU will have to spend widely and wisely to change that mindset.
With EU enlargement in mind Mr Major came to Majorca determined to
give his fellow heads of government a dose of Euro-realism. He said he
was fed up with European leaders talking about arcane issues like
institutional reform, while unemployment rose and public sympathy for
the new Europe dwindled.  And for once, in matters European, John Major
could claim to have had a good summit.
Germany's leaders came to his aid by endorsing what Major has been
saying for years -- that a single currency is not as simple as it
sounds, and the conditions for joining it are perhaps not tough enough.
Mr Major could thank Jacques Chirac, obscured by nuclear fallout, for
taking the heat.    When the leaders discussed enlargement of the EU --
the biggest issue facing the present 15 member states for the
foreseeable future -- there was, rarely, no dissent from Britain's view,
forcefully put by a Tory Prime Minister who is usually regarded as the
Community's maverick.
But the bad news for Britain and particularly for Scotland is that
after Majorca the EU enlargement process is getting serious and that
means an awful lot of aid is soon to disappear Eastwards. Britain
receives billions of pounds from Europe in structural funding and
farming support. Plainly, the EU 15 cannot hope to become 27 eventually
without funding the admission of the continent's poorest states
currently clinging to the wreckage of communism.
Mr Major came to Majorca with a costing. By his reckoning the EU would
have to spend an extra #29billion annually on the common agriculture
police (CAP) and structural funding of the type which benefits Highlands
and Islands as well as the rusted central belt of Scotland.
It was the first time anyone had put such a precise figure on
enlargement. Spending on this scale won't happen, of course, because as
the Prime Minister pointed out, there must first be reform of CAP and
the structural funds. To an extent this suits Britain's book, Mr Major
will argue, because farming in the UK is more efficient than on the
continent, and CAP -- already consuming half of all EU spending -- is a
scandal anyway.
He will find it less easy to lose structural funding which is fine for
our rundown areas but also an embarrassment. After all, we have had his
party in power for more than 16 years and we are now reduced to seeking
structural assistance in places like Highlands and Islands, London,
Merseyside, and other areas, because Britain has become comparatively
poorer. Watching the money vanish in favour of even needier people will
be painful but at least it will be the end of a political embarrassment.
For the first time we also heard Mr Major say he is ''relaxed'' about
whether the Maastricht Treaty, as revised by next year's super-summit
and reviled by Eurosceptics, is signed by Britain before or after the
next General Election.    Most EU leaders now accept privately there is
no chance of doing a deal with Britain as long as the Tories persist
with their increasingly anti-EU rhetoric. When the time comes for
joined-up writing on the treaty -- the dab is likely, EU leaders
calculate privately, to be done by Tony Blair.

TONY BLAIR
By John Rentoul
Little, Brown &amp; Co: #16.99
THREE days before John Smith died and the course of Labour history was
changed again for ever, there was an extraordinary conversation in the
office of the Leader of the Opposition. He and one of his advisers were
discussing, with what they did not realise was a misplaced
lightheartedness, the need for Smith to take more care with his health.
''What would happen?'' asked Smith, with apparent curiosity. And then
before his friend had a chance to change the conversation, he answered
his own question. ''It's got to be Tony, hasn't it?'' he said.
Was it really only just over a year ago? It is one of the oddities of
political life -- or, more specifically, death -- that suddenly, as a
result of one event, one candle being extinguished, everything is
altered utterly.
In dying, John Smith had the most profound effect upon those he left
behind. In the first place -- infuriatingly for the party he had led and
then left -- and in a manner he would himself hugely have resented, he
inadvertently saved John Major from the Tories. It was immediately
evident that a wave of national mourning had rescued his drowning
political opponent.
What is fascinating is to learn from this book that with his customary
acuity, John Smith had already replied to a question others had not even
set themselves. Political journalism is such that one always has one's
eye on the upwardly mobile, the people Most Likely To; yet on the day he
died, required by the grisly exigencies of my trade to assess what lay
ahead, I had not until then realised myself that the choice in front of
the Labour Party was so limited, that it had to be, that it was going to
be, Tony.
On the day in question, Tony Blair -- who had earlier learned, in
1992, the folly of dithering over decisions by failing to declare for
the deputy leadership election after Neil Kinnock's resignation -- knew
what he was going to do.
Unexpected though John Smith's death may have been, Blair had learned
his lesson and did not hestitate for a moment.
An unnamed member of the Labour front bench, quoted in John Rentoul's
authoritative account, describes how: ''And what he said was he had lots
of other things in his life, he didn't actually need to do it for
himself, but that he was going to do it. It was like the tiger jumped
out of the pussy cat's skin. And he's been like that ever since.''
Even Smith, with all his sense and sensibility, cannot have had the
remotest idea of what might happen to the Labour Party when that big cat
emerged. It was not, of course, the sort of thing any sane man would
contemplate.
But it can fairly be said that probably Blair did not imagine what lay
ahead either.
Some politicians, perhaps most of them, have programmes for
themselves, or their parties, or their political cadres. They plot and
scheme and plan to achieve first the means and secondly, sometimes, but
not always, the end. Sometimes the power itself is sufficient.
We can see from this book that while Blair did have a distinct idea of
what he was doing and why, the accident of history that brought him to
the leadership of the Labour Party was as much a surprise to him as to
the rest of the political world. Since then, though, there has been a
great deal of strategic planning.
His propulsion into power was another piece of the luck that he has
had, this young man who won his seat in the House of Commons only in
1983, and then, having been selected for his safe Labour seat only at
the last minute in wildly improbable circumstances.
Roy Hattersley is quoted as recalling how he had been woken at
midnight by a wild hammering on his hotel room door by a colleague to
tell him of the selection at Sedgefield of this young man who, at that
moment, he couldn't even remember. ''If there was a moment when history
should have noticed him, it was then,'' Hattersley said.
Rentoul's excellent book is full of this sort of interesting
reportage. There are first-hand accounts, second-hand analyses (which is
preferable because the author does not impose his own views, judgment,
or assessment on the reader at any time) and lots of lovely details.
It is a very good book about one so young, who has done so little. It
is factual without being remotely tedious. It is informative without
repeating old stories -- a significant point in a biography about a man
who has been in public life for only just over 10 years and wasn't even
a member of the Labour Party last time Labour won a General Election --
and it is also revelatory. It tells you just about as much as you could
hope to know about who Tony Blair is, where he has come from and what he
wants.
Rentoul manages to achieve the necessary distance. He scarcely ever
tells us what he thinks: there may be, for example, a slightly scathing
comparison of the meaningless rhetoric employed, in not dissimilar
national circumstances, by both Harold Wilson and Tony Blair, but
Rentoul does not presume to comment.
Here is the young Tony at Fettes College (''the wetties from Fettes''
as a friend from Edinburgh tells me they were known in her day): hating
it, rebelling, proving one of the most difficult boys ever, according to
one of his teachers.
And here he is at Oxford: the biographer tells us what he did, how he
spent his time, the influences upon him, his moral development, the
inevitable challenge of a career either in politics or the church
because of his desire to ''do something''.
He reveals the private nature of Blair's profound Christianity, having
been confirmed into the Church of England at the age of 20 when he was
doing all the things that most people of his age did at university, but
still obviously seeking something more spiritually fulfilling.
And he also provides us with satisfying small details like the fact
that Tony met Cherie Booth, his wife, because they were sitting together
as candidates seeking scholarships from the Inns of Court, seated there,
the two of them, in alphabetical order. Well, of course.
It is notoriously difficult to write a book such as this about an
emerging politician, It is made more complicated by the fact that every
day, every week, there is a new, unforeseen, wriggle in the way the
Labour Party plays the new cards it has now been dealt.
Tony Blair may have another new idea for New Labour; Old Labour may
resurrect a few old ideas it wants to remind him about. It is a
confusing and dangerous terrain, and one which is almost always
uncertain for a biographer. John Rentoul has traversed it brilliantly
and without error.

THE response from the SNP to what I said in the private memo to my
colleague last week on the darker side of nationalism is deeply
revealing. Confronted with the provocative words that have been used,
instead of the SNP leadership repudiating or denouncing them, they
merely resorted to their traditional bluster and vitriol.
Only George Reid, an ex-SNP MP, heeded the advice in your editorial on
Thursday when you agreed that I had a good point ''on the need for
senior SNP officials to choose their words carefully, and to avoid
emotive descriptions of opponents''.
For the record I did not, and do not, suggest a direct connection
between the SNP leadership and the recent upsurge in extreme nationalist
violence, including the death threat this weekend. It is convenient for
some to say that this is what I said but it is simply not true. Of
course Alex Salmond and his parliamentary colleagues do not set out to
incite the lunatic nationalist fringe and would be made to do so.
What I did point out, and not for the first time, is that the use of
heavily loaded and emotive language by respectable democratic
politicians in the SNP will, whether they like it or not, fuel the
fevered fires of those who want separation by any means.
To suggest, as one SNP MP has done, that those of us who resent the
word ''traitor'' or ''Uncle Tom'' are simply ''over-sensitive'' in is
breathtaking given the potency of thse words. If anyone senior in my
party was to describe SNP leaders in the cesspit vocabulary of American
racism, they would be, and will be, denounced on the spot.
Yet Jim Sillars, when an SNP MP, did use the phrase ''Uncle Tom''
unapologetically about Donald Dewar and in the last few weeks a
prominent member of the SNP executive used both ''traitor'' and ''Uncle
Tom'' about his opponents in The Herald, repeated them in the Scotsman
last week and issued them once again to the press on Friday in Perth.
From the SNP Leader, not a word of reprimand.
Another delegate at the Perth conference rostrum spoke of ''white
settlers'' on an area tourist board. Not a word of public rebuke.
Last year an SNP vice-president on TV condoned the use of the word
''Quisling'' -- the name of a Nazi traitor -- as a legitimate
description of elected Labour MPs. No repudiation followed this
poisonous expression.
The SNP Leader himself earlier this year emotively described the Scots
as being like ''political prisoners'' and in an SNP leaflet on Cold
Climate Allowances defied both both climate and geography with the
unsubtle title ''Southern Comfort''.
I am no shrinking political violet. I can mix with anyone on the
political ideas we debate in our democracy. But there is a fundamental
dividing line between the robust vocabulary of debate and the evil
language of hate and prejudice. ''Traitor'', ''Uncle Tom'', and
''Quisling'' are among the words which should be shunned completely by
respectable politicians in this and any land.
So I now offer this direct challenge. Does Alex Salmond approve of the
use of these words and sentiments about elected representatives of the
Scottish people? Will he now make it clear that if they are personally
acceptable, then their use in hs party's upper reaches will be outlawed
by him?
I say this with only sadness; if he continues to condone such language
with his silence then he cannot be surprised if the extremist fringe do
no consider that toleration very significant. So will the electorate.

Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland,

THE SNP conference at Perth was proof, if proof were needed, that
nationalism is a thoroughly unpleasant and dangerous development in
Scottish life. It is dangerous not because the SNP is ever likely to
gain power -- Mrs Ewing's realism makes the point -- but rather because
of what the idea of nationalism is doing to how we view current affairs
and relationships with other peoples.
Alex Salmond told his conference that ''there will be no cricket tests
in a free Scotland''. I am sure he sincerely believes that but it is
patently untrue.
The first requirement of nationalism is a definition of who qualifies
to be a citizen. It inevitably means that some are excluded. It is in
defining those who are to be excluded that causes nationalism to reveal
its ugly side. This century is littered with the tragedies wrought by
that alone.
It is Mr Salmond's awareness of nationalism's primary deficiency that
led him to assert so strongly that there will be no cricket tests in
Scotland.
The thought that the SNP would define what a Scot is and rule on that
basis worries me as it should worry everyone concerned for the
preservation and development of our liberal democracy here in Scotland
and elsewhere in the United Kingdom.

Munich
THOUSANDS of Germans protested at the weekend against a ban on
mandatory crucifixes in Bavarian schools at a Munich rally that critics
said went too far in drawing parallels to Nazi-era repression.
The 30,000-strong demonstration yesterday under the motto ''The cross
stays -- yesterday, today and tomorrow'' was the biggest protest yet
against a controversial supreme court ruling that has shaken this deeply
Roman Catholic state.
The German Judges Association today criticised conservative
politicians for whipping up protests that could undermine the
once-sacrosanct Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe.
The court ruled last month that Bavaria could not insist crucifixes
hang in state classrooms because that violated religious freedoms
enshrined in the constitution.
The conservative government of state premier Edmund Stoiber,
presenting itself as a staunch defender of the faith and Bavarian
traditions, has refused to yield and remove them.
He and Finance Minister Theo Waigel, head of the ruling Christian
Social Union (CSU) in Bavaria, were among prominent political and church
leaders who gathered at the Munich rally beside a 15ft crucifix.
Munich's Catholic archbishop, Cardinal Friedrich Wetter, recalled to
the crowd how the Nazis tried to ban the cross from schools during the
Third Reich.
''Thank God our children are studying under the cross and not under a
swastika,'' he said to cheers from the crowd.
The protesters also applauded Florian Harlander, 67, who told how he
and his friends had defied the Nazis in 1941 and replaced Hitler's
picture in their classroom with a crucifix.
The Express newspaper in Cologne, another mostly Catholic area of
Germany, today denounced the Nazi parallels and mass criticism of a
supreme court decision.
''It is devastating to see a man at the demo call the Karlsruhe
decision comparable to the verdicts spoken by the ruthless judges of the
Nazi regime,'' it wrote in an editorial.
''Even Catholics who are very upset must still at least respect the
decision of Germany's highest court.''

THE SNP leadership sandbagged the party membership into accepting
''Independence in Europe'' in 1988 and for seven years the party has not
been permitted to debate it.
Alex Neil, the SNP's vice-convener for policy, claimed during the
conference debate on Wednesday that it had taken him four months to put
the resolution together and, as it was mauled by delegates and remitted
for further consideration, he made the plea that ''they had been
overtaken by events'' as things had changed during the period of
preparation.
Thus, after seven years of sophistry, evasion, and attempting to
redefine the political dictionary, the SNP's flagship policy was reduced
to no more than political drivel.
It has never been anything else, it is just that at this year's
conference delegates had it spelled out for them in a resolution that
was child-like in its composition, contradicting itself in every
paragraph.
Having spent the last five years indulging in the ''politics of
soundbite'' at the expense of principle, the SNP leadership will always
be in danger of being overtaken by events every four months or so. In
reality, as far as the development of the EU is concerned, nothing has
changed since the signing of the Single European Act and the principles
propounded by the founding fathers have not changed since the Treaty of
Rome.
The fact that some delegates saw a single currency as going too far
may be an indication that some of the SNP are beginning to rediscover
principle but the party's new slogan of ''Brave Hearts and Wise Heads''
rings rather hollow in the light of Wednesday's debate when neither were
in evidence.
Unionists need have no fear of the feelings of patriotism that
Braveheart may arouse in the Scottish electorate; the SNP is doing its
best to neutralise it.

Wellington
FOUR scientists photographing volcanic activity on Mount Ruapehu were
injured today along with the pilot when their light plane was forced to
make a crashlanding.
Around 300 skiers had been evacuated from the mountain yesterday after
the volcano erupted, sending ash, rocks and steam thousands of feet into
the air.
The eruption sent three volcanic mudflows from the mountain's crater,
one of which covered a mountainside hut.
National Parks spokesman Constable Ross Gilbert said that the
scientists' plane crashed about 200 yards short of an airstrip as it was
attempting to land at the base of the mountain. The plane apparently had
suffered from engine problems.
All five people on board were airlifted to Waikato Hospital in
Hamilton, but only two were detained -- both with spinal injuries. The
three other men were treated for facial cuts and discharged.
Mount Ruapehu, which is midway between Auckland and the capital
Wellington, is the highest volcanic cone on the North Island, at a
height of 9000ft.
It is one of three active volcanoes in the Taupo volcanic zone. All
three have erupted this century with Ruapehu erupting hot mud and ash in
1969 and 1975 and again in 1988.
Yesterday's eruption was visible from the town of Turangi, about 25
miles away.
Scientists studying the mountain have warned that further volcanic
activity is likely and people should avoid the crater lake and plateau
area.
Meanwhile, an earthquake measuring 4.3 on the Richter scale was felt
near Wellington today but there were no reports of damage.
Terry Webb, a spokesman for the Institute of Geological and Nuclear
Sciences, said the earthquake was shallow and centred 20 miles from
Wellington.
New Zealand is situated in an earthquake zone and frequently
experiences small earthquakes.
* An earthquake measuring 6.2 on the Richter scale shook the Peruvian
capital Lima yesterday for close to 30 seconds, but no injuries were
immediately reported.
The epicentre of the quake was 130 miles northwest of Lima.
Radioprogramas del Peru radio said the tremor was felt in towns along
the coast north and south of the capital.--AP/Reuter.

WHAT a farce! After years hiding behind a slogan the SNP finally
decided to allow its members to open the black box called Europe and
discuss its contents at the conference. Before everyone's eyes the whole
pretence at having a policy behind their Independence in Europe slogan
disintegrated.
''Allan Macartney and I have spent the last year working on this
document,'' bawled Alex Neil as he proposed it. An hour later they were
humiliated by having to remit it.
Nicola Sturgeon, an executive member, said it all: ''Europe is our
flagship policy. It is far too important to be dealt with by a mishmash
of statements which leave us facing different directions at once''.
The SNP has never had a policy. It had a slogan. The debate was
supposed to remedy that. Instead it exposed the reason why the SNP has
studiously avoided any cogent analysis of the position of a separatist
movement within the European Union.
There is no independence in the European Union. The problem boils down
to this for the nationalists. For years they have been fighting to break
away from a union that gives Scotland 11% of the votes in the House of
Commons. What difference will a Union that would give it only 3% of the
votes in the Council of Ministers make?
Because their creed is tribal and territorial they shun and are
shunned by the larger political movements which extend from Scotland
throughout Europe and by far provide the real political dynamics in the
Union.
The only sound that could be heard over Alex Neil's tub-thumping was
the unmistakable clink of the penny dropping. All of the criticisms
separatists make of the British Union must surely to some degree apply
to the European Union. Hence the mishmash. The more its civic leadership
embraces unionism in Europe the more its ethnic supporters will rail.
This one will not go back into its black box.

Anchorage
SEARCHERS have found the ''black box'' cockpit voice recorder they
hope will provide clues to what caused a US Air Force radar plane to
crash, killing 24 people, officials said today.
Major Jerry Brown, a spokesman for Elmendorf Air Force base near
Anchorage, Alaska, said the black box was found last night in the
wreckage of the Awacs (Airborne Warning and Control System) plane, which
crashed in a fireball on Friday minutes after taking off from the base.
The information on the black box will be analysed by experts
investigating the crash, the first involving an Awacs plane since the
high-tech radar reconnaissance and surveillance aircraft entered service
with the Air Force in 1977.
News reports said the crash may have been caused by a flock of Canada
geese being sucked into one of the plane's engines, causing it to stall.
They said dead geese were found at the departure end of the runway.
One witness said he saw flames spurting from the plane's left engine
as it took off.
The plane, carrying 125,000lb of jet fuel, exploded, hurling debris
over several acres and sending up a thick plume of black smoke that
could be seen up to 30 miles away.
Brown said all the bodies had been removed from the crash site
yesterday. A team of pathologists will work to identify the victims.
The air base yesterday released the names of the 24 military personnel
-- 22 Americans and two Canadians -- who died.--Reuter.

WHY the outrage, outcry, and outpourings about the ex-chief executive
of the NHS, Duncan Nicholl, commenting that in future there would
probably be an introduction of patient charges for NHS medical
treatment?
Currently, non-exempt dental patients pay 80% of costs, up to #300,
for NHS dental treatment.
This, for a parimary health-care service, which was supposed to be
''comprehensive, and free at the point of elivery for all''.

When governments since 1948, the inception of the NHS, haven't made
good use of the compulsory insurance money paid each week by employers
and employees by not having enough in the kitty to provide care for all
right into the grave, how can anyone believe private insurers can do so?
Has anyone yet taken this Government to court for failing to provide
care?
I trust the young have no trust in anything this Government says. It
is only in power to sell everything off.
It would seem Tory MPs do not have parents who would have to sell the
family home to pay for care. Taxpayers certainly pay enough for all
care.

Stanger, South Africa
SOUTH African Zulus turned up in smaller numbers than expected to
celebrate the most important date on their calendar, underlining a split
between their King Goodwill Zwelthini and political leader Chief
Mangosuthu Buthelezi.
Organisers had expected 30,000 people to descend on the memorial site
of warrior King Shaka, who founded the country's biggest ethnic group.
But witnesses said only several thousand people -- many wearing
leopard skins and carrying sticks, spears and shield -- gathered to hear
Buthelezi say the survival of South Africa's nine million Zulus was
under threat.
Police estimated the crowd at only several hundred.
King Zwelithini, complaining that Shaka Day had been politicised, had
ordered that commemorations be cancelled.
But Buthelezi, leader of the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party, and
KwaZulu-Natal province premier Frank Mdlalose defied the king and
addressed the rally.
The king broke off relations with Buthelezi last year after Inkatha
supporters stormed his royal residence to protest against a visit by
President Nelson Mandela and the monarch's intention to invite Mandela
to last year's Shaka Day.
Townships around the port city of Durban and Stanger were quiet. The
settlements had been wracked by political fighting among Zulus divided
in loyalty between Mandela's African National Congress and Buthelezi's
Inkatha.--Reuter.

Athens
INTERNATIONAL church leaders, ecologists and government officials
gathered on the Greek island of the Apocalypse today to mark the 1900
years since St John received his vision of the cataclysmic end of the
world.
The celebration on Patmos, where St John lived in exile in 95 AD and
had his revelation, was overseen by Christian Orthodox Ecumenical
Patriarch Bartholomew.
Such star-billed guests as Mrs Hillary Clinton failed to show at the
remote island, but the United States, other countries, world
organisations and churches sent representatives.
Among those attending were officials from the Vatican, the Church of
England, most of the 15 patriarchs of the Christian Orthodox Church and
even a mufti from Greece's Muslim minority.
St John's symbol-filled revelation is the final book in the Bible's
New Testament. With dramatic visions of catastrophe and war -- and the
four horsemen of the Apocalypse -- it has fired the imagination of
theologians and artists for centuries.
Bartholomew linked St John's vision of the world's end to modern
ecological disasters and the development of nuclear arms of mass
destruction.--Reuter.

AMID all the fuss and cheap jibes about Bearsden Academy, one fact
seems to have been overlooked. That a 32-year-old, for whatever motives,
should apparently be quite happy to spend a year there and emerge with
five ''A'' passes at Higher says quite a lot about the ethos and
atmosphere prevailing in the school.
I can think of quite a few schools where the deception would have been
hastily abandoned after the distressing experience of the first day.

Nairobi
KENYA'S most prominent dissident will learn tomorrow if he is to go to
the gallows on charges of raiding a police station -- an incident he
says was faked.
Defence lawyers say Koigi wa Wamwere and three other defendants are
innocent and he is being victimised for his opposition to the government
of President Daniel arap Moi.
The human rights group Amnesty International backs the claim.
Nakuru Chief Magistrate William Tuiyot is due to read out the verdict
tomorrow in a rundown courtroom in Rift Valley province.
Under Kenyan law, if the so-called Koigi Four are found guilty of
raiding the police station, they must be sentenced to hang.
''Tomorrow's outcome will be closely followed not only by Kenyans but
the world at large. It could be a turning point in the country's
politics,'' an African diplomat said.
Wamwere himself will not be in the dock. In July, Tuiyot ordered him
removed from the court after he accused the magistrate of being ''the
prosecutor, the court and the hangman'' in the controversial case.
Prosecutors say they have proved beyond doubt that Wamwere, his
brother Charles, brother-in-law James Maigua and former soldier George
Ngengi tried to steal guns from a police station in Nakuru, 100 miles
northwest of Nairobi, in 1993.
They demand the mandatory death sentence.
They also accuse Wamwere, a former member of parliament, of possession
of unlicensed firearms, an offence which carries a maximum
14-year-sentence.
The defence says the police station raid was faked.
The defendants are all Kikuyus, Kenya's most populous and politically
active tribe.
Wamwere, whose former parliamentary constituency once covered Moi's
home area, Kabarak, was detained for the alleged offences in November
1993. Shortly before this, the government dropped treason charges
against him which also carry the death penalty.
After his 1990 arrest on the treason charges, Norway protested and
diplomatic relations between Nairobi and Oslo were severed. The two
countries have since resumed low-level contacts.
Wamwere's wife and children reside in Oslo, where he lived in exile
from 1986 to 1990, leading a small leftist group that aimed to force
Kenya to resume pluralist politics.
Moi's government has come under growing criticism from foreign
governments and human rights groups for repressing its opponents but the
president dismisses such allegations.
Western embassies plan to send senior diplomats to the courtroom,
which is also likely to be packed with opposition supporters.
Wamwere's ageing mother plans to attend the court. The body of his
father, who died several months ago, is lying at a nearby mortuary.
The family says he will be buried when Wamwere is freed or hanged
because under Kikuyu tribal custom he must attend his father's
burial.--Reuter.

BARCLAY McBain reported that the Accounts Commission for Scotland had
identified 13 secondary schools and 106 primaries which could be readily
closed (September 21).
Wisely, the commission declined to identify the schools by name.
Unfortunately, your correspondent did not show a similar restraint and
identified Mainholm Academy in Ayr as one of the schools likely to be on
the commission's list.
This guess was based on a rationalisation paper produced by
Strathclyde in 1992. The situation, however, has altered significantly
since then and I am pleased to say that Mainholm Academy, far from being
at death's door, is alive and well and thriving.
The regional council has made increasing use of the surplus capacity
in the building to accommodate a range of units and educational projects
serving the North Ayr area and beyond. At the last count these included:
Good Shepherd Primary School, Craigpark School, Childwatch, the
Community Creche, the Bilingual Support Service, the Learning Support
Network, North Ayr Joint Initiative, and the Department of Architecture
offices, with a number of other developments in the pipeline.
Mainholm is much more than a secondary school. It is a community
school offering a wide range of services. The Mainholm campus has,
indeed, become so busy that along with my colleagues in the other
schools and units we have set up an informal ''tenants' association'' to
improve communication and cooperation.
I have every confidence that the new South Ayrshire Council will have
a similar broad vision of what a school can be and that we will continue
to develop as a vital resource at the centre of the community we serve.
As I am sure your education correspondent is aware, bare statistics
can disguise a very different reality. With a 20% increase in our
first-year intake this session, we can say, like Mark Twain, ''Reports
of our death have been greatly exaggerated''.

Sarajevo
BOSNIA said today it would boycott this week's New York peace talks
because Bosnian Serbs wanted to partition the country.
''There won't be any meeting,'' Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic
said in a television interview. The decision was because Bosnian Serbs
insisted on the right to secede, he said.
Bosnian state radio said separately that Foreign Minister Muhamed
Sacirbey was ordered not to attend Tuesday's talks because of
disagreement with the Serbs on constitutional issues.
The meeting should have brought the foreign ministers of Bosnia,
Croatia and rump Yugoslavia -- representing the Serbs -- together with
United States and European Union mediators to work on a peace plan to
end Bosnia's 41-month-old war.
It was supposed to build on ''basic principles'' agreed by the
Muslims, Croats and Serbs in Geneva two weeks ago.
The deal envisaged a 51-49% share-out of territory between a
Muslim-Croat federation and Bosnian Serbs, but Bosnia would remain a
sovereign state in its recognised borders. The constitutional blueprint
had still to be hammered out.
Deputies of US envoy Richard Holbrooke, who has led the peace effort,
discussed details at the weekend with Serbia's President Slobodan
Milosevic, who has represented the Bosnian Serbs. They evidently failed
to get what Sarajevo wanted.
''We are not satisfied with the process of talks in Belgrade between
Mr Holbrooke and Mr Milosevic,'' Silajdzic said.
''The regime in Belgrade has rejected the requirements and request
made by Mr Holbrooke that concerns the vital interests of
Bosnia-Herzegovina as a sovereign state within federal borders.
''We have made some requirements which were not met, like for example
that secession cannot happen. There's a so-called no-secession
paragraph. We want it explicitly to say that no part of
Bosnia-Herzegovina will be able to secede,'' he said.
''You may ask why it is so important? It is important because that's
what it is all about. The Serb terrorists and the regime in Belgrade
wanted actually to partition Bosnia, to make a Greater Serbia at the
expense of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
''Partition is our main concern and main problem. That's why we wanted
that to be said explicitly,'' Silajdzic said.
The boycott was announced on state radio in a statement from Bosnian
President Alija Izetbegovic's office.
It said the decision was taken ''in view of the fact the Serb side has
failed to respond positively to our constructive proposals for further
work on the details of the principles contained in the Geneva
document''.
It said Sacirbey had already informed Holbrooke of the decision.
Bosnian and American government sources said Belgrade talks with
Milosevic did not go well and that the US team was returning to
Washington.
Bosnian Serbs who fought the war to achieve a centuries-old dream of a
''Greater Serbia'' are eager to preserve that right for their entity,
the breakaway state ''Republika Srpska''.
Silajdzic said there was no room for a compromise by his government on
constitutional issues such as secession.
''If the state is not stable, viable, a source of stability not
instability, there won't be any talks.''
Should Tuesday's meeting not take place, it would be the first
significant stumble in Holbrooke's peace efforts, which began in August.
The upset occurred just days after separatist Serb forces pulled their
heavy weapons back from Sarajevo and in the wake of big Bosnian
government gains on the battlefield.
Meanwhile, Bosnian government and separatist Serb forces launched
artillery and infantry assaults today.
Official media on both sides said the other made pre-dawn attacks
around Brcko in northern Bosnia on the key corridor linking the
embattled Bosnian Serb stronghold of Banja Luka with the mass of
Serb-held territory in the east.
In Banja Luka, Serb military authorities reported Muslim attacks on
Gradacac, west of Brcko, and Croatian artillery attacks on the town of
Bosanski Novi over the weekend.
The Bosnian Serb army also reported fierce fighting near Sanski Most,
south of Banja Luka, with many people killed. Serbian paramilitary
leader Zeljko Raznjatovic ''Arkan'' was reported to have joined the
battle around Sanski Most.
The fresh fighting, which could not immediately be confirmed by UN
officers, followed Bosnian government vows to keep up the pressure on
Banja Luka after an offensive this month which reclaimed a vast swathe
of western Bosnia.
Bosnian premier Haris Silajdzic promised no let-up in the attack.
He said Bosnian government troops would pursue their advance on Banja
Luka in northwest Bosnia until the Serbs demilitarised the town and
stopped the ''genocide'' against the Bosnian Muslims.--Reuter.

BOSNIAN Premier Haris Silajdzic said at the weekend that 540 bodies of
Muslims and Croats had been found in a mass grave near the north-western
town of Kljuc and accused the Serbs of genocide.
Independent confirmation of exactly what lies in a shallow grave in
muddy woodland near the village of Krasulje will have to await detailed
examination, perhaps by the UN criminal tribunal for former Yugoslavia
based in The Hague.
Bosnian soldiers have certainly dug up some human remains before
television cameras and say traces of acid used to dissolve the bodies
have also been found.
The Bosnians say they were directed to the site by local people who
survived the three-year rule of the Serbs' ''Republika Srpska'', but the
details they give vary considerably.
While Silajdzic, speaking in the Croatian capital Zagreb, said there
were 540 bodies from Kljuc six miles away, the soldiers talked of
100-150 people from nearby villages.
The Sarajevo daily Oslobodjene put the total at 300 at one site and
said another five mass graves had been found in the district.
The Serbs have yet to comment officially on the case.

JIMMY Reid's Politics and principles article seemed to be based on a
rather pessimistic view of the country's future (September 21).
Somewhat surprisingly he harked back to the great days of political
leaders like Churchill and Macmillan. He gave them credit for being
political giants as compared with John Major and Tony Blair; no mention
was made of the faults and failures of the former Prime Ministers, of
which there were plenty.
The present Prime Minister -- a little unfairly, I thought -- was
described as an intellectual pygmy while the Leader of the Opposition
was dismissed as a careerist with a partiality for soundbites.
What was missing from the article was a clear exposition of how
today's economic and other problems should be tackled and what kind of
political philosophy and system of government might help to solve them.
It would be unkind to remind Jimmy Reid of what used to be his belief
that one particular political and social system could supply all the
answers but I must say, with due respect, that he is being unduly glum
-- perhaps in his old age -- if he concludes that the Labour Party, led
by Tony Blair, does not represent the country's best hope for the
future.

I READ with interest Nicola Reeves's article, City bids for conference

Commerce, is correct in his belief that Glasgow is an ideal conference
location.
Your readers may be interested to know that Junior Chamber
International, of which Glasgow Junior Chamber of Commerce is an
important member, is bringing a large international conference to
Glasgow in November.
This means that more than 4000 young (under 40) business and
professional persons from many countries will be resident in and around
Glasgow for about seven days. Such an event should give a valuable
economic and publicity boost to our city.
To promote Glasgow as a venue for this large and important conference,
visits were made worldwide by Scottish Junior Chamber members to
countries as far apart as Japan and Paraguay.
The location of Glasgow as a venue was finally agreed in face of
strong competition from Frankfurt.

IAN Mackay was one of the great legends of journalism, a large and
glorious character from Wick who stormed Fleet Street in the 1920s and
became perhaps the finest columnist of his generation.
His writings for the old News Chronicle were classics of their kind,
essays which can still be read with the joy that is given by a master
wordsmith who is also blessed with an impish sense of humour.
It was a regret that I never met Mackay but I can still recall the
delight of many years ago when I found myself, at a big football match
in London, in the next seat to his equally outrageous brother Hugh, a
top executive with the advertising agency of J Walter Thompson.
Hugh took this total stranger out on the town that night and raised
delight, over many a dram, with tales of his beloved brother.
Sketches of the big man suggest a kind of Brendan Behan character and
it is rather sad to think that his name hardly raises a flicker of
recognition today. For that matter, how many people even remember the
News Chronicle, a very fine journal indeed?
Stirred by memories of Ian Mackay, I have been re-acquainting myself
with his work, which was not only a pleasure in itself but the kind of
reassurance which comes from discovering that your own characteristics,
your foibles, are shared by others.
Coming from a background of rural remoteness, where nothing much ever
happened, I struck the big wide world with stars in my eyes and have
never quite lost that fascination with the famous.
I remember being intrigued, at a party in New York, to find myself in
conversation with three of the most powerful men in the world -- media
mogul Rupert Murdoch, influential financier James Goldsmith, and
international diplomat Henry Kissinger. (We were then joined by Steve
Forbes, who has just announced that he will seek the American Presidency
next year!)
Putting it all down to a certain boyish naivety, I was therefore
relieved to find that the great Mackay had gone south from Wick in much
the same condition. Approaching 50 and already a famous man himself, he
wrote: ''In my job you would think I would have worked all that nonsense
out of my system years ago.''
But he hadn't. Though he could pass up on Prime Ministers, he couldn't
resist a famous clown, artist, film star, murderer, centre-forward, or
fast bowler.
Having loved cricket from his earliest days in Wick, he would have
paid double for a bedroom in Nottingham when he found it was last
occupied by the great Don Bradman of Australia.
There was a morning in 1940, when he signed in at the Hotel Raphael in
Paris (just before Rundstedt took it over) and found the chambermaid
fondly patting pillows that only two hours earlier had been pressed by
the lovely head of one of his heroines, singer Lily Pons.
But his unexpected brushes with the famous became even closer. In
London's Whitehall Place one day he hailed a taxi and found that the man
stepping out as he stepped in was no less than George Bernard Shaw.
There was an even more magical occasion at Paganis in Great Portland
Street when he was led to a table just vacated by Puccini and his
fellow-Italian composer Busoni. To Mackay's delight, among the
wine-stains and breadcrumbs, they had left musical scribblings on the
tablecloth. (He doesn't say if he kept the tablecloth.)
Among his other encounters, he used to run into G K Chesterton in a
dairy tea shop in the Charing Cross Road and once found himself sitting
on the top deck of a Chelsea bus -- next to Hilaire Belloc!
Turning up in the press gallery of the Commons one day, he found his
normal seat occupied by Charlie Chaplin, listening to an important
speech by Prime Minister Baldwin.
But Mackay conceded that the best story of that nature had been given
to him by a memorable old London cabbie called Collinson, who drove his
cab through the London blitz till he was nearly 90. One night in 1881 he
picked up Lefroy, the Brighton train murderer, just after he had done
the deed, and drove him to Ludgate Circus.
As Lefroy stepped out, an old man like an eagle got in and called:
''House of Commons.'' It was Gladstone.
Mackay himself was one of those dishevelled, magnetic characters who
attract the unusual. As one observer said, everything in his life, that
would be humdrum in ours, was touched with richness and strangeness.
Leaving school at 14, he worked in a chemist's shop in Wick but was
off to the First World War in 1915, when he was only 17. He became
prominent as the News Chronicle's industrial correspondent in 1934 and
even more so as its diarist and columnist.
At the Labour Party conference, it was Ian Mackay's regular task to
reply to the vote of thanks to the press and at Morecambe, in 1952, he
had once more raised the roof with laughter. He was never in better
form. Yet he had no sooner done so than he was dead, still only 54 years
of age.
Few newspapermen have ever been mourned so deeply, which was a fair
measure of the brightness and warmth he could generate in other people's
lives.

MR Tony Blair must be displeased with the Liberal Democrats this
morning, though in a sense, having attempted to hijack the beginning of
their conference in Glasgow, he has got his just rewards. Mr Ashdown's
most serious crime last week (in Mr Blair's eyes) was not to raise the
subject of tax, or to castigate the fraudulent nature of Tory tax
policies, nor even to promise, quite reasonably, to raise tax to pay for
education. Mr Ashdown's fundamental and unforgivable mistake was to
taunt Labour into joining him in voting down any tax cuts in the
November Budget. Against his every instinct, Mr Blair was forced out of
his tax shell and into the public glare where he has had to reject Mr
Ashdown's unwelcome invitation. The reasons are simple and have
everything to do with political advantage, and very little to do with
serious tax policies. Mr Blair knows only too well that the Tories are
desperate to tempt him into the tax debate, preferably on the side of
those who don't want to give tax cuts to the voters.
All of this is bogus, of course. Tory tax policies have increased the
taxes on ordinary families to a marked extent over the past two decades;
it does not matter whether they are direct or indirect, the result is
the same. Yet perception, and crude perception, is all. If the Tories
manage a tax cut-or-two in November, then Labour will have either to
support them or oppose them. The message is clear enough without Mr
Ashdown rubbing it in. The subtext of this winter drama lies in the fact
that Labour's policies on tax must be made more clear. That is the only
way to counter the expected Tory propaganda assault over tax, but it is
a message which Labour strategists seem reluctant to embrace. Mr Blair,
in the aftermath of the Ashdown challenge, has been forced into the
position of revealing some of his thoughts. This is not the way to
unveil policy and unless the Labour Party becomes a good deal more
streetwise it will continue to be embarrassed, even by cumbersome
ambushes of the sort in which Mr Ashdown specialises.
What can we understand of Mr Blair's latest public thoughts on tax? In
a direct answer to those who accuse him of neglecting social policy, he
couples his hints of tax reductions under Labour with a promise that
this will happen only if strong public services can be maintained. If
the figures look incompatible, he has an answer. The shortfall in
revenue could be made up by a windfall tax on the newly privatised
utilities. This is now Labour policy and will be in the election
manifesto. It will, of course, be a one-off yield but it is capable of
raising many billions of pounds given the financial fat which lards
these facilities.
This policy is nothing other than commonsense. The utilities were sold
at ridiculously low prices; any windfall tax would simply constitute the
public purse recovering money it had earlier lost through the bungling
of the privatisation process by the Government. Mr Blair, then, has a
pot of gold, if a transitory one. It would be ironic if the Tories beat
him to it by imposing a levy on the unpopular utilities, but that is not
the point. The real danger is that any Government might be tempted by
windfall provision to reduce tax drastically. This would be
short-sighted and dangerous. If tax cuts are made possible through
windfall, they must be implemented cautiously and with an eye to
long-term sustainability. Anything else would be irresponsible.

THE plight of Hong Kong's population is saddening and worrying. The
territorial reversion to China, now fewer than three years away, is not
expected by anyone to have benign consequences. Hong Kong itself has
never enjoyed democratic self-government (and it has always seemed very
late in the day for us to have begun to introduce it) but it has
benefited from a liberal regime and civil rights which exist nowhere
else in China. A Tiananmen Square is impossible to envisage in Hong Kong
while under British rule, but few would imagine it beyond the bounds of
possibility after the transfer of sovereignty. Certainly, among those of
its people who have worked with the British administration in various
capacities, there is little evidence of optimism about the territory's
future, something underlined by the latest elections which, and surely
predictably, voted for democratic forms and against the mainland Chinese
declared interest.
All of that will evoke plenty of sympathy here. There may also be an
underlying sympathy for Governor Patten's proposal that UK passports be
issued to about three million Hong Kong Chinese, but there will be
little support. The issue was fully debated both in Parliament (and even
more agonisingly in private) just after the Tiananmen Square massacre of
June 1989. The outcome was the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act of
the following year, which granted the right of abode here to 50,000
Chinese families thought to be at risk after 1997 because of the role
their heads had played during British rule.
The arguments for extending that provision to the three million were
considered, but eventually rejected. Governor Patten was a party to
these discussions, and has just changed his mind. It is too late -- and
the immediate unhappy reaction of Tory back benchers, and Labour
spokesmen, makes clear why: British public opinion would be hostile to
such a move. It might be argued that it should not be hostile, and that
natural justice favours the Patten proposal. The political reality is
different. The possibility of Parliament legislating to allow more than
three million Hong Kong Chinese the right to UK passports is so remote
as to be unthinkable. Governor Patten is aligning himself with people he
evidently admires and respects, but the hope he may be instilling in
them is false.
The argument that the right, having been conceded, would not be used
as the people involved would prefer to go elsewhere, or would take their
chance in Hong Kong to see if their fears were realised, is
unacceptable. It is simply cynical to give something on the assumption
that it will not be used. It might not be used by all those entitled to
do so, but very large numbers might use it; and their arrival here would
be resented. The numbers involved are too great, and the potential
strains on race relations are already evident, even though the Chinese
''image'' here is good, and with good reason.   Since this country has
accepted the inevitable return of all the Hong Kong territories, and not
just the leased ones, to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, we have tended to
handle our relations with the Chinese Government rather badly,
particularly so since the end of the Thatcher administration. The
belated onset of democracy has upset Beijing, but has done little to
protect the Hong Kong people from its coming wrath. The proposal to
siphon off many of the most vigorous and endowed citizens will be seen
as an outrage.

ANDREW POPPLE delves into a survival guide for parents written by a
father who has been through the minefield
YOU can tell a lot about a person's character, political leanings and,
perhaps, upbringing from the TV they admit to watching. For me:
Beechgrove Garden (Carole Baxter can pot on my antirrhinums any day),
Have I Got News For You, and Rory Bremner. And you try keeping me away
from I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue on Radio 4.
Recognising your tastes anywhere in there probably means there is a
good chance you will enjoy, like me, Michael Rosen's latest book Just
Kids for its humour and portrayal of a certain lifestyle. And that is
important, for this is not a childcare manual. It is rather a cameo of
middle-class, middle-England, middle-age life with kids.
The author is careful to say at the beginning that his is one side in
a discussion about bringing up children from a fairly individual
standpoint. He takes his topics in alphabetical order, starting with
Bedtime, then Bedwetting (''The last time I wet the bed was when I was
about 10, and very pleasurable it was too''), through Pocket Money
(''The Money Box is a fetish or household god sitting quietly in the
corner of your children's bedrooms waiting for its next offering'') and
Step-brothers and sisters (''This is a growth industry'') to Your Life
(''Am I here just to bring children into the world and service their
needs? Or is it in order to have a bloody good time as often as
possible?'').
The balance between humour, anecdote and advice is nicely done, with
some chapters taking something of a question-and-answer format. Others
set up ''typical'' situations, conversations or whatever and while I did
not relate as well to these, they stimulated thought and that is more
than half the battle for a book such as this.
Thus we have a wry, perceptive, anecdotal -- and immensely enjoyable
-- tour through parenthood up to pre-teenage years, from the perspective
of someone with step, half and ''full'' children; five in all. Although
few have to cope with that lot, many of us will draw inspiration from
situations he has endured. To know there is someone worse off than us is
a great comfort.
But nothing is perfect -- I am a pessimist -- and this book is no
exception. Not all of his anecdotes ring as true as I would like: it is
inconceivable to me that I would use the word ''wanker'' in conversation
with my 12-year-old son, but I have six years to modify that view.
Permeating the book is the history of the author's family. He is open
and forthcoming about his relationships with the children, but I cannot
help thinking that his portrayal of the discussions held with his first
wife over their separation, and their arrangements for the children, is
somewhat oversimplified, and overcivilised.
The chapter on Divorce and Separation contains many fine words and
sentiments but it is uncharacteristically impersonal, with no overt
references to his own experiences. I think that is a pity: not a few
middle-class marriages hit the rocks.
This is a book full of considered and firmly held beliefs carefully
but uncompromisingly put by a caring parent just trying his best. For
all the niggles, it is a book to enjoy, first in the smug knowledge you
will avoid the pitfalls which caught the author, and then later with the
smile slightly awry as it dawns on you that you, too, are in the thick
of it, making much the same mistakes as everyone else. Don't just read
it once and pass it to the Gala Day bookstall: keep it a while and let
it be your reassurance that wherever you tread, someone has put their
foot in it already.

Ann Coltart meets a group of fathers who are touring nurseries with
their children to sing the praises of dads and toddlers groups
POSTCARD displays still awash with James Dean and Marilyn Monroe icons
also offer a more recent, regular image. Strong, gleaming male bodies
are seen cradling soft, vulnerable babies. These images are stirring and
popular because they look natural while appearing culturally unfamiliar.
Young children attached to adult males were just not a common
combination for a long time. Today, men pushing buggies, carrying little
people in slings next to their hearts and holding hands with toddlers
along the street have become unremarkable.
Fathers may not be the remote creatures they once were when mothers
and children generally occupied an ''inside'' world and the men were
outside, at jobs and mainly relating to other men.
But the assumptions are still there that bringing up baby is mainly
mum's job, with dad perhaps helping out now and then.
There are several moves, however, to get dads more involved in
parenting, through subtle shifts in society and through very deliberate
initiatives.
Patrick Boase, of Parent Network Scotland, has been involved in
several initiatives to develop better communications and understandings
within families and to encourage dads and young children to spend more
time together, having fun and creating stronger links.
Patrick has helped set up dads and toddlers groups in Glasgow, with
varying success rates.
He admits it is not easy, that it has not been easy for him to work
out what fathering means.
''I had a distant, difficult relationship with my own father,'' he
said. ''I've had to learn how to express myself openly, to listen, to be
positive, to share, to deal with the assumptions men and women make
about each other and about children.''
He has learned a great deal, not least about himself, from sharing
with his partner the parenting of their young children Rowan and Struan.
''There's such a large area that we don't learn about,'' he said.
''Men nowadays often take part in antenatal preparation but sort of
disappear after the baby's born. We might have sex education in schools
but very little on relationships, parenting, or gender issues. Then
there are all those social restraints and barriers preventing men being
able to talk to other men.''
On the other side of Scotland, a group of dads in Greater Pilton
gradually got together last year with their pre-school children, through
a period of shyness and embarrassment. They broke down some of the old
barriers and created Dads &amp; Kids On Tour, singing and playing with their
children and then taking songs and music around Edinburgh schools and
nurseries under their own special banner.
Derek Sinclair, who designed the Dads &amp; Kids on Tour banner and
T-shirts, is a divorced single parent with three sons.
''I felt very apprehensive at first about getting together with other
men and their children,'' he said.
''Imagine how we felt, dads of all shapes and sizes singing 'I'm a
little teapot', with all the actions.''
But once they had worked through the initial stiffness, the children
helped keep the fathers loosened up.
''When you see your own kids' faces light up and then other kids at
nurseries loving it when we went on tour, it's worth it,'' said
Sinclair.
Although his youngest boy has started school, he would like to keep
this group going.
''We understand how other dads feel,'' he said. ''Since I got involved
the teachers know my face, I feel a closer bond with the kids and
they've really got more confident.''
Brian Robertson came from a family of nine children, but did not
become a father himself until he was 40. He has three daughters, aged
six months, two and five, and says he has plenty of time for his
children, as he's unemployed, though he agrees that his wife Brenda does
most of the work for the children.
''I like all the normal things like football and I understand the
macho attitude where men are too shy or think it's stupid to get
involved with the kids,'' he said. ''But I'm all for it now. My children
have learned so much and so have I.''
Robertson is now on Pirniehall Primary School board and is as bound up
in his children's development as mothers traditionally are.
''You always see mums in creches, but there's nothing much for dads
and kids,'' said Andy Fleming, a Muirhouse father of three who was
converted to the idea of father-child links through Dads &amp; Kids On Tour.
Although he is not a single parent, he has noticed an increasing
number of men who are, and think they need more support.
''I was sceptical about joining our group at first, until I saw what
the kids were getting out of it,'' he said.
''I hope it carries on, with more dads and more ideas, after Dorothy
has gone.''
Dorothy Caddell is the home-link teacher at Muirhouse Primary School,
acknowledged by the fathers as the one who got them going.
She has a new job as a lecturer at Lauder College in Dunfermline, but
hopes the current core of men, with the next home-link teacher, will
keep their project going.
''In the parents' room at school, there would always be mothers,''
said Caddell. ''There is high unemployment in this area and I noticed a
lot of men bringing children to school but never stepping over the
doorstep.''
In January 1994, during the post-Christmas depression when all the
bills pile up, Dorothy made numerous visits to homes in the
neighbourhood to ask fathers if they wanted to become more involved in
their children's education.
''Again, it is usually the mothers who deal with school and child
business,'' she said. ''But I spoke to fathers and tried to point out
that anything they decided was on their terms, not on those of the
school, and they didn't have to lose street cred going into a school
building.''
A stroke of luck helped her get some of the dissident dads together.
Rab Howat, a rock guitarist friend of hers, played in a male-oriented
pub visited by several young men from greater Pilton.
''I persuaded, or frogmarched, Rab into playing guitar for us to get
some singing going,'' she said. ''At first the dads hid behind the kids
on their knees, pretending to sing. They didn't know each other and felt
foolish. But eventually it started taking off and the group got
bigger.''
A video was made by a local mother and a high school pupil of the dads
and kids; musical visits to schools and nurseries started and they went
away together for a weekend to help their youngsters' literacy
development through games, songs, and stories.
Puppet-making workshops were started, fathers began going into schools
to read and discuss stories, they produced their own booklet on dads and
kids, now used by Lothian region, and the Open University asked the
group to test materials for parents and children under eight.
''Dads' faces are not so unfamiliar now in the parents' room and I
wish initiatives like ours were happening everywhere,'' said Caddell.
A conference in Stirling this month run by the National Childbirth
Trust and Parent Network, called Fathers Do It Too, looked at some of
the advantages, difficulties, ignorance and new strategies in the
growing debate about fatherhood and paternal learning and caring.
There is a growing number of initiatives and explorations for fathers
in Scotland. Parenthood doesn't come naturally to most of us, male or
female. But it should be more interesting (and no doubt a higher-status
occupation) if there are more dads doing the job too.

CROSSES and even a statue of Mary and Jesus dotted the crowd of about
30,000 believers who congregated on Saturday under a five-metre crucifix
to protest against a decision by Germany's high court that bans Bavaria
from requiring crosses in classrooms.
Handheld signs denounced what they see as an affront to their
religion, culture and tradition. Dirndls and lederhosen decorated the
demonstration as much as crosses did.
''The cross is a symbol of our beliefs,'' said Lucie Cyllok of Munich,
who attended with her daughter. ''If we lose this, we lose so much more
in our lives.''
Under the motto ''The Cross Stays -- Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow'',
the mostly Catholic crowd heard speeches from leaders of the Catholic
and Protestant churches, Bavarian Premier Edmund Stoiber, a student, a
father and a teacher.
Emotions were raw after the Bavarian Administrative Court, citing the
Constitutional Court ruling, this week ordered crosses removed from the
classrooms of the Seler children, whose family brought the suit against
Bavaria.
Stoiber promised the crowd that his government would quickly enact a
law to replace the one struck down.
''Whoever wants to ban Christian symbols from public life hits a raw
nerve in our culture,'' Stoiber said. ''Tolerance is not a one-way
street. It is not only required for the majority, but also must be
exercised by the minority,'' he added.
In a state where ''God's greeting'' is the customary welcome, the
protesters said they were startled that such a small minority could
impose their will on the majority. Some 90% of Bavarians are Catholic.
Many protesters and speakers recalled when Nazi dictators and East
German communists ordered the cross removed.
Florian Harlander, of Regensburg, remembered the time in 1941 he and
four friends bought a crucifix from their savings and hung it in place
of Hitler's portrait in his classroom.
A wave of protest throughout the region eventually forced the Nazis to
revoke the order to replace crosses with the Fuehrer's portrait.
''Thank God our children are learning under the sign of the cross and
not the swastika,'' Munich Archbishop Cardinal Freidrich Wetter said.
Fifty years later, the resistance remains. Despite the Constitutional
Court ruling last August, the crucifixes have hung defiantly in Bavarian
schoolrooms.
The apparent willingness to question a supreme court ruling has
surprised many Germans.
''Never before have we seen such a considerable protest as we are
seeing now,'' Klaus Stern, a law professor at Cologne University, said.
Stoiber's draft law would require crucifixes in classrooms but adds
rules that allow schools to make exceptions on an individual basis.
Schools must also take the will of the majority into consideration,
Stoiber said.
''We think this ruling is wrong,'' he told the crowd. ''But we are
respecting the decision of the Federal Constitutional Court by adding
these rules for objections.''
Some constitutional scholars believe this could lead Bavaria into
another collision with the nation's constitution.
Any law that makes a cross or a crucifx mandatory will violate the
constitution, Professor Stern said. But he added that the high court
made several sloppy errors in its verdict, making it likely it will have
to rule again.
Ernst Seler, who first brought his suit 10 years ago, said he would
not accept the proposed law as written.
''It's got nothing to do with majorities or minorities. It's an
individual right,'' said Seler, whose family has received hate mail and
death threats over the case.
The Selers, followers of Austrian philosopher Rudolf Steiner, said
their eldest daughter, now 16, was upset on her first day of school by
what she regarded as a ''dead body'' on a cross on her classroom wall.
For two years the girl's teachers agreed to replace the crucifix with
a simple cross. When another teacher refused to comply with the Selers's
request, the family filed suit.
''Crosses must go if parents want them to go,'' Selers said. ''Parents
should decide which symbols they want their children exposed to.''
But the protesters clearly want their children to be exposed to the
cross.
They ended their demonstration by singing the Bavarian Anthem ''God be
with you, land of Bavarians''. Then many of them moved on to support
another Bavarian tradition -- Oktoberfest.

SINGULAR THOUGHTS
BEING a single parent is solo, round-the-clock work. Seven days a
week, 52 weeks a year, with no time off for good behaviour. I sometimes
go for days without speaking to another adult. Given what a number of
these alleged adults have to say, this is no great hardship, but at
least they are adult.
There are limits to what may be discussed with a bright two-year-old.
And my daughter, Jessica, is as bright as a newly minted 50 pence piece.
Not that I see many of these either. But odd days drag, and it would be
interesting to hear the male slam of the front door and the tramp of
heavier feet coming down the hall.
I love my daughter, and the time we spend together is precious. It is
just that, occasionally, the pressure of close proximity makes us tense.
Into even the most well-ordered of lives droplets must fall, and I sense
Jessica would agree that we both benefit from a dose of the ''absence
makes the heart grow fonder'' syndrome.
As a 20-year-old single mum I do the best I can: in some regards,
perhaps better than a nuclear family mum. Jessica has my undivided
attention from dawn until dusk and during unspecified hours in between.
What I do, Jessica does. What I read, Jessica reads -- or at least tries
to. What I enjoy, Jessica enjoys as well.
However, from time to time ''self'' creeps in, and I hanker for the
happiness of freedom from the unremitting toil of constant
responsibility: to recapture the wild spirit of my earlier youth, if
even only for a brief moment. Well, to be completely honest, parts of my
earlier youth. Other bits are best buried.
Which is why I escape to Tongue, where my parents live in a cottage
overlooking the golden sands of Kyle of Tongue and Ben Loyal, ''Queen of
Scottish Mountains'', and, more important, my local pub, the Brass Tap.
The people I know are Highland people and they always make me feel
welcome. And it is a good feeling.
The idea is that my parents do a lot of granddaughter-bonding while I
do the things a girl likes to do. They don't know this, or pretend they
don't, but I suspect the penny has dropped. Or rather clanged. But it
works. Everyone knows the part they have to play to allow me to play.
A couple of years back, as I crept up the stairs in the ''wee sma'
hours'', I could expect to find a disgruntled, angry, dad waiting for
me. Now, instead, I am confronted by a very cross little girl, arms
akimbo, furious of face, glowering. Which is, I can assure you, far,
far, worse than parental wrath.
Within a few days, Jessica has worked it out and lays down
unimpeachable ground rules. Far stricter than the rules I flouted in
days gone by. She demands supper, a shared bath, games, joint make-up
and hair-do session, then at least six stories and songs till sleep
comes. Then, and only then, am I allowed to depart.
Deviation is ruthlessly punished. One night, when I was late, she woke
up and, finding herself alone, marched through to her Granny-Bat's
bedroom and hammered on the door. ''Where's my Jean?'' she demanded, as
though they had, irresponsibly, misplaced me. ''Where's my Jean?''
Cups of tea calmed her, and finally she agreed to go back to bed, in
between granny and granddad. When I appeared I was given the full
''silent treatment''. Eventually, she roared at me: ''Go home, bad
Mummy!'' And took a vicious swipe at me with her well-booted right foot.
One evening, when I had made plans to go out early, I thought I had
her sussed. We spent part of the day on the beach, then granny took
Jessica on one of her ''special'' walks -- from which few ever return.
For afters, I had done the bath, supper, game, and story routine in
spades. Jessica had to be seriously tired.
The moment her eyelids closed, I fled downstairs to don my
serious-partying gear. Then a cup of tea while applying the war paint.
Suddenly the door flew open, and there she stood, giving me the
once-over, taking in the eye shadow and nail varnish. I was too
embarrassed to speak. Rumbled.
So I phoned to say I would be late; very late. At the end of our
visit, when we returned to our home in Inverness, life and Jessica
reverted to normal. My little girl had me all to herself again -- and
that's just how she likes it.

IN throwing his hat into the ring for the presidency of the United
States, 48-year-old Steve Forbes is almost certainly the first White
House candidate in history to wear the kilt and play the bagpipes like
the serious Scot that he is.
Whether the American people are prepared to dance to his Highland tune
remains to be seen. But you can be sure that this bid for the Republican
ticket is not the gimmick of some lightweight runner with too much money
to spend.
It is true that this recent president of Scotland's Royal Highland
Show heads a family publishing empire worth a billion dollars, that he
owns 51% of it, and is set to spend #20m of his own money in his bid for
the Republican candidacy.
But not even his more flamboyant father, the late Malcolm Forbes, was
given to spending from his vast fortune without a serious purpose. When
Malcolm set ballooning records across the world, raced his Harley
Davidson motor bikes at the age of 70, threw the world's greatest
parties, or courted Elizabeth Taylor, you knew that the commercial value
of the publicity had not been forgotten.
The profile of the flagship Forbes magazine soared to make it the most
prestigious business journal in America.
Steve, who took over on Malcolm's sudden death five years ago, is not
the extrovert his father was. But he outstrips him in intellectual depth
and his business shrewdness is reflected in the fact that the successful
empire he inherited in 1990 is currently bouncing to new heights.
As a reticent but thoughtful man, not given to the slickness of
sound-bite reaction, he nevertheless managed to make a deep impression
in his 1992 role as president of the Royal Highland and Agricultural
Society. It was the first time the honour had gone outside Britain, even
the first time outside Scotland, except for the royal family.
A tall, bespectacled figure, he speaks with quiet authority, prepares
his own material -- and delivers it without notes.
As one of the best business brains in the US -- his signed editorials
in Forbes are read by a million top Americans -- Steve has waged war on
Washington in recent years, claiming the country is being run by
professional politicians who should be replaced by businessmen.
In a fighting announcement speech in Washington at the weekend, he
portrayed himself as the one to break the old patterns, ''to unlock the
stranglehold that the political class has on American life''.
He offered no apology for being an outsider to all that. Yet, without
that personal experience of practical politics, he had not quite seen
himself in the role of White House candidate, much as he felt
disillusioned with fellow-Repubicans such as Senator Bob Dole, currently
the front runner.
What changed his mind, he told me recently, was a book called Dark
Horse, which recounted the story of Wendell Wilkie, a lawyer with even
fewer credentials who nevertheless grabbed the Republican nomination in
1940 to challenge the presidency of Franklin D Roosevelt.
It encouraged Forbes to give a crack of the whip to another dark
horse, knowing that he could more than match any candidate for
brain-power, whatever his success against the established politicians --
or the likely bid by the high-profiled General Colin Powell, who, the
pollsters say, could trounce President Clinton to become the first black
President.
Meanwhile, Steve Forbes has stepped aside from his leadership of the
Forbes empire and drafted in the youngest of his three brothers,
Timothy, as caretaker boss. Brothers Bobby and Christopher are also
involved in the business.
On a personal note, I have had the fun of telling Steve Forbes that,
much as I am acquainted with him, I kent his faither and grandfaither
even better.
Indeed, as one who listens more than he speaks, he has often asked for
personal recollections of his Scottish grandfather, Bertie Charles
Forbes, who founded the family empire in 1917 and died in 1954, when the
boy was just seven.
It is easy to tell him how Bertie (that was how he was christened)
attended the local school at Whitehill, Aberdeenshire, where my
great-grandfather was the dominie who sent the boy into the world at the
age of 14 with a well-rounded education.
He arranged Bertie's first job on the Peterhead Sentinel and, in 1904,
saw him on his way to the States, where the lad's aptitude for financial
journalism soon gained the attention of William Randolph Hearst.
Forbes spent his salary on an attic room at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel,
enabling him to rub shoulders with the mighty moguls of America. He
established Forbes in 1917 and wrote with a power that brought him a
reputation as ''the great humaniser of American business''.
His eventual successor, Malcolm, third of his five sons, fought
bravely as a sergeant on the beaches of Normandy, was highly decorated,
and returned to civilian life with thoughts of politics.
As a Republican who ruffled his own party's feathers, he gained much
attention as the young man who flew to Paris to petition Dwight D
Eisenhower, who was still Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, to stand
for President in 1952.
From that early age, Steve Forbes was growing up in a spacious and
highly privileged family setting, with figures like Eisenhower and
Richard Nixon among family visitors.
It was a political atmosphere in which Malcolm became a state senator,
ran for the governorship of New Jersey, and was hotly tipped as the
Republican answer to the up-and-coming John F Kennedy for the race to
the White House.
But a misjudged campaign diverted Malcolm from politics and back to
the family empire, a route that would make him one of American's
wealthiest men.
Now it is the turn of his eldest son to see if he can go one better.
Of course, it will be an uphill battle, but that will not deter Malcolm
Stevenson Forbes, as he was christened in 1947.
Like all four sons, he was brought up with a deep sense of his
Scottish background, was taught to play the pipes, wear the kilt, and to
know the value of a bawbee.
He followed his father's footsteps to Princeton, where he founded a
magazine called Business Today. Then, whereas many thought he should
have gone to work elsewhere, Steve returned to Fifth Avenue to become a
reporter-researcher on Forbes. From then on, he was being groomed to
succeed his father.
In 1972 he married Sabina Beekman, daughter of the retired rector of
St Paul's American Episcopal Church in Rome, and their home became one
of the villas in the Forbes family estate at Far Hills, New Jersey,
about an hour's drive across the Hudson River from Manhattan.
They raised five lovely daughters but longed for a son and heir.
Steve's brother Timothy, who now stands in at Forbes, is the only one of
the family to have fathered a boy.
Although he is not an outdoor adventurer like his father, Steve Forbes
has not failed to appreciate the value of wealth's trappings. On their
luxury yacht, the Highlander, guests have included every known name from
Prince Charles to Frank Sinatra.
The family Boeing 727, called Capitalist Tool, creates a stir wherever
it goes -- and guests invited to the palace in Tangiers or Chateau
Balleroy in France can hardly fail to be impressed.
Forbes headquarters on Fifth Avenue, New York, includes among its
treasures the world's greatest collection of the priceless Faberge eggs;
the family lands stretch to large areas of the mid-West. In London,
their home at Old Battersea House is a treasure in itself.
The Scottish connection included the historic Pitsligo Castle, near
Fraserburgh, which Steve has now handed over to a local heritage trust,
along with an endowment. He has also financed projects at Aberdeen
University, where his sister Moira was a student in the 1970s, and in
the Buchan area, where grandfather Bertie is buried.
At Bertie's old district of Whitehill, Steve finances the Forbes
picnic, a local celebration every two years.
It all seems a far cry from Whitehill to the White House of
Washington. But then Bertie set out from that corner of Aberdeenshire
with only a sound eduction, a good Scots tongue in his head -- and a few
dreams in his haversack. It was more than enough.
Two generations later, his grandson is reaching for stars of a
different galaxy. Whether he reaches them or not, Steve Forbes is driven
by energies and ambitions which, miraculously, were fostered just 100
years ago in that poor country cottage, where Robbie and Agnes Forbes
were struggling to raise their 10 children.

THE future in education without investment was ''scarcely worth
contemplating'', a leading academic claimed at a graduation ceremony in
Edinburgh on Saturday.
Professor Gordon Kirk, Principal of Moray House Institute of
Education, also said education and other essential services should be
funded on the basis of need ''rather than on the questionable assumption
about what the tax-payer is willing to pay''.
He said that, unless higher education continued to be funded in
relation to need, quality would certainly be threatened.
The principal said there was a view that the pre-eminent social good
was the creation of wealth and that those not working directly in the
manufacturing sector should be regarded as consumers or beneficiaries of
the wealth generated by others.
This kind of thinking was socially divisive. The real wealth of the
nation was found in the skills and capacities of its people.
At the ceremony at the McEwan Hall, where 160 students graduated, an
honorary degree of Doctor of Science was conferred on Sir Kenneth
Alexander ''in recognition of his distinction as scholar, academic
leader, and architect of community education in Scotland.''

MANDATORY testing of prisoners for drugs will begin in two jails early
next year, the Scottish Prison Service has announced.
Edinburgh Prison, in the city's Saughton area, and Cornton Vale, the
women's prison near Stirling, will be the first to conduct the
programmes, in which about 10% of prisoners will be chosen randomly by
computer.
Prison officers will also have the power to test prisoners if they
have reasonable suspicion of drug misuse.
Testing will be introduced in phases at other prisons later next year
when support programmes have been put in place for inmates with drug
problems.
Mr Edward Frizell, chief executive of the Scottish Prison Service,
said the programmes represented ''a major assault on the drugs
problem'', in conjunction with extensive measures already in place to
prevent drugs getting into prisons.
A spokesman for the SPS said the tests would be conducted on urine
samples. Prisoners who tested positive would be liable to prosecution or
disciplinary action. It would be a disciplinary offence to refuse to
give a sample.
He said measures to reduce drugs getting in included searches and
surveillance, closed- circuit TV at visits, and use of sniffer dogs.

A BENNY Hill revival is making a fortune for the TV company which
dropped the comedian in the years leading up to his death.
After 40 years in showbusiness, Thames TV decided his brand of raucous
humour, often involving scantily dressed girls, had gone out of fashion.
0 However, Mr Don Taffner, a New York millionaire involved in
television, who helped make the comedian a hit in the United States, has
just sold a series of specials to American television where Hill
commands a huge audience.
He said: ''Benny's estate, Thames Television,and Don Taffner will be
making millions out of this.''
The comic died in 1992, aged 67, leaving #10m. His shows were shown in
100 countries.
His former TV producer, Mr Dennis Kirkland, said: ''You must remember
that,18 months after they axed the show, they realised they had made a
mistake and asked about taking Benny back, but we were already in
negotiations with Central -- but then poor Benny died.''
Thames, now an independent production company, said it was impossible
to calculate how much he still made for it.
A spokesman said: ''What we sell is a package and the Benny Hill Show
will form a major part of that for many years. The decision to end the
show was prudent at the time, otherwise there would have been no Mr
Bean.''
At his memorial service in London, Jack Lemmon said in a note: ''Where
most comics deliver a series of powder puffs, Benny could deliver a
cannon shot.''

Alison Daniels considers the arguments for and against a road that
will split the city in more ways than one.
THE planning clock marking the start of a bureaucratic process that
could see the building of one of Britain's most expensive and
contentious urban motorways starts ticking tomorrow in Glasgow's City
Chambers.
For the first time since the old Glasgow Corporation drafted its brave
new highways plan for the city in the summer of 1960, the handful of
councillors who make up Glasgow City Council's planning sub-committee on
development control will meet to discuss granting planning permission
for the M74 extension, the final link in the motorway box that rings
central Glasgow.
From a council that has not in principle opposed the M74 but is in
reality divided on the issue, must come a ''yes'' or a ''no'' on the
construction of the 4.8-mile section of motorway that promises to be one
of the most disruptive urban road- building projects currently being
contemplated in the UK.
It is estimated that the M74 extension will cost around #250m and
involve the relocation of businesses, the demolition of homes, and the
construction of embankments, stilts, and interchanges along the South
Side of the River Clyde.
The scheme has become increasingly controversial in the national arena
given that it is advocated by a Labour authority in the face of a Labour
Party roads-building moratorium policy and increasing Government unease
over recent reports that motorways induce traffic.
It comes at a time when environmental groups claim the UK is failing
to meet European targets on reducing carbon dioxide emissions and
growing concerns about the link between pollution and asthma.
At the city level, the M74 proposal has surfaced into the public
consciousness during a year when feelings have run high over the start
of construction of the M77 through Pollok Estate in the south of the
city.
Glasgow has already witnessed violent clashes between roads protesters
and motorway contractor Wimpey, seen bitter opposition among residents
living in the South Side communities of Pollok and Corkerhill, and seen
the enduring presence of the so-called tree protesters, still living in
benders in the copse of trees spared by the chain saw.
However, with local government reorganisation looming next spring and
the motorway an integral part of a roads strategy approved by the
Scottish Secretary six years ago, Strathclyde Regional Council is
determined to press on with a scheme it essentially argues will ease
congestion on the M8, reduce accidents, and cut 10 minutes off journeys
through the city.
There is also an economic imperative -- the potential development
spin-offs in relatively poor areas adjacent to the M74 and a faster link
to Glasgow Airport currently failing to lure central belt passengers
away from Edinburgh Airport.
If built, the M74 extension will snake its way along the south side of
the River Clyde from Fullarton Road in the East End to the concrete stub
of the M8 suspended in mid-air from the southern end of the Kingston
Bridge.
En route its three to six lanes will follow the line of the
Glasgow-to-London railway, skirting Rutherglen, Toryglen, and Govanhill
before cutting a swath through the rather bleak, rundown tenements and
flat-roofed pubs around Eglinton Toll.
Raised up in places on 11-metre high stilts and grafted on to the
existing network of streets through six interchanges, the M74 is one of
the few urban motorway schemes anywhere in the UK being planned for
construction at the beginning of the next century.
Only two urban motorways, the M11 link near Hackney and the A50 in
Stoke-on-Trent, are currently under construction south of the Border and
a further road, the M66 in Manchester, has been granted planning
permission.
Around 100 commercial properties, half of which are described as small
or one-man businesses, will be swept from the M74's path and required to
relocate with the loss of 130 jobs, according to the region.
Up to 27 homes, mainly in Gray Street and Eglinton Street, will also
be demolished along with a Baptist and a Presbyterian church, a social
club and up to seven listed buildings. Railtrack's engineering depot in
Polmadie will be moved south of the road to Toryglen.
Contentiously, the road will also be built over a number of former
chromium dumps, a legacy of Glasgow's heavy steel maufacturing past and
one that protesters claim could be linked to cancer cases in the
Rutherglen area. However, the region maintains that rather than
disturbing the waste the construction of embankments will seal in the
chromium.
In fact, justifying all aspects of the motorway is something at which
Strathclyde has become adept. Mr Jack Steele, project manager of the
roads structure plan, has spent most of his working life wrestling with
the issues surrounding managing traffic flow through the city.
He is quick to refute the suggestion that the motorway is a 1960s
solution to a 1990s traffic problem. The M74 proposal has, he argues,
evolved dramatically since the publication of the highways plan for
Glasgow in 1965.
He says the 1960s strategy was reviewed in the late 1970s and then
re-examined after the council was asked to justify its roads plans in
1981 by the Secretary of State. That effectively meant, says Mr Steele,
that all roads planning was reassessed from scratch.
A year later, another traffic report confirmed the need for the M74 on
environmental and socio-economic grounds and this proposal was later
included in an updated structure plan in 1988. That plan was challenged
in court by the campaign group Glasgow for People, but the appeal was
refused.
In the subsequent six years, Mr Steele says the motorway plan has been
revised on a regular basis in accordance with requests for realignments
from Glasgow District Council, and has incorporated the findings of
recent noise, pollution, and induced traffic studies.
He says the road will not have any significant effect on air quality
and that the landscaping incorporated into the plan will lessen the
impact of a concrete viaduct striding across the south of the city.
''There will be a lot of tree planting along the sides of the road, as
well as walkways and cycleways. In creating these areas of green we will
reduce the impact of the road and improve access to the Clyde walkway.''
Fundamentally, though, the justification for its construction remains
that of the sixties' planners, reducing the environmental impact of
traffic growth, which in the last decade has risen by around 4% every
year in the Greater Glasgow area and 2% in the city centre.
It is predicted that the motorway will draw 65,000 vehicles a day from
the grid of streets in the East End and reduce congestion on the city
centre stretch of the M8 by siphoning off a further 28,000 vehicles a
day. By 2015, it is predicted 110,000 vehicles a day will use the
motorway. Pressure should also be taken off the Kingston Bridge, the
integrity of which has prompted some cause for concern.
Acknowledging that the motorway could result in the generation of more
traffic the council nevertheless sees little contradiction in its
construction and its integrated roads and public transport policy, which
hinges on discouraging private commuters from travelling into the city
centre. The primary M74 users will, it is predicted, be commercial.
On this basis, the proposal has elicited widespread support from
organisations like Scottish Enterprise, the Glasgow Development Agency,
Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, and the Scottish Airports Authority, as
well as a clutch of freight and electronics companies. The road is
expected to create 350 construction jobs and in the longer term between
2000 and 3000 jobs as a consequence of inward investment.
For a project of such significance, a certain degree of confusion
surrounds the mechanics of the planning process. If all goes according
to format and Glasgow City Council's planning sub-committee grants
permission, the specifications and alignment agreed are final, although
under the local government reforms the planning of the M74 extension
will pass to the Scottish Office once the new unitary authorities come
into being next April.
However, council insiders predict tomorrow's discussion on the
motorway is likely to last all of 30 seconds if, as is suspected, there
is a request for a site visit and public hearing.
In that event, the process would be stalled by another four or five
weeks and could prompt the Scottish Office to step in and call for a
local public inquiry, a move that would give objectors an opportunity to
restate arguments put forward during the consultation process.
Since the start of that process in January, the region has received
more than 600 letters of objection, including submissions from Historic
Scotland, Scottish Natural Heritage, the Scottish Wildlife Trust, and
the city council's parks and recreation department.
Friends of the Earth's Scottish director, Mr Kevin Dunion, is
unconvinced that Strathclyde has fully considered the implication of the
Royal Commission and the Government's Standing Advisory Committee on
Trunk Road Assessment reports on induced traffic.
''The M74 is an out-of-date scheme that will not solve anything in the
long run because it will do nothing to check the continued rise of car
use. All the region's claims of time savings, fewer accidents, and an
even better environment rely on their assertion that extra traffic will
not be generated.''
The most vociferous objections have come from the increasingly
motivated local residents groups, many of whom were active in supporting
the communities opposed to the M77.
At this grass-roots level, protest has centred on the intrusion of a
motorway into some of Glasgow's less well-heeled areas and its impact on
the cityscape, the effect of pollution, and the loss of some open spaces
used as play areas.
Ms Rosie Kane, a student and mother of two young children, has become
something of a roads expert in her attempts to galvanise support in the
streets around her flat in Bankhall Street in Govanhill.
She has delivered 20,000 pamphlets and says her ''No M74'' campaign
has attracted widespread support. From her perspective there are no
benefits in a motorway which, she says, will isolate those along its
fringes with no access to a car. Like her co-activists in Rutherglen and
Toryglen she is concerned about pollution and has been highly critical
of the region's consultation process.
Currently in the process of fighting to claim compensation in the
European courts for those living in the vicinity of the M77, the
campaign group Glasgow for People claims the M74 is a white elephant,
the economic benefits of which are far outweighed by the negative impact
on the city.
The group is also opposed to the possible so-called ''design, build,
finance, and operate'' scheme of funding the road, which it describes as
''shadow tolling'' and says will only encourage traffic flow because the
operators will have a direct financial interest in the number of
vehicles using the road.
The organisation's Mr Ian Cowan also accuses Strathclyde of misleading
the public in the non-technical pamphlet published to explain the
environmental impact of the road.
''This is one of the most expensive motorways built in Scotland. It is
a monster motorway which is not going to solve any problems. Completing
the box around Glasgow will release all the pent-up traffic and, in our
view, rather than solve the problem of traffic it will ultimately make
congestion on the M8 worse.''

After a successful conference in the SECC, Liberal Democrat delegates
left Glasgow with mixed impressions -- nice city, shame about the
riverside, Iain Wilson discovers
GLASGOW still has a long way to go if it is to win over the lucrative
party conference circuit. Delegates to the Liberal Democrat conference
loved the city and its people -- but could not believe how boring and
depressing were some of the central areas.
Many thought the River Clyde should be a thriving marine paradise
packed with boats and riverside cafes, and complained it was just
endless stretches of water flanked by paving stones and an occasional
bench.
The Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre also came in for some
flak, with the critics likening it to an aircraft hangar. In a straw
poll, delegates also complained that the SECC was too far from the city
centre.
Delegates Tony Malin and his wife Liz, from Bournemouth -- a popular
conference venue -- said Glaswegians were friendly and warm, but they
questioned the lack of riverside facilities and shopping around the
SECC.
Mr Malin asked: ''Glasgow is a wonderful venue, but where are the
riverside cafes, the floating restaurants, even boats? It's a real
waste. Glasgow has campaigned for tourism, and it is disappointing that
there is nothing on the river.''
Durham delegate John Lightley said the city was one of contrasts --
not always for the better. He recalled: ''When walking along Argyle
Street, there was a great deal of property desperately in need of being
revitalised.
''It presented a sleazy picture of the city, with tenement doors dark
and uninviting. Then you come across Sauchiehall Street, which is a
different world. Buchanan Street was also delightful.
''But on walking from Central Hotel to the SECC, I found the riverside
area dead. It is not being used.''
He said visitors considered the conference venue barn-like, functional
rather than beautiful, adding that its location away from shopping
centres was detracting.
New Forest delegate Peter Chambers was impressed with Glasgow, where
the welcome had been better than he had expected. The SECC, a ''huge
hangar of a place'', was very practical ''but cut off from the rest of
the city''.
Delegate Claire Keetch, from Hereford, agreed -- after pushing a pram
all the way along the riverside to the shops: ''I went once, and it was
very far. Nor was it particularly pedestrian friendly.'' She had
reckoned to have spent at least #600 over the conference.
Stroud's Shirley Hewson said she much preferred Glasgow to a seaside
resort as a conference venue. There was so much to do, and the city's
history and architecture were fascinating. But she, too, pleaded for
waterfront developments.
Teenager Roger Crouch, from Oxford, suspected the sheer scale of
Glasgow meant that the conference had not played a significant role in
the city's lifestyle over the week.
An estimated 1600 delegates, plus 900 daily visitors and press,
probably spent #1m in the city during the five-day conference, according
to the party. Taxis in particular did a roaring trade from the SECC into
town, where prices ranged from 79p for a cup of tea to #1.95 for a beer.
Charges for snacks were reasonable.
Party leader Paddy Ashdown said: ''Glasgow has been an excellent venue
for an excellent conference. The facilities are first class. As the
first party to take an annual conference to Scotland, we can highly
recommend it.''
The Greater Glasgow Tourist Board and Convention Bureau estimated that
the conference was worth #800,000 to the city -- plus untold riches from
spin-off benefits.
A spokesman said it had been an ''amazing'' conference in terms of the
media looking at other aspects of the city, which had been given a high
profile at home and abroad. He said it was recognised that something had
to be done with the waterfront, and both Glasgow District Council and
Glasgow Development Agency were looking at the situation.

KAMES and Tighnabruaich, set side-by-side at the top of the Kyles of
Bute, are experiencing their worst social and economic decline in 30
years, according to residents and businessmen who are putting the blame
squarely at the door of the local enterprise company.
Investment in the area by Argyll and the Islands Enterprise has been
described as ''cavalier and misplaced'' and a ''complete waste of
taxpayers money'', leaving the local economy in turmoil, unemployment
high, and residents with little hope for the future.
''We are being left in a state of irretrievable financial distress,''
said Allan Neill, owner of the Royal Hotel in Tighnabruaich.
''Financial assistance seems to be reserved for either hare-brained
schemes, business ventures of dubious value, or enterprises contributing
little to the improvement of the main business sector, tourism. There
are examples of the Lec's mismanagement everywhere.''
Mr Neill who has run his Tighnabruaich hotel for almost 40 years,
added: ''We had no complaints with the former Highlands and Islands
Development Board. At least they came and talked with us and helped us
save this area from decline many years ago. But their successors have
allowed the enterprise culture to evaporate and turned themselves into a
full-blown quango.''
One of the concerns is a #600,000 ''industrial estate'' which was
carved out on a nearby hillside two years ago. Only one company, which
has since gone out of business, took up residence. ''This development is
now nothing but a shanty town with rubbish piling up. It's an eyesore,''
said Ian Boag of the Tighnabruaich Hotel.
''There are countless instances of local people trying to develop
worthwhile projects -- for example a caravan park and leisure complex
which would have brought people to the area -- but all of them are
knocked back for one reason or another.
''What we need is a proper investment strategy for the area which will
result in projects that will create employment. To date no jobs have
emerged out of any project AIE have backed in this area.''
Argyll and the Islands Enterprise defended its record of investment in
the area. Acting chief executive Neil Frances said: ''AIE rigorously
investigates every application made to it for financial assistance. We
have a duty to ensure that taxpayers' money is spent wisely and cost
effectively.
''This is a responsibility we take with the utmost seriousness. We
have no problems in explaining our actions and indeed publish a routine
monthly list detailing assistance approved to projects in our area.''
District Councillor Douglas Currie said he felt that some investment
money could have been ''better spent'' and was keen to see a joint
initiative.
He said: ''I think the Lec has been trying to do something for the
area but perhaps the time has now come for a meeting between the Lec and
local businessmen to find the best way forward.''
Retired businessman Ernest Williams, who has lived in Tighnabruaich
for over 30 years, said he has been saddened by the lack of enterprise
company help. ''I have seen a great deterioration in this area in recent
years and there has been little assistance either from the district
council or the local enterprise company. It's a great shame and the
entire village is angry.''

<RECORDNO>976208117</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
COMPUTER systems and memory chips worth millions are being stolen to
order by gangs contracted to supply the latest technology to former Iron
Curtain countries.
So many complete systems and parts are being stolen that computer
experts and police believe organised criminals are behind the racket.
With chips now worth up to #500 each on the black market and so many
businesses offering computer technology through adverts in magazines,
drug users have turned to stealing chips to finance their habits.
Others use computer parts as an ''alternative currency'' to buy drugs.
The computer industry and police plan to launch a new initiative next
month to halt computer crime and improve computer security.
Details of the joint action committee are being kept secret until then
but BT, the AA, and insurance companies are understood to be involved.
Financial institutions in the City provide crooks with the ideal
source of up-to-date microchips because of the sophisticated dealing
systems they use.
Even Government offices are not immune. The Department of Transport
was targeted in February, and Customs and Excise offices in Southend
lost chips worth more than #100,000.
Mark Lang, editor of IBM Systems User magazine, said: ''There is a
premium on computer technology in the Eastern bloc. Their stuff tends to
be obsolete and needs updating. A lot of kit is being stolen to order,
with the thieves being told exactly what is required.''
He added: ''The effect on some businesses can be catastrophic if they
don't have their systems backed up by storing data. When the chips are
stolen, the whole computer is corrupted and you lose everything.
''Most computers have nothing to identify them and chips can't be seen
once they are installed. Some thieves take personal computers apart so
carefully and then after they have stolen the chip the user doesn't
realise what is wrong until he tries to switch on.''
Computer crime is estimated to have cost British business up to #200m
in the past year.
Police sources say computer theft from the Inns of Court in London
could throw the legal system into jeopardy and expose confidential
information relating to some of the country's leading citizens.
One source said: ''If the criminals looked at what was available to
them it could be invaluable information for them for future
activities.''

Disabled people feel a weight of discrimination stolidly hampering
everyday life. JENNIFER CUNNINGHAM discusses fresh efforts to make
Scotland's new local authorities listen and take action
THE SOCIAL workers went to visit Moira when she became
wheelchair-bound. They were there to give their professional assessment
and advice. Instead they issued a threat: that unless her husband gave
up his job, their children would be taken into care.
It is difficult to insist on your rights, however strong your case,
but when their lives have just fallen apart most people are grateful
rather than demanding. No longer. The trading of such experiences is
fuelling the smouldering sense of injustice felt by disabled people into
a blaze of public anger which has become the disabled lobby.
We saw it in action for the first time last year when the defeat of
the Civil Rights Disabled Persons Bill dashed hopes of
anti-discrimination legislation with clear sanctions provoking disabled
protestors to block access to the Houses of Parliament.
Disabled people already have legal rights to financial and practical
assistance to allow them to lead their lives, what they want now is the
means to enforce them.
Andrew Reid, community care planner for Strathclyde Region, wheelchair
user and organiser of a Scottish conference on the empowerment of the
disabled acknowledges that Scotland's 650,000 disabled people are now
ready to borrow tactics from other anti-discrimination campaigns on
grounds of race, sex or age.
It was the quietest, best-behaved civil rights rally I've ever
witnessed, but a tangible sense of common purpose was evident as
wheelchairs manoeuvred deftly below a ramped stage and the message was
spelled out in sign language at a conference in Erskine last week.
Representatives of all sorts of disabled people had gathered to give
notice to Scotland's new authorities that, come April, disabled people
would be chapping at the door of every council chamber and would not be
put off by two flights of stairs.
That the conference attracted more than double the number of delegates
originally expected was one indication that the new councillors are
willing to start by listening. They got an earful. Dr Jenny Morris, a
freelance writer, consultant and trainer on disability issues, left her
audience in no doubt that it was they, providers of services and members
of society at large, who would have to adapt their ideas on care,
carers, dependence and independence.
Attacking one of social work's current concerns as a typical
misapprehension, she said: ''The references to children of disabled
people as young carers is an extraordinary failure to recognise that the
parents have statutory rights to care, adaptations and equipment.
''It is the duty of the social work authority to assess disabled
people for practical assistance. Empowerment happens when non-disabled
people are our allies to bring about control of their lives by disabled
people themselves. All civil rights movements need allies.''
She argued that such allies would be needed to dispense effectively
with the medical model of disability in which people became objects to
be made more normal and were expected to be flexible where society was
inflexible.
''The disability movement in contrast offers the social model of
disability: that physical or mental impairment need not prevent us
leading perfectly good lives. My impairment is that I cannot walk, but
my disability is inaccessible buses,'' she declared.
It is clear that the disability lobby now sees itself as part of a
much wider human-rights movement and the requisite consciousness-raising
is under way. Dr Morris included on her list of fundamental human rights
the right to live in your own home, to decide when to get up in the
morning or when to go to the toilet and to have personal and social
relationships. ''We are talking basic rights, not what the Government
called a wish list,'' she added.
All of this was music to the ears of delegates such as Christine
Symons of Liberty in the Borders, a lobbying group whose strength of
both numbers and feeling took their district council by surprise when 17
people in wheelchairs turned up to lobby a meeting scheduled for an
upstairs room. The result was that disabled people now have a key for
the local public toilets for the disabled which had previously been
vandalised.
There's more to life than access to toilets, however, as Bill Gray
from Dunfermline pointed out. ''Many district councillors don't
recognise the rights of disabled people to become councillors. They make
no provision for them to attend meetings,'' he said.
There are some much-welcomed innovative policies in Scotland. Leader
of the pack is the Lothian Independent Living Centre, which under the
care in the community policies, allows disabled people control of their
individual care budget, bringing with it the power to hire and fire
carers. Strathclyde has since followed suit and Tayside is in the
process of doing so.
Wheelchair users, such as Christine Symons, whose councils do not yet
operate such a scheme are not going to let the opportunity pass them,
but Peter Bates, chairman of the Association of Directors of Social Work
warned that no-one could assume it would happen automatically.
He said: ''After 25 years of social work in Scotland, we believe the
issue of empowerment should be at the forefront for the next 25 years,
but there are issues to be addressed such as how the smaller authorities
will sustain services in the cold financial climate in which we will all
be operating. A window of opportunity is opening; are we going to step
through it or stay at one side?''

LABOUR recognises that a well-trained, well-treated workforce is vital
for a successful economy at home and in Europe, Mr David Martin, the
vice president of the European Parliament, said yesterday in Edinburgh.
Mr Martin, Euro-MP for the Lothians, was initiating, along with Shadow
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, the Scottish launch of the European
Parliamentary Labour Party's campaign for a fairer deal for workers.
Attacking the ''negative Tory view of Europe'', Mr Martin said his
party believed in a social Europe and would sign the Social Chapter.
''This will bring the social benefits enjoyed by working people
throughout the European Union to the people of Britain.
''We are the only member state which is not implementing the chapter
and our people and businesses are suffering as a result.''
He said thousands of leaflets would be distributed throughout Scotland
and the rest of the UK telling people they were missing out on a better
deal for pregnant women, the right to paid holidays for full and
part-time workers, and the right to be consulted about decisions
affecting their working lives.
''We will also tell British workers the UK Government is opposing a
new European law which would protect them from having to work more than
an average of 48 hours a week.
''Tired workers are less efficient and more accident prone,'' said Mr
Martin.

An affable knight and a millionaire many times over, Terence Conran
has captured the spirit of the age and transformed it into a lucrative
business, by design
BEHOLD the designer as waiter manque, lurching into a piece of mime.
But first, by way of explanation, Terence Conran says: ''There'll be a
great deal of action and a lot of this . . .''
He raises his right arm high above his head as if bearing an imaginary
platter, tilts his burly corporation forward and, unconsciously
deploying an Ollie Hardy scuttle, sets off across that section of the
floor flagged with illuminated glass. Here is the bridge which links
dining area to show-off kitchen, turning noisy customers into a
congregation at the swish altar of performance cuisine.
Conran's stage directions over, he resumes his seat in the vast, new
space which, over two floors, now accommodates 750 diners at Mezzo, his
latest restaurant in London's Wardour Street. With chortling pride he
points to the moulded aluminium chairs at each blond wood table chunky
as a chopping board.
His voice becomes confidential: ''I'm telling you something that
nobody else knows. The original chairs in this design were made in
America for a penitentiary during the thirties. Practical, but also
good-looking, they were light enough not to do much damage if prisoners
grabbed them in a riot.'' The thought of such attributes now finding a
restaurant purpose raises the chortle to a hoot.
He is 63, an affable knight and millionaire many times over whose
ability to create relaxed but posh ambiences has made him one of the
most powerful tastemongers of our times. A Londoner by birth, he divides
his days between homes in London, Berkshire and the French countryside
of Provence, but Conran has also long regarded himself as an honorary
Scot because of his admiration for Glaswegian chutzpah and its visual
elan.
Glasgow was the first out-of-London location for his Habitat in the
seventies. His advocacy of the School of Art is well established and he
was an ecstatic member of the Arts Council panel which chose Glasgow as
site winner for the forthcoming Year of Architecture and Design. ''But I
have to say that we were enormously impressed by the imagination of all
of the submissions,'' he recalls. ''In fact I'm very optimistic that, in
design terms, there is something very exciting happening right through
the country once again.''
But here in his new Soho lair, Conran is playing another season as god
of creation. As before, everything about Mezzo, which opened on
Saturday, is a testament to his credo that eating in public has become
part of the entertainment business, an occasion when people, even before
lifting a fork, encounter such ''a buzz of excitement they go phew!''
Conran calls that response the wild factor, and by revealing a
restaurant's heart behind glass walls, he has transformed the kitchen
into a cabaret, where chefs and waiters are glimpsed, caught up in a
ballet of complex balancing acts and skills. If nothing else, such
exposure keeps them on their toes and stops that ancient ritual of
sabotage between those who cook and those who front the house.
Today, though, it is this moment of terror and bedlam before the doors
officially open -- the moment when the actual components of a grand
scheme are assembled for the first time -- that Conran loves above all
others.
Against the frantic whine of drilling and the anxious yells of
contractors vying to be heard above the din and josh of artisans, Conran
fizzes with the thrill of another jigsaw completed. It is now more than
30 years since the clean lines and primary colours of his Habitat
philosophy began to rule the British sitting room, and in that time he
has never once lost his belief that design is an exhilarating adventure.
But candour as well as lauded achievement attracts a hive of enemies,
and Conran, accused by some of being fickle, dictatorial, and a
consummate womaniser, has always had his detractors. His second wife,
novelist and Superwoman go-getter, Shirley Conran, describes him as ''a
sort of Diaghilev of design'', an image which bolsters the suggestion of
an autocratic nature.
His third and present wife is Caroline Conran, the food writer, and
between these two marriages he has five children, among them Jasper, the
fashion designer. Of course, those who resent his shopping evangelism,
his robust certainties about how things should look and taste, have
relished the recent stushie over his authorised biography.
Reviewing Nicholas Ind's book in the Sunday Times, Roy Strong was
anything but gallant, scattering words like surly, arrogant, bullying,
petulant, aggressive, cruel . . . through the prose. But the former
director of the Victoria and Albert Museum also implied that Conran, in
his private life, was appallingly neglectful of others, including his
children.
Reading Strong's criticisms one felt old scores were being settled by
one knight against another. But today Sir Terence claims to be utterly
perplexed by Sir Roy's attack. ''I was, and still am, extremely upset
because I had always considered Strong a friend and colleague,'' he
says. ''Our mutual friends are equally baffled about it, especially
because there are certain things which are just not true: that bit about
me poo-pooing my wife's cancer counselling -- it's wrong on two counts.
First she has never counselled cancer sufferers, and if she had I would
never dream of belittling the value of such work.''
Strong's review, he adds, has also been extremely distressing for his
children, two of whom wrote to say they did not consider him a brutal
parent and that they all loved him. ''I simply don't understand it,'' he
repeats. ''Did Strong want to be noticed, or something?'', and he adds
his own mischievious rider: ''I suppose he feels that here I am getting
on with doing all sorts of projects and there he is writing about small
gardens.''
Whatever its motive the critique allowed London to indulge its passion
for malice, but in retrospect Conran believes the biography was a
mistake. ''I don't dislike the book. Nicholas Ind is a very nice man,
but I realise now that private lives should stay private, at least until
after the subject's death. Certainly I would never consider doing a book
like that again. It's regrettable, but it's past.''
In appearance Conran is an unlikely emmissary of style. Stocky and
crumply no matter how expensive the suit, he always looks as if he has
hurled himself into his clothes rather than taken time to dress in a
painstaking manner. Educated at Bryanston, he trained as a textile
designer at the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London, later
falling under the influence of Eduardo Paolozzi, the Edinburgh-born
sculptor, with whom, for a time, he shared a flat.
An entirely self-made businessman who, more than once, has experienced
the nightmare of hearing the bank manager announce he cannot honour the
wages cheque, Conran now possesses personal wealth of around #100m, the
bulk of that having come from shares in Storehouse which he formed in
1986 by merging Habitat/Mothercare with BHS.
Four years later, after acrimonious battles, he retired as the
Storehouse chairman, glad to be free of the high-finance jungle and
resuming a hands-on role in design and retailing: he bought back that
sophisticated temple of style, the Conran Shop for #3.5m. That was in
1990 and by then he had already blended design with restaurant ownership
in the launch of Bibendum at the elegantly restored Michelin Building in
South Kensington.
There followed the Blue Print Cafe located in the Design Museum at
Butlers Wharf, and nearby he now has Le Pont de la Tour with its
cinematic views of Tower Bridge. In 1993 Conran revived memories of one
of London's most urbane wartime haunts when he reopened Quaglino's in a
new guise in St James's. According to Egon Ronay this has now become a
place of such brilliance in design as well as food for mass pockets that
it is epoch-making.
The desgn commentator, Dejan Sudjic decribes it as being  the first
fin de siecle interior of the 1990s. ''We wanted it to be fun and
vivacious with the charm and charisma of the old Quaglino's,'' says
Conran, ''but it also had to have that wild factor which is entirely
modern.''
But if we are now to look on Quaglino's as one of Britain's new period
piece restaurants, marking London's revival as the most exciting food
capital in the world, Mezzo, with its gleaming, curled staircase evoking
a Busby Berkley chorus prop, will reinforce Conran's reputation as the
emperor of eating out.
Not that Mezzo will be the end of it. A mighty food emporium is being
planned for the King's Road, and there is also his vision for a Conran
Shop and restaurant in Glasgow, the intention being to house both inside
the new Intercontinental Hotel currently taking shape beneath the
dazzlingly rejuvenated skin of the city's old Sheriff Court.
All this pell-mell activity suggests both workaholism and a lust for
gold. The first is, no doubt, the result of Conran's genius for detail.
His design and merchandising teams, as well as his chefs, maintain that
within minutes he can conjure up taxingly perceptive questions to which
you had better know the answer. As for the second condition, he argues
that it was never his aim to reside on mountain tops of money. Neither
was it his intention to build himself into big business.
His only dream, starting out in the 1950s, was to replace the drab
rationbook interiors of Britain with the handsome simplicity of
provincial France. And, beyond all expectations, that dream turned into
reality as an entire generation ditched the greys and browns and frilly
antimacassars of department store home furnishings to choose, instead,
Conran's cheekily bright modernism of the swinging sixties.
''I always wanted the designs to have an egalitarian quality which was
difficult in those class-ridden days,'' he says. ''Today the young don't
give a damn about class unless they have parents who are either
extremely snobby or very left-wing.''
And the Establishment, even though it may still hold sway, is, in
Conran's belief, much more openly ridiculed and questioned. Consider his
own criticisms of Prince Charles's attitudes to architecture: ''I
disagree enormously with his opinions and regard him as someone with a
very closed mind, but at least he has opened up a dialogue. We now get
discussions about architecture on television which never happened
before.''
However, Conran feels the Prince of Wales finds it difficult to have
any enthusiasm for progress. ''He points to the architecture of the past
and asks: 'Why isn't it like that anymore?' Well, fine, all of us should
learn from that part of the past which remains valuable. We must learn
history before we can try to make changes for the modern world, but my
complaint against the Prince is that he encourages only facade-ism; that
slapping on to the front of buildings a sort of toytown Palladian style
which has no depth to it.''
What does seem true, however, is that in the course of twenty-first
century architecture the restaurant as a place of worship will over-take
the cathedral. ''I suppose they do both nourish a sense of community,''
muses Conran, ''and although I don't think of myself as a particularly
spiritual person I believe designers have to understand the spirit, have
to consider not just what will work in the best possible way but what
will also give delight and lift people's hearts.
''You know a tremendous many in this country still work in
surroundings which must really cause them distress, and government
offices must be some of the worst of all places.''
Good design, he has always insisted, doesn't have to be expensive but
in Britain it often remains unfairly stuck with an effete and elitist
label.
''There is a tremendous amount of new creative talent bubbling to the
surface in Britain but we have a Government that sits on it and doesn't
recognise that design not only touches everybody's life, it is of
fundamental value to the economy.''
Yet the problem of meagre investment doesn't just lie with government.
At art institutions up and down the country we train some of the best
designers in the world, then we wave them off, gift-wrapped for oversees
competitiors, because there are so few challenging jobs to detain them
at home. ''As a result we're in the bizarre situation of buying back
their work as imports.''
But how would Terence Conran himself wish to be remembered? As the
modern magnifico who brought the garlic crusher to suburbia? The
sensualist of the sofabed? The hedonist who turned eating into glamorous
spectacle?
''I really like nothing better than to live surrounded by white,
sunlit walls with just a few, exquisite objects,'' he says. ''In fact
what I would enjoy most is a sparse, monkish existence.''
For a second he is reflective before a guffaw interrupts that unlikely
proposition. Then he's off again, fine-tuning the chic of his latest
fleshpot, the man who turns the sensible into the pleasurable, and,
perhaps more than anyone, has used design to prise us out of philistine
notions about ourselves.

BEING a journalist in Perth last week hunting the great split in the
SNP was a bit like being on an expedition to find the yeti. No-one had
seen the mythical beast first hand, and rumours about what it looked
like varied wildly, but it had to exist because so many people said they
had seen its footprints.
We had even been given a helpful route map by Labour's George
Robertson in the now infamous ''leak'' of his internal memorandum to MPs
in which, aside from the stuff about letter bombs and death threats,
said: ''The current split in the SNP between those who go along with
devolution as a stepping stone to independence and those who see it as a
trap is useful to us.''
The key words there are ''those who go along with devolution''. In the
run-up to the next General Election, we are going to hear little from
the SNP but attacks on the inadequacy of the Home Rule plans and doubts
about whether Labour will deliver in any event. Expect repeated use of
phrases like puppet assembly and toy-town parliament.
The SNP leader will sharpen his anti-devolution rhetoric to play to
those in his own party who most distrust the devolution on offer from
Tony Blair. What he will not do -- and crucially, what no-one inside the
SNP is asking him to do, not even the likes of Uncle Tom-baiting Jim
Mitchell -- is commit his MPs to voting against Home Rule at Westminster
or to an abstentionist policy should the devolved body be set up.
There is no policy split in the SNP and the difference of opinion over
tactics amounts to little more than unease about wording and
presentation, which is why the conference gave such an ovation to Mr
Salmond and why the press failed to find a monster roaming the fringe
meetings of Perth.
Having failed to find something to fit the footprints, we were
desperately keen to focus on the party's internal elections on Saturday.
Here, it was possible to paint a picture of some kind of snub to Mr
Salmond but it was actually more complex than that. ''It was really a
very typical SNP tendency to seek checks and balances,'' said one senior
figure at the weekend.
Everyone attending the conference knew that there had been internal
differences on the national executive. Whether these are blood feuds or
creative tensions depends on who is offering an opinion but to clear the
decks for the General Election hustings to come, the leadership tried to
oust some opponents.
In the case of Mr Alex Neil in the key post of policy vice-convener,
the leadership was keen that new MP Roseanna Cunningham beat him, but he
held on fairly comfortably by 383 votes to 228. Delegates then rewarded
Ms Cunningham by making her the top-polling of 10 additional candidates
to the national executive.
The leadership would also have preferred ex-Labour MP Dick Douglas to
oust treasurer Kenny MacAskill but the incumbent held on by 346 to 207.
The possibility of unseating Gil Paterson as administration
vice-convener was effectively doomed when preferred candidate Tom
Chalmers had to withdraw through illness.
However, there was good news for Mr Salmond too. Two figures from the
fundamentalist wing of the party -- Ms Christine Creech and Mr Jim
Mitchell -- failed to unseat the three incumbent vice-presidents, and
the latter, the controversial Paisley firebrand who grabbed so many
headlines this week, suffered from being seen as a wrecking influence
and was ousted from the executive completely.
Another regular critic of the leadership also suffered as a result.
The post of vice-convener for local government went to Councillor
Maureen Watt, with 307 votes comfortably seeing off Mr Iain Lawson on
125 and Mr Keith Brown on 99. Mr Lawson paid the penalty for his
criticisms, losing not only that vote but plunging down the list of 10
extra executive places to last place, having topped that list last year.
At his post-conference briefing, if Mr Salmond was disappointed he hid
it well. ''I am very pleased with the balance of the executive that the
conference has given me,'' he said.''
Mr Salmond's absolute determination is to avoid being painted into a
corner over future tactics. The fundamentalists in his party were
encouraged by his criticism of devolution but he is determined to keep
that option open should Labour deliver. However, the closer such a home
rule scheme comes, the more likely it will be that tactical
disagreements will re-emerge.

THREE police officers and a special constable were hailed as heroes
yesterday for their bravery in rescuing a family from a blazing
Midlothian house.
Lothian and Borders police said they had shown great courage in
bringing five people out of the building in Greenhill Park, Penicuik.
''They disregarded their own safety in removing the occupants from the
house, the ground floor of which was well alight,'' said a spokesman,
who added that they were treating the fire as suspicious.
One of those saved also paid tribute to the four rescuers, saying he
and the rest of the family owed their lives to them.
The alarm was raised when flames were spotted coming from the
semi-detached house around 1.20am yesterday.
The three constables and a special constable, first to reach the
scene, kicked down the door and made their way through dense black
smoke. They found a 37-year-old woman in a ground-floor room and pulled
her to safety.
They then went back into the house and rescued the occupier, Mr George
Bargon, 41, and his 11-year-old daughter, Suzanne, who were asleep in
upstairs bedrooms.
They also rescued Craig and Joanna Peden, both 19, who were asleep in
a loft converted bedroom.
The 37-year-old woman and Joanna Peden were both taken to Edinburgh
Royal Infirmary, suffering from the effects of smoke.
Constables Kenneth Turnbull, 32, William Aitken, 46, and Kevin Macari,
26, and Special Constable Thomas Clark were also taken to hospital,
suffering from the effects of smoke.
Mr Peden said he and Joanna knew nothing of the fire until the police
officers came racing up the stairs. ''I can't bear to think what might
have happened if they hadn't risked their lives for us,'' he said.
A spokesman for Lothian and Borders Fire Brigade described the
officers as brave men: ''They didn't think about the risk to their own
lives -- they just went in and did the job.''
Lothian and Borders police said later that a 37-year-old woman had
been detained in connection with the incident.

<TEXT>
HOME Secretary Michael Howard yesterday hinted that he would unveil
plans for a National Crime Prevention Agency at next month's
Conservative Party conference.
He signalled that an announcement was imminent while hailing fresh
figures, to be published this week, that will confirm the biggest fall
in crime for 40 years.
The agency is set to be part of the Tories' election strategy to
regain the initiative on law and order from Labour.
Former Tory Minister Alan Clark yesterday claimed Mr Howard was also
planning a party conference announcement of moves to bring MI5 into the
battle against organised crime and drug-trafficking.
However, Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw kept the pressure on the
Tories by claiming they had failed to tackle a massive surge in crime.
The new National Crime Prevention Agency is expected to involve
greater pooling of information between police forces. It will also allow
the police more freedom to raise cash from the private sector for crime
prevention work.
Ministers have been examining partnerships in the US in which, for
example, some insurance companies put an extra dollar on premiums to
support local squads tackling vehicle crime.
Mr Howard said: ''We have been looking for some time at ways of
improving our focus on crime prevention and, in particular, making sure
that the good things that are happening in some parts of the country
spread everywhere.
''There's a tremendous amount to be achieved by getting the rest up to
the standard of the best,'' he told GMTV's Sunday Programme.
Pressed over whether he would establish an agency, Mr Howard said:
''We're looking at ideas on that and you may not have very much longer
to wait until we make an announcement on crime prevention.''
Meanwhile, Mr Clark was calling for measures to tackle serious crime.
''Is it not time that we set up an elite national force, equivalent in
power and status to the FBI in the United States?'' he wrote in the Mail
On Sunday.
Asked about the new crime figures, to be published on Wednesday, Mr
Howard said: ''They will continue the trend that we have seen over the
last two years. Crime is falling.
''It's far too high still and of course there's much more to be done
but we are seeing the biggest fall in crime for 40 years.''
Mr Straw accused Mr Howard of ''astonishing complacency'' over crime.
He comes out with the (Conservative) Central Office patter that this is
the largest drop in crime for over 40 years,'' he said on BBC TV's
Breakfast With Frost.
''I wish he'd put this in context, which is that over the last 16
years crime has doubled.''
Ms Mary Honeyball, of the Association of Chief Probation Officers,
said: ''We welcome the improving trend in reported crime but the figures
should be treated cautiously. Police figures give only the broadest feel
for the way actual levels of crime are going.''

DOG collars in the dole queue may be the price the Kirk has to pay
when it comes to good stewardship of its most expensive resources, a
divinity student has claimed in a call for a radical look at its
employment practices.
The candidate for the ministry, maintaining there were strong
arguments for putting limits on ministers' job security, proposed a
system of fixed- term contracts.
Mr Richard Baxter said that, if a congregation found it had called the
wrong person, it had to hope another vacancy committee would make the
same mistake.
''Failing that, it must wait for the minister to punch the president
of the guild, run off with the organist's wife or commit some other
disciplinary offence if it wishes to act on its discovery.''
The New College student, writing in the Kirk's magazine Life and Work,
claimed the ordained ministry was one of the last bastions of the job
for life.
Under the current system, ministers had almost complete freedom to
accept a call to another charge.
Mr Baxter said the whole arrangement was very one-sided. Limits on the
job would deal with the critical situation where viable congregations
went to the wall because the vacancy committee got it wrong and there
was no corrective procedure.
''However, the picture of destitute ministers and their families
wandering the streets, having been unceremoniously dumped out of job and
home by a congregation which just fancies a change, is unlikely to
appeal to a caring church.''
The balance could be redressed by a system of fixed-term contracts
with final-year discussions on whether or not it should be renewed.
He said that, in most cases, the relationship between minister and
congregation worked well.
''However, we cannot ignore the damage which can result to minister
and congregation alike when the wrong person is in the wrong place at
the wrong time.''

FORMER Nationalist MP George Reid gave the conference a visionary yet
uncompromisingly pragmatic picture of the possibilities offered by the
devolution route to independence yesterday.
Coming back, after a decade overseas working with the International
Red Cross in Geneva, allowed him to offer a view less clouded by the
rivalries and cross-party bitterness of domestic politics.
Although he spoke on the issue at the very heart of differences of
opinion within the SNP -- the harnessing of an unsatisfactory devolved
assembly and its transformation into a full sovereign Parliament -- he
was given an enthusiastic hearing across the party spectrum.
''We should be secure enough in our beliefs to make common cause,
where possible, with those who go most of the way with us,'' he said.
Nationalism is now so firmly established that, while we can freely
attack the alien British state, there is simply no need to attack those
who are not yet with us as Uncle Toms.''
He said that, when he arrived in Geneva, the flags of 126 countries
flew outside the United Nations. Now there are 186. In these new
nations, parties across the political divide usually set aside their
differences for the sake of national unity.
Unlike in Britain, with its tradition of the sovereignty of
parliament, in the European tradition, which is also Scots, sovereignty
rested with the people, and parliament was subject to law.
He stressed, however, that he saw devolution only as a possible means
to an end, and only independence would answer Scotland's needs.
''Only independence will release Scotland's resources to create jobs,
training, decent health and education services, and end the obscenity of
deprivation which blights so many of our communities.
''Only independence will enable us to make a decent contribution from
our wealth, like Norway, to the vulnerable and dispossessed of this
world. Only independence will create a true civic society, a community
of equals. Only independence will bring self-confidence, a country at
ease with itself.''
He gave the example of the Flemish Assembly's gradual adoption of
increasing powers.
It started with culture and language in 1970; took on environment,
housing, health, and some employment and economic policies in 1980; took
further economic powers, including foreign trade in 1983; and in 1993,
took international powers, including the right to sign treaties. It is
now looking to extend foreign affairs and take over social security.
He pointed out that if Labour did win power at Westminister and bring
in Home Rule elected by proportional representation then, coming at
mid-term, the SNP could do exceptionally well in such elections. It is
perfectly possible that the SNP could find itself in coalition with
other parties.
What would be the SNP view of that: ''I don't know the answer to these
questions. I suspect the party doesn't know either. I can only suggest,
on European experience, that they require a long, quiet, internal
analysis.''
In that period of internal analysis, Mr Reid, who has been approached
by party activists with a view to becoming a parliamentary candidate
again, is clearly on the side of party leader Alex Salmond, who is
determined not to rule out the use of a devolved assembly as a platform
for pushing on to full independence.
He said past slogans such as Free by '93 were aspirational and
motivational but essentially they appealed to those already converted to
the cause.
''What about the voters?'' he asked. ''What about the fellow
travellers. What, if polls are right, about the 15% to 20% of Scots who
are ahead of Labour on such issues as using part of Scotland's energy
wealth to redress poverty and to fuel industry but behind the SNP in
wanting one loup to freedom.
''Aren't these the key people the SNP should be targeting, people for
whom independence holds no great fears but who may wish to suck it and
see before moving on from a devolved parliament?
''Remember the great Turnbull cartoon in The Herald the week before
the referendum -- a battered rampant lion, tail between his legs,
saying, 'I'm feart'. It is probably the greatest responsibility Alex
Salmond has, to use his undoubted skills to ensure that such a loss of
confidence never happens again.''

THE law should be changed to give better protection to important
marine wildlife areas, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds
said yesterday.
Its call follows an oil pollution incident along the Yorkshire and
Humberside coastline which has already killed or crippled more than a
thousand seabirds.
The pollution was caused by a 28-mile oil slick, believed to have been
dumped by a tanker illegally cleaning out its tanks. It comes at one of
the worst times and places for birds.
It occurred 17 miles off Flamborough Head and the Bempton Cliffs
seabird colony, the largest in England.
Many of the birds are offshore with their recently fledged young
before dispersing to sea for the winter.
RSPB regional officer Andy Bunten said: ''This is precisely the sort
of incident that highlights the need for protected areas for birds at
sea.''
The RSPB pointed out that the birds could not readily fly away from
the slick, even if they were aware of the danger, because many were
moulting wing feathers and could not balance properly.
Almost 1000 birds, mostly guillemots, with smaller numbers of shags,
razorbills, and puffins, have been picked up dead and dying over the
past three days. The toll is expected to keep rising.
Rescue teams yesterday saved 200 oil-soaked birds.
Another 60 were washed up dead, bringing the total number affected so
far to about 1200.
The teams plan to carry on patrolling the beaches around Flamborough
for most of next week.
The RSPB has long pressed for tougher measures to keep such areas
safe, stressing that a swift clean-up after a spillage is not enough.
Usually, once the oil enters the water, the damage is done.
It wants better surveillance and enforcement backed by international
co-operation to end the practice of ships dumping illegally at sea to
avoid the time and cost of proper port disposal.

THE Government is considering proposals to scrap the national railways
timetable -- the industry's bible -- after being faced with unexpected
costs and widespread difficulties in the preparation of this year's
monster 2600-page version.
Copies of ministerial briefing papers leaked to Labour and passed to
The Herald admit that production of the winter 1995 timetable has been
hit by ''teething troubles'' requiring the printing of detailed
corrections.
Ministers have been told the difficulties could further delay the
franchising of passenger services, which is already running more than
two years late.
In addition, Railtrack has told train operators it intends to charge
them a #100,000 annual management fee to cover the cost of preparing the
timetable, which until now British Rail has prepared free of charge.
The question of who will be responsible for preparing a national
timetable once the railways are fragmented into competing companies has
dogged the Government officials preparing privatisation. The Government
had promised that it would continue to be published for the benefit of
travellers and travel agents.
The 2100-page winter 1995 timetable was been found to contain so many
mistakes that Railtrack has had to produce a 400-page supplement, its
second in a month, at a cost of #1m. The first, 91 pages long, failed to
correct all the errors.
Labour transport spokesman Henry McLeish last night demanded a
guarantee from Transport Secretary Sir George Young that the national
timetable in printed form would be preserved. He condemned Railtrack for
attempting to make money from what has until now been a public service.
In a minute of a recent meeting between Railtrack and the Department
of Transport, Railtrack admitted that ''it may no longer be sensible to
publish the timetable in a traditional form''.
Railway sources suggest the timetable chaos is yet another sign of the
uncertainty which surrounds privatisation and proof that the exercise is
throwing up potentially insurmountable complications.

THE father of British tourist Julie Ward, who was tortured and
murdered in a Kenyan game park, told yesterday how he confronted the man
who is said to have dealt her the fatal blow.
The alleged killer refused to look him in the eye during their meeting
on a village green in Kenya, said Mr John Ward.
The businessman also told how he took tremendous risks to meet an
eyewitness who watched his daughter's last moments, and how he was told
that she was tortured before being bludgeoned to death and dismembered.
As a result of the evidence obtained by Mr Ward, with the help of an
opposition Kenyan MP and the United Nations, Scotland Yard has now taken
up the case and officers want to fly to Kenya to question those
implicated in the murder.
Mr Ward first made contact with the eyewitness, Mr Valentine Kodipo,
in 1993 and interviewed him at the home of the Kenyan MP.
There he heard how a policeman -- said to be a known political killer
-- executed Julie Ward with a carved wooden tribal club topped off with
the wheel nut of a tractor.
According to Kodipo's 90-minute tape-recorded statement, the killer
hit 28-year-old Miss Ward on the back of the neck at the base of the
skull after she had suffered prolonged torture.
The killing took place in a remote area of Kenya's Masai Mara game
reserve on a September evening in 1988.
Mr Ward said that, when he returned to the MP's home the following day
to continue the interview, he found that Kenyan police had raided the
house and that Mr Kodipo had fled into hiding.
A year later, Mr Ward was contacted by the United Nations, which had
found Mr Kodipo and listened to his story and was now concerned for his
safety. Mr Ward visited Mr Kodipo again -- and this time took a 19-page
statement from him.
''He spoke in the greatest detail and I spent the next few months
checking out the various details again, which all proved to be
correct,'' Mr Ward said.
''I found the guy who was supposed to have struck the final blow. It
was a very strange meeting, inasmuch as I did not get anything out of
him. I expected him to deny it, or to run away, or to take a swing at
me. But he just stared at his toes. He was just silent.
''I carried this out in the middle of a village green in Kenya and
there was a crowd of schoolchildren who had come to watch what was going
on,'' said Mr Ward, who added that he never once felt the temptation to
take any violent revenge against the man.
Mr Ward said he still had to be convinced that Mr Kodipo's statement
was entirely true.
Everything Mr Kodipo had told him had proved to be correct -- ''which
does not mean that the whole thing is correct'', he said. ''It is not
beyond the realms of possibility that this man, who is a thug, could be
much more involved than he is saying.''
Mr Ward handed his evidence to Kenyan police, who did ''absolutely
nothing''. ''After they had had it for a reasonable length of time, I
then handed the statement to Scotland Yard, who acted almost
immediately,'' he said.
''Kodipo -- who had been in Uganda and who was thought to be in danger
-- had been moved by the UN to a Scandinavian country and he had to
convince that particular government of his story, which he did,'' said
Mr Ward.
According to Mr Kodipo's statement, the group of men who took part in,
or supervised, the torture and execution included three prominent
Kenyans -- a politician, a man who was a close confidant of president
Daniel arap Moi, and the country's most senior policeman.
Mr Ward said that, because these men were so well connected, it was
now up to the British Government to bring pressure on the Kenyan
authorities to start a new investigation.
Mr Ward said: ''The only way this will move forward is if our
Government, with a new Foreign Minister, does something positive to get
the Scotland Yard officers back into Kenya.
''They are very keen to go but it is going to be up to the will of our
Government -- and that has not been evident up to now.
''They would be delighted if the problem were to go away and if no-one
bothered them but it is not going to go away and they are going to be
bothered, so the sooner they grasp the nettle the better.''
A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said: ''We can confirm that two
Metropolitan Police officers from the international and organised crime
branch, accompanied by John Ward, visited a Scandinavian country towards
the end of August to interview the latest witness to the death of Julie
Ward.''
She added: ''The content of the interview is being reviewed and
considered.''

THE Argyle railway line, closed since flooding last December,
officially re-opened for business yesterday.
The first commuter train to use the route for more than nine months
left Dalmuir for Motherwell at 8.14am, marking the completion of
Scotland's biggest yet railway repair job.
The line, which runs from the city's Scottish Exhibition and
Conference Centre to Rutherglen, has been restored at a cost of #3m to
owners Railtrack.
To mark the occasion, a special train left Rutherglen station for
Glasgow carrying guests and school children from the local community,
workers from the project, and rail industry hosts.
Before it departed, the official re-opening ceremony was performed by
Councillor Charlie Gordon, chairman of Strathclyde's roads and transport
committee, Mr Paul Prescott, director of ScotRail, and Mr Alex Lynch,
deputy director of ScotRail.
Mr Gordon said: ''I'm very pleased that we've managed to get the line
operational again and normal service can be resumed. I'm particularly
happy for the people of Rutherglen, who have been without their rail
link for such a long time. It's been a long, hard job and credit is due
to everyone involved.''
Mr Prescott said: ''Our goal throughout this tough job has been to get
the Argyle line back on the rails. We said at the start it was going to
be a difficult job but we've managed to complete it on time and within
our budget. We're just delighted it is completed.''
The Argyle line flooding happened as Glasgow experienced the heaviest
rainfall since records began. The River Kelvin burst its banks in the
city's West End, sending tons of water and debris cascading onto the
line at the SECC station.
At its deepest, the deluge was more than three metres -- at Glasgow
Central Low Level and Argyle Street stations.
More than 110,000 tonnes of debris and water had to be pumped out
before rail engineers could begin to assess the damage. During the
nine-month clear-up operation, engineers ripped out, repaired, and
renewed track, signalling electrics, and stonework.
To celebrate the re-opening, ScotRail and Strathclyde Passenger
Transport Executive have devised introductory discount fares for
journeys on the line. A special ''third off'' offer will be available
for the next fortnight.

AN investigation into claims that machine guns are being stolen from
army stores in Northern Ireland and sold to criminals on mainland
Britain is expected to be stepped up this week.
It follows a report that a cache of military rifles, which the
Ministry of Defence had ordered destroyed, had turned up on the black
market and were in the hands of Home Counties criminals.
Sources at the MoD confirmed that two British soldiers were questioned
in Belfast last week following the theft of guns which had been
dismantled at army bases in the province.
In addition, a former Serviceman and a surplus arms dealer, were
arrested after six machine guns were seized in Lincolnshire and other
automatic weaponry was found in Hampshire.
It is also believed there are currently at least three trials going on
in Northern Ireland involving crimes where it is alleged that
decommissioned army weapons, which have been reassembled, were involved.
The joint investigation is being handled in Northern Ireland by the
Special Investigation Branch, the armed forces' serious investigation
unit, and in Britain by Kent Police.
An MoD spokesman said, ''Kent Police are leading an investigation and
we will co-operate in any way we can with it.''
A spokesman for Kent Police, said: ''We can confirm that we are
involved in carrying out an investigation into this matter but, at this
stage, that is all we can say.''
Security sources are said to be satisfied that there are no terrorist
connections with the trade in stolen military guns.
It is understood the investigation was started when rebuilt weapons
and parts seized in England were traced back to the army in Ulster.
The investigation widening after legitimate gun dealers and arms
collectors told detectives that the illegal network -- believed to be
based in the Kent area -- had also acquired a cache of self-loading
rifles that the Ministry of Defence had ordered to be destroyed.
Detectives are reported to be trying to trace up to 100 other weapons
which may have been built using parts stolen in Northern Ireland.

<HEADLINE>Fresh allegations on judge</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>976208139</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Lord Chancellor was under renewed pressure last night to act on
fresh reports alleging that Judge Anthony Thornton QC took drugs during
sex sessions with prostitutes.
Lord Mackay of Clashfern, the country's most senior judicial figure,
accepted assurances from Judge Thornton last week that he had not taken
illegal drugs and was unaware that the two prostitutes involved had
criminal records.
However, pictures taken from a video, published in today's News of the
World, allegedly show the 48-year-old Old Etonian judge indulging in
drugs and sex romps.
Conservative MP Peter Butler, a member of the Commons home affairs
select committee and a solicitor, said: ''If the judge turns out to have
lied to the Lord Chancellor, then he should clearly resign straight
away.''
Mr Butler, the member for Milton Keynes North East, told BBC Radio 4's
The World This Weekend: ''I think the Lord Chancellor took the word of
the judge which may yet turn out to be right, a repeated allegation by
the News of the World does not disprove the word of the judge.
''If it turns out to be right, then the Lord Chancellor made the
correct decision. If it turns out to be wrong, then the responsibility
lies with Judge Thornton.''
After the claims were first made by the newspaper last Sunday, the
judge, who sits as a Referee in the High Court in London, was summoned
before the Lord Chancellor. Lord Mackay accepted his assurances and said
he could keep his job.
The NoW claims that its video evidence was taken on the night of
September 14 at the flat of one of the prostitutes. It claims that the
pictures show the judge taking a hand-rolled joint, allegedly containing
a cocktail of cannabis and cocaine, from one of the prostitutes and
sucking wine off one of the women's toes.
Neither Judge Thornton nor his solicitors was available for comment
today. The Lord Chancellor is currently attending the Conference of
Appelate Judges and Commonwealth Chief Judges in Ottawa, Canada, and is
not due back in the UK until Monday, October 2.
A spokesman for his office in London said that Lord Mackay's statement
of last week ''still stands''. He said, however, that the Lord
Chancellor ''will be informed'' of the latest allegations.

TRADERS in an Irish town are counting the cost of having a local
tourism office that does not exist.
Drivers approaching Newbridge, County Kildare, are left in no doubt
where the office can be found. Numerous road signs point towards it and
maps show it close to a bridge over a river running through the town.
Arrival, though, brings disappointment -- the tourism office is
nowhere to be found. The signs went up before it was built and
construction has been further delayed.
Town council chairman John O'Neill said: ''The absence of the office
had a definite effect on tourist returns this year. A lot of people
approached me looking for the bureau and I had to tell them there wasn't
one.''

A LABOUR MP has called on the Government to help schools to tackle the
problem of the escalating number of exclusions for bad behaviour.
Mr Brian Donohoe, the MP for Cunninghame South, yesterday published
the results of a survey which showed that the number of suspensions or
expulsions of pupils for unruly behaviour had increased by more than
100% in some regions in recent years.
The figures, described as ''horrendous'' by Mr Donohoe, were greeted
with surprise by the Head Teachers Association of Scotland, whose
secretary, Mr Jim McNair, conceded that bad behaviour by pupils was a
constant problem. But he said there had been no significant increase in
concern about the issue among the association's members.
Mr Donohoe's survey of the number of exclusions of pupils in
Scotland's regional education authorities showed that:
* There was a total of 25,540 exclusions of pupils from Scottish
schools in the 1992/93 session, the year for which the most complete
figures are available.
* The number of exclusions increased by 137% in the Borders since
1992/93, 119% in Highland since 1990/91, 63% in Grampian since 1990/91,
49% in Fife since 1987/88, 48% in Tayside since 190/91, 38% in Dumfries
and Galloway since 1990/91, and 27% in Central region since 1989/90. The
length of the period to which each figure applied varied from region to
region.
* There was an increase in the number of exclusions in Strathclyde,
Scotland's largest education authority, of more than 3% from 15,639 in
1986/87 to 16,177 in 1994/95 (although the exclusion policy was altered
after a review in the 1993/94 session).
* The number of exclusions in Lothian increased by 4% from 2434 in
1989/90 to 2541 in 1993/94.
Mr Donohoe forecast that the problem would continue to worsen unless
the matter was addressed in a different fashion.
''Every education authority has its own policy for dealing with the
problem but it is clear that dealing with the disruptive behaviour of
Scottish pupils is tying up more time and resources.
''There are differences between the education authorities' policies in
relation to exclusion and those distinctions will get worse when the
number of education authorities trebles because of local government
reform next April.''
Mr Donohoe also claimed that many schools regarded exclusions as
''easy options'', but said lack of resources to deal with the problem
was a factor and did not blame the schools.
He said the Scottish Office should review current practices in the
matter of exclusions and issue revised information to the new councils
to allow standardisation of procedures.
Mr McNair said of the figures :''I think what may have been happening
is that a number of authorities may have been insisting that procedures
be formalised a bit more, so that instead of a child informally being
sent home this is formalised as an exclusion.''
A spokesman for the Scottish Office said: ''Under the Parent's
Charter, local authorities have been required to collect information on
a regular basis and this will be published at the end of the year.
Research is under way to look at best practice. This will be concluded
next year and results made available.''

AN elderly woman hillwalker was injured by a boulder which came
crashing down a hillside Skye yesterday afternoon.
The incident happened around 1.30pm when Mrs Alma Tanner, 63, from
Birmingham, was out with her husband on the Quirang, at the north end of
the island. The woman was hit on the leg near the base of the Needle
pinnacle.
Skye mountain rescue team was called out and the coastguard Sea King
helicopter was scrambled from Stornoway, where she was detained in
hospital last night.
The Quirang is only 1779ft high but it is composed of soft basalt
lavas, and the whole area is unstable.
The boulder which struck the woman, who is thought to be in her 60s,
may have been dislodged by the rain and gales, or loosened by a climber
negotiating the boulder-strewn scree slope.
Police were withholding the injured woman's name until relatives have
been informed.
It is known that her injuries are not life threatening and she may
have a broken leg.

PARTNERSHIPS between companies, their customers, and suppliers add
considerably to Britain's industrial competitiveness. This is the
conclusion of a survey carried out for Partnership Sourcing, a non
profit-making company set up by the Confederation of British Industry
and Department of Trade and Industry.
The survey, undertaken by international management consultants Arthur
D Little, comes down strongly against sceptics who say that although
companies claim they have implemented partnerships, few of them are
''real'', with companies not actually making any changes in behaviour
towards their suppliers or any long-term commitment.
A list of case histories, including IBM UK, Nissan Motor Manufacturing
UK, Kodak, andLaing Homes does not appear to bear this out.
More than 80% of respondents agreed that ''partnership sourcing will
have a crucial impact on competitiveness''. More than 90% of companies
involved rated their partnership a success. The survey covered around
400 British companies and elicited a high response.
Awareness of partnership sourcing has grown amongst British companies
over the past four years, from 71% in 1991 to 97% in 1995.
More than 90% of the companies in the survey now know and understand
the concept of partnership sourcing and 74% of them are now working in
buyer-supplier partnerships, an increase from 45% in 1991. Of these, 75%
have been operating for more than two years.
Those companies which have moved beyond the initial problems of
setting up these agreements are now benefiting. The three greatest
benefits listed are reduced costs, taking advantage of a partner's
expertise, and higher quality of products and service.
Commenting on the survey, Mr David Brown, European director of Arthur
D Little, said: ''Companies which have not yet taken the plunge into
partnerships need to take action soon to avoid losing their competitive
edge.
''Companies need to prepare their organisations for the implementation
of partnerships and the survey has shown there is an increasing body of
experience among British industry on which they can draw.''

LABOUR leader Tony Blair yesterday redoubled his efforts to win over
the City and the business community by offering the prospect of tax cuts
and tough action against inflation.
He committed a Labour government to observing the Conservatives'
target of keeping inflation under 2.5%, and said it was no longer
acceptable to take risks with the economy.
In a clear signal to the City that he would be prepared to intervene
in interest rates to keep inflation down, Mr Blair said Labour would
match the Government's target: ''It certainly won't be less tough than
that,'' he said.
''The idea that you can run a stable macro-economic framework and take
risks with inflation has gone. You wouldn't want to pursue faster growth
at the cost of higher inflation spiralling out of control,'' he said.
Mr Blair, campaigning to sell New Labour to business and industry,
also suggested that he would cut taxes if the opportunity arose.
He confirmed that Labour would introduce a ''windfall tax'' on the
profits of the privatised utilities to help fund jobs and investment
without increasing public borrowing.
The new Utilities Monopoly Levy, expected to be unveiled today by
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown, is designed to raise about #3000m from
the up to #10bn some City analysts suggest could be pared from the
profits of the gas, electricity, and water companies.
Yesterday Mr Brown confirmed that proposals for the levy would be
included in the party's election manifesto. ''The case for a windfall
levy is now firmly established and something that Labour will be
implementing,'' he said.
The appeal of such a tax, which would help appease the public's anger
at profits and boardroom pay, might first be tapped by the Tories. It
was reported yesterday that Chancellor Kenneth Clarke was considering a
similar scheme.
He is said to be under pressure to steal Labour's thunder by announcing
a windfall tax in his November Budget. The move would free the
Government to deliver a pre-election tax cut. However the Treasury
refused to comment on possible Budget measures.
Mr Blair signalled a tax-cutting Labour government in the Independent
on Sunday newspaper: ''If you can get taxes down for the ordinary
family, consistent with the proper running of the economy and with
strong public services, who on earth could dispute that?''
He added: ''This country has had a 7p in the standard rate tax rise.
The Tories have put more tax on the average family than any government
has done. The last thing they want to hear is that a Labour government
is going to come in and make them even higher.''
On inflation, he told the BBC's Money Programme that Labour would
avoid interest rate decisions based on ''short-term political
considerations'' by increasing the transparency of relations between the
Treasury and the Bank of England.
However, Mr Blair insisted the economy needed long-term attention. ''I
don't believe that it is possible to transform this country's economy
overnight.''
Mr Adair Turner, director-general of the Confederation of British
Industry, believed businessmen were not confident of Mr Blair's ability
to deliver.
He said: ''What does concern business at the moment is whether one can
believe that a Labour Party, if it was in power, would actually be able
to deliver some of the statements that it's been making in terms of
policy, in terms of the pressure that it would come under from within
government, from the markets and from its own back benchers.''
Mr Blair rejected the claim that a minimum wage would create
unemployment. ''On the contrary, it means that employers can compete on
a sensible basis knowing they can't undercut each other with very, very
low levels of pay.''
He said Labour had ''no plans'' to rejoin the European Exchange Rate
Mechanism. Mr Blair said: ''I think there has been too much emphasis on
short-term devaluation leading to long-term economic success.''

HOME Secretary Michael Howard yesterday ruled out the possibility of
three million Hong Kong residents coming to live in Britain.
Asked on GMTV whether Britain should open its doors to the people of
Hong Kong, as advocated by the colony's Governor Chris Patten, he said:
''There is no question of our doing that.
''These matters were extensively discussed and debated in 1990 before
Parliament. Firm decisions were reached then.
''We would make available the possibility of coming to this country to
50,000 heads of families. That was the decision reached then. We don't
intend to change it.''
He added: ''There is no question of giving three million people in
Hong Kong the right to live in this country.''
Mr Howard's statement will calm angry Tory MPs who have warned that
immigration levels were high enough and vowed to fight any such plan.
Under the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1990, around 50,000
residents of the colony were given the right to a full British passport.
The Act was passed after the Tiananmen Square massacre of June 1989,
which sent panic waves through the colony.
However, Mr Patten, a former Cabinet Minister, said Britain should
give right of abode to the 3.3 million Hong Kong people holding British
Dependent Territories passports.
He denied this would prompt an immediate influx of immigrants.
Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw said: ''Mr Patten's statement must
raise questions about his own confidence in the stability of the
arrangements he has put in place for after 1997.
''As the then Shadow Home Secretary Roy Hattersley made clear at the
time, Labour was never convinced that it was appropriate or practical to
offer automatic admission to three million Hong Kong British overseas
citizens.
''Our position has not changed but we need to know whether the
Government's position has changed given Mr Patten's close links with
it.''
Tory David Wilshire, whose Spelthorne constituency includes part of
London's Heathrow airport, said he was writing to Mr John Major in
protest.
''It's not acceptable to the British people to let in one more, let
alone three million.
''My response and the response of my constituents is that this country
is full up.
''Even with the Government's restrictions, we still have too many
immigrants and the last thing we want is even more,'' he said.
Passport campaigners in Hong Kong dismissed Mr Patten's words as
politicking, and called for action rather than words.
Colony-based war veteran Jack Edwards, who has fought for 29 war
widows and the wives of ex-servicemen to be given the full right of
abode in Britain, said Mr Patten ought to think about their claims
before making statements about handing out an extra three million
passports.
''I was boiling with rage when I heard this,'' he said.
''It's just Patten playing bloody politics. He knows full well the
British Government won't give 3.5 million passports.''
Baroness Lydia Dunn, one of Hong Kong's most senior political figures
who, until recently, was a member of both the legislative and the
executive councils, urged the Government to think again.
''This issue will not go away,'' she said.
''This is a moral issue. You can't just tell over three million people
who were born on British soil, who have sworn allegiance to the Queen,
that we are giving you a piece of paper which we call a British passport
but it gives you no right of abode in Britain.''

<TEXT>
TOUGH new exhaust emission checks come into force today, yet 60% of
motorists do not know the checks are already part of the test, according
to the RAC.
The new MoT requirements mean that the carbon monoxide content of
older petrol engined cars must be cut by 25% -- from 6% to 4.5%, and
from 4.5% to 3.5% for newer cars.
Welcoming the move, introduced a year early, the RAC's head of policy,
Mr Jeremy Vanke, said: ''The RAC has consistently argued for the
tightening of MoT emission standards and emissions enforcement at the
roadside.
''One in five vehicles fail the MoT because of emission levels but 60%
of motorists don't know that emission tests are already part of the
test.
''The message that regular maintenance and servicing can cut emission
levels and save motorists money is still not getting through,'' he
added.
The AA's chief engineer, Mr David Lang, said that although vehicles
pass the MoT test, there is no guarantee they will continue to meet
emission standards throughout the year.
Free testing during the summer found that 13% of vehicles had exhaust
emissions above present limits -- despite holding MoT certificates.

PRINCE Charles Edward Stuart's famous victory of 1745 at Prestonpans
lasted less than 15 minutes. A colourful but bloodless re-enactment of
the battle in the East Lothian countryside at the weekend took just a
little bit longer.
Thousands of spectators attended a two-day spectacular organised by
East Lothian District Council to commemorate the 250th anniversary of
the Jacobite Rebellion.
The re-enactment, in which around 500 members of the Earl of Louden's
Regiment of Foot and Colonel Nicholas Devereux's Regiment donned the
costumes of Highlander and Redcoat, took place close to the original
battle site at Meadowmill.
The spectators were also given the opportunity to see the troops in
their ''living history'' encampments and watch them drill before taking
up the fight.

AROUND 300 people yesterday took part in a charity walk across the
Forth Road Bridge to raise money to fight heart disease in Scotland.
Scots athlete Yvonne Murray along with Hearts footballer Gary Mackay
joined the walk, which was organised by the British Heart Foundation and
sponsored for the first time by Warburton's, a leading independent
family baking company.
The event was part of a walkathon for National Bread Week, which aims
to promote bread as a healthy and essential part of diet. Nutritionists
recommend people to eat at least six slices of bread daily because it is
low-fat food, high in protein and carbohydrate, and a rich source of
vitamins and important minerals.

THE man who arranged for Will Carling to visit his sports clinic on
Friday said yesterday: ''Will could not possibly have known the Princess
of Wales was there.''
Speaking for the first time about the England rugby captain's
physiotherapy appointment, the co-owner of the clinic, Mr Alan Watson,
added: ''I am the reason why he visited the club.''
Mr Watson, 40, who has been Carling's physiotherapist for the last
five years, spoke in the wake of the latest newspaper allegations that
Carling and the princess met at the West London clinic on Friday
morning.
He said: ''I can say almost certainly that Will would have been
totally unaware of the princess being in the building.
''I treated him for half an hour and we did not talk about anything
except the injury and rugby. The name Princess Diana was never
mentioned.
''We did not discuss her because it is a non-issue. We are trying to
get him fit for the South African game.
''I know for certain there was no meeting. From the timings of him
entering and leaving the building he had to have come straight to my
room and left straight afterwards.''
He said he arranged Carling's appointment on Thursday and left a
message on his telephone answering machine at the home Carling shares
with his wife Julia, 30.
He informed Carling that in a very tight schedule his only opportunity
to treat him was the following morning from 8.45am to 9.15am.

ENVIRONMENTAL groups such as Friends of the Earth will be excluded
from the consultation process over plans to re-license nuclear power
stations ahead of the Government's privatisation programme, it has been
claimed.
Labour's trade and industry spokesman, Mr Brian Wilson, described the
exclusion as ''utterly unsatisfactory'' and claimed it was further
evidence that Government Ministers were prepared to risk no disruption
in their politically-driven timetable.
Friends of the Earth Scotland said it was ''disappointing but not
surprising''.
Mr Wilson, said the decision had been confirmed in a letter received
from Energy Minister Richard Page, adding: ''Government Ministers are
more concerned about funding tax cuts than public confidence in the
nuclear industry.''
Mr Kevin Dunnion, FoE Scotland director, said: ''I am sure we would
make a well informed but critical contribution if we had the
opportunity.''
The letter made it clear that the statutory consultation process in
advance of privatisation, involving a proposed merger of sorts between
Scottish Nuclear and English-based Nuclear Electric, would be restricted
to ''public bodies''.
Mr Wilson, claimed that major changes in the safety management of
nuclear sites were being rushed through and argued that it was essential
to conduct a full scrutiny.
Meanwhile, concern over the timescale for privatisation was expressed
by Dr Mike Weightman, HM superintending inspector of the Nuclear
Installations Inspectorate who, in this month's Nuclear Engineering
International, said ''a year to 15 months seems a short time''.
However, Dr Sam Herbison, chief inspector of NII, said: ''We have
adequate time and resources to meet our programme.''

A TEENAGE gunman beat three members of his family to death in France
at the weekend then went on a shooting rampage, killing eight more
people before committing suicide.
Besides the dead, seven people were seriously wounded.
Eric Borel, 17, began firing at passers-by at random with a .22 rifle
just after daybreak yesterday in Cuers, a town of about 7000 people.
On Saturday, he had beaten to death his stepfather, his mother, and
his 11-year-old brother, using a hammer and a baseball bat.
Their killings in the village of Sollies-Pont were not immediately
discovered, and were not linked to the shootings in Cuers until several
hours later.
Cuers and Sollies-Pont are a few kilometres apart, just outside the
Mediterranean port of Toulon.
Police had no immediate theory on a motive for the killings.
A resident watching from a doorway said he first thought the youth was
setting off fireworks, then that he was shooting at pigeons.
''Then we saw a man with a wounded leg. The killer had a peaceful
look, calmly reloading his rifle. He headed toward city hall while
continuing to fire, then he turned around to finish off the man he had
wounded in the leg.''
''He fired at everything that moved,'' said another witness.
Three people who were seriously wounded were taken by helicopter to
hospitals in Toulon and Marseilles. Others were treated in Hyeres and an
emergency medical station set up in the Cuers soccer stadium.
Neighbours in Sollies-Pont, where Borel and his family lived,
described him as a quiet boy.
He was a pupil at a secondary school in Toulon. He recently lost his
father.
Neighbours knew little about him but said he loved to work in the
family garden. ''He never even said 'hello','' said a boy who lived
nearby. --Reuter.

Formentor
SCOTLAND stands to lose all of its European Union economic support
when the community is enlarged to include the former communist countries
of Eastern Europe.
After the Majorca EU summit, where Mr John Major costed enlargement at
#29bn a year unless vast savings are made, the community is now firmly
committed to beginning enlargement negotiations with the first four
Eastern countries as well as the Commonwealth states of Cyprus and
Malta.
Under existing arrangements the Scottish Highlands and Islands,
Northern Ireland, and Merseyside all receive so-called Objective 1
funding from the European Commission. This will account for about #300m
for the Highlands and Islands until the end of the century and about
#1000m each for Ulster and Merseyside where the populations are much
greater.
To that must be added approximately #500m in Objective 2 funding for
areas where heavy industry has disappeared -- mainly Strathclyde and
parts of east central Scotland -- as well as help worth tens of millions
for needy rural areas and fishing communities.
All of these sums come from the structural funds of the EU which are
designed to assist areas most in need. Almost all of the money would
have to be switched to Eastern Europe, where poverty exists on a scale
unknown even in the poorest parts of the EU.
Mr Major is one of the EU's keenest supporters of enlargement. He told
reporters over the weekend of his vision of a ''Europe, whole and
free'', adapting to what he termed the ''arc of instability'' now
stretching from the Baltic to the Balkans after the collapse of
communism.
However, he is also one of the keenest critics of the EU's notorious
Common Agricultural Policy, which accounts for 50% of the #64,000m
annual budget.
By the Prime Minister's calculations -- which he presented in detail
to other government heads at the Formentor meeting -- the cost of
enlargement eastwards to take in Poland, Hungary, the Czech republic,
and Slovakia would be #12,000m on CAP and #17,000m on structural
funding.
Mr Major believes the EU has been too slow to realise the enormity of
the sums involved. After the summit, he said of his talks with other
leaders whom he accused of being out of touch with ordinary Europeans:
''They were open, free, and frank.'' He added with a smile: ''They were
not bland.''
The two-day brainstorming session left the EU determined to press
ahead with the details of enlargement so that the early accession of
vulnerable Eastern states could boost European security and stability.
Mr Major also made a forceful contribution to the debate on economic
and monetary union when he repeated his doubts about the whole concept
of a single European currency.
In particular, he questioned the ability of weaker currencies to
survive in the European Monetary System after the strongest had formed a
single currency. Along with his support for German claims that
conditions for currencies joining a single currency are not tough
enough, Mr Major will be in the good books of his party's Euro-doubters
as the annual conference approaches.
''If a majority of the 15 member states is able to move ahead with a
single currency on schedule I would be very surprised,'' Mr Major told
reporters. ''In fact, I would be absolutely dumbfounded.''
After Majorca, Mr Major appears to have executed a complete turnaround
from his statement at the 1992 Edinburgh summit when he said there would
be no two-speed economic Europe, no twin-track to monetary union, and no
inner circle of stronger currencies.

A REPORT has been sent to the procurator-fiscal after a disabled man
was found dead by relatives visiting him in Monklands Hospital in
Lanarkshire.
Celebral palsy sufferer Alan Deakin, 19, from Airdrie, was admitted to
hospital a fortnight ago but was reportedly found dead by his mother
Agnes Deakin last Monday.
Last night, a spokesman for Monklands Hospital confirmed that a report
had been sent to the procurator fiscal on Thursday but said it was
inappropriate to comment further. ''The consultant caring for Alan
Deakin made a routine referral to the procurator-fiscal and we await the
outcome of his investigations,'' he said.
However, he added that a full statement on the events surrounding the
young man's death would be made by the hospital tomorrow.

<HEADLINE>Gulf troops' children may be victims of mustard gas</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>976208154</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
EXPOSURE to mustard gas during the Gulf war could be a cause of birth
defects among babies born to Allied troops, according to a television
investigation to be broadcast tonight.
One expert tells BBC1's Panorama that servicemen who fought in 1991
were exposed to chemicals on the ground and to nerve agents released
because of Allied bombing of Iraqi weapons installations.
Mr James Tuite III, a special adviser on chemical weapons to a recent
Senate committee hearing, said: ''We know that mustard gas was detected
repeatedly in Kuwait and found in bunkers, not just detected in the air.
''Chemical agents were detected virtually everywhere throughout the
theatre during the war, and by British, American, Czech, and French
troops.''
He claimed that chemical nerve agents were detected ''within hours''
of the air war starting on January 17, 1991.
''We know of an incident that's become rather famous now. On January
19, near the port of Jabaal, at about 3.30 in the morning, some
explosions were heard and very shortly after that the British reported
positive readings with their M9 paper, which is chemically reactive
paper.
''They were indications of the presence of mustard agent,'' he added.
Dr John Savage, who runs the Chromosome Damage Group at the Medical
Research Council's radiobiology unit at Didcot, Oxfordshire, told
Panorama: ''Mustard gas is a very dangerous compound. It produces an
enormous amount of DNA in chromosomes and if it is transmitted they will
get into the sex cells and go onto the offspring.''
Labour MP Bruce George (Walsall South), chairman of the Select
Committee on Gulf War Syndrome, said the Ministry of Defence has failed
to act on evidence.
''It may take time. It will take money but we owe it to our serving
men and women to find out what the cause of their suffering is,'' he
said.
Hundreds of servicemen returning from the Gulf have complained of a
range of symptoms, including sickness, kidney disorders, chest
infections, black-outs, hair loss, leukaemia, bleeding gums, and
depression.
Panorama highlights three British families who believe service in the
Gulf has caused rare defects in their children.
One, Mr Mark Dunthorne and his wife Jane, of Epsom, Surrey, have a son
Vincent born with a heart murmur.
Mrs Dunthorne says: ''My husband signed a form to be in the RAF. But
he's in the RAF and I'm not, and neither is Vincent.
''We are civilians and if anything that they've done to Mark has
affected us in any way, then they really should be responsible for
that.''
A spokeswoman for the MoD said yesterday: ''We are not saying anything
until we have seen the programme. We will be revising our thoughts
then.''

A CHILD'S life has been saved by the world's smallest pacemaker.
Scott MacIver, too small at 18 months to be fitted with a conventional
pacemaker, had one the size of a 50p piece implanted at the Royal
Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow.
The procedure was carried out after Scott's heartbeat rate fell by a
third -- from 90 beats to 60 beats per minute -- and doctors feared he
would die.
An emergency call was put out to the makers, St Jude's Medical in
Birmingham.
The mini-pacemaker was flown to Glasgow Airport then had a police
escort to Yorkhill Hospital.
Cardiologists at the hospital's pioneering catheter lab managed to
insert the pacemaker in the infant's chest in a two-hour procedure. It
is 40% lighter and smaller than the normal one used for children.
Scott had already survived two lots of surgery after being born with a
valve defect and a hole in the heart. They were diagnosed after he
became breathless only a few days after coming home from maternity
hospital.
His parents, Caroline, 27, and Tony MacIver, 26, of Airdrie,
Lanarkshire, said: ''We rushed him to casualty at Monklands Hospital
where the paediatrician immediately saw the urgency and called a heart
specialist from Yorkhill.
''They then asked if we had considered having him christened and our
Baptist minister, the Rev Tom Glover, was called in to dedicate Scott.''
This is the Baptist term for christening.
The parents said they were devastated. ''We felt our world had caved
in and we were about to lose our baby son.
''You can hardly speak, you are so stunned and so you just pray that
your child survives.''
At Yorkhill, consultant cardiac surgeon Morgan Jamieson repaired the
leaking mitral valve. But the site of the surgery was also the area of
the pacemaking part of the heart and surgeons knew a pacemaker would be
needed within a few months as he started to grow and develop.
''Without that first surgery he would have died within a few days of
birth,'' said cardiac senior registrar Karen McLeod. ''It was a question
of not being able to avoid causing some damage during the life-saving
surgery.
''But the problem with babies like Scott is that they are very small
for conventional pacemakers. There is just not enough baby for the size
of the usual pacemaker.''
A temporary one was fitted outside Scott's chest but scar tissue
interfered with its connection to the heart, and when his heart rate
fell by a third, the latest emergency was under way.
Dr McLeod continued: ''He improved dramatically and was out within a
week. Now five weeks later we are delighted with his progress.''
Mrs MacIver expressed the family's feelings. ''The whole situation was
so unreal, as though it were happening to someone else and we were
looking on. On reflection, I suppose that was our way of coping at the
time.''
Her husband said: ''It is nothing short of a miracle. Scott is now a
healthy happy child. Looking back I can remember Mr Jamieson telling me
that they would try their best but Scott might not survive.''
Scott's grandmother, Mrs Rosilyn MacIver, has coaxed her employers and
colleagues at Motorola in Bathgate to raise more than #7000 for
Yorkhill's new catheter lab.
''It is only when you are pitched into such a terrible situation where
your grandchild's life in at risk that you realise how vital the
catheter lab's work is,'' she said.

A DEER stalker has drowned as he crossed a rope bridge spanning the
swollen waters of a remote Highland river.
Mr David Major, 18, slipped and became entangled in the ropes. He was
left hanging upside down after his rucksack caught in the ropes, with
one of them round his neck.
As he struggled to free himself, the bridge sagged, leaving his body
dangling in the river which had become a torrent after flash floods
widened the Abhainn Dearg (Red River) to 100ft, more than fives times
its normal width.
Police and coastguards made a 45-mile dash from Kyle to the accident
scene at Ceann Loch Damph in Wester Ross but were unable to reach Mr
Major, from Chester, as heavy rain and winds gusting to 100mph swept the
area.
The search and rescue helicopter at Stornoway was scrambled but was
forced to stand down because of the weather conditions.
Mr Major's body was recovered by police divers early yesterday
morning, 10 hours after the alarm had been raised and the force of the
river flow had dropped.
He had taken time out from his studies to travel and had been working
on Lochcarron Estate, Kinlochdamph, for three days assisting with the
annual deer cull.
He had left the estate in the morning with the deer stalking party and
had already crossed the rope bridge. At lunch time, the weather worsened
and, at 4pm, Mr Major was instructed by radio to return to base. The
accident happened as he made his way off the hills.
The alarm was raised when he failed to return to the rendevous point
and other members of the party found him suspended in the water. When
police, coastguards, and a local doctor arrived at the scene they could
not reach him because the river was in full flood.
Estate owner, former shipping magnate Mark Pattinson said: ''David was
a nice lad with lots of initiative and go.'' He added that is was the
first serious accident in 25 years of deer culling on the estate.
Mr Major was found by Mr Pattinson's son John, 29, who had known him
for several years. He said yesterday: ''We are all terribly shocked and
his family are devastated.
''It was a chance in a million. If he had fallen clear of the bridge
and been free in the river he would probably have survived.''
Mr Major was working as a pony boy on the estate which involved
bringing dead deer off the hill. His pony was found tethered to a tree
near the single-strand rope bridge which had been built under Army
supervision six years ago by a group of young people taking part in the
Duke of Edinburgh award scheme.
Yesterday, detectives and officials of the Health and Safety Executive
examined the accident scene and reports will be sent to the procurator
fiscal at Dingwall.
Mr Major was the oldest of three children and had a brother Jonathan
and a sister Rachel. The family live about five miles outside Chester.
Yesterday, his father Jonathan was making the journey north.
In another mountain incident, four teenage members of the Boys
Brigade, from Bearsden, were helped off Ben Lomond following a search by
mountain rescue and dog search teams
The boys, aged 14 to 19, all members of the 4th Bearsden Boys Brigade
Company, had taken shelter for the night after darkness fell.
They had set off on Saturday morning from Milarrochy Bay on Loch
Lomondside to circumnavigate Ben Lomond and were found yesterday on
their planned route by members of the Central Scotland Police and Lomond
Mountain rescue teams who were being assisted by the Southern Scotland
Search and Rescue Dog Association.

THE 32-year-old man who fooled pupils and staff at Bearsden Academy
into believing he was a 17-year-old called Brandon Lee was under siege
from the media yesterday at his home in Bearsden.
Mr Brian MacKinnon flew back from London to Glasgow on Saturday
evening but as he was coming out of a taxi, he was seen by journalists
who had been staking out his home since the story of his masquerade was
first revealed.
Since then, newspaper, radio and television reporters, photographers,
and cameramen have been sitting outside his house waiting for him to
explain why he pretended to be 15 years younger than he really was,
resat his Highers, and entered Dundee University as a medical student.
As the press pack's cars threatened to clog the narrow roads near Mr
MacKinnon's house, his neighbours appeared both bemused and angry that
their quiet neighbourhood should have become the camping ground of up to
30 journalists.
One after the other, they drove past Mr MacKinnon's house, counted the
assembled media, and shook their heads in disbelief.

A WOMAN died and six other people were injured on the A92 Kirkcaldy to
Dundee road yesterday, bringing a call for urgent action on safety
improvements by Labour MP Henry McLeish, the Shadow transport spokesman.
It is thought that the 64-year-old woman died from a heart attack in
an ambulance as she was was being taken to Kirkcaldy's Victoria Hospital
with serious injuries.
Six survivors of the crash were taken to the same hospital suffering
from a variety of injuries. Their conditions are not yet known.
The accident, which closed the busy main road for over two hours,
happened on the outskirts of Glenrothes between Cadham village and
Balfarg.
Two cars, a Renault and a Vauxhall Astra, collided head-on, trapping
the unaccompanied male driver of the Astra in the wreckage. Firefighters
had to be called out to cut him free.
The Renault burst into flames seconds after its six occupants
clambered to safety.
Mr McLeish, the MP for Central Fife, has been campaigning for several
years for improvements to the single-carriage stretch which links dual
carriageways and has two junctions.
He accused the Government of ''playing politics with peoples' lives'',
and went on: ''I will be demanding an urgent meeting with the Roads
Minister, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton.
''The Government seem to be talking about temporary improvements,
including a roundabout, but that is not good enough. I want the section
of road between Glenrothes and Balfarg converted to dual carriageway to
avoid more tragedies.''
He claimed that recent measures aimed at improving road safety had
made matters worse, he said the ''death trap'' road was one of the worst
blackspots in Scotland.
Fife Police are appealing for witnesses to the accident.

THE bitter relationship between Scotland's political rivals plunged to
a new low yesterday, with accusations over bomb scares and smears.
The SNP claimed Labour had maximised publicity on a hoax letter bomb
at its headquarters in Glasgow as part of a running smear campaign and
SNP leader Alex Salmond spoke of bomb scares at his own party's
conference.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson, in a letter to The Herald
today, again links such HQ incidents by extremists to the refusal of the
SNP leadership to disown intemperate language by senior party figures.
Last week, on the eve of the SNP's annual conference opening in Perth,
a Labour Party memo was leaked making this linkage. In spite of an
outraged response, including calls for his resignation, Mr Robertson
shows no sign of backing off.
His letter today refers to the bomb hoax at Keir Hardie House on
Saturday, which coincided with the final day of the SNP conference,
speaking of ''the recent upsurge in extreme nationalist violence,
including the death threat this weekend''.
He claims: ''The use of heavily loaded and emotive language by
respectable democratic politicians in the SNP will, whether they like it
or not, fuel the fevered fires of those who want separation by any
means.''
The fact that his conference had started and finished on a similar
ugly note enraged Mr Salmond yesterday. He said: ''At our conference in
Perth last week, we had two bomb scares, on Thursday and Friday. I have
no doubt that these were instigated by the leaking of George Robertson's
internal memo to the press last week.
''We discussed it with Tayside Police and carried out checks in
accordance with normal procedure. It was of particular concern because
there was a Sinn Fein councillor attending a fringe meeting. I didn't go
around holding press conferences and inciting more of this sort of
thing.
''What we don't do when there are incidents like that is run straight
to our word processor as George Robertson has done. Is it now currency
after every threat to call a press conference?
''He lost the debate with me six months ago and has since moved into
the political gutter with tactics of smears and guilt by association,
which I am no longer prepared to tolerate as part of the political
process in Scotland.''
Mr Robertson retorted with a demand that Mr Salmond come off the fence
and disown the use of emotive phrases such as traitor, quisling, and
Uncle Tom.
Strathclyde Police confirmed they were summoned to the Labour offices
on Saturday and their bomb squad officers examined a padded envelope,
which turned out to be an elaborate hoax.
Sunday newspapers -- who were already on the scene in time to
photograph bomb squad officers arriving -- reported that it was
addressed to Mr Robertson, bore a Glasgow postmark, and contained part
of an SNP leaflet and a note saying: ''Stop making trouble George, or
you're dead.''
A claim was later made to one newspaper from the Scottish National
Liberation Army but this would be surprising if there was SNP material
in the envelope: this terror organisation hates the party, regarding it,
ironically, as an ''Uncle Tom'' organisation.
On the question of the language used in political debate, Mr Salmond
said: ''Rough things are said in politics. Only recently, Gordon Brown
wrote in a newspaper article about Tory traitors. Kim Howells equated
nationalism with fascism and talked about Balkanisation. Do we have to
repudiate every use of strong language? Churchill likened Labour to the
Gestapo, Bevan called the Tories vermin.
''This holier than thou hypocrisy is reducing the debate more than
anything else because it is a calculated campaign to smear and abuse
us.''
He added: ''Let him tell us straight who leaked that internal memo
last week, an act that was clearly designed to disrupt the start of our
conference. When he gives an honest answer to that, people will be able
to judge whether to take this man seriously as a politician.''
However, in another letter to The Herald today, Labour's Cumbernauld
and Kilsyth MP, Mr Norman Hogg, writes that the Perth conference proves
once more that ''Nationalism is a thoroughly unpleasant and dangerous
development in Scottish public life'' because of how it makes us ''view
current affairs and relationships with other people''.

ISRAEL and the Palestine Liberation Organisation yesterday signed a
historic agreement, expanding Palestinian rule in the West Bank. It
signalled an end to Israel's 28-year-old occupation.
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres called the last eight days of
talks ''a tremendous attempt to bring people who were born in the same
cradle and that were fighting on the same front to agree on a new
future.''
US President Bill Clinton said: ''It's a big step forward ending a
long, long state of siege in the Middle East.'' He said he would host a
signing ceremony at the White House on Thursday.
Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind called it a major achievement.
Germany and France also welcomed the signing.
Under the agreement, Israeli troops are to begin withdrawing from the
West Bank, except parts of the town of Hebron, 10 days after the accord
is signed and complete their pull-out in six months. Palestinian
elections will be held 22 days later.
Some Israeli soldiers will stay in parts of Hebron, a focus of tension
where 400 Jews live among 100,000 Palestinians.
The agreement was more than a year behind the schedule mapped out in
the landmark PLO-Israel peace accord of September 1993. Both sides
rushed to complete it before the Jewish New Year holiday started last
night.
At one point PLO chairman Yasser Arafat, angry over what he saw as
Israel's wavering, stormed out of the talks shouting: ''We are not
slaves.'' He was persuaded to return by phone calls from US and Egyptian
officials.
After agreement was reached, Mr Arafat, once the Jewish state's sworn
enemy, wished Israelis a happy New Year and said it would be ''a real
year of peace''.
The sides had struggled to come to terms on expanding self-rule,
started 16 months ago in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, to more of the West
Bank which was captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War.
The agreement also calls for the release in three stages of many of
the thousands of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.
Thousands of Jewish settlers will remain in the West Bank for the
present, many of whom have already made clear their opposition to a
peace process which might involve their leaving.
However, there has been the expected criticism. In Damascus, the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the Democratic
Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) condemned the agreement.
Mr Ariel Sharon, a former Israeli defence minister who aspires to
become Israel's next prime minister after elections due in November next
year, vowed a government of his would overturn the agreement.
Meanwhile, in what appeared to represent a departure from his Labour
party's policy, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin told the press he
would not rule out a possible future Palestinian state.

RYDER Cup rookie Philip Walton won the crucial point that clinched a
famous victory for Europe's golfers over the United States at Oak Hill
today.
The 33-year-old Irishman beat Jay Haas by one hole to crown a fighting
comeback by the Europeans who started the day two points down.
Europe finally triumphed by the slenderest possible margin 14 1/2 to
13 1/2 for their first triumph since 1989 and the first time the
Americans had been beaten on home soil since 1987.
It was third time lucky for European captain Bernard Gallacher, who
suffered defeat in his first two Ryder Cup campaigns.
Gallacher's team won seven of the final day's singles matches, with
victories from Mark James, Howard Clark, Sam Torrance, Nick Faldo, Colin
Montgomerie, David Gilford and Walton.
Faldo's victory was crucial. He was one down with two holes to play
but won on the last in a breathtaking finish.
And Scotland's David Coulthard made it a super Sunday with his first
Formula One Grand Prix victory yesterday.
His win in Portugal was achieved in his 21st start and uncorked a
celebration for the 300 residents of his home village, Twynholm, near
Kirkcudbright.
The 24-year-old has been their hero since he started karting 13 years
ago and won British and Scottish championships.
His parents, Duncan and Joyce, were in Estoril to see him win.
