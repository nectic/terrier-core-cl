PEOPLE greatly overestimate the likelihood of being a victim of crime,
according to a survey out today. On average, people think 26 in every
100 people will have been a victim of crime in the last year -- when in
fact the figure is between one and two. The survey, carried out for the
BBC Radio 4 programme The Violent Files, shows that over-65s fear crime
most, yet are the least likely to experience it.
Less than half of males (42%) in the 15-24 age group are concerned,
although the risk of assault is greater for them than for any other age
group. People also fear attacks from strangers, but are much more likely
to suffer violence from someone they know.

SOUTH African pace bowler Brian McMillan snapped up four New Zealand
wickets as the tourists struggled to 211 for six on the opening day of
the decisive third Test at Cape Town yesterday.
The tall seamer, playing on his home ground, gained considerable lift
and movement after rain had delayed the start of play, and ended with
four for 39 from 19, aggressive overs after the Kiwis won the toss and
decided to bat.
New Zealand's troubles began in the second over after lunch when they
lost two wickets. McMillan had Darrin Murray caught by Gary Kirsten for
five and Adam Parore was run out after a misunderstanding with Bryan
Young.
Martin Crowe (18) was caught behind off Steven Jack, McMillan trapped
Young lbw for 45, and then he bowled Shane Thomson for a third-ball duck
to reduce New Zealand to 96 for five.
Then Ken Rutherford and Stephen Fleming added 83 for the sixth wicket,
preventing South Africa from taking total control. But, just as
Rutherford looked to be regaining his confidence after a lean spell with
the bat, he fell to a sucker punch.
Kirsten dropped a little deeper at square leg, and McMillan's short
ball lured Rutherford into the pull shot which had twice cost him his
wicket in the Durban Test.
The ball went straight to Kirsten and the New Zealand captain was
obviously annoyed with himself as he trudged off. His 56 came from 138
balls and included seven fours.
New Zealand's hopes now lie with aggressive left-hander Fleming, who
responded to being dropped down the order to No.7 by producing his best
innings of the tour.
At the close he was 58 not out, a 135-ball inning that included nine
fours.
The series is tied one-all.

THE losing streak that has bugged England in Australia seems to have
crossed to another continent. The A team made the worst possible start
to their winter tour when they were defeated by one run by the Cricket
Club of India, a squad of Test hopefuls, in Bombay yesterday.
The tourists should have cruised to a comfortable victory after having
reached 154 for three in reply to CCI's total of 209 for six from 50
overs.
But England lost captain Alan Wells and Glamorgan's David Hemp, the
mainstays of their batting, to successive deliveries for 44 and 43
respectively, and England slumped.
Once again an England touring team was made to look second rate
against quality leg-spin bowling, as India's Sairaj Bahutule took five
for 41.
England had cause to be pleased with their start when Wells's decision
to invite CCI to bat was rewarded by his attack forcing the Indians to
struggle for every run.
Amol Muzumdar, who scored a world record debut 260 for Bombay last
year, survived a dolly catch to Lancashire's Glen Chapple to make an
undefeated 49 after Samir Dighe formed the backbone of the innings with
55.
Yorkshire spinner Richard Stemp, who took three for 44 and could have
had five if England's fielding had been sharper, was pick of the tourist
attack before new Warwickshire batsman Nick Knight (28) and Lancashire's
Jason Gallian (25) put on 48 for the first wicket in reply.
But Bahutule scalped Gallian, and Mark Ramprakash for a duck, in three
deliveries and later trapped forceful Knight with England 70 for three.
Wells and Hemp put on 84 in 16 overs to raise England's hopes, and
they narrowly failed to score the 14 they needed to win off the last
over, finishing on 208 for eight.

<HEADLINE>Gough's cavalier half-century even has Aussies applauding The laughing boy wonder from Barnsley</HEADLINE>

HE has been called Yorkshire's first West Indian, and the Australian
public have adopted him as one of their kind.
But English cricket can give thanks today for the fact Darren Gough is
red, white and blue all the way through.
In just 60 minutes, the boy from Barnsley put a smile back on faces
that have been creased with worry for weeks, and it was not so much what
he did as the way he did it.
Gough's swashbuckling half-century is unlikely to altersignificantly
the course of this winter's Ashes series and may not dramatically affect
the outcome of the third Test.
But seldom, if ever, has an innings of 51 done so much good for so
many people.
Gough, the laughing cavalier, lifted the dark cloud of depression
hanging over England's dressing room by taking on Australia's bowlers as
though he did not have a care in the world.
In fact, he cares very much. The difference between him and so many
other professional sportsmen is that emotions are not kept strictly
under lock and key.
When Gough is pleased he beams with delight. When he's amused he grins
from ear to ear. And when he's cross no-one will die wondering why.
In short the lad has character and, happily from England's point of
view, a lot of class too.
Comparisons with Ian Botham are dangerously far-fetched. But it is
fair to say he possesses the same sort of self-belief that could help
his country escape from many a tight spot in years to come.
Yesterday, with England in crisis yet again at 198 for seven, Gough
bumped into Hampshire captain Mark Nicholas just before start of play
and told him: ''Fasten your seat-belt.''
It was poor advice, for people all around the SCG were soon on their
feet as he stormed to his half-century off 45 deliveries.
''I went out wanting to smash the ball all around the park and that's
what I did,'' said Gough without a trace of arrogance.
''It's just the way I play. I've been brought up to believe in my own
ability. I try to hit the ball for 4 and sometimes it comes off. I was
determined to play my natural game, and I really enjoyed it.''
This time, four days after being the second victim of Shane Warne's
Melbourne hat-trick, he looked solid gold.
Craig McDermott was hooked for 6 and crashed back over his head for
another handsome boundary.
''I've got a lot of respect for McDermott but I just wanted to hit him
for 4s,'' he said. ''I reckon it's my best batting performance in
first-class cricket.''
And on reaching his second Test half-century following last summer's
65 on his debut against New Zealand, Gough not only acknowledged his
appreciative team-mates but saluted England's singing supporters on what
used to be the Sydney hill.
That was a nice touch. ''They've come a long way to watch us and have
cheered even when we've been losing,'' he said.
Gough, of course, is principally a bowler and a highly promising one.
He's also a natural showman.
''I like to entertain,'' he admits. ''Mike Watkinson of Lancashire
called me the first West Indian to play for Yorkshire, and I try to
carry on like that.
''But I do not just want to be an entertainer. I want to do well for
England whether batting, bowling or fielding.''
Australian supporters joined in the standing ovation when Gough was
finally caught at long leg trying to hook McDermott into the crowd
again.
The 24-year-old scored all but seven runs of a 58 partnership with
Angus Fraser.
He was still chattering excitedly about his innings in the dressing
room when Devon Malcolm returned with a Test best 29 which included two
6s off Warne.
''Devon could not say anything because I had not finished talking
about my innings,'' joked Gough.
The complete 110-minute episode, during which England added 111 for
their last three wickets, was huge fun for everyone but Australia's
bowlers.
And the only pity was Gough and Malcolm were prevented by steady rain
from having another dart with the ball.
After three and a half overs, the Australians had put four runs
without loss on the board.

IN A time when golf is awash with statistics -- you can hardly take a
backswing these days without a number being crunched in some computer
somewhere -- the poor old stroke index is suffering from neglect.
No-one, it seems, wants to know about it.
The masses who play club golf are well acquainted with this index,
which rules the handicap golfer.
Each hole is allocated a number, ranging from one to 18. In
Stableford, bogey or par, and in team competitions the figures are your
ally. If your handicap is equal to or less than the number attributed to
a hole you receive a stroke against the common enemy, par. In matchplay
the index tells you at which holes you give or receive a stroke.
This is all commonly understood, but where there is a divergence of
opinion is how indices are constructed, and many currently will be in
the process of revision as scorecards are reprinted in readiness for the
1995 season.
Rule 33-4 tells committees to publish such tables, but there are no
guidelines as to how this should be done, except for the Ladies' Golf
Union handbook, which offers a policy attributed, wrongly it seems, to
the Royal and Ancient Golf Club.
In fact, it is advice similar to that from an anonymous source in
earlier editions -- but not recent ones -- of the Golfer's Handbook
before responsibility passed to the Royal and Ancient Golf Club, who
consider the index to be a handicapping matter and an issue for the home
unions.
There are at least three views on the subject.
The Golfer's Handbook of yore advised: The stroke index should reflect
the degree of difficulty of holes, the lowest number indicating where it
is hardest to achieve par, but with the following provisos. Holes
indexed one and two should be neither the first nor second as this would
disadvantage the lower handicapper if a match went to sudden-death.
Neither should one or two be the seventeenth or eighteenth as a match
might be over before the higher handicapper was able to take advantage.
Also, high and low indices should be equally distributed over the
outward and inward halves.
That, I believe, remains the most widespread method, but there are
exceptions. The 376-yard first at Kirkintilloch, for example, is stroke
index one, which surely has caused angst among lower handicappers who
have been hijacked there after matches have finished level after 18.
Yet there is nothing which says that is wrong. Neither the Scottish
Golf Union nor the Council of National Golf Unions has a policy, though
Ian Hume, the SGU secretary, did offer what he stressed was a personal
opinion.
''If clubs have computer analyses of scoring at individual holes, then
my advice would be to put them in order of difficulty from one to 18 on
that basis and not vary from it,'' he said.
Such a method, he believes, is compatible with both the SGU
recommendation of full handicap difference for matchplay and today's
handicapping system which, in theory at least, reflects current form.
Another method is one which John Glover, the R and A rules secretary,
believes to operate in Australia, where the same stroke index covers all
courses who agree to use it.
One advantage that system has is to eliminate the total confusion
which occurs on those rare occasions when men, with their stroke index
relating to medal tees, play against women, whose index is completely
different as it reflects the course from the forward tees.
In the meantime any old method is legal. The device is intended to
result in two players with different handicaps and both playing to form
coming down the eighteenth all square -- and that would happen in theory
even if the numbers were drawn out of a hat.
But it would be tidy if everyone did the same thing.

<HEADLINE>Wilander win fails to save Swedes</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>980549738</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A ROUSING recovery by former world No.1 Mats Wilander failed to spare
Sweden from a first-round defeat in the Hopman Cup mixed team tournament
in Perth, Australia, yesterday.
With his country already 1-0 up after the women's singles, Ukraine's
Andrei Medvedev appeared to have settled the issue when he led his
one-time sporting idol by a set and 2-0 in the men's rubber.
A lacklustre Wilander seemed to have accepted the inevitable and
looked as surprised as anyone when his opponent allowed him 10 of the
next 12 games to trail 4-0 in the final set.
Wilander duly kept his nerve for an unlikely 2-6, 6-4, 6-3 success
against a player ranked 111 places above his current position of 126,
only for Swedish optimism to be doused in the mixed doubles.
A still tentative Medvedev dropped his opening service game, but he
and his sister Natalia combined better than the unfamiliar Swedish
pairing of Wilander and Asa Carlsson for a 6-2, 6-2 win.
In the end, Medvedev owed much to his sister's fortitude for ensuring
the fifth seeds' quarter-final meeting against the United States today.
Medvedeva suffered an attack of stomach cramps in the second set of
her match with Carlsson, but hung on to win 6-7, 6-4, 7-5 in two hours
35 minutes.
The quarter-final line-up was completed when French pair Jean-Philippe
Fleurian and Julie Halard narrowly beat Brenda Schultz and Tom Nijssen
of Holland in the deciding mixed doubles to secure a tie against
third-seeded Spain tomorrow.
* FIRST-round results at the Australian men's hardcourt championships
in Adelaide yesterday were:
P Rafter (Australia) beat Todd Woodbridge (Australia) 7-6 (7-3), 6-1;
C-U Steeb (Germany) beat W Masur (Australia) 6-4, 7-6 (7-5); J Morgan
(Australia) beat B Black (Zimbabwe) 4-6, 6-2, 6-4; A Boetsch (France)
beat B Shelton (USA) 4-6, 7-5, 7-6 (7-2); R Furlan (Italy) beat G Pozzi
(Italy) 6-3, 6-4; R Fromberg (Australia) beat J Stark (USA) 6-4, 6-2.

<HEADLINE>Challenges ahead for the team players A New Year wish is for 14[1/2] Ryder Cup points and a feel-good factor</HEADLINE>

Team events have become high-profile events and, as RAYMOND JACOBS
writes, a number of Scots golfers are determined to play a successful
part.
THE more or less haphazard way in which the golfing programme has
evolved over the decades -- men's and women's and at every level -- has
inadvertently made the odd-numbered years top-heavy with the more
important team events, to fit in as best they may with the usual menu of
the major championships and the regular tournaments.
Thus in 1995 the Walker Cup and the Ryder Cup will be played
respectively at Royal Porthcawl and Oak Hill within a fortnight of each
other, having been preceded by three months by the European amateur team
championship at Royal Antwerp, which Wales, appropriately enough in the
centenary year of their Golfing Union, will be defending.
Those who either administer the game or play it at the highest
competitive level are naturally sharply aware of the challenges ahead
and scarcely a week will go by, once the season is fully under way,
without some reference being made to the influence of this tournament's
outcome or that on the formation of the three sides.
Sandy Jones and Ken Schofield, the two Scots who are in tandem as the
respective executive directors of the PGA and the PGA European Tour,
needed little prompting when asked to nominate their priority in the
order of precedence of their hopes and ambitions for the season ahead --
regaining the Ryder Cup from the United States at Rochester, New York.
''My New Year wish is for 14[1/2] points (the winning total),'' Jones
said. ''The Ryder Cup is the key issue. If we win, it would help to keep
golf buoyant in Europe, as the feel-good factor spread down through the
game. Of course, I'd also like Europeans to win all four majors; Colin
Montgomerie, in particular, is due one.''
Turning to what he described as ''the real world,'' Jones added: ''I
want our members to see an improvement in trade at their shops. It's
been a tough three or four years for them. I hope that they not only get
better support from their members and the public at large, but also that
more people take up the game.''
After having mentioned in the passing his fervent desire for the
return of the club he supports, St Johnstone, to the premier division,
Schofield moved from ''wishful thinking'' to echo Jones' support for a
Montgomerie breakthrough. ''He deserves one now,'' he asserted before
he, too, turned his attention to the Ryder Cup.
''Winning again is my greatest hope for 1995,'' Schofield said. ''But
if Europe can't, then a tie will do as the next best thing. It won't be
easy to bring the trophy back, but, knowing how difficult the task is,
the team would at least have shown some resolution in achieving a draw
-- as Bob Willis said the other day of England's cricketers.''
A place in the side is a long-term vision for Andrew Coltart,
although, given his successes of the last year, the time-scale may begin
to shrink from the six years he gave himself at the start of the 1994
season. ''Obviously it's a goal when you reach a certain stage in your
career,'' Coltart admitted. ''But I'm not there yet.''
''Basically,'' the Scottish professional and Australian PGA champion
said, ''it's important not to get my wires crossed. I'd like to have
some high finishes early in the campaign, then pace myself, and by the
end of the year perks like the Dunhill and World Cup may come up. I'd
like to play in them for Scotland again.''
Over the past four years the Solheim Cup match has aroused as much
enthusiasm and interest in women's professional golf as the Ryder and
Walker Cup encounters have done in their spheres. Not surprisingly,
therefore, although Catriona Matthew is embarking on her first season in
the paid ranks she has already set a place on Europe's 1996 side high on
her agenda.
Having gained full exemption on to the LPGA Tour, Matthew will play
mainly on it, fitting in some seven tournaments in Europe. ''My main
priority will be to succeed in retaining my card, but another objective
would be to become Rookie of the Year,'' she said and to that end she
will open her new career later this month in Florida.
On the amateur side, Hugh McKibbin, as Scottish champion, has played
in the home internationals. Naturally, a step up to the Walker Cup team
is the next target and that process should be helped when he and another
candidate, Stephen Gallacher, the European champion, travel later this
month to the sunshine of Australia to compete probably in two
tournaments.
''I want to play consistently and well enough not to slip back,'' the
Troon Welbeck member declared. ''I've been practising hard and I hope to
get off to a good start. I'll be playing in more competitions than I
usually do to give myself the best chance of making the side.''
One of those who will decide McKibbin's fate is George Macgregor, the
new chairman of the Royal and Ancient Club's selection committee. ''This
year, of course, centres on one thing -- the Walker Cup,'' he said,
''and we need to put on as good a show as possible, especially after
that heavy defeat at Interlachen in the last match.
''We had a very good squad meeting at Porthcawl in October and there's
another in April and we must build on them. Otherwise, I'd like to see
Scotland becoming a force again as a team, particularly in the European
championship, after which the side to meet America will be chosen. We
have good individual players, but recently they've been disappointing as
a unit.''
Whether or not the proposed Scottish National Golf Centre will
eventually help in that direction, Douglas Dalgleish, president of the
Scottish Golf Union, hopes that the areas will approve the completed
feasibility study of Balbirnie Park, after which discussion the SGU
executive will decide, for or against, to proceed with the project.
But Dalgleish added: ''I was encouraged by the performances of Stephen
Gallacher and Gordon Sherry in the European individual championship and
of Barassie winning the corresponding club title. I would hope we can
move on from these successes and carry their influence towards improving
Scotland's fortunes in the home Internationals.''

SOUTH Africa heads into 1995 richly savouring its hard-won democracy,
but with an economy firing on too few cylinders for the transition to
offer much more to the black majority yet than the vote, analysts say.
Economic analysts report more good news than bad on an economy which
during the past year has slowly crept out of its longest recession on
record. But daunting challenges lie ahead.
''There is increasing recognition that South Africa's hard-fought
democracy will be meaningless, unsustainable, unless the economy
performs much better than in the past two decades,'' the South African
Chamber of Business said.
Amid the inevitable disruptions experienced up to and beyond April's
historic all-race elections, the economy failed to gather the momentum
many had hoped for as democracy dawned.
Economists estimate economic growth for 1994 at 2%, which is almost
double the rate of last year but is only half that of the more
optimistic forecasts made early this year, and still lags population
growth.
''The economy is a mixed bag of a worrisome agricultural sector, a
mining sector in the doldrums, but a manufacturing sector showing
distinct signs of stirring and reaching out to the levels of
pre-recession 1990,'' said independent economist Edward Osborn.
Some leading financial houses predict the growth tempo will quicken to
3%-3.5% in 1995, entrenching a platform for its healthiest cycle in many
years.
The relatively peaceful transition and the post-apartheid government's
repeated commitment to fiscal and monetary discipline and to developing
investor-friendly policies have boosted local business confidence.
However, with the new government yet to build a track record against
which it can be judged, foreign investors remain wary.
And analysts say that with formal unemployment running at nearly 50%,
the country needs sustained growth of 4%-6% supported by large dollops
of foreign capital to significantly dent the ranks of jobless. Officials
rule out any quick-fix solutions.
Reserve (Central) Bank Governor Chris Stals said recently that the
economy, now freed from anti-apartheid sanctions, needed painful reforms
to promote growth and prosperity.
''We have an over-protected domestic economy that must face some
painful corrections,'' he said, adding that certain industries were not
ready to take on the highly-competitive players of industrialised and
newly-developed countries.
Meantime, the national unity government, led by the African National
Congress, faces a stern test in managing expectations among the
five-to-one black majority for rapidly-enhanced living standards,
analysts said.
They said 1995 would be an important year in setting direction for the
economy, and would provide the first true indication of the new
government's economic management in the face of such pressure.
In its favour, there is evidence that local fixed investment has shown
signs of significant revival, and the recovery of industrialised
economies and the jump in world commodity prices should benefit South
Africa's mineral and manufacturing exports.
After good, early summer rains however, a severe mid-season drought
threatens the important agriculture sector.
One of hottest topics of debate on the economy currently centres on
the prospect of scrapping exchange controls, whose critics blame them
for inhibiting foreign investment.
Stals, concerned about sparse foreign exchange reserves which cover
the cost of barely six weeks' imports, favours a gradual relaxation
rather than a ''Big Bang'' full-scale removal many commentators call
for.
Analysts believe he could start the ball rolling in 1995. But he is
expected to move cautiously, having pointed to Russia's recent currency
turmoil to illustrate the risks of a premature liberalisation.

Nicola Reeves looks at the difficulties facing existing suppliers of
electrical warranties
SHOPPERS seeking out electrical bargains in the sales will, in many
cases, be persuaded to take out extended warranties on their purchased
goods. Extended warranties are insurance policies which provide extra
protection against product breakdown after the standard manufacturer's
guarantee has expired.
In addition to providing peace of mind to the customer, it provides a
lucrative sideline for the main electrical retailers such as Dixons,
which also owns Curry's, and Comet owned by the Kingfisher retail group.
Dixons is the UK's largest electrical retailer, with about 20% market
share.
City analysts at stockbrokers BZW suggest that the huge profits
available on these warranty products account for most of Dixons group
profit and all of Comet's profit, which were #81.8m and #16.4m
respectively in 1993/94.
Dixons has sold 4.5 million extended warranties since setting up its
own insurance business.
However, this may all change for the good of consumers following the
recent publication of the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) report on
extended warranties on electrical goods.
The report called for the establishment of a code of practice to be
implemented within a framework of self-regulation that will require
retailers to publish prices and terms prominently and perhaps most
significantly, introduce competing products.
The report confirmed the extremely high levels of profitability in
warranties, in some cases in excess of 70% gross margins, and
established that there is a wide range of prices for very similar
warranties.
Given that the financial risk of repair costs on the product should be
the same for the same product, the differences in price, it is
concluded, must be accounted for by variations in commission rates
payable to the retailer and the insurer.
Aside from peace of mind, it is questionable whether extended
warranties -- currently taken out by about a third of customers -- are
necessary on most mainstream electrical items.
The OFT report noted that on the basis of its evidence, generally,
camcorders, colour TVs, audio systems including separates such as
compact disc players, microwave ovens, cookers and refrigeration
products are likely, on average, not to fail in years two to five. Video
recorders and dishwashers may be more problematic, but even so the OFT
said they may fail once but are unlikely to fail twice.
Electrical retailers already operate against a background of intense
competition, a situation exacerbated by the development of electrical
retailing businesses by the privatised regional electricity companies.
In the first half of the current financial year, Comet reported a
first-half loss of #1.7m compared with a #700,000 profit in the
comparable period of 1993. This was due to a combination of factors
including a 6.7% decline in underlying like-for-like sales and increased
store costs.
Higher interest rates, new store openings and #3m of reorganisation
costs do not provide a positive backdrop for profitability in the second
half.
Dixons is due to report its interim results on January 11. July and
August were very weak and saw a sharp slowdown in Currys Superstores'
like-for-like sales from 11% to 7% and underlying sales declines for the
group as a whole. There was a modest improvement in September and
October but overall, underlying sales in the first half are expected to
be static.
The electrical market, as a whole, was weak in October and there is
general agreement within the industry that computer games hardware will
be down 20% on last year. Software will also be weaker, but to a lesser
extent than hardware.
Sales of computers and mobile phones are thought to be strong, but
these are not large enough sectors to make up for the shortfall in white
and brown goods such as as washing machines and TVs.
City analysts have scaled down their profit forecasts for 1995 by
about #10m and, in general, are forecasting pre-tax profits of about
#83m compared with #73.3m in 1994.
This OFT report, the latest assault on the sector's profitability, is
expected to prompt some rationalisation in the marketplace. There is the
distinct possibility of outside operators being attracted into the
market.
For example, insurance companies offering manufacturers' warranties at
the point-of-sale. The insurance market is already highly competitive
spurred on by the growth of the direct writers such as Direct Line.
Their entrance into the warranty market could deal a major blow to
warranty profits for the established retailers. If warranty profits come
under pressure then it is inevitable that the prices of electrical goods
in the shops will rise as retailers seek to make up the ''lost'' money
elsewhere. Given the market clout of the major suppliers, there seems
little prospect of retailers getting much improvement in their buying
terms from manufacturers.
John Clare, chief executive of Dixons, believes that the costs
associated with selling extended warranties have been ignored or
underestimated. In addition, he says that analysts have ignored the fact
that without extended warranties, the dynamics of Dixons' business and
of the whole electrical retail sector would change. ''In the extreme
event of extended warranties disappearing from the mix, the assumption
that nothing else would change is ludicrous'' he said.
In the longer term those retailers best placed to prosper in the more
competitive environment will be the ones offering the best mix of range,
price and service. The commanding market positions of Dixons and Comet
suggests that they will remain top of the pile, albeit one reduced from
its current size.

ACCORDING to the Royal Bank of Scotland, interest rates will rise
steadily this year to peak atalmost 9% in 1996. The bank's chief
economist, Jeremy Peat, said that if Chancellor Kenneth Clarke decided
to raise rates sharply over the next six months, there was ''a plausible
view'' for believing that longer term rates would peak at a level below
9%. He also warned of inflationary pressures, writes CHRIS STONE.
Mr Peat said that ''an explosion in consumer expedniture in 1994 --
with taxes down and wages going up -- would doubtless have made us all
feel great, but only for another short-lived period of recovery. Now we
face the prospect of feeling reasonable for a far longer time span.''
He said ''we are now moving towards an economy where growth is led by
exports and investment rather than consumption. This emphassis, rather
than on consumer demand, provides a much improved starting point for
that stable long-term growth path that we should all be seeking.''
Mr Peat said he expected base rates to continue rising through 1995
reaching 8.5% before the end of the year.
So far as inflation was concerned, the Royal's economist said there
were signs of pressures building up, leading to some rise in UK output
prices. And he stressed that only further improvements in productivity
and the continued competitive nature of domestic and international
markets could prevent an acceleration in prices of goods leaving UK
factories and in the shops.

Hogmanay Diary: Sara Villiers was one among 150,000 who enjoyed the
revels as Edinburgh laid claim to the title of winter festival city
EDINBURGH: Hogmanay City? I headed eastwards for the second year of
the Edinburgh Hogmanay Festival with reservations about the capital's
party potential. Three frenetic days later, my reservations were
floundering amidst waves of enthusiasm.
At the shindig in the Royal Scottish Academy which preceded the
official launch I forsook the chippolatas and prawn filos to collar Eric
Milligan, convener of Lothian Regional Council and the man who would
signal the start of festivities. Feeling nervous about your big moment,
Eric?
''Edinburgh will be the place to be be at Hogmanay . . . ,'' he boomed
at me, and then rattled off a litany of the capital's delights.
Minutes later, out in The Mound square, enlightenment dawned. Milligan
took to the podium and roared so loudly into the mike Pat Lally must
have heard him in Glasgow: ''Edinburgh will be the place to be at
Hogmanay . . . '' He eventually pressed a button and fireworks sprouted
into the sky as thousands trooped down from Parliament Square, holding
aloft burning torches, paper lanterns, and a 27ft longboat.
I fell into line behind the crazy Sativa drummers and bopped my way
along Princes Street and up Waterloo Place, through the colourful
carnival with its rides ranging from a giant Helter Skelter and a quirky
Crooked Cottage to the lunch-recycling horrors of Kamikaze and the
Terminator.
The boat and the procession berthed on Calton Hill where a massive
bonfire blazed and groups including the Gutty Slippers Pipe Band
provided music you simply couldn't keep still to. As the ancient pagan
ritual of The Goloshan was enacted at the Acropolis, fire sculptures
burned and beardie men roared and attacked the longboat with axes and
chucked it on the bonfire.
It was a beautiful night, affording an amazing view of the city but
the nip in the air forced me down from the hill. I thought longingly of
the groovy woollen hat I had seen Pete Irvine, head honcho of the
organisers Unique Event and henceforth known as Party Pete, wearing with
a natty kilt.
At the offices of Unique on Saturday fish swam lazily round a giant
tank while the staff slumped on sofas and airily wondered if this was
the calm before a storm. I spent a trip to the Grassmarket Fair dropping
blatant hints about a pressing need to go hat-shopping, until Party Pete
finally gave me his hip headwear.
More dress sense prevailed when my hostess in Edinburgh refused to let
me leave her house in my silver mini-skirt. I was finally bundled out
the door swaddled in so many layers I made the Michelin Man look like
Kate Moss. Outside, I praised her commonsense. On a teetotal painkiller
regime for a wonky arm -- having been mugged in the friendly city of
Glasgow the previous week -- I had to forsake any warming drams.
The streets were chock-a-block with happy faces. Squashed about 500
yards away from the stage at The Mound, I danced and cheered to Mouth
Music and laughed with everyone else as Jackie Joyce admonished: ''Don't
get drunk.''
Everyone already looked more than merry, whether swigging from
doctored Coke bottles or silver hip-flasks. There was a hefty tourist
presence in town, with many Europeans and Antipodeans around, the latter
alerted to the party by the backpackers' bible, TNT. It was easy to spot
the foreigners: they were clutching wine bottles rather than cans of
Export.
In the splendour of the Merchants' Hall, ballgowned lovelies and
tuxedoed gents were letting rip, jiving to the Hollywood Rockets. I
posed among them in my Michelin chic and headed back on to the streets
for the Bells.
A carpet of 150,000 bods now covered Princes Street. The atmosphere
was magical and I was lifted from my feet by the roar which greeted the
fireworks heralding '95. Despite the huge crowds it was remarkably
peaceable, a tribute to the meticulous organisation which had made it
all possible.
Runrig entertained the West end of Princes Street but the hippest
chicks were gathered at The Mound for a nostalgic trip down a Bay City
Rollers byway. ''Bye Bye Baby,'' we shrieked tunelessly. ''You're the
one girl in town I'll marry,'' as we snogged strangers with traditional
abandon.
Off to the Assembly Rooms and the half-hour Shedding of Outdoor
Garments ritual before dancing until dawn to the thrashy ceilidh
manicness of the Tartan Amoebas and the tasty torso of funky piper
Martyn Bennett, who stripped off his shirt after racing up to the
Assembly Rooms following an energetic set at the Mound.
The only dark spot was at the end of the Revels, when a cloakroom
pandemonium ensued.
At the Traverse the following night, Club '95 was another triumph.
Multi-level entertainment had Disco Inferno downstairs giving way to
hardcore rave post-midnight, while the bar succumbed to the cabaret
experience of The Living Jukebox, from Amsterdam. The bewigged Helen and
Yvonne rattled out sardonic versions of My Baby Just Cares For Me,
Jambalaya, and La Bamba, rolling their eyes and secreting chewing gum on
the mikestand before each song -- and keeping the audience in stiches.
Upstairs a couple in white coats were selling non-alcoholic ''smart
drinks'', thick, yucky concoctions of vitamins and minerals. I doubted
their efficacy. The vendor couldn't subtract #4 from a tenner.
The upstairs Atrium hosted the highlight of the night, and indeed the
weekend, the aforementioned Martyn Bennett. Excuse me while my lyrical
wax melts over the page but this is the man to watch in '95. The crowd
whooped and hollered as the 23-year-old Edinburgh-based
multi-instrumentalist strutted his stuff through numbers like The Jimmy
Shandricks Experience and Jacobean Be-Bop -- and girls swooned as he
once again stripped off that shirt.
After the gig this stage exhibitionist transformed himself into a
mild-mannered small person and said it was the heat from the lights
which made him do it, while confidentially admitting (''don't write this
down'') that when he had tossed his shirt into the crowd whilst playing
a gig with Wolfstone in Denmark a fight had broken out.
We party animals were lost in music and Party Pete was lost in
thought. Wandering around wearing a contented smile he deliberated on
next year's bash. ''How can we follow it all?'' he wondered. Doubtless
he'll come up with an answer. And a matching hat. Count me in,
Edinburgh.

STIRLING Albion goalkeeper Mark McGeown was taken to Monklands General
Hospital yesterday with head and neck injuries after crashing on to the
brick hard pitch at Broadwood Stadium, Cumbernauld.
Bearsden referee George Clyde had been inspecting the pitch from
10.30am, and decided that the second division match between Clyde and
Stirling Albion could go ahead. Minutes after the incident involving
McGeown, he abandoned the game with 14 minutes played.
By then Stirling had taken the lead through Paul Armstrong, but
officials of both clubs and the fans had barely noticed that as the
players slithered on the frostbound pitch. Then the goalkeeper had to be
stretchered off the field.
Clyde doctor John McLean, who treated McGeown on the spot, said: ''He
struck his head just above the right temple and was knocked unconscious.
When he came round he was disorientated.
''As a precaution we put a collar on to protect his neck and he will
have X-rays on his skull and neck, but I think he should be all right.''
A hospital spokesman last night said that McGeown had gone home after
having been X-rayed. He had a small cut to his head, but it did not
require stitches. He has been advised by the hospital about any
reactions arising from the injury.
Stirling Albion manager Kevin Drinkell earlier had remonstrated with
the referee. He said: ''I was told that the referee passed the pitch at
10.30am, but when I arrived at 1.30 my first reaction was that I was
glad I was not playing.
''I went on to the pitch with the referee, pointed out how hard it
was, and asked him to consider the safety of the players. I asked him to
cancel the game and reported to Clyde that I had asked for this to
happen.
''Some of my players are part-time and I actually made three changes
in my line-up because of the conditions. Unhappily, one of those I
brought in was Mark.''
Clyde manager Alex Smith pointed out that his club had gone by the
rules by bringing the referee in early. He added: ''The rule states that
if the pitch is flat and not rutted, the game can go on. I believe the
referee went by the rule book.''

IT MIGHT not be much consolation for the Ne'erday fans who were denied
their holiday football diet yesterday when three out of the four premier
division games were knocked out because of frozen pitches, but it is
certain that within the next two seasons all premier division grounds
will be required to have undersoil heating.
A sub-committee of the Scottish League, set up to recommend criteria
for membership of all four divisions, is due to report at the end of the
season and it will insist on all top league clubs providing heated
pitches as part of their remit. The time-scale, if the recommendation is
accepted, would be too tight to give clubs time to have the work done
for next season, but the chances are that the deadline would apply to
the following year.
While it seems remarkable that the premier division clubs, through the
Taylor Report, have been forced along the road towards all-seated,
covered stadiums, a relatively inexpensive item like undersoil heating
has not been already enforced. The problem for some clubs is that they
would have to bear the cost of installing a ''blanket,'' roughly
#200,000, without any assistance from the Football Trust, whose funding
only goes towards stadium improvements.
''Along with the high costs of implementing the Taylor Report, it
would be difficult for some clubs to find the cash to put in undersoil
heating,'' said Scottish League secretary Peter Donald. ''However, I
believe at premier division level, at least, the chances are that the
sub-committee will recommend its installation.''
It was always a fair bet that in the first season that Scottish
football took a winter break its return would coincide with bad weather.
The clubs came back on Saturday from two weeks' off work, but it was too
much to hope that they would get in a full holiday programme over a
weekend. Sod's Law being enshrined in the game's lore, it was no
surprise that on the first day of ice, three of the four home grounds
due to host the action did not have pitch protection.
Had Hearts been playing Hibs at Easter Road the game would have been
safe; had Falkirk been playing Partick Thistle at Firhill there would
have been no problem. Only Kilmarnock v Motherwell would have been
struggling in reverse order, although 'Well use the plastic cover method
which has helped in the past.
Killie, in fact, called for only a precautionary inspection and, no
doubt, were rather stunned when the referee called it off. The Ayrshire
club had hoped to play the game today but that idea fell down and now
they and Motherwell await the League's decision on the new date. Under
the rules, the game should go ahead next midweek but Motherwell have
pointed out that they are due to play on Sunday and then again on Friday
because of TV demands. They would not be keen to sandwich another game
in the middle.
Falkirk and Thistle also had thoughts of playing today but they have
settled for January 17.
Six of the 10 premier grounds have undersoil heating, but only one, at
Tannadice, was on the schedule yesterday.
The postponement of the capital derby at Tynecastle could give the
Hearts defender, Craig Levein, a bizarre repeat of his New Year
programme of last season. The Scottish international defender is serving
a 10-game suspension which would have meant him returning against Dundee
United at Tynecastle on January 14, but the loss of the derby, if all
else stays as scheduled, means that his first game back will be against
Hibs on the new date, January 18. It will be his first game since early
November.
Last season, Levein missed 10 games because of a severe knee injury
and returned to action in the derby game, which had been postponed
because of bad weather, on January 12, his first game since late
October.

DAVID Coulthard will today be confirmed as No.2 driver to Damon Hill
in the Williams-Renault Formula One team.
The Scot is believed to have signed a contract which should net him
around #500,000 from his first full season on the circuit.
He finished eighth in the drivers' championship last season after
having competed in only half of the 16 races.
Nigel Mansell stopped competing in IndyCars to drive for Williams in
four races last season -- including the Australian Grand Prix which he
won.
But, despite that success, Williams have decided to opt for youth.
The Scot has been in pole position for the second seat since the
sport's governing body, the FIA, ruled that Williams had first option on
his services next season.
And the Hill-Coulthard combination means that for the first time, a
defending F1 team will start a season with an all-British line-up since
Damon's father, Graham, partnered Jim Clark in 1968.
The one remaining question now is whether Mansell will find a drive
for next season -- or be forced into retirement.

DUNDEE United's chairman Jim McLean has had enough of being portrayed
as some kind of football dictator who bullies everyone at Tannadice into
submission, and yesterday he spoke out in his own defence, insisting
there is no bad blood between himself and the club's manager, Ivan
Golac.
However, McLean could not honestly say Golac will continue as manager
when his contract expires at the end of the season.
''Ivan Golac will be given another contract when we, the board of
directors, are 100% confident in all aspects of his management,'' he
said.
From that it can be assumed Golac's time in Scottish football is
almost over.
The chances are the man who took the club to their first ever Scottish
Cup success last season will go when his contract ends in May, but if
the team slip into a relegation spot, he might be removed sooner.
United are in fourth bottom place, only a point clear of Kilmarnock
and Aberdeen, who occupy third and second-bottom berths. McLean and his
directors are already concerned that a team which had finished fourth in
the division when Golac took over 18 months ago should be so low.
McLean also disclosed he had offered his resignation three times in
the past two years by way of stressing that he is not determined to hold
on to his position at the club, and he resents the accusations that he
browbeats the other directors into submission.
''I own 19% of the club and it is an insult to the other directors to
say I make all the decisions,'' he said.
Clutching a newspaper cutting, McLean had appeared in the press box at
Tannadice before yesterday's match against Aberdeen determined to have
his say with the people he claims are really ''tearing Dundee United
apart,'' and demanded evidence of rows involving himself and the manager
be produced.
Rumours of a rift between Golac and his board have been rife recently,
but there is little doubt the manager has become extremely disillusioned
in his 18 months with the club. He has not been able to bring in all the
players he wanted, but McLean stressed yesterday that money is available
right now for players.
There is no point in McLean or anyone else trying to deny the fact
that, having managed the club for 21 years, he is not now a powerful and
influential figure, and that is why so many outsiders believe his word
is law.
Although his 19% share in the club is probably smaller than many had
imagined, he is still the largest shareholder on the board. It is also
true that he is a disciplinarian, but he said: ''I knew what was going
on and I knew who was getting the blame. I don't like getting the blame
when I haven't been involved in anything.
''Give me one fact. I've never fallen out with Ivan. The interference
is in your (the media) minds and right away you give a manager an excuse
for failing.
''You are tearing Dundee United apart by not dealing in fact.''
McLean did accept there have been disagreements between the board and
the manager this season, and then said: ''Crucify me if you want, but
deal in facts.''
He added that he didn't quit his job as manager but resigned because
he didn't want the hassle, yet there he was again at the centre of it
all within a club which does have problems. Some players, like the
manager, are disillusioned and one of them, Jim McInally, wants away.
The midfield player has interested Motherwell recently, but United
would not sell. Golac and the board had ''discussions'' about that
particular player and it was decided to reject Motherwell's bid of
#100,000 because enough people at United felt McInally was vital to the
team in these difficult days.
McInally has since been performing for the reserves, but he had to be
brought back into the side yesterday after Saturday's 4-0 defeat by
Hibernian.
It was McInally's first appearance since October and before the
kick-off he said: ''It is a sad reflection on some of those who played
in that game that someone who doesn't want to play for the club has had
to be brought back in.''
McInally added that he feels there has been a lack of professionalism
among some of the players since the Scottish Cup triumph last year.
''Some have been resting on their laurels. These are harsh words, but it
is all about pride.''
It was a day for harsh words, although Golac, who will not quit his
position, had no comment to make on the chairman's remarks. This time he
left the platform clear for McLean, who continued after the game,
saying: ''You cannot hide from results and performances. You stand or
fall on these. Results give managers and directors confidence.''
Typically, McLean's address was fragmented, and he touched on various
matters and also the general state of Scottish football, but always
returned to what is most important to him, United.
''We need commitment at Tannadice, we all have to be committed to the
club,'' he said.
There is the feeling that the directors don't believe their manager
has shown the commitment they require, even though McLean said Golac
would have full backing ''so long as he is United's manager.'' That
won't be for much longer.

A NEW set of darts, bought just a week ago, helped Scottish captain
Ronnie Sharp to pull off a major upset in the Embassy World Championship
at Frimley Green yesterday.
The Irvine man beat Bobby George, runner-up last year, 3-0 with a
superb performance in which he slotted nine doubles in only 19 attempts
and lost just two legs in the match.
Sharp, beaten in the semi-final by the eventual champion, Canadian
John Part, 12 months ago, said: ''I had been in terrible form since last
April, so I went out and bought a new set of 26-gram darts. I had been
playing with 22-gram darts and was fed up playing rubbish, so I thought
a change would do me good.''
It certainly did, for after George had won the opening leg, Sharp took
control, winning nine of the next 10 legs and giving his opponent no
chance to get into the match.
Meanwhile, Phil Taylor overcame a dose of ''double trouble'' yesterday
to win his third world title by carrying off the Proton Cars World
Championship at Purfleet, Essex.
Taylor, runner-up last year, beat Rod Harrington 6-2 in the final
after having lost two of the first three sets and despite firing an
incredible number of missed doubles.
In fact, in the entire match, Taylor sank only 19 doubles in 58
attempts, while Harrington managed 16 out of 35.

RAITH Rovers, the Coca-Cola Cup winners, will endeavor to play their
first European home match at Stark's Park.
There have been reports that the Kirkcaldy club have held talks with
the Scottish Rugby Union about the possibility of staging the game at
Murrayfield, but Alex Penman, the Raith chairman, has said that
''everything possible'' will be done to play the first game -- a
category B match which does not require an all-seated stadium -- in the
town.
Fellow director John Litster has been quoted commenting on the
attractions of the rugby ground, which has more than 60,000 seats.
''I am not so much angry as concerned by the confusion these reports
could cause,'' said Penman. ''They are pure speculation. The position is
that we have invited Scotland's UEFA representative, Ernie Walker, to
visit Stark's Park to give us his advice with a view to the first game
being played here.
''If we won through to the first round proper, then we would have to
look at the possibility of a new venue depending on the opposition.''

Hamilton 3, Airdrie 0
LIFE can be very confusing for football folk. It is difficult enough
to wake up thinking you will be watching Kilmarnock, then switch your
thoughts towards Falkirk, but when you turn up at Firhill and there is
no sight of the Jags, it is maybe time to have a wee lie down.
The realisation that we were watching a Lanarkshire derby taking place
in Maryhill did not do much to ease the bewilderment, especially when
Hamilton don't play at Hamilton and Airdrie have left Airdrie.
Then, when the team apparently chasing promotion gets turned over by
the team in sixth place, and Sandy Clark, a stalwart Airdrie man who
used to be manager at Firhill, appears in the Hamilton dug-out, your
reporter is inclined to think he has wandered into the Cuckoo's Nest.
At least the Accies wore the familiar old red and white hoops. The
Diamonds were geared up in a slick pale blue outfit, but they were
anything but slick on the park.
Hamilton, on the other hand, were in good shape, especially that of
David Lorimer who showed a lot of promising skills on the left wing. The
young man, who will be 21 at the end of the month, chose the right
moment to do his stuff, with a fair number of displaced premier men
scattered around the stand.
Sandy Clark, appointed at the weekend to join Iain Munro in the
management team, will have been pleased with what he saw of young
Lorimer whose legs were heavy indeed when he was replaced 13 minutes
from the end.
In fact, on this single assessment, Accies looked more plausible
promotion candidates than Alex MacDonald's men, but maybe we saw Airdrie
on a bad day. Their holiday record, one point out of the nine available,
however, suggests the wheels have come off for the moment.
They beat Hamilton 6-2 on the same pitch in August. Either they have
lost their way or Accies have made dramatic improvement. Perhaps a
little of both would be accurate.
Hamilton might well make more progess towards the top end of the table
if Lorimer, Peter Duffield and Paul Chalmers can maintain their form.
Duffield is one of those busy strikers who pester defences, and has
decent control, too. He knows the road to goal.
Chalmers, who has always been a good leader, scored the goal of the
day to erase any possibility of an Airdrie come-back.
That was in 71 minutes when he received a long crossfield pass from
Steve Renicks, juggled it for a second, lofted it over Sandy Stewart and
then, from 25 yards, hit a perfect shot low past John Martin.
At that point, Airdrie had been working very hard to get back into the
game after losing two first half goals. The first also involved Chalmers
and Renicks, whose cross was headed on by the striker to Duffield, and
he headed the ball into the net.
Just before the interval Accies scored with a second header, this time
Martin McIntosh outjumping everyone to head past Martin.
Airdrie did some good things early in the seond half but the fact that
they had to go for broke left them vulnerable to the breakway and Accies
had a few good tries before they scored. Duffield missed one great
opportunity when Chalmers put him clear, for example, although it was
not as glaring a blunder as the miss by Airdrie sub, Andy Smith, who
smacked the ball over from about eight yards.
And, when Allan Ferguson halted another Andy Smith try at close range,
Airdrie knew it was not to be their day. Some of us knew how they felt.

St Mirren 0, Clydebank 0
SAINTS were denied victory by a combination of excellent goalkeeping
from Clydebank's Gary Matthews, and careless finishing by their own
strikers. And the end result for both sides leaves them deep in the
dogfight to avoid relegation from the first division.
And it makes Saturday's match for Saints against Ayr United at
Somerset Park a vital affair this early in the season.
Played throughout on a deplorable flint-like surface, the home side
started in control thanks to midfield supremacy and good service from
John Hewitt and James Dick, and they should have had the points
comfortably sewn up in the opening 20 minutes.
Twice Ricky Gillies tested Matthews with powerful drives, and Hewitt
fired a 20-yarder just over the bar.
Striker Barry Lavety then came into things with three net bound
efforts, two of which brought out magnificent saves from Matthews whilst
he could only watch in frustration as his third effort was blocked on
the line and cleared by John McStay.
The best first half chance certainly fell to Gillies just before the
break when, following a one-two with Lavety, he found himself well clear
of Bankies defence. Sadly for Saints, he shot into the side net when it
looked easier to score.
The nearest the visitors came to breaking the deadlock arrived midway
in the half following a couple of defensive slips by Martin Baker and
Norrie McWhirter, but Alan Combe in the Paisley goal saved.
On the resumption Saints again dominated with further scoring chances
falling to Lavety, Gillies, John Boyd and David Elliot but once again
Matthews and his defence repelled all attempts.
The intensity and effort of this cracking encounter was confirmed by
the five yellow cards issued. The recipients were Gillies and Boyd of
Saints and Scott Murdoch, John Walker and James Grady of Clydebank.
ST MIRREN -- Combe, Dawson, Baker, McWhirter, Watson, Boyd, Dick, R
Gillies, Lavety, Hewitt, Elliot. Substitutes -- Hetherston, K Gillies,
Scrimgeour.
CLYDEBANK -- Matthews, McStay, Bowman, Murdoch, Sweeney, Currie,
Walker, Agnew, Kerrigan, Flannigan, Jack. Substitutes -- Cooper, Grady,
Monaghan.
Referee -- R Orr (Kilbarchan).

Stranraer 2, Ayr United 0
STRANRAER brought in the New Year with their second victory in three
days, which takes them off the bottom of the first division table for
the first time since the end of September. Ayr, however, now prop up the
league.
The visitors started strongly and after only three minutes Cameron
Connie split the Stranraer defence with a low cross which found no
takers.
Ayr kept up the pressure, and John Sharples had a strong header from
close range held on the line by Steve Ross.
Despite Ayr's territorial advantage, however, it was to prove the only
real save of the half for the keeper.
Stranraer seemed quite happy to let Ayr make most of the running, and
on their few raids upfield, they carried more threat than their
visitors.
Lex Grant was off target with a lob after Tony Gallagher had sent him
free on the right, and Gallagher himself had a strong header well held
by Cammy Duncan. But it was Gallagher in 36 minutes who opened the
scoring. Graham Duncan sent the big defender down the right and he cut
in neatly to beat Duncan from a tight angle.
Ayr were just as determined after the break to keep the play again,
but their ideas up front still failed to trouble Ross, and Stranraer
twice came close to finding the target again. Tommy Sloan was on his own
after clever work by Grant but completely missed a great chance in front
of goal, then a minute later Sloan had the Ayr defence in a tangle as
his shot shaved the wrong side of a post.
The writing was on the wall and 14 minutes from the end a lightning
move from deep in defence saw Henderson send Grant through the middle
with a clever pass. Grant held off a strong tackle and cracked the ball
low into the corner of the net to finish the contest.
Ayr tried hard to salvage something in the last few minutes but their
efforts to a chorus of abuse directed at manager Simon Stainrod from
their supporters never looked like producing anything.
STRANRAER -- Ross, McCann, Hughes, Gallgher, Brannigan, Howard, Sloan,
Grant, Duncan, Reilly, Henderson. Substitutes -- Ferguson, Walker,
Duffy.
AYR UNITED -- Duncan, McKilligan, Connie, Hood, Rolling, Sharples,
Gribben, George, Gilzean, Dowe, Gorgues. Substitutes -- Jackson, Moore,
McIntosh.
Referee -- J D K Smith (Troon)

FIVE tractors, an number of players, and an army of residents of
Kiltarlity came together yesterday to ensure that shinty's first game of
the year, the annual challenge match for the Lovat Cup, could take
place.
Originally, the game had been scheduled for Braeview Park, Beauly, but
conditions there proved too much for play.
Beauly started as cup-holders, having won the trophy when it was last
played for two years ago. And they reached half-time a goal ahead thanks
to a strike by Colin MacRae after 38 minutes.
Eleven minutes after the restart Lovat equalised through a disputed
goal.
Beauly, however, regained the lead seven minutes later when Fraser
MacRae fired the ball home from 30 yards.
Two minutes later the game appeared dead as a contest when Calum Bain,
Beauly's captain, made it 3-1.
But Lovat were far from finished and they gainedthe upper hand when
Beauly's Jamie MacLennan was sent off after 69 minutes. Dave Michie
reduced the deficit when he latched on to a rebound after a shot from
Allan MacRae had been saved.
Ten minutes from time, Lovat substitute Stuart Munro restored parity
and Lovat came within a whisker of pulling off a dramatic victory when
John MacRitchie hit the bar with the last hit of the game.
Beauly retain the trophy by virtue that they started as holders.

East Fife 4, Brechin City 0
TEN-MAN Brechin were frozen out as the fired-up Fifers provided a goal
feast at Bayview.
Victory took them up to second place in the second division, a point
behind Stenhousemuir and above Berwick on goal difference.
Bottom club Brechin were handicapped in 28 minutes when goalkeeper
David Lawrie was sent off for handling outside his area.
Fife took full advantage and in 35 minutes Dougie Hope's corner was
headed powerfully past replacement keeper Derek Balfour by Alan Sneddon.
Five minutes later John Cusick got on the end of a lob from
player-manager Steve Archibald to poke the ball past the advancing
keeper.
Eight minutes into the second half came a Mark Donaghy tap-in
following a good run by Robert Scott, and Ron Hildersley made it four in
67 minutes with a powerful low drive from the edge of the box.
Montrose 1, Cowdenbeath 2
COWDENBEATH stepped up their challenge in the third division after a
2-1 victory over second-placed Montrose.
The home side began well, with Mark Haro heading a MacRonald cross
just over in the first minute, and just four minutes later Paul Masson
opened the scoring when he pounced on a Kennedy cross.
Cowden were on level terms in 24 minutes after Derek Grant had pulled
down Graeme Soutar inside the box. Scotland's leading goal-scorer, Mark
Yardley, stepped up to score his nineteenth league goal of the season --
and No.23 in all competitions.
Yardley scored again eight minutes from the break. Innes MacDonald was
judged to have halted Stuart Wardell's progress and although David
Larter saved Yardley's spot-kick, the striker hit the rebound into the
net.
Cowdenbeath's Malloy was sent off in the final minute after a second
bookable offence.
Queen's Park 0, Albion Rovs 0
IT LOOKS like being a long year for the rival sets of fans.
The Coatbridge side had the best chance six minutes after the break. A
great run and cross by Martin Scott set up Scott Miller, who dummied the
ball and it ran into the path of Billy Dolan, but he blazed high over.
Dom Callan's 25-yard drive in 74 minutes was the closest the home side
came to scoring.
Ross County 3,
Caledonian Thistle 1
COUNTY dumped arch-rivals Caley Thistle for the first time in a
Scottish League game to leapfrog over them in the table.
They had the fans to thank for a good start to the new year after an
army of volunteer fans and ground staff worked all morning to clear a
deep snow cover off Victoria Park.
All their work was rewarded as County sharp-shooters Jamie MacPherson
and Brian Grant, with a double, struck in the second half.
But Caley warmed to the occasion first, and Paul MacKenzie twice came
close with shots. They took the lead in 21 minutes when Robbie
Williamson pushed Alan Hercher in the box and defender Mike Andrew
scored from the spot for the second game running.
The home fans in the 2500 crowd had something to cheer 10 minutes
after the interval. Gordon Connelly flighted over a perfect free kick
and MacPherson headed his first goal since returning from a three-month
injury lay-off.
Brian Grant then ripped Caley apart with a double within two minutes.
He ran straight through the middle to drill home in 73 minutes and then
cheekily deflected a Billy Ferries shot to wrong-foot keeper Mark
McRitchie.

SCOTTISH racegoers were dealt a bitter blow yesterday with the
abandonment within the space of six hours of the New Year holiday
meetings at Ayr and Edinburgh.
Yesterday's meeting at Ayr was called off after a 6.45 am inspection
offered no prospect of the course thawing out with overnight
temperatures dipping to minus six degrees.
Clerk of the course Sam Morshead then drove to Musselburgh where he
and the stewards had no option but to abandon today's meeting two hours
before the scheduled inspection because the frost was so severe and no
thaw was forecast.
Since December 15 when Kelso was abandoned, three Scottish meetings
have been lost to the weather.
The abandonment of today's meeting at Musselburgh was especially
disappointing for general manager Mark Kershaw and his staff as it was
the only National Hunt meeting scheduled for the whole of Britian.
It had attracted a field of 86 runners for the seven races and
champion jockey Richard Dunwoody was coming north for five booked rides.
The weather also wreaked havoc down south with only the meetings at
Exeter and Southwell beating the frost.
With the cards at Catterick, Leicester, and Market Rasen being
abandoned on Sunday, the fixtures at Cheltenham and Windsor followed
suit.
Cheltenham, featuring the ASW Handicap Chase, was due to have been
covered for the first time by Channel 4 television, who had won the
contract from the BBC.
However, after an 8am inspection, clerk of the course Philip Arkwright
pronounced the course unraceable.
Channel 4 was also due to cover three races at Windsor.

PHILIP Hobbs, already happy that Exeter had survived the weather this
afternoon, was even more pleased when Greenhil Tare Away landed the
David Garett Memorial Gold Challenge Trophy Novices Chase' in the hands
of his jockey brother, Peter.
The Oats gelding, described as ''still a big green baby'' by the
trainer, overcame a monumental blunder at the second to lead four fences
later before scoring by 10 lengths from Shamarphil.
''We will have to think about upping him in class now,'' said Hobbs,
still eyeing the Sun Alliance Chase for the seven-year-old.
David Gandolfo's Trying Again with Richard Dunwoody, switching from
Cheltenham, followed up his Kempton victory with an easy success for the
Haldon Sunday Market Handicap Hurdle.
Crystal Kone fell at the first hurdle in the opening Upton Selling
Handicap bringing down Mecado.
The former's rider, Willie McFarlane, was brought back unconscious and
taken to the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital for X-rays on his head and
neck.
Mekado's partner, Michael Molloy, sustained a suspected broken
collarbone.
The race was won by Nigel Twiston-Davies' Star Market.

By WHITE and GOLD
RAWYA can take a rare step in the limelight with success in the first
division of the Daily Star AWT Challenge Handicap today at Lingfield.
No household names contest the seven-race card where it is horses of
the calibre of Rawya who keep the show going.
She has not turned out the good-class performer her winning debut as a
two-year-old suggested that she might.
But there is no doubt that there are more races to be won with her
judged on her performance on this course in November.
She ran a fine second to Piquant in a one-mile handicap, putting in
all her best work at the finish.
Rawya will relish this step up to a mile-and-a-quarter and looks set
to resume winning ways.
Captain Marmalade is none too easy a ride and sometimes gives himself
too much to do in his races.
But he is certainly in good heart judged on a running-on third to the
bang in-form South Eastern Fred here on his final start last year.
He is worth taking a chance on in the closing Shakespeare Amateur
Riders' Handicap.
Wicklow Boy took time to find his form in 1994 when he showed little
until his fourth to Carlton Express in a mile-and-a-half race here last
month.
The gelding stayed on best of all from a long way off the pace that
day and is likely to benefit from the two miles in the Shelley Handicap.
The Wordsworth Limited Stakes is best left to Battleship Bruce whose
shrewd trainer Neville Callaghan has laid him out for a quick double at
Lingfield.

SCORING ace Alan Shearer blasted Blackburn six points clear at the top
of the FA Carling Premiership.
The England striker grabbed a hat trick, taking his season's tally to
23, as the title favourites beat West Ham 4-2 in a see-saw match. Two of
his goals came from the penalty spot, the first after 14 minutes.
West Ham equalised through Tony Cottee's sixth goal in five games and
took the lead via Julian Dicks, but Graeme Le Saux's free kick and two
more goals from Shearer, the second from the spot, clinched victory.
Blackburn are now 8-13 favourites with William Hill to win the title,
with Manchester United at 7-4, Liverpool 13-2, Newcastle 20-1, and
Nottingham Forest 66-1.
Robbie Fowler netted two goals in Liverpool's 4-0 win over Norwich,
their fourth victory in four holiday games, to boost his season's tally
to 22.
John Scales headed in from a corner after 15 minutes. Fowler, latching
on to Ian Rush's pass, then put the ball between keeper Andy Marshall's
legs. He scored again two minutes into the second half and Rush
completed the rout seven minutes from time. Norwich manager John Deehan
immediately tipped Liverpool as title challengers.
Andy Dibble saved a Ruel Fox penalty as Newcastle slipped out of the
top four with a 0-0 draw at home to Manchester City.
Nottingham Forest moved up into fourth place when Gary Bull --
deputising for the injured Stan Collymore -- got the only goal against
Crystal Palace, who now are scoreless for nine successive games.
Endsleigh League title contenders Wolves came back from the dead to
salvage a point against fellow first division heavyweights Sheffield
United at packed Molineux.
With a minute remaining, Graham Taylor's side were trailing by two
goals from Nathan Blake. But Dutch internationalist John de Wolf put
away a spot-kick and, in injury time, Robbie Dennison's cross was headed
in by Neil Emblen.
The draw leaves Wolves four points behind leaders Middlesbrough, who
led Barnsley 2-1 at half-time when the match was abandoned because of a
dangerously frozen pitch.

BRITAIN'S top volleyball players need to train more and play more if
the gap is to be closed on the rest of Europe.
That was the conclusion after Great Britain men's team lost all three
challenge matches to Greek side Panathinaikos in Athens.
The British squad had taken advantage of a break in the competitive
season to spend a few days in Greece and, while the trip was invaluable
in terms of building for the second half of the season, there clearly is
still some work to be done to close the gap on the top club sides in
Europe.
''The Greeks were shocked at the amount of knowledge we had about the
game, but where we fell down was our physical presence. I've never seen
a volleyball hit as hard as the Greeks were doing,'' said Great Britain
assistant coach Tommy Dowens.
''But it was an invaluable trip at this time of year and it showed we
need more matches and need to be physically stronger to compete at this
level. These players are training twice a day and Panathinaikos work
with a budget of $1m a year.''
Dowens believes the British game must work on producing more
high-calibre players and feels the responsibility should lie with the
clubs. ''There is no doubt the British team has made astonishing
progress considering the lack of finance there is for the game in this
country,'' he observed.
''But the British team is still too fragile. We rely too heavily on
two or three players to function as a team. We need to produce more
back-up.''

THE only premier-division match to survive the weather had the makings
of a decent contest, but neither Dundee United nor Aberdeen offered much
to suggest that their supporters were more fortunate than any others in
the country.
In fact, many of them might have headed for home wondering why they
had bothered to step outdoors in the first place.
United's fans, who formed the majority of the 10,560 crowd, probably
wanted to see if their side could recover from the humiliation of
Saturday when Hibernian had given them a going over, while the people
from Aberdeen may have arrived in Dundee believing their side were about
to begin a push towards the proper end of the premier division after a
good weekend win.
Duncan Shearer resumed normal service by scoring twice in the 3-1 win
against Hearts, but yesterday there was nothing save a few half chances.
It was dull, although the players ran around a lot, and apart from the
appearance of Roy Aitken as a second half substitute, the match
contained little by way of genuine entertainment or interest.
Yet, United's determination to make up for their dreadful performance
on Saturday was evident early on as the players pushed forward seeking
an early goal which would have settled them while undermining Aberdeen.
Inevitably, with Jim McInally, who has been out of favour since
October, back in the side to bolster the midfield, the Tannadice side
work rate increased significantly.
However, Aberdeen were not without threat, and had a lively looking
attack, with Joe Miller, Duncan Shearer, and Billy Dodds always likely
to threaten, and United's defence seemed to be overly wary of these
players when, in 24 minutes, Gordan Petric and Gary Bollan collided
while trying to clear the same ball.
The pair had a brief exchange of angry words before settling back into
their routines.
A Petric pass across 30 yards of turf dropped inside Aberdeen's box,
and keeper Theo Snelders had to rush off his line to collect the ball
just as Craig Brewster lunged in. Snelders was annoyed that Gary Smith
had given up the chase and scolded the central defender before clearing
the ball.
Two arguments, and not a lot of thrilling football. Can we really
expect football in the new year to be any more exciting than it was in
'94? We can but hope.
Paul Kane was hopeful that his enticing ball played across the face of
United's goal would have been directed into the net either by Dodds or
Shearer, but both arrived too late. There were no other real
opportunities in the first half.
The second period was only four minutes old when Stewart McKimmie went
off, presumably still feeling the effects of a shuddering challenge by
Maurice Malpas towards the end of the first half, and assistant manager
Aitken took over in defence.
It was Aitken's first domestic appearance since May last year against
Hearts, and the 36-year-old spent a great deal of his time on the pitch
directing those around him and trying to get them to push forward.
When they did, Bollan halted their progress by checking Dodds' run in
a crude manner and it was no surprise when the referee produced a yellow
card. United took off Paddy Connolly and sent on Robbie Winter, but
Aberdeen were the more dangerous side, and Kelham O'Hanlon made a good
save from Dodds in 70 minutes.
Ray McKinnon was cautioned after he had held on to McInally's jersey
as the United player was trying to make progress on the left, and
another of United's ageing heroes, Malpas, tried a volley from 20 yards
which demanded a good save from Snelders.
Craig Brewster, who had been booked for a foul on John Inglis, soon
afterwards was taken off with his place going to Jerren Nixon. A minute
later Shearer was taken off and Aberdeen sent on Eoin Jess.
United almost scored five minutes from time when Winter and Smith
collided in the air, and the ball broke to David Hannah, but he knocked
it over the bar and then, only two minutes later, Nixon thumped Winter's
delivery into the middle of Aberdeen's box wildly over the top.
Before the end, Brian Grant did the same at the other end just as the
supporters were beginning to drift away. If the truth be told, they
probably knew long before the closing minutes that there would be no
scoring. It had not been a game to savour.
DUNDEE UNITED -- O'Hanlon, Cleland, Malpas, Hannah, Petric, Bollan,
Bowman, McInally, Connolly, Brewster, Dailly. Substitutes -- Winters,
Nixon, Jorgensen.
ABERDEEN -- Snelders, McKimmie, Wright, Kane, Inglis, Smith, Grant,
Shearer, Miller, Dodds, McKinnon. Substitutes -- Aitken, Jess, Watt.
Referee - W Crombie (Edinburgh).

UK pension funds last year suffered one of their weakest performances
for 20 years, with a return of minus 4%, according to an initial survey
by Edinburgh-based WM Company which measures the investment performance
of over 1900 UK pension funds controlling assets of #380bn.
However, the good performance achieved in 1993 means that the two year
picture is positive, with a return of 11% per year when inflation has
been averaging just 2% per year.
Despite negative returns in 1994, pension fund finances will benefit
from the growth in investment income from equity dividends and bonds.
Peter Warrington, a director of WM Company says the lacklustre 1994
performance must be viewed in context. He said it was only the second
year that negative returns have been produced since recognised
measurement of funds began in 1975. ''What is more important is that the
longer term real returns over a 10 and 20 year period remain high at 7%
and 8% respectively.''
Most of the action in pension funds was in UK property and,
negatively, bonds last year, with UK equities (making up the largest
slice of the pension fund cake with 54%) having a relatively uneventful
year.
UK property was the star performer with returns of around 13%, a
result far in excess of other asset classes. Those pension funds with
little or no property can expect returns of minus 5%. However, there was
still a reluctance to commit funds to this sector.
Substantial cash flow into UK bonds was a major feature of 1994, with
the sector attracting the bulk of net investment in contrast to recent
years. It was the first increase in UK bond exposure since 1977. Despite
this inflow, UK bonds were the lowest performing asset class with a
return of minus 10%, the poorest result in this sector since 1975 and
the first negative return since 1978.
Overseas equities, in sparkling form in 1993, surrendered some of
their gains, with an overall return of minus 2%. Japan was the
exception, performing strongly.
The combination of negative returns and marginal cash flow reduced UK
equity exposure by 2%. Pension funds, after beating the index early in
the year, fell behind to produce an annual return of minus 6%.
* ANNUAL bonuses on conventional with profit life policies have been
cut from 4% to 3.75% on the sum assured by General Accident Life but
have been maintained at 6.75% on bonuses already declared.
Chief Actuary and assistant general manager Mike Urmston explained,
''The small reduction in annual bonuses on conventional with profit
business refelcts a gradual recognision of reduced investment returns
and lower inflation in the 1990s.''

Traverse audiences will have seen seven visiting companies by the time
its first full production of 1995 opens. Mark Fisher looks at the
Edinburgh theatre's spring programme.
THE classical actress Edith Evans once said: ''God was very good to
me. He never let me go on tour.''
Life on the road may not be the career of choice for the acting
profession, but without the short stay and the one-night stand our
theatres would be a lot less interesting. This is obviously true of the
big receiving houses where the only in-house work is the annual
pantomime, but even somewhere like Edinburgh's Traverse Theatre, which
would be nothing without its reputation for putting on its own plays,
actually spends most of the year hosting a procession of touring
productions.
The theatre's spring season is a case in point. By the time the first
full Traverse production of 1995 opens in March, audiences will have
been able to enjoy no fewer than seven outside companies, not to mention
the ongoing programme of readings, workshops, and discussions. A further
five shows are squeezed in before the second production opens in May.
In some respects this is a more favourable ratio than at one time,
when Traverse productions were bunched together in the summer months,
ready to take the Edinburgh Festival by force. In recent seasons, and
certainly since the company moved to its Cambridge Street premises in
1992, artistic director Ian Brown has been working towards giving
theatregoers a sense that the Traverse is home to a steady stream of
creativity.
The season opens on Thursday, January 19, with the latest in a line of
one-man shows by ace raconteur Ken Campbell. Mystery Bruises is the
spin-off from a forthcoming Channel 4 series, Reality on the Rocks, in
which Campbell is the layman quizzing top scientists about their ideas.
Much to his amusement, the outer reaches of contemporary science turn
out to be more bizarre than any of the oddball phenomena he has charted
in his own wayward career. He was first to stage The Hitch-hiker's Guide
to the Galaxy, while 1993's Jamais Vu was about the opposite of deja vu.
''I'm a quantum mechanic now,'' he claims rather unfeasibly. ''I've
always avoided it because I can't even fix my car, so I thought quantum
mechanics would be way beyond me. But I rather fell in love with it.
''In Mystery Bruises, first of all I deal with anomalies out of the
Fortean Times and The Unexplained and all that, but then it turns out
that if you get into the proper scientific field it is way weirder!''
More one-man shows follow as Guy Masterson performs a single-handed
version of Animal Farm (last year he did a highly effective solo Under
Milk Wood), and playwright David Greig comes up with One Way Street
about the philosopher Walter Benjamin for his Suspect Culture Company.
There are also visits by disabled company Graeae with a production of
Alfred Jarry's Ubu, and the British premiere of A L Kennedy's adaptation
of Salman Rushdie's Haroun and the Sea of Stories for Benchtours, before
the stage sees a home-grown show.
The first Traverse production of the year, opening at the start of
March, is Marisal by Jose Rivera, a 39-year-old American playwright of
Puerto Rican descent who has lived in America since the age of four.
When I met him in 1993, he told me he had grown up learning about
writers like Miller, Chekhov, Shaw, and Ibsen, and only in later life
did the existence of Puerto Rican literature dawn on him.
''It was discovering the writers of South America that made me realise
that I had this other tradition and I didn't have to become a clone of
Tennessee Williams,'' he said. His plays reflect the experiences of
American Latinos through a veil of magical realism. In Marisal, the real
and the surreal merge in a tale of a Puerto Rican woman brought up in
the Bronx, who reads in the daily paper about what appears to be her own
brutal murder.
The Traverse has a commitment to presenting the best of both foreign
and Scottish work, and bringing us closer to home in May is The
Collection. This is only the second stage play by Mike Cullen, whose
debut drama The Cut, a hit for Wiseguise Theatre Company, is being made
into a film and is to be published by Methuen.
Cullen, who previously worked in the mining industry, was originally
taken up by the Tron Theatre and its mentoring scheme and is now being
welcomed as an engaging new voice in Scottish theatre. Like Marisal, The
Collection hinges on a death; this time the suicide of a
debt-collector's client, an event that sends the hardened moneymen on a
guilt-ridden journey of obsession.
Such fully-fledged productions don't drop out of the sky, and it is in
seasons like this that you can see the ground being laid for the hit
shows of tomorrow. Since the appointment two years ago of Ella Wildridge
as the theatre's dramaturg, there has been a coherent programme of
readings and workshops that allow playwrights to dip their toes into the
water before returning to dry land for further refinements.
David Greig's play Europe, which went on in November, was a
beneficiary of this process, while The Collection was workshopped in
private before Christmas, and Marisal was aired in the presence of the
author at a Windows on the World session in 1993.
That process continues with free performed readings on the first
Tuesday of each month, which appropriately include the latest play by
Jose Rivera, Cloud Tectonics.

Certain accusations must be refuted at all costs. But John Linklater
will admit to hanging around back stage and being a theatre groupie
PEOPLE call me a stage-door Johnny. That's ridiculous. The stage-door
Johnny is long extinct, a louche character emerging from the theatre
lane shadows with black cape, top hat and silver-knobbed cane. A
backhander to the man at the box and he was through to the dressing
rooms with his bouquet and his champagne to drink from an actress's
slipper. In other words, a sort of Edwardian brothel creeper.
Not my style. I'm just a theatre groupie who got a job as a stagehand.
When the Tmu-Na company of Tel Aviv finished their run at the Tron
Theatre, Glasgow, last month, everyone knew that I'd be going with them.
I've been madly in love with the company for four years since I first
saw them at the Edinburgh Festival. As a theatre critic, I was as
unequivocal a supporter as it was possible to be without owning up to
being their one-man publicity department.
There have been the television and radio interviews I have done to
discuss their work. Then there is: ''Extracted from an article by John
Linklater, in The Herald.'' ''Extracted from an interview with Nava
Zukerman by John Linklater, in The Herald.'' That is the way my stuff
was presented in the Tmu-Na programme for their new show Transit Hotel
when it reached Manchester's season of Israeli theatre in the City of
Drama Festival. It was supposed to be an official world premiere, but
Glasgow had already seen it. Coincidence?
I don't think so. You see, we have become a branch of the Tmu-Na
family here. Artistic director Nava Zukerman is godmother to our son. He
was conceived when Tmu-Na were last in Glasgow for Mayfest 1993 and I
think my partner is planning to marry Jackie Sunshine, the lighting
designer. We are close. All of us.
In Glasgow, I was more or less free to define my own job with the
company. This involved giving rapt attention to every performance (bar
one when we couldn't get a babysitter), choosing a different viewing
angle each night from within the auditorium, sitting bolt forward and
trying to energise the performance, not that it needed much more
energising. The other duty, self-imposed, was running backstage
afterwards to give everyone big hugs. Since there are six female and
three male performers, that's a lot of big hugging.
And telephone calls when they left for Manchester. They were not
enjoying Manchester. ''When are you coming?'' asked Ilan Rosenthal, the
managing director. ''We are all waiting for you.'' I organised a week's
holiday and caught up with them after they flew to Ireland for the
Belfast Festival. They had insisted to the festival organisers that I
was a member of the company, so I shared the accommodation.
But how to justify it? Flatteringly, Nava Zukerman had adopted a few
of the directing ideas I had tentatively suggested for what was a brand
new show, developing with each night's performance and each day's
continuing rehearsal process. Even so, it was far too late to join a
piece that had been developing over nine months in the studio at Tel
Aviv as a co-director. I needed a personal involvement.
They made me a stagehand. Ilan Rosenthal said I was the assistant
stage manager, but that was a bit inflated as a designation. If you want
to know the truth, I became a dresser.
You can laugh as much as you like over your stereotypes of the
dresser, Tom Courtenay's deft touch with the powderpuff as he persuades
Albert Finney that it is Lear and not Othello he is billed to play that
night in the film The Dresser, but I can tell you that the job has a lot
going for it.
Okay, zipping and unzipping dresses is a special art when it has to be
done quickly, efficiently, and unobstrusively. If I was obsessed with
naked female flesh I'd still be watching from out front, and backstage
you are working with the professional detachment of a gynaecologist or a
masseur. Let's try and be adult about this.
I have a series of cues. I take a dress that has been hastily
discarded, turn it back to right side out and hang it up carefully. I
have a nightdress open for the actress to step into and I have a coat
ready from its hanger to go over that. I have other things besides
clothes: a balloon to hand over, ready blown; a pair of stilts; 12
candles freshly lit; a trolley of baggage to store; a white sheet to
stow away; six chairs to receive in the wings from actors; and I have my
towel folded over my belt ready to wipe sweating bodies.
What you see backstage is the physical effort of the actors, their
breathlessness as they have been running a steeplechase, their sheer
emotional expenditure, their fight to win space and time for their next
entrance, their extraordinary concentration and focus of supreme effort.
It becomes like another show, an intense mime full of signals and
urgent activity while, somewhere off this stage and glimpsed obliquely,
another play is being performed in front of another audience.
This backstage version is an inverted drama in which those who have
exited are on, and those who enter are off. It is a fascinating
revelation of the mechanism of a performance, like taking the back off a
watch to examine the interlocking mechanism of wheels and coils and
springs.
No stage-door Johnny slipped as close as this to theatre between the
dressing rooms and the backdrop. I have been there. I loved it. Call me
what you like.

The boys shout out the answers, the girls wait patiently to be asked.
Could this really be symbolic of a more serious problem? Ros Davidson
investigates sexual harassment in the traumatic teenage years
ONE of my earliest glimpses of the entry into womanhood was when I was
still at primary school in Aberdeenshire. Every so often, the word would
go out on the playground that a ''strip'' was imminent. Even the
littlest children would gather as a gang of secondary school boys
assaulted an attractive teenage girl, tearing her clothes off as she
fought and screamed.
Since the headmaster always intervened, no-one knew what might have
happened otherwise. But I will never forget seeing, albeit about 25
years ago, a schoolgirl aged 14 years old in her white bra and pants
struggling as boys sexually attacked her and others watched.
Being an adolescent girl is apparently still as hard for many today.
Girls have role models and may progress farther in a career, but
equality remains disturbingly elusive.
As recent studies have shown, girls are still taught to curtail
themselves and to fear, while also grappling with the abyss of
adolescence and the beginnings of adulthood. They learn that power, even
in the 1990s, is still conferred disproportionately by gender.
The picture has admittedly become more complex. For American girls at
least, some things are getting worse. The frequency of eating disorders
is rising sharply, especially among those destined for college, who are
presumably most confused about their future roles. Yet the gap between
the maths scores for female and male pupils in the US has halved since
1974.
Still, what can be a tragic transition from girlhood to womanhood
became headline news in the US in early 1991. In the most extensive
survey ever on confidence and gender, by the American Association of
University Women, 3,000 boys and girls aged nine to 15 were questioned
about attitudes to self, school, family and friends.
Its findings were depressingly familiar. Most of the girls had a
plummeting self-esteem in early adolescence from which they seldom
recovered. In contrast, boys usually retained their hopes and dreams,
and if they lost confidence they often regained it.
The study also illustrated the difference between America's ethnic
groups. White girls' self-esteem dropped far more deeply than that of
black girls, whose tradition is more of strong women. But those who
fared worst were Hispanics, whose culture is more macho.
After reading the reports, Peggy Orenstein, a 32-year-old magazine
writer, decided to find out how exactly girls were still conditioned
despite changes of the past two decades. She spent a year with
13-year-old girls at two mixed state schools near San Francisco,
chronicling how they dumb themselves down to become popular, pretty and
polite. At root, she argues, are traditional deeply entrenched views of
femininity.
One school, pseudonymously named Weston Middle School, caters to the
white, middle-class. At Audubon Middle High, most youngsters are poor
and African-American or Latino. Still, her subjects are from a broad
ethnic, family and academic spectrum. The resulting book Schoolgirls is
uncomfortable reading.
She found girls timid and less demanding than boys, garnering less
attention in class even from teachers trying to be fair. They were
encouraged less often, and were less confident about their capabilities
and future.
Nate, one of the boys, simply says: ''I think my opinions are so
important, so I yell them out . . . Girls will sit there until the bell
rings with their hands up.''
At both schools, girls underwent appalling sexual harassment.
California introduced an innovative law in 1993 requiring schools to
disseminate written harassment policies to staff and pupils. But the
author found the law toothless, seldom enforced and impotent against
attitudes that permeate the school system and society.
Many of the girls at the more-white school were obsessed with diet,
which for Orenstein brought up her own teenage anorexia. In one telling
incident, the author relates how one girl reprimanded another for
dropping an empty crisp bag. The accused said: ''Well, I didn't litter.
I don't eat.'' The first seemed impressed: ''Wow! I don't eat either!''
At the inner-city school, the picture seems even more bleak.
Orenstein finds ''the children learn a more comprehensive lesson: that
for them, power will not be conferred at all''. April, an
African-America with a prostitute mother on crack, stuffs her ears with
socks at night to drown out the sounds from her mother's room. And April
cannot yet add or subtract. Another, LaRhonda, dropped out to care for
her younger siblings while her single mother worked.
One ray of hope emerges in Judy Logan, who teaches at Everett Middle
School in San Francisco, the only character whose real name is used. She
decorates her classroom with pictures of famous women and regularly asks
her pupils to imagine, in a play or essay, they are of the opposite sex
or another ethnicity.
Orenstein saw boys becoming sensitised, although some of the girls
also worried that boys would feel ostracised.
Oddly, Orenstein discounts single-sex schools. She says girls and boys
must iron out their problems together. She also implies, in response to
a question, that those who advocate all-girl schools assume females are
better. And she cites, to bolster her case, a recent New York Times poll
that girls see themselves as equal while boys see themselves as
superior.
It's infuriating, when some girls seem to benefit from such a set-up.
I recall my all-girls school in Edinburgh. Although I hated it being
single sex in so many ways, I do not believe so many would have gone on
to medicine or engineering from a mixed school. And judging from the
prejudice reported in Orenstein's book, that might be true today.
Yet the book is so timely, Orenstein has been featured in the People
magazine and criticised as too one-sided in a leader in the Wall Street
Journal. And so compelling are her vignettes, she was even approached to
co-author a book on families with former vice-president Dan Quayle,
still known for his attack on TV's single mother, Murphy Brown.
Orenstein, the former managing editor of a left-wing magazine, recalls:
''The pay didn't sound that good. If you're going to have somebody sell
out their values, you ought to pay them big time for it.''

HOW do you find a holistic therapist? The best bet is personal
recommendation but if that fails you are left to find out through an ad
hoc process ranging from notices in shop windows and libraries to
adverts in newspapers and magazines. In fact the system is totally
unsatisfactory.
A warm welcome, therefore, to the International Register of Holistic
Therapists, just published by the Federation of Holistic Therapists.
Disappointingly, only 11 therapists in Scotland are listed, a
reflection one suspects not of the lack of therapists of suitable
calibre but inertia on their part to register with the federation.
The International Register of Holistic Therapists costs #4 and can be
obtained from some health shops, libraries, and fitness clubs or direct
from the Federation of Holistic Therapists, 38a Portsmouth Road,
Woolston, Southampton, Hampshire SO19 9AD.

PERHAPS He is a playful God after all. On December 6, just as a jury
in Pensacola, Florida, was convicting a former minister of first-degree
murder for the killings of a doctor and his escort outside an abortion
clinic, a serial rapist was singing ''Jesus, I love you'' while being
executed in Huntsville, Texas.
It is likely, of course, that the sort of Americans who oppose
vehemently the extinction by lethal injection of Herman Clark, trilling
as he expired after confessing to upwards of 100 violent sexual
assaults, are the same sort of people who would condemn Paul Hill for
shooting dead a 69-year-old physician and his 74-year-old escort in the
name of the unborn.
Equally, the citizens most likely to join the militant campaign
against abortion are also the Americans who just know in their hearts
that rapists and the like aren't executed often enough. Paul Hill
killed, he said, to save lives, and he did it in a country that
routinely slays criminals by judicial order while protecting the rights
of those Hill (once a minister, first of the Presbyterian Church in
America, then of the Orthodox Presbyterian Church) would call murderers.
In turn, having refused his right to appeal, Paul Hill faces execution.
Hill's Bible told him he should not kill, and his Government said the
same. But his Government, while doing away with Herman Clark, also told
Hill that because abortion is legal in the US he could not argue before
the jury that he had acted to protect life. For good measure, his
Government guaranteed his constitutional right to bear the shotgun with
which he blew away Dr John Bayard Britton and retired Air Force
Lieutenant-Colonel James Barrett. ''May God help you,'' Hill told the
jury, ''to protect the unborn as you would want to be protected.''
Death, life, God, guns, law and politics: with the Hill case the
argument over abortion in the US has left the debating hall. One side
talks of freedom, the other of a holocaust. ''Pro-lifers'' kill and they
do it, they say, because the ''pro-choice'' lobby gives them no choice.
In the land of the free the recently-introduced Freedom of Access to
Clinic Entrances law forbids them even to mount their emotional public
protests outside abortion centres.
A catalogue of bombings, harassment, arson, death threats, vandalism,
and killing may have something to do with that. Dr Britton was not the
first to die -- one reason why he believed he needed an escort. In March
of last year his predecessor, Dr David Gunn, was murdered by a member of
''Operation Rescue'', one Michael Griffin. described in the Wall Street
Journal by the executive director of the Christian Coalition as a
''ticking time-bomb''. Yet Ralph Reed, the executive in question, went
on to blame Griffin's actions on secular society and a ''lack of
respect'' for church-going Americans.
This is odd. According to all research the US is a church-going
country, and socially conservative in the main. The religious right,
having helped to put Reagan into office, is a formidable force. The
anti-abortion campaign is dedicated, well-supported, and well-funded.
What need is there for violence?
The truth would seem to be that despite all efforts of propaganda,
persuasion, and intimidation, the majority of God-fearing Americans are
pro-choice (80% in one recent poll) and have been for two decades.
Even right-wing Republicans have become wary of the combination of
fundamentalism and pro-life rhetoric. The consequence among the
anti-abortionists, it would seem, has been more than a hint of
desperation.
Consider 40-year-old Paul Hill. After passing through two Presbyterian
churches he wound up, in 1992, as a member of the independent Trinity
Presbyterian Church in Valparaiso, Florida. Last year this group asked
him to leave the congregation, largely because of his persistent
advocacy of violence against abortionists. Florida being Florida, this
meant only that Hill became a sought-after guest on the TV talk-show
circuit.
Under the studio lights, another time-bomb began to tick.
Hill led a group, Defensive Action, which issued a statement defending
the murderer of Dr Gunn and declaring ''the justice of taking all godly
action necessary to defend innocent life including the use of force''.
Hill also published a book -- Should We Defend Born and Unborn
Children With Force? -- which became popular in anti-abortion circles,
and foresaw the creation of an anti-abortion ''underground'' pledged to
murder those who ''disobeyed God's laws'' on abortion, homosexuality,
and related ''crimes''.
Hill's book made much of the Biblical story of Phineas and Zimri, he a
priest, she a wife caught with her lover. Phineas, it is said, drove a
spear through the couple where they lay and earned the gratitude of Hill
and like fanatics who believe the tale justifies the killing of sinners,
despite contrary biblical advice.
Interestingly, America's white supremacists and anti-Semites, ranging
from the Ku Klux Klan to the ''Christian Identity Movement'', also use
the story. It is through that link, and other, more sinister
connections, that the militant anti-abortion movement is acquiring a
distinctly unchristian reputation.
As the US journal The Progressive put it recently: ''Religious
zealotry, nostalgia for a more culturally 'pure' America, and a
frightening rhetoric that encourages violence in the name of deeply held
ideals fuels white supremacists and many anti-abortionists alike. It is
not surprising, then, that the membership and leadership of these groups
tend to overlap.''
Thus, in August, the Florida ''Templar Knights'' of the Ku Klux Klan
sponsored a rally in support of Hill. Meanwhile, a spokesman for the
''Aryan Nations'' urged racists to join the anti-abortion struggle,
stating: ''It's part of our Holy War for the pure Aryan race.'' In
Oregon, neo-Nazi members of the ''American Front'' joined Operation
Rescue members blockading clinics.
For good measure, one John Burt, a regional director of Operation
Rescue, is a ''former'' Florida Klansman.
Burt was one of Hill's associates in attempts to ''expose'' Dr Britton
with a ''Wanted'' poster, an old Klan tactic, usually involving the
victim's photograph, address, telephone number, and route to work. The
same method has been used by Randall Terry, founder of Operation Rescue.
Thus, after the White Patriot Party, once part of the KKK, published a
notice stating, ''Jew abortion king Bernard Nathanson, of New York City,
was tried, convicted, and sentenced to death by hanging by a fair and
unbiased jury of the White Patriots on May 19 . . .'' Terry circulated a
similar poster in Alabama. Shortly before Dr Gunn was killed, the
Operation Rescue leader featured him on a poster which stated: ''Wanted:
For Murder and Crimes Against Humanity to Defenceless Unborn Babies.''
Racism, anti-abortion, homophobia, fundamentalism, anti-Communism,
anti-Semitism, anti-welfare, anti-immigration: extreme groups in the US
have found common cause on all these issues and their links, usually
through front organisations like Christian Patriots and Christian
Identity, are well-established. The aim, repeatedly stated, is a white,
Christian revolution.
In this scheme doctors are no more than a ''weak link'', easily
harassed and attacked.
Some American commentators talk now in terms of civil war. On the
issue of abortion, it is said, no compromise seems possible. And since
Operation Rescue and its allies have failed to win over public opinion,
murder -- with all the irony it involves -- has become the last resort.
Yet they see no irony. As David Crane, who heads OR in Virginia, has
said of Paul Hill: ''Who committed the greater crime? The citizens who
stand by and allow the children to be murdered, or this one man who
stopped a serial killer from killing more children?'' Or as the Reverend
Joseph Foreman of ''Missionaries to the Preborn'', based in Milwaukee,
Wisconsin, put it, applying a moral relativism unusual in one professing
his faith: ''We will not be outraged over the one death, and not the
other 4000 precious human beings that were killed today by abortion.''

William Russell accompanies Douglas Hurd to strike-torn Bangladesh
where the Foreign Secretary hopes to assuage Muslim concerns over Bosnia
HAVING left the frying-pan of British politics behind yesterday, the
Foreign Secretary, Mr Doug Hurd, arrives in Dhaka today for a three-day
visit to find himself in what one could well call the fire of
Bangladeshi politics.
Things may be bad for the Government back home, but they are as
nothing compared to the tribulations of his host, Prime Minister Begum
Khaleda Zia. Her three-year-old Government is in deep trouble. Mr Hurd
will find a capital city where life for its six million inhabitants came
to a halt yesterday due to an eight-hour general strike, the first of
three called by the Opposition Party, the Awami League. The second is
scheduled for today, the third tomorrow.
Yesterday's strike was largely peaceful, although tight security was
imposed by the police throughout the city and paramilitary troops were
posted round important government buildings. Half a dozen people were
reportedly injured, however, when pickets set off several small
home-made bombs, and stones were thrown by pickets and security officers
after police tried to break up protest marches.
There was no public transport on the streets, except for a few
rickshaws, most businesses remained shut, domestic flights were delayed,
trains and some river ferries did not run, and the Dhaka Stock Exchange
remained closed. Meanwhile a 24-hour countrywide strike called
separately by the transport workers' union to back demands for higher
wages and job security stranded thousands of people.
The one-day strikes are part of the attempt by the Opposition to force
Prime Minister Khaleda to resign and call early elections. They want her
to allow a caretaker administration to take over while these elections
are organised.
On Sunday, in a television broadcast, Prime Minister Khaleda repeated
the offer she made last Thursday to step down 30 days before the
elections are due in March 1996, handing over power to President Abdur
Rahman Biswas, so that the elections could be held freely. She also
urged the Opposition, which has boycotted Bangladesh's Parliament since
February last year, to return. The Opposition, which holds 151 of the
330 seats in the Parliament, resigned en masse after accusing the
Government of corruption and vote-rigging.
Turning the invitation down, Sheikh Hasina, leader of the Awami
League, called on Prime Minister Khaleda, who leads of the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party, to leave office immediately to make way for early
elections, and dismissed the offer as a ''useless and ineffective ruse
to buy time''.
Despite the Opposition's resignation, the BNP's majority means it can
govern the country without any constitutional problems, and it has
spoken of plans to hold by-elections to fill the vacant seats. But such
action would almost certainly cause more trouble. The Awami League has
said it will not participate in any elections as long as Prime Minister
Khaleda remains in power, and has vowed to resist any attempt to hold
them, raising fears of confrontation and violence.
Since she took power in March 1991, in what were billed as
Bangladesh's first free elections, bringing an end to 16 years of
presidential rule, the Opposition has organised a total of nearly 40
days of general strikes in this poverty-stricken country.
Sheikh Hasina warned the Government last week to prepare for even
tougher protests intended to bring down what he called a ''corrupt and
illegal'' regime. The opposition Chief Whip Mohammad Nasim told
reporters: ''From now on the protests will be relentless. Now we have
only one demand the departure of Khaleda Zia.'' As for Sunday's
broadcast, he said it contained nothing new so there was nothing to
reconsider or think about.
It all makes the antics of the Westminster Nine seem small beer. But
Mr Hurd is not here to get involved in Bangladesh's domestic problems.
The visit, his first as Foreign Secretary, will focus on Britain's aid
programme in Bangladesh, the substantial Bangladeshi community in
Britain -- remittances sent home by Bangladeshis working abroad are a
major factor in the country's economy -- and on international issues,
including the situation in the former Yugoslavia.
In Britain we tend to see the war in Bosnia in terms of our own
contribution to the UN peacekeeping force. But we are not the only
country with troops at risk in UNPROFOR. There are 1154 Bangladeshi
troops in Bihac, where fighting is still going on, currently living off
field rations because of a Serb blockade, and when the UN troops out
operation is launched later this year, as seems likely, their safety
will be every bit as important as those of any other nation's troops in
the force.
Bangladesh is also a Muslim country, and just as in Pakistan, which he
visits later this week, Mr Hurd will be setting out the case for what
the peacemakers are trying to achieve in Bosnia and the role Britain is
playing. It is important that Muslim countries hear more than just the
views of the Bosnian leadership.

AT THE turn of the year one is apt to receive some jolting intimation
of one's mortality. This year my clap of change, ageing, and doom came
in a pleasantly chatty greetings card from a revered former teacher.
With much talk of this and news of that, she observed casually:
''Margaret Goodwin retired in November -- last of the old crew''.
Miss Goodwin had retired! And suddenly my past life swept before me,
and my few remaining years turned to laugh at me; change and decay in
all around I saw. I grow old, I grow old, I shall wear the bottoms of my
trousers rolled . . .
This Miss Goodwin was indeed the last -- as far as I can be sure -- of
my primary teachers who still taught. She was one of the best teachers I
ever had. She was the only primary teacher I had who was actually
younger than my parents. And she was, without question, quite the most
formidable woman I have ever met; to this very day, there is a certain
type of determined female -- the sort you meet in the SNP, or in the BBC
labyrinth of Queen Margaret Drive -- sufficiently reminiscent of her to
reduce me to trembling servitude.
It was a long time ago. It was another world. It was Jordanhill
College School, in the western suburbs of Glasgow, still at that time a
demonstration school attached to the teacher-training establishment. It
was in the mid-seventies, which in the cultural context of the West End
was still the early sixties. We pupils wore immaculate brown uniform.
The wee boys actually had caps and the wee girls horrid little hats kept
on by elastic. And the teachers stalked the corridors and playgrounds in
black gowns. There was morning assembly every morning, by the most
orthodox rites of the Church of Scotland.
Another world. As Jack McLean pointed out to me, many years later,
this was the era when cranks and power-trippers at Jordanhill College
were formulating and unleashing the theories, the methods that have
subsequently done much to destroy Scottish education. But their school
remained -- perhaps as some scientific control -- a bastion of
traditional, God-fearing dedication to the three Rs.
When Miss Goodwin took us, 18 years ago, we had just learned how to
write with nib-pens. Essays done in pencil, approved, had then to be
laboriously transcribed into a copy-book. Miss Goodwin led us chanting
times-tables. Miss Goodwin taught us a little French. Miss Goodwin
devised, and deployed, shattering 20-question tests in mental
arithmetic. We multiplied fractions. We divided fractions. And then
there was English. We parsed. We conjugated. ''Kind, number, gender,
case,'' we obediently repeated, or would reply: ''A subordinate
adverbial clause of time, Miss Goodwin''.
I still remember these primary teachers. Over the department presided
Mrs Mann, who was regal and lovely and deliciously firm; when you were
very small, she was apt to merge in your mind with the Queen. And there
was Miss Hogg, a very little woman, dimpling and smiling -- until her
eyes froze into chips of grey glass that read your soul. And there was
Mrs Kinnis, in Primary Seven, brisk and beaming, who still sends me that
Christmas card every year. But they were all old -- at least 40 in those
days -- and grey-haired, and given to sensible clothes, and I suspect
that they smoked.
Miss Goodwin? She was much younger. She had long lovely hair, and a
face like some rare and precious breed of cat, and wore light and
colourful things, and moved with a delicious grace. But the hair was
invariably pleated, ponytailed, or bunned. Not a smidgen of makeup did I
ever see on that face. It was inconceivable that Miss Goodwin smoked.
Now all of us in that department held all the teachers in awe, but
Miss Goodwin was regarded with peculiar terror. On refectory duty, or in
the liturgy of morning assembly, or deputising for the regular mistress,
her ferocious style became rapidly apparent. But Miss Goodwin could
rant. Miss Goodwin could rage. Miss Goodwin could stun a class into
aghast submission by a wide variety of carefully choreographed effects.
She could wheel from the blackboard in an instant, and fling the chalk
to the floor in a puff of seeming smoke even as her gown flared behind
her like a vampire's wings. She knew, and used, the name of every single
pupil in the school. She knew, and could deploy, the faint icy smile
with that merest hint of sadistic enjoyment. She had wit that would have
had you laugh out loud, had you dared. She could see through the back of
her head.
Like I said, she terrified every pupil. Except, that is, for the ones
she actually taught. For Margaret Goodwin was that rarest thing, now
seldom met -- a truly born teacher. She loved her job. She loved
children. But above all she loved knowledge, learning, breadth, and
culture -- and by the time she had finished with us, did Miss Goodwin
vow perpetually, so would we. She was utterly, absolutely,
irreproachably fair.
She treated us almost like mini-adults. At the start of that Primary
Six year she told us gravely that she would not normally teach us maths
or arithmetic in the afternoon, because she knew pupils resented it --
as long as we kept abreast of the work.
She had a gift of sharing passion. Miss Goodwin had a passion for many
things. One was music; she helped Miss Hogg in directing the primary
choir, and had an unexpected gift for directing drama productions; when
we had an Easter cantata, the year after I left her class, she proved a
veritable Hitchcock.
What I remember most, however, was her love for Burns. She had a
magnificent slide-show, which she showed to the whole primary department
most years, replete with eerie shots of the Auld Kirk and the Brig O'
Doon, to which she read a mesmerising commentary. She knew most of
Rabbie's oeuvre by heart. We had to learn a good deal of it too. This
was the secret of Miss Goodwin's greatness: because she loved something
and revelled in it, she could bring us to delight in it too.
And when, in this summer of 1977, the holidays loomed and we were to
be liberated for ever from the tutelage of this awesome woman, we quite
spontaneously gave her three cheers. And she giggled and blushed like a
little girl -- before leading us, in a rigid and sober crocodile, all
the way to the college for the prizegiving.
I last saw Miss Goodwin during the General Election, nearly three
years ago. I came upon her at the end of the school day, ushering
another crocodile from the class. She greeted me with coy pleasure, and
we stood and talked for a little while. She was a little older, but had
changed very little, except that she now seemed disconcertingly small. I
reminded her of her past awesomeness: the chalk-throwing, and so on.
''Oh, but that was an act,'' she said, ''and it worked too, didn't it?''
She cannot be a day over 55. I now call on the authorities of this
land to send deputations, raise an army, and call on all the authority
of the state to restore Miss Margaret Goodwin to the classroom. How dare
she abdicate? Give her money, give her lands, give her a peerage if need
be -- for now, bereft of such a teacher, tremble for the future good of
Scotland.

AUSTRALIA and Britain planned massive bombing raids in 1964 against
Indonesia if Jakarta escalated its confrontation with the newly-formed
Malaysian Federation, newly-released Australian documents show.
The cabinet documents released by the Australian Archives under a
30-year secrecy rule, show the plan was aimed at destroying Indonesia's
air and naval capabilities in the event of a major Indonesian attack on
the Malaysian Federation.
Malaysia, formed from a collection of British territories including
Singapore, was subject at the time to escalating Indonesian
confrontation that involved raids into Sarawak on the island of Borneo.
Malaysia and Indonesia share the island.
The plan, known as Addington, would have been carried out immediately
if Indonesia launched any air raid on airfields, cities, or military
targets in Malaysia using its newly acquired Soviet jet fighters and
bombers.
The contents of the documents, reported in the Australian media today,
show the Government envisaged such air attacks could have prompted
Indonesia to retaliate with air raids or commando incursions against the
Australian mainland, specifically Darwin.
The plan was one of several contingency documents produced with the
aim of formulating a graduated response to the policies of Indonesia's
President Sukarno against Malaysia.
The major plans envisaged the destruction of Indonesian air and naval
capabilities in response to major coordinated Indonesian attacks in
Borneo or the whole of Malaysia.
Britain would have carried most of the action, flying its aircraft
from land bases in Malaysia and Australia and from aircraft carriers in
the Indian Ocean and South China Sea.
Australia could have contributed eight Canberra bombers and 28 Sabre
fighters.
New Zealand would have contributed six Canberras.
Darwin was envisaged for use by Australian or British aircraft to
strike at more remote Indonesian airfields.
''In the event of (Australian) aircraft in Malaya being used in an
offensive role and of Darwin being used to mount air strikes against
Indonesia, there will be the possibility of air attacks against Darwin
port and airfield or of small sabotage raids,'' a cabinet defence
committee submission said.

Baghdad, Monday
HEAVY fighting is raging between rival Kurdish groups in the northern
Iraqi city of Arbil, hampering the distribution of aid to the needy, a
senior UN official said.
The Iraqi news agency INA said that 472 people had been killed in the
battles.
''This fighting has killed 472, including 42 children and one woman.
The two cliques have indiscriminately shelled each other's positions,
using heavy artillery,'' the agency said, in a report monitored by the
British Broadcasting Corporation.
Travellers reaching Mosul, 55 miles from Arbil, said that hundreds of
families had fled the fighting.
''The security situation is bad in Arbil in particular, and tense
elsewhere,'' said Mohamed Zejjari, United Nations coordinator in Iraq.
''As of this morning we have reports of heavy fighting inside and
outside Arbil. One of the hospitals was severely damaged,'' he added.
The fighting pits the Kurdistan Democratic Party led by Massoud
Barzani against the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan headed by Jalal
Talabani.
After Iraq's defeat in the 1991 Gulf War over Kuwait, Iraqi Kurds set
up a regional government under Western protection away from Baghdad's
authority. But it failed to disarm the rival Kurdish groups.
Last May, clashes between the PUK and KDP killed hundreds of people
and led to the setting up of two de facto spheres of influence in the
region.
Zejjari said no party was in control of Arbil, a Kurdish stronghold of
about one million people 220 miles north of Baghdad.
Zejjari declined to give casualty figures for the clashes, which
erupted last week.
The fighting has suspended the distribution of fuel and food rations
to needy Kurds suffering a harsh winter.

It is doubtful if there is much enthusiasm for Labour's proposals for
regional assemblies in England. I suspect that, as the debate progresses
and it becomes apparent that the principal reason for the proposal is to
assist the establishment of a Scottish assembly, the present
indifference will turn to outright antagonism.
The constitutional dilemma is that, if English regional assemblies are
not established concurrently with a Scottish assembly, a very
significant reduction in Scotland's Westminster representation is
required (the West Lothian Question).
Such reduction would be unlikely to be acceptable either to the Scots
who, although they like the notion of having some power devolved from
Westminster, would almost certainly wish to remain as ''full'' rather
than ''second-class'' members of the UK or to the Labour Party whose
ability to gain a Westminster majority would be greatly reduced.
The fear is that England could end up with assemblies which it does
not want or Scotland with an assembly which it does want but not when
coupled with a reduction in its Westminster representation. Either way
it would not augur well for a stable constitution, although no doubt
there are some who would welcome such instability.

IN the fading light of '94, I took my customary walk to witness the
dusk of another year, remembering the sense of occasion which that had
engendered in days gone by.
As the curtain of darkness would lower on my native landscape, bare
and quiet, we used to anticipate the night ahead, the dance in the
village hall, the raucous call of a Hogmanay drunk, and finally that
stroke of Big Ben on the wireless, the only true marker of time.
From then on we spilled out to friends and neighbours, carousing
towards the breakfast hour when a damnably unsteady world gave proof
that a new year had arrived.
The advancing years give you a new appreciation of time, but they take
away the magic of Hogmanay. For sure, the traditions have all but
petered out and that sense of historical watershed has been replaced by
the certain knowledge that life is, after all, just one damned day after
another.
So, with that rather pessimistic approach to 1995, I decided to do
something about it. Between the memories of my native Maud and the
rocking cabaret of Glasgow's George Square must lie a Hogmanay to suit
my age and mood, and the answer, albeit a fairly expensive one, was
surely Gleneagles Hotel.
So I drove into the sylvan setting of Perthshire in the early evening,
as the light had gone and a blast from the north had dusted the country
roads with a hint of snow.
Suddenly, out of the winter dark came the lights of the famous hotel,
celebrating not only Hogmanay but its own 70th anniversary, a potent
mixture which set the theme for the night ahead.
This would be a time not only for pipes and country dancing but also
for a reconstruction of the 1920s, back to those early days of wireless
when Henry Hall and his orchestra entertained the nation from the
ballroom of Gleneagles Hotel.
So the women, if they were not in ball gowns, were there as flappers
of the twenties. The proper dress for men was white tie and tails (most
of them conformed) and if you think we are venturing into the realms of
ostentation, you could be right.
It was also, however, an absolutely splendid sight. In a world gone
mad about the casual look, all jeans and wooly jumpers, a uniformity of
the drab and the dreadful, where these days can you find a touch of
style and glamour?
I had the answer as I joined the champagne reception at Gleneagles,
welcomed by managing director Peter Lederer to a lounge which bristled
with sophistication.
Here was Noel Coward in silver-topped cane, or Cole Porter putting on
the Ritz. Here was the grand piano in the corner, with Francis Canning
giving full vent to Gershwin. The Man I Love set the mood for ladies
with long cigarette holders, and Rhapsody in Blue topped it off for
those who share my enthusiasm for that American period.
It was a family night too, with some of the children dressed as if
they had been given a night off from Oliver. (The full weekend for a
father, mother, and three kids cost a basic #2500!)
So the pipe band skirled in the foyer, a particular delight to the
mixture of nationalities, before we filed into the dining rooms for an
eight-course meal in a warmly sumptuous and glamorous setting.
Through it all, you danced to the various sounds of Scotland's
traditional music, the mellow brass of the Pasadena Roof Orchestra and
the much-remembered tones of the Henry Hall era. We high-stepped the
charleston, glided through the foxtrot, and when it came to the midnight
hour we joined hands and gave Auld Lang Syne its finest shot.
When this hotel opened in 1924 they were still licking the wounds of
the First World War and had yet to hear of the monster who would
precipitate the second. With abandon, they were simply challenging the
mystery of life, whatever it held in store.
Seventy years later we fantasised on a night of glorious celebration.
And when the new day beckoned, I was back in Glasgow for another
occasion I wouldn't miss.
The annual charity concert, given by the City of Glasgow Philharmonic
Orchestra and raising over #20,000 for Action Research, has become a
landmark in the local calendar, one of those wonderfully warm and
civilised gatherings which make you feel better about life.
The highlight of this New Year concert was the discovery of a young
Scottish tenor whose name will surely rank with the best this nation has
produced. Make a note of 23-year-old Douglas Telfer from Greenock,
currently studying at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama.
More than 50 years ago I watched Richard Tauber as he sang My Heart
and I. There is no greater compliment to the young Scot than to say his
rendering of that same song brought back memories.
Douglas Telfer's father, who worked for IBM, died not long ago, aged
53. But his mother and sister Hazel came up from Greenock to cheer on
their boy and choked on the rapturous applause. It must have rattled the
rafters of heaven. And his Dad would be proud.

It would be a great boost to Scottish morale if in 1995 all new
Scottish banknotes were bilingual, ie, Gaelic and English.
For who can deny that the Scottish currency and the Gaelic language
are both long-standing and intrinsic features of Scottish culture?
Moreover, would it not be even more splendid in 1995 if all the new UK
banknotes could be found in Gaelic, Welsh, Irish, Scots, as well as
English.
Such a gesture of recognised equal status would do much to endorse the
unitedness that we are constantly bombarded with by those who proclaim
the UK as a single, equally balanced entity.

I am now truly at home. Santa brought a late present with your
front-page coverage of American football on Boxing Day. It was just like
waking up in Peoria, Illinois.
Having lived in Glasgow on and off for over 23 years, I never thought
I'd see the day when the gridiron hit front page. Okay, it wasn't the
Bears, but then Chicago sports fans get used to only one good season in
20. Kind of like Partick Thistle. At least we made the play-offs.
All I need now is for baseball to receive the same coverage. However,
the strike would need to finish, and if it did, then the Cubs would
beabout due a championship -- it's been since 1908. Even Celtic won't
have to wait that long.
The basketball season is also in full swing, so I'll look forward to
coverage here too. Michael Jordan is now trying hardball, so the Bulls
will be back to the good ol' days, or rather the losing way it usually
is in Chicago. Better come back quick, Ally.

Your article about the Labour Party's selection of a candidate to
fight Michael Forsyth at the next election claimed that Labour's last
failure had reduced his majority (December 19). In fact Michael Forsyth
was returned with an increased majority and share of the vote.
The article claims Labour is to set aside its policy of women-only
short leets to enable Corrie McCord, the leader of Central Regional
Council, to apply for the next vacancy. Mr McCord is of course the
leader of the authority which persuaded the Boundary Commission to
remove Bridge of Allan from the Stirling constituency, a decision which
caused widespread resentment throughout Stirling among people of all
political persuasions.
In view of this it would take a particular type of nerve for Mr McCord
to put his name forward.

Andrew Anderson suggests that my response as SNP spokesman to the
publication of hospital league tables and mortality rates comes from a
closed mind (December 27).
The decision to publish these tables was a political one. The
information had been available for some time and I understand it was the
considered view of those in the information division of the Scottish
Office and of many clinicians in the Clinical Resource and Audit Group
of the National Health Service that much work had been done evaluating
the data before publication.
I have the greatest respect for the excellent work done over many
years by the information division, which made possible the unique data
contained in these tables. I know that the division would be the first
to accept that interpretation of the data is another matter.
An example highlighted was the difference in mortality from acute
heart attacks between the Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, and Fife.
I note that the clinicians in the Western General (with the more
favourable results) dissociate themselves publicly from any valid
interpretation of the league tables and point to the many sources of
error and statistical variance.
I accept that the Chief Medical Officer for Scotland published the
league tables with warning notices on their interpretation. Lord Fraser,
however, from the beginning suggested that the tables might begin to be
used to evaluate hospital care and to enable choices to be made by
patients.
The view of many of us in the health professions is that these tables
in their present state are being used politically to divert attention
from the real underlying conditions of poverty, as well as from the
present subversion of the health service.
The relationships between poverty and health have been made clear by
the information division of the Scottish Office over many years.

December 29.
Science, like engineering, seems to be considered third rate in this
country. You state in your leader column that maybe the problem is one
of image (December 27).
I suggest the reason so many students avoid science is the difficulty
of finding employment. Members of the Government have spoken of the need
to increase the number of science graduates but have not stated where
all the jobs will be when these students graduate.
Vacancies for research scientists in Scotland and south of the Border
are not very numerous and many of our research scientists end up
developing their careers in another country.
As you say, the only scientists who get any recognition are those who
develop products that blow people up. I am sure there are scientists
working on projects that will benefit us all -- but we will never hear
about them.

Like Murray Ritchie I ''smart at the injustice'' of the current
British electoral system and would normally have expected to be able to
endorse every syllable of his latest critique of it (December 26).
In his enthusiasm to illustrate its undoubted unfairness he overstates
his case against it by making the puzzling, and quite false, assertion
that ''last year the SNP almost doubled its vote and lost half its
seats''.
In fact the SNP only increased its share of the vote at last May's
regional elections from 21.8% in 1990 to 26.7%, while its regional
council representation actually rose from 43 in 1990 to 73, a net gain
of 30 seats, reflecting an almost 70% improvement on its 1990
performance.
In addition, and for the first time, the SNP took control of a
regional administration -- Tayside -- while sharing power with the
Liberal Democrats in Grampian. Admittedly across Scotland the party was
still under-represented as it only won 16.1% of the total number of
seats, a shortfall of about 40% in relation to its share of the popular
vote.
In the Euro-elections a month later the SNP not only doubled its
representation in the European Parliament -- from one to two MEPS -- but
raised its share of the vote to almost 33%, its best performance in a
UK-wide election.
In general, Murray Ritchie does an excellent job in keeping us abreast
of EU developments. He should beware, nevertheless, that his continental
posting does not altogether distract his attention from the evolving
political situation at home, otherwise he might find himself being
overtaken by events. The SNP is on a roll, and the signs are that it
hasn't yet been halted.

Ashby McGowan talks about the thirteenth century as though he had
personally witnessed its events (Weekender, December 24). It is
misleading to talk of medieval Scots and English nationals in any
meaningful modern sense. There was a single French-speaking aristocratic
society throughout Britain.
Walter Fitz Alan, for example, whose family in due course became the
royal house of Stewart, founded the priory at Paisley ''for the souls of
King Henry of England, King David, and King Malcolm''.
It is also misleading to talk of loyalty to a nation state. The
concept was meaningless in the thirteenth century. There were those who
favoured Edward I, like John Comyn; there were those who were implacably
opposed to him, like Andrew de Moray; there were those who vacillated,
like Robert de Brus.
Wallace was a Norman who spoke French. He could have had little in
common with the English-speaking natives of lowland Scotland, who would
be largely indifferent to whether their French-speaking aristocracy was
sympathetic or not to Edward I.
As late as 1304, Edward I was feted in Fife ''as had been the custom
in the time of Alexander III'' and the ''poor husbandmen of the king of
Scotland'' appealed to him in 1305 for the same rights of land tenure as
the peasants in England.
It is demeaning to falsify our ancestry to make political fairy-tales.

January 1.
I'd like to help the George Rickey sculptures escape from their prison
in the parks department yard (December 31). They are a gift from an
eminent international artist to the citizens of Glasgow, and it is wrong
that his generosity is spurned. To put it bluntly, it is downright bad
manners, and uncharacteristic of the City of Glasgow.
Pat Lally is right -- sensitive kinetic sculptures can be a headache
to install, but this has not yet prevented many great international
cities from acquiring a Rickey sculpture, and if Glasgow wants to join
this league then we'll simply have to learn how. I don't see it as being
insurmountable, and could make constructive suggestions.
The experience and confidence required to place these public works has
already been proved in 1982 by the big Rickey outdoor exhibition along
the banks of the Clyde organised by the late Barbara Grigor. Along with
others I helped install the works and that expertise is still here.
During the search for the Rickey sculptures I found one of my own in
the same prison. It had been sponsored by Teacher's Whisky for Glasgow's
garden festival and afterwards it was to be re-sited in the city. How
can sponsors be re-approached when such undertakings are broken, not by
the artist, but by the administration?
Broad shoulders are required for survival in the Scottish art world
and I'm not a moaner and have conditioned myself to shrugging off
unenlightened attitudes. However, the lack of appreciation of George
Rickey's gift will not be understood internationally and, if not
corrected, can diminish Glasgow's hard-won achievements.
With the year of architecture coming up, I hope Mr and Mrs Happy will
see to it that those charged to administer on their behalf will get this
daft mess sorted out without delay. No recriminations from anyone please
-- just do it. It should be a ''Happy New Year''.

IF a man is determined to take his own life, only direct and
continuous supervision can prevent him. Frederick West, the alleged
Gloucester serial killer, took his own life on Sunday when in prison.
His death leaves many questions unresolved, including his own guilt and
the possible identities of victims in addition to those already
discovered. One question inevitably is how he managed to accomplish
suicide. A resourceful man needs only a few minutes to take the steps
necessary to hang himself, though it may well take much longer to ensure
death. Mr West had been on a regime which involved his being inspected
by a prison officer every 15 minutes. There is a suggestion that this
had been abandoned because he had seemed so normal. If that is the case
he would have had plenty of time in which to kill himself; certainly
enough time to ensure that the strenuous attempts made to revive him had
no success. The incident marks a further instalment in a recent run of
poor results from Britain's prison service and is bound to intensify the
debate about its future role in an age of financial stringency. As it
happens, those in charge at Winson Green prison, where Mr West was kept,
felt there was no undermanning in their case. Other establishments might
not feel so fortunately placed, and the chances of bringing prison staff
generally up to the optimum levels must seem remote.
Among possible improvements would be continuous camera surveillance of
certain prisoners. These would include those whose alleged crimes, or
whose perceived personalities placed them in categories where the risk
of suicide was likely to be high. Given the number and enormity of the
crimes with which Frederick West stood accused, the pressures on him
must have been considerable even before his mental stability was taken
into account. He should never have been considered ''normal'', no matter
his demeanour. It is always easy to be wise after the event, but in this
case trouble should have been anticipated. Those accused of multiple or
serial murder in the future should not simply be left in a cell to their
own devices even when inspected at quarter-hour intervals.
Whether anything more general should derive from the incident is
another matter. The cost of imprisonment is already very high -- one
sound reason why British magistrates and judges should refrain from
automatic and long custodial sentences. We pay a lot for a sentencing
policy which (and by a good margin) leaves us with a higher prison
population than is common in the rest of the European Union. Perhaps
because imprisonment is so common, inmates no longer take it too
seriously. Recent lapses in security and examples of lax practice
suggest that the custodians themselves may suffer similarly. Certainly
morale in the prison service is not what it should be. How that can be
changed without additional public spending on pay and conditions is hard
to see; and the argument about privatising the service merely sidesteps
the issue.

Paris, Monday
FRANCE extended its investigation into killings blamed on guerrilla
mastermind ''Carlos the Jackal'' with an anti-terrorism magistrate
placing him under investigation for a 1983 railway station bombing.
Carlos's lawyer, Mourad Oussedik, said the Venezuelan-born guerrilla
denied involvement in the blast, at the Gare Saint Charles in the
Mediterranean city of Marseille, which killed two people and wounded 34.
''Carlos was not in Marseille at the time,'' said Oussedik after
magistrate Jean-Louis Bruguiere summoned Carlos from his jail cell to
tell him of the investigation.
It is the third inquiry begun since Carlos was captured in Sudan and
spirited to France in August.
Carlos, whose real name is Illich Ramirez Sanchez, already faced
investigations into a blast on a Paris-Toulouse train in 1982 in which
five people died and a car bombing in the same year in Paris which
killed a pregnant woman.
He was also sentenced in his absence to life in jail in 1992 for
shooting dead two French secret service agents in 1975.
Oussedik said Carlos's first line of defence remained to argue he was
illegally kidnapped in Sudan, drugged, and bundled on to a plane and so
should be freed. France says he was legally extradited.
''You can't base justice on cowboy films,'' Oussedik said.
Carlos told Bruguiere that France, by co-operating with Sudan, was
''working with one of the last terrorist countries on the planet'' and
that it undermined French claims to be fighting terrorism, according to
Oussedik.
French commandos stormed a hijacked Air France airliner in Marseille
last week, killing four Muslim fundamentalist hijackers and freeing 169
hostages. The hijackers had seized the jet in Algiers 54 hours earlier
and killed three passengers.
Bruguiere also heads the investigation into whether the hijackers had
accomplices in France.
Carlos bombed his way to notoriety in the 1970s and 1980s in attacks
principally in Europe and the Middle East. His boldest act was to kidnap
Opec Ministers attending a conference in Vienna.
Oussedik said there was no indication of when any trial of Carlos
might be held. Being placed under examination allows investigators to
compile evidence but does not formally imply guilt.
Francoise Rudetzki, head of the SOS Attentats group representing
victims of guerrilla attacks, said she believed Carlos's first court
appearance was likely to be a retrial for killing the two French agents
in 1975.
Oussedik said Carlos's spirits had not been bowed by months in
solitary confinement. ''He is in his cell. He is waiting . . . his state
of mind is still the same,'' he said.

MUNICH: An 85-year-old man called German police for help on New Year's
Eve after his wife locked herself in their bedroom with her lover. The
man told police his wife, who was also 85, had refused to open the door
to him. He asked the Munich police to come and throw her friend, aged
about 50, out of the house because he was too old and frail to do it
himself. When the police told him they could not intervene in domestic
disputes, the pensioner retorted: ''I shall just have to be unfaithful
myself then.''

THE latest ceasefire agreement signed between Bosnian Serbs and
Muslims on Saturday has now been reinforced by the inclusion of the
Croats. It is indispensable to any more formal peace but too much cannot
be read into it. The war which has devastated the former Yugoslav
republic (already one of the poorest in the federation) is now almost
three years old. It has been characterised by the most savage fighting,
many atrocities, and continuous diplomacy at several levels. Ceasefires
have been numerous but have mostly failed to last for more than a few
hours, mainly because cohesion has been lost among those actually
fighting, and with it authority and control. Even the two formal states
behind some at least of the fighters, Serbia itself and Croatia, have
been unable to impose themselves on their kinsmen. Ethnic division is
more complex than it might at first appear (for example, the Bosnian
army, Muslim dominated, has both Croat and Serb elements) and the
geographical configuration of any ''front line'' is constantly moving,
while being complicated by UN-declared safe enclaves.
It will seem surprising to some how easily in the last century the
affairs of the whole Balkan region (then generally even more unstable
than now) could have been settled in a matter of days by senior European
statesmen engaging in direct diplomacy in Berlin. Since 1878, however,
the status and authority of the Great Powers have declined, and the
nature of war has changed too. What is being waged in Bosnia is
somewhere between a conventional and a guerrilla war. Hopes that the
Serbian embargo on supplies of war materials, particularly of fuel, to
their Bosnian compatriots would cripple the latter's war effort have
been dashed. Interrupting fuel shipments might cripple a conventional
army, but not a guerrilla one; and even those elements of the Bosnian
Serb forces which need fuel have managed on smuggled or captured
supplies. Time may change that somewhat, but probably not decisively,
anymore than allowing the free flow of weaponry to the Muslims would
guarantee a major military shift in their favour.
Given that Great Powers can no longer impose their will in the Balkans
by fiat, diplomacy remains the only way open to Bosnian peacemakers.
Here too, however, the omens are bleak. Is it too depressing to conclude
that the best peacemakers are likely to be the actual participants? No
amount of brokerage has been successful so far. Indeed it could be
argued that outside intervention has not only conspicuously failed, but
may even have prolonged the fighting by raising excessive hopes (so far
shown to be false) among the Bosnian Muslims. The UN may have to take
that on board. Both Nato and the United States may have to learn a
harder lesson: it is difficult to persuade people round a table to
surrender territory they have won by force. Bosnia's Serbs are not going
to be persuaded easily to give up much -- but any extension of this
latest ceasefire and its translation into something more permanent must
entail their giving way a bit. The task remains convincing them of that,
and getting the equally obdurate Muslims to settle for less than a lot.

THE entries of Austria, Finland, and Sweden into the EU were grandly
celebrated with a New Year concert in the Usher Hall, sponsored by the
European Commission whose man in Edinburgh, Ken Munro, bid the assembled
great and good to rejoice at this important moment in history.
Naturally the Usher Hall was bedecked with flags for such an
auspicious occasion. Pride of place went, of course, to the national
flags of Austria, Finland and, er, Switzerland actually. Doubtless as we
get to know our new Swedish partners we will also find out what their
flag looks like.
New departure
EVEN in death there is no escaping the relentless breakup of the
railways. Witness the latest issue of RailNews, the staff newspaper
which continues to be published by British Rail -- an organisation
which, for most other purposes, now scarcely exists.
The paper regularly includes information about former rail employees
who have passed over to the great shunting yard in the sky. Henceforth,
it is solemnly announced, obituaries will be arranged according to the
''profit centre'' which the deceased would have been part of, if he had
not been fortunate enough to get out of the railways before all this
nonsense began.
Three's a crowd
A SEASONAL Brains Trust at the Westerton Church of Scotland in
Bearsden included a question about who the distinguished panelists would
choose to go on holiday with; always assuming, of course, that their
nearest and dearest were unavailable.
Colin MacKay, erstwhile Scottish Television presenter turned radio
political pundit, gave the matter due consideration and pronounced that
his ideal company for getting away from it all would be Donald Dewar and
Nicky Fairbairn. Quite a trio, to envisage on the beach.
Or a case, you might think, of ''haud the rest of us back''.
Scenting blood
ONE of the cliffhanging votes in the coming parliamentary term is
likely to arise out of a private member's bill which will aim at
abolition of hunting with hounds. The last time this came up, shortly
before the 1992 General Election, the smallness of their majority
against abolition alarmed the blood-sport lobby.
They were particularly surprised to find 28 Tories voting for
abolition. With the balance of the Commons changing significantly at the
last election, the British Field Sports Association realised that it was
facing defeat next time the subject came up, unless it could detach some
Opposition MPs from the abolitionist camp.
To this end, it hired one of the most expensive Westminster lobbying
organisations, GJW, and many invitations to wine and dine at some of the
more impressive stately homes, including Hopetoun House, followed. There
is no evidence so far that the investment has won any votes.
Meanwhile, Auberon Waugh in the Daily Telegraph notes with
satisfaction that of the ''28 Tory stinkers'' who voted last time round
for abolition, five lost their seats and four more ''had the good sense
to retire''.
He adds tastefully: ''We simply do not know how many of the 1992 Tory
intake will prove to be stinkers, although one who declared himself, the
late Stephen Milligan, died tragically on his kitchen table before he
could prove the point.''
This one could make the internal battle with the Euro-sceptics seem
like a blood-free picnic by comparison.
Someone to talk to
PSST. Anyone want a free exposition of ''current Tory philosophy''?
This is the generous offer made by the Social Democratic Party's former
Scottish supremo, Ralph Leishman, who has turned up unexpectedly as
prospective Tory candidate for Argyll and Bute.
Mr Leishman has written to the Oban Times intimating that he would
''welcome invitations from local organisations, societies or groups to
come to meet and talk to their members''. They are invited to write to
an address in Renfrewshire.
Changed days indeed for the Argyll Tories, when they send letters to
the papers, soliciting invitations. One obvious possibility lies in the
front-page story of the same issue which reports the protestations of
the Friends of the West Highland Line that pre-privatisation timetable
cutbacks ''will leave Oban with the worst service in Scotland''.
Coupled with the Government's decisions to axe sleeper and Motorail
services to the Highlands, this would surely make a fascinating branch
of ''current Tory philosophy'' to expound upon. The Friends of the West
Highland Line should not delay with their invitation.
Major upset
EYEBROWS were raised when the Radio 4 Today programme's Man of the
Year poll of listeners resulted in John Major coming second only to the
late Roy Castle and well ahead of, for instance, Nelson Mandela and John
Hume.
Suspicions focused on the possibility that Tory Central Office had
organised a phone-in. This possibility was rejected by the BBC who said
that the result had been the same in every part of Britain, except
Scotland -- where Mr Major topped the poll.
This outcome may serve as a useful reminder to politicians who believe
that when they speak on the Today programme they are addressing the
world that the audience may not be entirely representative of the
population as a whole.

She seems forever young, but her recent eight-month battle with breast
cancer has forced Olivia Newton-John to grow up, as she tells Marian
Christy
SINGER and actress Olivia Newton-John has always painted an upbeat
picture of herself as an emotionally strong, even invincible, woman.
Longevity certainly has been a hallmark of her career, which really took
off in 1978 when she starred with John Travolta in the movie musical,
Grease.
Since then, the Australian star has trailed a series of gold albums
and platinum singles behind her like confetti. She has danced with Gene
Kelly -- in Xanadu in 1980 -- and given concerts in exalted settings
such as New York's Metropolitan Opera House. Her latest project is the
seasonal American TV movie, A Christmas Romance.
But the painstaking posture of unstoppability took on poignant
overtones in 1992.
Newton-John was forced to face her own mortality when she was
diagnosed as having breast cancer. A partial mastectomy was followed by
eight months of gruelling chemotherapy.
Even in her weakest moments, Newton-John, now 46, continued her upbeat
stance, which seemed to reflect the mood of one of her greatest hits,
Have You Never Been Mellow.
She uttered statements that disguised the depth and intensity of her
battle with the disease. She was sorely tried, both physically and
mentally, but she tossed out optimistic understatements to the press:
''It is really awful that you have to be thrown a wicked punch in the
gut before you take time out,'' she said.
''I have a fantastic family and friends -- and a sense of humour. It
keeps me going because it was so awful you have to laugh.
''I tolerated chemotherapy well and kept my hair, but after eight
months, you are pretty wiped out.''
Positive thinking can be soothing, but a serious bout with cancer is a
life-and-death tug-of-war. Surely the trauma of coping with the disease
must have shaken her. Wasn't she terrified? Didn't she get depressed or
discouraged?
Newton-John is on the telephone from Vancouver. She is speeding along
a highway in a chauffeured limousine and her initial response to the
questions about cancer is silence. Then she takes a leap of faith and
expresses her deepest feelings, succinctly and unhesitatingly.
''I have faced death,'' she says, ''or, at least, the chance of death.
I was afraid, very afraid, for a short period of time.
''Once you face death and survive, you become less afraid of
everything. Ever since I had that experience I've grown up a lot. I have
rediscovered myself, particularly my strengths.''
This is not the first time I have interviewed Newton-John. In the
past, she was a dodger, a celebrity who pussyfooted around direct
questions. Not any more.
She sees a certain irony in my next question: ''What does she know
about herself that she didn't know before?''
Laughingly, she says: ''I used to be guarded. I'd keep a lot of things
about myself to myself. That's a change, isn't it?''
Newton-John was born into a prominent family. Her grandfather was the
Nobel Prize-winning German physicist Max Born. Her father was, at one
time, the headmaster of a university in Melbourne.
She is a high school dropout who, at 15, won a talent contest and went
to England to tour with a popular British singer. In 1979 the Queen
honoured her with an OBE award.
When she speaks about her ability to rise above her major setback,
cancer, Newton-John is articulate and direct. She spells out the three
biggest changes in her life in recent years:
She no longer bottles up her anger. ''I am getting better at venting
anger. It would be great to break dishes. But I don't. Sometimes I cry.
But now I'm prepared to talk out my anger while I am still angry.''
Having always suffered from attacks of butterflies in the stomach
before concerts, recording sessions and television shows, she is working
to sustain her occasionally-waning self-confidence. ''I meditate,'' she
says. ''I centre myself so that I am focused. I turn my trepidation into
energy.
''Butterflies are born of fear. I try to envision fear as adrenalin.''
She tries not to let herself succumb to on-the-job stresses. ''I
realise each day is a gift. Stress on the set, for example, is a waste
of time. People blow up. This is silly because, in the long scheme of
life, it amounts to nothing.
''Tomorrow comes around and the blow up is gone, forgotten. So why
spoil today?''
Newton-John, who reportedly makes around $2 million per year, divides
her time between two luxury mansions. One is a 7500 square foot house in
Malibu, California. The other, in New South Wales, Australia, is a
80-acre avocado farm which sits in the shadow of a rain forest.
Although she loves luxury and elegance, Newton-John says she is just
as happy ''camping out with my husband and daughter''.
In the past, Newton-John rarely talked much, or specifically, about
her husband, Matt Lattanzi, an actor who is 10 years her junior, and her
eight-year-old daughter Chloe. Even that has changed.
There have been printed reports that Lattanzi had a nervous breakdown
last year, during his wife's illness and recovery period, and required
psychotherapy.
There have also been reports that Chloe was very upset because,
initially, her mother's illness was not explained or labeled as cancer.
Chloe, who makes her acting debut with her mother in A Christmas
Romance also reportedly had therapy.
There have been persistent rumours that Newton-John's marriage is
rocky -- mainly because her husband is building a second house,
reportedly for himself, on their Australian property.
''I'd like to squelch that rumour,'' she says. ''Excuse me, but the
press can create ridiculous stirs. It's not true. There's no rift. We're
building a second house just because we want a second house.''
As for not revealing the cancer to Chloe at the beginning, Newton-John
whispers into the phone: ''It seemed to be the right thing at the time.
Now Chloe and I have an agreement. Everthing is to be out in the open
from the start.''
These days Newton-John is celebrating the fact that she is alive and
looking confidently to the future.
''Your body listens to your thoughts,'' she says. ''What's in your
mind can create an illness and it can cure it. If a bad thought starts,
I change the thought. The brain and body are integrated. They are one,
and one affects the other.''
She admits to having one negative thought, however, during the year of
her recovery. Newton-John was convinced that she, a winner of four
Grammy awards, a singing sensation and a movie star, would never work
again.
But that fear proved to be unfounded. As she heads for the CBS movie
set, it is raining and she is stuck in a traffic jam.
The previous day, she had worked until 5am. Her daughter, Chloe, was,
to quote Newton-John, ''decidely grumpy''.
''But I'm lucky,'' she tells me. ''I'm alive and I'm working and this
is what's important.''

Home affairs reporter JAMES FREEMAN assesses the problems for
high-risk inmates and the people who keep watch on them
THE apparent suicide of Frederick West gaurantees that precautions
will be stepped up in the cases of a dozen other high profile prisoners
in England, including Robert Black, the killer of Susan Maxwell,
Caroline Hogg, and Sarah Harper.
The pressure on Black in Durham Prison, a Victorian pile to rival
Peterhead, where he was previously held, must have been intense in the
months after his conviction last year for the murders.
As with every other prisoner in his league, Black may well have been
told that he will stay in prison until he dies. On top of that, he
carries with him the knowledge that a whole range of child killings are
being re-examined by detectives the length and breadth of the land.
Psychologists say that Black and his like thrive on flashbacks,
developing the ability to relive the powerful sexual kicks which the
torture and murder of small children brought him.
But the mask can occasionally slip, resulting in real anguish. It
would be during such an episode that a man like Black would contemplate
killing himself, and look for the means of doing so. It might happen
later this year when his appeal against conviction will be heard,
probably extinguishing any lingering hope of freedom.
He is probably the closest recent comparison we have between the
English and the Scottish systems. When Black was in Peterhead, he was a
loner, but he lived a fairly normal life in prison terms.
Even in jails like Peterhead, where 300 sex offenders have been
concentrated to provide a better quality daily regime and access to
sex-offender intervention programmes, there is a pecking order. Some men
are beyond the pale, even in that company, and few associated with
Black.
Yet the prison tried to make life as normal as possible for him; after
all, the motto of the Scottish Prison Officers' Association is Dare to
Care, and the mission statement of the Scottish Prison Service enshrines
the idea of treating all men with humanity. Black was particularly proud
of the fact that he was reserve in the five-a-side football team.
He does not appear to have been considered a risk to himself, although
he was treated with great care. The key to identifying prisoners at
risk, certainly in Scottish jails, is the professionalism of the prison
officers.
This country's prison system has the inestimable advantage over the
English system of its size, compact and manageable, whereas England's
jails are a vast sprawl, where the quality of service being achieved
here is that much harder to reach and maintain.
Both countries face similar resource problems, but Scotland is at
least seing some reward for achievement, having recieved extra money in
the last Government budget plan for reaching and surpassing targets.
It is that unevenness which is often the undoing of the English
system, resulting in the high-profile embarrassments, such as
Whitemoor's terrorist Semtex scandal or the West suicide. There have
been dozens of similar incidents in the last 10 years.
Any future Home Secretary will inherit a bed of nails; he will face
the same intractable problems cause by under-investment dating back to
before the Second World War.
The Scottish Office has no reason to be smug over suicides in jail,
which last year ran at more than three times the annual average, 20 in
all. The year also saw a series of criticisms by sheriffs at a
succession of inquiries into prison cell hangings. And there are many
more inquiries still to be heard.
In the next two weeks, the governors of Scotland's 21 jails will be
bidding for their individual shares of the resources allocated to the
SPS agency by Government.
High on the shopping list will be money for new suicide prevention
cells, the first of which has already been opened at Craiginches in
Aberdeen. #750,000 is the cost of the 38 cells which will, hopefully, be
built this year to cover our 21 institutions. It should then be near
enough impossible for anyone identified to be at risk to kill himself in
an observation cell.
All the appliances in the cells are built flush to the walls or
ceiling, giving no hold for a ligature. The cells are decorated in
pastel shades, a common psychological aid to reduce stress. The window
to the outside is more than twice the size of a normal cell window,
giving light and air. The observation window is also much larger, making
it easier for officers checking every 15 minutes during a strict suicide
watch.
Gone are the white gowns of the strict suicide watch which, if nothing
else, was guaranteed to stigamatise the prisoner and further reduce his
already-fragile self esteem.
The vulnerable prisoner now wears denims -- extremely hard to rip --
with velcro fastenings for safety. He sleeps in a sleeping bag, again
made of rip-resistent material, which removes the traditional sheets as
a source of material for hanging.
In every prison hall in Scotland a resuscitation set is held at the
officer point, complete with specially-designed knife which allows a
ligature to be cut without damaging the victim's neck. Every Scottish
prison officer is receiving training in using the kit.
Despite bitter complaints from the prison union over the recent
treatment of nurses in the Scottish Prison Service -- the effective
removal of nurses from prison officer status -- the service has argued
that there will be long-term benefits. One of these is that prison
nurses -- around 160 in the Scottish service -- will be required to meet
outside clinical gradings.
A training programme is under way at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital
which is aimed at bringing these nurses up to speed in identifying
prisoners at risk of suicide, and in dealing with them once identified.
Yet at the moment, with the Scottish prison population at a high level
and increasing numbers of mentally-ill people finding themselves in jail
after slipping through the Care-in-the-Community safety net, the burden
is on the ordinary prison officers to spot the suicidal early on.
The real professional is adept at this. He will notice when the
talkative prisoner suddenly goes quiet and withdraws to his cell. He
will be aware that so-and-so has received a Dear John letter.
The man who has been on remand and is back after a tough court
appearance will be vulnerable. For every one who succeeds in killing
himself probably as many as 10 others are prevented from doing so.
0 West's death took place at a change-over time in the prison routine,
and it may be that slackness had crept in at Winston Green. The SPS says
that suicide checks are maintained rigourously at change-over.
Yet it is obvious that, despite the increased vigilance and the
manageable size of the Scottish system, it is impossible to guarantee
safety for every prisoner. There are recorded cases of men in American
prisons under 24-hour observation killing themselves by running at a
wall head first.
In the latest hi-tech jail, housing 400 of America's most dangerous
men each in less than 90sq-ft of living space, there are 168 television
cameras and monitors, giving maximum control of prisoners. Mirrors are
of polished steel so that glass cannot be used for weapons. Showers are
built into each cell to restrict movement.
Isolation is total and the inmates are watched at all times, yet
nothing is more certain than that there will be cell deaths,
illustrating that escape may be preventable and assaults on staff may be
preventable, but there is no failsafe system for the determined suicide.

<TEXT>
NEARLY 60 inmates committed suicide in 1994 -- a record figure -- as
the prison population reached more than 50,000, according to statistics
due to be released this week by the Howard League for Penal Reform.
Leading prison reformers have argued that the setting up of a Suicide
Support Awareness Unit by the Home Office three years ago has failed to
halt the rise of suicides in custody.
The most recent official figures from the Howard League showed that 46
inmates killed themselves in 1993, five more than in 1992.
The number of suicides rose during the 1980s when the prison
population soared and reached nearly 50,000 in 1988. In 1990, there were
50 suicides.
Howard League director Frances Cook said the latest statistics
available show that, up until Christmas 1994, 57 inmates killed
themselves. The league's final figures for last year are due out this
week.
''There are just too many people in prison -- you can't have that
number in prison and take care of everyone,'' said Ms Cook.
''You have got lots of vulnerable people in prison and it is the young
people I am particularly worried about -- the level of self-mutilation
is terrifying.''
The league has argued that, despite the support unit and Samaritan-led
listening schemes, prison kills because of the boredom which drives many
inmates to take their own lives. People are eight times more likely to
kill themselves in prison than outside.
Among prisons which have gained notoriety in recent years for the
number of suicides is Feltham young offenders' institution in west
London, which has particularly concerned the Howard League.
Three teenage boys, the youngest 15, and one 20-year-old hanged
themselves in the seven months between August 1991 and March 1992.
Mr Anthony Scrivener QC, who headed an investigation into the deaths,
concluded that brutality and boredom led many boys at Feltham to
deliberately injure themselves or attempt suicide. Prisoners there often
spent 22 hours a day locked in their cells.

BIZARRE or violent deaths have marred New Year celebrations in several
countries around the world.
Six Russian servicemen were among 10 people who died today in the
former Soviet republic of Tajikistan after toasting the New Year with
sparkling wine that apparently had been spiked with cyanide, according
to news reports.
Itar-Tass news agency said authorities were investigating the deaths
and believed the drink had been deliberately poisoned.
In the United States, at least 12 people were shot dead during New
Year celebrations, including three killed by bullets that were
apparently fired randomly into the air by celebrants in Atlanta, New
Orleans, and Phoenix, Arizona.
An 18-year-old good Samaritan who stopped to help a man get home after
a car crash was shot dead by the man's 13-year-old son.
Christopher West and two friends were helping James Daus home in
Purdy, Washington state.
Daus could not find his keys and told the three men there was no-one
home. He gave permission for them to break a window, but his son, who
had called the police, thought it was a break-in.
''He was just trying to help somebody,'' said West's friend Dan
Wehmeier. Daus's 16-year-old daughter Dawn said her brother was
''totally crushed'' by the tragedy.
In the Philippines, 11 people died yesterday and hundreds were injured
in private fireworks celebrations. Officials said 247 people were
treated for gunshot wounds, many caused when guns were fired in the air.
In Japan, 15 elderly Japanese choked to death on mochi, sticky rice
cakes eaten during New Year celebrations.

<RECORDNO>980549796</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A GIRL who may have witnessed the murder of her mother was yesterday
under special protection, police said.
Hasna Khatun, who is three and a half years old, has described how
three people, at least two of them girls, beat her mother Amina in their
home in Manor View East, Washington, Tyne and Wear, last Friday night.
Specially trained officers have already gleaned information from the
girl, who speaks no English, in a sensitive, hour-long interview. The
details she gave and her reliability are being checked as senior
detectives try to assess the significance of what she disclosed.
Detective Superintendent Ian Lynch, the murder hunt leader, told a
news conference: ''We are very hopeful that, as a result of the
interview we have had with the child, we can progress on a number of
leads in this investigation.''
Meantime, police were conscious that Hasna could be in danger.
''Steps have been taken to ensure the safety of that child. Protection
is being provided.''
Apart from Hasna and her 24-year-old mother, the only other people in
the house on Friday night were younger sister Henna, 18 months, and her
brother Sabir, 10 months.
The children's father Syed Nurul Ahmed, 31, had been out of the house
since 4.45pm, when he went to work at the Tandoori Delight takeaway in
Walker, Newcastle.
The attack happened some time between then and 11.10pm, when police
went to the house after a frantic call from a relative in the Midlands
who had heard over the phone from Hasna about her mother being beaten.
Mr Lynch said there was no forced entry to the house and he believed
Mrs Khatun knew her killer. He said Hasna described how a girl happened
to be in the house. This girl was pretty and wearing a black frock.
Having entered the house, this girl ''took pan'', which Mr Lynch
explained was a Bangladeshi equivalent of offering a visitor a cup of
tea or coffee.
Pan comprised a leaf with rose petals, nuts or berries which were
rolled up and chewed, rather like chewing tobacco.
Mr Lynch said Hasna explained that a fight developed between the girl
and Hasna's mother and that two other people joined in. One of these was
a girl wearing a black shirt.
Hasna had used the term fossa to describe the clothing of the three
people in the house -- a term which could mean bad, casual, scruffy or
not Asian clothes.
Mrs Khatun died from multiple injuries, including stab wounds to her
neck. So far, the murder weapon has not been found.
Mr Lynch said four relatives had spoken to Hasna before the police
interview and, to avoid confusion, they were trying to find out, word by
word, exactly what may have been said to her.
They are also trying to find out the times of phone calls to the house
on Friday night by checking with relatives who made the calls and
British Telecom. This could narrow down the possible time of the
killing.
Mr Lynch told the news conference that Hasna's father was ''obviously
distraught as a result of losing his wife and needs the support of
friends and relatives during the course of this investigation''.
''But I can say he is giving us a lot of assistance and is as keen as
we are that the murderer should be arrested as soon as possible,'' he
added.

ONE of Scotland's top-profile prisoners says that, in 25 years behind
bars, he had seen men reduced to suicide -- but almost always by
domestic incidents which most of us would consider trivial.
In a recent interview with The Herald, the prisoner added that he had
seen men brought to the edge by the threat of Aids, knowing that they
had contracted HIV inside prison, knowing that they had given themselves
a death sentence, and that it was their own fault.
Suicide is, after all, not an easy act to commit. In a strange way, it
requires courage of a high order. Ernest Hemingway, the American author
who later shot himself after becoming obsessed with the subject, said,
memorably, that it was the only act that a man truly committed alone.
Jail reduces personality, like water dripping on a stone. The trivia
of much of daily life, of the endless sea of rules governing every
sphere of activity breeds a deep frustration.
It can heighten a man's isolation; even when he is living in the
claustrophobic, overcrowded beehive of a Victorian prison such as Winson
Green or Durham, or Perth or Barlinnie, he can become deeply,
irretrievably introverted, and the crunch is that he may not display any
outside symptoms which would allow a concerned prison officer to spot
him as a suicide risk.
Many criminals are, after all, adept at concealing emotions, practised
at prevarication, experts at emotional chess. There is a perfect example
here in Scotland of that later character trait and it concerns Thomas
McCulloch, who tried to kill a Dumbartonshire hotel manageress and
received a life sentence.
It was while being detained for treatment at the State Hospital in
Carstairs in 1976 that he and his accomplice, Robert Mone -- who was
jailed for life for murdering a Dundee school teacher in front of her
class -- escaped from the State hospital in a bloody rampage which
scarred Scottish society as well as the justice system.
Recaptured after killing a fellow patient, a male nurse, and a
policeman, the two are said to be the only men in Scotland's prisons who
are guaranteed what the English call a full life tariff. McCulloch, 45,
is widely regarded as our most dangerous prisoner (as well as the most
costly) and it is for that reason -- the potential danger to others, not
because he may be suicidal -- that he is guarded day and night in
Peterhead Prison by three officers.
However, McCulloch plays subtle mind games with the men detailed to
watch him. Outwardly normal all the time, he has been known to remark
casually to the officers that the reason there are three of them is that
the authorities know that, if there were only two, he could kill them.
He sows the seeds of doubt in the mind of his jailers, who know that,
after his mother died, McCulloch said he would like to kill again. They
can never relax.
Some murderers facing enormously long prison stretches find ways of
coming to terms with the endless parade of identical days.
Howard Wilson is a former policeman convicted of murdering two police
officers and crippling another in Allison Street, in Glasgow's
Govanhill, after a bank raid. His 25-year minimum -- the sentence he had
to complete even before the parole process was allowed to begin, is now
up. He recently told The Herald that he had received good advice from
older cons in Peterhead in the early days.
Look forward to the next football match on the radio, look forward to
fish and chips -- everyone's favourite in Peterhead Prison -- on a
Wednesday, look forward to your next visit but, under no circumstances,
look further ahead.
It was a cliche, he said, but the advice was to do the sentence in
small chunks -- if necessary, one day at a time. In another sense, the
sheer bloody mindedness of the regime helped him to put thoughts of
suicide from his mind.
He had always been a positive, strong personality and the staff at
Peterhead hated everyone impartially in those rough, tough days 25 years
ago. It was country boys from Buchan versus city slickers from Glasgow.
The late Paddy Meehan talked of the same scenario, and how the sheer,
bloody anger which it generated drove out any thoughts of ending it all.
Wilson remembers being locked in the special cell at Barlinnie, then
set aside for men who had been sentenced to death.
This cell had lots of glass to make sure the condemned man did not
cheat the hangman. As he lay in there, he could watch the prison
officers watching him, but it was not the lack of privacy which finally
got to him. It was the fact that the officers were listening to the
radio and the festive season hit that year was Rolf Harris singing Two
Little Boys. Even for a strong-minded man like Wilson, its endless
repetition became almost unbearable.
For most men in jail, apart from the obviously unstable, including the
increasing numbers of mentally ill or those who are vulnerable because
of their youth, the reason for taking their own lives is almost always
related to their domestic situation. Jail is already stressful enough
but the Dear John letter, or an acquaintance arriving in the same prison
and passing on the word that a wife was being unfaithful, can be enough
to tip some men over the edge.
In the case of Frederick West, the events of the last month
surrounding the Home Secretary's unilateral adoption of the full-life
tariff, with Myra Hindley becoming the first English killer to receive
official word that she will die in jail and all the subsequent
publicity, could well have been the trigger.
West literally had nothing left to live for except a life of endless
incarceration. He, plainly, was not made of sufficiently-stern stuff to
handle the idea of life meaning life.

Buenos Aires, Monday
ARGENTINE soccer superstar Diego Maradona is courting controversy
again for travelling to Cuba and France -- breaking bail conditions
imposed by a court trying him for shooting at journalists with an air
rifle.
Maradona's lawyer Hugo Wortman said the athlete had been ordered to
appear before a judge within two weeks to explain why he had not secured
court permission to travel to Cuba and France.
One of the journalists he is alleged to have attacked, Pablo Daniel
Talamoni, said 34-year-old Maradona might be jailed for a few hours on
his return while his lawyers negotiated new bail conditions.
''It's another sign of his arrogant behaviour towards the courts,''
said Talamoni.
An Argentine prosecutor is seeking a four-year jail term for Maradona
who allegedly fired an air gun at journalists last February as they
besieged his home for an interview. Sentencing is expected in March.
Maradona, hero of Argentina's 1986 World Cup win, is serving a
15-month playing ban for failing a drugs test at last summer's World
Cup.
He was due in Paris tomorrow to pick up the Golden Ball award normally
given only to European players.
He spent Christmas and New Year with his wife and two daughters in
Cuba, where they were pictured hugging and exchanging gifts with Fidel
Castro.
On leaving Cuba yesterday, Maradona told reporters: ''I believe I
would give my life for Fidel'' -- a comment unlikely to endear him to
Argentine President Carlos Menem, Castro's loudest critic in Latin
America.
Maradona returns to Argentina this week to start a new job as coach of
Racing Club, which has failed to win a championship in 28
years.--Reuter.

SNP leader Alex Salmond yesterday likened Labour's plans for
devolution to a giant jelly.
In a letter to Labour leader Tony Blair, he demanded details of
Labour's devolution commitments, and clarification of the exact status
of the plans.
Mr Salmond said that weekend press reports had intensified the
confusion surrounding what Labour claimed was its flagship policy for
Scotland, and added that Shadow Scottish Secretary Mr George Robertson
MP didn't even know what he might call the person in charge of a
devolved Scottish administration.
He said: ''Blair's devolution package is beginning to resemble a giant
jelly -- wobbling about and moving in different directions whenever and
wherever you probe it. It is high time that we had a definite statement
of both the timescale and the detail of devolution -- if any such
information actually exists.''
In his letter to Mr Blair, the SNP leader pointed out that two
different Sunday newspapers quoted official Labour sources as giving two
different timescales for the implementation of Labour's plans.

<TEXT>
IRISH Environment Minister Brendan Howlin is to have a series of
meetings with interested groups from both sides of a row over tough new
drink-drive laws which cut road accidents over the Christmas and New
Year holiday -- but also drastically hit the pub trade.
Official figures indicated a drop in both road deaths and injuries
during the holiday period, and hospitals said they admitted fewer
accident victims for treatment.
But licensees nationwide reported a huge drop in business -- as much
as 70% in some rural areas -- with former customers apparently electing
to stay at home to drink rather than risk falling foul of the new
legislation.
The new law, introduced shortly before Christmas, brought the Irish
blood-alcohol limit, previously 100 milligrams of alcohol per 100
millilitres of blood into line with other European Union states -- the
new figure of 80/100.
It was backed by a record number of police road checkpoints and a
television and radio advertising campaign.
Mr Howlin, set for talks with representatives of the drink industry as
well as police and road safety organisations, has ruled out any change
in the permitted limits, but may consider a sliding scale of penalities
for those infringing the law.
At present, the new legislation imposes a two-year driving ban for
anyone found driving over the limit.
Publicans outraged by the holiday trade losses are planning to lobby
politicians when the Dail, the Dublin parliament, ends its Christmas
break.

A FULL-scale search was mounted yesterday for three new year revellers
-- while they slept soundly.
The search, however, took a tragic turn when the helicopter recovered
a woman's body from the River Nith. She was later identified as Mrs
Eleanor Belford, 46, of Millgreen House, Dumfries.
Police said a post-mortem examination would be held today but there
appeared to be no suspicious circumstances.
The hunt was sparked off when police received a phone call saying some
people appeared to be in distress in the river at Glencaple near
Dumfries at about 5.15am.
Coastguards, a search helicopter, inshore rescue boat and police
tracker dogs were called in.
Initial inquiries led police to believe that three people had ended up
in the fast flowing river -- Donna Fawcett, 34, her brother Rodney, 28,
and his friend Keith Green, 27, all of Lockerbie, Dumfriesshire.
But they were perfectly safe and well and unaware that the big hunt
was in progress.
Donna, a factory worker of Hayrigg, Lockerbie, said: ''The first I
knew anything about it was when the police called at my home. I was able
to assure them that my brother Rodney and I were perfectly safe and that
we had not been in the river.''
She said they had been at a dance at the Nith Hotel, Glencaple, and
when it ended at about 1am they had gone home by taxi.
Keith, who was with them, decided to stay on in the village.
Rodney, a lorry driver, said last night: ''I wasn't at home when the
police called but I heard later about the search. I phoned the police to
try and find out how they came to believe we were in the river.
''But I didn't find out anything. It's still a mystery.''

THE 26-year-old wife of Celtic footballer Tony Mowbray has died after
a four-year battle against cancer.
Bernadette Mowbray, who married the Celtic player last Easter, died at
home in her husband's arms on New Year's Day.
Mrs Mowbray was diagnosed as suffering from terminal cancer early last
year. She had defeated breast cancer but discovered that it had spread
to her hip, liver and lungs.
The couple decided to bring their wedding forward when they learned
the extent of her illness and were married last April. Initially they
had planned to wed in Antigua last June, at the end of the season.
The couple were married in St Charles Church in Paisley surrounded by
500 guests, including Tony's team-mates Paul McStay, Pat Bonner, Charlie
Nicholas and Peter Grant.
Father Ben O'Keefe told the congregation that the church had been
deluged with letters and telephone calls from wellwishers.
Last night Mr Mowbray, 31, who joined Celtic from Middlesbrough for
#1m in 1991, said: ''I consider myself fortunate to have been by my
wife's side when eventually the moment came. She died in my arms with
her family surrounding her which is the way she wanted it.''
Bernadette's father, Mr Jimmy Doyle, said: ''I would like to say for
Bernadette's family how proud we are of the strength and the support
that Tony has given all of us. He is a very special person indeed.''
A spokesman for Celtic Football Club said: ''Everyone at Parkhead is
deeply saddened. Tony and his wife were very popular characters and we
will be giving him and his family every support that we can.''
Mrs Mowbray will be buried later this week, although no funeral
arrangements have been finalised.
The family has asked that their privacy be respected.

ENGLISH cricket fans puzzled over the poor performances of their team
have another mystery to ponder: ''Where is the Elgin lorry driver?''
The Elgin lorry driver has become one of the stars of the Radio Five
Live Test Match commentary by the team which includes Australian guest
commentator Neville Oliver, responsible for putting Elgin on the map.
With plenty of time to kill as the English batsmen one by one filed
back to the pavilion, and not much cricket to discuss, the commentary
team headed by Jonathan Agnew digressed.
They discussed their lunch, their fanmail, and somewhere along the way
the Royal Burgh on the banks of the River Lossie cropped up.
Neville Oliver, a television executive and a commentator Radio Five
Live use as often as possible, had never heard of Elgin, which not only
has a successful Highland League team and a 750-year old ruined
cathedral, but a cricket team which plays at Cooper Park.
Out of the conversation emerged a fictitious character, the Elgin
lorry driver, whose daily journeys were discussed by the team. ''If he
was in Dover at such and such a time then he must be near Glasgow now,''
they would muse.
''It really was an in-joke amongst the commentators,'' a Radio Five
Live spokesman told The Herald. ''I am afraid he does not exist.''
Neville may never have heard of Elgin, but at least one Elgin lorry
driver has never heard of Neville.
''I listen to Radio Five, but not the cricket I am afraid,'' said
Derek Bremner, 39, of Hargreaves Industrial Services in Elgin.
''I am surprised he has never heard of Elgin.''

FOREIGN Secretary Douglas Hurd last night launched a new campaign to
strengthen Tory support for Britain's membership of the European Union.
But he avoided the key single-currency issue which divides his party.
His attempt to thwart the Euro-sceptics coincided yesterday with a
blunt demand from ex-Chancellor Norman Lamont that the Prime Minister
should immediately reject the plan to abandon sterling for a
Euro-currency.
He said: ''We've had plenty of time to consider the pros and cons of a
single currency.
''I believe the time has come to say 'no'.''
Mr Lamont declared that he would not rejoin the European Exchange Rate
Mechanism (ERM), binding the pound to the German mark. It had its
benefits, but it is too inflexible, he told BBC radio. Britain left the
ERM in September 1992 when he was Chancellor.
''Last time the reunification of Germany is really what did us. There
is always some exceptional event that comes along that makes our economy
different from the others,'' Mr Lamont said, adding: ''I would be very
reluctant to rejoin the ERM.''
Since Mr Major sacked him as Chancellor, Mr Lamont has joined forces
with the Tory rebels who demand that the Prime Minister rejects a single
currency once and for all. Mr Major has said that there is no need to
make a decision now.
''The Prime Minister has tried to put off a decision over a single
currency, arguing that it is a matter to be decided by a future
Parliament,'' said Mr Lamont. ''John Major knows that his Cabinet is
split over whether to join one.''
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and Chancellor Kenneth Clarke are among
those who do not want a decision taken now. They fear that Britain might
find herself isolated from the heart of European activity, as a kind of
associate EU member.
Mr Hurd yesterday circulated Tory constituency groups with a briefing
note setting out what he called the ''overwhelming benefits'' of
Britain's full membership. It is designed to provide pro-Government
arguments for the debates ahead this year.
He recalls the 1975 referendum when membership was endorsed two-to-one
by voters. ''This was not woolly idealism, but hard-headed assessment of
our interests as a nation,'' he claims, since British business and jobs
had benefitted greatly.
He continues: ''The EU now takes 53% of our exports, compared to just
36% in 1973. Our exports to Germany alone now equal those to Japan and
the USA combined. We sell croissants to the French and pizzas to the
Italians.''
''Our business services in the decade to 1993 tripled to a #3bn trade
surplus with the rest of Europe. Between 1989-1992, our motor exports to
the EU rose from #3.7bn to #6.8bn. The overwhelming majority of European
share dealing and foreign exchange transactions now take place through
London. Even Deutschbank has moved all its foreign investment banking
from Frankfurt to London'', said Mr Hurd.
He calculates that millions of British jobs depend on trade with the
EU, while one third of all inward investment to the EU is attracted by
Britain -- worth 635,000 well-paid jobs.
He also suggests that 50 years of peace have resulted from the EU and
Nato. ''We can no longer imagine a war in Western Europe. It teaches us
to value an institution whose main goal is to enable Europeans to
resolve their disputes peacefully. For countries with overlapping and
often conflicting interests, that is no mean achievement.''
In contrast to the Euro-sceptics, Mr Hurd argues that Britain has more
world influence, not less, as a member of the EU.

<HEADLINE>Threat to shuttle services postponed. BA cabin staff furious over 'cut-price' crewing of Boston flight</HEADLINE>

THE threat of industrial action by cabin crew on British Airways
shuttle services over management moves to set up a ''cut-price'' crewing
operation at Glasgow, has been lifted -- at least for the time being.
The 180 Glasgow-based crew members had threatened to disrupt the
airline's short-haul flights including the shuttles between London and
Glasgow and Edinburgh.
But yesterday they voted to postpone the action pending a union
investigation into whether it was legal. They have decided, meantime, to
lobby their local MPs, fellow BA crew members, and the general public in
support of their fight.
The Glasgow-based crew members are furious that they have not been
offered work on the Glasgow to Boston service which is being launched
today. They claim the airline has recruited new air stewards and
stewardesses on up to 50% less pay.
Union solicitors, representing the crew members, are still
investigating the legalities of whether a strike ballot of shuttle crew,
at present employed by BA plc, can be held or not under current trade
union legislation.
It is understood that any strike on the shuttle services could be
classed as secondary action, because the Boston service will be operated
by BA Regional, a wholly-owned BA subsidiary set up two years ago to
develop transatlantic services flying out of Glasgow, Manchester and
Birmingham.
The Glasgow-based crew are all fully trained on 757s, which are the
mainstay of the shuttle fleet. But BA considers the existing crews to be
uneconomic for the transatlantic route and has been recruiting 34
''experienced cabin crew'' at pay and conditions that, it is claimed,
seriously undercut present salaries.
BA is said to be offering the recruits basic salaries of about #6000,
well short of the present #10,000 to #11,000 and nowhere near the
#16,000 to #18,000 average earnings.
Not only do existing crew feel their jobs are being undermined, they
also maintain that by ''virtually recruiting people off the streets and
turning them into operational crew within days, BA is making a mockery
of the extensive training and experience of existing crew''.
They have been told that their jobs are not threatened in any way but
fear the new base could be the thin end of the wedge that could result
in a re-run of BA's acquisition of British Caledonian which saw BCal
crews sacked then hired again at much reduced pay and conditions.
A spokeswoman for the Glasgow branch of the BA Stewards' and
Stewardesses' Association section of the TGWU, said yesterday after a
three-hour meeting: ''The last thing we want to do is to hurt the
general public.
''But our members are adamant that something must be done. I don't
think passengers want to be flying around with the so-called best
airline in the world which is undercutting all its normal training and
procedures.
''If our decision today had been based on pure emotion this base would
have ground to a halt immediately.''
The spokeswoman warned that the ''cut-price crewing operation'' at
Glasgow could have a lasting impact on thousands of other cabin crew
members employed by the company.
A BA Regional spokeswoman said that it had always recruited separately
and had always paid less than its mainline counterparts.

<HEADLINE>Rabin sets West Bank peace before settlers</HEADLINE>

CONSTRUCTION must halt on expanding a Jewish settlement in the
occupied West Bank in order to preserve the peace process, Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin said today.
''Under no circumstances will work continue on Date Hill,'' Rabin told
his Parliament, prompting angry heckling from the right-wing opposition.
Israel now plans to offer settlers building the 500-unit project a
smaller alternative site at Olive Hill, near an existing Jewish settler
community south of Jerusalem.
The Cabinet had voted 12 to four, with one abstention, to support
Rabin's position after hours of stormy debate.
Ministers from the left-wing Meretz block were opposed to any further
settlement construction, feeling that even expanding existing
settlements violated at least the spirit of the September 1993
Israel-PLO autonomy agreement.
The more conservative Cabinet members expressed concern that a blanket
ban would set a bad precedent for Israel's claims to the greater
Jerusalem area.
In the Knesset, the opposition accused Rabin of caving in to
Palestinian demands designed to limit Israeli control in the occupied
territories. PLO leader Yasser Arafat had warned that the project could
seriously harm the peace process.
''Who are you afraid of . . . Arafat? What has happened to your
Zionist values?'' Likud opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu demanded
after Rabin's speech.
Both right-wing Jewish groups and the Palestinians have used repeated
demonstrations to sharpen their demands since the controversy erupted on
December 22, when bulldozers started clearing the hilltop between the
Jewish settlement of Efrat and the Arab village of Al-Khader.
Efrat argued that it had Government approval to build 500 units on the
150-acre site, but Palestinians from Al-Khader village, just south of
Bethlehem, said the land was confiscated illegally.
Rabin decided that preserving the talks on expanding Palestinian
self-rule outweighed the possible confrontation with the core of the
120,000 Jewish settlers on the West Bank and their supporters in Israel
who oppose territorial compromise.
''This is the policy. We want peace and we want an agreement, we do
not want a bi-national state,'' said Rabin. ''We are talking about a
territorial compromise that will secure Jerusalem.''
Settler leader Uri Uriel said supporters would occupy the disputed
Date Hill site to protest at the plan to halt expansion.
Palestinian official Khader Shkeirat, who deals with land and water
issues, declared: ''They must stop settlement activity in the entire
West Bank.''--AP/Reuter.

THE BLIZZARDS which first-footed parts of Scotland on New Year's Day
left behind a hangover of deep snow which proved a headache for
motorists yesterday.
Many roads were affected in the Highlands and the North-east,
including the A92 Aberdeen to Fraserburgh, the A952 around Peterhead and
the A947 Aberdeen to Banff route.
A Grampian Police spokesman said motorists should stay at home unless
their journeys were essential.
Residents of Cruden Bay, Aberdeenshire, were cut off for a time
yesterday as all roads to the village were blocked.
In Highland region, the A9 was affected by drifting snow at Drumochter
Pass and on the west coast drifting snow slowed traffic on the A87 near
Kyle of Lochalsh.
Glasgow Weather Centre said that the lowest recorded sea-level
temperature on Sunday night was at Prestwick, Ayrshire, where the
mercury plunged to minus four celsius.
Conditions were arctic in the North yesterday with 35-knot winds on
Cairngorm and a wind chill factor of -25C.
However thousands of skiers took advantage of the conditions. Around
2000 were at Cairngorm, 1800 on the Nevis range, and 800 at the Lecht on
Glencoe for the first day of the season. Glenshee missed out as it
remained closed due to lack of snow.
In the North Sea, gale force winds and strong tides prompted the
partial evacuation of a gas drilling-rig early yesterday.
Sixteen workers were airlifted from the Santa Fe Britannia by
helicopter after heavy seas caused one of its legs to shift in sand.
They were transferred to the nearby Sean Pappa platform in the Sean
field about 70 miles north-east of Lowestoft, Suffolk.
High winds and snow and ice continued to pose problems in many areas
of England.
The National Rivers Authority said a red alert flood warnings remained
on the Suffolk and Essex coasts.
The Yorkshire coast was battered by exceptionally high seas, resulting
in sea walls being demolished and seafront roads flooded.
Beadnell in Northumberland was hit by a combination of gales and very
high tides causing waves to crash over the seafront. Residents in
Hornsea on Humberside were evacuated due to sea flooding.
Forecasters say Scotland will have a dry and frosty start today.
Cloudy weather with rain in the Western Isles by early afternoon will
extend to many other parts, although the far North-east and Shetland may
stay dry. The rain will turn to snow for a time as it moves across
Scotland.

ISRAELI troops shot dead three Palestinian policemen in a Gaza Strip
clash today in the worst such clash since Palestinians won limited
self-rule there.
In two separate clashes, soldiers also killed three armed Palestinians
in the occupied West Bank. A fourth Palestinian gunman was wounded.
A Palestinian policeman said Israeli soldiers, patrolling near Beit
Hanoun in the Gaza Strip, shot at Palestinian police, apparently
mistaking them for militants.
Israel radio said the soldiers opened fire after shots were fired at
them.

THE Government housing agency Scottish Homes will consider giving
direct help to some of the 150 families in Fort William's Plantation
housing estate who now fear greatly increased fuel bills because
Scottish Homes removed their insulation.
As the Herald exclusively reported last month, the agency, which owns
the houses, decided to remove the insulation to try to solve a chronic
dampness problem in the Plantation. However, tenants who had no dampness
before are now suffering. Associated health problems are also being
reported.
Following the Herald article, Sir Russell Johnston, MP for Inverness,
Nairn and Lochaber, wrote to the chairman of Scottish Homes, Sir James
Mellon, asking for an explanation.
Sir James has now replied. He continues to insist that in the majority
of houses the insulation had deteriorated to such an extent that it was
having no noticeable effect in keeping houses well heated.
''Therefore leaving it (the insulation) in the houses would have
offered no advantage to tenants either in terms of comfort or savings.''
However, this was not the view of the tenants the Herald interviewed.
Sir James does appear to concede that the removal of the insulation
might lead to increased heating costs in some cases and suggests that
Scottish Homes might be prepared to help.
''It is difficult to know in advance who is most likely to be affected
by higher costs, but we will certainly seek independent advice in
assessing high bills received at the end of the period, and give serious
consideration to providing direct assistance where the removal of
insulation appears to have been a contributing factor.''
Sir Russell told the Herald that he hoped it would be of some comfort
to the Plantation tenants that independent advice would be sought in
assessing the high bills, and that Scottish Homes would give serious
consideration to giving direct help to those who had suffered from the
insulation being removed.
He concluded: ''And let us hope that the work can be completed as
quickly as humanly possible.''
Mr Jim Brady, chairman of the Plantation Community Association, said:
''Obviously we would be pleased if Scottish Homes gave financial
assistance to help some people. But it really does anger me the way they
persist with the idea that the insulation was not doing any good and
therefore nobody should complain.
''If that was the case why is it that houses which have stood for the
best part of 30 years without a trace of damp now have black marks up
their walls? There are mothers with young children in these houses and
they are suffering.
''What has never been explained is why they had to take the insulation
out of all 150 houses before replacing it in any. Why couldn't they have
taken it out of half a dozen at a time, replacing it as they went along?
It will be another winter before they are all back to normal.''

NEARLY 50% of manufacturers in Scotland are finding it difficult to
recruit skilled staff, Labour claimed yesterday.
According to Mr John McFall, Labour's Scottish employment spokesman,
the shortages were hindering 46% of manufacturing employers and 42% of
employers in the service sector.
Many manufacturing firms had indicated that the lack of skilled labour
would curtail their output in the coming months.
Mr McFall said the information had come to light in a recent survey
carried out by the Department of Employment.
Mr McFall said: ''It has been clear for some time now that Scotland's
ability to rebuild its economy is being severely hampered by an acute
skill shortage in some sectors. However, the Government's response to
the clear need being expressed by Scottish businessmen has been to slash
#15m from next year's Scottish Enterprise budget.
''Since responsibility for training moved to the Scottish Office last
year, Ian Lang has chosen to do absolutely nothing to deal with the
problem.''
Mr McFall said the decision to cut #15m was particularly harmful
because Scottish Enterprise had been given extra duties, including
helping develop small businesses.
Mr McFall said that Mr Lang knew full well that asking an organisation
to expand its activities while cutting its budget must lead to a
dilution in the quality of the service provided.
Mr McFall also claimed that Scotland had a lower incidence of
job-related training than the rest of Britain, and that there was a
seeming reluctance by employers to offer training to staff who did not
already have an academic qualification. He urged Scottish Enterprise to
redouble its efforts to encourage businessmen to recognise the of
training.
Meanwhile, SNP leader Alex Salmond yesterday published figures which
show that more than #10bn is forecast to be generated in Government
revenue for the North Sea over the next few years.
''These figures illustrate the buoyancy of the North Sea sector,'' Mr
Salmond said.
He added: ''Scotland has resources in abundance. We are the most
energy rich country in the European Union. With the freedom of
independence, our energy resources can be developed to help power a new
Scotland in a new Europe.''

A YOUNG man who was shot in the street on Hogmanay waited for nearly
36 hours before telling the police, it was revealed yesterday.
Police were angry that Robert Hamilton, 20, took almost a day and a
half to tell them he had been shot.
Mr Hamilton from Laighmuir Street, Uddingston, Lanarkshire, was shot
in the legs in the early hours of Saturday, as he returned from a party.
Mr Hamilton, his right leg heavily bandaged, said he had no clue as to
why he was shot in Hamilton's Laighstonehall Street.
Detectives investigating the incident say they are annoyed that any
victim of a shooting should wait before alerting the authorities.
Recovering at his home, Mr Hamilton described how the attack happened.
He said: ''I had been out at a party and was walking back to a
friend's house when a car drove by and slowed down.
''The next thing I knew a gun was fired at the ground and the shot
bounced up and hit me on the legs.
''It didn't half spoil my New Year but it just seems to be one of
these things that happen. I have no idea why they did this or who it
was.''
The shooting happened at 1 am on Saturday morning, but it wasn't until
about 11 am the next day that Robert reported the shooting to the
police.
He was taken by ambulance to Monklands District Hospital where he was
treated for pellet injuries to both legs.
A senior detective said yesterday: ''Mr Hamilton was not in a position
to discuss the incident on Sunday.
''Obviously we want to know much more about this incident and are
definitely not happy that there should have been such a long delay in
reporting this to us. We will be interviewing him further.''

THE campaign to ensure that Gaelic continues to be a language spoken
by some of Scotland's children will shift its focus from the Highlands
and Islands to Glasgow and the west of Scotland over the next three
years.
According to Mr Finlay Macleod, the director of Comhairle Sgoiltean
Araich, the Gaelic pre-school playgroup association, opportunities for
development in the north and west are currently constrained by a lack of
teachers to teach in Gaelic-medium schools. That is not the case around
Glasgow.
He told The Herald: ''We can expand a great deal there. The
opportunity for development in the area is much greater than anywhere
else in Scotland. You certainly have 6000 Gaelic speakers in Glasgow
itself and in the whole area it might be as many as 20000.
''So we have access to a lot more people to set up pre-school groups
and follow on. There is also a sufficiency of Gaelic teachers. There are
many teaching in the English side of primary education who could move
over to the Gaelic side.''
Mr Macleod, who many see as the man who has done most to save the
Gaelic language over the last 15 years, stressed that his organisation
would not be abandoning the Highlands and islands and would carry on
with efforts there.
''Our main problem in the south-west, however, is that we have only
one development officer, who is being asked to cover 2.2m people, almost
half of Scotland's population,'' he said.
''We desperately need more staff, another six development officers,
but we don't have the money to do it. We are looking to anyone who can
help.
Mr Macleod conceded that an enormous amount had been achieved over the
past two decades but insisted that efforts had to be maintained or
ground would be lost very quickly.
''In 1981, I could find only 99 or 100 pre-school children who could
speak Gaelic in the whole of Scotland. Now I know of at least 600
families bringing up their children speaking Gaelic, often with only one
of the parents a Gaelic speaker.
''We now have 142 pre-school groups, three Gaelic nurseries, 47 Gaelic
medium schools, and six secondary schools which teach some subjects in
Gaelic.''
Mr Macleod said the real problem was with adult learners whose numbers
did not match those at the bottom of the age range. At last there was a
year's course at Sabhal Mor Ostaig, the Gaelic college on Skye, which
immersed adult learners.
''I understand it is very successful and that there is great demand,
with five or six of this year's intake intending to go on to a college
of education to pursue Gaelic medium education,'' he said. ''But this is
the first course that I could point my finger at.
''According to the 1991 census, there were 66,000 Gaelic speakers in
Scotland. Unfortunately, the older Gaels are dying off at about 1500 a
year. At the very least, we have to be producing about 2000 a year to
replace them, just to stand still.''
Meanwhile, Mr Macleod is to launch a campaign to persuade the Scottish
banks to produce bank notes which carry the Gaelic language as well as
English in an effort to raise the prominence of the language in national
life.

HEAVY snowfalls may help catch the animals behind a series of
sheep-slayings.
Expert trackers may be called in to follow the killer beasts' trails
through the deep snow which has fallen in the last few days.
The unidentified killers have slaughtered at least eight sheep within
a 30-mile radius in Grampian over the last month.
The attacks have been so ferocious that only the sheeps' heads,
spines, and a few ribs have remained.
Banff area president of the National Farmers' Union, Mr Jim Christie,
said he would be holding a committee meeting this week to discuss what
farmers could do to stop the attacks.
''We are looking carefully at what action to take, but if these
killings continue, we will have to consider the use of things such as
trackers,'' said Mr Christie, who himself has a flock of over 300 ewes.
''Now there is snow on the ground it would be possible to trace the
steps, but we will have to see what the response is at the meeting.''
The most recent attack was a triple-slaying at Aberlour last week, but
all efforts to locate the brutes responsible have so far been
unsuccessful.
Mr Christie said it was not unusual for sheep-worrying to take place,
but attacks on this scale were unknown.
''It is unlikely that it is a pack of wolves and the vet's report
suggests that it is canine rather than feline,'' said Mr Christie, who
farms at Drummuir, near Keith.
''We are advising our members to take whatever precautions they can
until we discover what is behind these killings.''

INCREASED overnight staffing on an unusual shift may have helped
prevent an even greater tragedy in the Aviemore hotel fire in which two
guests died.
A large number of staff remained on night duty after a Hogmanay
function ended to prepare guests' breakfasts.
That meant they were quickly on the scene to help evacuate 190 guests,
including 32 children, from the Four Seasons Hotel when fire broke out
just before 5am.
Alex Pagett, corporate affairs director of Stakis Hotels, which owns
the Four Seasons, said yesterday: ''Unusually, although it is normal at
New Year because of the revellers, staff had to stay up during the night
and prepare breakfasts.
''They were doing that when the fire was discovered and were able to
react quickly.''
He went on: ''To that extent we are pleased at the way it was
contained, although obviously devastated at the loss of life.''
Patricia Shaw, 55, from Leeds, who had the lung disease emphysema,
died as she was being rescued.
And company director Graham Strachan, 64, of Strathblane,
Stirlingshire, was pronounced dead after being found on an escape
stairway.
His wife Catherine,
59, was in the intensive care unit at Inverness's Raigmore Hospital
yesterday where her condition was described as ''stable''.
A fatal accident inquiry is likely given the circumstances.
Some of the guests decided to go home early after the tragedy but most
were relocated to other hotels.
Mr Pagett said no decisions on further reimbursement for guests had
been taken yet. ''We will do whatever is appropriate and adequate for
our guests.''
Police and fire investigation teams re-entered the hotel yesterday
morning to continue attempts to establish how it began.
Stakis do not know the cost of the damage or when the eight-storey
hotel may reopen.
Highland and Islands Fire Brigade depute firemaster Bob Gordon said
investigations into the cause of the fire may take some time because of
the severe fire damage in the chefs' storeroom area.
He praised the ''remarkable'' efforts of six Aviemore firemen who were
first on the scene and contained the blaze for 20 minutes before
reinforcements arrived.

COUPLES who are planning to marry or live together later this year
have been invited to participate in a research project to see whether
the arrangement changes their decisions about buying, preparing, and
eating food.
Researchers from Glasgow and Edinburgh universities are keen to
establish whether the eating habits of two individuals are compromised
or whether each perhaps ends up indulging in the culinary delights
normally preferred by the other.
The researchers are looking for about 50 couples in the Edinburgh and
Glasgow areas who plan to marry or start living together from Easter,
who would be willing to be interviewed twice -- three months before
setting up home, and three months afterwards.
It must be their first marriage or co-habitation, and they should be
childless.
The two-year project, which has received about #80,000 of funding from
the Economic &amp; Social Research Council, is being carried out by Dr
Deborah Kemmer, a sociologist at Glasgow University.
She said yesterday: ''Eating together is central to living together
and in the early stages of marriage or co-habiting, the eating habits of
two individuals are changing to become the eating habits of a couple.
''In marriage, food and meals have significant, symbolic functions
which affect the choice of food, its preparation, the way it is served,
and how it is eaten.
''The role of the gender in taking decisions and performing tasks is
crucial to our understanding of marital relationships. People setting up
home together are at a period of transition. We believe that this is a
particularly valuable time for studying and understanding behaviour.''
Dr Kemmer added: ''This research may ultimately help people buy and
choose food wisely and well.''
Meanwhile, sweet-toothed Britons are munching their way through
ever-increasing mountains of chocolate, says a major report today.
Kit Kat remains the favourite chocolate brand, followed by Mars Bar,
Cadbury's Dairy Milk and Galaxy.
Dairy Milk is the number one pure chocolate bar, with sales of more
than #100 million in 1994. Cadbury's Roses are the top boxed chocolates,
followed by Quality Street, Cadbury's Milk Tray and Thornton's
Continental. Cadbury's Creme Eggs, Cadbury's Mini Eggs and Cadbury's
Buttons Eggs are the leading Easter chocolates.
Sales of boxed chocolates grew by 9% in 1994 and now account for
nearly a quarter of the chocolate market. Nearly two-thirds of boxes of
chocolates made are produced at Christmas.
Chocolate-lovers in south-west England chomped the most last year,
spending an average of #163.71 per household on the confections,
compared to a national average of #136.71.
Households in central and northern Scotland spent an average of
#155.97, Welsh and west England households #145.80. Londoners were
bottom of the table, spending #124.25 per household.

POLICE were yesterday investigating the tragedy of a New Year reveller
who is thought to have lost his way in unfamiliar surroundings and
frozen to death.
A holiday couple out for a walk found the snow-covered body of first
footer Denis Rettie, aged 45.
He was lying face up on a track a couple of miles from his new home in
Westford, Alness, Easter Ross.
Friends yesterday blamed his death on Mr Rettie's unfamiliarity with
the area.
Mrs Jean Graham owner of the Glenskiach Hotel in Evanton, said: ''We
can only assume Denis got a bit confused and lost his way in what for
him were new surroundings.
''By mistake he took this dead-end track along the River Averon
leading out of Alness.
''He would have been looking for his own flat or going to first foot
his sister who also lives in Alness.''
She added: ''He will be sadly missed. He was a very nice person, a
great character, quietly spoken and full of stories.''
Mr Rettie, orginally from Golspie, Sutherland, was dressed in a
leather jacket, jeans and light shoes when he was found 20 yards from
the end of the track late on New Year's afternoon.
The bachelor was last seen on Hogmanay.
As police last night tried to contact relatives in the south to tell
them of the tragedy a senior officer of the Northern Constabulary said
foul play was not suspected and a report would be going to the
Procurator Fiscal.
A postmortem is expected to take place at Raigmore Hospital, Inverness
either today or tomorrow.

FIRE yesterday damaged Stormont Castle -- the seat of the former
Northern Ireland Parliament in Belfast.
Firefighters took two hours to put out the blaze which destroyed the
old Commons debating chamber. The building is not protected by a
sprinkler system.
Suspicions amongst unionists that the fire may have been started
deliberately were rejected by Northern Ireland Minister Malcolm Moss,
who said there was no evidence to suggest arson.
Last night Mr James Kilfedder -- a former Speaker at Stormont and
chairman of the Westminster Select Committee on Northern Ireland affairs
-- demanded a full investigation.
He said: ''I want to know why fire preventative measures were not
working effectively.''
The blaze was spotted by security men on duty inside the buildings and
two RUC officers exercising police dogs in the vast grounds outside.
By the time fire crews arrived the flames had taken hold in the
Commons Chamber in part of the west wing.
The building has never had a sprinkler system, but one was due to be
fitted as part of a #3m refurbishment scheme to be completed next
summer.
Although the cause of the fire has not yet been established the Rev
Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, said he had been
told police were treating it as ''malicious''.
However, Mr Moss, who inspected the damage, said: ''Any allegations
that it was malicious have been refuted strongly by both the RUC and the
fire service.''
It is understood most of the building's 100 staff had been due to move
out at the end of the month because of the renovations. No workmen had
been inside since before Christmas.
Some Northern Ireland MPs were furious that no fire warning measures
were in place.
Democratic Unionist MP for East Belfast, Mr Peter Robinson, demanded a
high-powered independent public inquiry.
He added: ''It is recklessly irresponsible no adequate security or
fire warning measures were in place. Just imagine -- a man walking his
dog has to raise the alarm that the province's most historic buidling is
on fire.''
Ulster Unionist MP John Taylor said he was shocked to hear that the
Stormont fire was discovered by someone walking in the grounds ''and
that security within the parliament buildings was non-existent.
''If this is correct, then the present Northern Ireland Office
Minister responsible for security at Stormont should resign at once,''
he said.
Sir James, Unionist MP for north Down and Speaker at the Northern
Ireland Assembly -- the last administration to meet at Stormont until it
was dissolved in 1986 -- said he hoped the fire would not disrupt the
developing peace process.
He added: ''Parliament buildings had been the focus for political
progress in 1995, and it is a tragedy that the New Year should have
begun with this disastrous fire.''
At one stage during the blaze there were 10 fire crews in action.
The fire was was confined to the Commons Chamber area on the ground
and first floors where MPs in the old Northern Ireland Parliament once
sat.
Corridors were also badly damaged by smoke and water, but nearby
rooms, which were used for exploratory talks involving senior civil
servants, Sinn Fein and loyalist representatives, escaped the flames.
More meetings are planned there later this month.

BRITAIN'S improving trade position will culminate in a current account
surplus next year, a leading group of economic forecasters said
yesterday.
Cambridge Econometrics said there was a marked improvement in the UK's
underlying trade performance in key industries during the past decade,
supplemented by the sharp boost to competitiveness and profitability
given by sterling's devaluation in September 1992.
The slow domestic recovery and weak world prices helped ensure it was
not eroded by increases in domestic costs, while the upturn in Europe
led to rapid growth in Britain's key export markets.
''These factors are giving a short-term boost to the steady gains in
trade performance over the past 10 years,'' CE said.
In 1996 it forecasts that 5% export volume growth compared with just
under 5% for imports will lead to a current account surplus of #1.1
billion, the first since 1985.
Industries expected to record the most rapid output growth this year
are: 1. Air transport; 2. Electronics; 3. Computing service; 4.
Pharmaceuticals; 5. Motor vehicles; 6. Gas supply; 7. Other transport
services; 8. Rubber &amp; plastics; 9. Waste treatment; 10. Manufactured
fuels.

Sarajevo, Monday
THE United Nations scored another victory for peace in Bosnia today
when the Bosnian Croats joined a landmark truce accord signed two days
ago by the chief antagonists in the 33-month conflict.
The Muslim-led Bosnian Government and its Bosnian Serb opponents
signed the four-month truce agreement on Saturday.
Only the Serbs from the Krajina region of Croatia, fighting in the
north-west Bihac enclave, have yet to sign the pact that was brokered
last month by former US president Jimmy Carter.
UN spokesman Thant Myint-U said that Muslim-Croat Federation president
Kresimir Zubak signed the ceasefire on behalf of the Croats in the
presence of the UN commander in Bosnia, Britain's Lieutenant-General Sir
Michael Rose.
The agreement was signed in the Croat stronghold of Mostar in southern
Bosnia, after the United Nations repeatedly voiced its concern over
reports that Bosnian Croat troops, initially not a party to the accord,
were still fighting the Serbs.
Fighting in Bihac, involving Bosnian and Krajina Serbs alongside rebel
Muslims against the Bosnian Government army 5th Corps, threatened to
scupper the truce last week.
''We are trying to to put an end to Serb involvement in Bihac
fighting, now that the truce has taken effect,'' a UN source said.
General Rose secured rebel Muslim agreement last week when he visited
the Bihac enclave.
Bosnian front-lines remained largely quiet today but the truce was
violated in Sarajevo when a missile slammed into the Holiday Inn hotel.
There were no casualties.--Reuter.

Adelaide, Monday
FRENCH solo yachtswoman Isabelle Autissier, plucked from her battered
yacht in stormy seas halfway between Australia and Antarctica, was back
on dry land today, but her heart remained at sea.
Autissier told reporters her life for the past three years had
revolved around her boat, the Ecureuil Poitou Charentes II, which
remained adrift 900 miles south of Adelaide.
She said she would like nothing better than to save it.
''It is very difficult. This boat represents three years of my life.
We are very close, one to the other,'' she told a news conference at an
air force base north of Adelaide.
As she spoke, an Australian trawler was making its way towards the
yacht in an attempt to salvage it.
''I'm glad to know that something has been organised,'' said
Autissier. ''She can be towed, I hope, the sea is not too rough. That is
my main pleasure to know that, because this boat is quite important to
me.''
Autissier, the only woman in the BOC Round the World Solo challenge
race, was flown by helicopter from the Australian frigate Darwin to
Edinburgh Air Force Base.
''I am here because of you and I will never forget that,'' Autissier,
38, told the helicopter crew.--Reuter.

THE news of Graham Strachan's tragic death on New Year's Day will be
keenly felt throughout the Scottish industrial community.
The handsome tribute to his life and work in yesterday's Herald
acknowledged the scope and professionalism of his contribution to
industrial Clydeside.
His many friends will remember his commitment to the wider cause of
Scotland's economic well-being. He was a tireless supporter of the
Scottish Council Forum and for many years a member of its governing
committee.
It is all the more poignant that he should have lost his life in the
very Aviemore hotel (then known as the Strathspey) which had been the
forum's base for so many years. His wife Catherine often accompanied him
there on forum business as she did this fateful Hogmanay. Their friends
will unite in praying for her.
Graham's enthusiasm for generating new ideas to advance the economic
prosperity of Scotland was matched by an equal commitment to effective
action. As chairman of the Scottish Council Foundation, he worked hard
to raise funds for the foundation's flagship -- the young engineers'
clubs. Indeed, yesterday's Herald photograph was part of a larger study
showing a delighted Mr Strachan receiving a substantial cheque for this
important work.
Graham was an accomplished engineer and a successful industrialist,
but he knew that there was more to business than the bottom line. He was
always receptive to new ideas and relished the challenge of a difficult
assignment. Above all he was a good friend. We shall miss him very much.

The death in exile on Monday of former Somali president Mohamed Siad
Barre was unlikely to cause much grief in his homeland.
Siad Barre, who died in a Nigerian hospital aged 84, ruled Somalia
like a dictator for most of his 22 years in power.
Many blame him for fanning the clan rivalries that ruined the Horn of
Africa country and are expected to erupt with a vengeance when UN troops
withdraw by March 30.
Driven by rebels from his palace in Mogadishu in 1991, Siad Barre was
forced out of his stronghold in the southwest a year later. He fled
first to Kenya with 1200 supporters and members of his huge family
before finding asylum in Nigeria in May 1992.
He was army commander when he seized power in 1969, pledging to
preserve democracy and outlaw corruption and tribalism.
But his years in charge saw a failed dalliance with communism, a
disastrous war with neighbouring Ethiopia over the Ogaden region in
1977-78 and economic stagnation.
Somalia achieved independence in 1960 as the result of the merger of
the British Somaliland Protectorate and Italian Somaliland.
Siad Barre's efforts to promote literacy and development earned him
some popularity. He is survived by two wives and 19 children.

Washington, Monday
THE old guard is moving out, and the new taking over, with mid-winter
jubilation. There is a new governor of New York, a new mayor of
Washington, and on Wednesday a new Congress.
It was all there in the photograph of Mr George Pataki being sworn in
as governor of New York. Off to one side, ignored, sat Mario Cuomo. He
had been governor for 12 years and is now looking for work.
Governor Pataki announced a leaner, meaner government, cutting
welfare, introducing the death penalty, and all those good things.
He shared the platform with Howard Stern, host of a radio show:
Republicans used to call it obscene until he turned out the votes.
That was yesterday. Today, Marion Barry returned to city hall in
Washington. The message is, redemption is possible. He served 12 years
as mayor and six months in prison.
He ran up huge deficits in his first term and expected the Government
to bail him out. Then he was caught snorting cocaine in a police video,
and lost his job. However, he ran for city council, from its poorest
ward, and spent the four years preparing to return.
Voters forgave him last November, and here he is again.
The city's financial situation has got worse during his absence: it
has a current account deficit of $500m, its population has dropped, and
the new Congress will be less sympathetic than the old.
Wednesday will be the great day. The Republicans will enter the
promised land, and for a while they too will believe they can actually
get things done.
Washington has defeated a whole series of presidents and Congresses in
the past quarter-century. Ronald Reagan thought he was getting
somewhere, but in fact things looked pretty much the same after he left
office.
The new Congress will try to dismantle what remains of them.
But that is easier said than done. All those budget-trimmers who now
control the committees of the House of Representatives have their own
interests to protect.
The question is not whether the Republicans will fall short.
Of course they will. What really matters is whether they can persuade
the electorate they are achieving miracles, even when it's more of the
same.

THE Prince of Wales yesterday arrived with the Princes William and
Harry in Switzerland for a week's skiing holiday in Klosters.
Prince Charles was settling into his private suite in the Walserhof
Hotel after pulling rank to oust the Duchess of York, who has been
staying there with her daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.
It is understood that the duchess had booked the suite, owned by
brewery heir Peter Greenall, until next weekend, but pressure was
brought to bear and she agreed to allow Charles and his sons to move in.
Klosters is the favourite skiing resort of both the prince and the
duchess. They always stay in the Walserhof, which boasts some of the
finest cooking in the Alps.
It is thought the duchess is keen to play down the inconvenience of
moving apartments but royal watchers predict a frosty atmosphere.
There was also speculation that Sarah may now return to England before
the end of the week.
Snow was falling when Charles and his sons arrived at Zurich airport,
then boarded a Range Rover for the two-and-a-half hour drive to the
resort.
The young princes were wrapped against the cold in dark overcoats and
Harry waved to the assembled ranks of photographers.
The boys, aged 12 and 10, were accompanied by Tiggy Legge-Burke, who
acts as their chaperone and diary organiser for Charles.
Also with the party were four detectives and a member of the local
police, who drove in the convoy which left the airport.
The Duchess of York spent the day skiing. She and her party are now
staying in another suite on the floor above the rooms occupied by
Charles.
It is thought the two groups will not mix much -- it was understood
that the duchess had been asked to change her holiday arrangments to
avoid a clash of schedules, but she refused.
Prince Charles and the duchess have rarely met in recent years -- her
isolation from the rest of the royal family was shown at Christmas at
Sandringham when she stayed in a small house on the edge of the estate
away from the rest of the festivities.
The prince is also taking over the duchess's ski guide, Bruno
Sprecher, who has accompanied Sarah's party over the past few days.
Bruno is a close friend of both the duchess and Prince Charles, and was
guiding the prince's party when it was engulfed in an avalanche in 1988.
The prince and his party will hit the ski slopes for the first time
today.
Also with Charles's group was his private secretary, Commander Richard
Aylard, who was accompanied by his daughter Emily.
Commander Aylard's daughter, Sophie, was being looked after by his
secretary Catherine Bateman.
The royal party drove through blizzards to reach Klosters and the
princes were met in the hotel by the duchess and the two young
princesses.
* The Princess of Wales flew back to London yestereday at the end of
her five-day ski-ing holiday in the Rocky Mountain resort of Vail,
Colorado.
She slipped quietly home on a scheduled flight.

MARRIED couples and working fathers are being discriminated against in
favour of lone parents, a report says today.
The controversial study by a right-wing think tank accuses ministers
of following an agenda which boosts the status of lone parenthood --
making marriage an ''unaffordable luxury''.
As a result, a lone parent can take home more than a married father
with the same number of children despite the fact that the father's
income supports an additional adult.
Patricia Morgan, a researcher for the Institute of Economic Affairs,
claims the Government's new childcare allowance has made the situation
even worse.
She argues that a lone mother with two small children can work for 20
hours at #4 an hour and end up with a net income of #163 after rent and
tax.
In contrast, a married father of two small children working for 40
hours at the same rate would have #130 -- receiving #33 less for working
full time.
She writes: ''What sort of message is this sending out to young people
who are planning their lives? Instead of encouraging them to think in
terms of making a permanent commitment to a partner in order to bring up
children in a stable environment, we seem to be saying, don't get
married.
''For many people, especially at the bottom of the earnings scale,
marriage has become an unaffordable luxury. They would lose more in
benefits than the husband's income could compensate for.''
More and more people were drifting into short-term relationships, with
the result that growing numbers of children faced a disrupted
upbringing.
Recent legislation such as the the Child Support Act and the Children
Act made no recognition of marriage and assumed men could be made to act
as responsible fathers, she argues.
Ms Morgan concludes that married couples with children must get the
same benefits as lone parents.

A BBC camera crew was released unharmed after being detained for 20
hours near the Chechen capital of Grozny.
The team -- British producer Kate Peters and two Australians -- were
''safe and well'', according to a spokeswoman.
They were arrested yesterday in Tolstoy Yurt, 15 miles north of
Grozny.
Initially a BBC spokesman said they had been detained by Chechens.
Later, he said it was understood to be Russians who had detained the
crew.

Grozny, Monday
CHECHEN fighters, pistols and Kalashnikov assault rifles blazing,
scrambled through a wasteland of gutted buildings today to confront
Russian soldiers struggling to take control of their capital.
The fighters appeared to be in control of much of the centre of Grozny
a day after impeding a New Year's Eve advance on the city by Russian
armoured vehicles.
Missiles screamed overhead and residents ran for cover as Russian
planes swooped low over largely pulverised buildings.
Middle-aged Chechen fighters blasted away with Kalashnikov automatic
rifles at young Russian troops taking cover a mere 300ft away behind
walls and street kiosks.
Fog and smoke hung thickly in front of the imposing concrete
presidential palace, guarded noisily by about a hundred Chechens waving
guns and the Chechen flag of green, white, and red.
Shells exploded outside charred buildings and fighter planes buzzed
overhead from time to time. Chechens crouched behind bus shelters and
the remnants of houses to fire at Russian soldiers.
One Reuter correspondent counted 17 burned-out tanks and other
armoured vehicles outside the railway station, scene of pitched battles
through the early hours.
Ten bodies lay scattered on the ground nearby and a fire was blazing
out of control in the middle of the railyard. A soldier's boot and
helmet were strewn among debris.
Other corpses were strewn in the street, some in pools of blood. One
badly-injured woman was still breathing, but there was no-one to treat
her.
The victims included a journalist for the Russian military daily
Krasnaya Zvezda, Vladimir Zhitarenko, killed in Chechnya on New Year's
Eve. He was the second correspondent to die in the fighting, after a
28-year-old American freelance photographer.
No accurate figures are available for the number of casualties from
the fighting and from Russian bombing and shelling raids. Chechens say
thousands of people have died.
Western correspondents said the ground floor of the presidential
palace in the centre of Grozny had been turned into a makeshift
operating theatre. The doctors worked with no electricity or
anaesthetic.
Many buildings were reduced to shells, with only television antennae
protruding eerily from the roofs, after three weeks of night bombing and
two days of street combat.
''Mama! Mama!'' one fighter shouted through a fence outside a house,
apparently taking a break from city centre combat.
A man and woman loaded possessions onto a motorcycle and sidecar,
deciding belatedly to join the tens of thousands who have decided to
flee Grozny.
''Where do you expect me to go? My daughter lives outside Moscow, my
son in Orenburg,'' said one elderly woman in a courtyard, when asked why
she had remained. ''We're all in the basement, all Russians.''
On a road outside town, the bodies of five young Russian soldiers lay
in light snow after coming under attack in the failed tank and armoured
vehicle advance.
''They threw the bodies out and fled,'' said one of several men
gathered around the corpses on snow-covered ground.
In a house controlled by the rebels, three Russian soldiers, aged no
more than 18, were put on display for reporters after being captured in
fighting for the railway station. One was badly bruised.
''I'm from Saratov,'' mumbled one of the three, clearly terrified.
''Louder, louder!'' shouted the men gathered in the room. The boy
winced.
On the city outskirts, Reuter reporter Oleg Shchedrov saw the bodies
of three men and a woman killed after two large bombs hit a local
market. Locals said 12 people had been injured.
They said a single Russian plane flew overhead, dropped two bombs and
then returned to strafe the area with heavy machinegun fire. One man was
killed by shrapnel, they said, and the others machinegunned to the
ground.
Russia's Ostankino television, the most sympathetic to the Government
line, showed soldiers celebrating the New Year in tents.
''It was a sad holiday,'' said the commentator, ''but we must remember
that we are one Russia.''
However a group of Russian deputies just back in Moscow from Grozny
said Russian forces had ''suffered a crushing defeat''.
''Thousands of innocent people have died, tens of thousands made
homeless. Hundreds of servicemen have died,'' it said.
''The Government is concealing the truth about losses. We are talking
about mass murder tantamount to genocide . . .
Soldiers have no idea what they are fighting for.''--Reuter.

THE Contraceptive Education Service predicted yesterday that 1995 was
going to be the year of the Euro-condom.
A new European Standard for male condoms is expected to be introduced,
together with a CE mark which will complement and eventually replace the
British Standard Kite Mark.
The new standard also means more choice, says the CES, as it will
allow a range of sizes to be available.
This follows reports from clinics last year that some men have been
complaining about the tight fit of the uni-size British condom, and that
some have split as a result.
Perhaps disturbingly for the CES -- which is run by the Family
Planning Association and the four UK health education agencies --
condoms are still not considered essential for casual sexual encounters.
Male condoms are used by 16% of couples, most of them over 25, and in
stable relationships, rather than single young people. Although they can
protect against HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases, pelvic
inflammatory disease and cervical cancer -- as well as unplanned
pregnancies -- research shows that people are still not using condoms
consistently and correctly.
''Current advice is that whatever form of contraceptive couples use,
they should also protect each other's sexual health by using condoms
too,'' urges the CES. ''However, even among young condom users, around
one in four admits they would have unprotected sex with a new partner.
''Calls to the Family Planning Association helpline in Scotland (041
332 1216) show that there is still considerable embarrassment and
misunderstanding about sex and contraception.''

Grozny, Monday
RUSSIAN troops and ill-equipped Chechen defenders fought pitched
battles in the streets of Grozny, and Moscow acknowledged several dozen
of its armoured vehicles had been destroyed.
Hundreds of people were reported killed in what was the fiercest
fighting in Moscow's three-week campaign to force oil-producing Chechnya
to abandon its independence drive.
The Kremlin said its troops were ''regrouping'', a tacit admission of
the difficulty in subduing Grozny to crush Chechen President Dzhokhar
Dudayev's independence bid.
The government later said its troops ''still'' controlled most of
Grozny but this directly contradicted its earlier statements and could
not immediately be confirmed.
Russian tanks, forced to retreat by Chechen fighters after a push on
Saturday into the Chechen capital, pounded the city from new positions.
It was the first time Moscow's troops had been involved in large-scale
street fighting since the Soviet army crushed the Hungarian uprising in
1956.
''According to commanders of the federal armed forces, several dozen
armoured vehicles have been set ablaze since units entered Grozny,''
Tass quoted a Government statement as saying.
''Armoured vehicles are being fired at from the windows of tall
apartment buildings and it is extremely difficult to pin down where the
shooting is coming from,'' said the statement, which repeated Moscow's
line that foreign mercenaries rather than Chechen forces were doing most
of the fighting.
The government later issued a statement saying its forces had taken
''corrective action'' which had helped subdue resistance and kill many
of the defenders.
It also accused Chechen defenders of using chemical weapons against
its troops, saying eight soldiers had been killed when Dudayev's forces
exploded strategically-located stores of ammonia and prussic acid. The
report could not be confirmed.
The government statement quoted unnamed military specialists as saying
that ''given the type of operation, the losses are lower than
expected''.
However, the smouldering Russian tanks, armoured cars, and armoured
personnel carriers littering the city left little doubt that Moscow's
troops had paid a heavy price for grossly underestimating their
opponents.
Reuter television cameraman Farkhad Kerimov counted 17 burnt-out
Russian tanks and armoured personnel carriers by the railway station.
The Russian decision to lead an assault on Grozny with tanks, which
military experts describe as a basic tactical error, is all the more
inexplicable since Defence Minister Pavel Grachev ridiculed the idea
less than a month ago.
Grachev, speaking after Chechens opposed to Dudayev failed to take the
city despite Russian backing, said a tank assault on the city would be
pointless.

Cairo, Monday
EGYPT'S Muslim militants have killed 12 people in the first two days
of 1995, making a bloody start to their third year of conflict with the
Government and casting doubt on official claims that they had been
defeated.
Gunmen shot dead eight policemen and three civilians and wounded four
others. The largest militant group in Egypt, the Gama'a al-Islamiya,
claimed responsibility.
The attacks took place within one hour of each other near the Nile
valley town of Mallawi, 160 miles south of Cairo.
It was one of the bloodiest days since the militants, bent on turning
Egypt into a strict Muslim state, began in 1992 a campaign of terror
against President Hosni Mubarak's Government.
The killings took to 27 the number of people killed in Egypt's
political violence in the past six days alone. All but one was killed in
or near Mallawi.
In all the attacks, gunmen disguised as police stopped buses on the
main road out of Mallawi to search for policemen on their way to work.
In one attack the gunmen ordered passengers off a public bus and shot
dead five policemen by the roadside.
The civilians were killed by stray bullets, security sources said.
In other attacks, gunmen boarded three minibuses and killed three
policemen after examining the identity papers of passengers.
Some of the policemen were hauled off the buses and killed.
The death toll was one of the highest in one day since Egypt's
political violence began early in 1992 between Muslim militants bent on
setting up a strict Islamic state and the government of president Hosni
Mubarak.--Reuter.

EMBARRASSED Labour leader Tony Blair is demanding tighter discipline
from his Shadow Cabinet after education spokesman David Blunkett was
accused of ''making policy on the hoof''. A threat to impose VAT on
independent school fees was instantly revoked.
Mr Blunkett, new to the job of Shadow Education Secretary, had hinted
that Labour is considering VAT or withdrawal of charitable status,
provoking a storm of criticism which shocked Mr Blair and his Shadow
Chancellor Gordon Brown, who has already ruled out the use of VAT.
Yesterday, Mr Blunkett was sternly reprimanded by national executive
member John Evans.
He said: ''I am very concerned and somewhat disturbed at one or two of
my colleagues on the front bench making policy on the hoof -- or even
worse, making it in front of the television cameras and in newspaper
articles.''
Mr Blunkett's colleagues have been appalled at the speed at which the
Tories have branded them as out to punish the middle classes.
Education Secretary Gillian Shephard yesterday accused Labour of
vindictiveness and ridiculing its consideration of withdrawing
charitable status from private schools because of the complex
involvement of other establishments from universities to pre-school
playgroups.

West's wife's case 'flimsier'
THE door to the prison cell of Rosemary West, wife of the suspected
mass killer who was found hanged in his prison cell on New Year's Day,
was being left open last night and someone was sitting outside to watch
over her, it was claimed.
A solicitor for Mrs West, who faced nine joint murder charges with her
husband, said last night that Frederick West confessed to the killings
and told police his wife had nothing to do with them.
There were also claims yesterday that media coverage of Mr West's
death could prejudice any efforts to try his wife.
Mr John Bartell, general secretary of the Prison Officers Association,
said that the governor of Pucklechurch Prison, Bristol, had issued the
instructions concerning the watch over Mrs West to his members at the
jail.
''This is a total breach of all security procedures -- you could have
an officer who may fall asleep. This is another example of the total
idiocy of the prison department,'' he said.
However, a spokesman for the Prison Service said: ''We don't discuss
the custodial arrangements of individual prisoners.''
Mr Bartell said Mrs West should not be kept at Pucklechurch, which he
described as an ordinary women's remand centre with no perimeter
security.
''It is the last place on earth where you should keep a high-risk
woman prisoner.''
He added that there would only be four or five officers on night duty
at Pucklechurch, which holds an average of around 200 inmates at any one
time.
There has been controversy over whether Mr West was under a special
suicide watch when he died at Birmingham's Winson Green Prison. Initial
reports suggested he was being checked every 15 minutes but it was
claimed later that he had not been put under a suicide watch because he
had assimilated well into prison life.
Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw has written to the Home Secretary
Michael Howard urging him to clarify the situation.
Mrs West, 41, had been jointly charged with Frederick West with
murdering nine young women and girls whose remains were recovered by
police at their house and garden at 25 Cromwell Street in Gloucester.
Mr Leo Goatley, who represents Mrs West, claimed the police case
against her was ''even flimsier'' after her husband's death.
''I have always felt the case against her was flimsy and it is
flimsier now,'' he said. ''Because they were jointly charged, everything
that Fred has said would have come out in court and would have
challenged Rose.
''If it had been put to a jury it could have prejudiced her case.
During his police interviews his story started to waver this way and
that, and he blamed one person and then another.
''He started out saying he knew nothing about it, but when he was
confronted with the reality of what was buried at Cromwell Street, he
made a truthful and candid admission and that included a statement that
Rose had nothing to do with it.''
Mr Goatley visited Mrs West yesterday and they discussed her legal
position.
He later told BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight programme that he had
been misquoted as saying Mrs West was not upset or tearful about Mr
West's death..
''When I saw her, she did look shocked but she had been with a prison
visitor and had regained her composure,'' he said.
''Over the months, she has been able to rationalise her relationship.
She regarded him as having a split personality -- he was a rascal with
many failings but she was also aware of a Fred West who was a hard
worker and a breadwinner.
''I think death has exorcised her anger and the hatred she felt.''
The couple were due to appear before a stipendiary magistrate at
committal proceedings on February 6, and were expected to make a formal
appearance at Gloucester Magistrates Court on January 10. It's thought
both court hearings will still go ahead.
''One would hope this will now concentrate the stipendiary
magistrate's mind on whether there is a case against Rosemary for her to
answer in Crown Court,'' said Mr Goatley.
''My guess is that the committal hearing will go ahead, but I cannot
second-guess what the Crown will do in the meantime which might change
things.''
Gloucestershire Chief Constable Tony Butler warned the media not to
prejudice the case against Mrs West in reports of the death.
''She is still charged jointly with her husband on nine counts of
murder, therefore proceedings in the case remain 'active' under the
terms of the Contempt of Court Act 1981. It is self evident that the
evidence against Mr West will be part of the evidence against Mrs
West,'' he said.
Commenting on yesterday's media coverage, Labour's law officer
spokesman, John Morris, said: ''I can see the point of any prejudice
being thought to have been caused in the trial of Mrs West who is also
charged with some of the murders.''
Meanwhile, the director general of the Prison Service, Derek Lewis,
said last night that Mr West was not assessed as being a suicide risk at
the time of his death and was not on a 15-minute watch.
''He had been assessed initially when he came in, as all such
prisoners would be, and had been considered not to be a risk and had
been put on to a normal regime,'' he said.
Mr Lewis added that ''a decision that was taken, as far as we can
tell, in line with the normal procedures by the local staff and the
medical staff at the prison'', with no ministerial involvement.
Earlier in the day, principal officer at Winson Green, Mr Terry
O'Dwyer, said Mr West was checked every 15 minutes in his cell in part
of the hospital wing, and everything possible was done to protect him.
He said, however, that if someone was determined to commit suicide,
they would succeed. ''It's the last thing we want, but you can't stop
anyone from taking their life,'' he said.
Details of Mr West's final hours also began to emerge yesterday. On
Hogmanay he spent the day playing pool and watching television. The
following morning he spent time in the exercise area after breakfast,
and was then locked in his cell with his lunch. Just before 1pm he was
found hanged.

DANGEROUSLY high levels of benzene, a cancer-causing pollutant
implicated in childhood leukemia, have been discovered in parts of Fife.
A study found concentrations 14 times the official safe level in the
air.
A specialist in child health has warned that they pose a severe health
hazard for local communities.
Last April, Government experts set a level of five parts per billion
as an acceptable risk level. The Herald understands that levels as high
as 70ppb were found in some areas by researchers.
The investigation of air pollution was headed by Professor Wilson
Sibbart, a professor of physics at St Andrews University.
He is chairman of the Independent Air Monitoring Committee, set up two
years ago by Fife Regional Council after safety concerns were raised
about the hazards of air pollution, including benzene, from the
Mossmorran/Braefoot Bay petrochemical complex.
The results of the study are now with Fife Regional Council. Professor
Sibbart handed over the confidential document to the council in
mid-December. The sensitive nature of its contents have raised fears
that attempts may be made to play down the findings or the risks to
which local communities have been exposed.
Dr Morrice McCrae, a specialist in child health, first raised the
dangers of benzene emissions with local authorities and the
petrochemical companies two years ago, when he retired to the Fife
village of Aberdour. Dr McCrae had been senior lecturer in child life
and health at Edinburgh University's medical faculty.
He warned then that international medical research had disclosed links
between benzene and child leukemias. His evidence, gleaned from all
available medical literature worldwide, held at the US medical research
centre at Bethesda in Washingon, was dismissed.
The carcinogenic effects of benzene concentrations, widely accepted in
the US and the Netherlands, were not then accepted by UK official
bodies.
However, in April 1994, the Department of the Environment's expert
panel on air quality standard published its report on benzene, which
confirmed the dangers. It stated that the substance was a genotoxic
carcinogen, which damaged the genetic make-up of cells.
The group, chaired by Professor Seaton of Aberdeen University Medical
School, said that, while recognising that leukemia was a relatively rare
group of diseases, it was impossible to determine a benzene
concentration at which there was no risk to people who might be exposed.
It was feasible, however, to recommend a standard which presented an
exceedingly small risk to the population, and it set that risk at 5ppb.
It recommended that this should be reduced to the lower level of 1ppb by
a target date set by Government.
Dr McCrae, a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, yesterday said
the Government report had simply confirmed the dangers that
international medical researchers had identified.
He claims the main source of benzene from the petrochemical complex
comes from the loading technique.
When the tanks on the ship are opened, benzene fumes escape from the
remains of the previous cargo. There is no mechanism for harvesting the
benzene as it rises into the atmosphere.
Last month, the Royal Society in Edinburgh met to discuss leukemia
clusters when the link between benzene and leukemia was raised.
A paper presented to the society in November identified clusters of
childhood leukemias related to petrochemical installations in Merseyside
and Wales. A cluster had been identified at Aalsmeer in the Netherlands
and clusters had been reported last year at a number of sites in
England, as shown in a paper in the journal Community Health.
''The more I have looked into this, the more angry I have become. I
wrote to the planning committee, in 1992, putting forward all the
arguments and evidence about the dangers of benzene.
''The committee were not shown this. I was not allowed to speak at the
meeting. Instead, the officials produced contradictory views from the
health and safety executive and the chief administrative medical
officer.''
Shell is currently planning to expand the petrochemical complex,
including an extra loading bay. It has applied to the local authority
for permission.
Dr McCrae says the oil companies must be forced to reduce benzene
emissions: ''The planning authority must make permission conditional on
the oil companies undertaking to clear up the damage and the hazard to
reduce unnecessary risk.''
The implications for jobs if the council refuse planning permission
for an expansion planned by the petrochemical company have been spelled
out by Shell, who warned that the entire operation was in danger of
closure if permission to expand was not granted.
