AN Old Bailey judge yesterday told members of the jury in the Sauchie
terrorist trial that they would have to consider whether a top Scottish
policeman had taken part in a major conspiracy against one of the
defendants.
Such a conspiracy, she said, would have had to involve several police
forces.
They would have to make a decision whether or not Detective
Superintendent Jim Moffat was a truthful man.
Mrs Justice Ebsworth asked the jury, which will retire this morning to
consider its verdict: ''Was he an officer, to put it bluntly, who was
lying to you?''
Mr Hugh Jack, 37, from Sauchie, Clackmannanshire, and Mr Robert
Fryers, 45, from Belfast, have denied that, between January and July
1993, they conspired together and with others unknown to cause
explosions.
Mr Fryers, the jury was told, was caught with a Semtex blast bomb as
he waited for a bus into Central London.
Counsel for Mr Jack has suggested that an explosives cache containing
Semtex and other bomb-making equipment had been planted in Gartinny
wood, near Sauchie, in an attempt to implicate Mr Jack in the alleged
conspiracy.

THE loss-making slaughterhouse at Castle Douglas could be leased out
to a meat exporter, or used for a meat processing plant -- with the
prospect of up to a dozen jobs.
These are two of the lines being followed up by Stewartry District
Council, who are anxious to increase trade and cut the expected loss of
#100,000 on the council-owned slaughterhouse this year.
Environmental health councillors are hopeful that talks, which are
being held at present with users and potential users of one of the few
remaining slaughterhouses in South-West Scotland, will bring extra
business.
Castle Douglas councillor Douglas Whitelaw, chairman of the
slaughterhouse committee, said they will be advertising the premises in
the coming weeks, but has assured regular users that their interests
will be looked after in the event of the premises in Cotton Street,
Castle Douglas, being leased.
Last month, the council agreed to a series of discussions and meetings
to try and find ways of cutting the losses at the slaughterhouse, which
underwent a modernisation scheme recently costing more than #250,000 to
bring it up to strict new European standards.
Mr Whitelaw said that already he was very hopeful about the future of
the plant, and although there was nothing concrete at present, they had
a very serious enquiry about the prospect of a meat processing plant
with the prospect of 10 or 12 jobs.
Mr Whitelaw said more and more consumers were turning to the
supermarkets for their supplies, and didn't require slaughterhouse
facilities. As a consequence of this, turnover at the slaughterhouse had
dropped.
In addition, wholesale meat suppliers were increasing, and there were
six operating in the area. Leasing to a private individual or company
was one of the options which would allow it to be used for the export of
cattle or sheep, or possibly the setting up of a meat processing plant.
''If we can carry this through, we could turn what has been described
as a liability, although not as big as some, into a profitable
concern.''
* A tightening up of the regulations regarding the identification of
cattle sent to market comes into force from January 30. From that date,
farmers will have to provide auctioneers with a movement document for
each animal.
The new order is the Bovine Animals (Records, Identification and
Movement) Order 1995, which replaces existing legislation on cattle
recording and movements.
From April 1, all new-born cattle will require to be tagged with
new-style ear tags which bear a country code (UK), in addition to the
herd mark, and their own unique identity number.
The new arrangements conform with an EU directive which requires all
member States to introduce systems for uniquely identifying bovine
animals and recording their movements. These requirements are designed
to help in the fight against animal disease, and establish a
Community-wide system for tracing animal movements -- which is essential
both for disease control and for the prevention of fraud on subsidy
payments.
The identity numbers will be issued through a central computer system
run by the Ministry of Agriculture at Guildford. Ear tags bearing these
numbers may only be removed on the authority of a veterinary inspector.

BACK in the early eighties I can remember seeing the Nine Night by
Jamaican Edgar White in what was not much more than an extended garage
in West London. In Nine Night White explored the disillusionment felt by
so many Caribbean immigrants lured to the ''mother country'' in the
misguided belief that Britain would welcome them with open arms.
Well, it's not exactly turned out like that and Winsome Pinnock's
Leave Taking (part of The National's education programme and about to
set out on a UK tour) charts, like so many plays in the past 12 years,
the painful long-term consequences of immigration -- the uprooting not
just in physical but emotional terms. What makes Leave Taking unusual --
and even more so when it was written originally in 1987 for the
Liverpool Playhouse -- is the fact that it was written from a woman's
perspective.
Pinnock's Jamaican-born heroine, Enid, is the kind of woman you can
still see any day of the week standing in the rain at the bus stop --
impassive, enduring, a mother who has struggled to bring up her two
daughters in a good, God-fearing English tradition, but who finds
herself isolated from them by a chasm she can barely comprehend. Racial
identity and racism is certainly at the root of it but what Leave Taking
so skilfully and with such devastating poignancy depicts is the
generational divide between mothers and daughters and the deeply
corrosive nature of rejection.
Leave Taking is not perfect; it was one of Pinnock's earliest plays
and shows it. But Enid's inner journey is chartered with such
extraordinary sensitivity and perception and in Jenni George gets a
performance of such gut-wrenching truth, you can't help but leave the
theatre a sadder and wiser person for knowing her.

<HEADLINE>Malting barley an attractive option for cereal growers</HEADLINE>

GREATLY improved world demand will make malting barley a highly
attractive option for the UK cereal grower this year, says Robin Pirie
of the Institute of Brewing. He is encouraging farmers to think
seriously about malting barley this spring.
''Demand from many major beer consuming countries around the world has
turned the corner, and new markets are also emerging in Asia and the Far
East,'' he told guests at the Institute's annual prizegiving lunch in
London for the national malting barley competition.
The disastrous drought in Australia had also helped to create a very
strong demand for the available supplies of both barley and malt.
Mr Pirie said that most UK maltsters were now well sold for delivery
throughout 1995, and enquiries were still coming in. ''Production units
are working to full capacity, and stock levels are at an all-time low.
This is excellent news for everyone in the supply chain -- farmer,
merchant, and maltster.''
This upbeat view was shared by grain merchant Michael Banks, chairman
of the competition's judging panel. He recalled that European barley
production in 1984 had been 55.2m tonnes, and by 1994 it was only 38.8m
tonnes. In the UK, production had shrunk from 10.8m tonnes to 5.7m
tonnes over that same period.
''For growers with land still available for spring drilling, malting
barley looks like producing the best gross margin,'' he said. ''Anyone
still planning to drill rapeseed should remember that it has a sting in
the tail -- cumulative penalties for exceeding the quota, and other
factors, could result in area payments being reduced by #100 per
hectare, or more.
''Maybe set-aside has achieved what was intended -- that the market
should pay a realistic price to encourage the producer to grow the crop
that is needed, while the market for crops not in demand will continue
to fall to world market levels.''
Champions in the Scottish section of the competiton were J S Dunn and
Partners, Catcune, Gorebridge, Midlothian, with a sample of Camargue
spring barley entered by I M Cowe and Co Ltd of Edinburgh.
* BRITAIN'S horticultural producers were accused by a leading academic
yesterday of not being sufficiently green for today's market demands.
They were urged to take a leaf out of the farmers' book.
That leaf was the Linking Environment and Farming (LEAF) scheme, set
up to address environmental issues and to promote integrated crop
management systems.
In the annual memorial lecture at the British Growers Look Ahead
Conference and Exhibition, Professor Michael Alder, Principal of Rittle
College in Essex, said there was a strong case for a similar
organisation for horticulture.
This would look at issues such as water management, integrated pest or
crop management, soil nutrition through slow release fertilisers, and
compost recycling.
''Sustainability of production systems, and concern for the
environment, will be at the heart of any future botany business,'' said
Professor Alder.
Tomorrow's growers would also have to think about buyer technology,
new crops, and increasingly about the computerisation and robotics to
help them in their businesses. The concept of botany business could give
rise to a whole new range of crops for fibres, construction materials,
pharmaceuticals, specialist chemicals, and designer oils and starches.
Professor Alder called for the establishment of a centre of excellence
for alternative crops, based at an independent institution, and partly
funded by the Ministry of Agriculture and the Biotechnology and
Biological Sciences Research Council.
''Such a centre would provide a database of information, a base for
agronomic research, a demonstration of possible alternatives, a forum
for interested parties, and a base for the dissemination of
information.''

A youthful Scots electronics company has two highly promising products
to offer -- along, says Bill Magee, with the confidence to call the tune
when it comes to funding and technical support.
IT is not every day that an embryonic Scots electronics firm, let
alone any company new or established, calls the tune by enlisting the
expertise of several hi-tech bodies in the US to help create two linked
products it is about to launch into the global marketplace.
This is just one of the more refreshing facts revealed at a
prospective investors' meeting held in Glasgow's Central Hotel, with the
event representing D-day for Brian Duffy, David Simpson and John Brown
as their new company, Dakon Electronics, takes off.
The funding get-together also revealed how public and private sectors
can combine effectively to launch a truly innovative product. In the
case of Dakon this involved the completion of a 24-month slog by the
trio of directors to nurture the two products and protect them by one
worldwide patent.
Furthermore, the meeting provided a rare insight into the mechanics of
how capital is drawn together to enable a business start-up to get
beyond the drawing board prototype stage to become a potential market
leader, while also creating 50 jobs eventually for Easterhouse where the
firm is housed in the area's Queenslie Business Park.
During the past two years Brian Duffy has developed the Child Alarm
and The Tracker which are now ready to be marketed both at home and
overseas.
THE firm is about to expand its patents worldwide to safeguard Dakon's
work, which is at the leading edge of technology. So advanced is the
work, as David Simpson put it: ''It's usually the States who dictate but
not on this occasion.
''The US, along with Germany and some big home-grown retailers, are
interested in marketing our products.'' It was during the development
stage that US hi-tech companies provided engineering and technical
support, but always at Dakon's diktat.
Neil Craig, a Glasgow-based partner with BDO Stoy Hayward, is pulling
together the financial package. He said: ''I have had the easiest part,
compared with the long hours put in by others.''
As Dakon has developed, it has never lost sight of the constant need
to stay alive to the financial needs beyond the sound equity base
provided by the directors and a small shareholders' group led by David
Campbell, chairman of West Independent Newspapers, vice-chairman of
Enterprise Ayrshire, and now chairman of Dakon.
In the case of Dakon, a successful mix of financial expertise is
evident. The Bank of Scotland is providing a combination of loan and
overdraft facilities, and Greater Easterhouse Development Company is
backing up on funding and accommodation.
AN application to Glasgow Regeneration Fund has gone through, and to
finish off the investment side the Scottish Office Industry Department
is supporting the company through an innovation grant. For the vital
second phase finally, working capital is being provided by Alex Lawrie,
the finance and credit management factors.
David Simpson said of the investors' meeting: ''It represented the
official and effective day one start-up of Dakon Electronics. From this
point on we have the resources to achieve the goals we have outlined in
our business plan.''
Said new chairman David Campbell: ''We have three bright and dedicated
young men here who have spent an enormous amount of time bringing this
project to fruition, involving a product which is simple yet innovative
and will be used initially in the child safety market.''
He added that an equal attraction was the chance to help in a Scottish
start-up: ''All of us in business have to do what we can to increase the
number of new businesses.''
A STRONG believer in the one-door approach, together with a single
appraisal for access to public funding of up to #150,000, he added: ''I
know all the difficulties involved but if the Government is serious
about the importance of helping start-ups, then it must face up to the
problem.''
Returning to Dakon he said: ''I am joining the board to give the guys
the benefit of some of the grey hairs, but more than anything I believe
this company has an above-average chance of success.''
Recent market overview for Dakon stresses recent publicity and parent
concern over children's safety. Brian Duffy said the Child Alarm is
therefore designed to alert an adult that the child has wandered away
from his or her side.
''The child will wear a small radio transmitter and the parent will
have a compact receiver unit. If the transmitter moves outwith a pre-set
distance, an alarm on the receiver will alert the adult.''
The parent can then switch the receiver over to tracking mode and when
this is engaged the receiver unit starts to emit a beep every several
seconds. Point the unit in the direction of the transmitter -- the child
-- and the beeping intensifies.
BRIAN Duffy said extra consideration was given in the product design
to ensure it could be easily used by the target market, and also to
differentiate it from any competition.
''The child unit is of small wristwatch size, secure and easily
worn.'' Furthermore, the on/off switch is located in such a way as to
make tampering difficult, and circuitry is designed to minimise a false
alarm.
With a battery life in excess of 250 hours, together with a direction
indicator with up to a 200-metre range, the patented product appears to
have everything well thought out.
The Tracker constitutes a development of the sister product, Brian
added. ''Essentially it is an enhanced version, with a longer tracking
range and an LED display to indicate a child's direction.''
DAKON is firmly market-led and a great deal of initial research into
product potential has been carried out. John Brown said a total target
sales market of 7.5 million in Britain and 45 million throughout the EU
had been confidently identified. A number of established UK retailers
with a total of 3000 outlets have expressed interest in stocking the
Dakon products.
The Glasgow investors' meeting was therefore aimed at taking the Dakon
creativeness firmly into the marketplace, through raising enough money
to complete the investment stage and then initiating a process of
high-volume manufacture.

Stores group shocks market with poor trading figures and gloomy
statement.
KINGFISHER has often been at the forefront of spotting new trends in
retailing but recently when it comes to implementing its strategy there
have been problems.
Yesterday's disappointing trading statement had City analysts rushing
to cut their annual profit forecasts which now centre around #280m
compared with as much as #330m previously.
The Kingfisher board said that the performance of Comet and Woolworths
meant that the results for the year will be ''unsatisfactory''.
In the 23-week period to January 7, 1995, sales grew by 4.1% in its
retail businesses which include B&amp;Q, Woolworths and Comet. However, this
growth masked continuing difficulties at Woolworths and new problems at
Comet.
Kingfisher is reviewing both the Woolworths and Comet businesses but
corporate affairs director Nigel Whittaker said there were no plans to
dispose of any core businesses. A provision may be made to cover stock,
building and fixture write-offs in the full-year accounts.
Electrical retailing is highly competitive in the UK given the entry
of the privatised regional electrical companies into the market and
over-expansion in out-of-town retail parks. Consumer demand is closely
linked to fads and this year personal computers and mobile telephones
were in vogue. However, Comet, Kingfisher's electrical chain, did not
have sufficient in store to meet demand and so its like-for-like sales
slumped by 10.6%.
On the positive side, Darty, its market leading French electricals
chain continued to make good progress. Its margins were steady and
underlying sales grew by 3.4%, the largest gain of any of the businesses
in Kingfisher's portfolio.
Last year Woolworths had a poor Christmas as a result of over-ordering
computer games and toys. A new computer system has solved that
particular problem but it was replaced by distribution problems which
led to higher warehouse costs as extra temporary space was taken on to
cope with Christmas stock.
Initiatives are being taken to extend the age and product range of the
Ladybird childrenswear brand and new products and services are being
introduced to the stores such as CD Rom for computers and video rental.
However, these products are available in other retailers and it will be
sometime before these developments feed through to Kingfisher's bottom
line. Woolworths' sales growth in the period under review dipped
slightly to 1.8% on an underlying basis.
Within B&amp;Q, the UK's largest DIY chain, underlying sales grew by 1.8%
although the sales growth has accelerated to 7.3% since November. The
company operates an everyday low prices policy in its B&amp;Q chain which
relies on large volumes to generate profits.
The sluggish state of the housing market is continuing to depress
overall demand in the industry and margins. However, B&amp;Q is managing to
grow its sales through offering low prices and an extensive product
range. This is particularly the case for its larger warehouse stores
which are likely to be rolled out at a quicker pace in the months ahead.
There are currently 14 B&amp;Q warehouses and it plans to open up to 50.
Kingfisher is confident that these stores will be more than a match for
any increased Sainsbury's Homebase presence as a result of it taking
over the No 2 in the DIY market, Texas Homecare. Mr Whittaker believes
that it is good news for the industry that one player is being removed.
Superdrug's strategy of shifting its product mix towards a core range
of personal care products is starting to show some rewards. Sales
recovered from a poor first half and rose by 1.6%. A good increase in
its profitability is expected by the year-end.
The problem for Kingfisher is how to extract a better performance from
all its businesses because by and large it is overshadowed by more
efficient UK operators in almost all its markets. One thinks of B&amp;Q
compared with the smaller Homebase, Superdrug with Boots and Comet with
Dixons.
Up until recently City analysts were prepared to ignore their concerns
about the maturity of Kingfisher's business portfolio in the face of
increased profits.
However, the combination of Kingfisher's operational problems, weak
short-term earnings growth and competitive threats in its major markets
suggests that the shares will continue to be one of the worst performing
among the major retailers. Yesterday in active trading Kingfisher shares
dropped 19p to 402p.

FULLY recovered from heart surgery, Stanley Leisure chairman Leonard
Steinberg was smiling benignly on the world yesterday.
Certainly he had plenty about to be cheerful about, with Britain's
fourth-largest betting shop chain not only increasing half-time pre-tax
profits by 42% to #7.64m but also the prospect of much more business
over the years ahead.
He believes the National Lottery will be beneficial to the gambling
industry in the long run, observing that two-thirds of the punters in
the lottery are women, who currently account for perhaps as little as 6%
of betting shop clients. As shop facilities and ambience improve it
seems inevitable that proportion will increase.
There are also opportunities for increasing business through the
probable introduction of amusement-with-prizes machines in betting shops
later this year. Margins on these are somewhat better than on
horseracing, for which there are 11 Sunday meetings scheduled over the
summer.
Stanley is in the enviable position of being in practice the only
bookmaking chain able to make reasonably-sized acquisitions -- Ladbroke,
William Hill and Coral are effectively blocked because of their existing
market shares.
It is also backed by a strong balance sheet after last year's #21m
rights issue.
The #6m acquisition of the Selwyn Demmy chain contributed #700,000 of
profit during the half-year, the purchase and recent openings expanding
the Stanley chain to 424 branches. The average betting slip has
increased from #3.66 to #3.80 although it is just over #4 in Scotland.
The 19 casino operations, including two in Edinburgh, have benefited
from a 5% rise in the drop or average amount spent at #92. Unlike
Stakis, Stanley will not introduce membership fees for new members.
Altogether some #6.7m is being invested this year including almost #2m
on information systems.
Full-year profits seem likely to increase from #12.4m to about #17m.
This would leave the shares, up 8p to a new peak of 355p, trading at a
forward-looking 17 times likely earnings. However, the premium is well
justified and the stock remains the most surefooted in the leisure
sector.
The interim dividend has been increased 17% to 2p with a 6.2p total
possible for a 2.2% yield.

BLUE Peter would have been proud of them. The one they made earlier
was cobbled together with the help of oil drums and other scrapyard bits
and pieces.
Now, however, sculptors Brian Caster and his wife Kerry Hammond -- the
forces behind Scotland's only fine arts foundry -- have at their
disposal a new kiln that will help them compete against their English
rivals as well as boost their profitability.
It was acquired with the help of financial support from, among others,
Lothian Region Development Authority's Business Support Scheme and the
Capital Enterprise Trust.
The larger capacity now available to the couple, who established
Powderhall Bronze in Edinburgh in 1989, will have a dramatic effect.
No longer, as in the case of the 10ft by 8ft dragon sculpture recently
sited in Dundee city centre, will they have to cast works in a number of
small pieces and weld them together.
The new arrival looks set to be in frequent use. ''We have so many
quotes that if 60% of them came in at once we would need to increase the
staff,'' said Mr Caster, who comes from Middlesborough.
However, the business has not always been so successful. Three years
ago the couple were laying off staff.
They met in London where they studied at the Royal College of Art.
Like his Hertfordshire-born wife, Mr Caster, a graduate of Edinburgh
College of Art, trained under the world-renowned sculptor Palozzi.
When they decided to set up a business they headed to Scotland where
they perceived a gap in the market.
With #3000 earned from work at a Paris foundry, they rented an old
bakery close to Edinburgh's Powderhall dog track. There was no cash left
so hand-built equipment, modified when necessary, was put to use.
Through contacts some work evolved, and by the end of their first year
they were employing one person. By the end of the second the payroll had
risen by another two.
But after a move to new premises in Leith, forced on them by lease
problems, the recession struck and redundancies were needed. They were
left with one trainee. Rather than sit idle they designed items such as
tabletop sculptures and pedestal tables, which they tried to market
through trade shows south of the Border.
The reaction was encouraging but orders were few. The couple did,
however, get some design consultancy work.
In the summer of 1992 things picked up. They received a #25,000
commission from Scottish Nuclear at East Kilbride which led to more
staff being hired. Later commissions included Glasgow's Lobey Dosser
sculpture and work for the Royal Concert Hall and Edinburgh's Gallery of
Modern Art.
They recently completed a life-size figure of a piper in full military
dress and a little girl offering him a rose for a memorial event in
Holland. It honours the soldiers of the 51st Highland Division killed in
the Second World War.
Work in the pipeline includes casting 28 figures in aluminium to go
around a castle in Southern Ireland.
Some time ago the couple sought financial support for their operation.
The Scottish Arts Council rejected them on the grounds that they were
''not fine arts enough'', while the old SDA turned them down because
they were ''too fine art''.
Their approach to the region's Business Support Scheme got a different
reaction. Officials visited them and backed their view that they needed
new equipment to produce larger sculptures more quickly, allowing them
to compete against their English rivals.
''We always thought,'' said Mr Caster, ''that if we could get someone
to come and see the uniqueness of what we were doing they might perhaps
treat us as a special case. I think that is what happened.''

EDINBURGH-based Christian Salvesen is pushing further into
international distribution with the acquisition of 40% of the Wohlfarth
Group, a leading supplier of logistic services in Germany.
The vendor is the Lep Group which will receive an initial DM5m or
about #2m. It is hoping to take full control in about a year, although
the option on that decision extends until 2001. Depending on Wohlfarth's
performance, there could be additional payments of between #4.9m and
#25m.
Salvesen's chief executive Dr Chris Masters said he would be delighted
to pay the higher sum as it would mean Wohlfarth had performed well.
The initial investment is through a holding company Wohlfarth Swift,
where the managers and senior employers have a 20% stake and the
Candover venture capital group 40%.
Swift itself was acquired from a former Lep management buy-out team in
October 1993 for #83m, and John Brotherton, the Swift managing director,
recruited Wohlfarth management when he was at Lep. That should
immediately resolve any of the management problems frequently inherent
in acquisitions.
Last year, Wohlfarth made pre-tax profits of #1.7m from turnover of
#85.6m.
One major advantage of the deal is that Salvesen will be able to
introduce common systems for its major European customers, with
Wohlfarth bringing in additional business from Mercedes, Shell, BASF and
Du Pont.
Salvesen eased 2p to 287p on turnover of two million shares.

THERE are signs of a recovery in consumer demand for leisure
activities after a period of weakness during the recession. This is good
news for First Leisure who have seen this upturn in confidence manifest
itself in higher attendance at its discos and increased spending.
The hot summer weather last year also boosted turnover at its resorts
business which includes Blackpool Illuminations.
Turnover grew by 16.4% last year to #141.8m and annual profits
continued their unbroken growth record, jumping 22% to #37.5m before
tax. Excluding contributions from asset disposals profits growth was
still almost 18%.
Earnings per share increased by 18.2% and 16.6p and the dividend for
the year was raised by 7.5% to 7.02p.
Chief executive John Conlon said the results were ''very positive''
against a background of only a modest improvement in consumer
confidence. Many of the group's businesses increased their market share
which Mr Conlon said reflected the quality and strength of the business.
In the resorts division, sales were boosted by the Blackpool centenary
celebrations. Profits grew by 17% to #13m. The addition of new
multi-activity family entertainment and a swimming pool complex are
expected to further boost the division's performance in the current
year.
The business is thought to possess further growth potential given its
resilience to economic cycles and ability to generate cash.
The group's dancing division is the biggest profit contributor at
#17.3m, an increase of 23%. It is the market leader with total
admissions in the year close to seven million.
The relatively new addition of health and fitness clubs made a useful
contribution to the sports division. However, this was offset by
marketing problems in the ten-pin bowling clubs and profits dropped by
18% to #11.2m. Since the year-end bowling sales are up and further sites
have been earmarked for health clubs.
Its bingo clubs' acquisition performed ahead of expectations and the
company is keen to build its presence in this market from its small
base. New licences have been granted in 11 locations and others are in
the pipeline.
The company is seeking to increase its presence in Glasgow and
Edinburgh in pubs, health clubs and bingo. Mr Conlon is confident that
the company will continue to outperform in the medium and long term
given its broad spread of complementary leisure interests.
Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel Four, is taking over the
chairmanship of the company from Lord Rayne who is retiring at the
annual general meeting.

THE Stock Exchange has decided to take no action over Swiss Bank's
share-dealing activity in regional electricity companies.
Swiss Bank has come in for stinging criticism in some quarters for
building up a stake in Northern Electricity which is subject to a hotly
contested #1200m bid from Trafalgar House.
The bank has also taken an 8% stake in Yorkshire Electricity which it
claimed was part of its normal market-making activities.
The Stock Exchange said yesterday that it has investigated
transactions by Swiss Bank Corporation in relation to the recently
announced bid by Trafalgar House for Northern Electric.
The investigation included transactions undertaken by Swiss Bank
Corporation in other regional electricity company securities, it said.
On the basis of information available to date, the exchange ''is
satisfied that there are no reasonable grounds for action within its own
area of regulatory responsibility in respect of any of the
above-mentioned dealings''.
The exchange said it intended to consult member firms and other
parties on whether further rules were needed concerning the impact of
the use of derivatives or derivative-related products on the London
equity markets.
''In particular, it will be examining whether additional disclosures
need to be made in the public interest.''

PHOTO-ME International, the world's leading photobooth-maker and
operator, suffered a surprise half-year profits fall, the group revealed
yesterday.
However, managing director David Miller said the company should enjoy
higher profits during the second half. ''The company is aware of the
competition in the marketplace and will ensure that all aspects of the
business continue to be constantly reviewed.''
In the half-year to the end of October, taxable profits fell 4.1% to
#10m from #10.4m in the corresponding period a year earlier. Turnover
during six months climbed 6% to #96.3m but the group suffered a squeeze
on profit margins. The interim dividend is unchanged at 1.5p. Earnings
per share firmed to 8.62p as against 8.4p.

HOUSE sales in Scotland are ''terribly erratic'' at present, according
to London &amp; Clydeside managing director John McIntyre.
The only quoted pure Scottish housebuilder said yesterday that house
reservation rates are generally showing little improvement over the same
period last year.
This is due to limited public confidence in the housing market, which
will not be helped by the announcement expected this morning from the
Halifax about its increasing mortgage rates.
However, it is not all gloom -- the results for last year were a touch
above expectations as pre-tax profits jumped 90% to #1.41m.
House sales rose 19% to 282 units -- this is the first time L&amp;C has
ever disclosed the exact size of its bulk -- with turnover up overall by
20% to #25.5m, including just over #2m from the jointly owned plumbing
subsidiary.
Average house prices fell #2000 to #80,000 due to the change in mix
and, in particular, fewer being sold in Aberdeen.
The company spent little on buying new land, although it is in the
process of acquiring three sites at a cost of just over #2m, adding
about 180 plots to the existing 1000 or so.
Mr McIntyre has been put off by some of the fancy land prices being
paid in Scotland at present. One can see what he means with more than
#200,000 an acre seen in Aberdeen, as much as #250,000 in Edinburgh and
around #150,000 for land for 700 houses in Glasgow. In some cases, it is
hard to imagine how this can be economic.
The company has also encountered planning difficulties which have
constrained the number of houses it can build. This has led debt to fall
faster than expected with interest charges almost halving to #467,000.
Gearing is 53%.
One disappointment has been the difficulty in letting the Bath Street
development in Glasgow, jointly owned with Murray Johnstone. There has
been another #383,000 writedown including interest on the #3m share of
the participation.
The company will seek a full Stock Exchange listing next month and is
dropping Warburg to leave Allied Provincial Parsons Penny as sole broker
-- the parting was entirely amicable.
The dividend total has been raised 10% to 5.3p with a 3.5p final.
With the shares 2p better at 124p, compared with net assets of 131p,
the yield is 5.3%.
Current year profits should improve to perhaps #1.7m, although that is
dependent on house sales over the next three months.

* LAURENCE McGarry has been involved in the economic life of Scotland
for many years so it is not surprising that his latest venture,
Intertrade, is aimed at promoting exports.
Laurence was chairman of Strathclyde Regional Council's Economic and
Industrial Development Committee for eight years until 1990.
For most of that time he was (and still is) the non-executive chairman
of Scottish Innovations, and for a time he was a member of Malcolm
Rifkind's Economic Advisory Council when Rifkind was Scottish Secretary.
He formed Intertrade last September and since then has been involved
in laying the groundwork for a number of trade deals.
At this moment he is looking for a company in Scotland who could
supply 5000 tonnes of waste paper every month to a company in Slovenia.
He is also making arrangements for butter to be exported from the
United States to the Baltic, where it will then be sold to Russian
concerns.
Why not Scottish butter? you may ask. The answer, he says, is that he
could not find a Scottish producer able to supply the amounts required.
''There seems to be a world shortage of butter,'' he says. ''I
approached several large Scottish producers but their production was
totally committed.''
Intertrade is also involved in the export of Bulgarian wine to Estonia
but nearer home the Glasgow-based company is involved in exporting
Scotch whisky to Latvia.
Laurence McGarry also sees a future of links between Scottish
manufacturing companies and their counterparts abroad.
He is at present in negotiations with a Scottish company to design and
build a construction block-building machine in a joint venture with a
Latvian company.
He is also looking for a Scottish company to co-operate with a
Malaysian company which would send wooden furniture parts for assembly,
packaging, and marketing in Scotland.
Not content with promoting Scottish trade, Laurence is off to Poland
next week to advise Polish companies on how to export.

New opportunities might be presenting themselves but simply extending
one's overdraft is no longer good enough as Gill Black, KPMG's Senior
Manager, Owner Managed Businesses, explains.
BEFORE we all relax a little as business confidence shows signs of
picking up, this is the very time that adequate finance should be in
place to take advantage of new opportunities. Yet smaller companies too
often embark on growth using little more than their existing overdraft
facility for finance -- and then pay the price.
Late last year Ian Lang launched the Government's new loan scheme
which caps interest rates for up to seven years for smaller businesses.
It is one route to moving away from the overdraft to more predictable
medium-term finance.
Proper financial planning, however, is the key to taking full
advantage of any new opportunity whether it is making an acquisition,
launching a new product, or expanding geographically.
Overdrafts have their place but they are only one source of finance
open to business. They should be used to provide working capital, not
everything else as well.
So where are all these other sources of finance?
Well, first, there is the business itself. Is it really ''lean and
mean''? Are there any under-utilised or surplus assets which could
generate funds? More efficient working might make under-utilised
capacity available to you.
If credit control is not up to the mark, if arrangements to pay
suppliers are not beneficial, if high stocks are tying up cash for
months, if overheads, productivity and profit margins are not properly
monitored, then your existing core business is running inefficiently.
If so, you will have to find more money for your expansion outside of
the business than you need to.
A further option to consider is cash-flow finance, perhaps using a
confidential invoice-discounting basis where customers do not know the
debts are being factored. A growing business can have cash advanced
against a sale very shortly after it has been dispatched.
The next step is to assess the proposed expansion accurately, its true
cost, and potential returns. In short, the expansion must be thoroughly
planned.
First of all, is it really necessary? Is there a demand that has been
quantified, and are the projections really achievable? The case must be
supported by market research and assessment that is critical and not
merely used to justify what management wants.
Owners and managers have to stand back from the detail to set
objectives and assess achievements, evaluate the trading environment,
competition and other economic factors.
Help is sometimes available for market research or preparing a
business plan, though not always in cash form. The Company Growth
Programme, for instance, might provide a non-executive adviser.
Providers of finance will not, in any case, take you seriously without
a business plan, from which they will want to learn a number of things.
Key among them are: the plan's ''ownership'' -- who is taking
responsibility for it; the quality and commitment of the management
team; and the quality of the business operation, its products and
workforce.
You will of course have to prepare financial projections which should
be ''robust'' rather than ''hopeful'', taking account of all capital
expenditure requirements and any increase in working capital needs as
well as future profits.
On this groundwork you can start to construct a financial package.
Designing the unique package that is right for your individual business
is, though based squarely on figures, more of an art than a science.
This is where your business adviser comes in.
The purpose of the finance will affect the nature of the package.
Assets should be matched with the funds that finance them. Long-term
assets, such as land and buildings for example, should be financed from
long-term funds such as equity, term loans or lease finance, whereas
working capital requirements of stock and debtors can be funded through
conventional bank overdraft.
The major national grant assistance is through Regional Selective
Assistance and Regional Enterprise Grants. More localised schemes are
run through local enterprise companies and local authorities. You will
need advice to negotiate the maze surrounding grants and soft loans.
Grants are important not only in themselves but as a lever to unlock
further loan finance without pushing the level of gearing too high.
Unsecured or soft loans can also plug a gap in the package and,
depending on your location, may be available from British Steel
(Industry) and British Coal Enterprise as well as local authorities.
The Government's new Small Business Loan Scheme, launched last
November, makes loans of between #20,000 and #500,000 available to
Scottish firms in certain sectors with fewer than 250 employees. It
guarantees that interest rates will not rise more than 1% above the
initial rate. The cost of capping the rate is met by Scottish
Enterprise.
Venture capital finance is especially appropriate for entrepreneurial
businesses but it raises the prickly subject of whether you are willing
to share control. Scottish companies in particular seem reluctant to
part with equity in return for finance.
Local enterprise companies are now more often looking at small equity
investments and Scottish Development Finance, the venture capital arm of
Scottish Enterprise, picks up on larger projects which meet this
investment criteria.
More informal equity investment by ''business angels'', which tackles
the shortage of smaller amounts of equity funding, is being promoted by
Scottish Enterprise and facilitated by organisations such as LINC.
Proper planning is intended to ensure the business finds the financial
package which suits it rather than having one imposed on it -- otherwise
that seemingly golden opportunity could become quickly tarnished.

The Chinese province of Guangdong presents breathtaking opportunities
for British companies -- and, reports Helen Lennox, Strathclyde has its
foot firmly in the door.
THE headlines in the China Daily signify China's courtship of the
outside world and its attraction to every country from Europe to North
America, drawn by its massive consumer and industrial market potential.
The daily paper of any country is a good indicator of its economic
policy and its condition. According to the China Daily, the
English-speaking paper based in Bejing, it is booming in a way unheard
of in the West for many years.
On one day alone it reported that the Swedish food giant Tetra Laval
Group was planning to invest $100m in China in the next two years and
that General Motors Electronics GMHE of the United States was on the
lookout for Chinese partners for co-operation in automotive electronics,
air traffic control, and telecommunications.
On the same page Price Waterhouse revealed that the number of British
companies investing in China could almost double in the next two years.
It may be news to the China Daily, but to Far East trade expert Jim
Martin China has been one of the world's most important economic regions
for trade for several years.
In the same week as President Jiang Zemin was meeting Bill Clinton and
touring touring South-east Asia as well as attending the second session
of Apec (Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation), 12 Scottish companies were
making their own impact on one of the most important economic regions of
China.
THE companies were part of a trade mission to Guangdong organised by
Strathclyde Business Development, the economic arm of the Regional
Council, and led by Jim Martin. Guangdong is the region closest to Hong
Kong which is linked by a superhighway to the capital Guangzhou, and
because of the dynamic expansion of the region the Western district of
Guangdong may be linked by a spectacular bridge across the Pearl River
in the future.
Jim, principal international trade adviser for SBD, has spent the past
14 years building up contacts in the Far East and establishing an
important relationship between Strathclyde and Guangdong, a region that
is home to 65 million people with an economic growth potential which is
mind blowing.
The SBD mission, which involved companies from a variety of sectors
including engineering, electronics, packaging and transport, was
accompanied by an official party led by Scottish ''ambassador''
Strathclyde Regional Council Convener Bill Perry and Councillor Joe
McLean, chair of the re
gion's economic and industrial development committee.
The top-level political delegation from the region gave the
businessmen and women access to the highest levels within the government
of Guangdong Province and the movers and shakers in the Chinese business
world.
This was evident at the group's arrival at Guangdong Airport after a
30-minute flight from Hong Kong. Guangzhou, city of six million people,
was the trade mission's first port of call.
A SENIOR official met the party at the airport and a police escort
took them to their hotel for the start of four days of official banquets
and meetings, including one with Guangdong's governor.
This was the SBD's third mission into Guangdong. And, said Jim Martin,
''The Governor of Guangdong, Mr Zhu Senlin, does not normally meet trade
delegations. But during the past few years we have worked closely with
officials in China to build up a relationship.
''When we first went into Guangdong Province the number of trade
missions from around the world could be numbered on one hand.
''Today up to 15 trade missions from around the world arrive each day.
The competition is fierce but Strathclyde has established its place with
the Chinese and companies are well placed to meet the right contacts.
''There are a wealth of opportunities in all sectors. We help the
companies organise flights, hotels, and make the contacts. It is then up
to the companies to get past the introductions and establish a
relationship that could lead to business.
''Throughout the Far East, business is developed through personal
relationships and this point is made again and again during all our
meetings between companies and potential business partners in China. All
the companies realise that doing business in China is not a short-term
commitment.''
SBD has worked closely with business consultants Fleishman Hillard
Scotchbrook Asia Inc who represent SBD in Hong Kong and China. They help
to lay the groundwork for visiting Scottish companies in Guangdong --
the ''fifth dragon'' of Asia. The four other dragons of Asia are Hong
Kong, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan.
Companies are given strong advice before they embark on developing
links with a culture which has been closed to the outside world for many
years.
Euan Shand, managing director of The Bennachie Scotch Whisky
Association Ltd, has been in China three times this year. In the hunt
for new export markets he has picked up a few tips for businessmen keen
to keep ''face'' in the land of the tiger.
Euan explained: ''Any businessman or woman needs a lot of patience in
China on two fronts: patience to develop a relationship which could
eventually lead to a deal, but also patience to deal with the levels of
bureaucracy in China.
''You also need a strong stomach because you can't refuse food at
banquets and some of the dishes are not exactly what we are used to at
home.''
In Guangzhou the shock of being in a city of six million people takes
your breath away. There seem to be six million bicycles yet the car is
making inroads.
Guangzhou is being rebuilt: High-rise is everywhere, some of it award
winning, some breathtakingly ugly.
It is a country of paradoxes. Ten years ago produce from China was
criticised for being poor-quality. Today it has quality controllers from
Hong Kong and the quality is good enough to go anywhere in the world.
We visited a clothing factory in Nanhai, outside Guangzhou, run by a
woman and employing more than 2000 people. It is producing 300,000 suits
for the Hong Kong and world markets every year. It also makes the cloth
for the suits. The finished articles we were shown already had labels
for Italy attached to them.
Guangzhou has a major pollution problem, with a mist hanging over the
city and its bustling river 24 hours a day. Driving through the city
some of the reasons for the pollution become evident.
The growth of coal-fired power stations is one of the reasons. The
Sulphuric Acid Factory is situated bang in the middle of a housing
complex, near the river. Officials say it was built there long before
the houses were built, and that this would not happen today.
On the motorway journey from Guangzhou to Nanhai City and on to the
coastal new city of Zhuhai, it seems no part of the surrounding
countryside is not being developed.
Officials in Nanhai are keen to be included in any inward trade
mission to Strathclyde and took the visiting delegation to visit one of
their most productive factories -- the Nanhai Flying Household
Electrical Equipment Enterprise Group Co.
Their willingness to co-operate and work with other countries gives
you the distinct feeling that once they have adapted the best of our
business techniques and technology, within 10 or 20 years they will be
doing it better themselves.
THE workers at the Nanhai Flying Household company are producing
ceiling fans, white goods, and bicycles. The Chinese are getting on
their bikes for business.
A Government spokesman in Guangdong referred during the mission to the
friendly relationship established between Strathclyde and Guangdong.
Godfrey Scotchbrook, managing partner of Fleishman-Hillard Scotchbrook
Asia Inc, said: ''Strathclyde has a unique bond with Guangdong. The
Chinese now recognise the name Strathclyde whenever a company introduces
itself.''
In 1993 the Guangdong region had investment from overseas totalling
$9.6bn. This year it is expected to reach $12bn.
Bill Thomson, group managing director of Clyde Blowers Plc in
Clydebank, was on his sixth foray into China. This time he picked up an
expression which can be useful for businessmen going to China -- man,
man lai. It means go slowly, cautiously, taking one step at a time.
Clyde Blowers has been designing and manufacturing sootblowers since
1924 and has operated in the most demanding installations worldwide.
As the population in China's cities grows rapidly, so does the demand
for power. The number of coal-fired power stations is reaching double
figures in the Guangdong Region alone and Clyde Blowers see enormous
potential for their expertise.
Their commitment to the Far East market is such that Bill Thomson is
considering moving his family out to live in the region, to continue the
development of relationships with China and other countries in Asia.
He will follow up his contacts in the food industry, the
pharmaceutical industry, and iron and steel industries during the next
few months.

ISOMETIMES wonder if those of us who work in the arts have not been
suckered into believing that the business approach to the arts is all
that matters.
In my more cynical moments it seems the most appropriate skill I can
develop is that which enables me to translate the artists' vision into a
language that matches the policies and priorities of funders, both
public and private.
I was asked recently to contribute to a research project on the
motivation of arts managers in Scotland. The results of the project,
which is being conducted by the Social Science Department of Edinburgh
University, will be interesting, particularly because this is quite a
demoralising time to be working in the arts.
The recession has taken its toll on audiences' available spend; the
much-heralded devolution of the Scottish Arts Council to the Scottish
Office rather than the Department of National Heritage has produced no
real increase in funding for the arts; and the imminent re-organisation
of local government presages difficult times ahead for all creative
organisations.
Even the much-vaunted National Lottery cannot directly fund artistic
product: it is for capital projects. What use is a brand-new building if
we cannot afford to make the art to put in it?
Nearly 20 years ago the Government initiated the Association of
Business Sponsorship of the Arts (Absa), a national independent
organisation established to promote and encourage partnership between
the private sector and the arts. Business sponsorship of the arts has
grown from #600,000 in 1976 to #57.7m in 92/93 with sponsorship being
defined as ''the payment of money by a business to an arts organisation
for the purpose of promoting the business's name, products or services.
It is part of a business's general promotion expenditure and can include
an element of corporate or social responsibility.''
When Absa was formed, I was sceptical about the Government's desire to
pursuade the business community that were good reasons for contributing
to the arts. I had concerns that the business world would seek to
influence the work that artists wanted to create and that the persuasive
influence of cash sponsorship might subtly undermine the radical edge of
the creative work that arts organisations set out to deliver to their
audiences.
I also had concerns that the majority of arts sponsorship would go to
a few large and prestigious companies; to arts organisations that were
large enough to employ whole departments dedicated to winning cash from
business, and that the smaller, sometimes more controversial projects
would not win business support but would actually be penalised for
failing to achieve the sponsorship levels expected of them.
Overwhelmingly, my fears have not been realised. My views have altered
towards recognising that business sponsorship offers a straightforward
investment and return strategy for any quality artistic venture.
Moreover, in common with all my colleagues in arts management, I believe
that many arts organisations would simply not survive without commercial
support.
Even the best-managed and most artistically successful of our
companies face the threat of insolvency if they do not take every
measure to maximise their income and curtail their expenditure; yet
curtailing expenditure means cutting wages, which are already pitifully
low, and losing jobs means sacrificing both quality and product from the
repertoire.
I am sure everyone now recognises and acknowledges the role played by
the arts in urban regeneration, in economic development, and in tourism.
All these sectors have benefited from their association with arts
projects, as have many individual companies.
We can be good for each other, with the rewards being mutually
beneficial. Remember though, the next time an arts manager comes
knocking on your door, it is the art that matters and it can't always be
measured by sales figures at the end of the quarter.
As I said earlier, the Scottish business community should not think
the National Lottery will solve the problems of revenue funding in the
arts. There is a real danger that businesses in Scotland will switch
sponsorship to other areas because they think the Lottery will relieve
the underfunding problems, but nothing could be further from the truth.
Lottery money will help create a better working environment for the
artist and the audience, but it cannot cover the cost of commissioning a
concert, installing an exhibition, or employing sufficient actors to put
a play on the stage.
Whether your company is large or small, the arts sector needs you. I
urge Scottish businesses to get involved, develop a dialogue with arts

IT may be a cliche but this week's TrailBlazer, situated in an
unlikely setting -- off the beaten track on the outskirts of Cleland
near Motherwell -- can still claim to be a cut above the rest.
Having specially designed and installed cutting and drilling
machinery, Jack Stirling, proprietor of The Marble Collection, can now
create shapes and designs in marble and granite that no-one else in
Scotland can currently match.
It is traditionally a very hard material to shape and until now it has
proved prohibitively expensive to produce anything other than ogee
(arched or S-shaped) edges on straight lines. But with the newly
developed machinery round columns, flutes, carvings, scalloped edges,
and serpentine shapes have all become possible.
For the past 20 years Stirling, a former Glasgow policeman, and his
wife Helen have run the company, in the early days manufacturing
artificial sandstone tiles to produce stone fireplaces and selling
mainly to large retail outlets, including the Dodge City (now B &amp; Q)
chain.
However, fashion and trends change on an increasingly regular basis
and Jack Stirling has never been slow to move with the times.
The first change to affect the company was a move to natural and real
materials, and it started specialising in real sandstone, making
fireplaces and repairing churches and old buildings.
In the mid to late 80s the demand for sandstone fireplaces all but
disappeared and Stirling began ''dabbling'' in marble.
In an effort to differentiate himself from other manufacturers, he
started producing his own fireplace designs, initially buying material
from England but gradually importing, primarily from Portugal. Now all
the company's annual requirement of 250 tons of marble is imported.
''The Portuguese colours of pinks, whites and greys suit the Scottish
market,'' he explains, ''while the fawns and browns, that are more
characteristic of Italian marble, remain popular in England.''
Stirling has looked at Turkish marble but believes the very strong
purple and red colours would be even less desirable to the Scots.
Given the inherent differences, the company has continued to sell
almost exclusively to the Scottish market. However, Stirling now sees an
opportunity to target the north of England, where there are few
suppliers.
In addition to himself and his wife, the company now has a total of 10
staff -- eight marble masons and two fitters who carry out installation
work. Stirling remains responsible for all the designs, many of which
come from a very frugal nature.
''Over the years we have built up a large stock of off-cuts, and part
of the reason for building the new machinery was to allow us to create a
whole range of designs, often more intricate than has ever been
possible, utilising these small pieces of marble,'' he says
With an average price of between #690 and #890 for fireplaces, and
with a full range of options up to about #2500 (although the most
expensive to date sold for #3500), company turnover has doubled in the
past four years.
This increase is directly attributable to the new machinery, with the
greater flexibility and enhanced capabilities having led Stirling to
develop the marble and granite table side of his business He is now
creating a range of tables that are different from anything else on the
Scottish market.
The demand is strong but Stirling is aware that he can produce them
much faster than he can sell them at the Cleland showroom and he will
therefore be looking to go to the marketplace, potentially wholesaling
to all major and minor furniture outlets.
The other main factor in the company's continuing success is the
significant in-roads Stirling has already made into the market for
granite.
''Granite doesn't scratch or mark,'' he says, ''whereas marble
scratches only too easily. More and more architects are specifying it,
particularly for bar tops and tables for the licensed trade.''
The company is currently sub-contracted to install granite bar tops
for the refurbishment of a leading hotel in Aberdeen. And should this
sound a bit like ''coals to Newcastle'', Stirling says that with most
granite quarries in Aberdeen now closed, he has to source the material
from England.
While still supplying to some small shops, most Marble Collection
fireplaces are made to order, resulting from personal approaches.
''The new machinery has made it possible for us to respond to
virtually any design asked of us, and we see this as becoming
increasingly important in the future,'' he says. ''There are a few of
our best-selling designs that will always be found in our showroom, but
it is more important that we have the flexibility to undertake
individual design specifications.''
There have been offers to mass produce the newly developed machinery
but, to date, all have been resisted. As Stirling explains: ''Once they
are installed, that's it -- there would be no further financial benefit
to us and we would have lost our most significant competitive
advantage.''
As a shrewd businessman, Jack Stirling could never be accused of
losing his marbles.

Scotland's lace industry has made a new start -- and some rather old
machines are playing a vital part.
A QUIET revolution is taking place in the Irvine valley, where the
Scottish lace industry has weaved its traditional patterns for
centuries.
Six years ago the few remaining manufacturers of Scottish lace faced
up to the threat of drifting towards extinction and formed the Scottish
Lace Guild.
It is an exclusive club, and one which it is almost impossible for new
members to join.
To belong you have to make Scottish lace from cotton on machines which
are no longer manufactured. The last Nottingham Lace Machine was made
nearly half a century ago, and most of the machines in use today are
more than 70 years old.
The seven members of the Scottish Lace Guild are centred in the towns
of Darvel, Newmilns, and Kilmarnock where 1500 are still employed in the
industry.
Lace making was introduced into Ayrshire by Normans from France, and
weaving has gone on in these towns since the early 1700s when hand looms
were used. In 1876 mechanical production methods were introduced in the
shape of giant Nottingham Lace Machines. These machines were at first
driven by water power from the River Irvine and then by steam.
Just as in Manchester, the damp wet climate suited cotton, making it
easier to handle, and the industry mushroomed. By the early 1900s more
than 30 companies in the valley were manufacturing cotton lace. Before
the First World War about 7000 were employed in the mills dotted around
the valley.
Between the two world wars the industry went into decline but it was
picking up again when the Second World War broke out. During that war
some of the factories were mothballed, while others made camouflage
netting.
In the mid-fifties there were still 30 companies involved in
traditional lace making but the industry started to decline as modern
machines started to make lace from polyester, a man-made fibre.
But the modern machines were not as big as the Nottingham machine and
could not handle cotton.
The traditional skills were kept alive by a dwindling number of firms
using the original Nottingham machine.
Faced with competition from large international textile companies
producing man-made fibre products, the small Scottish lace companies
decided to come together as a guild to market more effectively the
qualities of traditional lace made from cotton.
The Scottish Lace brand was registered. Only Guild members can use it,
and the fightback began.
Brian Hill, present chairman of the guild, is steeped in the
industry's traditions. He takes pride in showing visitors the
70-year-old Nottingham looms in action at his own company, Smith &amp;
Archibald of Darvel.
His great-grandfather was a handloom weaver, and his grandfather was a
weaver who with many others emigrated to Fort Louden in the US where the
Earl of Louden was Governor.
Brian Hill recalls his great-aunt recounting how she, along with
thousands of others, would walk up the valley from Galston to Darvel.
''She used to describe how the numbers of factory workers walking up
the valley to the mills got greater as they passed through each
village,'' he says.
Brian Hill joined the industry straight from school but left it for a
short time to study business administration. He returned as a salesman
but is now managing director of Smith &amp; Archibald after a management
buy-out several years ago.
Stepping into the Smith &amp; Archibald factory is like walking back in
time. The machines are those installed in 1923 when the company was
formed, and it is not surprising to learn that tourist coaches call at
the factory in the summer months.
''The tourists are amazed when they see the machines in action,'' says
Hill. ''We tried to modernise some of the ancillary operations but found
that working by hand was faster and more efficient.''
He is not worried by the fact that he cannot replace the machines,
even though he depends on them for his business. ''They are 70 years old
but there are machines in the industry which are 100 years old,'' he
says. ''If these machines are well looked after they will last another
100 years, while modern machines last perhaps 15 years.''
The aim of the guild is to creat a brand image for Scottish Lace, and
Brian Hill believes it is succeeding: ''People are now asking for
Scottish Lace. We are looking to bring business back to the industry and
stop the decline.''
The Irvine Valley companies have targeted the export market and
earlier this week they returned from Heimtex in Frankfurt which is the
biggest textile show in the world.
Between 60 and 70% of the industry's turnover of #6m is exported to
the US, Europe, Scandinavia, and the Far East.
Smith &amp; Archibald itself specialises in producing baby blankets and
theatrical gauze which is used as the backdrop for productions such as
Phantom of the Opera.
The company employs 26 people but Brian Hill believes this number
might be increased. ''We sell a great deal of our production to the
Middle East and Malta and new markets are opening up in South Africa,''
he says.
Just over half of Smith &amp; Archibald's turnover goes directly overseas
but Brian Hill believes 90% of the company's turnover ends up as
exports.
''We sell a lot of our produce to agents in London who then sell it on
abroad,'' he explains.
Scotland's lace industry has been written off by many people, but the
Scottish Lace Guild believes it is not only alive but kicking.

* THE highlight of Alan Matthews' festive break in the Big Apple was .
. . a tour of a Greenwich Village meat market.
Alan is managing director of L Matthews and Sons, a butcher's firm
which his father started in 1952 when he opened a shop in Glasgow's
Gallowgate.
The business remained a one-shop concern until Alan and his brother
Gordon started learning the trade.
''I realised that one shop would not be able to keep us all, so I
suggested to my dad that we expand,'' he says.
Today L Matthews and Sons has six shops in Glasgow and East Kilbride
as well as a factory near Castlemilk.
In the 10 days over the festive season the factory produced 5500 steak
pies and throughout the year it makes 400 dozen mutton pies every week.
''We opened the factory five years ago and we now supply between 30
and 40 other butchers in central Scotland with items such as pies,''
says Alan. ''We also supply hotels and restaurants.''
Despite the expansion into the wholesale market the core of the
Matthews business remains retail. ''My father always told me the best
two bob was the one you received over the counter,'' laughs Alan.
''After all, I have to give credit to my wholesale customers.''
Independent butchers have come under increasing pressure from
supermarkets in recent years as shoppers enjoy the benefits of one-stop
shopping.
To combat this, Alan has now opened a franchise in a large discount
supermarket chain in Giffnock.
''I believe this is the way forward and we will be expanding in this
area,'' he says. ''To survive you must go where the shoppers are, and we
have always tried to follow the population.''
Despite the fact that the firm now has a turnover of #2.5m and a staff
of 70, Alan still finds time to butcher meat himself for customers in
his shops.
''I stand in for managers when they are on holiday,'' he says. ''I
like to keep my hands on the tools and keep in touch with my staff.''
On his holiday visit to the New York meat market, he says with a
smile: ''I made sure I took my wife shopping first.''

* A CODE of good practice? About time, we said. These remunerations to
top executives are getting out of hand, we said. They're making British
business a laughing stock, or at least a greeting stock. Then we ordered
another round. It came to #11.58, seeing you ask.
We looked at the list of the Great and Good who will sit down in
solemn conclave at the CBI's behest to discuss whether a 75% pay rise to
#475,000 (Cedric Brown, British Gas) is a good thing. Or even a 3% pay
cut to #1.19m (Greg Hutchings, Tomkins). The adjudicators (or
''regulators'', to use today's fashionable euphemism) will represent the
Institute of Directors, the Association of British Insurers, the
National Association of Pension Funds, the Stock Exchange, and a clutch
of chairmen and chief executives.
''Hm,'' said The Braces thoughtfully. ''There seem to be a few
interested parties missing there. Nobody from the Low Pay Unit? Nobody
from the gas board employees?''
Quite inappropriate, we said. We're talking about self-regulation
here. It's a fine and noble principle -- the sort of thing that
newspapers have. ''I was afraid of that,'' said The Braces. So what will
this ''code of practice'' include? We had a few ideas . . .
Haggard imagery: When photographs of highly-rewarded executives are
released to the press, their faces should be made up to show the effects
of stress and/or workaholism according to the following scale: up to
#500,000 pa, baggy eyes, slack jaw, untidy hair; up to #1m pa, gritted
teeth, staring eyes, hair completely uncombed, squint tie; above #1m pa,
slumped in dark room, drinking milk. This to engender public sympathy.
Credibility gap: There should be a period of at least one month
between the announcement of an obscene pay rise and that of redundancies
from the payroll. In the case of recently privatised industries, this
should be extended to six months and the announcements made in a
whisper.
Terminology retrenchment: Words like ''obscene'', which are favourites
of the envious classes, should be redefined. Presumably there's a
lexicographer around who could use a backhander? Other terms that
require ameliorating adjustment are ''excessive'', ''greedy'', and
''repugnant''.
What about the money thing, though? We agreed there wasn't a helluva
lot the CBI self-regulators could do about that, even if they wanted to,
which we doubted. It's just a question of getting the image across, we
said, echoing every besieged politician since politics began.
Then we ordered another round. It came to #15.11, seeing you ask.
* ''LEADING financial services company Scottish Provident has ignored
government employment policy and granted a paternity leave package to
male staff'' -- news item yesterday.
Querulous Quentin from Profit Expectation Indices was pale with
anxiety when I met him in the corridor. ''What if the rebellion
spreads?'' he asked. ''What if -- heaven forbid -- Nerd House starts to
offer paternity leave?''
I said, don't tell me you have an expectation indice? Yes, he said,
our first. Congratulations, I said. Thanks, he said.
''But this paternity package: I'd enjoy the two days' paid leave, but
the three months' unpaid would cripple me. My wife would insist I took
it, too. She's a self-employed assertiveness counsellor. Can't afford to
take three months off, she'd say. Ruin her career. Do you know what that
would mean?''
Quentin, I said, patting him on the shoulder, this would be your big
chance. You could become a New Man, a Housefather. You could grow a
beard, sprout a backpack, and go about on a bicycle with a little seat
behind for the toddler. We'd all look up to you. We'd be proud of you.
''And you'd say how lucky I was?'' he asked.
No, I said.
Say what you like about Michael Portillo, I thought later, but he did
his best to prevent all this.

<HEADLINE>New snub to Major as rebels set out 'agenda'</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TORY rebels last night delivered what clearly amounted to a further
snub to John Major by announcing publication today of a ''mission
statement'' setting out their views on Europe.
The move showed the rebels are prepared to act as a party within a
party -- but they strongly denied they were signalling an intention to
break away from the Conservative mainstream.
Eight of the nine Tory ''outcasts'' -- now without the party Whip
after an earlier Euro-protest -- are understood to have drawn up the
1000-word document which will be unveiled at a Westminster news
conference.
News of the launch came just hours before the Government faced another
embarrassing rebellion in the Commons over Spanish fishing rights.
The eight are said to be: Mr Tony Marlow, Mrs Teresa Gorman, Sir
Richard Body, Sir Teddy Taylor, Mr John Wilkinson, Mr Nicholas Budgen,
Mr Christopher Gill and Mr Richard Shepherd. The other Tory without the
Whip, Mr Michael Carrtiss has not been involved.
Sir Teddy, MP for Southend East, denied that the document was a
provocative step or that its contents amounted to an alternative Tory
manifesto.
''These are not in any sense conditions or demands,'' he said. ''This
is meant to be helpful. These are ideas which we believe are a possible
basis for the party to unite.
''There are real problems which cannot be avoided. We are presenting
ideas about the way they can be solved.''
Mr Gill, MP for Ludlow, said: ''To the extent that people know where
we are coming from, it is just useful to have a reference, a mission
statement if you like.''
Mr Major held out an olive branch to the group at the weekend when he
talked in terms of weeks rather than months before they will be allowed
back into the fold. However, he called for a show of loyalty in the
voting lobbies.
At a snap news conference on Monday at Downing Street -- to rally his
troops for battle at a time when the party is at its lowest ever poll
ebb -- he saw a ''road to unity'' on European policy and on bringing
back the Euro-rebels.
''It takes two to tango. The music has struck up. We'll see who takes
partners and when,'' the Prime Minister said.
He refused to put a timescale on their return and made it clear the
ball was now firmly in their court.
The rebels' policy document is understood to set out MPs' views that
the EU's Common Fisheries Policy should be abolished and that Britain
should keep tight control on its own foreign and defence policy.
It is also understood to refer to the need for a referendum on how
people want Britain to go forward in Europe and a resolute anti-single
currency stance.
MPs also refer to the row over live animal exports to Europe, saying
it is up to Agriculture Minister William Waldegrave to decide British
policy.

WITHIN months of assuming control of ScottishPower's electrical
contracting division, Mike Staley had cut the earnings of hourly-paid
staff by one-third.
However, his bitter post-privatisation pill appears to have secured
the future of a division which has grown strongly since, more than
doubling its staff in less than three years.
With the electricity company's shareholders demanding profits in every
ScottishPower operation, the relatively small electrical contracting
arm, which works on everything from sockets to power stations, had to
stand alone.
Until then, it had been cushioned from the pressures of the free
market within the giant South of Scotland Electricity Board.
Hard decisions had to be made and Mr Staley, a Geordie who had worked
for the Glasgow electrical and mechanical company James Scott for 20
years and was its deputy divisional managing director, was recruited for
the job.
The severe hourly pay cuts, bell-to-bell working, improved cash
management and a modern just-in-time stock philosophy transformed a
division which can win or lose contracts by pounds. Managing director Mr
Staley admitted that ''a minority'' of his staff still longed for the
old days.
However, he was unsympathetic: ''If all you can think about is
yesterday, then you don't have a lot of future. There were hard
decisions taken then and, if there hadn't been, then we wouldn't be
around now.''
The Hamilton-based division, which had a turnover of #20m in the year
to end-March, 1994, is one of the largest of about 20,000 UK electrical
contractors. Mr Staley claims it leads the industry in terms of return
on capital and is in the top five on a return on sales basis.
He also rates ScottishPower's electrical contracting division highly
against its counterparts in the English regional electricity companies,
some of which have opted for costly and aggressive acquisition
strategies, preferring organic and selective growth.
In-house ScottishPower business accounts for only 15% of the work of
Mr Staley's division, which remains heavily involved in the installation
of storage heaters and has secured a number of major local authority
contracts in this area.
One of the division's more unusual contracts was for electrical
installations in 34 Scottish lifeboat stations, taking in the Orkneys
and Shetland and involving more than 6000 miles of road travel and 55
hours aboard sea ferries.
In April 1992, 30 salaried and 200 hourly-paid staff were transferred
from distribution and supply to the newly-formed electrical contracting
division, and the pay cuts negotiated by Mr Staley with the union after
his appointment were implemented in September 1992.
The respective employee numbers are now 80 and 450 and he will recruit
another 50 during the next few months.
''Most people are saying they are working harder than they were, they
are working longer than they were but, with overtime, they are probably
earning more than they were under their old conditions,'' he said.

THE Assynt Crofters Trust, which bought its own estate two years ago,
is set to take advantage of the Government's promotion of alternative
energy generation, by setting up its own hydro-generation scheme.
The crofters have already been awarded a contract to supply
electricity to the National Grid for 15 years from April 1996, and now
they have to arrange a financing package to build the generating
facility.
The Scottish Office announced in December that ScottishPower and
Hydro-Electric would have to obtain 76 megawatts of new electricity
generating capacity from renewable sources, under the Scottish
Renewables Obligation.
The Assynt hydro scheme is one of 15 hydro-power projects agreed under
the SRO, with generation costs varying from 3.24p per unit, to 4.15p per
unit.
The Assynt crofters bought the North Lochinver estate from a
Scandinavian consortium which had wanted to sell it off in seven
parcels. Since then they have taken several initiatives to generate
income for the estate, including leasing property to an information
technology company, and have begun planting a mixed forestry area on 162
hectares near the village of Achmelvich.
This latest scheme, which is being put forward for Objective 1 funds,
will pay for the appointment of a full-time project officer to look
after the running of the estate, leaving the directors to concentrate on
further development opportunities.
One of the trust directors, John MacKenzie who is a marine engineer,
said the scheme has been thoroughly examined by consultants.
Computer models of all aspects of the scheme were built to ensure it
survives for the length of the contract. The members of the trust are
confident that it will work.
''It involves raising the level of Loch Poll, which lies between
Drumbeg and Clashnessie, by two metres to increase the water storage
capacity,'' said Mr MacKenzie. ''A pipeline will take the water to the
turbine house at the bottom of Fank Brae.
''We are having talks with conservation bodies to ensure that our
plans do not have any adverse effects on the environment.
''The machinery we intend to install will generate 225 kilowatts, and
we have a contract to supply power to the grid for 15 years,'' he said.
The estate itself cost around #300,000 to buy, and this puts the
magnitude of the project into perspective.
''The capital cost of the scheme is greater than the cost of the
estate itself, and we are examining ways of raising our own share of
that cost. We expect that the scheme will generate enough income to
enable us to employ a full-time project officer to look after the
running of the estate.
''We also hope that after the initial 15 years, that a residual
contract will be signed, since the equipment should last 50 years before
it needs to be replaced,'' said John MacKenzie.
The scheme, which is thought to be one of the first in the Highlands
to supply power to the National Grid since the Foyers scheme in 1976, is
already out to tender by four contractors, and continues the trust's
efforts to diversify the income-earning potential of the estate's
assets.
''When we bought the estate, we knew that there were few natural
resources that could be used for the benefit of the crofters without
these being used up very quickly.
''Here is one that can be used almost without worrying about
replenishing the raw material,'' said Mr MacKenzie.

DUNCRAGGAN nursing home, which is no stranger to centenaries, has the
unique honour of being the 100th Scottish company to achieve Investors
in People status.
The award was received by centenarian Violet Cuthbert, a former
journalist who wrote the Aunty Kate column in The Red Letter magazine.
She celebrated her 100th birthday at the Fife nursing home last year.
Investors in People, which recognises a clear commitment by employers
to invest in the skills of employees, has helped matron Anne Ferguson
and her highly qualified nursing staff draw up a more structured
training and development programme, taking into account the provisions
of the 1993 Community Care Act.
The award recognises the vital role of the Newport-on-Tay nursing
home's 34 staff, who provide round-the-clock care for 23 long and
short-term residents.
Last year, the company also introduced a home care service for the
needy within a 10 to 15-mile radius of Duncraggan.
Mrs Ferguson, who is also a partner in the nursing home, said:
''Obviously we are delighted to achieve Investors in People status and
to be the 100th Scottish company to do so. As far as our residents are
concerned, it gives them assurance that the people looking after them
are fully trained.''
Investors in People, administered through Scotland's 22 local
enterprise companies, is geared towards increased productivity and
efficiency, reduction in staff turnover and absenteeism, and a
competitive edge when seeking preferred supplier status.
In Scotland, another 12 organisations have gained Investors in People
status since Duncraggan, with a further 703 working towards the
standard.
Kwik-Fit boss Tom Farmer, chairman of Investors in People Scotland,
said: ''Better people make better businesses and better businesses are
prosperous businesses, resulting in more prosperous communities and a
more prosperous Scotland.''

THE innovative and high-speed world of information and multimedia will
play a large part in the future work of Scotland's businesses.
According to David Pearson, director of enterprise development at
Dunbartonshire Enterprise, massive investment is already being attracted
from major companies throughout the world.
The opportunities available within this sector will be highlighted
during a special business masterclass organised by Dunbartonshire
Enterprise next week.
Mr Pearson said: ''At this masterclass, we have three hi-tech
specialists who, through their combined experience and commercial
success, will bring an informed and accurate view of the global future
within this sector.''
The speakers will be David Sibbald, chairman and managing director of
Atlantech Technologies; Professor Ian Ritchie, an honorary professor at
Edinburgh's Heriot-Watt University, chairman of VIS Interactive Media,
director of Inner Workings, Electronic Book Factory and ITEXT; and
Samuel Docherty, managing director of Delphic Productions.
Mr Sibbald has his business roots in software development engineering.
Within five years of launching his career, he became vice-president of
marketing for a North American telecommunications company, taking him to
live in California and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
Three years ago, Mr Sibbald established Atlantech Technologies, a new
telecommunications software and systems integration company. Today it
employs 25 people and has an annual revenue of #6m.
Following that presentation, Professor Ritchie will explain to
delegates the market adoption of new technology. He is currently
involved in the strategic use of IT in education and scholarship as
convenor of the board of management for information services.
Before this, he founded and managed Office Workstations in Edinburgh
in 1984. The following year he launched its subsidiary OWL International
in Seattle. In 1989, OWL was sold to Matsushita of Osaka (Panasonic) for
#7.85m.
The third masterclass speaker will be Samuel Docherty. Since the
mid-1970s he has been closely involved in film, television and
associated media production.
In 1983, he set up his Education &amp; Training Consultancy and two years
later joined In-Video Productions in Edinburgh as a production director.
Last year, Mr Docherty created Delphic Productions and now specialises
in multimedia productions in CDi, CD ROM and video CD for a wide range
of companies.
The First Steps Business Masterclass entitled The Future in
Information &amp; Multimedia is being held on Wednesday, 25 January, 1995,
at Glasgow Caledonian University's Park Campus. For information on
future masterclasses telephone 0800 703 704.

BAFFLED Scottish companies are stuck on the hard shoulder of the
so-called communications superhighway, with a survey revealing that a
lack of hi-tech knowledge is damaging the core business of one-third of
firms.
However, help is at hand following the launch in Glasgow yesterday of
the Telecomms Audit. The joint venture involves local enterprise
companies in Glasgow, Lanarkshire, Tayside and Grampian, and was
welcomed by the Scottish Advisory Committee on Telecommunications
watchdog.
A pilot study of 60 firms in the LEC areas revealed that 70% were not
making the most of their telecomms and, in half the cases, this
shortcoming was detrimental to their core business.
Over a two-year period, Bellshill-based business consultant MARI
Scotland hopes to direct another 160 small and medium-sized companies,
40 from each area, along the superhighway.
With an ever-increasing range of products on offer in a
telecommunications market on course to become the third largest in the
world by the turn of the century, businesses could be excused for being
confused.
Companies with fewer than 250 employees will be the beneficiaries of
the new scheme. They will be helped to compete with many larger
organisations which are already using communications technology to widen
the gap between themselves and smaller competitors.
Glasgow Development Agency senior project executive Catherine MacLeod,
who found Scottish companies in real danger of being left behind by the
telecomms revolution, believes the audit could help bring Scotland's
businesses in from the international periphery.
For example, one of the companies which benefited during the pilot
period was Glasgow-based carpet wholesaler and manufacturer Shenkin
Group, which has saved #3000 a year.
It obtained a ''smart box'', which diverts calls to the cheapest
available supplier, and installed a fax link between the sales office
and a warehouse one mile away, saving employees from running between the
two and lowering the risk of losing orders.
General manager Paul McNulty said of the audit: ''After months of
searching for independent advice, this truly seemed to be the answer to
my prayers.''
Radio Tay also benefited, discovering that a relatively new system,
installed in 1988, was inadequate.

THE Royal Bank of Scotland has expanded its joint European
cross-border banking network, IBOS, into Denmark and at least another
two countries look set to join within months.
Unibank of Copenhagen, one of Denmark's big two banks, became the
sixth to take part in the scheme which allows customers of all the
member banks to use international services through a common technology.
It also allows them to move funds immediately across borders with
automatic exchange conversion as well as the kind of regular access --
balances, standing orders, transfers and so on -- provided by the home
banks.
Aside from the Royal, a joint founder, and the Danish newcomer, IBOS
has four member banks -- Banco Santander of Spain, Credit Commercial de
France, Belgium's Kredietbank, and Banco de Comercio e Industria of
Portugal.
The traditional caution of the German banking sector has apparently
delayed its entry into the system and though the Royal would make no
comment, Austria and the Netherlands look likeliest to become the next
countries to be represented.
Welcoming the membership of Unibank, the Royal's Norman McLuskie said
IBOS had now made its first move into the growing market of Scandinavia.
The Danish bank's 440 branches take the IBOS total to 3800 across
Europe.
''It represents a further significant step towards the building of a
'European Virtual Bank' aimed at offering a high value-added range of
instant cross-border services,'' he said.
Among the British banks, the Royal has led the way in expanding links
with its continental counterparts.

THE Aberforth Split Level investment trust has shown a 0.3% dip in
total return for the last six months of 1994 compared with a 1.6% fall
in the benchmark Extended Hoare Govett Smaller Companies Index.
A second interim dividend of 2p per income share was declared to give
a 4p total for the six months, the same as previously.
''However, barring unforeseen circumstances, when our results are
announced in July it should prove possible to make a modest increase
over the dividends paid in the previous year,'' the board said.
Net asset value per capital share was 254.5p (269.2p) and total assets
fell to #82.3m from #89.7m.

SCOTLAND, like the North of England, remains relatively pessimistic
about trends in unemployment, according to the latest quarterly regional
consumers' survey from Gallup and BSL.
Across the UK as a whole fear of unemployment has fallen to its lowest
level since 1989, the biggest fall being recorded in the West Midlands,
with London also showing a marked improvement.
Attitudes to the prevailing economic situation showed no change in
Scotland on the previous quarter. Elsewhere every region except London
and Wales had become more pessimistic.
Respondents among the 6000 sample continued to report no improvement
in their finances. The proportion thinking the time is right to make
major purchases continues to fall. Only East Anglia and South-east
England moved against that trend.
The latest results show consumer spending rising fastest in the
South-west, year-on-year, but falling in Scotland. The feel-good factor
is still failing to materialise, say the researchers.

AROUND #3m worth of business is expected to be done between now and
Sunday at the first Made in Scotland trade fair in Glasgow, which opens
at the SECC today.
The organisers counted the show a success even before it opened and
have booked the venue again for next year. It has achieved its aim of
attracting new buyers who have not visited the traditional trade fair in
Aviemore in October.
By placing the SECC event immediately following the major Dublin fair,
Made in Scotland has convinced a number of important North American and
Australian buyers to make the short flight to Glasgow.
For that reason Kathleen Hardie, the chief executive of Made in
Scotland, admitted it was impossible to make precise predictions about
final figures from the show.
''We are expecting in the region of 2000 buyers and we have 180
exhibitors,'' she said. ''I would expect it to generate sales of between
#2m and #3m -- Aviemore generates #10.8m and this is one third of the
size.
''But this is the buying season, the buyers look more like big
spenders and these are people we have not seen in Aviemore. Quite a few
of the buyers who were at Dublin are coming over.''
The trade fair has taken a year to plan.

Repeat orders from long-standing clients in Hong Kong and a new one
with a Singapore group have provided the bulk of the contracts, and the
region's importance was underlined with the creation of a Walter
Alexander Hong Kong subsidiary.
Citybus and the Kowloon Bus company ordered a total of 120
double-deckers and 200 single deck frames were ordered by Singapore Bus
Services and Trans-Island, also from Singapore.
''Our new Hong Kong subsidiary represents further strengthening of our
commitment to Far East customers and improves our position to benefit
from future developments in the Asia Pacific region,'' chief executive
Ian Galloway said yesterday.

<HEADLINE>Japan may need extra Budget as damage estimates soar</HEADLINE>

Tokyo, Wednesday -- Japan may be forced to draft a supplementary state
Budget to repair damage from the earthquake as estimates of the damage
rose to anything from $20bn to $140bn.
Local economists said much of the economic impact would hinge on how
quickly and effectively the government acted to fund reconstruction.
''If the government's efforts are insufficient, or too slow, there
could be a negative impact on the economy,'' said Shigeru Saito, an
economist at Daiwa Research Institute. ''But if they come up with bold
support measures, the negative impact should be offset.''
Chief Cabinet Secretary Kozo Igarashi told a news conference that the
likelihood of an add-on Budget would probably grow as the full extent of
the damage from the earthquake emerged.
It hit Japan when its state finances were already severely troubled as
the domestic economy slowly pulled out of the nation's worst recession
since the Second World War.
Dwindling tax revenues had already prompted the government to draw up
a supplementary draft Budget in December to cut overall state spending
for 1994-95 to 72.41 trillion yen ($731bn) from an original 73.08
trillion yen ($738bn).
One of the most difficult things to calculate is the loss of economic
output from damaged factories, communications, transportation systems
and the like.
Hyogo Prefecture, where Kobe is located, accounted for just over 4% of
Japan's total production and estimated the earthquake could result in a
loss of 0.5%-0.7% of national output for six months or so.
Still, economists said that fresh demand stimulated by rebuilding
combined with government emergency aid would eventually more than offset
the short-term negative impact. -- Reuter

THE market was wrongfooted yesterday by December's surprisingly large
jump in headline inflation, the monthly increase of 0.5% lifting the
annual rate from 2.6% in November to 2.9%, its highest level since
November 1992.
The figure was well above market forecasts which had centred on 2.7%.
The underlying rate, excluding mortage interest, rose to 2.5% from 2.3%
against projections that it would mark time. This is just a shade within
the lower half of the Government's 1-4% target range.
The figures, accompanied by a steep fall in unemployment, the biggest
since the recovery began, prompted speculation that interest rates would
soon need to rise as the economy was expanding too fast, a particularly
sensitive subject given the Halifax Building Society's decision to raise
mortgage rates.
The December RPI outcome, though, appears to fly in the face of the
speech delivered in Glasgow on Monday by the Governor of the Bank of
England, Eddie George, when he sought to dampen fears of an early
increase. He said he could not say when a rise might be necessary. At
the time, this was taken by the financial markets to indicate he would
probably not be recommending the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth
Clarke, lift rates in the next few months.
Nevertheless, many economists considered February a distinct
possibility for a rise and December's RPI can only heighten this belief.
However, the Governor would almost certainly have had a good idea of
December's RPI when he made his speech. And yesterday ministers were
quick to pour cold water on any resurging market fever on interest
rates.
Kenneth Clarke made clear that the inflation figures were in line with
his expectations and did not present a problem because he had already
taken action with two increases in rates. He considered the Government
had acted in good time to make sure the economic recovery was not
threatened by inflation. This, taken with the Governor's speech, would
still seem to imply an increase in base rates is not imminent and that
the Chancellor and the Governor will want to see more data before coming
to any decision.
Today's official retail sales figures for December will no doubt be
studied closely. On the evidence of the recent CBI survey they should be
reasonably buoyant, although analysts remain cautious. December is
considered a somewhat unreliable month given the special seasonal
factors which must be allowed for.
The January retail sales performance, due in the middle of next month,
is likely to be more significant. If consumers are spending more and it
is being sustained on a seasonal basis, the authorities may decide the
economy is in danger of overheating despite previous interest rate
increases and apply the monetary brake yet again. Next week's CBI
Industrial Trends survey is also likely to be keenly scrutinised.
An encouraging feature of yesterday's data, so far as the inflationary
outlook is concerned, were the figures on pay. Unit wage costs fell by
1.3% in the three months to end-November, while underlying earnings rose
3.75% on an annnual basis compared to October's figure, revised down
from 4% to 3.75%. However, some analysts believe there could be a
pick-up later on and point to a slowdown, from 1.6% in the preceding
three months, in the rate at which wage costs were falling.
Moreover, despite the reassuring words from the Chancellor, many
economists still believe interest rates will have to rise. If this
proves to be the case, given the pattern of the last two increases,
which have taken plance on a quarterly basis, March would seem the
probable month for a rise.
Meanwhile, in the RPI, most groups of goods and services showed
increases last month, much of the damage being done by the Budget. Food
prices were up sharply and there were also increases for household
goods. The former rose 0.7% with seasonal food up 3.7%. But these
figures are hard to cite as examples of underlying inflationary
pressures. Analysts considered other components, particularly the rise
in prices for personal goods and services as of greater concern.
Other figures released yesterday show that the Government borrowed
#677m in December, taking the deficit for the first nine months of the
1994/95 financial year to #23.3bn compared with #31.4bn for the same
period last year. The official forecast for the full year is #34bn, but
the Government is set to undershoot this comfortably.

MOTHERWELL player-manager Alex McLeish, like the experienced defender
he is, played a sound, steady and cautious game yesterday when he
considered the prospect of returning to the international scene in next
month's B match with Northern Ireland.
''I haven't spoken to Craig (Brown) at all,'' said McLeish, who will
be 36 this weekend, ''but I can see what he is thinking about.''
McLeish, who confessed that he has been injured for the last month,
accepted that the move by the national coach to bring him back, even at
B level, would cause controversy. ''Obviously, there will be people
against it, those who will be looking for younger players, but I
understand that sometimes, no matter how much you say in coaching
players and telling them what to do, the chance to give them guidance on
the field is special. But as far as my own situation is concerned, I'd
rather speak to Craig before I do anything else.''
McLeish has pressing problems of his own to tackle, of course.
Motherwell have lost three of their last four games and drawn the other,
being beaten by Rangers, Hearts and Kilmarnock, and drawing with Hibs, a
run that has seen their title challenge become distant.
But McLeish refuses to let the emotions of such a depressing spell
force him into foolish reaction. ''There will be no panic here,'' he
said. ''The players who did so well to get us up the league have not
become bad players overnight. I will be preaching the same message, to
play the passing game that got us to where we were.''
The manager felt that the display against Kilmarnock, despite the 2-0
scoreline, was not so bad. ''We lost goals from a free kick and a
penalty, and, to be honest, Killie caused us no problems besides that.''
McLeish pointed out that, during the bad spell, the team had been
disturbed by injuries to Dougie Arnott and Brian Martin, as well as the
suspension of Jamie Dollan, but had had still to learn the art of
''digging out results when you're not playing well.''
Kilmarnock had considered themselves unlucky in their last few games,
too, and manager Alex Totten was anxious to make full use of the two
home games, against Motherwell on Tuesday and Falkirk on Saturday. The
first leg was successful, and Falkirk will not head for Ayrshire in
excessively confident mood.

BRING back Billy Bremner . . . and while we are out looking for him,
why not order the SFA's posse of community officers to travel the
country and peek through the windows of eventide homes to see if there
are any other ageing former Scottish internationalists who can be
dragged out?
Get your teeth in and tie the old boots back on lads, the chances are
Scotland's manager, Craig Brown, will be giving you a call.
Admittedly, Motherwell manager Alex McLeish is not yet in need of a
Zimmer, but recalling him to international duty is just a touch
far-fetched, even if it is for a B match against Northern Ireland at
Easter Road next month. McLeish, who will be 36 on Saturday, is a
manager, for goodness sake, and not some fresh-faced tenderfoot making
his way in the game.
Of course, he is still registered as a player and would be willing to
turn out for Motherwell in an emergency -- he last played for the Fir
Park side against Kilmarnock in October -- but with 77 caps lying in the
drawer at home, his days as an internationalist are long over.
He was an impressive player in a Scotland shirt and we should be left
with warm memories of his patriotic exploits, instead of having them
tarnished.
Brown's logic in even considering McLeish for the B game is not merely
baffling, it is ludicrous. It is also ill-conceieved, because McLeish
could not turn out for his local pub side. He's injured!
The Scotland manager, in whose judgment this small, success-starved
nation has placed its faith and its hopes, obviously believes the
veteran's vast experience would be of benefit to the younger players who
may be given opportunities against Northern Ireland. Oh, really?
Are we talking here about Scot Gemmill, who has been performing
regularly in Nottingham Forest's midfield? Excuse me, Mr Manager, but
are Forest not fourth top in an extremely competitive and skilful
English premiership? Is he still in need of guidance?
I think not, and neither are any of the rest, even if Brown believes
the presence of McLeish on the pitch could provide an education and a
calming influence. For God's sake, it's Northern Ireland we are about to
play, not Brazil.
It is a game in which we should be allowed a look at players like
Hibs' Pat McGinlay and Darren Jackson, and Rangers' Ally McCoist needs
games to sharpen his predatory skills. Hearts' Craig Levein, who has
been in the wilderness at club and international level because of
suspension, also could use a game.
Then there is David Robertson, of Rangers, who is usually taken with
the full squad but for some inexplicable reason rarely gets a game.
Could not he be squeezed in somewhere against the Irish?
Surely Brown is not seriously trying to have us believe that by
deploying McLeish he can take us back to the future. The inclusion of
McLeish would do no more than dishearten some young player who would
have to be left out to accommodate the Motherwell manager.
Also, how would players like his own Motherwell stalwarts, Brian
Martin, who has been on the fringe of the senior squad, and Chris McCart
feel if their manager is given a place before them?
I suspect McLeish himself might be embarrassed by the very prospect,
but this is not of his doing. Brown and no-one else is responsible for
perpetrating a ridiculous situation.
He should ask himself another question. He should wonder how many
managers, who might be asked to hand over players at a crucial stage of
the season, would be absolutely furious that he might be demeaning the
significance of the exercise by including someone from the game's past?
Even by simply considering McLeish the international manager relegates
the game into the realm of farce. It is his team, but someone should
prevent him from making us all look foolish.
Alex McLeish indeed. Behave yourself, Brown. Get real!

LEE Clark hit a late winner as Newcastle left Blackburn's dreams of a
double in tatters last night while Birmingham took Liverpool to a
penalty shoot-out before bowing out of the FA Cup after finishing 1-1
after extra time.
Only five minutes of the third-round replay at Ewood Park remained
when Clark clinched a home fourth-round meeting with second division
Swansea for Kevin Keegan's side, who won 2-1.
Liverpool's Jamie Redknapp and Stig Inge Bjornebye held their nerve to
pass the 12-yard test while Birmingham failed from all four of their
attempts.
Redknapp had earlier netted after 21 minutes before Birmingham striker
Ricky Otto equalised after 69 minutes to send the tie into extra time.
Millwall's Mark Beard and Mark Kennedy piled on the pain for
under-fire Arsenal manager George Graham at Highbury.
Beard struck after 10 minutes and Kennedy completed a surprise 2-0 win
for the first division side with a goal in the last minute, booking a
plum home clash with Chelsea.
Coventry looked as if they were on their way out of the competition at
West Bromwich, but two late goals in four minutes brought an unlikely
2-1 victory and a clash with Norwich at Highfield Road.
Both sides had a player sent off. Coventry's Paul Clarke was
red-carded for dissent and West Brom's Darren Bradley for two bookable
offences.
Uwe Rosler rattled in four goals and fellow German Maurizio Gaudino
also made the scoresheet as Manchester City denied new Notts County
manager Howard Kendall a happy return to Maine Road with a crushing 5-2
win.
First division promotion chasers Tranmere cruised to a 3-0 win over
third division Bury to book a home meeting with Wimbledon.
Luton will have a fourth-round crack at Southampton at Kenilworth Road
after winning 1-0 at second division Bristol Rovers, Dwight Marshall
scoring after 63 minutes.
Two goals in extra-time goals earned Joe Jordan's Bristol City 3-1
victory over his former club Stoke and fourth round tie against Everton.
Striker Keith Scott netted his first goal for Stoke after 17 minutes
but Junior Bent levelled after 71 minutes and extra-time efforts from
Ian Baird and Brian Tinnion gave City victory.

Hearts 2, Hibernian 0
IT WAS always likely Hearts would refuse to live too long in the
shadow of Hibernian, who had broken a miserable five-year sequence
without a win against their city rivals by winning the two derby matches
in the first half of the season. Natural order, so far as Hearts'
legions are concerned, was restored last night.
The Tynecastle side restored their dominance in local affairs before
12,630 supporters, and few of the witnesses could argue with the
outcome.
When David Hagen hit Hibs' bar in only four minutes the Easter Road
side might have guessed they would have an evening of problems, and so
it turned out.
Dave McPherson scored his first goal since returning to Tynecastle
from Rangers last October and then John Millar put Hibs firmly in their
place when he scored late in the match.
Darren Jackson, Pat McGinlay, and Keith Wright all ought to have
scored from decent chances in the second half but, had Hibs taken a
point, justice would not have been served. Their negligence, and Hearts'
greater awareness, means Rangers still enjoy a 14-point lead over Hibs
and Motherwell, who are joint second in the premier division, while
Hearts now move alongside Celtic two points further behind.
The transformation in Hearts' form and fortunes is nothing short of
remarkable given their struggle in the first half of the campaign. Then
they were haunted by the spectre of relegation, but now they have joined
the battle for European places.
Indeed, this struggle is the only real contest in the division now,
but the manner in which Hearts have emerged from a dismal start suggests
they could be travelling abroad next season.
Their manager, Tommy McLean, discovered Neil Berry, who has a damaged
ankle, was unfit and had to press Craig Levein back into action even
though he had missed the previous 10 games because of suspension. His
last match before sentence began was against Hibs, but this time the
result was in his team's favour.
''I should make it clear Levein was not an automatic choice, and even
he had to play with a hamstring injury,'' said McLean. ''It would not
have been fair had Levein been able to walk straight back into the team
when the others had done so well.''
Nevertheless, his captain aggravated the injury and it is likely he
will miss Saturday's match against Rangers at Ibrox.
Mention should also be made of Brian Hamilton, who was playing in his
first derby game since leaving Easter Road to sign on at Tynecastle and
he coped well with the extra pressures which fell upon him.
Hibs failed to use the width of the pitch and were predictable in much
of what they tried to attempt. In the end they got what they deserved,
another defeat, and still they suffer from an inability to score away
from home.
Their manager, Alex Miller, would have preferred more wing play, but
Kevin McAllister flitted in and out of the action without imposing
himself for any lengthy period. Michael O'Neill, one of the best players
in the premier division when he is in the mood, had been fighting an
injury all week and he didn't look to be in peak condition.
''It's true he had been injured, but he was fit enough to play,''
Miller said.
The Irishman might not be fit this weekend when Hibs play Aberdeen and
Gordon Hunter, who was taken off and replaced by David Farrell in the
second half, also is doubtful for that match.
Leighton's net bulged in 28 minutes when Bett's corner on the left
floated in perfectly for any tall men, and they don't come much larger
than McPherson, who couldn't resist the offer, scoring with a glancing
header.
Only a minute had been played in the second half when Hibs engineered
a splendid opportunity to draw level, but Jackson failed to apply a
solid enough touch on O'Neill's free kick and the ball glanced off his
head and passed yards wide of Nelson's goal.
It was not long after this incident that Hearts withdrew Bett from
their midfield and sent on Colquhoun, who decided to make his presence
known without delay. He sped down the right wing before crossing into
the middle where Robertson was denied by Leighton, but Hibs didn't
manage to clear properly.
The ball was delivered from the right to the far post where Hagen
tried a first-time shot. He really ought to have steadied himself first
because his shot flew the way he was facing, which wasn't towards goal.
The game was taken beyond Hibs' reach eight minutes from time when
Millar, who surged on to Hagen's pass, slid the ball into the net at
Leighton's right-hand post.
HEARTS -- Nelson, Frail, Miller, Levein, Jamieson, McPherson,
Hamilton, Bett, Robertson, Millar, Hagen. Substitutes -- Mackay,
Colquhoun, Smith.
HIBERNIAN -- Leighton, Miller, Mitchell, McGinlay, Tweed, Hunter,
McAllister, Weir, Wright, Jackson, O'Neill. Substitutes -- Farrell,
Findlay, Reid.
Referee -- A Waddell (Edinburgh).

THE British Athletics Federation yesterday announced a #4m package
from the TSB, which will begin with sponsorship of the UK team's kit
against Russia in Birmingham a week on Saturday, writes Doug Gillon.
The deal also covers the Kelvin Hall match against France on February
11, the summer international against the USA, and the European Cup in
Lille.
Significantly the TSB have continued their backing for schools
athletics, in which last year they expressed particular interest, even
suggesting it would be their only target, in the face of the series of
doping scandals. Their input has had marked impact on the Scottish
Schools AA, where performances are improving significantly.
Yesterday's announcement, following a #[1/2]m agreement struck with
Mazda earlier this week, lifts a cloud from the sport, amid concerns
that last year's six doping convictions -- more than any other national
in world athletics -- might rebound on sponsorship.
BAF heaved a sigh of relief, though only #1m will come to them in
actual cash. Spokesman Tony Ward admitted that drugs had been mentioned
in discussions with both sponsors. ''But clearly they were satisfied
with the fact that the thousands of tests show that 99.9% of our
competitors are clean.''

CELTIC skipper Paul McStay and his team-mates are ready to do their
share in the club's rebuilding programme -- by buying a stake in the
club.
Players like McStay, fellow Scotland internationalist John Collins,
and long-serving Republic of Ireland goalkeeper Pat Bonner will take
advantage of the club's share issue.
All three, as well as midfielder Peter Grant, will invest in Celtic
before the 10am deadline on January 24.
Celtic hope to raise #9.4million, and say they have received more than
7000 enquiries for details, and more than 25,000 fans have been mailed
information. Irish investor Dermot Desmond already has bought #4million
worth through his company, Quay Financial Software Ltd.
McStay, who wants to remain at the club when his contract expires this
summer said: ''I'll definitely be buying shares. The chance is there for
everyone who can afford it to have their say in what goes on at
Celtic.''
Collins, top goal scorer so far this season, said: ''It's a good thing
to do and something I can hand on to my children.
''It's nice to know you have got a small part of the club which, I'm
sure, is the way everyone will feel.''
Meanwhile, Celtic will puttickets on sale tomorrow for their Scottish
Cup, third round tie with St Mirren at Hampden on January 28.

PHIL Mowbray, a 21-year-old Edinburgh University student, made history
yesterday when he became the first member of Hunters Bog Trotters to
gain full selection for Britain.
But the honour could prompt the club to ask him to resign. For, in
being one of four Scots named to compete against Russia, in the 3000
metres at Birmingham's National Arena a week on Saturday, Mowbray has
broken an unwritten HBT club rule.
Trotters frown on egotism, those who take themselves too seriously,
and particularly on the too-intense pursuit of excellence. Winning races
is discouraged, even ensured, by the most bizarre means. Some of their
number, for example, even stop during road and cross-country races, when
the location of hostelries permits, to partake of a pint, ideally of
real ale, before continuing.
Tom McKean, Brian Whittle, and Mel Neef, from mainstream Scottish
clubs, may find it hard to adjust to Fifer Mowbray.
They are a non-elitist bunch, the chocolate-vested Trotters. They take
their name from an area in Edinburgh's Holyrood Park, and not, as the
Scottish Amateur Athletic Association believed when initially denying
them the right to the name, from anything with lavatorial connotations.
The most coveted club honour is the Golden Trotter vest, awarded to
the last person after each race, and passed, unwashed, week by week, to
the successive last man. The holder at the season's end wins the Golden
Trotter -- a freshly severed pig's foot from the local butcher, which is
then carefully spray-painted gold.
Mowbray, however, while showing hedonistic tendencies to compare with
the best of his colleagues, is repeatedly showing what his club will
view as a disconcerting ability, and a British vest will rank as the
ultimate heresy.
Last year, he was Britain's fastest under-23 metric miler, ranked
fourth senior in Scotland at 1500m with 3-41.63. On Hogmanay he stunned
English pundits when he scored a runaway victory in a 3000m
cross-country event at Durham -- a special race for track runners, in
which his victims included former world 1500m champion Steve Cram, and
major championship medallists Mark Rowland, John Mayock, and Matthew
Yates.
McKean, who took the Scottish West District 800m title last weekend at
the Kelvin Hall, is a predictable choice for the McDonald's
International, teaming up with Craig Winrow for the distance at which he
is still reigning world indoor champion.
Whittle, twice European Indoor Championship silver medallist at 400m,
returns to indoor racing for the first time in almost two years, chosen
for that distance and the relay. Neef, who broke Linsey Macdonald's
12-year-old national 200m record last weekend, has declined individual
selection, and goes only in the 4X400m relay.
Britain lost last year's match by 28 points, and though Colin Jackson
goes in both the 60m hurdles and flat 60m, and John Regis in the 200m,
several leading performers, including Linford Christie, are unavailable.
Great Britain team:
Men. 60m: C Jackson, M Rosswess. 200m: J Regis, D Braithwaite. 400m: B

IF there is any secret in survival in the premier division, Partick
Thistle must know it. In recent times Thistle have been through more
dogfights than The Red Baron, and it is that experience which other
sides currently looking down at them will fear when the battle gets even
scrappier and more tense, as it surely will.
One of their scorers in the 3-1 win at Falkirk on Tuesday, Alan
Dinnie, summed it up best when he said: ''When you are already bottom of
the league, no more pressure can be put on you. That is why we can relax
and just go out and play.''
Those are words which will send a slight shiver down the spines of
those connected with Dundee United, the club nearest the grasp of the
Firhill lot, but there are others further up the table who might have to
remember them when the late stages of the relegation struggle are
contested.
Celtic ought not to be involved in that competition but, as they are
next to take on Thistle, at Firhill on Saturday, they should be aware
that the Jags are thirsting for more scalps as their confidence, not to
mention cheek, rises.
Talking of cheek, nobody has more of it -- in the football sense, of
course, -- than Chic Charnley, who may have been a Celtic fan all his
life but has no doubts about who will be under the collar this weekend.
''We are under no pressure,'' said Chic, ''because there are no
expectations of us. But there will be plenty expected of them.''
Like Dinnie, Charnley has been over this course a few times, and he
and his peers at Firhill have a perverse talent for thriving when the
times are at their bleakest. ''Some of the others are coming down the
table to meet us,'' he added, ''and we know what this is all about. It
will be a test of nerve for teams like Dundee United.''
Thistle have drawn with Rangers and beaten Falkirk in two of their
last three games, form which, despite the defeat by Aberden sandwiched
between, suggests that they are working up to their dogfighting best.
But their captain believes manager John Lambie has helped them along
in a way he did not anticipate. Albert Craig reckons the players have
been upset at Lambie's public criticism of them, even if he acknowledges
some of it was justified. ''That win over Falkirk was to shut him up,''
he said.
To be fair, Lambie has not been slow to praise his gang when he felt
it was warranted and he will be happy to hold his peace if Thistle can
collect results like that at Brockville.
He will have Rod McDonald available again after suspension for the
match with Celtic, but the game that could be crucial for their survival
hopes follows next Tuesday, when Dundee United come to Glasgow. Victory
over United might well throw open the struggle at the bottom.

LEADING British agent John Bicourt will continue to act for 20 of
Kenya's world-ranked athletes, despite yesterday's announcement of an
extension of a ban by the Kenyan Amateur Athletic Association, writes
Doug Gillon.
David Okeyo, the KAAA general secretary, said that Bicourt, who was
suspended by the association last year over his involvement with their
athletes, had not met a January 15 deadline for registering with the
KAAA.
''It's a load of bullshit,'' said former Olympic steeplechaser
Bicourt, whose stable includes world 5000 metres champion Ismael Kirui,
Olympic 800m silver medallist Nixon Kiprotich, and the women's World
Cross Challenge leader, Rose Cheruiyot.
Bicourt, who alleges incompetence at best, if not corruption, in the
KAAA, said: ''I won't be registering, neither will the other agents, and
we will continue to act for the athletes. The KAAA is incapable of
dealing with individuals. Top meeting promoters say they will continue
to work with us and the IAAF unofficially acknowledges the situation.
''It is hardly surprising -- they have letters showing that money paid
to the KAAA is not finding its way to the athletes.'' One of Okeyo's
predecessors, Robert Ouko, was dismissed for misappropriation of
athletes' funds.

JIM Courier is heading for an Australian Open Tennis Championship
showdown with world No.1 Pete Sampras after a stunning three-set
demolition of Italy's Cristiano Caratti yesterday.
Courier, finding Melbourne the ideal venue to parade a new laid-back
image, followed up his impressive first-round victory over the Czech
Republic's David Rikl with a 6-2, 6-2, 6-1 win over Caratti in just 80
minutes.
'It is a different atmosphere here. It's a lot more relaxed than the
three other Grand Slams,'' said Courier, who has pledged to enjoy life
more this year after a forgettable 1994, when his ranking slipped from
three to 13.
Courier lost to Sampras in last year's semi-finals and they are likely
to meet again in the quarter-finals after his fellow-American gave a
similar awesome performance in removing Jan Kroslak, of Slovakia, 6-2,
6-0, 6-1.
Michael Stich lifted some of the German gloom following Boris Berker's
surprise defeat by scoring a straight-sets victory over unseeded
American Alex O'Brien. ''I believe I can raise my game another 30 to
40%,'' said Stich after beating O'Brien 6-0, 6-3, 6-4.
But Germany suffered a setback in the women's singles with Sabine Hack
tumbling out in the first round to America's Audra Keller 7-5, 1-6, 6-0.
Martina Hingis, from Switzerland, had the first big disappointment of
her career as one of her slightly older friends continued her story-book
progress. The 14-year-old's Grand Slam debut, which had begun so
promisingly with a first-round triumph, ground to a halt with a straight
sets defeat by Japan's Kyoko Nagatsuka.
But 17-year-old Dally Randriantefy from Madagascar kept teenage hopes
alive with a 6-2, 6-0 win over Argentina's Patricia Tarabini.
Mary Pierce, whose family problems have frequently disrupted her
career, praised her father after cruising into the third round. The
20-year-old French girl, seldom willing to comment about her personal
troubles, thanked her father for instilling discipline during her
teenage years.
''My father pushed me really hard and gave me a work ethic,'' said
Pierce after her 6-1, 6-2 defeat of unseeded South African Elna Reinach.
Pierce's father, Jim, was banned in 1993 from watching his daughter at
tournaments after years of disruptive behaviour.
Her presence in Melbourne has once again excited a mystery admirer who
sends her flowers after every match at the Australian Open. ''I got some
yellow flowers today,'' she smiled. ''It only happens in Australia.''
* KEN Wood suffered his third first-round defeat in as many weeks on
the Reebok British Tour when he lost 7-6, 6-0 yesterday to Matthew
Wallhead at Wigan.
Tayport's Nicola Payne failed to join fellow Scots Jennifer Duncan and
Nicola Burns in today's opening round of the women's singles when she
lost 0-6, 6-4, 6-2 to Yorkshire's Clare Farrar in the final qualifying
round. Duncan takes on second seed Sarah Bentley, while Burns meets the
favourite, Mandy Wainwright.

GREG Norman fairly summarised the challenge presented by the Dubai
Desert Classic, the European Tour's inaugural event of the 1995
calendar, when he said: ''The course is testing and in great condition,
and because there's a phenomenal field, we'll be coming out tomorrow
with guns loaded.''
The field of 120 does indeed comprise six of the eight leading players
on the Sony world rankings -- Nick Price, Norman, Bernhard Langer, the
holder Ernie Els, Fred Couples, and Colin Montgomerie. The absentees are
Nick Faldo, this week launching his re-dedication to the US Tour, and
Jose Maria Olazabal, continuing his extended winter retreat.
Severiano Ballesteros and Ian Woosnam are holding their fire until the
Johnnie Walker Classic next week in Manila and so the paradoxical irony
of Faldo's decision is lost on no-one. After all, his criteria for
achievement of confrontation with the best, on a course worthy of the
best and in the best of weather, will on all accounts be fully met.
Montgomerie's unequivocal response to the absence of a friend was:
''The European Tour is strong enough to lose one star, even Faldo.''
For his part, Price is my no means convinced of the authenticity of
the present rankings system. ''Ten world tour events, bringing the best
together regularly, would better settle the arguments,'' he said.
Price, making his first 1995 appearance, added: ''I would rather win
seven times (as he did last year) and be third on the list than win once
and finish first.'' He believes that ''if I attend to the fundamentals
in my swing, take each shot, day, and week as they come -- in other
words, try to do the same things,'' he can sustain success.
Then he cautioned: ''Because I played like that last year doesn't mean
I'll do so again. I'll try, but you never know in this game. You can
play as well as in winning and be second, third, fourth, or fifth --
it's just that the X-factor that takes you to the winning post is
absent.''
That a victory early in the year can launch a season of spectacular
advancement was -- unwittingly at the time, of course -- confirmed 12
months ago by Els. The young South African then proceeded to win the US
Open, the Toyota World Matchplay title, the Sarazen World Open, and the
Johnnie Walker World championship.
Els put the opposition and the Emirates Club's 7100-yard course, an
oasis of green amid the desert's drab grey, to the sword with an opening
61, 11 under par. He does not think another such score is likely this
time as the fairways are playing longer and there is more rough
defending them.
All the same, Els will surely be difficult to separate from his title.
He has this month already won the Bell's Cup at home and he is playing
with such confidence that further success may well be his before he
devotes himself full-time to the US Tour.
Talking of his European appearances, Els said: ''I would have liked to
play in the Scottish Open, because I've heard so much about Carnoustie,
but unfortunately I have a Skins Game to play in Austria that week. On
the other hand, I suppose I might have burned myself out there just
before the Open at St Andrews.''
Of course, none of the five others can be discounted, although form so
early in a campaign is difficult to gauge. Price is here for the first
time, Langer has not perfected his swing changes, Couples will be
husbanding his back troubles, and Norman, runner-up by six strokes to
Els, is unpredictable.
Montgomerie does not usually qualify for that description and Europe's
No.1 leads a deputation of 10 Scottish professionals, several of whom
will regard the event as the first to give them the chance to recover
from what were, to put it charitably, disappointing performances from
them last year.
Sam Torrance, for example, declined from fifth to twenty-second on the
order of merit, Gary Orr from thirtieth to fortieth, Gordon Brand Jr
from ninth to twenty-fourth, Paul Lawrie from fifty-seventh to
seventy-sixth, and Stephen McAllister from 102nd to 118th. Mike Miller
and Ross Drummond marked time, whereas Andrew Coltart, from 171st to
forty-second, and Adam Hunter, ninety-seventh to sixty-ninth both
advanced.
The shadow of a European Ryder Cup team place will inevitably cast
across the months between now and the match in the United States in
September. The prospect of making an eighth appearance may re-ignite
Torrance's career, especially since he has settled matters matrimonial
with Suzanne Danielle, who is expecting their third child in June.
Coltart's victories in the Scottish Professional and Australian PGA
championships gave much-needed encouragement to the domestic game which,
with the obvious exception of Montgomerie's achievements, rather
wallowed in the doldrums.
A resurgence all round, led by those best qualified to set an example
-- the professionals -- would be greatly appreciated.

NEWTONMORE face their most important test for years on Saturday when
they face Fort William in a match which could well decide whether or not
they will play in the national shinty league next season.
The Badenoch side desperately need maximum points from the match --
their last in the league -- to put pressure on Lovat and Skye, who could
still overtake them in the race for a top-four spot.
'More's form this season has been erratic, but Fort William come into
the game, which is also crucial to their championship aspirations,
having played only one match since the beginning of December.
In the south, leaders Oban Camanachd should comfortably dispose of
bottom-of-the-table Strachur to further strengthen their claim on the
title.

SCOTLAND'S Euan Henderson followed in the footsteps of Alex Higgins
last night, when he also failed to halt the progress of Thailand's Tai
Pichit to the latter stages of the Embassy World Snooker Championship at
Blackpool.
The former Buddhist monk reached the final qualifying round of the
game's most lucrative event with an impressive 10-6 victory.
Pichit, the only surviving rookie professional, now meets Mike Hallett
today for a place in the 32-man TV phase of the tournament at the
Crucible Theatre, Sheffield, in April.
Henderson established a 5-1 lead, but he managed to win only one more
frame as Pichit mounted a strong fightback. He grew in confidence with
every passing frame and in the fourteenth he fired in a 128 -- his
highest break as a professional.
However, another Scot, 19-year-old John Higgins, kept his hopes of a
Crucible debut alive when he beat beat Birmingham's Jason Wallace 10-7.
It was a bad day for Joe Johnson and Tony Meo, who are suffering hard
times. Johnson, the champion in 1986, was trounced 10-2 by Andy Hicks
while Meo, a former semi-finalist, lost 10-4 to Welshman Anthony Davies.
Results (England unless stated):
D Finbow beat R Hull (Finland) 10-6; A Davies (Wales) beat T Meo 10-4;
B Snaddon (Scotland) beat J Buckingham 10-5; P Francisco (S Africa) beat
A Hamilton 10-6; J Woodman beat I Brumby 10-4; J Higgins (Scotland) beat
J Wallace 10-7; M Davis beat M Williams (Wales) 10-3; R Lawler beat M
Campbell (Scotland) 10-6; T Pichit (Thailand) beat E Henderson
(Scotland) 10-6; A Hicks beat J Johnson 10-2.

John Beattie runs the rule over Scotland's opponents in a tournament
that is the envy of every non-participating rugby country in the world.
ON SATURDAY, in an age when rugby's tentacles spread themselves ever
further, a tournament starts that is the envy of every non-participating
country in the world. It is enough, quite simply, to give people like me
the goose pimples and a reason for living.
The Five Nations' tournament is a competition fought out between five
friendly countries, with no promotion or relegation, and this year sees
the sixty-sixth contest since 1910. The English, bless them, have the
best record with 131 wins in 260 matches, while the Scots have the
poorest, having lost 142 games out of 258.
Despite all that, the record for the most tries scored in a career is
still held by a Scot, Ian Smith, who scored 22 from 1924 to 1931, and
Gavin Hastings is still the highest points scorer with 232, so ya boo
sucks to the rest of them. The highest number of points conceded by
England in their Five Nations history is 33, when they lost to us at
Murrayfield by 33-6 in 1986. I played in that game so ha ha to all the
Nigels and Maurices reading this. Matt Duncan and I still have a wee
chortle every time we get together.
While Scotland take on Canada on their day off, elsewhere the English
travel to Dublin, a place where many men have done things they would
never tell their children, and the Welsh go to play in that nice quiet
wee place, the Parc des Princes.
Last year the world was turned topsy turvy as England were beaten
13-12 by Ireland at Twickenham, and Wales, who fielded the same pack
throughout, ended up on top of the heap thanks to points difference,
leaving behind them the English, the French, the Irish, and then us.
Can Ireland do it again this year against the English, a fixture that
the Irish have now remained undefeated in for three seasons? Ireland
have a devastating front row, with old-stagers Nick Popplewell and Peter
Clohessy as their two props straddling, in the nicest sense, Keith Wood
as hooker.
Clohessy, who was sent off for stamping on a chap named Jamieson, is
alleged to have gone into a pub that night, placed his feet on the bar,
and casually said to the barman: ''I'll have a small Jamieson's please .
. . now!''
Behind them, the electric Simon Geoghegan runs like a demented ferret
on something illegal with ball in hand. He's one of the few wingers in
the world to run through players if he cannot run round them and, to set
it all going, the Irish selectors have opted for Paul Burke at
stand-off, a man who progressed at all age groups for England, but then
opted for Ireland.
Willie Anderson, the lad who spent some time in jail in Argentina for
stealing their flag all those years ago and is some man for silly
post-match games like eating with no cutlery and passing food mouth to
mouth, I can tell you, has resigned as assistant coach. He choked on a
brussels sprout -- only joking.
England looked good against Canada. Received opinion is that they
flattered to deceive, but any team that with a plethora of talent that
includes the likes of Carling, Guscott, Moore, Clarke, and Richards must
be formidable, indeed.
Fitness regimes, styles of play, an ever greater willingness to tour,
and some bloody good players, all have contributed to their success, and
redoubled the efforts of other countries as they became determined to
keep apace and, if possible, beat the English.
Under manager Jack Rowell, and ex-fly half Les Cusworth, the English,
if the Canadian game is to be a pointer, will opt for a more expansive
game. I suspect that England will do rather well this year.
My heart hopes they do badly . . . and my head hopes they will, too.
France, a country of great sophistication, fine wines, good food, and
the kind of soppy accent that makes normally level-headed young women go
weak at the knees, has had a singular ability as a country to produce a
kind of rugby-playing bampot for which they have the patent.
These blokes are usually very big, hairy, and sweaty. They wear
headbands, shinpads, don't shave, own cafes somewhere nondescript in the
South of the country, and kick any part of your body that gets in the
way. They also pull and tug at other more delicate parts of the anatomy,
but we shall not dwell on that.
When you look into their eyes in a game there is absolutely nobody at
home.
Behind these thugs, they have some superb backs. Today the French
field a side that, very much in the scheme of modern teams, has toured
extensively, with recent wins under their belts over the New Zealanders,
South Africa, and Australia.
Winger Emile Ntamack is danger personified, Thierry Lacroix kicks as
well as Grant Fox but a dammed sight quicker, and their back row of
Benazzi, Benetton, and Cabannes is magnificent, indeed.
The French can make our pulses race. To date, they have won 120 of
their 259 games.
Wales will find it hard to dent the French in Paris, despite the
presence of 6ft 10in Derwyn Jones in the second row, Neil Jenkins with
his goal-kicking abilities at fly half, and Robert Jones, that gentleman
of a talented scrum half whose comeback prompted a fit of jealousy from
Frank Sinatra.
We enter the fray on February 4, and, I swear, I cannot wait.
My heart hopes England do badly . . . and my head hopes that they
will, too.

SCOTLAND will be represented for the first time in one of the world's
most arduous endurance events following the success of Dundee sled-dog
musher David Milne in the Copper Basin race in Alaska.
By surviving a nightmare, 300-mile journey which saw four of his
animals sidelined, the 32-year-old former accountant confirmed his place
in the Iditarod, the blue riband event of husky racing.
Milne, who claimed the bronze medal in the Winter Olympic
demonstration sport for Britain three years ago, completed the Copper
Basin event in the pitch dark of the Alaskan night late on Tuesday.
The Iditarod, which begins in March, covers almost 1200 miles, from
Anchorage to Nome on the frozen Bering Sea. It commemorates the epic
journey in 1925 made by relays of husky teams carrying diptheria serum
across the Arctic to relieve an epidemic during the gold rush era. The
annual race, however, which was launched in 1973, is done solo, standing
on the sled behind a team of 16 dogs, with no fresh animals permitted.
''Imagine making a journey one-and-a-half times the length of Britain,
standing all the way, holding on to the rail of a bus and you might just
begin to appreciate what it will be like,'' said Milne.
He had planned to run the Copper Basin race with a team of 12 dogs,
but before the start one of his huskies was involved in a fight,
sustaining puncture wounds in a leg, while another caught kennel cough.
''So I had to start with 10 animals, knowing that if any of them died I
would be debarred from the Iditarod,'' he said.
''I finished with just eight. At one point there was a mass restart on
a frozen lake -- they just paint a line on the ice, and 44 teams,
consisting of more than 500 dogs, go off at once.'' Inevitably, there is
a dog-jam up the trail, so Milne played safe.
''I waited a further 90 minutes to let things clear,'' he said.
''Unfortunately, there was a sick team ahead and all but one of my dogs
caught the infection, suffering diarrhoea and sickness. It was
heartbreaking to watch. I had to nurse them along, chop their salmon
steaks into one-inch cubes with an axe because they were so exhausted
and couldn't chew.
''I retired two of the dogs at check-points. One had to be put on an
intravenous drip. But they are all OK. We were lucky, it was pretty warm
-- the temperature never fell below minus-10 Farenheit.''
Through wasteland outposts with evocative names such as Sourdough,
Wolverine, and Brown Bear, he carried on, finally finishing
thirty-second. ''The terrain was unbelieveable. Ben Nevis is a molehill
by comparison with the mountains here. But the dogs who came through
proved they have it for the Iditarod.''
Milne's parents, Margaret and Charles, back on Tayside, yesterday were
confirming arrangements to take a winter holiday to support their son
during the race.
Meanwhile, Milne is returning to his Alaskan home, official address:
Pawprint Path, Two Rivers, Alaska. There he will prepare his dogs, and
those of Rick Swenson for whom he works. Swenson, currently in the
middle of the Alpirod, a stage dog race in the Alps, will be chasing a
record sixth win in the Iditarod. Milne just hopes to finish, fulfilling
a lifelong dream as he bloods Swenson's team for 1996.

What price coffee now? Jennifer Cunningham investigates the rise and
rise of the world's most popular drink.
MORE coffee is drunk than any other beverage in the world. We drink it
for the caffeine kick first thing in the morning, at work or to jog the
weary senses when tired, but it is the smell and taste which are most
beguiling to the extent that decaffeinated coffees are a small but
significant section of the market.
But how much are we willing to pay for it? Some 90% of the coffee
drunk in the UK is instant and coffee drinkers throughout the country
flinched when market leader Nestle announced an average 7% increase
across its brands. ''We don't respond to fluctuations in the market in
the short term, but over a period of time the effect of the high prices
we have been paying for coffee beans has to be passed on,'' said a
spokesperson.
Two damaging frosts followed by a drought during the vital growing
season in Brazil, still the world's biggest producer, had a devastating
effect on last year's harvest. It is the most dramatic price fluctuation
most coffee traders have ever seen.
Howard Garley, trading partner in the Priory Tea and Coffee Company
and a major importer, cannot recall another double frost. Even before
that natural disaster the price had been squeezed by a group of the
originating countries retaining 20% of their coffee. ''When the price
reached a higher level, they released 10%, then another 10%, but once
that was stabilised, we had the effects of the weather problems.
''In the last couple of weeks a number of localised producers in
Central America have started to retain supplies and we have just heard
that Indonesia, which is a major producer, is going to join them. This
time round, of course, the starting price is higher than it was last
year,'' he said.
Predicting price moves is the essence of all commodity markets, but
the significance of coffee is that it is the world's largest commodity
after oil -- and we are drinking more of it than ever. In the UK alone,
the instant coffee market was worth #610m in 1994, while sales of roast
and ground coffee amounted to 10,300 tonnes -- an increase over the
previous year of 330 tonnes or 54 million cups.
Clive Hay, managing director of Douwe Egberts and chairman of the Real
Coffee Association, expects price increases to slow growth rather than
halt it. The increase in coffee sales was much greater in first half of
the year than the second, he reported. However, he added that a growing
number of people in Britain were demanding better quality coffee.
''In every other country in the world, people drink more roast and
ground coffee, despite the fact that the seventeenth-century coffee
houses were where it first became popular. I think the British taste for
instant coffee was the result of Americans arriving with powdered coffee
after the war years during which people had had to rely on the good old
pot of tea. In other countries with no tea-making tradition they did not
lose the coffee habit, even though they may have had to grind up
hazelnuts as a substitute. The range of coffee-making devices available
for home use has been a big influence on the growth of roast and ground
coffee,'' he said.
Scots have been buying a higher proportion of espresso than people in
other parts of the country, which Clive Hay thinks may be due to the
strength of the Italian community and its cafe tradition here.
He agrees with Simon Clark, manager of Kinnell's House, in Edinburgh,
which claims to have the widest selection of tea and coffee in Scotland,
that most people make their coffee too weak. ''Trust the roaster and
trust what it says on the packet. Instead of going for a dark roast and
then putting in less in case it is too strong for some guests, choose a
medium roast and use the specified amount.''
Mr Hay's current favourite is Kenyan and his advice to beginners is to
go for a good blend, but connoisseurs should keep their eye on the
African countries.
Even for those who do not adopt the Turkish maxim that ''coffee should
be black as hell, strong as death, and sweet as love'', strong coffee
has been a health concern in recent years. However, a report that
drinking more than very modest amounts could increase cholesterol and,
therefore, also the risk of heart disease has more recently been
contradicted by other studies, including one in Dundee which suggested
that people who did not drink coffee had a higher rate of heart disease
than those who drank more than five cups a day.
The Coffee Science Information Centre -- set up by the major players
in the industry -- maintains the high-cholesterol warning applies only
to coffee made in the Scandinavian style by boiling the grounds.
THE 'REAL' THING AT ALL COSTS
* DEMAND for ''real'' coffee in tea and coffee shops as well as
restaurants has led to a number of specialist companies opening outlets
-- sometimes as a chain. How much does a simple cup of coffee cost?
The Costa Coffee chain now has an outlet at every major airport and in
some city centres. They include Glasgow Airport and Central Station,
where filter coffee costs 65p a cup and cappucino 95p.
Massarella is a similar chain operating in department stores and
shopping centres. They have taken over the catering in Fraser's
department store in Glasgow, their only Scottish outlet. They charge 95p
for an espresso, #1 for cafe latte and #1.15 for cappucino.
Kinnells House in Victoria Street Edinburgh, is a Scottish-owned
coffee shop offering the opportunity to taste the tea and coffee they
retail before buying. A two-cup cafetiere costs #1 for a basic blend and
prices increase to #1.30 according to coffee type and whether you want
to add an exotic flavouring such as pecan, macadamia nut or chocolate
spice.
Jenners's Princes Street restaurant charges 70p for a cup of coffee
but does not offer cappucino or cafetieres.
DIG DEEP FOR THE HOT POTATO
* THE price of the humble tattie is also at a record high following an
equally unusual weather pattern at home.A very wet spring followed by a
summer of drought dimensions in some areas decimated last year's potato
yield, particularly on the east coast of England.
Expensive baking varieties are now 40p per lb in some supermarkets,
almost double last year's price, but even the usual household names cost
between 16p and 33p a lb compared with 6p to 33p a lb last year.
The poor growing conditions resulted in smaller than normal potatoes
so the big ones favoured by chip shops and caterers are at a premium,
leading to predictions of a price-war among chippies.
Arthur Parrington, secretary of the National Federation of Fish
Friers, said some of his members were having to pay three times the
normal amount for their potatoes. ''In a very competitive market, chip
shop owners are reducing their profits or dishing up smaller portions
rather than pass on the increase, but it is not good news for chip shops
or their customers.''

Catherine Brown conjures up three almost instant feasts, cleverly
combining fresh ingredients with store cupboard staples
CREAMY BEANS WITH BACON AND MUSTARD
4 servings.
Preparation time 3-4 minutes.
Cooking time 5-6 minutes.
Use either tinned butter beans or a selection of beans to make a quick
stew with bacon and a creamy mustard sauce. Serve over a round of hot
buttered toast.
Ingredients:
2 tablespoons oil
8 slices smoked bacon, diced
2 large tomatoes
1 bunch spring onions, chopped finely
2 x 14oz (400g) tins butter beans or other beans
3-4 tablespoons double, whipping or single cream
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
salt and pepper
4-8 slices hot buttered toast
2 tablespoons grated cheddar cheese
Method: Heat the oil in a frying pan and add the bacon. Cook until
crisp. Push to the side of the pan.
Halve tomatoes and sear cut surface in bacon fat until browned. Remove
from the pan and put on to the serving plates.
Remove pan from the heat and add the spring onions.
Open the tins of beans, drain in a sieve and rinse under cold water.
Put into the pan with the bacon.
Heat through and add cream and mustard. Season to taste.
Make toast, butter and put on plate with tomatoes. Pour beans over
toast, sprinkle with grated cheese, and serve.
BAKED EGGS WITH PESTO TOASTS
1 serving.
Preparation time 5 minutes.
Cooking time 7-10 minutes (3-4 in microwave).
Use this simple method of cooking eggs and elaborate it into a full
meal with cheese, tomatoes and fresh coriander baked with the eggs.
Serve with hot toast spread with pesto.
Ingredients:
1 medium sized tomato
2 tablespoons finely grated mature cheddar cheese
2 tablespoons cream or milk
1 tablespoon scissor-chopped fresh coriander
1-2 fresh eggs
salt and freshly ground white pepper
2 slices crusty white bread
2 teaspoons pesto
Method: Preheat the oven to 190C (375F/gas 5). Grease a small
earthenware dish, one-portion pie dish or large ramekin with butter.
Boil a kettle of water and pour boiling water over tomato. Leave for
18-20 seconds. Remove and skin.
Meanwhile, grate cheese into the base of dish and add a tablespoon of
cream or milk.
Dice tomatoes finely, mix with coriander and scatter over cheese.
Make a well for the egg/s and break on top of cheese and tomatoes.
Pour over second tablespoon of cream or milk and season with salt and
pepper.
If cooking in a convection oven, place the dish in a tray of boiling
water to come two-thirds of the way up the side. Bake for 7-10 minutes.
The time will depend on the size of the dish and the depth of the
mixture. The yolks should be just set.
If cooking in a microwave, heat the dish on high for 30 seconds before
you add the ingredients. Prick the yolk membrane with a pin or cocktail
stick to prevent it exploding. Microwave on medium (50%) for 2-3
minutes. Test and return for another minute until the egg/s are set.
A few minutes before the eggs are ready, make the toast. Spread with
pesto, cut into fingers and serve with the eggs.
CHICKEN COLLOPS IN OATMEAL
2 servings.
Preparation time 5 minutes.
Cooking time 7-10 minutes.
Bone out the meat from chicken thighs and make into thin collops which
can be fried quickly. Serve with tiny boiled new potatoes tossed in
butter and herbs.
Ingredients:
1lb (500g) baby new potatoes
4 chicken thighs
2 tablespoons medium oatmeal
salt and pepper
2 tablespoons oil for frying
herbs: parsley, tarragon, coriander, chives, thyme
1oz (25g) butter
Method: Wash potatoes and put into a pan of boiling salted water.
Cover and boil until soft.
With a sharp knife, remove the meat from the chicken and lay out flat
on a chopping board, flesh side up. Using a rolling pin or meat bat,
flatten out to roughly the same thickness, leaving the skin on.
Mix the oatmeal with salt and pepper and coat the meat on all sides.
Heat the oil in a frying pan and cook the chicken on both sides until
crisp and brown.
Drain the potatoes, toss in butter and add herbs. Serve with the
chicken.

THE Sir Alexander Gibson Memorial associate conductorship, launched
yesterday by The Herald, is likely to find itself inundated with
applications, according to the Association of British Orchestras.
A spokesperson for the ABO, the organisation which represents the
interests of all major orchestras in the UK, said that the post with the
Royal Scottish National Orchestra, which will be created to preserve the
name and memory of Sir Alex, who died last weekend, will generate
enormous interest throughout Britain, and a very high demand.
''There are so few opportunities in Britain for young conductors, and
it is so hard to get on to that first rung on the ladder,'' said Sarah
Gee, membership and services manager of the ABO, ''that everyone is
going to come out of the woodwork for this one. The orchestra will
probably be inundated with applications.''
So what happens next? Initially, Paul Hughes, chief executive of the
Royal SNO, will be discussing the post with the orchestra's Viennese
principal conductor and music director, Walter Weller.
''Then we'll be sitting down to find a format,'' said Hughes. Basic
issues will be discussed, he revealed, including how appropriate
candidates for the post will be found, whether the post will be open to
invitation, audition, or competition, and would a one or two-year period
of tenure be more valuable.
There is at present no standard format, as the nature of the post will
be relatively unusual. There are many associate or affiliate conductor
posts with British orchestras, but these are usually held by a composer,
part of whose remit is to provide new work for the orchestra.
The Scottish Chamber Orchestra, with its composer/conductor posts held
by Sir Peter Maxwell Davies and James MacMillan, or Simon Rattle's City
of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, where a similar post was held by Mark
Anthony Turnage, are examples of this.
The Royal SNO Gibson memorial post will be different in that it will
be a pure conducting post, designed to give a young, talented conductor
a solid basis in craftsmanship.
The progress of the project, as it develops, will be reported
regularly on The Herald arts and feature pages. Watch this space.

EVEN the ticket clerk at the train station was at it. Selling two
fares on the trot to the same strange destination was too much. ''What
is this?'' he cried. ''Everybody's going to Paisley. They must be giving
away bananas free.''
If he'd known the expedition was to watch St Mirren play football, his
mirth would have been unrestrained.
One cruel jest from last season concerns aeroplanes out of Abbotsinch
which fly over the Love Street sward where the wee Mirren play.
According to this barbed whimsy, passengers on the friendlier airlines
are invited to close the curtains so they don't see the Saints.
This season's insults have been more down to earth.
Bleak weekend statistics showed that Saints had not scored a goal in
the new year. Who was counting? But they had not bulged the onion bag
since the Boxing Day game. Now was a time for all Buddies of the
dispersal -- yea, even unto banging out on railway tickets -- to come to
their aid. Agreed that football takes up too much space. The world has
worse problems. But we are not talking football here. We are talking
about St Mirren against Dunfermline Athletic. We are talking survival.
For their coastal defences the Saints, three times Cup-winners among
other honours, have only Ayr United and Stranraer keeping them from a
cold dive into the dark waters of relegation. They could march out.
And strolling down Love Street has also changed from of yore. Once it
was a thronged thoroughfare. But Saturday could have been a Paisley flag
day. The match felt off, or I'd got the date wrong.
At the ground a splendid pleasuredome of a modern stand is nearly
completed. What caught the eye, though, was how a cluster of new houses
nearby have been sited so their windows have no view of the stricken
field.
To dwell further on days of yore, it was a blessed accident of
geography that made Paisley's sporting life. To the north the land was
flat. It became the town's playground. Away from the reek of industry
the fresh air started at the Fountain Gardens, a gift from the Coats
thread family. Farther out was the racecourse. St Mirren settled
in-between.
While grateful for the great moments they have given their town, it
was hard in the gardens not to notice that even the fountain, never mind
the team, has not been playing recently.
More rural memories came to mind. When the football club first put up
goalposts, its canny committeemen noticed the town slaughterhouse was
just over the wall. They rented their new ground for sheep to graze on,
charging #5 a year ''on condition that the sheep be removed from the
field during all matches''.
And inside the boundary walls was retained a country cottage. John
Patrick, the Mirren goalie who played for the Scotland team that beat
the Saxons in 1897 at Crystal Palace, lived in it to be near his work.
During the first half such bucolic musings helped keep the mind
otherwise occupied. Dunfermline, called the Pars, short for paralytic,
were refusing to live up to their nickname. By the interval they were
2-1 ahead. Their brace came from the towering Stewart Petrie. Running,
jumping, or standing still, he seemed likely to win the game whenever he
wanted to.
In the sensible way of Paisley thrift it was resolved to get back the
train fare by refraining from buying any Sunday papers. Two of them at
least were sure to jeer with headings along the lines of SAINTS
PETRIFIED.
In an aromatic ethos of Paisley pies the interval was improved by the
thought that the decline of the ball game which the back-page lads keep
on about started when even sedate and sensible clubs couldn't keep their
mitts off their colours.
Wearing one black sleeve and one white, St Mirren appeared dressed as
for a pierrot show, while Dunfermline favoured beachwear. A kind of
heliotrope and lettuce green creation, if memory serves.
As things turned out, memory had to be wiped. A first half that had
been committed to the tablets as being as enthusing as watching a fire
go out in the grate suddenly ignited.
Grant Inglis, a fresh arrival from the soccer academy of Shotts Bon
Accord, danced upfield, his tiny feet hardly touching the ground, to
score an equaliser. He thereby capped St Mirren's opener by young Stuart
Taylor, his first for the club, that a grudging morning paper observer
later described as ''scrambled''. What does he know? Scrambled takes
magic. Has that scribe tried eggs?
So, it's a promise, their 2-2 triumph means St Mirren can be excused
from appearing here in plain black and white for a while. I have done my
bit by attending in their hour and a half of need. As managers like to
say, the lads can be left to get on with it. It's St Johnstone this week
and Celtic in the Cup on the Saturday after. No problems there now, of
course not.

Veteran drummer Mike Travis has a winning musical formula in EH15, as
Rob Adams reports Travis beats out tour trail
IDON'T like talking about the past,'' says drummer Mike Travis. ''I
prefer to move on.'' Engage him on that very subject, however, and it
becomes clear that the real reason he doesn't like talking about his
past is: it takes so long.
The programme for the Big Picnic described Travis as vastly
experienced. It didn't lie. To back it up he has a whole catalogue of
anecdotes.
Like the time when, as a callow 17-year-old during an Edinburgh
Festival-time jam session, Travis suggested to the late, lamented alto
saxophonist Joe Harriott that they play something up-tempo. The facial
expression leaves no doubt that come-uppance was received -- big time.
''The number collapsed into a shambles within a few bars,'' says Travis,
recalling this salutary lesson with a guffaw.
Travis's wide-ranging career began as a guitarist. With school chums
he formed a skiffle group. They were well into the first verse of a
Lonnie Donegan-styled It Takes A Worried Man when they realised they had
great rhythm -- but knew no chords.
Travis stuck with the rhythm and got some drums. It was a major figure
from the 1960s folk scene, guitarist Davy Graham, who gave Travis a
musical vision that lives on in his band EH15 -- which begins a
five-date tour of Scotland on Sunday. He introduced Travis to records by
jazz trumpeter Clifford Brown, Indian sitar player Ravi Shankar, then
blues legend Big Bill Broonzy. When the pair later played gigs, the
mixture would be just as eclectic. Travis says: ''He taught me to listen
to everything.''
Having established himself in Edinburgh, Travis felt the traditional
Scottish urge to prove himself in London. He got a day job to support
himself and looked around for drumming work.
He played in the original Hair band with Alex Harvey and took on a
residency at an after-theatre club with singer Jon Hendricks (of
Lambert, Hendricks and Ross fame) which proved a magnet for American
musicians passing through -- guitarist Kenny Burrell and Crusaders
pianist Joe Sample being among the many who sat in.
Through working with ex-Soft Machine bassist Hugh Hopper, Travis got
the call from Japanese percussionist Stomu Yamashta, a visually-stunning
performer who would arrive on stage in full Samurai garb. While working
with Yamashta, Travis saw the way the music business was going and
didn't like it. 'We were playing Liverpool University and the congener
said: ''That was quite good but next week we've got Slade!
Shortly afterwards, feeling that he wasn't progressing and doubtful
about having his two children grow up in South East London, Travis and
his wife moved back to Edinburgh.
After 14 years all his contacts had disappeared and, starting from
scratch, he played in clubs backing comedians and country singers,
obtained some jazz gigs with visiting soloists such as saxophonist James
Moody and trumpeter Art Farmer, and took up acting -- spending three
years with Wildcat Theatre Group.
Aside from working with Savourna Stevenson, the Cauld Blast Orchestra
and Clan Alba, he has always had his own bands and is fully aware of the
perception of drummers' bands being vehicles for lots of drum solos.
This is patently not the case with EH15, where Travis is uneasy with
his role as nominal leader. ''It's a co-operative band. Writers bring in
raw ideas and we all work on the arrangements.
''But someone has to organise things, and drummers -- since we have to
organise ourselves getting from A to B -- tend to be the organisers.''
The band's current line-up has developed the original pot-pourri of
jazz, rock, Spanish, Latin American and North African influences
featured on their 1991 album, The View from Where, to a stage where, on
the strength of the last two gigs I've heard, the forthcoming dates come
into the not-to-be-missed category.
Travis said: ''All we ask is that people leave their jazz baggage at
home and come with open ears. We think they'll be pleasantly
surprised.''
* EH15 play the City Hall Bar, Glasgow on Sunday January 22; Volunteer
Hall, Galashiels, Wednesday 25; Lemon Tree, Aberdeen, 26; MacRobert Arts
Centre, Stirling, 27; and Music Box, Edinburgh, 30.

NOW that King James IV's No 5 iron (alleged) has found a buyer in the
form of Gordon Smith, an Oregon senator, what chances of His Majesty's
entire set, golf bag, and motorised buggy turning up on the memorabilia
market? Promising, according to Dick Durran, editor of the British Golf
Collectors Society magazine. He has views about the amount of golfing
memorabilia on the market.
It was Durran who first raised questions over the provenance of the
King Jim club which an American golf magazine reported had been sold for
$1.25m. The vendor was Bob Pringle, the Troon dealer in memorabilia. It
turned out that the deal had not been done after all. But Smith might
still buy it and believes the club is genuine . . . left behind by the
king on a golfing spree to Banff and Buchan circa 1504. We know it was
the king's because he had R stamped on it for Rex. Everyone else seems
to think the club is seventeenth century. No matter.
Durran has since cautiously observed: ''I have a view that there are a
lot of old clubs surfacing. And they seem to be surfacing all over the
place. If you were an expert you might begin to wonder if there was
someone knocking these out.''
The difficulty, as Bob Gowling, the acknowledged club expert in this
country, has noted, is that there is no sure method of dating old iron
heads. Which is why Gowling, an auctioneer with Phillips in Chester and
one of the best makers of replica golf clubs in the land, can only hope
his clubs do not end up in the salerooms to be mistaken for the real
thing by US senators. The sensible thing would be to stamp a B for Bob
on the back. Or even an R for Robert. Or Rex?
He should come clean
IT is all very well Mr Stronach, the Prince of Wales's erstwhile
valet, telling us he had to remove grass and earth stains from HRH's jim
jams following royal assignations in the undergrowth. But what he has
failed to disclose is how he did it.
There is an entire world of shrubbery-creeping gentry padding about
the bushes with other people's wives which would tip handsomely to know
how Stronach dealt with the telltale signs of midnight infidelity: Stain
Devils? Persil micro bio? Or that stuff Danny Baker advertises on telly?
Has Stronach ever considered a career in TV soap commercials?
Far and near
THE Cyclist Touring Club magazine sends its correspondents to the ends
of the earth in search of detailed information of inner-tube stockists
and useful watering holes. This month: Mongolia and Grampian.
Keeping track
STRANGE but true: Since there are no trams to preserve in Aberdeen --
they were burnt at a free public bonfire by the cooncil in 1958 -- the
only other thing left to preserve is tramlines. An early coup in the
existence of the Aberdeen Tramway Preservation Society has been the
acquisition of a 2ft length of rail discovered in the city's West End.
This burnished icon may now be inspected, by prior arrangement, at the
home of the society's hon sec W A Brown Esq. Those who know about such
things, and they are legion, incline to the view that while this is
indeed a desirable artefact nothing can transcend the joy of a trip to
Old Renfrew Road, Glasgow, for a glimpse of the longest remaining
stretch of double tramtrack in the UK. Tell your children and children's
children.

Seeing stars
DIARY readers, mindful of our long-running series Great Christmas
Presents of 1994, may recall that the Science Museum's mail-order home
planetarium (#29) made an immediate impression by arriving complete with
instructions in French. The replacement instructions have now been
forwarded and are written in American.
The machine, it transpires, is best suited to a white-walled room
6X6X6ft; an unusual size for any room, as the instructions concede. But
. . . ''that is alright because your incredible brain will soon be
making the necessary mental adjustments to keep the projected stars in
proper scale.''
Wrong. The incredible brain has given up trying to fit itself and
three children into a downstairs lavatory and taken instead to composing
a facetious letter of complaint about Uranus and asking for its money
back.
Liberty or death
OUR old friend Keith Schellenberg (you may yawn), aka ''controversial
laird of the Isle of Eigg'', is currently under sentence of death from
the Scottish National Liberation Army.
Schellenberg is said to be far less concerned about the telephoned
threat than the fact he has had to share it with Highland Regional
Councillor Dr Michael Foxley, who appears to have been threatened almost
in the same breath by the SNLA.
Foxley has the misfortune to represent Eigg, among other outlandish
places, on HRC and is not an obvious Schellenberg fan any more than
Schellenberg is of Foxley. The only thing the pair seem to have in
common is that they were both born in England.
If anyone can be seen attempting to free Eiggers from the yoke of
slavery by offering them free rubbish collections and chairmanship of
public utilities, or whatever it is they want, then surely it is the
unstinting Dr Foxley, champion of the Gaelic language and land reform.
But no. The SNLA has determined he shall perish alongside
Schellenberg. Someone should sue someone immediately.

The letter from Ian Cowan proves yet again that the urban population
has a very hazy idea of farming in general and meat production in
particular (January 11).
Meat cannot be produced for local consumption because animals for this
purpose must, by law, be killed in a slaughterhouse. Many such places
were closed because of the cost of complying with EU regulations.
There is now none in mainland Argyll so all sheep and cattle have to
be transported to places such as Bathgate. This means travel by lorry,
but most drivers do their best to ensure that their load arives in good
condition.
The demand for meat continues throughout the year, but growth of grass
ceases between October and March. Therefore animals being fattened for
slaughter have to be housed and given extra feeding, much of which is
produced on the farm.
Most farmers are proud of their livestock and look after them by
providing housing, bedding, and food and water in such a way that the
animals live more comfortable lives than millions of people throughout
the world.
Scotland has every reason to be proud of its stockmen, who so often
produce the champions at Smithfield.
Mr Cowan and his friends should not feel guilty about eating meat
produced in Scotland, even if it has had to be transported live from
Kintyre and other far-flung places.

As protest is made at sending calves across the Channel and to
possible cruelty, thought might also now be spared to animals which may
not accompany their owners going overseas but must languish in pet
homes.
It is legal to take one's dog abroad, but not to return from other
members of the European Union unless through lengthy quarantine.
Dog owners on the Continent have long ago come to terms with rabies,
especially through inoculation against this and other infections.
Denmark had requirements for quarantine until circumstances forced their
abandonment. Cases of canine rabies were reported recently as nil.
Barriers may therefore be lowered with minimised risks, and pets
accorded such freedoms in Europe. Let animals and animal lovers unite.

Your claim that our children should fear spending their lives in toil
in order to support a ''swelling band of elderly welfare recipients'' is
both offensive and spurious (January 10).
In fact, over this century the relative proportion of older people has
already greatly increased. In 1900 for every 10 people of working age
there was one person over pension age. Today the ratio is 3.3 to one.
Yet during this period state support for older people has also greatly
increased.
Over the past 20 years, Britain's welfare spending has remained a
stable share of GDP: it has been estimated that even if benefits were to
keep pace with general living standards (which they currently do not)
the net effect of an ageing population over the next 50 years would add
up to only 5% of GDP.
This is less than the increase attributable to the last recession.
Older people also contribute to society and the economy in a number of
important ways including providing unpaid care, as voluntary workers,
and as payers of direct and indirect taxation.
It is depressing to see how far rhetoric has become accepted as
''unassailable truth''.

KELLY Girls should take note of the first show in the Tron's spring
programme Temporary Girl, which opens on Wednesday January 25. A
one-woman piece by New Yorker Lisa Kotin, it wickedly satirises the
trials and tribulations involved in temp work, from being ignored during
the coffee rounds to spending the day sharpening pencils. (Been, there.
Done that.)
Kotin has previously performed Temporary Girl at the Edinburgh
Festival in 1992, but the version at the Tron is an updated development
-- complemented by additional quirky film footage which interrupts the
on-stage action.
Filming these clips proved as much as a challenge as the
facing-a-day-at-the-new-office scenarios Kotin enacts. For one dream
sequence -- which should strike a note of recognition with every bored
office worker -- she filmed a person dressed up as a giant Hershey bar
and was promptly ejected from Santa's Village Amusement Park --
incurring the wrath of the jolly fellow himself who had an exclusive
contract with Mars confectionery.
Employment agencies have also not been amused by Kotin. While she was
filming an office Christmas party scene in a temp agency, the penny
finally dropped with the office manager who started screaming at Kotin
about how inappropriate her depiction of a domineering ''power boss''
was. Temp workers everywhere will however recognise more than a few home
truths.
Choice comment
* LAST Thursday's public meeting at Glasgow University for the Options
for a National Gallery of Scotland in Glasgow was a relatively-quiet but
instructive affair; the subject excites considerable activity in the
letters pages of this paper, but only about 150 people appeared to tip
in their penny ha'p'orth.
This, opined Janey Buchan, first to spring to her feet when the
meeting was thrown open, was because of the venue chosen for the
meeting. Folk from Easterhouse and Drumchapel were conspicuous by their
absence she reckoned because they had been intimidated by the austere
setting of the University's Bute Hall. She then argued that the proposed
gallery should be sited amidst such housing schemes.
Not so, contradicted Chares Scott (representing the Glasgow branch of
the Saltire Society), a city centre site was essential for accessibility
for out-of-town visitors.
Paul Scott (no relation) -- representing the Edinburgh branch of the
Saltire Society, and introduced with amusing understatement by the
chair, Sir William Kerr Fraser, principal of Glasgow University, as ''a
noted correspondent in the press'' -- had other ideas. In a
don't-take-Muhammed-to-the-mountain,-take-the-mountain-to-Muhammed way,
he poured scorn on the notion of a National Gallery in Glasgow and
seemed to urge a mobile kind of national collection, travelling around
the country and popping into towns like Kilmarnock and Inverness.
Things were heating up nicely, with speakers such as George Wyllie,
Julian Spalding and Pat Lally, becoming increasingly vocal as they
competed with the hearty contributions from a squalling babe-in-arms.
On the platform, Timothy Clifford spent most of the meeting
apologising. First, for an ''awful cold'', illiciting the uncharitable
comment, ''what about the awful accent,'' from an
unrepresentatively-loutish member of the public.
Then he was forced to eat humble pie when Timothy Hobbs, from Glasgow
University Library, took issue with a line, penned by Clifford in the
glossy Options brochure; ''Nowhere in Scotland is there a definite
collection of portaits, studies for sets, costume designs, costumes,
architectural projects for theatres, play-bills, posters, programmes and
all the personalia and memorabilia associated with the stage.''
''A bit ironic when the Scottish Theatre Archive is only a few hundred
yards from this building,'' huffed Hobbs. ''It was a literal -- I meant
definitive,'' pleaded Clifford in self-mitigation.
The most astonishing aspect of the evening was an
uncharacteristically-silent appearance from Ricky Demarco, while the
most entertaining line came from Sir William. Illustrating the
psychological divide between Edinburgh and Glasgow, he recalled urgent
entreaties from Edinburgh friends on hearing of his move to Glasgow:
''We must see you before you go.''
Comic fantasy
PHIL Kay has a dream. The Scottish stand-up comic, not content with
conquering the comedy circuit, wants to triumph in the business world.
Apparently Kay nurtures entrepreneurial aspriations and hopes to open an
entertainment emporium in Glasgow.
Having announced his ambition to open a comedy club, Kay has been
warned off the venture by many, including the Guilded Balloon's Karen
Koren, who have learnt how fickle comedy audiences can be. Kay is
undeterred however and envisions a venue which provides more than just a
chuckle, encompassing fast food, bars, a cinema and performance area,
and intriguing little extras, like a car-hire facilitiy.
Unfortunately, the venue is, as yet, no more than a blueprint in Kay's
head. Success has opened many doors to him but those of financial
institutions have so far been firmly closed in his face.
He might be convinced of the market potential of his concept, but a
clutch of unimaginative bank managers have so far found it difficult to
take Kay -- recently voted British Stand-up Comedian of the Year --
seriously. An unfortunate occupational hazard, methinks.

One morning at 8.30 I was in my bath when I realised that the
indigestion I thought I had was now the early stages of a heart attack.
I asked my wife to call our doctor and then call for an ambulance. The
doctor arrived in four minutes followed by the ambulance about four
minutes later.
I was surprised when my doctor, every inch a professional and in the
process of easing my pain with medication, suggested to the paramedics
that they take over.
They then relayed an ECG direct through to Hairmyres Hospital and I
was in bed in the coronary care unit within 20 minutes.
Now I am on the road to recovery. I'm lucky to be alive but only
through the competence of the National Health Service team.
The dedication and willingness of the professionals and staff was
really impressive. Building this team to provide health care for
everyone must be one of our finest achievements this century.
Please let us keep this team together before donning the privatisation
blindfold. Health is wealth for all.

I would like to point out to Keith Sinclair that a statement in his
report (Iona pilgrims told ''Christ was homosexual'', January 7) is
incorrect.
He states, ''Saint Columba, who brought Christianity to Scotland in
the sixth century . . .'', but 150 years before Columba arrived in Iona
from Ireland, in AD 563, Saint Ninian established his monastery at
Whithorn, Wigtownshire, circa AD 400.
The site at Whithorn became an important church-cathedral and a
settlement for missionaries and scholars. As they always have been,
pilgrims are welcome there most days of the year.

In events this May and August to mark the end of hostilities on the
anniversaries of VE-Day and VJ-Day respectively, Germany is to be
invited to participate, presumably Italy as well, on VE-Day, but come
VJ-Day Japan is to be cold-shouldered, ignored.
Why?
Is it because the sins of the Japanese in the Second World War are
adjudged more heinous than those of Germany or is it because the whole
business is being contrived to induce in everyone a ''feel-good''
factor, a feeling of righteousness? Hypocrisy, thy name is Britain, once
Great!
The Government is behaving as one looking back on an immaculate past
-- a past in which we carved out a great empire across three-quarters of
the world, with fire and brimstone wherever and whenever the situation
demanded it. Our behaviour does not invite close scrutiny.
This whole marking of the end of hostilities in Europe and the East,
this resurrection of a bloody past, however muted the undertones of
triumph when victor and vanquished appear on the same podium, is quite
likely to have the opposite effect to that intended. Were I a German, or
Italian -- or a Japanese -- in May or August what I would be saying in
public and thinking in private would probably be two very different
things.
I have visited Belsen and I have visited a ''death camp'' (Tonchin
South) on the River Kwai -- and afterwards visited Hiroshima (and
Nagasaki) and saw there all I needed to let me know that the account had
been squared, the books balanced.
Insist otherwise, and the ghost of the Second World War will not be
laid.

A PETITE, lithe package of attitude, Angelique Kidjo is Benin's best
known export, and may be making a significant contribution to the small
African state's balance of payments for all I know. She surely enlivened
an Edinburgh audience that was desperate to throw its natural reserve
away and leap to its feet at her command.
Unfortunately the command came immediately before a slower tune -- the
title track of her second (and best) album Logozo -- but that didn't
stop the most determined of the punters who had already gathered in a
swaying huddle at the foot of one aisle.
From then it was but a matter of time (some distance from which some
of us were already clapping) before the whole house was on its feet
giving it self-conscious shape-throwing or reckless abandon according to
taste.
It is, to be honest, impossible to resist the charm of the ebullient
Ms Kidjo. Her every utterance, including a completely incomprehensible
plea for global tolerance, was greeted with cheers.
So why was I left disappointed? Partly because the sound was initially
pretty ropy and the keyboard substitute for a real horn section was
unsatisfactory.
Partly because the band -- two fellow Africans, three Frenchmen, and a
very eye-catching duo of West Indian backing vocalists in seventies garb
doing Supremes routines -- sounded a little too flat and unspontaneous
for the music.
And partly because I remembered the first time I saw her, at the Paris
Africa club in Glasgow's Tramway, when the party seemed to spring
unformed into our midst rather than being so earnestly wished for. But
then, maybe nothing's ever as good as the first time.

JIM SUTHERLAND'S Somotherland made its debut at the Edinburgh Folk
Festival last Easter, an occasion this gig in the Strathclyde Suite
easily eclipsed. The months in between have not exactly been stuffed
with gigs (par for the course for an 11-piece band) but they have used
the time well.
There's been a general tightening up, making the character of each
tune much more defined and bringing out their many different influences
and moods. They opened with Flick It Up and Catch It, which spreads a
rustic fiddle melody over an invigorating African beat, and followed
that with the darkly minimalist Left Over Man with Phil Bancroft playing
the first in a series of concise, rich-toned tenor saxophone solos.
Their trump card is the various groups within a group they have, not
least the trio of Simon Thoumire (concertina), Simon Bradley (fiddle),
and Sutherland himself on bodhran which started off the leader's zippy
Linguist. A favourite from his Easy Club days, it rattled along smartly,
Sutherland extracting rhythms from the hand drum which many drummers
would struggle to achieve with all four limbs.
Support Melanie O'Reilly unveiled her new Irish-Latin-Jazz direction,
an angst-laden foray summed up by Along the Dublin Road, a kind of Irish
Route 66 without the kicks. She has the germ of an idea here and got
good support from David Milligan, a pianist with an impressively bright,
springy touch, and trumpeter Colin Steele playing at his most focused.
But a little more humility, a good deal less Celtic navel-gazing, and a
lot of hard work on her presentation are required.

AND it was decreed that nation shall lilt with melodious sensitivity
unto nation, pals' hands extending across the Atlantic, while the
Perthshire bagpipe lay down in (relative) peace with the pedal steel
guitar from Nashville. And, rather thrillingly, that's how last night
turned out in a triumph of cross-pollination.
Dougie went first, mixing shambolic self-deprecation with winsome
Celtic doominess. Is Dougie the closest thing Scotland has to James
Taylor, in terms of crafting lightly poetic songs which plainly
articulate common hopes and fears, and if so, is this a good thing?
Dang m'porage, it is -- even though I don't like James Taylor. Yet
Dougie should guard against what might be described as non-specific New
Age dreichness: an automatic tendency to venerate Scotland's old ways
over its new.
He does, however, have a solid new song lamenting Scotland's
unthinking readiness to view itself through cosy, tartan-tinted
spectacles.
Having joined Dougie on a couple of his first-half songs, Kathy was
well warmed up for her own set with her lithe seven-piece combo.
On record, Kathy Mattea is the epitome of Nashville country
professionalism, marrying measured vocal expertise to songs of social
concern and emotional maturity, but then deadening things somewhat with
a mid-tempo blandness.
On stage, though, it's a total treat. Not least because Kathy Mattea
is utterly charming, completely disarming, and very funny. And she can
surely sing.
Nobody's Gonna Rain on Our Parade was revealed as an airbrushed gem of
all-American pop. Just like 18 Wheels and a Dozen Roses. Where've You
Been made me sob.
A new Mattea-MacLean song, unveiled in a duet, was dandy, too. So if
Dougie MacLean is Scotland's James Taylor, to whom can we compare Kathy
Mattea? No-one. She's her ain woman, and happily ours too.

IN case anyone was in any doubt as to the musicianly qualities of
Carol Laula's band, its set began with a drum duo -- yes, two drum kits,
two drummers, and two drum solos rolled into one, a crime previously
only committed by Genesis and possibly in a former era by Emerson, Lake,
and Palmer.
Fortunately, the bass solo is saved until the second song, and that
most unpromising of intros is of restricted duration, making way for
Raincloud Court, one of Laula's more engaging compositions and a fine
platform for her soaring voice.
The over-cluttered start to the set, which also included the first
cameo by Fraser Speirs, did, however, serve immediate notice that this
was no longer the bare-footed, sensitive, folky side of Laula mainly
seen over the past few years but a more gutsy and interesting version.
Stylistically, however, the show never really settled into a groove,
with the pot-pourri of songs on offer seeming to stretch the writing to
its limits, although there were some notable triumphs.
Older songs like Bad Case of You and the sprightly Without You are
based round simple blues riffs, while Close Your Eyes and one of the two
new songs on offer were only a pedal steel or mandolin part away from
the type of country-tinged pop that has pushed Sheryl Crow to the top of
the charts on both sides of the Atlantic.
It makes the stateside interest in her work all the more explicable,
but the most memorable moments from last night's sold-out and hugely
appreciated homecoming show were the two simplest and lyrically
strongest songs: Silent Watching Daughter and Ode to Bob, on which
Speirs played blues harp beautifully.
Much of what surrounds them is ordinary, middle-of-the-road pop like
Tragedy Waltz and Don't Wanna Be, rarely sparkling but enthused with
enough hooks to endear it.
It makes for a mixed show as Laula's songwriting is not always strong
enough to show her voice to its best advantage, the musicianship often
too cluttered to bring out the best in the melodies, but on the
occasions when voice, song, and band come together, as they seem to do
often, Laula's talent is self-evident, geared towards greater commercial
reward.

A WOMAN died four days after being discharged from hospital for the
second time in less than a week. Yesterday, Mrs Sheila Lawrie's
treatment was criticised by Sheriff John McInnes, who said there had
been a series of failures to recognise the seriousness of her symptoms.
Mrs Lawrie, 66, of Scotland Terrace, Newburgh, Fife, had a gallstone
operation in Perth Royal Infirmary on December 16, 1993.
She was discharged on Christmas Eve but re-admitted the next day
because of the concern of a district nurse and GP who visited her. She
was discharged again on December 30. She died on January 4.
Following a fatal accident inquiry at Perth, Sheriff McInnes found her
death was due to a pulmonary embolism and thrombosis which he said were
well recognised complications following surgery.
He pointed out that, on December 22, relatives had expressed concern
about Mrs Lawrie's health to nurses and to Dr John MacIntyre, the
consultant surgeon who operated on her. The sheriff said the doctor
replied it had been a straightforward operation and Mrs Lawrie would be
discharged on December 24.
The sheriff added: ''Her discharges on both December 24 and 30 were
premature. On each occasion, she was suffering from marked
breathlessness, as the medical and nursing notes recorded and as Mrs
Lawrie and her relatives had informed medical and nursing staff.
''The cause of her breathlessness had not been diagnosed nor had it
been treated prior to either discharge.''
Sheriff McInnes said the doctors dealing with Mrs Lawrie should have
taken steps to exclude pulmonary embolism as a cause of her
breathlessness.
He commented: ''Mrs Lawrie's death may well have been caused or at
least contributed to as a result of the failure at Perth Royal Infirmary
to diagnose the condition from which she was suffering, which condition
caused her death. It is not possible with certainty to say she would not
have died had proper diagnosis and treatment taken place.''
The sheriff concluded: ''There also appears to have been a succession
of failures to take steps which prudent medical staff could be expected
to have taken to exclude the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Had proper
steps been taken to that end, it is unlikely she would have been
discharged on either December 24 or 30.''
A spokesman for Tayside Health Board said: ''The board and the Perth
and Kinross Healthcare NHS Trust are studying the terms of the sheriff's
determination closely and will be giving urgent consideration to what
action may need to be taken in the light of his comments.''

Penny Lewis attempts to perpetuate the myth that ''the Japanese were
ready to surrender'' when the first atomic bomb was dropped (January
14).
In fact the Japanese War Council was meeting on August 9, 1945 when
the second bomb was dropped. For surrender were the Prime Minister, the
Foreign Minister, and three generals. For continuation of the war were
the War Minister and three generals. Impasse.
The Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister saw Hirohito secretly and
persuaded him to call another meeting and preside at it. He did so, and
the decision was for surrender.
Even then, five days later, 1000 Japanese soldiers attacked the
Imperial Palace intending to prevent a proclamation of surrender. They
failed, and the proclamation was broadcast at midday on August 15.
Meantime, among hundreds of thousands of others, the men of the Fife
and Forfar Yeomanry (average age 19[1/2]) were en route for the Far
East. They were armed with flame-throwing Churchill tanks to burn out of
their bunkers stubborn Japanese soldiers defending their homeland. They
were turned back.
Not many of them would have approved of the airy-fairy theories such
as those of Penny Lewis.

THE abdominal aneurysm which brought John McGowan into Glasgow Royal
Infirmary last January was a time-bomb ticking inside him as doctors
tried desperately to find him a place in an intensive care unit.
There was no place available in any Glasgow hospital, and by the time
they were able to operate, they were too late.
Mr McGowan, 67, died. If it had happened yesterday, he would have
fared better, but only through good luck and a mild winter. There are
still only 22 intensive care beds in Greater Glasgow to serve 915,000
people -- the same number that so incensed Mr McGowan's vascular
surgeons a year ago.
The situation will improve next month when the Royal's intensive care
unit re-opens after upgrading with seven beds permamently staffed. At
the time of Mr McGowan's death only five were in use, and two were in
reserve -- nurses could not be brought in in time to permit an
on-the-spot operation.
Two further intensive care beds will also be opened elsewhere in
Glasgow, bringing the city's total to 26. An Intensive Therapy Unit Bed
Bureau is also planned, probably based at the Western Infirmary, which
will be kept up-to-date on the availability of beds throughout the city.
That will save surgeons like Mr John Reidy having to spend an hour --
as he described at Mr McGowan's fatal accident inquiry this week --
phoning around each hospital looking for a bed.
It is too late for Mr McGowan and, who knows how many other patients,
whose operations, or treatment, have been delayed. A mother had to be
rushed to Paisley Royal Alexandra Hospital recently to receive intensive
care when she developed serious complications after she had given birth
at the Royal Maternity Hospital -- again because Glasgow Royal could not
cope.
Is it too little, as well as too late? There are no national
guidelines for the provision of intensive care. The Scottish Office said
yesterday that it was up to each health board to decide its own level
according to local circumstances.
The four new beds were approved by the Health Board last month -- 11
months after John McGowan's death -- and they also decided that the
Director of Public Health, former Royal Infirmary surgeon Dr Harry
Burns, should review the matter further. His report is due in June.
In the meantime, another resource is available -- the private sector.
It may or may not have saved Mr McGowan if it had been used, but the
Health Board made it clear it did not enter their reckoning in such
circumstances. However, both Ross Hall Hospital and the HCI Hospital in
Clydebank -- which has opened since Mr McGowan died -- carry out
vascular surgery and are equipped with intensive care units which are
unlikely to be full to capacity at any one time.
They are geared for pre-arranged surgery rather than emergency
admissions -- but both indicated yesterday that they would be prepared
to consider urgent requests for intensive care facilities.
This would require a prior arrangement in principle so that NHS
doctors knew they were free to turn to HCI or Ross Hall if nowhere else
was available.
A key principle of the NHS market-style reforms, enshrined in the
White Paper ''Working for Patients'' is that: ''In future, each health
authority's duty will be to buy the best service it can from its own
hospitals, from other authorities' hospitals, from self-governing
hospitals or from the private sector.''
NHS patients are now sent regularly to private hospitals to clear
waiting-list surgery but, in the case of an emergency like Mr McGowan's,
a health board spokesman said yesterday: ''The question does not arise.
We would not consider it appropriate to send someone to a private
hospital in these circumstances.''
Mr Ken McGuckin, director of Ross Hall, said: ''Obviously there might
be cases too complex for us to handle, and it is preferable not to have
to transfer someone after their operation, but we do vascular surgery
here regularly and could offer flexible options -- the surgical team
could come with the patient and operate here, for example.''
Vascular surgeons estimate that 8500 Scots could be walking around
with an aneurysm -- often unaware of it until it bursts with devastating
results. ''If that happens the mortality rate is 60%, but if it can be
operated on before it gets to that stage mortality is only 2%-5%,'' said
Ayr vascular surgeon Gordon Stewart.
He has campaigned for a screening programme for older men, in whom it
predominates, using ultrasound to spot the tell-tale bulge in the
artery.
Surgery is a plumbing job taking an average of four hours -- the
artery is by-passed and the damaged area removed, to be replaced with a
length of man-made fibre tubing.
More recently, doctors have been developing less-invasive techniques,
using a cannula to insert a stent -- a lattice metal framework -- in
through the artery and opening it up to support the weakened area.

Your editorial includes a reference to an ''across Britain'' opinion
poll in which a majority of those questioned were in favour of some form
of devolution for Scotland (January 16).
Assuming the poll was carried out on a UK population basis, the bulk
of that opinion would come from people outside Scotland, raising the
question of how well these people understood the Scottish situation.
In my own experience non-Scots have very little understanding of
Scotland's politics, not a pejorative observation since Scottish voters
are unlikely to have any detailed understanding of the political
situation in other circumscribed areas of the United Kingdom.
Did those questioned know, for example, that in the last General
Election the Labour Party with its commitment to a Scottish assembly
within two years lost 3.4% of its 1987 support and attracted only 39% of
the Scottish vote?
Or, to put it the way generally favoured when talking of the
Conservative Party in a Scottish context, did they know that 61% of
Scottish voters voted against the Labour Party and its devolution
proposals for Scotland?
Did they know that the pro-devolution Liberal Democrats fared even
worse, losing 6.3% of their support and attracting a derisory 13.1% of
the vote while, amid unprecedented Scottish media hype, a predicted
massive swing to the separatist Scottish National Party quantified at
only 7.5%, leaving the Nationalists well short of attracting even a
one-quarter share of Scottish electoral support?
It is unlikely that they did. Outside Scotland (and not uncommonly
within) there is a perception of Scottish political consensus which
conceals the reality of a country of political minorities none of which
even approaches holding a majority of popular support, a perception
reinforced by the fact that no matter how we vote in Scotland our
electoral system produces a glut of Labour MPs.
Had Labour won the last General Election, Scotland would have had
imposed upon it an assembly which 61% of voters had voted against. Did
the pollsters explain that to interviewees before recording their
opinions?

I read with interest the report ''Band seeks harmony with art world'',
and applaud Wet Wet Wet's initiative in commissioning Scottish visual
artists for their new album cover (January 13).
The description of the collaboration is described as ''a unique
interaction between the best of Scottish music and art''. I'm delighted
to report that not to be the case; Scottish Opera has, for several years
now, worked closely with some of Scotland's foremost artists.
Stephen Conroy created an exquisite set of paintings for our 1993/94
season brochure; world renowned Scottish photographer Harry Benson
photographed operagoers for this year's brochure -- not to mention John
Byrne's set designs for our last production of The Marriage of Figaro.
It seems that classical music can, occasionally, lead the way.

CONSULTANT neurosurgeon David Currie was on a night off on Monday --
or he was supposed to be. He actually worked from eight o'clock in the
morning until 2am the following day. And he was back on the ward in
Aberdeen Royal Infirmary six hours later.
Mr Currie does not hold himself up as a shining example of dedication.
He had, he said, met his senior colleague on the ward at 10pm that
night, up to his elbows in paperwork. ''All I am saying is that the
majority of consultants, certainly in Scotland, work like that. They
give much more to the health service than they are contracted to do.''
That does not stop most of them carrying out private work in their
free time though, he says. Mr Currie, however, is one of the diminishing
band of NHS consultants who refuse to be involved in private practice:
''For me, it's an ethical question. It seems to me disgusting to
charge money to provide health care and to profit from it. And I don't
believe you can work for two employers and give them equal treatment.''
It happens every week now, he says, that patients ask how long his
waiting-list is: ''When I say six weeks, they will say: 'Oh I have
medical insurance, would that help me get surgery more quickly'?
''I regard that as bribery. But I understand how consultants will say
yes, if you come to see me privately we can do it next week.''
In England, he says, it is commonplace for consultants not to attend
ward rounds or clinics and to leave their junior staff to do the work.
In Scotland, that is unlikely to be the case, he says.
Moonlighting by senior doctors is enshrined in their contracts with
the health service. It has been since the NHS was set up. It was part of
the trade-off Nye Bevan used to persuade a reluctant profession to
accept a national health service.
Consultants can earn up to 10% of income from private practice without
it affecting their NHS salaries which start at #40,000 rising to
#90,000. Under NHS rules, consultants can opt for ''maximum part-time''
contracts under which they forgo one-eleventh of their salary. This
allows them to earn unlimited income from private work.
As well as their salaries, consultants are eligible for a system of
distinction awards, which has been in operation since 1948. It was,
again, part of Nye Bevan's plan to ''stuff their mouths with gold''.
In 1992, 34% of consultants were receiving such awards which range on
a scale from #10,000 up to #47,200 a year.
No-one knows for sure how many NHS consultants do private work. Not
even the Department of Health. No record is kept of those who do. But an
investigation of private medical fees by the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission last year concluded that most private medical services were
provided by consultants whose main commitment was to their NHS duties.
Much private practice, it said, was undertaken outside normal working
hours.
In 1992, their report reckoned, there were about 17,100 NHS
consultants engaged in private practice and around 6000 who did none. It
said consultants' private practice earnings had increased almost
eightfold between 1980 and 1992 from #74m to #570m.
Of consultants earning more than #1000 a year in private fees, it
found that 17% were earning up to #4000, 16% were earning between
#30,000 and #49,000 and 0.3% were making more than #400,000 a year on
top of NHS salaries.
The report shows that the amount to be earned in private work varies
considerably with specialty. Plastic surgeons earned most and
pathologists least. Orthopaedic work, ear, nose and throat surgery,
urology and opthalmics were also at the top of the earnings list.
While the average earned from private work in Scotland was between
#20,000 and #25,000 a year, the report found there were consultants in
all regions earning over #100,000.
Opportunities for private work varied greatly depending on the
speciality, and where the doctor practised. There was little private
work among community health doctors, and only a limited amount in
medical schools. In some specialities, like accident and emergency,
there was little or no opportunity for private practice.
Most of it was concentrated in central London, the South-east and the
Midlands. Outside the cities in Scotland, it said, there were few
consultants doing private work.
Yesterday the British Medical Association and Health Secretary
Virginia Bottomley were swift to refute the suggestion of widespread
abuse by health service surgeons.
The Government's former waiting-lists adviser John Yates, who claims
surgeons with some of the longest waiting-lists are neglecting their NHS
work in favour of private patients, says the growth in private work is
shortchanging the health service.
His survey of 243 surgeons in opthalmology and orthopaedics, the two
specialities with the longest waiting-lists, showed that they spent
three half days a week, on average, seeing and operating on private
patients, flouting their contracts with the health service.
Mrs Bottomley insisted that the NHS came first, saying it was quite
wrong to imply that all consultants were abusing the system. Asked
whether it was acceptable for a consultant to be absent for two days a
week, she said it depends what he is doing: ''If he is an accident and
emergency consultant and he is working at night, it may well be
appropriate. It depends what the NHS is asking him to do.''
The British Medical Association pointed out that ministers had openly
encouraged the growth of private practice by its members. The average
consultant, a spokesman said, worked a 50-hour week, 15 hours more than
their 35 hours contract.
The Monopolies and Mergers report, ''Private Medical Services'', shows
that somewhere in the UK there are 225 consultants making more than
#200,000 a year in private fees on top of their NHS salaries. However,
the average earned in private practice ranged from #92,000 for doctors
around Harley Street to #25,000 a year in Scotland.
In the last decade, it said, consultants' aggregate earnings from
private practice had increased substantially.
Most private health care was for conditions that were not
life-threatening but where waiting periods were lengthy: the most common
included hernias, gall bladder disease, ulcers, hysterectomies, varicose
veins, and hip replacements.
The report estimated that the total value of private health care in
1992 was #1822m, of which specialists fees amounted to #600m. It found
that most patients who opted to go private did so to avoid waiting-lists
and to give them a choice of admission dates and the comfort of private
hospitals.
James and Rhona, an Edinburgh couple, opted for private surgery for
their five-year-old son when they were told he would wait six months to
have his adenoids removed. It would have meant his missing the beginning
of the school term, and he was in discomfort. Rhona said: ''We asked the
doctor about going private and we were told he would be operated on
within 10 days.''
Their son had surgery and had an overnight stay at the private
Murrayfield Hospital in Edinburgh and the bill was around #1200. ''We
got a series of bills, from the surgeon, the anaesthetist, and for the
hospital accommodation,'' said James.
Lothian Health Council said there were many dedicated consultants
working flat out to reduce waiting-lists in hospitals. Orthopaedics and
urology were the two specialisms where there were long lists. A
spokeswoman added: ''The initiatives to bring them down have involved
bringing in NHS staff on private rates to carry out operations at the
Princess Margaret Rose and the Eastern General.
''These operations have been purchased by GP Fundholders to get their
patients dealt with more quickly. Our argument is that it pushes other
patients even further down lists and we believe the surgery should be
carried out by NHS staff on NHS time.
''It is just one example where changes in health service practices
have forced more private health care on to the system.''

<HEADLINE>10,000 jobs are at risk, claims union Lang is urged to help councils avoid major cuts</HEADLINE>

THE pressure mounted yesterday on Scottish Secretary Ian Lang to give
councils more resources for next year to head off threatened widespread
jobs cuts and huge council tax rises.
Unison, the public service union, warned that 10,000 Scottish jobs
were at risk as a result of spending cuts being imposed on local
government by the Scottish Office. It said cuts in vital services of up
to #230m were likely as a result of the 1995-96 settlement and the
strict capping levels for council budgets.
Scottish council leaders, preparing for an angry face-to-face meeting
with Mr Lang tomorrow, said he must at least acknowledge they faced
finding #144m to pay for national wage settlements for their employees,
including teachers.
So far, the Government has insisted such increases must be paid for
out of efficiency savings by local authorities.
At the meeting with Mr Lang in Edinburgh, the Labour president of the
Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, Councillor Rosemary McKenna,
will stress that, were the Government to accept both in spending and in
grant terms the cost of these wage awards, it would significantly
improve the prospects for maintaining front-line services at their
present levels.
Cosla officials have calculated how much the situation would have been
improved if councils' grant-aided spending assessments had taken into
account the wage awards.
For example, Strathclyde region, which faces having to make spending
cuts of #107m, would have received an increase of #58m in grant
entitlement. For Lothian, looking at budget cuts of #33.5m to stay
within capping limits, it would have meant an extra #17m.
Councillor McKenna stressed the cut of #23m in Government total
support for councils next year (when provision for community care is
excluded) had hit authorities of all or no political persuasion.
Mr Mark Irvine, Unison's head of local government in Scotland, warned
the cuts would have an impact on every member of the community who
relied on vital services such as education, home helps, and provision
for the disabled.
He said the union was launching Local Government Jobwatch, a project
to inform the public of the pressures facing councils. The union would
use its comprehensive network of officials in local government to
monitor reductions in jobs and services and would publish regular
bulletins.
The Scottish Office yesterday announced that #36m for funding the
''shadow'' single-tier councils to be elected in April would be paid in
grant rather than financed by borrowing. This was Cosla's preferred
option.
Meanwhile, Mr Lang yesterday issued a vigorous challenge to his Labour
Shadow over the Opposition's intention to abolish capping controls on
local authorities and to hand back the setting of business rates to
councils, writes JAMES ROBERTSON.
He told Mr George Robertson in a letter that Labour's plans, announced
by its local government spokesman, Mr Frank Dobson, ''will not only
cause trepidation among council tax payers the length and breadth of
Scotland but will also meet with unanimous opposition from Scotland's
business community''.
Urging Mr Robertson to clarify the Scottish Labour Party's position on
the plans, Mr Lang claimed the proposals would undo all the progress
made in working towards a unified business rate throughout Scotland and
England and would mean a return to a Scottish business rates average of
76.6p in the pound, compared with next year's united business rate of
43.2p.
Mr Lang told Mr Roberston the ''hike'' would seriously undermine the
ability of Scottish companies to compete effectively in the market
place. It would also threaten existing business, deter new business from
setting up in Scotland, seriously undermine efforts to attract inward
investment, and mean the loss of many jobs.

THE extent of the damage wrought by the earthquake beneath Japan's
Inland Sea is a reminder of how human ingenuity is seldom enough to
withstand natural forces whenever these operate on any scale. The
Japanese, like the Californians, deploy highly sophisticated technology
in all their constructions in the earthquake zone. It did not prove to
be sufficient to contain the stresses consequent upon a major seismic
movement. This need hardly be surprising when the geological
consequences of such movements are known to have been so immense in the
distant past; and when similar events in modern times have occasionally
been both huge and catastrophic. This latest manifestation of powers
beyond our control was of the most damaging kind -- relatively close to
the earth's surface and productive of repeated vertical upheavals as
well as the near horizontal sways against which modern construction
techniques do offer some protection. The Japanese will no doubt want to
rethink their earthquake-resistant technology (and in particular its
application to roads and motorways, whose easy collapse may have
prevented quick and successful escapes in many cases), but they may
easily arrive at the conclusion that there is little to be done which
will certainly guarantee a different outcome in similar circumstances.
That is irrelevant to immediate considerations, especially if the
fears of some experts that a second disturbance (though of a somewhat
different nature) might occur today or tomorrow. Longer term, however,
there are lessons to be learned from this disaster. Public provision for
such an emergency seems to have been less than the region's seismic
history would recommend. The training of would-be rescue workers seems
to have been inadequate. Possibly the Japanese had too much confidence
in their ability through architectural skill to avoid the worst
outcomes. That confidence will have been dented but the other weaknesses
can be remedied fairly quickly, and they will be. The Japanese can
certainly act with despatch. More arguably they may need to persevere
longer with rescue operations among the rubble -- other quake
experiences in Iran, Mexico City, and California suggest there is every
reason to believe that almost against all reason survivors can go on
living for days after the initial shocks, though they might seem to have
been buried beyond hope.
The lessons of this quake are those of them all: that our best efforts
cannot ensure complete safety in the face of elemental forces. The
efforts need to be made all the same, for without them the worst aspects
of this disaster could have been worse still. Who knows how much greater
the casualty lists would have been had there been no attempt in design
and construction to contain the consequences of earthquakes? Who knows
how far further effort will reduce them still? The only certainty is
that we know that tectonic movement is perpetual and that earthquakes
are likely to occur, unpredictably as to timing, along the edges where
such structures overlap. Human beings will want to go on living in these
areas, which include western and central California as well as eastern
Japan. The risk they face will never go away.

THE latest employment figures are unalloyed good news. They must be
weighed against the fact of continuing unacceptably high levels of
unemployment, but they are beginning to offer hope that these levels
will go on retreating, even if there is a setback in the event of
unusually severe winter weather. It is particularly good to notice that
new job creation includes many examples of full-time as opposed to
part-time work. We are still benefiting from the emergence of the
continental economies from their own recessions, and although the
evidence of Christmas retail sales is still somewhat mixed, domestic
demand is not yet siphoning off exports into native consumption. That is
because of the way in which the various tax increases, some of which
have still to come into operation, keep restraining popular spending
(though not by any means eliminating its growth completely), although
earnings do seem to be rising a good bit above the rate of inflation.
That last is the bad news -- it rose last month by more than was
expected and the intriguing question is how far it will trigger another
interest rate increase after the Chancellor and the Governor of the Bank
of England meet again early next month.
By historical standards inflation of 2.5% is still modest, and it must
be presumed that the Governor of the Bank of England knew about these
latest figures when speaking in Glasgow about inflation recently. He did
re-emphasise the Government's commitment to bear down heavily on
inflation but his relaxed stance hardly suggested an early interest rate
hike. Some inflationary rise was to be expected as a direct consequence
of the Budget's provisions, particularly those taxes imposed to replace
the revenues lost with the second instalment of VAT on domestic fuel.
And rising commodity prices will also have an effect. Yet no matter how
it comes inflation is always a fact, and will have to be countered. It
still remains to be seen how far the two interest rate increases already
made have affected its possible resurgence. No doubt another hike will
help contain it but it will also have other deleterious economic effects
if it slows the economy too much, though continuing expansion at or
around 4% continues to suggest remarkable resilience.
None of these economic influences explains the way in which Labour
support, according to one opinion poll, contracted sharply earlier this
month: an economically induced feel-good factor still eludes the
Government. It is more likely that Labour's internal disagreement about
the future of Clause 4, and possibly Mr Major's offensive on devolution,
affected popular perceptions. The Clause 4 debate is by definition
divisive, something voters do not like, but it will hardly become an
electoral issue even if Mr Blair were to be damaged by it (which he
could be if his advice concerning its reform were rejected). It does,
however, end the Tories' monopoly of internal disagreement. Labour
should heed the warning, but it will not worry too much about drops in
its record lead in recent polls. These are anyhow unlikely to be
sustained over the next two years. The next election will probably be
far harder fought than it looks like now, but Labour remains firm
favourite.

IT was a rags-to-riches story. I stepped into someone else's shoes for
the day, and they were very expensive. For I was conducting a social
experiment of a highly important nature.
My mission? To boldly go where no Glasgow hairy had gone before. To do
a little shopping as both a scruff and a siren, a sort of Cinderella
about town -- no handsome prince, though, just Princes Square. And all
to validate the suspicion that the poor are not welcome in the heart of
Glasgow's designer metropolis.
I hit Versace, Armani, Jigsaw, Whistles, Nicole Farhi and Katherine
Hamnett. They were not impressed.
The biggest perk of the job was that I got to ponce around hamming up
my own importance just to see how big a jerk-off having money and fine
clothes really is. The down side was that I didn't get to buy anything
(The Herald is clamping down on expenses).
I am no mistress of the quick change, so the whole operation took over
two days. I am not an actress, so it was a mute part. I hate to work
alone, so I had more helpers than Santa to complete my task -- a make-up
artist, a photographer and a chauffeur.
My initial costume consisted of shellsuit bottoms, trainers and a
Co-op bag which is a kind of family heirloom. It was in my mum's bottom
drawer in the kitchen, and now it's in mine. I suppose you could call it
my trousseau. Anyway it was confiscated by colleagues before I left the
office. They said I didn't want to look like a dosser.
To cut a depressing tale short, when I walked into the Italian Centre
as an apology for civilisation, I was just invisible. I was a nobody
because I wasn't dressed expensively. To be a somebody you have to have
the right labels. This may seem too crude an equation, but C&amp;A isn't
good enough.
In Versace, I fingered and shuffled, groped languorous fabrics and
breathed heavily on the pricey gear like a pervert. And still no
attention. All the staff were too self-absorbed, until my sudden bolt to
the glass coffin by the door where thousands of pounds worth of baubles
had been laid to rest. A young, square-jawed assistant looked me over
and decided he had some urgent paperwork to do, with the lid as a
makeshift desk. I can take a hint.
A mere clodhop round the corner and the threshold to Armani yawned on
to an empty, blustery street. The photographer was stationed across the
road with a heavy-duty telephoto lens, as if spying on Princess Di. If
she'd popped in for a browse in her baseball cap, Armani would have
ignored her too.
Designer shops have the same mindset as Harrods. They punt rules in a
self-conscious, pseudo-intellectual attempt to preserve the idea of
birthright. If you are poor, have the good grace not to show it; if
you're rich, be flash. At Harrods, you can be a very important person,
but if you're in jeans and rucksack you're not allowed in. This rebels
against individual achievement and sucks up to old money. It's a
complete backlash against what the establishment sees as a breakdown of
class.
My expedition as an unwaged minority person went no better in Princes
Square. In Nicole Farhi they sneered, in Whistles they stared, in Jigsaw
they thought I was dangerous. But in Katherine Hamnett they thought I
might be extraordinarily trendy, because there you spend hundreds just
to slum it.
It was time to hit back with the help of the professionals. STV lent
me a studio, Kookai of Buchanan Street a Chanel-meets-Jackie-Onassis
number, and freelance make-up artist -- Elaine Coburn -- powdered,
pampered, tonged, patted and painted until I felt positively preened. I
became a rich bimbo, utterly committed to self.
When I first-footed Versace, the whole store stopped what they were
doing and stared. I milked the momentum and stuck my nose into the air.
Schoolgirls with minimal pocket money pulled at their lower lips in awe
as I swanked past.
I flicked through the hangars like a DJ looking for a favourite track.
I sighed disdainfully at the selection of suits, rubbed pure new wool
between my thumb and forefinger, and huffed off, deciding it had the
consistency of a J-cloth. And all to make sure the staff thought I was
stotiously rich. And it worked.
Every time I touched an item, an assistant hovered behind me,
smoothing it down as I moved on. Staff projected urgent goodwill, not
indifference. And in Armani the fluffy, blonde sales assistants smiled
apologetically as if to sympathise with the tiresome task of finding the
right cut.
All around, people tried to catch my eye. I could have snapped my
fingers for service and it would have been awarded without offence. Same
goes for Whistles, Nicole Farhi, Katherine Hamnett and Jigsaw, except
some of the staff hadn't received the same basic training in keeping
jealous glares at bay. Sales assistants are as snobby as a butler in a
mansion. This is my conclusion.
Nobody recognised me when I returned to the shops I'd previously
infiltrated looking dowdy. But I was still the same person.

The Scottish Health Minister congratulates the health boards and NHS
trusts for their ''magnificent achievement'' in taking forward the
Patient's Charter.
Success stories about increased patient turnover and reductions in
waiting time guarantees issue forth regularly from St Andrew's House.
But what is the reality for people who turn up at hospital and find
that their treatment doesn't quite match the propaganda?
The past two days have thrown the spotlight on the shortage of
intensive-care beds in Glasgow after surgeons at the Royal Infirmary
expressed their outrage at being unable to find an intensive-care bed
for a desperately ill patient.
Already the past year has thrown up a catalogue of disaster stories,
some with fatal consequences, resulting from lack of staff and
resources, administrative blunders, and human errors by medical staff.
Next month Stobhill Hospital Trust will receive a report on the
horrific death of Lorraine McGalliard, 14, who died in agony after after
a series of blunders when consultants brushed off a junior doctor's
suggestion of an ultrasound scan that could have saved her life.
Now doctors themselves are under scrutiny for allegedly moonlighting
in private practice at the expense of their NHS work. The Government
says private medicine can benefit NHS patients. But who is gaining?

CBI and TUC leaders endorsed a campaign launched yesterday to improve
racial equality in the workplace as companies were accused of failing to
transfer commitment to action.
Launching its campaign, the Commission for Racial Equality said that,
20 years after the Race Relations Act was passed, it was disappointing
that only half of companies with racial equality policies were making an
effort to put them into practice.
Black and other ethnic minorities made up around 6% of the working
population but unemployment rates among ethnic groups were twice as high
as for whites and unemployment rates were up to four times higher for
some young black and ethnic minority people compared to the average, CRE
chairman Mr Herman Ouseley said.
He added: ''Black and ethnic minority workers are invisible in the
boardroom and are largely absent from jobs of power and influence.''
Against this background, a CRE survey of more than 300 leading firms
employing four million workers found there was a gap between what
companies promised and what they did.
Launching a new standard to help employers measure progress towards
racial equality Mr Ouseley said a fresh impetus was needed.
The commission's report on employment equality said there was a
''disappointing failure'' by many companies to take action.
CBI director-general Howard Davies said the confederation would urge
firms to use the commission's new standard to monitor equal
opportunities.
''We know that employment prospects of ethnic minorities were hit
disproportionately during the recession. In the recovery we must ensure
that ethnic minority communities share in the better outlook,'' he said.
TUC general secretary John Monks said racial discrimination translated
into lost opportunities for business.

Beautiful wives on the arms of older husbands is a pattern in Italian
life: John Linklaterreports on the potent politics of power.
LAMBERTO DINI is a lucky man. He may have had the temporary misfortune
yesterday to be asked to form the latest Italian government, but that
dubious honour is unlikely to detain him for long. The thing that makes
him lucky is he becomes yet another Italian prime minister to benefit
from what we can only call the Sophia Loren syndrome.
Now nobody would describe Lamberto's wife as a Sophia Loren
look-alike, but she is a fine looking woman, a fair bit more glamorous,
dare we say it, than the pasty-faced 63-year-old premier. It doesn't
quite end there, because Italy's 54th first lady since the war turns out
to be a business tycoon and millionairess in her own right. She is
Donatella Zingone.
Beautiful wives on the arms of older husbands is a pattern in Italian
politics. Women vote for ladykillers. Men vote for politicians of the
world. It is necessary for an Italian politico to be able to at least
hint at both, and the concept of trophy wives causes not the slightest
offence. Yesterday a spokesman at the Italian Consulate in Edinburgh
said: ''We don't have much to say about this, but probably it has
something to do with the Italian spirit and a certain attention to
showing off. It is important for the political image to have a beautiful
wife, or a beautiful husband.''
Silvio Berlusconi married the former actress Veronica Lario, not quite
as outrageous a partnership as 70-year-old Greek prime minister
Papandreou marrying air hostess Dimitria Liani, but provocative in its
own way. You get the distinct impression that it wouldn't quite do for
an Italian politician to have married Barbara Bush, who looked like the
president's mother, or Norma Major, who looks like . . . the kind of
woman who would marry John Major.
It doesn't appear to matter what the Italian politicians themselves
look like. The obvious inference is that power and money are the blatant
aphrodisiacs we always knew them to be, but the Sophia Loren syndrome
covers the anguish of a world looking on as the beautiful get hitched to
the ancient. Sophia used to look so maddeningly unperturbed as she
walked hand in hand with little Carlo Ponti. Italian male magnetism is
evidently beyond looks.
We don't yet know how Donatella feels about suddenly becoming the wife
of a prime minister, because she was on a business trip when Lamberto
got the phone call this week from President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro asking
him to run the country for a couple of months, roughly the par for an
Italian administration. Some husbands just cannot be trusted not to get
up to mischief.
Italians had scarcely heard of Lamberto Dini before now. He had been
safely tucked away as Treasury Minister since May in Berlusconi's
government, and he probably assumed he would be getting back to his desk
as No 2 in the Bank of Italy when Berlusconi resigned last month.
Even by the standards of Italian politics the current crisis is
dramatico, and Dini has been asked to form a ''Government of Truce''.
Fresh elections are expected in June to bring in administration number
55. But what will Donatella think about it all?
It has to be assumed that part of the attraction of Lamberto Dini was
the security he offered. Millionairesses like banks, one supposes, and
beyond that it is difficult to see exactly what she saw in him. Who
Dini? is the question most people ask, and no he is not related to
Harry. He just doesn't make much of an impression.
Donatella looks younger than her 53 years. In the agency photograph of
the couple, taken last June, used by most British papers this week, she
looks positively glamorous in her off-the-shoulder dress and pearl
choker, and the camera lens seems to have registered her gawky spouse as
an afterthought. There looks like much more than a decade between them.
She inherited her fortune when her first husband died. He was the
industrial magnate Renzo Zingone, who built up Groupo Zeta with
extensive holdings in property, agriculture, telecommunications and
supermarket chains in Central America. Donatella got the lot. She is
rumoured to practically own Costa Rica.
In an interview with Noi magazine she boasted (the magazine said
''confessed'') that she employed 12,000 people. Widowed at 38, she
returned to Italy and tried to get planning permission to build a new
town near Bergamo. She wanted to call it Zingonia, after Renzo. The
authorities refused. Maybe she can now get Lamberto to pull a few
strings. The only controversial thing he has ever done was building a
swimming pool on the roof of the Dinis' luxury flat in Rome without
planning permission. He is not a member of a political party, which even
for an Italian prime minister is slightly eccentric.
But what of the Sophia Loren syndrome? Why do beautiful Italian women
marry such nondescript political ancients? Artist Robbie Duff-Scott, who
lives in Umbria, has a theory. Italian television is full of little fat
men in the their sixties and seventies, like Mike Buongiorno hosting La
Ruota Della Fortuna (The Wheel of Fortune) or Umberto Smiler compering
Colpo Grosso (The Big One), accompanied by young co-presenters who are
universally beautiful and buxom. Duff-Scott conjectures: ''I think this
has created the idea in the Italian psyche that these pairings are
natural, and mutually beneficial.''
Italo-Scottish playwright, Marcella Evaristi, finds the phenomonen
incomprehensible. She says: ''I'm a socialist in politics and an
aesthetic fascist when it comes to looks. I'm into beauty rather than
status in mates.''
It has to be wondered whether status will disturb Donatella when she
gets back home to find that her husband has become a prime minister.
Italians have mixed most things with their politics, and the scene has
seemed greyer since the demise of Moanna Pozzi's Partito D'Amore (The
Love Party), so perhaps the Aesthetic Fascists could yet disturb the
uneasy peace in the Quirinal Palace.

THE head of the company which has purchased eight industrial estates
from Grampian Regional Council has given assurances that it intends to
invest in the sites, not strip them of their assets.
The Newbury-based Highcross Group confirmed yesterday it had bought
the leases of more than 100 sites totalling almost 180 acres for #23.6m.
The majority of the sites are at Dyce and the Bridge of Don.
Tenants of the land, however, are determined to try to stop the sale
going through and intend to ask the local government Ombudsman to
investigate the deal.
Aberdeen District Council has also asked the Audit Commission to
investigate the sell-off.
At a meeting this week, tenants on some of the sites expressed their
anger that offers to buy the land on which their premises stood have
been rejected in the past by the regional council. They claim the sale
has been undertaken with ''immoral haste''.
Mr Peter Grubb, managing director of the Highcross Group, said the
Grampian acquisitions followed the purchase of three industrial estates
in Livingston and Cumbernauld in the past nine months, bringing the
group's investment in Scotland to more than #50m.
''We are not out to rape the sites,'' he said. ''We are not in the
business of upsetting tenants. We are a property investment company and
are looking at the long term. We have wanted to invest in the area for
some time.
''We were delighted to be selected by Grampian Regional Council to
submit a bid for this portfolio and even more pleased to be the
successful purchaser. We see Scotland as a strong growth area within the
UK and are keen to identify further investment opportunities both in
property and industry.''
He added it would be wrong to suggest that the change of ownership
will result in higher rents.
He said Highcross had acquired the estates with no intention of
selling off parts but would be prepared to listen sympathetically to
tenants who wanted to buy their sites.
Grampian's convener, Councillor Gordon McDonald, said the sell-off had
been forced by central Government cuts which had reduced its budget for
next year by more than #30m, and the money raised would be used to
address the deficit. The alternative would have been a cut in services
which, he said, would have been unacceptable.
Mr McDonald added: ''Having taken this decision, we were determined to
get the best possible deal both for the regional council and for our
tenants and I am satisfied we have achieved both these aims.''

I NEARLY got mildly excited. The monarchy and its heir are tottering
on the cusp of history. No, really. This is not me speaking. This is
that arbiter of all things quaint and curious, Harold Brooks-Baker of
Burke's Peerage, the blue-blood bible: ''I would have thought there was
now a 50-50 chance of a move to a republic in the foreseeable future,''
he intoned, gravely.
A royalty-free zone! Would this mean an end to the appalling intrusion
of privacy? Might we be able to pick up a paper without worrying that
some boo-hooing minor royal is invading our space? Alas no, I concluded
after a full, ooh, two minutes' contemplation.
Still, I wonder about Mr Brooks-Burble. I do. Has it never occurred to
him that if the royal redundo cheques go out, he will have to find
another job? Like all those inoffensive wee men with sad haircuts waving
placards, as we nip into M&amp;S for a chicken curry, proclaiming that the
End is Nigh. It never is, not even before you reach the head of the
queue in the food hall. Which is just as well. Otherwise they would have
nothing to do except amend the placards to read I Told You So.
If the monarchy goes, Mr Burble-Burke would be abolished. The skills
of hoity-toity but well-modulated spokespersons with a degree in
deference would be as sought after as, oh I don't know, a steel
worker's.
He would have to sign on for the Job-Seekers Allowance, lining up
behind the ermine-clad hordes trading in their sceptres for a Giro, and
the wee men with placards. And I bet the End won't be Nigh before they
reach the head of that queue either.
If he finds himself excluded from the jobless figures, as millions
often do, he could try self-employment in our only expansionist
industry. He could set himself up as a Heritage Centre.
But then my faint excitement was quelled by the thought that it won't
happen.
It may be far too late, sadly, for Mrs Windsor to give her errant
children a slap on the legs for shaming her in public. Even if Charles
does decide to marry Camilla Parker-Bowles, the chances are there would
be a mild wave of tabloid-induced hysteria followed by the crashing
sound of waves of the populace rushing to Woolies to buy souvenir
wedding mugs Mark II, trampling on each others' heads for an overnight
camping spot en route to Kensington registry office.
There is no distraction like a royal distraction, no myth like a royal
myth, to divert us from life's toils. Any hard thinking about an end to
the simple nonsense of the constitional role of a monarchy in grown-up
society is quickly squashed by the knowledge that it's as likely as
Elvis turning up in Turriff. (I was going to say as likely as Tam
Dalyell changing his mind but then he foiled us by doing just that.
Surprising man, Tam.)
Cabinet ministers may say they doubt whether he can succeed to the
throne, editors may chew over his moods and quirks, and the high priests
of the moral majority intone disapproval for his adultery.
Although what the moralisers overlook, I suspect, is that most people
who remain faithful do so not out of a notion of morality but simply
because they choose to: because they do not feel tempted, do not want to
jeopardise their existing relationships. That might be the only kind of
fidelity worth a damn.
Iconoclasm may rule when it comes to uncovering the sexy secrets of
this generation of princes and princesses of perpetual indulgence.
Uncontrolled sycophancy is still the local dialect when any real
constitutional crisis threatens.
It is, I fear, frivolous to contemplate the end of the monarchy and
the expulsion of Charles as heir-apparent however much of a wimp or a
scoundrel he may be. Solemnly canvassing other heirs than Charles is
just another way of loading a heap of bogus seriousness on to the
prurience involved in dissecting his marriage and his affair.
If Charles wants to succeed, will this country heave itself out of
historic inertia to challenge his intention? Is God a New Ager? Do
Ministers resign? No, the end of the monarchy remains remote.
It may be a delightful ploy to play with, casting around for a
presidential candidate (I bags Denis Healey: the intellect, the wit,
those cute wiggling eyebrows). But it's only a game.
This is a nation, remember, that fails to blush at the continuing
hereditary power of the House of Lords, that shrinks from reform like
removing wigs from judges' heads or signing up for a social contract
with its dangerously radical plan to cut the working week to 109 hours.
The Queen has graciously consented to pay some income tax and the
Civil List is trimmed. But the notion that this country has the moral
energy to dispose of a constitutional monarchy is, alas, and despite Mr
Burbling-Brook's prognostications, merely fanciful.
Even the collaboration of the Prince of Wales with his act of
unprincely folly in exposing his lack of gallantry to the rapt public
gaze is not enough. A king who whines about his dad, his
pseudo-apologetic account of his failed marriage, his soul-baring
journey round a life he could not cope with: the sense of inexplicable
grievance in a story of a life that endowed him with everything a man
could need.
Yes, the book was the ultimate myth destroyer. No monarch could
survive it unharmed. But we have been complicit in the spectacle of two
spoiled people destroying each other. Public interest is shamelessly
engaged with public curiosity.
And, in truth, there is always that sense of final restraint: a
willingness to deface the icon, secure in the knowledge that the
institution it represents will not be destroyed. Just badly chipped.
The king no longer makes the nation. The nation makes the king. If he
is a pathetic bamstick we may deserve him.
So rest easy Mr Harold Brooks-Baker. I fear you will be with us for
some time yet. The End is Never Nigh when you're in a hurry for the
checkout.

<HEADLINE>Tory raises allegations on BBC man's expenses</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ALLEGED six-figure expenses claims by a BBC journalist -- including
private school fees and the cost of a lawnmower for a fifth-floor flat
-- were raised in the Commons yesterday.
Tory MP Michael Fabricant tabled an early-day motion demanding more
information about ''persistent stories'' regarding the expenses claims
of one BBC journalist.
The BBC insisted the stories referred to in the motion were all
untrue.
However the motion also called on the BBC to provide ''urgent
reassurance'' as to the reasons for the recent resignation of the BBC's
former Brussels correspondent Graham Leach.
A second motion by Mr Fabricant relating to BBC expenses, demanded
that the BBC provide more information about the transfer of one of the
BBC's Moscow correspondents, Kevin Connolly, to the Paris bureau.
The first motion, headed ''BBC expenses and the retirement of Graham
Leach'', said that the ''persistent stories'' involved a journalist
claiming for the cost of air-freighting grand pianos from South Africa
to Europe, the purchase of lawnmower for a fifth-floor apartment and the
provision of office furniture which could not subsequently be found.
According to the motion, the stories also referred to the journalist
claiming for the cost of educating his children at private schools, even
when he was based back in Britain, and claiming more than #500 for fax
paper with a Harrods invoice.
It adds that the allegations, ''if true in whole or in part'', placed
''an unacceptable burden on the licence payer and reflect badly on the
financial controls and auditing procedures within the BBC.''
The second motion, which refers to Mr Connolly, calls on the BBC to
state whether satellite link equipment at the BBC Moscow bureau was used
by a BBC Moscow correspondent to make unauthorised calls ''amounting to
well into five figures'' including calls to UK sex lines and football
commentaries.
It contrasted the allegations with the treatment of journalists
attending the opening of new editing suites for the Arabic section of
the BBC World Television Service who were told they had incurred a
taxable benefit of #1.43 and the Inland Revenue had been informed.
A BBC spokesman said all the allegations made in the two motions
regarding the correspondents' expenses were untrue. ''These thing are
without foundation and we refute them,'' he said.
He said Mr Leach, who now works for London News Radio, had resigned
for unspecified ''personal reasons'' and that Mr Connolly's transfer
from Moscow to Paris was part of the normal movement of correspondents.

A BLOCK of flats has been badly damaged in what housing officials
believe involves a feud between neighbours.
The flats were being renovated in a showpiece programmebut the damage,
caused by axes and hammers, has set back the work by weeks and added
thousands of pounds to the bill for council tax payers.
Only six in the block in Angus Walk, Tannochside, Uddingston, survived
the assault intact.
Electrical wiring was cut, water pipes were ripped out and smashed or
stolen, smoke alarm cables and wiring for the monitored door entry
system were severed, and more than 40 panes of double-glazed window
units were smashed.
In some flats, new fitted kitchen units were damaged beyond repair,
bathroom suites were smashed, and doors were torn from their hinges. The
vandals also left excrement.
The residents had been decanted to temporary homes while the work was
taking place.
Motherwell District Council has held emergency talks with police and
the contractors, G &amp; F Sharp.
Housing chief Richard Thomson said yesterday: ''We understand there is
a problem between neighbours. Our information leads us to believe this
despicable act was carried out by local people.
''We have heard of some rivarly between people living in different
closes.
''The vast majority of people living there are decent and law-abiding.
They will be as angry as anyone about what has happened. We are spending
millions of pounds on this project which has improved the quality of
life for everyone on the estate. It is appalling that some people living
there seem bent on trying to destroy it all.
''Our housing officers are in the area interviewing people to help the
police.''
The council has not ruled out the possibility that some people on the
estate may be angry because of the running order of the work, which is
carried out block by block.
While some residents had renovated homes as long ago as 1993, others
have had to wait in the queue.
The council is spending more than #6.5m on the estate. The work
includes new windows, wiring, roofs, door entry systems, and interior
re-designing.
Contracts manager of G &amp; F Sharp, Mr Ian MacLeod, said: ''This is the
worst case of sheer wanton destruction we have witnessed in many, many,
years.''

THE future of the Prince of Wales's personal valet remained uncertain
last night after he was questioned by royal officials over newspaper
revelations concerning the affair between Charles and Mrs Camilla Parker
Bowles.
Mr Ken Stronach, 50, one of Charles's longest-serving and most trusted
employees, was accompanied by a solicitor for an interview with the
Prince's private secretary, Commander Richard Aylard.
The senior valet claimed in a newspaper article that he had to wash
grass stains from the Prince's pyjamas after Charles made love to Mrs
Parker Bowles in the garden at his Highgrove home in Gloucestershire.
Mr Stronach has been suspended on full pay pending the investigation.
Meanwhile, it was disclosed yesterday that the Prince has arranged a
meeting between business leaders and Scottish Secretary Ian Lang to
explore what the private sector can do to help communities when
emergencies occur.
Prince Charles said yesterday that after his visit to the flooded
areas in Strathclyde last month, he wrote to Mr Lang to suggest he
should meet Mr Tom Farmer, chairman of Scottish Business in the
Community, of which the Prince is president.
Mr Farmer said later that the meeting was to take place in the next
three weeks and the initiative had been welcomed by the Scottish Office.
A Scottish Office spokesman said last night: ''The Secretary of State
will be meeting Tom Farmer in the near future and sees merit in taking
stock about ways in which the private sector can be mobilised in areas
of need.''
When the Prince saw the flooded areas on December 20, Mr Lang was
criticised by Labour politicians for not offering more aid for disaster
relief. Prince Charles was speaking yesterday as he attended a meeting
of the SBC at Dalmahoy, near Edinburgh, to discuss the aftermath of the
flooding and how business support groups could help with problems in
similar emergencies.
Later, the Prince visited the new #14m sterilisation, packing, and
distribution facility of Ethicon Ltd at Livingston, and Brookbank
Cottage, near Kirknewton, which is run by an outdoor pursuits
association to promote achievement, particularly among disabled people.

A rapist who dragged his victim down a lonely lane, threatening to
kill her if she screamed, was jailed for six years yesterday.
A jury of eight women and seven men at the High Court in Airdrie, took
just 30 minutes to deliver the unanimous verdict on Edward McLynn.
Sentencing McLynn, 17, Lord Osborne said: ''It is one of the most
violent and brutal assaults it has been my misfortune to deal with.''
During the three-day trial, the court heard how the 18-year-old girl
-- who was a virgin before the attack -- met McLynn after leaving a
nightclub.
Miss X -- who cannot be named for legal reasons -- told how McLynn
ripped her dress and pants off then dragged her down the lane off Main
Street, Coatbridge, Lanarkshire, in the early hours of a Saturday last
September.
She and a friend had met McLynn and another man just moments before.
Her friend and the other man walked on.
At first, the girl allowed McLynn to kiss her but she tried to walk
away when McLynn put his hand up her skirt.
Then she was thrown down steps at the entrance to the lane, stripped,
and dragged to waste ground.
In the attack, she suffered scratches, abrasions, and internal
injuries.
McLynn, whose address was given as the Homeless Unit, Old School
Court, Coatbridge, ran off when the girl's friend came to the lane
looking for her.
He hid his blood-stained shirt and trousers under his mattress and
told police he had been wearing different clothes when they arrived to
question him the next day.
In court, McLynn claimed the girl had willingly had sex and had begun
screaming only when her friend started calling.
As the vedict was given, McLynn lowered his head into his hands.
Lord Osborne said: ''I recognise you are young but it is my judgment
that the only possible sentence is detention for a substantial period.''

<HEADLINE>Federalists' new masterplan threatens Major</HEADLINE>

MURRAY RITCHIE
European Editor
in Strasbourg
MR John Major's troubles in Europe are suddenly deepening, with Tory
members of the European Parliament increasingly uneasy about a sweeping
federal agenda being proposed by their political partners in the
centre-right European People's Party.
The suggestions amount to a list of almost everything Mr Major
dislikes in Europe. They include plans for a federal Europe with
increased powers for the European Parliament, a bill of rights, and no
national veto in the Council of Ministers.
The proposals are contained in a list of priorities in an EPP working
paper leaked last night to The Herald. Most alarming for the Tories is a
suggestion by the EPP that the European Union should have tax-raising
powers.
The appearance of the document, still in draft form, could explain the
growing rift in the 18-strong British Conservative group in the European
Parliament. A challenge is expected to Mr Tom Spencer, British Tory
group chairman, next month, less than six months after he was elected.
Mr Spencer is one of the most pro-European of the Strasbourg Tories
and will be challenged for his post, probably by the more mainstream Mr
Edward McMillan-Scott, MEP for York. So far, there is no word of a
challenge for the group leader, Lord (Henry) Plumb.
The Tories are known to be embarrassed by the nakedly federal agenda
being pushed by their EPP colleagues and fretting about how to distance
themselves from its more extreme elements.
The paper is similar in tone to the thoughts of some of Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's most senior Christian Democrat policy-makers who stunned
British Tories last year with a paper envisaging a strongly federal
Europe.
The latest paper covers suggested objectives for the EPP in the run-up
to next year's renegotiation of Maastricht, the so-called Maastricht 2,
to be conducted at an inter-governmental conference.
Mr Major said last week he would veto any major constitutional change
to Maastricht, risking the isolation of Britain in a more unified
European Union.
However, the EPP paper talks of a ''united'' Europe and states: ''Our
aim is a European federation which will guarantee peace, reinforce
democracy, and overcome the challenges of the present and the future.''
Far from Mr Major's idea of only minor changes to Maastricht, the EPP
paper talks of ''fundamental reform'' of the EU's structures. It calls
for the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers to have equal
status as legislators -- a direct contradiction of Mr Major's view that
the assembly is not ready for new powers.
The EPP wants the Council of Ministers transformed into a state
chamber which would meet in public -- effectively giving the EU a
bicameral legislature. Mr Major supports power being retained by the
council which meets in secret, apart from occasional set-piece televised
sessions.
Worse for the British government, the EPP wants decisions in the
council taken by a majority vote. Mr Major wants to preserve the
national veto and is fighting the increased influence of the growing
number of smaller EU member states who, he says, can too easily outvote
the bigger members such as the UK, Germany, France, and Italy.
The EPP would give the European Parliament and the council the right
of initiative in matters of legislation. Only the European Commission
enjoys that right at present. The EPP would also speed up co-operation
procedures on internal policy such as immigration, freedom of movement,
and the new FBI-style Europol unit for fighting organised crime.
It wants to see the Western European Union, the nascent defence arm of
the EU, formally integrated into the EU, and more majority
decision-making in the area of foreign and security policy where member
states have been criticised for taking too long to take decisions under
Maastricht.
The paper states: ''In order to have growing European integration, it
is indispensable to empower the Union with the right to levy its own
taxes. European taxes must not in any way lead to an increase in overall
costs. In regard to the levy of European taxes, national taxes must be
proportionally reduced.''
The EPP would also have the European Parliament and not just member
states nominate judges for the European Court of Justice.
The paper, described as a list of ''basic ideas'', is with an ad hoc
working group on Maastricht 2 and is, therefore, subject to revision.
However, it demonstrates how far the British Government is now trailing
behind the views of even its best friends in the European Union.

MAASTRICHT'S social chapter is regarded by the UK Government as
Euro-demonology but the 14 other EU member states see it as little more
than a set of cautious aspirations.
Mr Major negotiated a permanent opt-out for Britain from the social
chapter because, he argued, its provisions would penalise business with
social costs and bureaucracy.
In pursuing a lower-wage economy to attract inward investment, Mr
Major remarked to the fury of other European leaders: ''You keep the
social chapter -- we keep the jobs.''
In fact, there is evidence that reduced social protection in the UK
makes it simpler and cheaper for foreign investors to pay off British
workers in hard times than those elsewhere in the EU.
So what does the social chapter mean?
It talks in rather grand terms of the EU having as its objective the
''promotion of employment, improved living and working conditions,
proper social protection, dialogue between management and labour, the
development of human resources with a view to lasting high employment,
and the combating of exclusion''.
The chapter makes clear the ''diverse forms of national practices in,
particularly, contractual relations, will be taken into account along
with the need to maintain competitiveness in the EU's economy''.
In support of its aspirations, the chapter promotes:
* Better health and safety for workers;
* Better working conditions;
* More information for and consultation with workers;
* Equality between men and women in labour market opportunities.
These aims are to be achieved by the setting of ''minimum requirements
for gradual implementation'' in EU directives agreed by Ministers from
member states (and not, therefore, simply imposed by Brussels
bureaucrats).
The chapter also allows the Council of Ministers to approve:
* Better protection for workers when they are laid off;
* Social security and social protection of workers;
* Representation and collective defence of the interests of worker and
employers;
* Minimum conditions of employment for third-country workers in the
EU;
* Unspecified financial support for the promotion of job creation and
employment.
The social chapter does not prevent any member state providing better
conditions than those laid down. It is also wordy on procedures for
implementing its policies. Some decisions (for example, in the area of
social security) must be taken by unanimity. If Britain had signed up,
this would have preserved Mr Major's veto. Decisions in other areas (for
example, worker consultation) can be taken by a qualified majority --
which is why Mr Major wanted Britain to opt out, thereby avoiding being
out-voted.
Another principle of the social chapter is the pursuit of equal pay
for male and female workers for equal work.
The chapter is also notable for what it does not say: for example,
contrary to the claims often made by Eurosceptics, there is no provision
for a minimum wage.
Britain's opt-out might not last much longer. Other EU states are
angry at Britain trying to seek advantage in the Community by resisting
stronger social protection for its workers and are pledged to bringing
the UK back into the mainstream when the Maastricht treaty is
renegotiated at next year's inter-governmental conference.
Labour has said it will sign the social chapter immediately if it wins
the next General Election.

EURO-MPs backed down yesterday from threats to paralyse the EU by
refusing to endorse the incoming European Commission. Instead, they
voted 416 to 103, with 59 abstentions, to back the new team led by Mr
Jacques Santer who will replace Mr Jacques Delors as Commission
President.
Mr Santer effectively called the bluff of most members who had
demanded changes to the personnel in his team and a reshuffling of
portfolios. In the end, he made no changes in his team and refused to
change the spread of responsibilities.
The only marginal casualty of Parliament's stand was Mr Padraig Flynn,
the Irish social policy Commissioner, who was removed from a committee
dealing with equal opportunities. Mr Santer stripped him of this task in
response to women Euro-MPs who had accused Mr Flynn of being
insufficiently interested in equality.
The assembly voted in favour of the executive, including Mrs Ritt
Bjerregaard, the Danish Commissioner for environment, who had earlier
referred to the Strasbourg body as ''not a real parliament''.
Mrs Bjerregaard's comments sparked fury among some MEPs, including the
influential environment committee chairman, Mr Ken Collins (Labour,
Strathclyde East) who demanded her removal from the Commission or at
least from the environment portfolio.
Mr Santer told the Parliament that Mrs Bjerregaard said she had been
misquoted and taken out of context. However, MEPs pointed out she had
not explicitly denied her comments which were, they claimed, supported
by tape recordings of remarks made to Danish reporters.
Only two of Scotland's Euro-MPs voted for the Commission -- Mr Hugh
McMahon (Strathclyde West) and Mr Alex Smith (South of Scotland). Both
SNP Euro-MPs, Mrs Winnie Ewing (Highlands and Islands) and Dr Allan
Macartney (North East Scotland) voted against, along with Labour's Mr
Alex Falconer (Mid Scotland and Fife) and Mr Bill Miller (Glasgow).
Mr Collins, who must now work with Mrs Bjerregaard on environmental
affairs, abstained, along with Labour's most senior constitutional
affairs MEP, Mr David Martin (Lothians) who is a vice president of the
Parliament.
Mr James Provan, a Scot who formerly held the North East Scotland seat
for the Tories and now represents an English Tory seat, also voted
against, unlike most of the 18 English Conservatives. The two UK
Liberals supported Mr Santer's team.
Most British MEPs had difficulties opposing the team because it
contained two UK nominees who did particularly well in senate-style
hearings before Parliament. Mr Neil Kinnock and Sir Leon Brittan were
among the most accomplished performers when interrogated by Euro-MPs but
their jobs on the Commission would have been endangered by a rejection
of the executive as a whole.
British Tory group chairman Mr Tom Spencer said: ''This is potentially
a very strong Commission. Jacques Santer is the first centre-right
president it has had for a decade and the difference is already clear.
On several key points, he is absolutely in tune with British
Conservative thinking.''
The Parliament is now likely to examine afresh the hearings procedure.
Many Euro-MPs want power to block individual Commissioners instead of
the Commission as a whole as currently dictated by Maastricht.

THE Scots are great ones for developing an impressive self-image which
does not always hold up under scrutiny. We are all, after all, Jock
Tamson's bairns and wha's like us?
Myths such as ''there is no racism up here in Scotland'' have long
been exposed as precisely that. But what about our much-vaunted European
outlook? From Scotland's historic trading links with the Baltic to the
Auld Alliance, we believe our past makes us less insular than the
English.
Nowhere was this seized upon with greater relish than in the SNP's
Independence in Europe campaign of recent years. Here was something that
could be accepted as fact -- a small nation of Europhiles with Ecosse
stickers on their cars, contrasting with a large neighbouring nation of
Eurosceptics -- and elevated into a modernising philosophy to give the
SNP a distinctive political thrust in the nineties.
Only last month, a poll in the Financial Times, of attitudes in
Britain and Germany to EU membership, showed Scotland as the only part
of Britain to be favourably disposed to Europe and convinced of the
benefits of membership. All nine English regions plus Wales registered a
hostile view.
It therefore came as a shock to discover that, for all the efforts of
the SNP leadership and against all the evidence of the party's
barnstorming performance in the European elections last year, Scottish
Nationalists score no more highly than Labour or Liberal Democrat voters
as Europhiles.
Even more of a shock is that, in terms of a referendum on Britain's
continuing place in Europe, more SNP supporters said they would vote to
withdraw from the EU than even supposedly Eurosceptic Tory voters.
Mr Michael Russell, SNP chief executive, was at first flabbergasted at
the notion his party's voters would score highly on a question about
withdrawing from the EU. After all, this was the party which reached its
highest share yet of a nationwide poll, 32.6% in last year's European
Elections, by pressing home its new credentials as the antithesis of
Tory Little Englanders.
However, Mr Russell pointed to the specific nature of the question
posed by The Herald/System Three poll: ''If there was a referendum
tomorrow on Britain's membership of the EU, how would you vote -- for
Britain to stay a member or for Britain to leave?''
He said he found it strange that a poll in search of Scottish
attitudes couched all its questions in terms of British issues and he
argued this was bound to influence a poll looking at Scots and Europe.
''The poll proves that 78% of people in Scotland -- and 94% of SNP
voters -- consider themselves to be Scottish first,'' he said.
''The real issues for them are what Scotland can achieve within the
Community. The mere mention of British attitudes conjures up the
anti-European rhetoric of the English Eurosceptics, a group who all
Scots would be glad to get away from. In its detail, the poll indicates
a strong support for Europe.''
Arguing for a direct Scottish voice in Europe, he said this would
bring in European institutions working for and with Scots, producing the
potential to convert Labour and Liberal Democrats to the SNP cause.
''Only the SNP is putting our need for participation in Europe over
and above the Unionists' need to keep Scotland to one side of the main
debate,'' he said.
Pointing to the Social Chapter, Mr Russell said a devolved Scottish
Parliament would be unable to opt in if Westminster had opted out,
excluding Scottish opinion.
''This would have remained a decision to be made by the people of
England at a General Election, rather than the people of Scotland at any
election, and the same applies to each of the other areas considered in
the poll,'' he said.
The party breakdown on a British referendum on Europe showed that of
the 53% in favour of retaining membership, the Liberal Democrats were
most enthusiastic on 63%, followed by Labour on 56%, then the
Conservatives on 52%, and Nationalists on 47%. Again, the SNP argue that
the latter is not an anti-European sentiment but hostility to London
representation in Brussels.
Overall, 53% of Scots would vote to stay in the EU, as opposed to 26%
who say they would wish to leave. Discounting the 21% who are undecided,
among Scots who know their mind on EU membership, there is a two to one
majority in favour of staying. Most committed are Liberal Democrats, on
63%.
Men are 10% more likely to vote for continued membership than women
(58% to 48%) but are also slightly more likely to vote to leave (27% to
25%), an oddity accounted for by the far higher percentage of women who
are undecided on the issue (27% compared to 15%). People between 25 and
55 are more likely to have a fixed view than young voters or the
elderly.
There is a strong division along social lines on Europe, with
unskilled workers scoring low in terms of voting to stay (39%) and
higher on wishing to leave (31%) and with a high number undecided (30%).
On the overall question of the power of the European Union there is
widespread concern there is too much control of member states, with 56%
saying the EU has too much power (31% of these saying far too much),
compared to just 13% who believe the opposite. Around 20% believe the
balance is about right.
On a party breakdown, 71% of Conservatives believe the EU is too
powerful, a view shared by 61% of Liberal Democrats, 53% of Labour
voters, and 52% of Nationalists. Across the social divide, professional
and white collar workers are far less concerned about EU power than are
manual and unskilled workers.
On the evidence of The Herald poll, it may take generations for us to
begin thinking of ourselves as Europeans first and Scots or Britons
second. Asked about their self-identity, almost four in five considered
themselves first and foremost as Scots (79% -- ranging from 94% among
SNP voters down to 58% among Conservatives). Slightly more women than
men considered themselves Scots and, apart from a slight dip among
middle-aged people, there was little difference between young and old.

A NINE-year-old boy was hit on the leg by an airgun pellet when a
youth started firing indiscriminately, Edinburgh Sheriff Court was told
yesterday.
Wayne Alexander, 17, appeared on indictment and admitted recklessly
discharging an air pistol in Craigour Avenue, Edinburgh, on April 8 last
year.
He also admitted charges of stealing a car and driving while
disqualified and without insurance.
Sheriff Andrew Lothian sentenced him to a total of 12 months'
detention and banned him from driving for four years.
Senior depute-fiscal Alastair Brown said the boy was playing with his
sister when Alexander started firing his pistol more or less at random.
The boy was hit on the front of his right thigh.The shot caused
bruising and a considerable amount of distress.
Alexander also received five further three-month sentences on various
summary charges, including stealing cars, mountain bikes, and a
motorbike.

REFUSE collection in Aberdeen is under threat this morning when binmen
meet to decide whether to ballot for possible strike action over the
loss of 17 jobs.
The district council has admitted that proper consultation was not
carried out before a new cleaning deal was awarded to its Contract
Services Division. However, it also claims that to change the contract
would be unlawful.
Earlier this week, councillors and officials met in a bid to avert
strike action. They admitted that consultation procudures had not been
followed and offered to start talks with the managing director of the
CSD to explore lawful possibilities.
Yesterday, Transport and General Workers' Union officials met Mr Ian
Gerrie, managing director of the CSD, and it was agreed that he and Mr
Alan Towns, the city solicitor, would address a mass meeting of the men
this morning to explain the position.
It is expected the men will decide to ballot for industrial action if
the CSD is unable to increase the number of jobs required for the
contract -- from the 193 on which it calculated its bid, to the 210
which the binmen understood it to be.
Mr Tommy Campbell, TGWU spokesman, confirming he had met management
and there would be a mass meeting, said: ''All I can say is that the
meeting will be decisive on whether there will be a ballot.''

A PROFESSOR told a fatal accident inquiry yesterday that Mr James
McGowan, 67, went to hospital with a ''volcano'' inside him, since the
aneurysm bulging in his aorta was ready to erupt at any time.
Professor Charles Ruckley told the inquiry into Mr McGowan's death on
the operating table at Glasgow Royal Infirmary last January: ''This man
was an emergency case the minute he walked in.
''He should have had surgery within half-an-hour of his admission.''
Instead, the inquiry has heard, it took three hours before Mr McGowan
was operated on. The delay, claimed Professor Ruckley, may have
contributed to Mr McGowan's death.
The inquiry at Glasgow Sheriff Court has heard that when Mr McGowan,
of Prosen Street, Tollcross, Glasgow, was admitted to the infirmary, it
took 23 minutes for him to be seen by a doctor in the accident and
emergency department. There were no intensive care unit beds available
and two of the unit's nurses were off ill.
A further major delay was caused as doctors unsuccessfully tried to
get a bed for him in other Glasgow hospitals.
Mr McGowan's condition deteriorated and he was eventually taken to
theatre to undergo emergency surgery. Despite attempts to revive him, he
died on the operating table.
Doctors from the infirmary have told the inquiry of their anger and
frustration at an alleged lack of money, accommodation, and nurses in
the hospital.
Mr David Hume, 35, the hospital's director of contracts, told the
hearing yesterday that at the time Mr McGowan died the five beds had to
be staffed with part-time nurses because of sickness.
There were also two temporary beds, and he told depute-fiscal Margaret
Porter, the nursing agency had not been asked to supply nurses for them.
He said that, since Mr McGowan's death, seven permanent intensive-care
beds had been established and, next month, a central register of
available beds throughout Glasgow, based at Western Infirmary, was to
become operational.
This would mean that a doctor could find out bed availability with
just one phone call rather than spending up to an hour and a half on the
telephone contacting all hospitals.
Earlier, Professor Ruckley, 60, a vascular surgeon at Edinburgh Royal
Infirmary, said Mr McGowan's death raised profound issues.
He claimed it was unacceptable that a major teaching hospital, and one
with an outstanding record in vascular surgery, should have failed to
have provided vital facilities and had been involved in delays.
Professor Ruckley added: ''If this patient had been taken to the
operating theatre within 30 minutes, he would probably have had a better
than 50% chance of survival.''
Professor Ruckley told Mr Gerald Carroll, acting for Mr McGowan's
family, that he would have operated immediately in the hope that a bed
would become available if another patient had either recovered or died.
He also revealed that a woman patient who had been transferred from
the Glasgow infirmary to the Southern General intensive care unit, had
in fact died, and there would have been a bed available for Mr McGowan
had he lived.
Professor Ruckley admitted that Edinburgh Royal Infirmary had the only
vascular department for patients in Lothian and Borders and southern
Fife. Because of this, it was possible that it could sometimes take two
hours for an emergency patient to get to his department.
He said: ''We recognise that the best place to operate is in a
hospital with a vascular service and that a patient's best chance is to
be transferred there rather than a hospital without.
''It is a balance of risks and it can be a difficult decision.
''But in this case we are not comparing like with like. Never in 20
years of vascular surgery have I transferred a patient to another
hospital.
''We would rather operate on a patient than risk the hazard of further
time delays and operate in a hospital not equipped for it.''
The inquiry before Sheriff John McGowan continues.

JUNIOR doctors working overnight shifts were sometimes forced to leave
patients without treatment for several hours because of the intensity
and number of tasks they were expected to complete, an industrial
tribunal in Glasgow was told yesterday.
Dr Bruce Elliot told the tribunal he was often required to work
32-hour shifts in his post as a junior house officer with the Royal
Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, and had on one occasion worked for 60
hours with only 3 or 4 hours of sleep.
He said the pressures of work involved in overnight duty on the
trust's five surgical wards, looking after up to 114 patients, meant he
and his colleagues did not get the level of rest to which they were
contractually entitled while on call. He described any sleep as ''a
bonus''.
He told the tribunal how his pager went off 19 times within an hour
while he was in theatre, and added that the workload of a junior house
officer was such that a backlog of jobs ''detrimental to the treatment
of patients'' would often pile up.
''The result of this was people being left in accident and emergency
wards in severe abdominal pain for two hours because the junior house
officer was too busy to admit them.
''At other times, a patient could have to be wakened from a deep sleep
at 2am to receive an intravenous drip that was meant to have been fitted
at 10pm,'' said Dr Elliot, now a senior house officer at the Victoria
Infirmary's accident and emergency department in Glasgow's South Side.
The tribunal is hearing a test case, backed by the British Medical
Association, brought by Dr Elliot and colleagues Rory Melville, Valerie
Dudgeon and Claire Murray against the NHS trust for unpaid overtime.
Eight other doctors have registered similar complaints against the
Paisley trust, based on their first six-month contract from August 1993
to January 1994. These cases have been held over.
The 24-year-old doctor outlined his work routine for the tribunal. One
night in five or six, he would be expected to work overnight on an
on-call basis, after completing his normal day shift, to look after
patients and emergency admissions to all five surgical wards.
While a 1992 national agreement stipulated junior doctors on call were
meant to be resting for a significant portion of this night duty, Dr
Elliot told the tribunal he rarely got more than two hours of
uninterrupted sleep.
He would then work a full day shift the next morning as normal. In
addition, Dr Elliot was also expected to be on call at the hospital at
weekends, which could involve one 24-hour duty from the Friday morning
through to Saturday morning, when he would switch to a support role
after being replaced by a colleague.
This support role could last until 4 or 5pm dependent on workload.
Dr Elliot would then return the next day for another 24-hour stint as
the primary junior doctor manning the surgical wards.
The emergency cover was shared between six junior doctors, which meant
he could go five or six weekends without being on duty. However, Dr
Elliot said holiday requirements often meant they had to work harder to
compensate for the absence of a colleague.
The initial impetus behind the action by the 12 doctors was anger at
being worked too hard for too long, he told the tribunal in evidence.
The possible recovery of unpaid overtime payments was a secondary
consideration.
''Had we received the rest periods we were due, I would not be here in
front of you now,'' he told the tribunal board.
Following his stint with the Royal Alexandra, Dr Elliot completed a
six-month medical attachment at Lanarkshire's Stonehouse hospital, which
he described as being ''paradoxically'' easier than the Paisley surgical
training.
''The received wisdom within medicine is that the junior medical job
is far more onerous than the surgical but I found the opposite to be
true,'' Dr Elliot said.
He said the Stonehouse position was paid on a partial shift basis, the
classification he wants his previous six months with Paisley to be
given.
This meant he was paid more for his overtime and the number of
mandatory overtime hours was limited to 24 above the basic 40-hour
requirement.
Dr Elliot also told the tribunal he was aware of the ''trouble-maker''
reputation he may be tagged with as a result of taking the trust to the
tribunal.
The hearing continues today.

ONE of the two teenagers admitted to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary at the
weekend suffering from meningitis has died.
Fellow students at Aberdeen College and friends at 18-year-old Fay
Benzie's former school, St Margaret's, were distraught yesterday when
she lost her battle against the condition which struck both her and the
16-year-old son of Scottish industrialist Sir Ian Wood at the weekend.
The two cases are not linked.
Last night, Gareth Wood was seriously ill in the hospital.
Miss Benzie, who lived with her parents in Balmoral Place, was a pupil
at St Margaret's until last year when she left to attend Aberdeen
College to undertake an access course to achieve her ambition of
becoming a PE teacher.
The headteacher of St Margaret's, Miss Lorna Ogilvie, said yesterday:
''Fay was a wonderful girl. She was a school prefect, hockey captain,
athletics captain, vice captain of netball and a house captain.
''She was a very happy extrovert who was popular with all ages and had
a lot of friends. She was a very important part of this school and
because she was so popular we are really devastated.
''She was a lovely girl, always with a smile, and that is the vision
we will find hard to forget.''
A special assembly was being held yesterday in Miss Benzie's memory
and pupils wept as they heard the news.
Gareth Wood, also a sporting enthusiast and keen cyclist, has made
slight progress. A hospital spokesman who had earlier described him as
''critical'' said he was now ''serious but stable.''
His parents have been by his bedside since his admission on Sunday.
Gareth, a pupil at Robert Gordon's College, has two brothers.
A Grampian Health Board spokesman said for meningitis to spread, very
close contact had to take place and there was minimal risk to casual
contacts.
He said all relevant close contacts of the teenagers had been
contacted and offered the appropriate antibiotics.
Meningitis is inflammation of the lining of the brain or spinal cord
and can be caused by a number of different organisms. Some are bacteria
and other viruses and, in general, viral infection is less serious than
bacterial infection.
The incubation period from exposure to the organism to the development
of the first symptoms -- which can include headache and neck stiffness,
sensitivity to bright light, fever, vomiting, drowsiness or confusion --
is on average six days.

CANADIAN rugby team captain Gareth Rees managed a touch of high jinks
yesterday despite the disappointment of a break-in at his hotel room in
Edinburgh 24 hours earlier.
The rugby union fly half was on a visit to Edinburgh Castle when he
slipped into an overturned sentry box, lay down and then emerged to
produce a smart salute to the amusement of onlookers.
He and his squad were enjoying a break from training in preparation
for the game against the Scottish XV at Murrayfield on Saturday.
The captain had a CD player and a quantity of cash stolen in a
break-in at the Carlton Highland Hotel on North Bridge in Edinburgh.
Police were called in by hotel management after the discovery of the
theft, which is understood to have happened while the team attended a
training session.
The Canadian party had booked in last weekend along with a liaison
officer from the SRU.
A Lothian and Borders police spokesman confirmed that inquiries were
continuing. Mr Franco Galgani, the general manager of the hotel, said an
internal investigation had been set up.
Neither Mr Rees nor officials of the Canadian party were available
last night for further comment.

THE reopening of Edinburgh's suburban rail line moved a step closer
yesterday with the announcement that Railtrack and ScotRail are
supporting the scheme.
After a meeting at ScotRail's Glasgow headquarters with directors from
the two rail organisations, Councillor David Begg, chairman of Lothian
region's transport committee, said all three parties now wanted to see
the line ''up and running''.
A joint statement was released later which said the three agencies
were now working closely together to get the suburban line reopened ''as
quickly as possible''.
Mr Begg said agreement on the cost of the project would be reached
within a fortnight when a joint application to the Scottish Office for
funding would be made.
The council hopes the line, which circles the city and has remained
unused since its closure in 1963, will carry 13,500 passengers daily.
Mr Begg said: ''If we're going to get people out of cars and on to
public transport, it's got to be reliable and fast.
''This line will give quick movement from suburb to suburb that is
difficult by car.''
However, he fears the cost of the project -- estimated at #22m --
might deter the Government from funding it.
''I think the line will reopen,'' he said. ''But I've got my concerns.
Railways certainly aren't expanding.''

AN uninvited guest -- a young seal pup -- was returned to its natural
habitat last night after a two-day operation to free it from a power
station cooling tank. Officials of the Scottish Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals used its favourite food to tempt it to
eventual safety from the tank at Cockenzie Power Station in East
Lothian. They baited fish and, with a net borrowed from a Musselburgh
netmaking company, scooped it from its trap.
The seal, thought to be about three months old, had been in the tank
for three days, avoiding efforts using a wooden pallet to catch it. An
inspection of the seal pup revealed that it was none the worse for its
entrapment. Last night, SSPCA inspector Paul Anderson said: ''The
original intention was to bait the pallet with fish, hoping it would
climb on board, then raise it. Fortunately, the net did the trick and I
was able to return the pup to the sea.''

UNEMPLOYMENT in Scotland has fallen to its lowest level for almost
four years according to figures released by the Government yesterday.
The seasonally-adjusted total of registered unemployment in Scotland
last month dropped by 4500 to 212,100, which represents 8.5% of the
workforce.
In the UK as a whole, unemployment fell for an 11th consecutive month
to reach a three-year low of 2,414,000.
The seasonally-adjusted total, the best long-term guide, dropped by
54,600, leaving a jobless rate of 8.6%, the lowest level since August
1991.
The figures, which mean that the jobless total throughout Britain is
now half a million down on its peak of just under three million in
December 1992, prompted a predictably upbeat response from the
Government.
The Employment Secretary, Mr Michael Portillo, said that, with
unemployment falling, ''we are starting 1995 with Britain's economy in
very good shape. Output is at record levels, exports are rising faster
than imports, and consumer confidence is returning''
The Scottish Office Industry Minister, Mr Allan Stewart, described the
4500 reduction in Scotland as ''remarkable'' and said unemployment in
total had fallen by more than 26,000 in 1994 and was now at its lowest
level since March 1991.
He added: ''The latest Scottish Chambers' Business Survey, published
last week, also provides good reason for optimism into 1995 with rising
business confidence at the end of 1994, based on increased orders and
sales and favourable investment intentions across the main sector of
Scotland's economy.''
The CBI in Scotland agreed the unemployment figures indicated that the
economic recovery was progressing steadily, adding: ''There are still
too many people unemployed, but it is heartening to see the figures
moving in the right direction.''
Opposition parties and the STUC were unsurprisingly more reserved in
their praise and repeated claims that the figures did not fully reflect
the numbers seeking work.
Labour's employment spokesman in Scotland, Mr John McFall, said that,
while welcoming the fall, he was still suspicious of the figures.
He claimed the Government was seeking to punish doubly the unemployed
with the Jobseekers Bill, which even some Tories recognise will widen
inequality and deepen impoverishment by axing benefits by 70% to those
unemployed for more than a year.
''The long-term unemployed remain the fastest growing category of the
jobless and, by turning a blind eye to them and pushing forward this
cruel Bill, the Tories are adding to their misery,'' he said.
Mr Campbell Christie, general secretary of the STUC, said it was a
matter of concern that, despite a full year of growth in the Scottish
economy, as much as 8.5% of the workforce was still out of work.
He added that the figures left no room for Ministerial complacency and
that an active programme of industrial investment, cuts in working
hours, and a boost in job-intensive public services were essential.
SNP employment spokesperson, Ms Nicola Sturgeon, said jobless Scots
were growing tired of the Government's ''ceaseless doctoring'' of the
unemployment figures and pointed out that 75% of jobless 16 and 17
year-olds received no benefit and were not counted as unemployed.
The leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, Mr Jim Wallace, also
welcomed the continued fall in unemployment but said that, by planning
for pre-election tax cuts, the Government was allowing no opportunity
for the necessary investments to be made in Scotland. ''As long as that
is the case, our recovery will be built on shaky foundations,'' he said.

A HOTEL worker who stabbed a 24-year-old woman before subjecting her
to a brutal rape was jailed for 12 years yesterday.
Wayne Williamson, 25, of no fixed abode, was found guilty of
attempting to murder the woman and raping her in a chalet at the Gretna
Hall Hotel, Gretna, on September last year.
A jury at the High Court in Edinburgh convicted Williamson of stabbing
his victim, forcing her to lie on the floor and raping her.
Lord Mayfield told Williamson, a kitchen porter at the hotel, that he
had been convicted of two serious charges. The first involved a vicious
knife attack which inflicted serious injuries.
''That was followed by a sexual attack on a wounded woman. In my view
you are not safe to be out and about. This was a truly horrific
incident.''
During the trial the victim told the jury that Williamson had
threatened to kill her if she screamed during her ordeal.
She gave evidence that minutes before the rape Williamson had stabbed
her in the abdomen and that part of her intestines were ''hanging out''.
When she complained to Williamson about the pain caused by her wound
he replied: ''I could not give a f*** what I did to you.''
She explained to the court that the attack took place after she had
rejected his advances. Williamson had then come up behind her with a
hunting knife.
As they struggled she felt a burning pain in her stomach.
A consultant surgeon at Cumberland Hospital, Carlisle, told the court
that the woman had undergone an emergency operation lasting more than
three hours. She had lost a considerable amount of blood which had
placed her life in danger.

AIR UK was yesterday named the best UK domestic carrier in the 1995
Airline of the Year awards.
It is the first time that Britain's third largest scheduled airline
has won the award, beating stiff competition from British Airways and
British Midland.
The honour also comes in the same week as the company is due to
collect another national award, this time in a Sunday paper's
punctuality competition.
Mr Andrew Gray, managing director of Air UK, said: ''This is a great
achievement and an enormous credit to our staff.
''It is a very difficult award to win because these are not glamorous
routes and it depends on enormous effort day by day. Winning this award
shows that we are very consistent and we've actually unseated both
Britihs Airways and British Midland this year.''
Based on a poll among Britain's most frequent business travellers, it
is the first time that the award, jointly sponsored by Executive Travel
magazine and Carlson Wagonlit Travel, has gone to a non-Heathrow based
carrier.
Mr Mike Toynbee, editor of Executive Travel, said: ''Air UK is
providing a consistently high level of service from an increasing number
of regional airports, with the added benefit of all the ultra modern
facilities of Stansted Airport, which is its main hub.''
The results are based on a series of nominations and flight
assessments by readers during the past year. A total of 24 items are
checked for each flight as part of the assessment programme, from the
quality and choice of in-flight food and wine, to comfort, punctuality
and attitude of staff both in the air and on the ground.
Meanwhile, British Midland, the country's second largest airline,
reported a significant improvement in passenger figures for the past 12
months.
Numbers increased to more than 4.5 million with domestic routes from
Scotland achieving an 8% rise.

CHELSEA and England soccer star Dennis Wise told a court yesterday
that he smashed a taxi window because the driver pulled away as his
girlfriend was getting out, knocking her over.
Mr Wise's taped explanation to police was played at Horseferry Road
Magistrates' Court, central London, where the 27-year-old footballer
denies assault and causing damage.
Cab driver Gerald Graham, 65, had told Magistrate Geoffrey Breen that
he picked up Mr Wise, and his girlfriend in Kensington High Street, west
London, just before midnight on October 8.
He said Mr Wise, of east Acton, west London, wanted to go to Shepherds
Bush but his girlfriend wanted to go further, to Boston Manor Road,
Hanwell.
He told them he did not have to take them as the journey was more than
six miles, and Mr Wise got out of the cab, flew into ''a real rage'',
and started punching the driver's door window and kicking the cab.
''As he was doing that, I shied, because of the banging, and my foot
came off the foot brake, and the cab, being automatic, moved forward,
and at that time, there was a scream from the girl.
''He shouted: 'You've hurt my girl,' and with that he jumped back into
the cab, sat on the seat at the back, and started kicking the driver's
partition window.
''The window shattered and he started punching me around the back of
the head,'' Mr Graham told the court.
The incident near Scribes West, England football team manager Terry
Venables's club, ended when a police patrol car happened on the scene
and officers managed to stop Mr Wise.
He told police that he broke the window with his hands, not his feet,
after Mr Graham declined to take them.
He said that when he told the cabbie that he was entitled to go at
least five miles, Mr Graham, who was eastbound when he was hailed, said:
''I'll take you five miles, to the East End, and drop you off there.''
Mr Wise told police: ''My girlfriend tried to get out, she opened the
door and he drove off and knocked her flying. He didn't stop.
''I feel I am entitled to punch the glass because he wouldn't stop . .
. I tried to grab hold of him and the police came into the car.''
Constable Stephen Sullivan, one of the officers who happened on the
scene, said he found Mr Wise with both arms through the partition
window, holding either side of Mr Graham's neck and shaking him.
The hearing was adjourned until February 7.

<TEXT>
A HIGHLAND community was celebrating last night after a company
abandoned plans to develop a landfill site next to their houses.
Evergreen Land Management Ltd has withdrawn proposals for the site at
Caplich Quarry at Alness, Ross-shire.
The decision came as a special meeting of Highland region's planning
committee was due to be held at Alness on Monday to consider the
application and local opposition.
More than 1300 objections had been lodged, with locals saying the tip
would cause noise and traffic problems and would be too close to houses
and the school.
It is thought the company may come back with an amended application.
However, the objectors say they will fight it all the way.
Mrs Joan Ross, chairman of the Alness Group Against the Super Tip
(AGAST), said: ''We are delighted. The news is a great relief as the
plan had caused us great concern.''
Mrs Ross said 150 lorries would have used the roads to and from the
site each day and the tip would have been 270 yards away from a school
and 300 yards from houses.
Mr Richard Cameron, Highland region's director of planning, was to
recommend refusal of the application which would have created a 1000
metre long hole, 15 metres deep, for waste from Ross and Cromarty and
other areas.
Although there is a shortage of landfill sites in the area, Mr Cameron
believed the plan was premature while discussions continued on other
potential sites.
Mr John Boldon, director of planning and landscape design for
environmental management consultants Aspinwall and Company, said its
clients had withdrawn the application ''to take stock'' after
considering Mr Cameron's reasons for refusal.

STAFF at the Clydesdale Bank are to vote in a ballot over strike
action following a breakdown in pay negotiations.
The Banking, Insurance, and Finance union (Bifu) is to hold a strike
ballot at the Glasgow-based bank and at the Leeds-based Yorkshire Bank,
both owned by the National Australia Group.
About 9500 staff will be involved in the ballots for a series of
one-day strikes following the union's refusal of a 2.5% increase linked
to flexibility. The union has claimed 6.75% and has advised its members
to vote for a strike.
''With inflation at 2.9% and rising, bank profits at an all-time high
of #110m, 40% of all staff not receiving performance bonus and the
shareholders receiving massive dividends of #90m, the bank's offer of a
total distribution worth approximately #1.75m is not acceptable,'' said
a union statement.
Last night, Bifu's assistant secretary, Mr Keith Brookes, claimed the
National Australia Group was pushing UK staff harder to increase profits
but was not prepared to reward them fairly.
He said the bank's ''drive to a performance culture'' was putting
intense pressure on staff. He added: ''They are fed up working harder
for little reward. The benefit seems to be going to owners in
Melbourne.''
Last night, a spokesman for the Clydesdale Bank said there was very
little to say until staff had been fully informed of the situation when
they arrived at work this morning.
''We were disappointed that at the end of two full days of discussions
-- during which the bank moved significantly -- that the union is to
seek industrial action. The full circumstances have been set out for our
staff who will be informed on arrival at work.''
NAG will today ask its shareholders at an AGM to approve the release
of 400,000 of company shares -- worth #2m -- to its chief executive, Mr
Don Argus. They will also be asked to grant a preferential loan for Mr
Argus to buy the shares.
However, last night Bifu said it had voted by proxy against the move
which was rewarding ''bosses at the top of the tree while failing to
reward the workers''.

FORMER hostage Tom Sutherland flew to Scotland last night for the
funeral of his sister Elizabeth, who died after contracting the disease,
necrotising fasciitis.
Mr Sutherland, 63, who now lives in Denver, Colorado, said: ''I had to
be here for dear Liz's funeral.
''She was like a mother to me. She was the one who was always there
for me when I was a boy playing in the farm fields.
''And she was always in my thoughts throughout my six-and-a half years
of captivity.''
Speaking at the home of his brother Willie, 62, in Airth,
Stirlingshire, Mr Sutherland said: ''Liz was the one who gave me a
tearful farewell when I first set out for the Lebanon.
''She urged me not to go. She was frightened for my safety.
''And she was proved to be right.''
Mr Sutherland, Dean of Agriculture at Beirut's American University,
was held hostage along with Church of England envoy Terry Waite and
journalist John McCarthy.
He said that one of the first messages of condolence on his sister's
death came from Terry Waite.
He said: ''Terry faxed me a message of sympathy to my home in
Colorado.''
Miss Sutherland's funeral takes place today. There will be a private
family service at the home of the eldest brother, Peter, 73, in
Stonehouse, near Grangemouth, followed by a service at Falkirk
Crematorium.
Miss Sutherland, of Bothkennar, near Grangemouth, died last Saturday,
a day before her 72nd birthday, in Glasgow Royal Infirmary.
She had undergone emergency surgery at Falkirk Royal Infirmary to cut
away flesh from her neck.
Mr Sutherland said: ''She was switched to the other hospital's renal
unit because her kidneys had started to fail.
''But I believe she died even before she could be hooked up to the
renal machine. It is a sad, sad, time for all the family. We want to pay
our last respects to Liz quietly and privately.
''But we will also be there to celebrate her life. She was a wonderful
person. After my release from Lebanon in 1991, she wrote to me every
week. I couldn't wait to get her letter every Thursday. We will all miss
her terribly.''

THE Forth railway bridge is ''covered in seagull shit,'' Labour MP Tam
Dalyell complained in the Commons yesterday.
Mr Dalyell (Linlithgow) -- one of three Scottish Labour MPs who
recently spent four hours examining the 19th-century structure -- at
Question Time gave Environment Secretary John Gummer a graphic
discription of what they had seen.
''We were appalled at the flaking paint, bare steel structure, all the
debris of dead birds and the seagull shit.''
He called for money from the Millennium Fund to be used to smarten up
the bridge as Railtrack had other priorities.
''The bridge is a national monument associated not only with Scotland,
but Britain and Europe.''
Mr Gummer said he would like to inspect the structure himself and
assess what Mr Dalyell had said.

MORE support centres for children of separated and divorced parents
are vital as the number of broken marriages in Scotland continues to
rise, the country's senior mediation officer said yesterday.
Ms Carol Barrett, development officer for Family Mediation Scotland,
said access and contact centres had become the best means of reducing
trauma suffered by children when a family breaks up.
England and Wales had 104 centres while Scotland had a mere 11, she
said.
''Half of all children completely lose touch with one parent within
two years of separation.
''The centres are friendly places where children can spend time with
the parent they do not live with. Children are much less likely to
suffer long-term emotional disturbance if they maintain contact with
both parents,'' she said. ''We really need more.''

FIFE Regional Council was told yesterday that a proposed #50m
purification scheme in Levenmouth must be paid for from the council's
own resources or through other methods of funding.
Scottish Office Minister Allan Stewart told the local authority that
it was Government policy to reduce public sector borrowing requirements
and that no additional funding would be available.
Councillor John MacDougall, leader of the Labour administration, said
yesterday he was disappointed by the response.
He said the council was concerned that the scheme could now be delayed
until the new water authority took over in spring next year, despite the
fact that #2m had already been spent.
''The scheme is vital to the environmental and drainage needs of the
whole Levenmouth area,'' he said.

AN Army sergeant died when the car in which he was travelling drove
into the back of a parked lorry.
Yesterday, the lorry driver was cleared of parking his vehicle in a
way which could have caused the accident.
Mr John McSeveney, 39, from Inverness, a sergeant in the Queen's Own
Highlanders, was the front-seat passenger in a Mini Metro which drove
into the lorry early on February 11 last year.
He was trapped in the car and died in hospital.
At Inverness Sheriff Court, Mr David Oliver -- who was 22 yesterday --
was accused of leaving the lorry parked in the street in a position
likely to cause danger to other vehicles.
He was also charged with leaving the vehicle overnight without parking
lights.
He denied both charges and was formally found not guilty of both after
Sheriff William Fulton ruled there was insufficient evidence to suggest
the position of the lorry was to blame for the accident.
The court heard Mr Oliver, of Morriston Court, Grangemouth, had been
working in Inverness as an insulation operative.
He stayed overnight on February 10 last year and parked his Leyland
Roadrunner box lorry in the town's Southside Road.
The court was told that the lorry was parked close to the kerb, though
the rear was slightly further out.
Constable Bartholemew Lucas, 47, said the lorry was about
one-and-a-half feet wider than the parking bay but he would not have
considered it an obstruction.
Nor was he concerned that it was not displaying parking lights because
that law was not usually enforced, he said.
Earlier, Mr John MacLean, 30, of MacKay Road, Inverness, a passenger
in the car which collided with the lorry in the early hours of February
11, said he had seen the lorry parked from 300 yards away, and it was
clearly visible beside a streetlight.

THERE is no current political will locally to impose a road congestion
tax on motorists, officials of Lothian Regional Council and
Cambridgeshire County Council told the Commons Select Committee on
Transport yesterday.
In written evidence Dr George Hazel, Lothian director of
transportation, said it was essential that money raised by road pricing
should be earmarked for improving transport if public support was to be
achieved.
Mr Andrew Holmes, deputy director for client services at Lothian, said
further measures of parking control would have little effect on the
volume of traffic in the city which was experiencing a higher growth in
car traffic and ownership than the UK average.
Professor Antony May of Leeds University described a congestion meter
which could be fitted to each car which would record a charge either
when the speed fell below 10 or 15mph or a kilometre was covered in less
than a specified time. The object would be to encourage motorists to
avoid using frequently congested routes.

SIR Walter Scott is to be beheaded. His crime: failing to match up to
the familiar image on portraits, statues, and banknotes.
The execution is taking place in Selkirk, where Sir Walter sat as
sheriff up to his death in 1832 and where his old courtroom was reopened
as a museum last summer.
Dominating the room is a lifesize model of the author. However, after
criticism from locals, his head is for the chop.
The face, say the locals, looks nothing like Sir Walter and, next
month, experts from Netherfield Visuals, of Edinburgh, will remove the
head and start work on a new one.
Sir Walter's great, great, great-granddaughter, Mrs Patricia
Maxwell-Scott, who formally opened the museum in July and who still
lives at the author's old home, Abbotsford, said yesterday: ''I am very
happy that they are having another go. I didn't think the model looked
at all like Sir Walter.
''The face was far too thin. I hope the second attempt will be more
successful.''
Selkirk's provost Tom Henderson said: ''It is not a good likeness.
There are so many pictures and portraits of Sir Walter around, I don't
know why they couldn't have got it right the first time.''
The model was made by London museum equipment firm, Gems, which is
meeting the cost of the replacement.
Mr Ian Brown, museums curator for Ettrick and Lauderdale council,
said: ''It is fair to point out that, at the end of his life, Scott was
working himself into the ground to pay off debts and would probably have
looked thin and gaunt.''
A chubbier and more cheerful looking Scott should be ready for the
courtroom's reopening in spring.

A SIGNALMAN who claims he suffered a nervous breakdown after
''witnessing'' the Newton rail disaster several miles away on an
electronic panel, yesterday won a crucial stage in his damages action
against British Rail.
Mr Edward Dillon was responsible for controlling train movements in
the area of Newton Junction on the outskirts of Glasgow at about 9.50pm
on July 21, 1991.
Following the crash, in which two trains collided on a single line,
killing four people and injuring 22, Mr Dillon, of Carlisle Lane,
Airdrie, sued British Rail for #50,000 in the Court of Session.
British Rail asked Lord MacLean to dismiss the action but, in a
written decision issued yesterday, the judge decided that evidence
should be heard in the case.
He was told the route of the trains in the Motherwell signalling
centre where Mr Dillon worked was indicated by a chain of white lights
with signals shown as red for stop and green for go.
Suddenly, Mr Dillon saw on the panel that the track circuit indicators
on the north connecting line had merged and the track circuit alarms
rang.
One train had gone through a red signal and collided with a train
travelling in the opposite direction.
British Rail asked Lord MacLean to dismiss the action on the basis
that Mr Dillon had failed to establish he was closely enough involved in
the accident to claim damages.
They pointed out that Mr Dillon was not claiming any special
relationship between himself and anyone involved in the disaster.
Also, he had not even seen the disaster but was dependent for a visual
appreciation of what happened on a set of graphics. He had seen no more
than was visible on the controls in the signalling centre.
Nor was there any claim that Mr Dillon had feared for his own life.
British Rail argued that seeing lighting appear on the board and
hearing circuit alarms was not the equivalent of seeing or hearing the
actual event, any more than if a computer had printed out a message.
The kind of images seen by the signalman came within the category of
an account of the disaster passed on to him by someone else.
Mr Dillon conceded he had not actually seen anyone injured or attended
the scene of the accident and had dealt with the aftermath of the
disaster at a distance.
He argued, however, that as an employee he had a close enough
relationship to British Rail to claim damages.
What mattered was involvement or participation in the events, not that
information about the accident was conveyed to him electronically.
Lord MacLean took the view that Mr Dillon had been an active
participant in the events.
It was his job to set the routes and signals for the trains, to
observe how the drivers responded, and take steps if the signals were
not observed.
He claimed that a train driver had failed to observe a signal properly
because of British Rail's negligence in devising the layout of the track
at Newton Junction.
Lord MacLean said: ''It seems to me that if Mr Dillon could establish
all this he could reasonably be described as an unwilling participant in
the event and that it could justifiably be said that the negligent act
of British Rail had put him in the position of thinking that he was or
was about to be the involuntary cause of death or injury to others.
''The principal difficulty is that he was not present at or even near
the scene and that his appreciation of what was about to happen, and did
in fact happen, was conveyed to some extent aurally but more especially
visually, but not by picture images relayed by a camera.''
What was important, however, was that the images of what was happening
must be immediate and simultaneously transmitted. In this case, there
could be no doubt about that.
''What was represented before Mr Dillon's eyes in electronically
graphic form was an impending disaster which actually happened as it was
happening. He knew what was unfolding before his eyes.''
His claim should not be denied because the image he viewed of events
was not a camera image.
He decided to allow evidence to be heard in the case.

A COUNCIL finance chief has said a move to donate cash to Paisley
flood victims would be illegal.
Mr Don Anderson, director of finance at Clydesdale District Council
has suggested that staff and council members should have an office
whip-round to raise money instead.
The recommendation to the Labour-controlled council's general purposes
committee follows a decision by Tory dominated Eastwood district on the
outskirts of Glasgow yesterday to make a donation, having ruled the move
was legal.
Renfrew District Council had written to many district authorities all
over Scotland seeking relief funds for victims of last month's floods.
So far, 12 have made contributions from their contingency funds.
However, Lanark based Clydesdale council chiefs claim that they would
be breaking local authority laws if they used the contingency fund to
help.
Mr Anderson quotes section 84 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act
1973 as the barrier to the council making a donation. Mr Stephen McCann,
in charge of Clydesdale's legal department, said: ''There is a section
in the Local Government Act dealing with emergencies and a council's use
of funds is restricted to their own area.
''Whilst the council would quite gladly have given the money, we don't
have the power to.''
However, Eastwood's assistant director of finance, Mr Craig Bell,
said: ''A local authority has the discretion to make payments for
matters that they think are in the public interest.''
Renfrew Provost William Orr said yesterday: ''In total, we were given
#150,000, and this week everyone affected by the flood will receive a
cheque for #250. Most authorities promised us money out of their
contingency fund.''

BRITAIN's biggest building society, the Halifax, will deliver a blow
to homeowners today with an increase in mortgage rates.
It is expected to be about 0.3%, with other lenders following suit.
There was also speculation about a further rise in general interest
rates after the annual inflation rate rose sharply in December, to 2.9%,
well above market projections.
The rise was accompanied by a fall of 54,600 in the number of
unemployed to 2,414,000, the largest decline during the recovery and the
seventh highest since records began in 1971.
The combined figures fuelled City fears that the economy was growing
too fast and further monetary tightening would be needed.
However, Chancellor Kenneth Clarke played down interest rate
speculation, stressing he had already taken action with two increases in
interest rates and the December inflation figures were in line with his
expectations.
Earlier this week in Glasgow, the Governor of the Bank of England, Mr
Eddie George, in a speech to bankers, had been widely interpreted as
indicating that a further base rate hike was not imminent.
In December, the retail price index grew by 0.5% over the month, with
the annual headline rate rising from 2.6% to 2.9% against market
projections of 2.7%. The underlying rate, which excludes mortgage
interest and is the Government's preferred measure, rose from 2.3% to
2.5% on an annual basis. The market had expected the figure to be
unchanged.
The Halifax and other mortgage lenders held off from adjusting
mortgage rates following December's half-point increase in base rates to
6.25% largely because of worries about the housing market.
However, with intense competition in the savings market, upward
pressure on savings rates, and a large number of mortgage rates based on
annual reviews usually carried out in the new year, the society decided
to go ahead.
At present, Halifax's standard mortgage rate is 8.1%. An increase to
8.4% would lift monthly payments on a #30,000 repayment loan by #4.57
and on a #50,000 loan by #8.58. On the same basis, endowment mortgages
would rise by #6 and #11 respectively.

THE Ministry of Defence is to spend millions on a dock, which has
already cost #120m, to prevent it being reclaimed by the River Forth.
The RD57 dock at Rosyth was to be the refitting base for the new
Trident nuclear submarine fleet butthe contract for the work was awarded
to the Devonport yard in Plymouth.
The ministry has lodged a notice of proposed development with
Dunfermline District Council's planning department to stabilise three of
the walls in the huge hole in the ground, measuring 300 metres by 200
metres, by pouring in 270,000 tonnes of rock to prevent seepage from the
river.
The MoD proposes to bring the rock from Fife quarries by lorry, which
will involve 10 20-tonne lorries hour travelling through Rosyth on
weekdays for 10 months.
There is a berth at the south side of the RD57 for ships but the MoD
says it prefers to bring the rock in by road because of ''simplicity of
operation''.
The plan will create 40 new jobs at the RD site for a year.
On the site's future, the MoD said: ''It will be offered for sale as
part of the sale of Rosyth Dockyard.''
Chairman of the Rosyth Dockyard trade unions, Brian Negus, said:
''This is the first we have heard of any such proposals.
''We thought the RD57 would be used as a graveyard for defunct nuclear
submarines, of which there are four in the basin next to the RD57.''
The MoD's proposals will come before the district planning committee
next month.
A spokesman said: ''Because it is a notice of proposed development by
the Crown, planning permission is not required.
''However, should it be opposed by the district council, there would
have to be a public inquiry.''
An MoD spokeswoman at Rosyth declined to say how much the infill would
cost.

LORD Kagan, erstwhile confidant of the former Labour Prime Minister
Harold Wilson has died, it was announced yesterday.
The 79-year-old peer, a self-made millionaire, died on Tuesday night
in his chair in front of the fire at his west London home, said his
daughter Jenny. He had a slight heart attack some weeks ago.
Lord Kagan -- founder of the Gannex raincoat empire -- destroyed his
worldwide reputation as an entrepreneur through his own greed.
A Lithuanian Jew, he amassed a personal fortune and survived
persecution by both the Nazis and the Soviets. He was helped to further
fame and fortune by Mr Harold Wilson, who made the Gannex raincoat his
own trademark.
Mr Wilson made Kagan a knight in the dissolution honours list of 1970
and a life peer in his resignation honours list of 1976. However, Lord
Kagan was jailed for 10 months in 1981 and fined #56,000 at Leeds Crown
Court after he admitted theft and false accounting. He spent a total of
202 days in prison and was subsequently stripped of his knighthood, but
his life peerage was never rescinded.
He had a reputation as a womaniser and a passion for chess. It was
this which brought him into contact with the suspected Soviet spy,
Richardas Vyalgauskas, a senior KGB officer, who was expelled from
Britain in 1971.
Joseph Kagan was born in 1915 in Kovno, Lithuania, the son of a
textile mill owner. He came to England in 1937 with his father Benjamin,
who later set up a factory in Yorkshire.
He went to college in Leeds, where he discovered a technique to bond
waterproof nylon to woollen fleece and conceived of marketing it under
the brand name Gannex.
However, he returned to Lithuania with his mother for a holiday in
1940 and within weeks Stalin's troops arrived in Kovno. His father's
factory was taken over and, after three months of sweeping floors and
minding machines, Kagan persuaded the local commissar to allow him to
run it.
Six months later, the Nazis marched into Kovno in 1941 and Kagan was
herded into the Jewish ghetto of Vilijampole. It was there that he met
Margaret Stromas, whom he married in 1943.
The newlyweds, together with Kagan's mother Miriam took to hiding in a
tiny room high in a factory roof. They were ''liberated'' by Russian
troops in 1944.
Kagan returned to Yorkshire in 1946. With a small amount of savings
and loans from friends, he set up a small textile business in Elland,
near Leeds.
In 1956, he patented Gannex. He went on to acquire more mills to
produce cloth for his successful Gannex range.
He leaves a widow, two sons, and a daughter.

THE Volvo plant at Irvine in Ayrshire is to create 100 jobs over the
next two years. Fifty jobs will be created this year and a further 50 in
1996, bringing the workforce to nearly 500 as truck production capacity
increases by nearly 60%.
The #6m expansion will include Volvo Truck and Bus's long- haul
vehicle, the FH, entering production in the middle of this year and
another model, the FL12, coming on line later in the year. Capacity at
the plant will eventually increase to 5500 heavy trucks a year.

THE Glasgow arts festival season will begin with the first large-scale
arts event in Eastwood in the twenty years since the establishment of
the district.
Artsfeast is a #225,000 festival beginning at the Easter weekend,
making particular use of outdoor spaces and with a strong emphasis on
the visual arts.
The week-long festival, which is planned as a biannual event,
represents a commitment to the arts for which the district council has
not previously been noted, and was the initiative of Provost Leslie
Rosin, who is now chairman of Eastwood Festival Trust.
He said yesterday: ''It is vital that the public sector continues to
support and develop the arts and we hope Artsfeast will lay down the
foundations for an innovative arts strategy for the new local
authority.''
The full programme will not be launched until February 13, but four of
the outdoor events were revealed yesterday. A fireworks display and
concert featuring an augmented Scottish Chamber Orchestra will take
place on Sunday, April 16, in Eastwood Park.
The same stage will be used for a jazz concert with singer Carol Kidd
on Easter Monday.
The formal gardens of the National Trust's Greenbank House will be the
setting for a musical sculpture -- entitled Awakening -- commissioned
from composer Nicky Hind with funding by the Scottish Arts Council, and
on Saturday, April 22, Rouken Glen Park will be the stage for
Fablevision's community theatre work, involving 500 local people.
Festival director Michael Dale said ticket prices for all events would
be kept low to encourage families to attend. The top price for any event
will be #10, but nonetheless the festival hopes to generate #75,000 of
income through the box office.

It will have a massive impact on a key manufacturing sector in
Scotland
Adam Ingram
EXCLUSIVE
UP to 650 jobs at Rolls-Royce's East Kilbride plant face the axe
today. Most of those affected will be highly skilled engineers and
designers.
Senior executives have travelled north to unveil to the workforce
details of a drastic plan to rationalise Rolls-Royce's entire aero
engine design capability.
At worst, the whole engine design division at East Kilbride --
consisting of the people who created the Tay series engine for
Rolls-Royce -- will be wound up and its work transferred to Derby.
The transfer may be phased but the end result, it is thought, could be
the complete loss of one of Scotland's major engineering research,
development, and design centres of excellence.
The Lanarkshire complex will be left with the separate engine repair
and overhaul division, which employs around 800 people. That is not
affected by this rationalisation.
Last night, the local MP, Labour's Adam Ingram, warned of the
consequences. ''Clearly, I hope these fears are not borne out by events.
If they are, it will have a massive impact on a key manufacturing sector
in Scotland. If that happens, I will be seeking an urgent meeting with
the company at the highest possible level on behalf of the workforce.''
There was a hint of further rationalisation in the statement last
September by Rolls-Royce's chairman, Sir Ralph Robins, accompanying the
group's interim results.
''Investment in research and development, at #114m, was #5m lower as
the successful Trent programme moves towards its final stages. A further
reduction is expected in the second half,'' he said.
The Trent series, Rolls-Royce's most powerful engine, designed for the
A330 and the Boeing 777, was designed and developed at Derby. Now that
the engine is in the marketplace, the design teams in the Midlands are
underemployed.
Rolls-Royce's other major new engine, the BR700 series for regional
jets, has been developed through a joint venture, formed in 1990, with
BMW of Germany. It is, according to Jane's All the World's Aircraft,
regarded as a German company.
So if Rolls-Royce wants to rationalise its design effort and cut
costs, the obvious target is the East Kilbride operation, with its work
being transferred to the under-capacity Derby operation.
The Tay 600 series, found on BAe One-Elevens and Boeing 727s, was
designed and developed at East Kilbride. The initial versions were
certified in 1986, with the later 650 series first gaining approval in
1988.
There was brighter Scottish news on the aero front yesterday for
Prestwick, writes David Steele. An announcement is expected next week of
the long-awaited partnership between Jetstream Aircraft and the
Franco-Italian planemaker, Avions de Transport Regional (ATR).
As disclosed in The Herald last year, the two will embark on a joint
venture aimed at cornering certain parts of the turboprop market, which
has been cluttered by too many manufacturers serving too few customers.
The industry believes the two are ready to tie the knot and create a
company which will rationalise products and market them.
Speculation is also increasing that Avro, the regional jet
manufacturer, is likely to be brought into the joint venture, giving the
new consortium the widest range of regional aircraft on the market.
With the order book for the Jetstream 41 healthy, in stark contrast to
that for the larger Jetstream 61, it seems the Prestwick-based company
will have the whip hand in the smaller plane market but may have to give
up the 61 in favour of its competitor, ATR 72.
This would inevitably lead to redundancies, a fact which dismays local
politicians, but company sources are quick to point out that a
slimmed-down Jetstream operation in Ayrshire is better than none at all.
The troubled aviation industry has been viewing the planned merger
between Jetstream, a British Aerospace subsidiary, and ATR with interest
and sees it as a possible modern version of the successful Airbus
Industrie conglomerate.
It has already been dubbed ''Minibus'' by one observer.
Mr Peter Black, head of public affairs at Jetstream, said: ''It is no
secret that we have been talking to a number of manufacturers about
possible joint ventures. There is, however, no timetable in place for an
announcement of any kind at this stage.
''As far as redundancies are concerned, we have made it clear that we
cannot guarantee jobs in these difficult times for our industry.
''We can say that there are no plans for any change in employment
numbers and that the loss of jobs would not be a natural progression
from a joint venture.''

A COMMONS bid was made yesterday to ensure people convicted of serious
cruelty to animals would be banned auomatically from ever owning animals
again. ''This would go a long way towards stamping out a very serious
and malicious evil,'' Tory Harry Greenway told MPs. ''Millions of pets
are kept in Britain and thankfully most are loved and well cared for.
Sadly, this is not true for all companion animals.'' He was introducing
his Protection of Animals (Amendment) Bill, which received an unopposed
formal first reading, but stands little chance of becoming law.

THE Government last night narrowly avoided a humiliating Commons
defeat on their fishing policy. Helped by six Ulster Unionist MPs, they
managed a majority of nine.
The Unionists showed their influence in this now minority Government
House of Commons by lifting Mr Major's majority, which would have sunk
to just three, as two Conservative MPs and six of the Tory Euro rebels
who have lost the Party Whip voted with the Opposition.
Approval for the Government's success, in limiting the areas off
Britain's west coast in which more Spanish boats can fish from 1996, was
gained by just 310 votes to 301.
As the result was declared Labour left winger, Mr Dennis Skinner
(Bolsover), pointed accusingly at the bench where the Ulster Unionist
MPs were sitting. The Unionists also helped to beat off a Labour motion
calling the outcome of the EU fishery negotiations ''an unacceptable
threat to the long-term economic viability of fishing communities'' in
all parts of the UK. The Government won by 312-294, a majority of 18.
The Ulstermen's support was not cheaply won. Agriculture Minister, Mr
William Waldegrave, had to anticipate the ''framework document'' on the
future of Northern Ireland, still being negotiated by the British and
Irish Governments, to assure them that it would not contain any proposal
for a North-South maritime fisheries agency which would have powers over
fishermen in both the Province and the Republic. This took six of the
Unionists into the Government lobby though two still abstained and one
was absent.
Mr Waldegrave also more than doubled the amount of money the
Government will provide to pay fishermen for giving up fishing.
The vessel decommissioning scheme is being expanded from #25m over
three years by another #28m and Mr Waldegrave hinted that another #20m
or so could come later.
This did not prevent Mr Rupert Allason, MP for Torbay, voting against
the Government. He only recently regained the Party Whip after losing it
for failing to turn up for last year's confidence vote on Maastricht. He
may now lose it again. He was joined by the MP for St Ives, Mr David
Harris, whose criticism of the outcome of the fisheries negotiation is
long standing.
Six Tory MPs who have lost the Party Whip also voted against the
Government, unimpressed by assurances from Fisheries Minister, Mr
Michael Jack, that the new arrangements, which will see 40 more Spanish
boats fishing in new areas off Britain's west coast, will be strictly
policed. ''There will be no Spanish free-for-all,'' he said.
Labour spokesman, Dr Gavin Strang, called the new money a bribe to
make British fishermen tie up their boats so that the Spaniards could
catch their fish.
The debate and vote showed Tory divisions on Europe as deep as ever
and the Ulster Unionists making it clear that they have the power to
block Government initiatives on Northern Ireland they do not like.
Meanwhile, Tory rebels last night delivered what clearly amounted to a
further snub to John Major by announcing publication today of a
''mission statement'' setting out their views on Europe.
The move showed the rebels were prepared to act as a party within a
party -- but they strongly denied they were signalling an intention to
break away from the Conservative mainstream.
Eight of the nine Tory ''outcasts'' -- now without the party Whip
after an earlier Euro-protest -- are understood to have drawn up the
1000-word document which will be unveiled at a Westminster news
conference.
News of the launch came just hours before the Government faced another
embarrassing rebellion in the Commons over Spanish fishing rights.
The eight are said to be: Mr Tony Marlow, Mrs Teresa Gorman, Sir
Richard Body, Sir Teddy Taylor, Mr John Wilkinson, Mr Nicholas Budgen,
Mr Christopher Gill, and Mr Richard Shepherd. The other Tory without the
Whip, Mr Michael Carrtiss, has not been involved.
Sir Teddy, MP for Southend East, denied that the document was a
provocative step or that its contents amounted to an alternative Tory
manifesto.
''These are not in any sense conditions or demands,'' he said. ''This
is meant to be helpful. These are ideas which we believe are a possible
basis for the party to unite.
''There are real problems which cannot be avoided. We are presenting
ideas about the way they can be solved.''
Mr Gill, MP for Ludlow, said: ''To the extent that people know where
we are coming from, it is just useful to have a reference, a mission
statement if you like.''
Mr Major held out an olive branch to the group at the weekend when he
talked in terms of weeks rather than months before they would be allowed
back into the fold. However, he called for a show of loyalty in the
voting lobbies.
At a snap news conference on Monday at Downing Street -- to rally his
troops for battle at a time when the party is at its lowest poll ebb yet
-- he saw a ''road to unity'' on European policy and on bringing back
the Euro-rebels.
''It takes two to tango. The music has struck up. We'll see who takes
partners and when,'' the Prime Minister said.
He refused to put a timescale on their return and made it clear the
ball was now firmly in their court.
The rebels' policy document is understood to set out MPs' views that
the EU's Common Fisheries Policy should be abolished and that Britain
should keep tight control on its own foreign and defence policy.
It is also understood to refer to the need for a referendum on how
people want Britain to go forward in Europe and a resolute anti-single
currency stance.
MPs also refer to the row over live animal exports to Europe, saying
it is up to Agriculture Minister William Waldegrave to decide British
policy.

A YOUNG Scottish scientist was bounced off the walls and ceilings of
his apartment as the seven-storey building collapsed about him in the
Kobe earthquake.
Dr Brian Devlin, 28, a research chemist from Bishopbriggs, eventually
managed to crawl from his wrecked apartment and lead fellow residents to
safety after being trapped for seven hours.
Dr Devlin, who has been working in Kobe, managed to contact his family
for the first time yesterday afternoon to describe his ordeal after the
earthquake struck the west Japanese port city.
His mother, Veronica, 59, speaking in Bishopbriggs last night, said he
was still in deep shock.
''He said he woke up bouncing off the ceiling and off the walls. He
managed to get out of his bedroom, which has no windows, and crawled
along, using cushions to protect against the broken glass, to his front
door. He tried to open it but couldn't because so much stuff had fallen
down. The whole place had twisted and sunk.''
Dr Devlin eventually managed to escape from his fourth-floor apartment
by another door and made his way gingerly down to the second floor,
where he could go no further. The bottom two floors of the seven-storey
complex had collapsed.
''Other residents met up with him there,'' said Mrs Devlin. ''He has a
very good command of Japanese and he suggested they go back up onto the
roof of the building. From there, with the aid of a ladder, they got
down.
''He said if he had been on the other side of the building he would
have died. All the people on the other side were killed. The daughter of
the concierge lost her legs. They managed to get her out, but she lost
her legs.
''He could hardly speak to us because he was so emotional, because he
was in such shock. We are just so relieved he has come out alive. We
have been out to visit him and I knew exactly what his flat was like. I
just could hardly think about it. There are big concrete blocks
everywhere. I just tried not to think about what it would have been
like.''
Mrs Devlin said her son spent the night with elderly, injured people
in a school, then moved to a ballet school where he lay under a piano
cover for warmth.
He eventually met an American couple and their three children in the
streets. As he walked with them, he came across a colleague and went to
his house, from where he managed to reach his family.
He told his mother it was difficult to describe Kobe. ''He said it was
like hell. It was fire and destruction, disaster and death.''
His mother added that Dr Devlin had nothing but praise for the work of
the emergency services and had been surprised at criticism of their
efforts, as reported in the media.
Mrs Devlin said the family, which includes Dr Devlin's two brothers
and sister, would be holding a party to celebrate the news that he had
survived.
Dr Devlin has been in Japan for two years and has been working for the
Swiss pharmaceutical giant Ciba-Geigy. He was educated at Turnbull High
School in Bishopbriggs and took his PhD in chemistry at Heriot Watt
University.

Paris, Wednesday
CONSERVATIVE Prime Minister Edouard Balladur today declared his
candidacy for France's April-May presidential election in a statement
broadcast live to the nation.
The 65-year-old leader, citing his record in 21 months at the helm of
a centre-right Government, said: ''Today the first results are visible.
Our country is starting to recover. It is moving forward again.
''On this basis, we must now go further to prepare the future which
awaits us.''
His opening of the campaign in earnest with a message of economic
optimism was taken in its stride by the French financial markets, as the
announcement was widely expected.
Opinion polls show that Balladur, a Gaullist, is runaway favourite to
win a run-off on May 7, whether he faces fellow Gaullist rival Jacques
Chirac or a Socialist contender yet to be chosen.
Balladur has been helped by economic recovery from France's worst
post-war recession, although unemployment is still at a near-record
12.6% and consumer spending is sluggish.
Socialist leader Henri Emmanuelli later announced that he would seek
his party's nomination, and said that, despite the withdrawal of the
Left's most popular candidate, former European Commission President
Jacques Delors, he believed a Socialist could still win.
This raised the prospect of a bitter battle among three would-be heirs
to the mantle of Socialist President Francois Mitterrand, who retires in
May.
Former Culture Minister Jack Lang and former party leader Lionel
Jospin are also seeking the Socialist nomination.
As well as Chirac and Balladur, the conservative right field also
includes National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen and anti-Maastricht
crusader Philippe de Villiers.--Reuter.

From PATRICK BROGAN in Washington
THE O J Simpson trial finally gets down to business. After seven
months of legal manoeuvring and public posturing, the prosecution and
defence lawyers will make their opening statements to the jury today or
tomorrow, in what has become the show trial of the century.
The trial has long since burst the bounds of normal criminal
proceedings. Mr Simpson is charged with murdering his ex-wife and a
friend of hers last June, but the case has become a national obsession,
centred around race, celebrity, spouse abuse, and the corruption of
justice.
Court-TV will broadcast the trial live, day after day, for the months
it will last and CNN will subordinate every other news event to the
business of a Los Angeles courtroom.
The opening days' events will be carried live by the regular networks,
supplanting the usual soap-operas: this is better than any of them.
The Washington Post today had a huge headline in its Style section:
'O.D. ON O J'. We have, indeed, heard far too much of the legal
arguments, but now the real stuff resumes: and nothing else will matter,
for months.
The theme of the tabloid press and TV is that Mr Simpson is clearly
guilty and has used his fortune to buy the best legal talent available
to escape justice. According to this view, he will pay for it all by
selling a book (due next month), and after his acquittal, sell himself
in a TV special.
There have been impassioned arguments between black attorneys on both
sides, over whether the fact that a detective in the case uttered the
word ''nigger' 15 years ago can be used to discredit him. The fact that
Mr Simpson is black and his late wife white has been examined from every
angle in talk shows and will no doubt feature in court: the Othello
theme will be repeated.
Meanwhile, experts in domestic violence will use the case to prove how
dangerous wife-beating can be. In a major victory for the prosecution on
the eve of opening arguments, the judge ruled yesterday that allegations
that Mr Simpson beat his first wife, and abused Nicole throughout their
16 years together, may be used as evidence against him.
Mr Simpson was a sports hero who made himself over into a car rental
salesman and a supporting actor in comedy films: he is the most famous
American to be tried for his life since Fatty Arbuckle, the silent film
comic, in the Roaring Twenties.
The papers and the news shows have been dominated by the new
Republican Congress for the past few weeks. Now it is back to O J.

ROME: Italy's new Prime Minister, Lamberto Dini, claimed yesterday
that his ''government of experts'' could achieve its four-point
programme of reforms within a few months and then resign to make way for
early elections.
His remarks were a clear olive branch to the ''Freedom Alliance''
coalition of his predecessor Silvio Berlusconi, whose backing in
parliamentary confidence votes next week will be vital to the chances of
the Government surviving.
Berlusconi, ousted from office last month, insisted again yesterday
that support for Dini would come only in return for a firm commitment
that early elections would be held in June.
After his first Cabinet meeting, Dini said only President Scalfaro
could set an election date: but he added that his Cabinet of
professionals from outside Parliament would need only ''a few months''
to carry out its reforms before handing back its mandate. He added that
his Government did not believe it could replace political
parties.--Reuter.

MPs EXAMINING the dangers of nuclear proliferation have had briefings
from intelligence agents in Washington and Moscow but not from the
British secret service, it emerged at a Commons hearing yesterday.
The issue arose during a two-hour session in which Foreign Secretary
Douglas Hurd appeared before the Foreign Affairs Select Committee of
MPs.
Committee chairman, Tory MP David Howell, told Mr Hurd that members
realised the work of the British secret services was delicate but he
said: ''It does worry us.
''It is absurd when we have to rely on Mr (Sergie) Stepashin of the
former KGB to give us guidance as to what is going on.''
Mr Howell added: ''We are concerned that we have had briefings with
the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency) in Washington and the Federal
Counter Intelligence Service in Moscow. We wonder why we are denied one
in London.''
In response, Mr Hurd said a lot of the work of the British secret
service was ''very sensitive stuff'' but he would try to fill any
''gaps'' in the MPs' knowledge if they let him have details.
Mr Hurd pointed out that, in Britain, the intelligence services did
not have responsibility in the same way as the CIA in the US for
assessing potential threats. ''What happpens here is some of the
intelligence comes from the agencies. It is a field of huge importance
for our national security but they do not make the assessment. They make
contributions towards it,'' he said.

A SECOND union is backing Labour leader Tony Blair in his bid to
reform the party's constitution, calling for a new statement which backs
a ''strong mixed economy''.
The executive of the white-collar Manufacturing Science and Finance
union, which has 220,000 members affiliated to Labour, said it will
support a redrafted Clause 4, which commits the party to public
ownership of industry.
The executive has sent a statement to its members stating that Labour
should be committed to equality, social justice and workers' rights.
General secretary Roger Lyons said: ''Clause 4 has a central place at
the heart of our history but it is not enough to project the modern
Labour Party to a modern electorate.
''MSF's proposed new statement of principles sets out our democratic
socialist values, not just for the economy but in the workplace, for
equal rights and for the sort of society we want to create.''
Members of the shop workers' union Usdaw are being recommended by
their executive council to back Mr Blair's plans.
However the executive's recommendation could be overturned by the
union's annual conference which takes place just days before the April
29 special party conference on Clause 4.
In a branch circular, Usdaw general secretary Mr Garield Davies says
that in a mixed economy there was a place for both ''private and public
ownership, public and private enterprise and public and private
service''.

TRANSPORT Secretary Brian Mawhinney moved last night to reassure rail
passengers on the future of the through-ticketing service. However, in a
Commons debate on the railways, Dr Mawhinney was forced on to the back
foot over the Government's plans.
Shadow Transport Secretary Michael Meacher described Dr Mawhinney as a
''beached whale,'' powerless to change the plans by Rail Regulator John
Swift to severely cut the number of stations where through-ticketing
would be available.
At the end of the debate, the Labour attack over any curbs on
through-ticketing after rail privatisation was defeated by 317 votes to
282, a Government majority of 35.
However, Dr Mawhinney faced an angry House and a number of attempts by
Opposition MPs to intervene as he defended the Government line and
challenged Labour on what it would do with the railways if it ever came
to power.
He said: ''I expect operators to build on the current arrangements,
using the new technology available to provide a better ticket-retailing
service to passengers.
''They do not need to be told this. No-one tells the airline industry
how to retail its tickets, but it has developed sophisticated, flexible
and highly effective ticketing systems admirably suited to the needs of
its customers. I believe the privatised railway will do the same.''
The Minister said there was a widespread myth that all BR stations
provided a full range of ticketing facilties. Even now, ticket
availability at individual stations was restricted by limitations on
staff resources, fares information about remote journeys, and ticket
issuing equipment.
Dr Mawhinney posed six questions for Labour, demanding to know whether
they would renationalise the rail service, what compensation would be
offered to shareholders if they did, and how passenger services would be
brought back under state control.
If none of this happened, he wanted to know, what changes would be
made to the way the railways were run, how would Labour fulfil its
commitment to have more passengers and freight on the railways, and how
much would Labour invest in the railways.
Mr Meacher, roared on by MPs on his own side, said: ''The situation is
now clear. Ministers repeatedly denied there would be any reduction in
through-ticketing after privatisation. The regulator, on the other hand,
is determined to reduce core stations offering through-ticketing to
perhaps as few as only one in eight of Britain's 2000 stations, and you
are powerless to stop him.
''You, in all your splendid isolation and irrelevance, sit there like
a beached whale -- a monument to the crass ineptitude of a privatisation
that is fast running out of control.
''The fact is that you are totally unable to carry through the
commitment your predecessors have given and you have been totally
humiliated by what the regulator is doing.''
For the SNP, Transport spokesman Andrew Welsh said: ''Government
Ministers have given assurances that through-ticketing will be mandatory
and I can only hope the Government will keep to this promise. But past
experience of the Government's relationship with privatised services has
shown them less than willing to intervene in the interests of the
public. Rail privatisation is an example of ideology taken to
extremes.''

<TEXT>
LABOUR MPs rounded on party leader Tony Blair at a private meeting in
Westminster yesterday, attacking the direction of the party's education
policy and his decision to send his son to an opted-out school.
Normally loyal MPs demanded the leadership take a tougher stand
against grant-maintained schools and called for their abolition,
stressing they were incompatible with Labour backing for comprehensive
education.
The confrontation came at a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party.
Worryingly for the leadership, it involved Blair supporters rather than
hardline left-wingers more accustomed to boat rocking.
The criticism was reportedly led by former Labour deputy leader Roy
Hattersley, a defender of comprehensive schooling, who had requested a
meeting to discuss education policy. He demanded opt-out schools be
scrapped and attacked the current Labour stance on school league tables.
Other MPs, including Newport West MP Paul Flynn, went on to challenge
Mr Blair's decision to send his son to the grant-maintained London
Oratory School in Fulham.
One MP said: ''I was fairly surprised at how fierce the criticism was
because, whatever people are saying privately, you don't expect it to be
aired in the open.''
Mr Flynn said: ''What I said was heartfelt and passionate. I had
written to him (Mr Blair) on the subject previously.''
A spokesman for Mr Blair insisted that other MPs at the meeting had
supported the leadership's stance on schools. ''Several spoke about the
need not to get hooked on this agenda,'' he said. ''The issue is about
standards in education, not about abolition or where Labour MPs send
their children.''

PRISONS chief Derek Lewis insisted yesterday that the number of jail
break-outs had fallen dramatically despite the Whitemoor and Parkhurst
scandals.
Escapes had fallen by 40% over the past 21 months, Mr Lewis said.
Among the most serious category A prisoners, there had been six escapes,
up from none the year before and two in 1992-93.
Mr Lewis, director-general of the prison service, was questioned over
the escape attempt by armed IRA men from Whitemoor, Cambridgeshire, last
September, and the escape of three ''lifers'' from Parkhurst, on the
Isle of Wight, this month.
''They are a failure of our first duty of holding prisoners,
particularly those who represent the greatest risk to the public,'' he
said.
In two hours of questions by MPs on the Commons Home Affairs Select
Committee, he put up a vigorous defence of the overall record of the
service.
He said the highly-publicised Whitemoor and Parkhurst cases had to be
put into context. He set out a range of measures taken by the service to
increase security and combat the drugs menace.
Mr Lewis came under savage questioning for his role in the decision to
remove Parkhurst governor John Marriott from his post.
Home Secretary Michael Howard told the Commons earlier this month that
Mr Marriott was being ''temporarily transferred'' to duties at other
prisons, pending a full investigation over the escape.
Labour MPs suggested Mr Lewis had decided to speed up the removal of
Mr Marriott after a meeting with Mr Howard.
They suggested he was influenced by Mr Howard, who was due to make a
Commons statement on the Parkhurst escape on the afternoon of their
meeting.
Mr Chris Mullin, MP for Sunderland South, said Mr Howard had wanted to
be able to ''deliver Mr Marriott's head''.
Mr Gerald Bermingham, MP for St Helens South, claimed there had been
''political interference''.
Mr Lewis denied the claims and insisted of Mr Marriott: ''His movement
implies no judgment about him or his performance or his actions.''
Mr Lewis went on to say that because of the Whitemoor case he had told
Mr Howard he would not accept the #30,000 bonus due to him.
Asked why he had done this if his overall record was as good as he
claimed, Mr Lewis replied: ''I did it because I have overall
responsibility for the prison service.''
Committee chairman Sir Ivan Lawrence, Tory MP for Burton, asked if the
catalogue of recent prison disasters was merely ''bad luck''.
Mr Lewis said the number of prison escapes had to be brought down
further, but insisted Whitemoor and Parkhurst were not signs of a
general fall in standards.
A programme was under way to upgrade security arrangements for the
less dangerous category C inmates, with perimeter fences being
re-inforced and replacement of dormitories with cells.
Firmer measures were also being taken to prevent escapes by prisoners
under escort -- going from one prison to another, or to court and back.
He admitted drugs were a very serious problem in prisons, but said the
service was on the verge of launching a major initiative to fight the
menace.
Mr Lewis denied allegations of low morale among prison staff, saying
most officers were not dissatisfied or unhappy.
However, there was uncertainty in the service because of the changes
taking place and the service had been in the media spotlight and
subjected to external criticisms, he said.

THE Government last night staved off an embarrassing Commons defeat
when it rejected a Labour attack over the controversial deal increasing
Spanish fishing access to British waters -- despite losing support from
some Tories, including Euro-rebels.
MPs voted 310 to 301, a Government majority of nine, backing its
amendent welcoming the securing of the exclusion of Spanish vessels from
the Irish Sea and the Bristol Channel and the limiting of Spanish
fishing within the rest of the Irish Box and special curbs west of
Scotland.
Minutes earlier, the Commons rejected by 312 to 294, a Government
majority of 18, the Opposition's motion after Agriculture and Fisheries
Minister William Waldegrave offered fishermen better compensation for
taking boats out of service.
Some Ulster Unionists backed the Government and some did not vote.
Labour said European Union agreement ''presents an unacceptable threat
to the long-term economic viability of fishing communities in England,
Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland and places an unsustainable
pressure upon the fish stocks in these already sensitive waters.''
Defeat would have had no practical legal effect, but it would have
been a severe embarrassment.
The division lists showed Tories voting against the Government's
amendment were Mr David Harris (St Ives) and Mr Rupert Allason (Torbay).
Leading Euro-sceptic Bill Cash (Stafford) did not vote. Also not voting
were Mr Toby Jessel (Twickenham) and Mr Hugh Dykes (Harrow East).
None of the Tories without the Whip backed the Government's amendment.
Of these nine, those who voted against the Government's amendment were:
Sir Richard Body (Holland with Boston), Mr Christopher Gill (Ludlow),
Mrs Teresa Gorman (Billericay), Mr Tony Marlow (Northampton North), Mr
Richard Shepherd (Aldridge-Brownhills), Sir Teddy Taylor (Southend East)
and Mr John Wilkinson (Ruislip-Northwood). Mr Nicholas Budgen
(Wolverhampton South-West) and Mr Michael Carttiss (Great Yarmouth) did
not vote.
In a desperate bid to avoid defeat, the Government announced that it
was more than doubling the money available for the decommissioning
scheme which pays fishermen to take their boats out of action.
Mr Waldegrave also sought to keep the Ulster Unionist MPs on side by
promising that the framework document on the future of Northern Ireland
now being prepared by the British and Irish Governments will not contain
a proposal for a North-South maritime fisheries agency with executive
powers over fishermen of both the Republic and the Province.
Mr Waldegrave said the decommissioning scheme to which the Government
has already committed #25m over three years would be increased by
another #28m.
He also promised an increase in British naval activity to monitor
fishing after 1996 when 40 more Spanish fishing vessels will be allowed
into many areas off the west coast of Scotland and England.
Dr Gavin Strang, Shadow Agriculture Minister, said the right reason
for such a scheme was to balance fishing capacity with limited fish
stocks. ''Our fishermen should not be asked to scrap their fishing boats
to enable Spanish fishermen to catch their fish.''
He called on MPs to join Labour in censuring the Government for
failing to represent the interests of UK fishermen in the recent EU
negotiations.
Dr Strang said Labour wanted wide ranging discussions on the future of
the Common Fisheries Policy but told one of the Tory rebels, Mrs Gorman,
-- that the Opposition could not go along with her wish that Britain
should come out of the CFP altogether.
Mr Harris announcing he would vote against the Government, said: ''I
do not believe it will change the situation, but at some time I think
MPs have to make a stand on an issue. I have got to make a stand now.''
He said there had been a ganging-up against the UK by other European
states, egged on by the Commission. ''Frankly we were skewered in
Brussels in December''.
Britain had to get some control over such matters. He said he would be
tempted to withdraw from the Common Fisheries Policy, but realised this
would not be possible.
Mr Waldegrave made a vigorous defence of his conduct of the
negotiations, claiming that his position had been weakened by
concessions made by the Labour Government in the 1970s. He claimed to
have won gains for Scottish fishermen in the last few hours of the
marathon talks.
''We got nearly two-thirds of what we wanted,'' he said, ''when we
could have come back with nothing at all.'' The Spaniards knew it was
not a bad deal for Britain, he said.
SNP leader Mr Alex Salmond said: ''In this situation, to now offer the
long-demanded decommissioning money is raising the white flag of
surrender over our fishing fleet. Perhaps the Government have in mind a
one-for-one swop -- one of our boats out of the industry for every
Spanish boat into our waters.''
He said the Spaniards would now be fishing quite legally for key
stocks west of Scotland. ''Now that the Spanish Armada are in it will be
well nigh impossible to get them out.''
Mr Jim Wallace, for the Liberal Democrats, said extra cash for
decommissioning ''is making money available to lay up British vessels to
allow more Spanish vessels into our waters''.
He said because of swops between Spain, Belgium and France, Spanish
vessels would now be able to fish for cod, whiting and haddock in areas
where they were unable to do so before.
Mr Phil Gallie (Ayr -- Con) said British Ministers had gone to
Brussels with a hand of twos and threes. They had not turned up trumps
but their determined and dogged efforts had achieved more than many
expected when they departed.
However, he expressed concern that French and Belgian fishermen had
already arranged swops with the Spaniards for fishing rights off the
West coast of Scotland and said that the operation of the quotas and
landings would have to be strictly controlled.
Dr Norman Godman (Greenock and Port Glasgow -- Lab) said he was the
son of a fisherman and fishergirl who had a brother fishing off the
north Norwegian coast ''who is dependent for his livelihood on this
lousy, rotten Common Fisheries Policy.'' He said it would have to be
dramatically reformed if the Scottish fishing industry which was an
important part of the nation's culture, was not to disappear.
Mr Elliot Morley, winding up for Labour, welcomed the extra #28m, but
added: ''It is regretable that such announcements are forced out of the
Government by an Oppositon motion and threats from their own back
benchers.''
He added: ''We need a Government that is prepared to stand up for the
industry in the same way other other governments do.''
Fisheries Minister of State Michael Jack said the Government took the
issue of ''playing by the rules'' very seriously.
There would be no ''no-go areas'' as far as monitoring the activities
of Spanish boats was concerned.
Six United Ulster Unionists backed the Government's amendment: Mr Roy
Beggs (Antrim East), Mr Clifford Forsythe (Antrim South), Mr James
Molyneaux (Lagan Valley), Mr William Ross (Londonderry East), the Rev
Martin Smyth (Belfast South) and Mr Cecil Walker (Belfast North).

THE Daily Mail launches a Scottish edition today following a five-year
agreement with Caledonian Newspapers, publisher of The Herald and
Evening Times, to use its printing facilities in Glasgow.
The newspaper, the Scottish Daily Mail, employs a team of 12
journalists based in offices provided by Caledonian at its headquarters
in Albion Street, Glasgow.
In the first of a series of promotions, 600,000 free copies of the
newspaper will be distributed throughout Scotland today in what is
believed to be the biggest free distribution of a newspaper in Britain.
Other promotions and a major advertising campaign will follow in a bid
to increase circulation of the Daily Mail from its current average daily
sale of 35,000 in Scotland. The new title is also expected to have a
reduced cover price for an unspecified period.
Commenting on the launch, Mr Guy Zitter, managing director of the
Daily Mail, said: ''We have made a serious long-term commitment to
Scotland and we are confident that we can gain a major increase in
circulation north of the Border.
''By combining the very best of the Daily Mail with a significant
element of Scottish news and sport, we believe we have a very strong and
very different product to offer.''
The launch of the Scottish Daily Mail is the latest bid by
London-based publishers, such as Mr Rupert Murdoch's News International,
to boost sales in Scotland where their circulation has been weak.
The Scottish Sun has almost doubled its sales to 400,000 in
competition with the Daily Record since its was launched seven years ago
and two other Murdoch titles, the Times and Today, also sought to
improve Scottish sales last year.
The Scottish Daily Mail's biggest rival in Scotland is likely to be
the Scottish Daily Express, which is also based in Glasgow.
The tabloid Daily Mail outsells the Daily Express throughout Britain
with a circulation of 1.75 million against the Daily Express's 1.3
million but loses out north of the Border where its 35,000 sales compare
with the Daily Express's 135,000.
Mr Zitter said: ''What we have now is a Scottish edition of a national
newspaper and I would expect to see 16 page changes a night.
''We don't have to sell that many copies for the exercise to be
economically viable but we are treating Scotland deadly seriously and I
would reckon that anything less than 70,000 average daily net sales is a
failure and I'll give myself six months to do that.''

POLICE were yesterday accused of brutality after officers in riot gear
used truncheons, boots, and fists to break up a peaceful demonstration
against live animal exports.
They were accused of going ''totally over the top'' in moving elderly
people, young mothers, and children who were objecting to sheep being
shipped from the Essex port of Brightlingsea.
Women were dragged from a sit-down protest by their hair and officers
lashed out at any resistance -- although injuries were mainly slight.
Most of the protesters were local residents, and Brightlingsea mayor
Ric Morgan is to ask police chiefs why they adopted such aggressive
tactics.
''The level of police response was totally over the top and
unjustified and I shall want to meet with the police and our MP Bernard
Jenkins about what happened here today,'' he said. ''I saw nothing but a
peaceful protest.''
Police said they had to break up the demonstration in the interests of
public safety because exporter Roger Mills intended to get lorries
through come what may.
Protests against exports were also mounted yesterday in Shoreham, west
Sussex -- scene of violent clashes last week -- Grimsby on Humberside,
and King's Lynn, Norfolk.
In Shoreham, 250 demonstrators failed to stop lorries filled with
sheep and calves getting to a ship after being outnumbered by a huge
police presence.
The Brightlingsea confrontation began at 8am yesterday, when four
lorries containing 1600 sheep, escorted by nine police vans and 250
officers in riot gear, approached the dockside.
Some had side-handled truncheons already drawn as they approached the
500-strong crowd.
Mr Mills plans to move more lorries through the town today and
residents are vowing to continue to block him. More protesters are
expected at first light for another confrontation.
During the 45-minute struggle, demonstrators were dragged aside and
parked cars were bounced out of the way as the convoy drew nearer to the
dock.
Police said only two arrests were made, for minor public order
offences, but Maria Wilby, of Brightlingsea Against Live Exports,
claimed she had received 200 complaints of assault by police.
''There were mothers with toddlers and schoolchildren taking part,''
she said. ''Some of them were dragged out by the hair with their
children screaming.''
Mrs Anona Meade, 44, whose husband Brian sits on the Colchester
magistrates' bench, said she was assaulted as she took part in the
protest with her 15-year-old daughter Kirsty.
''I have always supported the British police but today they jackbooted
their way through people who were doing nothing at all,'' she said.
Mr Markham denied his officers were a riot squad but said they were
specially trained in crowd control.
''I have a duty to keep open the Queen's Highway and to allow anyone
to carry on his lawful business. It is very difficult to do,'' he said.
* East Midlands Airport near Nottingham has refused a Yorkshire
businessman permission to fly live calves from the airport to the
continent.

A MAN punched his 72-year-old mother in the face when she refused to
give him a cigarette.
Paul Harrison, 30, was ordered to pay his mother #250 compensation at
Edinburgh Sheriff Court yesterday.
Sheriff Peter McNeill, QC, also ordered him to do 100 hours of
community service.
Harrison, of Redgauntlet Terrace, Edinburgh, had earlier admitted
grabbing his mother, shaking her, and punching her in the face on
December 27.
Depute-fiscal Alastair Carmichael told the court that Harrison came
home after a night's drinking and demanded a cigarette.
His mother refused and he attacked her, leaving her bleeding from the
nose and mouth.
Solicitor Nigel Beaumont said Harrison completely lost control.
''He is disgusted with himself,'' he said.

A MOTHER told a court yesterday how her five children were all in the
back of her boyfriend's Ford Escort when it crashed into a petrol tanker
killing her 11-year-old son.
Miss Margaret Williamson, 35, of Summerfield Avenue, Dundee, said the
car, driven by her 28-year-old boyfriend Mr Steven Bracey, crossed on to
the wrong side of the road and crashed into the tanker as they travelled
south on the A92 Montrose to Arbroath Road on October 5 last year.
She was giving evidence in Arbroath Sheriff Court at the trial of
Bracey who is charged with causing the death of 11-year-old John
Williamson by dangerous driving.
Miss Williamson was in the passenger seat of the car. She told the
court: ''There was a big articulated lorry and all of a sudden we were
on the wrong side of the road.
''All I heard was a big bang and that was it.''
She added that Mr Bracey was travelling at 40 miles per hour when the
accident happened.
Earlier, the driver of the tanker, Mr Robert Taylor, 49, of Bridge of
Don, Aberdeenshire, said Mr Bracey's car had returned to its own side of
the road, hit a crash barrier, and then spun round before colliding with
the front of his lorry.

STORMS which lashed Scotland's west coast have destroyed Millport Pier
for a second time, delivering a major blow to the economy of the Isle of
Cumbrae. It was reopened after a local campaign less than three years
ago.
The wooden pier which enables thousands of visitors to land from the
Waverley paddle steamer and other leisure craft each year was rebuilt at
a cost of #600,000 after falling into disrepair.
District councillor and local businessman, Mr Sandy Morton, said: ''I
was close to tears when I saw the pier at first light, as so much work
has been done by so many people into putting it right.''
Locals were left to pick up the pieces after a two-hour spell of gales
and high tides early yesterday. Waves crashed over the sea defences of
the town's main street and dozens of shops and homes were flooded by
seawater and battered by debris.
When the sea rose, paving stones were ripped up and hurled across the
road, damaging property, and leaving gaping holes. As dawn broke and 14
extra firefighters arrived to boost the four volunteers who had worked
through the night rescuing local people and pumping out flooded areas,
the full extent of the damage became clear.
The pier, which had been submerged by the crashing seas, was bent and
buckled and the thick beams smashed and hurled about, with pieces lying
hundreds of yards away on the seashore. The pier offices were wrecked,
windows smashed, and walls knocked down.
Locals who had tried to stem the onslaught began to clear up piles of
sand and debris which had gathered as the water subsided. Aided by the
fire service and Cunninghame District Council workers, they prepared
defences for a possible repeat of the storms. The highest tide of the
year is predicted for early next week.
Mr Morton toured the area and pledged that everything possible would
be done to put the damage right in time for the holiday season.
He said: ''I understand that the pier is insured and I will be
checking with council officials exactly what the position is. I cannot
praise the fire service and council workers highly enough for the effort
they have put in.
''I am confident that the damage can be repaired and that the pier
will be ready for the summer.''
Mr Luigi Giorgetti, owner of the Ritz Cafe, told how he tried to hold
back the water from his premises. ''I was standing holding a sheet over
the door and the water was lapping into my waders. By this time the
power had gone and it was black except for the moonlight.
''I saw a huge wave gathering and knew the water would come over. It
did and I eventually gave up the fight. The one happy note of the night
was when my wife Angela gave me a whisky through a straw to keep my
spirits up.''
Mr Peter Hall and his wife Mary, both in their eighties, awoke to find
their Clyde Street home flooded and a kitchen cabinet floating towards
them.
The retired welder said: ''I knew the weather was rough, but this was
a shock. We have also lost the back wall, which was rebuilt after the
last storm.''
Mrs Joan Campbell, of Crichton Street, sweeping up piles of sand and
debris which had gathered in her close, said: ''I was warned by my son
that the sea was rising into the street. We went out to find it feet
deep and lapping in the front door.''
Assistant Divisional Officer David Morrison of Strathclyde Fire
Brigade said: ''We have been involved in checking the welfare of the
elderly and families, as well as pumping out some premises. We will wait
for the next high tide before standing down.''
The origins of the Old Pier at Millport date from 1833. Between 1986
and 1992 no large ships could berth there because of the dangerous
condition of the pier. Their absence provoked a vigorous ''lifeline''
campaign by islanders with support from holidaymakers around the world.
The pier had been taken over by Strathclyde region when it was set up
in 1975, but the authority refused to provide the hundreds of thousands
of pounds needed for comprehensive repairs.
Despite being offered the structure for just #1, Cunninghame district
was equally reluctant to meet such a bill until grant aid of #400,000
was made available by Highlands and Islands Enterprise.
The main artery to Cumbrae is now the Caledonian MacBrayne route from
Largs Pier to Cumbrae Slip, a few miles from Millport, but re-opening of
the Old Pier provided an additional boost for the island's tourist
trade, with calls three times a week in July and August by the Waverley.
A spokesman for Waverley Excursions said: ''This is a major blow to
the island and to our company. At the Glasgow September holiday weekend
we carried 800 passengers on one night into Millport for the town's
annual illuminations.''
In Oban, a roof was blown off a building, landing on and badly
damaging three cars. High tides and strong winds caused problems on the
town's esplanade.
Thousands of electricity customers throughout the Highlands were
blacked out as the gale brought down power lines. Engineers fought
through the night to restore services as gusts of up to 90mph were
reported in parts of the region.
More than 1500 electricity users were left without power around Oban,
Campbeltown, and the Mull of Kintyre. Around 1000 households in
Stornoway and 200 in Wick had their supplies cut, but were due to be
restored last night. Another 250 customers were hit in Orkney.
The storms also kept thousands of skiers and hillwalkers off the
mountains. The Nevis Range ski centre near Fort William was stormbound
and forced to close as winds reached 80mph. Gusts of up to 70pmh also
closed the Cairngorm ski centre.
I was close to tears when I saw the pier at first light, as so much
work has been done by so many people into putting it right

<HEADLINE>Norway's CSA demands #3500 arrears from Scottish father</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>980287780</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
NORWAY'S equivalent of the Child Support Agency is pursuing a Scottish
father for #3500 in arrears on the maintenance for two of his three
children.
Mr Robert Smith, 44, a nursing college lecturer from Montrose,
Tayside, has less than a month to find the arrears and begin paying 18%
of his salary to the upkeep of his children, who live in Norway with his
ex-wife.
Mr Smith, who earns #23,800 a year, says he faces financial ruin,
unless he allows his ex-wife's new husband to adopt his children.
''Of course that's a fairly awful thing, to have to lose my parental
rights,'' he said.
In 1991, Mr Smith separated from his wife, who took their daughter
Rebecca, 14, and son Daniel, 9, to live in Norway in 1993 to be with her
intended second husband. Nathan, their 12-year-old son, lives with Mr
Smith.
Until his wife's departure, Mr Smith paid #300 monthly towards the
children's upkeep.
Before his wife left, the couple drew up a document, agreed in court,
which said that neither of them would make a claim in respect of the
children.
Mr Smith is due to remarry in March and his future wife has a son.
Norway and the UK are signatories of the Hague Convention which
provides for the recovery of child support payments.
Mr Smith said: ''It seems a foreign Government can come here and
bankrupt me at will. I am totally defenceless.''
Before Christmas, sheriff officers, acting for the child maintenance
division of the Norwegian National Insurance Office called at his home.
He said: ''The documents said the action was raised in June and
demanded retrospective payments from then, plus 18% of my salary monthly
-- about #360 a month.
''It came out of the blue. I had been given no warning or chance to
begin paying, even if I could.''
Mr Smith has written to the British and Norwegian authorities to
protest but has received no response so far.
His MP, Mr Andrew Welsh, the member for Angus East, said it was
unusual for a foreign government to be able to overturn a Scottish legal
agreement.
He said: ''This seems extremely unfair and if there is no reciprocal
mechanism I will be tackling the Government about it.''

MR Major is promising fresh measures for Scotland to counter Labour's
devolution plans, proposals which he says today will cost every Scot
another #6 a week in tax.
He is determined, he says, to address the ''frustration of Scottish
opinion'', adding ''we should examine how to remove it, not set up
something that would be harmful to Scotland and damage the rest of the
UK.''
In an interview with the Daily Mail, he also insists a Scottish
parliament, able to raise an extra 3p in the pound, would drive out
foreign and English investment, and Scottish Secretary Ian Lang is now
committed by his Prime Minister to find a more clearly defined
alternative to Labour's devolution plans.

THE future of Radio 1 presenter Chris Morris looked uncertain
yesterday after Sir Jimmy Savile said he was suing the station over a
spoof announcement of his death.
The Christmas Day broadcast by Morris caused an outcry and the BBC
station was flooded with telephone calls.
Radio 1 received a letter yesterday from Sir Jimmy's London solicitors
Biddle and Co seeking substantial damages for ''needless distress''.
It complained that Sir Jimmy's Christmas was ruined by the flood of
calls he had to deal with from the press and public.
Morris was suspended for two weeks last year after suggesting that Mr
Michael Heseltine, the President of the Board of Trade, was dead.
However, Radio 1 yesterday refused to comment on whether or not Morris
would be sacked.
''Our lawyers have received a letter from Sir Jimmy's lawyers so it's
all in the hands of the legal department,'' a spokesman said.
Morris is not a Radio 1 regular but he does occasional series for the
station.
Sir Jimmy was annoyed by the spoof announcement, especially when
hospitals with which he is associated were also inundated with calls.
''The contents of the broadcast were really sickening and
disgraceful,'' Sir Jimmy's solicitor, Mr David Hooper, said.
He also complained that the BBC had failed to apologise properly for
the fake announcement and that it was trying to play the incident down.

MORE than half of Scots are concerned Europe has too much power over
member states and there is strong opposition to a single currency but,
in a referendum, a majority of two to one would vote to stay in the EU.
These are the key findings of a poll carried out by System Three for
The Herald.
It shows a surprising degree of anti-European sentiment among SNP
voters, given that the party swept to its highest yet share of the poll
in last year's European elections.
Some 53% of Scots would vote to stay in Europe in a referendum,
according to the poll but 26% would vote to leave. It came as no
surprise that 31% of Conservatives oppose EU membership but 33% of SNP
voters were also opposed.
The finding was immediately dismissed by the SNP leadership as being a
reflection of the wording of the question, which referred to British
membership of the EU and would create a negative response among those
who want to see an independent Scotland in Europe.
However, the vast majority of those questioned consider themselves
Scots, with almost no-one defining themselves as European.
Mr Kenneth Munro, the European Commission's head of representation in
Scotland, said he was heartened that the Scottish people recognised
their future lies in the EU.
The percentage of SNP voters who say they would vote in favour of
remaining in the EU in a referendum is the lowest of all four parties at
47%. Leader Alex Salmond blamed this on the form of the question. ''In a
poll which shows that 78% of people in Scotland see themselves as 'Scots
first' -- a figure that rises to 94% among SNP voters -- it is hardly
surprising that a set of questions entirely about British attitudes to
Europe gets a mixed response.''
Labour's Scottish secretary Jack McConnell said the strong support for
Europe represented a sea-change from public opinion of 20 years ago, and
he said the figures for SNP voters undermined their independence in
Europe platform.
Scottish Conservative chairman Sir Michael Hirst said the public's
view on remaining in the EU but restricting the powers of Brussels
matched Conservative policy.
Scottish Liberal Democrat European spokesman Charles Kennedy said:
''The general sentiment is clearly a pro-Euopean one and the headline
figures are much more favourably pro-European than they were 20 years
ago . . .''

LIFE had not handed Andy Paliunovas many aces until yesterday. The
73-year-old handyman endured Nazi forced labour camps and does not know
if his family whom he last saw 50 years ago are alive.
However, yesterday his world changed when he won #2,326,792 on the
pools.
Lithuanian-born Mr Paliunovas, who lives on a basic pension in a tiny
flat on a Gloucester industrial estate, scooped the Littlewoods jackpot
-- the biggest pools prize yet paid to one person.
He last saw his mother, three brothers, and four sisters just before
the Nazis deported him from his native Lithuania during the Second World
War.
Speaking with the aid of an interpreter as his English becomes shaky
when he is excited, he said the Germans took him captive while he was
working in a metal factory in his home village of Legcei in Lithunia. He
was sent to a factory in Stuttgart, Germany, and forced to work there
for four years.
He arrived in Britain as a displaced person in 1948. After moving
around England, Mr Paliunovas eventually settled in Gloucester, where he
worked as a storeman and security officer. Now retired, he still acts as
a handyman for the security company and stays in their flat rent-free.
A few months ago, he suffered a personal loss when a friend he had
known for 40 years died.
Mr Paliunovas said he was happy in Britain and had no plans to return
to his native Lithuania to find his family, although he missed them.
''What's the point?'' he said.
The bachelor, who still holds a Lithuanian passport, said he could not
believe it when a Littlewoods representative called at his flat to say
he had won a ''substantial amount'' for his 60p stake.
''I couldn't take it all in. I like football but I never check my
coupon. It was a shock to realise I had a winning line,'' he said.
Mr Paliunovas, who received his cheque from TV and radio personality
Gloria Hunniford at a presentation in London, said: ''I would like a
bungalow in Gloucester and a little garden with some flowers.
''I like dogs so perhaps I would have a little dog and look forward to
a little luxury for the rest of my life. I've never had a holiday. I
hear Jamaica's nice but I've never been in a plane in my life. It will
be a new experience for me.''
His friend, Mr Bernie Polson, who works for the security company,
said: ''Andy lost his friend of 40 years, Willy, a few months ago, so
now we make sure he's all right. He asked us to share his day in London
with him and we're honoured he thinks that much of us.''
Mr Polson said he fully expected Mr Paliunovas to keep on working --
by Friday, he would be pushing a broom around the estate. He added: ''I
only wish he could have won this earlier in his life. Then he would have
had more time to enjoy it.''
Littlewoods called it a ''classic pools win''. A spokesman said: ''He
has had a very hard and traumatic life and now he is going to have a
little luxury. I think he is going to enjoy himself.'' The previous
record for an individual win, netted by a Hereford lorry driver last
August, was #2,293,110.

A RETIRED RAF officer told yesterday of his ''fury'' at the Army's
failure to protect his son from bullying which was ''way outside normal
mess behaviour''.
Mr David Green, a former wing commander, told the High Court of his
anger on hearing how his son Alastair, then 19, was victimised by fellow
officers in the 7th Royal Horse Artillery.
Mr Green was giving evidence in his son's damages claim over mental
breakdowns which he suffered 10 years ago, allegedly as a result of
being picked on at his barracks in Aldershot, Hampshire.
It is claimed that Mr Alastair Green, a second lieutenant on a
short-term commission, was stripped naked and jeered at by other
officers who nicknamed him Ten-Inch because of the size of his penis.
On one occasion, the court was told, the teenager was forceably
stripped and tied to a ceremonial cannon with a rose between his
buttocks.
Mr David Green said that when he served in the 1960s, the RAF was
actually getting rid of such activity ''regarding it as a totally
out-dated way of knocking somebody down to size and building them up in
military training''.
Mr Alastair Green, now 29, teaches English in Japan, where he lives
with his Japanese wife and nine-month-old son.
He is suing the Ministry of Defence and 10 named officers for damages
for psychological injuries and loss of career prospects.
The MoD denies failing to maintain adequate discipline and the
individual defendants deny bullying or involvement in any of the alleged
incidents.
Mr Green said that after his son's breakdown: ''I was convinced that
the son who had left me as a robust, intelligent, and promising young
man and came back having totally lost all his confidence had suffered at
the hands of the Army''.
The hearing continues today.

THE president of An Comunn Gaidhealach was reading a letter saying his
director, Mr Donald MacLean, was accepting his offer of a new job at a
higher salary when the association's new chief executive suspended Mr
MacLean, it was claimed yesterday.
Mr MacLean was dismissed for alleged gross misconduct relating to the
purchase of jewellery and a word processor and his alleged mismanagement
of the 1993 National Mod in Airdrie.
The industrial tribunal in Stornoway, which is hearing Mr MacLean's
appeal for unfair dismissal, resumed yesterday after adjourning on
Tuesday as unsuccessful attempts were made by the parties to come to an
agreement.
Mr MacLean spoke of the events of January 14 last year when Mr Donald
John MacSween, four days after taking up the newly created post of chief
executive, had suspended him.
Mr MacSween had called a meeting at An Comunn's Stornoway office to
discuss the substantial losses at the Airdrie Mod. President Donald
MacRitchie and the past president, Mr Donald John MacIver, were also
present.
Mr MacLean said: ''Mr MacSween was walking about in an agitated
manner. I had just given Mr MacRitchie a letter from my union saying
that I was accepting the offer of the job as arts director subject to
certain conditions. He was reading this when Mr MacSween told me, 'Owing
to the current position of An Comunn's finances, I suspend you today.
Clear your desk.'
''It was a bombshell. I said it would be impossible for me to clear my
desk that day. I had been there for 16 years and had a lot of personal
belongings. I didn't even have the car. I asked if Mr MacSween had the
authority to suspend me. I got an embarrassed look from Mr MacIver and a
shrug from Mr MacRitchie.''
He said one of the reasons given for his dismissal had been his
mismanagement of the Airdrie Mod fringe, which lost #26,000 (An Comunn
had allowed for #12,000), but he told the tribunal Mr MacRitchie had
said that he was thinking of resigning because of the loss.
Mr MacLean added: ''This was in November, 1993. When I arrived at a
hotel in Inverness, I was met by a very worried president and cashier
saying that the fringe was going to lose #20,000. They asked me to get
in touch with Billy Kelly (the fringe director). I phoned him and he
completely refuted that.''
Mr MacLean said he was not aware of any fingers being pointed at him.
Mr MacRitchie had appeared to be pointing the finger at himself.
However, Mr MacRitchie, when asked if he had talked of resigning at
the meeting, replied: ''I may well have made that statement. I say that
every year.'' He did not accept that Mr MacLean had persuaded him not to
resign and said that, at one point, Mr MacLean had admitted he had been
responsible for the Airdrie losses.

<TEXT>
LABOUR'S defence spokesman, Dr David Clark, yesterday accused the
Government of ignoring the plight of hundreds of veterans said to be
suffering from Gulf war syndrome.
Dr Clark also condemned as ''unacceptable'' the continuing refusal of
Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind to meet a delegation of veterans to
discuss the issue.
Armed Forces Minister, Mr Nicholas Soames counter claimed that Dr
Clark had declined an invitation last October for a full MoD briefing on
the controversy.
Last night, the all-party Commons Defence Committee announced that it
is to question Ministry of Defence officials and Gulf war veterans to
find out more about the syndrome.
The committee will focus on what action the MoD has taken to deal with
the problem, rather than the medical background.
Symptoms are said to include gross fatigue, hair loss, kidney
disorders, nightmares, depression, severe headaches, memory loss,
bleeding gums, and immune deficiency.
Mr Soames told Dr Clark in a letter that the detailed examination of
77 veterans had revealed no evidence of any syndrome.
Various psychological conditions were uncovered in 26% of cases and
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome in 12%.
Serious medical conditions unrelated to Gulf war service were
discovered in 17% of cases, unconnected with service in the Gulf.
Mr Soames said preliminary findings from the American Comprehensive
Clinical Evaluation Programme for Gulf veterans indicated a similar
pattern.
Veterans are blaming the mass of vaccinations and Nerve Agent
Pre-Treatment Tablets they had to take before war began for their
ailments.
They argue it is the large number and variety of injections and
tablets taken together over a short period that has caused the problems.
Dr Clark said: ''They (the MoD) are not undertaking an inquiry. They
are examining veterans individually, rather than comparing them as a
whole. What we want is a full medical research study, which is quite
different.
''The Government's approach smacks of short-sightedness and
irresponsibility. We asked our soldiers to go to the Gulf to fight on
our behalf. The least the Government can do is to treat the claims
seriously.''

<HEADLINE>Woman loses discrimination appeal. Judges set pregnancy apart from related illness</HEADLINE>

A WOMAN who was sacked after a pregnancy-related illness kept her off
work was not the victim of sex discrimination, three judges have
decided.
They ruled that there was a vital difference between dismissing a
woman because she was pregnant and dismissing her because of an illness
caused by the pregnancy.
Basing their decision on a European Court of Justice ruling, the
judges said that while the first amounts to sex discrimination, the
second does not.
A spokeswoman for the Equal Opportunities Commission said she hoped
the case would be appealed to the House of Lords and added that
yesterday's finding appeared to be inconsistent with another English
case referred to the European Court of Justice.
The case showed clearly that many people thought they had rights but
found that they could not enforce these rights, said Ms Carole Ewart,
director of the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties.
She added: ''It seems to people that if you are pregnant you cannot be
victimised by an employer because of that. But here the court is
treating pregnancy as an illness. It is difficult to speculate how long
an illness will last but if a woman has complications because of her
pregnancy, you know these complications will cease when she has had her
baby, so there is a particular time limit of her condition.''
Mrs Mary Brown, of Fennsbank Avenue, Burnside, Glasgow, worked as a
driver with Rentokil before she was dismissed in February 1991.
She advised the firm in August 1990 that she was pregnant. She had
difficulties with the pregnancy, submitted a series of medical
ceritificates and did not return to work.
Rentokil had a rule, which was part of her contract of employment,
that anyone who was off sick for 26 continuous weeks would be dismissed.
Mrs Brown was reminded of the rule and warned she would be sacked if she
did not return to work by February 8, 1991, when the 26 weeks were up.
She did not come back to work and was dismissed.
Mrs Brown took her case to an industrial tribunal, which decided she
had been treated in the same way as a male employee absent through
long-term illness and rejected her sex discrimination claim.
The Employment Appeal Tribunal also rejected her case and she appealed
to the Court of Session.
Lord Allanbridge, who heard the appeal with Lords Murray and Wylie,
said the reason Mrs Brown had not been available for work was her
illness. He added: ''It is not relevant that the precise reason for that
illness was a condition, namely pregnancy, which is capable of affecting
only women.''
Rentokil had produced evidence before the industrial tribunal to show
that a male employee had been dismissed for the same reason as Mrs Brown
-- namely that he had been off work ill for 26 weeks.
Lord Allanbridge said the court had to take into account recent
decisions of the European Court of Justice.
A 1976 EC directive outlawed sex discrimination in the workplace and
Mr Colin McEachran QC, counsel for Mrs Brown, argued that the directive
applied to a case where a woman was dismissed for a pregnancy-related
illness.
Lord Allanbridge said: ''At first sight, the argument of Mr McEachran
that the European Court had decided that any dismissal due to pregnancy
is contrary to the 1976 directive is an attractive one.''
However, Rentokil argued that there was a clear distinction between
dismissal due to illness caused by pregnancy and dismissal due to the
mere fact of being pregnant.
''We consider that this is a subtle but very important distinction,''
added the judge.
He referred to a Danish case which had gone to the European Court. The
court had drawn a clear distinction between pregnancy and illness, even
where the illness was attributable to the pregnancy.
The European Court had stated the 1976 directive did not envisage the
case of an illness attributable to pregnancy and saw no reason to
distinguish such an illness from any other illness.
Applying the European decision to Mrs Brown, whose absence from work
was due to illness, her appeal must be refused.
Ms Muriel Robison, legal development officer for the EOC in Scotland,
said that while the EOC felt this was an important case and would like
to see it appealed, nevertheless its significance was likely to be
diminished because the Government had passed the Employment Protection
Act in October of last year.
''The legislation last October made dismissal for reasons of pregnancy
automatically unlawful for all women regardless of length of service. We
take the view that that would involve dismissing someone because of a
pregnancy-related illness,'' said Ms Robison.
She added that decisions previous to the legislation had been widely
interpreted, although one case, Carole Webb v Emo Air Cargo (UK) Ltd,
which was referred to the European Court of Justice by the House of
Lords, seemed to run counter to the Court of Session appeal issued
yesterday.
In that case, a woman had been given a permanent contract which
involved her covering for another employee's maternity leave. However,
shortly after starting work, she discovered that she too was pregnant
and was dismissed.
Her employers claimed she was not dismissed because of a consequence
of her pregnancy but because she was not going to be at work. The
European Court of Justice held this was an inappropriate distinction.
Ms Robison said: ''The Webb decision seemed to take us one step
forward and this takes us one step back.''

MPS should be allowed to work for political lobbying companies if
their salaries were registered and their roles clearly defined, leading
Conservative Dame Angela Rumbold said yesterday.
They should have firm, written contracts specifying the expertise they
were using, she told the Nolan inquiry into standards in public life.
Dame Angela, a deputy chairman of the Tory Party, resigned as a
director of lobbying company Decision Makers last October after
allegations about the firm's role in the Government's choice of a
Channel Tunnel rail link station.
The MP for Mitcham and Morden had previously declared her involvement
in the Commons register of interest, including a full list of Decision
Makers' clients, but the issue further embarrassed Prime Minister John
Major when he was fighting off various allegations of ''sleaze'' in his
party.
Questions about Dame Angela's involvement arose after London's Evening
Standard newspaper claimed the appointment of Decision Makers to present
the case for Ebbsfleet in Kent gave it the edge over Stratford in east
London.
Dame Angela, who always maintained she had nothing to hide, told the
Nolan committee her decision to resign had been ''agonising'' but she
felt her position at the firm as a high-profile MP would damage it.
However, she emphasised that MPs must be allowed to have outside
interests.
''I cannot imagine a situation where an MP simply has to concentrate
on the legislative process and the concerns within their own
constituency once they are elected,'' she said.
''If that happens, I don't understand how they can advance as
individuals unless they understand how the rest of the world works.''
Dame Angela told the 10-strong committee her salary at Decision Makers
had risen from #8000 a year to #12,000 in the two years she was there.
Mr Stewart Steven, editor of London's Evening Standard, said his
newspaper had obtained a confidential Decision Makers memo which ''made
his jaw drop''.
It said the company had raised the profile of its client Blue Circle
Properties by briefing the Prime Minister in ''an informal and private
presentation''.
The hearing continues today.

THE death toll from Tuesday's devastating earthquake in Japan
continued to rise yesterday as a major fire broke out in the main
shopping area of the city of Kobe and was raging out of control.
The blaze, which engulfed about 20 buildings, followed a huge
explosion at 7.30am. Hundreds of thousands of people fled the stricken
city.
The latest figures showed 3081 people died and 14,572 were injured in
the quake. British officials said last night that there were still no
reports of British casualties, although 35 foreigners are known to have
died -- 32 of them from Korea.
Rescuers were continuing to search the rubble for the 869 people still
missing and the government issued a warning that a strong aftershock was
likely to hit the quake zone within a month.
By early morning the hundreds of fires which erupted after the tremor
had either been extinguished or had burned themselves out.
It is estimated that several hundred thousand residents started to
move out of the city once dawn broke yesterday. On foot, by bicycle, in
shared cars, residents packed the main road out of town. Some were
limping, in bandages, looking like war refugees as they picked their way
past collapsed buildings and piles of rubble.
Makoto Hiroiyama was sending his wife, mother and child out of town to
stay with relatives. ''It's dangerous here, and there's no water,'' he
said.
More than 150,000 people spent the freezing night in emergency
shelters, as authorities warned they had food and water for only a third
of them. Life in a hi-tech country was suddenly reduced to the most
basic and primitive level. Telephone, power, gas and train services were
still largely knocked out.
Throughout the city, the sound of hissing could be heard as gas leaked
from ruptured pipes. Although most of the fires had burned themselves
out, the leaking gas still posed the threat of explosion or fire.
At shelters people blinked in the sooty daylight waiting for food to
be delivered. A few wandered, poking at smoking ruins of their former
homes.
''I'm helpless. All I can do is sit around the fire like this and
wait,'' a middle-aged man resting at an elementary school turned shelter
said. ''All I have now are water and blankets. But at least I'm alive.''
The government's rescue effort gathered momentum a full day after the
earthquake. The army said 2000 troops, including medics and engineers,
had arrived in the zone. Nearly 50 aircraft, including three dozen
helicopters, were ferrying supplies to survivors. A team of rescue dogs
was flown in yesterday morning, from Switzerland, to help comb the
rubble.
However, there was growing criticism over the slow start in helping
the victims and some newspapers attacked the government for not doing
more.
The Japanese foreign ministry said it had confirmed reports of 35
deaths among the expatriate community. Thirty-two of them were Koreans
and the other three were a 24-year-old English teacher from the USA, a
student from Shanghai and an Australian man.
Reports about Scots caught up in the earthquake continued to filter
back.
Guesthouse owners Duncan and Margaret Greenhow, of Gretna, flew out to
Kobe earlier this year to stay with their daughter, Ailsa, who is
expecting a baby shortly.
Yesterday the couple's niece Gillian Ward, a nurse in Carlisle, said:
''We heard from Margaret today and they are all safe and well. I think
Ailsa's home has not been badly damaged. We were very relieved to get
their message.''
The head of information at the British Embassy in Tokyo, Mr Robert
Coghlan, said British representatives in Osaka were keeping in touch
with the police and hospitals in Kobe and Osaka.
Mr Coghlan said they had identified 300 Britons in the downtown Kobe
area and had managed to contact a third of them to ensure they were OK.
''So far, so good. It is quite reassuring as far as that is concerned.
But we are not home and dry yet. There are still two-thirds of them to
contact.''
Mr Coghlan, 52, was born in Aberdeen but educated at Govan High
School. He has been in Japan for 12 years with the diplomatic service.
