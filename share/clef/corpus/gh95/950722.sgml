HOW many owner-managers of growing companies can honestly put up their
hands and say: ''I know everything that goes on in my business''?
I'd be surprised if approaching half of you good, hard-working people
could genuinely take a visitor through the company's operations in
minute detail. After all, are we not constantly told by the experts to
focus on the long-term vision, the big picture, and to do it from up on
the bridge instead of being bogged down in the engine room?
But the more we strive to improve the performance and efficiency of
our company, the more I become convinced that the true secret of
long-term success lies in mastering the minutiae. Sure, there has to be
a vision to aim for and a plan to realise it, but without the right
management of detail it won't happen as it should. Perhaps it won't
happen at all.
It goes without saying that every type of business generates its own
deluge of detail. Every year, it seems, the complexity increases. The
more you try to improve different aspects of the company's operations,
the more questions seem to arise. The resulting solutions demand detail.
As that wise man Sir Bruce Pattullo once observed: ''It's interesting
how if you concentrate very hard on one aspect of the business, one
number, that number tends to improve almost as if by magic.''
Except, of course, that there is no magic in business. Just grinding,
unrelenting pursuit of improvement combined with the occasional
breakthrough. I suspect that consistent attention to detail would yield
as much bottom line improvement for most companies as any breakthrough.
It's the same process that is involved in making all organisations
work more professionally. Attention to detail involves painstakingly
creating and installing the systems and procedures that mean the hassle
is handled smoothly and automatically, whether by machine or man. It is
those systems that are essential to achieve quality certification or
Investors In People accreditation.
But there is more to detail than drudgery. Increasingly the ability to
manage detail successfully is being seen as giving businesses a real
competitive edge, particularly when they operate in international
markets. A company cannot hope to get within light years of world-class
status unless its systems and procedures operate faultlessly --
literally.
These days the quality of suppliers to some global markets,
particularly electronics, is measured by their ability to deliver
fault-free products within ever-shorter timeframes, not just 99% of the
time but 99.9999% of the time.
I recently visited Donprint, the East Kilbride-based product
identification company which in its 15 years has grown to become market
leader in the UK and is increasingly challenging US and Far Eastern
competitors on their own doorsteps. The scale of its achievement was
demonstrated last year when Jarvis Porter, the acquisitive quoted
Leeds-based printing and labels group, agreed a #27m purchase deal with
Des Donohue, founder and owner of Donprint.
Donprint's success is down to a relentless pursuit of standards and
quality through effective management of detail. The group had a vision,
one that was much more ambitious than that of 99% of Scottish companies,
but it would not have realised it without those boring old systems and
procedures.
Iain MacRitchie, Donprint's MD, knows precisely where his organisation
rates on its key performance factors every single day. To achieve
success in managing detail to this level requires a very specific
structure, avoiding layers of costly bureaucracy or, worse, burying your
best people in the engine room. To be blunt, it involves employing two
quite different types of individual: strong well-paid managers who are
good at driving and motivating staff, and much lower-cost people who are
content to perform repetitive jobs reliably.
Your good managers, and indeed yourself as the owner-MD, should follow
the same principle in daily operation. No PAs or private offices, no
large admin staff are allowed in this cost-effective, detail-hungry
scenario. Instead you use the latest software to manage your own
business lives simply and effectively, and you do your own admin.
Because there is no time for complexity or unnecessary distraction, your
working life is neatly prioritised. And boy, do you understand the
detail!

A BOSNIAN Minister yesterday claimed that up to 10,000 Muslim refugees
from Srebrenica had been murdered by Bosnian Serbs.
Foreign Minister Muhamed Sacirbey said: ''We think 5000, and maybe as
many as 10,000, of Srebrenica's civilian population was murdered, not in
the warfare but after the city surrendered.''
Sacirbey also claimed Bosnian Serbs had raped Muslims after
overrunning the UN ''safe area''.
''In one instance, 1600 young boys and older men were executed in a
soccer stadium after being taken prisoner,'' he added.
He was speaking after meeting Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati and his Greek counterpart Karolos Papoulias for their third
round of talks this year on the Bosnian crisis.
He also urged Belgrade to recognise the sovereign states in former
Yugoslavia and close its borders to help achieve a ceasefire.
''(One) avenue is mutual recognition between the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, Serbian Montenegro, and Bosnia Herzegovina in addition to
real steps including border closing,'' he said.
The claims of atrocities were backed by Dutch Defence Minister Joris
Voorhoeve who said yesterday Bosnian Serb forces had committed grave war
crimes and might have killed thousands of Muslims after they overran
Srebrenica.
''I believe that grave war crimes occurred,'' Voorhoeve said in
London.
''We know that very serious things happened in Srebrenica. We still do
not have a complete picture but I fear that hundreds, if not thousands
of people died,'' he said.
Dutch officials have previously avoided commenting on the conduct of
Bosnian Serb for fear of reprisals against the 310 Dutch UN peacekeepers
who were trapped in the enclave.
But Voorhoeve said that now all the Dutch peacekeepers had left, there
was no longer any reason for them to remain silent about any atrocities
they may have witnessed.
Voorhoeve said he hoped the U.N. war crimes tribunal for former
Yugoslavia in The Hague would fully investigate the recent events in
Srebrenica.
Fears over the safety of the Muslim population have also led King
Hussein to say he was ready to join his countrymen serving in UN
peacekeeping troops in the former Yugoslavia if the world acted to stop
''massacres'' of fellow Muslims in Bosnia.
''If the world decides to move to stop these massacres and to perform
its duty, we are ready to send many more of our troops and I am
personally ready to go with them,'' King Hussein told a live phone-in
show on Jordan's television to rally a nationwide appeal to help Bosnian
Muslims.
He said he was donating #50,000 of his own money for the appeal.
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said later that he would launch a
joint relief operation next week with King Hussein.
Jordan has 3500 troops serving in the United Nations Protection Force.
However, King Hussein warned the London conference that if the world
failed in its resolve to end Serb ''atrocities'' against Bosnians, then
the ''honour of Jordan's troops would not allow them to stay in a
position that made them look incapable''.
He said Jordan would continue an aid airlift by its air force, with
two planeloads of foodand medical equipment already flown from Amman in
the last two days to Bosnia.
King Hussein said Bosnians were victims of ''religious, racist, and
ethnic discrimination'' adding that their ''enormous suffering was an
attack on humanity and its values''.
Jordan this week threatened to pull out its troops from UN troops in
former Yugoslavia if no military action was taken to stop Serb attacks
against Muslim enclaves in Bosnia.
Bosnian Radio reported Serb shelling of Gorazde, an eastern Muslim
enclave which, though still relatively secure in government hands, is
facing the threat of mass hunger.
''Regardless of any imminent military threat to Gorazde, it is being
slowly starved and strangled,'' said UN aid spokesman Ron Redmond, in
Geneva.Mr Redmond, with UNHCR, the main refugee agency, spoke of
''desperate'' food shortages.

<HEADLINE>Farmers fined for breaking potato ban</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<TEXT>
TWO Aberdeenshire farmers were each fined #1000 by a judge yesterday
for breaking a court order banning them from selling a variety of
uncertificated seed potato.
The case of William Alexander Petrie and his son, William Gordon
Petrie of Balquharn Farm, Alford, Aberdeenshire, returned to the Court
of Session, Edinburgh after a complaint from a Dutch firm of plant
breeders, Selectiebedrijf Luidenburgh BV of Warfhuizen, Holland. The
company said the farmers had continued selling seed potatoes of the
variety ''Estima'' or ''Estema'' despite a Court of Session order
granted in May 1993 banning them from doing so.
Peter McCormack , counsel for the Dutch firm, complained that despite
the interdict of May 1993 the farmers sold uncertificated Estima seed
potatoes to seven named growers in England between January and March
1994.
The petitioners main concern in bringing the breach of interdict to
the court's attention was that selling uncertified varieties of potato
could ruin the good name of certificated seed varieties.
It was also a breach of plant breeders rights. He said the sales and
deliveries of the Estima potatoes by the Petries took place in time for
the 1994 planting season.
In each case, it was claimed, the English farmers would have no reason
to buy ware potatoes -- potatoes sold for consumption rather than as
seed potatoes -- from Aberdeenshire. Seed potatoes were more expensive
than ware potatoes and the English farmers were said to have paid
between #160 and #200 per tonne for the Estima seed vegetables. The ware
price for the Estima potatoes during the same period was about #80 a
tonne.
Nick Holroyd, counsel for the Petries, said both farmers accepted
equal responsibility for the breach of the court order.
He said when they sold the Estima variety to the English farmers they
were under the impression they were being sold as ware -- for
consumption, and not as seed potatoes. But they agree that this should
have been confirmed and they should have been more careful.
Mr Holroyd said that since the first court action in 1993 a number of
''evils'' had happened to them. This included paying a damages
settlement after a damages action was raised against them in connection
with the sale of uncertificated varieties of potatoes.
The total cost of legal expenses in the civil court to the Petries
amounted so far to around #50,000. Punishment was also meted out by the
Society of Plant Breeders who imposed bans on them from growing seed
potatoes for at least three years.
In the case of growing the Estima variety the ban extended until the
year 2003. He said the Petries were also each fined #1400 at Aberdeen
Sheriff Court for selling uncertificated potato varieties.
He said the consequences of the publicity given to the previous court
action had an adverse effect on their farming business. The Petries also
felt that their reputation went down in the estimation of their peers.
Mr Holroyd asked the court to show leniency in the circumstances.
The Petries, he said expressed regret for the breach of the court
order.
He added: ''They have already been punished for their misdemeanour.''
The judge, Lord Weir, fined each of the Petries #1000 for what he
described as a ''wilful'' breach of the court order.
The judge added: ''I had considered taking severe action in view of
the blatant flouting of the court order, but having heard of the
consequences on both farmers and on their busineess I am prepared to
refrain from this and I propose to fine each respondent #1000''.

St Andrews,
AFTER a day in which much happened but which lacked any coherent
shape, a one-stroke lead after the second round of the Open Championship
at St Andrews was shared by two Americans, John Daly and Brad Faxon, and
a 40-year-old Japanese, Katsuyoshi Tomori, on 138, six under par. Behind
them, 100 more qualifiers were squeezed within only 10 strokes.
This is 33 more than the minimum, and with each qualifier guaranteed
to win #4000 -- as compared to #650 for those who miss the cut -- the
extra survivors will cost the Royal and Ancient Golf Club more than
#100,000. One saving grace is that four of them are amateurs who cannot
take home a penny.
The 103 total is still 10 fewer than the record 113 at Royal Birkdale
in 1991. The R and A had been considering sending out players in threes
today, but later reverted to their orginal plan of twos.
As organisers were sorting out the logjam, holder Nick Price
criticised them for allowing rounds to stretch to five-and-a-half hours.
Price was one of the later starters, his group teeing off at 3.25pm,
but the Zimbabwean did not complete his round of 74 until just before
9pm.
By then, with light fading, there were just a smattering of shivering
spectators left in the huge stands to welcome in the Turnberry champion
and former world No 1.
He said: ''Something must be done about this. It took us
three-and-a-half hours to cover nine holes and that's not acceptable.''
Perhaps the most significant development on a day of bright sunshine
and a westerly wind strengthening across the Old course to 30mph, was
the advance of Nick Faldo, from seven strokes off the lead to only
three. The leaders' closest pursuers included Masters champion Ben
Crenshaw and the two latest US Open champions, Ernie Els and holder
Corey Pavin.
Once again the Amateur Champion, Barassie's Gordon Sherry, gave a
wonderful account of himself in the company of Greg Norman and Tom
Watson, and outscored them both. Of the five amateurs in the field, only
Bathgate's Stephen Gallacher failed to qualify for the weekend's golf.
Despite the congestion, distinguished casualties occurred. Most
notably Colin Montgomerie, Europe's No.1 for the last two years, missed
his first cut in 17 events worldwide this season, and his third in the
last four Opens, unable to repair the damage of an opening 75 with
another of the same to miss by two strokes.
Montgomerie took his disappointment as well as he might after
five-and-a-half hours' unavailing toil. ''Scoring like that is not good
enough, even although the weather was more difficult today for the later
starters,'' he said.
Faldo,having picked up five birdie 3s and another gain at the long
fourteenth, then bogeyed the sixteenth, not a well-timed mistake with
the dreaded seventeenth lying in wait. But he escaped with par there.
Daly is taking delight in stepping out some of the more outrageous
distances between ball and hole on the double greens. Yesterday's gem
was the first putt of 180 feet he had at the twelfth to four feet to
make his birdie.
That advance was the third of four in five holes from the turn, which
helped retrieve a double bogey 7 at the long fifth.
Els felt that until near the end, this was his best championship round
since the third at Oakmont last year when he won the US Open. But then,
he confessed: ''I pushed a little too hard trying to break further away
from the field.''
0
Els misjudged the wind at the fifteenth, his approach came up 40 feet
short and he took three putts. The seventeenth exacted a routine 5 when
he pulled his second shot and missed from five feet and although he
drove into the Valley of Sin, his first putt had neither line nor
length, and from five feet he missed again.
Pavin's difficulty was less with the elements, more with sustaining
his concentration as the round moved inexorably well past the four hours
20 minutes thought acceptable by the Royal &amp; Ancient for a three-ball to
complete a championship round -- in this age of go-slow golf a case of
wishful, if hopeless, thinking.
Trying not to fight the wind and take what he could from the
afternoon, Pavin swung and putted well enough to advance his challenge
further. His only mistake was to reach a place on the fifteenth green
from where three putts were almost inevitable, but he finished by
driving the last and making his third birdie 3 with two putts from 50
feet.

AT ten to nine yesterday morning, Steve Webster looked up at the giant
scoreboard towering above the seventh tee and saw his name heading the
list of Open co-leaders.
And 10 minutes later, after a birdie three, the baby-faced 20-year-old
amateur from Warwickshire was in the outright lead at six under par,
with the names directly under him being Watson, Daly and Crenshaw.
Yet his day was to prove a roller-coaster ride. A brilliant outward 32
was followed by five dropped shots in four holes from the turn,
including a double bogey six at the twelfth. He then birdied the
fourteenth and fifteenth, three-putted the sixteenth, and had two pars
at the closing holes, his first of the back nine.
And there was controversy at the seventeenth. As Webster tapped in for
his par, his caddie Simon Lilley was standing behind him, and in the
recorder's hut afterwards, playing partner Olle Karlsson's caddie
pointed this out, as deliberately standing on the line can cost a player
a two-stroke penalty.
But 20 minutes later, after discussions between all the players and
their caddies, referee David Probyn ruled there would be no action,
leaving Webster to celebrate his 72 and two-under-par aggregate
following his fine opening 70 on Thursday.

ONE of the eternally fascinating aspects of listening to top golfers
in Open week is the astonishing recall they have for shots, holes, and
scores stretching back many years, writes Ian Paul.
American Brad Faxon, however, lent a new dimension to this phenomenon
when he described the sweater Jack Nicklaus wore when he won the Open at
the Old Course in 1978.
The slim, tall man from Barrington, Rhode Island, mentioned this as he
explained why, although he had never played at St Andrews, he felt he
knew the course well.
After shooting a superb 67 to join the traffic jam at the top of the
leaderboard, Faxon said: ''I watched the course so often on TV that I
feel I know it very well.
''I can remember Jack's sweater and I remember watching Seve in 1984
when he won.
''The sweater? It was a blue Argyle, a light blue and white
cashmere.''
Faxon knew he needed a birdie at the last to equal his performance at
Turnberry over the opening two days last year.
He achieved that, despite being nervous about his chances, adding his
67 to his previous 71 for a six-under-par 138.
As well as an impressive memory, Faxon revealed a rare modesty.
''I haven't played that much in the Open because I was just not good
enough. I remember the last time I was over I had to qualify at
Scotscraig and I shot seven under but still didn't make it.
''I had always planned to play St Andrews.''
He didn't think the pin placements were tougher than Thursday ...
''two were impossible''.
He would like to think he will play better in the last round this year
if he is in contention than he did at Turnberry. ''I was anxious to get
off to a good start but I bogeyed the first hole and never really got
going.''
Faxon has won four tournaments in the US but has never made it at the
highest level. ''Majors are a pretty big part of my life, but I don't
think I could say that I cannot live without winning one.''
Two players didn't even get to the last green.
Irishman Philip Walton did get up the fairway, but when he discovered
that his ball had gone out of bounds he decided he would call it a day
rather than walk back to the tee and start again. He was five over at
the time.
Andrew Oldcorn, the Englishman who speaks with a Scottish accent, had
to quit for a different reason. His back has been giving him trouble,
and it proved too painful even to start his second round.

Martin Smith assesses the brunt of pressure on Glasgow's criminal
justice system as thousands of cases are dropped
IT IS, indeed, alarming to read that more than 7000 criminal cases,
which would normally be prosecuted, were dropped because Glasgow
District Court had insufficient capacity to deal with them within the
allotted time.
While these figures have just been made public, they will come as no
surprise to the hard-pressed legal practitioners who ply their trade in
the district court, and for that matter the sheriff court, and also the
over-worked procurator fiscal's department.
As with everything else, however, the situation is perhaps not quite
so critical when one examines the background in more detail. It would
have to be said that a considerable number of these 7000 cases will be
dropped for cause shown.
The public should not think that the procurator fiscal sits with a
huge pile of case files on his desk, tosses a coin, and then throws half
of them into the bin. Before any case is dropped, it will be carefully
checked and many cases will not proceed simply because the procurator
fiscal realises after examining the papers that there is no case to
answer or that to proceed would, for whatever reason, not be in the
public interest.
The cases dealt with by Glasgow District Court are summary cases, and
in the majority of summary cases the procurator fiscal does not see the
witnesses before the day of the trial. What a witness may have told a
police officer six months previously may well be different from what he
is prepared to say when he goes into court. So rather than waste court
time such a case may be dropped prior to trial if the fiscal realises a
conviction cannot be obtained.
Another important factor, one forecast by the Glasgow Bar Association
at the time when the Legal Aid budget was slashed, is that an ever
increasing number of accused persons are now denied assistance. People
outwith the legal profession might have rubbed their hands at the time
assuming lawyers were getting rich on the back of Legal Aid which, of
course, is a fallacy.
The birds, however, have now come home to roost, which will cause
those who are familiar with court procedures no surprise whatsoever.
It is a fact that whether an accused person is guilty or innocent the
vast majority of them will, when they first appear in curt, plead not
guilty. If those individuals then have the benefit of legal advice the
lawyer will often, and where appropriate, tell them they have no
alternative but to plead guilty. Normally the lawyer's advice is
accepted and at the end of the day the accused pleads guilty.
The unrepresented accused, however, will probably maintain his plea of
not guilty causing a trial to take place which could last a day or more.
In the end he will, of course, be found guilty, probably because he was
guilty in the first place, but without the benefit of legal advice these
individuals normally opt to take their chance at a trial which
unnecessarily clogs the system.
A third reason is that crime is on the increase in this city whatever
facts or figures are publicly produced. Assaults, and even murders, are
now 10-a-penny and the drug problem is, I believe, more serious than the
authorities have admitted.
Ironically, it is probably the drugs problem which has caused all
forms of crime to increase because many crimes are, for varying reasons,
drug related whether it be the addict stealing money to spend on his
habit, or the drug-crazed youth prepared to stick a knife into someone's
chest while under the influence.
While all of the foregoing factors contribute to this serious
situation in our courts, the main reason for this appalling state of
affairs is quite simply a lack of resources. The problem would be
virtually resolved if an additional 12 courts were constructed at
Glasgow District Court, an additional 12 magistrates were hired to hear
the cases in those courts, and an additional 12 fiscals and back-up
staff were employed to process the cases.
In an age when cut-backs are the name of the game, the court system
has suffered more than most. In the civil courts, litigants are being
charged exorbitant amounts for even the smallest claim on the basis that
the Government believes that eventually the courts should pay for
themselves.
In the criminal courts the cut-backs have undoubtedly led to guilty
people walking the streets because there are not sufficient resources to
handle their cases within the time limits laid down by statute.
The Government can try and apportion blame wherever it wants but the
reality is that it is the primarily responsible for the court system
breakdown in Glasgow.
This should not be interpreted as a gripe against the present
Government -- it is a gripe against government in general. If at the
next General Election the Labour Party comes to power, it is unlikely
that the situation would radically change as sorting out the court
system in Glasgow is not likely to be one of the first priorities of any
new Government.
I was intrigued to read that the Crown Office had put a new structure
into place at Glasgow District Court. While I would not confess to be a
regular attender nowadays in what is jokingly referred to by the legal
profession as Glasgow's Palais de Justice, a number of my colleagues,
who do frequent the premises, tell me that this new structure must be so
sophisticated that no-one seems to have noticed it in operation.
I must admit that never in my reasonably lengthy career as a Glasgow
court practitioner have I ever been in a situation where a client of
mine has had his case dropped when I have believed him to have been
guilty. I can recite many examples of cases being dropped by the
prosecuting authorities on the grounds of good cause shown, but my own
experience lends me to believe that the situation is perhaps not just
quite as critical as the published figures would have one believe.
Interestingly enough, I was asked only yesterday, as were a number of
my colleagues, if we could provide an example of an actual case which
had been dropped in circumstances which would have allowed a person who,
in our opinion, was guilty to walk the street without having had to face
trial. None of us could come up with any example.
Good luck to Crown Office -- if it can bring down the number of cases
that are dropped then it is to be commended but, in my opinion, the
system will continue to decline until such time as somebody, somewhere
realises that it is false economy to cut back on our criminal justice
system.

We are about number seven in our sector but our aim is to be in the
top three by 1998
Sports shoe retailer Tom Hunter went into business 11 years ago with
no stock and very little money. Today, his Ayrshire-based Sports
Division has a turnover of #22m and, he tells John Buchanan, this is
just the beginning
SPORTS Division could already claim to be in the first division of UK
retailers, but Tom Hunter's aim is to put the company firmly into the
premier league of specialist stores.
Over the next three years he plans to triple its turnover from the
present #22m to #66m. This dramatic growth will come from an expansion
of the existing 29 stores to 106 by 1998.
Such ambition would be breathtaking at any time, but coming during a
period when retail sales in the High Street are flat, and To Let signs
are a common sight in shopping centres, Hunter's proposal would appear
to require an intake of pure oxygen.
The high flying image of the proposals are put in perspective,
however, by a trip to his base in the depths of rural Ayrshire. Visitors
invited to Sports Division's headquarters in Dundonald should be issued
with a compass as well as a detailed layout of the tiny village.
Even once you have found the Olympic Business Park the search is not
over. No signposts indicate that the Sports Division HQ is tucked away
at the rear of some large warehouses, hidden from view by a row of
factories.
Hunter laughs at the company's anonymous site, and jokes that when
people arrive for an interview they are immediately awarded a bonus
point for having found the office.
He can afford to laugh. Any firm of consultants asked to give a report
on how the privately owned firm should expand would no doubt put at the
top of the list a plush new easily accessible head office with an
appropriate address in either Edinburgh or Glasgow. After all, the
argument would go, if you want to be taken seriously you have to have
the right image.
Hunter, however, continues to prove all the accepted public
relations/marketing theories wrong. From the very beginning Sports
Division has bucked the economic trends.
Listening to his low key description of how the business started, why
it is based where it is, and how he plans to continue growing it, you
begin to believe that tripling turnover in three years is easily
attainable.
Six generations of the Hunter family had run a grocery shop in
Cumnock, an Ayrshire mining village, but in 1984 the mines finally
closed and his father, Campbell, decided to shut up shop. ''When the
mines closed, Cumnock closed,'' says Hunter, who at the time was
studying at Strathclyde University.
His father, refusing to retire, helped keep the books of a local
entrepreneur who sold footwear to retail outlets. ''I was examining the
receipts my father had and noticed that trainers appeared to be very
popular,'' he says.
After some thought he came up with the idea of selling the sports
footwear in High Street stores by convincing retailers that they should
give him some space. ''I wrote to a number of groups including the then
What Every Woman Wants group saying that I was a rapidly growing
business.
''I did not get many replies, and I never heard from What Every Woman
Wants, but a store group in the North of England agreed to let me sell
my footwear in three of its stores.''
This single success buoyed the young entrepreneur but also presented
him with a problem: he had no shoes, and nothing on which he could
display them.
He thanked the store group and explained that because of ''pressure of
business'' he would not be able to start the in-house store concession
for three weeks. He had borrowed #5000 from his father and another #5000
from a bank. It was time to buy some shoes display units. ''The stores
were in Leeds, Sunderland and Aberdeen,'' he explains, ''and I spent my
time driving in an old van I had bought between the three replacing
stock.''
Sports footwear sales were booming and business went well for the
fledgling Sports Division. However, there was a cashflow problem, and
this could easily have killed the company almost at birth. ''The money
from my sales went into the store group's till, and it then deducted
commission and sent me the remainder, but I had to wait for the money.''
Sports Division was owed #30,000 by the store group when Hunter was
approached by the chairman who suggested changing the way he was being
paid. It was agreed that in future Sports Division would receive the
gross money from the sales, and would then forward the commission to the
store group.''Six weeks after this conversation,'' he says, ''it went
bust, but it only owed me #145.''
Sports Division could easily have been brought down by the crash of
the other company, but thanks to the action of its chairman it was able
to carry on, and gained concessions in large chains such as Fosters.
By 1989 Hunter had 60 in-store concessions, and in that year opened
the first sports footwear store of his own in Paisley. ''After this we
changed our strategy. We now have 29 stores, and only six concessions.''
The aim now is for the company to increase this year's turnover of
#22m to #32m in 1996, #45m in 1997 and #66m in 1998. This will be
achieved by opening 17 new stores this year, another 30 next year and a
further 30 in 1997.
At present the company is concentrated in Scotland, although it does
have a presence in England with outlets in Sunderland, Carlisle,
Stockton, Manchester and Dudley.
This is not a definitive list, for such is the rapid expansion of the
company that even Tom Hunter has to double check before he can say how
many Sports Division branches there are. By next week the figure could
easily have grown. ''We are about number seven in our sector,'' he says,
''but our aim is to be in the top three by 1998.''
How does Sports Division buck the present retail trend of flat sales
and store closures? ''We understand this business. It is almost like a
passion. We do live and breathe the business, and we deliver what our
customers want,'' he responds.
Sports Division will also stay with the tried-and-tested formula which
has brought success, and has no plans to diversify. ''We will stick with
the business we know,'' he says. ''In 1991 I tried out the indoor
go-karting business, and it was not really a success. We came out of
this business after a year.''
To date, Sports Division's expansion has been self-financed as
turnover has grown from #135,000 in 1984, the first year of operation,
but Hunter does not rule out the company, which he still owns outright,
having to borrow to help pay for the planned growth.
On the question of the site of his headquarters, he says simply: ''I
come from Ayrshire. I only live five minutes from here, and many of the
people who work for me are Ayrshire folk, so I have no plans to move to
either Glasgow or Edinburgh.''
He makes this statement with the confidence of man who knows that
suppliers will find him wherever he is so that they can share in Sports
Division's success.

Brondby 1, Rangers 2
RANGERS won the first of their Danish tour games last night in the
small town of Grena and Paul Gascoigne scored one of the goals which
sent them to victory and had their fans celebrating on the terracings.
It was the competitive debut that anyone would want: to score a goal,
to have the fans chanting your name, and to fit in with your new
team-mates.
Gascoigne revelled in the atmosphere. And afterwards he admitted:
''Scoring the goal was a bonus. Obviously that is something extra.
''All I wanted to do was get another game under my belt, and get to
know the other players.
''I think I succeeded in doing that and playing with Brian Laudrup was
a pleasure. He is wonderful to watch -- but there are so many good
players around in this team.''
Gascoigne scored Rangers' second goal when they snapped into action
just before half-time.
The first came from a Mark Hateley penalty after Laudrup had been
dumped in the box by his fellow countryman Per Nielsen. He may have been
captain for the night but there was no ceremony involved when he was
sent crashing.
Hateley took the kick and sent it confidently into the net.
Two minutes later it was Gascoigne's turn to score, and to finish the
game.
A marvellous Rangers move down the right saw new boy Stephen Wright
play a one-two with Laudrup, and then cross for Gascoigne to score with
a shot which struck the inside of the post and then spun into the net.
The Danes did get one back in 65 minutes when the local referee gave
them what seemed a soft penalty. Ole Bjur was fouled by Durrant, he took
the kick himself, and scored and it was the one time in the game that
comeback keeper Andy Goram was caught out.
Afterwards Rangers manager Walter Smith said: ''I am delighted at the
result because this was a game played against good quality opposition.
''It was played in the right manner and I saw enough to satisfy me.
Brian Laudrup picked up from where he left off last season. Paul
Gascoigne scored a goal and there were other things which satisfied me.
''We need games and by the time we reach our tournament we should be
in good shape.''
Just like the Danish side, Smith juggled his team in the second half.
Ten minutes after half-time Alan McLaren went off and was replaced by
Trevor Steven.
Seven minutes later Gascoigne, Hateley, and Charlie Miller all went
off with Gordon Durie, Ian Durrant and Stuart McCall taking over.
Apart from the Gascoigne goal, and an outstanding performance from Ian
Ferguson, Smith must have been delighted with Goram's display.
Several times he made world class saves and looked as if he had
returned to the form which had Smith rate him the best goalkeeper in
Britain.
Rangers went into the game without skipper Richard Gough but there is
nothing seriously wrong with the defender. Explained Smith: ''Richard
has a slight injury and on these hard grounds I didn't want to take any
risks.''
RANGERS -- Goram, Wright, Robertson, Moore, McLaren, Reid, Miller,
Gascoigne, Ferguson, Hateley, Laudrup. Substitutes -- Steven, McCall,
Durrant, Durie, Mikhailichenko.

PENTIRE, racing's equivalent of the ugly duckling, can show the world
he is truly a swan by landing the Group One King George VI And Queen
Elizabeth Diamond Stakes at Ascot today.
The transformation through the winter has not been one from muddy down
to a imperious white plumage, but more like useful performer to champion
middle-distance three-year-old elect.
Make no mistake, that will be Pentire's mantle if he humbles Lammtarra
and company in today's #340,000-added race.
As a juvenile, he showed plenty of ability without for a moment
suggesting he would scale the heights. Things have been very different
in 1995, however, as Pentire goes into the King George with an unbeaten
record for the season.
Pentire, who will prove well-suited by the prevailing conditions,
should prove up to his first Group One test.
Of the Maktoum challenge, the most potent threat looks to be
Lammtarra, due to be ridden by Frankie Dettori after the baffling
decision by connections to axe Walter Swinburn.

Anne Simpson talks to Vitali Vitaliev who longed for 'Britain's
shabbiness and grace'
VITALI Vitaliev . . . the very name spells animation, a life
tirelessly on the move. And it is true, Vitaliev inhabits mobility as if
it were his home, the only significant furniture being his ethnic
complications. These he intones with a blade of satire in his voice, as
if recalling the nitpicking of some petty Soviet bureaucrat: Jewish by
origin, Ukrainian by birth, Russian by culture, European by instinct,
Australian by passport, British by residence. It adds up to what?
Vitaliev shrugs, incredulous as anyone. Is he a global nuisance? A
clapped-out empire thought so, which is why he now describes himself as
a vagabond, but a vagabond captivated by hotels.
That, anyway, is the story so far. But even in the worst of times when
the might of the Soviet Union crushed the very breath of freedom from
its people Vitaliev was, by emotion, a buccaneer. In order to dream that
he was living elsewhere he learned foreign languages compulsively, and
for 30 years the child, the journalist, and the husband in him absorbed
every twist and turn of remote voyagers through books.
''We were duped by an appalling patriotism,'' he reflects. ''The
patriotism of lies which told us that because the motherland loved us we
must lead isolated lives in the largest cage in the world.'' No real
mother ever maimed her children so.
In Edinburgh, the other day, Vitaliev was promoting Little Is The
Light, his fifth book of humorous insights on the West, and once more he
was relishing the floating anywhere-ambience of hotels.
His bleak experience of empire spurred this latest travelogue, a
journey through nationhood in miniature, which focuses Vitaliev's
idiosyncratic eye on 11 tiny European states from the Faroes to Andorra,
from Liechtenstein to the Isle of Man.
What emerges is a hymn to smallness and the bravery of those who
defend their culture against the big batallions and, in so doing,
acquire a self-esteem.But, as the world knows, small countries can also
be the dung heaps of bigotry, national pride souring into national
conceit and, worse still, the poison of corrupted nationalism. Look at
former Yugoslavia where territorial wars stain everything with hate. In
trying to comprehend that horror Vitaliev crafts a metaphor of the kind
that is never far from a Soviet victim's psyche.
The dismay of ages fills his voice, and his conviviality seems suddenly
rammed by the hopelessness of it all: ''For me, poor trampled Bosnia is
like a person who has lived all his life in a prison cell with no
daylight, and the belief that the world is a plate of soup. One day a
sympathetic jailor shows him a little window in the ceiling, and he sees
outside just a fraction of a wonderful world with sky and colour, and
pine trees.
''So, now he knows that he has been cheated; the world is not a plate
of soup. But instead of rejoicing, he tries to redress the injustices
visited on him. In anger he wants to reclaim years that cannot be
returned. He seeks recompense through violence from the person in a
neighbouring cell where he believes the view is better. And once he has
broken the boundary into vengeance and barbarity he, too, is lost
because he can never step back . . .''
Moscow's perestroika promised so much, and for a while came good. But
just when things were looking up for Vitali Vitaliev, KGB harassment
forced him into exile.
So, in 1990 Vitaliev came West, arriving first in Britain to be
embraced by the jesting Socrates, Clive James. Through James's good
offices he acquired a TV persona, but even if a vagabond may call the
world his home, he sometimes finds it inhospitable: Britain refused
Vitaliev a visa.
The solution, encouraged James, was to point himself and his family
towards Australia, and thus Vitaliev became a columnist on the Melbourne
Age and the Sydney Morning Herald. Did paradise beckon? Admiring
readers, a big house and swimming pool, a happy wife, a son excited by
shimmering horizons . . . no matter how moved by Australia's kindness,
Vitaliev felt himself bereft. His sudden freedom seemed to be
evaporating in the tyranny of Australia's distance.
''For 35 years I had lived with the great emptiness of
totalitarianism,'' he says, ''but in Melbourne I couldn't find myself
creatively there either. I missed Europe too much. I missed the smell of
flowers, the colour of the sky, and I longed for Britain's shabbiness
and grace.''
To escape his loss, Vitaliev would take off whenever possible for
Tasmania. There, amid its small scale and European sensibility, he would
be almost moved to tears, and inevitably such pining brought him back.
So, today he is based in London, a recognised figure from his engaging
television documentaries, and a regular contributor to the European.
''To be rootless is important for a writer because it helps to make him
objective, but I have paid a heavy price for it. My wife and I are now
divorced, and Mitya, my only child who is 15, stays with her in
Australia.''
As for his own childhood Vitaliev returned to the Ukraine some years
ago to discover that everything he remembered had been bulldozed as
unimportant.
''My childhood country didn't exist anymore except in my memory, but I
carry that horrible, dear place inside me wherever I go.''
Although he insists his interest in Russia has drained away, the
country clearly haunts him: ''I wrote the other week that I was ashamed
to be associated with Russia because of what it had done in Chechnya --
and this at a time, when the Government asks Germany to apologise for
the atrocities of the Second World War. So, nothing has changed. The
lies continue and people in power suppress their guilt. Why else is
Yeltsin drinking himself to death?''
Vitaliev is, if anything, a reversed ageist in his attitude to
countries: ''Beauty is a category of age and for me Australia is a
teenage girl, the land where I first allowed myself to write lyrically,
and for that I will always be grateful. But Britain is the older woman:
experienced, elegant, often complaining but eternally seductive.''
So there it is, the life of the vagabond turned Commonwealth citizen
contained within a piquant symmetry of its own. Vitali Vitaliev swapped
one crumbling empire for another, only this time he can say the
motherland is not the country of his birth, but the country where he
started growing.

TOMMY McLean's turbulent career as manager of Hearts came to an end
yesterday when he was sacked by club chairman Chris Robinson following
weeks of speculation and in-fighting.
A brief statement by the chairman confirmed the move, with
compensation still to be agreed between the two parties. Now the way
could be paved for a legal battle.
Relations between McLean, who moved to Tynecastle from his job as
manager of Motherwell only 13 months ago, and his chairman had recently
become more strained and it emerged during the last week that McLean had
offered to resign on several occasions.
It also was claimed that, with two years left of his contract, the
manager would be prepared to go, if a compensation figure could be
agreed.
The situation, however, took a new twist yesterday when chairman
Robinson said: ''It is with some regret that I confirm the termination
today of Tommy McLean's position as manager of Hearts.
''Whilst there has been recent comment about Mr McLean resigning his
position, the board have found it quite intolerable that someone in Mr
McLean's position should make public statements, some totally untrue and
damaging, about the confidential affairs of the club, including player
contracts and negotiations.''
Earlier this week, Hearts did offer McLean an undisclosed pay-off to
quit the club, but it is understood that it was only in the region of
#50,000. McLean was expecting almost double that.
McLean, who left Tynecastle at lunchtime yesterday, would only
comment: ''I don't want to say anything until I have spoken to my legal
advisors.''
Robinson took over Hearts from Wallace Mercer, he sacked Sandy Clark
and installed McLean, who had spent 10 years at Motherwell -- years in
which he had helped to wipe out debts at Fir Park and put the club in a
good financial position. On the playing side, he led the Lanarkshire
side to the Scottish Cup in 1991 and twice steered them into Europe.
A month after quitting Motherwell, the call came from Hearts, and
McLean could not resist the chance to work with one of Scotland's
biggest clubs. It seemed, however, doomed to fail from the start.
He was promised a budget to strengthen the squad, but that never
happened. The club was faced with ongoing financial problems, including
the upgrading of the stadium, and instead of buying new players, McLean
was forced to sell.
Alan McLaren went to Rangers for #1.2m and Tosh McKinlay moved to
Celtic for #350,000, and the manager had to stand by in frustration as
the money from those sales went elsewhere.
There was also the case of a failed share issues venture which raised
less than it cost to set up, and in recent weeks there was even a
question over who would own the club. All of this was hardly conducive
to building a base where Hearts could work their way back to the top of
Scottish football.
The club presently has an overdraft of more than #4m and other smaller
amounts owing to other creditors come to just under #300,000.
Former club chairman Wallace Mercer will see them in court within
weeks over #125,000 which they failed to pay, as agreed, last month. It
represented the first of six annual instalments to pay for the balance
of last summer's shares transaction when the club changed hands.
Yet, despite the upheavals, McLean helped Hearts to win their premier
division survival battle last season, and took them to the Tennents
Scottish Cup semi-final.
Now the club faces further legal action as McLean chases adequate
compensation, and lack of money could hinder Hearts in any move they
have in mind of going for a ''sitting'' manager to replace him.
Falkirk manager Jim Jefferies, a former captain of Hearts, is one name
being shouted around, but he said yesterday, before taking the
Brockville players to the Highlands: ''I'm manager of Falkirk, preparing
to take my team up north for pre-season matches.''
Jimmy Nicholl, of Raith Rovers, was another name being mentioned, but,
because of the financial situation, I would not be at all surprised if
Hearts made an appointment from within, either coaches Eamonn Bannon or
Walter Kidd, who will be in charge of training in the interim -- or even
the appointment of a player-manager. Senior players who could fill that
role are Craig Levein and Dave McPherson.

PARTICK Thistle will this afternoon hope to keep alive their hopes of
claiming a place in the UEFA Cup when they play their final sectional
match against the Croation side Zagreb at Firhill -- but even a victory
may not be enough for John Lambie's men. .
French club Metz have already made sure of winning the group, but
Thistle can hope to claim one of the spots in the next round, reserved
for the best second-placed sides, if they win today and Metz beat Linzer
of Austria.
Thistle manager John Lambie had hoped to include a new signing, but
last night there was a hiccup over the proposed swop deal which would
have taken St Johnstone's Harry Curran to Firhill with striker Roddy
Grant heading back to McDiarmid Park. ''The deal isn't dead yet, but
there is still some negotiating to be done,'' said Lambie.
Thistle also have huge injury problems, with Alan Dinnie, Steve
Pittman, Calum Milne, and Kevin McKee all struggling to be fit. Said
Lambie: ''I will be lucky to have one of them in my side, but there is a
plus in the fact that striker Rod McDonald,, who missed our last match,
will be back.
''I know there were some who doubted the wisdom of our taking part,
but my players will have played four matches on quality grounds and
against quality opposition. I think the exercise has been worthwhile.''

* AS you wait patiently for the first succulent, ripe tomatoes from
your greenhouse or conservatory, spare a thought for the war raging
between Germany and Holland, writes Ian Walls.
Germany has always been a big importer of Dutch tomatoes, but this
year's crop has been labelled Wasserbomben aus Holland -- or Dutch
waterbombs -- because, say the Germans, the quality is so poor.
The problem is the method of culture, which involves hydroponics, and
the Germans claim this has a severe effect on fruit quality. The harm to
the Dutch glasshouse industry is tremendous, with forecasts of a 20%
failure rate among growers unless things improve.
One solution may be to develop still further the techniques of selling
on the truss, which prove to customers that the tomatoes were grown in a
relatively conventional manner. There certainly has been criticism about
commercial growing methods which are boosting yields to unprecedented
levels.
Few commercial crops, other than those produced organically, now grow
in soil. Peat-based grow-bags are the most popular amateur method and
they are reasonably successful and produce good-quality fruit.
Probably the best and most tasty fruit come from growing in soil, or
soil-manure mixes. I grow all mine in greenhouse borders and the family
seem perfectly happy.
It will be interesting to see the outcome of this tomato war. The
Dutch are resilient. If changes are needed, they will make them.

THE thing about Bob Downe is that he wants to be Roger Moore in The
Spy Who Loved Me more than I do. He wears a killer safari suit. Other
secret agents may deal death with a flame-throwing pen, Bob dances us to
death with disco tracks, Fame and I Will Always Love You. Judging by the
ecstatic audience reaction -- he literally couldn't leave the stage --
Glasgow will always love him. Here hecklers don't harass, they just
can't contain their unbridled passion. The girl next to me asked Bob if
he had a video to promote, before giving him a wrapped square of caramel
shortbread. Even with an audience fed on caster sugar Bob is sweet
enough.
He's also camp as a big tent, which is exactly where he found himself,
dishing out laughs like the Minister of Fun. What is it about Australia
and tack? It's as if the entire continent was bought at a car boot sale,
or swapped for Kerplunk! and a Scalextrix set. It revels in it, and Bob
Downe is the cultural attache, a vision, first in a light blue
shell-suit, all man-made fibres, white BhS socks, and Hush Puppy
loafers.
His actual comic material, Slyvanian Waters, day-time TV and Opray
meets Michael Jackson is three years out of date and relatively
chuckle-free. But when it's strained through the perfect white teeth of
such a bizarre character, it becomes as sharp and tangy as Listermint.
Bob might not swallow, but we all do.

Paid as well as you played is the hard lesson
EVEN if it is a risky business, predicting great things for embryo
star turns is an exercise in which we all like to indulge.
In golf, Scotland seems to be going through a particularly exciting
period, with amateurs like Gordon Sherry and Stephen Gallacher preparing
to move sooner or later into the professional arena.
They have what it takes to do well, but they ought to be aware that,
once they cross that great divide between amateur and pro, life is very
different indeed.
Andrew Coltart would be able to fill in the blanks for them. The
25-year-old from Thornhill is still learning the business at the
pay-packet end, where playing a game is transformed into working for a
living.
Coltart, who turned professional four years ago, has made significant
progress in that time, and is now doing a good deal better than earning
his keep. The next stage for him will be winning, and then winning
again. After that, who can tell?
He talks with some passion about the traumatic time it can be for a
new young pro on the Tour. He gradually had improved as an amateur to
the point where he had made it into the Walker Cup team, as well as the
Eisenhower Trophy side and the World Cup. ''I decided it was time to
give it a go as a professional. I had only played in one pro tournament,
the English Open, and suddenly I was thrown into a bewildering new
world.
''There were guys who were household names out on the practice range
hitting balls beside me. I didn't know people. You are inclined to feel
lonely. When I played in tournaments I would stare at big stars walking
up the next fairway.
'''I also went into my first tournament thinking I would win #40,000
right away. I was trying shots that were impossible, instead of playing
the percentages.''
The consequence of this dramatic change of lifestyle was that Coltart
ended his first year depressed and disappointed, but he did not allow
thoughts of quitting to enter his head. He had won #9763 . . . ''not
enough to pay the bills.''
It may not have seemed like it at the time, but this was the
apprenticeship, the hard school that needs to be experienced before the
good times can be contemplated. The young man who had believed since he
was about 13 that golf would be his life had absorbed the lessons. The
steel, the single-minded application and the conviction that he would
succeed were in place. He was also helped greatly by Chubby Chandler,
whose ISM agency look after his interests.
The next year was entirely different. He won the Scottish Professional
championship, the first time he had played in it, had seven top-10
finishes on the European Tour, and collected #286,960, more than enough
pennies to pay off the wolf at the door. He also won the Australian PGA
title in Sidney.
He has his own explanation as to why there was such an uspurge. ''It
was all different for me then. I knew the people on the Tour, like a big
family. I knew the places to stay, the countries and the courses. I was
not lonely any more, and the whole thing seemed so much friendlier.''
He started this year feeling good about himself but, as he says, golf
soon knocks any fanciful ideas into the rough. He did finish fourth in
the Johnnie Walker Classic, second in the Catalonia Open, tied fourth in
the French Open, but otherwise, he has not had a great time.
''I had played an awful lot of golf in 12 months and I felt tired. I
decided to take a couple of weeks off, and I feel the better for it.''
He agrees, albeit a bit grudgingly, that his progress has been
satisfactory. ''If someone had said a couple of years ago that, after 12
months, I would have played in the Dunhill Cup, the World Cup, am now
playing in my fourth Open, have a chance of getting a Dunhill Cup place
again, and have the possibility of a Ryder Cup spot, of course I would
have been delighted.''
But he thinks a little about that report card, and adds: ''I don't
want to be an also-ran. I want to finish well up there nearly every
week. I am a bit more seasoned now. I don't care who I am paired with. I
have a job to do and I want to get on with it.''
Like everybody else, Coltart has a high opinion of Gordon Sherry and
is confident that the young man from Kilmarnock will be a big success
when he does get around to turning pro. ''If he can just play as he is
doing, he won't have a problem, but if comes out expecting to break
records, to be the Rookie of the Year and winning tournaments, that
would put pressure on him.
''I put myself under a little pressure and kept shooting myself in the
foot all the time.''
He has moved a distance along the road since then and looks very
capable of taking the Coltart golfing family track record to new
heights. His great grandgather was a founder member of Thornhill Golf
Club, his grandfather was a scratch player and his dad has got close to
a 1 handicap.
His father, Robert, has been the biggest golfing influence in his
life. ''He used to take me as a wee boy to the course. I would be about
four or five at the time and I would sit on his trolley until we reached
the green. I would then putt. If I took 4 and he scored a 5, I won.''
He progressed to the bigger boys' game in due course, playing in his
first Scottish Schoolboys' championship when he was 13.
It was about then that he made up his mind to concentrate on golf,
giving up football, tennis, badminton etc, at which he had also shown
talent. By the time he had won the Scottish amateur strokeplay title,
and finished runner-up in the Scottish Amateur, he had become fully
confident in his abilities and felt good enough to have a go at the pro
world.
He got through with the help of his parents and is gradually making a
name for himself. The name is not quite well enough known yet to put the
man with a similar name, racing driver David Coulthard, in the shade.
The two are mistaken for each other, it seems. Certainly, Andrew tells
of the time he was signing autographs at a Variety Club function when he
saw a little boy sheepishly hanging back with autograph book in hand.
''His mum ushered him forward, saying: go on, this man drives fast
cars.''
Still, he has been told that the other Coulthard has had a similar
experience, although he suspects it was said just to make him feel
better. ''I don't know if it is true, but apparently David arrived at
Glasgow airport, rushed into a taxi and the driver, looking in his
mirror, said: 'I should know that face, shouldn't I? You have had an
awfy good season in the golf.' ''
He might be an even bigger name one day. Coltart, the golfer, that is.

RANGERS' patient pursuit of Romanian striker Florin Raducioiu will pay
off within the next three days.
Raducioiu, who said earlier that he was not ready to move to Scotland,
appears to have changed his mind after talks with his Spanish club,
Espanol, and his agent.
Now he will become Rangers' third major close season signing, with his
#2.7m fee pushing the Ibrox transfer budget for the close season towards
the #9m mark.
Already Paul Gascoigne has joined the Scottish champions from Italian
club Lazio for #4.3m. Full back Stephen Wright has also arrived at Ibrox
from Aberdeen with his fee, still to be set by a tribunal, surely
nudging #1.5m.
I understand that Brian Laudrup, who played with Raducioiu in Italy
with AC Milan, has helped to convince him that Rangers are poised to
become a major power in Europe.
Manager Walter Smith may have to break away from the club's Denmark
tour to finalise a signing which will boost the club's chances of
reaching the European Champions' League, and making an impression once
they get there.

TOP seed Kenny Wood became the first player for 26 years to
successfully defend the men's singles title at the Scottish Grasscourt
Championships at the Dyvours Club in Edinburgh yesterday.
Wood led Calum McKnight 5-2 in the first set witih McKnight twice
double-faulting on break point.
But McKnight recovered and broke Wood's serve to love and then served
a love game to cut the deficit to 4-5.
Wood was more consistent and quickly took the first set, then broke
his opponent's serve in the fifth and seventh games of the second set,
for a 6-4, 6-2 victory.
''I thought Calum actually played better tennis than me but he didn't
do it consistently enough,'' Wood said.
Heather Lockhart of Newlands had to work hard to retain her women's
singles title. She came back after losing the first set to win 4-6, 6-3,
6-3 against Nicola Burns of Whitecraigs. Finals results:
Men's Singles: K Wood (Caledonian) bt C McKinght (Newlands) 6-4, 6-2;
Women's Singles: H Lockhart (Newlands) bt N Burns (Whitecraigs) 4-6,
6-3, 6-3. Men's Doubles: McKnight and M Watt (Newlands) bt J Russell and
T Smith (both Giffnock) 7-5, 6-3. Women's Doubles: Lockhart and Burns bt
F Reid and A Wood (both Dunfermline) 6-2, 6-4; Mixed Doubles: McKnight
and Burns bt J Thomson (Braid) and J Denholm (Erskine) 6-3, 6-4.
* CHRIS Wilkinson, one of two remaining Britons in the Manchester
Challenger, booked his place in the last four with a hard fought success
at Didsbury yesterday over former Wimbledon junior champion Diego
Nargiso.
Wilkinson later described his 7-6, 6-7, 6-3 success as ''one of my
best ever''.
Wilkinson, who meets fellow Briton Mark Petchey in today's semi-final,
added: ''If I can play like that more often I will be right up in the
top 50.''
Petchey succeeded where Davis Cup colleague Tim Henman failed, beating
Sander Groen of Holland 7-6, 6-4.
The first semi-final will be an all-German affair between Christian
Saceanu and fifth seed Arne Thoms.

THEY were once collectively known as the Big Three, a trio of golfers
who dominated the sport for three decades, and many still believe that
it was due to their brilliance that the game was hoisted to a worldwide
popularity it had not enjoyed previously. Gary Player, Arnold Palmer,
and Jack Nicklaus may be in the twilight zone of their careers, but the
testament to their durability is the size of galleries they still take
around with them at the Open.
Palmer, naturally, attracted the most as he went round the Old Course
yesterday for the last time in this championship, Nicklaus showed
immense strength of character to shoot a 70 after his trials of the
previous day, but it was Player who showed his two old pals a thing or
two by ending his second round with an aggregate 144, level par, to
qualify for the last two days -- later to be joined unexpectedly by
Nicklaus.
At 59, the South African is the oldest man to make it through to the
last stage of the Open in modern times. He did so wrapped up in his
waterproof suit trying to fend off a heavy cold that had him wearing two
pairs of pyjamas the night before. ''I tried to sweat it out, but I
don't feel too good.''
Player, who had a 73, admitted that even he thought qualifying for the
later stages was quite a feat. ''Although I have this cold I think that
my general fitness is one reason I have made it. The pin placements are
as difficult as I have ever seen them on this course.''
He coped well with the inevitable huge putts on the Old Course, some
of which are longer than you take the dog a walk. He is enjoying a
rather more comfortable time than he did when he first came to the Open
here in 1957. He remembers sleeping on the beach on the first night
before being able to find a bed-and-breakfast vacancy.
Today could be a bit special even by Player standards as his horse,
Broadway Flyer, runs in the King George Vl and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at
Ascot.
Player, one of only four golfers who have won all four majors (the
others are Nicklaus, Gene Sarazen, and Ben Hogan), had a birdie 3 at the
seventh but was proud of the run-up shot he played to give him a chance
of par at the last. ''I used a No.7 iron and ran it 112 yards.''
Palmer, however, will not be joining him, having played a very
emotional last Open round -- he shot 75 -- to end a playing association
that goes back 35 years. No-one who was there yesterday will forget the
ovation he received along the eighteenth fairway and all of us who
listened to him in the interview tent later will carry that memory for a
long time.
The sight of other players, officials, and the entire gallery on both
sides of the fairway applauding the slightly hunched figure who had
removed his cap to wave to the throngs was hard to remove from the
mind's eye.
Among the army of photographers, and almost unnoticed, went Mark
McCormack, snapping away with his camera at the man who was his first
client in the organisation which has grown to be the biggest sports
management company in the world.
The great man himself tried hard to hold on to his emotions. ''I
promised I would not get sentimental,'' he said. ''So would you guys not
ask me questions I find hard to answer.'' He failed, just, to keep his
promise, stopping on occasion to swallow hard, blink, and occasionally
exhale loudly, trying to stave off the flood of memories that clearly
were close to engulfing him.
''I guess it is over,'' he said quietly.
''Coming up the eighteenth I couldn't help but think back to 1960 and
what did for me. It brought a lot of happy times both golfingwise and
socially.
''I think now about finishing second to Nagle at St Andrews, about
winning at Birkdale and Troon, about the friendships I have made here.
It has been a very happy time.''
He reminded us of one year having to qualify for the Open even though
he had won the US Open and the Masters, and again after he had actually
won the championship at Royal Birkdale he still had to qualify for Troon
where he won again. ''The young guys don't believe it when I tell
them.''
He intends to come back to St Andrews in September to play in the
Autumn Medal, which is his right as an honorary member of the R and A.
''I have played like a handicapper this week, I might as well be one.''
When he came to the end of the chat he was close to losing his battle
with his emotions, but reached out and finished off a glass of whisky.
''There is nothing like a good drink of Scotch to soothe things.''
Meanwhile, Nicklaus, whose temper had almost cracked when he took four
to get out of Hell Bunker on Thursday, demonstrated what a courageous
golfer he is by shooting a two-under-par 70, which still left him four
over for the tournament.
The steel of the man can be gauged by the fact that after that 10 the
previous day he did not have a bogey in the next 22 holes he played.
Like his colleagues of the Big Three, Jack showed us this week that they
really don't make them this way any more.

IT DEPENDS on how you view life, but it could be argued that the
defection of the three Craig brothers -- Mark, Richie, and James -- from
West of Scotland to Hawick over the summer is one of the most severe
blows that Glasgow rugby has had.
The fact that three ambitious backs from the West feel the need to go
down to the Borders to further their rugby careers is surely a slap in
the face for Glasgow rugby in one way or another. A time to investigate
our belly buttons perhaps.
Two of Mrs Margaret Craig's ''Lisbon Cubs'' as she affectionately
calls them -- they do, after all, have a rather famous dad -- already
are down in Hawick. Elder brother Mark is on a course with his employers
in Hull, but training hard.
They like what they have experienced so far, and in all their
decision-making, the guiding hand of former Celt Jim is there to be
seen.
''Rugby as a game is fundamentally flawed,'' says father. ''If your
forwards don't win the ball in rugby, then the backs don't get it. They
were not getting that at West of Scotland.''
Of all three sons, it is the youngest, James, who has created the
latest impact. Quite extraordinary for a boy who last year was still at
school. I still remember him producing two blistering breaks against the
New Zealand Schools at Murrayfield, and they were, it would appear,
enough to get the talent scouts sweating.
It has been said that he could be the fastest thing on two legs in
Scottish rugby. The problem quickly arose of who to play for.
''James used to come with me to watch Mark play for West on a Saturday
afternoon,'' said Jim. ''He noticed straight away that Mark stood there
for most of the game waiting to receive a pass, and he said that there
was no way that he was going to do the same thing on the other wing this
season.''
Eldest son Mark said one reason for leaving was a lack of coaching,
and that was where Hawick stepped in. ''I played for Hawick in the
sevens at the end of last year and I really enjoyed it. They seemed
ambitious, which was more than could be said for West of Scotland. I
don't think that I have ever been coached properly at West, although I'm
not saying that there are not any good coaches in Glasgow.
''It was then that I really started to think about moving. It was a
shame really, but West didn't seem to have any massive enthusiasm to
progress. As three young players, we had to decide what we could do to
help us up the ladder.''
As it transpired, three clubs -- Hawick, Heriot's, and Glasgow Accies
-- made direct approaches to the Craig brothers to join, and, with
perhaps more of a footballing father's approach, Jim and Margaret Craig
travelled down to Hawick to meet representatives of the club to find out
just exactly how they intended to play the game, and how they would look
after the boys.
The name Jim Renwick kept cropping up. A former player like Renwick,
who has more knowledge than many a more celebrated figure, would appear
to be a huge magnet for aspiring players, especially fellow backs, and
Renwick's ability has undoubtedly been dangled like a juicy carrot in
front of the Glasgow-based family.
Frankly, they haven't been disappointed so far during early season
training. ''Richie and James have both said that the things they have
been doing in training have been excellent and they have learned a lot
from Jim Renwick. I also admire him, and I chatted to him before we
decided to come down,'' said Mark.
It may be good for Hawick, but it certainly isn't good for Glasgow,
and that really does apply whether or not you believe the brothers are
world beaters. The fact is that we need every bit of talent to stay in
the city to get our rugby progressing here. I understand that Hawick
have offered no cash.
The boys rent the flat they live in. It is simply a good old fashioned
case of one club convincing three lads that they alone can help them get
on. Frankly, Hawick got their act together, pushed the right buttons,
and made a concerted effort to get the Craig boys. Nobody else really
did.
Dad Jim sums it up about right. '' Just like moving club, it is now
entirely up to them.'' I agree. I'm will enjoy watching how this one
unfolds.

Thrills and spills galore as Jock rallies to the challenge
HORSES used to be the sporting passion in the life of Jock Armstrong,
but he has been seduced from his first love by horsepower, and is now
being touted as the next Scot to make an impact in motorsport.
The 25-year-old Armstrong, from Clarebrand, near Castle Douglas, is
currently lying sixth after three events in his debut season in the
British Rally Championship. Despite piloting a left-hand drive car for
the first time, he is leading many experienced veterans, and is second
in the race for the Formula 2 amateur award.
His charge through the rankings has been lubricated by the Shell Helix
Rally Scholarship, granted annually to two drivers -- Lancastrian Neil
Simpson is the other. It provides complete support including cars,
engines, spares, tyres, mechanics, and hotel accommodation, and is worth
a total of #1m this year.
Jock, who owns a small building firm, previously rallied on a
shoestring, patching up second and third-hand cars.
''You know who your friends are then,'' says Jock. ''My pal, Joe Hunt,
often works till midnight, rebuilding and preparing cars. I virtually
wrote off a new car -- second hand to me -- then had to rebuild it
again. I spent #5000 on tyres alone last year. For each rally, you need
18, at #75 a time, plus VAT. One set may last only 150 stage miles.''
But the scholarship has changed that, providing the very best tuition.
Fellow Scot Alister McRae was the inaugural winner three years ago, and
he and his father, rallying guru Colin, are advisers to the students who
race the Ulster Championship next weekend.
Armstrong was launched by a family tradition. His sister Barbara was a
fairly experienced driver when Jock beat her, aged 19, in his first
event, the Galloway Hills rally. He finished with every body panel bent.
Barbara now makes a living by coaching for the John Watson Rally School
at Silverstone, and her former navigator, John Richardson, is now her
brother's partner.
His other sister, Janet had only one season in karts, but won the
Scottish title -- the only woman in a field of 40. In a different age
group, but often practising along with her, was a youngster called David
Coulthard, who lived just over the hill, five miles from the Armstrong
home. ''Lap for lap, I could hold my own with him,'' said Janet, whose
skip hire business has co-sponsored her brother along with her mother's
taxi business.
Janet clearly has a forgiving nature. After she had driven just 25
laps in a brand new kart -- a teenage Christmas present -- the
13-year-old Jock pleaded for a shot, then buckled the chassis on his
first lap.
As a youngster, Jock was into eventing and show jumping, even
quadrathlons involving shooting, running, swimming and riding. He won
the Stewartry Show in three successive years, and once took the first
three places in the New Galloway Show, on his own horse, a borrowed one,
and a hand-me-down from one of his sisters.
Though he excelled as a horseman, however, he felt the sport was ''for
women -- a bit cissy.'' He hated riding lessons because he felt ill
every time he made the car journey to the stables. ''I remember feeling
humiliated when I was sick all down the back of the drivers' seat. I was
the world's worst passenger.''
But his stomach did not even turn over when his Nissan Sunny did,
spectacularly, on the Drummond Hill stage during last month's Scottish
Rally. Indeed, after the spill, pictured above, spectators had them on
their way within seconds.
Brought up on a farm, Jock grabbed every chance to get behind the
wheel of anything with an engine -- including his mother's Rover. When
he was 13, he reversed it into a truck and mangled the rear end. ''I was
not allowed in any car for a long time,'' he recalls.
''I used to take old cars into the barley stubble, when I was about
12, and waltz them round a figure-of-eight course, between cones, for
hours. When the cones were flattened or knocked over, I would spin the
car round the only other obstacle, a telegraph pole. My cousin, Sandy,
would shout 'you're much too close.'''
Now Richardson is the balancing influence, warning when Jock is
pushing too close to the limit. But Armstrong insists: ''You never think
about that. It doesn't pay to have too much imagination. It just stops
you from going fast.
''I've had my moments, going wild and playing to my pals. But I've
learned that's no good. I have learned to drive at nine-tenths. It does
not do to go shunting cars. People are looking for a good, clean, safe
driver, showing a bit of experience and maturity. It is hard, because my
inclination is to drive flat out.''
The voice of reason appears to have helped.
Standing in the driveway at Clarebrand, his Nissan looked tempting.
''Nice car,'' I said in a moment of mimicking madness. ''Want to show me
what it can do?
''You bet.''
I sat beside Armstrong for less than four minutes, strapped,
reassuringly rigid, into the intimately buttock-hugging navigator's seat
of the 2000cc injection machine.
During that time we covered nearly six miles in Glengap, a special
forest stage used during the Scottish Rally. The car rarely seemed to be
travelling in a straight line along the corkscrewing dirt track which
passed for a road.
Yet there was no wrestling with the wheel. Armstrong's movements were
smooth and unhurried, except when his arm shot out like a striking
cobra, making constant gear changes.
Mesmerised, I could barely take my eyes from the trail as it unfolded,
frequently only to be seen through the side windows. When I managed to
do so, I observed the speedo needle hovering around 150kph, immediately
prior to Armstrong's left foot dabbing delicately, almost caressingly,
at the brake pedal. His right, on the accelerator, seemingly remained
rooted to the floor.
The car occasionally managing to get airborne. Jock, apologised for
such a tame ride. ''This is just a reconnaissance car. I don't want to
do too much damage.''
To be honest, it was life's second greatest thrill. Or in Hugh Grant
terms of endearment, the best fun to be had in a car without disturbing
one's clothing. Perhaps that's why the constant crescendo, as rocks and
debris were hurled into the floorpan and side panels, conjured the image
of a biscuit tin subjected to an Old Testament stoning, the penalty for
adultery.
That was when I understood why Jock Armstrong had fallen in love with
rallying.

THE form of the Epsom Derby has not worked out as well as it might,
but punters are still advised to follow Lammtarra for Ascot's feature
race, the Diamond Stakes.
It is impossible to exaggerate the scale of his Derby achievement.
Lammtarra is only the second horse this century to carry off Britain's
biggest race on his seasonal debut and he had to find an astonishing
burst of speed from off the pace to do it.
Despite an interrupted preparation, further improvement can be
expected. He is preferred to Carnegie, who has yet to win on firm
ground, and Pentire.
Blue Duster is the banker on the card and a worthy favourite for the
Princess Margaret Stakes.
She won the Queen Mary Stakes impressively and ran on in a way that
suggests she will get the extra furlongs.
Of her rivals, only Ribot's Secret has run in Pattern company and she
is well held on a line through Sweet Robin.
Wizard King has the class to defy top weight to land the Crocker
Bulteel Handicap.
He won the Britannia Handicap over course and distance last year and
looked better than ever on his reappearance when caught on the line in a
Listed race run at a cracking pace.
At Newmarket, the Aphrodite Stakes can go to Ellie Ardensky. A
progessive sort, she impressed winning at Ripon in May and that form has
been boosted by the subsequent wins of those behind her.
She is expected to rise to this challenge.
Sweet Magic has gone close in his three races this season and can
finish in front today in the Chemist Brokers Handicap.
He runs best over the minimum trip and last time out was a creditable
second in the valuable Gosforth's Park Cup.
On a line through Shadow Jury, third that day, he should have the edge
on Fairy Wind, who won recently over course and distance against more
modest opposition.
* LAST week, Robin Cook's tip, Naked Welcome, came in at 6-1, to give
him three winning naps in the past month, the others being Bold Effort
(10-1) and Salt Lake (9-1).

MEMORIES of the ill-fated February night against Gerald McClellan are
bound to be vivid when Nigel Benn steps back into the ring at the London
Arena tonight to protect his WBC super-middleweight crown for the eighth
time against Italy's Vincenzo Nardiello.
Just how Benn copes with overcoming that traumatic event of five
months ago will hold the key to the level of his performance against the
29-year-old Nardiello, from the Rome port of Ostia.
During the build-up, Benn has been positive, cheerful and focussed on
the job, declaring: ''The old animal is back. I've no fear of going back
to the London Arena. The McClellan fight was one of those things that
happened.''
Benn suffered a fractured nose and jaw against McClellan, as well as
passing blood and shaking uncontrollably -- and he even hyperventilated
in the dressing room after the fearful action.
Former European champion Nardiello, on the face of it, does not
possess the fire-power to physically trouble the 31-year-old champion.
Nardiello has a high guard and nagging jab, but is vulnerable to the
right hand, probably the best weapon in Benn's artillery.
If all goes to plan, Benn could appear on the Oliver McCall-Frank
Bruno WBC heavyweight title bill at Wembley Stadium 42 days later -- and
may even fit in another defence before tackling the WBC's leading
contender Thulane ''Sugar Boy'' Malinga, of South Africa.

VfB Lubeck 1, Celtic 2.
MANAGER Tommy Burns was last night guardedly optimistic about adding
the German international striker Andreas Thom and Dundee United sweeper
Gordan Petric to his squad in the near future.
Burns arrived at Lubeck barely an hour before the opening match of
Celtic's German campaign having been delayed in transfer negotiations.
After seeing his side make an impressive start to their tour, he
revealed: ''If I get the news I'm hoping for, I would hope to make an
announcement within a couple of days, but at the moment I cannot make
any comment on our transfer dealings.''
Then, turning to his side's victory over the lively German outfit, he
added: ''The goals we scored through Pierre van Hooydonk and Andy Walker
were really special.
''I'm glad for Walker because he will be a very important player for
us in the coming season having recovered from all his injury problems.
''Van Hooydonk's goal from a free kick is something he does regularly
in training, and we will be looking for more like that in the weeks
ahead.
''It was impossible to play flat out in such humid conditions.
''Nevertheless I thought the players did very well considering we have
only been in training for six days and were up against a very competent
side.''
Celtic's opener came in 29 minutes when Dutchman van Hooydonk was
hauled down on the edge of the penalty area.
He took the kick himself and swerved it with his right foot into the
top right-hand corner of the net for a spectacular delivery.
Lubeck equalised in the second half after Celtic keeper Gordon
Marshall, defender Mark McNally and goalscorer van Hooydonk had been
replaced by Pat Bonner, Malky Mackay and Walker.
Lubeck's captain Holger Hinrichsen struck a speculative drive from 35
yards which went in off the post to deceive Bonner.
Somehow Celtic summoned the resources amid 90 degree heat to stage a
late revival, which was rewarded when Walker volleyed in from 15 yards
after John Collins had opened up the German defence.
* CELTIC announced yesterday that they had now sold a club record
21,000 season tickets and that the new stand is now a sell-out.
Some season tickets are still available for the south stand.
* DUNFERMLINE last night signed striker Andy Smith from fellow First
Division side Airdrie under freedom of contract.

Roy Gregor meets the new chairman of Scottish Milk and examines his
plans for the industry
THE new man responsible for getting Scotland's milk to the consumer,
either as milk, butter, cheese or chocolate products, sat at his desk
yesterday and joked: ''Thank goodness my wife is learning to drive a
tractor.''
It is just as well John Duncan, a 52-year-old dairy farmer from
Maybole, Ayrshire, has in his wife Marion a lady from a similar
background. For the foreseeable future he will see less of his 450 acres
of land and his 150 cows and the routine of milking, silage making, and
more milking. He will also have less time to indulge in his fishing
hobby.
Instead he will either be in the headquarters of Scottish Milk at
Underwood Road, Paisley, or he will attending meetings or answering his
telephone.
It was on Wednesday of this week that the farming industry was shocked
by a leadership coup at Scottish Milk, the fledgling successor to the
Scottish Milk Marketing Board. Lanarkshire farmer Jim Brown, the then
deputy chairman, was expected to move into the top slot of an
organisation that represents 80% of Scotland's milk producers, plus
another 160 from Cumbria. After reports that he had been knifed in the
back by fellow directors with whom he had worked for over 13 years, he
resigned and within an hour it was anounced that John Duncan, a board
member for only two years, was the new chairman.
Less than 24 hours later Duncan was in ''the lion's den'', in his own
words, by attending a producers' meeting in Jim Brown's backyard of
Strathaven.
''I know there has been some ill feeling but I have a job to do. We
have to make sure Scottish Milk producers are not tempted to go
elsewhere to sell their milk.''
One of the problems he faces is that the old SMMB owned its creameries
producing butter and cheese and this helped cope with the swings and
roundabouts of seasonal supplies. The removal of the statutory powers of
the board gave dairy farmers the freedom to choose where to send their
milk. But at what price?
The SMMB creameries, under the Scottish Pride label, were customers,
as were other cheese manufacturers and Nestles as well as the growing
pinta-selling giant Wiseman Dairies.
''We have to convince farmers that Scottish Milk can raise them a
realistic price in the market-place. Scottish Pride is a crucial outlet,
taking more than half the milk we produce.''
But he points out that profit margins in milk production are in
fractions of pence per litre. With the variation in production size
units he and his team have to balance out collection and delivery costs.
In an extreme example he tells of three successive occasions when a
tanker was called to a farm to uplift only 50 litres of milk, while
another was marketing 8000 litres from its herd. That is why there has
been the introduction of charges of #5 per call and one-tenth pence per
litre for collection.
''It would be difficult, if not impossible, to differentiate between
large and small producers and who is nearest to a delivery point.''
Another aspect is that of milk quality. Producers are paid according
to the protein and butterfat content of their milk -- important
considerations for processors but as yet little acknowledged by the
pinta-buyers. But Duncan believes that will change.
''We are beginning to see, and will see more, of the supermarket-led
consumer demand which exists in America. This not only relates to the
nutritional quality of milk but also the public image of dairy farming
with regard to animal welfare. So far we have a good record but we must
be prepared for any challenge by the public on the welfare issue.''
As a former member of the National Farmers' Union of Scotland animal
health and welfare committee he is well aware of the public pressures on
the industry. He also wants to see a renewal of the generic promotion of
milk as a health food but, like his followers, wants to know who will
pay for it and how it can be generated since there is no longer a
Scottish Dairy Council.
The last year, he says, has been traumatic for many in the dairy
industry. ''After deregulation we had a dilemma of which way to jump in
the open market. There is a new generation of milk producers knowing
they have access to other outlets.
Duncan is also concerned about the lack of opportunities for anyone
wanting to start milk production. ''The milk quota system was introduced
dramatically with no regard to its social consequences. The industry has
benefited financially from the quota system but there is no way in for
new entrants.''
His new post he sees as a challenge to get milk producers to
consolidate behind their co-operative marketing structure and become
more aggressive in marketing milk. ''Members have told me they want a
higher profile. That we must try to deliver''.
And in the process John Duncan might have to spend less time on his
hobby of fishing. ''Mind you, fishing is a wet-day hobby and I wouldn't
be out making silage that day.'' No. But he may well be on the end of
his telephone telling milk producers what, if anything, he has achieved
in a dour market.

AMERICAN Lance Armstrong drew strength from tragedy to win the
eighteenth stage of the Tour de France yesterday, dedicating his victory
to tragic team-mate Fabio Casartelli, who died in a race crash four days
ago in the Pyrenees.
Armstrong, the 24-year-old, leader of Italian Casartelli's Motorola
team, had to dig deep into his reserves of stamina to make a solo break
18 miles from the end of the 104-mile stage from Montpon-Menesterol. He
said afterwards: ''I did it for one person. I did it for Fabio
Casartelli.''
The stage made no major changes in the overall standings, with Spain's
Miguel Indurain virtually assured of a fifth successive win when the
Tour finishes in Paris tomorrow. He leads Swiss Alex Zuelle by 2min
46sec.
Amstrong, world champion in 1993, escaped early on in a group of 12,
then went alone late on to finish in 3hr 47min 53sec, 33sec ahead of
Italian Andrea Ferrigato and 44 ahead of Russian Vyacheslav Ekimov.
The race continues with a 29- mile individual time trial at the Lac de
Vassiviere today.
Stage 18 -- 1, L Armstrong (USA) Motorola 3hr 47min 53sec; 2, A
Ferrigato (Italy) Telekom-ZG at 33sec; 3, V Ekimov (Russia) Novell 44;

Ron MacKenna reports on the paper chase that brings a court to a
standstill
IT took a little over half an hour for the wheels of justice to come
spinning off at Glasgow District Court yesterday. Business in No 1, the
custody court, began at 10.30am and a steady flow of life's casualties
was brought from the cells to go before stipendiary magistrate Mr Robin
Christie.
As normal, new custodies -- those arrested on the day or night before
-- entered from a door to the left of the bench. Men already serving a
sentence in prison, or on remand, and all women were brought from a door
to the right.
The accused, mainly young, usually impassive and all on relatively
minor charges, moved swiftly to stand before the magistrate as he
dispensed fines, handed down short prison sentences or set trial dates,
and just as quickly were taken back to the cells.
Then, at 11:05am, the bar officer indicated that there was to be a
recess. There was no shortage of accused persons waiting in the cells
behind to appear or lawyers waiting to represent them. There simply
wasn't any paperwork for them. The supply of complaints documents
outlining the alleged offences and prepared by the fiscal's office more
than half a mile away had dried up.
It took 35 minutes, while the public, lawyers, and court staff cooled
their heels, before proceedings could start again and then they only
continued until another shortage prompted an early break for lunch.
Glasgow District Court, said to be the busiest in Europe, is under the
spotlight because last year 7000 criminal cases, which would normally be
prosecuted, were dropped because there was insufficient capacity to deal
with them in a reasonable time.
The figures, revealed in a House of Commons Public Accounts Committee
Report, showed that among the charges abandoned were 365 assault cases,
1646 breaches of the peace, 985 thefts, and 3592 parking offences. The
lost revenue in fines alone is believed to amount to #250,000.
Yesterday's delays, while clearly unpleasant for the prisoners held
30-to-a-Victorian-cell in the back of the court, were nothing out of the
ordinary said court personnel and not symptomatic of problems which
caused last year's delays.
Glasgow senior depute-fiscal John McMenemy said: ''The custody court
is dealing with people who have been brought in under warrant or people
who have committed offences and been arrested the day or night before.
''That means that from around 9am my office receives new reports from
the police on the new crimes. Thereafter they are considered by fiscals
on how to proceed. They then require to be typed. The district court is
three-quarters of a mile away from our office and the reports have to be
ferried over by van.''
Part of the problem with delays in custody cases, said McMenemy, was
that Glasgow District Court dealt with them in the morning while most
other courts waited until the afternoon, giving the paperwork a chance
to catch up. ''It dates back to the days when the courts were under
Glasgow Corporation. They were police courts and the police brought
people to that building and they could be fed in.''
The depute-fiscal added that cases that had been abandoned were not
custody cases. ''They were cases that were reported from the police with
no person in custody. They tended to be of a minor nature. There was a
lack of court resources and they would have been going into court when
the cases were very old, clogging up the system.''
The revelation of large numbers of deserted cases came as a surprise
to lawyers working in the district courts. Most solicitors The Herald
spoke to said they were not aware of an abnormal number of their cases
being abandoned over a year.
The district court in Glasgow is made up of eight separate courts run
on a two-tier system. Full-time stipendiary magistrates, all solicitors
or advocates, deal with the more serious cases and have the sentencing
powers of a sheriff sitting in a summary matter. They are backed up by
justices of the peace, often local councillors, who sit with a legally
qualified person to guide them on the law.
The Crown Office say that a new structure is now in place at Glasgow
District Court and there had been no cases dropped because of
insufficient capacity during May and June.

EALING'S Kathy Osher extended her British National Swimming
Championship record to 10 victories in the 200 metres back-stroke with a
comfortable win in yesterday's finals in Coventry.
The 26-year-old veteran, who will compete for Britain in the European
Championships in Vienna next month, clocked 2min 17.93sec, almost two
seconds ahead of fellow internationalist Joanne Deakins.
Scotland's Fraser Walker comfortable qualified for the 400m medley,
but then pulled out of the final, preferring to concentrate on today's
200m medley, the event in which he won the bronze medal at last summer's
Commonwealth Games.
Now training with Warrington after a troubled season, the 21-year-old
from Dunfermline was sixth fastest in the longer event in the heats with
a time of 4-39.44.
James Hickman (Stockport Metro) took the gold in the final in 4-30.94,
with James Harris and last year's winner David Warren having to settle
for silver and bronze.
Newcastle's Susan Rolph confirmed her status as the rising star of
British swimming when she held off Karen Pickering to win the 100m
free-style in 57.41sec. Pickering beat Sarah Hardcastle by one tenth of
a second to take the 200m freestyle title.
Mark Foster, who will be one of Britain's main hopes for gold at the
European event, won the 50m metres free-style in 23.74 ahead of Mark
Stevens.

ELLIOTT Bunney, the record six-time Scottish senior 100 metres
champion, will come out of retirement this weekend to help his
crisis-hit country in the international against Wales, Turkey, Israel,
and Northern Ireland in Cardiff.
Ian Mackie is the latest casualty in a team which now contains fewer
than half of its original complement, and which will travel minus any
men's or women's 5000m runner.
Mackie, a world junior bronze medallist last summer, has endured a
nightmare year with illness and injury, a cruel reward after having gone
full-time on a winter of very hard work. He has decided to terminate his
season.
Doug Walker (200m), the only surviving first-choice men's selection in
any flat track event, has first refusal on Mackie's vacated 100m place.
Bunney has agreed to run the 4 x 100m, and Jamie Henderson also comes in
for the relay.
With team captain Geoff Parsons absenting himself to chase a world
qualifying standard, Tony Gilhooly is the high jump choice, and Scottish
runner-up Darren Ritchie comes in for Duncan Mathieson in the long jump.
Kheredine Idessane (800m) replaces Tom McKean, an ironic sequel to
last weekend when Idessane protested to AAA officials, vainly attempting
to have his compatriot disqualified for barging. Other replacements:
Ian Horsburgh (400m), Jim Austin (steeplechase), Grant Graham (1500m),
Lisa Vannet (400m) and Dawn Flockhart (relays).
Mel Neef, whose duties at the BUPA international meeting in Sheffield
tomorrow gave Vannet the opening, is out to claim the scalp of grand
slam 400m hurdles champion Sally Gunnell. The Great Britain team captain
will be having her first race of the year in a bid to claim a flat 400m
and relay place in the UK team for the worlds in Gothenburg, which begin
a fortnight today.
Most of Britain's world squad, including Linford Christie, plus
fitness rebels Roger Black, Steve Backley, and John Regis, will be in
action at Sheffield, as will Scotland's Yvonne Murray (2000m) in her
last race before Gothenburg. The meeting has offered a big-time baptism
to steeplechasers Graeme Croll and Billy Jenkins.

THE Sherry is still flowing along nicely, defying the forecasters, the
odds and the Old Course by shooting another fine score, a one under par
71 for a halfway aggregate of 141, three under par and joint leading
Briish player along with Sam Torrance, Nick Faldo and David Gilford.
Gordon may be 6ft 8in but he has never reached these heights before.
He outscored his partners, a couple of players who have a bit of
experience of these occasions, Greg Norman, and Tom Watson.
He also was introduced to the former Us President, George Bush. Just
another day at the office for the Amateur Champion from Kilmarnock.
However, he confessed that it was the toughest day he has had yet.
''It was very difficult to concentrate with all the waiting we had to do
but I will have to get used to it if it is going to be my life.'' He had
to hang on very bravely when he bogeyed the fourth and fifth holes as
there was a real danger the wheels were about to come off. He did
tremendously well to pick up a birdie at the ninth and get to one under
at that point. Bogeys at the eleventh and twelfth had the alarm bells
ringing again but he responded once more to lift two birdies, at the
fifteenth and last, to finish three shots off the lead at the halfway
stage.
He loved the day out with Norman and Watson, none the less. ''They are
both tremendous to play with. Greg jokes all the way round, encouraging
me all the time. It can't be bad playing with the best player in the
world. Tom calls me pard, after I was his partner in the practice
round.''
Torrance, who would love to partner the young star today (''We'd get
some cheers''), said he had played as well as he can. ''I was very
solid, played only one bad shot, a No 4-iron into the trap off the tee,
and I am sure this is the best position I have been in after two rounds
at an Open.''
Torrance aknowledged Sherry's concern about the slow play but points
out that it is something they all have to get used to.
He is not at all surprised that Sherry is up there close to the
leaders. ''He is a very good player and he is just a boy full of
confidence. It is not bad to beat Tom Watson and Greg Norman in your
first Open.''
Sandy Lyle looks to be getting closer every day to his former glory.
Consistency has been his game this week and yesterday he turned in
another 71 to be two under for the championship. Yet Sandy was a bit
disappointed.
''I played better than the score suggests,'' he said, ''and I drove
the ball well.'' He was annoyed at taking three puts at both the
eleventh and eighteenth, especially at the last where he had driven the
green.
* LEADING qualifier Joe Hughes of Cardross beat Paisley's Robert
Linden 4 and 3, coming back from two down, to book his place in the

THE Scottish team management made no secret of their fears that they
might be humiliated by England in their opening match of the Four
Nations men's hockey tournament at Bisham Abbey yesterday. But in the
aftermath of their 0-3 defeat, they have grounds for optimism.
They were beaten by a superior side, ranked No.6 in the world, but
equally significant they beat Belgium, one of Scotland's group opponents
in the European Nations Cup in Dublin next month, 8-0 last week.
The principal difference in the sides on this occasion was the
slickness of the English team.
But Scotland matched their opponents for a spell before half-time, 10
minutes after the interval and then for a similar period in the final
quarter.
Unfortunately they were unable to capitalise. Jimmy Cox, Richard
Freeland, and Stevie Grubb all managed to find weaknesses in the English
rearguard but they allowed their opponents off the hook.
Grubb was a handful for the English, for he also carved out Scotland's
best scoring chance of the game when he managed to get a touch to a
passback by Julian Halls, but Simon Mason in the English goal made a
brilliant reflex save.
England, who broke the deadlock after 21 minutes from a penalty corner
conversion by Callum Giles, consolidated their advantage in the fiftieth
minute from Kulbir Takher, Robb Thompson adding the gloss with a third
three seconds from time. Results:
Spain 0, Canada 0; England 3, Scotland 0.

SCOTLAND made cricket history last night by becoming the first nation
to complete a British amateur Grand Slam double.
George Salmond's men crushed Wales by six wickets in Belfast to retain
the Triple Crown.
It was a performance which again proved the selectors were right to
gamble on handing the captaincy to the Arbroath batsman.
Salmond beamed: ''The tournament has been a tremendous experience, but
we still have a lot of tightening up to do before next week's European
challenge against Holland and Denmark.
''Morale is high again, and the talent is there to build on.''
Wooden-spoonists Wales tumbled to 148 all out -- but they probably
would not have reached three figures had Jim Govan not spilled three
slip catches.
Strathmore paceman Kevin Thomson was the top bowler with three for 24.
The Scots surged to the clean sweep in just 32 overs -- but they had
to survive a scare at the end.
With their total just four short of victory, Iain Philip, who had
smashed 55, became the first victim of an amazing hat trick by part-time
bowler, Tim Hemp.
Both George Reifer and Salmond spooned their first deliveries straight
to a fielder. But Bruce Patterson (40 n.o.) and Greig Williamson kept
their nerve to complete the job without further alarm.
Earlier, debut boy Bryn Lockie hit a tidy 24 before mistiming a drive
to midwicket. Philip's effort clinched the man-of-the-match award.
Scores:
Wales 148 (G Lewis 39, J Langworth 32; K Thomson 3-24); Scotland 149
for four (I Philip 55, B Patterson 40 n.o.).

EXPERIENCE it, discover how it feels, look at the people and the faces
and you will know what we know. You, too, will fall under the spell.
It all sounded like part of the hype, more pap to perpetuate the myth
that golf is the finest sport man has ever known, that it can be some
kind of mystic, almost religious experience.
Lo and behold, it's all true. The Open Championship, especially when
it is played at the sport's Mecca, St Andrews, does something to people.
It does have a deep and powerful effect.
Golf at the traditional home makes people metamorphose. It alters them
dramatically and profoundly influences minds in ways which no other
sport can. Beware. Championship golf and golf watching changes
everything, especially your clothes.
Favourite loitering spots are along the length of the seventeenth of
the Old Course, a hole which both excites and reduces adults to sobbing
heaps. Newspapers always post sentries at this dastardly, treacherous
strip of green which erodes even the strongest of wills.
Golfers don't just lose their way there, they lose their dreams also.
''The hardest hole in championship golf,'' is how Severiano
Ballesteros describes the par 4, and yesterday he stole a par on his way
to a round reminiscent of the player who won the first of his two Open
titles here in 1984.
The Spaniard went round in 69, which was only one more than he needed
to complete his second round 11 years ago. That year he had opened with
a round of 69, on which his championship-winning performance was built
here, while on Thursday he had to settle for a three-over-par 75.
Affection lingers for Ballesteros, who commands the sympathy of the
masses these days as he struggles with his swing. When he made it to the
seventeenth yesterday the crowd applauded enthusiastically for a great
sportsman, and when he splashed his bunkered ball to within putting
distance they roared their approval, even if many of them couldn't see
what was happening.
Thousands were attracted to St Andrews, and they swarmed all over the
course hoping to catch glimpses of their favourite players, but it is
never easy.
Even if you arrive early enough and stake your claim to a high vantage
point, you are likely to be blinded by the glare of the gaudy and garish
rigouts worn by the players. No colour is too loud, no shirt too
over-stated in a world so obviously free of fashion police.
If the clothes are a turn-off they are in the golf shop windows. Just
take a look at the ridiculous garb worn by Payne Stewart.
Nevertheless, despite the spectators who every year look more like the
golfers than the players themselves, golf watching is no laughing
matter.
It is a serious business and step-ladders have been added to the
essential equipment of brollies and golf shoes although some spectators
make do with old milk crates, but they will get the game a bad name.
Things were bad enough when the fans moved about charting their courses
through cardboard periscopes, but turning the courses into painters' and
decorators' conventions is really too much.
The parts of the ladders which rest on the shoulders should be padded
so as not to saw into skin tissue, a modification which suggests there
may, indeed, be intelligent life here. Golf is everything, but following
Arnie or Nick or Jack is not worth losing a limb.
Yet risk injury these fans will as they clamber to the very top steps
of their ladders where they then teeter precariously while peering
through binocolars. A rogue gust of wind would send all of them toppling
on to the people below in a collision of reds, pinks, greens, blues, and
yellows.
There was nothing remotely bright about the mood of Bill Glasson after
he had negotiated the Road Hole, where his round fell apart. As he hit
his drive he was heading for a six-under-par, two-round total, but an at
the seventeenth left him two under and the American went off to curse
his misfortune.
If anyone was due a little luck it was the 35-year-old from
Stillwater, Oklahoma, who has not enjoyed the best of health and spent
some time moving between golf courses and hospitals.
Apart from knee problems -- which required surgery four times -- and
sinus trouble, Glasson considered filing for permanent disability on the
grounds that his professional golf career was over because of severe
problems at the base of his spine. He decided to give it one more try
and was doing well . . . until the seventeenth yesterday.
Who would be a golfer, and what kind of people enjoy following them?
People who like to run up and down step ladders, that's who. Oh yes, and
seriously bad dressers.

COLIN Jackson's reign as world sprint hurdles champion is over. The
Welsh world record-holder broke down in training yesterday, with a
serious aggravation of the adductor muscle injury which caused him to
pull out of last weekend's AAA championships in Birmingham.
He immediately withdrew from the British team for the world
championships which begin in Gothenburg a fortnight today.
Sally Gunnell already is unable to defend her hurdles crown, and three
other stars who were given a fitness ultimatum by Britain's selectors
will not perform before the deadline expires on Monday.
''European 400 metres champion Du'aine Ladejo, Commonwealth triple
jump record-holder Ashia Hansen, and European 100m hurdles finalist
Jackie Agyepong, each have indicated they are unable to compete,''
revealed British Athletic Federation spokesman Tony Ward.
It was left to Scotland's David Strang and Linford Christie --
Britain's only surviving world champion -- to relieve the gloom last
night at the Bislett Games in Oslo.
Strang, running his first international 800m race in three years,
clocked 1min 46.02sec, almost half-a-second inside the world qualifying
mark and the fastest time by a Briton this year.
''I have been told I must run in Sheffield,'' said the European indoor
1500m champion, who finished second on the Bislett track behind American
Rich Kerah in the B two-lap race. ''They can put in whoever they like at
Sheffield. I know I can beat them. There is easily another second
there.''
Strang finished second in last week's trial behind Curtis Robb who, as
the only UK runner with the qualifying time this season, has already
been selected.
Having promised Jackson he would win for both of them, Christie
clocked 10.12sec, but had to work hard late on to finish
three-hundredths clear of Jamaican Donovan Powell.
Christie's leading US rival, Dennis Mitchell, was fourth (10.19),
while the world's fastest man of the year, Canadian Donovan Bailey,
failed to reach the final, managing just 10.24 in his heat after
watching Christie record the fastest time of the night, 10.08.
Christie needed physiotherapy treatment on a tendon between heat and
final.
With Jackson absent, Tony Jarrett reminded the Americans that Britain
is not a one-man band over barriers, winning in 13.31, with world indoor
silver medallist Courtney Hawkins behind.
Jackson had trained yesterday morning in Cardiff, preparing for
tomorrow's BUPA International in Sheffield where he had agreed to
confirm his fitness.
''While it was always my intention to comply with the selectors'
requirements, and compete within the specific seven-day period, my
recovery has not progressed according to plan,'' he said. ''Mentally, my
preparations for the world championships have been far from perfect,
with both my honesty and credibility questioned by the media and the
BAF.''
BAF officials were saddened by Jackson's decision, but will
undoubtedly see this as vindication of their policy.
On Monday, Jackson will visit the Munich specialist, Dr Hans-Wilhelm
Muller-Wolfhart, and hopes the German can do as much for him as he
apparently did last night for Christie.
Steve Backley's third in the javelin (86.46m) will have convinced the
selectors he is fit, but Geoff Parsons' 2.20m high jump was short of the
world qualifying mark. Steve Smith cleared the same height as Javier
Sotomajor, 2.31m, but he had to settle for second.
Kenya's Moses Kiptanui ran the second fastest steeplechase ever, but
failed by 1.28sec to beat his own world mark. Oslo winners and UK

<HEADLINE>Five-year croft row ends with sister's victory</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>9</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977272953</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A FIVE-year dispute over the ownership of a West Highland croft, which
split a family in a court wrangle, has been settled.
It brought victory for an Inverness woman who has been battling her
elder brother over the right to buy her dead mother's croft, which has
been in the family for more than 150 years.
The Scottish Land Court brought the controversy to an end when it
allowed Mrs Angie Fraser to buy the croftland and the land on which the
crofthouse stands from her brother. She had already bought the house.
The mother had died in 1990 without making a will leaving the croft at
Strath, Gairloch, to any of her eight children.
The brother, Mr William Mackintosh, 49, lived next door to the croft.
He went to court to have himself declared executor and wrote to the then
landlord, Mr John Mackenzie of Gairloch, to inform him he was taking
over the croft.
However, Mrs Fraser, of Midmills Road, Inverness, felt that the value
of the croft should be shared amongst her brother and six sisters. So
she asked Inverness solicitor Derek Flynn to fight her brother through
the courts.
Mrs Fraser and another sister, Mrs Jessie Mackenzie, were also
appointed executors.
Mr Flynn said: ''Mr Mackintosh made it clear that he would block any
move which would mean he would not eventually get tenancy of the croft.
Mr Mackintosh wanted to buy the croft and had it valued at around
#30,000.
''But Mrs Fraser's own valuation showed it was worth around #20,000
more at #50,000. A sheriff then decided the tenancy should be sold on
the open market to resolve the dispute.''
Eventually, Mrs Fraser paid #50,000 to buy the croft tenancy, which
included the crofthouse and the money was divided among the family,
including Mr Mackintosh.
However, Mr Mackintosh was still determined to have a hold over the
croft. He bought the landlord's rights from Mr Mackenzie for #350.
He then became Mrs Fraser's landlord and she found herself paying her
croft rent to her brother. In an effort finally to remove her brother
from any interest in the croft, she applied in court to buy the land
from him.
The court refused to sanction this because Mr Mackintosh would suffer
hardship and her application was refused.
Mr Flynn appealed to the Full Court and this was upheld. The court's
view was that it would have been contrary to the spirit of the Crofters'
Act if an individual were able to purchase the landlord's interest in
order to thwart the right of the tenant.
It ordered Mr Mackintosh to pay the costs of Mrs Fraser's appeal,
which could be several thousands of pounds.
Mrs Fraser said yesterday: ''I began fighting my brother because he
had this old-fashioned attitude that because he was the only male in the
family, he should inherit the croft.''
She said that after her successful bid, estimated at its true market
value, ''the whole family, including my brother, have got their fair
share. Unfortunately, the whole business has meant now that my brother
and I don't talk and it has caused a lot of heartache and unnecessary
expense.
''But I would hope that we could let bygones be bygones now that the
courts have decided. Life is too short to carry on quarrelling. I bear
him no ill feeling.''
Mr Mackintosh was not available for comment.

AUGUST is a selling month -- at least as far as the car trade is
concerned. Around a quarter of all car sales -- expected to reach almost
two million in total this year -- take place in August as proud owners
vie for pole position with their shiny new N registration cars.
Personal borrowing rises too as demand for new cars goes up. But is it
really sensible to splash out on a new car, however much of a thrill you
may get from leading the field? ''The moment you drive a new car away
from the showroom its value will drop by as much as 12%,'' says the
consumer magazine Which? ''And after two years it could be worth just a
third of its brand new price.''
Typically a car will depreciate by 74% in the first six years,
according to Which?, but 44% of that comes in the first two years. So
you can avoid a lot of depreciation by buying a nearly new second-hand
car rather than a brand new one.
Some cars are worse than others at holding their price. Which? says
some popular European cars including the Rover Metro GTi, most Fiat
Tipos and Ford Sierras depreciate quickly. But imported Japanese models,
such as some Hondas and Mitsubishis, are slower to depreciate. So too
are German luxury brands like BMW and Mercedes-Benz.
Whatever you choose to buy Which? stresses that you'll maximise the
eventual trade-in price by making sure it is serviced regularly, keeping
a full service record with receipts and stamps.
If you are hoping to buy a new car in August -- and planning to borrow
some or all of the cost -- now is the time to be doing your homework on
the price of cars, credit and running costs. Draw up a shortlist of
models you're interested in, check what is included as standard and test
drive each one.
''Do not just go into one showroom and accept what is on offer.
Discounts may be available, but it is up to you to haggle and get the
price down as much as you can,'' says the Office of Fair Trading.
''There may be offers included with the car such as insurance . . . you
will need to consider how much these offers are worth to you when you
decide whether you are getting a good deal.''
Lenders are now heavily promoting loans for cars, using slogans such
as ''special offer until the end of August'' or ''lowest rates ever'' to
tempt you. But don't be rushed -- those special offers are not always
all they're cracked up to be. Take time to compare alternative costs and
start by approaching your own bank, building society or even motoring
organisation -- there may be special lower rates for existing customers.
Always check the conditions and any extra costs associated with taking
out your loan. There could be an arrangement fee and compulsory deposit,
for instance, and you may be required to repay via direct debits. Watch
out for penalties if you repay the loan early.
Usually the more you borrow the lower your interest rate. At the Bank
of Scotland, for instance, existing customers qualify for a discount on
normal car loan rates, meaning an APR of 13.3% currently for a #5000
loan taken out over five years. But the rate rises to 16.4% for a #1000
loan over 12 months.
Alliance &amp; Leicester and Direct Line (if you've held a policy for at
least a month) are close behind with rates of 13.4% and 13.9%
respectively. And the rate for a #5000 loan for customers of First
Direct, the telephone banking arm of Midland Bank, is just 12.9%
currently.
The Halifax is unusual in having only one interest rate, regardless of
how much you borrow. Its car loan is 15.9% for #500 to #10,000 and
includes one year's free membership of the Halifax Drivers Club, a
motoring service that provides help at home, roadside recovery and
European cover.
Bank of Scotland is the first Scottish bank to offer a so-called
''personal contract purchase'' (PCP) scheme, known as Freeway, for
buying new cars. PCPs are a form of hire purchase. They have been
offered in the past by manufacturers, but the Bank of Scotland scheme
means you can opt for any make or model of new car.
Potential buyers decide how long they intend to keep the car, usually
two or three years, and estimate how many miles they are likely to drive
each year. The Bank then calculates monthly payments based on the
difference between the manufacturer's list price and the ''option to buy
price'' which reflects the car's value at the end of the agreement.
When the agreement ends buyers can choose to buy the car outright at
an agreed price, return it and start another agreement for another new
one, or simply hand it back and leave it at that.
If you want to be able to buy a brand new car every few years, this
type of scheme is a pretty competitive way of doing it -- but you need
to put down a deposit of at least 10% of the car's purchase at the
outset and there is an administration fee of #40.

<TEXT>
A SALES assistant, who virtually turned her home into a branch of
Marks &amp; Spencer after stealing thousands of items of clothing and other
property, was jailed for two years yesterday.
During a 10-year campaign of ''systematic and ingenious'' dishonesty,
Gina Corfine, 59, had taken so much she could almost have gone into
business herself. When police searched her four-bedroomed house, they
found the place had become an Aladdin's cave of women's wear.
They discovered 2367 items of knitwear, 1310 pairs of knickers, 614
blouses, 243 nightdresses, 314 skirts, 176 dresses, 82 pairs of shoes,
20 belts, and more than 106 items of children's clothing. Knightsbridge
Crown Court heard the haul was worth #44,632 and filled 100 large police
exhibit bags.
Judge Christopher Hordern, QC, told Italian-born Corfine that for 10
years she had ''deliberately and ingeniously'' betrayed her employers at
the chain's Edgware Road branch in central London. He ordered that all
her and her husband's #28,000 savings be seized to compensate her former
employer.
Corfine, of Cricklewood, north London, admitted six sample counts of
stealing goods and till receipts.
Mr Howard Vagg, prosecuting, said Corfine started stealing soon after
being taken on. Her ''systematic'' dishonesty really took off in the
1990s.
She made hundreds of pounds by returning items she had stolen. The
barrister said she kept customers' unwanted till receipts, took matching
items off the shelves, and obtained refunds.
It was this practice that finally sealed her fate when store
officials, who had already become suspicious of her, swooped during one
of the illegal transactions.

BUSINESS Diary does not normally concern itself with heavyweight
stories. I like to keep it light so that readers can perhaps have
something to smile about on a Saturday morning after a hard week at the
office.
However, this is one heavy story I could not ignore. It seems that
ScottishPower's spokesman Gordon Laidlaw has finally embarked on a
long-threatened diet in the wake of an embarrassing incident at Belfast
Airport.
Laidlaw had been visiting the company's windfarms in Northern Ireland
in preparation for next month's formal opening, when it seems he just
made the departure time for a flight back to Glasgow. My informant says
that he was accompanied by a far slimmer and prettier colleague, which
seems to me to be both a sizeist and a sexist description, but I have to
report what I am told.
The ScottishPower pair were given the last available seats on the
flight and were rushed on to the plane as it prepared to leave.
It began to taxi towards the runway before suddenly coming to a halt,
and an embarrassed steward approached Laidlaw, who I am informed is near
the 18-stone mark, and asked if he could move to the back of the plane.
My source tells me: ''It seems that they wanted to give it a fighting
chance of getting aloft.''
The presence of a ScottishPower colleague as a witness to these events
meant that he has had to take some ribbing from his colleagues back at
headquarters, but it appears he has firmly denied that the plane was a
737.
Business Diary does not normally reveal the identity of its
informants, but my advice to Gordon Laidlaw is that he should sit on
some of his colleagues before he diets.
Having a ball with
atomic power
CORRIE-fisted gowfer (Sassenach translation: left-handed golfer) Mark
Whittet, a communications officer at Scottish Nuclear, was delighted to
receive a dozen golf balls from John MacPherson, an exiled Scot who
works with Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd.
Whittet had read about MacPherson and his colleagues at AECL's Chalk
River plant running a sideline in nuclear-powered golf balls during the
recent G7 summit in Halifax, Canada.
It appears that MacPherson, who hails from the Western Isles and
worked for the BBC during the seventies, was distributing complimentary
packs of the irradiated golf balls to the 2000 journos covering the
summit.
Whittet phoned MacPherson, who told him that the nuclear-powered golf
balls had started when a nuclear scientist at Chalk River had decided to
irradiate them to see what difference it made. The scientist claimed
that the process slightly changed the molecular structure, and made them
go much further.
Following the telephone call Whittet received a dozen golf balls
through the post, and he is now threatening to take them to St Andrews
this weekend to present to the leading Scot in the Open Championship,
which would certainly be a new form of Scottish Nuclear sponsorship, but
perhaps that's what we need to ensure a Scottish victory.
New club set up
for golfing firms
A NEW Scottish Golf Trade Association has been formed to help small
companies involved in the golf industry to export.
Thirty-four firms have already joined the initiative which is being
led by Scottish Trade International, and a new brand name, Links of
Scotland, has been created to market the wide variety of goods in the
US.
Duncan Martin of Highland Connection, which produces golf towels at
its factory at Hillington near Glasgow, is chairman of the association,
which will launch Links of Scotland at the PGA show in Las Vegas later
this year.
Karen McMurrich of Scottish Trade International told Business Diary:
''We expect 15 Scottish companies to be represented at Las Vegas, and
many of them are small producers who could not tackle the American
market on their own, but through the new association they will be able
to participate and hopefully gain orders.''
Any company interested in joining should contact her on 0141 228 2635.
More from good
news department
MORE good news on the export front, and once again involving small
Scottish companies. Tokiwa, the leading department store in Oita
pefectura in Kyushu, Japan, is mounting a major in-house promotion of
British, but mainly Scottish, goods during September and October.
Buyers from Tokiwa, which had sales of almost #400m in 1993, visited
the Made in Scotland craft trade fair at the SECC in January and placed
orders worth almost #100,000 with around 30 Scottish companies, and the
goods will be on display during the promotional event. The companies
involved are hoping the exercise will lead to repeat orders.
Banking on a
birthday invite
THE Bank of Scotland celebrated its 300th birthday last Monday, and
Business Diary readers will recall that I broke the news that it
intended to have a little party in each of its 400 branches to mark the
occasion.
The only problem was that it could not guarantee it would have enough
cake and wine to go round all its two million individual customers. To
avoid being disappointed, I had resolved to be standing at the doors of
2 Station Road, Milngavie when they opened to secure my slice.
However, when I realised that it was Glasgow Fair Monday, a local
holiday, I made the assumption that the birthday party in Milngavie
would be postponed.
I also assumed that the manager, Sam Haywood, would give me a personal
invite. Wrong again. When I phoned him later in the week he informed me
that everyone had such a good time the branch remained open until 7pm.
Some 300 customers turned up to join in the celebrations, many of whom
had read about the proposed party in Business Diary.
There were similar scenes at the bank's branches throughout Scotland.
All Business Diary can say is ''belated birthday wishes''. I am glad you
all had a good time. Sulk.
Thanks for coffee
and sympathy
GLENDA Mackenzie, appeals manager of Disability Scotland, had a nasty
experience recently when a tyre on her car blew out while she was
driving on the A8.
She sought help in the Honeywell reception area where Mattie Brown and
Jane Hendry quickly took control, calling the RAC and police. They also
made sure she had an adequate supply of coffee to calm her shattered
nerves. She was so grateful she wrote to Honeywell to express her
thanks, saying: ''The coffee was appreciated and I shall try and
remember to return the holder next time I'm passing.''
The ladies at Honeywell would be delighted to see you Glenda, but you
don't need to have another blow out in order to qualify for a free
coffee. Just drive up quietly and park outside.

THE Government's climb down on the taxation of gilts and the
announcement of other tax concessions covering bond funds means that a
new generation of personal equity plans investing in corporate bonds has
finally been cleared for take off.
These new-style PEPs are designed to attract investors who need a high
income and who may be disillusioned with the diminishing returns which
they have been getting from their building societies in recent years.
Abtrust, Barclays Unicorn, Britannia Building Society, Clerical
Medical, Gartmore, GT, Guinness Flight, Hill Samuel, Henderson Touche
Remnant, Johnson Fry, Legal &amp; General, Mercury, M&amp;G, NatWest, Norwich
Union, Prolific and TSB were the first off the blocks, and on the
evidence of these initial corporate bond PEPs, it looks as if yields
will settle at between 7% and 8.5%.
Investors who know that they can tie up their money for a number of
years should look for companies where the start-up charge is waived in
favour of early redemption penalties.
M&amp;G, which pioneered the concept of no initial charges, has choosen
this route for its corporate bond PEP. The redemption penalty begins at
4.5% in the first year and reduces on a sliding scale to nothing after
five years.
There are no initial charges or annual charges on the Johnson Fry and
Legal &amp; General schemes, and if you can keep your investment going for
at least five years in the case of Johnson Fry and five and a half with
Legal &amp; General, you are guaranteed your money back.
The initial charges on the other funds are 1.5% at Henderson Touche
Remnant, 2% at Guinness Flight, 2.25% at Mercury, 3% at Gartmore, Hill
Samuel, Prolific and TSB until the middle of September; 3.25% at Abtrust
and Barclays Unicorn, 3.5% at Britannia Building Society and Clerical
Medical, 3.95% at Norwich Union, and 4% at NatWest and TSB after the
middle of September.
There is also some variation in the amount you can invest. For
example, Barclays Unicorn, M&amp;G and Hill Samuel have set a minimum of
#1000 if you are investing a lump sum, and #50 if you want to put money
in monthly. Prolific is happy with a lump sum of just #500 or #50 a
month. Johnson Fry and Legal &amp; General accept lump sums only; a minimum
of #3000 with Johnson Fry and #6000 with Legal &amp; General.
The annual charge, and how the fund pays for it, is a much more
contentious issue. The charge itself (0.75% at Barclays Unicorn and
NatWest, 0.8% at Norwich Union, 1% at Britannia Building Society,
Gartmore, GT, Hill Samuel, Prolific and TSB, 1.125% at Guinness Flight,
1.15% at Clerical Medical, 1.25% at Abtrust and Mercury, and 1.34% at
M&amp;G) is only part of the story. You need to know whether it is paid out
of the fund's income or capital or a bit from both.
There is also the issue of how the yield should be presented to
investors. For example, Abtrust, Britannia Building Society and GT's
annual charges are paid for entirely out of capital. Hill Samuel's fee
of 1% is paid 0.65% out of income and 0.35% out of capital. All the
other PEPs are paying the annual charge out of income.
Corporate PEP schemes which pay themselves the annual charge partly
out of capital rather than income are able to show a higher yield.
However, this will be at the expense of capital performance. This could
have a big impact on bond funds where there is only limited scope for
capital growth.
The Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds (AUTIF) is urging
corporate bond PEP managers to quote both a gross yield and a redemption
yield. This last figure is the average redemption yield of the fund's
underlying investments and takes into account the impact of any charges
against capital. For example, Hill Samuel, which is showing both figures
in its promotional literature, is quoting a gross yield of 7.96% and a
lower redemption yield of 7.87% to reflect the 0.35% annual charge which
is taken out of capital.
Victoria Nye of AUTIF says the organisation wants investors to ask
questions about where the income is coming from. ''We want people to
look at the gap between the gross and redemption yields and to
understand what this might mean for the capital value of their
investment, especially if they are being offered a high yield.''
AUTIF has produced a free fact sheet on corporate bond PEPs which is
available from the Unit Trust Information Service, telephone: 0181 207
1361.

THE pace of economic activity did slow down in the second quarter of
this year, but the growth rate was only a touch lower, and if offshore
oil and gas is excluded, there was a small increase.
Yesterday's gross domestic product figures will ensure that the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, sticks to his entrenched
position on base rates, but they remain too strong to justify his
assertion earlier in the week that he was right on rates.
GDP rose by 0.6% in the second quarter after an increase of 0.7% in
the first. Year-on-year growth fell much more sharply from 3.8% to 2.9%,
but this mainly reflects the strong growth in the second quarter of last
year dropping out of the annual comparison. Excluding oil and gas
extraction, growth rose from 0.6% to 0.7%.
The figures are not as weak as other indicators had suggested they
might be, and City expectations that the quarterly rate would decline to
0.5% have not been realised. This is largely because of the strength of
service sector activity which the Central Statistical Office calculates
advanced by 0.8%.
The economy is still growing at above its long-term trend rate of
2.25% per annum, contrary to widespread expectations. The Chancellor,
however, believes that the present rate is sustainable and will not be
deflected from this view by concerns on the part of the Governor of the
Bank of England, Eddie George.
So the disagreement between the two men on the need for a rise in
rates will rumble on over the summer. Thursday's meeting will inevitably
result in Clarke again saying No.
Six days later the Bank of England will publish its quarterly bulletin
and inflation report. There is no reason why it should depart from the
view, expressed in May, that on unchanged rates underlying inflation
will come close to the upper limit of its 1% to 4% target range and that
the Government's aim of restricting it to the lower half by the end of
the current Parliament will not be realised.
Rates are likely to remain on hold over the rest of the summer, and
perhaps the autumn as well, unless there are strong indications that
activity has picked up again in the current quarter. The prospect of a
tax-cutting Budget in November could be the occasion for reappraisal by
the Chancellor, who begins the initial preparations with Treasury
Ministers and senior officials at Chevening this weekend.
Industrial production was broadly flat in the second quarter,
according to the CSO's calculations. The strength of the service sector
suggests that consumer spending is stronger than the 0.4% rise in retail
sales indicates.
One explanation is that the weakness of the housing market is
resulting in strong growth in spending on leisure activities rather than
durable goods, as would be normal at this stage in the economic cycle.
Services have been growing at quarterly rates of between 0.75% and
1.25% over the last six quarters despite the lack-lustre state of retail
sales in the last nine months.
The slowdown in overall activity largely results from the official
figures showing little or no growth in the manufacturing sector. These
conflict with survey evidence from the likes of the CBI and have been
questioned by the Bank of England and private economists.
If the figures on industrial production are defective they are likely
to be revised upwards and with them the GDP figures. History may record
that the economy slowed down very little, if at all.
In any event the Bank of England's main preoccupation has been with
the inflationary implications of the decline in sterling since the start
of the year. That remains a problem. Sterling has lost 5.5% of its
international value so far.

Trust, which aims to open up such centres throughout the UK.
Following her visit to the centre the Princess had a private lunch in
the Western Club where she was greeted by her hosts Donald Turner of
Ernst &amp; Young and David MacLellan of Murray Johnstone, both members of
the trust's fund raising committee.
The lunch was attended by a number of notable members of the business
fraternity including Brian Fitzgerald, chairman and managing director of
John Laing Construction (Scotland and Ireland), Bill Thornton chairman
of Burn Stewart whisky distilleries, Niall Scott, McGrigor Donald, and
Sir Lachlan MacLean of the Robertson Trust.
The Princess Royal explained that the trust hoped to create a centre
in every local authority area in Scotland, and that 20 had already been
opened.

BRITAIN'S non-EU visible trade gap worsened in June to #765m from
May's #634m, revised up from #607m, again wrong-footing market
forecasters who had been looking at #500m to #600m with most opting for
nearer the lower end of the range. It is the largest non-EU deficit
since December.
Excluding oil and erratic items defined as ships, aircraft, precious
stones and silver, the balance was little changed on the month at #657m
but the Central Statistical Office yesterday said that the latest
estimate of trend suggests that the non-EU visible balance is widening.
The second quarter overall deficit of #1900m compares with #800m in
the first quarter and is the highest quarterly deficit since the third
quarter of 1993.
The total value of exports in June rose just 1% on May to #5197m while
imports were 3% ahead at #5962m. In volume terms after stripping out oil
and erratics, exports rose 0.5% compared with May while imports volumes
fell 1%. However, the latest estimates show export volume fairly flat
and import volume rising.
Part of the deterioration in trade reflects a higher deficit in oil
which at #176m is the largest since June 1993.
But the Treasury said the static level of exports also reflected the
slowdown in the US economy. Over the month the value of exports to North
America dipped from #1634m to #1608m while imports rose from #1783m to
#1845m, widening the trade gap to #237m from May's #149m.
Over three months, the value of exports rose by 0.5% over the
preceding three months while the value of imports was up 7.1%.
Excluding oil and erratics the volume of imports rose almost 5% in the
three months period while exports volumes were static so the underlying
trend has clearly worsened so far as non-EU trade is concerned.

SCOTTISH &amp; Newcastle has cleared a major hurdle in its planned #425m
takeover of the Courage brewing subsidiary of Fosters Brewing Group of
Australia.
It seems likely that the merger will escape a reference to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission although a final decision will be
taken after the views of third parties are taken into account.
Scottish &amp; Newcastle's competitors, particularly Bass and Whitbread,
have vehemently opposed S&amp;N's plan. They have argued that Scottish
Courage will have about 30% of the UK beer market although S&amp;N's
maintains that it will have just 25% of own brand production.
Both are believed to be writing soon to the Office of Fair Trading.
A spokesman for Bass said that it has strong views on the matter. It
is concerned that there has been no explanation of the competition
concerns and what it means for future competition policy.
UK Competition and Consumer Affairs Minister Jonathan Evans said S&amp;N's
proposed acquisition raised competition concerns and has asked for views
from third parties.
Jeffrey Preston, Acting Director-General of Fair Trading, had
recommended that the bid be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission because it would have resulted in a significant concentration
in the brewing industry.
However, Mr Preston has said that if Scottish &amp; Newcastle agrees to a
number of conditions, then a MMC inquiry would not be necessary.
The planned deal includes a supply agreement until 1998 to the 4350
pubs owned by Inntrepreneur Estates, which is jointly owned by Courage
and Grand Metropolitan.
The undertakings are:
* A reduction in S&amp;N's tied estate by 115 pubs from 2739 to 2624
within one year of completing the merger;
* setting a limit on S&amp;N's tied estate to 2624, unless circumstances
change dramatically and subject to a review after three years;
* an early end to the beer supply agreement to 1000 IEL pubs by
January 1997. S&amp;N would be allowed to compete for the supply deal under
competitive tendering.
S&amp;N shares firmed 5p to 596p.

For its part, Forte said the sale would help it to reduce borrowings
and allow it to focus its efforts better.

SCOTLAND'S sheep farmers are being given a grim warning that unless
they take control measures now they could be faced with sheep scab
resistant to chemical control.
Within the controversy surrounding the human health hazards caused by
organophosphorus dips, there are moves to turn the clock back four years
and make dipping of sheep compulsory.
Willie Blair, president of the Institute of Auctioneers in Scotland,
said: ''The present increase in the incidence of sheep scab is entirely
due to a small minority of owners failing to take the necessary
preventive precautions.
''As the peak period of lamb sales approaches we urge all consigners
to ensure their stock is dipped or treated prior to sale.
''The aim of everyone involved in the sheep industry must be to
eradicate this cruel and unsightly disease.''
There have been reports that veterinary scientists are concerned that
within three years, possibly less, there will be no chemical left to
control sheep scab.
The OP dips are under criticism because of the hazards to human health
that are involved. However, they have proved to be cheap and effective
not only against scab mites but against ticks, lice and head flies.
Alternatives are more expensive and do not have such wide ranging
effects.
Richard Henton of the Scottish Farmers' Union said: ''We want sheep
scab eradicated. We seem to be in a deteriorating situation since
compulsory dipping was removed, and we could be facing not only a
financial but an animal welfare problem.''
He pointed out that under livestock welfare laws farmers could be
fined up to #5000 per animal.
''There is a growing lobby for a return to compulsory dipping. We are
aware of the concern over OP dips, but we are also aware of the serious
risks to livestock.''
Scotland has 9.4 million sheep and a Scottish Agricultural College
veterinary specialist said: ''There is no worthwhile alternative control
to sheep scab on the horizon. Non-pharmaceutical research is going on
but these are early days.
''At present we are not aware of a problem of resistance.''
Sheep scab is a highly infectious disease which causes animals to stop
feeding, scrape off their fleeces against fence posts, and lose weight.

INDUSTRIAL conglomerate BTR is bidding just over #2000m for the
minority stake in its profitable 63% owned Australian offshoot Nylex.
While a bid for the rest of the Australian firm was certainly not
unexpected in the City, it did raise initial fears that there could be
some earnings dilution though later it was thought it could be earnings
neutral.
Share markets had also been thinking in terms of BTR spreading its
wings with a bid for a more conventional independent company and the
shares fell 9p to 332p. BTR Nylex's London quote, though, soared 33p to
162p.
BTR is offering A$180 in cash and 27 new BTR 'A' shares for every 100
Nylex ordinary shares. A full cash alternative of A$3.60 (165p) a share
is being made available. The Scheme of Arrangement will also include
appropriate arrangements in relation to Nylex Convertible Notes and
Nylex options.
Alan Jackson, chief executive of BTR, said, ''the proposal permits BTR
to develop its global strategy in an optimal manner with a single
financial, legal and management structure.
This will eliminate possible geographic or product barriers to the
expansion of both businesses and will significantly enhance BTR's and
Nylex's potential for growth on a global basis, particularly in the
rapidly expanding economies of the Pacific Rim and South East Asia. In
addition, Nylex shareholders will benefit from the opportunity to
participate in the global growth of the enlarged group.''
The new BTR 'A' shares will have the rights as existing BTR shares
except that they will, for the next three financial years, entitle their
holders to enhanced dividends.
BTR says that consolidation is now occurring in many of the industries
in which the company and Nylex operate, as the demands of the market
place require substantial investment in technology and the ability to
service customer requirements on a global basis.   In 1994 Nylex
reported profits before tax of A$852.1m (#383m), up from A$682.3m in
1993. The interim results for both BTR and Nylex, for the six months to
June 30, 1995, are expected to be announced in September.

US securities house Merrill Lynch, ''the thundering herd'', yesterday
clinched the purchase of City broker Smith New Court with a #526.3m cash
offer, worth 560p per share and 270.5p for each convertible share.
Earlier in the day, the German Commerzbank Bank had withdrawn its
proposal to buy Smith following a disagreement with SNC chairman Michael
Marks and members of the board.
Commerzbank said it withdrew because ''a substantial proportion of the
Smith board wanted to do a deal with Merrill not with Commerzbank.''
This is how it has transpired. And with Rothschild chairman Sir Evelyn
de Rothschild accepting the bid irrevocably in respect of Rothschild's
near 26% stake in Smith a deal appears certain.
A statement from Rothchild said: ''The Rothchild Group will in due
course be accepting this offer on the terms indicated by Merrill
Lynch.''
Mr Marks will be joining be the Merrill Lynch executive management
committee in New York as deputy chairman of Merrill's international
activities and will be co-head of global equities.
Other members of Smith New Court's senior management will have
''significant roles and expanded responsibilities within the enlarged
group.'' Key staff at Smith New Court will continue to have performance
related incentives.

EDINBURGH Java suffered a setback during the first half of this year
because the Indonesian companies which it invests in proved slower than
most to recover from a crash caused by the Mexican peso crisis.
Net asset value of the #11.8m trust, which invests solely in
Indonesia, fell 7.5% during the six months to June 30. This compared
with a 2.1% advance in its benchmark Jardine Fleming Nusantara Index.
Edinburgh Fund Managers said their trust had suffered from a bais
towards smaller companies. These had been slower to recover from the
impact of the Mexican crisis in December than the handful of large
companies which dominate the index.
Nevertheless, Edinburgh Fund Managers said the Indonesian economy was
continuing to expand rapidly and there were signs of investors returning
to a wider range of stocks.
''A wave of buyers emerged in May and June which enabled the market to
rebound above the level at which it had started the year,'' the trust
managers said.
The quarter point cut in US interest rates in early July had provided
further impetus for the Indonesian market to move forward.
The Edinburgh Java Trust, which aims for long-term capital growth,
showed earnings per share of 0.10p after a loss of 0.29p in the first
half of last year, but no interim dividend will be paid.
The turnaround in earnings was produced by strong growth in investment
income.

BRITANNIA, one of the UK's top 10 building societies, has launched a
''revolutionary'' new mortgage which enables borrowers to cut the size
of their debt by 10% after five years, writes CHRISTOPHER SIMS.
The Five-Year Bonus Mortgage has been introduced as a result of
consumer research and, says Britannia, takes a radical new approach to
offering borrowers the best value over the long term. After five years,
the society credits 10% of the initial value of the mortgage to the
borrower's account. So a borrower with, say, a #50,000 mortgage receives
a #5000 bonus credit.
Other key features are that borrowers can use the bonus to reduce
their monthly payments or to pay their mortgage off early. They can take
out a loan at Britannia's standard variable rate (currently 8.44%)
subject to a minimum of 7.75% in the first five years, and the mortgage
is fully portable.

<TEXT>
BRITISH Rail yesterday invited the train drivers' union for
eleventh-hour talks in a bid to head off a third 24-hour strike over
pay.
Personnel director Paul Watkinson asked Aslef officials to fresh talks
at BR's London headquarters on Monday to try to reach a breakthrough to
the dispute which has already cost the industry up to #20m in lost
fares.
However, Mr Watkinson insisted the 3% pay offer rejected by the train
drivers would not be increased.
Mr Watkinson said: ''I want to make a final attempt to resolve this
dispute by discussion across the table.
''I hope that we will find a way for Aslef to call off its further
planned strikes, so that we can get on with repairing the damage done by
two days of strikes this year on top of the 23 days affected by the
dispute last year between Railtrack and signal workers.''
BR has stressed since the start of the dispute that its 3% offer was
final but there could be negotiations on bonus and productivity payments
to try to avert four more threatened rail strikes.
The next planned walkout on BR next Thursday will coincide with a
strike on London Underground, which will cause travel chaos in the
capital.
Aslef drivers on the Tube and members of the Rail, Maritime, and
Transport Union have rejected a 2.75% offer and are planning a series of
one-day strikes, some to coincide with the BR stoppages.
0 Aslef accepted the talks invitation. General secretary Lew Adams
said: ''We have always stressed that our door is open for resumed
negotiations. We welcome an opportunity to resolve this issue.''

Emerging markets such as Thailand, where steady economic growth
appears assured, are attracting investors once more, says Ken Clay
EMERGING markets have been coming back into favour for a while now,
but they are mainly still below the peaks hit in the last flush of
enthusiasm. Even Mexico, whose problems got the blame for the last
shake-out in the emerging markets, has seen strong rises in share prices
this month as the government's economic austerity programme has brought
a return of investor confidence.
Emerging market gurus seem, however, to be more keen on Far Eastern
markets than those of Latin America, with eastern European markets
lagging behind in the popularity stakes despite some impressive
performances.
Thailand, land of smiles and gold-topped temples, is one of the Asian
countries confident of continued growth and benefitting from the
expansion in trade among its neighbours in addition to its more
traditional exports to the developed world. Thai exports to ASEAM
countries in the first five months of this year rose by 30%, but the
country is disappointed that its exports to Europe increased by only
13%. Overall exports are predicted to be up by 20% in the first half of
this year.
For the economy as a whole a recent report forecast annual growth of
7% to 8% for the next five years. And one projection suggests that by
the year 2000 Thailand could be the biggest automobile producer in
South-east Asia, turning out a million cars a year. This would be
largely assembly business on behalf of Japanese and US motor giants, but
the figure compares with 464,500 produced last year.
Bangkok, visitors to its legendary traffic jams will not be surprised
to learn, is currently estimated to have some two million cars and
motorcycles on the road with another 1300 being added each day. The
capital is trying to do something about the problem and is currently
building a monorail from the airport and installing computer-controlled
traffic lights at up to 350 or more road intersections.
The metropolitan administration, which also wants better bus services,
is urging the new government to give priority to solving the traffic
problem as an important step in improving Bangkok's potential to become
a leading South-east Asian economic and business centre rivalling such
places as Singapore.
The Thai share market demonstrated its volatility after the recent
general election, dropping by just over 1% as it pondered the prospects
of the new coalition and then increasing by more than 3% on the next two
days.
The market has already had a good rise this year and the potential for
a further advance in the short term is probably limited. The Bangkok SET
index has come up from a 1995 low of 1135.69 in March to 1472.09 this
month and then eased back a little, although some locals were hoping to
see it hit 1500.
Thailand does, however, seem to deserve a place in an emerging markets
portfolio on its longer term prospects. Trusts specialising in emerging
markets as a whole have recently been showing a maximum of up to 12% of
their funds in Thailand, and specialist Far Eastern trusts have
proportions varying from 3% to 19%. Few specialise in Thailand alone.
One, Siam Select, is standing at around its year's peak of 148p, up from
119p, but is at a discount of some 20% to its underlying assets.
Buying shares at a discount by going into a market through an
investment trust has an appealing sound, although the investor has to
remember that the discount is no automatic protection against a falling
market. If the underlying shares fall the trust's share price is likely
to fall also -- and the discount could even get larger. Conversely, if
the market rises and confidence grows, a rising share price for the
trust could be accompanied by a narrowing of the discount. You can get
the double whammy either way.
Looking at another area altogether, broker Smith New Court clearly
feels that the Old Mutual South Africa Trust, the only UK investment
trust specialising in South Africa, is currently cheap at around 100p a
share. This price puts the trust, which is a corporate client of the
broker, at a discount of some 15%. That, it says, is ''paradoxical in
the light of the strong inflows of foreign capital into South Africa in
1995''.
You have to make up your own mind about the risks involved in South
Africa, which is clearly a rich country with a lot of potential. The
broker sees the market as ''interesting, attractive and increasingly
important''. It forecasts economic growth for the country of 3.5% and 4%
for the next two calendar years, and suggests that industrial earnings
could grow at an annual rate of around 25% for the next 18 months.
The trust is managed by Old Mutual Asset Managers, which is part of
South Africa's largest life assurance firm. Capitalised at just over
#50m, it was launched in July last year and has improved its asset
backing since it got fully invested.
Although South Africa is probably best known for its mining shares,
the trust concentrates on the industrial and commercial sectors. Within
these it has an overweight position in medium to smaller companies.
The UK broker points out that the manager has the freedom to invest in
mining shares but says it is unlikely to do this to any great extent.
Currently only around 7% of the fund is in mining companies and the
shares it does have in this sector are in companies which combine
manufacturing with mining. One reason for this low exposure is that it
''does not believe that this is the right time in the commodity/economic
cycle to invest heavily in mining stocks''.
Aside from that, the argument is that concentrating on non-mining
stocks gives a better link to the general prosperity of South Africa and
its neighbours, while the fortunes of mining shares are more linked to
commodity prices which are set globally.

The look that still means business: Ann Donald talks about dress codes
in the workplace to three career women who have developed individual and
successful images
ACCORDING to the old saying, ''clothes maketh the man''. Well, a
contemporary adjunct might read ''clothes can maketh and breaketh the
woman'' when applied to the potential minefield of dress codes in the
workplace.
Since women entered the rat race en masse and the promotional glass
ceilings began to shatter, then deeply embedded social views about the
way women should and could dress were also challenged.
The career woman was expected to steer a steady and conservative
course through this man-made quagmire in trying to balance the act of
looking presentable and professional yet not looking too attractive lest
she be accused of exploiting her femininity and appearance.
At the same time, if she was deemed as looking too professional then
of course predictable slights were ventured about appearing too
masculine. Either way it was a no-win situation.
This latter allegation reached its peak in the 80s when the marketing
ploy of ''power dressing'' took centre stage in the politics of working
dress. Though coined in America, the term became common parlance in
Britain and was intended to appeal to the rising young female executive
who was breaking new promotional ground.
As Barbara Littlewood, a lecturer in sociology at Glasgow University,
explains, power dressing was designed to play upon certain women's
insecurities. ''When women feel themselves to be trespassers in a man's
world then they become self-conscious about their dress,'' she says.
''Power dressing was a marketing strategy to sell clothes to women who
were unsure about what to wear once they got a promotion and so
designers tried to exploit this insecurity.''
Though the shoulder pads have now been consigned to the back of the
wardrobe, there is still a lingering germ of doubt in Littlewood's mind.
''I think that a lot of women in the 90s would insist that they dress to
please themselves and are happy without making a statement,'' she
observes. ''On another level it is very odd that individual taste ends
up with such a degree of uniformity,'' she says, referring to the legion
of career women who still wear the standard suit, blouse, and high
heels.
''Sociologists, at least, suspect that something else is going on
about how dress is evolving in the workplace -- unspoken dress codes
about appropriateness do emerge.''
The three women featured here are all clearly aware of these
''unspoken dress codes'' ie submerged and outright sexism, that exist in
the workplace having filtered down from society as a whole. However,
each has developed a successful work image where they obviously project
themselves as serious and competent professionals while not attempting
to mask the fact that they are women. Funnily enough, in the very same
way as their male counterparts.
TRACEY GINN, 30
* A PARTNER in a Glasgow law firm whose work involves commuting
between their London office, Ginn advises businessmen and directors of
companies. Though her usual attire is a smart trouser suit or the odd
above-the-knee skirt or sun dress when there are no outside clients to
meet, Ginn admits that this fashionably smart and relaxed style is
highly unusual in the legal profession.
She attributes this to her clothes-conscious boss whose laid-back
attitude means that ''he doesn't expect me to go in wearing a frilly
blouse and naff tailored suit''. She also believes that working on a
regular basis in the less stringent rather more cosmopolitan environs of
London, has rubbed off in her choice of wardrobe.
As she points out, this is highly irregular in a traditionally
conservative profession where an unwritten law decrees that women do not
wear trousers. ''When I was working at court about five years ago,'' she
explains, ''there was no way a woman could wear trousers. Though some of
my friends now wear them in court it's still very much frowned upon and
in a lot of law firms women are not allowed to wear them at all.''
Ginn also confirms sociologist Barbara Littlewood's belief that
confidence and dress go hand in hand. ''I think when you first start out
you're less confident about your own ability so you worry about dress
more,'' she says. Nowadays Ginn aims to project an intelligent and
capable image with only one major no-no concerning dress. ''I'd never
wear anything that is too flimsy because the client might dismiss you as
a bit silly and frivolous.''
ALISON McBRIDE, 29
* A FREELANCE publishing and marketing consultant, McBride lectures
part-time in book marketing at Napier University. The nature of her job
demands an in-built flexibility regarding clothes since, on any given
day, she is required to dress appropriately for events as diverse as a
book launch on a Grimsby trawler to lecturing students to escorting
authors to TV chat shows.
''I am very conscious of what I'm wearing depending on who I'm dealing
with,'' she says. ''I'd say my basic image was smart but casual. I
generally keep to basic blacks and whites, trouser suits, long skirts
and plain jumpers that I can adapt by dressing up or down depending on
what I'm doing.''
Having worked in marketing for almost 10 years, McBride is well aware
of the potential pitfalls in projecting an image that could be
misconstrued. Citing one example when she was a sales representative for
a publishing house, she recalls: ''I used to wear short skirts because
it was fashionable but then I got a few comments from buyers saying 'Oh,
if you start wearing shorter skirts then you'll sell more.'
''I stopped wearing them right after that because there is no way that
I want to be seen as pushing any muted sexual side -- and that's
something that anyone in marketing and the press has to be wary of,''
she warns.
McBride has sought the clothing middleground between the casual and
comfortable and the extreme power look. ''I've never gone in for that,''
she says. ''First, suits and heels can be intimidating and I'd hate
anyone to feel that about me, especially in this business. Secondly, the
short skirts and heels would detract from what I'm saying. And what I've
got to say is far more important that what I'm wearing.''
RITA RUSK, 47
* A SUCCESSFUL Glasgow-based businesswoman, Rusk has been working in
the hair and beauty world for the past 21 years. Given that image is
such an integral part of her day-to-day lifestyle, whether she is
dealing with clients in the salon or giving seminars, the personal image
she aims to project is ''professional''.
For Rusk this means presenting a tailored look that seeks to strike
the balance between style and gravity. ''Today, because I'm working in
the salon I'm wearing trousers, a white vest and a tailored designer
jacket because it shows I'm serious about my work without being in any
way fuddyduddy. But if I'm teaching then I'll wear something a bit more
avant-garde because you're trying to reflect what it's like being at the
forefront of what's happening.''
As a woman very much at ease with her own image and who states that
she has never experienced any sexist remarks regarding her appearance --
''they wouldn't dare'' -- Rusk is at pains to decipher the rather
contradictory concept, as she sees it, of power dressing. ''What is that
all about?'' she asks pointedly. ''When you see a woman supposedly in
power dressing it's usually a short skirt, a low top and a
double-breasted jacket. To me that's not power, but sexy dressing. Is
that the image that women want to project going into a business meeting,
wearing a skirt that she has to keep pulling down?''

BRIDGEWATER Paper has bought Glasgow-based waste paper company
Stirling Fibre to help feed its paper mill at Ellesmere Port near
Liverpool. Stirling Fibre employs 24 people and collects about 140,000
tonnes of waste paper per year.
James Moffat, managing director of Bridgewater's newsprint division,
declined to say how much the deal was worth. But he said the price of
clean waste paper suitable for recycling had ''more than trebled over
the past year'' to over #100 per tonne.
Manufacturers of paper and cardboard packaging were therefore
scrambling to secure supplies.
Bridgwater produces 275,000 tonnes of newsprint and business papers at
its Ellesmere plant each year. The plant is currently being modified to
allow it to use recycled paper for 95% of its feedstock.

ST ANDREW Trust is running down its Japanese portfolio to invest more
in other Asian markets, where it expects strong growth.
But the #113m trust lagged behind its benchmark index during the six
months to June 30 because its UK investments are concentrated in smaller
companies which have been slow to rally on the stock market.
Net asset value increased 5.3% to 329.24p per share, trailing the FTSE
All-share Index, which rose 6.7%.
However, earnings per share increased 16.7% to 4.27p as a result of
exceptionally strong yields from investments in Taiwan.
The trust, which is managed by Martin Currie Investment Management of
Edinburgh, declared an interim dividend of 2.95p, up from 2.80p
previously.
The trust has invested 72% of its portfolio in the UK, where it aims
to achieve income growth. The remaining funds are placed in overseas
markets, where capital growth is the main objective.
Fund manager Joanna Terrett said the trust plans to reduce the 5% of
its portfolio placed in Japan, where the economic outlook is
increasingly unfavourable.
But it aims to build up investments in emerging markets ranging from
South Korea and Hong Kong to India and Indonesia, which currently
account for 6% of the portfolio, she added.
The recent cut in US interest rates had boosted these sensitive
markets, where average GDP growth was running at 6% to 7% a year, she
noted.
St Andrew Trust is 58.6% owned by the Ecclesiastical Insurance Group.

HOW sad it was to read Martin Sime's article on the National Lottery
(July 17). Not that it is any surprise -- without crystal balls, those
involved in the voluntary sector knew well what was likely to happen.
Meetings were held at all levels and much campaigning was undertaken to
try to avoid the pitfalls highlighted in the article, to no avail it
would seem.
Even before the Lottery, it was becoming increasingly difficult for
charities as they vied with new forms of fund-raisers, hospital trusts,
hospices, schools, sports organisations, etc, and ever-increasing
appeals for one-off emotional causes.
A new band entered the arena as village halls and churches had to
upgrade their toilet and kitchen facilities in line with the new hygiene
regulations or abandon their traditional earners of coffee mornings,
afternoon teas, etc. Whatever, they still had to raise the money for the
improvements, adding to the groundswell of need from limited resources.
Increasingly bureaucracy and ever changing legislation has placed a
heavy burden on the advice, support, and counselling agencies, many of
whom rely totally on their voluntary status to be free and effective to
challenge authority when necessary.
Training and overhead costs for such small operations have no place
and no appeal when competing with large honeypots. Projects have to be
imaginative, innovative, and a whole dictionary of the most
recent-in-jargon.
Nor do they have appeal for flag days. They rely on the occasional
small raffle, prizes, a box of biscuits, and a perm from the local
hairdresser. Try selling tickets for that in competition with several
millions pounds.
As for Mrs Bottomley's ''harmless flutter'', I know of one woman who
now finds her job in a small shop almost impossible as she witnesses the
amount of money really poor people are spending on tickets and scratch
cards. She carries their disappointment and pain home with her and can
hardly face the next day.
Am I being cynical to suspect that there is another dimension to all
of this? All over the country on a Saturday evening, people gather round
their TV sets sure that tonight it will be their turn. They will be able
to pay the next set of bills, have that hip replacement done privately,
have their teeth attended to, not worry about unemployment or short-term
contracts or paying the mortgage or negative equity, or turning up the
gas, unless of course it is another week of failure.
Trapped in this cycle of expectation, hype, and disappointment, they
are diverted from the real issue -- that they should not have to rely on
winning anything to be entitled to the basic necessities of life, and
some form of security.
The Lottery has become the 1990s opiate of the masses.

AT the Scottish Arts Council we are used to our activities being
overshadowed in the UK press by reports of policy decisions being taken
by the Arts Council of England. After all, what can you expect from a
London-based media? However, it is alarming when that same approach is
taken by our own press here in Scotland.
The decision to award #55m to the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden,
was taken by the Arts Council of England and the funds will come from
Lottery proceeds allocated to the arts in England. It should be seen and
understood in that context.
Scotland's share of the Lottery proceeds for the arts (based on a per
capita formula) is the responsibility of the Scottish Arts Council. So
far, we have announced grants to arts centres in Plockton, Tobermory,
and Arran -- all community-based initiatives; support for Video in
Pilton and Kingussie High School -- both for new equipment; and funds
for public art projects at Prestwick Airport and in Edinburgh.
We are receiving applications, large and small, from a wide range of
arts organisations, voluntary groups, and public and private bodies
interested in developing the infrastructure for the arts in Scotland.
We hope that as further announcements are made over the next few
months the Scottish press will take the opportunity to examine how the
proceeds from the Lottery are being used to enhance the lives of those
who live in Scotland.

* There is a great deal about various forms of investment, saving and
pensions in your letters column but seldom anything a little more
exciting. What, for instance, would you say to me if I was pondering
investing in a theatrical production? Could this be worthwhile?
* It could be but it is extremely unlikely. Being an ''angel'', as
investors in the theatre are called, might be fun but it is also a quick
way of losing money. Statistically, it is probable that money will be
lost without tax relief. In recent years, theatreland has been riddled
with expensive flops. Most of the long running successes are probably
still running and successful newcomers are hard to find.
Those who put up money for a theatrical production normally split the
profits with the management, the former usually taking 60% and the
latter 40%. Before the profits are divided between them, whatever fees
and expenses of management as are specified in the agreement must be
deducted.
Any potential investor should become familiar with the track records
of various producers. There is no central exchange through which
investments can be made, although assistance may be obtained via the
Society of West End Theatre. The society will give advice and maintains
a list of prospective backers. It is a real gamble, though, against
heavy odds.

* Under the old Stock Exchange settlement system shares went
ex-dividend on Mondays, or Tuesdays if there was a bank holiday. Under
the new system will this continue or will companies be able to decide
whatever day they like to make their shares ex-dividend?
* The move to five-day settlement will not affect this. The Stock
Exchange will continue to decide the dates when shares go ex-dividend
and this will continue to be on Mondays or on occasion Tuesdays as you
say. It was thought that lack of fore-warning would enable a
''disorderly'' market to develop which is something the Exchange wants
to avoid at all costs.
* In June 1993 I invested on professional recommendation in a flexible
income plan with Sun Life Assurance. The total investment of #15,000 was
split into #4999 going into a capital life annuity and the balance into
the Sun Life Distribution Bond. The net monthly annuity payment assuming
25% tax is #90.88 and the net income is 7.27% as a proportion of the
total investment. The value of units as at May 31 1996 has been advised
at #11,016. I would appreciate your opinion on this performance so far.
* The Sun Life fund has a sound track record and its performance is in
line with its sector average over the past two years, a period which has
not been easy for investment managers. There is no reason why this
should not continue.
* My husband and I have changed from an endowment to a repayment
mortgage and are left with an outstanding balance of #37,000. We are
still paying up a low-cost endowment with Sun Alliance, the sum assured
being #40,500 and the monthly premium #51. The endowment is over 25
years and the policy has been running for seven-and-a-half years. Would
it be more cost effective to sell the policy to the insurance company or
on the second-hand market and replace it with a term life insurance for
the balance of the mortgage?
* Term assurance will certainly be cheaper than the premiums on the
endowment policy but the saving may not be as much as you might think,
depending on your ages. You will have to obtain a quote -- Scottish
Widows offers some of the best value policies -- and compare the
difference. There are special term policies for mortgages whereby the
sum assured gradually reduces, mimicking the decline in the capital sum
outstanding on the repayment mortgage.
If you can possibly afford to keep the endowment going you will be
very thankful you did when it matures, even if this does seem far in the
distance. If you are not sure of your future circumstances it would
still be worth maintaining the policy for as long as you can before
encashing it, because you will get a better deal with each year that
passes. The slight risk in doing this is that you develop a health
problem which pushes up the cost of term assurance when you do switch
policies.
If you want to ditch the endowment policy, at its present age you
would just be able to sell it on the second-hand market so it is worth
getting a quote and comparing it with the surrender value. However, it
may still be worth less than you've paid into it.
* I am a female part-time teacher aged 41 earning #14,000 gross. My
husband and I own our own home outright and also own and rent out a
property which nets approximately #2200 per annum. I pay superannuation
and have a Scottish Provident free-standing AVC (started 1992). At
present we have sufficient income for all our needs. Largely as a result
of inheritance, I have a portfolio of shares (list enclosed). I would
welcome your comments on the spread of my investments and also your
suggestions for investing a further #50,000 with a view to capital
growth rather than income.
* Your portfolio is substantial with more than 30 holdings. We
recently valued it at in excess of #170,000. The main constituents are
#3125 in Royal Bank, #6824 in RMC, #4953 in BTR, #18,100 in Hanson,
#3924 in Lonrho, #13,460 in Hydro-Electric, #5528 in Southern Electric,
#5232 in GEC, #3002 in Enterprise Oil, #2018 in Premier Oil, #2351 in
BP, #17,284 in Shell, #7844 in Boots, #6794 in Great Universal, #11,922
in Marks and Spencer, #4607 in Allied Domecq, #21,167 in BT, #7758 in
Cable and Wireless, #10,054 in BAT, #2153 in BAA and #5880 in Tibett and
Britten.
Your portfolio is quite broadly spread, though there are a number of
sectors, such as oil, where you hold a range of stocks. You are heavily
overweight in electricity, oil, telecommunications, and probably also in
non-food retailers. Your individual shareholdings are very uneven in
value. This would be even more evident had we not excluded (for reasons
of space) some of your smaller holdings, including ICI and Argyll.
Around half of your portfolio's value is accounted for by the six
largest holdings -- Hanson, Hydro-Electric, Shell, Marks and Spencer, BT
and BAT. With the exception of Marks, all of these have above average
yields. The most worrying feature is the hefty representation of
privatisation stocks where prospects are dimmed by the growing statutory
regulation. These are income, rather than capital growth, stocks.
Despite the substantial number of individual shareholdings there are
some omissions, most notably pharmaceuticals and food retailers (except
of course your modest stake in Argyll). You should have some exposure to
overseas markets and this would probably be best achieved by building up
some holdings in internationally diversified investment trusts with the
emphasis on capital growth. It is surprising that you have no
investments of this type, or the obvious substitute of unit trusts.
Given the amount of capital you have it is also surprising that you
have no funds tied up in personal equity plans. Many of the companies in
which you hold shares have corporate PEPs and you should take advantage
of these facilities. You (and your husband) are entitled to invest #6000
in a general PEP and #3000 in a single company PEP each fiscal year.
Existing shares have to be sold and bought back again under the PEP
rules.
Investing the extra #50,000 should help to give your portfolio a
better balance, but it is unlikely to be enough on its own. One
constraint may well be your potential liability to capital gains tax on
profits you have made on your investments. You (and your husband) have
annual exemption limits of #6000 for capital gains tax purposes, plus
indexation for inflation.
We think you should be consulting a good stockbroker about your
existing portfolio and the investment of the additional funds. If you do
not have a recommendation, a list can be obtained from the Stock
Exchange in Glasgow.
* The income I receive from state and company pensions is paid to me
without deduction of income tax as the age allowances due are in excess
of the total. I have three building society accounts, two of which are
registered as gross accounts to take up the balance of allowances due to
me, and tax is deducted at the basic rate from the interest on the third
account. My tax liability on this interest should, however, only be at
the 20% rate and I have to make a reclaim from the Inspector of Taxes.
Is it possible in these circumstances to instruct the building society
to deduct the correct amount of tax?
* All income which is paid under deduction of tax will continue to
suffer tax at the basic rate despite the introduction of a reduced rate.
This includes interest received from banks and building societies and
also, for example, payments made under deed of covenant. Recipients of
such income who are liable to tax at the 20% rate must obtain a refund
from the Revenue of the excess.
In your own case, the details provided show that your total annual
income exceeds your tax allowances and, therefore, you should not have
registered with the building society as a non-taxpayer even though just
part of the interest received may be liable to tax. You can only arrange
for interest to be paid without deduction of tax if you are completely
not liable. That is, if your total taxable income is less than your
total tax allowance.

FIGURES released by the Association of Investment Trust Companies show
that regular savings into investment trusts in the first half of 1995
have risen since the same period last year, writes NICOLA REEVES.
This is in contrast to the sharp falls seen in new savings levels in
other forms of collective investment.
Total new regular savings rose from #37.6m in the first half of 1994
to #41.09m. The average monthly sum put into regular savings dipped
slightly to #83 against a record #89 in the first quarter.
Commenting on the increased savings levels, Ernest Fenton, director
general of the AITC, says that long-term investors ''recognise the
importance of maintaining their contributions to make long-term capital
growth''.
In comparison, lump sum investments have fallen back. Total lump sum
investment for the first half of 1995 was #40.3m, against #81.68m for
the first half of 1994.
Despite intense competition from corporate bond PEPs, the PEP
investment trust market is said to be performing well. Mr Fenton says he
expects investment trust PEPs to out-perform and to continue to provide
strong equity growth in the future.

ANN MILNES ROBERTS figures there must be an easy way to remember those
little digits which can make the difference between penury or plenty at
the cash dispenser
THE brochure says I can rely on PhoneBank 24 hours a day, 365 days a
year. But what's the use of this wonder aid if I can't remember the
password? And how can I get my money from the cash machine if I can't
remember my secret PIN number?
Life's getting more and more complicated, and it's bound to get worse.
Before Easter, my bank asked me to choose a special word known only to
me so I could check my account at any time. Off I go on holiday --
spending cash of course. Back home to post-holiday financial blues. Need
to check my balance. Time for the password rigmarole.
I've chosen one of my children's names -- I think. I offer certain
letters, sure of failure. And failure's what I get. I'm simply no good
at this kind of thing. I offer N for Nobody and L for Love. The girl
says: ''How sad.'' I'm a real hotshot foreign correspondent, just back
from a trip in a Hercules military transport plane. My sons were
impressed. But can I remember a password which I myself invented? Can I
recall a PIN number without reference to some written aid? I cannot.
In America I had 14 different credit cards, cash cards, ID cards and
store cards. Here I use various cash cards and have an awful job
remembering the numbers for the different cash dispensers. Recently I
forgot my cashpoint number and had a couple of tries, only to see my
card disappear into the system. True, the machine itself routinely
behaves like a tired beast, but the minute we humans weaken: wham! cards
whisked away, access denied.
The chips remain firmly stacked on the side of the behemoth. Surely
I'm not the only one with information overload. Just think -- there are
Frequent Flyer numbers, mobile phone security numbers, BT personal PIN
Numbers, car radio access numbers. For an innumerate it is all too much.
Some people in large offices have to learn an access code to get into
their building, then three separate passwords to get into their computer
system -- and these passwords can change every month. There are even
offices where further codewords have to be memorised in order to move
from one part of the building to another, and yet more codes if you stay
on at work after 5.30pm!
Then there's the telephone system -- sorry, systems. I've just phoned
the US. We use a separate long-distance carrier for various overseas
calls, so first I must dial 11 digits then wait to enter my PIN -- nine
more digits -- then one, plus 10 more digits. So that's 31 digits to
call Washington!
Even to call London using BT I must ring 11 digits. I phone my
mother-in-law in London at least once a week, but I still think PARk
instead of 727 even though it's more than 20 years since London stopped
using ABBey, KNIghtsbridge and WEStern, replacing evocative names with
boring, forgettable numbers.
And I haven't even started on the whole business of additional BT
digits. Not only must we remember to add ''1'' to all its codes, but
comfortable three- and four-figure numbers in easy-to-remember hamlets
and villages have now turned into 11-figure monstrosities. What's worse
is that the system can't always cope. I dial a six-figure number in
Galashiels to be told by a computer-controlled voice that all five
figures numbers now carry a ''7'' in front of them.
By my reckoning, the entire population of Britain will soon have to
emulate the prodigious skills exhibited back in 1980 when Creighton
Carvello memorised pi to over 20,000 places in a demonstration lasting
over five hours. And I have trouble remembering four digits?
So how can these horrible secret numbers on which we are so dependent
be memorised by those with a penchant for forgetting? Some good ideas
have come from Dr Ann Marie Bostyn of Edinburgh University's Centre for
Continuing Education, who has run courses to help older people fight
memory loss.
Dr Bostyn looks at the way memory is related to other parts of life.
''People tend to remember letters more easily than numbers. The key to
remembering is to make a link with what you already know -- ie to link
images and words that already mean something, to numbers you want to
remember.'' As an example, Dr Bostyn used the four digit PIN code for
the bank's automatic teller machines. These you could convert into
letters then make a sentence beginning with each letter, in order to
create an image.
Cats Always Drink Cream thus becomes a mnemonic to remember 3143. Oh
Dear, Glasgow's Cloudy, becomes a formula for remembering 0473, my
stepfather's telephone area code. For most of us any sentence is easier
to remember than a group of numbers, so maybe this is a trick to try. As
we use the right hemisphere of the brain to process images and the left
side deals primarily with numbers, the object seems to be to try to link
the two sides of the brain.
''If you can make the images as funny or as rude as possible, that
seems to help memory,'' observes Dr Bostyn. So maybe The Herald should
come to our rescue with a competition on Mnemonics for Memory, to help
us find our way through modern life's maze of numbers.

THE Rolling Stones, Janet Jackson and Pink Floyd and the renting out
of washing machines in Chicago never had that much in common. So Thorn
EMI is having another look at demerging its EMI music business including
the HMV shops from the rental activities. It abandoned the idea last
year mainly because of tax problems.
Chairman Sir Colin Southgate told the annual meeting yesterday that
the group was far from a final decision but hopes to have the matter
decided by early next year.
In the past 12 months, it has been busy restructuring its tax
arrangements. It believes that on any demerger the capital gains bill
would drop from #150m to #50m.
It would be necessary to get clearance in 22 countries with the US
likely to prove the most difficult, partly because of the slowness in
dealing with tax issues. Sir Colin pointed out that it took ICI over a
year to float off its Zeneca drugs division.
The EMI music activities, which brought in #309m of operating profits
last year, including #14m from the 201 HMV stores and almost exactly
twice that of rentals would be a highly attractive catch for many
international consumer and entertainment oriented groups. These include
Walt Disney, Viacom, and Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation.
On the opposite tack, Sir Colin told shareholders to forget any
thoughts that Thorn EMI is interested in buying either Reed Consumer
Books or WH Smith. Thorn already owns Dillons.

The dance floors seem crowded but they are not quite as they were --
Stephen Ferguson shakes an ankle at self-expression.
IUSED to do it alone in my bedroom where nobody could see me. Usually
with the light turned off. Now I do it in public where everybody can see
me. But it's okay, because they're all doing it too. It's a kind of
group thing. It's also a sexy thing in many ways, and often quite
frantic.
But we're all adults, and we've all gone beyond the demands of coy
selfconsciousness -- for a night, at least. And, thankfully, it's not
illegal. It's just a sign of the times, a social shift that has taken
place ever-so gradually, like sedimentary formation, like growing-up,
like finding out who you are.
Call it mastermotion, or solo-clubbing -- the act of dancing alone in
a nightclub, in your own space with your own agenda, often entering the
nightclub alone free of the demands of the herd, and the obligatory
compromises of coupledom.
Life's mysteries; those big, bulky, fatty questions, have a habit of
unravelling in time. And after going largely unquestioned for many
years, the time-served rules of clubbing have lost their dense array of
knots, and have come to appear vacuous -- pointless.
Questions like: why go to a club as part of some strange kind of urban
posse and stick together for the duration of the evening like a
misunderstood religious sect? And why should women dance around a
mystical circle of handbags as if waiting for them to transmogrify into
appetising, perfect males? And why, oh why, should a bloke have to
request a dance with a girl by administering a brutal couple of shoves
to her shoulder, followed by a bovine grunt, and a delinquent nod toward
the dance-floor?
''If you go to a club with other people they can get in the way of you
having a good time,'' says Paul, manager of Cafe Ventura and a regular
solo-clubber. ''To solo-club you have to enjoy your own company, and
feel comfortable with the sense of anonymity it can give you.''
In nightclubs in Glasgow such as The Sub-Club, The Tunnel, and The
Voodoo Room a similar attitude to Paul's can be found duplicated in
growing numbers, just like in clubs up and down the country. People are
feeling increasingly more comfortable about going to clubs on their own,
safe in the knowledge that the character of many nightclubs no longer
brand the solo-clubber as an outsider.
''Atmosphere'' used to be defined as a simple hybrid of the music and
the small circle of people you arrived with. But today, those who do
still go to clubs in groups, invariably separate soon after entering --
becoming immersed in the varied colours and dance-styles of the mass --
and staying removed from each other for the majority of the night.
Times have changed; the definition of atmosphere has changed. It has
grown, expanded from the compact to the universal; the parameters of the
clubbers' experience set now to include everyone in the club. No longer
is the presence of others in the club merely incidental; an
inconsequential element on the periphery of your own closed, bubble-like
experience. Hell is not other people, but rather the absence of other
people.
But is solo-clubbing merely a more youthful term for singles clubbing
-- that escalating partner-grabbing disco-craze favoured by the
abundantly hormonal, and abundantly wrinkled, in society?
''Sure, sometimes you do meet somebody you like,'' says Jenny, a
shimmering blond wearing a spangly-sparkly short thing, who arrived at
The Tunnel nightclub with a group of girlfriends (who are ''over there,
somewhere,'' she thinks).
''But really you just want to have a good time, soak up the
atmosphere. You don't need to dance with a partner. Everybody's your
partner!''
Although masterdancing is essentially a musical and cultural
phenomenon, the fact that nineties society has become more at ease with
the sight of people on their own, has made solo-clubbing slip easily
into mainstream practice. People do not necessarily go solo-clubbing
because they have no-one to go with, or because they are lonely -- it's
simply something they want to do.
So, what is it like to be a solo-clubber?
Terry believes he knows exactly what it's like. He's just been to
Cleopatra's nightclub in the West End of Glasgow, a club cast in the
mould of the past. No masterdancers there. It's 3am, and he staggers
along Great Western Road on sleeping legs, staring down at them with the
wandering eyes of drunkenness, wondering if he has picked up somebody
else's legs by mistake.
''They're all nutters, those people,'' he says. ''You wouldn't catch
me in one of those clubs. They're all on drugs, aren't they? They're all
on that E stuff. Jumping up and down, and all that. That music drives
them all daft. I mean, dancing on your own? What's that all about?''
Terry's is not an uncommon opinion But, hold on. Maybe Terry has a
better grasp on reality than he has over his body. Perhaps all
solo-clubbers are indeed drug-crazed zombies, entranced by noise, made
mentally redundant by pugilistic rhythms and the rat-a-tat of syncopated
synth sounds.
''The club scene of today grew out of the youth drug-culture
associated with the acid-house and rave scene of the late eighties,''
says Brian Reid, manager of The Tunnel. ''But as the music developed
into mainstream clubs where the clientele are more mature, the music
itself has become more respectable.''
Also, as the music gradually changed into the diversity that
characterises contemporary house music -- more rhythmic, more emotional
and more intelligent in its construction -- the drug equation has
declined.
''These days the majority of clubbers are able to gain a similar high
through music and atmosphere as people can get through drug-taking,''
says DJ Harri of The Sub-Club and The Voodoo Room. ''I think the club
scene is becoming less and less about drugs; people want to hear the
music, they want to be aware of what's going on, and how the night is
building.''
Building music throughout the night is also at odds with the
conventional notion of nightclubs, with their pop chart orientated
play-list that feels like a multitude of hit-and-run associations devoid
of development, topped by the mandatory ''smoochie'' record for the
predatory male to make his move on the female prey.
The music which inspires the solo-clubber is invariably free of
lyrics, free also of readily identifiable riffs -- the key ingredients
are the surprising, the provocative and the enticing, suffused with a
palpable wave of purpose and direction.
An empty dance-floor at the start of a night has a magical allure as
coloured lights illuminate its surface. Dry ice billows; sifting through
different shapes and shades. The loudness and demanding intensity of the
music fills the club like something crouched and confined; far too big
for the space it is in.
Eventually the first dancing figure -- long-awaited, long-anticipated
-- shuffles onto the dance-floor; there is a tangible swell of
excitement and expectation from everyone prowling at the dance-floor's
edge. The dancing figure seems to both break the spell of the
dance-floor's emptiness, and create a new one of movement and pleasure
and rhythm, all at the same time.
Within half an hour -- if time has any real meaning when the clubbing
experience properly begins -- the club is like a sound-swept forest of
dancing figures: some on top of the sound speakers, others scattered
over every available inch of the dance-floor and its adjacent areas.
For the solo-clubber, the surrounding vision is of fleeting fractions
of dancing torsos and limbs, keen smiles, flurries of movement -- all
seeming to be extensions of your own body; as if you own a hundred
limbs, a hundred arms, and a hundred little fractions of atmosphere too,
all comprising the essential whole.
And, with the help of skilful and instinctive DJs, the over-all
atmosphere flies and dips throughout the night; a living thing in
itself.
If you are wondering what masterdancers get from the experience of
clubbing then that is it: the feeling that individuality is allowed,
that the possession of it is universal -- and, of course, entirely
normal.
Yet it would be wrong to paint a picture of the solo-clubbers' world
as one of absolute egalitarianism. Within the culture of nightclubs
relationships are still made and undone, friendships still flourish and
flounder, alcohol still enlightens some and devours others, and for
women clubbing on their own, masterdancing -- like walking alone on a
street, like going to the cinema or walking the dog -- can still mean
exposure and vulnerability.
Sally is a jewellery designer drawn to the techno sounds of DJs like
Terry and Jason at The Garage, and the techno club Pure in Edinburgh,
and solo-clubbing seems a natural thing to do. For a woman the rules of
clubbing do not always stay the same. ''If I was going to a club on my
own, even if I knew a lot of people who would be there, I would dress
differently -- my clothes would be less revealing -- simply because men
can easily misinterpret this as a sign of availability,'' she says.
''There are always guys who stumble into a club for the first time,
and don't know the rules that the regulars abide by, who don't
understand the main reason why we're all there.''
What this seems to underline is how fallacious Terry's opinion is of
solo-clubbing being a drug-driven phenomenon. Would it be possible for
clubs to be such a microcosm of contemporary life, with all its flaws
and foibles and its burgeoning strengths, if the preternatural effects
of drug-taking held sway over the dance-floor?
Margaret Thatcher was so right -- and so wrong -- when she stated that
there was no such thing as society, only individuals. The contemporary
club scene shows that both exist: a closely-bound social structure
comprised entirely of individuals. But also that pleasure is something
best shared among the many -- not huddled over, and coveted, by a select
few.

AND so the Bosnian conflict enters a new stage with escalated military
intervention by the big Western powers. Reluctance and doubt are strong,
for the good reason that everything else so far has failed in external
attempts to cure Bosnia's bleeding. Resort to more air power as
threatened last night will influence events but not end the war. Mr
Major deserves credit for his initiative although his actions must,
inevitably, be judged by results. He has not much to win and a lot to
lose if the plan hatched by the troops contributors, all in some measure
of disagreement, fails as it could easily do.
No-one has yet succeeded in taming the savagery of the Bosnian Serbs,
justifiably condemned again yesterday for their barbarism which is an
affront to civilised values. The sight of refugees, sick, starving,
wounded, and bereaved, streaming from ethnic cleansing sweeps is a sight
familiar to European eyes from television pictures of horrors in Africa.
But this time the horror is in modern Europe where such images should
have been banished permanently by events 50 years ago. Cries for
vengeance are understandable. The temptation is to rush into a
full-scale assault on the Bosnian Serbs, in the style of the Gulf war,
which brought together an irresistible international military coalition.
But the Gulf war was easily more winnable than the struggle in the
Balkans for all sorts of reason, not least the reluctance of the United
States to be dragged in to what it sees, understandably, as an internal
European conflict. There is a terrible truth for European pretensions:
for all their nuclear firepower neither Britain nor France can put
together a few helicopters for a particularly tricky job. The days are
gone when one or two nations -- the US and possibly the Russians
excepted -- could police the world. What is needed in Bosnia, above all,
and despite all the outrage over atrocities, is patience and planning.
Hard as it is to accept, one fact is plain: it is too late to take back
immediately the territorial gains made in recent days by the Bosnian
Serbs, if at all. Restoration of ''cleansed'' so-called ''safe'' areas
might be an option for the future and punishment for the Serbs. For the
moment those nations providing a peacekeeping force in Bosnia have
finally and properly delineated the limit on Bosnian Serb adventure.
There must be no further appeasement. This is a policy which will
command overwhelming public support in the short term. If it fails and
the UN has to pull out, the result will be open war, possibly involving
major power support for all three sides. Lifting the arms embargo would
have the same effect. Belatedly, it seems this dismal but inescapable
logic has won the day among the troops contributors. This is probably
enough to keep the Russians on side which is essential to a settlement
in Bosnia. In Brussels earlier this week Mr Kozyrev, Russian Foreign
Minister, appeared resigned to stern resistance to the latest Bosnian
Serb outrages but determined not to see that resistance turned into the
level of intervention which could provoke a wider war. In a perverse way
this grudging approach is helpful for those who, like the British,
believe that only politics and negotiation can end the conflict.
The option now enshrined in agreed policy -- punishing air strikes and
associated measures -- is the middle way and the commonsense approach.
It will be called a fudge but it is also the only available alternative
to open warfare. Depressingly, a further threat to progress now looms:
it is hostage-taking, a practice which seems likely to mark the progress
of this nasty little war.

''THERE is no winner, but the Church has been damaged incalculably''.
So said the Very Rev Brandon Jackson, Dean of Lincoln, this week after
his acquittal on charges of alleged sexual misconduct with a woman
verger. One is tempted to say a threefold amen to the Dean's comments.
Indeed I would go further and say that the Lincoln Cathedral controversy
which has rumbled on for several years is a parable of what is going
wrong throughout society.
It is tempting to dismiss it as a stairheid row in a cathedral close,
a Trollopian menage so acutely observed by Antony Trollope in a previous
generation and skilfully caught by Joanna Trollope in her aga sagas of
rectors' wives and cathedral choirs. But the gift of both Trollopes is
to use the microcosm of High Anglican life as a stage to portray traits
and emotions which are much more universal. Their characters are easily
recognisable in any office or suburban street.
If anyone thinks that their work is a ridiculous fiction, I hope they
were watching the ITV documentary The Big Story screened the day
following the Dean's acquittal. I don't know whether it was presenter
Dermot Murnaghan who managed to persuade both the Dean and his chief
critics among the cathedral canons to appear, but the result was a
riveting piece of journalism. The astonishing frankness of all concerned
revealed the extent of the mutual contempt and bitterness which exists
within the cathedral.
The Bishop of Lincoln at the outset had apparently approved the
appointment of Dean Jackson, an outspoken no-nonsense marathon runner
with an evangelical bent. His discovery of financial practices and
decisions by the cathedral chapter which were dubious at best and
incompetent at worst, led to the Bishop approving a report in which he
invited the canons to ''consider their position''. This somewhat wet
verdict aroused contempt of the Dean and met with no response from the
canons.
Relations between Dean and Bishop further deteriorated when the latter
vetoed the Dean's choice as precentor and brought in another clergyman.
Precentor and Dean quickly rubbed each other the wrong way and when the
neurotic lady verger made her accusation of sexual misconduct to the
Precentor he lost no time in reporting it to the Bishop, who then
referred it to a consistory court, a highly formal procedure (and which
is rumoured to have cost #500,000 in legal fees) despite stout denials
by the Dean and the fact that there were doubts about the accuser's
peace of mind.
Now it is the Bishop who must surely be considering his position,
given the unambiguous mature of the verdict and the waste of money.
However, I invite you to consider this whole affair, not as some arcane
scandal in clerical closets, but as typical of contemporary life. The
slurping gravy train for lawyers has made the price of justice too high
for many to contemplate undertaking.
There appear to be many ill-considered prosecutions (this one and the
Wee Burney case spring to mind as instances where a pastoral counsellor
not a prosecuting counsel would have been appropriate). On the other
hand we read this week that many prosecutions of violent crime are being
abandoned for lack of resources. The evidence is in our paper daily that
the justice system is in an appalling state.
We are deflected from this glaring scandal by the bread and circuses
of sex scandals such as the Hugh Grant affair. But much darker and more
sinister is the implication to be drawn from a spate of scandals
involving professional people.
Doctors, teachers, lawyers, clergymen are allocated high expectations
by the general public. Some have feet of clay, but others are victims of
false complainers like the sad lady verger. This in turn leads to a
climate in which these professionals are wary about what they do lest
they be accused of misconduct. Not all cases find their way into the
papers. I know a teacher who was assaulted by a mother who claimed he
had assaulted her daughter, a claim without a shred of truth.
The case of the Dean of Lincoln will unfortunately make many more
professionals extremely wary of offering human affection to those in
emotional distress. Another nail in the coffin of a compassionate
society.
Another is apparently in the coffin of the old man found dead this
week in Anderston after lying for eight months behind his door. He had
family, he had neighbours, and he had friends in a nearby pub but none
of them had known. I am not blaming them for this. Recently after
several visits I could get no answer from a deaf man in frail health
living on his own. No-one knew the son's phone number. Should I have had
the door broken in by the police? I would then have felt very foolish
because I saw him last week in the street.
Perhaps the answer lies not in allocating blame or responsibility for
community care to either professionals or family and friends. The most
effective solution is one which involves co-operation between all
possible sources of compassion. I saw that work brilliantly this week
when a man from the Rotary got wheels moving to help a young Ukrainian
man badly injured on a visit to Scotland. It is when these sources are
ignored or work against one another that the damage is done to a
compassionate society. That applies as much within housing estates and
schools as it does to Lincoln Cathedral.

MICHAEL FRY must live on a world where common experience of working
people has not yet existed.
To say (July 19) that people choose to work for less than a decent
wage knowing the stresses and strains this imposes on their social
existence, shows the man is, to put it mildly, unworldly.
He should take a 12-month sabbatical from his present occupation and
apply to a job centre for unskilled or semi-skilled vacancies, then come
back and tell us what a great thing it is to let bosses pay whatever
they can get away with.

IT'S one of those grainy black-and-white clips that leaves you
shouting: ''Pinch me.'' In the first episode of The Rock That Doesn't
Roll (ITV, Sunday), Tom Morton's six-part series on music and
Christianity, viewers can watch the uncut story of The Joy Strings, The
Salvation Army's sixties pop band. It is a dark tale of Holy Joes and
Josephines and their sound-wave war with Satan. It was their founder
William Booth who asked: ''Why should the Devil have all the best
music?''
His answer, unfortunately, was brass bands which was probably
responsible for driving thousands of souls to dance with the devil to
pop and rock 'n' roll. However, in the sixties a throwaway line to a
hungry press corp about a Christian pop band evolved into The Joy
Strings.
What started with three girls became a mixed group, only the lads
could play guitar -- three chords at that. Their musical mission began
with packed halls and a little controversy.
As Lt Col Peter Dalziel, The Joy Strings' former axe-hero, explained:
''On one occasion we were performing in the south of England and the
next morning the minister locked the gates and wouldn't let the
parishioners in until the circuit bishop had been round to reconsecrate
the church because The Joy Strings had played there the night before.''
His wife Sylvia Dalziel, was the lead singer. A holy ABBA without a D
I V O R C E by Tammy Wynette.
Morton even talks to Tammy in Nashville, about the influence her
god-fearing background had on her musical career. This series equates to
The Blues Brothers by author and journalist Tom Morton. There may only
be one of him, but he's still on a mission from God. And this time it's
personal!
The renegade former evangelist and gospel singer wants to confess the
churches' sins of using, some might say, abusing popular music.
''He loves you/ yeh, yeh, yeh
He loves you/ yeh, yeh, yeh
God loves you, yeh, yeh, yeh''
Bet John Lennon had something to say about that when he made it past
St Peter. That's if he made it past St Peter, didn't he write Imagine
There's No Heaven/ It's Easy If You Try?
Others who had their songs messed with by the God Squad include Brian
Wilson. Paul McCartney may have described The Beach Boys' God Only Knows
as the finest pop song ever written, but it obviously wasn't good enough
for God.
''God only knows what we'd do without him.'' There that's better.
Morton sings us these songs and he's not half bad, strumming along with
his baseball cap and earring twinkling as if to say, ''I believe in God,
it's cool.'' And it is.
Morton said: ''I wish I could convey to you what it was like in the
1960s to be part of a rockin' jumpin'-about Sunday school group,
shouting very loudly to the accompaniment of maybe a piano and
accordian, people stamping their feet and waving their hands in the air.
It was all the excitement of communicating a simple view of Christian
faith.''
Blimey, all I had to do was wear my best, new, and scratchy tartan
trousers. If we were attending 11.30 mass I'd wait till 11.25 before I
put them on, preferring to wander around in my shirt and Y-fronts rather
than develop a skin rash.
Even at mass I was never allowed to sing. When the priest announced:
''We will now sing hymn No 473,'' my father would lean over and whisper:
''That doesn't include you, son.'' Such was my inability to hold a note.
But, God, I'd have been great with a tuba.
In later programmes, Morton boards the gospel express across the
buckle of the bible-belt, through Nashville and Memphis to trace
gospel's development from its roots, through R&amp;B and white rock'n'roll,
to the present expressions in Pentecostalist choirs and British soul
bands. No pun intended.
I've always felt that the problem with religious programming is that
it's on a Sunday morning -- so no-one watches it, with everyone either
still slumbering or perched on the church pews. The Rock That Doesn't
Roll is a welcome wake-up call but which leaves only one question
unanswered.
Whatever happened to Dana?
* IT's funny, but no matter how humorous Punt and Dennis (BBC2,
Friday) are, I can't forget Rob Newman's comment on why he and David
Baddiel split The Mary Whitehouse Experience of which both acts were an
integral part. He said: ''It was like trying to make a concept album
with Showaddywaddy.'' Ouch! But while Newman is an artist, all dark
moods, black clothes and a terrible debut novel, Steve Punt and Hugh
Dennis are jesters furiously cranking the handle on the laughter
machine.
Occasionally they catch their bells on it but now the machine has
churned out a new product for the new series, which is the comedy spoof.
You know the one where comedians recreate a popular series, like say,
Heartbeat, Bugs or The X-Files, to mention what Punt and Dennis are
playing with, and then go for the obvious laughs.
Favourite characters like Milky Milky have also been kept in a warm
cupboard to ensure they remain tastelessly stagnant, while the humour is
fresh from the fridge.
What makes Friday a funny night? Thank God It's Friday may be the cry
of those who've just put the final bullet in the working week. But for
guests or victims of Clive Anderson's acid wit on Whose Line Is It
Anyway (Channel 4, Friday), it's time to bite the bullet. Roseanne, Have
I Got News For You, and the likes of Cheers have all hugged the
beginning of the week's end. Don't people go to pubs, any more?
Well, not like they used to. And it's easy to see why we postpone the
going-out night until Saturday -- just look at that TV line-up.
The seventh series of the award-winning comedy improvisation game has
always been worth staying home for, but can it continue? Stars like
Josie Lawrence, Mike McShane and Tony Slattery will appear . . .
eventually, but until then newcomers Niall Ashdown and Caroline Quentin
hold the fort against Anderson's savage attack.
* SCIENCE fiction's gift to the world is not vision or anoraks, but
names. Once-great names like Darth Vader and Spock have now been
rendered ordinary by the murmuring lips of a million sci-fi fans
mouthing along to videos of Star Wars and Star Trek. It takes a brave
new series to randomly arrange letters and call it a race, but Babylon 5
(Channel 4, Tuesday) does so with style. On the five-mile-long space
station you can imagine the Minibari Federation squabbling over tea with
the Vorlon Empire, insulted that their name has been borrowed to
advertise an industrial drain cleaner.
Like all good sci-fi series, inter-galactic war is what must be
avoided and in this week's episode Babylon's Psi Corps discover a secret
revolutionary movement working in their midst. The Internet will be
burning crimson when the American fans discover that Britain has secured
screening rights before the big US network. Just tell them how it ends.
* WHITE Coat Fever, like menstruation, is cyclical and arrives on the
last Thursday of every month. This is when employees of Greater Glasgow
Health Board are paid and go out to play. At Cleopatra's, Glasgow's most
notorious night-club playing doctors and nurses comes more naturally to
trained medics. The secrets of such an establishment are re-revealed in
Nurses (C4, Thursday) with a repeat showing of Cutting Edge's brilliant
documentary.
The film is a grim view of a thankless task. Nurses clean up
incontinent patients, empty urine bottles, deal with drunks and the
dying.
But on one night out, the cameras followed student nurses to
Cleopatra's -- or as the clipped English voice-over explains . . .
''Clatty's Glasgow slang for dirty''.
Inside the droops in suits are hoping that the nurses will live up to
their reputation. ''When you tell people you're a nurse, eyebrows always
go up as if to say, 'I know what you're like'. It's just the stereotype
of nursing.''
Ironically Nurses is screened . . . on the last Thursday of the month.
See you in the queue.
* IT was Lord Acton who said: ''All power tends to corrupt, but
absolute power corrupts absolutely.'' And he was absolutely right, as
General Idi Amin Dada of Uganda shows in movie-maker Barbet Schroeder's
documentary. Nick Broom-field may have pioneered the documentary that
never reaches it's subject, but Schroeder prefers to shoot right between
the eyes. In General Idi Amin Dada, (Sunday, BBC 2) he has updated his
1971 profile of the daddy of all recent political monsters.
The 18-stone dictator, who hung medals on his chest like fridge
magnets, but slaughtered hundreds of thousands, now lives in exile in
Zaire after he was ousted in 1979. Schroeder shows him at the height of
his powers. The footage seems incredible. Amin asks the British Prime
Minister to send a plane to Uganda so that he may load it with food for
''starving Britain''. Amin defends Hitler's holocaust while training his
troops to invade Israel.
The cameras are even invited into a cabinet meeting after which a
minister was murdered. But perhaps the most frightening footage is Amin
togged out in his swimming costume during a race against his terrified
ministers who try to lose without him knowing. Schroeder, who went on to
make, thrillers such as Single White Female and Kiss of Death, shows
that sometimes true crime goes without punishment.
* PAULA Milne is rapidly rising in the shadow of Lynda Le Plante as
the second most successful female writer in television. After the
critical and commercial success of The Minister's Wife, she returns to
our screens with a second series of Chandler and Co (Friday, BBC 1).
While Imogen Stubbs pranced around Anna Lee, with the youthful
exuberance of a character from a Tampax ad, the gumshoes of Chandler and
Co are made of much sterner stuff.
Now that the casualties of the last series have dropped out, the
private detective agency has slimmed down to just Elly, (Catherine
Russell). But the current case involves an astute widow and her adult
son, who set out to crack it when a stranger begins a heavy-breathing
campaign against them, and takes a keen interest in ladies' underwear.

A POST OFFICE investigation into the possible reinstatement of a
sacked postwoman was a ''charade'', an industrial tribunal has found.
The tribunal ordered the Post Office to pay #17,084 compensation to
Mrs Vivienne Wilson, 38, of Sanday, Orkney.
The payment order was made after Royal Mail had ignored an earlier
industrial tribunal demand to reinstate Mrs Wilson, following a ruling
that she had been unfairly dismissed.
Mrs Wilson, of Hillfield, Sanday, was celebrating the wedding of her
daughter, Lorraine, yesterday. She said she was delighted to be cleared
by the tribunal and the compensation would help recoup some of her lost
income and help with wedding costs. However, she was bitter that Royal
Mail had refused to give her back her job.
Mrs Wilson, who delivered mail on the north side of Sanday, was
dismissed in August 1993 for ''gross misconduct'' after it was
discovered that for 11 years she had been delivering unstamped letters
containing invoices from the building and haulage contractors business
which she owned with her husband.
She did not deny the charge but said the bills did not enter the Royal
Mail system and were ''merely dropped off'' as a normal part of island
life.
Fifty-five Post Office customers on the island wrote letters in
support of their postwoman, who claimed she was the victim of ''personal
grudges''.
Mr James Anderson, Royal Mail's area manager based in Inverness,
decided to sack Mrs Wilson, despite concluding in his report ''that the
whole issue was a result of feuding on the island''.
An industrial tribunal in Kirkwall decided last December that Mrs
Wilson had been unfairly dismissed, awarded #12,716 compensation, and
ordered her reinstatement. The Post Office failed to give Mrs Wilson her
job back and a further tribunal hearing was held in May.
At that hearing, Mr Anderson said that, following press reports that
Mrs Wilson was to get her job back, 34 residents of Sanday wrote to
object. The letters were not shown to the tribunal because ''feelings
ran high on the island''.
Among those who objected were a woman who owned a sub-post office on
Sanday, whothreatened to resign, and her husband, who was the postman
for the south of the island.
As part of his investigation into possible reinstatement, Mr Anderson
went to Sanday on March 28 this year and spoke to people who had written
letters of objection. However, he admitted that he did not speak to
anyone who had written in support.
The tribunal also noted that, four weeks earlier, the Post Office had
already written to the tribunal, saying it was impracticable to
reinstate Mrs Wilson.
The tribunal said Royal Mail ''could not now say to the tribunal that
they had carried out an open-minded investigation on March 28 -- that
investigation was a charade''.
In setting the new award, which overtook the initial compensation
order, the tribunal criticised Royal Mail's failure to obey the original
ruling.
A spokesman for Royal Mail said it was ''disappointed'' at the outcome
of the tribunal but would stand by its findings. However, he added that
it still felt Mrs Wilson's re-employment ''was not a realistic option''.

FOLLOWING the Greenbury Report on share options, I have watched the
events unfolding with interest, particularly the sting in the tail for
the ''thin cats'', and Sir Richard's eagerness to get a reversal.
Unfortunately, it seems the Chancellor and his Treasury team do not
employ the same return or exchange policy as the Marks and Spencer
chairman is used to.

I WAS delighted to read in The Herald that the Scottish Natural
Heritage are seriously considering reintroducing European beavers to
Scotland (July 18). I have become very familiar with the species in the
course of my work as a biologist in Norway, which has convinced me that
they would be an excellent restoration to our fauna.
There is no doubt that sufficient suitable habitat exists in Scotland:
a family of beavers requires, on average, only a 1km stretch of river or
2km of suitable loch shore in order to thrive, and the better wooded
river systems of Scotland -- for example, the Tay, Spey, and Dee (among
others) -- each have by themselves sufficient suitable habitat for a
viable population.
The tourist potential of beavers should also be realised. My favourite
beaver family live on a small loch at the public golf course near my
home, and from spring through to late autumn are active in full
daylight, carrying on their fascinating lives oblivious to golfers
teeing off only metres away (their home is a water hazard on the sixth
hole).
''Beaver safaris'' are an established part of the tourist industry in
Norway; the potential in Scotland, with a huge population of casual or
serious wildlife enthusiasts only a few hours' drive away, would be very
much greater.
The most likely source of anxiety that the reintroduction proposal
might cause is of damage to forestry and other economic interests.
Beavers do not eat coniferous trees, so direct damage to economic
species is not a problem.
Here in Scandinavia, the Norwegian Forest Owners' Assocation, after
study, concluded that beaver damage to forestry was so minor that it was
unecomomic to insure against it; in Sweden, a series of studies
concluded that beaver activities had ''no economic consequences on a
national scale''.
Finally, beavers were reintroduced to my part of Norway 25 years ago
and are expanding rapidly in numbers. Despite spending most my time
fieldworking in beaver habitat, and my fondest hopes, I have not yet
managed to find a beaver dam.
The European species is simply not the indefatigable engineer nature
documentaries on its American cousin might imply.

ELIZABETH WESTCOTT opens up a source of useful advice, or perhaps a
tome suitable for pressing flowers in?
HAS the do-it-yourself concept gone crazy? Are we so dependent on
experts we have to read a book before we boil an egg? Managing Your
Home, edited by Liz Vercoe, is a massive, hardbacked tome which aims to
answer every problem we come up against in everyday life.
Covering topics as diverse as fixing a leaky tap to choice of
contraception (fixing a leaky tap)? there is a chapter for almost every
compartment of modern-day life, each written, of course, by the
appropriate expert. And while there is nothing in detail (particularly
with complex topics like finance) the book is full of useful, basic
information.
As Liz Vercoe states in her introduction, the book is a compendium of
''if only I'd known then what I know now'' wisdom. It has been compiled
for people like me, who somehow missed learning some of those tips which
make life run so much more smoothly.
I don't know how to unblock the sink, or how the electricity works,
and when I lift the bonnet of a car I am confronted by an unintelligible
network of metal intestines. While the book is hardly likely to turn me
into an expert in the art of motor-cycle maintenance, at least I now
have something more of a notion of how to jump-start an engine.
Managing Your Home is easy to read (not surprisingly, since it is
designed to be an idiot-proof guide) with checklists and simple
black-and-white diagrams to demonstrate knitting and wallpapering. Even
the more competent among us, who may well scoff at the explanation of
what it means to fry food, could dig up some interesting tips.
Did you know, for example, about your rights under the Data Protection
Act, or that you can give unlimited tax-free gifts of up to #250 each
year? Did you know that by hanging bunches of fresh or dried watercress
in your cupboards you can prevent mice, or painting nail varnish on
button threads will stop buttons falling off?
Men can no longer plead ignorance as an excuse for not ironing their
own shirts; the laundry section includes an ''ironing know-how'' guide.
Alongside these snippets are longer, detailed solutions to more
difficult problems, timetables, conversion tables, and a list of useful
addresses.
The Health section, which includes A to Z guides to common complaints
and childhood illnesses, and instructions as to what to do if someone
has a fever or has fallen unconscious, contains information that no
household should be without.
Managing Your Home seems destined to be one of those books that makes
its way on to the bookshelf (sandwiched perhaps between the
Encyclopaedia Brittanica and the Complete Oxford Dictionary) never to be
picked up again. However, even if you belong to the ''get someone in to
do it'' brigade, Managing Your Home will at least give you a few clues.
After all, the more knowledge you have, the less likely you are to be
duped or ripped off by an incompetent ''expert''.

ON the Glorious First (of July) I had the chance to access your
Internet. My good friend, Anne Brown, the Registrar at Hutchie Grammar,
had passed on the news. She has long known my lament about being stuck
out here with the kangaroos . . . and little substantial news of
Scotland.
First, congratulations. One hopes it will wildly exceed expectations.
The chance to keep in touch with local business while one travels the
world will no doubt be a great attraction although the chance to read a
Scottish version of the great international events we see on TV may not
be quite so exciting.
Naturally there will be all sorts of readers and I'm sure your
selection of material will be appropriate.
Having said that, I am sure you will be aware of The Tyranny of
Distance, a phrase and a book of the same title by Professor Geoffrey
Blainey. Our problem has always been distance; the difficulties are
melting away, of course, but up to this point of time my perception is
that expressions of Scottish thought and imagination have often been
either filtered or ignored by Fleet Street.
Perhaps this new venture will provide that opportunity to share some
of the powerful ideas which have shaped concepts like Scottish law or
education. Too often we have at times gross generalisations presented as
universal British practice.

<HEADLINE>Skye ferry decision is 'council responsibility'</HEADLINE>

THE Government believes that it is entirely up to Highland Regional
Council whether a new ferry service is allowed to run in competition to
the new #24m Skye Bridge.
The Government has already told its own Caledonian MacBrayne that it
must cease operating its ferry when the bridge opens in late September
or early October. However, the locally organised Skye Boat Company is
still determined to provide a ferry as an alternative to the bridge.
The financial arrangements for the privately funded bridge are known
to be extremely tight. It is unlikely that the proposed levels of toll
could pay it off within the time laid down, with a maximum of 27 years,
if there was any effective competition.
This week, Ross, Cromarty, and Skye MP Charles Kennedy tabled a
parliamentary question asking what advice the Government had given to
Highland Regional Council on the use of slipways for future ferries and
if the Secretary of State would make a statement on the issue.
The Roads Minister, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, replied: ''We have
not given advice to Highland region on the usage of the piers at Kyle of
Lochalsh and Kyleakin for future ferry use. This is a matter for
Highland Regional Council. The Scottish Office, however, would not be
prepared to permit any parking or queuing for a ferry on the trunk road
in Kyle.''
At present, the ferry slipway at Kyle of Lochalsh is owned by the
Scottish Office as the final few feet of the trunk road, the A87. Once
across, Caledonian MacBrayne ferry drivers enter Skye at Kyleakin by way
of a slipway owned by Highland Regional Council joining the council road
A850.
Mr Kennedy said last night: ''The Government is ducking for cover
every time anyone mentions competition for the bridge. In the first
place, they still own one of the slipways, although that is due to be
transferred to Highland region or its successor, the Highland Council,
once the bridge carries the trunk road.
''More importantly, this is the Government's flagship free enterprise
project which is suppose to usher in a new dawn for us all. Yet the
Government will not say whether it will allow its flagship to be exposed
to the waters of free-market competition.
''All they are doing is using the powers of central Government to
impose a monopoly on an island community and are now doing everything in
their power to protect it from any competition which could expose the
serious financial weaknesses inherent to the whole project.''
Neither Highland region nor the Scottish Office has yet received an
application to use the slipways for a ferry. In the region's case, it
would have to go before its roads and transport committee.
A Scottish Office spokesman confirmed that the Kyle of
Lochalsh/Kyleakin was a common user crossing without retained ferry
rights. As a result, anyone could run a ferry as long as they paid
harbour dues for use of the slipways.
Mrs Kathleen MacRae, treasurer of the Skye Bridge Appeal Group, told
The Herald the group was co-operating with the Skye Boat Company to
raise money: ''We are looking around for a vessel that would take six to
12 passengers.''

IN the first of a new series about the uneasy middle ground between
faith and misbelief Bel Mooney interviewed Kate Adie. As you would
expect from this extraordinary woman she explored with articulate
honesty her agnostic resistance and remaining attraction to spirituality
in God-form.
She talked of her attendance at all forms of religious gatherings
after human disasters and spoke of how her liberal intelligence waited
''like a hawk'' for that moment when a speaker would attempt to explain
why the atrocity had happened.
Her background was perfect for Devout Sceptic (Radio 4). She was
christened as a Methodist, sent to a militant Church of England school,
attended a Presbyterian Sunday school, had Orthodox Jewish neighbours,
and found herself as a teenager taking Sunday school herself.
''At my convent school we saved up our pocket money to give to the
black babies'' -- Adie recalls knitting woolly squares to make blankets
for sweltering Gambia. She has a wonderful sense of the ironic. Having
seen so much death in her time she has a sense of the ''other'' while
feeling that ''the body is but a body'': her materialism constantly
reminds her that what might have appeared as a miracle in one age could
have a rational scientific explanation just a few decades on.
Being an articulate witness to human desecration she does have a
strong sense for ''there but for the grace of God go I''. But when
Mooney asks her what her response would be if told that God did exist,
she said if that were the case, it was odd the knowledge had been held
back for so long. The supreme being as the ultimate tease.
She came across as a sort of wry head prefect who would not accept the
cruelty of fundamentalist excess in her playground. The revelation of a
Godhead should have come at the beginning of time, she said. Since this
had not happened she found herself, like so many of us, pausing just
before the point of faith . . . and wondering.
Michael O'Donnell went On the Bhamjee Beat (Radio 4) wondering what to
make of County Clare's first Asian Member of Parliament. This Labour MP,
a consultant psychiatrist, had an election manifesto which declared
''you've had the cowboys, now give an Indian a chance''. Born in South
Africa, his father owned a hardwear shop and worked to give his children
an education. When he came to Ireland it took him a while to adjust to
the fact that he could ask a white girl to dance, and when a pretty one
declared the music boring he promptly put on a Trini Lopez record and
found an Irish wife.
Both he and his lady were refreshingly honest and funny about the
family changes which occurred when he won his seat -- the little
daughter missing TV programmes because Daddy had to watch current
affairs; the teenage son declaring that his relationship with his father
was all the better for seeing him less.
Mary Robinson had paved the way for Dr Bhamjee's liberal agenda and I
thought it quite charming when his wife giggled with delight when she
talked about getting a Christmas card from the President.
My goodness, this politician sounded like a real person. His
tactlessness has evolved into a kind of cuteness: while trying to win
votes, instead of kissing babies he tells a female supporter that she
has put on weight since they last met (and she's still going to vote for
him). When he asks a leather-clad biker for his support the youth asks
what Bhamjee would do for him and the reply is ''absolutely nothing''.
Not cynicism but a practical awareness that without ministerial power
his influence is limited.
When away for long periods in Dublin he says he has been sexually
tempted but has not succumbed -- this unasked-for admission sounds a bit
tacky written down, but it simply came across as the truth.

JOHN BEATTIE'S article on the lack of sports facilities for young
people hit the nail on the head (July 17).
Three parcels of land less than half a mile from my Bishopbriggs
address have been given over to housing: two were football pitches and
one was the playing fields of the now closed Colston Secondary School.
In all three new estates play areas for the young have been omitted.
As for school sports facilities, it is a disgrace that many of our
larger schools lack a simple sports hall. Holyrood Secondary, with a
roll of over 2000, gets by with three antiquated gym halls and a blaes
pitch. Teams and individuals who gain success in their chosen sport do
so in spite of the school's facilities, not because of them.
It is not too late, however. If parents can put pressure on
politicians and the agencies involved, perhaps we can give our kids a
sporting chance.

* WEEDS can be attractive, and certainly look good in many natural
gardens, but they definitely don't appeal in decorative flower beds, on
lawns, or in the vegetable garden.
Many gardeners dislike using chemicals to remove them. You have to be
selective, but you can use contact weedkillers between vegetable rows if
you are very precise in applying it. It's far better to adopt a
programme of hand weeding mixed with hoeing, which may be arduous but is
certainly safer.
Spot treatment is better for lawns, rather than an overall
application. The one big worry with hormone weedkiller, especially in
July, is drift on to flowers or into greenhouses.
For really bad areas, where weeds have taken over, preparations like
Roundup can do an effective job but won't persist in the ground.
Safety precautions include wearing rubber gloves, goggles, and sets of
filter pads to protect the mouth and nose.
In high temperatures you should get swift action, but a word of
warning -- wash out sprayers after use and operate them so that the
lance is cleaned out too.
If in doubt, have separate sprayers for pesticides and weedkillers.
In July, you invariably get clusters of black fly on top of broad
beans. You can use an insecticide to deal with the problem, but nipping
out leading shoots will dispose of them. Should they persist, give a
whiff of insecticide at the top of the plants.
If hydrangeas have flowered in the house and you want to retain them,
cut them back to about 6-8in. This induces new growth for next year. Cut
back to an outward pointing bud which produces a shapely plant.
With grapes you will have to do some thinning using a pair of
sharp-pointed scissors. A nicely thinned and shaped bunch of grapes will
be on most show schedules.

RICHARD GOLLNER, to borrow Raymond Chandler's description of one Moose
Malloy, is a big guy, but no more than about six foot three high and no
wider than a beer truck. He looks as inconspicuous as a tarantula on a
slice of angel food -- which I think is what the Americans call what we
call angel cake.
To be more precise, what he looked like in Travels With My Camera:
Feeling Hungary (C4) was more like a slice of angel food in a nest of
peckish tarantulas, for Gollner was revisiting his homeland for the
first time since he and his father took it on the lam in 1956, and one
got the impression that he was less than overjoyed with what progress
had been made since then.
Unlike so many exiles returning to Eastern Europe to wonder innocently
at the recently introduced glories of free enterprise and the universal
availability of Coca-Cola and Bon Jovi albums, Gollner, while not
exactly hankering for the state-socialist years when every factory
worker might legitimately dream of one day owning a whole beetroot,
looked at the new Hungary with the sceptical and pessimistic eye of
Eeyore.
It's not so much that he was disappointed about things like the drug
problem (his god-daughter is in a rehab clinic), the universal petty
corruption (not much change there), and the gangsters cruising the
streets of Budapest in flash cars (the Russians are back, only this time
on a freelance basis and with less compunction about shooting people);
he was sad and angry, but not disappointed. He is, after all, a
Hungarian, and Hungarians don't expect much from the human condition,
which historically they have voluntarily departed in alarmingly large
numbers.
What he also is, is very funny and gentle in a gallows-humoured sort
of way, and although his travels told you little about post-communist
Hungary that you didn't already suspect, they told you a lot about the
permanent Hungary, a wry state of mind that knows life is too short to
make any great emotional investment in public matters. Phlegmatic,
kindly, and irresistibly cuddly, Gollner ought to get his own series to
wander around the world being pessimistic at large. Provisional title:
Don't Worry, It's Only For Life.
It was a week of a lot of hideously bad news from foreign parts,
mostly from what in more sensible times used to be called Yugoslavia,
and I couldn't bring myself to watch very much of it, nor do I really
want to talk about it. It's not that I'm a particularly tender-hearted
(or a particularly callous) guy: it's the contrast between the viewer's
riches of information and his poverty of power that makes that situation
so unbearable.
Just what is the appropriate reaction to the nightly scenes on
Newsnight (BBC2) of streets littered with dead bodies, or of miserable
trails of panic-stricken refugees -- looking uncannily like archive
footage of Second World War refugees fleeing from the Wehrmacht --
running away from the latest ''safe haven'' to have become a killing
field? Make one's way to Bosnia and join the anti-Serb resistance? Write
a letter to The Herald? Try to find a Serbian export that one can
continue not buying?
If it were a famine or an earthquake one could send money, and feel
that knowing about the situation had led to some small good, but
indignation without an outlet is at best queasy and at worst almost
exploitative. Yet one can hardly say Okay, that's enough Bosnia: bring
our gallant TV crews home. Maybe making you feel bad is what it's for;
maybe that's better than nothing. If nothing is done and the murder
continues, at least we won't have the excuse of saying we didn't know.
A strange kind of hope, however, came from another wound on the face
of this cockeyed world in True Stories: The Betrayed (C4), a documentary
from Russia's war against -- oh, historical irony -- the independence
movement in Chechnya.
Made by Clive Gordon, whose earlier The Unforgiving was one of the few
programmes so far to give a worthwhile insight into the historical
background of the Bosnian bloodbath, this was an individual rather than
a general story, focusing tightly on one humane and decent Cossack
Russian army officer, Colonel Kosov, and his efforts to help the
distraught mothers of some young Russian soldiers of whom nothing -- not
even a we-regret-to-say telegram from the Russian Army -- had been heard
since the battle for Grozny.
Dazed and confused, almost mad with grief, they were wandering around
the shattered town looking at random for their conscript sons, all
almost certainly dead, when Colonel Kosov, radiating sympathy and sorrow
like the jolly uncle who cheers up the bereaved at a family funeral,
piled them into a tank and took them to visit -- this is an extremely
informal war -- the Chechen high command. Colonel Kosov was received
like a brother, but out of the mothers' hearing he was told he was doing
no good, only encouraging false hope.
Kosov shrugged in an eloquently Russian sort of way. ''You know what a
mother is like,'' he said. ''They'd still want to see the body.'' Then
he took the mothers away and carried on looking. Later we saw him trying
to stop the gratuitous Russian destruction of a Chechen village. He was
a good man in a bad place.
That demonstration of how individual decency can flourish in a man
whose official purpose is anything but benign was a little straw to
clutch at on the banks of despair, suggesting that things don't
inevitably have to be this way: it's all just an enormous cock-up, let's
stand still for a moment and think about what we're doing, sort it out,
and try not to get into it again. I remembered the first programme I'd
seen this week, the incredibly poignant Live Aid Tenth Anniversary
(BBC2): all that good intention, yet we're still on the road to hell.
Elvis Costello's one-song set on that July evening at Wembley summed
up the tantalising possibilities. He came on alone with a guitar and
said ''This is an old English folk song -- I'm sure you all know it'' --
and sang All You Need Is Love. It was a spine-tingling moment, even if
John Lennon's slogan is not strictly speaking true: love, even like
Colonel Kosov's, isn't all the world needs, but it's a sine qua non.

AS a senior citizen and regular attender of the Thursday series I was
looking forward to renewing my subscription to the RSNO concerts in
Glasgow.
I tried to come to terms with the pricing policy, comparing this
season with last.
Last year senior citizens were offered a concessionary rate of #34.50
for six concerts. At #5.75 per concert this was indeed a very generous
discount, which was much appreciated. Such generosity, however, has not
been repeated this year.
Not only will the price per concert increase from #5.75 to #12, but
the number of concerts has been increased from six to nine -- an outlay
of #108 this year compared with #34.50 last year. An inflationary
spiral?
I must, of course, be fair, and concede that the management still
offer a concession for senior citizens. How much of a concession? The
saving on a #12 ticket is a munificent 75 pence.
I think I'll give this season a miss.

<TEXT>
From KURT SCHORK in Sarajevo
THE Bosnian Government army commander in the besieged Zepa enclave
threatened to shell Ukrainian peacekeepers yesterday if the United
Nations did not send a senior officer to mediate with attacking Serbs, a
UN spokesman said.
Bosnian Government forces defending Zepa had attacked the Ukrainians'
main base near the town for more than an hour on Thursday night with
machine guns, hand grenades, and rocket-propelled grenades, UN spokesman
Lieutenant-Colonel Gary Coward said in Sarajevo.
Another UN spokesman, Alexander Ivanko, said the local government
commander, Avdo Palic, had threatened to shell the Ukrainian compound
yesterday morning if a senior UN official did not mediate between the
warring parties.
Four mortar bombs exploded outside the Ukrainian base overnight but it
was not clear who had fired them, Mr Ivanko said.
Muslim soldiers in the government army claim the Ukrainians are
sympathetic to their fellow Orthodox Christian Serbs and have no
intention of trying to prevent them from capturing the small, hilly
enclave and its 17,000 Muslim inhabitants.
Mr Ivanko called on the Bosnian Government to halt attacks on UN
peacekeepers.
Sarajevo's UN deputy commander, Colonel Verhoglyad, was heading for a
Ukrainian observation post on the edge of Zepa in response to the threat
''to mediate and monitor the safe passage of civilians'', Mr Ivanko
said.
However, a UN spokeswoman later said Bosnian Serb forces blocked the
colonel and his liaison team at the Rogatica checkpoint, about half way
between the Serb stronghold of Pale and Zepa, despite the fact his
presence had also been requested by the Bosnian Serb commander.
The Rogatica checkpoint is notoriously difficult to get through.
Serb commander General Ratko Mladic has told Zepa's civilians to leave
under UN escort and stated his intention to take prisoner all men aged
from 18 to 55 and hold them until they are exchanged with Serb prisoners
held by the government.
A UN official said the negotiated surrender of Zepa collapsed after
the failure of secret talks in Sarajevo between the Government and the
Serbs over a massive prisoner exchange.
''The talks fell apart yesterday when the Bosnian army accused the
Serbs of cheating on the numbers of people they hold from Srebrenica. It
was supposed to have been a clean sweep deal for both sides,'' the
official said.
The UN said it had no reliable figure for the number of persons
detained by Bosnia's combatants.
Serb forces seized the eastern enclave of Srebrenica last week. UN
peacekeepers said many men were separated from their families. Refugees
allege they were then executed.
Mladic said on Wednesday that Zepa had surrendered, a claim that
proved to be premature, and invited UN officials to monitor the
evacuation of women, children, elderly, and wounded on Thursday.
Mladic waited outside Zepa with UN officials and 60 buses throughout
the day but the evacuation never began.
''Once the discrepancy in numbers arose I think the Bosnian government
decided it would be smart to wait and see what comes out of the meeting
in London today,'' the UN official said.
UN officials believe Zepa's defenders have little chance of holding
out against the heavily armed Serb forces. -- Reuter

THOSE who didn't pass the sixties or seventies in a transcendental
haze and a pair of purple bell-bottoms will know that there never was
any such thing as free love. Certainly not in the housing schemes.
Working-class sexual mores never did quite cop on to Timothy Leary.
There was invariably a price to pay. It was paid most often by wee
girls who ''fell pregnant'', a linguistically revealing euphemism: they
were not called fallen women, just fat slag or wee hairy.
You needed an engagement ring to book an appointment at the Family
Planning Clinic. They were sometimes bought in Woolies' but the
knuckle-sized diamond, or the curtain ring, usually failed to fake it
convincingly enough for the Eton-cropped doctors whose grey whiskers
trembled in indignation at the idea of doling out pills to someone who
should have been exercising on the hockey field, not in bus shelters.
None but the bravest or daftest ever took the risk. Only one of my
school friends got pregnant. She wasn't fat, a slag, or hairy. But she
was gullible. She thought everyone else was at it. They weren't. She was
just naive enough to believe her boyfriend. She was married, in a
bulging fawn mini-skirt, to a boy with freckles and a faint ginger down
on his upper lip.
We used to watch her push a pram past the school in the slow trudge of
her days while the rest of us were conjugating Latin verbs. From the
vantage point of a fourth-floor comprehensive classroom, it may have
looked the more enviable position. For about five minutes.
Fear of getting pregnant, then, was only mildly more terrifying than
the prospect of getting a bad name and ending up as a labeller in the
bottle factory.
Our downstair's neighbour had a daughter who became pregnant and kept
the baby. That was rare, then: ''She's not a bad girl,'' her mother
would smile in apology. ''It's the bad girls who don't get caught.'' It
was a common theme. She didn't say anything when a second baby arrived.
You might take from this an element of nostalgia, an argument that the
proliferation of contraceptive advice has encouraged more teenagers to
become sexually active. That the impoverishment of lives blighted by
teenage pregnancy began with the Pill. You might. You would be wrong.
For a look at the figures will disclose just the opposite.
In 1970 the conception rate per thousand births among young women aged
between 15 and 19 was 82.4%. In 1983 the figure had fallen to 56%. By
1991 it was up on the rise again to 65%. So the wider availability of
birth control has prevented pregnancies, not caused them to rise. The
crass notion that you can prevent teenage pregnancies by telling them to
keep their legs crossed is absurd. As studies from the Netherlands have
shown, the more information you give young people about sex, its
pleasures and its consequences, the more information you provide about
contraception within a detailed sex-education programme, the later it
will be before they embark on sexual relationships.
There is more evidence, if it's needed, to counter the fallacy that
sexual intercourse began in 1964: the biggest drop in the age of first
sexual activity occurred during the fifties, that dreary decade. Today,
despite the bragging, four out of five young people will not have
intercourse before their sixteenth birthday.
Next week the Joseph Rowntree Foundation will publish its latest
research on teenage pregnancies. It's to be hoped it helps counter some
of the dangerous misconceptions that inform social policy, not least
that hordes of randy teenage girls are doing it up windswept alleys to
get the rent book for a multi-storey flat.
The admonition to my generation then was not to ''ruin your life'':
another euphemism for risking pregnancy too young. Implicit in it was a
recognition that there was more out there, much more to life, than
having a baby, getting married, and playing at houses. Those of us lucky
enough to grow up in a time of hope go on believing that. None of us
expected any less than a good job and the chance of a better life.
Irene's something big in conference organising after travelling the
world: Annette took her degree and computer skills to Australia: I am
here: Maureen is a grandmother.
Our sense of self-worth was nurtured by a hopeful society. If the
Rowntree report does anything, perhaps it will expose the cruellest
reality of all: that you can't be ruined by falling pregnant when your
horizons are shrunk to four walls and a cot offering a reason for
living.

* HANDS up anyone who doesn't have some rough, neglected ground or
even a whole garden answering to that description. So what can we do
with it? Make a wild flower meadow is one answer.
The people at British Seed Houses have come up with a seed mixture
that can create what they describe as an area of natural beauty, much
more attractive than that rough neglected bit we try to hide from the
neighbours.
Instead, we can look forward to around a dozen different species with
fine grasses, the very thing to encourage birds, butterflies and
insects. And it won't need too much in the way of maintenance, feeding,
or weeding.
Seed time can be anything from May to October. Grasses come up in two
or three weeks, the wild flowers take their own time. This meadow lawn
range includes oxeye daisy, cowslip, wild pansy, musk mallow and self
heal.
Prices? Around #13 for 500g or enough to cover 25 sq m. Half that
comes in at around #7. Try your local garden centre.

IF it was true that Damon Hill ''knew Schumacher would have to go in
for a second time'' presumably to refuel, as James Traynor suggests, I
doubt if Hill would have made the desperate attempt he did to overtake
(July 17).
He would merely have tailed Schumacher knowing he had an advantage of
approximately 30 seconds.
James Traynor is at odds with the BBC commentators Messrs Walker and
Palmer and even Schumacher himself who admitted in his post-race
interview that the cars were equal on fuel.

From MARK HEINRICH in Zagreb
FOUR boys were killed and more than 30 people wounded in Serb
artillery and missile attacks on the north-west Bosnian Bihac enclave
yesterday, Bosnian radio said.
The casualty toll was not confirmed by peacekeepers but the UN said it
was alarmed by a Serb offensive on the Muslim enclave. Croatia has
threatened military intervention should Bihac look like falling.
Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic claimed thousands of Croatian
Serb troops including a unit of special forces had assembled along the
enclave's western confrontation line.
''The Serbs are playing cat and mouse while the whole world looks
towards Gorazde and Zepa,'' he said in Sarajevo, referring to two UN
''safe areas'' in eastern Bosnia.
''The Serbs are trying to take Bihac. It's so strange they're (the
world) talking about Gorazde.''
Krajina Serbs invading from rebel-held parts of Croatia have advanced
around two miles along a nine-mile front into the north-west part of
Bihac along a key supply road, putting 1000 or more inhabitants to
flight.
The Krajina Serb assault may presage a pincer offensive with Bosnian
Serbs from the east to crush the enclave, which would dash Croatia's
chances of retaking its own Serb-held territory with the help of Bosnian
Government forces in Bihac.
''The scale of the offensive is very worrying,'' said Chris Gunness, a
UN peacekeeping force spokesman.
''We've seen statements from the Croatian side about the possibility
of military intervention if we see a continued onslaught against Bihac.
We urge restraint on all sides,'' he said at the UN's mission base in
Zagreb.
Colonel Jasper Helsoe, UN spokesman in the pocket, said Krajina Serb
tank, artillery, and infantry units backed by renegade Muslim militiamen
appeared to have taken 20 square miles of terrain in fighting on
Wednesday.
Croatia warned the UN Security Council it would unleash its army to
uphold Bihac if the northwestern enclave, part of which is a UN ''safe
area'', seemed to be collapsing.
A Croatian army strike on Bihac's behalf would mean smashing 30 miles
through rebel-held Krajina after breaching UN ceasefire lines near the
Adriatic coast.
UN observers regard the situation as volatile because Croatian troops
have been spoiling for a knockout blow against the Krajina Serbs after
retaking a small rebel pocket in central Croatia two months ago.
Bosnian Croat allies of the Croatian army have been ploughing north
along the mountain border with Croatia to squeeze Krajina Serb supply
lines to Bosnian Serb territory.
If the Bosnian Croats could isolate the Krajina Serbs, helped by
Bosnian troops holding firm in Bihac or infiltrating southward, the
stage would be set for a Croatian army blitz on the main Croatian Serb
enclave this autumn.
A Serb conquest of Bihac, a hardy pocket of 180,000 Muslims sitting
between self-proclaimed Serb states in Bosnia and Croatia, could unravel
Zagreb's strategy to retake the Krajina Serb ''capital'' Knin and its
hinterland.
Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic wrote to the Security Council on
Thursday saying a Serb triumph and expulsion of Bihac's population would
jeopardise Croatian security.
''Any threat to the viability of the northwestern Bosnian Bihac safe
haven would inevitably force Croatia to take measures for (Bihac's)
protection,'' Granic wrote.
Refugees fled on foot or on tractors from the western gateway villages
of Sturlic and Trazacka Rastela, which were overrun by Krajina Serb
forces, the International Committee of the Red Cross said. War
casualties were pouring into local hospitals, it added.

SIR Richard Greenbury, whose committee of eminent business leaders
reported on Monday on the contentious issue of executive pay, has caused
consternation by his highly publicised U-turn on share options. The
incident is particularly embarrassing to the Chancellor of the Exchequer
Kenneth Clarke, who thought he had acted with commendable speed in
carrying out the committee's wishes. His pre-breakfast announcement that
profits on executive share option schemes were to be taxed as income,
instead of capital gains, backfired almost immediately. No sooner had
tax experts studied the Inland Revenue's press release than it became
clear that tens of thousands of beneficiaries of such schemes would be
more seriously disadvantaged than the highly rewarded directors of
privatised companies at whom the measure was aimed. The incident
provides a sorry reflection on public life in Britain. As a nation we
are unrivalled in our criticisms of the existing order, but lacking in
the expertise to set matters right. On this occasion it would appear
that none of the advocates of the proposed change had done their
homework -- not the members of the Greenbury Committee, where it has
emerged belatedly there was a difference of opinion, and certainly not
the Chancellor of the Exchequer or the Inland Revenue, who must carry
the can for policy mistakes.
Two problems have arisen with the new tax regime, which was put into
immediate effect to forestall evasive action once the contents of the
Greenbury report had been published. First, the Chancellor has hit the
wrong target. Power chiefs with salaries reading like telephone numbers
and hundreds of thousands of pounds of share options (most of which seem
to have been realised before the change of rules) are hardly going to
shed copious tears now that they are unable to offset their profits
against their annual capital gains allowances of #6000. Most share
option schemes offer much more modest rewards, not least those available
to the Asda check-out staff. The vast majority of the beneficiaries will
be liable to disproportionately larger amounts of tax as a result of
profits from such schemes being treated as income.
Second, a liability to income tax will arise when the share options
are exercised and converted into shares. Under the old regime there was
no liability to capital gains tax until the shares had been sold. In
many cases the new rules are likely to result in the shares being sold
to meet the tax demand. Public policy should instead be encouraging
directors and staff to hold on to the shares they have acquired under
option schemes. The situation is even worse where options have been
granted in shares which are not quoted on the stock market and in many
cases cannot be sold. Moreover the new regime applies to existing
schemes, which have a maximum life of 10 years. In that sense the
intended legislation is retrospective.
The Chancellor's initial reaction to the growing clamour among MPs,
businessmen, and accountants, has been to stick to his guns. It is true
that there are other types of share scheme which remain tax-free, but it
is too late for companies to switch horse in mid-course. Fortunately
Clarke requires Parliament's consent for the enabling legislation which
will form part of next year's Finance Bill. One obvious concession for
the Chancellor to make would be to arrange for the income tax liability
to be deferred until shares are sold. There should also be an exemption
limit below which share options will not suffer liability to income tax.
If necessary this concession could have a limited life. He has plenty of
time in the run-up to his Budget in November to prepare carefully
thought out changes to his original proposals. Meanwhile one irony of
the affair has been that attention has been diverted from the other
recommendations of the Greenbury Committee which are more likely to
check executive pay abuse in the future.

* BEFORE she moved to her flat in Pollokshields, Stella Berman had
over an acre of garden. Now her tiny front patch is little more than a
border, yet it looks as if all the plants that once filled her former
garden have somehow been crammed into it.
The miniature flower beds, barely six-feet wide, are edged with stone,
there are tiny steps and even a little crazy paving path along its
length.
Stella has even managed to include two dwarf trees, a magnolia, and a
weeping cherry, both in full bloom in the spring.
''I just trim the cherry at the top to make sure it 'weeps' and
doesn't go up too straight,'' she says.
Below the trees are tulips and daffodils with wallflowers, lobelia and
heather. Waiting to burst into flower are big, jolly red poppies, a
paeony, liliums and two clematis -- a Nelly Moser and a Montana.
There is also a beautiful pink camelia that is clearly thriving even
though Stella nevers covers it in winter.
She has a brilliant pieris formosa, its pale-green foliage splashed
with vivid red leaves. Saxifrage, pinks, primulas and lupins cover the
beds, while a clump of crocosmea will have red flowers later in the
year. A lavender leans over the front wall, and at one end sits a
rhododendron bush. On the front of the flats, her Montana clematis is a
landmark.
''It came as a tiny cutting from my old garden,'' says Stella, ''now
it must have climbed 30 ft up the drainpipe to the top flat''.
But when Stella first moved in over 20 years ago, there was nothing
but weeds at the front of the flat.
''I cleared the weeds and then built up the beds with bags of topsoil.
I edged them in stone and made the path by breaking up more stone. I
used a hammer and worked out in the front road. People were laughing at
me, I remember. Now I just give the beds a dressing of peat and
fertilizer each season.''
But the neighbours all admire the result.
Now that her spring flowers are finished, she's putting out dahlias,
and her roses will also be coming into bloom. As well as small shrub
roses, there is a large climbing rose at the back of the plot.
Stella works as an optical representative and travels all over
Scotland, but she admits she cannot pass a garden centre without calling
in.
''If I see a plant I haven't got, I just have to buy it, the problem
is finding somewhere to put it,'' she says.
Now she is solving her lack of space by planting up the verge across
the road, which has always been neglected, with just trees and bushes
for cover. And at the back of her flat the shared garden is full of
plants, thanks to Stella.
''My upstairs neighbour made a rockery last week and I am planting it
up,'' she says.
Clearly she is the sort of gardener who just loves to see things
growing and flourishing, no matter who owns the patch of soil. And the
result of her enthusiasm and effort is that everyone around benefits.

Nick Dekker speculates on what might have happened had Scots been less
faint-hearted in the 1974 election, not so 'cynically outmanoeuvred' in
the 1978 referendum, and had taken control of the oil revenues.
ABOUT 20 years ago there was a TV programme on which the programme
host, before revealing what the contestant had actually won, used to
announce: ''First, let's see what you turned down.''
Twenty years ago also, in 1975, the first North Sea oil came ashore
from the Forties field, by pipeline, to the Scottish mainland.
At that time I was active in the Scottish National Party, particularly
with regard to energy matters, and produced a little booklet in 1973
called The Reality of Scotland's Oil. This was part of the SNP's
Scottish Oil Campaign which culminated in the party winning 11 seats at
the General Election in the autumn of 1974.
Just one month after that election I resigned as a lecturer at
Strathclyde University to work in the Middle East. I have spent most of
the intervening period since 1974 continuing to work there, mainly in
Abu Dhabi, the richest of the emirates. I have returned regularly to
Scotland over these two decades. My observations on what has happened in
both Abu Dhabi and Scotland have caused me recently to ponder on what I
wrote in my booklet and to reflect on ''what might have been''. What did
Scotland turn down in 1974 and what lessons are there for Scotland
today?
In the introduction to my booklet I said: ''. . . without independence
the bulk of oil-based benefits will pass Scotland by and Scotland's
share of the wealth produced will provide only a temporary diversion.''
Essentially the message of the SNP's oil campaign had been that the
financial rewards from the discovery of oil in the North Sea would
accrue only to whoever controlled it politically, ie, the real financial
prize was going to be the oil revenues paid to the Government; by
comparison, the promised ''benefits'' of a predictable limited number of
insecure, relatively low-tech jobs as welders, steel erectors, clerks,
supply boat operatives, and so on, could at best equal only a fraction
of the oil production costs, and the production costs were only a
fraction of the full value of the oil.
To date the oil revenues collected by the Thatcher/Major Tory
Governments have exceeded #100bn, and we all know how fleeting and
insecure the employment benefits proved, and are still proving, to be.
Scotland was left to take its turn in the job queue like the rest of the
UK, and there have probably been more good-quality North Sea oil-related
jobs generated in London than in Scotland, despite what they say about
Aberdeen.
It is important to appreciate that the SNP's oil campaign in the 70s
has to be seen in the Scottish political context of the time,
particularly with regard to the predicament of the SNP in arguing its
case for independence. Prior to the discovery of oil the main and most
difficult issue faced by the SNP had been the question posed by the
Unionists on the economic viability of an independent Scotland. In the
late 1960s this question had been discussed at length and various
attempts had been made by ''interested parties'' to produce some sort of
Scottish budget. The problem was that accurate Scottish statistics on
many of the main elements of such a budget simply did not exist, and
resort had to be made to ''best guestimates'', eg, ''guess'' how much a
Scottish Government would spend on defence compared with our present
allocated proportionate share of the known British defence expenditure.
In 1969, conveniently on the eve of a vital Scottish by-election in
Glasgow Gorbals, the Labour Government produced a Scottish budget White
Paper. This ''proved'' that an independent Scotland would run a budget
deficit of several hundred million pounds. The SNP rightly disputed a
number of the ''guestimates'', but serious damage was done to its
economic case, and the Labour Party won the by-election.
The emergence of the oil card in the early 70s, in the shape of the
Oil Campaign, thus enabled the SNP almost irrefutably to claim the
economic viability of an independent Scotland. A principal weakness in
its case was removed.
However the SNP's efforts to publicise the economic realities of the
oil discoveries were loudly and vigorously attacked in the press by the
then Conservative administration at Westminster. It is now common
knowlege that the Conservative Government of the early 70s had proved to
be totally inept in its handling of the early oil boom and had been
given the run-around by the oil companies. Inept or not, it accused the
SNP of ''plucking figures from the air''.
Today, informed commentators reviewing the 1970s Scottish political
scene recognise that it was the SNP which had its sums right, but the
then Unionist-orientated Scottish press succeeded in intimidating many
Scots by emphasising that since it was mainly the Americans who were
drilling and finding the oil, we, the Scots should be grateful; that the
Scots would get lots of jobs from all the money the generous oil
companies were risking to spend on developing the oil fields, and again
we should be thankful; and, anyway, one day the oil would run out and
where would we be then without London Government to continue to
subsidise us. The election of a Labour Government to Westminster in 1974
did not change these tactics, which were intended to discredit the SNP's
claims and remove the danger to the British economy if Scotland became
independent.
However, the presence of the 11 SNP MPs at Westminster (after polling
over 30% of the votes at the 1974 election) was a serious reminder that
what was needed to ''save the Union'' was more than just rhetoric. It
was recognised that only the quirks of our first-past-the-post electoral
system had kept the SNP's representation at Westminster to a containable
proportion. Next time, if nothing were done, the electoral system might
work in the SNP's favour.
It is interesting to cast our mind back now to that time and to
speculate what might have happened if the Scots had been a bit less
timid and the SNP had gained, say, just five percentage points more in
that 1974 election. Its seat count would probably have reached over 30;
and it is almost certain that Scotland would have been spared ''the
Thatcher Years''.
As it was, however, the presence of the 11 SNP MPs forced the Labour
Government to introduce the Scotland Bill and proceed to the referendum
in 1978. In this exercise the Scottish aspirations for even a modicum of
devolution were cynically outmanoeuvred, and the result is a sad blot in
our recent history, so easily were we fooled.
Ironically I observed these events in Scotland from oil-rich Abu
Dhabi. In the 20 years since, I have lived and worked in Abu Dhabi and
have witnessed and been involved in the amazing transformation of the
UAE -- all fuelled by oil wealth.
The ruler of Abu Dhabi, HH Sheikh Zayed, who before the discovery of
oil had presided over a large, relatively impoverished piece of desert
populated by some tens of thousands of simple bedu, had no doubts about
who should benefit from the oil discovered under the sands of Abu Dhabi.
No-one informed him that he should be grateful to the foreigners for
finding the oil, and should accept a few crumbs. No-one warned him about
what would become of Abu Dhabi when the oil ran out. He quickly learned
that since he was the ruler he controlled the oil and the oil revenues.
And he has set about developing the oil, and Abu Dhabi, with maximum
control exercised by Abu Dhabians.
As a result, Abu Dhabi now styles itself ''the most modern city in the
Middle East''. Today it is a city and emirate that Abu Dhabians can be
proud of, and the many Scots who have worked there to help build it will
testify to that. It is a testament not only to oil wealth, but to the
tolerant leadership provided by HH Sheikh Zayed.
Sadly, that phrase identifies what Scotland most lacks in the present
UK constitutional arrangement. Within this single centralising supreme
legislature in London, with UK-wide political parties, the Scots are
easily divided on constitutional matters affecting Scotland. Without the
sort of regional assembly which even the many constituent parts of the
old Soviet Union had, the Scots lack a focus for leadership they can all
rally behind on purely Scottish matters to ensure their wishes are
respected. In the past 20 years we have twice had Scottish local
government reorganisation thrust upon us against our wishes, not to
mention the poll tax.
Thus, while Abu Dhabi has developed, contrast this with Scotland.
Since 1975 we have produced almost 1000m tons of oil and gas worth
about #200bn. An amazing bounty. But even after all this wealth can we
claim that we have dramatically improved the lot of the Scots? Can we
look around Scotland and say ''these are the achievements paid for by
the windfall of North Sea oil''. Where are the ''monuments'' to
Scotland's oil era comparable to the legacy of the many impressive
institutions and fine public buildings passed on to us from our previous
industrial era?
In assessing the Scottish situation today, there is to my mind one
statistic which best illustrates what our sorry condition has been for
decades. That statistic is that Scotland's present population is almost
the same as it was 50 years ago; and yet we still have serious
unemployment, bad housing, and many of the other social problems which
in most countries are exacerbated by continued population growth. This
is a vital indicator whose significance is rarely discussed in Scotland.
A static population level over 50 years may be a unique record for
Scotland, but it does not arise from sociological reasons of which we
can be proud. It arises mainly because, as the Scottish economy has
failed to provide job opportunities, Scots have been forced to leave
Scotland to seek employment.
In one year in the 1960s the net emigration (difference between the
numbers leaving and entering Scotland) reached almost 1% of the
population. The main significance of emigration, however, is not just in
the raw numbers -- how many left etc, it is on the type and quality of
those who left and those who entered, and the long-term consequence of
such a continued flow. There is a PhD there for someone. The oil years
since 1975, with all its promises, did not eliminate the flow, and even
today we are still losing some of our best young people.
North Sea oil will continue to be an important economic asset to
Scotland for several decades, but Scotland, of course, cannot go back to
1975. The past 20 years are behind us, but must surely be a lesson. The
UK political environment in 1995 is also very different, with the
European Union the dominant constitutional issue in the UK. The fact
remains that with the SNP again attracting significant support, Scotland
has a serious choice to make regarding its political future.
Scotland's place in both the UK and Europe is an important issue that
must be addressed (although the level of the debate in Scotland at
present, particularly from the Tory party, is pretty dismal).
Like more and more Scots I resent being told by this Tory Government
that, on the one hand, independence would be economically disastrous,
ie, we are lucky to have a generous neighbour continually to subsidise
us, and on the other hand, its refusal to allow Scotland the slightest
opportunity to get rid of that accusation of dependency. As in so many
of these political arguments about Scotland's situation, we cannot win.
Some even argued that the oil wealth would be bad for us.
So we can stay in the UK and have more of the same, or we can choose
to leave and forge our own future as a full member state of the European
Union. For, like the SNP, I have no doubt that our best interests lie in
Europe rather than out.
Independence in Europe would actually give Scotland a great deal more
control over our own affairs than we have at present. Being a relatively
small, socially cohesive country, we can, even inside the EU, be
innovative and economically nimble. We shall be able to influence our
economic and social priorities and determine such important matters as
defence and education spending. We would have no truck with nuclear
weapons on our soil.
In an article I read recently a Native American tribal leader, in
making a plea to the US Government for more control of tribal affairs,
said: ''If we fail, we fail on our own. And if we succeed, we don't have
to be grateful to anyone.''
In a way this sentiment applies also to us. In the Union we are
somehow always made to feel we should be grateful. If we try to raise
legitimate concerns we are accused of whingeing.
Thirty years ago I made my decision. And like more and more Scots
today, I have no doubt that if we do make the choice for independence in
Europe, we shall succeed and our children and grandchildren will look
back and wonder why we took so long.

A SCOTS boy has sold hundreds of pounds worth of toys for just #30 to
help children in Bosnia.
Joseph Lawson, 11, of Nevis Avenue, Hamilton, was horrified when
watched the suffering of children on the television.
He set up shop in the garage at his home yesterday morning, and was
sold out in less than an hour.
His mother, Margaret, said last night: ''He came in and asked us 'do
you mind if I have a jumble sale?'
''I thought it was a lovely thing to do but I nearly had a fit when I
saw these toys that had cost us so much money were being sold for 10p.
''He soon persuaded us that it was better the money was sent to
children who were in real need.''
Locals queued around the block to snap up bargains such as a #90
scooter for just #4, and wrestling figures for #1 each. The money will
be donated to Edinburgh Direct Aid.
Joseph said: ''I saw the children on TV dressed in rags and looking
really unhappy and decided I would like to help them.''
Aid worker Alan Whitcutt said: ''It's very touching that a wee boy
would sell all his toys. Every penny he has given to Edinburgh Direct
Aid will be used for buying medical equipment and toys for children.
''The situation in Bosnia is horrific. Children are being kept in
hospitals where they are crammed into tiny cots, using woollen jumpers
for nappies because they are so thin on the ground.
''What young Joseph has done lets you see there's still hope for the
human race yet.''

IT was a typical Saturday night: the lads were due imminently, and I
was doing the usual basic pre-visitor household chores. I'd rubbed the
crayon from the windows, blow-torched Weetabix from the telly, and
generally tried to make the place look less a depressing enclosure in a
poor zoo.
The doorbell rang and, expecting to greet the lads, I went to the
door, duster in hand, and a nice line in self-deprecatory banter at the
ready. When I get to the door, there are no lads, just a young bloke
collecting for some medical research. At some point in the past I'd
apparently agreed to be the subject of a monthly scam, sorry, agreed to
buy an overpriced magazine every month in aid of this research. I was
already pissed off at having my inability to say no demonstrated in such
an expensive fashion and I grudgingly gave him the money. In a nutshell,
within five minutes I'd forked out #4.50 -- #4.50 in one night! That's
three beers!
I was by this point miffed, and as usual the subsequent rant was all
the more impassioned because I'd failed to direct my anger at the
source; failed even to tell him not to bother coming back: #4.50! What
do I care about this bloody research? But it was too late to moan. The
boy was off down the road, my fiver in his tin, while I was stuck in the
house with two dire rags tedious enough to make the People's Friend look
like Viz.
Ten minutes later I had just about calmed down. The doorbell went
again. The lads on time for a change? No, it was a door-to-door salesman
of the sort that, having sussed out all the middle-class liberal houses
in a neighbourhood, pester them on a weekly basis to buy cruddy
household goods that they don't need. The door was hardly open when he
started his spiel, careful not to allow any pauses for breath into which
a potential mug, er, customer, could insert a No thanks not tonight.
''Good evening sir, my name's Thomas, I'm going round the area selling
household goods to create jobs for the unemployed . . . (as if the
employed need jobs created) . . . in Glasgow. I've got a few things
that'll take no more than 10 seconds of your time to show you we've got
the . . . (crouches down to bag, helpfully lifting each item in turn) .
. . 10 heavy duty dishcloths good for wiping things up, your handy big
torch has its own batteries, your 10 ironing board covers with metallic
lining . . .'' Now he's stinking of beer, and he's got a slightly glazed
look about him, and for some reason that's annoyed me.
Despite my irritation, the one word that's echoing through my brain is
''unemployed''. Eventually, I close the door, feeling a combination of
relief that I'm only down another fiver, and anger that I couldn't say
no. In my hand I have a Big Wipe-Eezee which is apparently ''handy for
wiping the car windows inside and out''. Why couldn't I just suggest he
comes back at another time?
It doesn't make me feel better that there's yet another tick against
me in the National Register of Wimps And Simps. I felt used, and I felt
stupid. These charities certainly know how to put gullible dorks like me
in an impossible position.
It used to be a cinch dealing with it when charity meant one annual
street collection. I had street-wise guidelines to make sure I gave
selectively. In general, I gave money to all charities except those:
* with the word ''Church'' in the title. If they have to say Church,
then they're desperate 99% of the time they're not real churches,
they're called something like the Church Of The Seventh Happiness, i.e.
in all likelihood a front for nutters who believe that Rolf Harris is
God.
* that consist of baldy blokes with empty eyes. They might talk about
youth clubs, but to them ping-pong is probably a made-up chanting
ritual.
* that have anything to do with any species of animal, particularly
domestic ones. If God had meant animals to have charities, he would have
made Adam a social worker. These causes are particularly futile. If you
help some bunch of do-gooders protect tigers then, sooner or later,
you'll have another set of do-gooders collecting money to save antelopes
from the unnaturally large tiger population. Before you know it you've
got one set of saddoes giving tigers bullet-proof vests, while another
set is forking out for the hunters to get armour-piercing bullets.
Anyway, everyone knows that animal charities only ever concern
themselves with species that are either handsome or cute, hence why the
Professional Footballers Association has such singularly unsuccessful
flag days.
* with anything to do with art. Only bad art ever needs charity to
sustain it. Neither Baywatch nor the Mona Lisa has ever needed any of my
money. Point proven.
Of late, however, my ground rules have become useless. The past 10
years have seen all sorts of charity becoming more aggressive, and the
result is that I'm now paying wads of money to causes I couldn't care
care less about. In the nineties, collecting methods have changed and
the onus is now on the public to say no. You don't approach charities
any more, they approach you, whether it's the smug woman collecting
Christian Aid envelopes (''I left it here two days ago'' -- is code for
''Come off it heathen, you've had plenty of time''), the Big Issue
vendor cursing you when you refuse, or the pushy bloke on the phone
wanting to know why exactly you can't deliver envelopes for their
children's charity.
They claim that this strident approach is all the more necessary since
the lottery is depriving them of funds. Now they're all feeling the
pinch. To try to illustrate this, the TV news dragged out some guy who
was ''bitterly disappointed'' that some animal charity has had a drop in
donations since November. Now that's the kind of good news that should
be making headlines! Why have all these cats sitting around looking
haughty without performing any useful function -- that's what we keep
the monarchy for.
Most charities don't do themselves any favours with the moral high
ground approach. While they whinge because we spend money on luxuries
like clothes and food, rather than keeping three-legged diabetic donkeys
alive, you'd think that they were all sweetness and light. At least I
did, until I saw this week's report that many charities have millions of
pounds worth of shares invested in companies involved with the British
arms industry. Think about that when someone comes to you with a smug
smile and a rattling charity can.
Looking at the Live Aid highlights the other night, it's too easy to
highlight the paradoxes. I remember the day very well. I watched
self-obsessed, introspective coke-heads telling me to be more selfless.
I saw lads in pubs, drunk on 20 quid's worth of beer, tearfully donate
#2 when that video came on, genuinely believing they'd helped. For all
my retro-cynicism, though, Live Aid undoubtedly changed thousands of
African lives for the better. It is the ultimate example of how good,
old-fashioned, speak-when-you're-spoken-to charity can triumph.
One thing, though. For all my vivid memories of Live Aid, I don't
remember once picking up the phone and pledging any money.

PARLIAMENTARY RECESS.
AT 11.25 on Wednesday night the House of Commons rose for its summer
recess. Barely 12 hours later the first of the summer round of party
press conferences opened, proving that whatever the cynics may say about
one of the world's longest holiday entitlements, MPs cannot escape the
reality of modern politics: there is no such thing as a break at
Westminster.
This does not stop the rougher end of the media from indulging in a
bit of baiting. On Thursday the Sun published a photograph of the
Commons, with the caption, ''Just thought you'd like to know folks . . .
our 650 MPs start their hols today . . . they won't be back until
OCTOBER 16''.
Such are the little inconsistencies that crop up between the
temptation to ridicule our elected representatives for their 80-plus-day
holiday, and the reality of a system that barely allows them to escape
for a fortnight without portable telephone, fax, and the ubiquitous
pager. British politics has become a 365-day-a-year affair.
But that doesn't stop the summer recess from happening. In the Palace
of Westminster the change-over has begun. The MPs retreat to their
offices and constituencies while an army of workmen move in. Floorboards
are ripped up, walls painted, furniture moved, your tax money spent on
new carpets, all in Parliament's own version of a spring clean.
The refurbishment work is considered one of London's most successful
job creation schemes, and is widely credited with keeping the building
trade in profit and pilfered fax machines.
The only ones who remain are Her Majesty's Press. Up in the press
gallery journalists throw away unread committee reports, take slightly
longer lunches, and conspire to keep the political news treadmill going
just enough to satisfy their editors.
Throughout Westminster the beginning of that long empty stretch to the
autumn party conferences produces an instinctive sigh of relief, even if
the tempo of activity no longer slows in the way it did 50 or even five
years ago.
Over at the Red Lion pub, in the shadow of Big Ben, the landlord
claims to know exactly when the recess has begun when he no longer has
to restock the condom machine.
The beginning of the summer recess is a ritual. Ministers clear their
desks, Government departments produce last-minute figures, Select
Committees rush out reports in an avalanche of information that
threatens to completely clog the systems of government. On Wednesday
night alone the Government released 776 written answers (it's usually
less than 200).
Journalists were left to sift through these reams of paper in search
of an unexpected story: ministers like to sneak out potentially
unpopular measures when they think everyone is distracted by thoughts of
holiday.
So what is the summer recess? Technically, the House is only adjourned
until October, when it returns for what is known as the spill-over
session to finish up the year's Parliamentary business: Bills that
aren't finished by then are dropped. Then Parliament is prorogued, or
suspended, until the Queen's speech, usually in November.
Adjournment, rather than prorogation, allows the Commons to be
recalled at short notice in the event of a sudden crisis requiring
debate. The last time MPs had their summer holidays interrupted was in
1992, when they returned to discuss the consequences of Britain's
ejection from the Exchange Rate Mechanism and the crisis in Yugoslavia.
Other recalls mark world events and British disasters with monotonous
regularity: devaluation in 1949, the Korean War in 1950, Suez in 1956,
Northern Ireland in 1971.
In August 1968, MPs were recalled after the Soviet invasion of
Czechoslovakia. They stayed an extra day to discuss the civil war in
Nigeria and the Wilson Government's policy of supplying arms to the
Nigerian Government. The public gallery that day was filled with blacks,
who hissed throughout the debate. Usually anyone who causes a
disturbance or makes a noise in the gallery is thrown out. But the badge
messengers couldn't spot the culprits. So they threw out a middle-aged
white woman who shouted insults about Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian
Smith.
This Wednesday MPs left fully expecting to be recalled over Bosnia,
perhaps as soon as next week. It's already happened once this year.
Several have started a book offering odds on the likely date, and on the
first MP to call for the House to be summoned back.
Recent summers have produced enough news to convince Westminster it
should never close. In 1990 Iraq invaded Kuwait and kept politicians
rumbling all summer, but 1992 was the worst: MPs spent the recess
waiting for David Mellor to resign, then had to endure the confusion of
the ERM crisis and the collapse of Yugoslavia.
The summer recess wasn't always like this. In historical terms the
current three-month holiday is the shortest since Parliament came into
existence. Up until the eighteenth century six months was the norm.
Parliament would gather in October or November to hear the King's speech
-- ''remember, remember the fifth of November, gunpowder, treason and
plot'' -- and sit until the spring. In the eighteenth century the
sittings began to stretch into May, and by the nineteenth the date of
rising had slipped back to August.
This began to grate on those members who felt their summers were being
encroached upon. In 1858 Mr Charles Forster appealed for reform by
reminding his colleagues that the House had traditionally risen before
the King's birthday in June.
Sitting ''under the influence of a July sun, . . . measures often left
the House in a crude and imperfect state'', he said. That summer proved
his point. Record temperatures cooked the raw sewage that filled the
Thames -- the river then was London's drain -- to produce what was known
as the Great Stink. The sitting MPs had to choose between suffocation by
heat or by smell. They compromised by hanging sheets soaked in bleach
over the Palace's windows.
Shortly afterwards the pre-Christmas session was dropped. The
parliamentary year began with the sovereign's speech in early February
and continued until about mid-August -- into but not throughout the
grouse and salmon season. It wasn't until 1928-9 that the Commons
reverted to autumn sittings, a practice that remains unchanged.
For most MPs the summer recess is an inconvenience. Margaret Ewing,
the SNP MP for Moray, has submitted proposals to the Committee on
Procedures which would transform the way MPs work. The Commons would sit
for three weeks out of four, year round, giving MPs a regular week to
get back to their constituencies and their families, and the work that
inevitably piles up while they are coping with legislation in the
Commons.
''I still don't understand why we have to have this huge bloody
recess. It seems obscene when we are not doing anything, when
correspondence keeps coming in,'' she says.
Not that holidays are unknown. The average seems to be a fortnight,
usually in late August. The Prime Minister, who until now has taken his
family to Spain, leaves for the south of France on Wednesday for two
weeks. Labour leader Tony Blair is also heading for France, and Italy,
for a little more than a fortnight. Shadow Scottish Secretary George
Robertson is away for three weeks touring New England. And East Fife MP
Henry McLeish is treating himself to a European rail holiday, with time
in Sienna thrown in.
Dennis Skinner, Labour MP, hero of the left and one of Westminster's
Incorruptibles, recalls the problems he had with the summer recess in
his first years as an MP.
There was a bus-stop outside his house from which the local miners
would set off for work. As a former miner he grew increasingly
uncomfortable with his colleagues seeing him doing nothing other than
weeding the garden. He took to hiding in the back. ''I was feeling
guilty, I was feeling embarrassed. That thing has bugged me ever
since,'' he says.
He began keeping himself busy by cycling around the constituency,
notebook in pocket, chatting to people. These days he is unhappy with
the length of the recess, and its timing. ''They ought to take into
account the holidays in Scotland in July. We should finish sooner, come
back earlier, and not be as long,'' he says.
Indeed, Scottish MPs with children are always anxious lest the rising
of the House slip back into August, forcing them to miss most of the
Scottish school holidays.
Margaret Thatcher used to hate the summer recess. She never took more
than a week off, before hurrying back to tackle the crisis she knew must
have developed in her absence. Bernard Ingham, her faithful press
secretary, says it was the only thing they did not agree on. Her
approach to holidays was hyperactive, partly through fear of losing
ground to the opposition through inactivity.
But holidays are for individuals. During the summer recess Government
continues to govern. Each department makes sure to keep a duty minister
in London at all times, ever since Edwina Currie's disappearance while
Health Minister caused havoc. Some ministers show signs of taking this
to an extreme.
Michael Heseltine, the Deputy Prime Minister, is said to be ready to
spend the entire summer in London transforming the Government's
fortunes. He chairs the Cabinet committee on presentation of Government
policy and his staff have let its members know that it will sit every
day throughout the recess. Michael Forsyth has threatened to do the
same, and has left the Scottish press in a state of breathless
anticipation at the mischief he is likely to produce.
The parties will keep up the steady flow of politics. The run-up to
the next election is underway. New Tory chairman Brian Mawhinney
announced he would be holding a series of press conferences during the
summer to attack Labour; Labour has published its campaign plans for the
recess, and promised a series of intiatives.
Above all, summer recess gives the Government a free run. For three
months it does not have to worry about answering difficult questions in
the Commons. It is, effectively, freed from the requirement of
accountability. Those like Dennis Skinner and London Labour MP Tony
Banks, who have two of the best attendance records in the Commons,
consider this the most dangerous by-product of the long holiday.
''Whatever they say about Question Time, about that rough and tumble,
the truth is you can every day, some way or other, force the Government
to reveal something they don't want,'' Skinner says. Banks agrees, and
sees a double advantage for the Government: ''What Major wants is us out
of his hair. Ministers want to get on with the job of manipulating
public opinion without the inconvenience of having to answer questions.
And they'll be bloody glad to get rid of their own backbenchers, who
cause them no end of trouble.''
Banks, Skinner, Ewing and most MPs will spend the recess dividing
their time between their Commons office -- if they are close to
Westminster -- and their constituency. Surgeries keep running,
correspondence needs to be addressed, and meetings continue.
The myth of the long, lazy holiday is not welcome. ''This is the sort
of vulgar prejudice that does so much to undermine the position of
Parliament. If as an MP you can go away for 13 weeks and leave your
constituency either you deserve to be kicked out or you are too damned
useless to care,'' Banks says.
Before the war politicians would never have dreamed of carrying on the
game of politics during the recess. Summer was for returning home, doing
a spot of shooting, reading a bit of Trollope, and forgetting about
those damned constituents.
Now we expect a full-time commitment from our representatives and we
complain when they go away -- remember Kenneth Clarke as Health
Secretary being forced to account for his holiday in Spain during the
ambulance strike. But let's not kid ourselves. Parliament's summer
recess is our holiday: fewer soundbites, fewer confrontations, fewer
politicians on the box.
The most important holiday of all.

Defence Correspondent Ian Bruce examines the difficulties of military
engagement in Bosnia and suggests a radical solution.
THE Serbs have always been two moves ahead in the chess game of
Bosnian power-politics. Three years of practice against an ineffective
opponent like the United Nations and 500 years of genetic conditioning
in Balkan double-dealing have made them grandmasters.
The West has never quite grasped the psychology of its opponent. Serbs
understand strength and military power. They despise weakness. The
subtler lessons of surgical bombing strikes are lost on a people steeped
in blood-feud and ethnic slaughter on a grand scale.
Even the passing of the baton of command in Bosnia from the UN to, in
effect, Nato will have little impact on a regime which has already
achieved most of its territorial goals in the face of international
condemnation and sanctions.
To defeat the latest proposals for a punitive allied bombing campaign,
all the Serbs have to do is curtail their own military operations until
autumn gives them the protective umbrella of cloud cover. Gorazde will
keep until Western willpower erodes and the fragile alliance of the US,
Britain, and France falls apart.
Despite laser-targeting and ''smart'' bombs, it remains one of the
immutable laws of war that a pilot cannot hit what he cannot see. Even
in perfect conditions only half of the precision-guided munitions
launched by US forces during the Gulf war actually struck their targets.
The successful strikes beamed to a news-hungry world painted a
distorted picture of hi-tech warfare in the interests of propaganda.
Bombs homing in on air vents or doorways at key target sites made it all
seem easy. But video-arcade accuracy is not a real-life option.
Nato has a formidable array of air power at its disposal. Much of it
is less than half an hour's flying time away from potential targets from
bases on Italy's Adriatic coast or carriers lying off Dalmatia.
However, as the Serbs have already demonstrated, any exercise of
aerial might would not be a one-way affair. The US recently lost an F16
to a Serb missile battery. The British lost a Sea Harrier to ground fire
a year ago.
The latest intelligence summaries credit the Serbs with a
highly-sophisticated anti-aircraft network linking radars to missiles
and rapid-fire cannon, the type of ''Triple-A'' weapons which downed
most of the six British Tornados during Desert Storm in 1991.
Enthusiasm for delivering high-explosive warnings by airmail is most
evident in Washington. It has the advantages of risking the least number
of service personnel in action while avoiding the commitment of ground
troops and the inevitable casualties that would entail.
On the eve of presidential election year Clinton cannot afford to
place Americans in the line of fire without good reason. The bodybag
factor is still a powerful argument on Capitol Hill for minimal
involvement in somebody else's war.
Britain has gone along with the air threat as a way of avoiding the
deployment of tens of thousands of scarce troops to a slogging match in
hostile terrain. Its lightly-equipped peacekeepers are already in harm's
way in Gorazde, isolated by distance and UN indecision from hope of
realistic aid if the Serbs decide to defy Nato and attack the enclave.
The French, with typical elan, favour helicoptering 1000 Foreign
Legionnaires into the besieged town to bolster its defences. Paris has
always been prepared to fight to the last drop of Legion blood in the
cause of national pride.
The problem in Bosnia is that any military engagement is governed by
supply routes. There are few major roads, mountainous country ideal for
ambush, and a plethora of vulnerable bridges. An isolated garrison such
as Gorazde could be cut off with ease. Without food, water, and
ammunition, its defenders end up peering over the shattered walls of the
Alamo, waiting impotently for the end.
The proponents of vertical envelopment, heli-borne infantry backed by
gunships, claim that re-supply could be carried out by air. But as the
ill-equipped Afghan Mujahideen proved to the Soviet Army, a handful of
shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles can play havoc with that theory.
Nato undoubtedly has the capacity to devastate attacking Serb units,
and seriously to inhibit their communications and movement from the air.
It should, however, be remembered that no-one ever won a war by air
power alone. Even the Gulf war had to be settled by the most powerful
ground assault ever mounted in the history of warfare.
The Serbs are far from stupid when it comes to waging war. Ratko
Mladic's forces in Bosnia number more than 80,000. Four years of almost
constant conflict have transformed them from ragtag militia into a
veteran army with a wealth of invaluable combat experience.
Allied statements in the past few days have verged on the gung-ho.
Reality would be less one-sided. The ''do something'' school of thought
appears to have triumphed in the meantime as a way of shoring up a
policy which has already failed.
The Serbs, contemptuous of Nato air threats, will probably test
Western determination with a deliberate provocation. If that brings a
firestorm down on their heads, they will back off, regroup, and bide
their time before striking back.
Time is on their side. The UN mission is ailing to the point of
collapse, and no-one has great enthusiasm for sending in the Marines and
taking sides in what would become a full-blown war.
There are also scores of vulnerable UN garrisons scattered across the
country in penny-packets at observation posts and tripwire defence
lines. The first allied bomb burst on a Serb armoured column might well
condemn them to death or captivity within hours.
It also begs the question of how firm US resolve would remain if crews
from downed American strike aircraft were captured, paraded before Serb
television cameras, and used as hostages, human shields, or even
executed as ''war criminals''. Balkan history is rich in revenge and big
on retaliation. US history is rich in pre-election panic.
Ironically, the discredited UN Secretary-General, Boutros
Boutros-Ghali, proposed the only sound military compromise more than a
year ago. He called on the UN military command to withdraw its men to
defensible areas in central Bosnia, protected by heavy weaponry, and in
control of the vital logistical routes back to the Croatian coast. The
move was rejected because it involved abandoning the ''safe havens'' in
the east, two of which have now fallen anyway, and displayed what would
be perceived by the Serbs as weakness.
Perhaps the only immediate solution for a rapid halt to Serb
aggression would be the elimination of Mladic himself. The Serbs have
few other competent senior officers. The ''Butcher of Bosnia'' is their
key player and top warlord.
He masterminded the Croatian campaign which resulted in Serb seizure
of a third of that country, and has moulded the Bosnian Serb army into a
powerful fighting force. He is also the architect of ethnic cleansing
and the prime mover for Greater Serbia.
Most Western governments would be publicly uncomfortable with the
notion of assassination as a means to a political end. It may, however,
be the sole route to a quick-fix diplomatic initiative. If the Serbs
attack anywhere, take out Mladic, his headquarters, and his staff. It is
an action which might even win the Balkan seal of approval.

* PLEASE settle a fierce argument between my husband and myself. He
dismisses as nonsense my claim that lawn mowings fly on to the flower
beds and root there. Cuttings don't root, he says. So where do all the
grass weeds come from?
* You are both partly right. Cuttings by themselves are unlikely to
root. However, you can be sure that they contain a fair number of seeds,
especially from annual meadowgrass. This is where the weeds come in.
* I READ in some magazines that one should always hoe the surface of
soil in hot weather, as a moisture conservation measure. It leaves a
layer of loose soil on top and prevents moisture being lost by
evaporation.
* There have been various experiments and these tend to show hoeing is
of no practical value for this purpose. The main value is to control
weeds, which can waste a great deal of soil moisture. Apart from that,
it makes the ground look neater and more attractive. A hoe would need to
be really sharp to be effective.

HE creeps up the side of the border and cuts across the lawn to the
pond. In the moonlight his coat looks dark but there's no mistaking the
stiff brush of his tail.
On previous visits he has stayed for a while after lowering his muzzle
to the water, grooming himself and foraging in the irises, meadowsweet,
and water avens which fringe the pond. But tonight there's things to do,
places to go, and he's soon loping off down the path. I keep my fingers
crossed for him.
Why do I use the superstitious sign for friend Reynard? The answer is
simple.
This pond and community meeting place is not in some rural retreat but
lies a stone's throw from Glasgow city boundary. During the morning and
evening rush the traffic is a steady stream of about 200 vehicles an
hour. Buses pass at regular intervals, and even at night there is a
constant passage of shift workers, works buses, police vehicles and
ambulances.
Plans have been passed to develop the ground opposite our house. This
will effectively cut off the fox's route between his den in a distant
stand of trees and the garden.
As day breaks, the blackbird is the first of the daytime callers. He's
also the last to retire at night, singing well after midnight. Now his
song has been replaced by a high-pitched piping. I hope that his mate
and two youngsters will join him, but they don't appear.It's not too
much of a disappointment for they make an appearance en famille each
evening.
His ablutions are now watched by three raucous starlings, jostling and
flailing each other on the wall. In our family they have been nicknamed
Scraggy Anns, and it suits them.
As soon as the blackie takes off on a low, water-spraying flight, they
descend and three turns into seven and then an entire flock, far too
many for the surface of the water. They're watched in turn by families
of sparrows, one of which is bravely fluttering in and out behind the
bullrushes, the robin which is nesting behind the greenhouse and a
solitary chaffinch. The phrase pecking order is clearly defined here.
The pond which, like most other features here wasn't designed, is a
nice piece of serendipity. When we first laid the lawn, the resultant
rubble and rocks were deposited in a rough heap on a tarred area under
the heading of ''What shall we do here?'' When a flash flood filled the
kidney-shaped depression, the answer was obvious.
Now eight years on, it has evolved out of all recognition. Only three
bullrushes and several aquatic plants were put in initially. Now there
are over seven species of water plants brought in by wind and birds,
including a highly evasive water mint which has the strongest scent
imaginable, and a clump of king cups which glow sun-like in a dark
corner.
Garden plants live well beside them -- lady's mantle, selfheal, true
geraniums and cultivated geums. This year two self-seeded teasels stand
sentinel, over six-feet tall.
The pond itself becomes overgrown quickly, but it's sometimes hard to
throw away the vegetation. Perhaps the old adage of getting your worst
enemy to prune your roses would be fitting in this case.
Colonisation of the water itself has been remarkable. In the beginning
there was -- nothing. The first contribution was a jar of tadpole spawn
which unbeknown, contained the eggs and fry of minnows and even one
pike, which developed and thrived for five years, growing to longer than
three inches. He was clearly recognisable by the marking and, of course,
the underslung jaw.
From the world of insects, pond-skaters were the first to appear,
moving at speed across the meniscus of the water. Then the water
beetles, shiny black gentlemen who ascend to the surface, take in enough
air to form a bubble on their rear-ends, and then return to the bottom.
Although we have had only a few ramshorn snails, the great pond snail,
multiplying at a rate which requires constant culling, provides constant
amusement.
Like Teutonic holidaymakers at the pool, they hog the surface of the
pond as soon as the temperature rises, floating idly on their backs and
dipping under from time to time, presumably to keep moist.
Dragonflies seldom call, which makes us feel all the more honoured by
their presence, but damsel flies are common in the summer, in
irridescent shades of steely blue and vibrant red. Wasps drink here,
dipping their tails into the water as they hover until they fly off,
sated. My feelings towards wasps are ambivalent as I know that, as in
previous years, I will have to call on the services of the gentlemen
from environmental health to fumigate a nest somewhere in the garden.
Borage, which has become a pest in recent years, albeit a beautiful
one, encourages all types of bees to the waterside, and last year I
counted 15 different species. The most spectacular was a very smart
character with scarlet trousers and a black velvet waistcoat, which I
heard might have been South American killer bees, killers of bees, that
is. It must be said that they were on their best behaviour.
Right at this moment there is a flurry and a harsh croak as the
resident magpie arrives. He has a very stylish routine, first stalking
up the wall with a stiff-legged gait, like a clockwork toy, then hopping
on to the same moss-covered stone. He then moves to the little gravel
shore which has been created as a safety measure for hedgehogs and other
nocturnal guests.
With the delicacy of a little old lady paddling at Troon, he dips
first one foot then the other, as though testing the temperature, before
settling down in the water with his wonderful feathers plumped out
around him. Seen head-on, he looks like a duck. As he has already
beheaded two starlings, destroyed the first nest of blackbirds and
terrorised a squadron of blue tits on each of their twice-daily sorties,
I am fearful for the three plump goldfish -- all fairground prizes --
which weave among the weed. Fortunately they don't seem to appeal to
him.
The pond has been an endless source of fascination and enjoyment, not
just for my family but to all visitors to the garden. It's an instant
nature study lesson for young children. You don't need a large area --
my pond is only eight by five including the planting round the edge.
Even a half-barrel planted out and left to evolve in a city garden will
provide hours of interest, and create a home for an amazing variety of
wildlife.

Tracy Peet checks out the colourful cottons which lace summer meals
with style.
CHOOSING table linen to turn on the heat yet keep its cool looks has
never been easier, with the vast range on offer.
Habitat has a wide selection of very colourful Indian-style cottons
which really set the scene. Look for the tie-dye tablecloth in indigo
and crimson (#29), to brighten up outdoor occasions, and the
eye-catching big-check styles in grass green and gold (#19.50), for
150x225cm. If these colours don't appeal, or don't complement the
crockery you have chosen, there are Madras checks too: terracotta and
cream; navy, sage green and ivory; and turquoise, purple and orange.
Prices start at #9.50 going up to #19.50.
Divertimenti's catalogue has a cheerful French tablecloth with a
Jacquard woven stripes-and-flowers pattern in green and yellow, which
will blend well into any outdoor backdrop. It measures 59x82in, and
costs #39.95, with matching napkins in sets of four coming in at #14.95.
If you prefer something more traditional, there is a wide range of
formal styles on offer at Frasers. Unlike granny's cloths, which could
take ages to iron, these come in an easy-care polyester and cotton mix
which allow you to enjoy the weather rather than wasting time at the
ironing board. The ever-popular colours of rose, cobalt, pale sage
green, crimson, ivory and white form the bulk of the selection, but
there are other shades to choose from if these don't happen to suit.
Prices vary according to size from #7.99 to #42.99. Napkins are #9.99
for four, with matching mats #13.99.
Scotts of Stowe have introduced some smart embroidered linen, which
makes for a very summery look. Flower Basket has a satin-stitched floral
border, and it comes in three sizes from #9.95 to #39.95. Matching
napkins cost #7.95 for a set of four.
Another easy-to-care for fabric is the 100% dacron Visa Damask
tablecloth, a long-standing favourite fabric, with large, delicate
damask roses. It comes in various colours, including Wedgewood blue,
green and peach. A 178cm circle costs #19.99 and four napkins are #7.99.
For the lightest covering for your table, you can't beat lace.
Full-cotton Battenburg lace tableclothes are available at Frasers in
delicate white, ivory and cream, at #29.99 for a 173cm circle.
Linens Fine, as you'd expect, have an excellent range of Battenburg
and cut-out cotton lace tablecloths, including ones by Nimble Fingers
and Nimbus. Prices range from around #20 to #80 for a 168x259cm
tablecloth.
Finally, for a definitely Scottish table, look for their tartan
napkins and tablecloths in navy and red by Alexander Morton at #16.45
for a 50in square.

If music be the food of love, play on. (Twelfth Night).
* IF food be the music of love, grab a knife and fork. This is
probably what William Shakespeare meant to write before he got confused.
Too deeply into the sack and malmsey, I trow. But he was no fool when he
put ''food'' and ''love'' together in the same sentence, although the
''music'' is an optional extra.
It has taken some centuries, though, for this connection between
eating and Eros to become the subject of a scientific study. More
accurately, there's an interesting project underway which seeks to
determine how people's eating and food-shopping habits might change when
they become enamorados (as Shakespeare might have said if he'd been
Spanish) and are embarking on a life together, either as married couples
or co-habitees.
Do our attitudes to food really change when we pledge troth for
reasons which are not purely dietary? That's what the project is trying
to find out. It's not such a simple issue as the old adage for couples
contemplating matrimony: ''Tu'ppeny pie costs fourpence''. Nor is it as
one-sided as the principle laid down by writer James Chatto in The
Seducer's Cookbook, written 15 years ago and therefore somewhat
male-oriented:
''There are many advantages to eating at home. In a room of your own
no waiters hover to interrupt or insult, there is no Day of Judgement
when the bill arrives, and no chance of your guest spotting a friend or
an ex-husband at another table . . . ''
Clearly James Chatto came from another age. The ''seducers'' he was
writing for were clearly male, expected as a matter of course to pick up
the tab in a restaurant, and were not warned against the baleful
presence of an ''ex-wife''. But things are changing in the firmament of
relationships: and it is how these changes affect food and eating that
interests the researchers from Edinburgh and Glasgow Universities. They
start out with four simple questions:
Will marriage or co-habitation change your eating habits? Will eating
together change your attitude to meals? Will you share the shopping and
cooking? Who will decide what to have for dinner?
Note carefully that there are no questions about seduction. The
project is funded by the Economic and Social Research Council and, so
far as I know and thank goodness, a National Seduction Council doesn't
yet exist.
The questioning procedure is carried out by Dr Debbie Kemmer of the
Department of Human Nutrition at Glasgow University. Her interest is in
couples from Scotland's Central Belt -- Edinburgh, Glasgow and the
immediate areas -- who plan to marry this year or to set up home
together (for the first time) and who have no children. They will be
visited at home several months before they begin to live together, and
several months afterwards, and asked on each occasion about how they go
about the business of choosing their food, shopping for it and preparing
it. They are asked to keep a seven-day food diary at each visit.
Dr Kemmer, who is looking for more volunteers, told me: ''It's an
informal interview, more like a conversation. We want to make it easy
for the respondent. We're not like journalists, who are liable to write
horrible things afterwards.'' Cringe, I said.
Curiously enough, you might think, an abiding interest in food is not
important. Couples might be drawn together because of a shared interest
in food and eating: but it's the reaction and changing habits of the
average couple that interests the researchers. The project is concerned
with the chemistry of eating together. And that's something that
Shakespeare understood, however unscientifically.
* Couples in Central Scotland planning marriage or co-habitation are
asked to contact Dr Debbie Kemmer at 0141-304-4686 or 0131-228-1484.
Their help in the project would be much appreciated.

* FORMAL heavy dining furniture can seem a bit unwieldy at this time
of the year, and it definitely doesn't like being carted into the garden
for a light meal alfresco. The feeling is usually mutual on the part of
whoever gets the job of carrying it.
What's needed is a more flexible style to suit casual eating. As you'd
expect, the French are experts when it comes to designing summer
furnishings. Grange have several styles in pale woods and wicker: the
Shaker table, from #590, is complemented by Three Colour woven cane
chairs from #170 each.
For a simpler family meal, Scotts of Stowe have the ideal picnic set
made from Scandinavian redwood pine. Easy to take out and set up, the
four stools and table fit into their own carrying case and can be easily
stored in a cupboard. The complete sets costs #39.95. Alternatively,
there is the clever garden bench that coverts in a single easy motion
into a picnic table, complete with integral bench seating, for #99.95. A
special seal ensures weather protection.
Continuing the Scandinavian theme, IKEA offer a wide range of
reasonably priced rattan furniture which is perfect for the garden. For
as little as #24 you can buy a stackable Agen armchair in a choice of
several colours. There's also some furniture for children -- Baribal
armchair, #17, sofa, #30, and table #14. The woven Arnt chair, #42, and
blond-wood Nordisk table, #187, make a stylish and appealing
combination.
Habitat have a wide range of casual furniture for conservatory or
garden. There's lots of easily-moved slatted furniture, and the
simple-to-set-up Scout folding stool, #15, and table, #29, are cheap
enough to invest in even if you rarely find it warm enough to eat
outside.
The Galvano table, #199, and matching chairs are more of a commitment
to faith in the British summer. The table's galvanised base and slatted
wooden top combine the charm of wood with the sturdiness of metal. The
chairs, #39, have wooden backrest and seat.
For a more unusual look, try the terracotta dining table top, #124,
with dining base, #75. This would look particularly good in a
conservatory with a tiled floor and the top is tough enough to withstand
knocks and clay plant pots.
The ancient craft of rush weaving is also in evidence at Habitat. The
wire-framed Minos chair costs #49, and there's a beech frame chair at
the same price. The rather more grand Chubb dining chair, #75, which is
hand-woven with a comfortable low round back, is perfect for lazy summer
dinners and the snooze which follows.
Whether your're eating in or out, if you can't be bothered with
setting the table but don't fancy having your dinner on your lap, there
are some handy little folding tables and sturdy trays.
Lakeland Plastics has a perfectly-sized television table made of
rubberwood, which looks like pine, for #16.95. It's large enough to take
a complete table setting for one, is ideal for munching in front of the
box, and folds flat when not in use.
Scotts of Stowe have got things in hand as well. Their Cotswold Lap
Tray, #14.95, is a work of genius for the TV-dinner generation. Not only
does it have a raised beech frame to stop things sliding off, but the
base is a lightweight beany pillow which moulds to the contours of your
lap, increasing stability and comfort. Almost as wonderful is the
Non-Slip Tray, #6.95, which promises to hold onto just about anything,
even at a steep angle.
Habitat have taken a more traditional approach with their trays. The
simplest are of stylish plain wood in blue and natural finishes for #15.
For the naturally clumsy there is a deep handmade Indian wooden tray
which will catch any spillages.
Marks and Spencers have opted for the practicality of plastic with
their large oval melamine tray, #13, which has the added bonus of being
heat resistant -- so your cocoa mug won't leave annoying white marks.
Finally, for anyone planning to eat out of doors, Boots Ant Killer,
#2.79, should ensure some peace from the marching feet.

Contemporary silversmiths are becoming rare in Scotland, as Deedee
Cuddihy reports, and the cutting edge is abroad.
MY mother had a taste for the fine things of life and I sometimes
wonder if she accepted my father's proposal of marriage only after
discovering that his parents would be sure to give them a canteen of
sterling silver cutlery as a wedding present.
The gleaming cutlery always looked splendid on our dining table and,
of course, came in very useful during times of financial hardship when
my mother needed something substantial to take to the local pawn shop.
Admittedly, my own cutlery drawer is filled with a motley collection
of cheap stainless steel and tarnished silver plate purchased from
market stalls and auction rooms, but if you were to offer me a choice of
cutlery, price no object, I would definitely go for something from
Danish silver company, Georg Jensen whose main British showroom is in
New Bond Street, London.
A comprehensive range of Jensen silverware was on display in Edinburgh
recently at an exhibition in the Botanic Gardens, and I was particularly
taken with a design called Bernadotte which was originally created by
the company in 1939 and, these days, costs just under #3000 for 36
pieces.
Many people will baulk at that price -- especially when you can buy a
second-hand Ford Escort for the same money -- but as architect Grethe
Meye, one of Jensen's current designers, pointed out: ''Cutlery is a
very personal thing which many people purchase for life and is an
extension of the remarkable tools our hands are. One has to live with
cutlery day in and day out and hopefully, grow to like it more and more
each time it is used.''
Jeremy Sniders, a specialist in Scandinavian silver based at 158 Bath
Street in Glasgow, next door to Christie's, makes regular trips to
Denmark where he has purchased whole canteens of second-hand Jensen
cutlery for customers. (He also carries a large stock of stunning
Scandinavian jewellery.)
There is a small selection of Jensen cutlery at Mappin &amp; Webb's
glittering new shop in Buchanan Street, Glasgow, including a single
exquisite coffee spoon (priced #154) in the company's famous Blossom
pattern designed in 1919.
However, according to Richard Beatts, of Mappin &amp; Webb, Jensen cutlery
appeals to a ''limited market'' in Scotland, an opinion shared by David
Goldinger of Stockwell China Bazaar in Glasgow. According to Mr
Goldinger, fine cutlery produced by the German company Robbe and Berking
is ''more to Scottish tastes''. The price of a 44-piece set of cutlery
(excluding the wooden canteen) is around #3000.
''You can get cheaper sterling silver cutlery,'' Mr Goldinger
admitted, ''but that's because the depth of the silver is thinner. It's
not the same product at all and people should be aware of that when
they're making a purchase.''
There is, by the way, no saving in buying silver cutlery by the
canteen-full, and people who love the idea of eating from beautifully
wrought precious metal need have no qualms about ordering their
favourite design piece by piece, as and when they can afford it. And
there's no reason, either, why you should stick to just one design.
Inhouse of Glasgow and Edinburgh, which deals in contemporary
furnishings, sells a lot of cutlery produced by the award-winning David
Mellor Ltd, probably the only company designing and manufacturing modern
cutlery in Britain.
David Mellor's latest design, in top quality stainless steel, called
Paris and described as ''connoisseur's cutlery for people who appreciate
fine food'', is proving very popular with Inhouse customers. A 44-piece
canteen comes in at #522 with prices starting at #7.30 for one dessert
fork. For those on a tighter budget but appreciate good, modern design,
there is Cafe at #13.50 for a four-piece place setting.
In the past, Scottish craft workers produced vast quantities of
beautiful silverware for the home market, including Bonnie Prince
Charlie's cunning travelling canteen, made by Ebenezer Oliphant in 1740
and now on display in the Scottish Portrait Gallery in Queen Street,
Edinburgh.
Nowadays, although shops like Hamilton and Inches on George Street can
supply locally-made silver teaspoons singly or in sets of half-a-dozen,
the number of silversmiths producing a full range of cutlery in Scotland
can easily be counted on the fingers of one hand.
Edinburgh-based silversmith Adrian Hope loves the fact that, unlike
decorative silver, the pieces of cutlery he produces are basically tools
with an everyday function.
On the other hand, Aberdeen-trained silversmith Sheana Stephen would
not thank you if you asked her to produce a whole set of cutlery. She's
quite happy concentrating on her delightful strawberry spoons (#68 from
the Gatehouse Gallery, Rouken Glen Park, Glasgow) as well as private
commissions for pickle spoons, jam spoons and rice servers which,
although highly decorative, are meant to be used on a regular basis.

* CHEERFUL-looking cups and saucers in bright and bold colours add a
bit of excitment to summer eating, especially when it's warm enough to
go outside for meals.
Divertimenti's Oiseau de Provence, from the Drome region of France,
looks the part, as does Marks and Spencer's colourful hand-painted
Damson tableware, and its Rimini range, with its striking bands of
cobalt blue, turquoise and yellow. A dinner plate in Damson costs #7 and
a pasta bowl #10, and Rimini comes in at #4 for a dinner plate and #5
for a cup and saucer.
Ikea's Fyrkant earthenware, with its bold blue stripes and checks --
#26 for 20 pieces -- is another option.
Rather more expensive, at #69.95 for 20 pieces, Scotts of Stow's clean
and crisp Lisboa porcelain dinner service in cobalt blue or sage green
looks good either indoors or out.
Of course the family silver won't sit kindly with these more populist
styles, so you'll need something more informal. Guy DeGrenne's
plastic-handled bistro cutlery from Scott's of Stow is elegant yet
robust enough for everyday use. It comes with ivory, black, dark blue
and British racing green handles at #39.95 for 24 pieces. This includes
an attractive hand-made box which you can put straight into the cutlery
drawer or leave on display.
In the same vein, Marks and Spencer's 24-piece cutlery set for #36 has
sturdy melamine handles and comes in white and green. For the brunch
table, Scotts of Stow's hand-painted chicken cruet set #12.95 is a must.

This Wednesday marks the fiftieth anniversary of Labour gaining power
in a landslide post-war victory. Jack Webster speaks with two of the
main players from those heady political days.
AS the dream of a Labour Party victory began to dawn that July day of
1945, three young men stood on the steps of Cardiff's City Hall and
heard the declaration which showed that they had gained all three local
seats for the new ruling party.
They were political unknowns at the time. Who could have guessed that
one of them, James Callaghan, would end up as Prime Minister and that
another, George Thomas, would become a legendary Speaker of the Commons?
Those brand new Members of Parliament -- Hilary Marquand was the third
-- then packed their bags and set out for London to join in Labour's
celebration of having at last gained real power at Westminster.
The flavour of that historic period was re-created for me in vivid
terms by one of that Welsh pack, the irrepressible George Thomas, now in
the Lords with the name of Tonypandy, a distinguished Methodist preacher
who is the first to acknowledge that his God has been good to him.
A few years ago he had cancer of the throat and seemed doomed when the
disease was also found to be in his stomach. Responding to treatment on
both counts, he is today a good advertisement for miracles, fresh-faced
and lively, with his voice restored to the point that he preaches
regularly at the age of 86.
So how was it at Westminster in the summer of '45?
''I loved history and was overwhelmed by the fact that, here was I,
straight from the valley, into that House where men like Gladstone,
Disraeli, and Pitt had gone before,'' he recalls.
''On that first day, I remember Winston Churchill coming into the
chamber and the Tories getting up to sing For He's a Jolly Good Fellow.
When Clem Attlee appeared, I think it was George Griffith, a Salvation
Army man, who started singing The Red Flag.
''Although I was a socialist, I have never forgotten the sense of
thrill that I could speak to Winston Churchill and Anthony Eden, who had
played such a noble part in the war.
''After a few weeks, Eden said to me 'Well Tommy, how are you settling
down?' 'Very well, Mr Eden,' I said. 'This is a wonderful place with
wonderful people.' He said 'Yes, but there are some of the other sort as
well. Be careful who you choose as your friends.' I never forgot that.
''On the first day I sat between Jim Callaghan and Michael Foot, who
had a streaming cold. I was afraid I would catch it.''
Ironically, he would cross swords with both these colleagues at a
later date. But for the moment he would absorb the heady atmosphere of
Labour's new dawn, with its array of personalities.
''We faced a Europe which was shattered and broken, and we were a
bankrupt nation. But we had high hopes of building a nobler world. In
retrospect, I had no guile in me. I just wanted a society where working
people would have a fair chance in life.
''I had my own ideas about the brotherhood of man but I wasn't as keen
a political animal as those coming from Oxford and Cambridge. Some came
into the Labour Party because of Marx. I came in because of the Chapel.
''I found Clement Attlee a very shy and reserved Englishman. The only
one of the big names I had met before, at a party conference, was Nye
Bevan. But I never joined the Bevanite group. I knew in my constituency
they would see that as extremism and I didn't want to be looked on as an
extremist.
''This was the heyday of socialism, the only thing being that we took
over when there was no money. In that first Parliament we nationalised
the basic industries, except steel. We probably tried to do too much but
it brought about a silent revolution.
''When the coalmines were taken over, I remember the pithead services
held throughout the country, with the Union Jack flying. In those days
we went through the division lobby singing hymns. Many a time I was
asked 'Strike up, George!' And I did. They all knew the hymns in those
days and we would all sing.
''Clement Attlee had half a dozen preachers in his Cabinet then. By
the time I became Speaker of the House I was the only preacher left.''
By 1951, Labour had run out of steam and their own MPs knew it. Lord
Tonypandy remembers: ''The Government looked tired and Mr Attlee was
ready to go. When he called a February election it was asking for
trouble. Attlee didn't particularly like Herbert Morrison, his No. 2,
who had suggested to friends in 1945 that he should be the one to take
over. There was no love lost between them.''
So the Tories were back for the next 13 years. In 1964, George Thomas
became a junior minister and, surprising even himself, gained a taste
for higher office. That was fulfilled when he became Secretary of State
for Wales, at a time of much nationalist feeling.
But he was a staunch believer in the Union and ran into the problems
of the time: ''Fifty bombs went off in the run-up to the investiture of
Prince Charles,'' he recalls. ''My own office was blown up.''
George Thomas became the Speaker in 1976, just as James Callaghan
succeeded Harold Wilson as Prime Minister. It was a time of reflection
for those two men who had anticipated an exciting future at Cardiff City
Hall more than 30 years earlier.
George Thomas considered his background and was still trying to take
it all in. His father had walked out at the age of 32, leaving his
mother to bring up five children. Nobody laughed when he went to
Tonypandy School with patches in his trousers because everybody had
patches in those days.
He had joined in a hunger march from Tonypandy to Cardiff, trained as
a teacher and was working in London in 1931, when he first joined the
visitors' queue at the Commons and found himself infuriated by the
mumbling of the Speaker.
''All those years later when, to my surprise, I myself became the
Speaker I remembered this and made sure that I spoke out loud and
clear,'' he laughs.
As the Second World War drew to a close, Callaghan and Thomas were
vying for the same Cardiff seat.
''I had not passed the medical for the forces so I turned up in plain
clothes,'' his lordship recalls. ''Jim appeared in his naval uniform,
complete with braid, and pipped me by one vote. I knew it was the
uniform that did it.''
Thomas gained another Cardiff seat but it was the start of a fairly
sharp rivalry between the two men. He speaks frankly about it:
''Inevitably there is a little feeling when you are from the same
party in the same town, and it is quite likely there was some jealousy
between us. Jim Callaghan was the abler of the two of us in politics but
I had the heart and affection of the people of Cardiff.
''He was ambitious and I knew he was strong in Parliament, whereas I
just loved looking after people and they gave me their loyalty.''
With Labour's George Thomas established as Speaker in the House of
Commons, Prime Minister Callaghan was raised to anger by some of his
rulings. But the Speaker reserved some of his more bitter attacks for
Michael Foot who, as Leader of the Commons, apparently tried to head off
rulings which threatened the survival of that Labour Government of
1974-9.
Quite controversially, Thomas lifted the veil on some of those private
exchanges in his memoirs, Mr Speaker, when many held that they should
have remained confidential.
George Thomas was the first Speaker to become something of a star,
attracting his own fan mail. Presiding at the introduction of radio to
the House, he gained fame with his particularly Welsh rendering of
''Order, order!'' which became a national catch-phrase.
It was easy to adjust, he says, to the luxury of living in the
Speaker's House, under the shadow of Big Ben.
''But at weekends I used to go home to my little bungalow in Cardiff
and the neighbours would come in for coffee, and I would tell them all
about what had been happening at Westminster during the week. That kept
me in touch with things.''
Today, in a vastly different world, he accepts that the Labour Party
cannot be as it used to be. He pins his faith on Tony Blair as a
wholesome, young man who will take Labour into the 21st century.
With characteristic balance and generosity, he goes out of his way to
declare John Major to be an honourable man who has run into some
appalling problems. ''History has been unkind to him,'' he adds.
Why did such a personable man as Lord Tonypandy never marry?
''Sometimes if you are the last in the family you have obligations. I
was caring for my mother who lived till 92, when I was 63. Not that she
was against me marrying. In fact she was pushing me to do it.
''I had plenty of girlfriends and was engaged three times and would
have loved to have had children. In fact it is the greatest sadness of
my life that I didn't get married and have children. With all my heart I
wish that that had happened.
''I said to my mother, 'I'll get married after you've gone, Mam!' And
if the right person were to come along yet, I wouldn't rule it out, even
at 86. Mind you, I wouldn't be able to have children now,'' he said
wistfully.
''Oh I don't know,'' I encouraged. ''Remember Charlie Chaplin. He
became a father in his eighties.''
''You know, you're right, man!'' said his lordship in a burst of
enthusiasm. And at that, he went bouncing along the Westminster corridor
with a new spring in his step.

With the cheers if the 1945 Labour victory ringing in her ears,
Margaret Herbison started out for London as the new Member of Parliament
for North Lanark, still a little bewildered by the dramatic turn of
events which had set her life on a new and totally unexpected course.
Until recently, the coalminer's daughter had been happily teaching
English and history at Allan Glen's School in Glasgow, with no thought
of any other career. As a committed socialist from the mining community
of Shotts, she had found political satisfaction in her voluntary work
for the party.
That was until the rumblings of a General Election, when a knock at
the door brought two men from the National Union of Mineworkers with the
suggestion that she should become the Labour Party candidate.
It took a return visit one week later before they convinced her that
this should be her future. The seat had once belonged to Jenny Lee (wife
of Aneurin Bevan) but when she moved to the ILP and split the Labour
vote, the Tories won it in that last election of 1935.
Now it would be up to the wee lass from Shotts to win it back. But who
at that stage would have guessed it would take her to the top as a
Government Minister, playing her own part in the social revolution of
the post-war years?
Today, at the age of 88, the Right Honourable Margaret Herbison looks
back along the vista of a memorable career, the sole Scottish survivor
of that Labour landslide which took her trundling towards London.
Apart from those rented rooms across Lambeth Bridge at Kennington,
within walking distance of Westminster, home was never anywhere other
than Shotts. And there it remains today as the frail little lady with
the steely determination casts her mind back for half a century and
beyond to re-create the mood and texture of the time.
There is no loss of personal pride. The floral dress is well arranged,
the coiffure immaculate, and the ear-rings round off a surprisingly
youthful appearance.
''I picked up the socialism from my father, John Herbison,'' she says,
''a miner who was interested in people and their welfare and fought to
improve the lives of working families.
''My childhood was spent in Shottskirk Road, where my father was born,
and it was to that same house that we all came back from the Miners'
Welfare Hall amid the excitement of winning the 1945 election.
''As the campaign proceeded, it was evident we were winning but I had
not expected the landslide. Now, however, we had a real working majority
for the first time and could get down to bringing some of our socialist
policies into action.''
The young lady who was schooled at Dykehead and Bellshill, and had
gone on to Glasgow University before a successful teaching career,
couldn't wait to join in this poignant moment of Labour Party history.
''I was in among real giants of politics,'' Margaret Herbison recalls,
with a rich glow. ''There were men like Clement Attlee, our new Prime
Minister, Nye Bevan, Hugh Dalton, Stafford Cripps, Manny Shinwell.
''Down from Scotland there were people like Joe Westwood and Arthur
Woodburn, Hector MacNeill, Willie Ross and Tom Steel. And the newcomers
like myself included Jim Callaghan (a future Prime Minister), Woodrow
Wyatt, John Freeman, George Thomas, and Barbara Castle.
''If you look at that Attlee Government,'' she says, ''it was
wonderful the amount of work they tackled and the changes they made in
social provision. There was the National Health Service and the
programme of nationalisation, which was very big.
''I can still remember the wonderful meeting we had in the Picture
House in Shotts when Herbert Morrison and Pat Dollan came to tell us
about the nationalisation of the coal industry. What a feeling of hope
there was among the miners and their families.
''And when it came to the second reading of that nationalisation Bill
in the Commons, I was the first person through the division lobby! That
was very close to my heart.''
But for all that euphoria, and her fierce loyalty to socialist
principles, Margaret Herbison does acknowledge the changing times.
''It doesn't mean I would re-nationalise those industries today. You
have to work out the best way of using the industries to serve the
public. So much of it has been undone that a lot of thought will have to
be given to it. As Harold Macmillan said, there has been a lot of
selling of the family silver. Now it depends on what kind of Britain we
are going to build.''
Attlee's Government was forced into devaluation and tensions were
growing within the party. Meanwhile, Margaret Herbison busied herself at
Westminster and was also a delegate to the Council of Europe when it
first met in Strasbourg.
Labour ran its full five-year term but Attlee went to the country
again on the following year.
''We were all right in North Lanark in 1951 but when you went into
other areas you realised matters were not going well for us,'' Miss
Herbison recalls. ''Why? Because one of the tragedies of politics -- and
the same will happen if we win the next election -- is that too many
people expect change to take place next week. And if they don't get it,
they are inclined to leave you.
''We will have to be very careful at the next election to prepare our
people for the kind of difficulties we'll meet and let them know you
cannot change overnight what has been done in the last 12 or 14 years.''
Margaret Herbison shared the deep disappointment of Labour's 1951
defeat. Her own career, however, moved steadily upwards, and by 1956 she
was chairman of the Labour Party, a rewarding experience.
The Tories reigned for 13 years before Labour went ahead again, led
this time by Harold Wilson. And in the new Government of 1964, the lady
from Lanark became Minister of Pensions and National Insurance.
By 1966 she had assumed the wider role of Minister of Social Security
with a hectic schedule.
In 1967, however, she suddenly resigned her ministerial post and to
this day, 28 years later, she has never explained why.
''When I resigned, I had no intention of giving the Tory press a story
which would do harm to the Labour Party,'' she said, reminiscent of a
common obsession of the period.
But couldn't she tell me now? ''I have never felt any different -- and
I can't tell you even now,'' she nodded firmly.
The word at the time was that the Cabinet had over-ruled her plan to
raise the family allowance by seven shillings a week.
Margaret Herbison retired in 1970, the year the Tories regained power
under Edward Heath, having served a neat 25-year spell at Westminster.
Now she can look back on another 25 years, which began with a busy
year as Lord High Commissioner of the General Assembly of the Church of
Scotland, an appropriate honour for a lady who had had such a long
connection with her local Calderhead Church in Shotts.
She was also voted Scotswoman of the Year and has since been keeping
herself busy, not least at election times, when you will still find her,
in her eighties, out in the constituencies with a loudspeaker.
Margaret Herbison's loyalty to the socialist cause does not
acknowledge that there are right and left wings within her beloved
party. In fact she gets very annoyed if you as much as suggest it.
But what about Tony Blair and John Prescott?
''I had reservations about voting for Tony Blair,'' she confesses,
''and swithered between him and John Prescott. John has fire in his
belly and you need that.
''But Tony is doing a very good job for us. The unions will always be
part of the Labour movement but he is making it plain that they will not
have too much power.''
She seems to go along with that -- just as she looks back on a life
fulfilled and says: ''I got great pleasure out of my work in politics
and have no regrets.''
What about a man in the life of such a lively lady? Yes, there were
boyfriends, she confesses. Any proposals?
''No proposal,'' she says with a firm smile. And there the matter
would rest.

Church concerns on sex, marriage, and adultery are not exclusive to
modern living. Jim Hewitson found a similar dilemma existed 300 years
ago in Aberdeen.
MARRIAGE, quoth the wit, is not a word but a sentence. A sweeping
generalisation, of course, but the divorce rate and single-parent
culture in Scotland lends some weight to the quip. Even the Bishop of
Edinburgh is on record recently asking for greater compassion and
understanding for the adulterer.
Apropos of nothing in particular am I wrong in thinking this is the
first Bishop of Edinburgh to dare to pop his head above the lectern in
any meaningful way since Jenny Geddes lobbed her stool at a
seventeenth-century predecessor for daring to say mass in her lug?
Anyway, back to sex. The land is consumed by fornication and adultery
and we are all slaves to our bestial, basic instincts. Well, maybe. But
is this news, I ask myself? Sex is, has been, and will assuredly remain
the greatest body-contact pastime around, the only sport where the
equipment comes made to measure and neatly packaged (mostly!), where
they are no green fees or season tickets and the only essential extra
these days is a suitable waterproof.
'Twas ever thus. As the good bishop was causing something of a stir I
was, by coincidence, running the rule over the deliberations in 1562 of
the Kirk Session in Aberdeen, the supervisory body of the Reformed Kirk
in the Granite City.
Of the 10 commandments, the decalogue, which one do you reckon was
causing them the biggest headache -- slander, railing, backbiting,
murder, swearing, coveting your neighbour's ass? No indeed, it was that
trusty old double act of fornication and adultery. The amount of time
spent on this topic is a sure indicator that violation of the seventh
commandment was Scotland's, well at least Aberdeen's, besetting sin.
To put it mildly, they took a different line from the bishop.
Their plan was to order the ''shutting up of all bordels, their
inmates banished and all pandars and procuresses to be sent after
them''. It sounds as if Aberdeen possessed a red-light district of
Amsterdam proportions in the sixteenth century.
Punishment for ''simple fornication'' was humiliation in front of the
congregation for a first offence, ducking, and then banishment.
Banishment was also the destiny of convicted adulterers who were first
of all to be carted ignominiously through the town.
Handfast or trial marriages were strictly forbidden and wee bastards
-- sorry, recently delivered children born out of wedlock -- were not to
be baptised until the parents had made an open repentance in the church.
Civil conviction for fornication could result in the loss of #40 with
an alternative of eight days in the clink on bread and water, followed
by a two-hour public ''exposure'' at the busiest time of day. For
subsequent offences the head was to be shaved and the fornicator ducked
in the foulest puddle that could be found in the parish.
1   It's clear those sober pioneers of the Reformed Kirk were
determined that sex should only take place within an association of
marriage. What then, I wonder, would they have made of Mae West who when
asked if she had plans to marry responded by saying she'd heard that
marriage was a sacred institution, but she wasn't ready for an
institution just yet.

The image of Scottish youth hostels is changing as more international
travellers, families, and couples flood the market. George Hume examines
the future of the budget accommodation.
IN castle and croft, city centre, and at remote road end, the Scottish
Youth Hostels Association has spent the past 64 years laying out the
welcome mat -- more than half a million young people annually finding
bed, board, and companionship under its roofs. Now membership is
falling, the number of bed-nights dropping, and four hostels, said to be
either under-used or beyond economic refurbishment, are to be closed.
Youth hostels in Scotland, once simple and homely, are being shaped
for the future as nothing less than a low-budget hotel chain with a
concentration of accommodation in cities and major towns. Many of the
rustic huts, Victorian villas, and turreted mansions that have so long
seen service -- 20 young people to a dormitory, lino floors polished to
make glad the heart of any sergeant-major -- will, by the turn of the
century, be little more than a memory with Scots themselves a rare sight
in their own hostels.
In place already are hostels built and run like hotels -- twin-bedded
rooms, family accommodation, bookings by fax, carpets throughout,
opening hours to 2am, continental or full Scottish breakfast to wake up
to, and cleaning staff in attendance instead of the roster of domestic
duties that once put hostellers on their knees before morning departure.
But even as the Scottish Youth Hostels Association moves to meet
tomorrow's demand with a two-tier system -- budget-hotel-type
accommodation to cater for the international traveller and traditional
old-style hostels for those setting out to enjoy scenery and
tranquillity -- its officials acknowledge that there is disquiet among
members, a public perception that the sale of hostel buildings indicates
an institution on the slide.
The four youth hostels marked for closure and sale -- at Kingussie on
Speyside, Ballater on Deeside, Loch Ard near Callander, and Garramore
near Morar -- can no longer pay their way, says the association, which
claims that criticism is unjustified, being made without regard to the
changing face of hostelling, today's demand, and the association's plans
for the future.
There is, they stress, no need for concern, no call to fear the
collapse of an organisation that for more than half a century has
introduced young people to the beauty of Scotland.
Millions of pounds are to be spent in the next few years upgrading
hostels and building new ones -- for example, #3.5m earmarked for a new
250-bed hostel in Edinburgh. To help meet the development bill the four
hostels to be sold will be marketed, it is claimed, with vigour.
How much will be raised by the sale of the four hostels -- 248 beds
between them -- is uncertain but anxious association members recall the
lost opportunity that was the sale of Garth Memorial Youth Hostel, given
to the association in 1951 in memory of a young naval officer who died
in the last war and sold by the SYHA for just #18,000 when dry rot was
discovered: a very modest sum even 13 years ago for a mansion-house and
stately acres.
Garth Youth Hostel, in the magnificent setting of Glen Lyon --
Scotland's longest glen -- was given to the Scottish Youth Hostels
Association by the mother of Lieut Ian Mackenzie-Anderson who died when
HM submarine Odin was sunk by enemy action in Tarranton Bay on June 13,
1940. When Garth hostel was sold in 1982 the memorial room was
transferred to the hostel at Oban.
James Martin, general secretary of the association, said: ''The
problem with Garth was dry rot. We contacted the Mackenzie-Anderson
family before we sold and they had no objection. But that did not
prevent some ferocious criticism. Now people are saying again -- why
sell? At our highest point we had 99 hostels, today 85, but what the
critics do not understand is that hostelling is now a very different
ball-game.''
The rationale behind the disposal programme, says Bill Forsyth, the
association's accountant, is simple. ''We are, at all times, attempting
to meet the needs of young people and the danger is that we do not --
that we address the needs of 30 years ago. We simply cannot live in a
time-warp.''
Reasons for putting the four hostels on the market at the end of the
summer are two-fold. The Ballater hostel is in poor condition and needs
#75,000 spent on it, yet last year managed to mark up only 2000
bed-nights. Kingussie hostel likewise requires substantial expenditure
if it is to meet fire-safety and environmental requirements.
Furthermore, association officials point out, Aviemore hostel, which had
#500,000 spent on it last year, is just 12 miles distant.
Loch Ard hostel, in the Trossachs, and Garramore hostel, at Morar, are
both suffering marked long-term decline in usage. Says James Martin:
''We do not set out to make a profit but there is a limit to what we can
spend on subsidies.''
Changes in the pattern of use -- such as short breaks taking over from
two-week holiday periods -- are bringing about the present need to sell
some hostels and open others elsewhere, says Jim Martin.
The hostel circuit favoured by international travellers, generally on
a one-night-only basis, runs from Edinburgh to Pitlochry, on to
Aviemore, Inverness, the magnificent Carbisdale Castle at Culrain, Skye,
Fort William, Oban, Glasgow . . . then off to another country.
The modernisation and re-shaping of the hostel at Glencoe is held up
as an example of what can be achieved by a change in tack. Formerly able
to house almost 100 visitors a night, the building was altered and the
number of beds reduced to 64 after which bed-nights sold rose by 50%.
The hostel in Glasgow is also cited as an indicator of what the new
approach can achieve. Fifteen years ago it drew just 8-9000 overnights a
year. Now, in the form of a hotel, the Glasgow hostel marks up 50,000
bed-nights annually . . . acknowledgement freely made by the association
to the part played by the new-look Glasgow itself.
At the other end of the scale is the 30-bed tin-roofed Glen Affric
youth hostel, made available to the association by the National Trust
for Scotland. Due for refurbishment, it is causing some anxiety on
account of the sensitive nature of the local environment.
But for all that the association claims to be striving to meet
tomorrow's market, according to Ken Howett, national officer of the
Mountaineering Council for Scotland, the SYHA must improve its marketing
and let people know it has changed its image if it is to survive.
Regrettable or not, the hostels will go. Last year's annual report
tells the story of hostelling's changing face in Scotland with
overnights down 22,000 overall -- those of Scots residents by no less
than 31,000. Ten years ago usage of the association's hostels was by and
large evenly split between Scots and ''international'' visitors. By last
year Scots' share of the overnight total had dropped to just one-third.
Notwithstanding the downward trend in overnights the income from
accommodation charges increased by almost #100,000 as a result of the
trend toward the use of larger -- and more expensive -- urban hostels by
young tourist visitors from England and overseas. The future in a
balance sheet. Says SYHA general secretary Jim Martin: ''There is no
doubt that we have got the business -- young people.'' But not, it
seems, young people on their native heath.

Lough Erne is one of rural Ireland's greatest treasures offering a
paradise for anglers. But, as James Freeman explains, a boom in
motorised water sports is threatening the lake's tranquillity and the
chance of reeling in a good catch.
LOUGH Erne, the lake in Fermanagh, not the loch in Perthshire, may be
the nearest thing left in the United Kingdom to trout anglers' paradise.
The countryside is unspoiled and unbelieveably rich in wildlife. The
natives are friendly to a fault. The prices are not exorbitant and both
accommodation and boats are plentiful and of a uniformly high standard.
This mighty water lies an hour-and-a-half across the North Channel from
Stranraer by Seacat followed by an equally quick dash down Northern
Ireland's M1 and A4 to Enniskillen -- about four-and-a-half hours from
Scotland allowing for the occasional delay caused by the odd Orange
parade en route.
Importantly, one of the first dividends of the peace process has been
that Scots can return with confidence to what was a traditional holiday
area; and anglers can escape the overfished Central Belt waters with a
few hours' easy driving.
The trout are big -- wild and huge by Scottish standards. At the tail
end of the Mayfly, which we caught in the first week of June, the
average fish coming to the dry fly was in excess of two pounds, heavily
spotted, small of head and deep of belly. Because of the limestone
strata on which Erne lies, the shallow bottoms are a thick soup of
shrimp, snail, and a hundred different aquatic creepy-crawlies, meaning
that the trout grow fast and taste like sea trout.
Fish of five or six pounds are not uncommon, and every year a number
of double-figure trout are taken on fly.
Erne is so vast -- like Loch Lomond multiplied by three or four --
that a gillie such as Roy Graham is essential, at least for a couple of
days so an understanding is gained of where fish can be found, and of
the dangers of the jagged limestone rocks. If the wind gets up it is
essential to have sufficient local knowledge to run for cover or to make
a passage swiftly back to base.
Yet all is not well in paradise. The ugly spectre of motorised water
sport is rearing its head on Erne.
Northern Ireland has abundant angling, both game and coarse, a fact
now heavily promoted by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, and Lough
Erne's extrordinary trouting is undoubtedly the jewel in the crown.
Until recently its unspoiled beauty was given over to the fishermen,
locals and visitors, and to the large cruisers which potter gently
through the Erne system to join the Shannon waterway in the Republic,
causing no upset to anyone.
Another peace dividend has been the reopening of the link between Erne
and Shannon at a cost of #30m. The channel had been obstructed to
prevent arms smuggling across the border, but the re-establishment of
this link has added pressure to provide more facilities for waterborne
visitors.
But now Erne has parascending, an environmentally devastating sport
requiring large amounts of space and powerful engines, and more and more
speedboats and water skiers are appearing from the towns. The ultimate
hell -- jetskis -- have also been spotted. All this in an area where
angling tourism is already well developed and poised for a swift
expansion. Also where many hundreds of people from bed-and-breakfast
houses through to magnificent self-catering developments, and from
specialist fly tiers and tackle shops to professional gillies, derive
their living from visiting and local fishermen.
Roy Graham, whose home is in the heart of the finest angling shore,
reflects the worry of many local people when he says: ''It would be all
right if they keep the speedboaters and the rest in certain areas 10
miles away down at the south-east end of the lake, well away from the
best fishing. We know that people fish down there as well, but up here
it is the best.
''The two just cannot co-exist. If boats are casting among the Mayfly
hatches and a speedboat goes past, even half a mile away, the noise of
the engines and the vibration underwater puts the trout down. You have
to give up and move away.''
He is incredulous when the current situation on Loch Lomond is
described to him, because when he gillied professionally at Bemersyde on
Tweed for Earl Haig, Loch Lomond still had its reputation as a great
fishery more or less intact. He becomes sad and angry when told how that
heritage has been dissipated and the environment degraded in the name of
commercial development which has been entirely dependent on fast water
sports.
He says: ''We must not let that happen here. We are seeing the speed
merchants creeping in every season but they must be stopped before it is
too late. There is far too much to lose.''
There is some reassurance, however, from Aideen McGinlay, director of
development at Fermanagh District Council, who says everyone is acutely
aware of the issues.
''We believe we still have time to get it right. Lough Erne is vast
but the pressures are undoubtedly building up. We have experienced a
170% increase in Easter bookings on last year and a 60% increase in
overseas inquiries. People from the Continent tell us we are the last
paradise and we believe we have the opportunity to manage it in such a
way as to serve as a model for other unspoiled areas, such as those in
Eastern Europe,'' she says.
The Lough Erne Management Committee, made up of all the interested
parties, is actively in favour of zoning the lake and is working out the
details now. In planning terms, 13 zones have been identified and
categorised into conservation areas where any development is highly
unlikely, sensitive areas where sympathetic development might be
allowed, and opportunity zones.
In addition, Upper Lough Erne has just been designated an SSSI and
Lower Lough Erne, where the great trout fishing takes place, is set to
follow soon. There is already an elaborate and comprehensive code of
conduct for all water borne loch users but, as with Loch Lomond, locals
want to know who is going to enforce it.
On the one side are the entrepreneurs who think the restraints and EC
directives give far too little scope for development. On the other hand
there is a growing conservation lobby saying there should be no more
developement.
At the moment, Erne remains largely unspoiled, rural Ireland at its
best. But, viewed from the mainland, it is easy to see and understand
the pressures on the planners and the authorities charged with bringing
jobs and development to the area. Every Scot who makes the trip across
the Province to Lough Erne or Lough Melvin or up to the Foyle's 650
miles of salmon, sea trout and trout river, must fervently pray that
they act wisely to preserve what they have got.
Before vital planning decisions are made to allow speedboaters and
waterskiers loose, all those in power in Fermanagh should be made to
witness the hell of Loch Lomond at Glasgow Fair or Lake Windermere
during any weekend of the year.

THE CLEANSING took place on the other side of purgatory. All
impurities were swept away by the adrenalin rush as a 2.5 pound wild
brown trout rose from the depths to sip underwater, ever so delicately,
the imitation Mayfly.
It was no sin to hook, land -- and, yes, kill -- that fish for supper.
My soul was pure when fishing the Lough Erne bay with no name on the
other side of a drift called Purgatory.
Angling is a paradox. It stimulates as it relaxes, brings peace even
in the height of battle. All stresses and strains disappear the instant
that trout came to the fly.
Part-time guide and gillie John Todd was also visibly relaxed. He had
relieved the self-inflicted pressure to find a feeding fish. Just being
with him on that famous, vast water in Fermanagh, even in the foul
conditions that prevailed, would have been enough.
His knowledge of the big Irish loughs, be it for coarse or game fish,
is legendary. A self-employed civil engineer, Todd is the nearest thing
to the Trout Bum in the book of that title by supremo American angling
author John Geirach. It is a compliment.
He has a short-line technique similar to that of the best traditional
Scottish anglers who work the bob-fly, one of three on the cast, across
the waves.
But, ever the idiosyncratic, his favourite method -- utterly new to
this angler and fellow hack James Freeman -- involves retrieving two
imitation Mayflies at astonishing speed right across the surface. It
works.
Lough Erne trout attain great size because of rich bottom feeding.
Practically the only insect which makes it worth their while to come to
the surface is the Mayfly, if the hatch is prolific.
However, even in a north wind, when breath leaves vapour trails -- in
June, of all times -- I lured a 3.5 pound wild brownie.
The specimen came to the floating fly, from distance, the take
combining an odd mixture of immense power and leisurely intent. It was
such a classic rise that time stood still, every phase of the process
recorded before tightening line.
The fly was tied by one of the best professionals around, Frankie
McPhillips, of The Buttermarket, Down Street, Enniskillen, whose
creations are in demand worldwide. His materials are so colour
sensitive, and patterns so accurate, that it is often impossible to
differentiate between the imitation and real thing when fishing.
Lough Erne -- its sheer size is daunting -- is far from easy. Local
boatmen with knowledge of drifts, often shallow and rocky -- from Roe
Shore, Road Bay, Dreenan Short to the other side of Purgatory -- are
essential.
One such worthy is Roy Graham, who showed Freeman, a Loch Lomond
fanatic, new ways to catch fish. One secret revealed by Graham, of
Manville House, Letter Kesh, Fermanagh, was to ''fish with Barney . . .
he will bring you luck''. Freeman took that advice, and two 2.5 pounders
followed.
Only later did I discover Barney was no magical fly pattern but a dog
with as big a reputation as Graham's. It follows his master everywhere,
including on to the boat.
Graham, a great Irish storyteller, recalled how Barney rescued an
''old billy goat''. The goat, abandoned, had arrived at Manville House
and, even after eating everything in sight, was adopted by the Grahams.
Barney became his greatest pal.
But the billy was banished to an island on Lough Erne after charging
its reflection in the patio doors. The demolition coincided with the
height of the troubles and sounded like a bomb exploding.
Every time Graham landed on the island for lunch, the goat was
waiting, trying to hitch a ride back to the mainland. One day,
overcoming his aversion to water, he followed the boat but soon began
sinking. Barney leapt overboard, seized the goat by the ear, and towed
him ashore.
Maybe Barney should be called Blarney. Whatever, the truth is that
Lough Erne is beautiful, wild, challenging -- the best water I have ever
fished.

* TALK about strong-arm business methods? This is what the businessman
who has it all will be wearing soon, if a design concept built by BT
technologists goes into production.
It's a communications console designed to keep the thrusting
city-slicker in touch from wherever he is, via telephone, videophone,
fax, and computer all in one, worn gauntlet-style on the wrist.
So far this is only a prototype, but no doubt that's what the future
holds. The arm-band console dispenses with the need for an office
altogether. Heck, it dispenses with the need for a house or even a car.
Street working might become all the rage.
* THE former Secretary of State for Scotland, Ian Lang, is now our
Frontiersman. His promotion to the job of President of the Board of
Trade has also encompassed a major reshuffle for the Government's Office
of Science and Technology which transfers from the Office of Public
Service and Science in the Cabinet Office to the DTI.
In a barrage of acronyms, the Cabinet Office tells us: ''The OPSS will
be renamed the Office of Public Service. The move of the OST to DTI will
allow the Government's policy on science, engineering, and technology to
be developed alongside its policies on industry.
Ian Lang will also be CMS, Cabinet Minister for Science. Under his
remit, the Technology Foresight Programme, aimed at linking the academic
and business worlds to the benefit of both and us all, will continue, so
we are assured.
* CD Roms and gigabite disks could soon be obsolete. For US scientists
have found a way to fit the text equivalent of four sets of
encyclopedias could fit on an inch-long steel pin using a new
information storage technique invented at Los Alamos.
Future civilizations should be able to read the information etched on
to the pins 5,000 years from now, without interpretive devices that
convert computer data into language or pictures.
The High-Density Read-Only Memory, or HD-ROM, uses a unique ion beam
to inscribe information on pins of stainless steel, iridium or other
materials that are built to last.
An HD-ROM holds about 180 times more information than a comparably
sized CD-ROM, today's cheapest data storage medium. Storage costs of
HD-ROM are roughly one-half percent of CD-ROM costs.
The pin memory will be ideal for archives and huge database systems
like land and bank records, maps of oil deposits and seismic
characteristics, surveillance maps for defence, astrophysical
catalogues, other scientific data, audio and video masters and important
cultural documents.
HD-ROM materials are hard, nonmalleable, nonflammable and don't react
easily with chemicals. Since the medium isn't magnetic, electromagnetic
fields can't destroy the data on HD-ROMs, unlike computer hard drives.
Information is written into the HD-ROM using a specially modified,
focused ion beam in a writing process  called sputter etching which
removes material by  atomic collisions in the region of the ion beam.
Already the film industry have shown great interest in the system
which would be able to preserve thousands of delicate movies from
Hollywood's golden age.

* COMPUTEK APPLE Computer have taken desktop publishing a step further
with the launch of their new LaserWriter colour printer for workgroups.
The new printer offers superior colour and mono print quality, ease of
use and high speed. The company have filed no less than 42 patents on
the LaserWriter 12/600ps which they say has near photographic quality
and a repro resolution of 600x600 dpi.
Using a new colour match accelerator the printer can transform a 5.5
megabyte image in just two seconds so that what you see on screen is
virtually what is printed. Speeds of up to three full colour pages a
minute are fairly impressive. The Apple LaserWriter is retailing at
about #5000 plus Vat.
* DIGITAL have been awarded a million-plus contract to provide
equipment to support satellite operation control centres for a
Globalstar mobile telecom systems.
Globalstar is a new world-wide orbital telephone system designed to
offer low-cost high quality comms such as data transmission, faxing and
position location to areas which are underserved today by existing
wireline and cell systems.
The service will be delivered by a 48 satellite low earth orbiting
constellation to provide phone service in almost every populated area of
the world.
* JVC have launched a new portable visual presenter designed to make
presentations as eye catching and trouble free as possible. The system
is a compact lightweight video imager with autofocus zoom lens.
Designed for use by timid presenters, according to the makers, it has
auto almost everything and works in almost all degrees of light. For the
timid, it's priced at #1495.
For less you can hire somebody to make that difficult presentation . .
. but that's not cricket.
* BRUCE Sinclair and Neil MacKinnon, the St Andrews physics experts
who invented a new type of miniature laser, have won two awards for
their efforts.
Their product won a Commercial technology Achievement Award from Laser
Focus World magazine for new products likely to impact on the
electro-optic industry.
The latest awards is from specialists Photonics Spectra magazine which
named it as one of the 25 best products of the year world-wide.

* TAKE the seventh on the left, past the pub, third on the right,
fifth exit at the roundabout, past Jim's pub, up the hill . . . and so
on and so on.
That's the kind of directions we normally get when we stop and ask.
Nobody can every make any sense of them. Now those clever Philips folk
have brought out a neat gadget that will give accurate directions to get
you there, then show you the way to go home.
It's a Routefinder, a hand-held electronic planner, no bigger than a
portable phone, which can plan routes anywhere in the UK. A milestone in
direction finding, this gizmo will also estimate the total journey
distance and arrival time, take a stab at fuel consumption, cost per
mile and then it will select the quickest routes avoiding motorways and
town centres.
Philips say that the average sales rep loses almost #2000 a year due
to traffic jams alone, and their Routefinder could cut this down by a
sizeable fraction.
RDS traffic warnings of congestion and tail backs enable drivers to
ask for alternative routes. All the travel information has been provided
by the AA and is stored on a GB routes data card with over 38,000
destinations. The Routefinder comes in at a penny under #200. Additional
AA cards will also be available for about #30 with specialist info like
camping sites, hotels and golf courses.
* Sisloe Research Institute have come up with a way to count your fish
before they go to market. It's a ROV-er -- a remote operated vehicle.
At the moment, divers have to spend plenty of time under water
checking on salmon fish farms, examining fish for disease, inspecting
and cleaning nets and removing dead fish.
Now they can stay up on the platform and guide the ROV system, which
apparently causes less stress to the fish themselves. The remote vehicle
has a powerful impeller engine, can travel backwards or forwards,
sideways, up and down, and roundabout.
The stereo image analysis can make an automatic measurement of fish
length. It does this by finding the fish in the image, locating the nose
and the tail fork, then calculating the distance between. It even
calculates for any bends the fish makes. This is  smarter than your
average sub.
The developers expected that fish would need protection from
accidental collisions, but in trials with salmon they tended to avoid
the contraption, because they're smarter than your average fish. They're
also much faster than the baby sub. Anyone who has  had one on the end
of the line will know they don't hang about.

* NEW techniques are allowing scientists to determine the diversity of
microbes, or bacteria, in a specific habitat -- information that can
help researchers assess ecological integrity of the environment at the
most fundamental level.
''Most people don't realise it, but bacteria run the world,'' says Dr
Vaugn McArthur, at the University of Georgia's Savannah River Ecology
Laboratory. ''They control most ecosystem level processes, such as
nutrient and mineral cycling -- all the things that are necessary for
the growth of other organisms.
''So if we can determine that a habitat contains a healthy and diverse
community of microbes, we can say it is a healthy environment. If there
are only a few microbes out there, an ecosystem's functions are limited.
Waste products are not broken down; they accumulate in the
environment.''
If bacteria really do run the world, however, what are those folk
doing in parliament? And why do we bother voting?
* NEW York researchers have made a major advance in the effort to find
a grand unifying theory of the laws of nature describing the universe.
The advance in so-called string theory suggests that space and time can
evolve in a manner far more radical than allowed by Einstein's general
theory of relativity.
The very complex theory would take more space than we have to explain.
However, another fundamental theory of the universe, or Murphy's Law,
has undergone serious research by yet another US scientist.
He has discovered that falling toast does fall butter-side down.
Robert Mathews, writing in the European Journal of Physics says this
happens because the universe is made that way.
Belief that the universe is out to spoil your breakfast is apparently
based on scientific theory, and is not some sort of Quantum Paranoia.
Mathews says that Murphy's Law -- if something can go wrong, it will --
is based on gravity and spin. Toast falling from a table only has time
for a one-half turn, so that the marmalade hits the Axminster most of
the time.
Until now, scientists have always said that it had a 50-50 chance of
being edible, but only a lucky bounce will avoid a wool and butter mix.
The equations show that two factors determine the final state of the
toast: the size of the toast, and the height of the table which is
dictated by the average size of humans, which a complex math formula
insists is determined by gravity and atoms.
The world has waited with bated breath for this news.
Here at Frontiers, serendipity reigns. Our toast generally lands jammy
side up, and not because we are jammy beggars. It's because we're so
busy scouring the universe that we must eat at a run, thus giving the
toast the chance of another half spin. Lucky old us.
* RESEARCHERS in Indiana have determined the three-dimensional
structure of a protein whose human analogue starts the production of
cholesterol, revealing how it functions and providing clues to how its
activity might be controlled. The findings offer the possibility
regulating cholesterol production in the body.
Cholesterol, an essential component of the membranes of animal cells,
also serves as a precursor for other products, including steroid
hormones of vertebrates. Cholesterol is both produced within cells and
is taken in through diet.
A high concentration of LDL cholesterol in the blood leads to the
formation of plaques on artery walls that restrict blood flow and
contribute to atherosclerosis, an important factor in heart disease.
Using a technique called X-ray crystallography, the Purdue researchers
were able to develop the first three-dimensional map of the enzyme.

MAYBE it was Mel Gibson's portrayal of Scottish hero Sir William
Wallace, and who cares if his blue-featured appearance was only a
thousand years out-of-date? Suffice it to say that woad seems to be
making a comeback.
The Pictish and Celt body-paint, as worn by Mel in Braveheart, the
stuff that scared the bejasus out of the Romans and a few other invasive
types, could be coming back on the market as a natural source of indigo
dye.
According to the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research
Council, scientists as Long Ashton Research Station have discovered
something the ancients already knew. Woad the weed could make financial
sense, especially in such a colour-conscious community as we have north
of the Border. The blue plant also happens to be very green too, in a
manner of speaking.
Not a lot of people know this, but woad has a yellow flower, much like
oilseed rape, and it was the very earliest known source of indigo dye,
used by the ancient Brits to give enemies the battle-blues. It remained
an important dye around the world for centuries and to get an idea of
what shade our ancestors painted themselves, think of blue denim for a
colour match.
The plant was grown in the UK as a colour source until the turn of the
century when a German chemist discovered how to produce synthetic indigo
dye which is indistinguishable from the natural source. Within 10 years
of the discovery the bottom simply fell out of the woad market.
Now, things are looking up. Since the early years of the century,
little research was done on natural indigo, but the Long Ashton
scientists are now re-examining the old plant in the hope of providing
an economically viable dye source.
At the moment, the colour accounts for 10% of the international dye
market, of about 800,000 tons, which would be a nice earner for the UK.
Also, environmental factors are increasingly important, and woad offers
a completely renewable source of indigo, because the hardy weed can be
harvested again and again. In comparison, the production of synthetic
indigo relies heavily on the oil industry which is more and more in the
news as a worry for the environmentally conscious.
One problem facing the scientists is that the robust woad plant of
Britain is not so fine a dye source as tropical versions. Unfortunately,
the high yielders refused to grow in northern climes, but advances in
plant breeding and the possibility of genetic manipulation could provide
an answer to this.
Before synthetics were discovered, cultivation of indigo plants for
dye was a major trade which supported many communities and the economic
dependence on the local plant was so great that local dyers and traders
were bound by law to use the natural woad and banned from dealing in
tropical products . . . sometimes under pain of death.
Business is not quite so fierce these days, despite how ferociously
our Mel played the part in Braveheart. Hopefully the plant researchers
will find out how to make a killing by more peaceful methods.

TWO major developments at Dundee University are aimed at opening a
world of conversation to people who are unable to speak. One of them has
been pioneered by a researcher who was born with cerebral palsy and
knows, at first hand, the problems of communication.
And British Telecom's scientists are opening up the frontiers into
technologies that will help the deaf and blind, and broaden the horizons
of disabled folk.
In Dundee University's MicroCentre, Dr Annalu Waller has been honoured
with a two-year personal fellowship by the Smiths Charity, worth around
#42,000. The fellowship will enable Dr Waller, who was born with
cerebral palsy, to continue her successful series of investigations into
communications for non-speaking people.
As principal researcher of the Talksbac programme, Dr Waller played a
key role in developing a system which uses microcomputer technology to
help those with severe physical, mental, and language impairments to
''speak'' using a database of pre-stored conversational sound. In fact
the new system has just been marketed in the US.
A delighted Dr Walker said: ''The award means I can investigate issues
I haven't been able to research before.
''My job is to design communicating systems for non-speakers. What we
are finding is that children who grow up without speech can't use these
systems properly. They can use the devices but can't tell you what they
think or feel. This fellowship will allow me to research the skills
these children need to communicate.''
Also at Dundee a new speech aid developed in collaboration with the
MicroCentre will be unveiled at an event in September. The device will
be demonstrated by one of its potential users at a conference in
Edinburgh.
Sylvia Grant of Glenrothes will use the TALK system to describe its
potential to the annual study of the Augmentative Communications
Practice. Like Dr Waller, Sylvia, now in her thirties, was born with
cerebral palsy. She is unable to speak.
Yet through the TALK system she is now able to take part in social
conversations. Using the voice synthesiser she will be able to tell the
delegates at the conference: ''TALK has given me much more confidence.''
In fact it has given her a voice. TALK (from Talk Aid using pre-Loaded
Knowledge) has been developed by a team of psychologists and computer
experts led by Dr John Todman of the university's department of
psychology in collaboration with Dr Norman Alm of the Micro Centre along
with Leona Elser and Portia File of Abertay. Together they have
developed a package which allows people without speech to achieve
communication abilities close to ordinary conversation.
Using a laptop computer and speech synthesiser they pre-load the
content of anticipated conversations in what is described as
''conversational chunks'' which allow users to respond quickly in live
conversation. Instead of having to key in each reply, which interrupts
the flow, they can tap into a personal bank of chat-pieces.
The system mimics speech by using temporal fill-ins like ''That's a
good question'' while the user thinks up a proper response.
Dr Todman says: ''To help users navigate flowing conversation and
control the flow direction, we have organised the pre-loaded phrases to
reflect the way topics tend to shift.''
For instance if the TALK user has a shared interest with a friend, she
can shift the conversation easily within that subject and using the
system she would be able to ''speak'' at around 60 words a minute, which
is less than half the normal conversational speed, but chattering like
fury compared with the key-in average of seven words a minute.
The TALK system is still in development, but by staging its use before
a professional audience of speech and language therapists the Dundee
team hope to show not just that it works, but to make them aware of the
potential for further development.
Meanwhile British Telecom is using advances in telecommunications to
develop a range of new applications and services to ensure that disabled
people gain the maximum benefit from information technology.
They are developing telephone equipment that can recognise sign
language and convert it into speech and global positioning by satellite
via mobile telephones to help blind people navigate around towns.
Stephen Furner of BT Labs, who is leading the research for people with
special needs, tells us: ''Even the most basic phone services might be
unusable by verbally and aurally impaired people.
''We are modifying existing services and equipment to open them up to
more groups of disabled people and we are looking at entirely new
applications of technology to help people cope more easily.''
As example, many future telephone devices will be screen-based, a
problem for the blind, but now, using a text-to-speech laureate system,
BT have a method of making the words on screen talk. Conversely, using
textphones for deaf people BT have done trials on a system that converts
words into text.
As old Bob Hoskins would say, and as Sylvia Grant will no doubt tell
her audience in Edinburgh in September . . . It's good to talk.

It took just one look and he was well and truly smitten. A second trip
to the Highlands and his life changed completely when he moved north for
good. Paul Barton and photographer Paul Hackett chronicle an unusual
love story.
I HAVE been in love with this region from the moment I first saw it
only 13 years ago, and I have lived, as an ''incomer'', in Shieldaig for
the last 11. It is undoubtedly one of the finest areas in the Highlands
of Scotland. I say ''one of the finest'' because, considering the many
other areas of equal but differing magnificence, it is plain daft to
claim that any one is first among so many equals.
The beauty of the Scottish Highlands is why I came to live here. Even
though I am an incomer and, even worse, an incomer who writes about
Scotland, I have encountered nothing but courtesy, friendliness and
kindness since I did so, for this is what Scots people, in general, are
like.
My wife and I were late hill-walkers, being in our fifties, before
friends, one fine February, introduced us to the ardours and joys of
this particular sport from their cottage in the Lake District.
As we grew in experience a certain innate dread of wild mountainous
places gave way to love, and yet we felt that the giant size of the
Scottish mountains, and the remoteness of the Highlands, would be beyond
our still somewhat timid capabilities.
Then the urgent promptings of a Scots friend and a particular
photograph of the awesome magnificence of Liathach, sent me, somewhat
apprehensively to Torridon, to have a look at this monster.
Fresh off the night train from London, and driving through Glen
Torridon, I decided ''just to have a look'' at Liathach's lower slopes
before booking into the Loch Torridon Hotel (being too comfort-loving
for the youth hostel).
My spirits raised by the grandeur of the scenery, after an arduous and
apprehensive three-and-a-half hours I found myself on the summit, which
gave rise to an important thought: ''If I can get up this, there will be
other Highland mountains I can get up too.''
And so it was. I was hooked.
The next year, a second hill-walking holiday in the Highlands took me,
greedily, to Fort William to stagger up the zigzags of Ben Nevis; to
Lochinver for an equally exhausting walk and climb to the Castail of
Suilven; and of course, back to Torridon for a ''go'' at, among others,
Liathach's gracious but rough sister mountain, Beinn Eighe. This was an
important decision for me, for it was stage two of my total conversion.
My chosen route to Beinn Eighe's main summit, Ruadh Stac Mor (3309ft,
1010m), was via the famous Coire Mhic Fhearchair, as this route,
although arduous, seemed to be scare free. I encountered a Scotsman
having a swim at 2000 feet, in its icy cold loch. He invited me to share
a dip.
Out of vanity I could not decline and I plunged in to take what must
have been the shortest swim I have ever had. Sitting in the warm July
sunshine afterwards I told him I was hoping to get to the summit. I
asked if he knew the area at all well. ''A wee bit,'' he admitted. Had
he ever been to the top? ''A few times.'' He then advised me to avoid
the unwelcoming scree gully at the head of the coire and to climb the
steep rocky slopes more to the left. As he departed he commented: ''It
will take you a wee while.'' It did.
I subsequently found out that he was none other than Lea McNally, the
NTS Ranger for Torridon, and thought that this degree of cautious
understatement, so typical of Highlanders, was absolutely inspiring.
My mind was made up. I realised the only way to assuage the intense
feelings I now had for the Highlands was to change my life completely
and go and live there. I thought I was still young enough at the age of
62 to do it and on my return to Oxford I resigned my consultant
appointment at the hospital.
My wife and I had been living, in affectionate collusion, in separate
houses in Oxford for several years, but she accompanied me to the
Highlands that October to help me find a cottage. This we achieved in
the traditional Highland manner; by chatting to everyone that we met.
An elderly lady on the coast road to Applecross told us: ''But I have
a friend with a cottage for sale in Shieldaig,'' and pointed out a white
cottage across Loch Shieldaig. Immediate inspection was followed by an
immediate decision and an offer was made. This cottage has been my home
now for the past 11 years.
I would claim that the special attraction of Torridon is for climbers
and hill-walkers, but the many other attractions include the wildlife,
angling (sea and loch) and, in the summer, yachting and wind surfing on
the sea-lochs.
It is also an area of great interest to geologists, the extremely old
Torridonian sandstone standing upon a foundation of metamorphic gneiss
and being capped with white quartzite.
But surmounting all these attractions is the austere grandeur of the
place. There are only two drawbacks to holidays in the Highlands, wet
weather and midges which gather round one in increasing numbers on
moist, warm, still days, August being their speciality. Only the female
bites.
You do not have to be an obsessional hill-walker to enjoy walking in
Torridon, as there is an abundance of low-level walks, ranging from a
one-hour stroll up the Balgy River (Shieldaig) to see the salmon jumping
(in season) to 10-15 mile ''round'' or ''through'' walks, done mostly on
good stalkers' paths, which negotiate the magnificent mountain country.
Two walks, one easy, one tough, are to be recommended.
The nine-mile round walk along the north shore of Loch Torridon, from
Fasag (Torridon) to Inveralligin, is along good tracks, paths, and a
small single-track road. It can be done in walking shoes and requires no
special gear or map; but take a packed lunch. On a fine day it offers
unequalled views of Loch Torridon and its mountains and is very varied
and beautiful. Don't do it on a dull wet day, or you will see little.
The walk commences at Fasag village and takes you along the edge of
Loch Torridon to the estate road leading to Torridon church. It passes
through fine estate woodland, dominated by great rocky cliffs, and
across the bridge over the tumbling waters of the Abhain Coire Mhic
Nobuil. Emerging from the wood and past a little lochan surrounded by
rhododendrons, you will suddenly come into dramatic open scenery,
dominated by Beinn Alligin.
The church is well worth a visit. Passing through Rechullin the track
becomes a road, now higher above the loch, leading to Inveralligin and
its charming quayside cottages. The road out of Inveralligin is steep,
but after joining the main Diabaig road there follows a delightful
two-mile stroll down this high single-track road which offers splendid
panoramic views of Loch Torridon and its mountains.
Halfway down this road you will find a seat conveniently placed for
taking lunch. The views from this point are magnificent. As the road
begins to descend above Torridon church look for a gate on the
right-hand side indicating a steepish path (the only rough bit on the
whole walk) leading down to the church, from whence you can walk back to
Fasag through the wooded estate grounds.
For mountain ascents (to be undertaken only if you are experienced and
properly equipped) there are 33 fine mountains over 2000 feet (606m) to
choose from. The most famous of these, Liathach, Beinn Eighe, Beinn
Dearg, Baosbheinn, and Maol Chean Dearg are monsters. I suggest a less
frequented Munro, in the southern Torridon group, Beinn Liath Mhor (the
big grey mountain) (OS sheet 25, ref 965520). Total distance nine miles;
ascent 3000ft in easy stages; total time seven hours. An expedition for
experienced hill-walkers, there are no scares, but it is connoisseur
stuff.
This is a huge mountain and the approach from Achnashellach is arduous
and challenging. But its graceful summit (3044ft) is at the Torridon
(west) end of the ridge and the approach from this direction is
delightful, dramatic, but free from exposure. You can leave your car at
the head of Glen Torridon car-park (957568) and take the path 30 yards
down (east) on the opposite side of the road leading to the clearly
visible white Ling Hut (cottage), and follow this fine little stalkers'
path, as it ascends gently, crossing four burns, until it peters out
after about two miles (952539).
At this point strike off left (south-east) across some purgatorially
unpleasant heather and rock-stewn hummocky ground, permeated by small
burns, which yields, after a few hundred yards, to steeper but much
easier rocky ground which will lead you to the Lochans Uaine. Aiming
always more left, towards Sgurr nan Lochan Uaine (Beinn Liath Mhor's
smaller neighbour), to avoid the slippery rock terraces below your
summit, the arrival at the lochans is a delight, but Beinn Liath Mhor's
summit looks a bit formidable from this viewpoint. Passing south between
the lochans, easy grass slopes lead to the summit's base and a final
exhilarating, but unexposed, scramble up shattered quartzite rocks to
the summit itself, which you share with the summit cairn. The views of
Sgorr Ruadh's plunging precipices across the valley are awesome.
A return by the way you came is a built-in safety factor, and the
views of Liathach's southern terraces are superb, but more experienced
and energetic walkers may prefer to take in Sgurr nan Lochan Uaine's
summit on the way down. The final two miles back down the Ling path is
good going for tired feet, as you head towards you car and the reward of
that Thermos of hot tea and slice of fruit-cake.
Hill-walking can be dangerous, but mountains themselves are harmless
lumps. They don't come up and hit you. The enemies are gravity, wind,
wet, cold, snow, avalanches, ice, mist, burns in spate, exhaustion, and
getting lost.
So one should gain experience slowly and methodically, and always
leave a record of one's intentions. Two very experienced mountaineers
(Cam MacLeay at Annat and Martin Moran at Achintee) run well-organised
group mountaineering and training activities in the area.
Visiting a wild and remote region is one thing; living there is quite
another. One must have a purpose other than just admiring the scenery. I
went to live in Torridon, not only for the hill-walking, but to see if I
could get myself established as an artist.
I have managed to get exhibitions throughout Scotland and also with a
local gallery run by friends of mine in Shieldaig which is open most of
the time. When not walking, painting is my full-time occupation.
As I explored the Torridon mountains (many of them trackless) I also
began to keep detailed records of possible routes of ascent and of good
walks. These culminated in Torridon, A Walker's Guide, which gives
details of some 60 varied local walks, specially written for the modest
(but experienced) hill-walker.

Factfile:
THERE are hotels at Torridon (Annat), Shieldaig, Kinlochewe,
Lochcarron, Achnasheen, and Loch Maree which also do meals and/or bar
meals for non-residents. There is a youth hostel at Torridon. B &amp; Bs are
generally in adequate supply and there are caravan and/or camping sites
at Kinlochewe, Torridon, Shieldaig, and Applecross. Details are easily
obtained from the Scottish Tourist Board Information Centres at
Inverness and North Kessock and by inquiring locally.
To reach Torridon by road from the South, the A9 to Inverness, then
A832 to Ullapool, turning left after Garve (signposted to Gairloch),
A832 to Kinlochewe, then left (A890) to Shieldaig, is quicker than the
tremendously spectacular route up the West Coast via Tyndrum, Glencoe,
Fort William (A82) to Invergarry, A87 to Kintail and A890 to Lochcarron;
but the latter takes an hour or so longer.
Three trains a day run from Inverness on the Kyle line to Torridon's
nearest station, Strathcarron, but only the 10.30am (arriving at
Strathcarron 12.30) is met by Duncan MacLellan's minibus (not Sunday)
which will take you to Lochcarron, Shieldaig, and Torridon (but check
current train times). The sleeper service from Euston to Inverness is
not at present under threat as is the Fort William line.
It is a distinct advantage to have a car in Torridon to take you to
the beginning of your walks, but Post ''buses'' (red cars) buzz around
the region daily, the times of which are available locally.

The Young Pretender was not the only one who indulged in make-believe.
People see in the Bonnie Prince exactly what they want to see, says
George Rose. Thus the image prevails of a handsome hero rather than of
the sad and often violent drunk who died in Rome decades after his
ill-conceived efforts in Scotland.
HISTORY resounds in the strangest ways. According to that most urbane
of actors, David Niven, the film Bonnie Prince Charlie '' . . . was one
of those huge florid extravaganzas that reeked of disaster from the
start''. Like the Jacobite rebellion itself, the film was more or less
made up as it went along. ''There was never a completed screenplay,'' he
wrote in his autobiography, The Moon's a Balloon, ''and never at any
time during the eight months that we were shooting were the writers more
than two days ahead of the actors''.
Halfway through the shoot, and alarmed at the developing chaos, Niven
fired off a telegram to Sam Goldwyn, head of MGM in Hollywood. It read:
''NOBODY CAN TELL ME HOW THIS STORY ENDS STOP ADVISE STOP''. Goldwyn
never replied. Like the star and the screenwriters (and no doubt the
director) the mogul had no idea. Tinsteltown was baffled. And the end
result was, to be charitable, a less than definitive account of the
great Jacobite rising of 1745-46.
Which -- as the American historian Susan Maclean Kybett has hinted --
might be a handy metaphor for Charles Edward Stuart's insurrection. It
was ill-conceived, badly-planned, messily executed, less than a year in
the making, brilliant in places and culminated in failure. The elegant
young man at the heart of it proved no guarantee of success. And it left
behind enough loose ends and false trails to baffle the most earnest
historian. We are still seeking advice on how this story ends. And like
Sam Goldwyn, we have no answers.
What we do know is that ''Bonnie Prince Charlie'' is still with us.
Enough, at least, to have hundreds of Scots chipping in #1000 each to
make the 1994 film Hunting the Deer as a new generation of film makers
tried to pin down the events of 1745-46. And for the rest of this year
and much of next the ghost of Charles will be stalking our television
screens and newspapers. It was 250 years ago tomorrow that Charles set
foot on Cladach a Phrionnsa (the Prince's beach) on Eriskay in the Outer
Hebrides. He has been in Scotland ever since.
The obese old drunk who died farting and belching in Rome in January
1788 has come a long way since then. History has been good to him. His
40-odd years in exile after Culloden have been either forgotten or
ignored. His hopeless plotting, endless whingeing, tiresome intrigues,
and remorseless spongeing on his ''fellow'' rulers have all been brushed
under history's carpet.
Nobody recalls the six bottles of heavy Cyprus wine he sank every day.
Even his brutal rape of his young (if unpleasant) wife Louise has been
overlooked. The fact that his every silly move in Rome and Florence was
recorded by Britain's spymaster -- the creepy Sir Horace Mann -- counts
for not very much. All that has been forgotten.
Because Charles is defined by his time in Scotland. July 1745 to
September 1746 is all we remember. The image he left is that of the
charismatic, 25-year-old Stuart prince who strolled into Edinburgh
''with a few friends'', took the ladies of the capital by storm, whipped
General John Cope at Prestonpans, crashed into England as far south as
Derby, retreated back to Scotland, fought a British army to a standstill
at Falkirk, met his nemesis at Colloden, then was hunted for months
across the heather before slipping back to France. By then his health
was probably undermined by scurvy induced by his ''flight across the
heather''.
Historians and Jacobite buffs are still arguing over whether Charles
could have won had he pressed on from Derby. From the vantage point of
250 years on that seems very unlikely. Charles had walked into a
strategic trap. He could not succeed without the help of the French. The
French would not help until he raised an army. He could not raise an
army until he got French help. So he had to make do with what he had.
Which was not much. His Highlanders were born raiders, skirmishers,
ambushers. They could move fast, strike hard, and melt into the mist.
They may well have been the best light infantry in Europe. But wars are
not won by light infantry alone. Wars are won by well-trained,
well-supplied infantrymen, logistical support, skilled engineers and,
above all, artillery. The Jacobites had few such assets. On Culloden
Moor their military poverty showed with disastrous results.
But even if Charles had managed to engineer a Stuart comeback it would
almost certainly have been a disaster. It could not have been done
without the support of the French. The price for that support would
probably have been some attempt to reinstate Roman Catholicism in
Britain. And the consequences of that would have been civil war that
would have made the Jacobite insurrection look like a scuffle in a pub.
The Young Pretender's venture was, in fact, ruinous. Nothing was
gained, and much was lost. Cameron of Lochiel had it right when he
warned Charles that the time was not propitious. The brutal shock of
Culloden and its aftermath virtually put paid to Gaelic society. The
Highland clans who supported Charles paid a terrible price. The rest
were stigmatised as treacherous and unreliable. Most of the Jacobite
clans were Episcopalians, a fact that the Episcopal Church took a
hundred years to recover from.
The Duke of Cumberland argued that Edinburgh should be punished for
its (short-lived) Jacobite enthusiasm by being stripped of its status as
Scotland's capital. That prize, he said, should go to Glasgow whose
citizenry had proved their loyalty to King George. Which, in fact, was
not so much a tribute to the House of Hanover as an expression of
distaste for the Roman Catholic Stuarts. The memory of the ''Killing
Times'' of the 1680s was still alive among the Presbyterians of the
west.
Charles's escapade also widened the Lowland/Highland divide. The
feeling grew that Scotland would be better off without its Gaels. A kind
of Anglo-Saxon ethnicity flourished. Ethnic cleansing crept on to the
agenda. By the 1850s The Fifeshire Journal was declaring that
''Ethnologically the Celtic race is an inferior one . . . destined to
give way . . . before the higher capabilities of the Anglo Saxon.''
This racist analysis was shared by The Scotsman which pointed out that
the Celtic folk of Barra in Scotland and Kerry in Ireland were in the
same pickle of '' . . . hopeless, listless, actionless, useless,
penury'' and that it was in Scotland's (and Britain's) interests '' . .
. to get rid of all these classes''.
There is a sour irony here. The Celts whom the Lowland press had
defined as untermenschen and wanted ''improved out'' were by then the
darlings of England. By the end of the eighteenth century tartans and
bagpipes were no longer regarded as weapons of war. Versions of Highland
dress became fashionable among London Scots. In the 1822 the ample
figure of George IV, tricked out in tartans and flesh-coloured tights,
was parading around Holyrood House where, 70 years before, Charles
Edward Stuart had entranced the ladies of Edinburgh with his soirees.
The rehabilitation of Charles was completed in the 1840s by Queen
Victoria. In a remarkable piece of dynastic legerdemain she assumed his
mantle. ''Stewart blood is in my veins,'' she declared to her journal,
''and I am now their representative, and the people are as devoted and
loyal to me as they were to that unhappy race.'' And while she did not
think much of the Jacobite monument at Glenfinnan (''a sort of
lighthouse'') she thrilled to the idea of the Jacobite rising itself.
''What a scene it must have been in 1745!'' she warbled to herself.
Victoria's enthusiasm was crucial. With her ''laying on of hands'' it
was safe for Charles's ghost to come out of the woodwork. His shade grew
more luminous as the heights of Scotland became the height of fashion.
All of Scotland became defined by Highland scenery and Highland mores.
Every family became a ''clan''. Every Scots regiment was forced into
tartans. And the hard-headed, essentially Presbyterian, culture which
produced David Hume, Adam Smith, Francis Hutcheson, and the Adam
brothers became defined by the inanities of Balmorality and Highlandism.
The gaudy myth of the Young Pretender and his Jacobite followers has
now more or less taken over Scotland's identity. Scottish nationalism
has been wrapped in a bolt of ''Royal Stewart'' tartan from which it has
never managed to escape. This identification of political nationalism
with the tawdry glamour of Jacobitism may be one reason -- and an
important one -- why so many Scots are reluctant to ''come out''. We
know in our bones that Jacobitism is reactionary, undemocratic, and
backward-looking.
All of which raises a string of questions. How did it happen? Just how
did the ghosts of Charles Edward Stuart and his ''tail'' of Jacobite
clansmen contrive to commandeer so much? Plainly, the reasons are many
and various. One of them is that every nation needs its heroes.
Stateless nations like Scotland need them more than most. Like Robert
Burns and (God help us) the Scottish football team Charles suffers from
a kind of transferred nationalism. He has become one of the ways in
which we define ourselves.
The historian Murray Pittock has suggested that the Stuarts -- and in
particular Bonnie Prince Charlie -- have become secular Messiahs. And
unlike most other legendary British figures such as Cuchullainn, King
Arthur, or Owen Glyndwr they are (or at least were) flesh and blood. And
well-documented flesh and blood at that. We can look at their portraits
and read their handwriting. Just as the beheaded Charles I became a
saint to ''high'' Anglicans, his great-great grandson became a kind of
secular saint to twentieth-century Scots.
Pittock also argues that Jacobite Scotland is a safe Scotland, which
is why Charles Edward Stuart is cherished. Scotland's real institutions
-- the Kirk, the law, education -- have weight and political clout. If
push came to shove they could be ''rallying points'' for national
identity. ''Better the burns, broadswords and tartans of a Jacobitism
sentimentalised into Tory nostalgia,'' Pittock writes, ''than the
industrial or institutional realities of the Lowlands.'' Jacobitism, in
other words, is one of the Anglo-British state's instruments of
political and social control. And Charles is its commissar.
But the extraordinary fact is that Charles Edward Stuart appeals as
much to the Sentimental Left as he does to the Sentimental Right. Every
folk-singer in the land seems to believe that the Jacobites were
left-wing revolutionaries and that Charles was some kind of
eighteenth-century Che Guevara. While Britain's toffs were purloining
the ''Garb of Old Gaul'' to go prancing about the heather, the radicals
of industrial Scotland were scribbling Jacobin words to Jacobite tunes.
For many years Glaswegians sang ''The Red Flag'' to the tune of ''The
White Cockade''.
This political confusion refuses to go away. And as that shrewd
observer Hugh Miller pointed out (in 1845) nobody was more confused than
that other great Scottish icon, Robert Burns. Miller wrote: ''The
Jacobite of one year who addressed enthusiastic verses to the 'revered
defenders of Beauteous Stuart' and composed the 'Chevalier's Lament' had
become in the next the uncompromising Jacobin who wrote 'A Man's a Man
for a' That'.'' In Miller's view, Burns was a man who did not know his
Erse from his elbow.
Miller was born and raised in Easter Ross, where Highland and Lowland
Scotland dovetail into one another. He had a powerful sense of both
cultures. Nobody wrote more bitterly about the wickedness of the
Highland Clearances. Nobody was more passionate in defence of the Gaels
trying to scratch a living from a beautiful but harsh landscape. But he
saw nineteenth-century Jacobitism as so much ''laughing gas'', something
which contained '' . . . vastly more of the bizarre than of the solemn .
. . ''
Miller was right. He is still right. What he called the ''Jacobite
domino'' still has ''bells to its cap''. They tinkle every time a
Paisley chartered accountant or a Falkirk estate agent climbs into what
he thinks is his ''national dress''. Above the waist -- black jacket,
white shirt, wing collar and bow tie. Below the waist -- kilt, sporran,
hose and brogues. The result is half Highland reiver, half dance-band
leader. Bonnie Prince Charlie out of Victor Silvester. Scotland the
Sartorial.
Of course, hijacking the symbols of a defeated and dispossessed people
is not peculiar to the Scots. The New Zealand rugby team do it every
time they perform their pre-match ''Hukka'', which is a sanitised
version of a Maori war dance. White Americans do it when they plaster
cigarette packets and oilcans with feathered head-dresses. Australians
happily regard aboriginal boomerangs and didgeridoos as essential props
for their role on the world stage. The descendants of the Spanish
conquistadors ruthlessly exploit the art and sculpture of the Aztec
civilisation they destroyed.
But nowhere have the icons of a defeated culture become so central as
in Scotland. And within that iconography nobody is more prominent than
Bonnie Prince Charlie. His face (and form) are not hard to find. For
example, every bottle produced by the Drambuie Liqueur Company Ltd
sports an image of the man himself along with the legend (or at least
the claim) that the recipe was handed to one of the Mackinnon family ''
. . . as a reward for his services''. The sweetish concoction is
described as ''Prince Charles Edward's Liqueur''.
Even more enthusiastic marketers of Charles are Walkers Shortbread Ltd
of Aberlour, on Speyside. Just about every tin of their buttered
shortbread is emblazoned with a sugary Victorian portrait of the Great
Caledonian Loser; in his primped and powdered adolescent glory; kissing
the hand of an unlikely-looking Flora Macdonald; standing in a boat at
the end of Loch nan Uamh, surrounded by grieving admirers, about to
leave Scotland for the last time.
There are shops all over Scotland that do brisk business selling (or
hiring) ''Highland Dressware'' comprising ''Prince Charlie Coatee''
silver-mounted sporran, lace jabots, ''gillie'' shoes, chequered hose,
stocking tabs, kilt pins, and sgian dubh. This elaborate paraphernalia
does not come cheap. Forty or fifty pounds a night seems to be the going
rate for hire; #1500 to buy the set outright; another meaning to the
famous Jacobite charge.
But, to the loser goes the spoils. The Drambuie Liqueur Company and
Walkers Shortbread are two of the most successful companies in Scotland.
Their profit/turnover ratio makes happy reading. The Mackinnon family
who own Drambuie have waxed rich peddling the Prince's dram. They are
now dedicated Neo-Jacobites. One of the conference rooms in their
company HQ in Edinburgh is decked out like the French ship L'Heureux
which spirited Charles away to France in 1746. The lesson is clear.
Nothing succeeds like Jacobite failure.
Because Charles is the marketing man's dream. He is a media-friendly
hero. Bekilted and bedirked, certainly, but with perfumed manners and a
cosmopolitan air. He is British royalty, the courts of Europe, and the
mist-wrapped Highlands rolled into one. He is coarse wool tartans and
the finest of silks. He is a handsome, weather-beaten face under the
most elegant of powdered wigs. He is the toff who is ready to rough it
and mix.
This is a beguiling image. It is one which the House of Windsor
replicates every time they regale us with their holiday snaps from the
hillsides around Balmoral. They stand grinning, tricked out in the
tartan designed for them by their German ancestor Prince Albert. And the
ghost of Charles Stuart is peering out over their shoulders.
Which brings us back to the flop Hollywood made of David Niven in
Bonnie Prince Charlie. Because Charles is something of a cultural
conundrum. Given the power of his myth why has he produced no great
fiction? There are plenty of Jacobite adventure stories, most of the
tales of derring-do across the heather. Stevenson's Kidnapped is the
best of the genre. But, so far, no Tolstoy, no Dostoevsky, and certainly
no Shakespeare to mark the meteoric rise and long, bitter decline of the
Young Pretender.
That conundrum may explain the silence of Sam Goldwyn. When confronted
with the question how does this story end, he had no answer. Perhaps the
shrewd old Jewish showman knew an enigma when he saw one. Maybe he
sensed that people would see in Charles Edward Stuart exactly what they
wanted to see. Which, of course, is the mark of a true legend.

When Bonnie Prince Charlie set foot on British soil it was on the
remote island of Eriskay. David Ross and photographer Paul Hackett
follow the footsteps which paved the way for the defeat, tragedy, and
myths to come.
EXACTLY 250 years ago tomorrow, Prince Charles Edward Stuart took his
first steps on British soil, or to be more precise sand, when he landed
with only seven followers on the remote and beautiful island of Eriskay.
So began the most romanticised and celebrated, if rarely understood,
episode in Scottish history.
Bonnie Prince Charlie was to capture an international imagination in
the two-and-a-half centuries following his decision to bring on the
Highland people the greatest of calamities, by choosing them as his
launch pad to regain the British Crown for his father.
It was to end so badly for him on Culloden field the following April,
but the Highlanders' troubles were only beginning. On September 20 he
sailed away on board a French frigate never to return to Scotland. He
left a legend behind, however, which will never leave -- although
Eriskay does not always feature prominently in its telling.
In fact, Eriskay had been chosen carefully by Jacobite agents for its
proximity to the staunchly Jacobite island of South Uist, Clanranald
MacDonald country. Signals had been prepared.
But today there are not many stones on the small cairn which sits amid
the marram grass above the Prince's Strand on Eriskay.
But there is little point in building large structures on Eriskay when
it is easier to look out over the white sand to the almost indescribable
beauty of the blue and green waters in the Sound of Barra. You can
imagine the French frigate Du Teillay lying at anchor as her passengers
are taken ashore, walking up the strand and into history.
One thing they didn't walk into was a large reception party -- at most
there would have been only four families living on Eriskay at that time.
They were employed looking after the island's cattle for Alexander
MacDonald of Boisdale (Big Alasdair of the Cows) who, despite being the
brother of the chief of Clanranald, was apparently the real strong man
in Uist at the time, the former preferring strong drink to direct
action.
There is evidence that Eriskay had supported a considerably larger
population in the previous century when the Franciscan Friars would
visit from France. But it is thought possible that some may have ended
up in Saothach-nan-Daoine, the ship of the people, which in 1739 had
taken ordinary people from the Skye lands of both Sir Alexander
MacDonald of Sleat and MacLeod of MacLeod to be sold into slavery as
bonded servants in the Americas.
This rather shady business had allowed Forbes of Culloden, the Lord
President of the Court of Session, to blackmail, rather than prosecute,
these two gentlemen into declaring themselves as Hanoverian, and it
might have explained Boisdale's reluctance to join the Jacobite side.
The first man the Prince met in Eriskay was Angus MacDonald in whose
house he, along with some others caught by the weather, spent an
uncomfortable night because of the smoke; the Young Pretender was unused
to houses with a fire but no chimney. MacDonald was to recall of the
Prince: ''What a plague is the matter with that fellow that he can
neither sit nor stand still, and neither keep within nor without
doors?''
Doubtless he would have been pleased by the arrival of his social
superior, Boisdale, who advised Charles that neither Sleat nor MacLeod
would support him and that he should go home. Charles's moving if
inaccurate answer was that he had come home. He sailed away the next day
for Loch nan Uamh.
In fact Charles had planned to come back to Eriskay after Culloden to
make good his escape to France, but his boat was blown off course and he
landed in Loch Uisgebhagh on the east coast of Benbecula. On June 28,
1746, from the south side of that sea loch the Prince, disguised as
Betty Burke, crossed to Skye with Flora MacDonald.
This is a point which seems to be missed by many watching the
finishing touches being put to the Skye Bridge, unmovable in their
conviction that the Prince's bonnie boat had sped across the Kyle of
Lochalsh like a bird on the wing. In reality, the Prince never even saw
the Kyle of Lochalsh.
A fascinating insight into this adventure and the extraordinarily
complicated politics of the time is afforded us in Alasdair Maclean's
and John S Gibson's authoritative Summer Hunting a Prince: the Escape of
Charles Edward Stuart.
''It was to the Prince in the cave behind Beinn Ruigh Chonnich (in
South Uist) that a messenger brought a suprising proposal from none
other than Hugh MacDonald of Armadale, who commanded the MacDonald
militia company ostensibly hunting for him in South Uist. This was to
the effect that the Prince should be disguised as a woman and ferried
over to Skye as maidservant to Flora MacDonald, a young gentlewoman of
the Milton family of South Uist who was also Armadale's step-daughter.''
Armadale even went as far as to send a letter to his wife on Skye to
lend credence to the whole project: ''I have sent your daughter from
this country lest she should be anyway frightened with the troops lying
here. She has got one Betty Burke, an Irish girl who, as she tells me,
is a good spinster. If her spinning pleases you may keep her till she
spin all your lint; or if you have any wool to spin you may employ her .
. .''
Whatever, the Prince never did return to Eriskay, which stayed well
away from the nation's attention until 1941 when the the Harrison Line's
SS Politician ran aground on Calvay between Eriskay and South Uist. This
gave the islanders Whisky Galore, Compton Mackenzie a great idea for a
book, and consequently the Ealing Studios a smash hit, albeit on
location in Barra.
In the years between the Princes's departure and the SS Politician's
arrival, however, plenty was to happen on Eriskay.
It won itself a population again, although it came at a sore price and
found it hard to keep it. According to a well-researched leaflet from
Western Isles Enterprise: ''By 1841 there were 80 people living on
Eriskay. Ten years later in the year of the 1851 Census, there were 405
inhabitants. The population growth is accounted for by the infamous
Clearances when impoverished clan chiefs and incomer landlords put the
people off the land to make way for sheep.
''Eriskay was considered to be too barren to be worth the landlord's
attention, so the islanders were left alone. Less fortunate folk from
neighbouring Hellisay, and from various parts of the Western Isles came
to settle here. The faint ridges of old 'lazy beds' in parts of the
island where a thin layer of soil covers the rock are evidence of the
struggle to grow enough corn and potatoes to feed the crofting families.
''The Crofters Commission of 1886 says: 'Eriskay was inhabited by one
Cameron, one Ferguson and one MacDonald with their families and maybe a
few shepherds and herds.' The rest had given up the unequal struggle to
survive and taken ship from Lochboisdale to Canada, to the USA, or to
Glasgow and the South. In 1888, however, the Bishop of Argyll and the
Isles referred to the 500 people on Eriskay who needed their own
priest.''
That was the level of population when the present priest, Father Calum
MacLellan, was a boy on the island. But when The Herald visited last
month it stood at 161; one recent death cancelled out by one birth.
The priest has always been an important figure in Eriskay; indeed the
largest monument in the island's graveyard is to an earlier incumbent of
the post, Father Allan MacDonald. Father Allan was a remarkable man.
Coming from Lochaber originally, he came to Eriskay in 1894 and built a
new church to replace the thatched building which had served the
spiritual needs of the islanders since 1852.
But he did much more, as Father MacLellan explains: ''He was a poet, a
bard and a Gaelic scholar making important collections of folk-tales and
producing a dictionary of words from Uist and Eriskay. He inspired many
other scholars at the time.''
Father Allan was to die on the island in 1905, at the age of just 46.
Ian Grimble recalls that, before his death: ''His island suffered a
novel form of exploitation. An unscrupulous charlatan named Ada Goodrich
Freer wheedled his papers out of him and used them to publish articles
and a book in which she was able to pose as an expert on Hebridean
folklore, although ignorant of its very language. Much of Father Allan's
material was rendered valueless by this treatment, and many of his
papers went missing.''
Despite this, Father MacLellan believes his poetry remains important,
and particularly his poem Eilean-na-h-Oige the Island of Youth, which he
describes as being ''in praise of Eriskay, and quite beautiful''.
Eriskay's description as the ''Island of Youth'' is not entirely
inappropriate. Although the population has fallen dramatically in the
past 50 years, the 1991 census shows that only about 12% of its
population is over 65. This compares well with other islands, like
Harris, where pensioners make up 25% of the population, or Berneray,
where the figure stands at 28%. There are 25 pupils in Eriskay's school,
which teaches up to year two of secondary education before pupils go on
to the Sgoil Lionacleit in Benbecula.
Father MacLellan, who was the first vice-convener of the Western Isles
Council in 1974 and who is a past chairman of Comunn na Gaidhlig, is
convinced that the biggest single thing that would help the island
regain population today would be a causeway to neighbouring South Uist.
Because of the sizeable ebb in the Sound of Eriskay, the island is
without a ferry for at least six hours during the day. It is often into
the afternoon before a ferry can get across.
''There is not a great expectation here of anything. Most just want a
quiet life, but at the same time most want a causeway,'' says Father
MacLellan
''We were very disappointed that Comhairle nan Eilean decided, in
their wisdom, to put Eriskay at the bottom of the list, although their
consultants' report did state that it was the most socially deprived.
''But they also said this is the island you would get the least
economic return on an investment of #11m in a causeway. They were more
likely to get a return on the island of Scalpay. To us it seemed that
Scalpay had a good daylight ferry service, two or three minutes
across.''
Now a study is being undertaken, examining the introduction of a
triangular service between Barra, Eriskay and South Uist, shifting the
Eriskay terminal away from the sound to the south-west side of the
island.
''That would be an improvement at least,'' says Father MacLellan.
''It would allow people to work on Uist or Barra -- it would give us a
regular service. At the moment you can't really start a business or
anything. It is the single biggest issue on the island.''
In the island's pub, The Politician, with the Harrison Line flag
flying outside, there is agreement from Michael MacInness -- a local who
works on the Irish ferries and who finds that, at times, he can have
great difficulty in coming home for holidays. ''You can spend more than
#200 on an air ticket to come from Glasgow to Benbecula and then drive
down the length of South Uist only to be left sitting looking across at
Eriskay for six hours,'' he says.
The erratic ferry service has certainly stunted growth in tourism
based development, in what could be a very popular destination. But the
potential is enormous. A good natural harbour is now attracting the more
adventurous of the summer sailors.
Some local crofters have also carved out a six-hole golf course which
must be one of the most picturesque anywhere. According to one of the
founder members, Willie Rusk, who was taking time off from the ferry he
runs to Barra in order to tend to the course's lawns, the club can boast
members in Japan and Canada.
''A few of us got together and decided to give it a try. We opened
last year with senior subscriptions at #25. It seems to have gone well.
The young ones are very keen,'' says Rusk.
This was corroborated by Calum MacIsaac, 11, Ronnie MacInnes, 9, and
his cousin Duncan MacInnes. They all play and think the #5 junior
membership good value.
They are growing up in a most beautiful place, but one where life will
never be easy. Despite, or perhaps because of, that there is a strong
feeling of community. It can be no accident that one of last community
co-operatives still operational in the Highlands, Co-Chomunn Eirisgeidh
Ltd, is on the island. There is something very special about Eriskay,
certainly more important than a pile of stones on a machair.

During this Open weekend, William Hunter finds an informative slice of
golfing life in St Andrews.
FOR golf spectators at the Open championship the Old Course has been
extended. Nineteen holes go with this year's ticket. Included is a free
approach to the grassy knoll beside the clubhouse into which is bunkered
the British Golf Museum. For the duration of the tournament it has been
made an extra hospitality tent.
Onlookers are invited to see not just how the Open is going but where
it has come from.
And if St Andrews is wet, the Royal and Ancient hosts offer shelter
under the all-in umbrella of golf's history. Without the normal handicap
of #3.50, they are giving lessons in the ancient aspects of the R and A
sport.
For visitors who do not play the game the museum is a shrine to some
of the more agreeably heroic figures of any sporting lore. It provides
also a colourful slice (wrong word) of life that Scotland gave to the
world. And it provides a quiet refuge from the wool-mill shops and other
douce attractions of the grey town.
For golfers the museum offers the great secret of how to play the game
and in wise words that run to only one sentence (maybe two), although it
needs a keen eye kept on the ball to see them. Since this instruction
has been available for two centuries, it will keep a little while
longer.
To be going on with, let it be accepted that too much has been written
about golf. It absorbs more ink even than gardening, which the game of
many weekend players resembles. In an indirect reference one display at
the museum makes the point by declaring: ''The comments of some of the
golfing writers are too ridiculous to notice.''
The opinion appears in a 1910 advertisement by a firm of golf-ball
manufacturers as part of their complaint about how wildly the scribes go
on about the price of balls. Such few jokes as the museum allows centre
on balls.The sharpest whimsy is an 1899 cartoon about a shop where
players buy a reason to give in the clubhouse for having had a duff
round. Behind the shop counter, like an apothecary's cabinet,
ceiling-high drawers are labelled with specially selected excuses.
They include trees, sun, sea waves, and even shoe nails. Fool caddy is
another reason for failure that has exactly the right aggrieved tone.
In its scholarly and aseptic way -- no hint of mud or frozen mitts --
the museum is more concerned with sterner stuff than the banter
afterwards in the clubhouse bar. Officially, golf takes itself more than
a mite seriously. Calling itself royal and ancient, for instance,
stretches history's fairway. For early kingly connections (from 1457)
were about discouraging the sport. Palace edicts sought to ban the
pastime because it interfered with the nationally useful practice of
archery.
Queen Mary, however, had a jollier approach. She sought the solace of
the links after the death of Lord Darnley, her fresh-air exercise
earning her formal reproach. Besides, at nights, after her round, she
was guilty of ''abusing her body'' with the Earl of Bothwell.
Nor is the ancient part of the R and A so venerable. The modern game
became organised only about a century ago. It is how its pre-history
took form slowly, almost imperceptibly, that is one of its fascinations.
Peter Lewis, the director who five years ago created the museum, said:
''Somebody didn't wake up one day and say he'd thought of this great
game.
'' 'We'll play 18 holes, par 72, complete with handicapping; then
we'll form a club and do this, this, and this.' It wasn't like that.
''You are talking about things evolving over a very long time, and
really taking shape only about 100 years ago in a form that we
recognised today.''
Golf is as old as the idea that it would be fun to hit a stone with a
stick. The refinement that Scotland added was to put the ball in a hole
in the ground. In other countries it was preferred entertainment to
stick it through hoops or to aim for prominent targets. Trees or a wall
were favoured objects much as now, even at an Open, spectators can find
the roofs of their parked cars being struck or even the roofs of their
heads.
The sophistication of plugging the ball into the earth was all
Scotland's doing, no question.
Peter Lewis in his quiet American way said categorically: ''Golf as we
know it today emerged on the east coast of Scotland.
''It is impossible to say where it was first played. There is no
answer to to that question. But it certainly grew up somewhere between
here and the Edinburgh area, although there was more activity on the
west coast than was thought until a few years ago.''
Prestwick held the first Open after it was decided that a tourney
meant for professional players only should ''be open to all the world''.
Really it was a contest to find a successor to the formidable Allan
Robertson.
Golf's valhalla of individual heroes is the mightiest in sport. Thanks
to Peter Lewis's enthusiasm for electronic display, the modern giants
and their greatest moments can be viewed again with continuing awed
excitement.
But Allan Robertson (1815-59) -- with the brighter arithmetic attached
to his name of a record 79 over St Andrews in 1858 -- has to settle for
a still photograph and a lifeless tableau.
In his photo he looks a gallus wee man with a fine head of hair much
of it around his face. In his museum display the head is down. He is
engaged in the wearisome kitchen toil of stuffing a leather case with
boiled chicken feathers. Making balls was how the early gladiators of
the game eked out a living when they were not repairing clubs, scything
greens, or carting the bags of gentlemen players. It took Allan
Robertson all of a long day to turn out three or four featheries.
By contrast, this same backroom servant of the game was a buccaneer of
the links who once played for a bet of a scary #400, which he won in a
foursome with old Tom Morris for a partner.
One quest that even the British Golf Museum may never fulfil is a
search for the game's age of innocence, if ever it had one. The full
story cannot be told. For the card of its evolutionary centuries is
largely blank. Peter Lewis said: ''Until you get into the great boom of
the back half of the 1880s there is very little published. There is golf
literature prior to then, but it is a bit thin on the ground.''
Even before clubs were given numbers instead of homely names like the
mashie niblick and the baffy spoon, it was not the meek who inherited
the earth of parkland or links. Crazy wagers were a part of the game
long before Allan Robertson's time. And copious drinking was seen as
essential behaviour often before going out on the course. Trying to tame
a rough terrain may always have made golf an extension of jungle warfare
by other means.
Yet in some ways the complex, moneyed obsession of modern times may be
more innocent that was peasant pastime of the pioneers. For from about a
century ago also dates the fond belief that magic could be acquired with
new wands.
In 1892 appeared the centre-shafted club. In rapid order followed
gadgety tools that had two faces or adjustable heads. Torpedo clubs were
tried. Others had springs squeezed into them. Much romantic trust was
put into fairy-tale ironmongery.
Peter Lewis suggested that was not so much a sudden change of approach
to the game but more a reflection of the society of late-Victorian times
when doing the impossible was regarded as just another job that would
take a little longer to master.
''The rule of golf is that most people will always try something new,
if they think they can get longer off the tee or putt that much more
accurately,'' he said.
Yet the essential simplicity of the game was expressed away back in
1726. Its basic elements were investigated and inscribed by one Thomas
Kincaird, who reads like the resident sage of the St Andrews museum.
When a medical student at Edinburgh University, young Kincaid divided
the ancient game, like old Gaul, into three parts, of which the second
had to do with handicapping and the third with the merit of hitting the
ball with the meat of a club's head.
How he opened his brisk thesis in a diary he kept contains marvels of
condensed beauty and truth:
I found that the only way of playing at the golf is
(1) To stand as you do at fencing with the small sword, bending your
legs a little, and holding the muscles of your legs and back and arms
exceedingly bent or fixed and stiff, and not at all slackening them in
the time you are bringing down the stroke (which you readily do).
He is that saying golf is a lovely simple game to play, if only you
could.

The Herald's reviewers tune in to the best sounds.
Cheatin' Heart Attack, Dale Watson (Hightone)
* FROM the top-notch label which gave us the awesome axe-power of Dick
Dale, here's a quavery-voiced country-swing dude who's plainly the
conceptual offspring of George Jones and Willie Nelson. Yup, Dale
Watson's that good. As fiddles swell and pedal-steels weep, Dale
skilfully tugs our heart-strings as he tells us of bittersweet
motel-room assignations, and mommas who don't need daddies no more.
Hell, don't rattle your gums at me about no-marks like Chris Isaak and
Garth Brooks: Dale Watson is country-music bedrock.
Jungle Heat 95, Deep In The Jungle, various artists (Virgin)
* DRIVEN by infernal rhythms and liquid bass bloopings, reggae's
mutant brat goes from strength to strength, gaining in stylistic
diversity. This 16-track collection brings you updated dancehall
toasting from Trinity on Gangsta; Roni Size's sublime It's A Jazz Thing
(which is actually closer to being a mellow techno-funk thing); the
heady perfume which is Jazzmin by Cloud 9, and the floating ragga rap of
DJ Krust's Set Speed.
Granpa' Craw, Nyah Fearties (Lyt)
* PLOUGHING a lone furrow, Ayrshire's inventors of hip-hop
heedrum-hodrum continue to make a fierce auld racket with their
punked-up accordions, guitars, and fiddles. If the Proclaimers lived in
a barn in Lugton and supported Kilbirnie Ladeside instead of Hibernian,
they might sound something like this. Express your solidarity by writing
to the Fearties at 16 Burnside Cottages, Lugton, KA3 4DY.
DAVID BELCHER
Tales From the Sun, Tim Garland (EFZ)
* THE Lammas saxophonist hopes to stop people comparing him to Jan
Garbarek with this debut album. I'm not sure he'll succeed in that but
what he has produced is an eminently listenable jazz-Celtic music blend
with some excellent support from a band including June Tabor's pianist,
Huw Warren, and Lammas' drummer, Mark Fletcher.
A Train in the Distance, Hung Drawn Quartet (HDQ)
* GLASGOW's saxophone quartet play quirky, adventurous, clever, and
humorous tunes with little skill, a lot of imagination, and an obvious
but perfectly understandable (and acknowledged) debt to their New York
cousins from 29th Street.
ROB ADAMS
Prokofiev, Cinderella Suites 1-3 (Naxos)
* BUMPER pair of CDs from cheap label Naxos, featuring Prokofiev's
three suites to the ballet Cinderella. Superb recording, vividly and
brilliantly captured in the studio of the State Broadcasting Compmpany
of Ukraine, by the Ukranian State Symphony Orchestra with conductor
Theodore Kuchar. Prokofiev addicts will want to add this budget version
to their library. Well worth it -- very bright playing from the
Ukranians. The second disc also contains The Scythian Suite and the
Suite from the ballet On the Dnieper. Two CDs for a third of the regular
price: the value speaks for itself.
Shchedrin: Carmen Suite (Naxos)
* Rodion Shchedrin (still living) was the darling of the Soviets: the
acceptable face of Soviet music, none of that ambiguous, dissident
nonsense in his music. All of that's rubble under the wall now, of
course. His music is slightly dubious in its durability, but worth a
spin. This Carmen is Bizet's, rescored (for a ballet) for a large string
orchestra and a veritable platoon of percussion. It's a hoot. Ephemeral,
but entertaining. Ukranian State with Kuchar again.
MICHAEL TUMELTY
High Society (Capitol)
* THE splendid soundtrack for the 1956 musical is now out on CD, and
is a must for fans of any one of Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby or the
sumptuous Cole Porter score which includes such classics as True Love.
Bing's best on Little One, his crooning perfectly complemented by Louis
Armstrong's lovely trumpet obbligato; while Sinatra shines on You're
Sensational. They duet to memorable and humorous effect on Well Did You
Evah. Indeed, as Bing says: ''It's positively therapeutic''.

Trumpet master Joe Wilder has rediscovered jazz after years of studio
work, and record companies are finally recognising his talents to the
delight of Ken Gallacher.
LONG long before Wynton Marsalis erupted on to the jazz scene -- and
invaded the classical world too -- there was another black trumpeter who
took that same route unheralded.
Only now, are people realising that Joe Wilder has been a major talent
whose work has been neglected by record producers for almost 30 years.
Back in the late fifties Wilder made several albums under his own name
-- one on Savoy was a gem and included a glorious version of Noel
Coward's Mad about the Boy -- but after that his trumpet talents were
used in studio work, with classical orchestras, in brass quintets, and
behind top vocal stars including Billie Holiday, Lena Horne, Tony
Bennett, Johnny Mathis, and others.
And as Wilder pursued a lucrative career as a session man he drifted
away from the jazz world. If you caught him in a jazz context at all it
seemed almost accidental.
I have managed to catch him in person twice, once backing Rosemary
Clooney in front-line tandem with the tenor saxophonist Scott Hamilton,
and, again in different settings at Bob Haggart's 80th birthday bash
last year.
On each occasion that distinctive, lyrical tone sounded even better
than it had on record. His years in the studios and in theatre pit
orchestras had not affected his jazz feeling. Indeed, there seemed a
new-found freedom to his playing as if he was celebrating a welcome
release from the demands of the studios.
In the past 10 years, too, he has appeared on more records than he did
in the previous quarter of a century. To my knowledge he has been on two
albums and three CDs in that time, always in good company, and always
playing with the innate taste which is his trade mark.
Two of the CDs are under his own name, teaming him with musicians of
his own generation and also with younger men such as guitarist Jimmy
Chirillo who duets with him to superb effect on the unlikely vehicle of
an Elvis Presley song, Love me Tender.
There's another duet, too, with veteran pianist Bobby Tucker,
long-time accompanist to Billie Holiday on the vocalist's own song God
Bless the Child which brings tears to your eyes.
Wilder is enjoying his rediscovered jazz career. He says: ''I had
always wanted to play with the New York Philharmonic, to hold down one
of the trumpet chairs in that orchestra was a dream of mine. I never did
do that.
''I played with them several times but that was all. Still I was able
to do other work in the studios and in Broadway shows and it was always
fulfilling.
''Now with the studios all but shut down I can enjoy myself and
stretch out a little more in good company. I like that. Doing what I'm
doing now, playing jazz parties, making records, and playing concerts is
like starting all over again.''
What the modest Wilder does not tell you about is how he pioneered the
way for black musicians in the studios. He went on to staff at ABC in
1952, after another trumpeter, Billy Butterfield, recommended him and
sent him in as a sub when he couldn't make certain jobs.
Says Wilder: ''Billy was beautiful to me. He heard me play, obviously
liked what I was doing and he knew how well I could read and so he
pushed me in the session world. I had a long career out of that.''
Wilder was one of the first blacks to hold down a regular studio job.
The same kind of barriers existed in the classical world and, again, he
eventually broke them down. In the process he made it easier for younger
players such as Marsalis who came along with similar ambitions.
Wilder has never toured Britain but he told me: ''I'd like to come
over and maybe I'll get the chance now that I am hanging out with the
guys who go over there regularly. It's something I want to do because I
know from everyone how knowledgeable the audiences are.''
Apart from the CDs I have mentioned two more have just been issued.
One has him with pianist Dick Hyman and a stellar group which includes
trombonist Urbie Green, clarinettist Phil Bodner, tenorist Frank Wess,
and Scotland's own baritone star Joe Temperley. The other teams him with
another trumpet giant Clark Terry as well as the trombone veteran Al
Grey.
I await both with interest and anticipation. More on these will follow
. . .

There were a few prickly problems along the way but Anvar Khan is now
a smooth operator, and hopefully will be for several weeks.
WHEN you read this column I will be sunning myself in Gran Canaria. I
don't know exactly where it is but I know what I'll be wearing. I am
packing a black lycra number and an orange halter neck, both are bathing
suits, the Baywatch variety. But please do not think me vain. I suffered
in order to gain the privilege of wearing them.
Hair removal dates back to the time when man and woman decided,
collectively, that body hair was something undesirable. This must have
been way past the era when man was a subdivision of the primate, when
body hair was a defence against the cold, dirt, and insects.
Anyway, the point is that there is no really effective way to
eliminate the ''little fellas'' as my beauty therapist calls them. The
curly, coarse or fine hirsute elements of the human body are
conspicuous. Especially where one wants them least. There is no way out,
there is the bikini wax or shorts. With this in mind I hot-footed it to
my nearest salon.
Superfluous hair was removed from my armpit, both full legs and
bikini. (In case ''bikini'' sounds rather quaint, this delicate area is
always referred to as the bottom half of a swimsuit because the desire
to wear one is why women get it done in the first place.) The de-fuzzing
process took one hour and 20 minutes. I chose the waxing method, where
hot oil is applied to the skin and a cotton strip pressed on top of the
particular area. The strip is then lifted off at a fair pace, the way
you might a sticky plaster.
No, of course it is not sore. Why would plucking the very root of each
individual stem be anything less then relaxing? Women, it seems, are on
their backs, if you pardon the expression, during two main events in
life. Waxing and giving birth. Both compare because both lengthy trials
demand bad language and shouting to get yourself through.
As it is, waxing prevents hair regrowth for up to six weeks. You get a
flawless finish, Dulux-quality skin, and the peace of mind to wear a
bathing costume in confidence. So here's to my little cove on a white
sand beach. I am brown and happy, sipping cocktails in the sun. The
mandarin and plum fish design sarong I invested in before my departure
sits faithfully beside me, the edges flirting in the gentle breeze, just
in case those heat spots and lumps erupt again, in a tender place.
* Waxing treatment for hair removal is available at most salons. Try

Capturing wildlife on canvas is an art form out on its own, and one
which could net nature conservation a tidy sum. Liz Taylor hunts down
the best buys.
THE first wildlife artists drew charging bison on the walls of caves
in France and Spain. Since then the depiction of wild animals has
captured the imagination of artists and their patrons through the ages.
Next Thursday, July 27, Christie's are holding their second auction of
wildlife art created within the last 200 years. The first they held, in
June last year, raised a total of more than #600,000. It is hoped that
this year's event will do even better and a proportion of the proceeds
are to be donated to the World Wildlife Fund for Nature.
In the current event there are more than 400 paintings, drawings,
prints, and pieces of sculpture, all by internationally acclaimed
artists. Many of the animals portrayed are currently threatened with
extinction and the way they are depicted reflects the changed modern
attitude to wildlife. No longer are they shown as red in tooth and claw,
suitable subjects for slaughter, but in their natural, almost domestic
settings -- a female cougar playing with her cubs; sleeping jaguars and
tigers; a group of Arctic wolves that look as if they are holding a
matey conversation.
Last year the highest price paid was #110,000 for a painting by the
British artist David Shepherd who is keenly interested in wildlife
conservation and has already raised more than a million pounds for his
own Conservation Fund for Endangered Species. There are 10 works by him
in this year's sale including a magnificent study, Mountain Gorillas of
Rwanda, on which Christie's have put an estimate of between #40,000 and
#60,000.
This picture is already familiar to the public because it has been
sold as a limited-edition print and has raised #50,000 for the Diane
Fossey Gorilla Fund which will also benefit by the sale of the original
painting.
Other Shepherd works in the sale include Lion in the Bush (around
#25,000); African Evening (about #10,000); and Ice Wilderness (around
#12,000).
Famous as David Shepherd is, the title of the greatest living wildlife
painter is awarded by critics all over the world to New Zealand born Ray
Harris-Ching. He started his career in advertising and developed a
fascination for painting birds. In 1966 he came to Britain and soon won
a commission to paint 230 colour plates for the Reader's Digest Book of
British Birds. Although the publishers expected this project to take six
years, Harris-Ching completed it within 12 months.
His mastery lies in portraying the texture of feathers and fur and
this can be seen to magnificent effect in three pictures of his which
are up for sale at Christie's. One is of a black and white Diana monkey;
the second is entitled The Eye of the Storm and shows a young kangaroo
standing beside a group of pink cockatoos on a dry tree branch. The
third picture combines fur and feather because it shows Diana monkeys
and a squirrel improbably asleep among various birds including a
rooster, guinea fowl, a toucan, and an avocet. This picture, which
carries an estimate of up to #55,000, is entitled New Ark and
Harris-Ching wanted to show his subjects as if they were setting out on
some mysterious journey, an expression of his own fears for the future
of our planet.
A painter from the unregenerate days when wild animals were looked on
as legitimate prey for big-game hunters was William Kuhnert, a German
artist who lived from 1865 until 1926 and travelled extensively in
Africa and India with hunting parties. Many of his pictures were
destroyed during the Second World War but those which have survived are
much coveted by collectors and Christie's are including three in their
sale -- one of a proud tiger stalking its prey, another of a water buck,
and a third of a black rhinoceros. Top estimate is #50,000 for the
tiger.
Not all the prices in the sale are so exalted, however. Among the
bronze sculptures are some by Jan Sweeney, a currently working British
artist. Particularly eye-catching is a pair of running ostrichs which is
expected to sell for about #1000. In the lesser priced pictures there is
an eye-catching watercolour study of blackcock, pochard, and long-tailed
tits by a Sri Lankan artist called Gamini P Ratnavira (estimate around
#700), and another of a snowy owl sitting on a piece of broken stone
pediment in Pompeii by a young Dutch artist called Ulco Glimmerveen
(estimate around #800). An even younger painter, 25-year-old Jess
Stephens, is represented by a ''pattern'' of black, yellow, and white
penguins all in different attitudes (estimate between #600 and #800).
Most unexpected of all the lots are two cartoon-like studies of a
mandrill and a Florida panther, pencil and watercolour pictures which
are being sold on behalf of the Tusk charity. They are the work of Ron
Wood of the Rolling Stones who was a student at Ealing College of Art
before taking up music as a career. Christie's have put an estimate of
between #2500 and #3500 on Wood's pictures but the price reflects his
status as a pop idol as much as his skill as a painter.
MARKET NEWS.
SOME record prices were achieved at the sale of samplers which
Phillips held in Edinburgh on June 29 and was referred to in my article
of June 10. Scottish samplers did extremely well, particularly the one
made by Christian Hutchison of Macduff in 1843 which went for #3765
against an estimate of around #600. The sampler inscribed ''Helen Boyd
age 11 Perth 1812'' sold for #2590 (estimate between #400 and #500) and
the one with ''Sarah Wilson 1844 her sampler aged 14'' went for the top
price of #4000 (estimate around #1000).

Catherine Brown examines various moves by tomato growers to save their
skins in a highly competitive market.
BRING back tomato taste was the message. Forget intensively-fed,
over-pampered bland tomatoes grown exclusively for the British palate
and unsaleable elsewhere. So the range of tomato varieties was extended.
Greater tomato choice hit the shelves along with the sales pitch
''vine-ripened'' as ripeness became a quality carrying a premium price.
But why pay extra for a ripe tomato? Ripeness is, after all, the
natural maturing process. Tomatoes contain water, sugar, acid, vitamins,
and minerals which should produce a flavour worth paying for.
Tell us more, instead, about whether the tomato flavour is sweet
rather than sour, so we can work out its usefulness in the kitchen. Tell
us if it has been grown indoors or outside, where it is more likely to
have developed a concentration of minerals, known in the trade as
''saltiness''. Is it a tomato which has been over-watered for maximum
yield or does it have a higher proportion of dry matter, rich in flavour
compounds, particularly magnesium and potassium? Tell us also about its
texture since we do not want a tough skin for eating, but it will not
matter if its going into a soup.
Caught up in the ripeness cachet is the method of distribution from
grower to point of sale. It makes sense that if you pick an under-ripe
tomato and transport it -- or store it -- in a chilled environment for
several days it cannot achieve its maximum flavour punch. Tomatoes are a
sub-tropical fruit and at a temperature of five degrees centigrade --
for whatever time -- they will object by deteriorating rather than
improving in texture and flavour.
Large-scale distribution of tomatoes has great difficulty overcoming
the problems of ripening, yet this is the time of year when we would
expect to find tomatoes at their peak of flavour when the springtime
push for growth is past and they have ripened and matured on the vine
naturally.
Which is where the consortium of six growers producing Scotland's
Tomatoes from the Clyde Valley made their ripeness point last year by
selling Scotland a riper-picked tomato than their competitors in
Holland.
''The majority of our production is to supermarkets in Scotland,''
says Jim Craig, chairman of the group. ''We have concentrated on growing
a 'standard' tomato to a high quality rather than developing the more
unusual niche market varieties which have only a minimal sale in
Scotland. Our strength is that we can get a better-tasting ripe tomato
faster on to the shelves because we do not have to pick under-ripe.''
Supplying to Asda, Safeway, and M &amp; S, mainly a round variety known as
Solario, they have still to overcome the problem of supplying to the
Tesco stores in Scotland, recently taken over from the Wm Low chain. The
bulk of Tesco's fruit and vegetable distribution, says Craig, is done by
a central distribution unit in the North of England which would mean
Scotland's tomatoes travelling there and back in an unfriendly chilled
environment before reaching the shelves, adding extra cost and reducing
the ripeness quality.
Also linked to the ripeness factor, and heavily promoted by the Dutch
this year, are the bunches of tomatoes still attached to the vine.
''Trussed'' tomatoes, ripened-on-the-vine, were originally introduced to
overcome criticism by the Green lobby in Germany who, rightly or
wrongly, saw the Dutch intensively-produced tomatoes as environmental
hazards.
In an effort to rebuild falling sales in both Germany and the UK,
Dutch trussed tomatoes are now being sold as a more natural product with
a better, riper flavour. The catch, however (in addition to their
premium price), is that in order to allow the fruit to ripen more fully
before picking the tomato the variety must have a tougher skin.
''There is also,'' says Gerry Haymen, horticultural adviser to a
number of tomato growers, ''the problem for the growers of more wastage
if the tomatoes are handled carelessly and knocked off the vine in
transit. Then there is the problem for the retail outlets of sneaky
customers who remove the tomatoes from the vine and pass them off as
standard tomatoes.''
The future, it seems, for the premium-priced tomato truss is
uncertain. In my tasting of a dozen or so different tomato varieties
they did not rate highly for flavour and the skin was certainly tougher
than other eaters.
SEASONWATCH
THE first spring lamb may appear around Easter in Italy: the Scots
have a longer wait. ''Scottish lamb is at its peak of quality around the
end of July,'' says a spokesman for a large lamb wholesaler in the South
West. 'It is also a very good buy at the moment.''
Should you be in the far north, however, it will be September before
Scottish lamb peaks in quality; seasonality in the shops determined by
the climate, and when it was warm enough for lambs to be born. The
summer advantage, for southern Scots at any rate, is succulent lamb
around the time of year when outdoors grilling over charcoal is also at
its peak.
''Look for lamb which is a bright, rosy pink colour,'' says Wilson
Ferguson of butcher's D W Ferguson (3 Buchanan Street, Airdrie). ''The
fat should be creamy-white, not too white and not too yellow. And the
eye of lean meat in a chop should be well-rounded.'' He buys lambs
(mostly Suffolk-crosses) from the market in Stirling and from six
farmers who produce the consistent quality he requires and who use only
natural feeds.

There is much heated debate over the merits of various types of
salmon. But Lady Claire Macdonald knows which she prefers and she makes
no bones about it.
THERE comes a time when the nettle has to be grasped, and today is the
day. How can I not write about salmon, living where I do and being lucky
enough to be able to get wild salmon for the consumption of my guests
and, on special occasions, for myself?
But there is the great bone of contention: my use of wild salmon as
opposed to farmed. I have never made any secret of the fact that I
consider wild salmon to be better eating than farmed. And yet, as with
all types of farming, there is the good and the not so good. The good
farmed salmon is very good indeed, and there are respected people who
run hotel kitchens and restaurants of deservedly high repute who
disagree with me.
But I stick to my guns and I haven't altered my opinion that wild
salmon is the best. I have been lambasted both verbally and in print,
but I am first a cook and second a very greedy person, and for my taste
wild is better than even the best farmed.
Like any fish, salmon cooks very fast, and it is rendered dry and
tasteless and most unpleasant of texture by overcooking. No amount of
luscious Hollandaise Sauce can mask overcooked salmon.
When Alexandra, our eldest daughter, was married on a mid-December
day, she chose salmon for the main course at the reception. I was full
of misgivings about the ability of the caterers to produce edible hot
salmon for 260 people. However, the salmon was quite perfectly cooked
and, although it had to be farmed at that time of year, was delicious.
Salmon is a convenience food, when filleted and briefly cooked. All
the preparation can be done in advance, the cooking at the last moment,
and there is a variety of sauces and embellishments which enhance the
fish. It is only in the last two or three years that I have begun to use
tomatoes and basil with salmon, and very good it is too.
Many years ago John Tovey taught me how to cook salmon to the
perfection which I think essential, by baking filleted pieces, with a
knob of butter on each, in a very hot oven (420[DEG]F, 220[DEG]C, gas
mark 7) for five minutes. If you have more than about eight pieces of
salmon on the baking tray you may need to add a couple of minutes to the
cooking time.
If I am cooking a salmon for eating cold, I put it in our fish kettle,
cover it with water and sliced lemon, crushed parsley stalks, dry white
wine, rock salt, peppercorns, and a bayleaf or two. Over a moderate heat
I cook the salmon until the water starts to boil, simmer for one minute
then take the kettle off the heat and leave the fish to cool completely
in the liquid, on the stone floor of our larder.
No matter what the size of salmon, this ensures a perfectly cooked
fish once it has cooled completely. I skin a cold salmon, remove the
head, and cover it with very thinly sliced cucumber brushed lightly with
oil to stop the slices curling upwards as they dry out. You could use
aspic instead.
One point on the arrangement of the salmon. If you haven't got a large
enough platter for the cold fish, it looks extremely good served on a
mirror, especially if you surround it with chopped golden aspic jelly.
It really is most effective.
This week's recipe so easy and straightforward. Beware, though, not to
give your guests too large a filo-wrapped piece of salmon -- it is very
filling, and although two layers of filo don't amount to much they do
result in a most sustaining main course. I don't think potatoes are even
necessary as an accompaniment, preferring to serve, for example, sliced
sugarsnap peas, stir-fried briefly with spring onions and a grating of
fresh ginger, and a good tomato salad.
FILLET OF SALMON WITH DILL BUTTER IN FILO PARCELS
Serves 4
4 pieces of filleted salmon
4 sheets of filo pastry
2oz butter
FOR THE DILL BUTTER
4oz butter
a good handful of dill, chopped finely
1tsp lemon juice
freshly ground black pepper.
Make the dill butter by heating the 4oz butter until soft and creamy.
Add the chopped dill, lemon juice, and pepper. It should be spreadable.
Melt the 2oz butter. Lay a sheet of filo on a work surface and brush
it all over with the melted butter. Cover with a second sheet of filo
and brush this with butter too. Cut in half widthways. Lay a piece of
salmon in the middle of each half. Spread a good teaspoonful of dill
butter over each bit of salmon. Fold the filo like a parcel and brush
all over with melted butter. Put the parcels on to a buttered baking
sheet. Repeat the process with the rest of the filo and salmon. At this
stage you can cover them with clingfilm and keep the baking tray in the
fridge until you are ready to cook the fish.
To cook, bake it in a hot oven, 425[DEG]F, gas mark 7, 225[DEG]C for
15 minutes.
Serve as soon as possible.

Percussionist Evelyn Glennie (above) tells ANN DONALD which books are
on her bedside table.
* I'VE been reading a book called Life -- And How To Survive It by
Robin Skynner and John Cleese. It's in the form of a discussion and
follows Cleese and Skynner's conversation throughout the 400 pages. It
doesn't get tedious at all because the subjects are varied enough and
they discuss everything in detail without being heavy-handed about it.
Cleese's humour comes through and that's very appealing.
It is a book that's meant to dispense serious advice and apparently a
lot of psychologists and psychology students use it as a study book.
It's also a pleasure for people like me to read. I think that Cleese was
actually Skynner's patient so they appear to have gone over some of the
subjects that are mentioned in the book in their minds for years and
years whereas other topics appear to be very spur of the moment.
The other book that I'm reading is called Psycho Cybernetics by
Maxwell Schultz. It's quite an old American self-help book that has the
slogan ''join millions who are adding more life to their years and years
to their lives''. Schultz is a renowned doctor and the book itself is
simple yet scientific. Sometimes the American self-help books can be a
bit sickly and a bit unrealistic and too perfect. But this one seems to
be quite good and I can get a lot from it being a musician because
you're dealing a lot with people, emotions and performers and he covers
all those areas.
Strangely enough I don't really read a lot of music books. I don't
read a lot of composers' books unless it's for a specific reason -- say
if I was trying to learn a specific piece of music by Stockhausen then
it would be helpful to read his work so that I could interpret his
music. I do get a kick out of reading books about instruments and
biographies and autobiographies of conductors though.

THE ART OF GERARD SEKOTO
Barbara Lindop.
Pavilion, #12.99.
WITH the huge Africa 95 Festival running in the UK from August to
December under the patronage of Nelson Mandela and the Queen, it's an
appropriate time to look at the work of Gerard Sekoto, a rare pioneer
African painter whose career began in 1921 when he stumbled on pencil
and paper in a local mission school of the Transvaal.
Sekoto got off to a flying start. By 1940 Johannesburg Art Gallery had
bought his painting Yellow Houses, Sophiatown -- until the 1980s the
only painting by a black artist they posessed. (The same gallery had
turned him down as a floor cleaner because of his colour.) Later one of
his oils was in a show of Contemporary South African Paintings at
London's Tate Gallery.
But it was not to last. In 1947 he decided to go to Paris, never to
return. ''Leaving South Africa's gold mines, with apartheid, did not
mean running after any golden mines in Paris, but finding poverty
instead. On the contrary I was after golden minds . . . in search of
listening and exchanging ideas with other artists from different
countries -- in short, communication.''
Self-imposed exile in France brought many problems and by 1985 when
the author began corresponding with the 72-year-old Sekoto, he was in
hospital, lonely and neglected. The book is based on many
autobiographical letters she received before eventually meeting him in
1988. He died five years later. There is little documentation on the
lives of black artists of the period, consequently Sekoto's
correspondence is all the more significant.
Sekoto was obviously a great personality who inspired both affection
and aggravation. Son of a teacher who turned to Lutheran evangelism, at
five he began drawing in chalk on his older brother's slate -- until he
had a slate of his own. Soon his special ability was obvious but it was
years before he discovered the existence of coloured crayons: ''a
revelation!'' Initially his subjects were his own family: mother,
brothers and friends and people remained his main focus.
On his father's death in 1938 Sekoto escaped his obligation to teach
and set off for Johsannesburg where, wandering along the street looking
for work, he saw a store selling poster colours and paintbrushes. The
die was cast. He decided to be a painter.
Soon he was using oils on brown paper and exhibiting in Johannesburg.
An astonished critic wrote: ''His paintings are outstanding. He could
take his place among the French 'moderns'.'' Pictures for the South
African Academy followed. 'My efforts were to arouse the consciousness
in our own people to the horrible conditions in which they lived. Such
an awakening would create power and weight to demand the right and
knowledge to be able to live like everyone else.''
In fact, his interiors from this period have an unrealistic romantic
quality. However his work was accepted and shown in the New Group, an
association of white South African avant-garde artists in Cape Town.
Later oils from 1945-7 show more accurate views of District Six and the
sordid township of Eastwood, Pretoria. Eastwood was bulldozed by
official decree in the early days of apartheid government, so Sekoto's
paintings provide historical documentation of these destroyed
communities.
These were the golden years. Sekoto's figures are robust, solid
creatures, well-defined with bold, simplified strokes and rich in hue.
His Wine Drinker of 1945 is representative of the ''young coloureds
loitering without jobs, not able to go to school because their parents
were without means. Mothers had to make ends meet in most complicated
ways while the fathers were in prison, drinking or pushing drugs on
street corners.''
By the standards of 1930s Africa, he was well-educated and his work is
set against the background of a vigorous intellectual fight for
recognition and status. ''I hate politics -- everyone wanting to be
better than the other and hence using any means. Since it was the law
that the whites topped the list, the whitest child in the family could
be tempted to 'play white' and shift into a more advantageous life.''
Sekoto's exile has a tragic irony. Having realised his dream of
escaping the humiliation of South Africa, once in France his art slowly
lost its strength and character. He lived with Martha Hennebert (friend
of Rainer Maria Rilke and ex-wife of Jean Lurcat) for 30 years but after
her death in 1982, he fell apart and was hospitalised until 1987.
At the end of his life, due to much work on Lindop's part, he received
many exhibitions and awards including the French Chevalier des Arts and
Germany's Clermond award. This year nine South African postal stamps
feature his paintings: a belated but none the less official recognition
of his work.
This straightforward account gives little in-depth analysis of either
Sekoto's art or the political situation, but bearing in mind the paucity
of information on black artists, it's a welcome addition to ongoing
research.

WONDER BOYS
Michael Chabon.
Fourth Estate, #15.99.
OTHER writers have a work in progress. Grady Tripp has a
work-in-regress, his fourth novel, Wonder Boys, seven years in the
making. ''It's basically done. I'm just sort of, you know, tinkering
with it now.'' The problem is he's stoned. Today and every day, amiably
and endlessly looking down from the clouds upon his own creativity. And
he is writing both these books -- his Wonder Boys with its cast of
hundreds and 50 style changes, and, as narrator, the one we're reading
-- from inside the problem.
Real life is complicated to the pleasantly dazed. In between visits to
the ounce of Humboldt County in the Ziploc in the glove compartment of
his Galaxie ragtop, he fits in a wife (his third), a mistress, and a
career in the groves of Pennsylvania academe. His wife, Emily, is sweet
and blameless and also Korean Jewish (adopted). His mistress Sarah is
chancellor of the university where he lectures and her husband chairman
of its English department. ''I liked Walter Gaskell, and I could never
lie in his bed without feeling there was a coarse thread of shame
running through the iridescent silk of my desire for his wife.''
Walter Gaskell, an expert on ''American mythopoetics'' (he owns the
jacket Marilyn Monroe wore to wed Joe diMaggio), is also founder of the
annual WordFest for which distinguished writers are even now assembling.
When Tripp, preoccupied with his unfinished novel, goes to the airport
to meet Crabtree, his old buddy and literary agent, he finds Crabtree
has picked up an apparent transvestite.
From the ongoing internal debate there are suddenly lots of sharp
things to focus on. Five-inch heels. Curls. While the pick-up heads
unequivocally for the ladies' powder room the two men speculatively
collect from the baggage carousel those items that they surmise to be
his/hers. A spotted pony-hide case in a clear plastic zip cover. A tuba.
This amiable approximation of full awareness and efficient functioning
is the mood of the book, and the tuba the first of an accumulation of
objects that will eventually fill the trunk of the Galaxie . . . Tripp's
mistress's dog, Doctor Dee, shot by a suicidal creative-writing student,
and his in-laws' pet boa constrictor, Grossman, run over in the drive.
This is not stock transatlantic goofiness, but grotesquerie of the
highest order. Wonder Boys has heart, it is relentlessly well-written,
and it is the funniest book I've read in a very long time.
James Leer, the student who shot the dog, is a splendid creation, a
non-smoking, non-drinking obsessive who is also writing a novel and
whose history of deprivation is blown when he is discovered camped in
the damp cellar of a vast mansion, policed from a creaking elevator by
his socialite grandmother upstairs. Even more fiendishly original are
the family of Tripp's wife with whom he celebrates Seder in the country
while angling to break gently the news that his mistress is pregnant and
he plans to marry her.
Marijuana is not the only culpable mood-bender in the novel. Grady
Tripp, James Leer, and the distinguished speakers at the WordFest are
all afflicted by The Midnight Disease, that malaise that makes writers
''lucid with insomnia even in the daytime''. In its grip real life is
mainly a source of material, acted out on their behalf by ''a malignant
shadow . . . disinclined to any business but surveillance and
recollection''.

Iain Sinclair. WHITE CHAPPELL SCARLET TRACINGS/ DOWNRIVER/ RADON
DAUGHTERS (Vintage, #5.99/ #6.99/ #5.99).
IF TO be tired of London is to be tired of life, Iain Sinclair must be
ready to live for ever. This trilogy of novels, packed with underground
lore and secret history, dense and disorderly as a junkshop struck by
lightning, is not so much a narrative as a crazy map of the author's
almost mystical fascination with the underworld of the city, in
particular the East End.
Each book does have a story buried within it -- the search for a first
edition of Conan Doyle's A Study In Scarlet, the making of a TV
documentary about the dying London of late Thatcherism, a bizarre love
story about a one-legged X-ray addict -- but for Sinclair the path is
only important as being the quickest way into the woods.
The novels are actually about: Jack the Ripper, an obscure Edwardian
English horror novelist, Freemasonry, state terrorism, women's
prizefighting, the Angry Brigade, the London Hospital in Whitechapel,
anti-Semitism, the history of the Thames, East End pubs, East End gangs,
squatting, urban decay, and the rare and second-hand book trade -- among
other things. What are they like? Martin Amis and Derek Raymond get in a
fistfight with William Burroughs, perhaps. If you want to read something
really different, any one is worth a try.
Tracy Kidder. OLD FRIENDS (Granta, #7.99).
WE ARE all going to get old some of these days, barring accidents, and
most of us try not to think about it much -- it's just too ghastly for
words. American writer and journalist Tracy Kidder, however, has taken a
sneak preview of his Tiresias years by going to live in an old people's
home for more than 12 months, where he finds lessons both grim and
comforting in an immensely human and humane profile of his fellow
inmates -- mad and sane, sick and healthy, the young at heart and the
dead in soul. Old people, he finds, are people too: that's both the
consolation and the tragedy of getting old. A good and moving book.
Joseph O'Connor. THE SECRET WORLD OF THE IRISH MALE (Minerva, #5.99).
THERE has never been a better time to be Irish in the media than now
-- it's like being a Glaswegian in 1990 -- and Joseph O'Connor, author
of the London-Irish comedies Cowboys And Indians and Desperadoes, is
harvesting spuds while the sun shines. This fragmentary comical anatomy
of Irish types at home, in London, and in America reads like a series of
magazine articles, but pretty good magazine articles at that, and his
digressive, conversational, what-shall-we-talk-about-now style is most
engaging. It's more about the author than about anything else; but when
was that not true of every Irish book in the world?
Peter Lefcourt. DI AND I (Gollancz, #4.99).
A HOLLYWOOD screenwriter and Princess Diana meet at a reception, fall
in love, and run away together with Harry and Wills -- how's that for
high-concept? Peter Lefcourt's audacious romantic comedy about a man who
does in fiction what you can theoretically still be hanged for in life
couldn't fail, and it didn't, but there's more to it than a good, cheeky
Sun headline of an idea. The author has an amusingly bemused American
eye for the foibles of the British class system, an obvious affection
for his subject, and an easy-going line in self-deprecating humour; and
even without the Di-vine presence, this would be a better than average
Yankee-in-London social comedy. Sunny and funny, a great summer read.

THRONE OF GOLD
The Lives of the Aga Khans.
Anne Edwards.
HarperCollins, #20.
JUST now that word money should be among the ones to leave a nasty
taste on the tongue but boardroom greed, the glum grandeur of the
British royals, and monster squabbles over lottery windfalls have done
nothing to shrink a reverence for riches. Hence the appeal to the
biographer of any individual so loaded with wealth he assumes divinity.
For us to be able to share, through books, in such a life brings us
close perhaps to the only god we really choose to know, Mammon. That
said, Anne Edwards has made plodding work of The Throne of Gold and what
she offers as a biography of the Aga Khans is scarcely revelatory.
In one book or another we have read this tale before, its most
sensational chapters reading like the sybaritic bible of the jet set;
the old, grotesque tradition (now abandoned) of weighing the Imam in
gleaming bars of gold bullion; the hectic womanising of Aly Khan
secretly betraying his wives and mistresses as if his very soul depended
on infidelity; his humiliation at being past over for the Imamate in
favour of his son, and that son, Karim, burying his family's playboy
reputation with Aly's gaudy death in a mangled Lancia, Bettina, maybe
his most enduring lover, at his side but ironically unscathed by that
Paris crash.
By then, 1960, Karim had been Aga Khan for three years, and even in
those early days there was about him an unaccustomed gravitas. This
spiritual leader of 15 million Ismaili Muslims had charisma, certainly.
He was a sportsman of exceptional handsomeness, and beautiful women spun
continually in his orbit. But the fourth Aga Khan, whose dynasty claims
direct descent from the Prophet Muhammed, was also a scholar of the
modern world, determined to complete his business studies at Harvard,
and usefully pursue projects to enhance development in Africa, Asia, and
the Middle East.
And so it has been. The dualities of Prince Karim's Eastern and
European upbringing have done nothing to hinder his ease within both
cultures. He lives mainly in Chantilly, France, where his secretariat is
also based. But that he is loved by the Ismaili diaspora is evident
everytime he travels to his people's communities where he draws crowds
of papal proportions, be they located at the peak of the precarious
Karakoram Highway in Pakistan (the most treacherous road of Marco Polo's
old silk route) or amid the cultivated bourgeoisie of the Middle East.
Equally he is respected in the West as an enlightened custodian of
Islam's most liberal-minded sect. Yet it was not always so. Edwards
notes that, pre-1960, at the time of Karim's grandfather, the opulently
fat Imam, the letters on file in the India Office Library Archives
reveal the ''tremendous hypocrisy that Great Britain exercised towards
the Aga Khan''. Neither Foreign Office nor Buckingham Palace, she
writes, was ever averse to using him at any time that served its
purpose. ''But they often viewed him with mocking arrogance.''
Inevitably, in a book which lacks as its core an interview with the
current Imam himself, Edwards dwells on the frantic glamour of Karim's
father, Aly, who processed his chiselled beauties around the world with
the same proud fickleness with which he stroked his illustrious
racehorses. For a few temptestuous years he was married to Hollywood's
love goddess, Rita Hayworth, whose former husband, Orson Welles,
described Aly Khan as ''the most promiscuous man in Europe'' and rightly
forecast that her marriage to him would be fatally unhappy.
Prince Karim, now 57, has lived down all the early indulgent
destructiveness, although the winds of controversy have not bypassed him
entirely. His recent divorce from his British wife of 25 years has, even
by his standards, exacted a hefty price. In 1989 he resigned from the
Jockey Club of Great Britain, pulling his horses out of racing here --
until this year -- as an angry protest against the club's finding that a
camphor substance applied to his filly Aliysa's sore foreleg amounted to
drug use. And his past involvement as the major shareholder in the Ciga
Hotel Group, with its massive losses during the recession, is said to
have cost Karim in excess of $500m.
However, such is his private fortune that if such troubles prey upon
the mind of the Aga Khan, they are well disguised because generally this
is a man known for his genial humour and unassuming courtesy. That he is
also shrewdly private was clearly one of this biographer's obstacles.
Ismailis are the most affluent and intellectually progressive of Muslim
sects, believing strongly, for instance, in the education and equality
of women. They are also discreet, and in all of this they take their
example from a prince out to reconcile spirituality with worldliness. A
living god, they call him, symbolising a certain pragmatic harmony
between Muhammed and Mammon.

RULE OF THE BONE
Russell Banks,
Secker &amp; Warburg, #10
RUSSELL BANKS loves Scotland. He and his wife were married in
Edinburgh Registry Office five years ago and honeymooned in the
north-west corner.
He hasn't been back. ''Princeton intervened,'' he says. Every spring
he teaches creative writing and American literature at Princeton
University where his fellow tutors include Toni Morrison, Joyce Carol
Oates, and Pickney Benedict. The course is run by Paul Muldoon. ''Most
of the rest is writing and promotion.''
We met in the Langham Hilton Hotel, which, according to the
guidebooks, was London's smartest hotel in its previous dispensation. It
opened in 1865. Oscar Wilde, Antonin Dvorak, and Mark Twain stayed
there.
''Here? In this place? Really?'' He smiles broadly and looks round the
room. ''I love the idea of other people, heroes, having inhabited the
same space as yourself. It's wonderful. These connections are very
important.''
His wife's great-grandfather, Joseph Twichell, a Congregationalist
minister from Hartford, Connecticut, married and buried Twain and was
his travelling companion in A Tramp Abroad which Twain wrote while stuck
between the pages of Huckleberry Finn.
Russell Banks wrote Rule of the Bone while pondering what is now a
900-page manuscript on the life of the American anti-slavery campaigner,
John Brown, whose soul goes marching on. ''The manuscript needs some
attention,'' he says. There are other, more obvious connections with
Finn. Bone's voice is immediate and compelling. He narrates his life
story in a way that is devoid of self-pity, yet indicates he is unaware
of his own motivation. There is humour and playfulness and fine sense of
irony. He tries to tell the truth.
Bone begins as Chappie. He is 14, has been abused by his stepfather
and ignored by his mother; both are ''seriously into alcohol''. He is
attractive to everyone but himself and is entirely divorced from his own
desires, needing only the approval of others. He is attracted to those
on the outskirts of society, a bunch of bikers and a guy called Russ.
Prowling the shopping malls or sleeping on a couch, he fantasises about
a happy homelife. But he gets by selling weed to the bikers.
Russ is caught cheating the bikers. There is a fire in which one of
them dies while Russ and Chappie are missing, presumed dead. At first
unsure of their loss of identity, Chappie agrees their money should go
to changing Russ's tattoo, and obvious means of identification. With
what's left over Chappie has crossbones done on his arm. When Russ names
him, he likes his new identity. ''Bone is hard,'' he says.
It is a defining moment. Russ recedes as Chappie changes into Bone. He
invents himself and his means of salvation, gradually coming under the
influence of a Rastafarian prophet, I-Man, the only person who does not
abandon him, who takes him to Jamaica and offers what he calls a real
home and a real family. He is to Bone what Jim was to Huck Finn.
The voice and sense of identity, the intimacy of character, are so
complete one feels he already existed and the voice gave him life. ''You
could be right,'' says Russell Banks. ''But if he existed it was as a
lot of things. For me, he started in prison.''
He was teaching creative writing to inmates of an upstate New York
penitentiary. They were suspicious until they realised he wasn't a
teacher. Many, he said, were waiting for the opportunities he provided.
''They were kids who had slipped through the cracks. They weren't
criminals . . . They'd had a fight with their parents, they stayed out
too late or had been hanging round corners. They went to jail and then
they were criminalised.''
He'd ask them to write about the worst thing they'd done or the worst
thing that had happened to them; and to write as if they were speaking,
to look for their own voice and to use it. ''In every case, their work
was so touching because it was so ordinary.''
Russell Banks describes the character of Russ as a way of getting
himself out of the novel, of allowing Bone to develop on his own, though
he also appears in other roles along with his wife and their house, and
there are echoes of his other novels, especially in his love of Jamaica,
his politics and culture, but he eschews any notion of reportage. ''A
writer's job is to listen. I'm not a ventriloquist. I am telling a tall
tale. It is a literary artefact, not a slice of life. It is emblematic,
not a case study.''
Bone finds his way among the debris. Neither family, culture, nor
community can save him and part of this intelligent truthful novel's
achievement lies in its awareness of this simple fact. It suggests
direction. Bone is saved by another outsider. Listening to a CD of
Charles Ives he is moved by the ''trumpets and violins coming at me from
different directions at different speeds and loudness but linked
together anyhow''.
It has nothing to do with the music, but rather with the composition.
The form is unimportant. It's the effect that matters.

THE DOUBLE TONGUE
William Golding
Faber &amp; Faber, #12.99
THE Double Tongue is not Golding's chosen title for this, his last and
unfinished novel. But it clearly enough states the central idea. Ancient
Greece is in decline and the Oracle is its last hope of preserving
independence within the Roman Empire. Once the Oracle spoke ambiguously
because the gods would never deign to be explict to mortals. Now it is a
bargaining tool for Greece and must speak a twin language: realpolitik
as well as prophesy.
This picture of the western world in one of its great moments of
transition is presented through the stories of Arieka, the last true
prophetess, and Ionides, the high priest who has weaned her to speak
both with Apollo and to wealthy Romans.
In their relationship Golding creates what is perhaps his clearest
image of the connection between material and spiritual worlds. While
Arieka is at work in the Oracle she is surrounded by intoxicating laurel
incense, ambitious Romans, and a gullible public wanting the Oracle to
tell them where to look for lost possessions. At her side is Ionides
cynically making up the prophecies as he goes along. But, despite her
worldliness and the knowledge that she was made priestess because of
miracles which never happened, she still believes in the gods. Apollo
has raped her and, although his back is now turned on Delphi, he
sometimes speaks through her.
Arieka's gloomy faith is a model for the ''mystery'' which Golding
constantly spoke about in essays and interviews, and which he attempted
to formulate at the heart of all his novels. It is informed by a sense
that even a corrupted society works through the unconscious processes of
religious instinct. In the picture of a fading Apollo and a decaying
Delphi he articulates both his pessimism and a feeling that behind the
grim material world there is -- in a difficult, ambiguous but real sense
-- something further.
It is highly unlikely that Golding would have wanted his last book to
be published in its present form. It is the second draft of a novel that
was clearly close to his heart, dealing as it does with the themes he
considered to be most important in his life: ancient Greece,
civilisation in decline, and the need for individual religious vision.
But what the editors at Faber &amp; Faber have given us is perhaps even
more interesting for being unpolished. It is a story in raw form;
something that in Golding's steady hand is as monumental as it is
minimal. Issues of empire, nation, and freedom in the conflicts between
Greece and Rome are nakedly representative of the contempoary world. And
in his central portrayal of the Delphic Oracle we get an undisguised
model for what Golding conceived of as the nature of inspiration: ''The
oracle, the oracle, the oracle! Preserve that and all is preserved.''

THE BOOK OF MAN
Barry Graham
Serpent's Tail, #8.99
HE HAS had a variety of occupations is a phrase one had given up hope
of ever seeing again on any novel's flyleaf. It belongs to the 1960s,
when wideboy provincials were discovering that you didn't need an
Oxbridge education to get a book published, and for a while no first
novel was complete without a discreet editorial mention of the author's
formative years as a brothel pianist. Real life, you see. Knocked around
a bit.
That it should reappear on the flyleaf of Barry Graham's fourth novel,
The Book Of Man, is appropriate, because this haunting confessional
novel has both the charms and curses of all those raw and vibrant (etc)
literary debuts. There's the vivid first-person voice, the emotional
sincerity, and the exhilarating contempt for gentility; but also to some
degree the self-righteousness, the distrust of humour, and the
puritanism of style.
Kevin Previn, the narrator, is a Glaswegian writer and performer
living in London, to which he escaped 10 years before as some men flee
to the Foreign Legion. What brings him back to Glasgow for a few bad
days is a commission to write a TV programme about his lately deceased
friend Mike, author of a despairingly bleak Glasgow junkie novel called
The Book Of Man.
Schlepping around his and Mike's old West End haunts, talking to old
friends and enemies, the narrator is tear-gassed by a miasma of painful
memories that force him to confront the past (a horrendously bad
marriage, a miserable working-class adolescence of zero horizon, the
betrayal of his friends, a nervous breakdown) he ran away from. His own
life becomes as it were a companion volume to his friend's book, and
eventually he returns to London a sadder and, if not a wiser, then a
more insightful and sympathetic man.
Graham is at his best when recreating the raffish bohemian atmosphere
of Byres Road and environs, a land of bedsit desperadoes and chancers,
losers both beautiful and otherwise. His sense of place is brilliantly
evocative, and he can fix a character in a single observation. He can be
grimly funny, too, and could be funnier if he allowed himself to be: a
dogged, over-sensitive gloom is his book's main limitation. Once he
rolls the weight of the world off his shoulders and acquires the armour
of a little healthy cynicism, he'll write a really excellent book: but
this will do fine for now.

ALLEN GINSBERG: JOURNALS, 1954-1958
Gordon Ball (ed)
Viking, #25
THOMAS CARLYLE once said Walt Whitman only thought he was a big poet
because he came from a big country. It wasn't entirely fair, but it was
partly true. The American with his ''sprouting'' poems, his incantatory,
sometimes slovenly, lines, and his preoccupation with self (''Earth, my
likeness''), inflated verse with a hand-pump to give it the dimensions
appropriate to continental America and, in consequence, to Walt Whitman.
The sage of Camden might not, on reflection, have been the best of
role models for Ginsberg, and neither, given his underlying rigour,
might William Carlos Williams. But Whitman was gay and Williams had made
a modernist epic (Paterson, 1946-58) out of a New Jersey town situated
not so very far from where Ginsberg was born in 1926. More importantly,
both precursors were preoccupied with creating an adequate,
distinctively American poetic speech.
It's never been clear, to a non-American, just what that was supposed
to mean. Writing of Poe, Williams talked of ''the necessity for a fresh
beginning, backed by a native vigour of extraordinary proportions'', and
of a sweeping away of all ''colonial imitation''. He himself famously
refused to surrender to Europe as his old friend Ezra Pound had done.
But for Ginsberg and several of the other ''Beats'' (a meaningless term
for a series of literary accidents) form and content, voice, politics,
spirituality, and autobiography, the what, why, and how of speech, were
to be intermingled. It was their all-American vice.
There is the daft tale, for example, of Ginsberg and Kerouac walking
to Brooklyn Bridge to compare its engineering with Hart Crane's art
while they studied Crane's The Bridge. There is the influence of music,
first bebop, later, for Ginsberg, Dylan and rock and roll. There is the
influence of eastern religions (a truly American obsession) and of the
recreational drugs which were assumed to possess sacramental qualities.
There is, too, an obsession with the contemporary that can now seem
quaint. Howl has often been described as an ''Eisenhower'' poem, a rant
against myopic cruelty, insularity, and spiritual corruption. Read thus,
it seems like an old newspaper, as do many of Ginsberg's poems: ''Nobody
publishes a word that is not the cowardly robot ravings of a depraved
mentality / the day of the publication of the true literature of the
American body will be the day of Revolution'' (Death to Van Gogh's
Ear!).
Most of all -- and this book is a choice example -- there is
literature as myth, more precisely the myth of self in America. In
recent years Ginsberg, a proud co-founder of the ''Jack Kerouac School
of Disembodied Poetics'', has begun to document his life with the same
all-consuming self-regard with which he once lived it.
Thus there are now in print several collections of letters, ''literary
conversations'', interviews, lectures, and ''Original Draft Facsimile''
editions ''Fully Annotated''. In fact, an entire career has been
annotated, and this volume serves to plug a few more of the gaps of
which Ginsberg, a Buddhist, seems peculiarly conscious.
It smacks of a presumption Carlyle would have recognised: if America
is big and important, America's poets are important, and therefore big.
The closest parallel, oddly enough, is probably Yevgeny Yevtushenko,
uneasy laureate of the late Soviet empire who also wrote too often, and
often badly, but Scots might wish to ponder the connection between the
''authentically'' national and rampant egomania.
These journals, gleanings from his most fluent years, inadvertently
demonstrate most of what is good and much that is bad about Ginsberg.
Arresting images flounder and die in swamps of verbiage, strangled in
endless coils of metre. The much-advertised fascination with poetics
thus resembles a series of attempts retrospectively to justify botched
experiments: there is, he sometimes seem to be saying, a good artistic
reason why I wrote this garbage. It'll come to me in a minute.
For a man who began his first journal when he was 11, Ginsberg appears
to lack any self-judgment. The anguished meditations on his mother's
death which led to Kaddish are here intermingled with lists of books he
had read, or was instructing himself to read (''Eliot -- all poems
reread (aloud)''). The moderately interesting accounts of Burroughs's
love for Ginsberg, Ginsberg's love for Cassady, psychotherapy,
experiments with heterosexuality, and experiments with verse are cut
through with routine obscenities, a little casual sex, doodles, dreams,
and a healthy regard for what posterity might think. He poses well: ''I
leaned out of the window and implored the sky to take my consciousness
away. But jump? I couldn't . . . ''
At this distance both Ginsberg and the Beat phenomenon begin to look
like modernism's last throw, a fatal misunderstanding, a moment in which
rather too many people forgot what they were supposed to be doing.
Ginsberg's poetic method, as much recent American verse shows, has
turned out to be a dead end. ''The pure products of America,'' wrote
William Carlos Williams, ''go crazy.'' He didn't say they were also
obliged to keep journals.

PAUL GAUGUIN: A COMPLETE LIFE
David Sweetman
John Curtis/Hodder and Stoughton, #25
ART critic Robert Hughes observed: ''Everyone knows something about
Gauguin.'' David Sweetman agrees but adds: ''That something does little
to increase an understanding of his art.''
What everyone knows is fiction based on fact. Fiction like Somerset
Maugham's The Moon and Sixpence which distressed Gauguin's widow Mette
when published in 1919. Maugham's story was obviously based on the life
of Gauguin, a stockbroker who gave up financial and family affairs to
become a fine artist. After painting in Brittany, then with Van Gogh in
Arles in 1888, Gauguin moved from Paris to Tahiti where he executed a
series of symbolically-charged compositions using scenes and figures
from Tahitian life.
As Maugham discovered, when he arrived in Tahiti in 1917 to research
his novel, Gauguin's Tahitian period has been far from romantic. He was
financially broke and in bad health when he came to the island. He was
obstreperous and had clashes with the local police and clergy. There was
a suicide attempt in 1898 -- he swallowed all the arsenic he had saved
from amounts obtained to treat the eczema on his leg -- and he left
Tahiti in 1901 as an ailing and alienated man. He died of syphilis in
the Marquesas Islands in 1903.
In Maugham's novel Charles Strickland, a London stockbroker, leaves
his wife and goes to Paris to practise the art he feels is inside him.
Despising domesticity he drives one woman to suicide and travels to
Tahiti where he marries a native girl. No wonder Mette Gauguin disliked
The Moon and Sixpence since it depicted the artist's wife as a silly and
unsympathetic bitch (shades of Maugham's perception of his own wife
Syrie who disapproved of the writer's relationship with his chum Gerald
Haxton). Sweetman defends Mette as a liberated woman who ''kept the
family going with no help from the man (portrayed) as the selfless
martyr to art''.
Mette died in 1920 and the myth of the martyred Gauguin persisted.
Irving Stone's novel Lust For Life (1934) was famously filmed in 1956
with Kirk Douglas as sensitive soulful Van Gogh, Anthony Quinn as
tortured tormented Gauguin. Sweetman finds that film unconvincing,
praises Donald Sutherland's impersonation of Gauguin in the Danish film
The Wolf At The Door (1986), is silent on the subject of The Rebel
(1960) in which Tony Hancock does a Gauguin by packing in his clerking
and making puzzling pictures instead of counting cash.
Sweetman's Gauguin is as much of a monster as a martyr. Sweetman calls
Gauguin a ''renegade, syphilitic paedophile'' -- he had three
child-brides -- and accuses him of lying about his life, possibly even
inventing the tale of the suicide attempt. He adores him as an artist,
however, honouring him as an eclectic who embraced a colourful culture
as well as its child-brides: ''No-one can deny Gauguin's role in opening
European eyes to non-European art and by extension to the peoples who
made it.''
Feminists can condemn Gauguin as a sexual tourist, socialists can
criticise him as a colonial type. Yet his art has a genuinely uplifting
primitive power which is why he inspired Van Gogh and influenced Picasso
who, after studying Gauguin's work in 1906, created the classic
composition of modernism in Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.
Gauguin will always be associated with Van Gogh's art and ear. At the
beginning of The Rebel, Hancock looks at a self-portrait of Van Gogh and
says: ''Ah, Vince boy, you went through it. Made you cut your ear off.''
Not quite but he did cut off enough of his ear to make Gauguin get the
hell out of Arles. As Gauguin told a tale of Van Gogh rushing at him
with a razor before retreating to mutilate himself, it is usually
assumed that Gauguin's pugnacious presence in Arles was the cause of Van
Gogh's distress. Sweetman thinks not: ''It is surely wrong to attack
(Gauguin) because a madman read into his every gesture the signs of
betrayal and neglect which provoked him to the point of violence.''
It is surely wrong of Sweetman to attack Van Gogh as a madman given
the pictorial and epistolary evidence to the contrary. Van Gogh had the
mentality of a man who (as the Don MacLean song Vincent puts it)
suffered for his sanity. Gauguin was not prepared to put up with his
fellow painter's suffering. Sweetman thinks Gauguin was sensible rather
than insensitive in distancing himself from a ''demented Dutchman'' but
that only adds insult to a celebrated injury.
The incident in Arles displayed Gauguin's insensitivity to a
hypersensitive artist. If Van Gogh really, as Gauguin alone asserted,
rushed at him with a razor then he could have done something more
helpful than leaving his hostile friend to his own devices while he,
Gauguin, spent the night in a hotel. Gauguin maintained he left Arles as
he feared another sight of himself might prove fatal to Van Gogh but
that sounds like a likely story by an artist who made next to no effort
to respond to a cry for help.
After leaving Arles, Gauguin attended a public execution in Paris and,
reflecting on the gruesome reality of the guillotine, made a ceramic pot
in the shape of a severed head. It was, writes Sweetman, ''in fact a
self-portrait, almost a death-mask, with eyes tight shut, fired with a
dripping red glaze that covered the ears in a flow of what looked like
blood. It was as if Van Gogh has succeeded in hacking away at him with
his razor.'' Looked at another way it was as if Gauguin felt guilty
about abandoning Van Gogh in Arles. Gauguin may have lied in life but
was honest in his art.
Interpreting this art Sweetman is entertaining. He looks at Where Do
We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going? (1897) as a simple visual
statement, as straightforward as ''an unfolding strip-cartoon, though in
this case it is one that is meant to be read backwards from right to
left''. It is comical when you think of it like that. This lively book
is bound to stimulate all of us to look again at Gauguin.

THE 102nd Scottish Chess Championships finished last weekend, in
Hawick, in a triple title tie for the title. John Shaw (Kilmarnock),
Stephen Mannion (Paisley) and Dr Colin McNab (Dundee) all finished on
6.5 points from nine rounds.
This was Shaw's first championship victory. Mannion previously won the
event in 1990, while McNab has now scored a third success in this
tournament. These three were all undefeated and worthy winners in what
proved to be an extremely close-run contest whose outcome was entirely
unclear until the final round.
The tournament was enlivened by the participation of 18-year-old
Jonathan Rowson (Aberdeen) who had just returned from winning the silver
medal for Scotland in the European under-18 championships in Poland.
This outstanding achievement is Scotland's best junior international
performance since Paul Motwani won the world under-17 title in 1977/78.
I shall return to this result in a future column.
Full results in Hawick were: Shaw, Mannion and McNab 6.5; Pritchett
5.5; Condie 5; Rowson 4.5; J Grant, Robertson and Swan 4; Henderson,
Kilgour and Dearing 3.5; Burnett and L. Russell 3.
Of the three closest challengers to the winners, Rowson and Mark
Condie played below par, but were always a danger in individual games. I
was in contention until the eighth round when Condie proved the truth of
this point by beating me in the following game, one of the best in the
tournament.
White: C. Pritchett
Black: M. Condie
102nd Scottish Championship, Hawick 1995
Reti's Opening
1 Nf3 d5 2 c4 d4 3 g3 f6 4 Bg2 c5 5 0-0 Nc6 6 d3 e5 7 e3
The players have entered into a Modern Benoni structure in which White
plays the Black side of the defence with an extra tempo. The exchange on
d4 is characteristic. White tries to make something of his queenside
pawn majority and control of the long White diagonal and Black of his
pawn centre and kingside space.
7 . . . Be6 8 exd4 cxd4 9 a3?
But this is inaccurate. The critical test is 9 Na3 (not fearing . . .
Bxa3 which gives up the bishop pair and opens the b-file for White),
followed by Nc2 and rapid queenside expansion with Rb1, a3 and b4.
9 . . . a5 10 Nbd2 Nh6 11 Rb1 Nf7 12 Re1 Be7 13 Nb3!?
To achieve b4, White must now waste time repositioning his knight on
c2 via the a1 square.
13 . . . 0-0 14 Na1 Qd7 15 Nc2 Bh3 16 Bh1 f5 17 b4 Bf6!
Benefiting from White's lost tempi, Black is able to reposition his
own minor pieces to support a powerful central breakthrough and kingside
attack.
18 b5 Ne7 19 a4 Ng6 20 Ba3 Rfe8 21 c5 Rad8 22 Nd2 e4 23 dxe4 f4!
This is a typical breakthrough in such positions. For his pawn, Black
obtains control of e5, a dangerous passed d-pawn and considerably cramps
White's kingside space.
24 Na1 Nfe5 25 Nab3 Nd3 26 Nxa5 Nxf2!
White hoped to free his game by giving up his rook for Black's knight
and two pawns. But Black's knight sacrifice is much stronger. If 27 Kxf2
d3 wins, e.g. 28 Nf3 Bd4+ 29 Nxd4 Qxd4+ 30 Kf3 Ne5+ 31 Kxf4 Ng6+ 32 Kf3
Rf8 mate.
27 c6 bxc6 28 bxc6 Qa7 29 Qb3+ Kh8?
With time shortage looming, Black slips. Correct was 29 . . . Be6, and

Holidaying at home or abroad? Looking for sun or for snow? Special
travel correspondent Katie Wood outlines some of the best offers and
packages available for summer and winter trips.
CRYSTAL Holiday has launched its 1995/6 ski brochure featuring as new
destinations Are, in Sweden, and three US States -- New Mexico, Montana,
and Quebec. The 304-page brochure is one of the biggest ski programmes
ever launched. Crystal, who fly out of Glasgow, offer well-priced
packages for all types of skiing. If you're thinking of hitting the
pistes this winter pop into your travel agent for a copy of the
brochure. Early-booking discounts apply to those who can bear to think
of winter hols before they've even had their summer ones!
* CRUISING can be a great family holiday -- especially when the kids
go free. Market leaders Royal Caribbean Cruise Line are offering free
child places on selected fly cruises in the Caribbean this summer. One
child under 12 goes free for every two paying adults. The price for a
family of three sharing an inside cabin on Majesty of the Seas starts at
#2358, including flights. The itinerary is Miami, Grand Cayman, Jamaica,
Cozumel in Mexico, and Labadee -- RCCL's own private island in the
Bahamas. A great bonus for Scots is the free regional connecting flight.
To save #689 on the brochure price and take advantage of this special
offer call freephone 0500 212 213.
* LUNN Poly are offering #100 per booking off any Thomson, Horizons,
or Skytours brochured holiday departing from Scotland in August. (The
reason they can do this is that they are all owned by the same parent
company, so while it's potentially good for the customer who wanted a
package from one of these outfits, it's not as magnanimous of Lunn Poly
as you might think.)
Sample prices are: August 12 depart Glasgow for Salou, half board #550
per couple: Malta from Edinburgh on August 4 at Marsascala on half board
for #602 per couple. Lunn Poly are also offering two British Midland
flights for the price of one right now. Pop into any of the multiple's
branches.
* DOING the Riviera? Bluebird Express offer flight-only and fly-drive
charters from Edinburgh to Nice. This is a very useful service for those
looking to do their own thing in the South of France. The company are
also in the process of expanding into South Africa -- watch this space
for details of well-priced charters later in the year. Bluebird moved
into Canada last year. They now run Glasgow to Toronto, and their
Gatwick to Montreal flight at #299 return is virtually unbeatable.
Travel agents have details.
* BRITISH Midland have been voted the Best UK Business Airline by
readers of Business Travel World. The award recognises the airline's
commitment to regional flights and expanding its UK network. New routes
have been introduced this year from Glasgow to Leeds Bradford and East
Midlands to Belfast. They also increased their number of flights to
London from Edinburgh to nine every weekday.
* BRITISH Airways Express -- operated by Manx Airlines -- has a new
Glasgow-Belfast City route for just #57 return. This must include a
Saturday-night stay, and the first of the three daily flights leaves at
0830. Call BAE on 0345 222111.
* NEED a bed in the English capital? The London Metropole on Edgware
Road has an offer for a room for #79 until September 3 (this price does
not include breakfast). The Metropole boasts an indoor pool and leisure
centre, as well as impressive business facilities. Not bad value for a
room in a good hotel in Europe's most overpriced capital for
accommodation.
* GLOBESPAN are offering charter flights from Edinburgh to New York on
a weekly basis until September 3. With prices starting at #179 return,
rising to #349 in peak season, it's a service worth checking out if
you're looking to hit the Big Apple or the eastern seaboard this summer.
Travel agents will book you.
* FANCY a trundle round Rob Roy country in a 1950s bus? The Loch Earn
and Loch Tay Trundlers provide the answer. These public bus services,
launched last month, give passengers the chance to return to the
carefree world of yesteryear, enjoying an unhurried view of Perthshire's
scenic forests, mountains and lochs. Commentaries are provided on board.
The Loch Earn runs from Crieff to Callander and vice versa; the Loch
Tay from Aberfeldy to Callander via Killin. At #4 for adults, #2 for
kids and OAPs, this is a good-value day out for all the family.
Interestingly, in these days of cutbacks, these buses also provide the
only public-transport link now between Perthshire and the Trossachs
area! Contact local Tourist Information Centres for further details. The
service operates until September 12.
* LOOKING for good-value year-round travel insurance? Check out the
new package on offer from Worldcover Direct who are marketing a #75
annual policy; #120 for a family of four. This beats all packages
currently on offer from banks, building societies, travel agents, tour
operators or the Post Office. Call for more information on the freephone
number: 0800 365121.
* EDINBURGH Castle is still the most visited paid-attraction in
Scotland, with 992,078 visitors passing through its portcullis each
year. Second and third places go to Edinburgh Zoo and Deep Sea World in
Fife. For the Free Attractions, Glasgow Art Gallery wins hands down with
a 903,680 headcount, followed by Edinburgh's Royal Botanic Gardens.
These figures were released by the Scottish Tourist Board's Visitors
Attractions Survey.
* ANYONE for tennis? How about a tennis holiday in Florida, flying
direct from Glasgow? Until September, Travelpack are offering a special
accommodation deal at the World Tennis Center Resort in Naples, Florida,
for only #425 for up to four people staying in a two
bedroom/two-bathroom apartment. Transatlantic flights still need to be
added to this total. These are available for #511 with car hire thrown
in for #15 a week. This gives you unlimited tennis plus free green fees
at a selection of golf courses in the area. Call Travelpack direct on
0161 707 4404.

<HEADLINE>Ecstasy dealer is jailed for six years</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A DRUG trafficker was jailed for six years yesterday to deter others
from dealing in ecstasy in south-west Scotland.
Neil Pickthall, 27, a fisherman, was caught with capsules containing a
combination of amphetamine and ecstasy in Stranraer last year. The High
Court in Edinburgh heard that this was the first seizure of the brown
and white combination capsules in the area.
Lord Weir told Pickthall: ''It seems to me that where drugs of this
type are seen to be traded in a district where that has not happened
before, the sentence should be one that marks the seriousness of that
and is an attempt to deter others.''
Pickthall, of Riverbank, Gatehouse-of-Fleet, Kirkcudbright, was
convicted of drugs and bail offences at Stranraer Sheriff Court but
Sheriff James Smith decided his maximum power of sentence -- three years
-- was not sufficient and sent him to the High Court.
Police had received information that Pickthall was involved in the
supply of drugs and when they went to detain him they saw him drop a
plastic bag over a wall. It contained 15 pieces of cannabis resin, 11
ecstasy pills, and 34 capsules containing ecstasy and amphetamine. He
also had temgesics.
Pickthall was released on bail but in April this year was caught with
cannabis in Kirkcudbright. He was subsequently convicted of possessing
cannabis, amphetamine, ecstasy, and temgesic, with intent to supply, and
breaching bail.

THE latest attempt by Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth to address
issues in a constructive and co-operative fashion emerged yesterday on
his old battleground of education.
Junior Minister Raymond Robertson announced that the introduction of
the Government's controversial ''mentor'' scheme for student secondary
teachers had been postponed for a year.
His statement included conciliatory references to the workload
problems facing Scottish teachers, and the financial difficulties of
teacher-training colleges.
However, while the main teaching unions perceived the move as another
part of ''listening'' Mr Forsyth's New Deal, they also pointed out that
the mentor scheme could not have started this year, because of
insufficient support from the educational establishment.
They did, however, welcome the decision to delay the scheme until
1996, and expressed hope that further discussions with the Scottish
Office could help eliminate their principal objections to the
initiative.
The scheme, which aims to increase the time spent by student teachers
in ''live'' classroom situations, was due to begin next month, at a cost
of #2m annually.
Trainees were to spend an additional four weeks in schools, with
mentor teachers having 80 minutes of ''protected'' time each week to
spend working with a student. Schools were to receive #1000 per student
to help fund cover arrangements.
Mr Robertson said yesterday that a pilot project had drawn approval
from both students and teachers, and he expressed disappointment at the
delay in the scheme's full implementation.
However, he added: ''I accept that many teachers have concerns which
need to be resolved before the scheme is able to go ahead.
''I am conscious that difficulties encountered in trying to get the
scheme off the ground this year may have arisen, not from any strong
opposition to the idea of teachers carrying out a mentor role but rather
because of other factors such as teachers' workload and the financial
situation of the teacher education institutions.
''Postponement for a year should allow time for all involved in this
initiative to devise suitable arrangements, for schools to take
mentoring into account in their development planning, and for
prospective mentor teachers to receive training. I hope the teacher
unions involved in this task will approach it constructively.
''I am strongly committed to the introduction of mentoring and firmly
believe that it will improve the training of tomorrow's teachers.''
Mr Fred Forrester, deputy general secretary of the Educational
Institute of Scotland, said: ''We welcome the postponement but that
alone does not solve all the problems. We will be looking to meet Mr
Forsyth and Mr Robertson over the next few months to discuss our
fundamental objections.''
His counterpart at the Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association, Mr
Craig Duncan, added: ''We are not against the idea in principle but our
members had some deep reservations and we were preparing for a ballot on
a possible boycott in Strathclyde.''
Both pointed to the lack of support for the idea from a wide range of
educational groups and suggested that Mr Forsyth had been left with
little option but to shelve the scheme meantime.
Mr Forrester said: ''I think there is a strong element of force
majeure here,'' while Mr Duncan added: ''This shows the Scottish
Secretary is living in the real world.''

<HEADLINE>Blair lawyer not statesman, says Deputy Prime Minister. Heseltine attacks 'cracks' in Labour</HEADLINE>

DEPUTY Prime Minister Michael Heseltine yesterday used his first
speech since being appointed to the post to try to shift attention from
the Government's problems to ''hairline cracks'' in Mr Tony Blair's
Labour leadership.
However, Mr Blair said he regarded the increasingly personal Tory
attacks on him as a compliment and an indication of desperation.
Mr Heseltine accused Mr Blair of having the qualities of a lawyer,
ready to support either side of an argument depending on who was paying,
rather than those of a statesman.
In his speech at a Conservative lunch in Nottingham, the Deputy Prime
Minister said Mr Blair had changed his mind on a string of key policies
and was now guilty of ''a sell-out to the Murdoch press empire''.
At a news conference before the lunch, he said: ''Mr Blair is a very
nice man, a very charming man. But he is, in the end, a lawyer. Lawyers
have one characteristic. That is that they can argue on either side of a
case, depending on who is retaining them.
''That is not the responsibility of a statesman. The responsibility of
a statesman is to get things right and stick by that.''
Mr Heseltine said Mr Blair had once opposed Conservative policies on
Europe, privatisation, union reform, and defence, but now accepted many
of them under the guise of ''New Labour''.
Mr Blair had recently abandoned plans for English regional government
because it was unpopular with the public and local government trade
unions, he said.
''It's all right for opposition leaders to do that but it has got
nothing to do with the steadiness of purpose which makes a Prime
Minister.''
Mr Heseltine told the 10th anniversary lunch of Nottingham
Conservative Business Club that Mr Major's decision to call the
leadership election ''has created in its wake a new sense of unity in
the Tory Party''.
There was now ''above all a common commitment to turn the attack to
our political opponents, the Labour party''.
He went on: ''Early cracks are beginning to appear in the hitherto
plaster-smooth edifice of Tony Blair's leadership. Today, those cracks
may be merely hairline. But those are invariably the earliest danger
signals . . . potentially fatal to the edifice itself.''
Mr Heseltine said: ''Tony Blair's sell-out to the Murdoch press empire
has sent a chill of despair into the hearts of Labour's most committed
supporters.
''Here was a Labour leader travelling halfway across the world to sup
with the man who had broken the back of some of Labour's most entrenched
trade union baronies.
''It wasn't just a passing meeting or a casual chat. This was the
Labour leader chucking in the towel. Everything they had worked for --
all their deepest prejudices, their vision of a new socialism on earth,
the international brotherhood of man -- went down the pan of an
ultra-smart hidey-hole for the rich, off Australia's eastern coast.''
Mr Blair had appealed to Labour councillors across Britain to curb
spending and ''keep the loonies under control'', hardly the action of a
leader who believed his party had changed, said Mr Heseltine.
At a party in the garden of his Sedgefield constituency office at
Trimdon Colliery, County Durham, to celebrate his first year as Labour
leader, Mr Blair said: ''The Tories have now got three Cabinet
Ministers, including a Deputy Prime Minister, paid for by the public,
whose sole task is to attack me.
''I take that as a compliment. I think it helps me because it shows
they are desperate. I don't think the public pay any attention to it.''
Mr Blair defended Labour's stance on regional government, saying: ''We
are advocating regional government but on a step-by-step approach.
People will understand that and think it is very sensible.''
Labour's policy had been born out of conference resolutions and was
now ''in a framework which is practical and realisable in government''.
Mr Blair's deputy, Mr John Prescott, accused Mr Heseltine of
''whinging'' over Mr Blair's meeting with Mr Murdoch.
''Mr Heseltine should have his Cabinet salary stopped and start
getting ordinary Equity rates for his pathetic pantomime performances,''
he said.
Mr Prescott claimed Mr Heseltine had ''gaffed'' by attacking Mr Blair
for being a lawyer as three of his most senior Cabinet colleagues --
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke, Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, and Home
Secretary Michael Howard -- were all lawyers.

THE United Nations' human rights committee has placed on record its
dissatisfaction with the British Government's provisions for giving
Scots the right of self-determination and the right to silence in a
criminal court.
Mr Alan Miller, chairman of the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties,
who presented a report criticising the British Government's own report
on its political and human rights record, said yesterday he hoped the UN
meeting had opened the door to more civil and political rights for
people in Scotland.
The hearing, held in Geneva into implementation of the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, cannot force signatories into
changes in domestic law.
But at the next meeting of signatories of the ICCPR in five years'
time, the British Government will be required to explain what it has
done in response to criticisms by the committee.
A written report will be issued by the committee next Friday, and a
Scottish Office spokesman said he could not comment on the proceedings
until the report had been received and officials given time to study it
in detail.
Mr Miller, who had observer status at the hearings through the SCCL's
membership of the International Federation of Human Rights Leagues,
said: ''The committee was very responsive to points raised by the SCCL.
It took them up and placed on record that they were not satisfied with
some of the answers. That is as much as we could expect.''
He added: ''The question of self-determination was raised in the
context of the Joint Declaration regarding Northern Ireland, giving
people there the right to self-determination and a referendum. The
question was raised that if that is a universal principle, and if it is
applicable to one part of the jurisdiction, why not in another.
''The British delegation said that Northern Ireland was unique and it
was the Government view that the best interests of Scotland were served
by remaining within the Union. My response to that was that this was a
discredited political statement which did not meet the principal of it
being universally applied. Members of the committee said they were not
satisfied that they had been answered in terms of their question.''
He said that committee members had also indicated they were not happy
with the Government's response to claims that changes to the right to
silence within a criminal trial were being imposed in Scotland, contrary
to the wishes of the legal profession, non-governmental organisations,
and without consulting the general public.
The British delegation was also questioned on its provisions to remedy
miscarriages of justice, and recent increases in deaths and suicides in
custody.

<HEADLINE>'Cash for questions' libel case halted</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977273061</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A LIBEL action brought by MP Neil Hamilton and parliamentary lobbyist
Ian Greer over the ''cash for questions'' affair was halted by a High
Court judge yesterday.
Mr Justice May gave his ruling on the preliminary issue of whether the
action should be stayed because parliamentary privilege under the 1689
Bill of Rights prevented the Guardian newspaper from fully defending
itself.
Article nine of the Bill says that debates in Parliament should not be
questioned by the courts.
Mr Hamilton and Mr Greer had sued over an article last October which
alleged that the MP took money in exchange for asking parliamentary
questions in a lobbying campaign orchestrated by Mr Greer on behalf of
Harrods owner Mohammed Al-Fayed.
Later, they said they were considering an appeal.
The Guardian's executive editor, Mr Campbell Page, said: ''We would
obviously have preferred to justify our article at trial but recognise
that, if the court had attempted to achieve a trial by accommodating
parliamentary privilege through amending the pleadings of the parties,
then our defence would have been hobbled.''
Mr Hamilton, MP for Tatton and a former Minister at the Department of
Trade and Industry, resigned his ministerial post five days after the
article appeared.
The newspaper's counsel, Mr George Carman, QC, argued that
parliamentary privilege meant he would not be able to cross-examine
possible witnesses, including Prime Minister John Major and Mr Michael
Heseltine, about Mr Hamilton's alleged conduct.
He said he also would be unable to question the MP about evidence he
gave to a Commons inquiry into his failure to declare a visit to the
Al-Fayed-owned Ritz Hotel in Paris.
Lord Williams, QC, for the MP and Mr Greer, agreed that privilege
would demand the deletion of some material but that enough would remain
to ensure a fair trial.

THE Tall Ships race, which attracted more than one million visitors to
Edinburgh, has left behind the mystery of a disappearing sailor.
There appeared to have been a ''one-man mutiny'' on board the Russian
ship Kruzenshtern only half an hour before the race was due to start on
Tuesday.
It is understood the sailor, believed to be English, did not want to
take part in the event and said he was ill. However, when he got on
shore he declined the offer of going to hospital in a waiting ambulance
and promptly disappeared.
He had told people at the quayside after he was taken off his ship
that he just wanted to go home.
The incident took place as the Princess Royal prepared to wave off the
Tall Ships in front of the massive crowds.
However, because of the sailor's change of heart, the start was
temporarily delayed and the emergency services called into action to
take him off his ship.
Anstruther lifeboat, the ambulance service, the police, and the Forth
coastguard were all involved. It is believed the whole operation would
have cost a four-figure sum.
It is not known whether the Englishman was unhappy with conditions on
the Russian ship and feigned illness to be taken off or had in fact been
taken ill and went to hospital on his own.
A spokeswoman for the local co-ordinating group which helped stage the
event in the Port of Leith said his antics had put back the start of the
race, already delayed because of a lack of wind, by around 10 minutes.
Anstruther lifeboat, with a crew of seven who were patrolling the
area, was called to the side of the Russian ship to take him off.
Race organisers said they saw the man walking down the steps to the
waiting lifeboat. When he reached the harbour, an ambulance and police
car were on hand to take him to hospital. However, an ambulance service
spokesman said the man declined.
A Fife police spokesman said they had no details of the incident but
confirmed they had been called to the harbour.
Ms Libby Ellis, spokeswoman for The Tall Ships race, said they had no
comment to make on what had happened.

Portland, Oregon, Friday,
THE prosecution took nine days to present its case against two British
former cult leaders accused of conspiring 10 years ago to kill the US
Attorney for Oregon: the defence took 45 minutes.
Defence lawyers abruptly rested their case after calling only one
witness. They are gambling that they have persuaded jurors that key
prosecution witnesses were not telling the truth when they implicated
Sally-Anne Croft and Susan Hagan in the plot to kill Charles Turner.
Croft and Hagan were known as Ma Prem Savita and Ma Anand Su at the
Rajneeshpuram commune in Portland, Oregon, where guru Bhagwan Shree
Rajneesh lived with a fleet of Rolls-Royce cars and thousands of
followers from 1981-85.
Witnesses testified that Rajneeshee leaders targeted then-US Attorney
Charles Turner for death because he was heading an investigation into
widespread immigration fraud among Rajneeshees.
Croft controlled the commune's finances and, several witnesses
testified, was third in command behind Rajneesh and his powerful,
acid-tongued personal secretary, Ma Anand Sheela. Hagan, among other
duties, headed the Rajneesh Investment Corporation.
The defence based its case on challenges to the credibility of five
former cult members whose testimony formed the heart of the government's
case. All five cut deals with prosecutors in exchange for their
testimony.
Defence lawyers contended that the five had changed their stories over
the years and had a history of lying.
The defence had listed 34 potential witnesses, but only called John
Shelfer.
Shelfer, known as Jayananda at Rajneeshpuram, was once married to
Sheela and was an early commune leader.
His testimony appeared to backfire for the defence when he said that
Hagan may have attended a meeting at which killing someone other than
Turner was discussed. In his grand jury testimony five years ago,
Shelfer did not mention Hagan among those at the meeting.
Shelfer said he objected to the killing proposal and, as retribution,
was banished to Germany by Sheela. He said he never attended meetings
when killing Turner was discussed.
Shelfer said he was in Australia in early June 1985, when other
witnesses have said the first meeting in the Turner plot was held in
Sheela's bedroom at Rajneeshpuram. He said Croft was with him in
Australia but left to return to the United States before he did.
The prosecution called 29 witnesses, but the crucial words came from
the five former followers of the guru.
Some said Croft supplied the money to buy guns that were to have been
used to kill Turner. Hagan allegedly gave a pep talk in support of
Sheela after she first proposed killing Turner.
The guns were bought and a ''hit team'' was formed, several witnesses
said. Three followed Turner around the Portland area and took
photographs of his house. The guns, retrieved from a lake bed near the
commune, and the photographs were entered as evidence.
According to testimony, the Turner plot was abandoned as the commune
fell apart in 1985.
Seven people were charged over the alleged plot. Two reached plea
agreements; three, including Sheela, remain at large overseas.
Croft and Hagan, who fought a four-year battle against extradition
from Britain before they were sent back to the US, could face life in
prison if convicted.--AP.

Moscow, Friday,
RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin, who has been in hospital for 10 days
with a heart problem, is likely to be discharged early next week.
''The Russian president's course of hospital treatment is nearing
completion and in a few days' time he will be sent on the advice of
doctors to one of the sanatoria near Moscow,'' said Tass, quoting
presidential press secretary Sergei Medvedev.
Yeltsin, 64, has been in Moscow's Central Clinic-Hospital for 11 days
after he fell ill with what doctors called a deterioration in a
long-standing ischaemic cardiac condition, a blood supply problem.
Officials have been releasing regular updates on his condition, but
his sudden illness has unleashed a flood of conjecture over his future
at the head of the Russian Federation.
A close aide said the strain of the presidency had taken its toll,
citing a list of problems including the bloody seven-month Chechen
conflict and an attempt by communist deputies to impeach him which
subsequently failed.
Yeltsin's office was unable to say exactly when he might be
discharged, but the head of Yeltsin's administration said his full
recovery was essential because he had to steer Russia on a steady course
through a difficult period.
''We must all make sure the president recovers fully because he has a
tough year ahead with two election campaigns, for the State Duma (lower
house of parliament), and the presidency,'' Sergei Filatov told
Interfax.
''In this tricky pre-election year it is necessary to hold on to the
political status quo, not to allow the economy to fail, and to bear the
moral burden,'' he added.
On Tuesday, Yeltsin appeared on television for the first time and said
he had had a heart attack but was already feeling better and was in full
control of affairs of state.
Yeltsin said he had wanted to get back to work as soon as possible,
but that doctors had advised him to continue his treatment in a
sanatorium to ensure a full recovery.
Yesterday he was shown on independent television NTV in a meeting room
at the hospital inspecting plans for reconstruction in Moscow with the
capital's mayor, Yuri Luzhkov.
Medvedev said Yeltsin had been working on documents today and Tass
said his close aides visited him almost every day to inform him about
current developments.
Yeltsin has looked fit in his television appearances and even seemed
more healthy than he has done at certain times in recent months, when
his face has been swollen and he has appeared unsteady on his feet.
Despite his apparent recovery, however, the illness has prompted
speculation that he may not stand for a second term in a presidential
election next year.--Reuter.

Grozny, Friday
RUSSIAN and separatist Chechen negotiators said today they had agreed
in principle on breakaway Chechnya's future status, removing the main
obstacle to a deal to end seven months of fighting.
Top separatist negotiator Usman Imayev said after peace talks in the
Chechen capital, Grozny, that he expected the agreement to be signed
tomorrow.
However neither side gave any details of how important differences
over Chechnya's demand for independence and its constitutional status
had been overcome. Imayev also said some details remained to be worked
out.
''Today we have reached an agreement in principle on the central
question of the status of the republic,'' said Vyacheslav Mikhailov,
Russia's chief negotiator and Nationalities Minister. He gave no
details.
Imayev climbed on a lorry and sent a crowd of about 400 Chechens into
a frenzy of singing, dancing and tears of joy by declaring: ''There is
no doubt the independent state of Chechnya will exist.''
He added: ''Now all of us should restore order and prepare for
elections in every (Chechen) settlement.''
However the Russian delegates did not confirm that Chechnya, a small,
mainly Muslim region on Russian's southern rim, would be granted full
independence.
Such a concession would appear to contradict repeated Russian
statements before the talks that Chechnya could be granted limited
self-determination but only within Russia. The Chechens had demanded
full independence.
The dispute over independence, and how to define Chechnya's
constitutional status, had long been the main stumbling block to an
agreement on ending the bloodshed in Chechnya.
Thousands of people have been killed since Russia sent troops to the
region last December to end its independence bid.
Mikhailov said earlier that Russia had drawn up a four-line
Kremlin-backed formula to resolve the problem.
He and fellow Russian delegate Arkady Volsky said after the talks that
the four-line proposal had been increased to six lines -- an indication
that Chechen ideas had been included. They gave no further details.
Chechens gathered outside the Organisation for Security and
Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) building in Grozny, where talks were held,
were ecstatic.
''I am happy that Chechnya is gaining independence. Now we know that
our boys have not died in vain,'' said 53-year-old Maginat Chadayeva.
A Russian paratrooper guarding the OSCE building reflected a
widely-held Russian view. ''We do not need this war but I think Chechnya
should remain in Russia,'' he said.--Reuter.

Sydney, Friday
AN EXTREMELY rare albino whale has been spotted off the Australian
coast, prompting a call for whale-watchers, seafarers, and fliers to
look out for the real-life Moby Dick.
The all-white humpback whale was sighted by a fisherman off a headland
midway along Australia's east coast last Sunday.
It was the fourth sighting in four years of what is thought to be the
same animal, said Lawrence Orel, a spokesman for New South Wales state's
National Parks and Wildlife Service.
''It's the colour of new white paper,'' said Australian Whale
Conservation Society president Paul Hodda. ''There's no evidence of any
other white humpback whale anywhere in the world.''
News of the latest sighting had caused ''a bit of excitement'' in
scientific and conservation circles, said Orel.
''We do welcome reports from people who may have seen it, because it
will give us a good idea of how fast and what distances it is
travelling.''
Media reports have dubbed the albino whale Moby Dick, after the white
whale that featured in Herman Melville's famous novel of the same
name.--Reuter.

Athens, Friday,
HUNDREDS of people fled their homes in panic to escape a forest fire
in the outskirts of Athens while a children's hospital was evacuated as
the blaze raged out of control.
''We fought the fire for three hours with hoses in our garden but then
it engulfed our house and we ran for our lives. My home was ruined and I
could do nothing to save it,'' said Argyris Tsiolis of Drafi, north-east
of Athens.
The blaze started near Mount Penteli, overlooking Athens. Fanned by
high winds, it stretched nine miles, destroying thousands of acres of
pine forest as well as homes and other buildings.
Police said at least five residential areas were evacuated along with
the children's hospital and two summer camps at the foot of Penteli.
Four people were injured.
Residents pleaded for help to save their properties, but the strong
winds and thick smoke kept water-dropping planes grounded for hours.
''Our first priority is to ensure that there will be no loss of
life,'' said Dimitris Katrivanos of the Interior Ministry. ''This is the
biggest fire ever in this area and with such strong winds it is very
difficult to control it.''
Under-secretary Kimon Koulouris said the whole region was declared a
disaster area. Troops had been sent to help hundreds of firefighters.
Police said arson was suspected.--Reuter.

Srinagar, Friday
GUERRILLAS holding five Western hostages said two of the captives had
been wounded in a gunbattle with Indian security forces today, but the
Indian Goverment said it knew nothing of such a clash.
''This morning at 9am fierce fighting broke out between the Mujahideen
and government forces lasting 25 minutes. Two tourists were wounded
while one Mujahid sustained critical injuries,'' said a statement from
the Al-Faran group, delivered to Reuters in Srinagar.
''Two Indian soldiers were killed and many others injured. However,
the Mujahideen succeeded in taking the tourists to safety,'' the
statement added.
An Indian official said in New Delhi, however, that he was puzzled by
news of the gunbattle.
''Our information is that the troops were pulling back and not
engaging the militants today,'' he said.
''I have no information about the clash,'' a government spokesman told
reporters in Srinagar, summer capital of troubled Jammu and Kashmir
state.
Indian officials said representatives of the Al-Faran group holding
two Britons, an American, a German, and a Norwegian, were having talks
with government officials tonight.
''They did not mention anything about the gunbattle at that time,''
said an official.
The Al-Faran statement did not describe the condition of the injured
hostages.
''We have made it clear through the media several times that we should
not be chased, but the Indian government did not relent,'' the statement
said.
It did not say where the encounter took place.
The Al-Faran also disowned a new threat to kill the hostages carried
in a statement faxed earlier today to the New Delhi office of Reuters,
saying it was a government ploy to discredit the group.
''We have learnt from our intelligence sources that the Indian
Government is faxing wrong messages to the foreign media to malign us.
The Indian Government should desist from such tactics,'' said the
statement.
''We strongly deny that we have ever given any news to foreign media
by fax. Our contact is with only the local representatives of foreign
agencies here (in Srinagar),'' it said.
The latest turns in the hostage crisis, which has lasted nearly three
weeks, came after a bomb exploded yesterday in Jammu, the state's winter
capital, killing 16 people and injuring 46.
Police blamed separatist militants, but did not link the blast with
Al-Faran, one of scores of groups fighting Delhi's rule of the Himalayan
region in a bloody five-year insurgency.
Al-Faran abducted Norwegian Hans Ostro, German Dirk Hasert, American
Donald Hutchings and Britons Paul Wells and Keith Mangan in three
separate incidents in the Himalayan state. American John Childs escaped.
The militant group has said it would free the hostages only if India
releases some 20 guerrilla leaders captured during an insurgency which
police and hospitals say has cost more than 20,000 lives.
Indian officials say Delhi is not willing to free guerrillas.
''(Western) diplomats are supporting us on this,'' said one
official.--Reuter.

Zichron Yaacov, Friday
A WEEK of intensive Middle East negotiations has ended with wide gaps
between the Israelis and Palestinians, the PLO said.
The result raises doubts that the two sides can reach an understanding
by July 25, the date set for signing a deal.
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres played down the differences,
calling them a ''tugging of ropes''.
Chief Palestinian negotiator Ahmed Korei said: ''The gap on major,
crucial issues remains. These include redeployment and security
arrangements, and a very serious problem -- water -- emerged which might
threaten the draft agreement as a whole.
''I think it has become difficult to meet the July 25 deadline,'' he
said.
Israeli army redeployment away from West Bank Palestinian population
centres and elections for a governing council are already one year
behind schedule.
About 80 negotiators from each side today ended the first week of
marathon talks at a secluded hotel in the northern Israeli town of
Zichron Yaacov with little progress. They said they might meet at
another venue next week.
''There is a lot of frustration in the negotiations. We cannot accept
redeployment in some areas and cosmetic negative changes in other
places,'' said one PLO official.
Peres, however, told Israel Radio: ''There are little crises here,
crises there. I can't tell you exactly if it will be by July 25 but
there is a possibility and we'll do everything to meet it.''
Israel says it is ready to withdraw its troops from some Palestinian
towns and villages, but insists on keeping control of areas close to
Jewish settlements, including the town of Hebron, a flashpoint of
Arab-Jewish violence.
PLO negotiator Korei said the Palestinians were insisting that the
Israeli army pull out from all cities, villages, and refugee camps.
He singled out water as a particularly contentious issue.
''We cannot envision peace without solving the water issue in a way
that will guarantee the interests and rights of both sides and their
just requirements,'' he said. ''Therefore we informed the Israeli side
that we will not sign an agreement before we agree on the issue of
water.''--Reuter.

GLASGOW councillors face an unenviable choice between public safety
and the amenity of local residents when considering police concerns
about access to the new Celtic FC stand.
Their dilemma was heightened yesterday when it emerged that a
compromise suggested by council officials may still not allay police
fears on public safety.
The club is anxious to have its revamped stadium fully operational for
a pre-season friendly with Newcastle United a fortnight today.
It was granted planning permission for its new 26,000-seat stand,
costing #18m, last September on the basis that Janefield Street was not
used for access except in an emergency.
This followed pressure from local residents who feared disruption on
match days. Consequently, the club had no option but to use the narrow
Celtic Walk to get 12,000 of these spectators in and out of the stadium.
However, Strathclyde Police now say this could cause crowd safety
problems, forcing the club to approach Glasgow District Council in a bid
to have the planning condition relative to Janefield Street revoked.
Members of Glasgow's planning committee yesterday continued
consideration of Celtic's application to have the Janefield Street
condition revoked, pending a site visit and hearing at which all
interested parties will be free to express their views. This is expected
to take place in the first week in August, just days before the
Newcastle match.
Council planners suggested a compromise whereby the planning condition
could be suspended until December 31, giving Celtic the chance to
upgrade Celtic Walk by widening and hard surfacing. However, even if
that were carried out, it seems the police would still have worries.
They are concerned that supporters would continue to approach from
Holywell Street and then require to negotiate a double bend to enter the
walkway. They would then be merging into an existing flow from Stamford
Street with ''potential for conflict''.
According to the police assessment, 12,000 fans could approach from
Stamford Street and try to use the walkway. Alternatively, they could
all try to use Janefield Street West in protest at the restriction.
''This does not augur well for the return of the supporters to their
new stadium if they are to be in immediate conflict with the
authorities,'' the police report says.
* Celtic stepped in yesterday to help three cousins who had their team
mementos stolen at knifepoint by a gang of youths.
Gillian Docherty, 12, and Graham Prentice, 17, both from Stirling, and
15-year-old Michael Dubrick, who was visiting from Ontario -- had been
VIP guests at Celtic Park. However, as they walked home on Wednesday
afternoon in London Road, the muggers forced them to hand over cameras,
a baseball cap, and cash.
Celtic director William Haughey ordered another meeting for Gillian
and Graham with their heroes when the team returns from Germany next
week. Michael will miss it because he flew home yesterday. However, like
his Scottish cousins, he will receive a copy of the club's new video.

JERUSALEM: The city fathers of Jerusalem have turned down a copy of
Michelangelo's nude statue of the Biblical King David, saying it is
still too shocking to be shown publicly. The offer of a replica came
from Florence, where the original is housed, as a gift to mark 3000
years since David's conquest of the city.

RIO DE JANEIRO: An 11-year-old girl in south-eastern Brazil gave birth
to a healthy 6lb 7oz boy, a Rio newspaper reported. An obstetrician in
Serrana, a small town in Sao Paulo state, said the delivery was by
Caesarean section because the girl's uterus was not yet fully developed.
The girl told authorities that the father was a 45-year-old married man
who fled the town.

STOCKHOLM: Volvo is recalling 30,000 cars worldwide to fix a defect in
the seat belts. The Swedish company said a manufacturing fault means the
front seat belt may come loose in a collision at high speed. Volvo will
reinforce the piece of metal that fastens the seat belt to the inside of
the car. The recall affects 1992 and 1993 models of the Volvo 740, 940,
and 960.

POLICE and trading standards officers have urged people across
Scotland to be on the lookout for a misleading chain letter which asks
for business cards to be sent to a terminally ill youngster in Surrey.
The letter is thought to have originated from the genuine appeal of a
young boy suffering from leukemia. Friends and relatives of Craig
Shergold, from Carshalton, asked that he be sent get well cards to cheer
him up during his illness.
He entered the Guinness Book of Records in 1991 after receiving
16,250,692 cards. He then asked that no more cards were sent.
However, it appears the chain letters asking for cards remained in
circulation and were mistakenly altered over the years, changing the
boy's name, address, and the type of cards he collected.
Mr Tom Chiesa, Glasgow City Council depute estates surveyor, told The
Herald about the chain letter. He said it had been given to one city
director who then passed it to 10 colleagues as requested.
He added: ''I knew something wasn't quite right, so I phoned the local
police in Surrey to find out what was going on and they said I should
throw it in the bin.''
Sutton trading standards officer Mike Bellamy allayed fears that the
cards were being used for any unauthorized purpose, such as compiling
trade directories for junk mail companies.
Mr Bellamy said: ''Some well-meaning people have taken it upon
themselves to put out this chain letter but alterations to the original
appear to have cropped up, perhaps with typing mistakes or errors from
poor quality faxes and photocopies.
''There is nothing untoward about it. It was a genuine idea that got
out of hand but people should completely disregard it.''

<HEADLINE>IRA prisoners win right to challenge parole delays</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FIVE convicted IRA terrorists, who were jailed for life, yesterday won
permission to bring a High Court challenge against ''irrational and
unreasonable'' delays in the hearing of their applications for parole.
Mr Edward Fitzgerald, QC, appearing for all five, argued that they
were legally entitled to an immediate hearing before the Parole Board as
they had now completed the 20-year tariffs on their discretionary life
sentences imposed for retribution and deterrence.
The five include Brendan Dowd, at one time named as top terrorist
organiser in Britain, and Paul Norney, the longest serving Irish
Republican prisoner. The other three are Sean Kinsella, Stephen Nordone,
and Noel Gibson.
Sixteen life sentences were passed on them at Manchester Crown Court
in 1976 after they were found guilty on charges including conspiracy to
murder and cause explosions, attempted murder, and possessing arms and
explosives.
Mr Fitzgerald told Mr Justice Owen the only reason justifying their
continued detention could be that they presented a danger to the public.
In view of the Northern Ireland ceasefire, they were no longer
dangerous and their rights were being violated by being kept in prison.
The board was insisting on following ''inflexible'' rules and had
unfairly accused the five of wanting to ''queue jump'', said Mr
Fitzgerald.
It was accepted that, in yesterday's case, it would be impossible for
a hearing to take place before September ''for practical reasons''.
However, the Parole Board had indicated that they would not be allowed
to queue jump and hearings had been arranged for them on December 11.
Despite opposition from the board, Mr Justice Owen said there was ''an
arguable point'' which should go to a full judicial review hearing as
''in the long run'' it affected many other discretionary lifers.
The judge will decide on Monday whether the five can also launch a
legal challenge against the Home Secretary's handling of their case.
Meanwhile, a fifth Irish terrorist has joined the ''dirty'' protest at
the top security unit at Whitemoor prison, Cambridgeshire, it was
disclosed last night.
The protest started last week when the IRA men began wearing only
blankets and smearing excrement in their cells.
They are protesting about conditions at the jail, scene of an armed
breakout by five IRA men last year. They are also demanding transfers to
jails in Northern Ireland but Home Secretary Michael Howard is unlikely
to authorise this while the protest continues.

<HEADLINE>Scuffles as Sinn Fein starts campaign of street protests</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SINN Fein supporters scuffled with police in Belfast city centre
yesterday when they staged the first of a series of street protests
demanding the Government immediately open all-party talks on the
political future of Northern Ireland.
Several people were arrested during 45 minutes of trouble which
highlighted the warnings from Irish Prime Minister John Bruton on
Thursday that such protests were ''profoundly unhelpful'' and
uncontrollable.
Sinn Fein went ahead with the protest, despite Mr Bruton's call, in a
bid to put pressure on Prime Minister John Major and said they would be
on the streets until talks were convened.
The RUC moved in hard and fast when part of the crowd of around 150
demonstrators staged a sit-down protest in the road outside Belfast City
Hall and blocked traffic. Poster-carrying men and women were dragged
from the street on to the pavement, shouting ''Talks now, talks now''.
The chants quickly turned to ''SS RUC'' as the crowd broke from police
and ran to the main shopping street, Donegal Place, and marched,
shouting, past shoppers.
They were herded into a side street where there were more scuffles --
a number of people were bundled into the back of armoured police Land
Rovers -- before the crowd dispersed after a brief demonstration outside
a police station.
One leading Sinn Fein member, Mr Tom Hartley, a former party chairman,
said the street protests would go on until the Government agreed to
start all-party talks. He said: ''We will continue to protest. We will
continue to highlight the fact that the British Government is refusing
to move in terms of the peace process.''
He called for immediate round-table, all-party talks and said that
until that happened ''we will be on the streets''.
Sinn Fein's president, Mr Gerry Adams, last night called on Mr Major
to ''stop stalling and delaying'' and agree with Mr Bruton the
structure, nature and date for all party talks.
Mr Bruton warned yesterday, in comments which showed up a rift between
the Irish Government and Sinn Fein on the way to move the peace process
forward, that ''political solutions are found through dialogue, not in
street confrontations''.
He went on: ''Those who organise street demonstrations cannot control
them completely, whatever their initial intentions.''
Meanwhile, Northern Ireland Political Development Minister, Mr Michael
Ancram, is to have talks today with a group of leading Irish-Americans
who helped broker the IRA ceasefire.
The group, led by former Congressman Bruce Morrison, will also be
meeting Mr Adams and leading loyalists over the weekend in a bid to see
if they can help break the deadlock.
On Monday, the group, including businessman Bill Flynn and publisher
Niall O'Dowd, travel to Dublin for talks with Mr Bruton and the deputy
Irish Prime Minister, Mr Dick Spring.
Mr O'Dowd said yesterday, before leaving the US, that there was a
general view in America that the peace process was in deep crisis.
''We believe that it needs the attention of the US and, with the
President coming to Ireland in November, we think it is an important
time to come over and assess what is happening on the streets -- to see
why what looked to be so promising just a few months ago has now run
into such difficulties.''
A letter was on its way to Mr Clinton last night calling on him to
reverse his decision to allow Sinn Fein to raise funds in America until
republicans call off their continuing campaign of punishment beatings.
The human rights group, Families Against Intimidation and Terror,
handed the letter to a US official during a meeting at the American
Consulate in Belfast.

A SENIOR manager of Tate &amp; Lyle last night dispelled hopes that
Government grant-aid could help to save the company's sugar refinery at
Greenock.
Mr Clive Rutherford, deputy managing director of Tate &amp; Lyle Sugars,
said any financial intervention would almost certainly breach European
Union rules, and would not yield the annual savings to be made by
transferring production to London.
His pessimistic outlook for the Greenock plant followed expressions of
concern about its demise from the Bishop of Paisley and the Scottish
Industry Minister, Mr George Kynoch.
The local MP, Dr Norman Godman, has suggested that Scottish Office aid
could be used to make the Greenock factory financially viable, while a
meeting of the 169 staff yesterday agreed to campaign against closure.
Tate &amp; Lyle has insisted that shutting the refinery, with the loss of
all jobs, is only a proposal at this stage. However, most observers
believe Greenock's -- and Scotland's -- last sugar refinery will close
as planned in 1997.
Mr Rutherford said the company had expected opposition to its proposal
but believed it was acting on ''a strong economic case'', since
expansion at London would cost #8m less than in Greenock and would allow
#3m of savings in operating expenses each year.
He added: ''We will listen to any serious alternative but we
understand any capital investment by the Government would be regarded by
the EU as a distortion of competition in the industry.
''In any case, because the London refinery is eight times bigger than
the plant at Greenock, it offers significant economies of scale. No-one
would now design a sugar refinery with a capacity of only 130,000
tonnes, which is the limit at Greenock.''
His scepticism appeared to be mirrored by Mr Kynoch, whose public
statement was limited to an expression of disappointment; a request to
Renfrewshire Enterprise to contact the company and its workers; and an
invitation to meet Dr Godman on Monday.
However, the Rt Rev John Mone, whose diocese includes Greenock, said
he would be writing to Tate &amp; Lyle highlighting the loyalty of the
workforce and the inevitable knock-on effect of job losses.
Meanwhile, the TGWU said its members at the refinery had agreed to
''do everything to keep this plant open and retain every job''.
Mr Jimmy Livingston, the union's local organiser, said he would meet
Dr Godman, MEP Hugh McMahon, and leaders of Inverclyde District Council
to discuss a campaign against closure.

AN angry councillor has attacked plans to move a troublesome family
into his ward.
Social workers intend to move the controversial Foster family --
dubbed ''monsters'' by a sheriff -- into new accommodation in the
Merkinch area of Inverness.
The area's district councillor, Mr Ally Graham, says he will urge
Highland Regional Council's social work department to reverse the
decision.
Robert and Joan Foster, and their five children, were ordered out of
their council house in Foyers, by Loch Ness, this year after a court
action upheld claims of anti-social behaviour.
At the hearing, Sheriff James Fraser said ''all hell was let loose''
in the usually peaceful village when the Fosters arrived. The family was
accused of a lengthy catalogue of incidents involving alleged vandalism,
violence, and threats of violence.
The Fosters are now believed to have been offered a six-month lease on
a three-bedroomed former council house under social work department
guidance. It is thought the family have been made an offer by a landlady
sympathetic to their plight.
Mr Graham, who is convener of the district council's housing
committee, said yesterday: ''I have already expressed my opposition to
this plan in a letter to social work. I hope they take my views on
board.
He added: ''I think the Merkinch area has enough problems on its hands
already without this.''

<HEADLINE>Sanctions threatened unless Strathclyde's Chief Constable changes mind on call-out fees.  Police surgeons in pay protest</HEADLINE>

POLICE surgeons covering rural parts of Ayrshire have threatened to
impose sanctions, and may even resign en masse, unless Strathclyde's
Chief Constable rescinds a decision to abolish their payments covering
travelling time to and from call-outs.
Strathclyde's 148 police surgeons -- many of them general
practitioners who have acquired additional forensic expertise and
provide rota cover for the police -- have been informed that their
current system of payment is to change.
Dr Katharine Morrison, who lives in Mauchline and is principal police
surgeon for the Kilmarnock division of Strathclyde Police, said that
police surgeons like herself, who worked in rural areas and often had to
cover considerable distances to attend calls, would lose between 25% and
30% of their income with no commensurate drop in hours under the new
rules.
She said that while police surgeons working in cities tended to go
from call to call while on duty, the single call-out represented the
more common pattern in rural areas.
Dr Morrison said that she was often called to attend Kilmarnock police
station -- a 35-minute trip from Mauchline where she is a GP -- and that
no doctors in Kilmarnock itself were prepared to take on the duties of a
police surgeon. The Kilmarnock police division also was served by a
doctor from Clarkston, Glasgow, she said.
She added that she and her colleagues received a retainer of #5 a day
when on duty, and that the removal of travel time from income could make
police work for some doctors in rural areas prohibitive.
Police surgeons often had to attend harrowing crime scenes and were
expected to have the tact and sensitivity to deal with cases of rape and
physical and sexual abuse of children, said Dr Morrison. Some of her
colleagues had been assaulted when dealing with dangerous drug addicts.
''We feel betrayed,'' she said. ''We are waiting for a reply from the
Chief Constable and we have given him until August 1 to reply
favourably. The British Medical Association and the Association of
Police Surgeons are willing to negotiate for us.
''But if he does not reply favourably, we will hold another meeting of
police surgeons in Ayrshire. We have already agreed that we will put
sanctions into operation from August 1. They are going to be disruptive
and they are going to cost the police money.'' Dr Morrison said the
sanctions would be used to put pressure on the police, but if, after an
unspecified amount of time, the police surgeons were getting nowhere,
they would ''push for mass resignations''.
''There is widespread support in Ayrshire for mass resignation, but
less in Glasgow because they earn more than us,'' she said.
''If they force us to resign it will really cripple some police
functions and unfortunately it will be a terrible nuisance to the
general public who do not realise what we do.''
It is understood that representatives of police surgeons in Glasgow,
Paisley and Lanark have sought a meeting with the Chief Constable to
discuss their concerns and that they may also consider imposing
sanctions.
Dr Martin Knight, honorary secretary of the Association of Police
Surgeons, said that the national agreement negotiated between the BMA,
his association and the Local Government Management Board did not cover
travelling time payments, and that the APS and the BMA had always taken
the view that this should be agreed at local level.
He added that the APS was currently in negotiation with the LGMB on a
restructuring of the scale of fees, including travel payments.
A spokeswoman for Strathclyde Police said: ''The current national
agreement between the police force and police surgeons states that
travel time should only be paid in circumstances where the examination
and notes, i.e. the work itself, take in excess of one hour to complete.
''In circumstances where the examination and notes take less than one
hour, the current agreement makes it clear that payment for travel time
should not be paid.
''Strathclyde Police has been out of step with several other police
forces in paying for travel time when examination and note-taking take
less than one hour to complete. The question of payment for surgeons'
travel time is currently the subject of negotiations at national level.
''Strathclyde Police recognises the value of the service offered by
police surgeons and the goodwill they have shown over many years.
''We have extended an invitation to meet those police surgeons'
representatives who have expressed concern about the matter and hope
that the issue can be remedied amicably.''

A BRITISH plane heading for Hong Kong, with more than 250 passengers
on board, has been forced to land at Moscow by air traffic controllers.
It had to spend eight hours on the ground before returning to London.
The Virgin Atlantic Airbus A340 was instructed to land after it took a
new route over Russia which the airline believed was agreed.
It returned to Heathrow rather than completing its journey after the
Russian action.
Virgin said it had been travelling over the Soviet Union and Russia
for six years. ''The pilot took the right action in landing the
aircraft. We have apologised to the passengers and will compensate them
fully for their experience, and hope it never happens again,'' a
spokesman said.
He denied a report that a Russian MiG was scrambled to intercept the
plane: ''That is completely untrue.''
Virgin said the new route, which cuts 45 minutes off the journey, had
been agreed with the Russian authorities several days ago.
The flight left Heathrow on Thursday night but in the early hours of
yesterday, as the jet began to divert to the more northerly new route,
Moscow controllers issued a series of warnings then ordered an immediate
landing at Sheremetyevo airport.
''We have flown over Russia on the route to Hong Kong more than 600
times without problem and have been in negotiation for some time to use
this new route, which we were using for the first time,'' the spokesman
said. ''We hope there will be no further teething troubles.''

A FORMER miner who feels cheated because he cannot get his hands on
any of the money he paid into the Mineworkers Pension Fund might have
lit a spark which could lead to a change in the rules of the #7000m
fund.
Mr John Dempsey, 53, of Craigens, Cumnock, was made redundant in 1985.
Now in poor health, with asthma and arthritis, he is angered by a rule
change made in 1992 which allowed men younger than himself to draw a
pension at 50 -- while he cannot get any cash for another seven years
until he is 60.
He said: ''I may never make it to 60. A lot of men I worked with were
dead before 60. I don't grudge these younger men who can get the pension
at 50 but they have not given the service to the industry of blokes like
myself.
''We have paid into the same fund . . . and for much longer.''
He contacted his MP, Mr George Foulkes, who wrote to the trustees.
They said they were reluctant to allow miners to convert to a private
pension, because they feared people might be conned.
However, the issue is likely to be put on the agenda of the next
trustees meeting next month.
The Mineworkers Pension Fund is understood to have a substantial
surplus and according to the rules approved by Parliament, at least 50%
of this surplus has to be used to improve benefits to members.
Mr Foulkes said: ''You can't get any more deserving people that the
ones I am referring to. I have had a steady stream of letters from
Ayrshire miners. Now what we need to do is to lobby the trustees before
their next meeting.''
He believes around 500 ex-miners in his constituency could be caught
in the same situation as Mr Dempsey.

Local mothers show sympathy for man who stabbed child sex offender to
death
A FATHER who stabbed a convicted child sex offender to death was
jailed for eight years at the High Court in Edinburgh yesterday.
There were gasps and murmurs of disbelief from the public benches as
the sentence was passed.
Paul Strathearn, 33, had appeared for sentence after being found
guilty of the culpable homicide of Lawrence Leydon in Southouse Medway,
Edinburgh, earlier this year. Relatives said an appeal would be lodged.
Later, in the Southhouse area, many residents condemned the sentence
as harsh and undeserved, as did relatives of Strathearn.
Leydon, 36, a joiner, had been given two years' probation at Edinburgh
Sheriff Court in May last year for an indecency offence involving a
10-year-old boy at a city construction site.
This sentence led to anger in the Southhouse area and detectives
involved in what was then a murder inquiry encountered difficulties in
obtaining information.
At the time of his death last February, detectives declined to confirm
suggestions that a ''vigilante'' style attack had taken place.
Privately, senior officers admitted that they faced one of their most
difficult investigations.
Yesterday, the judge, Lord Prosser, said he had to impose a custodial
sentence: ''The fact is that this was an attack which in its own terms
was of murderous quality. There can be no question of a non-custodial
sentence.''
Strathearn, said to have 20 previous convictions, had chased his
victim into his home, stabbing him eight times with a large knife.
The court had been told that Leydon lived in a ''pig sty'' flat where
39 bags of maggot-infested rubbish had to be cleared by police and
council staff.
At Strathearn's trial, the jury reduced the charge of murder to one of
culpable homicide.
Strathearn was said to have been suffering from depression and to have
told police: ''Something just snapped in my head. I stabbed Mr Leydon
several times. I did not look at him.
''I walked out of the house and down the stairs. I remember stopping
outside a cemetery and thinking about what I had done.''
Yesterday, his defence counsel, Mr Derek Ogg, told the court: ''It is
clear this offence was a non-premeditated crime committed by a man who
was clearly unwell for some time.''
He suggested that a lenient sentence should be imposed in the
circumstances.
As the accused was being led from the court, relatives said: ''The
sentence was harsh and we plan to appeal.''
The same mood was evident in Southhouse, where mothers said they were
angry at the severity of the sentence.
Mrs Elizabeth Wagstaff, who has two young children, said: ''I think it
is very severe. People in this area have been angry about this whole
matter for months.
''I have two sons and I think any mother would feel that an eight-year
sentence was too much.''
Mrs Wendy Wood, 29, who has four children, added: ''Obviously, he
deserved to be punished for taking a life but I think eight years is too
much.''
Mr Allan Melrose, 30, said: ''I never knew the man who died but I
still think it was a hard sentence.
''In the circumstances, why could the judge not have sentenced him to
community service, which could have been more beneficial for
everybody?''

A RIVER bailiff who resigned when he was passed over for promotion has
lost his constructive dismissal claim.
Mr James Adam, of Rattray, Blairgowrie, was employed by Tay District
Salmon Fisheries Board from March 1985 until April last year when he
wrote a letter to his superintendent.
He complained about the promotion of another bailiff to the post of
leading bailiff, saying that the promoted person was ''a less
experienced man'' and that ''this was the fourth time such a thing had
happened''.
Solicitors for the board rejected his claim that he had been
constructively dismissed and invited him to start work again.
They also pointed out that all bailiffs were considered for promotion
to leading bailiff when a position arose, and that it was awarded on
merit.
The tribunal ruled: ''There was nothing in the contract of employment
which provided for any specific promotional ladder.
''Accordingly, each promotion when it occurred was simply dealt with
on an ad-hoc basis and in accordance with the circumstances at the
time.''
It noted that the board did not question the applicant's ability to be
an ordinary bailiff.
The findings went on: ''It was true that there was some measure of a
clash of personality between the applicant and the superintendent . . .
the evidence was not such as to suggest the superintendent had behaved
in a manner so overbearing as to make it impossible for the applicant to
continue in his employment.''
The majority of the tribunal concluded there was not sufficient
evidence to establish constructive dismissal and that the application
failed.
One dissenting member took the view that the evidence of the board's
conduct was enough to set up a repudiatory breach of contract, and
therefore to set up a constructive dismissal, and if that view had been
established the dismissal would have been unfair.

A MAN convicted of a series of unprovoked attacks in the centre of
Edinburgh was jailed yesterday for seven years.
Lord Philip told James Ketchen, 20, at the High Court: ''It is clear
you have deliberately made it your business to make this city a more
dangerous and less pleasant place.''
Ketchen, a first offender, of Wester Drylaw Drive, Edinburgh, was
found guilty of eight charges of assault and breach of the peace.
One attack was on four students after a row when he jumped a taxi
queue on Waverley Bridge on December 4 last year.
He punched two women and two men, students at Queen Margaret College,
Edinburgh, and kicked one of the men. He also kneed a girl student who
was knocked unconscious.
On August 14 last year, Mr David Deans, 27, was accosted by Ketchen
and other youths in Princes Street. Mr Deans was stabbed in the neck to
the danger of his life.
Ketchen claimed the students had attacked him at the taxi queue and
that he was acting in self defence. He denied stabbing Mr Deans, and
blamed another man.

MODELS in swimsuits -- some more scanty than others -- and a 20ft-long
inflatable whale greeted about 1300 shareholders turning up yesterday
for the annual meeting of Marks &amp; Spencer.
The six models, in orange and pink and also blue and turquoise lycra
costumes, were there in support of fashion designer Ms Liza Bruce, who
is suing M&amp;S for #5m. Ms Bruce said she had issued a writ, alleging that
her distinctive swimsuit design had been copied in breach of copyright.
The whale was a gimmick of 60 protesters from the Environmental
Investigation Agency, angry that M&amp;S buys fish from the Faroese, who
still perpetrate whale slaughter. They were carrying placards spattered
with red paint to indicate blood.
The two groups seemed to get on remarkably well, to the bemusement of
shareholders, who had to file between them as they entered the Grosvenor
Hotel in London's Park Lane.
M&amp;S chairman Sir Richard Greenbury managed to avoid the spectacle,
slipping in through a back door, but this has been a week when the
sometimes rather acerbic and blunt-speaking director felt he has had
more than his fair share of publicity and controversy.
Monday began disastrously for him at 6am when Chancellor Kenneth
Clarke announced that he would tax share options as income rather than
capital gains, even before he had opened the Greenbury committee's
thorough investigation into directors' pay and its disclosure. The
effect of that was to push many low-paid workers into a higher tax
bracket and they would also have to sell their shares to pay the tax.
By Wednesday, opponents were in full cry and on Thursday he appeared
before the Commons Select Committee on Employment. He admitted the
matter had not been thought through and frankly said that he had made a
mistake. Sir Richard also said that he would not serve on any more
committees -- it was simply not worth the hassle.
The two-hour meeting heard Sir Richard pour scorn on Ms Bruce's
allegations. He told shareholders that she and her lawyers had gone out
their way to court publicity ''clearly implying that the directors have
behaved dishonestly''.
He added that M&amp;S had discovered that the cutting patterns were
significantly different and the manufacturer of the fabric confirmed
that he had created it before Ms Bruce had started using it and no-one
had exclusive copyright.
Also, Ms Bruce had not invented the distinctive dip-dyeing technique.
At the end, he did have the satisfaction of a round of shareholder
applause, the first public plaudits of the week.
At least he should be able to enjoy a cooler weekend.

THE Scottish National Party continued to make political capital
yesterday out of Labour backing down on regional assemblies for England.
SNP leader Alex Salmond has written to the Shadow Scottish Secretary,
Mr George Robertson, asking him to explain ''glaring inconsistencies''
in the matter.
SNP researchers have dug out an interview in January in which Mr
Robertson stated: ''. . . our constitutional plans are not confined to
Scotland and Wales. It will also embrace regional government in England,
and that's a firm commitment too.''
Mr Salmond said: ''This blatant attempt to rewrite the history of only
six months ago highlights exactly why New Labour can't be trusted to
deliver on their Scottish commitments. Devoid of principle, New Labour
will do or say anything in line with the prevailing political wind.''

MURDER accused Angus Malavin claimed yesterday he was attacked by a
former boxer who accused him of having sex with his wife.
Mr Malavin, 32, said Mr Iain MacDonald then asked if he was ''chasing
somebody else's wife'', kissed him on the neck, and punched him on the
mouth.
He added: ''I went flying across the room, up in the air, and landed
on my back.''
However, Mr Malavin denied that after another attack in a pub, which
left him with severe face injuries and scarred for life, he shot Mr
MacDonald, 30, and his 34-year-old brother Allan outside an Orange hall.
He told the High Court in Glasgow he did not know who slashed him in a
public house on January 2 last.
Mr Malavin denies shooting and murdering Mr Allan MacDonald and
attempting to murder Mr Iain MacDonald in Sandbank Crescent, Maryhill,
Glasgow, on March l6 last, and has lodged a special defence of alibi.
Yesterday, the Crown withdrew two charges of assaulting MrIain
MacDonald.
Earlier, the court heard that the MacDonald brothers had just left the
Orange hall in Sandbank Street, Maryhill, when a hooded gunman shot
Allan in the back and then chased and shot Iain in the right shoulder
with a shotgun.
Allan, of Sandbank Street, died within minutes.
Mr Iain MacDonald, c/o the police, claimed the man who shot them was
Malavin.
Mr Malavin, an oil-rig worker, told his counsel, Mr Herbert Kerrigan,
QC, he was in a Maryhill snooker hall last November at the time Mr Iain
MacDonald accused him of having sex with his wife and then attacked him.
The accused told the court he had never had sex with MacDonald's wife.
On January 2, last he was playing darts in a Maryhill public house,
when he was attacked and scarred for life with tumblers or bottles.
Questioned by Mr Kerrigan, he denied he knew the man who scarred him
was Mr Iain MacDonald and that he refused to name the attacker to police
because he ''wanted to resolve matters himself''.
The trial continues.

CHANCELLOR Kenneth Clarke was under fire yesterday from both the Tory
back benches and the City as the row escalated over employee share
options.
There was growing support on the back benches for Mr Clarke to perform
a rapid U-turn as it emerged that the measure, aimed at so-called ''fat
cats'', would hit thousands of modestly paid workers.
An immediate change appears to have been ruled out but opinion was
growing at Westminster last night that there may be some sort of change
in the Finance Bill which will follow the Budget in November.
Last night, a senior Tory back bencher branded as ''scandalous'' the
changes to share option scheme taxation proposed by the Chancellor.
Speaking at the launch of a pressure group to fight the changes, Mr
David Shaw, vice chairman of the Conservative Finance Committee, hinted
that his stand had the silent support of some Ministers.
The group, which claims the backing of several back benchers and
figures from the worlds of business, law, and accountancy, has called on
Mr Clarke to tear up his proposals.
Mr Shaw promised a vigorous fight right through the summer recess and,
if necessary, right up to the Finance Bill vote.
He said that, if Mr Clarke would not scrap the taxation scheme, he
should at least limit its impact to those with larger numbers of
options.
However, Mr Clarke insisted he was sticking to his guns, despite the
admission of Marks &amp; Spencer chairman Sir Richard Greenbury, who headed
the inquiry into boardroom pay, that his committee had got it wrong.
Sir Richard urged Mr Clarke -- who had acted immediately on the
committee's recommendation -- to reverse his decision to end tax relief
on executive share option schemes.
Mr Shaw said the Greenbury committee had made a ''devastating
mistake'' on share options and that the proposals would hit the pockets
of ordinary workers on the shop floor, in typing pools, and in
management.
More than 500,000 of these low and middle income earners would lose
thousands of pounds, while the ''fat cat'' executives would barely
notice any loss, he said.
He launched a scathing attack on the restrospective nature of the
changes which would see employees paying tax on options taken out years
before this week's announcement.
In some cases, employees who had taken out loans or mortgages in the
expectation of cashing in their options free of income tax would be left
in dire financial straits, he claimed.
Mr Shaw said: ''It is quite scandalous, because it is not just
retrospective taxation for one or two months but it can actually affect
people who have had share options for three years or four prior to the
Chancellor's announcement.''
Lord Wolfson of Sunningdale, chairman of clothing retailers Next, said
that threequarters of his store managers had taken out share options. He
said: ''It enables them to be owners as well as managers and they take a
certain pride and joy in the success of the company.
''I have believed in fairly deep share-option schemes for quite a
while and I am therefore annoyed that this restrospective legislation is
being proposed. It is quite disgraceful for a Conservative Government to
be enacting restrospective legislation of this kind.
''I hope that when the Chancellor has time to read the Greenbury
report, which he obviously hasn't done, he will be able to form a
different view of what he is proposing -- a view which will be much more
sensible.''
The Tory MP for Stafford, Mr Bill Cash, said: ''This is a classic
banana skin. A mistake has clearly been made. It doesn't help to keep on
saying, 'Oh well, I knew I was right to do this in the first place' when
it was done at very short notice.
''The intention was to deal with executives who were taking a
disproportionate amount out of the system and we have ended up hitting
our own people.''
Mr Jacques Arnold, Tory MP for Gravesham, added: ''There are tens of
thousands of people who work for major blue chip companies who have very
small-scale share options. They have not been taxed thanks to
Conservative legislation and Greenbury was quite wrong to sweep them
into this trap.''
Mr Clarke, interviewed on BBC Radio, insisted the committee was right
to recommend that share options should be taxed as income rather than
capital gains. ''I think I can reassure them that they got it right,
even if they do not seem to quite understand what they recommended.''
Mr Clarke, who acted within minutes of publication of the report --
6am on Monday -- said he knew the committee would recommend that the tax
on share options should be changed, a measure the Treasury had
considered for two years.
He initially said the committee drew up its recommendations on the
advice of tax experts but when told this was not the case he retorted:
''They should not have made recommendations about taxation.''
When share-option schemes were introduced in 1984 they were not
intended for ordinary employees, for whom there were other schemes, such
as save-as-you-earn, to encourage wider share ownership.
Firms such as Asda, which was about to introduce a share- options
scheme for its staff, were effectively giving employees a #6000 income
tax free pay rise.
''There are a lot of people who don't get a #6000 bonus income tax
free and it underlines the anomaly this particular form of executive
share- option scheme has become,'' Mr Clarke said.
More than 6000 companies have set up share-option schemes in the past
10 years, involving more than half a million employees, a far greater
number than have opted for SAYE and other incentive schemes which Mr
Clarke suggested might be more appropriate.
The disclosure that the change would hit many ordinary workers could
have proved embarrassing for Labour, who on Monday proclaimed Mr
Clarke's announcement as a victory for the campaign to end tax relief of
executive share options.
However, the Labour Party's city spokesman, Mr Alistair Darling,
insisted last night that Labour had never wanted to penalise lower and
middle ranking staff.
He said: ''Right from the start, what we have always said is that what
we are dealing with is abuse in the boardroom, particularly the
privatised utilities. It has never been the intention of anybody to get
those in middle management or those on the shop floor.''
He called on Mr Clarke to produce revised proposals to help those
ordinary staff caught by the changes.
Mr Darling said: ''What the Chancellor now needs to do is to bring
forward a sophisticated and properly judged response rather than jump in
feet first with the result that there will be people, through no fault
of their own, who were going to be caught up in an attempt to do
something about executive pay.''

FORMER United States President George Bush paid a surprise visit to
the Open Championship yesterday and immediately made a confession to his
wife, Barbara.
Arriving at their accommodation overlooking the 18th hole, Mr Bush
pointed to the green and said: ''That is where I four-putted last
year.''
The couple had flown into nearby RAF Leuchars and travelled to St
Andrews with an escort of American security men and Fife police
officers.
They arrived in the home of golf almost unnoticed, although Mr Bush
wore a zip-up jacket with his name on it.
Mr and Mrs Bush watched play on the 18th for about 10 minutes from a
second-floor balcony of the Royal and Ancient clubhouse. They are
expected to spend several days in the area and it is understood Mr Bush
will play at Carnoustie and Elie.
The couple were too late to see American veteran Arnold Palmer
complete his last Open yesterday. After an emotional farewell to the
press corps, Palmer, 65, was swamped by autograph hunters.
Patiently, he signed them all, at the same time dealing with more
questions from reporters.
His age featured in many of them and he agreed: ''I am old.'' Clearly
he is not too worried about it. ''I am happy that I am looking down on
the grass,'' he said.
Though this was his last Open, Palmer does not seem about to hang up
his clubs altogether. Asked when he would retire completely, he said:
''You will never know when I retire. You will just not see me any
more.''
Traffic queues of up to 11 miles built up on the approaches to St
Andrews early yesterday. Police blamed drivers who strayed off the
signposted routes.
The attendance at the Open yesterday was 40,000, the second highest at
a St Andrews Open. The record stands at 42,500 in 1990. The attendance
on Thursday was 32,000.

FOUR people were killed and seven wounded last night when a mortar
bomb landed in a suburb of Sarajevo last night. It exploded just as the
London summit was ending.
Earlier, 10 people, including four children, were wounded as Bosnian
Serbs shelled Sarajevo city centre.
The explosions were seen as another sign of the Serbs' contempt for
the Western stance on former Yugoslavia.
There were also indications last night that the Islamic Conference
states had become impatient with Western policy. They decided at their
meeting in Geneva to supply weaponry to Muslims to defend Bosnia against
''genocide and aggression''. Bosnian Foreign Minister Mohammed Sacirbey
said that some states had decided that the United Nations-imposed arms
embargo was ''invalid''.
The developments appeared to indicate that some Islamic countries
would move promptly to give arms to the Bosnian government.
As the international conference opened in London, the Bosnian Serbs
shrugged off Western threats of a ''decisive response'' to threaten one
Muslim enclave and tighten the noose around another.
Heavy mortar fire hit the Muslim-held town of Zepa yesterday. There
was no word on casualties or damage at the poorly defended mountainous
enclave, which is home to an estimated 16,000 people.
The Serbs first renewed their onslaught on Zepa late on Thursday after
leaders of the enclave refused Bosnian Serb commander General Ratko
Mladic's demand to surrender. They decided to fight on as best they
could because the Serbs insisted on taking prisoner all men between 18
and 55 to exchange for Serb captives.
A Bosnian army statement today said government lines around Zepa town
were holding despite fierce artillery attacks.
Fears for the safety of Muslim civilians grew after the Serbs held all
men of fighting age in Srebrenica, another enclave that fell on July 11.
Refugees who escaped brought with them tales of atrocities, including
mass killings of Muslim men.
''We think that anywhere from 5000 and maybe as many as 10,000 of the
civilian population of Srebrenica have been murdered,'' said Sacirbey.
Bosnian Radio yesterday also reported Serb shelling of the Gorazde
enclave, protected by 320 British troops, which is facing the threat of
mass hunger.
''Regardless of any imminent military threat to Gorazde, it is being
slowly starved and strangled,'' said UN aid spokesman Ron Redmond.
Anti-government Serb forces also increased attacks on another UN
''safe area'', Bihac, in the north-west.

Western leaders threaten all-out attacks to protect safe havens from
the Bosnian Serbs
THE 16-nation Western Allies agreed their war plan last night to
counter the Bosnian Serbs. Massive air strikes were promised, with the
implied threat extending beyond the Gorazde ''safe area''.
US Secretary of State Warren Christopher warned: ''Any air campaign in
Gorazde will include significant attacks on significant targets. There
will be no more pin-prick strikes.''
He said plans for air attacks were well advanced. While they were
based on the Gorazde pocket, they could be extended to cover all UN safe
havens.
A whole range of targets had been identified throughout a large zone
and this was a significant departure from air power operations in Bosnia
that had gone on before.
The US was backed in this by Canada. Its Foreign Minister Andre
Ouellet said the statement by the London conference indicated that all
safe areas in Bosnia would be defended, not just the important centre of
Gorazde.
''It implies that what we are willing to do in regard to Gorazde is
something we are willing to do in regard to any other safe area in the
rest of ex-Yugoslavia.''
The statement read by Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said ''current
Bosnian Serb offences and the continuing siege of Sarajevo must be met
with a firm and rapid response'' and specifically warned against an
attack on Gorazde.
Mr Ouellet said that was made because after the attacks on Srebenica
and Zepa the indication was that the Bosnian Serbs would turn their guns
on Gorazde.
The Serbs leaders were last night being given the warning by
telephone. The US has agreed to put all its resources in the air at the
call of UN commanders on the ground.
A total exclusion zone will be given to the Bosnian Serbs and if they
defy it, they can expect instant and massive retaliation from the air.
Furthermore the allies are now determined that the newly-forming Rapid
Reaction Force comprising British and French troops will be used if
necessary to open up the Mount Ingman supply route to the Bosnian
capital of Sarajevo. If the Serbs interfere with UN convoys in future,
or take hostages, they will also face military retaliation.
Mr Christopher said that there was general agreement that this was a
high risk strategy, but the allies would not be deterred from any fresh
threats of hostage taking. Yesterday's conference had balanced all the
risks.
The risks, however, could intensify next week. Although President
Clinton called the talks encouraging, Senate Republican leader Bob Dole
dismissed the effort as a ''dazzling display of ducking the problem'',
and will seek Senate approval on Tuesday to ignore unilaterally the
UN-imposed arms embargo.
Such a move would force the UN to withdraw its peacekeeping force.
The London assurances also failed to impress Bosnia's Prime Minister,
who accused the Western leaders of failing to protect besieged Muslims,
saying their warning of air strikes would give ''a green light'' for
more Serb attacks.
''It's another half-measure, another fig-leaf,'' Mr Haris Silajdzic
said. ''This will make the Serb terrorists feel very confident. Once
more the international community has backed down.''
He said the Serbs simply would lay off Gorazde, instead turning their
guns on four other enclaves. ''They will use this as a cue. The green
light is burning for them and is still burning,'' the Bosnian leader
said.
Mr Rifkind emphasised that his announcements after the eight-hour
London conference were those of a ''chairman's statement'', which seemed
on the surface vague and indicating a ''patch-up'' job at the
conference. This was essential in order to keep the Russians on line.
They were demanding along with the Ukrainians and UN Secretary General
Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali one more attempt at diplomatic negotiations. Mr
Rifkind stressed that the meeting calls upon the Serb capital of
Belgrade and the Bosnian capital Sarajevo to recognise each other as
separate entities and this appears to have satisfied the Russians, who
will also be emphasising to their Serb allies that this time the UN and
Nato forces mean business.
At first this seemed to produce an instant result, with reports of
Belgrade recognising Bosnia, a vital move for negotiations. However,
later the US said a deal with Serbia on the recognition of Bosnia in
exchange for relief from UN sanctions had not yet been struck.
Mr Rifkind also revealed the deployment of the Rapid Reaction Force in
Sarajevo.
He said a battalion would be made available to the UN commander for
peace-keeping duties there.
''This underlines the determination of the United Nations to ensure
access to Sarajevo for delivery of provisions to the civilian population
and to re-supply our forces,'' he said.
The support of the rapid reaction force would protect Unprofor in
maintaining access to the beleaguered capital.
Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali appears to have reluctantly acknowledged that
the cumbersome UN bureaucracy can no longer hold up any military action
in the air.
The American spokesman said later: ''The first message to the Serbs is
you should not attack Gorazde, and the second message is if you do
attack you're going to pay an extremely heavy price. If they are well
advised they will not attack Gorazde.''
He added: ''The Russians do not have a veto.''
The new initiative launched by the Prime Minister earlier in the day
appears to have succeeded in its objective in instilling a new political
leadership to support Unprofor in its tasks. But the agreement expounded
by Mr Rifkind in his careful ''chairman's statement'' was not reached
without difficulty.
Time and again the British, French, American, and Dutch
representatives emphasised that if Gorazde were to fall, Unprofor could
not withstand this further humiliation.
Nato commanders will now work flat out to decide a whole new campaign
and what measures are to be taken, said Mr Rifkind. The US Chief of
Staff, General John Shalikashvili said significantly: ''The chain of
command for Unprofor now stops with the military commanders.''
Mr Major, opening the conference, declared: ''The recent cycle of
attack and counter-attack has threatened our ability to continue
peacekeeping and humanitarian work. There is a clear risk that Goradze
and Sarajevo will be the next targets of Serb aggression.
''Nor is the crisis confined to the eastern enclaves. In many parts of
Bosnia today, UN troops are unable to carry out their tasks. They have
been fired at and threatened by all sides, taken hostage, and blockaded
in their compounds. Bangladeshi troops in Bihac, for example, have seen
some of the worst fighting rage around them.''
Mr Major's message seemed to have succeeded; ''I believe we have
reached a turning point for the United Nations' mission. I invited you
here because I believe new, collective decisions are needed urgently. We
cannot afford different noises from different capitals.''
The hope now is that the Serbs will be deterred from further action
and reconsider restoring a ceasefire and negotiations.
