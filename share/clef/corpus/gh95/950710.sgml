GREENPEACE was on a high after taking on - and beating - Shell over
the Brent Spar issue.
Now comes the big one - the battle against nuclear testing.
AND ALREADY THE SIGNS ARE THE FRENCH ARE ON THE RETREAT.
The international community is lining up against the over-reaction
from Paris.
France has gone totally over the top in its use of military might to
storm Rainbow Warrior II.
It seems France is quite willing to use the same tactics as in the
last clash with Greenpeace 10 years ago.
Then French secret service agents bombed the first Rainbow Warrior -
killing a Greenpeace activist.
Most ordinary people are behind Greenpeace on the testing issue.
But one thing is certain - the organisation will not stop its protest
in the face of French attacks.
WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC IS ANOTHER PUBLIC RELATIONS
VICTORY FOR GREENPEACE.
France may yet have to learn the same lesson as the oil giant.

ONCE upon a time naming your offspring was a simple matter.
A new father wandering down to the Registry Office after wetting the
baby's head didn't have to tax his befuddled brain too much.
A boy was John or Jim.
Girls were called Mary or Margaret.
But no longer.
Amongst the top ten girls' names are Lauren and Megan.
Andy, the previous boys' number one, has been booted into touch by
Ryan - no doubt in deference to a certain Manchester football star.
Other exotic names appear in the boys' list.

<TEXT>
THE Conservatives could lose the General Election by 200 seats unless
they win back the support of the Tory press, former deputy party
chairman Lord Archer warned yesterday.
Lord Archer, a close ally of the Prime Minister, admitted that the
party faced an uphill task in winning round those papers which came out
against Mr Major in the leadership contest.
The Times, the Daily Telegraph, the Daily Mail, and the Sun -- all
traditional Tory supporters -- infuriated the Major camp by calling for
a change of leadership to save the party from election defeat.
Lord Archer, in an interview with GMTV's Sunday programme, admitted
their attacks had been damaging and said there may not be enough time
left to repair the harm done.
''I wonder if we can capture them back, even in two years, because one
thing about the press, once they've made a statement they believe almost
that that's now history and they have to prove it was right, so building
those bridges will be very hard indeed,'' he said.
''Certainly, with what I call our core supporters, we will have to do
that if we are going to win the next election. If we went into the next
election with the Daily Mail, the Sun, and the Telegraph writing in the
way they have been writing in the last two weeks, we would lose by 200
seats.''
His warning was underlined by Labour's Shadow Home Secretary Jack
Straw, who said press coverage of the contest had exposed the
fundamental divisions in the Conservative Party.
''However much the Times and the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph
and the Sun try to wriggle, they are going to find it extremely
difficult to send out a ringing endorsement of the Conservatives with
John Major, the man they excoriated, at the helm,'' he said on BBC Radio
4's World This Weekend.
New Tory Party chairman Brian Mawhinney, however, played down the
importance of the hostile press coverage, saying it had not ''hugely
influenced'' the outcome of the leadership election.
''I don't think anybody is looking for a confrontation with the press,
I'm certainly not. On the other hand, I am very clear where the ultimate
judgments and responsibilities lie. They lie with the Government,'' he
said on the same programme.
''I hope we will be able to persuade the newspapers of the sense of
what we are doing and, if we are not able to persuade all of them, I
hope we will be able to persuade some of them. I am confident that we
will and we will have a robust debate with all of them.''
Speculation about which party the Times and the Sun -- both owned by
Rupert Murdoch -- will support at the election has been particularly
intense.
* Mr Douglas Hurd, the former Foreign Secretary, yesterday called for
a change in Tory Party rules to take the secrecy out of leadership
elections.
He had wanted reform of the rules since Margaret Thatcher was ousted
in 1990, he said.
The Tory backbench 1922 committee has agreed to rule out the
possibility of a further challenge to Mr Major this November.
Senior officers of the '22 are also keen to prevent any further
challenge before the next General Election and are to consider rewriting
the rules when Parliament returns after the recess.

WORLD champion Michael Doohan cruised to victory in the 500cc French
Grand Prix at Le Mans yesterday.
The Australian, who had clocked the fastest time in qualifying,
underlined his supremacy on the Honda as he left his rivals trailing on
the demanding track to clinch his twenty-fourth grand prix win and his
fifth this season.
Doohan covered the 27 laps of the 2.77-mile Bugatti circuit in 46
minutes 10.991 seconds at an average speed of 97.12mph.
Italian Luca Cadalora was second 21.923 seconds behind on a Yamaha and
Australian Daryl Beattie third on a Suzuki, 23.607 seconds behind the
winner.
Doohan's third success in as many races let him extend his lead over
Beattie to 10 points in the world championship in which he has 145
points. ''That's a good thing,'' said Doohan. ''The more points there
are between me and him the better.''
Doohan, who won the race last year, had a poor start and was only
fourth at the first bend. But he was always in front after moving ahead
on the sixth lap.

HENRY Wharton shouldered the pressure and silenced the sceptics with a
performance straight out of the top drawer in front of his home-town
fans in York on Saturday night.
It brought him the vacant European super-middleweight title and could
pave the way for a third world championship chance.
Wharton had used his favourite left hook sparingly against wily
Italian Mauro Galvano, before landing it in a sudden, sharp arc at the
end of the fourth. Taking the full impact, Galvano was counted out after
the bell sounded.
Wharton, who lost world title challenges to Nigel Benn and Chris
Eubank, admitted: ''Some people had written me off and I had to prove I
wasn't finished. Now I'm right back up there.
''I have already won British and Commonwealth titles. That just leaves
one more to go -- the big one.''
Manager Mickey Duff wants another crack at Benn, who took the WBC
title from Galvano and makes his next defence against another Italian,
Vincenzo Nardiello, at London Arena on July 22.

COPA AMERICA
STRIKER Eric Wynalda scored twice as the United States continued an
impressive run with a 2-1 win over Chile in the Copa America on
Saturday.
Wynalda, who plays for German first-division side Bochum, beat the
Chilean defence to a cross by full back Mike Hughes to strike his
opening goal from close range after 15 minutes.
Eleven minutes later he swerved a free kick over the Chilean wall and
goalkeeper Marcelo Ramirez to score again in the first-round Group C
match.
The USA, who are competing in the tournament for only the second time,
had a miserable debut two years ago when they failed to win a single
game.
But their recent form has been a different story, including a 4-0 win
over Mexico and a 3-2 defeat of Nigeria in the recent US Cup.
The North Americans, whose starting line-up included four players
based in Germany, two in England, and one each in the Netherlands and
Italy, dominated the first half, creating plentiful chances with simple
but effective soccer.
Chile enjoyed more possession in the second half but did little with
it.
They pulled a goal back through striker Sebastian Rosental after 58
minutes but their hopes of a recovery disappeared when defender Javier
Margas was sent off for an ugly challenge on Tab Ramos 17 minutes from
time.
Defending champions Argentina needed a goal seven minutes from time to
snatch a 2-1 win over underdogs Bolivia in their first match in the
tournament on Saturday.
Abel Balbo, who was about to be substituted, dived to head in a
rebound after a lob by midfielder Diego Simeone had struck the post and
bounced into his path.
Bolivia had looked like grabbing an unexpected but deserved draw when
substitute Demetrio Angola scored after 78 minutes to cancel out a goal
10 minutes earlier by Gabriel Batistuta.

MIGUEL Indurain moved a step closer to an unprecedented fifth
consecutive triumph in the Tour de France yesterday, when he won the
crucial eighth stage, an individual time-trial, to capture the overall
lead.
Looking effortless despite stifling heat, the Spaniard covered the
demanding 33.75 miles in the countryside near the Belgian city of Liege
in 1hr 4min 16sec to take the coveted yellow jersey from Belgian Johan
Bruyneel.
While not quite as devastating as his previous performances in time
trials, Indurain's masterful display was good enough to give him control
before today's rest day and the tough Alpine stages which follow.
Former race leader Bjarne Riis of Denmark came close to staging a
major upset when he clocked the fastest time after 30.6 miles. But he
was exhausted when he reached the final climb and ended the stage
second, 12 seconds slower than Indurain. Times:
Stage 8 (from Huy to Seraing, 33.75 mile individual time trial): 1, M
Indurain (Spain) Banesto 1hr 4min 16sec (ave speed 31.5mph); 2, B Riis
(Denmark) Gewiss Ballan at 12 secs; 3, T Rominger (Switzerland) Mapei

Metz 1, Partick Thistle 0
WHATEVER else may be said about them (and there is usually no shortage
of material), Partick Thistle could not be accused of self-deception
after they discovered the reality of European football in France at the
weekend. The narrowness of the scoreline in Metz might have tempted
others to persuade themselves that they might even have been unlucky.
Thistle, to their credit, were not indulging in such fantasies. The
management and players were in complete agreement as they returned home
last night that the French team had shown them what it really is about
at a different level.
Derek McWilliams, the man who came closest to snatching a goal, put it
succinctly enough: ''If we had got a draw it would have been the biggest
robbery since the days of Dick Turpin.''
The class of Metz, a young team packed with quality and promise, was
discernible from very early on in the tie and the gulf between the teams
was such that a 1-0 defeat represented a commendable performance. It
could easily have been a lot worse if the Metz goal-scorer, Cyrille
Pouget, had been more accurate in his finishing. He should have had at
least scored a hat trick and there were two or three other chances which
the slick French team engineered.
However, the Scots do deserve credit for the way they stuck to their
task all the way through, especially in the extraordinary humidity that
left them exhausted and many pounds lighter by the end.
That was one reason why John Lambie was not too disappointed. ''I know
we might have stolen a draw,'' he said, ''but to be honest they looked a
tremendous side. I have not seen movement in a team like that for years.
It would be a dream to manage a side like that. I would fancy my chances
in the premier division with them.''
Once he finished his eulogy on Metz, the manager reverted to type when
he pointed out that the tie also demonstrated how much he needs to find
two or three new players.
''When you see the width a team like Metz can get in their play it
shows how much we need the type of player in midfield who can control a
game,'' said Lambie.
''The main thing for our players was the experience. They had never
been up against a European team of that quality before and they all
agree that it was the best side they have faced. They'll remember it for
long enough, and even if we lost, the supporters enjoyed the trip.''
Lambie has not abandoned hope that Thistle will qualify for the next
stage, but that now looks to be possible only as one of the four best
runners-up. He expects Metz to win their last two games, but if Thistle
can beat Zagreb they would be in with a chance of reaching the last 16.
The manager knows also that the club has taken a gamble by
participating in the Intertoto Cup and admits that he does not know the
answer to the main question: Will the exercise have a serious effect on
the players' fitness later in the season? But he seems confident that it
is no more demanding than a pre-season tour.
The last game for Thistle in the section is against Zagreb at Firhill
in two weeks' time, but before that they are off to the Canaries for a
week's break.
McWilliams, who is unable to make the trip for family reasons, nearly
scored one of the finest goals of any Thistle player when he and Tom
Smith worked a marvellous one-two which finished with him side-stepping
the keeper but crashing his shot against the post.
''The ball stuck as I was about to shoot,'' he said. ''It was just one
of those things.''
He is one of 15 Firhill players out of contract, but is likely to opt
for a month-by-month arrangement unless he is given a better deal.
Lambie does not seem all that concerned about the situation, confident
that the list, which includes five regular first-team players, will
shrink once the point is reached when their wages stop.
None of this discontent seems to have any effect on the willingness of
these honest toilers to do their best, however. Not many Scottish sides
could have achieved any better than they did playing in such heat -- it
had been over 100 degrees during the day -- against a genuine smart
side.
Thistle's summer European adventure may be just about over, but from
their point of view at least they will have considered it very
worthwhile.

ASA Hartford settled into his role as assistant to new Manchester City
manager Alan Ball yesterday and said he was confident he could help the
club recapture the glory years.
The former Scotland midfielder is back at Maine Road for a third time
after two spells as a player between 1974 and 1983, and is relishing the
challenge of linking up with former Southampton manager Ball, who
returns from holiday later this week.
Hartford turned down the chance of joining the staff at Premiership
champions Blackburn to become the number two at City and explained:
''Deep down I didn't feel it was right for me to go there.
''But I was very flattered that Ray Harford wanted me to go and work
with him at Ewood Park.''
Hartford, who has had spells as manager at Stockport and Shrewsbury,
added: ''I was part of the City team that last won the League Cup in
1976.
''The City fans have waited patiently for more glory since, but
without success.
''Manchester City have massive potential and it's up to Alan Ball and
myself to rekindle the trophy-winning years.''

GEORGE Graham is confident of winning the fight to restore his
reputation and revive his managerial career when he faces the Football
Association in north London today.
The disgraced Arsenal manager will defend vigorously the misconduct
charges arising out of the on-going Premiership inquiry into transfer
'bungs.'
Both sides will be armed with heavyweight lawyers for a preliminary
hearing which is scheduled for three days and may not produce an
immediate verdict.
Graham, sacked by Arsenal in February after allegations that he
received #425,500 from a Norwegian agent following the transfers of Pal
Lydersen and John Jensen, has been approached by several clubs to make a
comeback.
But they have been discouraged by the threat of a lengthy ban, which
could be extended worldwide, if he is found guilty by the FA commission.
Graham, technically outside the FA's jurisdiction, welcomes the chance
to clear his name. The 50-year-old called the Premier League inquiry a
''kangaroo court,'' and said: ''The allegations are nonsense.''
The FA, briefed for the first time by their own independent barrister
who will advise the three commissioners, are following up the case
accumulated by the 'bungbusters' -- Premier League chief executive Rick
Parry, managers' representative Steve Coppell and Robert Reid QC.
The FA will try the case afresh and will call as many of the witnesses
the Premier League interviewed as possible.
It is unlikely that Norwegian agent Rune Hauge, one of the central
characters in the drama, will again co-operate.
Arsenal's board of directors insisted they knew nothing of the
transfer transactions until the Inland Revenue asked why tax had not
been paid on them.
Though they had accepted Graham's refund more than two months earlier,
they did not sack the man who had taken them to six major trophies in
eight years until the Premier League published its interim report.

PAUL Ince yesterday admitted he felt betrayed by Manchester United as
he hit out at accusations of treachery surrounding his move to Italy.
The England midfielder claimed in a Sunday newpaper that he did not
engineer his #7.5m move to Inter-Milan as suggested by Old Trafford
manager Alex Ferguson.
Ince is reported as saying: ''How can I leave United with the fans
only remembering the word 'traitor' next to my name? I want to be able
to walk through Manchester with my head held high, to look every single
United fan in the eye knowing I did absolutely nothing wrong.
''Paul Ince is not a sneak or a cheat or somebody who skulks behind
people's backs. I didn't try and engineer any kind of move and it is
total rubbish to say otherwise.
''I felt betrayed that anybody at United would think I would do
anything deliberately to hurt the club. That shows me a lack of respect
after five great years at Old Trafford.''
Ferguson was widely quoted in newspapers last week as saying that Ince
told United staff after the FA Cup final that the Wembley match would be
his last game for the club. But Ince says the claim was ''garbage.''
Ince revealed that the only time Ferguson asked him to stay was after
the Inter deal had been signed.
Independent Manchester United Supporters' Association spokesman
Richard Kurt said yesterday that Ince had been in touch with the group
and wanted to clear his name.''A lot of the problem here stems from
people relying on hearsay, not talking to each other properly, and
misunderstandings,'' said Kurt.

THE first time I fired a gun, it was great. I did it with a .22: I got
my Air Training Corps badge for that.
At Kippen Gun Club, I managed, some years back, six out of six, which
wasn't bad at all. That was years ago. Yesterday, I managed a mere eight
out of 10, which was awfy good.
Our photographer, Stuart Conway, did 10 out of 10, which is startling.
The reason for this is simple. Both he and me have used guns before
and the cause of our success is simply that not only can we both shoot,
but Stuart is a lot younger than me and has better eyseight. My eyesight
is enough to turn me into a French Impressionist on a misty day.
But we shot the wee bastards all the same. In the old days, we did not
call it ''breaking'' the clays. We called a hit with the light guns when
we hit, we called it ''killing'' the clays. We called it that, because
clays were substitutes for killing birds.
Very satisfying it is, killing clays, because they break into a
thousand shards, no' like birds who are deid, like. Clay-pigeon shooting
is very, very satisfying but youse wid be greetin' at the thought of a'
thae wee doos no' going back to their wives and weans of a night because
they hud been shot by chaps like myself enjoying the corporate
entertainment: it is not quite like that.
Let me start at the beginning.
Shooting might well start at the easy end of it, with firing at bits
of porcelain, but it ends with killing animals and so it should. We kill
-- countryfolk describe it as cull -- animals, some of them quite large.
I have described this before.
We cull deer. We have to do this for the sake of the animals. As the
beasts get older they don't do themselves any favours. Those of you who
have never seen an old stag starving -- the ribs falling out of it, for
heaven's sake -- won't know what a godsend it is for a marksman to put
it out of its misery. Shunned by the herd, and unable to eat, on its
last legs. It is a decency to put it into the heavens. Let it pursue the
herd up above in the stars.
Let me explain further. The weekend was about shooting guns, at
Moscow, near Galston, Ayrshire. My sports editor, Iain, had acres of fun
telling me that I was being sent to Ruissi. But I knew better: I knew it
was Moscow in Ayrshire, and glad, too, for it is a lovely journey and I
knew that the venue would be more than you need for a day oot. It wis.
Lesley Hair, an ex-Glasgow poliswoman, and Jay Steel, an international
clay shooter, own and run the Cowans Law Shooting School in Moscow. They
do a good deal. We had an introductory offer for 10 quid but this gets
more, largely run for corporate entertainment.
It comes reasonably, if you ask me. You get 50 clays to shoot, which
is a lot of birds and experts to instruct you (thank you, David, whom I
will not name by a surname), and a lunch which would knock you out. Just
try the home-made game soup with crusty bread. If you stick on the
Aberdeen fillet steaks, you will not be eating the week. The trifle at
the end would have you shooting yourself just to put you into another
heaven.
Jay and Lesley but recently set up this splendid farm; cost a fortune,
it must. Right in the middle of the nearest Ayrshire county, at Cowans
Law Shooting School, near Moscow, it can't be much more than a half-hour
from anywhere in Glasgow. They know what they are doing.
This will work. The introductory day was a mere tenner, though it has
obviously got to be more later, had more than 50 people turning up,
including a lot of young women who had read the ad in wur ain blatt.
I shot with a heavier 12-bore gun but, paradoxically, the larger the
bore, the heavier the recoil. The girls who turned up for a smashing day
out started to get a bit aggrieved because, quite sensibly for a first
try, they wurny allowed to use the heavier recoil gun. Mind you,
Gillian, who works in a lab, and Jackie and Caroline -- lovely ladies
all -- would know all about it, as I told them, if they were shooting
with the heavier gun. They wid huv shooders on them black and blue
enough fur Gavin Hastings efter speaking tae the a' Blecks. That's
enough Doric.
No it isnae. Forbye, it is hard for people to make a business in what
is after all a traditional sport. I spoke to a lot of people involved in
the business of field sports. Lesley, who spent 15 years as (then) the
only policewoman dog handler, and her partner in crime, if you like,
Jay, who opened up this magnificent centre for shoots in Ayrshire.
Both told me about country sports. Neither comes directly from the
country itsel. Neither did the four girls I met, who went out on their
first day getting instruction. They came from Kilmarnock. Nor did Doug
Ross, who is from Port Glasgow and he was the one who let me use his
splendid gun, made in Russia and costing a reasonable #150, less than a
golf club might, and who is determined to push field sports, because
field sports are part of the Scottish tradition, and he is the PR for
Scottish Field Sports.
More than that. Jay and Lesley have a lovely location and a set of
houses with gun-rooms and professionalism enough for anybody, and
corporate entertainment might make enough money to pay for it all.
You would be daft not to take advantage of the place yourself.
Instruction fae sonsie big lads and lassies, shooting all these clays,
free beautiful guns, and a damned good lunch?
This might sound like an ad feature but it isnae. See when you and
your chums want a day out, it is the very business for you. I can assure
you. It is the first weekend I never took a drink. By the way, The
Herald boys and girls have gone for it on August 7. Ah'm goin maself.

WESTERN UNION:
THERE were slaps on the back for both George Reifer and David Simpson
on Saturday evening. They were, though, more consolatory than
congratulatory for these centurions on a day when teams in the D M Hall
Western Union traded places, while Clydesdale maintained their
relentless drive towards the title.
Ayr, the title-holders, started the day second in the table, but by
the time it came their turn to bat at Hamilton Crescent against West of
Scotland it was going to take something special to maintain that
position.
An opening stand of 123 in 25 and a bit overs between Mark Harper and
Alastair Storie set West on their way.
Harper went for 77, but deposed Scotland captain Storie lasted the 50
overs, making 98 not out. Craig Wright's 39 in 29 balls was the icing on
the cake as the home side piled up 253 for three.
Ayr, though, rose to the task. They had 50 up after eight overs, and
at the halfway point in the reply, looked well placed on 115 for two.
But the Ayr counter-attack, led by Simpson, was put in check by Marks,
Townson, and Gilchrist. Simpson did complete his century, but with big
hits needed, and down to his last partner, the Ayr skipper hoisted the
third ball of the final over, delivered by Townson, to Intikhab Ahmed at
long-on.
West had won by 17 runs, Gilchrist finished with six for 81, and Ayr
ended up going down the league, passed on the way by Greenock, who were
involved in an equally exciting game with bottom club Uddingston at
Glenpark, the hosts only taking the win points with five balls to spare.
Reifer was listed at No.3 for the visitors, but was involved from the
fourth ball until the forty-ninth over, with the Uddingston pro making
good use of extended knock.
He celebrated his Scotland recall with a superb 117, including 14
boundries, off 151 balls. Support, though, was limited, No.9 Craig
Mullen being the best of the rest with 17 as Uddy were bowled out for
191.
On 73 for four after the seventy-eighth over, Greenock were making
heavy weather of the chase. That was until pro Mike Sears took a hand in
things. The Kiwi faced 69 deliveries, hitting eight 4s and a 6 in his 77
before being seventh man out.
From the last ball of the penultimate over, Roddy Neill hit Mark Watt
to the ropes to tie the scores. David Duthie took strike and nudged the
luckless Reifer for the winning single.
That result left Greenock trailing leaders Clydesdale, who rolled
Drumpellier over for just 82, then knocked off the runs for the loss of
two wickets.
Greig Williamson was the all-rounder in form with four wickets and 45
runs.
It took half the summer before they won a game. Now, Kilmarnock NK
can't kick the habit, doubling their win tally against Kelburne.
The Paisley outfit were given a decent foundation, Deon Kotze (39) and
Alan Gemmell (37) putting 73 on for the first wicket, but they still
only made it to 176 for eight as Asif Mutjaba and Imran Idress shared
the wickets.
It was that same pairing who combined for the match-winning
sixth-wicket stand of 88, Mujtaba unbeaten on 84 to add to his
four-wicket haul.
The only game which did not produce a verdict was at Meikleriggs,
where Poloc's bowlers could not finish off the Ferguslie batting.

TEA was taken early at Grange Loan on Saturday. Corstophine's innings
had lasted only 33 overs as Carlton's Richard Bannerman (five for 38)
and Robin Singh (four for 63) shot them out for 109.
Carlton and their supporters were comfortable over the refreshments
with the prospect of victory to come. This, after all, was the team
which just one week previously had started against Grange as the major
challengers to defending champions Heriot's.
The wheels came off then, and they were about to do so again on
Saturday in even more spectacular fashion. As the score barely crawled
into double figures, five wickets went.
Hugh Parker could only watch the mayhem at the other end, but at last
he found a measure of stability in David McLean.
The stubborn Parker was eventually dismissed after a two-and-a-half
hour stay for 33. That was at 80 for eight which then became 101 for
nine with two overs left.
McLeod was then beaten by the penultimate ball of the day and
Corstorphine pocketed the points, Mujtaba Butt claiming five for 37 and
Shahid Saeed three for 39.
All of this must be sweet music to the ears of Heriot's, who had
little difficulty in seeing off Falkland. Jim Love had a field day with
a half-century and five wickets.
Since Grange were unable to get the better of Royal High at Barnton,
that leaves Heriot's so far out in front in the Ryden East League that
only a mathematical pedant would concede the possibility of the title
going elsewhere.
High insured themselves against defeat by posting their best ever
league score, 284 for five, off 51 overs.
A terrific partnership of 192 in little over two hours between Manzoor
Elahi (107) and Bob Thornton (86) provided the bulk of the runs.
Grange had Neil Mountjoy to thank for the draw as he survived 90 balls
for his unbeaten 26 as Grange closed at 146 for eight, Philip Doggart
taking five for 46.
Freuchie returned to winning ways with victory over Watsonians, Colin
Hepplewhite and John Pollard both grabbing five wickets, and Edinburgh
Accies collected valuable points at The Tryst, gaining the better of the
draw with Stenhousemuir.

LAST month, after their defeat in the first Test at Headingley,
England's cricket supremo, Raymond Illingworth, was quick to point out
that the dividing line between success and failure was very thin.
He must now be thinking how big the gap is between euphoria and
despair. The jubilation displayed by England after a rare victory at
Lord's in the second Test was justifiable only in that it levelled the
series at one Test each.
It certainly was no indication that England's cricket was on the mend.
The humiliating innings-and-64-run defeat on Saturday at Edgbaston took
England straight back into the doldrums.
So was the 72-run win in the second Test a flash in the pan? The
indications are that it was. To prove otherwise, England needed to put
up a far more convincing performance to build on their victory.
After Lord's, Mike Atherton was immediately confirmed as England's
captain for the remainder of the series, an appointment which originally
had been only for the first three Tests.
Illingworth, who has made no secret of the fact that he wants to run
England's cricket entirely his way, must have been convinced that his
selection formula had worked and that things had come right at last.
After all, it was England's first victory over West Indies at Lord's in
nearly 40 years.
He should, however, have taken note that, apart from Dominic Cork's
remarkable bowling in the second innings and Robin Smith's timely return
to form, there had been no extraordinary feats. That dividing line
between success and failure that he had mentioned was, indeed, very
thin. Certainly England had not got the measure of this West Indies
side, as he would have had you believe.
This time, at Edgbaston, England had to cope with the devil in the
pitch. Having looked at the wicket and the cloudy conditions, it was
surprising that Atherton chose to bat first.
Admittedly, this was not a suitable wicket for Test cricket. The
intention was to prepare a wicket which was tailor-made for England. Ray
Illingworth himself had ''ordered'' it, but it did not turn out as he
intended.
Choosing his words carefully, England's captain Mike Atherton said
after the match that the England ''management'' (he did not say not
''we'') had asked for the wicket to be prepared according to their
requirement.
As it happened, the pitch proved to be far more suitable to the West
Indian bowlers.
The fact that it was shaven at both ends, to help spin, was irrelevant
as the spinners hardly got to work on it. And with the amount of grass
left in the middle, England's team selection should have been more
appropriate.
The inclusion of Devon Malcolm -- notwithstanding the now notorious
article on a racial issue, in this month's Wisden Cricket Monthly --
would have given England a chance to exploit the uneven bounce in the
manner the West Indians did. A suggestion along these lines was made to
Illingworth by Warwickshire when he went to look at the wicket last
week, but his mind and influence over team selections remains firm.
Blame the pitch to a great extent, yes, but there is little excuse for
bad strokes. The West Indies did make 300 and apart from Campbell's
excellent effort, their captain Richie Richardson showed England, during
his four hours at the crease, that concentration is vital in difficult
circumstances.

SCOTLAND'S Colin McRae scorched to a convincing victory in the first
round of the Asia-Pacific Rally Championship yesterday.
McRae and co-driver Derek Ringer finished the Rally of Indonesia more
than two minutes clear of the field, despite a furious final-day charge
by Sweden's Kenneth Eriksson in a Mitsubishi Lancer.
Finland's Tommi Makinen was third, also in a Lancer.
It was an impressive win for McRae in this, his first attempt at the
event -- particularly against the experienced Swede, who won last year.
McRae started the third day with his Subaru Impreza 555 out in front
by some two-and-a-half minutes, only to see Eriksson claw back an
incredible 42 seconds in the four timed stages of the morning session.
But showing a cool-headed display of driving, the 27-year-old refused
to be intimidated by the Swede's challenge. In fact, he let him close
the gap still further during the first two stages after lunch.
His plan worked. Eriksson saw his hopes of catching McRae evaporate in
the stifling heat, with temperatures soaring to more than 100[DEG]. The
Swede pushed his car too hard and mechanical problems lost him more than
30 seconds just three stages from the end.
Afterwards, a delighted McRae said: ''Kenneth hates being beaten, so I
knew he'd come out fighting. But I had a comfortable lead by the end of
day two and could let him close the gap while I concentrated on getting
the car to the finish line unscathed.''
McCrae's Subaru team-mate and defending Asia-Pacific champion, Possum
Bourne, led until a heavy landing in stage five bent his front
suspension. He recovered to finish fourth.
The Scot can now concentrate his efforts in preparing for the next
round of the championship in Auckland, New Zealand, from July 27 to 30.
Results:
Rally of Indonesia, 1995 Asia-Pacific Championship round 1 -- 1, C
McCrae/D Ringer, Subaru Impreza 4hr 53min 05sec; 2, K Eriksson/S
Parmander (S), Mitsubishi Lancer, 4-55-19; 3, T Makinen/S Harjanne,

THE thistle stood proudly in Belgium yesterday as Scotland romped to
victory in the final of the nineteenth European Amateur Team
championship, thrashing England 6-1 in the scorching heat of Royal
Antwerp.
This was the fourth time Scotland have been crowned kings of Europe,
but it proved by far the sweetest of successes for it helped to ease the
pain of four previous final defeats at the hands of England.
Without question, Colin Dalgleish's team were the star attractions of
the week in the picturesque Belgian city.
From romping home to lead the strokeplay qualifying to battling hard
against Wales and France and then thumping England, the Scots were
simply superb.
Jubilant captain Dalgleish said: ''From the start we proved we were
the best team here and then we had to carry the mantle of tournament
favourites right through the matchplay stages, which we did superbly.
''But it is difficult not to do well with six such great players, and
six who get on so well and pull so much for each other. Every single one
was superb and they deserve all the praise going.''
After the morning foursomes were taken 2-0, the Scots needed only two
singles points for victory, and the first was provided by veteran
Barclay Howard, who hit Gary Wolstenholme with a barrage of birdies to
win 4 and 3.
Gordon Sherry then beat English champion Mark Foster on the last green
to emerge with six points out of six for the tournament.
But everyone was a hero. Alan Reid beat former Amateur champion Lee
James by a hole and Stephen Gallacher and Graham Rankin battled hard to
square their ties. Results:
Final: Scotland 6, England 1. Foursomes -- S Gallacher and G Sherry
beat L James and C Edwards, 4 and 3; B Howard and G Rankin beat G Harris
and D Howell, 3 and 1. Singles -- Sherry beat M Foster, 1 hole;
Gallacher halved with Howell; A Reid beat James, 1 hole; Rankin halved
with Harris; Howard beat G Wolstenholme, 4 and 3.
Third-place play-off -- Sweden 4[1/2], France 2[1/2]. Fifth/sixth --
Ireland 5, Norway 2. Seventh/eighth -- Wales 4, Belgium 3. Ninth/tenth
-- Spain 4, Italy 1. 11/12 -- Denmark 3, Netherlands 2. 13/14 -- Austria
4, Finland 1. 15/16 -- Germany 3, Switzerland 2. 17 -- Portugal. 18 --
Iceland. 19 -- Czech Republic. 20 -- Estonia.

A MAJESTIC No.3-wood, struck all of 243 yards to within 12ft of the
pin at the second extra play-off hole, the seventeenth, set up
Scotland's Sam Torrance for an emotional win in the Murphy's Irish Open
golf tournament at Mount Juliet yesterday. ''I won this title in 1981 at
Portmarnock and it means something special to me.
''That win was the key to my first Ryder Cup appearance and this one
will provide entry to my eighth. I rate it the finest of my career.''
But it certainly was not easy. After Sam had hit his second shot,
Englshman Howard Clark made the edge of the green from behind a tree. He
chipped poorly, but then sank an 18ft putt.
''My heart sank when I saw that go in,'' admitted Torrance. But the
Scot stepped up with his trusty broom-handle, and holed out for the
eagle.
In the three-man play-off, the first to go was 21-year-old Stuart
Cage, in only his second year as a professional. The former Walker Cup
player from Leeds had given a composed performance to record a final
round of 69. At the first extra hole, he hit his second into the water.
Stuart will come again.
Torrance might have finished it at the final hole, where he needed a
par to pip Clark and Cage. His No.7-iron shot caught on the bank of a
greenside bunker and Sam took three more to get down.
His 71 had contained four birdies and three bogeys, but he kept his
cool better than most.
''My father Bob was down to see me last week, and we went to the
practice ground. He suggested a small swing change. I can tell him now
it works. I am looking forward to the Scottish Open at Carnoustie this
week.''
A distraught Colin Montgomerie carded a final 73, for a share of
fourth place, and wailed: ''That's another one I have thrown away. It is
my own fault.''
Montgomerie and Greg Norman set off with a huge army marching with
them for what was supposed be the battle of the Titans in the blazing
sun. The opening salvo came from Monty, who blasted his drive 20 yards
past the world's No.1, wedged on, and holed a 5ft putt.
Norman could manage only a par and fell further behind when he
bunkered his tee-shot at the second. The Scot made par at the second,
and the third, before suffering a devasting blow at the next hole.
His drive went straight into the woods, never to be seen again, and
with three putts from the fringe he had run up a 7. Cameras in the crowd
raised Monty's ire but, at this point, a passing midgie might have
strained his temper.
All credit to the man, however. He bounced back with two successive
birdies at No.6 and No.7. The Great White Shark, meanwhile, was playing
like a toothless tuna as he ran up three bogeys on the front nine.
Monty surged clear with another birdie at the tenth and was then
leading the tournament. Alas, three putts at the fifteenth and a 6 at
No.17 -- where he tried, and failed, to play under a tree -- sank his
chances.
Norman recovered partially and finished one shot behind Montgomerie.
At one stage, Bernhard Langer, last year's winner, took his score to
11 under, out in only 31 shots. He then put one ball in the water and
another up a tree -- where it stayed -- and it was time to make his
exit. Leading scores (GB and Ireland unless stated):

FORMER US amateur champion Billy Mayfair emerged from the pack to win
the $2m Western Open with a birdie at the final hole in Chicago,
Illinois, yesterday.
Mayfair sank a four-foot putt to break out of a logjam and clinch a
one-stroke victory after a faultless five-under-par 67 on the Cog Hill
course. He finished at nine-under 279, while fellow Americans Jeff
Maggert (64), Justin Leonard (67), Scott Simpson (68) and Jay Haas (70)
tied for second on 280.
After having lost a play-off to Vijay Singh at the Phoenix Open in
January, Mayfair endured a mini-slump before emerging from it in style
yesterday. Despite his victory, Mayfair is not exempt into next week's
Open championship, and will not attempt to pre-qualify.
Australian Brett Ogle opened the door for Mayfair with a late
collapse. He led with six holes remaining but, after having bogeyed the
thirteenth and fourteenth holes, he made a triple bogey at the par-five
fifteenth, where he pushed his drive into a clump of bushes and took two
more swings to extricate himself from the trouble.
Ogle parred the remaining three holes to shoot two-over 74 and tie for
thirteenth place, four strokes behind Mayfair.
Five-times Open champion Tom Watson, with a 71, and defending Open
champion Nick Price, with a 69 also tied for thirteenth place in their
final event before St Andrews next week.
While Price and Watson will have this week off, Ogle will play the
Scottish Open at Carnoustie and, unless he earns a late exemption into
the Open, will have to pre-qualify. Ogle was not the only player to open
the door for Mayfair. John Huston also was a dejected figure after
briefly having taken the lead, only to four-putt the sixteenth for a
double bogey. Leading final scores (US unless stated):
279 -- Billy Mayfair 73, 70, 69, 67.
280 -- Jeff Maggert 74, 73, 69, 64; Justin Leonard 70, 71, 72, 67;
Scott Simpson 71, 72, 69, 68; Jay Haas 69, 68, 73, 70.
281 -- John Huston 73, 68, 72, 68; Bob Tway 76, 69, 68, 68; Bob Estes
72, 73, 66, 70; Steve Lowery 69, 70, 70, 72.
282 -- Scott Gump 74, 70, 72, 66; Woody Austin 74, 70, 69, 69; Scott
Hoch 73, 69, 70, 70.
Other scores: 283 -- Nick Price (Zimbabwe) 75, 71, 68, 69; Tom Watson
68, 71, 73, 71; Brett Ogle (Australia) 69, 71, 69, 74; 285 -- Mark

KATHRYN Marshall, the 28-year-old from Dalmahoy, earned Scotland their
first LPGA title in the United States when she shot a closing round of
67 to win the Jamie Farr Toledo Classic at Highland Meadows, Sylvania,
in Ohio yesterday.
It was Marshall's first victory as a professional and the fourth by a
European on the LPGA Tour this year. An eight under par aggregate of 205
earned Marshall a $75,000 winner's cheque when she finished one stroke
ahead of American Sherri Steinhauer, with Scottish rival Pam Wright one
stroke further behind.
''It's my parents 40th anniversary today and they will be thrilled.
They told me last night that this was my big chance and it's so good to
win in America. My previous best was third place in the British Open two
years ago.''
Marshall started the final round one stroke behind Wright but played
faultless golf and never exceeded par to earn her first title. Leading
scores:
205 -- K Marshall 67, 71, 67.
206 -- S Steinhauer 69, 70, 67.
207 -- P Wright 71, 66, 70.
208 -- P Bradley 71, 70, 67; K Robbins 69, 71, 68; D Richard 72, 67,
69; B Daniel 71, 68, 69; B King 68, 71, 69; B Burton 68, 71, 69.

A WINTER in the deserts of Dubai transformed Halling from humble
handicapper to Group 1 superstar as the colt made a stunning return to
Britain to capture the Coral Eclipse Stakes at Sandown on Saturday.
Last seen here running away with the Cambridgeshire in October, the
four-year-old took the leap in class in his stride to gain a
pillar-to-post success.
His neck victory over Singspiel, with stablemate Red Bishop three
lengths back in third, took the earnings of the phenomenally successful
Godolphin operation in Britain through the #1m barrier from just six
wins this year.
For jockey Walter Swinburn, winner last year on Ezzoud, the race was a
tactical triumph.
With no proven front-runner in the line-up, he found a willing servant
in Halling, who answered his every question, and ran on gamely even
after the jockey lost his whip a furlong out.
''I hit the rail with it and, with a combination of sweaty hands and
the excitement, I threw it away,'' he said.
''Luckily, I didn't need it. If I had the whip I might have won by a
length, but he is a pretty tough horse to get by.''
Halling will now be aimed at the Juddmonte International at York with
the recently launched Dubai World Cup, back on home territory, his
ultimate goal next year.
Environment Friend, the 1991 winner who now operates as a stallion
when not racing, finished a tremendous fourth on his fourth appearance
in the race.
But the contest ended in pain for Muhtarram, who broke down half a
furlong out and was eased down to finish sixth.

SUNDAY racing comes to Scotland next weekend with a much-publicised
meeting at Ayr offering not only competitive racing but entertainment
and sideshows aimed mainly at young families and non-racegoers, writes
Tom McConnell.
The meeting, on the first weekend of the Glasgow Fair holiday, will
undoubtedly attract a large crowd, but will they bet?
On the evidence of 10 Sunday meetings held so far, the turnout has
been excellent -- apart from Epsom when it poured -- but the betting
turnover was extremely poor.
In addition, many betting shops, especially in the cities, have been
deserted and the big firms already are considering not opening.
Scottish bookmakers are hoping the West of Scotland crowd will buck
this trend and splash out their holiday money on a flutter on the
horses.
The 60-odd bookmakers who occupy the pitches at Ayr are keen for
Sunday racing to succeed and are assisting the Ayr executive to meet the
cost of the family entertainment -- and will also provide an incentive
for the punters.
At some time during the first two races, each bookmaker will hand out
one free bet -- 10 will be for #100 and the remainder for #5 -- on the
back of one of his tickets.
Norman Miller, chairman of the Scottish Bookmakers' Protection
Association, explained: ''Only those who bet on the first two races will
have a chance of winning a free bet.
''We have introduced this move because we are concerned Sunday racing
is attracting paw, maw, and the weans, but no punters.''
A similar scheme, but with #5 bets only, will operate at Hamilton Park
on Fair Friday.
Mark Kershaw, general manager of Ayr, is unrepentent about using
Disney characters, a bouncy castle, and Punch and Judy as ''carrots'' in
his special customer-friendly race-day.
Pointing out that the card includes the Tennent Trophy Rated Stakes
with added prize money of #12,750 and two maiden races valued at more
than #6000, he maintained: ''We are providing a fun day out for the
family but not sacrificing the quality of racing.''
When asked about the lack of big punters at Sunday meetings, he said:
''Betting is just part of the whole day. What we are talking about is
encouraging people, many of them children, to come racing. That is the
future.''
A recent survey by the British Horseracing Board showed 38% of Sunday
racegoers had never been before or had not been for six months, 25% took
children, and 40% were women.
* THE Godolphin-owned two-year-old, Phantom Creek, trained by Saeed
Bin Suroor, has been supported from 40-1 into 20-1 with William Hill for
next year's 1000 Guineas. Coral give her a 25-1 quote.

MISS Pigalle, who sprang a pleasant surprise for Cree Lodge trainer
Linda Perratt last Tuesday when she won at the twenty-sixth time of
asking, returns to Edinburgh today hoping to add to that success.
If jockeys are good judges, she should triumph again. As he
dismounted, Dale Gibson said she would get a longer distance, and,
presumably on that recommendation, Miss Pigalle will tackle the Mill
Hill Handicap over an extended mile, a furlong more than last week's
distance.
At The Savy, last week's beaten favourite, is also in the race, 4lb
better off and partnered by Lindsay Charnock in place of Jimmy Fortune.
Also worthy of consideration is My Handy Man, second to Three Arch
Bridge at Hamilton Park on Friday, and Spanish Verdict, beaten a short
head by Master Of The House at Carlisle on Wednesday.
Diet, from the same stable, never seems to tire of racing. Runner-up
to Profit Release at Hamilton on Friday, his third consecutive second
place, the nine-year-old sprinter turns out again today for the Dunbar
Claiming Stakes, but could be touched off by Annie Fay, a winner at
Carlisle on Thursday.
Jackmanii, who gave Tom Kemp his third winner of the season last
Monday in a limited stakes race, drops in class to contest the Newbattle
Selling Handicap. Despite top weight of 9st 13lb, he should win under
Kieran Fallon.
A promising prospect as a juvenile hurdler later in the year, it begs
the question: why chance losing him in a seller?
Soba Up is becoming as familiar a site at the Musselburgh track as the
starting stalls.
The Edinburgh Gold Cup victor runs in the George Boyd Fillies
Handicap, her fourth appearance here in three weeks.
She failed to complete a four-timer last Tuesday, when beaten by North
Ardarbut, but unless she has gone over the top should make amends today.
Missus Murhill, a short-head winner over the track last month, could
be the only threat.
Pallium, successful in an amateur riders' race over course and
distance on Tuesday, returns for Le Garcon D'Or Handicap and should come
through although he has top weight.
* LAKE Coniston and So Factual, level on points in their encounters so
far this season, renew rivalry for round three in what promises to be a
thrilling Group 1 July Cup at Newmarket on Thursday.
Godolphin's So Factual took revenge over the Geoff Lewis-trained
sprinter when they met in the Cork &amp; Orrery Stakes at Royal Ascot last
month, receiving 4lb and prevailing by a head.
But Lake Coniston had previously routed So Factual when flying home
three lengths clear in the Duke of York Stakes at York.
The bookmakers have sided with the York form over Ascot and installed
the four-year-old as 9-4 favourite with So Factual a best-priced 5-1.

SAILING
BELFAST Lough yesterday proved a different, taxing arena for the 26
top Clyde boats who were competing on the first day of Bangor Week, but
there were victories for Angus Spence's First Class 8, The Black Pig, in
the Sportboat class and John Corson's Rover Series Trophy winning Moody
336, Crusader II.
With 113 boats racing in 10 classes, entries are up on 1993 from
Scotland and England, and all classes were sent on a figure-4 course,
which opened in a pleasant south-easterly breeze.
On each consecutive circuit, the wind shifted to favour the opposite
wing of the course from the previous round, so fortune favoured the
hopeful gamblers, or those who simply settled for modest gains to be
collected up the middle of the course. As temperatures rose, the wind
dropped, making a slow and frustrating finish.
In Class 0, 1994 Rover Series winner Alex Duffus' Sigma 400, from
Inverkip, had to settle for third place behind the well-sailed and
locally based one-tonner Sidewinder, owned by David Best, while the
Tay's Chris Bonar, in Bateleur '93, took fourth after getting on the
wrong side of a wind shift on the second circuit, having lain second on
the first round.
Splitting their talents between two boats, this year's Rover
Trophy-winning helm John Highcock is sailing on John Corson's J35
Salamander and contributed significantly to their second. Crusader II,
owned by Corson's policeman son John, took a very comfortable first
place in Class 4, while Salamander XII tailed the identical J35 Jumpin
Jack Flash 100 yards behind in second place at the finish.
In the third round of the Vauxhall Ultra 30 Grand Prix, sailed on
Queen Mary Reservoir in Middlesex, Scottish gold medallist Mike McIntyre
steered Orbitel to fourth place in the event, which marked Lawrie
Smith's first overall victory this season in Frontera.

ATHLETICS ROUND-UP
THE former national 1500 metres champion, Glen Stewart, eased to a
comfortable win yesterday in the Harry Bennett Memorial mile at Caird
Park.
But hopes of Dundee's first sub-four-minute mile disappeared on a
stiff easterly breeze which accounted for the modest winning time of
4min 11.1sec.
Stewart struck for home with 300m to go, opening a gap over UK
internationalist Ian Campbell (Dundee Hawkhill, 4-12.4), with
Kilbarchan's Robert Quinn third in 4-13.1.
* KENYA'S Christopher Kelong edged out Britain's World Championship
marathon hope, Richard Nerurkar, in a sprint finish to the five-mile
BUPA Great London Run.
The women's title went to American-born Suzanne Rigg of Warrington,
with Edinburgh's Karen Macleod, who runs the marathon at the world event
in Gothenburg, third. Results:
Men: 1, C Kelong (Kenya) 22min 41sec; 2, R Nerurkar (Bingley) 22-42;
3, J Solly (Hearne Hill) 23-12.Women: 1, S Rigg (Warrington) 26-49; 2, A
Hulley (Leeds) 26-55; 3, K McLeod (Edinburgh) 27-05.
* COLIN Jackson rediscovered his best form at yesterday's Welsh Games,
but threatened to pull out of next month's World championship. The 110m
hurdles world record holder, troubled by tonsillitis for most of the
season, clocked 13.17sec.
But the 28-year-old Welshman -- he has only won twice outdoors this
year -- is awaiting the results of blood tests and said: ''I have four
or five races planned against some serious competition in the next
couple of weeks. However, I've lost a lot of training time since coming
back from Florida.
''I'll make a decision on the World championships when I go down to
Monte Carlo for my final training camp. If I'm not happy with everything
there, then I might not defend my title.''
* ELEVEN high jumpers cleared 2.30 metres or better yesterday in
Eberstadt. The contest was won by world record holder, Javier Sotomayor,
who cleared 2.37m, the same height as runner-up Troy Kemp. Britain's
Dalton Grant was third, clearing a season's best of 2.35.
* GEORGE Martin (Glenbervie), won both 28lb weight-for-distance and
caber, outclassing his rivals at Alva. He totalled 26[1/2] points to
defeat Steve Aitken (Taynuilt, 18[1/2]). Eric Irvine (Gorebridge) and
Colin Anderson (Aberdeen) were third equal.
* DOUBLE Scottish veteran throws champion Bill Gentleman (Edinburgh
AC) recorded three wins in the North East Veterans' championship at
Jarrow. He set championship records in discus (38.04m) and hammer
(47.48m), and had a season's best in the shot (10.26m).
* WELSHMEN dominated the Jedforest Sprint at Riverside Park. Kevin
Williams, off a handicap of half a metre, won the #1500 prize in the
110m in a blanket finish, defeating compatriot Doug Turner (2m) with
former New Year sprint winner Eric Smart (Wallsend, 7[1/2]m) third.
Keith Lyall (ESH) won the 1600m and David Cunningham (Rochdale,
scratch) won the 3200m in 8min 31.0sec from Terry Mitchell (Fife).
* CHRIS Carson was the only record breaker in the Scottish TSB
age-group championships held over two days at Pitreavie.
The 15-year-old Fife athletes took more than half-a-second from the
Scottish under-17 400 metres record with his winning run of 48.79sec,
improving his own personal best by a startling two seconds.
He also showed his sprinting speed when finishing runner-up in 10.99
behind 100m winner Tom Begen (Shettleston, 10.88).
Ross Baillie (Victoria Park) best known as a hurdler, aiming for
European junior championship selection at next week's AAA championships,
concentrated on sprinting and recorded a splendid double, taking the
100m and 200m in 10.78 and 21.81 respectively.
Gillian Hegney won the under-20 100m, clocking a personal best of
11.87 to head the season's rankings.
The improving level of Scottish long jumping was confirmed when David
Clerihew reached 7.11m, while Aberdeen's Willie Stark also bettered the
seven metres barrier as runner-up, with 7.07m, before winning the triple
jump with 14.06m.
David Love (Stewartry) was the outstanding competitor of the under-13
and under-15 events yesterday, setting championship bests in the
under-13 100m and 200m (12.50/26.1).

SPONSORS Ladbrokes have installed Belfry Green as their favourite for
the seven furlong, #30,000-added Bunbury Cup at Newmarket on Thursday.
Con Horgan's five-year-old gelding was an unlucky seventh in the race
last year when under five lengths behind the winner En Attendant, having
been almost brought down inside the final furlong.
Despite the fact that he has risen 11lb in the weights since the race
last year, he signalled an imminent return to top form last time in the
Wokingham Handicap at Royal Ascot.
Over an inadequate trip of six furlongs, Belfry Green failed to get a
clear run a furlong out, but really flew in the closing stages to be
around eight lengths down at the finish. Latest betting:
7-1 Belfry Green, 8-1 Madly Sharp, Elfland, 9-1 Celestial Key, 10-1
Classic Sky, 12-1 En Attendant 14-1 bar.

ITALIAN superstar Roberto Baggio, who became the world's most
expensive footballer last week when he moved from Juventus to AC Milan
for almost #13m, yesterday fired back at critics of his love of hunting,
shooting, and fishing.
A devout Buddhist, he said his branch of the religion had nothing
against such activities. ''There are many branches of Buddhism and the
one I have converted to has no such limitations. Instead it has deep and
important ends,'' he said.
The World Cup midfielder earlier went fishing on the lagoon near the
north-eastern resort of Grado, where he is on holiday with his family.
Last month, bombarded by speculation about his future, he went on a
duck-shooting holiday in Argentina.
Nicknamed the ''Divine Pigtail'', he announced he had converted to
Buddhism -- a religion often associated with strict vegetarianism --
while at Fiorentina in 1988.
In 1993, Baggio devoted his European Footballer of the Year award to
Daisaku Ikeda, the leader of the Japanese lay Buddhist organisation Soka
Gakkai, which he follows.
In the meantime, David Platt, the #4.7m-rated England skipper, will
decide next week whether to return home or extend his contract with
Sampdoria for a further three years.
The 29-year-old midfielder, who began his Serie A career in 1991 with
a #5.5m deal from Aston Villa to Bari, says he has spoken to three
clubs, but refused to name them.
Inter Milan, Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United, Blackburn, and
Everton have all been linked with him in recent weeks.

JACK Berry has decided against suspending operations after seeing an
upturn in his horses' fortunes.
The trainer seriously considered the possibility of shutting down his
Cockerham yard last week but registered his second winner in 28 starts
when Red Simba won at Wolverhampton on Saturday night.
A similarly bad run of 45 losers was halted by a solitary win at
Carlisle on the last day of June but the latest signs have encouraged
Berry.
''I would have been prepared to shut down if things didn't improve but
a few have started to run a little better now,'' he said.
''We have been picking and choosing the ones to run when they seem
right. It doesn't seem to be affecting any particular age group but we
just can't find out what is the problem.
''It has been very hot and humid here and possibly the air quality
isn't the greatest, but we have scrubbed the yard from top to bottom --
it's so clean you could eat your dinner off it.''
The wet spring caused problems for Berry and the present fine weather
has created different but equally awkward conditions on which to train.
''It's gone from heavy to concrete just like that. Our horses work on
the moss at home and when they get to the track, they are just not
performing,'' observed Berry.
Berry will not be represented at Newmarket's three day meeting later
this week.
''We are just running them in ones as and when, so we will give
Newmarket a miss,'' he added.

* ALASTAIR Forsyth of Ralston was denied his second victory in as many
days at in the Elderslie Trophy at Elderslie yesterday by former
Scotland internationalist Craig Watson of East Renfrewshire.
Watson was the only player under par and won by five shots after two
rounds of 68. Former winners Murdo Carmichael of Greenock and George
Crawford of Williamwood were also a few shots off the pace. Leading
scores:
136 -- C Watson (East Renfrewshire) 68, 68. 141 -- A Forsyth (Ralston)
70, 71; F Jardine (Dumbarton) 69, 72; M Carmichael (Greenock) 68, 73.
142 -- G Lawrie (Cowglen) 75, 67; G Crawford (Williamwood) 72, 70.
* GRAHAM Marsh shot a tournament record eight-under-par 63 in the
Kroger Senior Classic at Mason, Ohio, and Isao Aoki had a second
straight 66. But neither could overtake leader Mike Hill, who takes a
two-stroke advantage into the final round.
Hill shot a 66 for 130, 12 under par, two strokes ahead of Aoki and
three in front of Marsh.
''I'd rather be two strokes up than two strokes down,'' said Hill.
''But it will take another 66 to win it. I hope I hit 15 or 16 greens to
make sure that they're going to have to beat a good score.''
Scotland's Brian Barnes was round in 66, but is eight strokes behind
the leader, while Tony Jacklin added a 70 to his opening 69 for 139.

THE leafy entrance and normally peaceful surroundings disguise a
growing problem of crime and vandalism. Though an on-going programme of
repairs to damaged headstones has raised hopes that it will be restored
to its original condition, Cathcart Cemetery in Glasgow is a conspicuous
example of the many burial grounds around the country that are being
plagued by a new wave of churchyard crime.
After talks with the Scottish Crime Prevention Council, the Scottish
Office has even produced a booklet giving advice to congregations on
ways to reduce church break-ins and vandal attacks on cemeteries. And
Lord Fraser of Carmyllie gave voice to many people's feelings when he
said it was sad that such crime prevention measures were necessary and
that places of worship were no longer sacrosanct.
The measures recommended by the Scottish Office include locking
churchyards and using anti-climb paint to discourage break-ins. And it
suggests that visiting graveyards in the evenings or school holidays,
when vandalism is most likely to occur, will cut down on attacks.
Mr Jeff Hawkins, Eastwood deputy chief executive, admits there is a
problem at Cathcart -- famous as the resting place for notable names
such as Madge Jefferson, Stan Laurel's mother, and Robert McColl,
Scottish international footballer and founder of the R S McColl
confectionery chain -- particularly with headstones being knocked over.
But the council is doing everything in its power the remedy the problem,
he says.
A total of #10,000 a year has been put aside to carry out a phased
programme of re-erecting headstones, despite the fact that such
responsibility rightfully lies with lair-holders. Building contractors
have re-erected hundreds of gravestones in the last two years, while the
council has cleared and re-seeded messy areas and attempted to remove
some of the worst graffiti.
''The cemetery is sometimes used by people for unsocial behaviour and
we are in regular contact with the police about that,'' says Mr Hawkins.
''But there is only so many many hours they can devote to patrolling the
area when they have other pressing problems.''
He claims the Scottish Office advice is largely meaningless. Cathcart
Cemetery covers a huge area and it would be impossible to patrol or
secure it completely against anyone determined to get in. The gates are
left open on the instructions of police who need easy access. It would
take massive resources -- private security patrols, for instance -- to
seriously tackle graveyard crime.
''We are doing what we can with limited resources,'' adds Mr Hawkins.
''It is not to my satisfaction yet, but we are trying to address the
problem.''
Meanwhile, Cathcart Cemetery continues to suffer. The graves of
well-known Glaswegians are among those blighted at the hands of vandals.
A Stonehenge-style memorial to quarrymaster and ship-owner Mr Archibald
Robertson was deliberately pushed over, despite its height (15ft) and
weight (50 tonnes). The headstone of Sir John Mactaggart, co-founder of
the original Mactaggart and Mickel builing firm responsible for many of
the city's suburbs, has also been vandalised with spray paint. Gang
slogans have been daubed on the grave of Mr Robert Pollock, one of the
founder's of the Victoria Infirmary.
Many more industrialists, merchants and senior churchmen are buried in
the sprawling cemetery of around 1200 lairs. Local historian Mr John
Hedley is critical of their condition and has launched a one-man
campaign to restore the site.
He claims the graveyard is currently visited by drug-users and
prostitutes, and he has found fascist graffiti and vandalised
gravestones. He fears that racists have concentrated attacks on the
Jewish area of the cemetery, and he is in no doubt that Eastwood
District Council could do more to improve the cemetery.
''It has got gradually worse in the last two years and I think that is
because it has been neglected by the local council,'' he says. ''I have
been in touch with them and some MPs but not enough has been done. Some
parts are an absolute jungle, with overgrown trees, bushes and
pot-holes. I have also found piles of wine bottles, hypodermic syringes
and beer cans scattered all over the place.''
He has taken dozens of photographs, some of which show fallen
headstones and painted graffiti, and launched a letter-writing campaign
urging improvements.
''The thing that concerns me most is the anti-semitism,'' he says.
''Abusive language has been daubed on headstones and fascist remarks as
well.''
Also coming in for criticism from Mr Hedley is the ''dilapidated''
cemetery lodge, once a listed building. The latest vandal attack at the
cemetery was at the Jewish burial ground last month when a number of
gravestones were toppled. Earlier this year, a fire was started at a
building used as a gathering place at the Hebrew cemetery.
Jewish community leaders are quick to dismiss fears of serious
anti-semitic attacks though they say there have been isolated examples
of fascist graffiti. Mr Henry Tankel, chairman of Queen's Park
Synangogue -- responsible for the Cathcart Jewish cemetery -- says:
''Cemeteries are totally unprotected areas and there is not a lot that
can be done about vandalism. It is an on-going problem but Cathcart is
probably no different from anywhere else.''
There are plans to erect a fence round the area and encourage people
to put down flat headstones which cannot be toppled, he says.
Eastwood MP Mr Allan Stewart has taken up the Mr Hedley's case. He
says: ''If what he is saying is true then it is a very serious matter. I
have written to Eastwood District Council passing on his complaints and
inquiring what the current position is -- I am currently awaiting their
reply.''
But Mr Hedley is not satisfied with the excuses and promises of
council officials and politicians. He wants tough, co-ordinated action.
''Employing more gardeners to tidy the place up would be a good start to
sorting the place out. Their presence would discourage vandals during
the day. The police could make a concerted effort to catch these people.
I have never seen a policeman during my many visits to Cathcart
Cemetery. But if they made several arrests, that would soon discourage
the others.''

SCOTTISH CUP
THE semi-finals of the Whyte and Mackay Scottish Cup will be a Western
Union preserve following yesterday's final day of section games. The
teams going into the draw are Poloc, West of Scotland, Drumpellier, and
Ayr.
Ayr topped Section 4 with a controversial win at Aberdeenshire.
Struggling, with eight wickets down, to match the home side's 100 all
out, David Johnstone, without a helmet, was hit on the head attempting
to hook a ball from Mike Smith and fell on his wicket. He had to leave
the field but was given not out, so when the ninth wicket went down on
77, he returned to partner Derek Pettigrew to the win, and ended up four
not out.
Earlier, Ayr pro Adrian Holdstock had bowled well to take five scalps.
Only opener Mike Smith (20) and Graham Bone (26), at No.5, got runs for
the north men.
West of Scotland defeated Berwick at home by nine wickets to maintain
their 100% record in Section 2.
The Borderers were dismissed for 94 in their thirty-fifth over. Alan
Croser shared second and third-wicket stands of 25 and 27 with Ian
Thomson and Lee Mark, but from 55-3 it was downhill, with three wickets
falling on 74.
Three West bowlers bagged three wickets, with spinner Mark Townson
clean-bowling tail-enders for the best figures of 3-5. With Alistair
Storie unavailable, young Intikab Ahmed joined pro Mark Harper. When he
went at 41, another youngster, David Gilmour, came in. Harper won the
game in West's twenty-third over with his eleventh 4 in his unbeaten 57.
Poloc got a good start against holders Forfarshire before sinking to
74-5. However, aided by Brian Spence and David Hindmarsh they totalled
168.
Needing a quick win to improve their run rate, Forfarshire yielded to
the pressure, with Ronnie McGregor taking three wickets in his second
spell, and Brian Spence holding a good catch for the final wicket.
Section 3 ended in a tie between Drumpellier and Kelso, who
respectively defeated West Lothian and Dundee HS FP. However, Drumps
improved on their already better run rate and thus go through, so Davie
Wilson's unbeaten 119 for Kelso was in vain.

THE south of Scotland's first big professional golf tournament could
tee off later this year.
Plans are under way for the event with a proposed starting date at the
end of the golfing calendar in September for the Southern Scotland Open
Golf Championship. However, it may have to be postponed for a year
because the time-scale looks like being too tight.
If it gets the go-ahead, it could cost around #35,000 to stage, with
prize money of up to #30,000.
Dumfries and Galloway Regional Council have been approached by the
Scottish Professional Golfers' Association to outline a project to
establish the event.
The proposed tournament would rotate on an annual basis among five
courses in Dumfries and Galloway -- Southerness, Stranraer, Powfoot,
Portpatrick, and Dumfries.
It would be run on a similar basis to the Northern Open, which
attracts around 150 entrants and 2000 spectators.
Les Jardine, director of economic development in the region, said the
PGA are approaching major UK and multi-national companies operating in
the region for sponsorship and also seeking possible sponsorship from
the council and Enterprise Company.
He said: ''The tournament, with a reasonable amount of prize money,
would be likely to attract some of the up-and-coming professionals on
the UK golf scene.
''It would also raise the golfing profile of the region and help
promote the area as an attractive one for golfing holidays.''
Jardine is recommending backing from the regional council, but to
delay a decision on funding until more details have been announced.

When it comes to prehistoric monuments, Orkney has an embarrassment of
riches. Rennie McOwan explores the islands' fascinating tombs, standing
stones and underground houses
A GOOD looking girl called Ingigerth went to Valhalla many centuries
ago, but I bet she never imagined when she was alive that her name would
be recorded for generations to see.
She may well have been chatted up by the crew of a Norse ship because
an axe carved graffiti about her on stones inside the huge burial
chamber of Mes Howe on the ''mainland'' of Orkney. It says in Runic
letters: ''Ingigerth is the most beautiful of women.'' Viking marauders
broke into this tomb in search of treasure of Norse crusaders sheltered
there from a storm.
The islands of Orkney total over 60, about one third inhabited, and
the first impression the visitor gets is of blue seas and fertile,
low-lying green farms and big skies. A second impression is of
sea-faring people and the ancient races, of modern festivals of music
and the arts which often have their ultimate roots with the inhabitants
of pre-history who erected the standing stones, built the burial
chambers and whose semi-underground dwellings make modern tourists gasp
and attract archaeologists from all over the world.
There is no other place in Scotland where the visitor is so conscious
of ancient pedigrees. Orkney has the highest concentration of
prehistoric monuments discovered anywhere in northern Europe. On the
island of Papa Westray are the earliest surviving stone houses in
Britain. You can fly there from Westray in two minutes, the shortest
flight in the world and recorded in the Guinness Book of Records.
Orkney has known the hunters and fishers of ancient times, the raiding
Norsemen who liked the place and settled there, the tough mariners of
more recent times respected around the world for their seamanship, the
smugglers, whalers, the hated press gangs, the great ships of the
British Navy who sheltered in Scapa Flow and the Nazis who attacked or
avoided them.
Five of the islands are linked by long causeways known as the
Churchill Barriers, built by Italian prisoners-of-war after a German
submarine got into Scapa Flow and sank the battleship Royal Oak in the
early days of the Second World War. The Italians created a church out of
two huts, using scrap metal, concrete and paint in such an artistic
fashion that it is now one of Orkney's main tourist sites.
The visitor can easily suffer from what the computer people call
information overload, such is the richness of sites to examine. My own
favourite is the great red-brown cathedral of St Magnus, in Kirkwall,
the capital of Orkney. Still thriving as a Church of Scotland parish, it
was founded by Jarl Rognvald in 1137 and dedicated to his uncle, St
Magnus. Both men are buried there. Kirkwall has great shops: look out
for woollens, jewellery, cheeses and bannocks.
The town of Stromness, too, has the enduring character of Orkney about
it, picturesque and strong and with memories of Orkney's days as a
whaling centre and the early development of the Hudson's Bay Company.
There is a good museum and arts centre.
No visitors should miss the Neolithic village of Skara Brae, dating
back to 2500BC, which was gradually covered by sand dunes and perfectly
preserved for thousands of years until it was rediscoverd a century ago.
Houses were joined by covered passages and stone beds, fireplaces and
dressers survive. The farmers and herds people who buried their dead in
special tombs knew what they were about in creating their settlement. It
is strong, low slung because of the weather, compact and efficient.
Not far away is the mystical Ring of Bordgar and the Standing Stones
of Steness, the dramatic remains of ancient stone circles.
This clean and shining mosaic of islands, farms and moorland
understandably attracts many naturalists and wildlife tours are
available.
Three memories particularly stick in my mind. A visit to the island of
Rousay where the long-chambered cairn of Midhowe has herring bone
stonework and 12 stalls, where there is good coastal walking and a
depressing history of people being cleared.
The hills of Hoy, the highest in the islands, are a little bit of the
Highlands set down in Orkney. They draw the eye and so do the huge sea
cliffs. The views from the summits are spectacular. The
non-rock-climbing visitor can walk to the famous rock stac, the Old Man
of Hoy, and view it from its foot. The valley of Rackwick is a jewel of
the islands.
On the island of South Ronaldsay, at Liddle, a burial chamber was
found in recent years and nearby were the bills of many eagles. The site
became known as the Tomb of the Eagles, another find which presents
puzzles about the worship patterns of the past.
The poet George Mackay Brown, who lives in Stromness, has mused that
the great, medieval earldom of Orkney dwindled to the status of a minor
Scottish county and that Orkney's graphs were rising again in our own
time. He wrote: ''In this century Orkney has burgeoned with art and
literature: and still those crafts proliferate. Perhaps the spirit of
the saga-men, and those who built the brochs and kirks and long ships
and crofts, has never really died out: there was only a kind of
centuries long hibernation''.
He's right. Try it for yourself and see.

* GALA are to make a last-ditch effort to keep international stand-off
Gregor Townsend in Scotland when he returns from a European holiday
today.
The Netherdale club, who last week persuaded John Amos and Mark
Moncrieff not to move to Melrose, have lined up a job for Townsend with
a local employer, giving him the option of living and working in either
Edinburgh or Galashiels.
Coach Peter Dods said: ''The whole club structure of Gala has been
realligned. We expect Gregor home today, and everything possible is
being done to keep him here.''
However, Ian McGeechan, coach of English second division club
Northampton, remains confident that the youngster, who has already
signed the necessary forms, will move south in September after playing
in Australia.
''He's very positive about it,'' said McGeechan, adding that he
expected Townsend to link up with another new signing, Irish
internationalist Jonathan Bell, in time for the third Saturday of the
Courage Leagues.

A PENALTY corner conversion 37 seconds from time yesterday robbed
Scotland of victory in the three-game series in France.
It was hard luck on the Scots who had won the final match 3-1.
David Fowler marked his twenty-fifth cap by scoring his first goal for
his country -- and receiving his second suspension in two games.
Fowler's goal in the thirty-ninth minute had sealed Scotland's win,
but Stephane Saguez's late strike gave France the series on goal
difference.
Scotland had taken the lead when Gordon Shepherd converted a corner in
six minutes. Seven minutes later, the same player was on the mark with a
penalty after an amazing incident.
Shepherd had just been substituted by Richard Freeland when the latter
was fouled in the circle. Shepherd came off the bench to make the
conversion.
Good work by keeper Alistair Seaton and captain Duncan Low kept the
French out before the interval, then, in the closing quarter, Fowler hit
goal No.3.
Scotland had made a disastrous start to the series, losing Friday
night's game in Douai 4-1. Then in Saturday night's confrontation at
Cambrai, they drew 1-1 after Shepherd had shot them into a
seventeenth-minute lead.

THE Campbells are coming -- and no mistake! The clan all but took over
the Ayrshire Bowling Association Championship finals at Annbank on
Saturday.
Bobby, from Dreghorn, won the singles, Gavin, from Maybole, lifted the
junior title, Tommy, from Crooksmoss, took the pairs, and Brian, from
Ayr Newton, guiding his clubmates to the triples.
Bobby Campbell's win in the singles was over in just 13 ends -- and
that after he had trailed 4-7 after sixth ends.
A seventh-end single started the victory charge, successive 4s on the
next two put him in front, and eight shots over the last four ends
wrapped up the easiest of wins.
Gavin took the junior title for the third time, coasting to a 21-5 win
over Drongan's Hugh McGinn.
Crooksmoss's Tom McLarty Jr and Tommy Campbell faced home club pair
Gibbie Grier and Jim McCubbin in the pairs and restricted the Annbank
duo to just two counts as they romped to a 20-5 win.
The fourth Campbell success in the triples provided the best finish of
the day. Ayr Newton skip Brian Campbell and clubmates Derek McCabe and
John Newall took a 16-15 lead into the last end of their clash with
Hurlford's Drew Devlin, Jim Steel and Stuart Reid, and when Newall
ditched the jack it looked all over for Hurlford.
However, skip Reid ditched Delin's toucher only to look on in horror
as it fell the wrong side of the Ayr Newton toucher already in the
ditch, giving Newton the shot and the title.
Singles -- R Campbell (Dreghorn) 21, B Fulton (Ayr) 7. Junior singles
-- G Campbell (Maybole) 21, H McGinn (Drongan) 5. Pairs -- Crooksmoss (T
McLarty Jr and T Campbell) 20, Annbank (G Grier and J McCubbin) 5.
Triples -- Ayr Newton (D McCabe, J Newall, B Campbell) 17, Hurlford (D
Devlin, J Steel, S Reid) 15. Fours -- Symington (A Adams, J Davies, A
Jack, D Littlejohn) 16, Ayr Craigie (A Hainey, T Hendren, K Renwick, W
Duffy) 11. Senior fours -- Kilbirnie (R Perry, J Walker, S O'Hara, J
Ferrier) 16, Prestwick (T Geddes, I McKelvie, D Little, D Loudon) 13.
Youths singles -- R Rae (Hawkhill) 21, I Crawford (Galston) 13.

MIKE Hill had an eagle on the par-5 ninth hole to offset two bogeys on
the home run for a one-stroke victory in the Kroger Senior Classic
yesterday.
Hill, who led after every round, shot a 5-under-par 66 for a 17-under
196 total, two better than Gibby Gilbert's tournament-record total in
1992. Meanwhile, Britons Tony Jacklin, with a 68, and Brian Barnes, with
69, were 11 strokes adrift on 207.
Isao Aoki was second and Graham Marsh was another stroke back in
third, as they had been after Saturday's second round. Aoki and Marsh
shot 65s. The victory was worth $135,000 for Hill.

* NEW Zealand coach Laurie Mains is to quit the unpaid job when his
contract runs out at the end of this year, according to newspaper
claims.
The Sunday Star Times says the coaching position was being included in
lucrative contracts being offered to players, but that Mains was not
tempted.
Mains led the All Blacks through to last month's World Cup final
against South Africa only to lose by three points in extra time. And he
confirmed to the New Zealand paper that he would not stay in the job
beyond the end-of-season tour of Italy and France.
Mains felt the New Zealand Rugby Football Union needed to pay the
coach in the current climate. ''I don't know what their plans are, but
they won't affect me anyway because I finish at the end of this year,''
Mains is reported as saying.

BRITANNIC ASSURANCE COUNTY CHAMPIONSHIP
MIDDLESEX boosted their Championship hopes by collecting 24 points as
they beat Gloucester by an innings and 11 runs at Bristol. Resuming on
410 for two, Middlesex were bowled out for 441 -- a lead of 233. Mike
Gatting made 108 and Mark Ramprakash 133, but Gloucester were then
dismissed for 222.
Worcester completed their fifth win in six championship games when
they beat Durham by 10 wickets at Darlington. Phil Newport claimed match
figures of nine for 72 as Durham were dismissed for 255 after following
on 233 behind on 191.
Aravinda de Silva followed his first innings 255 with a flamboyant 116
for Kent at Maidstone -- but it could not save their clash with Derby
from ending in a draw.
Leaders Northants avoided the follow-on against Lancs at Old Trafford,
but face an improbable victory target of 428. Lancs declared on 280 for
nine in their second innings before Wasim Akram fired out Richard
Montgomerie to leave Northants 29 for one at the close.
A century partnership between Mark Butcher (59) and Darren Bicknell
(50no) helped Surrey reach 123 for two -- an overall lead of 67 --
against Essex at The Oval.
Michael Bevan hit his second ton in consecutive matches as Yorks
overhauled Hants' first-innings total of 429 at Southampton. Bevan
scored 107 before being bowled by Cardigan Connor at 411. Yorks declared
at 431 for eight. By the close, Hants had reached 166 for three.

ROWING:
LUCERNE has often been a happy hunting ground for Peter Haining,
Scotland's world sculling champion, but his dismal performance in the
lightweight double sculls with partner Carl Smith at the weekend has put
his Olympic Games campaign in jeopardy.
Double sculls is one of the few lightweight events on next year's
Olympic programme, and this caused Haining and Smith to come together
this year, planning to add Olympic medals to their already considerable
collections of world honours.
However, the crew has never clicked and was given a severe reminder in
Lucerne of how far off the pace they were when they could not even reach
the semi-final stage, placing them outwith the top 12.
Yesterday Haining's coach, Miles Thomas, who has been in charge of
Haining's two successful world campaigns, confirmed that a complete
review of the crew's future was now under way. This may see Haining
attempt to win the world single sculls title in Finland next month and
then spend the next year rebuilding an Olympic crew.
By contrast, Steve Redgrave and Matthew Pinsent showed that their
Olympic campaign is still well on target. This invincible partnershire
stamped their authority on the coxless pairs final, which they won by
clear water, ahead of Italy and Croatia.
With this performance, Redgrave enhanced his likelihood of picking up
a fouth successive Olympic gold medal next year in Atlanta.
The only other British win of the weekend came in the lightweight
eights final. The British crew had two former Scottish internationalists
aboard, Jim McNiven and stroke Ben Helm. They led from the start and
held off all the challenges Denmark, who finished second, could throw at
them.
The women's eight included Dot Blackie from Edinburgh and finished
fifth in their final, which was won by the Netherlands.

HOW many Cinque Ports are there? A silly question some may think for
cinque surely means five. But it's not that simple. Long before the
charter of 1278 the seaports of Sandwich, Dover, Hythe, Romney and
Hastings had banded loosely together in the interest of defence.
This was put on an official basis by King Edward I who pressed the
towns into service to fight his sea battles off the portion of English
coastline closest to France. In return for these services they were
granted various privileges making them rich and powerful.
Two further towns, Rye and Winchelsea, that closely supported the
endeavours of neighbouring Hastings, were rewarded by being made ''head
ports'' bringing the number to seven.
The easternmost Cinque Port is Sandwich. Little has changed in this
quiet backwater and its streets and buildings stand as a living monument
to medieval times. Yet there is nothing museumish about it, as a walk
along its ancient ways will reveal. The port may have silted up but
low-draught barges are still active in the quay.
No-one who travels through Dover can fail to note the massive keep of
its castle high above England's most famous white cliffs. Its
cliff-perched fortifications became one of the most strategic stongholds
in Europe. They include the ruins of a Roman lighthouse and a Saxon
church. Dotted around are other historic mementos of an exciting past,
including the excavated Roman painted house and the fort-like town hall.
There is also the lavish White Cliffs Experience exhibition with a World
War Two theme.
Hythe never attained the power and prosperity of some of its
associates. Above the town Saltwood Castle retains its fame as the venue
of the plot to assassinate Thomas Becket, while the parish church of St
Leonard draws visitors to its skull-filled crypt. Hythe's present claim
to fame is vested in the miniature Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway,
a unique experience in steam train travel. The famous Romney Marsh which
lies close by is more strange than beautiful.
Without doubt Rye is the gem of the Cinque Ports. Its situation atop a
knoll is dramatic enough but its medieval buildings, countless black and
white timber-framed houses, narrow cobbled streets, the Ypres Tower
fortification and a wall breached by gatehouses draw tourists in hordes.
And so to Hastings with its connotations of that celebrated date:
1066. Here we have a flourishing resort full of seaside pleasures, but
behind this facade lies the old town and all that remains of a harbour
once thought to be the premier port of the confederation. Streets packed
with overhanging timbered houses lead down to an active fisherman's
beach, the Stade, characterised by distinctive black net ''shops''
standing erect like sentinels of its ancient beginnings.
All the way along this ever-changing coast sprout the Martello towers
that guarded it against a more recent enemy, for this corner of England
forever remains in the front line of the great events of her history.

SCOTTISH COUNTIES:
THE vast experience of Andy Bee, and a touch of the jitters by
Strathmore's tailenders, snatched a draw from the jaws of defeat for
Aberdeenshire in a superb Caley 80/- Counties Championship clash on
Saturday.
This derby at Mannofield was set up perfectly from the end of the
Aberdeen innings, with Graham Bone unbeaten on 62, Kevin Thomson having
cut a swathe through the remainder of the home batting with five wickets
for 17 runs, leaving them all out on 146.
It should have been a comfortable total to pass, especially on a
wicket not being renowned for being bowler-friendly.
Step-in Sanju Mudkavi, with five for 27, Willie Park with three for
34, and then Mr Bee.
It was quite a set-up. The victory was there for the taking, with
Strathie requiring only six runs off the last two overs, and then four
off the final one. Defeat for the visitors seemed unlikely.
Three dot balls, followed by Andy Monteith going lbw to Bee, suddenly
had the visitors on 142 for nine, and actually looking as though they
might lose.
As Bee, who has what he describes as ''around 30 caps for Scotland --
I don't count them,'' said yesterday: ''I had two deliveries left to get
us the win. The first one just missed the stumps, and they could only
get one run off the final ball. It was quite a match.''
Defeat they might have avoided, but the 13 points apiece kept
Aberdeenshire just in top spot in the table, which now means that
Ayrshire jump into second place with Stirling, Arbroath and Strathmore
following on.
The Prestwick side also were involved in a tight affair against
Fifeshire at McKane Park.
Ashok Malhotra was this week's choice for captain -- there has been a
problem in that spot since Wayne Sullivan resigned -- and he led by
example, hitting 87, Ewan Ogilvie just failing to make his half century
with 48, and Azlam Raza knocking a useful 37 in the home side's 209 all
out.
Dominic Rigby continued his recent form with the bat, hitting an
unbeaten 94 as Ayrshire decided to chase full points.
Drew Parsons was also in the 30s, but despite Ashok chipping in with
three wickets for 66, it was not enough, Ayrshire finishing on 213 for
eight to win by two wickets.
The Boghall pitch certainly was not to the liking of the top batsmen
of West Lothian and Stirling County. No sooner had they made their
customary marks at the crease, they seemed to be trudging back to the
clubhouse.
Amazing, really, when you consider that the later order chaps -- who
can be regarded as easy marks by bowlers in a tight situation -- did not
seem to have too much trouble in a match that petered out to a draw.
Stirling had the home side in all sorts of trouble at 58 for five
until Ken Bowie and Alan Farquharson came together.
The 18-year-old Bowie hammered four 4s in his 25, putting on a
sixth-wicket partnership of 39 before being caught and bowled by Willie
Morton.
John Hewitt, a 25-year-old batsman from York who joined the club only
in May of this year,made his first-team debut, and he and Farquharson
hammered a magnificent partnership of 81, Farquharson making 45 with six
4s and Hewitt 41 with five boundaries.
It helped West Lothian stride to a respectable total of 185 for eight.
Bruce Russell was Stirling's pick of the bowling with four for 65.
It was almost like watching a repeat when Stirling took to the crease.
Their first five batsmen could not even make double figures as five
wickets tumbled at 9, 24, 31, 42, and 53.
West Lothian went for the kill with close-in fielders, Stirling shut
up shop, and although Ian Beven managed three for 31 and Graham Welsh
three for 42, Stirling held out comfortably to finish with 124 for
seven, with their saviour once again being New Zealand professional Kyle
Wealleans. The opener carried his bat to an unbeaten 63.
Bottom club Perthshire's Jack Ker waded right through Clackmannan at
The Arns with bowling figures of seven for 20, but the wee county held
out at 75 for eight.
The Perth side had set a highly respectable 221 for seven as the
target with Graeme Ferguson and Lal Rajput each making 40 and Ker, Chris
Galloway, and Kash Kalil in the 30s.
Clackmannan bowlers Bruce Auchinleck (3-51) and Malcolm Howell (3-68)
had to work hard for their wickets.
Forfarshire's Peter Drinnen hit a superb 71 but, unfortunately for the
Forthill side, it was not enough as they plunged to 158 all out to
visitors Arbroath County, thanks to three wickets apiece from Mohamed
Zahid (3-45) and Neil Burnett (3-57).
The Salmonds -- George with an unbeaten 38 and John with 39 -- and
Kevin Ritchie's 61 not out helped Arbroath cruise home by nine wickets.

'Women's tennis is no dead. There is competition and we can play'
STEFFI GRAF
THE Centre Court on Saturday underwent a glorious transformation and
by the time Steffi Graf and Arantxa Sanchez Vicario had taken their
final into a compellingly savage final set, the staid old arena was
alive and vibrant with emotions which belonged to another sport. The
most famous tennis arena in the world became like the Nou Camp.
Every time Sanchez Vicario hit a winning passing shot, her supporters
cheered her success. When she scampered on those small, thick legs --
more Maradona than Madonna -- to return balls which just about every
other player would have given up, her congregation rose in riotous
acclaim.
During the changeovers, the Spaniard's people, who were packed in and
around the players' guest box, indulged in the sort of rhythmic, almost
tribal hand-clapping that can be heard in many Continental football
grounds. It was their way of letting their little one -- at 5ft 6in
Sanchez Vicario may be vertically challenged in a sport in which height
can be a distinct advantage -- know she was not alone, not even when she
sat staring at the grass sipping her juice.
At those times she looked like a vulnerable and lonely child, which,
of course, she is anything but. Sanchez Vicario, like Jimmy Connors when
he was at the height of his powers, is a fierce street-fighter and
invokes the same kind of support and respect as the American used to
when he played Wimbledon.
It was hardly surprising, then, that the Spaniards were driven to
break all the rules of Wimbledon decorum, but no-one was dragged off to
the Tower. The drama being played out was too intense, too fierce to
fret about etiquette.
It didn't matter either that the Championships had to wait until the
penultimate day's play for signs of activity within the women's game.
When finally they were offered, the signs suggested ferocious life and
when it was all over after 122 pulsating and sometimes unbearably tense
minutes, the Centre Court crowd were left exhausted.
It was barely all they could do to haul themselves to their feet and
applaud the champion and her beaten rival. Some of Sanchez Vicario's
tribe stayed slumped in their seats, heads buried in hands. This, they
had felt certain after Sanchez Vicario had taken the first set 6-4,
would be the day she would finally conquer Wimbledon.
However, while they fought back tears, their own champion retained a
spring in her step throughout the presentation ceremony. She had played
her best, but she had come up against the best and this, she had clearly
decided, was an honourable defeat.
No tears, no moping, only that wide, disarming smile. ''I am pleased
in a way because I gave everything I had to this match. It wasn't
enough, but I can't be hard on myself because of that,'' she said.
If Sanchez Vicario and her supporters had brought a football
atmosphere to the tennis then it has to be said Graf, who had beaten
Sanchez Vicario in the final of the French Open last month, performed
like the German national team. She had the technique, the steely
determination, the power and ultimately the glory.
One was left wondering how much longer this truly remarkable athlete
will be able to remain so focused, especially now that she has to be
careful between matches because of a back injury. Having claimed her
sixth Wimbledon title, and a large space in the sport's history, there
is little more for the 26-year-old to achieve.
She insists she will be back, but the manner in which she celebrated
Saturday's victory -- displaying more emotion than she had done in any
of her five previous wins on Centre Court -- provided food for thought.
Was she celebrating at the end of an astonishing final or was she simply
celebrating the end?
No-one could have beaten her on Saturday, when her remarkable
resilience and punishing forehand drives kept her in the match until the
pretender crumbled towards the end of a memorable final set which took
the breath away and will be recalled in years to come. This was the most
compelling women's final ever seen at Wimbledon, perhaps anywhere in the
world.
The second last game of the final set was momentous and as it began
the noise of an alarm going off in the distance drifted over the court
on the gentle breeze. Someone was about to steal Sanchez Vicario's
dream.
With each player in possession of a set -- Graf won the second 6-1 --
and five games each, everyone could sense the crucial time had arrived,
but no-one could have anticipated just how ferocious the eleventh game
would be. It lasted 20 minutes, contained 32 points and stood at deuce
13 times. Eight times Sanchez Vicario served at game point and Graf had
six break points before finally ending the agony.
There was a changeover, and as both women sat on either side of the
umpire's chair, the crowd knew it was all over.
The end was mercifully swift. Graf strode to the baseline and two
minutes later had served to love. It was over, thankfully. There had
been too much excitement, too much raw drama.
After Graf had run from court to appear in the players' guest box,
where she was swallowed in the embrace of her parents, Heidi and Peter,
and her coach Heinz Gunthardt, she returned to take possession again of
the rosewater dish and receive a cheque for #328,000, she said: ''I am
just so proud of the way I kept coming back when it seemed as though
Arantxa would win.
''That has given me great pleasure and it is nice also to let everyone
see that women's tennis is not dead. There is competition and we can
play.''
Sanchez Vicario, who has now lost to Graf 26 times, although never so
dramatically as on Saturday, will continue her conversion to grass-court
tennis and perhaps one day she may even win. At 23 she has time on her
side, but she must hope Graf's back problem will prevent her from
scaling such heights of excellence again.
It would be a mighty loss indeed if the German, who has won 91 singles
titles including 16 Grand Slams in a 13-year career to her credit, felt
she could not continue. Only surgery will cure her back problem -- she
has a bone spur near the base of her spine -- but she refuses to put
down her racket and take time out for an operation.
The realisation that, having won so many honours and amassed so much
money, there is nothing left to prove comes to them all eventually. It
happened to Chris Evert, Bjorn Borg, Jimmy Connors, John McEnroe and
Stefan Edberg, and that's when the younger players make their moves.
Sanchez Vicario made her's on Saturday, but she will have to kick her
heels for another year. ''I will definitely be back,'' she said. ''This
was a wonderful experience and I almost did it. I have to try again. I'm
so close I couldn't give up now.''
Spoken like a true competitor.

THE match between Celtic and Newcastle United scheduled for August 5
could be a sporting clash of the cardinals. Herald reader Leslie Clark
of Milngavie writes: ''His eminence Cardinal Winning is well known for
his interest in the fortunes of Celtic. As it happens, his colleague
Cardinal Basil Hume has an equally long and close affiliation with
Newcastle United.''
Mr Clark tells us about Cardinal Hume, or Bazza as we can surely call
him in this footballing context: ''Despite his plummy Ampleforth accent,
Cardinal Hume is a Geordie through and through and at the drop of a hat
can recite the composition of the famous Newcstle teams of the 1950s,
including the legendary ex-Third Lanark player Bobby Mitchell.''
By historical co-incidence, the Newcastle FA Cup winning side of 1951
visited Parkhead in September of that year when the result was a 3-3
draw.
Mr Clark says it is an opportunity to turn what is already billed as a
gala opening into a public relations coup by inviting both cardinals to
the match. At the Sporting Diary we think they could go even further by
having Bazza and Top Tim Tommo lead out their respective teams.
* WITH no proper football matches on at this time of year, the addict
is driven to such lengths as poring over the results in the Intertoto
Cup. There you can forage to see how teams with such strange names as
Univ Cluj, Tervis Parnu, Beitar Jerusalem, FC Boby Brno, Pogon Szczecin,
Dnepr Mogilev, and Partick Thistle are getting on.
Seriously, sad people with nothing to do on a Saturday can pore over
the results for the West of Scotland indoor football as published in the
Saturday Times. At least the team names raise a smile.
In the Pitz/Hamilton Friday night league we find a middle of the table
outfit called the People's Front of Judea. Propping up Division 2 is a
team called Sexual Chocolate. Leading Division 3, but obviously only
through severe pochling, are Monklands Mafia. Hadjuk Spliff are a bunch
of chaps who would presumably have bother passing a drugs test.
There is nothing your average Scottish fan likes more than to
associate with the great names of European football. Thus the indoor
pitches of our land are full of such teams as Sparta Pollok, Borussia
Dumplings, Aye Axe, Real Bollocks, Unathletic Madrid, and Red Star Below
Grade.
The city of Milan, of course, features prominently in football
fantasies and we have such teams as Mini Milan, Outer Milan, Southpark
Milan, Interpark Milan, and Rab C. Milan, who must look lovely in their
string vests.
* A COUPLE of Auld Alliance stories of a sporting nature -- a piece of
cultural exchange from the non-sporting part of the newspaper. In the
first, Stephen O'Neill of Bearsden tells how his chum, whom we will call
George from Torrance, had travelled to Marseille for a European Cup tie
in the grand old days when Rangers used to get beyond the preliminary
rounds.
Not being a fanatic, George was still sporting a rather faded Rangers
top bearing the name C R Smith as sponsor. Out for a wee swally the
night before the match, George was approached by a Marseille fan and
asked to swap jerseys. He duly obliged, despite being told by a local
that the French jersey was of such a vintage that it should have been in
the Louvre and Marseille had a new sponsor and a different strip.
The next day George was on his way to the match when he was stopped by
a Rangers fan with the request: ''Haw, Frenchy, dae ye want tae swap
jerseys?'' George noticed the Bear was wearing the latest Rangers away
jersey. He pretended not to understand, but when the Rangers fan
indicated by gesture the nature of the transaction, George said: ''Ah,
oui!'' and graciously decided to exchange tops in the name of the Auld
Alliance.
The second story is from the world of rugby. Ayr were playing Heriot
Watt and, for some obscure reason, the referee was French. His
interpretation of the rules of the game was somewhat different from that
of the players and the crowd.
After one particularly dubious decision, a frustrated spectator could
restrain himself no longer and shouted: ''Referee, vous etes un
pillock!'' It is not known if the ref understood, but the standard of
his refereeing did not noticeably improve.

THE recent announcement by ScotRail that a through Glasgow-Dunfermline
service is being introduced was overshadowed by likely industrial
action, but is to be welcomed nevertheless.
My 1961 timetable shows a similar service, including direct trains to
many other places in Fife, including St Andrews.
Within the Glasgow area it was possible to reach such places as
Uplawmoor, Darvel, Beith, Renfrew, Kilmacolm, Coalburn, Strathaven, and
many other destinations, all within the southern commuter area.
North of the river, Kirkintilloch, Possil, Alloa, Doune, Callander,
Crieff, and Dollar still had services.
It must be galling for residents of such areas as Elderslie, Howwood,
Castlecary, Dullatur, and Bonnybridge to have high-speed trains rush
past but not stop as the station was closed a long time ago.
It is clear that many of these routes will never reopen thanks to
short-sighted redevelopment across the trackbeds and a scorched-earth
policy of demolishing viaducts and re-aligned roads. It is clear,
however, that there is still a demand for some of these services, if
this anecdote is typical of conversations at the Queen Street, Glasgow,
ticket office.
Customer: ''Return to Bonnybridge, please.'' Ticket clerk searches
through timetable and fares list in vain. I quietly advise the customer
to go to the bus station as he is about 30 years too late.
Next customer: ''Single to St Andrews, please.'' This time I say
nothing. Ticket clerk repeats the exercise and asks his mate. I leave it
to them to tell him to go to Leuchars and get a bus or taxi.
When all over Europe vast amounts of money are being spent on
railways, EU cash is available in huge doses, and we are now linked by
the Channel Tunnel, it is very depressing that so many places in
Scotland could be reconnected at relatively low cost.
Much has been done in Strathclyde with new and reopened stations,
better services, and new rolling stock, but with impending local
government reorganisation much of this benefit could be lost.
We badly need some coherent policy but rail privatisation will work
against that. Road building continues apace and congestion and pollution
increase.
Will I ever see a train to Renfrew (Fulbar Street) or Back o'Loch
Halt?

I CANNOT begin to describe how distasteful and depressing it is to
find within your pages such a piece of redundant and conceptually
offensive bumf -- the ''Executive Cars Review'' (July 6).
At a time when areas within Glasgow city centre have been declared the
most air-polluted in Europe, and a time when every right-minded person
is outraged by the unnecessary perks and pay rises awarded to
''executives'' in this country, I find it inexcusable and intolerable
that your newspaper should choose, by printing this irrelevant and
superlative-ridden twaddle, to massage the egos of the misguided fools
who would aspire to the dizzy heights of ownership of these filthy,
inefficient buckets of bolts.
The inevitable outcome of such ambitions manifests itself in the
phenomenon known as road rage. May it overcome all the stuffed shirts
gridlocked in the city centre, while the enlightened travel underground,
reading a newspaper and/or communing (almost -- well at least there's a
possibility of it!) with their fellow travellers, instead of cursing at
them.

MONICA Seles could soon be ready to end her two-year exile from
competitive tennis. The former world No.1, who has not played in public
since she was stabbed in the back at a tournament in Hamburg in 1993,
hinted as much at a specially-convened press conference at the weekend,
although she stopped short of naming a specific date for her return.
''It's time to have fun and play some great tennis,'' she said, adding
that she hopes to compete at the US Open in August and perhaps a warm-up
tournament.''I feel I'm ready both physically and emotionally. If I'm
good, I'll be there. If I'm not, I don't deserve to be there.''
When asked what was holding her back from naming a date, Seles
replied: ''I want to be sure, I mean, you know, 100 per cent, I'm
planning to, I really want to play there, the Grand Slams for me are
very special.''
For several months now she has edged closer to competition and plans
an exhibition match with Martina Navratilova in Atlantic City on July
29. She and her family have increasingly alluded to the possibility of
her return after two years of virtual seclusion in Florida.
Seles played down the fact that the press conference was being held on
Ladies' Final Day at Wimbledon, saying the organisers of the Special
Olympics, with whom she has been associated since 1992, had asked her to
appear on this date. She said she did not watch Steffie Graf's dramatic
defeat of Arantxa Sanchez Vicario because she was practicing.
It was not the first time Seles missed Wimbledon, the only Grand Slam
she has never won, nor the first time she seemed to enjoy being
mysterious. She missed the 1991 Wimbledon and -- because she was
incommunicado -- was presumed to be pregnant, or involved with
millionaire Donald Trump, or in a host of other colourful conditions. In
1993, she was out for 63 days with an unnamed virus.
Seles, who is currently unranked, said she had not yet entered the US
Open, but the issue of a special WTA ranking which had been proposed,
then withdrawn, was not holding her back.
It is not the first time she has been coy about her intentions to
return. FILA, the Italian sportswear company, sued Seles in November,
claiming her agent had told them several times that she would be
returning to the game, a charge her management group denies. Wearing a
FILA tennis outfit and giggling, Seles said she was surprised by the
lawsuit and ''hopes we can both work it out.''
She added that she had taken her career too seriously and now wants to
have fun and get on with her life. Her father had told her she had
become ''Monica, the different person'' instead of ''Monica, the happy
person.''
''I think women's tennis can survive without Monica and Monica can
survive without tennis,'' said Seles. ''But we're both better off with
each other.''

MR Wiliam Waldegrave, former Minister of Agriculture, hailed the new
EU regulations governing live animal transport as a great step forward
for animal welfare despite the refusal by Sweden, Denmark, and Austria
to agree to them on the grounds that the journey times were too lax.
In effect the new rules have set up a two-tier system. For animals
transported in conventional (current) lorries the journey limit is eight
hours: for animals transported in hi-tech vehicles sheep can be
transported for up to 30 hours and calves for 20.
However, in all instances, after a rest perid of of 24 hours any
journey can resume, so there is no such thing as a maximum journey time.
The journey limits are not limits at all; simply breaks for food,
water, and rest. Journeys of limitless times are possible. This has not
been made clear.
Unfortunately, as Spain now has the presidency of the EU, to be
followed by Italy, then Ireland, the future for farm animals looks very
bleak for the next 18 months.
It is now clear that tinkering with journey times is not the way to
save animals suffering. The only recourse is to have them reclassified,
under EU rules, as sentient beings and not, as they are at present, as
agricultural tools.
Only by reclassifying them in this way can they be given due respect,
care and attention by law.
Ultimately the aim is not to export live animals at all for human
consumption and by slaughtering them in the UK jobs will be increased in
the associated meat and slaughter trades.

NOT only is the world changing but apparently so too is that pit-stop
motoring necessity called the petrol station. I could not believe my
eyes or my ears when recently I had to try to obtain an ignition lead
for my car while driving home late one night, a simple remedy for my
ailing car trouble.
Alas, having approached several petrol stations, I was informed by the
staff that they no longer stocked those items. One member of staff
retorted: ''Is that something to do with yir car?''
Why it is that such multi-million dollar companies need to stock the
likes of toothpaste, cat food, beans and other such items when it is
motorists for whom petrol stations exist?
Are the oil companies in such desperate need for that additional
income? What has happened to the needs of the motorist? Do we no longer
matter?
Obviously, the needs of the negligent shopper rate higher than those
of the everyday motorist.

I FIRST crossed the Minch in the MacBrayne's ship, the Shiela, but I
was of an age not to remember much about the journey. Thereafter in
succeeding years I have made the journey between the long island and the
mainland in a variety of vessels right up to the present day.
What great progress has been made and now that the new Isle of Lewis
will be cutting the present three-and-a-half-hour journey between
Ullapool and Stornoway by one hour Lewis indeed will be well served.
I would compliment the catering staff on the quality of their cooked
meals, which are served promptly and with civility. Why, therefore, does
the company spoil its image by charging so much for small items?
I refer to such things as chocolate biscuits. I have over a number of
years challenged CalMac with no effect. Do any of your readers feel that
CalMac has any justification for charging 40 pence for a biscuit which
can be purchased for 10 to 12 pence (less than 10p if bought In a pack
of eight)?
When I asked a member of the catering staff why the price was so high
I was told that I was not alone in querying it. The price is decided by
the firm centrally, I was told.
Why does an excellent firm such as CalMac indulge in such a rip-off?

I TAKE objection to David R Yule's assertion that I have either been
living in another planet or deliberately trying to mislead Herald
readers in stating that the recommendations of the Sheehy inquiry were
diluted due to the subsequent report's rejection by police
representative bodies (July 5).
I quote James Freeman, home affairs reporter: ''The Government
yesterday ditched the most radical proposals of the Sheehy report,
bowing to unprecedented pressure from the police service and coming up
with a watered-down programme of reforms'' (October 29, 1993).
By his irresponsible statements Mr Yule emphatically provides yet
another police example of emotion overruling accuracy.
What has obsessed police persons in their irrational objection to the
Sheehy report is money and the prospect of having to work for it at all
levels of the service.
The quality of police recruit usually reflects the job market at a
particular period in time. It would be extravagant to claim that every
officer has altruistic aims.
Yet the police has ever been a secure, well-paid job for life,
irrespective of returns in terms of efficiency or job interest. In such
a situation the problem has been how to reward the consistently keen and
motivated officer when the carrot of promotion is not a sure option.
Furthermore, in modern conditions when police persons are no longer
exposed to the debilitating effects of inclement weather and long hours
stationary upon a traffic point, it is difficult to justify retiral at,
say, 50 years of age on two-thirds annual salary -- this to take up a
perhaps more demanding pensionable job to which a state pension may
later be added.
The burden on the taxpayer of providing these pensions to an
increasing number of senior ranks with absolutely no return is both
considerable and unjustifiable.
It is this mercenary aspect that police persons cloak in nebulous
references to the unique style of British policing and its traditions.
It is noticeable that recent purveyors of this hokum, such as Mr Yule,
never refer to conditions which necessitated the Sheehy inquiry.
I would seriously doubt if Mr Yule has ever experienced the benefits
of traditional beat policing or has been fully appraised of them at
second-hand for despite strong local opposition, many rural police
stations throughout the country have been abandoned and whole
communities all but left to the depredation of travelling criminals and
local hooligans.
In towns and cities public contact with a uniformed police person has
virtually ceased and street offences abound. No longer does the police
person exhibit such pride in the service that he or she is prepared to
travel on and off duty in full uniform and thus provide an additional
crime deterrent.
What is sure is that there is never a scarcity of applicants for
police appointments and this will remain so irrespective of radical
changes in pay and conditions. However, dilution of the Sheehy report
has ensured that the service will continue in stagnation and with
rewards for the prospective beat officer bleak.
Not, I would suggest, the scenario which should attract the highest
accolades to police leadership in our day.

<TEXT>
THERE is an understandable tendency in British politics to see
everything within the context of the kailyard. Last week's reshuffle and
the implications drawn from the shift of Michael Portillo from
Employment to Defence provides a perfect example. Although Defence is an
important ministry, it was seen as a loss of influence, a sideways move
which ring fenced him from the major issues of domestic policy and kept
him off influential economic policy committees. But that is to disregard
the role a Defence Secretary plays in the formation of Britain's foreign
policy through his seat on the small but influential Cabinet Defence and
Overseas Policy Committee, and through the work of his department. He is
involved in European matters, particularly with the French, both over
the nature of the EU's future defence role and in the handling of the
crisis in the former Yugoslavia where we have troops. Our relations with
the United States fall within his area of interest through our role in
Nato -- the Atlantic Community proposal, after all, was not floated by
the then Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, but by the Defence Secretary,
Malcom Rifkind. A close working partnership existed between Mr Hurd and
Mr Rifkind and it will be interesting to see if a similar rapport can be
established by Mr Rifkind and Mr Portillo.
Another instance of the kailyard attitude is that, although Europe has
been a disruptive issue domestically, 1995 in foreign policy terms has
been relatively tranquil. There is said to be no reason for that to
change. The heads of government meeting in September in Majorca will
provide a chance for exchanging ideas in advance of next year's
intergovernmental conference, which is not now seen as likely to cause
horrendous problems. The prospect of a single currency may set some
blood boiling here, but it is no longer top of the agenda. One factor in
this change of mood is President Chirac. Whereas President Mitterrand
always used an interpreter, President Chirac speaks excellent English
and when he last met Mr Major did so for two hours, only resorting to
the interpreter when stuck for a word.

I HAVE been following with interest the debate with regard to the
change in mortgage assistance from the DSS when someone becomes
unemployed.
To me it is not unreasonable for any parties purchasing their own home
to make their own provision in the case of unemployment for at least the
first 12 months, which means Government funds can be directed in areas
where they are most needed.
The Labour Party may also have a hidden agenda in its opposition to
this change as the more people put off purchasing their own homes the
greater the demand for council homes, which would mean a large council
house building programme resulting in even greater public expenditure
and no change to the number of unemployed.
This would reverse the trend of less dependenciy on the state to a
greater dependency and more Government interference.

I NOTE an increasing tendency among journalists to use infer and imply
interchangeably. In fairness usage seems to have endorsed this with the
misuse so common that some dictionaries give imply as one of the
definitions of infer without comment.
Fowler has this to say: ''Each word has its own job to do, one at the
giving end and the other at the receiving (What do you imply by that
remark? What am I to infer from that remark?) and should be left to do
it without interference.''

MY FIRST car was an MG two-seater, sporty, leaky, and ancient, a cool
machine on account of the absence of side screens that set me back a
mere #65 . . . untold former owners and an ecstatic new one about to
discover the charms of a crash box, cable brakes, heavy oil consumption,
and that elixir of the youthful, freedom of movement.
Last weekend I was offered another soft-top motor car, a Rolls-Royce
Corniche IV to be precise, for just #105 -- easy payments to take the
sting out of parting with the long green -- an allegedly ''unheard'' of
bargain against the normal retail price of #166,483 no pence. It
measured eight and five-eighths of an inch long because, even in our
model world, that was what it was. Is that inflation or did I get a snip
with the MG notwithstanding the hole in the floor and the need to top up
the radiator every 20 miles?
The offer, which I managed to resist without any strain whatsoever,
was in one of those glossy weekend mags that come with the Wapping
broadsheets, a cornucopia of the bizarre intended to make the reader
believe his head is not his own. The same, for the politically correct,
applies also to women.
There was the usual rash of adverts for bricks to make the purchaser's
front garden look like a petrol station forecourt and cars to park on
the bricks to lend authenticity. There were also dilemmas posed in the
form of holidays suggesting Christmas in the Caribbean, Christmas in the
Far East, or possibly, with prices up to #10,920, Christmas in the
Bankruptcy Court.
Also there were offers of no-expense-spared tailor-made shirts --
''made personally for you'' -- cut by hand, not foot, from 300 different
fabrics at a price that, alas, did not make it on to the ad. Adverts for
hats with filtered air holes were in abundance -- an absolute must in
our torrid, mosquito-ridden British summers -- as were a bewildering
array of hi-tech baths for the infirm and clip-on staircase elevator
seats to get the purchaser from the hat stand to the bathroom.
One such ad showed a jolly gent in a white towelling, no nonsense,
inexpensive bath robe. His smile might have been even broader had he
turned to an earlier page where its floral equivalent was being punted
to the insanely rich or next week's National Lottery winner at a mere
#900. Cheaper if you dip but daily to use fivers.
Most intriguing amid the hard-pushed offers was one by a firm
promising to fit a luxury bedroom in my home at substantially reduced
cost if only I would allow the company to show it to three of their
potential customers. Are they nuts -- have they no idea what my
substantially reduced fully fitted bedroom, once occupied, would do to
their trade? Surely the beauty of show houses, show kitchens, and show
bedrooms is that no-one has ever lived in them, cooked in them or slept
in them, is not interested to and never will.
Two or three nights of me in my fully fitted bedroom and trips around
the debris of daily life, the detritus of multi-faceted sloth, could be
offered by one of those companies specialising in Chamber of Horrors
tours as an alternative to Christmas in the Caribbean -- and cheaper.
The fitted bedroom guided tour offer is one, it seems to me, that the
manufacturer could yet come to regret.
But hands-down winner for the most banal advert in the magazine's
collection of low-key lunacy was the come-on for instant global
communication from what appeared to be one of the lesser foothills in
the flatlands of East Anglia. ''Now you can send a fax from the middle
of nowhere'' ran the slogan before the copy writer gave up on English
and slipped into semi-conductor e-mail speak. Gosh. Really? At last?
Why? Why would I want to drive into the boondocks, part of a mild grassy
slope above a wee pond, and send out faxed messages to what would become
a fast-dwindling band of friends and a rapidly growing list of shrinks?
Is there anyone so conceited as really to believe that the world at
large wants to receive their distilled wisdom on a single short sheet of
fax paper when, to all intents and purposes, and as far as the Internet
is aware, they are communing with nature somewhere in the pea fields?
Who knows, possibly there are men of financial fibre sufficient to
allow them to read without a mild fit the advert that asked, ''A typical
second home in the Cotswolds?'' before answering its own question with a
firm ''No'' and offering a ''smarter move'' home for an apparently
bargain basement of #106,000.
For #106,000 Cyber-man gets a three-bedroom, two-bathroom ''lodge''
overlooking a secluded lake, the opportunity for his children to bathe
or fish ''in their own private river'' and, for Mr C and his Missus, the
joys of year-round tennis on all-weather courts and coarse fishing on
lakes which are, of course, private.
Living in Scotland, where first ''lodges'' currently average #50,500,
the thought of stumping up more than twice the sum for a second one to
live ''privately'' apart from one's fellows brings on more than slight
nausea, quickening of the pulse and raised blood pressure. Or could it
just be that since I first emptied the piggy bank to buy that old MG
times have truly changed?

AT Glasgow's magnificent Bartoli recital the piano accompanist
displayed superb artistry. Steven Blier created a myriad of tone colours

IT was a privilege to hear Jessye Norman give a wonderful recital in
the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall on July 6. We are very lucky that such an
artist is prepared to come to Glasgow but it is a great shame that the
calibre of the audience did not match the quality of the singer or the
music.
The blame must lie partly with the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall
management. The publicity for this recital did not indicate what Miss
Norman would be singing and the programme notes themselves were not laid
out in a way which would indicate how the audience ought to respond.
In spite of the offers of ''free soothing sweets'' by the management
for those who had coughs or dry throats the noise of coughing throughout
the concert was extremely distracting and irritating. The unfortunate
people with coughs seemed to have made little effort to muffle the sound
with handkerchiefs.
I do hope this will not deter Miss Norman from returning to Glasgow
and giving us all such a treat.

SAM Torrance was the toast of Erin last night when he won a thrilling
victory after a play-off in the Irish Open at Mount Juliet. The
41-year-old Scot, also winner of the Italian Open this season, clinched
the #112,000 first prize with a 12-foot putt for an eagle 3 on the
second play-off hole.
''This is my finest win ever,'' he declared. ''To beat a field of this
class, and in that style, was particularly saisfying.''
Then Sam, who was cheered by Irish fans, revealed he had not expected
to play in the tournament at all. His wife, Suzanne, was due to have
their third child this week and Torrance intended to take time off.
''But little Anouska checked in a week early, so I re-entered the
Irish. What gave Sam special pleasure was that this victory clinches his
Ryder Cup place for the eighth time.
Torrance, who had a final round of 71, went into the play-off against
his old friend Howard Clark and 21-year-old Stuart Cage from Leeds.
Cage put his ball in the water at the first extra hole, but Clark
fought tenaciously, holing out for a birdie at the next, the long
seventeenth. Sam went one better.

ARANTXA Sanchez Vicario has not left Wimbledon without a title. The
determined Spanish girl yesterday earned consolation for her hard-fought
singles defeat by Steffi Graf when she and partner Czech Jana Novotna
scored a 5-7, 7-5, 6-4 victory over top seeds Gigi Fernandez and Natasha
Zvereva in the women's doubles.
Play had resumed at 4-4 in the final set after bad light had forced
the women off court on Saturday evening. However, Sanchez Vicario and
Novotna, seeded two, needed only two more games to end the reign of the
top-ranked pair who had won the doubles crown for the last three years.
It was also a welcome victory for Novotna who lost to Graf in the
semi-finals.
* PETER McNamara, of Australia, and Leif Shiras, of America, took the
senior men's doubles title, defeating Mansour Bahrami of Iran and Jose
Higueras of Spain 7-6 (12-10), 7-5.

RANGERS will complete the formalities today of the record summer
transfer which has brought Paul Gascoigne to Ibrox, writes Ken
Gallacher.
The midfielder will be in Glasgow at lunchtime to finalise the #4.3m
transfer agreed between Italian club Lazio and the Scottish champions
last month. And, inside 48 hours, Gascoigne will learn of his first
major challenge for his new club. On Wednesday, Rangers find out who
they must play in the preliminary round of the European Champions' Cup
next month.
Weekend news from the UEFA confirmed that Rangers could face difficult
opponents, and former European foes, in Steaua Bucharest and Dynamo
Kiev, as well as the Hungarian side Ferencvaros, whom they met in one of
their earliest excursions into European competition.
Going into the European draws with Rangers will be UEFA Cup
representatives Motherwell and Raith Rovers, but Celtic still seem sure
to be seeded in the Cup-winners' Cup, although there were doubts
expressed over the weekend. A full meeting of UEFA's competitions
committee tomorrow will clear that position once and for all.
Meanwhile, as the Gascoigne saga ends, Ibrox manager Walter Smith
still awaits definite news of his other major summer target, Romanian
World Cup star Florin Raducioiou.

MARTINA Navratilova won her nineteenth Wimbledon title when she
partnered American Jonathan Stark to the mixed doubles crown. In fact,
beating Gigi Fernandez and Cyril Suk 6-4, 6-4 in the final gave her only
slightly more trouble than finding a partner for her twenty-third
appearance at the All England Club.
Martina, 39 in October, made her last appearance in the singles a year
ago after winning it nine times. Her efforts to continue in doubles
looked doomed this year when first John McEnroe, then Steffi Graf,
pulled out as prospective partners.
Stark, 24, obliged and they first met on court for their opening match
a week last Thursday.
Now Martina, a previous holder of the mixed title and a winner of the
women's doubles seven times, will decide whether to return next year to
try to equal Billie Jean King's record of 20 titles, although she
insisted: ''I would rather not break it.''

champion, Pete Sampras, became the first player since Bjorn Borg in the
late 1970s to win the greatest prize in tennis three years in
succession.
Sampras may not be the most popular champion, but the manner in which
he humbled a fierce competitor like Becker confirmed his status as a
genuine winner.
This was his sixth Grand Slam triumph and he won it with a performance
which was so potent that at one point Becker pretended to be blind. It
was his way of saying he could not see Sampras's serve, never mind touch
it with his racket.
It was a moment which offered respite from his public suffering, which
his wife, Barbara, seemed to be feeling more than him. Seated directly
behind Sampras' girlfriend Delaina, she spent much of the match with her
head hidden in her hands unable to witness a match in which her man won
only 23 points against the serve of his opponent.
In fact, by the end of the second set Becker had captured only 12
points against serve, outwith the first-set tie-break, which offered the
three-times champion his only success of the afternoon.
Becker and Sampras had played seven tie-breaks before yesterday and
all but one had been controlled by the American, so when the No.3 seed
won the tie-break 7-5, he was entitled to believe that perhaps he did
have a date with destiny.
Throughout these championships Becker had looked totally focused and
his supporters, who are many around these parts, were anxious to believe
their hero would celebrate the tenth anniversary of becoming the
youngest Wimbledon champion by taking the Challenge Cup for the fourth
time in seven final appearances.
But Sampras was lurking, waiting for his own history-making moment and
he took it decisively, beating Becker 6-7 (5-7), 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 in two
hours and 28 minutes.
''I can't explain the feeling right now because it's all still a blur
and I'll probably be wired for a couple more days yet,'' said the
champion. ''It'll be special, though, and I'll take time to reflect on
what I've just done and savour it.
''I also want to go home and have some grease. I've been denying
myself that kind of food, but I'm now going to enjoy a big, greasy
burger.''
As Becker's mum, Elvira, sat in the packed stands weeping while her
husband, Karl Heinz, and daughter, Sabina, were staring off into space,
Boris stood politely to one side while Sampras took the glittering prize
and a cheque for #365,000, which will be added to his career earnings of
#10m.
That should keep him on burgers for a while.
Just before the prize-giving, Sampras stepped right out of character
by taking his shirt off and throwing it into the crowd behind the
umpire's chair. It was a surprising gesture -- and even more remarkable
that no-one threw the shirt back, because his sullen demeanour has not
won him many friends.
Sampras seemed to like the reaction, so he then threw water over some
of the spectators before tossing a towel to them. Was this the emergence
of a personality at last? Perhaps, but what is not in doubt is Sampras's
ability to play tennis, especially on grass.
''I think the people who know the game realise the skill involved in
playing on grass the way I do, but when you are on a Wimbledon court
with someone like Boris, then you know you will not be the crowd's
favourite,'' Sampras added.
''However, I prefer to let my racket do the talking and I won't act
like a jerk out on court. I wasn't brought up that way.''
His racket spoke with a booming voice and his serve was awesome. There
was absolutely nothing Becker could do about it, and by way of stark and
damaging contrast, Becker was broken five times because his own serve,
normally such a mighty weapon, malfunctioned.
He served 16 aces but double-faulted 14 times.
Sampras thundered 23 aces across the net -- he served 107 in his six
matches here -- and was never under any threat of being broken, with
Becker taking him to deuce only once.
Halfway through the fourth set it was obvious Becker realised he had
merely been duped by destiny, and that he was to be no more than a
bit-part player in the final. He didn't even question a poor call which
further undermined his cause in the penultimate game.
''If you remember that I won only 20 points against his serve all day,
and 12 of those were because he double-faulted, you see that I had few
opportunities to hit the ball,'' he said. ''Basically, I was not given a
chance today because of the way Pete played.''
Sampras was simply too strong and too good. He was up for the final
and determined to win the championship for his coach, Tim Gullikson, who
is fighting against brain tumours in an American hospital.
Before the match Sampras said it would be hit-and-miss tennis and so
it was, with the 23-year-old doing the hitting and Becker the missing.
The Lion of Leimen -- ''please, don't call me the old lion, because
I'm only 27'' -- could not have suspected the horrors which were about
to befall him as he slipped into the Centre Court 35 minutes before he
was due to make the walk from the dressing room in earnest.
Becker knew that, to win, he would have to reproduce the form which
had been too much for Andre Agassi in Friday's semi-final, but he left
all his best shots in the locker room and not once yesterday did we see
the strutting Becker, the fighter, the winner.
''No, after the first set I felt my legs were tired, and I need to be
able to push up on my serves. I couldn't,'' he said. ''I lost my power,
but I think the people have appreciated what I've given them over the
last two weeks. Unfortunately, I think the final was just one match too
many for me.
''I used to own the Centre Court, but it belongs to Pete now, and
although the rankings say differently, Pete is the No.1 in the world and
not Andre Agassi. No-one has ever played like that against me in a final
and I just had to stand there watching out for those bombs he was
throwing and hoping for rain.''
Sampras said: ''Boris Becker is a class act. He's a great champion and
I knew I'd have to improve my returns to get to him. After the first
set, I did that and I took my game on to a different level.''
Soon after, it was all over and the two gladiators took their leave.
They hadn't quite produced the drama of the women's final, but Sampras
and Becker played their parts to the full.
I won only 20
points against
his serve and
12 of those
were double
faults

MARTIN Lee and James Trotman staged a magnificent fighting comeback
yesterday to become the first British pair to win the boys' doubles
title.
Unseeded and unsung before the event, Lee and Trotman beat second
seeds Alejandro Hernandez of Mexico, and Mariano Puerta of Argentina,
7-6, 6-4 after having trailed 5-1 in the opening set.
In a storming fightback, the British boys first broke Henandez and
then Puerta to pull back to 5-5 before winning the tie-breaker 7-2.
One break, in the seventh game of the second set, was enough to enable
17-year-old Worthing left-hander Lee and 16-year-old Trotman, from
Ipswich, to to win in 80 minutes.
Both boys are coached by Australian Ian Barclay at the LTA School at
Bisham Abbey. Their triumph will be just reward for his efforts.

POLITICS is such an optimistic business that few politicians can for
long contemplate the abyss, though all recognise its nature in
overwhelming electoral defeat. Today's Tories have certainly noted the
abyss they could easily face at the next General Election: it is the
fate suffered by their candidates in the European and local elections as
well as in all the by- elections these past three years. Yet it is
remarkable how, having come back from the edge with Mr Major only last
week, some Conservatives are already bent on forgetting its existence
and participating in all sorts of damaging speculation about the Prime
Minister's wheeling and dealing with Mr Heseltine, and the latter's
apparent willingness to upset his colleagues in pursuit of personal
power. All of this forces Tories back into self-analysis which can only
have the effect of absorbing their energies and diverting them from the
business of government, re-building their relations with their former
supporters in the press, and even combating Labour.
Mr Heseltine is such an exuberant and even flamboyant personality that
he is bound to rouse some apprehension among his colleagues, and his new
role as Deputy Prime Minister is itself quite unspecific without the
added imprecision of First Secretary. Either title can mean a little or
a lot but both seem a sop to Mr Heseltine's ambitions, a concession to
the romantic streak in his personality, as well as a recognition of his
electoral appeal. If used wisely both by himself and Mr Major, the
promotion can benefit the Government, but no previous Deputy PM has been
able to establish a satisfactory role, and it may be just as well that
the next election is now less than two years away. It is hard to imagine
a new Premier, with the self-confidence endowed by his fresh majority,
creating such a post. A position which gives a man of Mr Heseltine's
mental and imaginative energies great public status but little personal
power may be frustrating and counterproductive. A party no more than a
man can serve two masters and many inside as well outside Tory ranks
will be watching to see how much muscle Mr Heseltine can attach to the
influence he hopes to wield. He may be helped in some ways by Mr Major's
own image of dither and doubt, though surely that ought now to be
qualified by the Prime Minister's role in his own survival. If indeed
deals were done they indicate both determination and calculation, as
well as an element of ruthlessness, with which Mr Major has not always
been associated.
It would be quite easy to identify fissures in any front of policy
which could be advanced to say that the Tories were more united now than
three weeks ago when Mr Major announced his gamble. But in fact one
consideration should dominate all minds -- political survival. Mr
Heseltine has already shown his grasp of this fact in his Gaullist-style
pronouncements on our relations with Europe as requiring a degree of
give and take, ''where they give and we take''. That will not strike
anyone as the sort of statement our leaders should make about our
friends, and it must be considered remarkable coming from a
Euro-enthusiast like Mr Heseltine, but it is the sort of noise sensitive
Europe-sceptics would appreciate, and indicates how willing he is to
court them. He was not willing to go too far down the road to a
referendum (presumably on a single currency) but his defence is the
perfectly respectable one of wishing to leave such judgments to
Parliament.
Some suspect Mr Heseltine might want to bring forward tax cuts faster
than Mr Clarke but really the timetable allows little scope for
manoeuvre for either of them. That might not be the case with interest
rate movements but again Mr Clarke has shown his mettle on this front
(certainly vis-a-vis the Governor of the Bank of England) and movements
in other countries, notably America and Japan, have just strengthened
his hand. There may be no need for the Chancellor and the First
Secretary to disagree about too much.
Mr Heseltine is certainly an exciting figure to whom a jaded party and
Government may look for refreshment, but he is not by himself capable of
delivering the kiss of life. He did, after all, preside over the
precipitate decision to close nearly all the mines in the country in the
early years of this administration. That was a decision which displayed
an unusual degree of insensitivity and a lack of political nous from
which the Government has not, even yet, recovered. He is, however, the
man who most clearly represents the ''One Nation'' thread in Tory
thinking and his advancement seems to confirm Mr Major's alignment with
vision, deals or no deals. The question, whether he can influence
without trying to compel, remains open for the Opposition to try to
exploit.

BRITAIN'S leading motor components manufacturer T&amp;N has suffered a
major and possibly fatal blow to its hopes of acquiring German piston
maker Kolbenschmidt for around #125m.
The German Cartel Office said over the weekend that it is blocking the
T&amp;N move as a successful takeover would give it more than 60% of the
German market for piston rings -- its Goetze subsidiary is already a
significant player in that sector.
This is the second time that T&amp;N has been rejected by the office in
its attempts to complete a deal it started last August involving chiefly
an option to buy a 49.9% stake held by Commerzbank.
The takeover has been strongly opposed by the Kolbenschmidt board but
T&amp;N chairman Colin Hope (pictured right) has repeatedly said that he has
the backing of many of the giants of the German car manufacturing
industry including Mercedes Benz, BMW, and Ford.
T&amp;N has been the most successful British company operating in the
German engineering sector where it has to meet stringent quality control
standards both for local production and UK exports.
However, some in the City may welcome the decision because success
would bring T&amp;N's gearing to more than 90% because a rights issue would
be difficult given the share price of just 181p while cash is drained
out of the company to meet asbestosis liabilities in the US.

Glasgow Development Agency has had a highly successful year, report
Sean Francis and Joan Grady.
NEW jobs, new businesses, new companies moving in and a new look to
the city -- they are all in the latest report from the agency in charge
of Glasgow's economic development published last week. Twelve thousand
jobs were safeguarded or created, either during the year or in the near
future. More than 400 new businesses were started and 16 new inward
investment projects involving 2400 jobs were won.
Among the main strands of the Glasgow Development Agency's work have
been business support and training, helping to bring business to the
city and improving its physical infrastructure. These correspond to what
GDA chief executive Stuart Gulliver described as ''the three pillars of
economic development in the city'' which he identified as ''business
prosperity, people prosperity and place prosperity''. He added:
''Improving the performance and competitiveness of the city requires a
commitment to all three.''
GDA's expenditure of #56.6m in 1994/95, money received from both
Scottish Enterprise and the European Union, actually helped to draw in
nearly three times as much from elsewhere, so that around #200m was
invested in the city during the financial year. ''We have done about
#56m of business this year secured from both Scottish Enterprise and the
European Union with great support from the Strathclyde European
Partnership,'' Mr Gulliver said.
Business support included the opening in March of the Glasgow Business
Shop network, designed to give small businesses a one-stop source of
practical advice and assistance. Glasgow now has six such shops and
another two are expected to open during 1995/96. The Business
Development Service, run through local development companies and
supported by GDA, gave advice, information and counselling to more than
1300 small businesses last year. Funding packages worth #2.8m were
created through the Funding Advisory Service, managed by Glasgow
Opportunities, for another 24 companies, securing 325 jobs.
For advice on organisation, finance and marketing, small businesses
can consult the Better Business Services initiative. Companies can hire
consultants at competitive rates, as GDA contributes to the cost. During
1994/95 more than 500 companies received assistance through Better
Business Services, across a wide range of industries.
''Technology is one of the driving forces of innovation and the growth
in many companies,'' Mr Gulliver said. ''However, it is still an area
where the cost of investment or the cost of just getting into the area
is too high. GDA is looking at a number of areas to help companies adopt
and take part in new technologies.''
The Glasgow Technology programme was set up to help businesses deal
with both types of expense. It contributes to the cost of a
technologist, allowing companies to take on projects they otherwise
could not afford. Other initiatives focus on bringing together
Scotland's universities and research institutions with the technology
industries to make the most of their combined knowledge.
''The city's economy grows in many ways,'' Mr Gulliver explained.
''One of the main ways is by the birth of new companies. Glasgow has
actually had a poor performance in this area compared to other parts of
the country in the last few years.''
One of the most interesting projects in this area is the GDA-funded
Business Ventures Programme. ''This aims to create quality companies
with growth potential, the sort of companies that will grow to
relatively high turnover and employ reasonable numbers of people.''
From the six courses completed within the programme, 24 new businesses
have been set up, five as a result of joint ventures with US and
Canadian companies. These new businesses are expected to create a future
480 jobs.
Efforts to boost Glasgow's economy also include a range of initiatives
designed to get the long-term unemployed back to work. Glasgow Works
provides experience and training to those who have been out of work for
more than 12 months. Sixty per cent of participants are from deprived
areas, 40% are women and almost 40% have been unemployed for more than
two years.
''Early results on the project are encouraging,'' Mr Gulliver said.
''There is a very low turnover which suggests that the ingredients of
the package are appropriate to the people involved. GDA hopes that
Glasgow Works, when evaluated, will lead to some national initiative of
a similar kind.''
Glasgow Skillseekers, a new approach to youth training, took on more
than 2900 young people last year. Youth Training is still in operation
but will decrease as Skillseekers increases. Adult training found work
for 1758 trainees last year. A further 1710 achieved vocational
qualifications and 187 went on to some form of further or higher
education.
Altogether 2000 small firms were helped with specialist advice and
support and more than 13,500 people were in training programmes. In
addition, 750 companies employing 74,000 people were involved in human
resource development initiatives.
''I believe that 1995/95 saw a resurgence in Glasgow's regeneration
after a sluggish period during the recession,'' Mr Gulliver said. ''Next
year we must build on that and keep the momentum going. Glasgow's
businesses must have an environment which meets their needs and
encourages entrepreneurship in every form. This is as true of existing
companies as it is of inward investors.''
The city's attraction was recognised when it won the UK City of
Architecture and Design 1999 award. It was, however, only one of the
more visible achievements during the year. ''Economic development is not
just about winning awards and building 'flagship' projects,'' said
outgoing GDA chairman Forbes Macpherson, whose successor is Michael
Lunn.
''Looking back on this year, I am equally proud of the wide ranging
initiatives undertaken by GDA and its partners ranging from support for
small businesses to training young people with special needs.
Sustainable economic development of a city must try to tap the potential
of all parts of the city, whether that be its businesses, universities
or the long-term unemployed. I am pleased that GDA has been able to
continue that process this year.''

THERE were times late on Friday night when, if you closed your eyes,
the Old Fruitmarket became the Marquee in the 1960s with Graham Bond's
band at full tilt. Times when the absent Jack Bruce could almost be
heard crying, ''they've reformed Tony Williams's Lifetime and forgotten
to invite me''.
Not that John McLaughlin's re-alliance with those bands' common
denominator (aside from himself and Bruce), the Hammond organ, is a
nostalgic exercise. There were too many sparks flying between the trio
for that, too much recently gained knowledge. McLaughlin never has been
a guitarist to stand around, sending out third-hand solos and saying
''that'll do''. He always plays on the edge and drummer Dennis Chambers
particularly seemed to enjoy keeping him there.
A fabulous player, Chambers has the dig of Tony Williams and the
flamboyance of Billy Cobham, but a musical presence that is all his own.
His supercharged playing can be all but overpowering, but on Carla
Bley's Sing Me Softly of the Blues he followed the instructions to the
letter, providing a subtle rhythmical springboard while McLaughlin came
on like some latter day T Bone Walker, and Joey DeFrancesco floated
organ chords that you usually only hear in church on a Sunday morning.
Scrabbling, searching guitar runs have long been McLaughlin's
trademark. But he can score with simplicity, too, and for all his
virtuosity he isn't above playing with basic, pulse-quickening urgency
as on a rock-hard re-examination of Miles Davis's nursery rhyme-ish
Jean-Pierre. Miles's spectre also appeared during DeFrancesco's
trumpet/organ one-man-duet, an umpromising and self-indulgent sounding
feat, perhaps, but one that proved entirely musical.

IT's a muggy day in Glasgow town and thanks to the marching season it
is difficult enough to navigate across town even if you are not a
visiting Puerto Rican. But nothing could disturb the cool of this young
saxophonist, out of Dizzy Gillespie's United Nation Orchestra with a
Sony record deal, and a Bobby Watson-produced album, Sketches of Dreams.
If it is histrionic passion you are looking for, you won't get it from
Sanchez and his cohorts -- these boys barely break sweat. Not that
things were in any sense lazy, the saxophonist tearing into the opener
full pelt. Later, he built a solo from two well-spaced repeating notes
step-by-step into a Coltranesque torrent -- but the style of that
build-up seemed almost too studied.
What remains in the mind about this young band is the spare style of
much of their performance, exposing a real rhythmic interest. No
freneticism a la Sandoval, but a Latin awareness -- unsurprisingly --
underpinning everything. After every bop theme was played and explored,
they stripped the number down -- whether an original or one by Monk --
and there was that beat lurking underneath. Drummer Clarence Penn should
take much of the credit for following his leader on this one -- stroking
rather than thumping the kit, he played one of the most musical solos
I've heard this week.
Sanchez's own soloing eschewed any Latin colour, being rooted firmly
in the well-trodden ground of gospel and blues, and harmonically on the
conventional side. In fact pianist Bruce Mehldan rather stole the
honours on the ballad, Rogers and Hart's Easy To Remember. Still, it is
the charm, cool, and good looks of Sanchez that will get this band
noticed.

PAGE 27 of the Glasgow International Jazz Festival brochure promises:
''Have we got trumpets for you,'' -- a promise that certainly has been
kept. But it was good, after the previous two evenings' experiences, to
sit down on Saturday and listen to two trumpeters who don't believe that
by playing as high and as fast as possible they are creating music.
Guy Barker took the opportunity in the early evening spot to promote
his Verve Records debut, Into the Blue, from which came all the tunes.
And smashing tunes they were, too, ranging from the tightly articulated
hard bop of Sheldon the Cat through to Oh Mr Rex!'s gorgeous creole
moan.
His international quintet sounded tense but this added an edge to the
playing which worked in their favour because when they relaxed for the
lovely Low Down Lullaby (gleaned from a Shirley Temple film), the
audience all but cuddled them.
Roy Hargrove's sextet received a similarly enthusiastic response --
with good reason. Here was a band so obviously concentrating on the
sounds of its instruments and listening to each other intently to
produce a level of interplay and collective sense of dynamics that were
simply stunning.
To hear a bunch of young New Yorkers playing tunes which must make
them as cool to their peers as Clarks sandals, was faintly bizarre. Yet
there was no doubting their knowledge or sincerity, and if Hargrove's
singing on the encore, September in the Rain, fell into the endearingly
sweet rather than the knock 'em dead category, its setting was just
further proof of the graft and imagination expended in reaching this
standard.

CUBE Housing Association is part of a large voluntary housing movement
in Scotland. Currently there are 200 associations and co-operatives
providing some 70,000 homes. Each association is run by a committee of
volunteers, whose main aim is to help provide accommodation for those
who have the most acute needs. Committee members are accountable to
their tenants, the local community and to their members.
Cube Housing Association is run by a management committee chaired by
John Russell, a senior social worker with Strathclyde Region. According
to project services manager Sheila Hannon, this mix of tenants and
professionals provides, ''a wide range of expertise to call on in its
role as social landlord and service provider.''
Cube owns 2600 properties, the bulk of which were acquired from
Scottish Homes, the Government body which provides funding to housing
associations and with which it is registered. All of these properties
are, she said, in good condition. ''Although any improvements to them
would have to be funded by us. The bulk of any funding for new building
or improvement projects we undertake would come from Scottish Homes.
''We obtained 75% of the funding for our new building project at
Gartloch Road from Scottish Homes in the form of a housing association
grant. We also obtained funding from the Glasgow Development Agency,
while the balance was made up by raising private finance.
Care services are also being expanded, and the house which Cube has
designed for five young adults with learning difficulties in Dunoon
includes barrier-free thresholds and doors, as well as paths with
minimum gradients and car access close to the entrance. ''The idea is to
create a domestic setting that is not too institutional,'' Ms Hannon
explained.
Housing associations and co-operatives in Scotland are represented by
the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, and Cube is one of its
largest members.
The SFHA has been providing representation, policy and training
services for its members for the last 20 years and during that time has
witnessed many changes. Most housing associations started in Scotland's
inner cities in the late seventies, typically carrying out
rehabilitation work to traditional tenements. Since then, the voluntary
housing movement has grown apace, with the transfer of local authority
and Scottish Homes housing to new and existing associations.
Organisations such as Cube, with its 2000 ex-Scottish Homes houses, has
been at the heart of these recent developments.
While the SFHA and its members can be proud of their track record,
many challenges lie ahead. The key one is the maintenance of funding
available to housing associations and co-operatives, both from Scottish
Homes and the private sector.
Cube is a primary example of the type of professional, flexible
organisation which characterises housing associations and clearly shows
the way in which associations can be aware of new housing needs and
support each other through sharing experience and resources to the
benefit of individuals and local communities.

THE prestigious housing development opened recently by Sir James
Mellon, chairperson of Scottish Homes, at Gartloch Road, Ruchazie, marks
the completion of a further innovative housing development.
The development provides 49 new homes including 24 sheltered homes for
the elderly, 10 amenity flats, a warden's house, two for the disabled
and 12 high-quality properties for sale on a shared-ownership basis. All
of them are spoken for already.
The shared-ownership properties consist of six two-apartment flats and
six three-apartment terraced houses. This scheme allows people to
purchase a share of up to 75% and rent the remainder from the
association. They are realistically priced at between #30,000 and
#41,000 to encourage the first-time buyer.
All the homes have double-glazing, fully fitted kitchens with
attractive tiling, full white meter central heating and high-quality
insulation, while all the flats have fully controlled door entry
systems.
The aim of the Gartloch Road development is to create a mixed
community, providing housing for rent and low-cost ownership to
accommodate households ranging from young families to elderly people,
some of whom require support. As well as ensuring a mix of residents,
the introduction of shared ownership will increase the opportunities for
low-cost ownership in the greater Easterhouse area. Property is
available to local residents and first-time buyers and a competitive
mortgage package has been arranged with Abbey National.
The development includes an innovative care in the community project,
providing supported accommodation for the elderly. This has been
developed to provide various care packages and services enabling
individuals to live as independent a life as possible and to make a
reality of care in the community. Care ranges from full-time warden
support to special adaptations for those with disabilities, while
individual care packages have been agreed with Strathclyde Regional
Council for residents who require additional support apart from that
provided by the wardens.
Acquiring the site, originally a playing field owned by Glasgow
District Council, proved to be a complex process. However, with the help
of Scottish Homes, the Glasgow Development Agency and Glasgow District
Council, the difficulties were overcome and funding was provided.
The site lies on the perimeter of the greater Easterhouse area and was
transferred to Cube in 1993. It developed outline designs originally
drawn up by the Scottish Special Housing Association prior to its
transfer to Cube.
The bulk of the funding for the #2.6m project came from Scottish
Homes, while the GDA, the Royal Bank of Scotland and sales receipts from
shared-ownership properties accounted for the remainder. Work started on
site in 1993 and was completed last month. All the homes are covered by
NHBC guarantee, while a high standard of landscaping ensures adequate
screening from the nearby M8.
Design proposals were developed by Cube and Anderson Christie
Architects of Paisley, in close consultation with Glasgow District
Council and the local community, and the homes were built by JB Bennett
(Contractors) Ltd of Banton, by Kilsyth.

THE rift between the Labour Party and its largest affiliate, the
Transport and General Workers' union, looks set to become a yawning
chasm this week.
On the eve of the opening session of the TGWU biennial conference in
Blackpool, which is due to be addressed by Labour leader Tony Blair this
afternoon, it became clear the union was poised to:
* Demand an end to his declared aim of ''continuous'' modernisation of
the party and its links with the unions;
* Oppose any move to reduce union voting strength at party conference
below 50%;
* Halve its affiliation and therefore affiliation fees to the party
over the next two years;
* Reaffirm its insistence on a statutory national minimum wage set at
#4 an hour.
TGWU general secretary Bill Morris said last night he was
''delighted'' that Mr Blair would be addressing the conference and
stressed that the TGWU would be in the front line of the fight for a
Labour victory at the next General Election.
However, he suggested that continual discussion and reappraisal of the
party's constitution would not help that election bid. The electorate
was waiting for policies not constitutional change.
Links between the party and the unions needed to be settled once and
for all on a basis of ''equality, fairness, and mutual respect''.
His union, which clashed with the Labour leadership over the
introduction of one-member-one-vote for the election of party leader and
the watering down on the Clause Four commitment to nationalisation, was
opposed to any reduction in union influence in party policy-making below
50%.
The unions' combined voting strength at the party conference is due to
move towards 50% as individual party membership increases.
Some unions fear that Labour's modernising tendency will seek to
introduce 50% from this October with a sliding scale allowing further
reduction in the union vote as individual membership, already more than
300,000, increases.
Mr Morris took pains to stress that it was his union in the person of
former deputy general secretary Mr Alex Kitson that first proposed
boosting the constituency party vote at annual conference 10 years ago.
He said he thought it appropriate that, in line with the ''Kitson
proposals'', local parties could be given a greater say. Fifty percent
would be ''fair and just'' and could lead to a lasting settlement of the
issue.
However, he did not believe that unions should become a minority in
the party as that would undermine its federal nature.
A special executive statement to conference spells out how Labour's
ongoing modernisation programme is causing ''a high degree of concern''.
There was a perception that in some quarters there was a desire to end
the federal nature by progressively weakening all forms of collective
trade union influence.
Mr Blair's office suggested he would arrive in Blackpoool today in
combative mood and would make no apologies for forging a new
relationship with the unions and stress the need to carry on
modernising.
He would also state categorically that it would be a Labour Government
not the unions that would set the rate for a national minimum wage --
with the co-operation of both employers and unions, otherwise it would
end in disaster.

IN a week short of big name companies, two stand out although both
unlikely to provide a significant degree of market reaction, writes
ANDREW WILSON.
This morning, the buns to guns Tomkins conglomerate is widely expected
to produce an increase of about 17% in pre-tax profits to around #300m
with there being a #5m variance either way among analysts.
Attention will continue to concentrate on the RHM milling and baking
operations and the success of the specialty foods side such as sauces
and mixes rather than on the industrial activities where the state of
the US housing market is of significant importance.
There is some speculation that there could be pressure on Tomkins to
make an acquisition to maintain the unbroken earnings progression since
Greg Hutchings took over.
On Thursday, the grand old daddy of the retail industry Great
Universal Stores should raise profits by about 8% to #560m. High Street
activity will have been slower in the second half. But the City will be
more interested in whether GUS intends doing something dramatic with its
substantial cash resources af anything up to #1400m. The dividend total
could go up 2p to 15p.
Today sees two Scottish companies' half-timers. Low &amp; Bonar will be
examined to see how effectively it has been able to cope with rising raw
material prices and itsb ability to pass these on. There should be a
profits advance of about #2.5m to #23m and the Dundee-based company may
increase the interim dividend by 0.4p to 3.6p.
In this hot summer, Irn-Bru and Tizer as well as the relatively
recently acquired Orangina franchise will have boosted volume at A G
Barr, But again packaging costs could have been a problem.

MARINE equipment suppliers, high energy physics and film production
were just some of the wide range of sectors to benefit from GDA support
during the year. A survey of clients showed that an additional #16.5m of
exports is expected over the next three years.
One of the major successes was the Japanese Ship Supply Project, which
introduced Scottish marine equipment supply firms to the Japanese
market. Last November 16 Scottish marine equipment firms were invited to
meet 24 senior decision makers from Japanese ship building companies.
Four of the firms have secured trade links with Japan and a further 11
expect to gain future business.
To strengthen this link GDA, with Scottish Trade International,
compiled the Scottish Marine Equipment Directory. This lists more than
100 Scottish firms able to supply the Japanese market. It has already
been distributed to Japan's leading ship builders and marine equipment
manufacturers.
Such was the success of the project that the Department of Trade and
Industry asked GDA to host a second three-day event for six key
representatives of the Japanese External Trade Organisation.
International meetings and conferences bring further investment into
the city and GDA has been working with Greater Glasgow Tourist Board to
encourage more of them. In 1994/95 more than 7000 international
delegates attended 18 conferences. Last July the High Energy Physics
Conference attracted more than 1200 delegates. This conference alone
resulted in almost #1m being injected into the city's economy.
Next year GDA will assist 14 conferences which already have more than
20,000 delegates wanting to attend. It has also won the Rotary
International Convention for 1997 which on its own will bring 25,000
delegates and potential investors into the city.
Another success for GDA and Scottish exporters was achieved through
the EuroGateway project. This venture, designed to help Scottish
exporters make the most of opportunities created by unified European
trade conditions, has generated an additional #5.4m of exports.
Attracting new business into the city plays a major part in sustaining
its economy. GDA works with Glasgow City Council, Locate In Scotland and
the local business community to further enhance Glasgow's reputation as
a premier business location. The past year has seen 16 new businesses
brought in, which are expected to create 2400 jobs. The financial sector
has been heavily targeted, especially those companies offering services
over the phone from call centres.
GDA targeted 60 major call centre operators to attract them to
Glasgow. As a result, TSB is bringing its second PhoneBank operation to
Atlantic Quay, creating 950 new jobs. Abbey National has also decided to
site its call centre operation in Glasgow, as did the BBC and National
Australia House.
The principal resource of these and other industries is their people
and GDA has been involved in human resource development initiatives
which marry human resource and business strategy. Last year 750 Glasgow
companies took part in them. GDA itself won Investors In People (IIP)
status, the national standard for effective employment of people. This
provides a framework for companies to make sure staff training and
development ties in with business objectives and performance.
In Glasgow, 15 companies won IIP status last year, including
Strathclyde Police -- the first British force to do so. A further 122
city companies, employing a total of 55,000 people, are committed to
achieving it.
To help those making the transition from education to working life the
Glasgow Education Business Partnership was formed by GDA, Strathclyde
Region Education Department and the business community. The partnership
offers young people a chance to see how business and industry operate
through work experience, mock interviews and awareness days. More than
1500 employers and 16,000 students have become involved in education
business activities.
In March a one-day seminar focused on forging productive links between
Glasgow's further education sector and local development companies. The
aim was to heighten awareness of self-employment opportunities for those
in further education.
Perhaps the most unusual project was the Glasgow Film Fund, developed
by GDA, Strathclyde Regional Council, Glasgow City Council, Strathclyde
European Partnership and the Scottish Film Production Fund. Its
objective is to develop the city's media sector by helping local firms
break into the feature film market and attracting outside movie makers
to the city.
The first project funded by the GFF was Shallow Grave, one of the most
talked about films of the year. Aside from its critical and commercial
acclaim, it generated #500,000 for Glasgow's economy through demand for
goods and services, and a share of the profits will return to the fund.
Its title might have been Shallow Grave but it helped to show yet
another Glasgow industry is alive and kicking.

<HEADLINE>TRN deal would make Trinity biggest UK regional publisher</HEADLINE>

IF THERE is one word that City analysts use to describe Trinity
International it is 'acquisitive,' and there will be few surprises that
the firm is reportedly close to signing a #280m deal for most of Thomson
Regional Newspapers (TRN).
Trinity, which already runs a well-stocked stable of UK, US, and
Canadian titles, saw pre-tax profits rise by 15% last year. At the time
experts said in order to attract fresh investors Trinity would need to
push itself through the #250m market value threshhold and would probably
need an acquisition to do that.
If the reported TRN deal goes ahead Trinity will become the biggest
regional publisher in the UK. They are presently sixth on the list.
While the newspaper world was abuzz at reports of the possible
takeover yesterday, staff at the Trinity's Chester headquarters were
remaining tight-lipped about any possible plans.
The reported deal is well in keeping with Trinity's philosophy of
expanding and strengthening its regional newspaper business. During the
past three years it has been one of the fastest expanding regional
newspaper groups in the UK.
It already has an estimated 59 paid-for and 31 free titles with a
total circulation of 3.57m copies per week. The group's centrepiece is
the Liverpool Post and the Echo, but it also owns the North Wales
Independent Press and Scottish and Universal, among others, giving it a
string of titles from Tayside and Anglesey to Vancouver and Pittsburgh.
It has a reputation for production efficiency and the ability to drive
costs down after an acquisition.
Trinity have been on a major shopping spree since 1987. In 1989 the
paper-making and packaging side of the business was lopped off to
concentrate on newspaper publishing.
In 1992 it paid Lonhro #45m for Scottish and Universal Newspapers,
which owns a variety of paid-for and free titles in Central and Southern
Scotland with a combined weekly circulation of around 600,000 a week.
Earlier this year, S&amp;UN announced it would be investing #9.5m to
centralise its new printing operations at a new plant in Lanarkshire and
described the development as a ''tremendous vote of confidence'' by
Trinity.
In 1993, Trinity spent #36.7m on three new purchases; Blackmore Vale
which they bought in April for #1.2m, then Huddersfield Newspapers
acquired in November for #12.36m, and finally, they paid out #23m for
the floundering Argus press in the south of England.
In 1993 the company notched up its best peformance to date with
pre-tax profits up by 32%. A year later officials said the vast majority
of Trinity's titles in the UK had not been affected by the national
newspaper price war. The Daily Post in Liverpool did drop about 5% of
its circulation, but Trinity said they expected it to be a one-off and
the overall effect of the price-cutting to be small.
It was only two years ago that the group announced plans to do away
with its old-fashioned 89-year-old share structure. The system,
introduced in 1904 when it floated as the Liverpool Daily Post and Echo,
involved just 12 shares with full voting rights held by directors, and
was designed to protect the then Liberal-supporting newspaper group from
hostile takeover by Conservatives.
Trinity lost one of it its main shareholders earlier the same year
when Conrad Black, the Canadian publisher of the Daily Telegraph, sold a
10% stake he had bought in 1989 in the hope of building a long-term
relationship.
It is understood that he was seen as a potential predator and had
overtures for a seat on the board and enfranchisement of Trinity's
shares rebuffed.
It is somewhat ironic that the Scotsman and the Evening News have
apparently been left out of this week's reported TRN deal. Two years
ago, Trinity denied rumours that it was interested in buying the
Scotsman and that it had made an approach to TRN. At the time Trinity
officials said they had enough on their plates absorbing their recent
purchases.
Most recently, the group started to position themselves for
development into non-print areas and they already have advanced
discussions with potential partners in Cable TV.
In last year's annual report, Trinity chief executive Philip Graf said
they were in a sound position.
''Our strategy is to grow the company through developing our existing
franchises and investing in new titles and products,'' he said.
''We also continue to seek sensibly priced acquisition opportunities.
We have a strong position in UK regional newspapers and are well
positioned both financially and in management terms to grow further.''

PULPY kidney disease and lamb dysentry are both diseases which are
well known, at least by name, to every sheep farmer. Both are associated
with strains of Clostridium perfringens whose spores are common in soil
everywhere and which will survive for years in the environment.
Diseases which we can now recognise as pulpy kidney disease and lamb
dysentry were described by James Hogg, the Ettrick shepherd, in the
early years of the nineteenth century, and have probably existed for
centuries prior to that.
Effective vaccines were developed during the 1950s and 1960s and have
been improved since then and gradually became a routine component of
virtually every sheep-farming enterprise so that outbreaks have been
rare events in recent years.
Many shepherds under 40 years of age will never have seen a case of
either disease. Veterinary investigation centres in England and Wales
and veterinary services centres in Scotland have, for many years,
reported only sporadic cases and occasional outbreaks.
The number of cases reported by veterinary laboratories in 1995 is
almost double the 1994 figures. Although the number of diagnosed cases
has varied from year to year, with unpredictable peaks and troughs, this
increase appears to be genuine and dramatic. Investigations have
demonstrated four factors to have operated this year.
For a number of reasons, there were interruptions to the supply of
vaccines in late 1994 and early 1995. Many farmers reported being unable
to obtain supplies from their usual retailers, or delays of several
weeks before receiving delivery.
In some cases, this meant that the pre-lambing booster could not be
given to pregnant ewes. This dose is essential to stimulate the ewe's
immunity just prior to lambing, so that a high level of antibody is
present in colostrum after lambing.
Such antibody is absorbed by young lambs and gives them protection
against clostridial disease for up to three months after birth. Ewes
which are not boosted would provide minimal protection to their lambs.
From the point of view of giving maximum protection to lambs, the
booster vaccination is best given about two weeks before lambing.
However, following a scare about adverse reaction to vaccination in
1989, many farmers have tended to give the booster as much as six weeks
before the start of lambing, which could mean at least 12 weeks before
the later ewes lamb.
By this time the benefit of the booster has waned significantly so
that late lambs obtain little protection. Experience of trial work done
by the Scottish Agricultural College Veterinary Services at Ayr suggests
that vaccination nearer to lambing is highly unlikely to produce adverse
reaction.
Initial vaccination of lambs with clostridial vaccines requires two
doses, four to six weeks apart, usually given at approximately three and
four-and-a-half-months of age. Inquiry shows, however, that many hill
farmers administer a single dose to hoggs in autumn prior to
away-wintering, then a second next spring on their return.
Such a programme is well outside the terms of manufacturers'
instructions which are printed on every box of vaccine or on a leaflet
with every bottle. Farmers who use any medicine incorrectly cannot be
surprised when the medicine does not work.
And finally a few farmers have reported that, having vaccinated for
years and never seen either disease, they have saved money by not
bothering to vaccinate this year. The experience of 1995 is that with
such ubiquitous organisms, even stopping for one year can be an
expensive mistake.
In short, the advice to sheep farmers would be to vaccinate sheep
against clostridial diseases, and do it according to the manufacturers'
recommendations.

Sheila Waddell reports on a housing association which is celebrating a
successful first five years and looking towards the future
IN the last five years Cube Housing Association has grown into one of
the largest in Scotland. When it was set up in March 1990, it had only
two staff, today it employs 87, 55 housing and project staff, while 32
are caretakers or wardens.
Project services manager Sheila Hannon explained: ''Unlike most other
housing associations we own a fair number of multi-storey properties in
Glasgow, ranging from 26-storey blocks in Wyndford in Maryhill to
several eight-storey properties in Broomhill. A key feature of security
in these properties is the provision of caretakers.''
Cube's main aims are to provide a range of good quality affordable
housing for local communities linked to people's needs. In addition, it
provides services to other housing associations and co-operatives, to
help them meet the needs of their clients. ''We help other associations
by providing expertise in areas such as development and project
management,'' Ms Hannon said. ''In Stirlingshire, for example, we are
working with Rural Stirling Association to help build housing for rent
and low cost home ownership in rural areas.
''We are also working with 10 other housing associations, including
Ferguslie Park in Paisley, where a lot of existing homes have been
demolished and a member of our staff is working with them to help build
new homes. In Motherwell we are providing financial advice to help
Forgewood Housing Co-operative deal with its financial affairs and
enable it to obtain capital funding for projects, while financial advice
is also being given to Glen Oaks Housing Association in Darnley to help
improve existing housing and build new homes.''
The name Cube comes from Garscube Road in Glasgow, where the
association was created. The major impetus for its development came,
according to Ms Hannon, because there was a training and servicing need
for an organisation to assist with the creation of new associations both
in the peripheral estates of the West of Scotland and in other areas
such as Glasgow. It was also felt a new organisation would be able to
respond positively to the changing role for housing associations and to
develop new initiatives such as Care in the Community.
Over the last five years Cube has spent #13m developing and improving
properties in the West of Scotland. These include the Clydeview project
in Clydebank which involved the partial demolition and refurbishment of
flat-roofed terraced flats. Wings along the sides of the buildings were
demolished and pitched roofs put on the properties. Work on the 109
homes is now complete and the finishing touches are being put to
environmental work.
Extensive street-scaping has also been carried out. This involved
improving road lay-outs, providing landscaped areas and generally
upgrading the local environment. ''In this project we used Landwise, the
training and employment organisation to carry out the soft
landscaping,'' Ms Hannon explained. ''This involved the use of trainees
supervised by Landwise who were previously employed and placed on the
training scheme as part of the Wise Group's Glasgow training programme
which provides direct paid work experience and training to unemployed
young people for one year.''
At Bencloich in Lennoxtown #1.5m was spent improving homes previously
owned by Strathkelvin District Council. ''Existing tenants were actively
involved in the improvement plans,'' she stressed. ''They liaised with
the architects and our development staff to work out how the existing
homes would be modernised, while some new housing was also built.''
In Lennoxtown three-storey tenements were reduced to two storeys and
the facades were thermally rendered to boost insulation, protect the
building and improve its overall image. After a competition involving
local school children, the development was renamed Highpark.
Cube has also just completed its first mixed development new build
project at Gartloch Road in Ruchazie, where two of the homes have been
designed for wheelchair users, a further 36 for the elderly and 12 for
low cost home ownership. ''We plan to further increase our housing stock
and are looking at potential developments in Glasgow and surrounding
districts such as Strathkelvin, Clydebank and Argyll,'' she said.
''Over the last five years we have worked with 25 housing and tenant
organisations and helped set up 12 new housing associations. We plan to
expand our agency services to other housing and tenant groups and also
to expand our care services. We are currently developing in Dunoon,
shared housing for five young adults with learning difficulties. The
idea is that Cube will build the house, while Enable Scotland will
employ specialist care staff. The project is at the design stage, but we
hope to start work early next year and complete building work by August
or September.''

Hamburg, Sunday -- Leading German politicians and car makers have held
secret meetings to discuss how to make the country's car industry more
competitive, the newspaper Bild am Sonntag reported.
It said the carmakers had won pledges from politicans to fight calls
for stricter speed limits and proposals for higher energy taxes and to
find ways to curb growth in wages.
Those at the meetings have included the chief executives of Bayerische
Motoren Werke, Volkswagen, and Mercedes Benz -- respectively Bernd
Pischetsrieder, Ferdinand Piech, and Helmut Werner. Other industry
officials who have attended some of the meetings include Hans Merkle,
former supervisory board chairman of car parts supplier Bosch.
The meetings have come amid severe cost pressures for the German car
industry due to the strength of the mark, raising the cost of German
exports, and also recent wage pacts that were above industry
expectations.
Mr Pischetsrieder told the group that production costs for the BMW 3
and 5 series vehicles could be cut by up to 45% at the company's Rover
operations in Britain compared to the cost of doing business in Germany,
Bild am Sonntag said.
Politicans from the states in which the carmakers hve operations told
the group that efforts must be made to cut costs, according to the
newspaper. --

A DEVELOPMENT in the treatment of lung cancer could provide improved
survival rates for thousands who have contracted the disease, it was
revealed yesterday.
The Cancer Research Campaign announced the results of a five-year
study involving a new form of intensive radiotherapy. The study, carried
out jointly with the Medical Research Council and the Department of
Health, found that the one-year survival rate of lung cancer patients
given the new treatment jumped by 10% to around 60% while the two-year
survival rate rose from 20% to 30%.
The treatment involves blasting tumours in intensive and continuous
doses three times a day over a 12-day period rather than the usual
six-week radiotherapy course with breaks at the weekend. According to
the organisation, trials in eight centres, including Glasgow, showed
remarkable results in cancers previously resistant to conventional
radiotherapy.
Lung cancer affects 40,000 people in the UK every year and is
relatively high among those living in the West of Scotland.

<HEADLINE>Labour MP calls for inquiry into syringe pumps after sheriff criticises Ayr Hospital. Drug devices linked to 11 deaths</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ELEVEN deaths in hospitals in the past five years have been linked to
the use of drip-feed drug devices, the Department of Health confirmed
yesterday.
Mr George Foulkes, Labour MP for Carrick Cumnock and Doon Valley, is
calling for a an inquiry into the use of the machines and the part they
may have played in the deaths. His call follows a fatal accident
inquiry, which reported on Friday, into the death in August 1993 of Mrs
Catriona Henderson, 34, after a gall-bladder operation at Ayr Hospital.
Sheriff Robin McEwan ruled that Mrs Henderson -- a divorced
mother-of-two from Patna, Ayrshire -- died of brain damage after an
overdose of painkiller administered through a syringe pump.
He found that the syringe had been incorrectly resited into the pump,
allowing an uncontrolled quantity of the painkiller to flow into her.
The inquiry was told that a safety action bulletin which prescribed
safe procedures when using that type of pump was seen by only five
people at Ayr Hospital, and had not been seen by nursing staff.
The sheriff said the hospital had not taken reasonable precautions to
set up a proper system for circulating safety action bulletins and
drawing them to the attention of nurses.
The Scottish Office had recently issued a document on procedures to
ensure staff were properly trained to use syringe pumps, and the Medical
Devices Agency had also issued a document dealing with their
specifications, a Department of Health spokesman said.
''We are keeping a watchful eye on the situation, and are monitoring
whether people are happy they are being properly used,'' he said.
''But to put it in context there are tens of thousands of these
devices -- one manufacturer alone has made 30,000.
''They have been used in the health service for a number of years, and
will continue to be used because they are a vital piece of equipment.''
However, Mr Foulkes, the MP for Mrs Henderson's family, is to write to
Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell and Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth
about the devices.
''I think there is a need for a group of people at top level who
understand the use of these devices to look at their implementation, and
make recommendations for standardisation, training, and other aspects of
their use,'' said Mr Foulkes.
He added that the problem appeared to be not with the devices
themselves but in their variety and increasing use.
''Some of them would only have been used by anaesthetists in operating
theatres at one time, but now they are being used in wards,'' he said.
''We really need a systematic inquiry to see why these deaths have
occurred, and make sure this kind of tragedy does not recur.
''I think it is unacceptable for someone to go into hospital for a
minor ailment and a relatively minor operation and to face bigger
dangers from the equipment than they face in the outside world'', he
added.

NATIONAL &amp; Provincial will announce this morning that it has chosen
Abbey National as the most suitable suitor from the five hopefuls
seeking to acquire Britain's ninth largest building society.
However, it seems that Abbey's chief executive, Peter Birch, has had
to raise the terms by around #200m to #1300m to win the hearts and minds
of the N&amp;P board.
Society members should be in line for a reasonable cash sum of perhaps
#800 or so for each qualifying account.
Lloyds Bank is thought to have offered #100m more but was turned down
as there were fears among the N&amp;P board that it would rationalise the
staff levels and integrate many branches with those of the Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester Building Society, which it has formally taken over for
#1800m.
Abbey will have given assurances about future staff levels and a less
severe branch pruning programme than Lloyds to have won the acceptance
even if the N&amp;P name will completely disappear. As part of the
arrangements, N&amp;P chief executive Alastair Lyons will join the Abbey
board.
N&amp;P was pledged to make a decision and recommendation by the end of
this month ever since Abbey went above the board and made its approach
public. That caused intense irritation at first but ruffled feathers
have since been smoothed down.
The Abbey move in April has been interpreted as being born of
frustration that the N&amp;P board would not enter into meaningful bid
discussions. So pressure hade to be brought to bear by making its
intentions public.
All the suitors had to sign a confidentiality agreement -- in addition
to Abbey and Lloyds, National Australia Bank which owns the Clydesdale
and Yorkshire Banks, and also the Nationwide and Alliance &amp; Leicester
building socities were in the running.
There is speculation that the two building societies will soon enter
into their own initial merger discussions as part of what now seems an
inevitable process that may concentrate the building society movement
into less than six major players with maybe up to 20 smaller societies,
catering in some cases for specific local requirements.
Abbey is in the offer stage of the #285m recommended takeover of the
First National Finance Corporation consumer finance company. Success
with both that and N&amp;P should satisfy its expansionist ambitions for
some time.
* BUSINESS confidence among firms in the financial services sector has
stopped rising for the first time since Black Wednesday, when Britain
was thrown out of the ERM, a survey showed today.
The growth in optimism in financial services has been slowing since
the end of 1993.
But a further slippage in the last three months has ended a run of 10
successive quarters of improvement, according to the survey, by the
Confederation of British Industry and accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand.

* * The Government is likely to face questions in the Commons later
this week about claims that Ministers kept the public in the dark over
the dangers of listeria, a food-poisoning bacteria.
Labour's Shadow Health Secretary Margaret Beckett said she was ''very
concerned'' about a report in a Sunday newspaper which claimed that 26
babies died and more suffered serious injury while Whitehall
prevaricated between 1987 and 1989.
The then Health Secretary Virginia Bottomley and former Agriculture
Minister Gillian Shephard were singled out as having signed public
interest immunity certificates suppressing documents revealing the delay
when families of victims sought legal redress.
But a judge rejected the ''gagging orders'' and the documents had now
been shown to the press.
An article published in the Sunday Times yesterday claimed that the
documents revealed civil servants at the two departments knew that soft
cheeses, cook-chill foods, chickens and pates were likely to carry
listeria which causes miscarriages, stillbirths, and serious illnesses.
But no public warnings were issued until 1989 -- two years after they
became aware of the danger and four years after the first warnings in
the US.
Labour MP Alf Morris, a Junior Health Minister in the 1970s, called
for an urgent statement on the matter from the Prime Minister.
He said: ''This is especially urgent as it is now established that the
Government was fully aware of the risks of stillbirths and serious
congenital injuries long before it alerted the public in 1989.''

CITY fund managers are less optimistic about prospects for the economy
than they were a month ago, according to survey results published today.
The percentage expecting an improvement in the general economic
situation in the next 12 months has slipped to 48% from 57% in June.
Despite interest rate cuts last week in the United States and Japan,
the managers -- who invest on behalf of institutions such as insurance
companies and pension funds -- are more pessimistic about UK rates.
The current base rate is 6.75% and in June the avergae forecast for a
year ahead was 7%. It has risen to 7.2% in the latest monthly survey
conducted by Gallup for stockbroker Smith New Court.
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke uses interest rates to keep inflation under
control, the Government's prime economic target.

MODERN methods of growing and harvesting potatoes are reaping a sad
reward.
It is estimated that 200,000 tubers per hectare remain unlifted in
potato fields -- enough to grow a good proportion of another crop.
But these potential crop producers are growing in the wrong place.
Technically, they are called ''volunteers'', but to an arable farmer
they are weeds that get in the way of other crop production.
Stewart Wale, the Scottish Agricultural College's authority on
potatoes, said: ''This is a worldwide problem and it has a serious
effect on the value of potential certified seed potato crops, as well as
causing hazards in other arable crops, where the growth of these
left-over potatoes disrupts harvesting.''
It is understood that the Potato Marketing Board is treating the
volunteer problem as a priority.
Potatoes being used as a set-aside ''crop' pose special problems,
especially where it is unlikely that over-wintering volunteers can be
subjected to soil temperatures far enough below freezing to kill them
off.
The Scottish Seed Potato Development Council is also concerned about
the problem and how it will affect the certified status of crops which
are a valuable part of arable farmers' incomes.
Bob Nicholls, technical manager of an agro-chemical company which
promotes a new control product, said: ''Potato volunteers are now major
weed status in intensive arable rotations and are a threat to following
potato crops in the rotation. They are real acne on the face of arable
cropping.
''With intensification and modernisation of growing and harvesting of
potatoes the problems for growers will worsen. Even berry-sized seeds
pose hazards in disease carry-over.''

OF ALL the things that Mr Major has said and done since his leadership
victory, one phrase sticks out. ''The next General Election beckons,''
he told his reconstruction rally. It is a powerful word, ''beckons'';
The Grim Reaper uses it constantly.
When the Tory party and the media have completed their post-mortems,
some sullen and resentful, others vainglorious, all will acknowledge Mr
Major's observation and its corollary. The next General Election
beckons, and unless The Reaper takes a hand, Mr Major will lead the
Tories into it.
If this does not unite the Tories, nothing can. They have to make do
with the Prime Minister they have got and the Cabinet that he has
constructed. Magnanimity has not entered the soul of this much-maligned
man as his critics (from Mr Redwood downwards) have discovered.
Instead, loyalty has been rewarded. Who can blame him for that? To the
victor, the spoils. It is true that the chief of these spoils is party
unity and that genuine reconciliation requires forgiveness, even in
politics. But this will take time. Perhaps this time next year will be
the occasion for magnanimity and Mr Redwood can come back into
government as Mr Douglas Hurd, now serving out his time as a back
bencher, expects.
The debate about Europe will continue but the Prime Minister requires
that his leadership endorsement changes the tone of it. He wants to be
able to exploit Redwood's campaign slogan No Change (of leader), No
Chance (of General Election victory).
How happy he would be to say: there has been change, now there's a
chance.
In the meantime, everybody in government is going to listen to
everybody. Mr Forsyth is going to listen to Scots across the board; Mr
Major is going to listen to the party activists; the Cabinet is going to
listen to Mr Heseltine; and Mr Heseltine is going to listen to Tory back
benchers. It is just possible now that the back benchers will listen to
their leader. It sounds like a massive self-counselling exercise.
The grating stridency and back-stabbing of the past two years or so is
to be abandoned by the party, if not the anti-Tory Tory press. And, even
in this latter regard, Ministers are not allowing themselves to be
provoked by what they see as continuing mischief-making by the media.
The new Party Chairman, Mr Brian Mawhinney, and Mr Heseltine, the Deputy
Prime Minister himself, were models of quiet restraint on the airwaves
yesterday.
In fact Mr Heseltine's modesty was almost unctuous bearing in mind
that quite a few of the victor's spoils have fallen into his lap. He is
there to serve his Cabinet colleagues, help them to decisions
collectively taken. Was he offered Ken Clarke's job at the Treasury? --
heaven forfend. Clarke is doing an excellent job. The mere thought of
such a prospect (and it was not discussed) would have appalled him.
No, no, we have got it all wrong. He is not going to throw his weight
about from his tennis-court-sized new quarters in the Cabinet Office.
That would be fatal. Doors would close on him throughout Whitehall. We
should understand that he is there to assist good government, not take
it over.
On the other hand, he's been around in government off and on since
1970 and he knows how to make things happen. He didn't actually say it,
but nobody ever accused Willie Whitelaw of throwing his weight around
when he was making things happen (or not happen) for Margaret Thatcher.
Hezza seemed to have been genuinely alarmed at the reports of his new
powers as Major's Chief Executive.
There is going to be a determined effort to put an end to the damaging
series of leaks at Cabinet level that have plagued the Government.
Heseltine augured this yesterday on BBC television when he declared that
no-one will ever hear from his lips of the discussions he has with his
colleagues.
He is not going to use leaking as a means to outmanoeuvre others in
policy debate. And as Mr Heseltine will be having discussions with
Ministers on just about everything, he expects his colleagues to abandon
leaking as a weapon too. So leakers beware; and double check that the
microphones are switched off when they are supposed to be.
There seems to be a genuine view that Mr Major's Cabinet is, at least
at the outset, determined to take this last chance of gaining a more
sympathetic electorate. Ruefully, the Redwoodites hail a new era of
harmony in Tory ranks. They have little option but to comply, provided
they are not persecuted.
They were highly impressed by the speed at which the Prime Minister's
propaganda machine went into action to scotch the idea that his 218
votes to Redwood's 89 was not conclusive. They anticipate similar speedy
action if anyone breaks the unity ranks.
This is not to say they intend to be muzzled. Major's critics,
particularly those who have strong beliefs on Europe, will continue to
put their point of view. But it will be quite a while, maybe beyond the
next General Election, before they allow a threatening tone to enter
their voices again. Their self-control is facilitated by the fact that
there are no more serious votes on the European issue in sight.
There is, of course, the press. What to do about that? Mr Major has
allowed himself a few sarcastic remarks about those he regards as a
limited number of fanatics in high places who have taken up against him.
But there are to be no serious recriminations. How could there be when
the press is supposed to be unfettered in its political comments and
attitudes?
His victory last week inclines Ministers to believe that the press has
already been taught a lesson -- that it is not as powerful and
influential as was supposed in some quarters. The advice to dump him was
rejected, the trumpeted anticipation of his departure thwarted.
There is a hope that this experience will be a chastening one; that at
the very least criticism will be confined to the Government's policy,
not its personality; that the press will be less obsessive; that
Ministers will cease to be besieged, despite the imminent Scott report
into their conduct. In this sense too, Mr Major's ''put up or shut up''
may prove to be cathartic in the conduct of the media.
I suppose we all travel in hope towards that beckoning finger.

ONLY six months ago Douglas Hurd was busy rubbishing any suggestion he
might retire. In Brussels he made it clear he would be staying on to
negotiate for Britain at next year's super-summit when the Maastricht
Treaty is revised. Around the same time Malcolm Rifkind came to Brussels
and swept aside suggestions that he was Hurd's heir apparent.
Last week's events, therefore, invite some of us, with our reputation
for journalistic cynicism, to say: ''We told you so.'' If you measure
success by advancement then Malcolm Rifkind is the outstanding Scottish
Tory of the past two decades. He was not born with George Younger's
silver spoon or with Ian Lang's money. His background as the son of
Jewish immigrants might have conditioned him but it surely never eased
his path to one of the great offices of state.
He is not even Oxbridge. At the Foreign Office he will be surrounded
by Oxbridge types hanging on his every word. Hurd, the courtly old
Etonian and Establishment man, felt at home in those surroundings.
Rifkind, the meritocrat will, I suspect, quietly enjoy the novelty.
No-one can question Rifkind's ability. The harshest, possibly
justified, criticism of him that I have noticed came some time ago in
this newspaper's correspondence column where a reader said Rifkind was a
typically successful Tory: clever but not wise. Well, no-one can doubt
he is clever.
A few years ago, when Michael Forsyth was plotting Rifkind's downfall
as Secretary of State for Scotland, the beleaguered Rifkind, cast down
as an untrustworthy wet, went along to the Scottish Tory conference
where he carefully timed his entrance to the platform. His reception was
riotous by Scottish Tory standards -- this, remember, was during the
apogee of Thatcherism -- and he proceeded to reel off his 20-point plan
for a Tory agenda. He made that speech entirely off the cuff and without
a single note. I have often wondered about that speech.
Speaking spontaneously is one thing -- David Owen and Edward Heath
were masters at it, though no better than Jim Sillars in his heyday --
but to remember 20 consecutive points takes some beating. Has the man a
photographic memory? For most of his career Malcolm Rifkind has been
haunted by his early devolutionary views. He hates being reminded that
he resigned from the Tory front bench over the issue. I know this from
experience: when I reminded him of it recently in Brussels and asked if
history might now repeat itself, given John Major's rediscovered
Unionism, Mr Rifkind was, shall we say, rather short.
He is also a federalist, they whisper. In his earlier days, when he
was seen as a quasi-Liberal, he was known to espouse a federal Britain,
if only as a means of protecting the Union. Now that the very mention of
federalism -- in the European sense -- is the trigger for Tories to go
into Tom and Jerry mode it might be wise to remember that today's
Malcolm Rifkind is a wiser and older man. We should listen more to the
middle-aged, cigar-puffing Foreign Secretary with the expanding midriff
than to the starry-eyed Scottish Office careerist junior of a generation
ago.
But he is a European. Always has been. Like Hurd before him, Rifkind
has a distaste for the Little Englanders -- even Little Scotlanders --
in his party. His Europe is one in which Britain plays an important
role. Letting his European partners know this is his first task. Where
possible he will begin rebuilding bridges knocked away by the Tories'
internal feuding. Rifkind takes over at a time when there is a
widespread assumption in the European Union that trying to reach
decisions at next year's Maastricht renegotiation is pointless because
the British will just wield their veto. In recent weeks those of us
reporting this plain fact have been accused of doing Britain a
disservice and misrepresenting the views of our EU partners. We have
been taken aside by the chaps in suits and quietly told the error of our
ways.
Well, I am delighted to point out that last week the Spanish Foreign
Minister, Javier Solana, whose job is to plan for the Maastricht review,
said: ''Everyone knows we will not be able to conclude the conference
until after the British election which might not be until the early
summer of 1997. There may be no point in us even beginning the serious
negotiations until well into next year.'' So there. Told you so again.
This is the real atmosphere in Europe which faces our new Foreign
Secretary. Like all successful Cabinet heavyweights Malcolm Rifkind has
learned to duck and weave when convenient. We all know from years of
chronicling his progress that he is a past master at saying one thing
and doing another.
Thus he fought valiantly for Ravenscraig but bailed out of St Andrew's
House leaving Ian Lang with the problem. At Transport he insisted that
railway services would be continued on purely social need. At Defence he
banged on about Britain's role in the world while slicing away one-third
of the military.
So let us not underestimate his ability now to reshape the
Government's approach to the Maastricht review. While accepting the
''legitimacy'' -- his word -- of the Tory Euro-sceptics' views he has
been at pains to present himself as a Euro-realist, like John Major
himself. From there it takes only one small step backwards to back
towards a more accommodating approach to EU integration.
Nothing dramatic is required like the abandonment of the veto or the
wholesale embrace of majority voting. There are degrees. Rifkind, the
epitome of the fast-talking lawyer, is the very one to come up with a
formula. He can also expect backing from a Cabinet in which the
Euro-sceptics have seen their influence reduced. How Hurd must envy his
successor.
Malcolm Rifkind's bottom line seems to be that the EU must remain a
collection of nation states with no ''sterile uniformity''. Looked at
from that angle there is little to fear, apart from the Europhobes in
the Tory party -- and they are temporarily shut down -- from inching
ever so cautiously towards more integration. As for the single European
currency -- which he privately supports -- it can be dodged for a while
yet.
Despite all the fuss and federalist paranoia of the Europhobes no-one
is suggesting doing away with national governments. Mind you, given last
week's goings on in Westminster, as seen from Europe, that might not be
a bad idea.

I HAVE a friend on the flat plains of Strathmore who often patronises
me about how plucky we Aberdonians are, struggling away on our marginal
land.
When we were glad to grow 35 cwts to the acre he and his pals in the
Angus Thousand Acre club were crying into their beer if they couldn't
sell 50 cwts for malting.
In recent years we seem to have been catching up. We are now looking
for 70 cwts of winter barley while three tonnes for malting is still
acceptable to the southern fat-cats.
Well now, my barley is such a show that I just had to phone my friend.
Would he come to his lunch on Sunday, ostensibly to meet an old and
mutual friend?
No he really couldn't. It was the start of the strawberry season and
he would have to stay at home.
''But surely,'' says I. ''You lads in Angus do your harvesting by
proxy. You have staff for that sort of thing.''
''Changed days now, Charles. I'm a hands-on farmer nowadays. I have to
put on my wellingtons and keep my hands-on the farming, and meanwhile
the bank has its hands-on my money.''
Having had #1000 an acre of debt on this place in the 1970s I know
what that feels like. It is not good. I will have to enjoy watching my
harvest ripening without the added benefit of impressing my friend.
And I am enjoying it hugely. Better than that, I have lots of time for
enjoyment. The spraying is all done and, with the good Lord feeding the
cows, the cows feeding the calves and Dod inseminating away, I have time
for my new obsession with the push-bike.
I am pleased to report that there have been no more booby prizes,
indeed the farmer is climbing steadily up the rankings. The 10-mile time
trial which first took 40 minutes can now be completed in 30, leaving
time for an extra pint of beer before he goes home.
And that could be a barrier to progress.
You see, competitive cycling is a very technical sport. Every #100 you
spend on your kit saves you a second or two. You can get aerodynamic
spokeless wheels.
You can get an aerodynamic seat that splits the wind and feels like it
is splitting you. And you simply must have those excruciatingly
uncomfortable aerodynamic shorts. You can even spend #100 on a special
helmet, developed as a by-product of the space race, which positively
sucks you along the road.
Then there are special handlebars upon which you lean your elbows and
hold your hands out like a diver to part the wind. I passed the kirk
just as they were coming out on Sunday and the minister was pleased.
He remarked to the Red Rooster (who is an elder) that he would get the
farmer into church yet. ''I see he's putting up a prayer while he's
training. At least that's a start.''
The weight of your bike is very important and people will spend a
fortune to get a bike that is a pound lighter.
I was able to get a huge gain there. For #250 I was able to upgrade
from the Wasting Asset's old 30-pound banger to an Italian job weighing
22 pounds. I was even tempted to spend another #1000 to get another two
pounds off the machine.
The breadwinner kept me right there, though. She is rightly worried
about our retirement fundie.
''How heavy are you?'' she demanded.
''Sixteen and a half stone, only,'' I confessed.
''Well, what's the point of spending a fortune getting two pounds off
the bike when, with a bit of self-restraint, you could get two stone off
yourself, and save a fortune on the booze?''
Such self-restraint is beyond me but the exercise is making the weight
fall off anyway. In two months I have lost more than a stone. At that
rate, in little over a year, I'll have reached a weight below which my
body cannot sustain life.
In fact, it will be a close run thing whether that gets me first or if
it is the heart.
It is a little-known fact that training makes your heart beat faster
when you are actually on the bike, but slower when you are off it. It
seems like the heart gets so tired when you are thrashing along in a
race that it can't be bothered beating so much when you are at rest.
Certainly my heartbeat is down from 72 in my former state, to 52. I
haven't dared to consult my quack about it but there must be a limit. If
it slows 20 beats every two months for another six months I might be the
fittest man in Methlick but I will be clinically dead.
In that case the retirement fundie will certainly be sufficient.
As you can tell, I'm enjoying the bike but not quite so much as at
first.
When first I took to the narrow breeks and the crash helmet no-one
recognised me. I could observe without having to smile and wave to
everyone on the road. But now that my secret is out every second car
toots at me, often making me jump near out of my skin.
The farmer is now the butt of endless jokes, only one of them funny.
When you are accelerating or climbing a steep hill it is common for
fit young cyclists to stand up. In the jargon of the sport they are
''dancing'' as they bob up and down on the peddles.
''The farmer is fairly improving. He was dancing up the Big Brae this
week.''
''Aye,'' came the reply ''but it was just the ''Auld Fashioned
Waltz.''

GLASGOW'S attraction was recognised when it won the UK City of
Architecture and Design 1999 award. The award, for which 17 cities and
regions competed, is about encouraging individuals, companies and
organisations to demand and create quality in the buildings and civic
spaces they use.
GDA's role is also to increase Glasgow's attractiveness to potential
investors and, with its partners, it has embarked on an ambitious
programme of regeneration. In the city centre, priority has been given
to maintaining and building on its attractiveness as a business
location. Major stone cleaning and refurbishment operations are
underway, and the City Watch CCTV system -- the largest of its kind in
Europe -- has significantly increased security.
Manufacturing remains one of the city's major employers but many firms
were being forced to move elsewhere due to a lack of business premises.
GDA and local authorities have been working on a programme to encourage
them to stay in Glasgow and to attract outside firms.
The redevelopment of Pacific Quay will provide 350,000 sq ft of
business space, targeted at head offices and major inward investors.
Eleven other sites have been selected for redevelopment including the
Cambuslang Investment Park and the M8 Food Park which together will
provide another 240,000 sq ft of space.
The major redevelopment, however, will be of the old Garden Festival
site at Pacific Quay. This is scheduled to become both a high-quality
business park and the Scottish National Science Centre -- a major
all-weather visitor centre which aims to be one of Scotland's top
paid-entry attractions.
Earlier this year, Miller Developments and partner CTP won the
competition to develop the site for the business park. They are now
working with GDA to develop the master plan and planning permission is
being considered by Glasgow City Council. The competition to design the
Science Centre was won by Glasgow-based firm Building Design
Partnership. It forms the basis of a national initiative to develop
awareness of science and technology in business, commerce and education
and in everyday life. It is hoped the centre will attract 600,000 paying
visitors every year.
The Cambuslang Investment Park offers 100,000 sq ft of business space.
Two companies from Glasgow's East End, employing 65 people between them,
have already chosen to relocate there. The M8 Food Park provides 140,000
sq ft of business space for food production companies. Ten have
expressed interest, four of which are in negotiation to buy sites on
which to develop their own units.
Support for businesses in disadvantaged areas comes from the Glasgow
Regeneration Fund. Set up by a partnership of seven major companies,
including GDA, Body Shop International and Scottish Homes, the fund
gives financial assistance to small companies in regeneration areas.
This year it helped 31 companies, safeguarding 104 jobs and creating a
further 186. Survival rates for businesses are better than expected, and
the Bank of Scotland has seconded some of its staff to help with
aftercare.
A new partnership, the Glasgow Regeneration Alliance, has been formed
to focus on improving disadvantaged areas. It is a partnership between
GDA, Glasgow City Council, Strathclyde Regional Council and Scottish
Homes, and acts on the recommendations of an inter-agency team.
Programmes such as the Crown Street Regeneration Project in the
Gorbals's Hutchesontown have been developed to improve quality of life
and business in the city's less advantaged areas. The Hutchensontown
''E'' site is the focus of major redevelopment. Construction began early
in 1994 and already more than 100 new houses have been sold to former
residents of the area, local people and first-time buyers. It is the
first time this century private housing has been on sale in the Gorbals.
The run-up to 1999 will focus on widening public awareness of
architecture and design. GDA hopes to encourage people to value their
surroundings more, and to create quality in the areas they use and
develop. It is another opportunity for Glasgow to show the world its
considerable worth.

APART from the possibility of an unexpected rise in the retail price
index on Thursday, this week's diet of economic statistics should do
little to upset UK markets if they want to build on recent gains and
head for record levels.
Last week share prices recovered strongly after the Prime Minister was
re-elected as leader of the Conservative Party and the US and Japan cut
interest rates. The FTSE-100 share index has less than 60 points to
climb to match its all-time closing high of 3520.3 on February 2 last
year.
There is speculation that the Bundesbank, whose council meets on
Thursday, will bring forward reductions in key interest rates.
Economists at James Capel, the City stockbrokers, are forecasting an
unchanged retail price index in June when the inflation figures are
announced that day.
This would leave the headline rate at 3.4%, but the RPIX underlying
rate, which excludes mortgage interest rates, would edge up from 2.7% to
2.8%, while the RPIY rate, which excludes indirect and local authority
taxes, as well as mortgage payments, would remain at 2.2%.
There were no special factors at work in June, and so a sharp rise in
inflation would put the damper on hopes that UK rates will remain on
hold, at least until the autumn.
Producer price data for last month are due later today. Factory gate
prices are forecast to increase by just 0.2%, taking the annual rate
from 4.2% in May to 4.4%. June is not a month when producers push for
higher prices. Input prices are projected to increase by 0.5%, but this
would allow the annual rate to fall from 10% in May to 9.1%.
Industrial production has slowed down in recent months. Capel is
forecasting an increase of 0.5% in May in tomorrow's figures. This would
leave the annual rate of growth unchanged at 2.7%.
The manufacturing component is expected to increase by 0.4% and the
annual rate to edge down from 2.3% in April to 2.2%.
The balance of trade deficit in April is forecast at #900m against
#500m in March.

Jazz
THE band were late. They'd just arrived at the airport from New York
and the stage looked kind of bare. A piano. The bass was there, like a
passport held as guarantee. And a spartan kit of bass drum, tom-tom,
snare, and cymbal. But as we soon found out, that's all they need.
Nothing prepares you for the Jacky Terrasson Trio, not even
Terrasson's brilliant Blue Note debut album which gives advance warning
at least of his penchant for disguising standards. In concert, they
operate at such a quiet level that the slightest tuck of drum takes on
deep significance. Tempo increases and the occasional key change, surely
impromptu from the facial expressions, become almost biblical in their
impact.
Although he now lives in New York, Terrasson is French. Very French.
His touch on piano is Satiesque and he never, but never, overplays. If
they know the tune, most people will know What A Difference A Day Makes
from Esther Phillips's hit version. Though not exactly expansive in her
hands, it sounds positively overblown by comparison to Terrasson's
reading.
To Satiesque add pleasantly contrary. I Love You For Sentimental
Reasons, normally a ballad, was delivered as a hectic Brazilian carnival
tune and a feature for drummer Leon Parker, who coaxed an extraordinary
range of sounds from that small kit with a combination of stick, brush
or beater (ie one of each!).
Their use of space within the music means that pauses become games of
''statues'' until at some seemingly arbitrary moment they're off again,
playing with uncanny understanding and such refinement that bassist
Ugonna Okegwo's one indiscretion sounded like a door banging but
produced smiles all round. The jazz festival has produced some goodies
but this was Steinway to Heaven.

THE New York Coffee, Sugar, and Cocoa Exchange (CSCE) has made a
takeover bid for the London Commodity Exchange. The approach was
confirmed yesterday by LCE chairman Michael Jenkins who said the the
exchange was considering its future strategy.
If the CSCE is successful, it would mean the independence of yet
another venerable City institution would be ended. Already this year,
Barings, S G Warburg, and Kleinwort Benson have moved into foreign
control.
Founded in 1882, the LCE is Europe's largest futures exchange for
commodities known as tropicals.
Its main activities are trading in cocoa with a turnover of over
157,000 futures contracts in June compared with 86,000 in Robusta coffee
which comes chiefly from Africa.
Other commodities traded comprise white and raw sugar, freight
futures, wheat, barley, and potatoes with the levels of business highly
dependent upon weather. Frost in Brazil can send the coffee price
soaring.
The British exchange is owned by its 500-member companies.

Clare Henry discovers that artistic interpretations of sport, the sea,
and jazz mix surprisingly well
Hot red, orange,
and black acrylics
capture the
mood of a crowded
jazz club
A TRIO of themed art shows: sport, jazz and the sea -- prove what a
bright idea this can be in the right hands.
Sporting Prints at Glasgow Print Studio is terrific. The title is
accurate but these are no boringly traditional huntin', shootin',
fishin' images but inventive interpretations by 27 artists which run the
gamut from wacky flights of fancy to straight no-nonsense golfers and
racehorses.
Everything from football to darts, and climbing to snooker is covered.
Each has a different approach and the art is first-rate stuff by
top-class folk. Peter Howson's four etchings of golfers on the fairway
or taking a swing with a No. 5 wood while the caddy looks on, is
draughtsmanship at its best.
Howson himself is a keen golfer and it shows. The horses in John
Houston's Musselburgh Racecourse are similarly perfectly drawn from
bridle to hoof, while Andrew Bett's loud, shiny, red, Monza racing car
epitomises speed.
Yet sport also lends itself to amusing interpretations. Willie Rodger
demonstrates his knack of nailing comic gesture with virtuoso simplicity
in Football Talent Spotting and Spot Kick; Jonathan Cassells creates the
celebrity team from hell with Ian Paisley at right full-back alongside
Barbie, The Pope, and Billy Connelly, with Mother Teresa in goal. Joe
Davis's goal defence is even more surprising: a fierce-looking Stone-Age
gent with leaves attached to spears.
Boxing proves popular. Janie Nicholl reinterprets Muybridge, Bob Wyatt
gives us a handsome black bruiser while John Byrne's Champion has a
cauliflower ear. Byrne, the most responsive of artists, for once found
the subject not to his liking, so in a typically inventive way, Byrne
also turns the theme on its head to give us a couple of cheeky
''unsporting'' prints.
A Byrne boy teasingly holds a newly caught fish at arm's length from a
desperate cat. Best of all is Unsporting Print II where a sly, evil
hunter is up to dastardly deeds.
Elizabeth Blackadder tackles greyhounds, Roberto Gonzalez archery, Jo
Ganter ballooning, Alison McMenemy synchronised swimming, John Taylor
shooting, and Jila Peacock climbing. Norman Mathieson's father's
obsession with horse racing has led him to produce stong turf etchings.
Ruth Greer's horsemen joust.
It's left to David Mach and Adrian Wiszniewski to come up with
all-time crackers. Wiszniewski's effete upside-down Bungee Jumper looks
more in tune with harpsicord music and cocktails on the terrace than
sports; surely a gentleman of leisure merely pretending to jump. And
when Mach designed his Jab With the Left, Lead With the Right, a
cleverly fragmented image of John Major on the receiving end of a
disembodied boxing glove, little could he have known how topical it was
to be.
Prices for the sporting prints start at #75 for Bett's stylish Monza
car and #80 for Rodger's fabulous footballers and go up to #293 for
Mach's John Major. Bargains all.
Jazz in July is Art Exposure Gallery's nicely timed homage to Glasgow
Jazz Festival. In 1980 the great Miles Davis began to experiment with
line and colour, drawing elongated dancers and performers like Josephine
Baker in a stylised way. I love his music, but as an artist he is not
much cop. These outline drawings prove yet another example of that
irresistible urge to trade on a reputation.
Jeff McDonald is certainly a better artist than musician. His hot red,
orange and black acrylics really capture the noisy throbbing vibrations
and mood of a crowded jazz club. McDonald's small studies of musicians
prove his contention that as a player himself he knows the basic shapes
of the instruments.
Laura Hamilton has found the magic answer to avoid the treadmill of
well-known, overexposed names. Advertise! Her Artist Newsletter request
for work in all media on the subject of sea for the Collin's Gallery's
exhibition Uisge Beatha, brought shoals of nice surprises, including
ceramics and jewellery, starting at a mere #7.
Artists have interpreted the subject in a wide-ranging way. Natalie
Vardey of Castle Douglas responded with Seaspray Drops, Trawler Broach
and Mermaid's Purse: filigree jewellery adorned with freshwater pearls
and tiny silver fishes. Edna Whyte of Luing contributes spare and
special drawings evoking the clear light breeze of Cuan.
Nearer home, David Martin proffers derelict Clydeside shipyards while
Liz Murray shows pale delicate collages called Shore Quilts. Charmian
Pollok walked at Annan to collect her leaves and twigs to make her
distinctive boxes. Behrens, Montgomery, Paterson, Renton, Urie, and
Wells also contribute. But where's that master of the tidal wave and
shore scrumble, Bill Wright? He is much missed.
To link Art Exposure and GPS, the Original Print Shop shows dynamic
jazz prints by Dominic Snyder and vigorous and volley-ball lino cuts by
John McNaught. These shows, all within a five-minute walk, provide both
Glasgwegians and visitors with a summery, light-hearted look at art
during July.

A HISTORY OF THE INDIANS OF THE UNITED STATES
By Angie Debo.
Pimlico: #12.50.
IT IS the custom of all conquerors in the name of civilisation, once
they have eliminated or enslaved the beneficiaries of their conquest, to
realise all of of a sudden what jolly decent chaps the conquered people
were.
Thus was Rudyard Kipling able to make a British soldier of the Raj
say: ''You're a better man than I am, Gunga Din''; thus did Hitler
propose, after the end of the Final Solution, to build a monumental
memorial in Berlin to the tragedy of the Jewish race; thus did the most
fanatical devotees of Manifest Destiny in nineteenth-century America
propose a similar monument to the nobility of the Red Man, just as soon
as there should be none of them left.
It would be easy as well as cynical to view the recent revival of
interest in the history of the Native Americans -- see Kevin Costner's
well-meaning but hopelessly sentimental and simplistic film Dances With
Wolves, for example -- in the same light, but too easy and too cynical
for truth when it comes to judging the late Angie Debo's honest and
sympathetic book, although the fact that it only now receives its first
British publication, 25 years after the first edition, probably has as
much to do with literary and cultural fashion as with its intrinsic
qualities.
Arguable though its premises and structure are (the history given here
is almost entirely a history of the Indians' relations with the white
man and his state power, as though they had no history of their own), it
is clear that Debo, a veteran campaigner and activist for fair play for
the Indians, is a true friend, according to her lights, of the
aboriginal American race.
She avoids, for example, the trite Noble Savage idealism of some
fictitious or at best unknowable utopia that existed before the
Conquistadors came up from Mexico and the Pilgrim Fathers landed on the
Mayflower. War, cruelty, and social oppression were far from unknown
among the Indian peoples. Indeed, to many tribes war was something
between a sport and a religion, and although a rough kind of consensual
democracy was the general rule, there was a minority of tribes whose
social structure was entirely and sometimes brutally feudal. Yet from
her cool and considered chronicle of 400 years of conquest and cheat
there emerges, always incidentally rather than in the form of a sermon,
a truly moving picture of the culture that made the Indians such
innocent and easy prey for European exiles.
Here was a people (or rather peoples, for the author is always careful
to avoid presenting a continent-wide collection of tribes as a
homogeneous mass) to whom, within each tribe, the aggressive European
concepts of expansion, individualism, and competition were entirely
alien. Their first loyalty was not to self or family but to the physical
world they lived in, and after that to a clan, and after that to some
numinous, semi-mystical respect for individual humanity, be it brother
or stranger -- which, as Debo reminds us, is the philanthropy by which
they kept the Pilgrim Fathers alive in 1622 when their first crops
failed.
How could they have been expected to resist for long against European
Christians supported by modern technology, the certainty of their own
racial superiority, and the belief that -- as Bob Dylan sang of the
early settlers -- the country was young, and they had God on their side?
Debo, a New Frontier JFK liberal of the good old school, is no bitter
polemicist -- when she goes wrong, it is more on the side of liberal
paternalism than of displaced partisan rancour, and the conclusions of
her book are not half as bold as its implications -- but the clearest
message from this scholarly but readable and immensely uplifting book is
that both the public downfall and the secret triumph of the Indians has
lain in their refusal to accept the values of their conquerors.
Time and again, from the seventeenth century to the 1970s, we find the
Native Americans forever willing to compromise and share, to collude in
their own robbery of land and resources, to retreat and retreat again,
resisting only when in danger of being starved to death or when efforts
are made to force them to integrate into white America or to abandon
their tribal identity and culture, to give up yet more of the last
remnants of the lands to which they were so spiritually tied. ''Sell a
country!'' cried the great chief of Indian unity, Tecumseh, at the
Vincennes Conference of 1808. ''Why not sell the air, the clouds, and
the great sea, as well as the earth? Did not the Great Spirit make them
all for the use of his children?''
And the history of such efforts is far from ancient. In 1877, arguing
against the reservation system that at its best at least allowed the
Indians to live their own lives in peace with each other and the United
States, a Government-appointed Indian Agent reported to Washington: ''As
long as Indians live in villages they will retain many of their old and
injurious habits. Frequent feasts, heathen ceremonies and dances,
constant visiting -- these will continue . . I trust that before another
year is concluded they will generally be located upon individual land or
farms.''
Where they could be more easily robbed and duped without the support
of their tribes, of course. And as late as 1944, a spokesman for the
National Council of Churches attacked the Reorganisation Act (the single
most progressive piece of Indian legislation ever enacted, giving the
tribes new Federal protection, cultural independence, and control of
their lands -- it was, naturally, reneged upon in the 1950s) as ''a
revival of tribalism'' backed by ''the high-sounding cry of religious
freedom''.
Here is the nub of America's real beef with the Native Americans:
their quietly defiant self-containedness, their maddeningly mild and
tolerant refusal to throw themselves into the melting-pot. They don't
bother much with national politics. They don't show much ambition in
commercial or industrial capitalism. They don't have an upwardly-mobile
middle class like the blacks and the Hispanics. They don't -- despite a
shocking history of blood libels, broken treaties, outright theft, and
attempted genocide -- even make much of a fuss about their rights. Who
do these people think they are?
They are the people who by their very survival challenge the received
idea of what human life can be like; history's witnesses against the
poisonous canard that human nature is intrinsically too selfish and
competitive for us to live a better kind of life than we do.
They are the people of whom the American poet and novelist Stephen
Vincent Benet (Western Star, 1943) wrote:
They were a people beginning --
With beliefs --
Ornament, language, fables, love of children
(You will find that spoken of in all the books.)
And a scheme of life that worked.
They're the people who think they're still Indians. That's who.

IT WAS an extremely uncomfortable snagging toenail which led me,
limping, to the first chiropody clinic I had ever attended and thus to
the fascinating discovery of the extraordinary matter of the link
between chiropody and black crime. This is not a joke.
The chiropodist was a big, beefy bloke in his middle thirties who
looked like a rugby player. If you had seen him in the street in a suit
you would have imagined that he did something important in business, or
possibly sold cars. He applied himself to the troublesome toenail with
the enthusiasm of a professional and I found myself wondering, as one
does, how -- and, more particularly, why -- such an unlikely looking
candidate had made a career out of feet. It is obviously a job which
somebody has to do, but it doesn't seem very, well, glamorous, or even
terribly interesting.
So I asked him. I am not always so forthright. It took me ages to get
around to asking the butcher whether, as a small boy, he had imagined
that he would grow up to dismember the carcasses of dead animals with a
cleaver. It was all right, though: it turned out he got waylaid in the
meat department en route to being a chef.
The chiropodist had also taken the turning up his particular career
path as a result of an accident. His was a literal one. He was a
sportsman, suffered a sports injury, and became interested in treating
other sportsmen. And that, he said, was one of the main aspects of his
business, apart from this clinic -- and Wormwood Scrubs, of course.
A clinic at the Scrubs! Why? Was it a matter of routine? Or do
prisoners suffer more than most with their feet? Are they made to do a
lot of walking during the exercise period, perhaps? One would have
thought, if one had paused to think about it, that perhaps men in jail
would suffer rather less than others from podiatry problems having so
much time on their hands, so to speak, and thus off their feet.
The explanation was unexpected but exceptionally simple. The
chiropodist spoke eloquently as he described the extraordinary set of
social circumstances which provides him with so much business. There are
apparently a large number of African prisoners in the Scrubs who have
been put away for smuggling, usually drugs. They are one of the links in
the chain of the drugs trade, personally unimportant but vital human
donkeys.
They are always poor and are recruited by the lure of the cash payment
they will receive for a completed mission -- most of which, of course,
they do not get until they return, if they manage to do so. They may not
know what they are smuggling, or even that this is what they are doing.
They are given a suit and a passport and a return ticket and they are
put on the plane with their evil consignment. And they are also very
often equipped with the first pair of shoes they have ever worn. If they
get caught and convicted, they end up in jail and they have to continue
wearing shoes. One can only imagine the extent of discomfort this might
offer to someone who has walked barefoot through life.
The chiropodist explained that it was considerable, primarily because
of the toughened skin that necessarily develops on the sole. From his
point of view, as a professional, the problem was a fascinating one.
I have related this anecdote for a purpose. It struck me that it
contains a number of lessons for those who get agitated about what is,
or is not, politically correct. It is an interesting social phenomenon
to me that there should be any kind of link at all between any kind of
crime and the practice of chiropody. But it would be fatuous to tell
this story without relating it to what I am sure is an offence against
political correctness -- even though it is demonstrably a fact that only
black people are likely to be affected.
Its current relevance is because of the comments of the Metropolitan
Police Commissioner, Sir Paul Condon, about the extent to which the
young black community in London is responsible for the crime of mugging.
While he was supported by the Home Secretary, Mr Michael Howard, and
not surprisingly by the Police Federation, he was violently criticised
by various black caucus organisations and community groups. The reason,
of course, is that Sir Paul's comments were politically incorrect in the
extreme. The point was well made by the black Labour MP, Paul Boateng:
one could equally well produce figures to show that most City fraud is
committed by upper-class middle-aged white men, he said. So one could.
The difference is that no-one would take offence at this statement of
reality.
Lots of people did, however, take offence at what Sir Paul had to say.
For even though it may be a correct statement, it is obviously also a
source of considerable potential concern to all those young black men
who are not muggers, not involved in any kind of crime and fed up to the
teeth with being viewed suspiciously because of the activities of others
with whom they merely happen to share the colour of skin.
Sir Paul's motives are uncertain. He might possibly have been trying
to force a debate within the police force and thus do something about
the known racism within the force. That would obviously be of some
long-term advantage. But another clue to the root of the problem was
also provided at the end of one of the reports about the angry reaction
to what Sir Paul had said. It was the statistical finding that young
black men are three times more likely to be out of work than their white
counterparts. And if there was no drugs trade there would be no
chiropody problem at Wormwood Scrubs either.

PUT it down to its organic growth: where groups designed to perpetuate
the music of a dead jazzman can often be a hit and miss affair, this
ensemble playing the tunes of bassist and band-leader Charlie Mingus is
a cracker. You would hope for as much looking at the line-up, but these
things don't always gell. This was a memorable coup for the jazz
festival (the band goes on to two dates in London's Jazz Cafe) and a
storming conclusion to this year's event -- and the BBC were there to
record it.
The feel of the performance was exactly that of Mingus's own bands.
Loose and freewheeling, but swinging; deceptively easy on the ear when
there are hugely complex things going on, and with a natural but
powerful sense of dynamics. More to the point for fans looking for the
new, they eschew the obvious -- resurrecting Mingus obscurities, using
charts that were never performed in the composer's lifetime, and
commissioning their own arrangements, notably Gunter Shuller's of
Started Melody.
After a day that had evidently had its trials (the band had not
enjoyed an easy relationship with British Airways), they chose to open
with So Long Eric, Mingus's dedication to reedsman Eric Dolphy and a
tune replete with playground chants from the trumpets that the band had
never played before. It marked out the territory that the first two
solos were taken into by altoist Steve Slagle and Frank Lacy, ''the
Toscanini of the trombone'', who directed much of the music from within
the 11-piece horn section.
Trumpeter Kenny Rampton and pianist Kenny Drew Jr also won loud cheers
at the end of the night for their solo work on Invisible Lady and
elsewhere, the latter displaying awesome two-handed technique and
classical construction, but it was the sound of the ensemble on classics
like Nostalgia in Times Square and Fable of Faubus that really made the
night.

LIKE charity, conservation begins at home, according to Scottish
Natural Heritage.
So when the bat colony at its Battleby headquarters was faced with
eviction because of re-roofing work, SNH officers devised a bat-box for
the eaves, where their resident bats could roost undisturbed.
Around 700 bats -- most of them the commonest species found in
Scotland, the pipistrelle -- are now using the Battleby bat-box for
their second summer.
The Battleby bat experience has allowed SNH to improve its own
knowledge and to initiate a project with the Edinburgh architects firm
Simpson and Brown, based in Canongate, for designing bat-boxes for
household use.
Mr Stewart Pritchard, regional advisory officer for the SNH south-east
region, said: ''SNH has got a statutory remit to provide advice to
property owners and others about bats they have in their houses. Lots of
bats live in people's attics and while generally they do not cause a
problem, they occasionally do become a nuisance.''
He added: ''If people are worried about them, or they might want to
carry out renovation work, we advise them how to do it without affecting
the bats.
''We tell people about bats, that they are not doing any harm, and
people become quite keen on them and decide to keep them. Where there is
no easy solution, we advise on ways of excluding bats.''
To help that category of people who need to do work on their homes but
do not want to exclude their bats, SNH has been working on a
''bat-friendly, human-friendly'' bat-box.
Its own bat-box, made from two boxes joined together and almost five
metres long, turned out to be bigger than needed, said Mr Pritchard.
''We now reckon it was several times too long. Possibly even just one
small one built properly will accommodate any known bat colony, which
can vary from just a few to hundreds,'' he said.
In addition, the positioning was wrong, as it was in a well-ventilated
area.
''On very hot days, you could find some bats getting into the foyer of
the building and flying over the receptionist's head. It was found quite
amusing by most staff but one or two were not so keen.''
When they use it, the bats huddle in a corner of the triangular box.
It is used mainly from May to September, initially by pregnant females.
There they give birth to their single young and, in mid-July, leave them
to find cooler roosts. The young bats leave around September.
''The bat-box can be used as a potential roost site in a renovated
building or a new-build house, or to replace existing roosts which have
been damaged.
''We are waiting for the architect, Mandy Ketchin, to produce the
final draft of the design. Then we will put it out to consultation with
various bat people round the country and other agencies. We think that,
when it is finalised, it will be of interest to architects, builders,
and conservation trusts,'' said Mr Pritchard.

THEY loved him madly. For a while it seemed as if they'd never let him
go back to his hotel. Half of them would have gladly gone back to his
hotel with him. On Fly Me to the Moon his request that they ''hold my
hand'' solicited a cry of ''anytime'' that stopped him in his tracks.
And when he told them nobody wanted him now that he was old and grey
they went all pantomimic, screaming, ''Oh yes we do.''
Having watched the Tony Bennett Unplugged television concert, on which
it appeared that not only had he left his heart in San Franciso but he
had also left his ears in the dressing room, I have to confess to
approaching this with trepidation.
I didn't come away entirely converted. Very often you got the
impression of a man who knows he is treading on thin ice as far as the
melodies go and picks his steps through the songs accordingly. He sang
everything everybody wanted to hear -- San Francisco, Stranger in
Paradise, Who Can I Turn To? and around two dozen others -- to efficient
accompaniment from his long-time musical director Ralph Sharon's trio
and without giving the wince-o-meter too much work.
But essaying The Girl I Love, which requires a bit more vocal
elasticity than he has and which suddenly took off at Linford Christie
pace, wasn't his best idea. Lucky So and So, in a Duke Ellington
selection and with only bass accompaniment, was similarly uneasy
listening.
But I didn't pay for my ticket and those who did were of one mind.
''You're the bloody best, pal,'' yelled their spokesman as Bennett sang
sans microphone during the umpteenth encore. The feeling appeared to be
mutual.

building and placed it behind a wall 100yd away. The bomb was found in a
lavatory in the hotel at the eastern coastal town of Cambrils. Two other
small bombs were detonated by police.
The bombs have been planted in resorts within a few miles of Port

A SCOT who had his leg amputated after contracting a vascular
condition, allegedly caused by smoking, has been refused legal aid to
sue the tobacco companies he claims are responsible.
Mr Edward Havelin, 39, of Blackwood Street, Anniesland, Glasgow,
lodged a six figure compensation suit at the Court of Session in May
against Gallahers and Imperial Tobacco.
He claims that when he started smoking in 1970, the tobacco companies
knew that smoking carried health risks but did not place warnings on
cigarette packets until 1971.
Mr Havelin, whose right leg was amputated in 1994 after contracting
Buerger's Disease, a condition unique to smokers, will now appeal
against the decision.
His solicitor, Mr Cameron Fyfe of Ross Harper and Murphy, said: ''I
had hoped the Legal Aid Board would approve Mr Havelin's application as
there is a widely held suspicion that it is unwilling to fund litigation
against tobacco giants because of the likely cost.
''The enormous power and wealth of multinational tobacco companies
should not be a barrier to Scots receiving access to justice.''
Mr Havelin, who still smokes, said: ''I cannot afford to fight this
case on my own. I am very disappointed.''
Doctors recently told Mr Havelin, a former labourer, that his left leg
may also have to be amputated because the disease is spreading.

Amsterdam, Sunday
WHEN transport activist Luud Schimmelpenninck offered Amsterdam the
use of free ''White Bikes'' in the flower-power 1960s, most of them were
promptly stolen. The rest ended up in the canals.
Now Schimmelpenninck is again attempting to roll back the tyranny of
the internal combustion engine with another White Bike scheme, and this
time he says it's going to work.
Schimmelpenninck has been running a pilot scheme for his ''Depo''
system of a computer-controlled, coin-operated bicycle fleet. If the
scheme backs up his research, Amsterdam could have 1000 of his new bikes
on the streets within three years, he claims.
''This is totally different from the scheme in the '60s,'' says
Schimmelpenninck. ''This time there's money involved -- people have to
return the bikes to get their deposit back.''
Under the Depo scheme, 70 special racks will be dotted around the
centre of Amsterdam, each with their complement of bicycles. Users will
have to punch in their destination at a control panel, put in their five
guilder (about #2) deposit, and wait for the rack to release the bike.
His bikes captured the world's headlines in the 1960s as activists
warned of pollution and gridlock in city centres. However they quickly
came to symbolise the triumph of human nature over idealism as they
disappeared from the streets.
The new bikes look as if they have been welded together from
drain-pipes and bits from a child's scooter and are spectacularly ugly.
''This will be a fully commercial venture,'' said Schimmelpenninck,
who needs #1m to finance his scheme.--AP.

Seoul, Sunday
A STUDENT aged 21 was pulled alive and well from a collapsed
department store today after miraculously surviving nine-and-a-half days
under tonnes of rubble.
''I slept and slept in order not to think bad things,'' said Choi
Myong-sok, who worked in the store as a part-time salesman. ''I thought
only five days had passed.''
Choi, bare-chested and his head wrapped in a towel to shield his eyes
from the light, was pulled to the surface after nearly two hours of
digging, to the applause of rescuers and the tears of relatives who had
given up hope.
''There will be many more survivors,'' Choi said, but gave no reasons.
After medical checks at nearby St Mary's Hospital, doctors pronounced
Choi relatively fit. He was well enough to speak to reporters and
stunned relatives in the emergency room.
He said he was in the basement of the store when the building gave
way. Two women survivors were nearby at the time of the collapse, he
said, but both died after drowning in water sprayed by firefighters to
douse smouldering debris.
The same water, and torrential rain over the past two days, helped him
to cling to life.
He said the most difficult moment was when one of the two women, a
store employee, told him she was dying.
''I wanted to talk to somebody. There was no-one to speak to,'' said
Choi, speaking in a calm and clear voice.
He added: ''I fell into despair again when I noticed the noise of
digging over my head stopped one or two days ago.''
Kim Se-kyong, a doctor who attended Choi, said: ''Choi was able to
move all parts of his body normally. He will make a normal recovery.
''He was badly dehydrated but his blood pressure, his pulse, and his
state of mind were all very good. He had very few injuries.''
Rescuers said they heard Choi calling for help while working on an
early shift in torrential rain to retrieve a dead body from under a
concrete slab.
''As we tried to cut through a concrete slab, we heard a cry of
someone saying 'Help, I'm alive','' said rescue worker Han Sang-kyu.
''When we shone a torch through the piles of concrete, Choi was there,
his head drenched with water and asking to be rescued.''
Rescue workers had given up hope of finding any more survivors in the
wreckage of the Sampoong Department Store, where more than 400 people
are feared to have been killed after the store collapsed on June 29.
The official death toll from the disaster stood at 156, with 262
missing.
The last time a survivor was found alive was last Sunday but she died
two hours later.
Choi's father, Choi Bong-yol, who has been working as a volunteer at
the disaster site, said: ''I cannot put my feelings into words. I feel
as if I'm flying.''
Choi's recovery bolstered the hopes of other relatives at the scene of
the disaster who have had an agonising nine-day wait for news of their
loved ones.
Some of them took to the street, demanding more concerted action to
rescue survivors. Four hundred relatives clashed with police while
marching on the presidential Blue House.
Heavy rain continued to badly hamper the search operation. Rising
temperatures, humidity, and the rain, which is forecast to last for
several more days, are giving rise to serious concerns about the
decomposing bodies of the victims and the risk of infection.
Store owner Lee Joon and three others have been charged with criminal
negligence leading to the collapse of one of Seoul's most exclusive
shopping haunts.--Reuter.

Karachi, Sunday
AT LEAST 14 people were killed and 20 wounded today in violence in the
strike-crippled Pakistani port of Karachi.
The southern city of 12 million people was eerily quiet on the third
day of an anti-government strike called by the ethnic Mohajir National
Movement (MQM) in protest at the death of former city councillor, Aslam
Sabzwari, in police custody.
Police said the dead included two members of Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party, who were killed in an attack at Khwaja
Ajmer Nagri Town in District Central.
This month's death toll now stands at 93. More than 1000 people have
died in ethnic, sectarian, and political violence in Pakistan's biggest
city this year.
Unrest also hit the neighbouring city of Hyderabad, where police said
one man was killed and several people wounded in gunfire.
In Islamabad, the Senate started a debate on the Karachi crisis
requested by the opposition Pakistan Muslim League.
Opposition leader Raja Zafarul Haq said the government should suspend
security operations in Karachi to create the right atmosphere for talks
with the MQM, which are due to start on Tuesday.
''If these talks fail, no-one will be in a position to stop the havoc
which would befall Karachi and Pakistan,'' Haq said.--Reuter.

Salem, Sunday
AMERICAN John Childs, who was kidnapped by Kashmiri rebels along with
two Britons and a second US citizen, today told how rain and darkness
helped him escape.
Mr Childs, of Simsbury, Connecticut, was among the group of four
tourists in the north Indian province abducted on Tuesday by militants
of Al-Faran, a little-known Muslim separatist group fighting for
Kashmir's independence.
Indian authorities have continued their hunt for his three companions,
who include Britons Keith Mangan, 33, from London, Paul Wells, 23, from
Nottingham, and a German tourist taken in a separate incident.
The rebels have threatened to ''take an extreme step'' unless the
Indian Government releases 21 of their captured comrades by July 15. The
group has also demanded an end to what it called the ''genocide of
Muslims'' by the military.
Mr Childs was picked up by an Indian military helicopter some 15 hours
after his escape. He had waved down the pilot from a mountain side.
He was flown to safety in Srinagar, the summer capital of
Jammu-Kashmir state, where he told reporters: ''I took advantage of
darkness and bad weather . . . I was not released, I escaped.''
He made his bid for freedom yesterday. At about the same time,
militants captured Dirk Hasert of Erfurt, Germany, who was riding
through the same area but it was not known if this was in response to
the escape or if Al-Faran was involved.
Mr Childs today confirmed that the other three hostages were still
being held in Kashmir, the only Muslim-majority state in mostly Hindu
India.
Lieutenant General D D Saklani, a top security adviser to the state's
governor, said Mr Childs escaped during a rainstorm from a mud hut where
was being held by about 15 Muslim guerrillas.
To avoid being recaptured, he climbed the 14,000ft mountain range,
instead of going down it.
''At about 5pm, we saw a person waving at us on a steep hill,''
Saklani said. ''We went down as low as 50ft and told him in sign
language to shift to an area where we could land.''
Indian soldiers continued searching the Himalayan mountain region

BOSSES in Scotland are the UK's biggest industrial bullies, according
to a new survey by the white-collar union, Manufacturing, Science, and
Finance.
The survey, published today, claims that 41% of Scots workers feel
they are victims of workplace bullying. The next highest UK rate is in
East Anglia at 38%.
The union also claims that even these rising figures may be only the
tip of the iceberg because many employees are too afraid of losing their
jobs to speak out.
Over Britain as a whole, an average 35% of workforces feel they are
subjected to undue pressure or outright intimidation by the people who
run their companies.
Almost 30% say that bullying has worsened over the last five years and
17% that their executives actively encouraged a bullying management
style. The survey reports that 72% of employers have no official policy
for tackling bullying.
Examples of bullying behaviour cited in the survey include shouting,
anger and aggression, placing impossible deadlines to increase stress,
taking credit for employees' ideas, sarcasm and abuse in front of
colleagues, and persistent public criticism of individuals.
Mr Chris Ball, MSF national officer leading the union's anti-bullying
campaign, said last night: ''Our figures show just how many people are
having their working lives made a misery by obnoxious and inadequate
managements. These people should be removed.
''We cannot allow the workplace to be dominated by fear.
''It is not, after all, in a company's interest to permit bullying. It
causes physical and emotional stress on the victims, leaves people
unable to carry out their jobs properly, and increases absenteeism and
resignations. The firms end up the losers.''
Mr Ball blamed harsh management techniques combined with a lack of
legal rights for those affected for the increase in complaints. He added
that many individuals felt so threatened they did not come forward at
all.
He said: ''The figures we have for 412 private and public sector areas
covering more than 140,000 workers in the UK may not tell the entire
story. The fear factor may mean that many more victims who are afraid to
speak out for fear of repercussions.''

TWO sisters were fighting for their lives last night after a crash
claimed the lives of three people, including their grandmother and
cousin.
Amanda, 15, and Julia Walker, 6, of King Street, Airdrie, had to be
cut from the wreckage of their car, a Nissan Micra, after it was dragged
along the carriageway by a 38-tonne truck near Belmont, Durham.
The girls' grandmother, Mrs Betty Walker, was killed in the crash,
along with her grandchild, Lindsay Arbuckle, of Durham. Mrs Walker's
friend, Mr Alan Lyons, was also killed.
They had been on their way to Mr Lyons's daughter's wedding.
The girls' parents, Jim and Linda Walker, were yesterday travelling to
Dryburn Hospital, Durham.
A relative at the sheltered housing complex in Aitchison Court,
Airdrie, where Mrs Walker and Mr Lyons lived, said: ''Mr Lyons did a lot
of work for disabled charities. He was such a nice guy and Betty was a
lovely woman.''
Meanwhile, a 29-year-old woman was seriously ill last night in
Glasgow's Southern General hospital.
Miss Simone Bayer, of Erfurt, Germany, suffered head injuries on
Saturday when the motorcycle on which she was a sidecar passenger, was
in collision with a car on the Skipness Road near Tarbert.
Miss Bayer was taken to Mid Argyll hospital and later transferred to
the Southern General, where her condition was described as very serious.
Police said that a 23-year-old man would be the subject of a report to
the procurator-fiscal.

DETECTIVES are hunting a taxi driver who raped a 20-year-old woman
after she refused a lift from him.
Yesterday Edinburgh's black-cab drivers were helping police in an
attempt to identify the rapist.
The city has 1003 licensed Hackney cabs, many used by more than one
driver.
A detective said the victim, thought to live in the area of the attack
in Duddingston, had been ''very shocked and distressed''.
The possibility the attacker, who may have injuries to his face,
throat, and arms, was a bogus taxi driver has not been ruled out but
police are working on the belief he was genuine.
However, Mr Alex Graham, secretary of the Edinburgh Taxi Operators'
Association, said he believed it was a bogus driver using an old black
cab.
''I find it inconceivable an Edinburgh taxi driver could be involved
in this,'' he added.
The trade, he said, had spent a long time building up the trust of
people, particularly women, whose calls are given priority to ensure
their safety.
''Our hope is the police can eliminate the Edinburgh taxi drivers so
that confidence can be restored quickly.''
He said it was not unknown for old taxis to be sold for a few hundred
pounds but no register was kept of them.
''In view of this incident, there could be a case for the authorities
now to look at this.''
Mr Graham said the licence conditions were very tight and photographs
of all drivers were kept.
''If there is a screwball driving around in a black cab the trade want
him caught. If he is a licensed driver there will be no question of
trying to protect him and the police better get their hands on him
before taxi drivers do.''
Mr Bill Gordon, speaking for City Cabs which has around 200 black
taxis, said his firm, as well as others in Edinburgh, had been helping
police check records and photographs.
He also said he found it difficult to believe a taxi driver would be
involved.
The incident happened around 6.30pm on Saturday as the woman was
walking alone in Magdalene Gardens.
She was approached by the driver and declined his offer of a lift.
Just as she was approaching the main road at Duddingston Park South, the
driver dragged her to a grassy area and raped her.
The man was then seen to return to his vehicle and drive off towards
Niddrie.
The attacker has been described as between 34 to 38 years old, 5ft
9in, and of medium build. He has dark, short hair shaved at the back and
cropped all over, and was wearing jeans and a long-sleeved white top.
Meanwhile, police have arrested a man in connection with an alleged
rape in Leven early yesterday. The man is expected to appear at
Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court today.
The incident is alleged to have taken place after a 28-year-old woman
left Manhattans nightclub in Burnmill Road.

Sarajevo, Sunday
BOSNIAN Serb troops drove their tanks and infantry to the edge of
Srebrenica and fired artillery shells into the UN ''safe area'' today
after seizing 30 UN peacekeepers.
An elite team of Dutch peacekeepers, equipped with wire-guided
anti-tank weapons, moved to the city's southern limits in defence, and
the United Nations threatened the Bosnian Serbs with Nato air strikes if
attacks continued.
''The advance must stop where it is,'' said a letter sent tonight to
Bosnian Serb Army commander Lieutenant General Ratko Mladic.
The letter warned the Serbs against attacks on the Dutch troops, who
formed what was described as a blocking position south of town.
The letter demanded that the Bosnian Serb offensive cease immediately,
that Serb forces withdraw to positions held before the attack began on
Thursday, and that all Dutch peacekeepers be released along with their
equipment.
Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic welcomed the UN warning as
''good news''.
The Dutch special unit was deployed on Srebrenica's southern perimeter
after Bosnian Serb infantry, backed by tanks, advanced to within half a
mile of the town.
UN observers saw artillery pieces firing into the town, said UN
spokesman Alexander Ivanko. ''It's pretty much one-way shelling,'' he
added.
Bosnian Serbs seized 15 Dutch UN peacekeepers and two armoured
personnel carriers today, adding them to 15 seized in attacks last night
on two UN observation posts near the enclave's former front line.
Bosnian government troops -- blamed by the UN for killing a Dutch UN
peacekeeper yesterday as his unit withdrew from a post attacked by Serbs
-- today prevented 10 Dutch soldiers from leaving another observation
post.
The Dutch were later detained by the Serbs, as were five more UN
peacekeepers.
After a day insisting that the Dutch were not detainees and would be
released shortly, UN officials said they were becoming concerned.
''We're starting to be worried about them, we consider them detainees
now,'' said Ivanko.
Serbs have detained peacekeepers in the past as insurance against Nato
air strikes.
UN officials had no word on casualties but 2000 to 4000 civilians were
reported to have fled the fighting in the south-east of the enclave and
arrived today in Srebrenica town. About 42,000 Bosnian Muslims, most of
them refugees, live in the enclave.
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic sent letters to the leaders of
Britain, the US, Germany, France, asking for help for Srebrenica, one of
six ''safe areas'' declared by the United Nations in 1993.
He said the failure of the UN to stop the advance of Bosnian Serb
tanks into Srebrenica put the future of the UN mission into question.
''There isn't much we can do to stop this advance but if the UN does
nothing we propose to review the usefulness of UN Protection Forces
here,'' he said.
He instructed Foreign Minister Muhamed Sacirbey to ask for an
emergency session of the UN Security Council.
''If Srebrenica falls, that will be the end of the UN mission in
Bosnia-Herzegovina,'' said Mustafa Bijedic, Bosnia's UN
ambassador.--AP/Reuter.

Jerusalem, Sunday
ISRAEL and the PLO, racing to seal a deal to widen Palestinian
self-rule, prepared to take their talks out of the Middle East spotlight
-- probably to Italy.
Officials said the talks would probably move to Italy this week after
both Israelis and Palestinians met US Middle East peace envoy Dennis
Ross, who will be in the region tomorrow.
Ross would discuss arranging for a signing ceremony in Washington,
probably early next month, they said.
The two sides are trying to nail down an accord on expanding
Palestinian self-rule beyond Gaza and Jericho to more of the West Bank,
occupied by Israel since the 1967 Middle East war.
It would be at least the third time talks would take place in Italy,
officials said.
Israeli Environment Minister Yossi Sarid and PLO Chairman Yasser
Arafat both said the sides still aimed to meet the latest deadline for
an accord of July 25, which they set last week.
Meanwhile, the pro-Iranian Hizbollah today fired rockets from south
Lebanon into northern Israel, striking back after two girls were killed
by steel darts in shells fired by Israeli gunners yesterday.
The UN has previously protested to Israel against the use of the
''flechette'', or dart, anti-personnel shells which are banned by a
Geneva Convention.

Wellington, Monday
NEW Zealand is to summon the French ambassador to seek an explanation
after French commandos used tear gas to storm the Greenpeace ship
Rainbow Warrior off Mururoa Atoll.
''It appears that the French have gone totally over the top, bearing
in mind that these were 30 unarmed protesters,'' a spokeswoman said.
The spokeswoman said the cabinet was meeting now to discuss the
storming.
A statement would probably be issued later today to set out the
government's position, she said.
''It is possible then that the ambassador will be called in, will be
spoken to.''
The Australian Government says it also will call in the French
ambassador today to seek an explanation. A government spokesman said
ambassador Dominique Girard would be summoned to a meeting with acting
Foreign Minister Bob McMullan.
Details of the storming of the Rainbow Warrior off the French nuclear
test site of Mururoa were still sketchy, but the action appeared
''offensive'', the spokeswoman added.
The Rainbow Warrior II was just a mile or two from Mururoa when it was
rammed by a French warship and then boarded. The vessel's communications
were cut.
Pictures of masked naval personnel trying to enter the Rainbow Warrior
radio room were caught in a France 3 television interview with
Greenpeace campaigner Jean-Luc Thierry.
''I am in the radio room,'' Thierry said. ''The commandos are trying
to open this door. They are now trying to get through the porthole, a
ladder has been dropped down.
''There has already been violence,'' he said. ''If I am alone in this
radio room it is because we were all gassed and I had no time to get
myself up on to the bridge with my two comrades.''
Moments later the communication was cut.
Remi Parmentier of Greenpeace France said the assault by the navy had
been ''very, very tough, very violent''.
''They used tear gas, which is absolute stupidity because the gas is
designed to make people disperse. How are people supposed to disperse on
a ship?''
The French arrested the Rainbow Warrior's crew and eight campaigners
on four inflatable dinghies, who had entered the 12-mile zone despite a
ban by the authorities.
They were taken to Mururoa and held for questioning by police from the
French Polynesian island of Tahiti.
Spearheading an international protest against French President Jacques
Chirac's decision to stage eight underground blasts at Mururoa atoll,
the Rainbow Warrior was joined yesterday by Greenpeace's yacht Vega and
the Danish vessel Bifrost.
The French navy, which had been tracking the Rainbow Warrior with four
ships for some days under the command of Admiral Philippe Euverte, had
warned that it would divert Greenpeace from the zone as soon as it
crossed the 12-mile line.
The storming occurred on the 10th anniversary of the bombing of the
original Rainbow Warrior by French secret agents in Auckland harbour.
Greenpeace photographer Fernando Pereira died in the bombing, which was
carried out to stop a protest mission to Mururoa.--Reuter

A SHORTAGE of passengers from Scotland and North-east England on the
Eurostar Link train to Paris is not causing the company any great
concern.
When the high-speed train made its initial journey from Edinburgh last
Monday, only 23 passengers occupied its 400 seats. On Tuesday, there
were four passengers, all of whom joined the train at York.
The Eurostar Link travels to London Waterloo and connects with the
Eurostar service to Paris and Brussels.
A spokesman for Eurostar said yesterday: ''These are obviously early
days. It is very easy to make an early judgment and say, what a waste.
''Let's give this a little time for interest to grow.''
The Eurostar service from London, he said, had been running for seven
months. The company expected this week to pass the 1,500,000 passenger
mark.
''We expect the regional service to pick up and are confident there
will be interest in it.''

Ruth Wishart examines whether local government reorganisation will
result in a disastrous hiatus for arts funding
We could spread the jam very thinly . . . but that's not an appealing
option
FIRST a brief history lesson. Twenty-six years ago 100 intrepid souls
applied to the Scottish Arts Council for a grant. The council, after due
and proper deliberation, decided to award 101 grants.
Last year the number of supplicants had leapt to 2122. In all, they
were after nearly #11m in grants. After due and proper deliberation,
about #4.7m went to some 1284 projects.
Then the revenue clients picked up another #17m plus. As our
colleagues on the other side of the pond are wont to observe, these are
not small potatoes. The arts in Scotland are increasingly big business.
Over the past few years we have seen a rash of surveys into the
economic impact of Scotland's cultural life, from the two which examined
the benefits of Glasgow's 1990 adventure, to the SAC's own investigation
of the arts infrastructure in the Highlands and Islands.
Among other things, this has led to cross-fertilisation between
organisations with common goals, like the agreement jointly to fund arts
officers by the SAC and the Scottish Tourist Board, and the increasing
involvement of the local enterprise companies as facilitators on their
own patches.
The business community as a whole, in fact, has shown an increasingly
high profile in arts sponsorship. Last year they pumped #3.2m directly
into the arts, and #750,000 in kind. Sponsorship now accounts for about
a third of the Edinburgh Festival's budget.
And it is that realisation that the arts are not merely about
nourishing the quality of Scottish life but about hard-nosed economic
opportunity that has steadily pushed up the contribution of the Scottish
local authorities into arts budgets.
Later this month, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities will
send out a survey to all its members attempting to quantify their
current contribution to arts funding in their area. The last time they
conducted such an exercise, for the 1992/93 fiscal year, it emerged that
local government was now the biggest single player in the funding game,
with an annual input of some #35m.
That's what makes it so crucial that the level of commitment is not
diluted by local government reorganisation. Seona Reid, director of the
SAC, says that the early indications they have from contacts with the
new members and officials is that the enthusiasm is undimmed.
''Of course, that only gives us a part of the picture. Obviously the
level of arts funding will depend on whether these new authorities are
facing cuts in their overall budgets, in which case the arts may be
vulnerable.''
Yet David Ferguson, the assistant secretary of Cosla, whose portfolio
of responsibilities covers all the arts, is reasonably optimistic that
most of the new authorities can be kept on board the arts bandwagon.
''We've said all along, of course, that we will lose the economies of
scale that can be enjoyed by regions like Strathclyde. But we are
working very hard to ensure that the new authorities have as much
information as possible about the current funding patterns, so that when
they come to make decisions they will at least have base figures from
which to work.
''And it's not as if they will be starting from scratch. By the time
they are in place they will have had a long period in which to plan. At
the moment, we are suggesting that all the new authorities sit down with
the existing district officials in each area to give them a clear
picture of what has been funded in the past. The Scottish Office is also
issuing guidelines.
''I hope that by the time they come on stream they will be well
prepared. It's true we can't determine what the difference in the budget
allocation might be. But overall I don't think we need be too
downhearted.''
But Cosla's arts clients, particularly those who benefit from support
at regional level, have not found similar reasons to be cheerful. Giles
Havergal, the longstanding artistic director of Glasgow's Citizens'
Theatre, gets 20% of his grant budget from Strathclyde. And #200,000
stripped out of #1.5m leaves a gaping hole in his annual budget.
Havergal has already indicated the scale of his predicament to the
Scottish Office, the Secretary of State, the in-coming authority in
Glasgow and anyone else who will listen. ''Our problem is not just that
we will lose the Strathclyde Season in the summer, which has been
invaluable in giving access to new audiences, including people
disadvantaged for all kinds of reasons -- but in addition to funding
that, Strathclyde now puts #163,000 into our general programme.
''So we find ourselves faced with stark choices. We could spread the
jam very thinly and do work of poorer quality. But that's not an
appealing option, so the alternative must be cutting the number of
productions and performances, which leads inevitably to having to lose
crucial members of staff.
''We have no reason to believe that the new authority will be
unsympathetic. We have always been well supported by Glasgow, who
currently give us #378,000 every year. But in preliminary talks, it has
become quite clear that all the new authorities will have a huge amount
of work to get through initially, sorting out concerns such as the
police, fire and education services.
''I fear that the arts will be pretty low on most people's agenda, and
it may be a year or even two before that aspect of funding is properly
examined. Very few companies can face a hiatus like that and survive.''
The Citizens' has always prided itself on balancing its budget,
pegging its ticket prices and offering the widest possible range of
concessions, including free seating. Giles is a fierce believer that any
theatre in receipt of public funding has a duty to deliver a public
service.
''People say 'well you could always hire your own education officer
and try to put together the same kind of audience Strathclyde aims for
during the season it finances'. But what we are paid to do is put on
theatre -- that is what we do for a living.
''And of course, the whole ethos of the Strathclyde Season has been to
allow people into the theatre free, so while it's an enormously
worthwhile and satisfying project, by definition it is not one which can
generate an income.''
The Citz may be the biggest loser when Strathclyde shuts up shop, but
it's far from being the only one. The range of projects supported by the
region is vast. It funds more than 130 initiatives, from the #7000 it
gives Mull Little Theatre -- its biggest contribution in a budget just
over #50,000 -- to #400 to the Iona Theatre company next door.
It supports a vast number of multi-cultural events like the Glasgow
Mela, and spreads its #2.5m cultural budget throughout its geographical
area. But in addition to giving one-off grants to small events, the
region also had a longstanding commitment to the National Arts Companies
based in Glasgow, or with touring seasons there.
In the current year, for example, Scottish Opera gets more than
#30,000, and the RSNO almost #40,000. That hardly ranks as loose change
in anyone's book-keeping, regardless of overall income. Similarly, the
Edinburgh International Festival, in addition to its #950,000 from
Edinburgh District Council, has enjoyed an input of #350,000 from
Lothian region in the past few years.
And it is the funding of Scotland's major companies which has
engendered the most widespread angst in recent years, and proved one of
the most contentious parts of the Scottish Arts Council's annual awards.
The difficulty lies in the fact that set beside the total available of
some #25m, Scottish Opera's #4,670,290 makes it seem something of a
rogue elephant in the funding park. Add in the #1m now given to the
Scottish Chamber Orchestra, the #1.8m disbursed to the RSNO, and
Scottish Ballet's #2m, and you can readily understand the chagrin of
clients like the Brunton Theatre, when they find their modest #53,500
worth of revenue funding axed as part of the SAC's budget
rationalisation for the current year.
Now, not for the first time, Scottish Opera finds itself in dire
financial straits, despite being the council's biggest beneficiary. It
has already indicated that it needs another #700,000 annually in the
short-term, rising to #1.5m more in order to maintain its current output
and quality. The SAC has said no. And the company is now engaged in
tripartite talks with the RSNO and the SCO to find out if there are ways
in which their orchestral schedules can be harmonised to save money.
Scottish Opera has been down this road before. Both fought tooth and
nail against the proposed merger of Scottish Opera's own orchestra and
the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra. But the unpalatable fact remained
that Scottish Opera's in-house musicians were vastly under-utilised,
despite accounting for 15% of the company's budget, some #1.5m.
Now Richard Jarman, Scottish Opera's director, has embarked on a
programme of additional concerts and performances to try to take up the
slack.
But he acknowledges that while that will make the orchestra more
cost-effective, it won't solve his budget shortfalls, and he freely
concedes that the Robertson-led talks may leave him with more headaches
than solutions, especially if there were to be a suggestion that the
other orchestras replace his own in the pit.
Jarman has long been of the opinion that Scottish Opera sticks out
like a sore funding thumb only because of the way the arts are funded.
If the national companies were funded separately, he says, ''then
compared, say, to the #10m for the National Galleries, we might seem a
positive bargain''.
He accepts that there is currently no realistic chance of the Scottish
Office going down that route, ''but Scotland has to decide whether or
not it wants a national opera company. Of course, you can always save
money by cutting quality, but that is not a route which has any appeal
for me.''
Seona Reid acknowledges that the national companies have to be looked
at in a different light from other clients. ''Obviously they play a
major and vital role in the life of Scotland, and in the nature of that
role they will demand a larger grant.
''But what the SAC must do is ensure that the way in which they are
funded is not to the detriment of all the others. So the major companies
have to operate in the most cost-effective way possible -- and there is
room for improvement -- in order that we do not jeopardise our support
for the small, the young, the new and the innovative, who also deserve
their chance.
''The national companies don't just have a responsibility to their
public, but to the Scottish cultural community as a whole.''
Neither is she enthusiastic about the notion of taking the big boys
off her patch into separate funding arrangements. ''What we are aiming
for is greater integration across the arts. I don't think you could
argue that the fact that the National Galleries are given separate
grants has made them closer to other people in the visual arts field.''
The newest, and potentially most lucrative player in the funding game,
is the National Lottery. Administered by a sub-committee within the SAC,
it's now worth another #18m a year and rising. That is the good news.
The difficulty arises because of the restrictions imposed by the
Government on how it may be spent. And the rules decree that it must go
on capital funding only. So you can apply for help with anything from a
new dance floor to a new building but not for help in running that
refurbished operation.
So if Scotland is to reap maximum benefit from this new resource, some
creative accountancy will need to be allied to some lateral thought. The
SAC has to find some way of using the money for non-capital projects,
without giving the Scottish Office any excuse for thinking it can cut
their core grant and substitute lottery funds.
The answer may lie in thinking in sectors rather than projects; aiming
lottery funds at specifics like improving education and access in the
arts. That would both target money on undernourished areas and help
improve income across the board.
Yet despite all the imponderables over the future of the lottery, the
health of our national companies, and the budgets of the new local
authorities, the arts in Scotland, at least now, seem firmly woven into
the tapestry of the country's economic life.
When Seona Reid recently visited Quebec, she was told: ''Culture is
Quebec's business card.'' Scotland may not yet be at that stage, but we
seem to be working on it.

YARROW Shipbuilders, the Clydeside warship yard, is to tender for the
final batch of Type 23 frigates for the Royal Navy next month in a deal
worth more than #400m.
The only serious competitor for the contract is Vospers, the south of
England shipbuilder which specialises in smaller, missile-armed fast
patrol boats.
Yarrow, the lead yard and designer of the Type 23, has already
delivered six vessels of the class and is completing a further three.
The Clyde shipbuilder hoped to gain a #200m order for four patrol
corvettes for the South African navy earlier this year but a final
decision by that country's cabinet has been put on hold for six months
while a defence committee evaluates future naval needs.
GEC-owned Yarrow and the state-owned Spanish yard Bazan are on the
short-leet for the warships. Both, with government backing, have also
offered 100% offset packages and collaborative ventures to the total
value of the contract.
There have been rumours that German, French, and Danish firms have
undermined the final go-ahead by re-bidding at lower prices. All three
were previously eliminated from the running on grounds of cost or
inferior design.
It appears that senior South African Ministers also oppose spending
scarce resources to provide the country with a ''blue water'' naval
capability when re-housing the occupants of squatter camps has a higher
social and vote-catching priority.
The deal would have helped Yarrow to safeguard the jobs of its 3100
employees through next year in the absence of the delayed RN frigate
batch. Because of the Treasury's squeeze on defence spending, the
original plan to invite tenders for the Type 23s in 1994 was pushed back
to August 15 this year.
However, Yarrow's active pursuit of foreign work may produce other
export prospects.
Iran has bought three former Soviet Kilo-class diesel-electric
submarines -- making it the only Gulf state with a submarine force --
and the implied threat to seaborne oil traffic has made its neighbours
nervous.
Several Gulf countries are now actively seeking bids for
anti-submarine frigates or corvettes to counter the potential problem.
The Royal Navy and the United States have mounted a number of
high-profile patrols by nuclear-powered hunter-killer boats in the area
to dissuade Tehran from exercising its new-found naval power.
In the Far East, the growing row over ownership of the oil-rich
Spratly Islands is also fuelling demand for modern warships. Yarrow is
already in the final stages of fitting out corvettes for Malaysia.
It is almost certain that Yarrow will be the Defence Ministry's first
choice for the initial batch of European anti-aircraft frigates under a
collaborative venture with France and Italy, code-named Project Horizon,
although work on the new generation of warships is not scheduled to
begin before 2002.
Under the terms of the tripartite agreement, Italy will build six of
the vessels, France four, and the UK 12.

Patrick Brogan tells how a nun is fighting for the thousands on
America's Death Row
SISTER Helen Prejean, America's best-known campaigner against the
death penalty, receives an honorary doctorate of law from Glasgow
University today. The BBC will be there, doing a documentary on her for
the Everyman programme. A Hollywood movie is being made of her
best-selling book Dead Man Walking, starring Susan Sarandon.
Sister Helen is a nun, a member of an obscure order in New Orleans, so
she won't let her head be turned by all the attention. The cause is
everything. The United States is obsessed with death and violence, and
she fights the madness with publicity.
She wants to show how arbitrary and unjust the death penalty is, and
therefore how little retribution it provides, how utterly ineffective it
is in deterring crime, how expensive (it costs six times more to execute
a man than to keep him in jail for life), how disgusting and degrading
it is in its application.
There's a long and hard road ahead of her. Every opinion poll shows
that the great majority of Americans approve of the death penalty, and
politicians, from President Clinton down, pander to that majority by
increasing the list of capital offences. New York, which resisted the
death penalty for years, has just restored it, and the new Republican
majority in Congress is ready to pass a Bill, supported by the
President, which will sharply limit the number of appeals a convicted
man may attempt.
One hope of ending executions is through the courts. The Supreme Court
ruled in 1972 that the death penalty was a ''cruel and unusual
punishment'' and therefore banned by the Constitution, because it fell
almost always upon poor black men. The decision spared Charles Manson
and Sirhan Sirhan. States rephrased their capital statutes to give the
appearance of colour-blindness and the executions resumed in 1977 -- but
still the great majority of those executed are poor and black.
About 300 final appeals reach the Supreme Court every year, and though
there is still usually a majority of sentences sustained, it is not
solid by any means.
Sister Helen is not waiting for the courts to revise the law. She is
the guiding spirit of a national effort to change public opinion, and
her best weapons are her own personality and her book.
Dead Man Walking is a harrowing account of her ministry among the
condemned. She writes how she was persuaded to befriend one man
sentenced to death, counselled and comforted him, and then watched him
die.
The book describes his crimes, and the crimes of the other men whom
she also befriended. It's important for those who oppose capital
punishment to face the most horrific criminals, those who rape and
murder children, or those who set bombs in public buildings. Sister
Helen makes no excuses. While she insists that every man should have a
good lawyer who will do his best to ensure that justice is done, she
does not conceal that the men she writes about were brutal murderers.
Glasgow University has a death-penalty project, and every year sends a
dozen or so of its most recent graduates to America to work with the
devoted band of lawyers who are trying to inflect the American system of
justice. This year's crop will get their degrees at the same ceremony
that will give Sister Helen her Ll.D.
They will find that America is a dreadfully violent country, with a
correspondingly barbarous system of punishment. The United States, for
example, is one of only four countries in the world that executes people
under the age of 18. The others are Iran, Iraq and Bangladesh.
Sister Helen devoted herself, also, to the families of the victims.
She found many of them obsessed with retribution. In Louisiana, and in
many other states, close relatives are allowed to attend the executions,
and Sister Helen makes the observation that revenge does not provide
solace.
There are thousands of men on Death Row (and a handful of women), and
the number is increasing far faster than the most active execution
programme could match. It is Sister Helen's hope that the numbers and
the horror of it all will eventually turn public opinion. It must be
said that at this stage rather the reverse is happening. The young
students who go to America to join her fight will find a dark and
depressing reality.

THE Blue Bonnets were on the warpath again yesterday when the story of
a group of royalist prisoners interned in Doune Castle, Perthshire,
during the 1745 Jacobite Rebellion was revived by members of the White
Cockade Society.
Visitors watched the event -- organised by Historic Scotland --
depicting the struggles faced by the prisoners after the government
defeat at the Battle of Falkirk.
Members of the society joined the fray in Highland regalia, complete
with broadswords and targes -- while one of their admiring colleagues
(left) clicked his camera for posterity.

A SCHEME of vaccination and certification to combat the threat of
rabies, proposed by a House of Commons Select Committee, has
insufficient safeguards to protect the UK from an epidemic, the British
Medical Association has warned.
A report recommending the retention of the quarantine system is
published by the BMA's board of science and education today, only days
before the start of one of Scotland's biggest summer tourist
attractions, the Cutty Sark Tall Ships Race, where the threat of rabies
has concerned the authorities.
About one million visitors are expected in Leith between July 15 and
18 and a number of measures have been drawn up, including special animal
health patrols in the port area.
An exercise already has been held to test Lothian region's contingency
plan in view of the possibility of rabid animals being brought ashore.
Hundreds of ships from all over the world, including the QE2 and the
world's biggest sailing ship, Sedov, from Russia, will be in the Forth
estuary.
Race organisers have advised participants not to bring animals with
them or to ensure they are kept on board. They also have been advised to
ensure they are not handled by anyone who might visit any of the boats.
Regional officials have warned that any stray animal found at the
docks by the patrols will be impounded and could spend six months in
quarantine.
In the new report voicing concern about the proposal by the House of
Commons Select Committee on Agriculture, BMA members say the quarantine
system should remain in place until additional protection is built in to
the new proposals to deal with animals coming into the UK from the EU.
The report recommends a set of safeguards that could be put in place.
The BMA says the present British quarantine system has been proved 100%
reliable over more than 20 years and should not be removed without a
satisfactory replacement control system.
''Although the risk of a rabid animal entering the country is small,
the consequences could be disastrous, particularly since there are no
known plans to deal with endemic disease,'' it says.

PLANS have been submitted for the UK's first computer-controlled
security car park in Edinburgh.
It is claimed that the #3m car park would address some of the key
concerns of multi-storey car park users, particularly women, and reduce
the likelihood of assaults and thefts.
The system would involve computerised trolleys, and drivers would sit
in a secure waiting room while their vehicles were delivered to them.
It is hoped the development by Sky Parks, which will lease a site at
the junction of Dewar Place and Torphichen Street, will secure detailed
planning permission by the autumn.
The car park is part of a plan to provide 1450 parking spaces in the
Exchange, the city's new financial district.
Cars are parked by computer-controlled trolleys and there is a
significant reduction of fuel emission in confined areas. There is
closed-circuit TV and video monitoring.
Mr Brian Dunlop, the company's managing director, said safety and
security were the priority.
''The motorist drives into a brightly-lit entry area -- the module --
and leaves the car. The press of a button dispenses a ticket and
activates the computerised trolley and the car is then raised by rollers
for mechanical transfer into the building.
''Once the driver has left the module, the car is electronically
checked to ensure no one is left inside, and a video record of the
vehicle made.''

GLASGOW University has signed a contract to develop the technology
which would allow spacecraft to rendezvous and dock with each other
unmanned.
In a two-and-a-half-year agreement with the European Space Research
and Technology Centre, the department of aerospace engineering will
carry out laboratory work to produce a basic computer programme for
spaceships to follow.
The research will involve the practical application of a simple
mathematical idea, developed by researchers and students at the
department, which would allow spaceships to process sensory information
and plan docking manoeuvres.
Spacecraft computers are around 10 years behind those on earth as they
must be more robust to withstand radiation in outer space.
At present, docking procedures require complex pre-programming on
earth and an astronaut to key in the final commands during the
manoeuvre.
Dr Colin McInnes, who will head the research team, said: ''Using our
method, spacecraft will be able to rendezvous and dock largely unaided.
''This will increase the flexibility of operations and reduce both
astronaut and ground crew workloads.
''Most of such contracts are won through competitive tendering, but
ours was a unique theory.
''It started as some equations I had scribbled on to a piece of paper
three years ago, which we developed because we realised that in the
future spacecraft docking would become a common practice.''
He said that while the contract did not bring substantial finance for
the department, which is the only one of its kind in Scotland, spin-off
contracts and activities would grow if the research was a success.
The Research and Technology Centre plans to use the technology on the
#40bn International Space Station Alpha, assembly of which begins in
1997.
It also plans to start sending ATVs (automated transfer vehicles),
carrying scientific equipment and supplies, to the station by 2001.
It is hoped that the space station will provide a base for research
and development of pharmaceuticals and electrical equipment, whose
purity is enhanced if manufactured in a weightless environment.

WOMEN are losing the battle to close the pay gap, and the situation
has worsened since the abolition of wages councils, Labour's Scottish
Employment spokesman claimed yesterday.
Mr John McFall, MP for Dumbarton, claims the abolition of wages
councils has driven down wages in sectors such as licensed premises and
clothing manufacture -- where women predominate -- and the gap between
male and female earnings was widening to almost 30%.
However, a Government Minister has hit back, claiming that pay had
risen in real terms by more than 6% since the abolition of wages
councils in August 1993 and that the Opposition was distorting the
facts.
New figures issued by the Labour Party show that full-time female
employees in Scotland currently earn 72.7% of male earnings, while in
non-professional classes it is nearer 65%.
For 10 years prior to the abolition of wages councils, the pay gap had
hovered around 26% but had now widened in real terms, claims Labour.
Successes had been few. Last month, nine women specialist teachers won
their fight to prove they should be paid the same as men in principal
teachers' posts with Strathclyde Regional Council, as their duties were
of equal value.
A Glasgow industrial tribunal ruled the work of the nine was of equal
value and continued the case on compensation if a financial settlement
could not be reached. The difference in salary is up to #5000 a year.
Yesterday, Mr McFall accused the Government of being unwilling to
close the pay gap and claimed that current equal pay legislation was
inadequate and overly complicated.
''When the Government was forced, in 1981, by the European Commission
to legislate on equal pay for work of equal value, Lord Denning said of
the procedures set up that no ordinary lawyer could understand them,''
he said.
''This has led to the system which encourages employers to engage in
long, drawn-out legal battles. It takes years to get a decision and the
costs can exceed #100,000 -- it is hardly surprising that only around 20
cases are brought each year.''
He claimed the Government was content to keep the pay differential
intact, adding that this hardened the need for a minimum wage.
However, Trade and Industry Minister Philip Oppenheim -- who has
responsibility for wages and industrial relations -- hit back, claiming
that wages councils were inflexible to the changing needs of the labour
market and reduced competitiveness.
He said that far from reducing pay levels, wages in sectors formerly
covered by wages councils had risen by 6.3% since abolition.

A ROW has broken out over plans to build a memorial to the atomic bomb
victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on a site overlooking the Faslane
nuclear submarine base.
The stone memorial, which its backers originally hoped to have erected
by August 6 -- the 50th anniversary of the Hiroshima bomb -- has
received widespread support among the anti-nuclear lobby but the
condemnation of British veterans of the Second World War Far East
campaign.
The idea for the memorial at a picnic site on the Glen Fruin road was
conceived by Rhu councillor Iain Macdonald and is now undergoing a
feasibility study by Strathclyde Regional Council.
A spokesman for the council told The Herald that the plans were in an
early stage as officials investigated the legal implications and
ownership rights of the picnic site, which lies off a road built by the
MoD for its operations at Coulport and has been recently adopted by the
regional council.
''Whatever the outcome, I doubt if this thing can get planning
permission and be built by the 50th anniversary next month,'' he added.
The plans follow proposals by two survivors of the American A-bomb
attacks on Japan in 1945 to plant a cherry tree as a memorial to the
victims at the peace camp outside the Faslane submarine base as part of
a visit to the UK organised by CND.
Last night, a spokesman for CND Scotland said the memorial project on
the Glen Fruin road had received its full support and claimed that the
site was particularly appropriate.
''It is to remind us that there should be no more Hiroshimas anywhere
in the world and that we should never threaten anyone with these
appalling weapons of mass destruction,'' he said.
However, the British and Commonwealth Occupation Forces of Japan
(BCOFJ) are outraged at the proposal for the memorial.
Mr Ashley Cunningham-Booth MBE, an author and chief executive of
BCOFJ, asked why the same amount of effort and enthusiasm had not been
put into constructing a memorial for the victims of Japanese war-time
atrocities.
''I find it incredible that people can sponsor support for this sort
of thing when there is no physical evidence of a memorial to British men
who lost their lives as prisoners of war of these people,'' he said.
The proposed memorial has also brought the outrage of the Burma
Veterans Association, whose spokesman described the plans as
''abhorrent''.
It's better to have a memorial to the poor buggers who died at their
hands,'' the spokesman said.
* A SCOTTISH Labour MP has hit out at 150% increases in Ministry of
Defence charges for war widows requesting photographs of the graves of
their husbands killed by the Japanese.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, MP for Edinburgh South, has called for a change in
the Royal Charter to fund requests for war grave photographs, whose
costs have risen from #6 to #15 each.
Mr Griffiths claims the increase is due to a cost-cutting exercise by
the MoD but the Government says the charges are a matter for the
Commonwealth War Graves Commission.

RYAN has replaced Andrew as the most popular boy's name in Scotland
for 1994, according to a survey by the Registrar General.
The survey, released today, attributes Ryan's rise to the popularity
of the Manchester United winger Ryan Giggs.
Among girls, Lauren became the most popular choice, replacing Emma
which was third, with Rebecca placed second.
Megan is the new addition to the girls' top 10, with Shannon the
highest climber.
However, the Deputy Registrar General for Scotland, Mr Brian Philip,
said: ''It should be noted that even the most popular names have quite a
small market share. Ryans and Laurens are only three per cent of the
31,000 boys and 30,000 girls born last year.
''There seems no danger that forenames in Scotland will become
predictable and boring.''
The full top tens are:
Boys: 1 Ryan, 2 Andrew, 3 Scott, 4 David, 5 Michael, 6 James, 7
Jordan, 8 Christopher, 9 Ross, 10 Craig.
Girls: 1 Lauren, 2 Rebecca, 3 Emma, 4 Amy, 5 Sarah, 6 Laura, 7

POLICE yesterday were investigating how two men died under the wheels
of a coach when a stag party turned into a violent battle outside a
greyhound stadium.
The men were crushed when the coach lurched through a missile-hurling
crowd at Meadowcroft Stadium in Stainforth, Doncaster, south Yorkshire,
after a ''serious disturbance'' inside.
In an attempt to escape the midnight fracas, some people boarded the
waiting coach, which was then surrounded by an angry mob as missiles,
including beer barrels, bottles, and bricks, rained in.
Fighting first broke out in a bar at the stadium as about 35 young men
on a stag night from Scunthorpe confronted others from Doncaster, towns
with a history of rivalry.
Detective Superintendent Les Agar told a news conference that the
Scunthorpe party arrived at the stadium at about 7pm and went for a
drink at the King George pub opposite.
They returned at about 10pm but there was no trouble until closing
time when, Mr Agar said, a fight broke out in an upstairs bar between a
man from Scunthorpe and a ''local''.
''This was broken up by security staff who were then confronted by a
large group of the Scunthorpe party armed with bottles,'' he said.
''The melee continued as the group was forced into the car park. As
the Scunthorpe contingent were trying to get on the coach, empty
45-gallon drums, bricks, and bottles were thrown at it.
''Several windows were smashed on both sides and, as the bus pulled
away still under attack, the driver was forced to reverse to get out,''
Mr Agar said.
''One unconscious man had to be dragged from the path of the coach as
it was reversing. It was when the vehicle lurched forward again that the
two men, standing close together, were hit.''
Police said one of the dead men was Mr Phillip Hodson, 29, of Dryden
Road, Scunthorpe, who was married and had two children aged three and
six.
The other has yet to be named but was believed to be about 35 and also
from Scunthorpe.
They had suffered multiple injuries and a post-mortem examination was
due to be carried out at Doncaster Royal Infirmary.
Mr Agar added: ''Until then, this incident is being treated as a
tragic accident.''
Thirty police had been called to the scene and twice that number began
detailed inquiries yesterday.
The coach driver, who is not being named but was said to be ''deeply
shocked'', was questioned for two hours but was not charged and was
released on police bail.
Everyone on the coach was taken to Stainforth police station for
interview but no-one was arrested, Mr Agar said. It was believed several
other people suffered minor injuries but had not come forward.
Mr Agar appealed to anyone with information about the violence to
contact the police.

VANDALS are being blamed for causing the death of a handicapped man
who was electrocuted in a public lavatory.
Mr Glen Pelmear, 33, was killed when he sat on the toilet in an
all-metal cubicle which had been ''electrified'' by a broken light
fitting.
Police in Ryde on the Isle of Wight found his body slumped in a
cubicle on Saturday night with sparks still showering from him.
They say they are certain the light had been deliberately vandalised
and warned that anyone arrested for the incident could find themselves
facing a manslaughter charge.
Mr Pelmear, who lived in a residential care home for adults with
learning difficulties at Ryde, was certified dead at the scene.
Ryde police spokesman, Inspector Mark Hanson, said the broken light
fitting had earthed with the all-metal public lavatory, turning it into
a live circuit.
He added: ''The man who raised the alarm was standing in the toilets
when Mr Pelmear walked in. He tells us Mr Pelmear walked straight into
the cubicle, shut the door, and then almost immediately there was a loud
cracking sound and sparks.
''The fitting has been examined and we have concluded that an act of
criminal damage took place.

Rangers complete a major coup today with the signing of Paul
Gascoigne. But, as CAROL CLEWLOW writes, they may get more than they
bargained for with his alter-ego Gazza known as a trouble-attracting
joker
AS AN example of that special brand of self-congratulatory elitism
which pervades the British justiciary, there had been nothing like it
since the jury in the Lady Chatterley trial was asked if they really
wanted their servants to read the book.
''Who is Gazza?'' asked Mr Justice Harman.
It was September 1990 and the High Court was hearing an application
for an injunction by Paul Gascoigne Ltd against Penguin Books to prevent
the publication of an unauthorised biography.
Gazza's counsel explained that Paul Gascoigne was ''a very well-known
footballer . . .''
''Rugby or association football?'' inquired the judge.
A football writer, welcoming Paul Gascoigne Ltd back into the England
squad for last month's Umbro Cup, said there had never been a problem
with Gascoigne. It was Gazza that had caused all the trouble.
In the 1990 World Cup that made the man, it was Gascoigne who dropped
the ball with seemingly effortless precision over the heads of the wall
of Belgium defenders and on to Platt's boot and so into goal to put
England into the next round.
It was Gascoigne who executed what England manager Bobby Robson
afterwards called the 30-yard ''radar pass'' in the Cameroon game, which
gave the ball to Lineker, and which produced, via a penalty, the winning
goal.
It was Gazza though who, in tabloid speak, wept his way into the
hearts of a nation in the England versus West Germany match, as his
hopes of playing in a possible final plummeted with the rise of the
referee's arm.
And it was unquestionably Gazza atop the England bus on the return
home, two yellow cards not withstanding, grinning widely above the
ultimate bad taste tie-on plastic boobs.
He was 23, a World Cup hero and a darling of the tabloids, always a
dangerous occupation.
In one sense, there was logic to the judge's question, Who is Gazza?
Or perhaps it should have been, What is Gazza? A media construct, or a
living, breathing reality.
''I hate the press,'' Gazza once told a TV crew, brushing them aside.
They were understandably bemused. He'd just spent a morning painted up
and posed in a clown's outfit for the Daily Mirror.
If a week is a long time in politics, then five years is an aeon in
terms of what is, after all, tomorrow's fish-and-chip wrapping. So it's
hard now to imagine the horror of a nation when Gazza extended his
tongue as the TV camera lingered on him that extra second during a 1990
World Cup pre-match National Anthem.
''He was a kid . . . not yet grown up. He just thought it was funny,''
said Bobby Robson afterwards, with that shake of the head, but certain
exasperated affection in the eye which seemed to appear at the mention
of the word Gazza.
''I had to tell him . . . listen . . . you just can't do that.''
It was the japes that did it for him, not the girls. There was
surprisingly little of that ''my nights with Gazza stuff''. More
important were the nights boozing with the boys -- including one
occasion when he went skittering across a Newcastle nightclub floor on
his kneecap five months after rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament
in an on-field tackle.
Just who exactly was at fault in the fracas was a truth never clearly
established. But it didn't matter, because the big question was why a
millionaire footballer with the world at his twinkling feet should want
to spend the day boozing in a grotty working-man's club with his old
mates, and thereafter trawling some of Newcastle's less salubrious
nightspots.
A subsequent, possibly important, question was how he could be dumb
enough to think, given that he was, that the world would allow him to
get away with it.
There was a naive honesty in his explanation though, a sad perverse
decency, too.
''I've had my friends since I was at Newcastle,'' he told the Sun.
''I can't say, 'that's it now. I'm a star, sorry lads, you're nothing,
now **** off'.''
But there would be no more Bigg Market Saturday nights. The Half Moon
had been his Road to Damascus.
''I've come to realise I can't be one of the lads anymore,'' he said.
''You can't win,'' he said, articulating, as well as anyone, the
essence, and the price, of fame.
''I get on a train and sit in second class and people think, 'tight
bastard. Money he's got and he sits in second class.' So I think, '****
them' and I go in first class and then they say, 'look at that ****ing
flash bastard in first class'.''
Someone said, ''Fame is a mask that eats the face''. I don't know who,
although I've done my damnedest to find out. Still it's too good a quote
to discard in relation to Gazza.
The Gazza gallery is full of masks, all grinning, Father Christmas,
the mud-covered charity hero, the birthday boy with cake all over his
face.
The weirdest one is the pink thing they gave him after he fractured a
cheek in the England versus Holland match in April 1993.
He liked it. He wanted to wear it all the time, this eternal jester.
He thought it made him look like the Phantom of the Opera. Only he was
playing for Lazio by then and no-one seemed to get the joke. It was
eventually stolen from the dressing-room by a fan during a training
session. Like an icon. Or a relic.
Because that, of course, is the way they feel about their football in
Italy. When they kiss their medals before the match, the two great
passions, the two great underpinnings of life come together.
Lazio management called Gazza ''the saviour we've been waiting for''
when he arrived. To understand the full significance of this, you have
to remember that, in response to a less-than-satisfactory season, the
fans were stoning the coach's car. Making clear what might be expected
of him, and possibly how, management also called him ''the new
Madonna''.
It's oft-quoted, but still useful to be reminded of Ian Rush's comment
after his failure to score enough goals for Juventus. He said playing in
Italy was like playing in a foreign country. Pull the quote apart and
and it says nothing. Put it back together, and in the mouth of an
English player, and it says all that needs to be said.
In the end Gazza played only 51 games during three seasons for the
Italian side.
He continued to be prime tabloid fodder during his stay there, at
first establishing a degree of domestic harmony, later seeing it
disintegrate. He also broke his leg again. But now he's home and signing
for Rangers today for a reported #5m.
Meanwhile, the football writers are busy wondering if the famous Gazza
psyche can take some serious football. It's that famous nervous
twitching energy which does the damage, which gets him into trouble both
on and off the field, and at the same time into the papers.
It's spawned a number of theories, the most bizarre that he suffers
from Tourette syndrome. Bobby Robson, though, retiring as England
manager, had a simpler explanation.
He said that Gazza wanted to win more than anyone. He wanted to be a
star, a match-winner. And in pursuit of that he wanted to do everything.
''He wants to do the throw-ins, the corners, the free-kicks. He wants
to paint the white lines, put the nets up, blow the whistle . . .''
He also said Paul Gascoigne, not Gazza please note, was ''the most
exciting, the most brilliant footballer I had working with me in eight
years in the national team''.

JEAN Irwin, who died aged 90 on July 4, was an inspiring force in the
world of art.
From the early 1940s to the mid 1960s, she was an education officer
for Glasgow Art Gallery and Museum at Kelvingrove.
She also taught costume classes at Glasgow School of Art and to drama
students.
An accomplished painter herself, she exhibited consistently for 50
years.
However, she was probably best known for her work in establishing and
running a Saturday morning art class for children in Kelvingrove Art
Gallery.
Her ability to bring out the creativity of young people was legendary.
She used music, movement, and storytelling to evoke responses. Above
all, she looked and listened for the natural talent that lay within each
student and pushed them to use it to the full.
Many Glasgow artists, including Alasdair Gray and George Devlin, began
their careers in her class.
In 1963, she was awarded an MBE for her service to art education.
She lived in Milngavie and was actively involved with the work of the
Lillie Gallery and Milngavie Art Club.
* Mr David Douglas, a former senior reporter with The Glasgow Herald
in its Edinburgh office, has died. He was 88. Mr Douglas covered the
Scottish Office and the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland for
many years.
He was previously chief reporter of The Bulletin in George Outram's
Edinburgh office.
After retiring in 1971, he lived in Cupar, Fife. He was predeceased by
his wife, Betty, and is survived by their two daughters.
* One of Scotland's top cricket groundsmen, Mr Andy Smith, died at the
weekend after a short illness.
Mr Smith, who was 63, had been in charge at Langloan in Drumpellier
for 10 years, following a distinguished career in the police force.

<HEADLINE>Downing Street denies Chancellor's job was offered for support of Major. Heseltine now 'the power behind throne'</HEADLINE>

DEPUTY Prime Minister Michael Heseltine yesterday confirmed he will be
the power behind the throne in Mr Major's reshuffled Government, with
extensive access to influence policy behind closed doors in all
departments.
But his attempt to reassure nervous Cabinet colleagues of his good
intentions, with pledges of trust and non-intervention, was marred by
persistent rumours that the Prime Minister had offered to make him
Chancellor in exchange for his support in the leadership contest.
Reports in several of yesterday's newspapers, led by the Sunday Times,
claimed Mr Major had suggested that Mr Heseltine and Chancellor Kenneth
Clarke ''swop jobs'' just days before last Tuesday's leadership ballot,
but the plan was abandoned after Mr Clarke warned such a move would
panic the City.
Mr Heseltine categorically denied that any deal had been done, but the
strength of the rumours were enough yesterday to prompt the Downing
Street press office to issue a statement dismissing the reports as
''complete fiction''.
''The Prime Minister never contemplated it or suggested it to either
of them,'' a spokeswoman said. ''The quotes in the Sunday Times are
invented. The alleged sources who confirmed the story -- if indeed they
exist -- are making up comments on subjects they couldn't possibly know
about.''
The new First Secretary and Deputy Prime Minister, who has moved
swiftly to install himself in the Cabinet Office with immediate access
to Downing Street, emphasised yesterday he would do nothing to embarrass
his Cabinet colleagues in public.
Other Cabinet Ministers are reportedly angry at the extent of Mr
Heseltine's influence, which stretches across Whitehall and encompasses
membership of almost all Cabinet committees. Tory right-wingers fear Mr
Heseltine's influence will serve as a power base for the Tory left.
''Influencing policy behind closed doors is very much a part of the
responsibility that I have,'' he told BBC1's On The Record programe.
''What I'm not in the business of doing is letting down my colleagues.
''You can exercise more influence if your colleagues trust you, than
if they don't. The worst thing that could happen is if colleagues felt I
was trying to steal the limelight, trying to undermine their position,
trying to make them do policy changes they don't want to do, all that
would do would be to close the doors of Whitehall.''
Asked if he had been given the post in exchange for instructing his
supporters to vote for Mr Major, Mr Heseltine said: ''There was never,
at any time, any suggestion, any hint, any thought, any wish to bring
about that.''
Joining the denials, party chairman Brian Mawhinney, said: ''I don't
believe the Prime Minister did backstage deals with anyone. He has
reconstructed his Government in the way he wished to do,'' he told BBC
Radio.
But Labour refused to accept the Government's assurances and insisted
Mr Major had bought Mr Heseltine's support. Shadow Home Secretary Jack
Straw said he had watched a Heseltine supporter attempt to persuade an
undecided MP to abstain in the vote.
''Everybody knows there was a deal. Heseltine's people were going
around trying to secure abstentions. There's absolutely no question of
that. I'm a witness to one such attempt. There is every reason to
believe that Heseltine held his people back until late on Tuesday, until
he had secured the deal.''
As for Mr Heseltine's new title of First Secretary, it was ''redolent
of some decaying communist politburo stuffed full of the tired, the old,
and the treacherous,'' Mr Straw said.
Also in his interview, Mr Heseltine struck a tough line on Europe. The
only form of ''give and take'' the Government would contemplate in
negotiations for next year's inter-governmental conference on the follow
up to the Maastricht Treaty was ''they give and we take'', he said.
He endorsed the Prime Minister's policy of deferring a decision on a
single European curency until the matter had to be decided, and refused
to give any ground on his opposition to a referendum on monetary union.
''I've always believed in the sovereignty of Parliament,'' he said.
He also refused to join in the call for immediate tax cuts as a way of
reassuring the electorate before a General Election. He said a balance
needed to be struck between the aspirations of the people and the need
to reduce Government expenditure, but that he favoured finding ways of
reducing spending.

THE battle to represent Labour in the new Govan seat -- which has
already seen allegations of a dirty tricks campaign -- took a new twist
yesterday when a second Labour MP declared his candidacy.
Mr Jimmy Dunnachie, MP for Glasgow Pollok, threw his hat into the ring
with a terse letter to Mr Jack McConnell, Scottish Labour's general
secretary.
His declaration will make the contest a three-cornered fight, pitching
him against Mr Mike Watson, MP for Glasgow, the Central constituency
which will vanish under the boundary review, and Mr Mohammed Sarwar, a
Glasgow district councillor seeking to become Scotland's first Muslim
MP.
Mr Dunnachie said in his letter: ''Having given due consideration to
the changes to the Glasgow seats by the Parliamentary Boundary
Commission I now wish to announce formally the decision I have reached.
''Since approximately one third of the existing Glasgow Pollok seat
becomes part of the new Glasgow Govan seat, I wish to exercise my right
to contest Glasgow Govan rather than Glasgow Pollok in the forthcoming
parliamentary selections.''
Last night Mr Dunnachie, 64, who has held Glasgow Pollok since 1987,
was unavailable for comment. His wife said he did not wish to add to the
statement in the letter.
His decision leaves the field clear for Mr Ian Davidson, MP for Govan,
who decided last year to fight the reformed Pollok seat against Mr
Dunnachie. His redrawn Govan seat largely goes into the new Pollok seat.
Most observers had reckoned that Mr Davidson, a member of the
Manufacturing, Science and Finance Union, and sponsored by the
Co-operative Party, would prove too powerful for Mr Dunnachie with most
of his seat being decanted into Pollok.
Last year Mr Watson claimed he had been the victim of a ''dirty tricks
campaign'' aimed at damaging his attempts to win the candidacy for the
new Govan seat which stretches from Drumoyne to Shawlands.
Mr Watson blamed Mr Sarwar's supporters for spreading rumours that he
was either about to join the SNP or challenge Mr George Galloway for the
new Kelvin seat.
Mr Watson said he was sure that Mr Sarwar, whom he described as a nice
man, was not responsible.
Mr Sarwar, a millionaire Pakistani cash and carry owner, denied that
his team had spread any stories about Mr Watson.
Both Mr Watson and Mr Sarwar were unavailable for comment last night.
* Scottish Labour Front Benchers and the SNP have criticised Social
Security Secretary Peter Lilley over reports that he was considering
proposals for localised dole payments.
The plans could lead to claimants in different parts of the country
receiving different levels of unemployment benefit.
Mr Donald Dewar, Labour's social security spokesman, said he would be
surprised if the moves were introduced but added that if the reports
were true the system would be met with a ''storm of protest''.
Mrs Margaret Ewing, SNP parliamentary leader, said: ''People in low
paid areas, such as the north of Scotland, would be disadvantaged.''

THE LARGEST Highlands estate currently on the market extends to 48,210
acres, at offers over #3m.
Magnificent Corrour Estate, pictured above, is in one of the most
remote and unspoilt areas of Scotland, in Inverness-shire, some 30 miles
from Fort William.
The estate is owned by Pollok and Corrour Ltd, a private company
offshoot from the Maxwell dynasty that has held control of the
impressive 1018-acre Pollok estate in Glasgow for more than 700 years.
Great acreages of Scotland remain the property of titled and wealthy
Scottish families despite the many stories focusing on Dutch
millionaires or Arab sheiks buying up the land.
A new laird for Corrour, and the potential impact for those who work
such a vast tract of land, suggests ownership and tenure will be
destined to climb the political agenda.
The sales brochure reveals that there are three full-time
stalker-gamekeepers employed on the estate. All live in houses under a
service occupancy.
The brochure declares: ''They have an in-depth knowledge of the estate
and its sportings and the sellers would highly recommend them to the
purchaser.''
Head stalker Ted Piggot, and his wife Theresia, have worked at Corrour
for 15 years, and live in a five-bedroomed stone house built in the
1890s. The house is included in the sale, along with the much smaller
cottages occupied by under-keepers' Stephen Carpenter and David Duncan.
Corrour Estate, one of Scotland's best known deer forests, also
includes 1,143 acres of commercial forestry. There is red and roe deer
stalking, grouse shooting, and trout fishing, plus seven-bedroomed lodge
with three bathrooms and two reception rooms -- one of four holiday
homes on the estate which cost up to #900-a-week to rent.
The Stirling Maxwell family purchased Corrour in 1890, five years
before the West Highland railway line was opened.
The old lodge burned down in 1942, with only the chapel and
outbuildings intact. The new lodge emerged on the same site, looking
down Loch Ossian, in 1959.
Although the largest sporting real estate on the market, it is not the
most expensive.
Fishings for a two mile double bank beat at Boleside on the River
Tweed are available for #4m. The sale covers 55-acres, includes 11
pools, and a fisherman's cottage and fishing house.
Meanwhile, the sprawling 16,500 acre Knoydart Peninsula in
Inverness-shire has gone on the market for #1.25m.
Surrey property developer sold Knoydart estate in 1993 for #1.7m to
Scottish jute company Titaghur, whose chairman is Reg Brealey, chairman
of Sheffield United.
He wanted to create a ''boot camp'' for deprived youths from inner
cities, but planning consent was refused after objections by local
residents.

At home with the Rifkinds: it was Malcolm Rifkind's first weekend as
Foreign Secretary. Lesley Duncan met the man behind the diplomatic image
-- and the woman behind the man
THE new Foreign Secretary was having a surprisingly relaxing Saturday,
with a constituency surgery in the morning, a visit to relatives in the
afternoon, and dinner with friends in the evening. True, the first red
dispatch box had arrived at lunchtime. But Malcolm Rifkind doesn't
foresee any great change in his lifestyle. ''Looking at Douglas Hurd's
diary, which I've inherited, it seems to be not all that different from
the diary I've had the last three years,'' he says.
But there is a bonus to future foreign visits. ''What I won't have to
concern myself with are guards of honour when I get there! That's the
fate of Defence Ministers.''
One suspects that the diplomatic Mr Rifkind will be glad to abjure the
macho photo-opportunities of his former role. He never did look his best
dangling from helicopters. He recalls, ''When I became Defence Minister
one of my parliamentary colleagues said, 'You will enjoy the Ministry of
Defence. They spoil their Ministers and make them feel heroic.' So you
fly in a Tornado or go in a submarine. But these days are over now. From
now on I shall be eating for my country.'' He produces this punch line
poker-faced. His tendency to laugh at his own jokes is an endearing
trait.
It was his first weekend as Foreign Secretary and he was back in his
Edinburgh home -- a pleasant stone house in the lee of Arthur's Seat.
Yellow climbing roses relieve its grey. The model hedgehog on the
doorstep does not imply any prickliness on the part of its owner.
In spite of the demands of his new role, he intends to keep Edinburgh
as his base. ''I was born and bred here, and it would be intolerable to
be stuck in the South all the time. London's my workplace, Edinburgh's
my home, and one always prefers being at home,'' he pronounces firmly.
As for Chevening, the Kent country house which was left by Lord
Stanhope many years ago to be used as a residence by Foreign
Secretaries, he points out, ''It is run by a charitable trust and I'm
relieved to say that the taxpayer does not pay a penny towards it.''
There is, in addition, the Foreign Secretary's flat -- ''a very modest
flat actually, in Carlton Gardens''.
The sitting-room of his Edinburgh house is civilised rather than
grand. Sporting prints and family pictures decorate the walls. There is
a portrait of Rifkind himself by the Stirlingshire artist Anne
Mackintosh and a delightful pastel study of the two Rifkind children,
Caroline and Hugo -- now young adults -- done this Easter by an artistic
next-door neighbour as a surprise for their father.
His parental pride is obvious. ''My daughter has just graduated from
Durham University and is due to go to Zimbabwe on an Operation Raleigh
exercise. My son has just finished school and is hoping to go to
university.''
Zimbabwe has, of course, many associations for the Rifkinds. It is
where Malcolm Rifkind met his wife in the 60s, when he lectured there
for two years.
Edith Rifkind is a zoologist by training. After studying at King's
College, London, she worked for the Ministry of Agriculture in Rhodesia
in some esoterically-labelled research (Malcolm Rifkind declines to
attempt a spelling) and, after they married, lectured in biology at
Napier College, Edinburgh, then worked in medical research. For the past
few years she has been looking after her husband's Commons constituency
correspondence.
Malcolm Rifkind is the first Jewish Foreign Secretary for 50 years (he
would describe himself as a believer without being ''observant'', thinks
his wife). A London broadsheet last week quoted his Israeli relations at
length. An aunt recalled attending his circumcision ceremony when he was
eight days old -- a bit below the belt, that.
Malcolm Rifkind takes it all in good part. One of the main sources
quoted was a cousin who had been born and brought up in Edinburgh. ''My
cousin rang me last night and said it was all a mistake,'' says the
Foreign Secretary. ''He had been telephoned by some people who said they
were from the Telegraph and he thought they meant the Jerusalem
Telegraph!''
His Glasgow relations include a doctor cousin and an aunt, his
father's sister. ''My father was one of 10, five sons and five
daughters,'' he says. ''I'm afraid I have 19 first cousins -- most of
whom live in Scotland.''
Asked whether it was heartening that the Tories had chosen someone of
his background for Foreign Secretary, he parries deftly: ''A party that
has managed to choose Ted Heath and Margaret Thatcher and John Major,
one after the other, as its leaders -- all of whom have very modest
backgrounds -- is a party of opportunity. It's only the Labour Party
that chooses public schoolboys!''
Malcolm Rifkind lists walking, reading, and field sports as his
recreations. So walking where and reading what? He chuckles. ''Walking
is quite often up that mountain you see behind our house.'' (Arthur's
Seat hardly qualifies as a Munro.) ''But also just where we happen to be
at the time. The great thing about walking is the telephone can't
ring.'' Reading is a mixture of novels and biographies.
The field sports are ''mostly shooting but I do a bit of stalking and
occasionally my son takes me fishing. It's great because it gets you
totally away from your normal tasks and responsibilities and you see
some glorious Scottish countryside. It also reminds you of the
significance of the seasons.''  And is the new Foreign Secretary a
linguist? ''Not very much,'' he replies. ''English? Not bad. French? I
can read French and understand French if someone is speaking clearly and
slowly -- which normally means they are not a Frenchman. Otherwise my
languages, I'm afraid, are rather poor. I'm a typical British
politician. A typical Briton for that matter. I'm thoroughly ashamed of
my poor foreign languages. I shall endeavour to improve my French. I
also understand American -- which comes in quite handy!''
Does he see himself as Scottish, British, or North British, or all of
these things simultaneously? ''The great virtue of the United Kingdom is
that one's able to feel each of these identities,'' he responds. ''I'm
not sure about the North British. That used to be a rather fine hotel,
and even that's changed its name, sadly in my view. But, no, I think one
is Scottish and British and there's no contradiction between the two --
and long may it be so!'' Mrs Rifkind has meanwhile arrived, tired after
a shopping expedition, but hospitably proffering coffee.
''It's her turn,'' says the Foreign Secretary of his wife. ''Are you
knackered?'' he asks her solicitously, before they go into the back
garden -- a sunny spot with a large weeping ash and rather overgrown
lawn -- to be photographed. He threatens to tickle her to make her
smile. Then goes off to unload the shopping.
Edith Rifkind already has the art of diplomacy at her fingertips.
Asked how she views her new hostess role, she says, ''It's just
something I'll really have to play by ear.'' As for continuing as her
husband's constituency secretary, she thinks she will have time, but
again adds, ''I'll just have to see how things develop.''
She has a number of other interests. She's on the court of the new
Napier University, where she taught 25 years ago. She has also been
involved for five years with the Scottish Dementia Appeal -- a trust
that raises money for Alzheimer Scotland Action on Dementia -- and is
helping to organise a fund-raising function for it at the Scottish
National Portrait Gallery in September.
Are her personal tastes similar to her husband's? ''Oh yes, I think
so,'' she says, adding -- a little ruefully perhaps -- that while a man
who has a demanding job is at leisure when he's not working, a woman who
works always has other things to do in house and garden.

A NEW influx of foreign lairds is set to take over significant chunks
of Scotland.
The market for sporting estates is especially on the up after years in
crisis because of the recession.
But the Seventies' wave of controversial Dutch buyers is unlikely to
be repeated. The new landowners are rising from the Far East as UK-based
selling agents cast their nets ever wider to obtain the highest possible
purchase prices.
The Pacific Rim potential to outbid UK-based conservation interests
for large tracts of land in particular -- coupled with fears that no
community involvement in their management will be offered -- is destined
to spark fresh debate over ownership and tenure in Scotland.
Hong Kong is fertile ground for sales of Scottish land as the wealthy
in the colony seek escape routes should Britain's 1997 handover to China
prove a disaster.
But this time around, main concerns in Scotland may switch from
foreigners' interests to questions of the land use and tenure.
One in three hunting, shooting, and fishing estates are already in the
hands of offshore, often faceless, interests.
Many others remain in the hands of Scotland's very own aristocratic
families, or are literally the playthings of rich, absentee lairds who
buy on a whim and sell through bordedom or stretched finances.
As our graph shows that the value of Scottish sporting estates peaked
in 1990, with the crash that followed dramatic. It also suggests that
only those who bought at the peak and sold afterwards will have lost
money; that those who moved in earlier, buying low and selling high,
will have made fortunes.
The booming market burst as the recession deepened. By late 1992 some
30 sporting estates were for sale, totalling more than 300,000 acres --
some 1.6% of Scotland's land mass.
There were few takers in the glut caused by owners trying to dispose
of the toys to realise assets and protect their other interests. Some
estates were even withdrawn from the market because offers were so
paltry.
The for sale saga surrounding American-owned, 77,500-acre Mar Lodge on
Deeside, a jewel in the Cairngorms crown, was settled only in May --
thanks to National Lottery money made available to the National Trust
for Scotland.
The Worldwide Fund for Nature, Scotland, described Mar Lodge's
purchase for the nation as excellent news because the estate ''would no
longer by subject to the Russian roulette of the international property
market.''
However, as the economy picks up, so does that foreign market. Growing
competition from abroad could bring to end end recent victories in land
purchases by such conservation groups as the Royal Society for the
Protection of Birds, the John Muir Trust, and the National Trust.
Sporting estates -- which crofters' activists hoped had seen their
day, with more constructive use of the land being made -- are clearly on
the comeback trail. The market may not yet be trouble free, but it has
been recovering steadily since 1993.
Purchase prices of Highland estates tend not to be based on the land
value but on the price that people are willing to pay to catch the
salmon or stags on the property.
In 1990, that charge worked out at almost #15,000 per fish and #30,000
a deer. Today's values are down by about half on these figures, but are
rising as the economy recovers.
The playboys with large amounts of disposeable income are again likely
to move in, suggesting a return to the days of public focus on takeovers
by colourful and bizarre personalities such as Dutchman Johannes
Hellinga.
Arabs and wealthy Americans will also play a role, again detracting
from the central economic, social, cultural, and environmental issues of
land ownership in Scotland.
But many of the foreign lairds will come from further afield. Numerous
selling agents have learned lessons from the 1990 crash, and now trawl
the world for potential buyers of real estate.
It is estimated that there are 19 Scottish estates of between 1100 and
48,000 acres for sale today. Only eight have been advertised. The others
are available ''if the price is right.'' The 19 estates total 194,000
acres -- 1% of Scotland's land mass.
Mr Charles Dudgeon, of Savills, who confirmed offers were rejected in
1990 because prices were so low, said that the market was now
''normal,'' with buyers generally to be found. He observed: ''The supply
of buyers is not a deluge, but there is usually competition at the
closing date.''
Mr Dudgeon said that people in Hong Kong were emerging as major
players in Scottish land purchases, and that they had a ''phenomenal
amount'' of money to spend.
He predicted their strategy of having property interests worldwide
will have ''a huge impact on the UK and Scotland.'' Far Eastern interest
in Scotland, from sporting estates to hotels and golf courses, embraces
Singapore, Thailand, and Taiwan as well as Hong Kong.
Nearer home, demand for Scottish property is growing in Scandinavian
countries. Their interest is often benevolent, with strong interest in
wildlife conservation, although their input often relies heavily upon
exchange rates. The Middle East is likely to remain a happy hunting
ground, where purchases can be made purely on the whim of a sheikh.
''We are casting our net wider,'' said Mr Dudgeon. ''We cannot ignore
foreign markets. At the end of the day, we have to be able to say to
clients we have searched every nook and cranny for a buyer at the best
possible price.''
Mr Andrew Rettie, of Edinburgh-based selling agents Strutt and Parker,
confirmed growing Pacific Rim interest in Scottish estates, but added
that in the past year he has also dealt with buyers from America,
Belgium Denmark, Germany, Holland, Italy, Norway, Spain, and Sweden.
He forecast the market will be more exaggerated than ever before --
one of peaks and troughs, as and when people have the ready cash to put
down.
Mr Rettie said: ''The market took off in 1989-90 when the economy was
going full bore and people had a lot of disposeable income. Prices were
phenomenal. Estates doubled in price.
''Then the market changed course because of the recession. But it is
now starting now to come out, and appears to be recovering.''
He was adamant: ''It is not the case that foreigners are buying all
the land. The emotive headlines that Scotland is being bought by
foreigners are not true. Some 65% is UK, and 35% offshore.''
Hong Kong interest in forestry is also growing, although the buyers
tend to be expatriates who not only want to own a ''little bit of
Scotland'' but are interested in forestry as a long-term investment,
according to Scottish Woodlands Ltd.
The firm, a major player in acquiring UK land, woods, and sporting
estates for clients at home and abroad, regularly sends an investment
manager to Hong Kong to secure more business. Other foreign markets
include Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Holland, and Sweden.

Scotsman escapes Thomson sell-off
THOMSON Regional Newspapers is to retain its five Scottish titles
after it emerged that the rest of its UK newspapers are to be acquired
by the Chester-based newspaper group, Trinity International Holdings.
Within the next few days, Trinity is expected to announce its #280m
acquisition of TRN's English, Welsh, and Northern Irish papers from the
Canada-based Thompson group.
However, the group -- built up by the late Lord Thomson of Fleet over
the past 30 years -- is to retain a toe-hold in the UK provincial
newspaper market with the retention of the Scotsman, its flagship paper,
along with stablemates the Evening News and Scotland on Sunday in
Edinburgh, and the Press and Journal and Evening Express in Aberdeen.
Trinity is the sixth largest provincial newspaper group in the country
and publishes the Liverpool Echo and Liverpool Daily Post, a series of
weekly papers in North Wales, Merseyside, and the London commuter belt,
and also computer magazine Micromart.
The company also publishes newspapers in Pittsburg, USA, and
Vancouver, Canada. In 1994, it reported UK pre-tax profits of #22m, a
15% rise.
In 1992, it acquired Lonrho's Scottish Universal Newspapers titles for
#45m. The following year, it bought the Huddersfield Examiner from the
Yorkshire-based Joseph Woodhead for #12m, and Argus Press, based in
South-east England, for #23m.
This latest move appears to have been greeted with a degree of alarm
and surprise by TRN executives at the group's six subsidiaries around
the country, and prompted speculation about the future of TRN's Scottish
titles. Questions were being asked as to why Trinity does not intend to
acquire the Edinburgh and Aberdeen titles.
Several explanations were ventured yesterday, including the suggestion
that TRN had not offered the newspapers to Trinity, there were legal
complications, or that the group may not be able to afford the titles.
There was no official word from management or editorial executives at
either the Scotsman or the Press and Journal, other than Scotsman editor
James Seaton saying any comment would come from Thomson in Toronto.
However, while staff at the papers admitted they had been unaware of
the move and were now awaiting an announcement from the TRN head office
in London to clarify the situation, it emerged that executives were in
close contact with TRN chief executive Stuart Garner during the day.
Adding to the confusion, an insider at the Western Mail in Cardiff
said the Welsh subsidiary's managing director, Mr Mark Haysom, had also
been in contact with Mr Garner: ''We've been told by the chief executive
there is no truth in the claims.''
However, there was some speculation that Mr Garner may not have been
informed of the move by the Canadian owners.
In Newcastle, the Journal's editor, Mr Bill Bradshaw, said he was
aware of the speculation and might be in a position to make a comment
later.
In addition to the TRN purchase price, Trinity will take on a debt of
around #40m.
A Trinity International Holdings spokesman said it was company policy
not to comment on market rumours.

LAND ownership in Scotland may have been changed irrevocably in recent
years because of events in America, Alaska, and, closer to home, in the
North Sea.
It is understood at least six Lloyd's Names have sold some 200,000
acres due to losses suffered because of an unprecedented series of
natural or man made disasters.
No individual would admit that land sales were down to the losses,
although there is evidence that offloading assets has been inevitable.
It is also alleged that there are still large tracts of land to be
sold off by Lloyd's Names -- and, if they came on the market at the same
time, prices would collapse.
In 1992, the last year for which accounts are available, Lloyd's of
London made a loss of #1200m, taking the total of hits since 1988 to
more than #8000m.
The 1992 loss came in a year when the insurance market was hit by
events ranging from Hurricane Andrew which devastated parts of the USA
to the IRA bombings at Bishopsgate at St Mary Axe in London.
Names had been previously hammered because of the Exxon Valdex oil
spill in Alaska, the Piper Alpha disaster in the North Sea, and other
hurricanes, including Los Angeles.
Under Lloyd's unique system of unlimited liability, there was in
theory no end to how deep Names must dig into their pockets to meet
claims.
There are hopes that Lloyd's is bouncing back, with a #1000m profit
estimated for 1993; accounts are three years in arrears to allow time
for late claims to come in.
Lloyd's has also approved a #2800m package aimed at ending a
protracted period of acrimony between its ruling council and the Names,
or investors, many of whom face bankruptcy because of the huge losses
incurred in past years.
But the forecast profits and settlement packages have come too late
for some Names.
In November, 1992, the 32,000 Kinlochewe estate in Wester Ross was
sold in two lots to neighbouring landowners by Colonel William Henry
Whitbread, of the landed Gravenhurst gentry family mentioned in the
Subsidy Rolls, 1309.
The Colonel, a former president of Whitbread and Co Ltd, who died last
year, sold the estate because of his age, according to his family.
The sale allowed Dutch businessman Paul Van Vlissingen to expand his
Wester Ross empire to 85,000 acres, with his company Catherijne BV
buying 22,000 acres, adding to the two estates already owned, Letterewe
and Fisherfield.
The other 10,000 acres, also sold for an undisclosed sum, went to
Glenleven Estates, a Scottish company owned by Perthshire farmer Pat
Wilson.
Col. Whitbread, whose recreations included stalking and fishing, had
previously sold a greater part of the sporting estate about 10 years
ago.
His widow, speaking from the family home in Surrey, said the final
sale of Kinlochewe was due to his being too old to stalk or fish.
His son, Billy, said that the sale ''did not have a lot to do with
Lloyd's,'' but declined to elaborate.
The 47,000-acre Altnaharra estate in Sutherland, one of the largest
sporting estates in Scotland, was also sold in November, 1992.
Lord Kimball, a Lloyd's name, denied the sale -- ending the Kimball's
60-year relationship with Altnaharra -- had anything to do with losses
he sustained in the insurance crisis. ''I am selling because of my
age,'' he said at the time.
Altnaharra was split in two lots, with the largest -- 37,000 acres,
including fishing on the River Naver, going to the Gray &amp; Adams company
of Fraserburgh. The remainder was sold to the neighbouring Syre estate,
owned by a syndicate headed by Lord Iliffe.
Today, the #6m, 19,500-acre Lovat Fraser family estate including the
spectacular Beaufort Castle near Beauly, Inverness-shire, is on the
market, set to be broken up and sold to a number of different buyers.
The sale, which will see the castle pass from family hands after 700
years, follows the death last year of the Master of Lovat. He left #8.5m
in his will but had debts of more than #7.4m -- and the will showed an
estimated liability to Lloyd's of #990,000.
A closing date of August is likely to be set, according to selling
agents Knight, Frank and Rutley. The agents confirmed interest from the
UK, Europe, and ''further afield,'' but would not be drawn on
nationalities.
Mr Charles Dudgeon, of Savills, said there was no doubt that there
have been sales by Lloyd's Names in recent times. He believed the impact
on the market was insignificant, but conceded: ''There may still be a
threat hanging over the market which requires to be dispelled.''
Mr Andrew Rettie, of Strutt and Parker, said it was logical that some
Lloyd's Names would raise money from the sale of assets -- including
sporting estates.
He said: ''The problem for those with high disposeable incomes is that
they also have huge outlays, be it a house in Portugal, a boat, or an
estate. When the going gets tough, and if they they were Lloyd's
underwriters, I can see it would be logical to raise money by selling
such assets.
''You have to be sufficiently wealthy to run a sporting estate because
they are not designed to make profits. Estates are the traditional
domain of wealthy individuals or their families, and exposure to Lloyd's
have focused minds on the running costs.''
Mr Robin Adam, managing director of Scottish Woodlands Ltd, also
confirmed that Lloyd's Names have sold forestry. He said it was
inevitable as a means to raise capital.

A NEW breed of foreign and absentee laird for Scotland is rising on
the horizon -- coming mainly from the Far East, and Hong Kong in
particular.
There are growing signs of Pacific Rim interest in buying swathes of
Scottish land, with individuals and consortiums said to have a
''phenomenal amount'' of money to spend.
Edinburgh-based Charles Dudgeon, of selling agents Savills, predicted
that the Hong Kong market's strategy of having worldwide property
portfolios would have ''a huge impact'' on land ownership in Scotland.
Savills and other UK agents have been casting their nets ever wider as
the market shows signs of a recovery which is destined to turn the
question of who owns land in Scotland into a major political issue.
Hong Kong interest is partly due to the colony's scheduled handover to
China in 1997.
After years in the doldrums, the market in Highland sporting estates,
in particular, is picking up.
By late 1992, the Scottish land glut was such that estates were
withdrawn from sale because prices were so low.
The recovery is underlined by agents Knight, Frank and Rutley
proposing to set a closing date in August for the #6m, 19,500-acre Lovat
estate near Beauly, Inverness-shire.
The estate has attracted interest from the UK, Europe, and ''further
afield''.
Inquiries by The Herald suggest that Lloyd's Names are having an
impact on Scottish land ownership as assets are offloaded to help cover
huge losses.
Selling agents Strutt and Parker, of Edinburgh, estimate that some 19
estates of between 1100 and 48,000 acres are for sale. Eight are being
advertised, with the others available if the price is right. The 19
estates total 194,000 acres -- 1% of Scotland's total land mass.

Holiday plane in alert
MORE than 200 holidaymakers, who refused to return to a holiday jet
which landed with a suspected engine fire within minutes of take-off
yesterday, were still stranded in Glasgow early this morning.
The holidaymakers received conflicting reports about whether a new
plane would be provided early today or the original plane would be
repaired. Some passengers had circulated a petition demanding another
aircraft.
Fifteen minutes after the packed A310 left Glasgow Airport bound for
Las Palmas the plane developed problems and shuddered violently in
stormy conditions. Baggage fell from the overhead lockers and passengers
said they heard two enormous ''explosions''.
The plane was then forced to make a U-turn and an emergency landing at
Glasgow. Passengers said they believed it had suffered an engine fire.
They were taken to hotels in the area after the incident.
One passenger, Mr Brian Caulfield, 27, of Balloch, said last night:
''That plane was a shambles -- people don't want to get back on it. But
we've been waiting for hours to get this sorted out and it's getting
beyond a joke.''
The drama happened early yesterday morning on the delayed midnight
plane which was bound for the resort in Gran Canaria.
Ms Sandra MacKenzie, 27, of Renfrew, described how she saw a stream of
flames coming from one of the plane's engines.
She said: ''I looked out of the window and saw these flames streaming
back about 10ft from one of the engines -- the sky lit up. I was
terrified so I pulled the window shutter down and told my friend what
I'd seen. We tried to make a joke about it but then I realised how
serious it was and thought 'this is it'.
''The flames turned to sparks and then we heard the bangs, which
sounded like something hitting the plane from outside. Other people on
the plane started to realise what was happening. There were a few people
crying but nobody was shouting or screaming. I think everyone was in
shock.''
Ms Sheena Moir, 52, from Stirling, said that after a quarter of an
hour there was a massive explosion and the plane rocked from side to
side.
She added: ''We heard this really loud bang and the plane started
shuddering. I looked out and saw this bright flash and a flame.
''All of a sudden, the baggage compartments above the seats flew open
and bags were falling over everyone. It was terrifying and I thought the
plane was going to break up. I never thought we would make it down. A
woman next to me went a ghostly shade of white. It really was scary.''
Mrs Iris Turnbull, 30, had travelled from Aberdeen for the flight. She
said: ''The plane had been making a noise the whole time -- it seemed
obvious that something was wrong. When I realised the engine had blown
up, I started crying because I thought it was the end for us. I just
held on to my 15-month-old daughter. I felt physically sick because I
was so shocked.''
She criticised cabin staff for failing to tell passengers what was
happening or issuing any safety instructions. The plane landed safely
and was surrounded by emergency service vehicles.
She added: ''When I got off that plane, I thought I would never go
back on another one in my life. But I know I should to get over the
fear.''
A spokesman for Glasgow Airport said: ''The plane had to turn back
because of engine difficulties but it made a safe return and no-one was
hurt.''
A spokesman for handling agent Servisair, the company dealing with
passengers on behalf of operators Oasis, said engineers last night were
trying to repair the plane. He added that the carriers were also trying
to find a replacement plane in case the engine could not be repaired.
There was no-one from Oasis airlines available for comment.

<HEADLINE>Scots centre to study mystery of the whales</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>3</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977469682</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
IT is one of the great unsolved mysteries of the marine world -- why
apparently healthy whales beach themselves and die on Britain's
coastline.
Now Scottish marine experts have been given more than #250,000 of
Government cash to come up with an answer.
The Scottish Agricultural College Inverness Veterinary Centre has won
backing for a five-year marine mammal project to investigate whale
strandings on Scottish beaches.
Project leader Harry Ross said: ''We have already been studying
dolphins, porpoises, and whales around the Scottish coastline for the
past three years. As yet, we do not fully understand the movements of
these animals.
''It is only now, after three years, that we are beginning to see
trends developing in the data we have collected. In five years, that
information will be much clearer.''
Scientists regard the well-being of large sea mammals, like whales,
dolphins, and porpoises, as a good indicator of the general health of
the marine food chain.
''The more we learn about these animals, the more we will know about
our own environment.''
Unexpected deaths can sometimes point to serious changes in the state
of the environment, which may be caused by pollution or new strains of
disease.
''Hopefully, the information we accrue will lead to better policies
for the management of the North Sea's environment,'' said Mr Ross.
''Whenever the animals are suitable for examination, we carry out
post-mortem examinations to try to determine the reasons for the
strandings.
''It is also a useful opportunity to look at what is in their
stomachs. We have gathered a lot of new information about diseases and
organisms from carrying out post mortems.
''But the speed of decomposition in whales is incredibly fast and in
order to gain any meaningful data, we have to be there within 24
hours.''
Their mythological death wish appeared to strike again at the end of
last summer, when a school of whales came ashore on a remote beach in
Orkney.
Despite the best efforts of locals to coax them back out to sea, the
whale insisted on making for the shore, where they all died within a few
days.
''Looking at the group, there were no obviously sick individuals and
they were all young and in good condition.
''There are lots of sand banks in the area. It is likely they swam
into waters where they simply could not find a way out.
''Whales approach the shores more often than many people think. Sperm
whales have come and gone before -- just because they are closer inshore
does not mean they are in trouble.
''They are breathing animals and if they get into trouble, they will
need to come nearer to the shore, because they are in danger of
drowning.''

PENSIONERS are more likely to be isolated and ignored within the
community in Scotland than many areas of the UK, according to a study on
''home alone'' elderly.
Full details of the Mori survey will be revealed at a national Help
the Aged conference on living alone, to be held in London tomorrow.
However, Ms Amanda Barnes, London spokeswoman for the charity, said:
''We had thought that London would be the worst area but the Mori
figures show people in Scotland are worse at talking to their elderly
neighbours, which surprised a lot of us.''
The charity will call for cross-disciplinary responsibility among GPs,
hospitals, social services, and local authorities for compiling
registers and keeping regular contact with the elderly.
Help the Aged estimates that 20,000 old people in the UK die alone,
unnoticed, and unattended in their homes every year and that, in
Scotland, 60% of women and 30% of men over 75 live on their own.
The charity will highlight the case of Mr Ian Pattison, 62, whose body
was discovered hanging in his Edinburgh flat in September 1994, where it
had remained undetected for nine months.
Mr Pattison, a former psychiatric patient at the Royal Edinburgh
Hospital, committed suicide after discharging himself at Hogmanay. He
was not discovered, despite failing to keep several out-patient
appointments or respond to the visit of a community nurse.
After an internal inquiry, Edinburgh HealthCare Trust moved to
establish closer co-operation with the district council housing
department to monitor patient discharges.
Also in September 1994, the body of Mr James Fotheringham was found at
his home in Kinross, when an anxious neighbour alerted police, two
months after his death.
Ms Liz Duncan, of Help the Aged Scotland, said: ''Tragically, these
are just a few examples of what could happen to any one of thousands of
old people who live alone in Scotland, with no friends and family to
take care of them.
''It is extraordinary to think that as a society we are capable of
ignoring old people to such an extent and that nobody even misses
someone who has been lying dead for months or in some cases even
years.''
However, Ms Duncan stressed that the problem was UK-wide and was due
to the changing lifestyles and expectations of families.
Dr Alastair Riddell, who will address the conference on behalf of the
British Medical Association, said that while old people's neighbours
would check on them immediately after illness or discharge from
hospital, this tended to be ''on a temporary basis''.
Dr Riddell, who retired in March after working with geriatric patients
at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, said: ''GPs can invite people over 75 to
have an annual medical at home or at their surgery, and keep regular
contact in this way, but you cannot force them to do so.''
He added that the heavy workload on GPs precluded them from taking
sole responsibility and called for a Government-funded inter-agency
programme on monitoring the elderly.

THE Scots woman who was declared the best cook in Britain yesterday
celebrated her achievement with her family by going out for lunch.
''I am certainly not cooking. It is my one day off,'' joked a
victorious Marion Macfarlane who was seen last night carrying off the
Masterchef title on BBC.
The part-time teacher from Newtonhill, near Aberdeen, was treated to a
meal at a hotel before going home to watch the programme.
Today, Mrs Macfarlane, 47, will be back at the cooker in her cottage
preparing a meal for one of the best-fed families in Britain.
Her children, Scott, who now lives in Newcastle, and Sarah, who still
enjoys home cooking, have taken her skills for granted for years.
''When I told Scott what I was going to prepare for the competition,
he said it was not a special dish because we often had it,'' said Mrs
Macfarlane.
She is self taught and attributes her success to her inquiring mind.
''When I left home and got married I felt there was something missing.
''I gradually started to get more adventurous and I am sure going on
foreign holidays helped.
'I love food and if I find something different I am not happy until I
work out how to prepare it,'' she added.
Mrs Macfarlane has used ingredients from her native country in every
stage of the contest.
Her menu for last night's final, which was recorded in February,
included oysters, Jacob lamb, and ice-cream made with heather honey and
whisky.
Mrs Macfarlane's most ardent supporters have been her pupils at
Maryculter West primary school, on Deeside.
She said: ''One of the mothers told me that, during the first heat,
her daughter sat in front of the television shouting encouragement with
her fingers, knees, legs, and arms crossed.''

FIFTY thousand fans paid tribute last night to the Rolling Stones as
they started their British leg of their world tour at Sheffield's Don
Valley stadium.
A burst of showmanship -- flames leaping from a cobra-like steel
structure looming into the sky -- signalled their arrival and Mick
Jagger, Jumpin' Jack Flash himself, opened with one of the group's
earliest hits, Not Fade Away.
A year into their Voodoo Lounge sell-out world tour, the Stones had
finally reached Britain, and the atmosphere was at fever pitch for the
first of their five UK concerts.
The band, now 33 years old and performing together on home ground for
the first time since 1990, were determined to prove you're never too old
to rock.
But one member of the audience was distinctly underwhelmed by their
show -- 10-week-old James Woolas from Sheffield, who slept through the
opening numbers, was attending his first concert with parents Rob and
Moira Woolas.
''When we bought the tickets last year we never expected James to come
with us, but our babysitter let us down at the last minute,'' said Mr
Woolas.
Meanwhile, the Stones had an electrifying effect on the rest of the
crowd, whose age group was similar to a Frank Sinatra concert -- evenly
divided between the middle-aged and the young, with more than a
smattering of senior citizens.
But then the Stones are not getting any younger -- Jagger, at 51, is a
grandfather twice over.
The band were dwarfed by a soaring #2.6m steel and aluminium stage
with a video screen behind, and merchandising outlets dotted the ground.
It is estimated this tour will make #200m from sales of Stones
memorabilia.
Touts were out in force, but they were not having a very profitable
time. Tickets were initially offered at face value of #30 or #25, but
prices quickly dropped to a level fans were prepared to pay.
One familiar face was missing from the line-up, base guitarist Bill
Wyman who said farewell to rock'n'roll two years ago. But Jagger, Keith
Richards, Charlie Watts, and Ron Wood showed they had no intention of
following his example and retiring.

EXCLUSIVE
NHS trusts and fund-holding GPs would bebanned from spending money
outside the NHS under a package of ''immediate impact'' measures being
prepared by Labour in advance of a General Election victory.
The idea is to take advantage of the extensive statutory powers
created under Tory legislation which allow Ministers to introduce
changes in the law without passing legislation through the Commons.
The measure, which would have a radical effect on current NHS reforms,
would be introduced within weeks of a Labour Government taking office.
It would force all NHS purchasers -- from GPs to hospital trusts -- to
spend their money solely within the NHS.
It would immediately threaten the future of private hospitals, such as
Clydebank's controversial Health Care International, which rely on NHS
patients for much of their business.
Labour is also considering sweeping changes to the membership of
Government-appointed quangos, from NHS trusts to water boards, including
replacing all members in one swoop.
Extensive decentralisation of local government finance is also being
looked at to give voters a greater say in the way councils spend their
money.
Under plans being discussed, the power to set the business rate would
be returned to local authorities, and compulsory competitive tendering,
which forces councils to expose all their non-essential services out to
private sector competition, would be scrapped.
Labour is acutely aware of the dangers of what is refered to as the
Bill Clinton syndrome, who as an American presidential candidate was
accused of putting too much effort into getting elected and not enough
thought into his policies.
In Scotland, the problem is compounded by the time required to deliver
on the party's promise of a Scottish parliament with tax-raising powers.
Labour is known to be considering a fast-track approach to get
devolution through the Commons but the Scottish parliament is not
expected to be up and running until about two years into the new
Government's term.
Using statutory powers rather than time-consuming legislation to
introduce popular measures is considered by members of the Shadow
Cabinet to be a promising way of heading-off the crisis of expectations
a Labour Government is expected to face.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson and his Front Bench team
are actively canvassing policy ideas as part of a ''be prepared''
strategy.
Although the broad lines of official party policy are drawn up in a
complex, long-term exercise involving special committees and the
national executive, new ideas are being actively encouraged.
Labour Scottish health spokesman John McAllion said yesterday: ''It's
very important, after such a long period in opposition, that Labour
doesn't appear to not know what it wants to do when it comes to power.
We have to get in there from the word go.

<HEADLINE>MP's new revelation. MP Aitken admits an affair</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

TORY MP Jonathan Aitken has admitted having an affair with a woman,
who it later emerged was a prostitute, only months after his wife gave
birth to their twin daughters 15 years ago, it was confirmed early
today.
Mr Aitken, who quit his Cabinet post as Chief Secretary to the
Treasury in last week's reshuffle, made the admission to John Thomas,
chairman of his local constituency party.
Claims that Mr Aitken, 52, MP for Thanet South, had a two-year affair
with an unnamed ''Miss Whiplash'' were printed in the Sunday Mirror.
Mr Thomas told PA News he had spoken to Mr Aitken who was very upset
about the revelations.
''He isn't denying the article that appeared in the Sunday Mirror. It
was an event which took place 15 years ago and he is sorry it has been
brought up again,'' Mr Thomas said.
But he stressed: ''He certainly didn't know she was a prostitute.
''It has upset his wife to have it brought up again. They had
discussed it at the time.
''They are very happily married now and the family is very close and I
think it's just a shame.
''He is disappointed it has been brought up again and it has caused
distress to his wife.''
Mr Thomas insisted the revelations would have no effect on the support
given to Mr Aitken by the constituency association and there were no
moves to deselect him.
''It's nothing of any significance to us as a Conservative
association. He has been a very good MP for us and it hasn't interfered
with his work in any way and it was a very long time ago.
''It's just one of those unfortunate facts of life that do occur in
certain marriages,'' he said.
The former prostitute, believed to be called Paula, is to publish her
claims in a forthcoming book.
She told the Sunday Mirror that the affair lasted for some 27 months
from December 1980 to March 1983.
The affair allegedly began not long after Mr Aitken's wife Lolicia
gave birth to their twin daughters Alexandra and Victoria, now aged 15.
The couple also have a son William, aged 13.
Mr Aitken, a keen church-goer, has stressed he had no knowledge that
the woman was in fact a prostitute who specialised in sado-masochism.
Last week he quit his Cabinet post to fight from the back benches his
libel actions against the Guardian newspaper and Granada TV's World In
Action programme over his alleged dealings with Middle East businessmen.
He also faces being summoned before the Commons Trade and Industry
Select Committee over his involvement with arms company BMARC which
allegedly breached Government guidelines by exporting weapons to Iran in
the 1980s.
Rumours that a new scandal was about the break round Mr Aitken's head
have been sweeping Westminster for weeks.
Speculation reached fever pitch when a fax from political adviser
Patrick Robertson was passed to a Sunday newspaper after being sent to
the wrong number.
The fax made it clear that Mr Aitken feared that ''one more story will
break the camel's back''.
Mr Aitken's mother, Lady Penelope, said last night: ''This is
atrocious. It all happened 14 years ago.
''This is just the way men behave.''
Lady Penelope is reported to have said that Dr Christine Pickard, the
woman who introduced Mr Aitken to the woman involved, was a ''family
friend''.

<HEADLINE>Town sealed by RUC as Orangemen answer call to muster. Police hurt in protest</HEADLINE>

THOUSANDS of Orangemen last night responded to a call to ''muster
urgently at Drumcree Parish Church'' after the RUC blocked off the
centre of Portadown to prevent a march.
All entrances to the centre of the town were blocked by police.
Hundreds of officers used Land Rovers to close off the roads while
republicans blocked the Garvaghy Road along which the Orangemen
traditionally parade after their annual service at Drumcree Parish
Church just outside the County Armagh town.
The 800 Orangemen who attended the service remained outside the church
hoping they might be allowed to march.
During the tense stand-off, four police officers, one of them a woman,
were injured when struck by missiles thrown from the crowd.
This is the first time the parade has been blocked off in 200 years --
this year is the bicentenary of the formation of the Orange order.
Five hours after the end of the church service, County Armagh Grand
Orange Lodge issued a statement saying they had been denied their right
to parade and calling on all Orangemen throughout Northern Ireland to
''urgently muster at Drumcree Parish Church to show their solidarity
with their Portadown brethren''.
In response, the RUC drafted in extra riot police as tension grew.
By late evening the assembly of Orangemen and supporters had grown to
more than 4000, with many more arriving from various centres. It
stretched from the church to the RUC Land Rovers blocking the main road.
After a scripture reading and a rendering of the hymn, Abide With Me,
an impromptu religious service by two Church of Ireland clergymen was
held as an Army helicopter hovered overhead.
DUP leader Ian Paisley later arrived in Portadown in an attempt to
resolve the stalemate between the huge Orange demonstration and the RUC.
He was greeted with huge cheers by the demonstrators outside the
Drumcree church.
He spent more than 40 minutes discussing the situation with RUC chiefs
at the scene.
As the stand-off looked like stretching long into the night, loyalists
held demonstrations in other towns in Ulster in support of the Portadown
Orangemen.
In the village of Tobermore, County Londonderry, more than 200 people
blocked off the village for an hour.
At Ahoghill in County Antrim, 100 people held a rally in the town
centre.
Upper Bann Ulster Unionist MP David Trimble, who is a member of the
Orange order and who paraded to the church in the morning along the
non-controversial route approved by the police, was scathing in his
criticism of what had happened.
He said: ''We are angry at the failure of the police to secure the
route for a peaceful parade. They have made absolutely no effort to do
so.''
Meanwhile, a senior member of the local body of the Orange order
appealed to fellow members to remain outside the church and not to
disperse.
He said it was understood that the RUC had the impression that those
on parade would ''melt away''.
Mr Trimble, who read out the Lodge statement, said Garvaghy Road had
been cleared by police but the Orangemen had not received the go-ahead
to return to the town centre along that route.
The lodge members remained gathered outside the town with many of them
suggesting that the protest should continue thoughout the night.
An RUC spokesman said early this morning ''all available'' police
resources had been drafted into the Portadown area to deal with the
confrontation.
