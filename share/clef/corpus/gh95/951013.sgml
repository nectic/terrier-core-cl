NOW that some shopkeepers are legally barred from using Imperial
measurements, it is only a matter of time before the authorities try to
force through the same process in everything to do with motoring.
Although we already have metric fuel pumps, the real problem will come
in trying to think of actual fuel consumption in metric terms. The
European system is quite illogical.
It takes an arbitrary distance -- 100 kilometres -- and says how many
litres a car should need to travel that far. The litre is such a silly
wee unit to use in this context that you have to put in a decimal point,
and what is the use of knowing how much fuel your car will take to cover
a distance you may not be driving anyway?
Our own system of saying how far you will travel on a standard unit of
fuel makes it obvious how much a motorist will need to put into the tank
to get home from any imaginable distance away.
We are not ready for the change. I asked several friends how many
miles per gallon they would expect a car rated at 6.7 litres per 100
kilometres to manage. None of them had a clue. The answer is 42.4 -- and
I had no idea either, until I looked it up.
Continental inconsistencies about metric usage continue to mount. One
French newspaper last week referred to a new design for a yacht ''de 60
pieds''. In other words, a 60-footer.

AN eight-year campaign to win equal pay for female sewing machine
workers employed by Vauxhall Motors ended yesterday with an out of court
settlement totalling almost #1.5m.
As a result of the deal, which sees their work upgraded to skilled
status, the 260 women concerned will receive back payments of up to
#5500, depending on service.
Last night a jubilant Roger Butler, executive councillor of the
Amalgamate Enginering and Electrical Union responsible for Vauxhall
negotiations, said the deal vindicated the members' claims and
aspirations for regrading.
Meanwhile all 9000 Vauxhall car workers are to be urged to reject the
company's ''final'' pay offer worth 3.5% for the next year and by the
rate of inflation in the year from September 1996.
Leaders of the Transport and General Workers' Union and the AEEU
rejected the offer as ''insulting'' especially as it did not even meet
the 3.9% September inflation figure published yesterday or include any
response to their demand for a two-hour reduction in the working week.
Workers at Vauxhall plants in Luton and Ellesmere Port meet next week
before voting on whether to accept the proposals.
Ford is due to reply to a broadly similar claim for its 24,000 workers
later this month.

A post-mortem was being carried out yesterday on a 13-year-old boy who
died during a gym lesson at school.
Gideon Cuckle had been running on the spot in a field at Harrogate
Grammar School for two minutes when he collapsed. Teachers and
paramedics tried to revive him but he never regained consciousness and
died in hospital. An education authority spokesman said: ''There is
nothing on his records to suggest anything like this might happen.''

A Scottish company is equipping mature employees for the needs of
tomorrow's workforce, reports Joan Grady
THE tide is beginning to turn for those who thought they were washed
up in the employment market. Growing public interest in the problem of
ageism may be contributing to its cure.
Most media attention in recent months has been on the problem but it
has often overlooked solutions as employers begin to appreciate that
older job candidates may have as much to offer as the young.
The Government has launched a range of initiatives to encourage
employers to hire older people. Employment Minister Cheryl Gillian has
been touring the country since early this year with the ''TOO OLD...who
says?'' roadshow.
She told 300 employers in Birmingham recently: ''This form of
discrimination is not only unjust but makes no sense -- economic or
otherwise.
''For the country to prosper organisations must adopt the best
possible practices towards older workers and make full use of the
experience and talent that comes with increasing years.''
The DIY store chain B&amp;Q has realised that and has a positive policy
towards older workers. After an experimental stage in the early 80s,
when two stores were manned entirely by over 50s, the company extended
its policy throughout the United Kingdom.
''At our Macclesfield store, B&amp;Q extended the usual pre-store opening
period by two weeks to offer more training in certain areas and to allow
time to unlearn earlier working practices,'' said Lorian Coutts at B&amp;Q.
''This extra time proved unnecessary and in fact we benefited from the
wide range of skills and experience demonstrated. Some older employees
worried about proving themselves in a new environment and their
communications skills needed honing.
''But trainers and trainees soon found that by sharing experience they
learned the most effective working practices from each other.''
B&amp;Q found that older members of staff took less time off and that
staff turnover was reduced. This lower turnover has allowed for better
and more in-depth training.
TSB Bank recently placed an advertisement inviting job applications
from candidates of all ages. ''We have very much set out our stall
against ageism,'' said spokesman John Ruskin. ''It's been an unwritten
policy of ours for a long time.
''There's been a lot of public attention on ageism recently, so we
thought we'd make our policy clearer to people who might want to work
for us.''
The number of companies who invite applications from older workers is
steadily rising. Nationwide Building Society, WH Smith and Sainsbury's
have all adopted positive attitudes towards older workers.
Their experience and talent is still sometimes going to waste,
however, even when older people are already in work. A recent survey by
the Industrial Society, the UK's largest independent training and
advisory body on best practice in the workplace, showed people over 45
are being denied training opportunities available to younger members of
staff.
Managers have more faith in younger employees. They believe them more
likely to be successful in gaining qualifications through training, so
the older the employee the less likely they are to receive training or
updating in new skills.
At Strathclyde Regional Council a spokeswoman for personnel services
said: ''There are no limitations on recruitment policy here -- we're an
equal opportunities employer.
''There might be limitations on training since that's for the good of
the organisation -- it might not be seen to be worth training an older
person.
''I would never be sent on an MBA course at my age -- much as I might
love to -- but someone younger might get more benefit from it than I
would. It would depend on individual departments to decide who to train
and whether it would be worthwhile.''
From the companies surveyed by the Industrial Society, almost half the
workers in the under 25 age group took part in regular training or
skills updating. Only 20% of workers over 65 are likely to receive the
same, and only 39% of workers between the ages of 45 and 64.
Older people are still receiving training for specific purposes, such
as promotion or lateral moves, though for the most part they are being
denied the opportunity of keeping up with the jobs market through
relevant qualifications.
This doubles the difficulties of the older person who has lost his or
her job and does not have the necessary skills for other employment.
Mari Scotland is a training company which specialises in adult and
youth training schemes and training courses for business. It aims to
overcome the fear of older workers and keep their skills up-to-date.
''We're very successful in training and placing mature people in
jobs,'' said Ellen Lang at Mari Scotland. ''We are very much equal
opportunities in all areas.''
Lang went to Astra Training in 1993 after six months of looking for
something to meet her specific training needs. When the company was sold
to Mari in November that year she was offered a job due to her previous
experience and new skills.
''The training was quite intense at the beginning, it's quite
frightening for an older person,'' she said. ''I've noticed working here
the people over 40 seem terrified of working computers: they just don't
think they can do it.
''After one week you can see a difference, but after two, the change
is immense. The first six months of a redundancy can be absolutely
soul-destroying for an older person. But after they join us they get
really uplifted.
''They treat their job here as work, and the response when somebody
gets a job is fantastic.''
To begin with, Mari found some reluctance from employers to place
older trainees in jobs, but Lang has noticed a change to that attitude
in recent months. ''It was difficult up until six months ago,'' she
said.
''But even in the past two or three months I have seen a change in
attitude. More people are learning to value the experience older people
can bring.''
TSB's John Ruskin agrees. ''Recruiting older people benefits
organisations because they bring with them a maturity and experience not
usually found in the school or college leaver,'' he said. ''We welcome
all candidates, whatever their age.''

FOR older people, losing a job often means an unwelcome early
retirement. Glasgow shipbuilders Kvaerner Govan have introduced a method
by which ''surplus'' workers, no matter how old, can be re-employed
after retraining.
''Eighteen months ago we re-structured our workforce,'' said personnel
manager David Wilson. ''We had 45 surplus ancillary workers: 30 took
voluntary redundancy, and 15 skilled workers wanted to leave because of
age or health problems. That left us 15 skilled workers short.''
Kvaerner decided to make use of its own resources. It introduced the
Adult Apprenticeship Scheme -- the first of its kind in Britain -- to
retrain semi-skilled workers.
All ancillary workers went through a process of assessment, and the 15
most successful were chosen for training. Individual managers chose the
best candidates for their departments and set to work.
''It was very intense training over two years,'' said Jim McGowan, now
a qualified marine pipefitter.
''There was a mixture of theory and practical work. We had the basic
skills so it wasn't too difficult. The teaching was great -- they really
took the time to explain everything to us.''
The new scheme was welcomed both by employees and the trade unions. It
meant older workers could receive valuable training and skills and the
company would be spared the expense of more redundancies followed by
fresh recruitment.
Jim has been with Kvaerner for 15 years. Had his company not
introduced Adult Apprenticeships, he knows where he would be now.
''The alternative was unemployment,'' he said. ''I'm really pleased
about this scheme -- delighted I was chosen. In this country a lot of
the time people are discarded when they pass 45 and it's appalling.
''There are so many older people with good skills and abilities who
could be retrained -- it's a shame to waste that talent.''

HOISTING the sails, weighing the anchor and shivering the timbers is
not the province of the executive only. Every year, thousands of young
people get the chance to take part in this sort of personal development
training through national youth charity Fairbridge.
Evolved from ''Operation Drake,'' a two-year, round-the-world venture,
Fairbridge's beginnings were in 1981. Since then, the 400-strong
participant list has swelled to 20 times that size.
''Each year 8000 young people participate in the Fairbridge programme,
of whom over half will go on to employment or return to education,''
said director Nigel Haynes.
''Through learning new skills, young people can re-channel their
energies in positive directions and make a constructive contribution to
their community.''
Fairbridge operates from 12 inner-city centres. Through a progressive
programme of activity training and group work followed by aftercare and
support, it provides personal development and social education -- the
first step towards surviving in the employment market.
Young people are referred by social services, education officers or
probation services. Sometimes they refer themselves. The results are
impressive.
After the initial eight-day course, 60% of young people will be back
at work, school or volunteering in their community. The Northumbrian
probation service reported that 80% of Fairbridge participants did not
reoffend.
Spirit of Scotland is used by Fairbridge to provide training for young
people across the UK. In July this year, an almost entirely novice crew
from Fairbridge manned the yacht for the Tall Ships Race.
''These young people enjoyed a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,'' said
Fairbridge in Scotland director Tom Watson. As well as the thrill of
taking part in this event alongside 120 of the world's largest
traditional sailing ships, they had the opportunity to visit another
country and mix with crew members from all over Europe. It was a
tremendous learning experience.''

Francis Shennan finds time spent before the mast stands people in good
stead for employment, business and group bonding
IN the past four years I have practised damage-control routines aboard
a minesweeper, flown in a helicopter low over mid-Wales, watched teams
of businessmen and women navigate, run and moutain-bike through the
hills, and walked out along the bowsprit of a schooner to set a sail.
And that was only to report on outdoor training programmes. Those
actually taking part endured much more. Yet this form of training is on
the increase.
Last Sunday a team from Scottish Nuclear returned to Greenock aboard
the Spirit of Scotland, a 90ft replica Victorian schooner which it
sponsors, after another training course.
So what is the point of taking people so far away from their usual
work environment in the name of training?
The two main prongs of this approach are team courses and competitions
although some, like Royal Naval Reserve and Royal Marines Reserve's,
Executive Stretch, combine elements of both. The competition route is
best exemplified by Power Challenge and Challengers Trophy.
Spirit of Scotland is an ideal setting for team programmes, but it was
a team-mate on board the minesweeper for Executive Stretch who best
summed up its greatest advantage: ''You can't just clock off and walk
away.''
The two-masted schooner is owned and operated by a national charity,
Fairbridge.
My time before the mast was during part of the Captains of Industry
course run by Edinburgh-based Mariteam. The basis of the course is the
similarity between the operation of a tall ship and a business.
Both managers and a crew must be able to solve problems, make
decisions and take responsibility for the company and the ship. The
advantage of using a tall ship is that the team ''will literally have to
live with the consequences of their decisions and actions''.
Any inter-personal problems are tackled as they occur and solutions
are practical rather than theoretical. There are no management games,
role playing or false scenarios.
Our skipper was Captain Nick Loening, who had worked as captain,
manager and mate for commercial shipping companies, environment research
organisations and charitable institutions around the world. He had also
been a commander on a 190ft, three-masted schooner when it
circumnavigated the world.
He allocated tasks and responsibilities on board. Our overall task was
to sail the ship to a predetermined destination -- and back again, of
course.
The tasks on Mariteam's course was directly related to the running of
the ship. In another course, Executive Stretch, on a minesweeper, we
were told the ship had been holed below the water-line. In-rushing water
would flood that compartment in 10 minutes.
Each team would find a two-foot square plug, a saw, lengths of wood,
wedges and clamps. Their room to manoeuvre was limited by a metal tank
in the compartment. Anything they dropped would disappear into the
bilges.
One team wielded the plug into place, fixed clamps to the ship's hull
and tried to select the right wood and wedges to hold the plug firmly in
place.
Each task was followed by a debriefing. First, the team leader
commented on himself and the team. Second, the team commented on
themselves and the leader. Finally, the crew member who had briefed them
assessed the team's performance.
ScottishPower has been taking this competitive training route since
its formation in 1991. It began with the Power Challenge, an annual
competition of physical ability and problem-solving tests for the
electricity supply industry in which 30 teams compete over a weekend
against the clock.
Several ScottishPower teams took part in this year's competition, held
near Melrose. One, from Longannet Power Station, was among the champion
fund-raisers, giving more than #2000 from donations and sponsorship for
underprivileged children.
This spirit is now part of the company's induction course for graduate
trainees which, as well as on-the-job training and a business course,
includes an outdoor weekend on the Clyde island of Cumbrae.
Challengers Trophy, four days of physical and mental endurance across
miles of open hill country, was introduced to Britain from Europe by a
Scottish-based company.
Companies as diverse as City finance houses, electricity and gas
companies, chemicals companies, computer firms, Royal Mail and Ordnance
Survey have taken part.
What is intended to be an intense physical, mental and emotional test
forged a camaraderie between team members that was difficult to bring
about in other ways and the camaraderie extended beyond the team to the
company.
One outdoor training instructor described the qualities of good
management that are tested in this kind of competition: ''physical
fitness, good planning skills, resourcefulness, the ability to manage
changes of task, climate and terrain, and the ability to manage in a
crisis.''

GLASGOW intends to bid for major athletics and rugby fixtures once the
new Scotstoun complex is completed. To be built alongside the new indoor
complex, which last week made a victorious debut as an international
tennis venue, an athletics and rugby centre will be up and running a
year from now.
This should attract significant representative rugby, possibly at
international level, and the return of the Scottish athletics
championships to Glasgow, whose standless Crownpoint arena is not really
a credible venue.
''Looking longer term, we are in discussion with the Scottish Sports
Council and the Scottish Rugby Union for major events,'' said Bernard
Connolly, Glasgow City Council's director of Parks and Recreation
yesterday.
''Ultimately, after the third phase, whose completion is subject to
successful application for Lottery funding, we hope to have an 8000-seat
stand. When that is in place, we will apply for major events, including
European grand prix athletics meetings.''
Work is shortly due to begin to replace the existing cinder
Showgrounds track with an eight-lane international all-weather surface.
''It will include a 10-lane straight, and we will also have the first
rugby artificial scrummage area.''
Plans for a centre of excellence for both sports are already well
advanced.

<HEADLINE>Ferguson: SFA still to set appeal date</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>975913119</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH football chiefs were yesterday preparing the ground for
jailed Everton striker Duncan Ferguson's latest appeal -- against a
12-match suspension. Ferguson has 11 matches to serve of the ban, which
was imposed following the head-butting incident with former Raith Rovers
player John McStay last year.
The then Rangers striker appealed against the decision and the ban was
put on hold until the end of court proceedings into the matter.
Yesterday an SFA spokesman said Ferguson's suspension would be heard by
a three-man appeals tribunal on a date to be arranged.
''It is now the task of the administration to set a date for the
appeals tribunal to consider the matter,'' he said. ''It was held in
abeyance until court proceedings were completed and that only happened
yesterday.''
Everton will be hoping that, if the #4m striker's appeal fails, his
ban can run concurrently with his three-month jail sentence.
The three men who will decide Ferguson's footballing fate are
independent chairman Menzies Campbell, the SFA president (Motherwell's
Bill Dickie) or his appointed deputy, and a representative of the
Scottish Professional Footballers' Association.
Ferguson served one match of the 12-game ban while still a Rangers
player, but it was lifted when his appeal was lodged and he played in
the 1994 Scottish Cup final against his former club, Dundee United.
Ferguson will not play again until the New Year, but could miss
virtually the rest of the season if he is further ordered to complete a
12-match ban.

SCOTLAND manager Craig Brown is ready to seek a meeting with Leeds
United manager Howard Wilkinson in an attempt to defuse the club v
country row which flared after Gary McAllister was injured in Stockholm.
The 30-year-old midfielder, who captains both his club and his
country, was stretchered from the field as Scotland lost 2-0 in their
friendly clash with Sweden.
Yesterday, as Leeds waited to assess the full extent of the ankle
ligament damage, Wilkinson claimed that he had been let down by Brown.
The Elland Road manager claimed he had an understanding with Brown
that McAllister, who reported for the match suffering from a nagging
ankle knock, would only be played for part of the game.
But the Leeds player was injured in a tackle after 58 minutes, and
Wilkinson stormed: ''I will be looking very hard at how I release
players in the future. I was under the distinct impression that Gary
would not be played for that length of time because of his injury.
''Now we have the player out of important games, probably including
our UEFA Cup-tie against PSV Eindhoven next week.''
Leeds chairman, Leslie Silver condemned Brown even more. He snapped:
''This could cost our club millions if we are knocked out of Europe next
week. We will be claiming compensation from the Scottish Football
Association.
''It is disgraceful that we should have a key player injured while
playing in some meaningless international.''
But Brown retaliated by stressing, as he had done after the game, that
McAllister had wanted to take part, and even at half-time, the player
had said he was ready to play on.
The Scotland manager further explained: ''Gary takes his
responsibilities as Scotland captain very seriously. It might have been
that we would have taken him off at half-time, but at that stage, we had
lost two goals and I don't think he wanted to leave the team facing that
problem.
''Howard Wilkinson is right to say that we had an understanding that
Gary would not be asked to do too much, but there was nothing cut and
dried about it. The player was fit. What happened here is that he was
caught by a late tackle, and quite a hefty one, and that is what caused
the injury.
''As for their chairman's remarks, I don't wish to go into that area
too much, because my talks were with Howard Wilkinson and he is the man
with whom I must have a working relationship.
''We have had a very good understanding in the past and now, if
necessary, I will go down to see Howard and talk this one through. We
want to continue to exist on the goodwill basis which has worked for us,
and for the clubs, in the past.
''I don't want to invoke FIFA regulations over the release of players,
but we do have that power. We have it for all competitive matches, and
for up to seven friendlies each year.''
The only stipulation regarding the friendly matches is that clubs need
not release players until 48 hours before these games.
While Wilkinson may complain about the McAllister injury, and may talk
of changing his attitude towards the player's release in the future,
there is not really a great deal he can do. If Scotland want McAllister,
then Scotland will get him.
As for compensation, the SFA will consider any claim made by Leeds and
will pay the player's wages for the period of his injury absence.
SFA spokesman David Findlay explained: ''The SFA continue to insure
players when they are on international duty, although that is now no
longer a FIFA requirement.
''There were problems with some of the Eastern European countries, who
could not afford to pay the premiums, but the SFA still have coverage.''
Brown added: ''I don't want to use the FIFA rules, but we know that
they are there and the clubs know that too.
''My ferverent hope is that Gary will be fit for the Leeds game
against PSV next week. I spoke to Leeds today, and the report from their
physio was that he was walking more freely. We can only look for that
improvement to continue.''
Brown refused to be too downhearted at the defeat from Sweden. ''We
took the game because we wanted to test ourselves against quality
opposition,'' he said. ''We know that we are not the best team in the
world, but we do have qualities which will serve us well in the finals.
''We showed more adventure in our play in Stockholm than we have done
in other games. We might not have thrown people forward so much if that
had been a qualifying match.
''We suffered from our old failings -- not taking chances when they
were created. We want to change that for our final qualifying game
against San Marino at Hampden next month. We want to make that a gala
night. We want it to be a big occasion for the team and for the
supporters.
''There's the chance that we will have Scott Booth back, and someone
like Kevin Harper has the opportunity to push himself into contention.
His pace is a tremendous attribute.''
Brown would not be drawn too much regarding Duncan Ferguson's future.
But there is no way that the jail sentence will keep him out of
Scotland's plans if Brown feels that the Everton player can help him in
the summer.
Brown was firm: ''No-one at the SFA has given me any instructions
about Duncan Ferguson. They have not interfered at all and I don't
expect them to interfere. If they did, then I would not stay in this
job.

THE complicated qualification process still had Scotland examining the
various European groups yesterday as they tried at Park Gardens to
assess the current situation, writes Ken Gallacher.
Eventually, manager Craig Brown said: ''It will need a run of freakish
results to put us into the play-off situation at Anfield in December.''
The problem in trying to work out the up-to-date situation is that
qualification from second place is assessed on the results against the
top three or, in some groups, top four teams. Scotland, for instance,
will be judged on their results against Russia, Greece, and Finland.
Brown said: ''There are some groups where we are not sure who will be
in the top places and therefore it makes it difficult. But I am
convinced that Group 6, where the Republic of Ireland and Austria are
vying for second place, will see one of these countries go to Anfield.
''And I think France may be in the same position. If not, then Denmark
will be. It would take some very surprising results to force us into
that Anfield match.
Goal difference will also be taken into consideration.

SCOTTISH international midfielder Billy McKinlay will complete his
#1.8m transfer to Blackburn Rovers this morning.
The Dundee United player returned from Stockholm after the friendly
international against Sweden in the early hours of yesterday morning and
by lunchtime he was driving south to have talks with the English
champions.
McKinlay had met Blackburn manager Ray Harford on Saturday and last
night he finalised details of his move to the Lancashire club.
The 26-year-old player has been 10 years at Tannadice and was one of
the victims of the much criticised long-term contracts. Indeed, he has
been pursuing a court action against the Tayside club. That action may
now be set aside with his transfer south.
Last week McKinlay, who appeared as a substitute for Scotland in the
2-0 defeat in Sweden, was targeted by Celtic. Parkhead manager Tommy
Burns agreed terms with Dundee United, but then, after talks, McKinlay
decided against a move to Glasgow.
Celtic pulled out of the race and Blackburn were left with a clear
field.
McKinlay, a regular in Scotland's European Championship set-up, is
likely to make his Blackburn debut against Southampton this weekend.
Rovers are also ''tying up the loose ends'' on Norwegian World Cup
player Lars Bohinen's #700,000 move from Nottingham Forest.
Bohinen agreed personal terms with Rovers last week, but unless all
the necessary paperwork is finalised, he will not be able to make his
debut on Saturday.
* ANOTHER rumoured Celtic target, Ian Rush, will not be joining the
Scottish Cup holders. Liverpool manager Roy Evans yesterday scotched
reports that the striker was poised to join the Scottish club.
Celtic were said to have tabled a #750,000 offer for the Welsh
striker, who will be 34 later this month and will be out of contract at
the end of this season.
But Evans said: ''I have had no contact from Tommy Burns on Ian Rush,
so he has not been given permission to talk to them.
''We are grateful to have Rush's experience at this time. We are not
forcing him out of the door. Obviously, he has to fight for his place at
Anfield like everyone else.
''The time may come over the course of this season when he decides it
is right to think about moving, but no way am I forcing him out.''
Celtic were guests at Rush's testimonial last season and then
Liverpool visited the new Parkhead in August for a pre-season friendly.
* HEARTS manager Jim Jefferies last night completed the signing of
Steve Fulton from Falkirk in a swop deal which takes David Hagen to
Brockville.
Fulton will make his debut against Raith Rovers at Tynecastle tomorrow
alongside other new singing, Neil Pointon. But Jefferies is still
waiting to finalise the swop deal involving keeper Andy Rhodes of St
Johnstone with Hearts midfielder John Millar, who wants more time to
think about the move.

GOLF: WORLD MATCHPLAY
MASTERS champion Ben Crenshaw will be anxiously awaiting the results
of medical tests when he enters the Toyota World Matchplay championship
at the quarter-final stage today.
The 43-year-old American did not arrive at Wentworth until yesterday
after returning from Arizona to his Texas home to see a doctor at the
start of the week and then encountering travel difficulties.
''I was passing some blood in my urine and I wanted to get it checked
out,'' he said. ''It was a bit scary. I'm on anti-biotics and I think it
might be a kidney problem. ''The doctor couldn't tell me before I left,
but said I was free to go. I'll get the test results tomorrow.''
Mechanical difficulties on a plane further delayed his departure --
and when he flew into Heathrow this morning he had a stiff neck.
''When you play in an event like this you want to be prepared, but I
will see what I can do,'' added Crenshaw, who at least harbours no great
worries about the state of his golf -- despite losing his three matches
in the Ryder Cup.
He said: ''It was disappointing, but for very personal reasons I was
very happy for lots of members of the European team. I have known what
they have gone through, and it was a great, great effort on their part
on the last day.''
Crenshaw will meet Italian Costantino Rocca today, while Colin
Montgomerie plays Australian Steve Elkington. Bernhard Langer, who beat
Sam Torrance yesterday, takes on Nick Price, and holder Ernie Els
encounters American Lee Janzen.

RUGBY LEAGUE
THE Rugby League World Cup was upset yesterday by a triple drugs
surprise, with the three men in question being kicked out of the
competition after having tested positive, one for anabolic steroids.
South Africa's Pierre Grobbelaar, Syd Eru, of New Zealand, and
France's Stephane Millet all have been suspended.
Grobbelaar, 29, tested positive for the anabolic steroid, nandrolone.
Eru returned a positive sample for pseudoephedrine, and 25-year-old
Millet for cannabis.
Grobbelaar and Millet were tested despite not having played in the
event, while Eru was tested after the Kiwis' opening game against Tonga
on Sunday.
Tournament director Maurice Lindsay said: ''It was made clear at two
International Board meetings that vigorous drug-testing would take place
throughout the competition. It is regrettable that these players have
failed, but we are determined that rugby league must be drug-free.
''We only have the power to suspend them from the competition. It is a
matter for their respective country's governing bodies to consider
further suspension. We will continue to vigorously test every player in
the competition, almost certainly on more than one occasion.''
France manager Tas Baitieri said: ''It's going to cost Stephane Millet
dearly and he's very upset about it because he knows he has ruined his
reputation and brought a stigma to French rugby league and to the World
Cup. He's very apologetic.''
The South African management could not be contacted yesterday for
their reaction, while the New Zealand Rugby League are expected to make
an official statement today.

BRYAN Hamilton will be offered a new two-year contract despite
Northern Ireland's costly European Championship elimination.
Failure to qualify for the finals in England next summer has cost the
Irish a #2m jackpot, but the international committee are almost certain
to back their manager with a new deal when his present contract expires
in December.
Hamilton has impressed the officials by taking Northern Ireland close
to qualification while rebuilding. The 4-0 win in Liechtenstein on
Wednesday meant that, for the first time, a Northern Ireland team
completed their away ties of a qualifying campaign unbeaten.
The manager himself feels proud of his side's achievements and is
upbeat about the future. He said: ''We have gained a lot in terms of
credibility. Now we would like to beat Austria next month and end our
qualifying campaign on a high.''
Hamilton believes he has a crop of youngsters who will form the
backbone of Northern Ireland's football for several years. During the
European campaign he has introduced players like Newcastle's Keith
Gillespie, Pat McGibbon of Manchester United, Walsall goalkeeper Trevor
Wood, Wrexham defender Barry Hunter, Neil Lennon of Crewe, and
Tottenham's Gerry McMahon.
''By the nature of our country, we have to give players a chance,''
said Hamilton. ''We blood them earlier than other people and end up
using them longer.
''We could have a crucial role to play when Austria come to Belfast on
November 15. I would like to finish level on points in second place in
the group. I will say 'good luck' to the Republic if they qualify, but
no-one can take away what we have achieved.''

WHY must Scotland always be dragged kicking and screaming into the
21st century? Why, depending on whether you had an abundance of Y or XX
chromosomes at the time of conception, are you categorised, labelled,
and told what is expected of you?
Girls cook, sew and play genteel sports, while men work hard and play
hard.
Football is a sport loved and enjoyed by all, so why has it taken so
long for girls and women in Scotland to be allowed and encouraged to
play the sport? And what is the Scottish Women's Football Association
doing about it?
For many years women did not organise themselves for the sport. And,
of course, attitudes -- and not only male ones -- fostered the notion
that organised football was not for women.
Even some of their own sex still believe that women should not play at
all, that it is a man's sport. People who hold this view are letting
women down.
But such views are changing. A conference held yesterday, in
conjunction with Team Sport Scotland, ''Goals for Girls'' at Forthbank
Stadium, Stirling, highlighted the progress the sport has made over the
past four years, and detailed steps to be taken to continue that growth.
It is currently Britain's fastest growing sport, having recently moved
into the top 10 participant sports for women in Scotland, according to
Sports Council figures.
Scotland has seen a 50% increase in league, club and individual
membership this season. Four years ago there were no more than 700
registered players. Now there are some 3000 playing in regularly
organised matches. This does not include very significant numbers who
play regularly without SWFA affiliation.
However, compared with our European counterparts, or even closer to
home, in England, Scotland has a long way to go before becoming an
accepted and integral part of the football family. We are moving towards
it, and are happy to be working out of the same offices as the SFA in
Glasgow.
But England, where the sport comes directly under the jurisdiction of
the Football Association, claim 40,000 women playing regularly in county
leagues. In 1990, 731 women attended FA courses. By last year, that
figure had risen to 2000.
In England now it is the rule, rather than the exception, which sees
most premiership clubs having an integrated girls'/women's team. Even
the chauvinist bastion of Anfield has fallen, hosting a women's match
six weeks ago.
Breaking down the barriers in Scotland is proving more difficult.
Currently only two Scottish league teams have a girls' set-up, Ayr
United and Queen of the South, while Cove Rangers lead the way in the
north of Scotland. Livingston, having identified the social and economic
benefits, intend to be the next club to integrate women.
Globally the scene is different. The second world championships have
just finished in Sweden, and women's football will be included in next
year's Atlanta Olympics for the first time. But Great Britain's women,
in line with their male counterparts, will not be represented.
There are 35 countries participating in the current European
championship, and Scotland kicks off its campaign a week on Monday,
against the Faroe Islands, at Palmerston Park, Dumfries.
For this match UEFA have appointed a woman referee, Bente Skovgang,
with one woman and one man running the line. This is a first for this
level of football in Scotland. Yet in Norway, Skovgang officiates in
senior men's matches.
People should be allowed to participate in their chosen sport without
anyone dictating to them what they can and cannot do. If you are serious
about your sport, train hard, and compete to the best of your ability
the least the spectating public, media, and males can do is take us
seriously.
Good luck to the national squad in the European championship!

INTERNATIONAL
FOOTBALL ROUND-UP
ABERDEEN believe supplying players for the Scottish international
squads is one way to boost their title challenge in the premier
division. Yet last season the Pittodrie club lost their strike-force of
Duncan Shearer and Scott Booth for most of last season when they were
injured on international duty.
Manager Roy Aitken, who had five players in Sweden this week, said:
''This club has always stressed the importance of our players being
involved at international level. The experience gained is invaluable in
furthering their careers. The down side is the injuries. We suffered
heavily last season, but that is a price we are prepared to pay.
''With Scotland qualifying for the European Championship finals there
is a huge incentive for our international players to maintain their
form. We also have several youngsters involved with the Under-21 side,
which is also on course to qualify.
''I am delighted they are all doing so well and making a contribution
to their country's cause. When they play well confidence is boosted. Our
lot have come back from Sweden in buoyant mood and I'm sure there will
be a spin-off in terms of results.''
In-form Booth, who missed the defeat in Stockholm with an Achilles
tendon injury, will be fit to face Motherwell tomorrow.
* DAVID Platt, the one England player who remembers how to score
international goals, is not guaranteed a recall against Switzerland next
month.
Terry Venables, just hours after his latest selection found more dead
ends against Norway than there are twists and turns in the nearby
fjords, refused to confirm their was an automatic place in his line-up
for the England captain.
The Arsenal player, racing towards fitness after his knee operation,
has scored 26 times in 55 games for his country. Six of those goals have
come in 10 games for Venables -- and that is three more than anyone else
has managed in a team that has totalled just 16, including five against
Greece, in 12 games.
England have now fired three blanks in the last six games, with little
wit or creative spark in Oslo to suggest that Alan Shearer's suffering
will end. The Blackburn striker has now gone 733 minutes over eight
games and 13 months without a goal.
Yet Venables confessed himself well satisfied with his young team,
very happy with the result, content with England's progress. It was a
performance a lot more nimble than his team's.
''There are quite a few players who will come into the reckoning,'' he
said when asked about Platt. ''The players who came in here did very
well and there's no way I'm going to criticise them.
''I won't get into individuals. My only interest is in the ones who
played the game, not the ones outside it. They would understand that.''
Pressed again about his skipper, whose form has been the subject of
speculation, and public expectation of changes and improvement in the
next challenge, Venables replied: ''I always do what is right. The Swiss
game is a month down the line. I'd rather talk about the players who
played in the Norway game, a hard game away from home when everyone said
we were the underdogs and going to get beat. Why would I want to talk
about Switzerland a month away?''
No concessions there then to an increasingly hostile reaction to his
progress, or lack of it, with the European Championship finals only
eight months away.
But if Platt, Paul Ince, John Barnes, Matthew Le Tissier and others
must bite their nails in the next few weeks (though surely there is
little doubt about the returns of Darren Anderton and Paul Gascoigne),
Venables shows no signs of worry.
Most of the post-mortem was concerned less with personnel -- he has so
far used 39 players, 20 winning their first caps -- than the system he
squeezes them into.
With two wingers, Venables insists the Christmas tree formation has
long gone. Instead, it appears more like a stunted bush, with Shearer a
straggly twig blowing in the breeze.
The lack of support for the lone striker emphasised the drawbacks of
England's more patient build-up, with Norway given time to flood back
and block all channels.
There was little invention, though, even if Venables insisted: ''I
don't see it that way. We tried to play, we tried to get width, we tried
to get forward. We had enough to work on. I was happy with everyone.
''The future is another story.''

''PRINCE'' Naseem Hamed has insisted there would be no let-up in the
psychological assault directed at opponents barring his way to becoming
a multi-world champion.
However, he has rejected criticism that he taunted and humiliated
Steve Robinson before taking the World Boxing Organisation featherweight
title from the Welshman a fortnight ago.
Hamed, who makes his first defence at London Arena on December 9,
said: ''I out-thought him, outboxed him, and outpunched him. ''I did it
in style, just as I said I would. There wasn't a mark on my face at the
end. What do I have to do to get the credit I deserve?
''Steve fought his heart out, but was no match for me. That's my style
and I will change it for no man.''
Promoter Frank Warren said Hamed was spat at, struck by coins, and
suffered racial and personal abuse. He told a London news conference:
''Throughout it all, Hamed maintained his cool. You say he humiliated
Robinson. We say he did him mentally and physically. Muhammad Ali and
Sugar Ray Leonard were praised for that sort of thing.
''This guy gets slagged off. He is a supreme talent who is going to
become a legend in British boxing.
''I don't like what's being drummed up against him. Give him a
chance.''
Warren is talking to three possible first-defence opponents and
expects to finalise negotiations for an announcement on Tuesday.
He says it is becoming increasingly difficult to find suitable
matches, but hopes for a unification fight against one of the other
champions early next year.
That could be Ghana's Alfred Kotey, who defends the WBO bantamweight
title at London's York Hall tomorrow week and who says he fancies his
chances against Hamed.
In the meantime, Hamed is planning visits to Dubai and Qatar, where
his achievements have attracted the attention of royalty and rulers. He
has also been asked by a recording company to make a record.

JACK Charlton, still dreaming of ending his career on a high by
leading the Republic of Ireland in the European Championship finals next
summer, was yesterday cheered by a double disciplinary reprieve.
Niall Quinn and Paul McGrath have been cleared by UEFA to play in the
decisive clash with Portugal next month depite having been booked in
Wedneday night's 2-1 win over Latvia in Dublin. Both players left the
ground believing they were automatically banned after a leading Football
Association of Ireland (FAI) official told them it was the second
caution for each in the Group 6 qualifying competition.
But European football's governing body insisted yesterday that the FAI
had got it wrong. A spokesman at UEFA's Geneva headquarters said:
''There is no record of previous yellow cards for either Quinn or
McGrath and they are free to play in the next match.''
That will come as a great relief to both McGrath -- set to become
Ireland's most capped internationalist with his seventh-ninth appearance
in Lisbon -- and Charlton, who has made it clear he will quit if the
Republic fall short of their qualifying target.
Charlton, 60, freely admitted he would ''probably have left'' with a
defeat, and he added: ''You will no doubt ask me the same question after
the Portugal game and my answer will probably be exactly the same.''
His premature exit was saved by two strikes from veteran marksman John
Aldridge, who is now on the brink of Frank Stapleton's all-time Irish
goal-scoring record of 20. The 37-year-old Tranmere striker, who struck
with a penalty and a text book header to take his total to eight in four
games against Latvia, said: ''If we qualify, I'll certainly say they
were my most important two goals.
''We can even win the group now by beating Portugal and I've always
believed we were capable of winning our last two matches.''
Ireland had to scuffle for their success against the improved but
far-from-menacing Baltic state side and Charlton admitted there are
still some alarming flaws in his team. He said: ''You've got to look at
our experience but also, in some cases, the lack of it.''
Yet they are now in a position to qualify for at least a play-off for
the last place in the finals with a draw in Portugal on November 15
enough -- provided third-placed Austria do no better than that against
Northern Ireland on the same night.
A Republic win in Lisbon would solve all the complex, mathematical
puzzles as it would leave them on 20 points, the same as Portugal, who
are already sure of qualification after their 1-1 draw in Vienna.
Charlton's team have a vastly inferior goal difference record to
Portugal, but UEFA's priority for settling top place in the group when
points are equal is the head-to-head results between the nations.
Ireland, of course, had a 1-0 Dublin win over Portugal in April.
It was not all good news for the Republic, however. David Kelly,
Sunderland's recent #900,000 signing from Wolves, was stretchered off
after coming on as a second-half substitute on Wednesday night. He was
detained in hospital overnight with suspected damaged ligaments, and
although an X-ray revealed the extent of the injury to be no more
serious than a twisted ankle, he will miss his club's home game against
Watford on Saturday.

FOOTBALL ROUND-UP
WALES want to become a member, for the first time, of the
International Football League Board which meets in Glasgow on Tuesday.
The Scottish, English, and Irish Leagues are involved in regular talks
and the Welsh are applying so that they also can join in such meetings.
Scottish League secretary Peter Donald said yesterday: ''The Welsh now
have established a league of their own. They are recognised by UEFA and
put forward their own clubs for European tournaments. They feel it is
time they were also involved in the British association.''
The home league associations will take the chance next week to discuss
the implications of the Bosman affair and how this may yet affect
players' contracts.
* GRAEME Armstrong achieves another personal milestone tomorrow when
he plays his 750th league game.
No-one in the game comes anywhere near that number of appearances, but
the Stenhousemuir central defender has no thoughts of quitting the
playing side.
''I am not going to stop playing simply because I reach the age of 40
later this season,'' he said yesterday. ''I am still enjoying playing
and will continue as long as I can.
''I will stop when I feel I am not capable, or we have someone who can
obviously do a better job. But I will know myself when it is time to
stop.
''It is possible that, as I get older, I will play in less games and
it will just taper off, but I am fit and have been fortunate so far as
injuries are concerned. I have missed only three games in my thirties.''
Armstrong started out with Stirling Albion before moving to Berwick,
Meadowbank, and now Stenhousemuir.
* TIM Flowers looks ready to return to action for Premiership
champions Blackburn tomorrow against his old club, Southampton.
Flowers has recovered from an elbow operation which forced him to miss
his club's last fixture -- a 2-0 Coca-Cola Cup victory over Swindon --
and so should replace Bobby Mimms.

TONIGHT will see the most intense ring battle between two Scottish
boxers in years when British bantamweight champion Drew Docherty, from
Condorrat, defends the title against Jim Murray, of Newmains, at
Glasgow's Hospitality Inn.
Docherty, at 29, will be bidding to put his first notch on a second
Lonsdale Belt, having already made two successful defences, and he knows
that the main ''prize'' for victory tonight will be a European title
contest early next year.
Murray, 25, has stated openly that the champion, after unsuccessful
tilts at European and world titles, is past his best and it is time for
him to move over. And the Lanarkshire boxer, who is one of the most
improved in the country over the last year, is convinced he is the man
to push him.
Murray, the reigning Scottish champion, also has been given a massive
incentive for success, because Frank Warren, who co-promotes tonight's
event with Katherine Morrison, has promised to get him a bout with World
Boxing Organisation champion Alfred Kotey, who in February beat Docherty
inside four rounds.
Murray has been oozing confidence in the build-up to the fight, while
the champion, who is a self-confessed worrier, has gone about his
business quietly.
'It's just not my style or nature to shout about what I'm going to,''
he said.
''It's a hard game and I have the utmost respect for every opponent,''
he said. ''It's a big night and there are obvious rewards for the
winner. Murray could rise to the occasion, but I have enough confidence
in my own ability to think I will still be the champion at the end of
the night.
''But there is no point in making predictions. It all comes down to
what happens when the two of us get into the ring.
''I don't make anything of the fact that I beat him when we were in
the amateur division. That was a long time ago and we've both come a
long way since then.''
If Docherty wins, he will get a second opportunity to become the
European champion, having last week been named as a mandatory challenger
to Londoner Johnny Armour.
Murray has stopped four of his last six opponents, including the tough
Ady Benton. Some could draw a form line through that, because Benton
lasted the distance with Docherty on the night the champion won his
Lonsdale Belt outright. However, I don't read too much into that, for I
don't think Benton has been the same fighter since Docherty beat him.
A confident Murray, who can hit hard and box well, said: ''Drew has
been a good champion, but I feel it is now my turn. And, after all the
hard work I've put into my preparation I don't intend to fail.
''My trainer, Davie Douglas, has been telling me that I must be
patient on the night and everything will come good. I've listened to him
all along and now I'm ready.''
It is a close fight to call. Docherty has been over the course before,
and fought on bigger stages. For Murray it will be a new experience and
much will depend on how his temperament stands up on the night.
If Docherty still has the urge following his defeat by Kotey, his
greater experience may well carry him to a points win, but if he is not
100% mentally and physically, then the hungry Murray is capable of
causing an upset.

LAS VEGAS INVITATIONAL
RESURGENT Bob Tway continued his re-emergence as a world-class golfer
when he took the clubhouse lead after his second round at the Las Vegas
Invitational yesterday.
Tway took advantage of near-perfect morning conditions to shoot a
seven-under-par 65 on the Summerlin TPC course. With nearly half the
field in the clubhouse, Tway was at 13-under 130 in the five-round event
played on three courses. On Wednesday, the 1986 US PGA champion opened
with a six-under 65 at the par-71 Las Vegas Hilton course.
''I was fortunate to tee off early. The greens were fast but perfect.
I was able to make a lot of putts,'' he said. ''This golf course plays
tough when the wind blows, but we had perfect conditions today.''
Tway, 36, has enjoyed a brilliant season after slumping the previous
three years. From 1992 to 1994, he did not finish in the top 100 on the
US Tour money list, but he is a healthy nineteenth this year.
He won the Heritage Classic in South Carolina in April, and only last
Sunday was equal fourth at the Walt Disney World Classic. ''I have been
extremely pleased with this whole year,'' said Tway. ''It's been far
better than I expected, probably my most fun year on tour.''
He made one eagle and six birdies, all from inside 15 feet, along with
one bogey in yesterday's round.
Naomichi 'Joe' Ozaki, of Japan, the first-round leader, had a late tee
time.
In late Wednesday action, Curtis Strange had a four-under 68 at Las
Vegas Country Club in his first competitive round since losing to Nick
Faldo in the Ryder Cup. Leading completed scores (Americans unless
stated):
130 -- Bob Tway 65, 65.
131 -- Curt Byrum 66, 65.
133 -- Dave Stockton Jr 68, 65.
134 -- Wayne Levi 69, 65. 135 -- Steve Jones 65, 70.

WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP OF WOMEN'S GOLF
BRITAIN'S Laura Davies fired a five-under-par 67 yesterday to share
the lead after the first round of the #316,000 World Championship of
Women's Golf in Cheju Island, South Korea.
She was joined in the lead by American Rosie Jones, who in balmy,
sunny weather also picked up five birdies over the 6188-yard Paradise
Golf Course in the southern resort island.
''The greens are very difficult, very tough but I played very well,''
said Davies. ''I'll keep my fingers crossed. With 16 players in,
everybody is good and it could be anybody's week.''
The 32-year-old Davies, currently fifth on the LPGA money list, said
her participation in an invitational tournament in South Korea last week
helped her to prepare for this week's competition.
On the 451-yard sixth, she used a sand wedge from 92 yards which hit
the flag and dropped within an inch. She rolled in a birdie which she
said set the pace for the rest of her play.
After an outward 33, she collected two more birdies, coming in to
finish the day at 67.
Betsy King, an American Hall of Famer, shared the lead until the
eighteenth hole, which she three-putted to finish on 68 alongside
another American, Pat Bradley.
The championship is the first LPGA tournament to be held in South
Korea. The winner's prize is #78,000. Scores (Americans unless stated):
67 -- L Davies (England), R Jones.
68 -- B King, P Bradley.
69 -- T Green.
70 -- V Skinner.
71 -- B Daniel, J Lidback (Sweden).
72 -- A Sorenstam (Sweden), D Mochrie, N Bowen, L Oh-soon (South
Korea).
73 -- K Tschetter, M Mallon.
74 -- I Shiotani (Japan).
76 -- M McGann.

GLASGOW'S Alison Sheppard is heading for Canada later this month, and
a six-week training trip that she hopes will be a stepping stone towards
a third successive Olympic Games in Atlanta next summer.
A regular British internationalist since her Olympic debut in Seoul
seven years ago, the 22 year-old realised that she needed something new
to provide the motivation in the build-up to the Olympic trials in
Sheffield in just five months' time.
''I'll be leaving for Calgary in a fortnight's time and will be
training with the local university squad,'' she said.
At the start of the new year, she will be back on the tourist trail.
Her club, Milngavie and Bearsden, are in the process of finalising plans
for a trip to Phoenix, Arizona, in January, while the Scottish squad are
heading for a training camp in Fort Lau derdale as the final preparation
before the Olympic trials in Sheffield next March.
''The trials are not far away, but I'm looking forward to my build-up
programme. It's always nice to get away,'' she concluded.

CRAIG Everett widened the gap between himself and the rest of the
field yesterday at the Mount Ellen Assistants' Championship when he
added a second-round 63 to his opening seven-under-par 61.

SERGI Bruguera, the two-time French Open champion, fought back from
two breaks down in the second set but lost to No.14 seed Byron Black in
the tiebreak on a net cord yesterday in the Seiko Super Tennis
tournament in Tokyo.
Bruguera, the third seed, suddenly came to life with Black serving for
the match at 5-1, breaking the Zimbabwean at 15-40, and again by the
same score at 5-3 with lightning ground strokes and perfect passing
shots.
But Black stayed with the Spaniard by mixing up his shots and coming
to the net when possible.
With Bruguera serving for the second set at 6-5 in the tiebreak, the
baseline judge called a Black groundstroke out then corrected herself.
Bruguera, who hadn't gone for the shot, protested for nearly two minutes
and was cited for a delay.
The Spaniard, who later said he was sick and had been taking aspirin
for a sore throat, complained the set had been stolen from him by the
umpire ''on the most crucial point of the match.''
Bruguera lost 6-1, 7-6 (8-6) when Black backhanded a Bruguera serve
that clipped the net tape and dribbled over. Other results:
H Holm (Sweden) beat T Martin (USA, 6) 6-2, 3-6, 6-4; M Philippoussis
(Australia) beat B Steven (New Zealand, 11) 7-6 (7-4), 6-3; A Volkov

(Germany) beat J Stark (USA), 4-6, 6-3, 6-4; M Chang (USA, 1) beat J
Hlasek (Switzerland), 6-1, 6-3; R Krajicek (Holland, 4) beat R Furlan
(Italy, 13), 6-3, 6-2; G Ivanisevic (Croatia, 2) beat K Carlsen
(Denmark) 6-4, 6-7 (2-7), 6-3.

FRENCH OPEN
JULIE Forbes, from Aboyne, returns to familiar surroundings at St
Endreol in the South of France to defend her title in the 54-hole Nestle
French Open which begins today.
Last year over the same course Forbes beat Scottish rival Dale Reid
and Suzanne Strudwick at the second hole of a sudden-death play-off to
earn a maiden tour victory.
''It feels good to come back to a course where I have won before and
feel confident about doing well again this week,'' said Forbes, who has
finished in the top-eight in four of her last five tournaments.
Reid is an absentee this week. She is in Florida preparing for her
attempt to earn her player's card at the LPGA qualifying school in
Daytona Beach next week, but the Scottish challenge is strengthened by
Kathryn Marshall and Pam Wright.
Marshall gave Scotland their first LPGA win with her victory in the
Jamie Farr Toledo Classic in Ohio last July. The Monifieth golfer is
making her sixth appearance of the season on the American Express Tour.
Wright has played only in the British Open this year and will not be
able to complete the mandatory six tournaments, previously four, to hold
a ranking on the end of season merit table.
Alison Nicholas and Trish Johnson are playing this week. Since winning
the Scottish Open at Dalmahoy in August, Nicholas has been in top form
and last month in Oregon won her second LPGA title of the season.
After next week's Spanish Open at La Manga the leading 80 on the merit
table will retain their cards for next season. Marshall, currently
No.82, Kirsty Speak (80), and Myra McKinlay (108) all need two good end
of season tournaments.

BRIDGE of Allan Sports Club bid for their third successive men's
national league title when they take on last year's runners-up Newlands
in the final fixture of the premier division on Saturday.
The Stirlingshire side, one point ahead of their opponents, have
national champion Ken Wood, Scottish No.5 Jason Barnett, and former
British No.4 Nick Fulwood in their six-man line-up but will be without
17-year-old Graeme Darlington who is playing for Great Britain juniors
against France.
Since losing their opening match 5-4 to unfancied Thistle, Bridge of
Allan have dropped just one rubber in 27 played and have accumulated 36
points from 30 rubbers and six win bonuses.
Newlands, led by Scottish No.4 Malcolm Watt and West County trio
Ronnie Terras, Calum McKnight, and Ian MacAulay, are undefeated and
determined to add the league trophy to the Scottish Cup. They have a
maximum eight points in win bonuses but their rubber tally of 27 is
three short of the holders, so nothing less than a win will do.
Broughty Ferry could retain the women's title without hitting a ball
this weekend. Their final opponents, Whitecraigs, have withdrawn,
donating the Dundee outfit six rubbers plus two win bonuses, taking
their total to 28 points.
Newlands have 22 but face Dunfermline who have Scottish No.6 Allison
Wood available. Cults and Broomhill, both on 21, clash in Aberdeen.

Langer claims scalp of tired Torrance.
COLIN Montgomerie yesterday advanced, albeit unsurely, to the second
round of the Toyota World Matchplay Championship at Wentworth by beating
the rising young American, David Duval, by one hole after having been
five up with nine to play. But his fellow Scot and the only other
British player, Sam Torrance, was relentlessly subdued 5 and 4 by
Germany's Bernhard Langer.
Thus Montgomerie will today renew rivalries with the Australian Steve
Elkington who beat him at the first hole of their play-off for the US
PGA title this summer. In the other game in the bottom half of the draw,
Costantino Rocca, who beat Vijay Singh 4 and 3, will play Masters
Champion Ben Crenshaw, disadvantaged after having arrived two days late.
In the top half, Langer qualified to face Nick Price, No.2 in the
world and also a beaten finalist, and Lee Janzen, the former US Open
Champion, who overcame by 7 and 6 Katsuyoshi Tomori, the Japanese
matchplay champion for the opportunity of dethroning last year's winner,
South Africa's Ernie Els.
The season of mists inflicted a two-hour delay to the start of play
and to the extent that only one of the four matches went to the
thirty-sixth, the fates were kind. A scant 25 minute-interval between
rounds was punishing. As Langer said as he peeled a banana walking
briskly off the home green: ''This is lunch.''
What Montgomerie did was ''to stuff two sandwiches, a coke and a
chocolate bar down me and get going again.'' He had no time for
treatment on his twinging left wrist, but on the practice round he had
looked comfortable and, of course, an injured golfer often has to be
warily watched.
Everything seemed to be plain sailing in weather that was windless
and, until sunshine belatedly broke through, grey.
Round in 66, six under the par of the West course playing to its
6957-yard length, Montgomerie snacked five up on his opponent, his
appearance more dishevelled than his game turned out to be.
Montgomerie was still five up at the second turn, unaware that the
afternoon was to become more tiring and eventful than he had hoped.
Duval won the next three holes, two of them with birdies, but bunkered
his approach to the thirteenth for Montgomerie to become three up again.
''But then I got careless,'' Montgomerie admitted. He took three putts
at the fifteenth and failed from a straightforward chip to halve the
next. ''I was thinking 'all square' then,'' Montgomerie added, ''for my
drives were tending to leak. But when I had to I followed his good tee
shot at the seventeenth with one of my own.''
That hole was halved in birdie 4s when Duval holed from six feet, but
the American could not match Montgomerie's No.3-iron shot of 206 yards
to within 18 feet of the last hole. Montgomerie, highly relieved,
concluded: ''It would have rated as a bad day if I'd lost from that
commanding position.''
Torrance knew he would have to be on top of his game gainst so solid
and consistent an adversary as Langer for whom, as winner of three PGA
championships over it, understandably consider the course to be among
Europe's finest. Torrance did not play or putt nearly well enough
against Langer who did not drop a shot until the twenty-eighth hole.
However, competing for the eighteenth successive week, including the
particularly draining experience of the Ryder Cup, could not, at 42,
have helped Torrance. Even the welcome prospect of a reasonable break
before the Dunhill Cup will be interrupted tomorrow when he plays in a
father-and-son competition with seven-year-old Daniel.
Out in 31, Langer was four up and had not Torrance holed from four and
five feet to win the seventeenth and eighteenth in birdie 4s, Langer
would have been six up at lunch. Torrance's low-hooking No.6-iron second
to the first green looked the shot of a tired golfer, not one who sensed
the possibility of reviving his cause completely.
Langer is not the sort of competitor to let a wriggling opponent off
the hook and 33 out made him seven up. Some respectability was all that
Torrance could apply to the result and the tenth and thirteenth he won
in par brought his total to a modest five, the holes he won of the 32
played.
Rocca acknowledges that his tie with the eventual winner Daly in the
Open Championship and his redemptive performance in the Ryder Cup match
have made him more confident and aggressive. To be sure he skied his
opening drive a miserly 180 yards but he was round in 65 and Singh did
well to be only three down.
The key shots were in themselves an expression of Rocca's new
attitude. Now two down to the tenacious Singh, the amply built Italian
struck a No.4 iron to four feet at the 450-yard ninth and a No.5 iron to
the short tenth 25 feet away. Both putts were firmly dispatched for
birdies and four up proved a secure advantage.
Janzen, approximately six under par when he finished off Tomori with a
conceded eagle 3 at the twelfth, was pleased for two reasons to have got
by his first match. His opponent had developed a high temperature the
previous day which might have made him more dangerous for Janzen to show
sympathy to. In the event Tomori won only five holes.
The American also believes that if he can accomplish something this
weekend he will have made up in some way for the disappointment of not
having been selected for the US Ryder Cup team -- an honour he believed
he deserved after having won three times this season to be currently
second on the money list to Greg Norman. Results:
L Janzen (USA) beat K Tomori (Japan), 7 and 6; S Torrance (GB) lost to
B Langer (Germany), 5 and 4; C Montgomerie (GB) beat D Duval (USA), 1
hole; C Rocca (Italy) beat V Singh (Fiji), 4 and 3.
TODAY'S TEE-OFF TIMES
8.15am and 12.30pm E Els (S Africa) v L Janzen (USA); 8.30 and 12.45 B
Langer (Germany) v N Price (Zimbabwe); 8.45 and 1.0 S Elkington

THE first major event of this year's Scottish curling season gets
under way this morning with 24 teams taking part in the Lockerbie Open.
This event is also the first competition this season to count in the
Curlers Association Order of Merit, a title won last season by Hammy
McMillan's European champions from Stranraer.
It has recently been agreed with the British Curling Association --
the organisation created to administer the preparation of Britain's
Olympic squads -- that standings in the order of merit will be used as
part of the process of assessing Olympic hopefuls.
The men's Olympic preparation squad currently consists of eight
individual teams, who are subject to various types of continuous
assessment.
In this morning's opening games, McMillan is drawn against Philip
Wilson, of Greenacres, while the reigning junior world champion Tom
Brewster takes to the ice on his home rink against another local team,
led by Kenny Murray.
The tournament will follow the triple knock-out format and in the
lunchtime session today former Scottish champion Colin Hamilton, of
Livingston, opens with a game against Glasgow's Crawford Copstick.
Play continues throughout today and tomorrow with semi-finals and
final taking place on Sunday afternoon.

RUGBY
STIRLING County's success against Melrose last weekend at the
Greenyards has proved costly.
Their captain and international hooker, Kevin McKenzie, will miss the
visit to Hawick tomorrow, but he will not be alone because also absent
will be two other district players, Angus Turner and Gareth Flockhart.
McKenzie's medial knee-ligament damage will keep him out of action for
the remainder of this month. His return target is the game against Gala
on November 4, though that is only two weeks before he could have
expected to be playing for Scotland against Western Samoa at
Murrayfield.
Neither Turner nor Flockhart should be missing for so long despite
respective rib and groin injuries. Colin MacRobert deputises for Turner,
and David Elliot, who missed the Melrose match because of injury,
replaces Flockhart in the back row.
McKenzie's absence is the most severe for County. Not only did they
lose their way when he departed from The Greenyards game, but,
especially at Mansfield Park, they need his direction and impetus.
County's only defeat on their way to the title last season was at
Mansfield, and already in their championship defence they have lost at
home to Hawick, who will be fielding an unchanged XV after the 20-10 win
over Gala last week.
McKenzie's fellow caps, Peter Wright and Scott Hastings, also will not
be playing tomorrow, though each is expected back in action next week.
Wright damaged a knee during a recent Cyprus tournament, though,
despite the injury, he led Boroughmuir to victory against Heriot's six
day ago, and Hastings took a rib knock while making a rare appearance at
stand-off when Watsonians lost to Edinburgh Academicals by 23-31 the
same day.
Duncan Hodge who, like Wright, was injured in Cyprus, returns for
Watsonians against Gala at Myreside. Lewis Graham takes over from Wright
at tight head for Boroughmuir against Edinburgh Academicals at Raeburn
Place.
Gala, languishing at the foot of the premier first division, will
field a new half-back partnership. David Paterson, displacing David
Boland, returns at scrum half, and Gavin Dalgleish, the Scotland
under-19 stand-off in the FIRA tournament last season, will make his
league debut, though he has already played in the Gala seven this
season.
West of Scotland, going well in the second division, stand by the same
team for the fourth successive week when they take on Selkirk at
Burnbrae, seeking to avenge a 24-18 defeat at Philiphaugh six weeks ago.
Jed-Forest, having inflicted Currie's first defeat last week, also are
unchanged for their game against GHK at Old Anniesland. The Glasgow club
can see a reversal to their injury misfortunes with Tim Sanderson's
return at centre after a finger fracture early last month.
Graeme Inglis, the Scotland under-18 international team captain last
season, is carving out a new career as a scrum half with
Hutchesons'/Aloysians. The former flanker, who has had a month
practising his new role in the second XV, has been promoted for his
scrum-half debut in the first team for the national league match against
Perthshire at Auldhouse.

ALHAARTH can succeed where Gorytus failed by gaining victory for
trainer Dick Hern in the Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket today.
Gorytus's five-length win in the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster in 1982
frightened off most of the opposition and he was sent off at 1-2 to beat
just three rivals.
He failed, passing the post more than 35 lengths behind Diesis amid
allegations that he had been ''got at.''
Alhaarth is the best two-year-old Hern has trained since.
His form makes for good reading and he should come out on top today,
particularly with the race run to bring his so far untapped stamina into
play.
Cheveley Park Stakes runner-up My Branch is most likely winner of the
Rockfel Stakes, albeit at shortish odds. However, a more attractive
betting proposition is Harry Browne, who can make the most of a step up
to a mile and three quarters in the NGK Spark Plugs Handicap.
The gelding has won five times at up to 10 furlongs this term and has
been running well at around that trip of late.
The way he stuck on when second in a mile-and-a-half apprentice race
last time suggests there is better still to come from him over longer
distances.

COURAGE League Division 1 leaders Bath have surprisingly recalled
England prop Victor Ubogu for tomorrow's West Country derby at home to
Bristol.
The player was dropped for last weekend's clash at Wasps because of
his lack of fitness but, following intensive training, Ubogu has
regained his place as Bath seek a sixth successive victory.
Ubogu's return means that England A prop Kevin Yates is demoted to the
replacements bench, and Scottish internationalist Dave Hilton switching
from tight head to loose head.
Scrum-half Andy Nicol has been dropped following five successive
appearances -- he makes way for Ian Sanders -- while Irish
internationalist Simon Geoghegan returns on the right wing for his first
league outing since March.

TOBREX Wanderers was not a name which came readily to mind when
nominating contenders for this season's league championship race,
particularly as the club was open about plans to make this a season of
transition.
However, the vast reservoir of talent at the Dundee club is possibly
beginning to embarrass their own officials as they top the table, albeit
on goal difference, from Western, Touche Ross Gordonians and defending
champions Grange.
Gordon Shepherd, Wanderers' international striker, has obviously made
a valuable contribution by scoring 11 goals in their last three games,
but touches of class have been provided by a couple of schoolboys,
14-year-old Neil Stott and Alan Johnson, the 15-year-old brother of club
captain David, last season's Scottish player of the year.
The promotion of players so young to first-team hockey has triggered
much discussion recently in some rival clubs, but Benny Gibson, the
club's coach, defends the policy.
''With the introduction of rolling substitutes, we are able to develop
these players better by exposing them to a higher level of
competition,'' says Gibson. ''But none of them ever play the full 70
minutes.''
With so many young players breaking through a new beginning is a
strong possibilty for the Taysiders, and they should continue their
winning ways tomorrow at Inverleith.
Grange and Kelburne, who were beaten 6-0 last week by Wanderers, clash
at Linwood. The outcome of this tussle could have a vital bearing on the
championship prospects of both teams, but current form certainly does
not favour Kelburne.
The other contenders, Gordonians and Western, should not have too much
to fear against MIM and Menzieshill respectively, while in the meeting
of the two promoted clubs, Pender Uddingston are unlikely to see their
nightmare disappear when they entertain Clydesdale.

WOMEN'S HOCKEY
BONARGRASS Grove, who lost their unbeaten record against Edinburgh
Ladies last week, will have to find their winning touch again without
three of their most experienced players this weekend, writes Joseph
Dillon.
Pauline Robertson and Susan Fraser are on Great Britain duty, while
Karen Humphries is with the Ireland squad in the USA.
Minus this important trio, the Dundee side hope to bounce back against
their guests, Heriot Watt University. The students have had little
opportunity to gain match practice so far, although they did defeat
Robert Gordons 3-1 in midweek.
Audrey Sime, the Grove captain, is confident her side can take the
full quota of points. She bases her forecast of a victory on the quality
of the players Grove are able to call up, like the experienced Maggie
Smith and the highly talented Scottish Under-16 internationalist, Cheryl
Valentine.
Grove and their conquerors in last season's league cup final, Western
Klick Photopoint, have received byes in Sunday's first round. The first
division clubs all avoid each other and should progress, although
Edinburgh Ladies will have to take on Perthshire without the help of
their Great Britain stars, Rhona Simpson and Diane Renilson.
So it is likely to be the meeting of the second division clubs which
will provide most interest, with the clash between Kelburne and Stepps a
typical example. These two teams are running neck and neck in the league
at present with only goal difference separating them.
Kelburne, who now have Lynn Forsyth, the former Scottish
internationalist, leading their attack should have the edge. Forsyth hit
her first hat trick for the club in a competitive game last week and if
she is in the same frame of mind then it is Kelburne who are likely to
have most interest in the draw for the next round.

GLASGOW will host the Great Britain v France indoor match on February
24 next year, it was confirmed yesterday at the International Amateur
Athletic Federation's world fixture congress in Paris.
With further dates to be debated today, Edinburgh may be in line for
one of three outdoor meetings being sought by UK officials: Great
Britain v USA, a European permit event, or a second tier IAAF one. Due
to cash constraints, the capital backed out of hosting the USA match
last year, and that could prejudice future treatment, just as it took
years for the city to be rehabilitated after politicising the 1987 match
at which Zola Budd ran.
Glasgow, meanwhile, will seek assurances that their French visitors
will send a team of strength appropriate to the city's input. Last year,
with hardly a publicly recognisable personality in their squad, they
were thrashed 155-122 in the Kelvin Hall match.
Having hosted a civic reception which, it is claimed, was attended by
not one UK athlete, the city justifiably questions whether it might not
enjoy better value by supporting other sports.
Professor Peter Radford, the British Athletic Federation's executive
chairman, has recently promised better marketing and promotion of
events. This should extend to actively canvassing for a superior quality
French team, and cheaper seats. Last year 600 were given away at the
Kelvin Hall, though the event was billed as a sell-out.
Nor was improved marketing in evidence with the fixture schedule
delivered from Paris to Birmingham which, it was confirmed, will have
three major meetings, including the AAA indoor championships, on
successive weekends -- this in a city of high unemployment.
The AAAs will be sandwiched between the Great Britain v Russia match
(which Glasgow wanted) on January 27, and the Ricoh invitation event on
February 10.
This later meeting is one of four on a European circuit from which
overall event winners will receive $25,000 in prize money. Last year the
only UK winner in the six contested events was Linford Christie, who, to
date, has given no indication that he is prepared to run in Britain next
year, indoors or out.
With Colin Jackson adamant he will not race in the UK while Radford
remains in charge, the BAF promotions director, Ian Stewart, faces a
difficult task in assembling fields which will attract the paying
public.
This will particularly apply to the London outdoor grand prix,
scheduled for Crystal Palace on July 12, one week before the Olympic
Games open in Atlanta. This will be billed as the final pre-Olympic
chance to see the competitors. But athletes with their minds on the
ultimate honour are unlikely to be jumping over one another to race in
London.
The grand prix circuit -- though without a sponsor following the
withdrawal of Mobil -- has been expanded financially and geographically,
with new meetings in Tokyo and Moscow.
For the grand prix final, in Milan, $3.4m will be on offer for top
athletes, compared to $2.3m this year. Male and female overall winners
will collect $250,000. Athletes who break a world record will receive
$100,000, and $50,000 will be awarded for each event.
* IN her first race, a year ago this weekend in Coventry, after 18
months during which she was repeatedly told to forget about competing
again, Liz McColgan emerged victorious. On Sunday the Dundee woman
returns there, for the BUPA Great Midlands Run, over 10,000 metres.
This race, more than any other, provided weather conditions do not
conspire to spoil comparison, will let us see how far the former world
champion has progressed in her attempt to recapture and even surpass
former glories.
Only a course record, well inside the 32-38 she clocked 12 months ago,
will satisfy McColgan. ''I don't regard anything over 32 minutes as
respectable,'' said Liz, dismissing her 10k winning time in Edinburgh a
fortnight ago, on a testing course and in windy conditions.
There she recorded 32-27, fastest by any British woman this year,
while last weekend there was another season's best, over 10 miles.
Her rivals on Sunday include Heather Heasman, whom she beat by nine
seconds last year, and the Russian 10,000m champion, Klara Kashapova,
plus fellow Scot Trudi Thomson, the world ultra silver medallist from
Pitreavie.
* SHETTLESTON and Cambuslang, the district's leading exponents, have
named large and powerful men's squads from which to make their final
selection tomorrow for the West cross-country relay championships at
Lenzie. Racing Club are favourites for the East event, at Gorebridge.

TROON and Irvine are familiar towns with many places to visit in and
around them. Surrounded by six golf courses, Troon also has, at the
South Beach, the only sands in the west of Scotland to have won the Tidy
Britain Group seaside award.
The Marina sees plenty of coming and going of yachts, and there is a
splendid seaward viewpoint at the top of the Ballast Bank, built up in
Victorian times to protect the harbour. Cormorants dive for fish just
offshore.
Leave Troon on the B746 to Barassie. Leave Barassie on Kilmarnock
Road, then left, following the Kilmarnock sign. Take the first exit from
three roundabouts in succession.
This leads over a railway bridge to the extensive Irvine Beach Park,
created from a previous industrial wasteland. To the left are car parks,
grassy ridges, and walks to hilltop viewpoints.
At another roundabout, make for the Magnum Leisure Centre, open daily,
with swimming pools, an ice rink, facilities for most kinds of indoor
sports, as well as restaurants, cafeteria and bar.
Drive under the footbridge at the Magnum, then first right, and right
again onto Irvine Harbourside. This brilliant reconstruction includes an
arts centre, coffee shops and pubs, one dating from 1597. Information
boards explain the remarkable variety of birds which roost on Bogside
Flats across the river.
The Scottish Maritime Museum is open daily till the end of this month.
Boats moored at pontoons on the riverbank are part of its collection,
and you can watch rebuilding work on the famous clipper ship Carrick.
Elsewhere in Irvine, the Glasgow Vennel, where Robert Burns lodged and
worked as a flax dresser, is a museum open on Tuesday, Thursday, Friday
and Saturday. The Burns Museum in Eglinton Street, open on Saturday
afternoons, is the home of historic Irvine Burns Club.
Leave Irvine following the Kilwinning signs. Take the second exit at
Redburn roundabout and follow signs for Eglinton Country Park, taking
the first right beyond a road bridge, and first right again.
While the park's visitor centre is closed for the season, its
riversides, ponds, formal gardens and woodland paths remain open. Beside
the Lugton Water, ruined Eglinton Castle was the scene of the famous
mock-medieval Eglinton Tournament of 1839.
Return along the park entrance road, turn right at a Give Way sign,
and take the A78 as for Ayr. Turn left on the A71 as for Kilmarnock,
then take the B730 exit for Dundonald. Left at a T-junction, through
Drybridge, and cross the A759 into Dundonald.
Although officially closed for the season, Dundonald Castle stands on
an open hillside with a commanding view. Now in ruins, it was the
favourite residence of Robert II, first of the Stewart kings, who died
here in 1390.
After passing a church on your right, bear right downhill off the main
road. Climb to a spectacular summit view over Arran and Ailsa Craig, but
wait for the lay-bys farther on before stopping to enjoy it. Continue
downhill into Loans, straight on at a roundabout and return to Troon.

CHRISTMAS came early to Glasgow last night with an early present of a
cracker of a gig from Christy Moore, and a carol. Well, Shane McGowan's
Fairytale of New York is almost a carol. Mind you, the way Moore is
performing these days it might have been Away In A Manger.
There's a whole lot less republican fervour at his concerts now (the
first blatant piece of tricolourism came near the end during a song
about a football match). Sure, there's still a roar for every mention of
every town, village, and pub, but the quiet power of Moore's singing is
once again the focal point. He even ticked off someone for booing the
word ''England'', and Brits are more figures to be mildly pitied for
claiming Seamus Heaney as their own or for mispronouncing ''Derry''.
In a set that ranged across mostly tried and trusted favourites, with
Black Is The Colour dusted off with a tale of how he learned it from
Hamish Imlach in nearby Montrose Street in the 1960s, Moore sang
beautifully. He may have sung songs like Nancy Spain a thousand times
but each time they come out as if newly minted.
His diddle-like diction, too, gets better with age, as proved by Me
and The Rose, an Irish-talking blues of heroic proportions and no small
humour which he followed by conducting the audience through Rose of
Tralee before hitting a complete change of mood with The Island's bleak
account of unwanted teenage pregnancy. He finished on an upbeat, though,
with a brilliantly controlled Ride On before turning himself into a
human jukebox for the encores which caused the nearest thing to a riot
we saw all night.

Missing years of a wandering sportster
IN his book A History of Coachbuilding, the late George Oliver
described the MG J2 as an inspired design which, more than 25 years
after its introduction, showed no sign of dating in any significant way.
Its classic sports car lines influenced not only all the company's
rivals, but also every MG two-seater right up to the TF, which went out
of production in 1955.
Ashley Strachan's car was originally bought at the 1932 Scottish Motor
Show by William Warwick of Lockerbie, who registered it in January of
the following year, but could not keep up the hire-purchase payments.
It then passed to a man called Montgomerie, living in the Grosvenor
Hotel in Glasgow, and after the war to a J.V. Lillie of Knightswood. The
trail goes cold then, until the car was discovered in 1980 in the back
of a garage in Wishaw.
Like most classic car owners, Ashley Strachan, who bought the J2 in
1987 and did a two-year restoration blitz on it, would dearly like to
find out about the MG's missing years.
All the original running gear -- chassis, engine, axles and so on --
was restorable but, as so often happens, the bodywork was beyond repair
and had to be replaced.
The J2 has a 36bhp 847cc engine, with an overhead camshaft and twin
carbureterrs. MG miscalculated by tuning up the first road test car
offered to The Autocar.
Naturally, the magazine managed an exhilarating maximum speed, but the
crankshaft eventually broke under the strain, and later examples were
given a lower compression ratio. Owners complained ever after that their
cars could not match the published figures.
Ashley Strachan reckons on 65mph as the maximum for his own car, which
is ''extremely exciting'' to drive, thanks to a certain amount of wander
on the straight because of its large narrow tyres, although it holds the
road well on corners.
It won its class in the RSAC event two months ago, but has been
farther afield to rallies in Luxembourg in 1992 and 1995. Against
competition from all over Europe, it won a first-class concours award in
1992, but slipped to second this time.
Afterward, the MG was taken for a drive round the old German Grand
Prix circuit at the Nurburgring, but modern motorcycles were passing
with a 100mph speed differential, and that was perhaps an optimistic
place to give the fine old MG its head.

DRIVING the MGF, I kept thinking back to my younger days with other
MGs, the process which has egged on drivers of my generation to buy the
latest octagon-badged sports car, when they would not have considered an
open two-seater of any other make, writes Ross Finlay.
I did many miles in MGs without ever owning one, being a Riley man
myself. The first was a J2, in nothing like the condition of Ashley
Strachan's example described later. Then there was the six-cylinder
Magna which expired on a test run before a hillclimb at the Rest And Be
Thankful. The front end of the fragile crankshaft seized, and pistons
started whizzing out of the block like machine gun ricochets.
The MG TF was just appearing on the scene. Some people, unaware of
MG's financial constraints, despised this model as a cheap facelift of
the TD.
Now, however, it is regarded as a classic. It did well in club events
all over Scotland, Sandy Morrison and Jack Muir being the top rally
crew, Ian Skelly one of the most enthusiastic speed-event drivers.
Having realised that the inexpensive way into motorsport was to
navigate other people's cars in rallies, I partnered Sherwood Skelly and
Logan Morrison in their MGAs. Logan won the Scottish championship with a
1600 Mark II, and Sherwood made sure his impeccably turned-out Twin Cam
coupe had the correct maintenance regime.
John Sword and Boyd Tunnock were other MGA stalwarts in Scottish
events. I remember being awestruck when Bill Shepherd turned up to drive
one in the Highland Rally, having been a works MG driver in the Alpine
Rally.
Then came the MGB which, although the best-selling MG ever produced,
was out-dated in competition terms. One beautiful black example was
prepared for racing at Ingliston by Joe Potts of Bellshill, previously
the builder of the JP Formula Three cars of the early Fifties.
The smaller MG Midget performed well in events like autotests, and was
doing so long after production stopped with the Triumph Spitfire-engined
type which had real MG enthusiasts shuddering.
John Milne owned one of the three aluminium-bodied lightweight Midget
coupes which the Abingdon factory produced surreptitiously in 1962. He
drove it to victory in the Scottish speed championship, and the car
survives in a private collection.
MG sports cars faded out. Then the limited-production RV8 appeared. I
drove one a couple of years ago, and it later set fastest time in the
thoroughbred class at a Knockhill hill climb. The years had been
passing, though, and the driver on that occasion was from the younger
generation of the family.
* FANCY one of the new MGF sports cars, with all the performance,
style and nostalgia the latest two-seater with the famous octagon badge
has put back on the road? You can win one in our forthcoming MGF
competition. Look for full details in The Herald on Saturday October 28.

IN late Victorian times steam, electric and petrol cars all had their
adherents. John Starley, later to found Rover, ran a battery-powered
three-wheeler in Coventry in 1888. Fred Kimball started producing
electric cars in the US during the same year, writes Ross Finlay.
Krieger in France was selling them in some numbers by the turn of the
century, and Ferdinand Porsche's first car was propelled by hub-mounted
electric motors. By 1912, an estimated 20,000 electric vehicles were
running on US roads -- or, at least, on US city streets.
Everywhere, though, electric cars faded as motorists' ambitions grew.
Like their one-time rivals the steamers, they simply could not match the
long-distance capabilities of petrol machines.
Earlier on, a French battery-powered Jeantaud set the inaugural land
speed record of 38.24mph.
The first vehicle to beat the mile-a-minute target was Camille
Jenatzy's La Jamais Contente, shaped like an artillery shell on wheels,
which was timed at 65mph during a famous competition in 1899 at Acheres,
west of Paris.
La Jamais Contente now languishes in the motor museum at Compiegne.
Jenatzy's record of 96 years ago marked the last time the
battery-powered car had a performance advantage.

Ross Finlay cuts through the fog about zero-emission vehicles to
report on the real costs of battery-powered cars
HOW many times have you been to the toilet this week, and what
happened when you got there? The questions are not as out of place as
they may seem, because they have a bearing on the debate about
zero-emission vehicles.
Thanks largely to forthcoming Californian legislation, the
environmentalist lobby has been arguing the case for the battery-powered
electric car. Several car-makers are pushing ahead with research and
development, some on pure battery-powered cars and others on hybrid
designs.
Kia, for example, recently unveiled its experimental KEV-4 prototype.
It has an array of batteries with a certain amount of recharging via an
inertia braking system, plus some solar cells to generate electricity
for its air-conditioning, as well as an 800cc fossil fuel engine for
auxiliary power. Simple it is not.
Engineers looking at the future of the motor vehicle often regard the
whole idea of battery power as a joke. Years ahead, we may see cars with
fuel cells which generate their electricity by on-board chemical means,
but the rechargeable storage battery of the lead-acid type most familiar
today is a hopeless long-term transport project.
There is the perennial problem of range between charging sessions, and
the storage battery itself is grotesquely inefficient.
Dan Wright, of Albion Automotive in Glasgow, quotes figures to support
that view. Energy output can be measured in kilojoules, and he makes the
point that a typical lead-acid battery will produce about 42 kilojoules
of energy per kilogramme of its own weight.
To the layman, that sounds quite impressive, but a gallon of petrol or
diesel fuel will produce something like 42,000 kilojoules for every
kilogramme it weighs. Conventional fuel wins by a margin of 1000 to one.
Lithium batteries, as used in an electrically-powered Volvo truck
prototype, are much more efficient than the lead-acid type, but they
produce only 70 kilojoules per kilogramme.
A consortium made up of Ford, General Motors, Chrysler and the battery
maker Varta has been given millions of dollars of US government money to
fund a project developing better batteries for vehicle propulsion. Dan
Wright reckons it would be just as well building a bonfire and burning
the dollar bills.
The colossal weight disadvantage of storage batteries also concerns
Alan Riach, of the East Kilbride consultancy firm FTD. He argues that
the advocates of battery-powered cars have not yet grasped the fatal
inefficiency of these vehicles.
''Aircraft designers know that anything you don't really need in an
aeroplane should be left on the ground. Ground vehicles are similar. If
you build an electric vehicle with 32 batteries installed, 16 will be
there just to move the other 16 around.''
He recalls a battery-powered Leyland bus design. To allow for
passenger heating, the prototype had a paraffin heater on board, because
the number of extra batteries needed to provide the same amount of
warmth would have been out of the question.
So what about the bowel movement business? The point is that, from the
early days of land transport, represented by humans walking on their own
two feet, there has been no such thing as a zero-emission method of
moving around. Like draught animals, we take in fuel in the form of
food, work it off, and then eject the waste material.
In modern times, the equivalent is exhaust emissions. There are none
from pure battery-powered vehicles, but that does not by any means make
them environmentally friendly. From the moment their power is generated
to the moment when they expire, they are nothing like as ''green'' as
their admirers suggest.
The electricity which comes out of the sockets into which their
charging leads are plugged has to be generated somewhere. Current
produced by hydro-electric generation -- or solar panels, or wind farms,
or wave power -- may be fair enough, but there is precious little of
that about worldwide.
Many engineers are firmly convinced that the long-term future of
electricity generation is by nuclear fusion, which is ''clean'' compared
with the fission process. At the moment, the electricity from the wall
sockets is most likely generated by nuclear fission, coal-fired or
oil-fired stations.
Battery-powered vehicles simply transfer the emissions from themselves
to somewhere else. Cynics in California say that a zero-emissions
electric vehicle is one whose electricity is generated in New Mexico.
Another thing to be considered is the battery itself. If the world's
road transport were converted to lead-acid battery propulsion, there
would not be enough lead to sustain it, in all the lead mines on the
planet.
How about sodium-sulphur batteries? They need very high working
temperatures, and what might happen to a sodium-sulphur equipped vehicle
in a crash worries most people who have studied the problem.
Lithium batteries? Cadmium batteries? They will always be expensive,
and such batteries have a finite life. In a year or 18 months, the whole
battery pack in a vehicle might have to be replaced, at very high cost.
And hold on a minute . . . lead, acid, sulphur, cadmium . . . These
are all very nasty substances from the point of view of eventual
disposal and containment of the waste. Some of the people who argue the
case for the battery-powered car would have a fit, in other
circumstances, if their use were suggested.
Electric vehicles do have a niche in city-centre applications, as
schemes operated in France by Citroen and Peugeot have shown. Electric
milk floats have been around for years, and many city authorities,
including Glasgow's, used to operate virtually silent but fantastically
heavy battery-powered dustcarts.
Trams, trolleybuses and electric trains, of course, take their power
from central generating stations, not from batteries.
Thomas Edison, who held more than 1300 patents for electrical
inventions, and was the first man in the world to build a central
generating station, once said: ''The storage battery is one of those
peculiar things which appeal to the imagination . . .
''Just as soon as a man gets working on the secondary battery, it
brings out his latent capacity for lying . . . Scientifically, storage
is all right, but commercially, as absolute a failure as one can
imagine.''
Admittedly, Edison died in 1931. He had his own commercial axes to
grind, and the scientific world has progressed a long way since his
time. However, that quotation was included in a paper handed out,
silently but with a meaningful look, at a press conference 60 years
after Edison's death, by a senior development engineer from Ford.

Dunoon is getting set to jazz it up in a big way. Keith Bruce
describes the zest of a fest.
BEFORE one of the nation's top popular music combos brought its tour
of seaside towns to Dunoon, GMTV's man in Scotland Ray Stewart visited
the Clyde Coast resort to gauge the opinion of the locals.
''What do you think of Blur?'' he asked the bemused citizenry. The
response was remarkably consistent, with a typical reply along the lines
of: ''I don't like him as much as John Smith.''
If they are not pop-literate, the denizens of Dunoon have less excuse
for not knowing their jazz. This weekend sees the fourth Dunoon Jazz
Festival -- some 60 gigs in three days, an intensity of programming that
guarantees something for everyone.
Olive Millen, who has run the event since its inception, is pleased
that there is evidence that local people are beginning to take the
festival on board. She estimates that around 2% of her audience is local
with the rest taking the ferry to the jazz.
''I hope that creeps up. To begin with folk were standing back
wondering what was going to happen, but last year I noticed groups of
younger local people going to see the younger bands.''
The festival was not envisaged as an attraction for the locals in any
case. It was established after the US Navy pulled out of the town and
when unemployment stood at 23%. October -- a ''shoulder month'' in
tourist-industry speak -- was traditionally holiday time for the
hoteliers, but the bookings for the jazz festival has put a stop to
that. Many have also learned to adjust their timetable to accommodate
late-night jam sessions by moving the availability of breakfast somewhat
later in the day.
The question of access to the music is one that exercises the mind of
the star of this year's event, pianist Julian Joseph. He has recently
leapt to public attention with a stunning promenade concert at the Royal
Albert Hall with his big band, broadcast live on BBC television and
radio. The sole jazz content in John Drummond's last season, it was the
fruit of discussions between the Prom director and the pianist over the
past couple of years.
''I've had a very positive response from musicians and from the public
-- I'm even being recognised in the street,'' says Joseph. It is a
complement that is reciprocated: the pianist is one of the most
attentive musicians when it comes to gaugeing the response of his
audience, and is unimpressed by the current vogue for money-spinning
''safe'' collections of standards.
''You have to properly read what the audience might like. I'll play
originals if I feel they are varied enough to present a full picture of
jazz music. There is a wave of conservativism sweeping through jazz
music and musicians are not in control of the repertoire. There is a
difference between utilising the influence of the past and basically
just copying.''

The octagonal badge will be familiar, but the new MGF is a departure
from the much-loved MG lines, reports Ross Finlay
THOUGH it was planned at a time when Rover had Honda as a partner, and
has come on the market now that Rover is a BMW subsidiary, the MGF is a
British design through and through. BMW's only contribution -- apart, of
course, from not cancelling the project -- was to identify a supplier of
the cold-drawn tubing which provides internal strengthening to the
two-seater's windscreen pillars.
The fact that the average age of MGF buyers so far is no less than 57
suggests that many of them are people who had a sporty MG, perhaps third
or fourth-hand and run on a shoestring budget, back in their carefree
younger days.
Nostalgia plays a part here, but the design team's brief was to
respect MG's heritage, without being slaves to it. So, although the
famous octagonal badge is prominently displayed, this is the first MG
production sports car in 70 years to abandon the traditional
front-engine, rear-drive layout, in favour of the mid-engine approach.
It gives the MGF a light front end, and freedom from the torque steer
which affects so many front-wheel-drive GTis. Handling balance is
excellent at enthusiastic cornering speeds, but there is always the
chance, with this layout, of coming unstuck at over-ambitious speeds if
the tail snaps out quicker than the driver can correct it.
The mid-engine layout allows a low bonnet line. There is no luggage
space up front to complement the modest but sufficient boot located
behind the engine. Hot air from the engine compartment must, of course,
escape somewhere, and one of the places it does so is through the boot,
so that it would be unwise to keep a few bars of chocolate, say, in a
case or squashy bag there.
A snug-fitting hood -- with a trimmed hardtop as a #995 option -- and
a passenger cabin which is roomier than it seems when you see an MGF
hood-up from behind, combine to make this a comfortable all-weather car.
The driving position is fine, the fascia design with its cream-faced
instruments is neat, while the gear lever could do with being a little
shorter and stubbier. Late in the pre-production process it was
discovered that the original sun visor design obscured too much of the
screen. Rover admits that the fiddly little flap visors now fitted look
rather peculiar.
The base model 1.8i costs #15,995, sprints to 60mph in eight
and-a-half seconds, and goes on to a test-track maximum of 120mph. Not
yet in the showrooms, the #17,995 VVC model with its 145bhp engine,
0-60mph time of seven seconds, and top speed of 130mph, is a Nineties
equivalent of the MGA Twin Cam compared with the ordinary MGA.
Out on the road, the MGF feels lively, easy to place, and really at
home on sweeping combinations of bends. Many owners will be quite happy
with the more direct feel of the ordinary steering rather than the
electrically controlled power-assistance which is a #550 option on the
1.8i, though standard on the VVC.
Uniquely for a sports car, the MGF uses Hydragas interconnected
suspension. It gives the MGF a more sophisticated feel than most of its
rivals. There is a sure-footedness on corners, and a more supple ride on
rumpled surfaces.
The test route included one incredibly bumpy stretch of minor road
ending with an unexpected hump-backed bridge. It was like hurtling along
an aircraft carrier deck surfaced with sleeping policemen, then being
launched up into the air. I thought the suspension, wheel-pattering like
mad, and the very stiff body structure, acquitted themselves well.
Rover has the capacity to build about 20,000 MGFs per year. There are
no admitted plans, following Rover's sales disaster there with the
Sterling, to sell them in the US, which used to be MG's biggest market.
More positively, company chiefs insist that all future MGs will be
genuine sports cars, with no absurdities like the Farina-box saloons of
the Fifties, or the Montego Turbo which virtually defined uncontrollable
torque steer.
Taking everything into consideration, it is a pleasure to welcome MG
back to the sports car fold.

A NEW service centre will be the focal point for visitors to Kip this
weekend. A range of powerboats will be on view, under cover obviously,
with a balcony to give mezzanine-style access for interested parties.
It is also a first-time display of the new custom-built workshop,
where a wide range of work and maintenance can be carried out on six
powerboats at a time.
The marina people say there are no problems about owners doing work on
their boats themselves -- sometimes a stumbling block elsewhere -- but
expert assistance is always at hand if needed. And that is available,
pretty well all the year round.
This is a good-sized facility, costing in the region of #350,000 all
in, at 65ft long, with a doorway height of 21ft, and width of 18ft 6in.
Most Clyde craft can get in.
''Boat details will be kept on computer,'' marina master Duncan
Chalmers adds. ''We will be able to offer dates to suit customers, and
attract people from outwith the marina itself.''
Also for the boating fraternity, marine engineer Douglas McHugh is
offering covered winter storage at Cairndow, at the head of Loch Fyne,
for anyone who wants to bring in a trailer-sailer. It's a first-time
facility, suiting 18 to 26-footers, at around #10 per foot.
A bit farther out is Craobh marina. Lots of room for winter storage,
afloat or ashore, full facilities at hand. It can cope with craft around
100ft, and covered workshop facilities take boats up to 54ft.
Port Edgar has the local authority-run marina facilities. That
includes indoor and outdoor storage space, as manager Robin Strang
points out.
It means room for around 150 yachts and 100 dinghies outside, and
space for 80 boats in the former naval sheds. Chandlery, brokerage and
repair facilities are all at hand.
''We tend to charge less for our facilities, but we do cover our
costs,'' says Robin. ''We have lots of sailing visitors to the East
Coast these days.''

Finding a good buy at the weekend should be plain sailing, says
Stewart Fraser
MARINAS are putting on a special show this weekend, to attract
yachting and boating enthusiasts from far and wide.
At Kip, for example, around 150 vessels will be on view -- at the
pontoons or on the hard. It's described as Scotland's eighth national
second-hand boat show, and for the first time, there will be a special
display of powerboats in the marina's new workshop.
Up to 10,000 visitors from throughout the United Kingdom are expected
at the show, which runs from 10am today to 7pm on Sunday.
''There's no hard sell,'' promises sales manager George McDiarmid.
''There is a clear feeling the country is moving out of the recession,
and this is reflected in increasing interest in owning a boat. Everyone
will be doing all they can to make the show a success.''
Families are always welcome at the show, and craft available range
from rubber dinghies at a few hundred pounds, right up to a 52-footer at
rather more.
''There is great interest in this show,'' adds marina master Duncan
Chalmers. ''In addition to a splendid selection of craft, there is
coffee and snacks in one marquee and a range of specialists in the trade
marquee as well. We believe there is no other place in the UK so
dedicated to making boat buying easy and pleasant.''
There's friendly rivalry from Largs yacht haven for other Scottish
marinas.
The Euroyachts people reckon that their show -- which lasts from from
Saturday to next Sunday -- will have more than 100 boats, including
around 30% in the growing powerboat category.
''We have a good range on view, from 20ft to 55ft, with easy access
and boarding for visitors from the floating berths,'' says Angus Scott.
''There are some special attractions available, including having the
cost of a survey and a lift-out reduced by 50%. Just ask us.''
''There are also two restaurants, a bistro, a provision shop, a
chandlery, a diving equipment shop, an art gallery, charter and tuition,
and various workshops.''
Rhu marina is showing off its development plans, as well as offering
new and second-hand boats for sale.
There is what the marina calls a ''general open day'', with the local
Royal Northern club joining in, offering hospitality and catering to
make things go with a swing over the weekend.
Storage rates incidentally, on the hard and masts down, for 26ft and
smaller boats are #15 a foot, excluding the dreaded VAT.
Along at Blochairn, the powerboat specialists Prosser Marine have
their own show, with some interesting possibilities on offer.
''Actually, we are into boat sales all the time,'' says Stan Prosser.
''What we can offer this weekend, however, is certainly going to be of
special interest to our visitors.''
What he offers is a #500 discount, no less, on the craft that are on
brokerage. And there is an indication of a year's free servicing into
the bargain. Certainly worth an inspection.
Boats on show range from inflatables all the way to those super-duper
eight-berth cruisers that seem big enough to take a wedding party.
''Don't forget,'' Stan adds, ''we offer our customers free storage.
There is expert preparation and valeting, plus 24-hour security of
course. At any time, we have around 100 powerboats under cover, not out
in the rain, and ready for inspection. We are always interested in
trade-ins, and we have four-wheel-drive vehicles as well.''
Add in the claim that the company can offer the lowest charges for
servicing and laying-up in the area, and it looks like Blochairn might
also be worth a visit this weekend. There's no charge for looking.

WHEN my mother, an 84-year-old devoted adherent of the Free Church of
Scotland, died five years ago, I found myself in a congregation of
mourners subjected to an arrogant display of theological gymnastics.
That, at least, is how I felt about it.
I had to resist strongly the urge to heckle, and I'd find it hard to
believe that any other sane person would have reacted differently to a
funeral service where there was no formal acknowledgement that the
deceased had ever even existed, and where the presiding minister (''One
who administers or proffers, in service or kindness,'' Chambers
Twentieth Century Dictionary) chose as a suitable text the third chapter
of Genesis.
It begins with the serpent, who quickly enters into dialogue with the
woman, and it contains the verse: ''Unto the woman he said, I will
greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt
bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he
shall rule over thee''.
It is perhaps hard for us, in the late twentieth century, to
understand the profound psychological impact that that one verse alone
has had on our society, and particularly on that half of our numbers who
have been its particular victims.
I have heard my mother deny that she had the right even to be member
of the village grazings committee, which made such world-shaking
decisions as whether to spend a few pounds on repairing the fence that
stood between their cattle and a potentially dangerous sheer drop.
The ''likes of her'' shouldn't have been on that committee, she felt
-- purely because she was a woman.
I have also heard the most able and articulate feminists I know (those
dangerously aggressive monsters!) acknowledge that they have frequently,
to their own legitimate annoyance, deferred to the opinions of a more
assertive male colleague -- not because he was right, but because he was
assertive.
When we count the proportion of women in our population, then measure
the gender balance in public life, politically and economically, it
seems reasonable to me to assume that we have a long way to go before
those ancient, and continuing, wrongs are righted.
There is a big, big difference between conspiracy and conditioning.
The former can be exposed for what it is, but conditioning requires long
and intensive courses of therapy -- for all concerned.
A break with the psychological gerrymandering we have all endured
would be a start.

WITH regard to John Macleod's article on ''gender gymnastics'', Ruth
Wishart stated that she found it necessary to comment on a fellow
journalist's work because ''so much of the text was unadjacent to the
truth that it demands a response'' (October 11).
She, however, does not adhere to the truth about what John Macleod
actually said, which was not that women lacked ambition or ability, but
that this was the implication of the feminists' own logic, which he
found insulting to women.
It was also incorrect for her to suggest that the arrival of the
universal franchise was only ''tinkering'' with democracy. Indeed, it
was a major step forward. In contrast the gender selection of
parliamentary candidate shortlists is indeed a manipulation of
democracy.
Finally, in resorting to the accusation of misogyny, Ruth Wishart is
exhibiting a classic sympom of Macleod-phobia, and of the bankruptcy of
her argument.

THE Conservatives say that they are a caring party. Who do they care
about? Certainly not the poor and underprivileged. Tax cuts mean nothing
to people who do not pay tax. All that tax cuts mean is that through
backdoor taxation the poor are getting poorer.
Unemployment figures are dropping. Where? Figures can easily be
manipulated. What about the people who are unemployed and are discounted
because they are no longer eligible for unemployment benefit?
What is needed to inject some hope for the future of the UK is not tax
cuts. What is needed is an injection of real capital into the economy.
Not by backdoor taxation, but by an increase in direct taxation at the
source. People with high incomes can absorb indirect taxes. People on
low incomes cannot.
High wage-earners should pay a little bit more. What does another 2 or
3% mean? It could mean either opening up closed hospital wards or giving
schools new books and more teachers.
I am not a top wage-earner but I would gladly pay that little extra to
make sure our society does not become one divided between those that
either have or have not. I would like to see Britain prospering again
with people sharing. Only government intervention and the building-up of
the welfare state can make this possible.
By ignoring the poor and underprivileged, then the rut this county is
in will keep getting deeper. The poor do not want charity, only help to
become a part of society again.

THE Channel Tunnel company is not generating sufficient income to pay
the interest on its loans let alone enough to repay the capital and pay
dividends to shareholders.
Someone should tell the Government that a very interesting trial run
has just been made here in Scotland. The Skye Bridge company has been
protected by the simple expedient of banning the competing ferry
operation, thus handing the bridge a monopoly and denying travellers a
choice.
All it needs now is for our Secretary of State to tell John Major
about it, and for him in turn to instruct Stena and P&amp;O, etc, not to
provide any more Channel crossings for the next 25 years or so in order
that the tunnel has a chance to repay its loans and the shareholders
receive some dividends.

YOUR correspondent Mr Bill Cruickshank urges Labour activists to join
him in the SNP on the grounds that no self-respecting socialist could
stay in a party which so openly welcomes an acknowledged right-winger
like Alan Howarth (October 11).
Is this the same SNP which so openly welcomed that well-known
right-winger, Mr Iain Lawson, into its ranks when he deserted the
Thatcherite Tory Party? Is it the same SNP which so enthusiastically
embraced Murdoch's Sun? Is it the same SNP which joined the Tories in
the voting lobbies and saved John Major at the height of the Maastricht
crisis?
At the recent Perth and Kinross by-election where his party's
''socialist'' candidate was elected, I stood on the gate with an SNP
activist who openly admitted he had been a convinced Tory councillor
until recently but had decided to join the alternative party nearest to
his own political convictions without itself being the Tory Party. He
meant, of course, the SNP.
In a democracy people are free to choose their own parties. I have no
doubt that there may be socialists in the SNP. I think they are wrong.
However, I would never accuse them of lacking in self-respect for having
made their choice.
For my part, as a self-respecting socialist, I am happy to belong to
the only political party in Scotland with direct links to the Scottish
labour and trade-union movement; the only major political party in
Scotland which proclaims itself to be socialist in its constitution; and
the only political party in Scotland which can win the next election,
win for Scotland its own democratically elected parliament, and create
the political conditions in which the people, not the zealots, will
decide their way forward for themselves.

JIMMY Reid's New Labour and New Tory article was the third such piece
from him since April (October 9). On each occasion he has charted
Labour's swing to the right and has basically stated that in his opinion
there is now virtually no difference between the Tories and New Labour.
Mr Reid has yet to enlighten readers as to what he intends to do about
it. If I shared Mr Reid's view about New Labour I think I would be
seriously considering transferring my support to another political
party.
There is one political party in Scotland whose views and policies do
not vary a great deal from those held by Mr Reid. In recent years it has
had a number of new recruits from disillusioned Labour members and
supporters. Perhaps it's time he puts up or shuts up.

THE Herald billboard just outside a shop in my constituency carried a
dire message: ''Scottish Opera To Go Part Time''. It was not the
marketing department's greatest triumph. The newsagent's serves a
housing scheme in a town with mere 20% unemployment.
I fear the fate of Scottish Opera did not rate high among the
citizenry's priorities. I wondered, indeed, if a single patron of that
heavily shuttered retail outlet had ever darkened the door of the
Theatre Royal.
This is not the preamble to a diatribe against spending large sums of
public money in support of the higher-falutin' branches of the arts.
Neither does it denote any lack of sympathy for those who face
redundancy or part-time working.
On that score, my constituents could relate to the plight of Scottish
Opera's workforce, both musical and manual. A job is a job and no job is
no job whether it's in a factory or an opera house.
But perhaps a little bit of perspective, even humility, is required
before the cause becomes too celebre. If money is to support opera, at a
rate disproportionate to other art forms, we should at least have a
clear idea of why it is being done.
It should not be because a few influential people succeed in ensuring
that their special pleading takes precedence over all others. That
becomes particularly true if Scottish Opera's lobbyists, in their zeal,
display disregard for, or even hostility towards, these ''others''.
Opera is not my own greatest enthusiasm, but that is neither here nor
there. I do not begrudge the public money which supports it because it
is integral to my whole outlook that worth should not be measured by
money.
Civilised societies should support anything which is enriching on
merit, rather than on the basis of bean-counting. So if opera's
financial needs are disproportionate to the numbers enjoying it, then so
be it.
That is a generalised approach which I would commend to supporters of
Scottish Opera. The moment they start playing the ''either-or'' game,
they are likely to shed goodwill faster than you can say La Traviata.
These thoughts were encouraged by an article which appeared in last
Saturday's London Times under the name of one Richard Morrison. It
ranked high on the scales of both self-interest and divisiveness.
The prospect of Scottish Opera doing a deal with another of Scotland's
orchestras, rather than having one to itself, is an option which it
would prefer not to coutenance. Since I'm greatly in favour of keeping
music live and musicians in work, I would probably be on its side.
But even I must admit to being underwhelmed by Mr Morrison's
apocalyptic assertion that ''an opera company that has to borrow
somebody's else's orchestra is sliding to oblivion''.
Mr Morrison then bemoaned that lottery money could only be used to
support capital projects rather than to underwrite a #750,000 deficit. I
am not sure, on the other hand, how honoured Scotland's
lottery-investing public would feel if appointed to the role of on-going
subsidy providers for Scottish Opera.
I'm pretty certain there will be more lottery players in my
constituency newsagent's than in the grand circle of the Theatre Royal.
At some point, that reality will have to be reflected in how the money
is spent.
But then Mr Morrison comes to his punchline: ''Scottish Opera's
predicament is partly the result of Scotland's chosen arts priorities.
The #4.7m given to Scottish Opera must be seen in the context, for
instance, of a whopping #8.7m given to something called the Gaelic TV
Fund and another #1.9m for Gaelic education.''
Must it? Why, Mr Morrison? What earthly connection is there between
the Gaelic TV Fund, which does not impinge upon Arts Council funding at
all, and the difficulties of Scottish Opera?
What conceivable comparison is there between giving children the
opportunity to be educated through their own language and the fact that
Scottish Opera is short of cash? Would redundant teachers or actors or
technicians (whose crime is to work through Gaelic) be a lesser price to
pay than a part-time Scottish Opera?
If this was an arguement which cropped up in a single article, however
foolish, it could be ignored. But it has a tendency to rear its head
with disturbing regularity; so much so that it would appear to be on
offer from some central source. Surely not Scottish Opera?
I am under no illusion. The patrons of my constituency newsagent would
not, if consulted, put Gaelic at the top of their spending priorities
either. But I suspect it would command significantly more sympathy than
opera.
However, Gaelic is merely a surrogate for sniping at. Close to the
heart of this debate about Scottish Opera lies a battle within the
Scottish Arts Council over its right and proper attempts to move just a
little funding away from opera and orchestras towards what might loosely
be called the traditional arts.
If Scotland were asked to pass judgment on that proposition, I have no
doubt which way the vote would go. Scottish Opera should argue its case
on its considerable merits and recognise that there is no future in
looking for something weaker than itself to attack. As a tactic, that is
likely to be as unproductive as it is unprincipled.

THE term ''new'' may be defined as something which is ''markedly
different from that which was before''. Is New Labour markedly
different? Two recent developments in the Labour Party provide a clear
answer.
Liz Davies, a lifelong Labour Party member, elected Labour councillor,
and selected by a Leeds Constituency Labour Party as a prospective
parliamentary candidate, is held unsuitable for such office by Labour's
National Executive.
On the other hand Alan Howarth, Conservative MP for
Stratford-upon-Avon since 1983, former vice-chairman of the Conservative
Party, and unelected by any Labour Party supporter, is heartily endorsed
by Blair, Prescott, et al.
Down on the Staffordshire farm the Orwellian pigs chant a new slogan:
''Right-wing, good -- left-wing, bad''. Meanwhile Farmer Blair is having
meetings with media moguls and attracting praise from such distinguished
personages as Baroness Thatcher and Lord Tebbit, who only a few short
years ago were referring to socialists as ''the enemy within''.
I don't know what the bard of Avon would have to say about such
political chicanery but the bard of Ayrshire certainly covered it when
he wrote: ''Of Lordly acquaintance you boast, And the Dukes that you
dined with yestreen; Yet an insect's an insect at most, though it crawl
on the curl of a Queen''.

LIVESTOCK producers worried by widespread claims that consumers are
turning to vegetarianism might find further cause for concern in an
official report which appears to prove British households have cut their
meat purchases sharply.
The Whitehall-sponsored National Food Survey shows ''consumption of
carcase meat declined by 9%'' between early 1994 and summer this year,
according to a summary issued by Ministry of Agriculture information
officers in London.
This is the latest in a series of consumer market studies which have
caused unease among food industry and meat production executives. They
believe the survey results can be used by anti-meat pressure groups to
give unjustified authority to vegetarian campaigns.
Criticism is not directed at market research in itself, but rather at
the over-simplification of survey results. Analysts, including Meat and
Livestock Commission economists, say they often see statistics creating
misleading impressions by being quoted out of context. They regard the
potential damage as especially serious in the case of the National Food
Survey results because these figures have implicit Government backing.
The 9% drop reported in carcase meat consumption is among the latest
NFS findings in an unusually stark example of a dangerous statistic. Any
farmer seeing it quoted without qualification might reasonably conclude
that extreme vegetarian campaigners are right in claiming half the
population will have given up meat-eating by the end of the decade.
In the fact the ministry's summary of the survey findings also says:
''Total household consumption of meat and meat producers was
unchanged.'' But even this is not much consolation for the red meat
industry, because it continues: ''Consumption of poultry increased by
12%.''
The apparently straightforward message is of consumers deserting beef,
lamb and pork in droves, and buying chicken instead -- not quite what
the vegetarians want to hear, but mildly encouraging for them
nevertheless.
As these survey results show household consumption of poultry
overtaking all carcase red meats combined, the impression is all the
more startling.
Yet as MLC marketing director Gwyn Howells pointed out at the launch
of the commission's latest promotion campaign: ''Total meat consumption
is surprisingly stable over long periods.''
On the face of it, the NFS flatly contradicts Mr Howell's claim, but a
few minutes spent analysing the statistics detailing the survey results
can demonstrate that his is broadly the more accurate interpretation.
Much of the confusion arises because the ministry statisticians' term
''carcase meat'' is misleading. In the NFS context it means only meat
sold retail in the most traditional form, as it comes off the bone and
with no further processing except perhaps mincing -- but shoppers buy
surprisingly little of their meat this way any longer.
Leaving aside poultry, only about a third of all retail meat and meat
product volume is sold by butchers and supermarkets as traditional cuts
like steaks, chops or roasting joints. Shoppers purchase far more as
sausages, burgers, pies and the great profusion of new meat-based
products appearing in supermarket freezer cabinets over the last few
years.
This means the ''headline'' figure of a 9% drop in carcase meat sales
relate to fairly small proportion of the total market. Taking the
broader measures of meat consumption shown in the NFS survey, it is
clear that there is a continuing drift from red meat to poultry. But the
drop in volume consumption of beef, lamb and pork and all the meat
products based on them seems to have been closer to 3% than to the
alarming 9% -- worrying evidence that demand for red meat is still
slipping, as it has been for many years, but certainly not a signal that
the vegetarians have won.

IT would not be wise to be overly optimistic about Bosnia's 36th
ceasefire, although it appears to be holding, after a fashion, in most
areas of the country. Nevertheless, there are a number of reasons why
this particular truce might last long enough to allow the politicians,
pushed and cajoled by the United States, to make their shaky agreement
concrete. The involvement of the US, with all the power and influence
which it can bring to bear on the situation, is crucial. As the major
power involved, Washington could have intervened decisively long ago,
but for a variety of reasons connected with internal politics, declined
to do so. This is a pity; the current ceasefire shows what could have
been achieved earlier. An extra, and vitally important factor is the
fact that the present division of the territory of Bosnia between the
combatants reflects accurately the division brokered by the Contact
Group which in itself provides the basis for Mr Holbrooke's
negotiations.
The potential for a more lasting peace is strengthened by the fact
that the Bosnian Serbs are now unlikely to receive much help from
President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, while the Croats would be
foolish to jeopardise their recent gains by more fighting. The Bosnian
government relies heavily on the support it receives from the United
States but because of this is most unlikely to defy Washington by
breaking the ceasefire in any significant way. It is true that fighting
continues in the bitterly contested north-west, where the effort to grab
territory before peace is imposed is most intractable. But even there it
is recognised that potential gains are limited and United Nations
military sources understand perfectly well that it is militarily
impossible for all fighting in all areas to be brought to a halt in a
few hours.
Matters, then, should be set reasonably fair for the continuation of
the negotiations which should take place over the next 60 days in the
United States. This does not mean that peace, if it is established, will
be immune to criticism. It will be, after all, based on a partition
which has been achieved by force and by a division of territory which
involves the acceptance of the detestable fact of ''ethnic cleansing''
with all that this has involved in human suffering. Nor will the
negotiations be easy. The question of the future of Sarajevo will be
particularly difficult, as will matters in the north. The relationship
between the Croats and the Bosnian government is uneasy. Overshadowing
it all is the realisation that, although the peace plan calls for Bosnia
to remain a single country, albeit with Bosnian Serb, Muslim, and Croat
entities, the Bosnian Serbs and probably the Croats will be keen to
emphasise partition. The Bosnian government, on the other hand, is keen
to emphasise central government control. Whether these circles can be
squared is a difficult question. There is, however, no alternative.
Somehow the peace plan must be made to work, and the best chance of
making this happen is for the international community to unite behind it
without reservation.

THE Chancellor let no cats out of the bag at Blackpool yesterday,
though all know that he would love to cut personal taxation. Quite apart
from feeling that theirs is a party of lower rather than higher taxes,
the Tories suspect that they have no chance of being returned at the
next election if they cannot be seen to start to reverse the additional
personal taxation imposed since the country's ejection from the exchange
rate mechanism in 1992. Mr Clarke would not jib at that analysis but the
convention is that the contents of the Budget have to remain sacrosanct
until proclaimed in its statement. The most he can do is hint and look
cheerful; and as that is his natural style he managed it well enough.
The hint is qualified by the constant reminder that he will only act if
it seems prudent to do so.
He has little choice: were anything to suggest imprudence his whole
financial strategy would collapse along with the standing of sterling on
the currency markets. Yet he has to give hope, and the fact is that
there is an ability to deliver reduced taxation, though it will be much
less than the more extreme Tories would like. There will still be a
budget deficit, but few Chancellors have been deterred by that since
1945, and the real knack may well turn out to be how Mr Clarke contrives
his resources as well as how he allocates them. It would be better if
the Chancellor retained such resources and used them positively within
the economy, but the need for re-election is bound to drive him, as it
certainly does drive many of the near-hundred Tory MPs whose seats would
be vulnerable to anything akin to the swings seen in recent
by-elections. The coming Budget will be thoroughly political (Mr Clarke
is a very political Chancellor, though his restraint so far has been
remarkable) and it would be naive to expect him to behave like some
academic economist in a think-tank.
The only acceptable alternative, in a political context, to lower
personal taxation is lower interest rates. It now looks as if that may
be a harder task than it would have seemed only a few days ago: the
evidence of last month's inflationary pressures means that interest-rate
reduction will have to be postponed until it becomes clearer whether the
inflationary surge disclosed was indeed the outcome of short-term
special effects, as the stock market seems to have believed, rather than
a new generalised movement. Lower interest rates would be socially
preferable to lower taxes if a choice had to be made between them (Mr
Clarke is bound to have been hoping for a bit of both). For one thing
there will be more beneficiaries from lower interest rates, though the
tax-cutting option would give Mr Clarke the chance to help low earners
who still pay income tax from very modest incomes. Cheaper money would,
however, help mortgage payers who have, according to the latest data
from the Woolwich building society, experienced a fresh swing into
negative equity, the disturbing situation where the value of a property
is less than the loan still outstanding on it.
The increase affects nearly all areas of the country but remains
especially marked in the south of England, the former Tory heartland
which has turned so savagely against the Government in by-elections,
Euro-elections, and local government elections. If that situation
prevails, Mr Blair will be in Number 10 (possibly dependent on Mr
Ashdown). The only comfort is that two years ago 70% of all negative
equity was concentrated in the south, whereas the present position is
that only 60% is now there. That looks like a definite improvement but
the position is still fluid, and the Woolwich figures show how easily it
can be for the flows to reverse. Mr Clarke is, therefore, expected to
have something in the bag next month, and to be able to promise
something else for next year. It may not be enough to reverse the
existing tide of opinion but it could reduce the scale of its flow. Some
Tories would maybe settle for that, defeat but not wipe-out, but the
optimists are hoping for more.

NOT for the first time John Macleod has got it completely wrong. His
assault on the Scottish Constitutional Convention's attempt to achieve a
Scottish parliament with roughly equal numbers of men and women members
(October 10) proceeds on a totally erroneous premise, namely that gender
equality in the Scottish parliament will be imposed by law.
Not so. In fact the set-up now proposed has been developed precisely
because all parties to the convention would not agree to gender equality
being imposed by law.
The background. The convention parties agreed long ago that the
Scottish parliament should more closely reflect the electorate than does
Westminster. That meant some form of proportional representation (or at
least something other than pure first-past-the-post) so that the
political make-up would more closely tie in with votes cast. It also
meant addressing gender inequality.
Mr Macleod does not deny that there are a very small number of women
MPs. In Scotland there are a handful. The real cause of this is not that
most female aspiring MPs are latter-day Lucrezia Borgias or lesbians
kept safely out by sane and sensible selection committees of all shades,
as Mr Macleod would have us believe.
The real cause is inertia, pure and simple. Despite the fact that
women have allegedly been politically equal for over 65 years, the
creaking structures of British democracy -- in particular party
selection and parliamentary procedures -- just haven't caught up.
How many women MPs are as ordinary and have such ordinary political
backgrounds as most men MPs? Why should only the most extraordinary
women, by and large, be selected and elected?
What the convention has done is to devise a system which ought to
translate greater electoral support into greater numbers of MPs. At the
same time there is an opportunity to boost the number of women MPs
because the system can more readily accommodate them.
What Labour and the Liberal Democrats have agreed is that they will
use this opportunity to achieve at the first election as near to a
gender balance in the Scottish parliament as possible. They will do this
not by legislating for equality but merely by fielding more women
candidates.
The voters will then be able to vote Labour and Liberal Democrat
knowing that by doing so they support the policy of a greater number of
women MPs.
If, like John Macleod, they want to vote for a 100% male parliament,
they'll need to vote Tory or SNP -- though it is just possible those
parties may field the odd female candidate.
After the first election, and assuming the policy has been a success,
inertia can take over again, only this time from a more balanced
beginning.

YOUR editorial describes very accurately the complexity of the
Macedonian situation following the assassination attempt on the life of
President Kiro Gligorov (October 9).
I was in Skopje when it happened and was surprised at how calm the
situation was with a minimal police presence on the streets. It was the
view of those with whom I met -- Macedonian church leaders, leaders of
the Albanian minority, and those involved in humanitarian aid programmes
-- that the country would not be destabilised as a result of the
terrorist action.
All groups condemned the act without reservation and all (including
the Albanian leaders I met) expressed optimism for a continuing plural,
democratic, and peaceful Macedonia. Tensions, of course, may well rise
if and when the culprits are identified.
Clearly there are a number of tensions within the country but the
Interim Accord signed with Greece in September appears to provide a way
forward in spite of the opposition to it from Macedonia's emigre
community.
The view was expressed to me that the Albanian minority are not
demanding union with Albania which has fully recognised the borders and
territorial integrity of Macedonia. Indeed, Albanians in Macedonia have
a much higher standard of living and it is seen to be in their interest
to remain within Macedonia.
You are right to suggest that now is the time for the Macedonian
Government to woo the Albanians and peacefully resolve issues concerning
tertiary education in Tetovo and use of the Albanian language in areas
where Albanians form the largest group.
If Macedonia can remain stable and calm following this outrage, and if
the agreement with Greece can be ratified (and issues such as the flag
and name can be resolved), then it can only be good news for the Balkans
as well as for the rest of Europe.

I WISH the Tories would make up their minds on their commitment to
membership of the European Union. When you join a club, you abide by the
rules, until they can be changed or amended by common consent.
No-one really believes that an integrated defence policy would mean
individual nations losing control over their armed forces, as Michael
Portillo would have us believe.
Funny how they don't want any interference from Europe on this issue
but wholeheartedly embrace a ruling from Europe that they should
withhold invalidity benefit from women at the age of 60, instead of 65,
after appealing against a previous ruling. It seems they want to have
their cake and eat it.

CBI SURVEY
THERE is little sign of any increase in consumer confidence so far as
High Street spending is concerned in the September Distributive Trades
Survey from the CBI, writes CHRIS STONE.
Sales in the month failed to recover as much as retailers had expected
and volumes were the same as a year ago, following a fall in August when
the weather was held at least partly to blame, hitting some products.
Volumes remain below average for the time of year and the underlying
three-month trend shows that annual sales are now levelling off.
The CBI takes some comfort from the fact that retailers are predicting
a marked pick-up in October but point out that retailers' expectations
of sales growth have been fully realised in only three of the last 12
months.
Commenting on the survey, Alastair Eperon, chairman of the CBI's
Distributive Trades Survey Panel, said: ''The improvement in retail
sales last month, although welcome after the dip in August, was rather
more modest than retailers had anticipated. Underlying sales seem now to
be flattening out as consumers remain cautious.''
The highest volume of increases compared with a year ago were reported
by booksellers and stationers, sellers of durable household goods,
confectionery, tobacco and newspaper shops and off-licences. The
sharpest year-on-year falls were reported by specialist food retailers
and furniture and carpet stores.
Orders placed with suppliers remained roughly flat for the third
survey in a row, while stock levels continue to be regarded as more than
adequate in relation to expected demand.
Annual sales for motor traders fell more quickly than expected in
September, following a rise in August, leading to business levels once
again becoming well below average for the time of year. Sales are
expected to fall further on a year-on-year basis in October, and at a
faster rate than reported last month.
The official retail sales figures for September are due next
Wednesday. The August decline reported in the CBI Distributive Trades
Survey for August was followed by a 0.8% decline on the official sales
volume index but there has quite often been a divergence between the
two.

MERCHANT CITY
THE last surviving Virginia Tobacco Merchant's house in Glasgow was
officially reopened yesterday after a #500,000 restoration project which
began last October.
The three-storey A-listed building, known as the Tobacco Lord's House,
at 42 Miller Street in the heart of the Merchant City, had lain derelict
for a decade until the Glasgow Building Preservation Trust (GBPT) began
its renovation.
Glasgow District Council leader Pat Lally performed the opening
ceremony yesterday. The building will be used as a West of Scotland
conservation centre and will house the GBPT's headquarters and offer
accommodation to other heritage associations such as the Scottish Civic
Trust.
It will also be available for use by the public as a one-stop resource
providing information about historic buildings, their architects,
restoration grants, and traditional craftsmanship.
Built in 1775, the Georgian villa in Palladian style was owned by the
Glasgow merchant family of Robert Findlay and later occupied by various
businesses including a gas company, jewellers, glass importers, cotton
spinners, and printers.
Mr Findlay's great-great grandson, also called Robert, was among those
who attended yesterday's opening and said he was delighted to see the
house restored to its former glory.
After the building was sold to the GBPT by the Virginia Court
Development Company for #1 in 1992, a funding package which included
#230,000 from Historic Scotland was put together, with additional
support and funding from the European Regional Development Fund, Glasgow
Development Agency, Glasgow City Council, Strathclyde Regional Council,
and several other organisations.
Speaking at the opening yesterday, GBPT chairman Rob Joiner said
Glasgow City Council in particular had been supportive of conservation
projects and reiterated his hope that such support would continue after
local government reform next April.
The building is the first the GBPT has restored since, as the
Bridgegate Trust, it refurbished the Briggait Centre in Glasgow in the
1980s.

A GALLUP survey of UK fund managers commissioned by brokers Smith New
Court shows that for the first time since the survey commenced in 1990,
UK fund managers are net sellers of UK equities. A balance of 3% of
managers are looking to reduce their exposure to UK equities. Only last
May, a balance of 29% were looking to raise their exposure. The
engineering sector is the favourite among UK fund managers with building
and construction the least liked sector.

HAVING started on the beach in July, Robin Morton now finds himself
boldly heading towards a Saturday night on the boat. On The Beach; On
The Boat; at the Arches.
Over lunch, Robin reveals that before the end of the year he expects
Glasgow to unite at the same venue for conceptual evenings On The Piste
and On The Wagon.
I suggest that he considers inviting us all to congregate On The
Throne at the Arches some time. A curious regal gleam lights Robin's
features. Oh aye, Robin Morton is certainly on the ball when it comes to
arranging different types of night out.
On The Beach was a themed evening of music and cabaret featuring Dick
Dale, king of the surf guitar. On The Boat tomorrow night is intended as
a world cruise with world music from Zimbabwe's Bhundu Boys,
Afro-Latinate groovers King Salsa, and globally-influenced jazz-funkers
the Fred Quimby Quartet.
''As we did when we staged On The Beach, we've begged, borrowed and
stolen a heap of effects,'' Robin reveals. ''We've a tape-loop of ships'
hooters and seagulls' cries. We'll have our own company of matelots on
duty, all wearing sailor suits lent by Scottish Opera and the Royal
Navy.
''We've a ship's wheel and bells from Clyde Port Authority; a gang
plank and life-belts from Caledonian MacBrayne; a Caribbean lagoon -- or
at least a pretty good approximation of one -- courtesy of Dobbie's
Garden Centre.''
Lagermeisters Beck's, Inter City, and the Ten Day Weekend are offering
various types of subsidy and sponsorship. There'll be gumbo plus
barbecued tuna and halibut, expertly cooked by a Caribbean chef who
usually prepares less exotic fare for Glasgow Development Agency.
There will be further witty and apposite instances of performance art
from Mischief le Bas, whose series of dramatic interventions at On The
Beach included the showstopping debut of the Elvis Cleaning Company, a
team of pelvis-rotating rock'n'roll charpersons, replete with brooms,
Memphis mumbles, and greasy quiffs.
Even now, a skilled team of set-builders and stage designers is hard
at work crafting the backdrop for On The Boat, which, according to Robin
Morton, ''Will be much more than a concert, much more than a club . . .
an event!''
Almost as much of an event as Robin Morton's own sudden career-change
over the past 12 months. ''Sad, Music-Obsessed Glasgow Lawyer Advances
Early Retirement Plan By 10 Years In Order To Gain Happiness But Lose
Money,'' is Robin's headline for his story.
Robin still works as a licensing lawyer, but he'd become disillusioned
with winding-up grannies' estates and undertaking house-conveyancing
duties full-time at one of Scotland's top commercial law firms. Robin
kept being distracted by the stereo in his office, recalling the
senseless joy of the first single he ever bought, Telstar by the
Tornadoes, and reckoning that if his hero, Neil Young, could retain his
faith in the power of music despite the passage of time, then dash it,
why not him, too?
''It's about belief. If you believe enough, you can push the button at
the right time, in the right way, helped by the right people . . . and
you can make things happen -- you can find yourself at home cooking
dinner one Sunday afternoon when John Peel rings you up.''
That dream phone call from Peelie, a long-time Dale-fan, came during
Robin's initial commercial involvement in music, shortly after he'd set
up his Sound Affects company to promote Dick Dale's gigs in March. Robin
has since had another, from Nils Lofgren's manager, confirming that Nils
will be the star of Sound Affects' next major promotion, at Glasgow's
Plaza on October 29.
On the up and up? That's Robin Morton for you.

<HEADLINE>Shetland council gives #44m incentive to persuade oil companies to stay at terminal. Sullom Voe makes cut price offer</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>GRAEME SMITH</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<TEXT>
AN incentive of #44m from Shetland Islands Council raised hopes
yesterday that the oil industry would continue to use Sullom Voe
terminal well into the next century.
The council revealed just how seriously it had taken the threat by oil
firms to switch to offshore loading when contracts run out in 2000 by
putting a package of proposals forward which amount to a saving of
several million pounds a year.
It believes the package will not only be enough to persuade the
industry to continue using the terminal but will make the facility
competitive enough to win new business from oil fields being developed
to the west and north of Shetland.
Mr Terry Kirchin, Sullom Voe terminal manager and leader of the
negotiating team, said last night he was pleased and encouraged by what
he described as a good offer.
He added that he was confident the 29 companies involved would take
the offer seriously.
The cost savings in the package would start immediately with #4.1m in
cuts this year, backdated to April 1.
The terminal's rental costs will be cut by 50%, saving the operators
around #3.4m. Further cost reductions on rental will be achieved by
tying rental to throughput.
The council has also offered to grant the terminal temporary rates
relief and to take over the liability for rates incurred by the loading
jetties.
None of these measures will cost the council anything because the
revenue goes into central Government funds and the council reclaims its
share.
The council gave an assurance yesterday that services for the 22,500
islanders would not be affected.
From September 1, 2000, when the contracts run out, it will reduce the
charter rates of Shetland towage which will be worth #800,000 a year,
relinquish the return on capital invested in the loading jetties worth
#1.8m, and forgo the disturbance allowance which has so far generated
almost #40m for the islanders.
The fund into which the money has been invested had now grown to
around #180m, taking it to a self-sufficient level and able to meet all
long term commitments.
In return for its offer, the council is asking for a commitment that
all future Brent and Ninian production goes to the terminal; the council
has an involvement in strategic decisions including marketing the
terminal; the terminal plant must be in good condition (an initial
report from experts suggests it is); and the council must be satisfied
the terminal's costs are ''sufficient and not excessive''.
Chief executive, Mr Malcolm Green, said the investment the council was
making was less than the long-term financial benefits to the community.
''It is good for Shetland, good for the oil industry, and good for the
nation,'' said council convener Canon James Smith.
Sullom Voe is Europe's biggest oil and gas export terminal and has
handled 5.5 billion tonnes of oil since 1978.
Its output peaked in the late 1980s, but it still ships out 104,000
tonnes a day, 40% of UK North Sea crude.
The oil industry has estimated that using offshore loading as opposed
to the terminal over the next 15 years would save around #90m. The
council believes the figure to be only #55m and it is that sum which it
has almost met with its package of cuts.
It has said it would go as far as it must ''but no further'' to secure
the future of the terminal. It believes it may now have reached that
point.
Mr Kirchin said last night: ''The most important aspect of the latest
proposal is that it recognises Sullom Voe terminal is a business and
needs to be run on business-like lines.
''Any relationship between industry and the local community needs to
be such that industry can respond effectively to changing business
conditions. What is being put forward reflects this.''
He said that if agreement was reached the business relationship would
be more flexible and durable and the terminal would be in a stronger
economic position.
Each terminal participant would now work out exactly what the
proposals meant to them individually and the negotiating team would be
helping them through the various issues with a view to drawing up an
agreement in principle for signing by the end of the year.

<FLAG>BUSINESS COMMENT</FLAG>
<RECORDNO>975913191</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Stock Exchange has at last come up with new listing rules for
companies to incorporate the views of the Greenbury Committee though why
it should have taken almost three months to do so is anyone's guess.
A consultative document was issued at the end of July and 170 replies
were apparently received but the new rules that have emerged hardly
warrant such worthy attention, being perfectly straightforward.
Companies, or rather their remuneration committees, will have to give
full details of the pay of each director in their annual reports. Firms
will have to make a statement of compliance with the best practice
provisions relating to directors' remuneration and will have to state
that full consideration has been given to best practice concerning
directors' pay, service contracts, and compensation.
It was originally proposed the new rules should come into effect by
the end of this month but the Exchange appears to have bowed to pressure
to give companies a further two months so that they have more time to
familiarise themselves with the rules.
Two weeks should surely have been ample time and one can only conclude
companies are trying to delay the inevitable as long as possible. Now
the rules will only apply to accounting years beginning after December
31, so that the annual reports containing the information will not
appear until well into 1997. One would think that all major companies
would have already implemented the Greenbury recommendations in full but
this is not the case.
If the simple parts of Greenbury have taken so long to incorporate
into listing rules it was inevitable that the Exchange would need even
more time to deal with the more complicated issue of long-term
incentives scheme for directors, including options and pension
arrangements.
A consultative document will be issued by the end of the month on
this, for implementation in the first quarter of 1996.
No boom
THE September inflation figures may indeed not be as bad as they seem
as the Chancellor has indicated but they are hardly encouraging,
although consumer resistance to spending may yet force prices down. They
follow on from the UK producer prices data for September, which also
revealed price pressures though indications are that most companies are
still unable to pass on costs of their raw materials to customers.
Mr Clarke, though, could find himself in the horns of a dilemma. He
will be analysing data evidence in the run-up to the Budget. On the one
hand, it is clear that economic growth is slowing, though the
expectation remains that it is taking place at a more sustainable level.
Indeed, the economy might just pause before it takes off again, albeit
at a more stately rate, next year.
On the other hand, there are signals that inflationary pressures are
still there, even if just below the surface. At the same time, the
latest survey from the Confederation of British Industry shows that
consumer spending remains fragile.
There is no sign of any consumer boom round the corner, the feel good
factors is not here yet. Moreover, recent trade figures have shown that
the pace of export growth is also slowing and it is exports, not the
consumer, that has fuelled this latest economic recovery.
So does the Chancellor listen to those who believe that the slowdown
is far from just a pause and that there is a serious danger of it
stalling completely, or does he heed the camp, led by the Bank of
England, that price pressures are such that they need to be stamped on
soon by a tightening of the monetary system?
The time for decision is not yet and next month's third quarter GDP
will be awaited with keen interest as will the other economic data
including the official retail sales for September, out next week. But
sooner or later, not least perhaps because of City speculation, a
decision will have to be made, even if it is to leave well alone.
Nice niche
DESPITE continuing tales of woe from the retail sector there are still
companies who are able to make good money. N Brown, the Manchester-based
mail order group, is one of them. It has carved a profitable niche for
itself by focusing its catalogues on more mature women.
Demographic trends suggest that such women will account for a larger
proportion of the general population in the future. However, they have
tended to be ignored by many retail groups anxious to focus on younger,
thinner, customers.
N Brown has built up customer loyalty with a resulting increase in
sales to existing customers, while adding newer younger customers at the
same time. These new shoppers will provide the customer base for the
future. The company's excellent interim results show that consumers are
willing to part with their cash when the right proposition is on offer.
Domestic economic recovery has not fed through to a consumer spending
boom.
It appears that having caught the value bug during the recession
years, consumers are unwilling to shake it off. Therefore, investment in
product and customer service, as N Brown has done, is more vital than
ever if retailers are to keep their offer fresh and attractive to
value-conscious shoppers in the 1990s.

Women's magazines, we're told, are much too smutty -- but do those
crying foul have lilywhite professional records themselves? Sara
Villiers wonders whether things have really come to a pretty pass
Today's magazines make the most of sex-related issues because that's
what walks off the shelves
MY, HOW the media apparatchicks have been getting their Janet Regers
in a twist this week. First, we were treated to a bewildering mix of
models and morality, a combination as credible as Major and charisma,
courtesy of ex-cover queen Laraine Ashton, managing director of IGM, one
of London's top modelling agencies. Ashton hit the headlines when she
railed against the raunchy nature of fashion spreads in women's glossy
magazines, sniffing, in an interview with London's Evening Standard,
that they contained too much ''filth''.
With echoes of Miss Jean Brodie, Ashton prissily declared that she
would be advising her ''girls'', who include the in-demand English
models Lisa Butcher and Tyra Baker, and the not-so-girlish Lauren
Hutton, to turn down magazine assignments which they feel are too
explicit. It was a statement which had the ring of an empty threat about
it -- in the same breath Ashton admitted that such work was her models'
''bread and butter'', but it certainly had the desired effect of
guaranteeing Ashton and IGM much sought-after column inches.
Next, Joyce Hopkirk, one of the co-authors of the media bonkbuster
Splash and the launch editor of Cosmopolitan in 1972, muscled in on the
morality act, lamenting in a full-page feature in yesterday's Daily Mail
about the glossies' preoccupation with all things coital. ''I deplore
this obsession with sex,'' she announced, going on to echo Ashton's
outraged declaration that many women's magazines now belong on the top
shelf.
Her copy dripping self-righteous disgust Hopkirk scathingly listed
cover lines from contemporary magazines, such as Cosmopolitan's younger
sister Company's promise, ''Want hotter, happier sex? Six great ways to
guarantee YOU a better time in bed.''
This from a woman who launched Cosmopolitan with a nude male
centrefold and cover line, ''How to turn a man on when he's having
problems in bed''. At least Company are more concerned with enhancing
female pleasure in the boudoir.
Hopkirk's most scathing attack was reserved for the bubby biweekly
More! a magazine aimed at sussed under-20s. Summing up this issue's
cover lines, which include ''Gotcha! How to tame a randy romeo'', ''Does
a big pay packet make him sexy?'' and ''Ultimate sex test! How will YOUR
lover score?'', she gravely concluded that this was not the sort of
magazine one would want one's daughter to read.
But the daughters of Hopkirk and Ashton's generation clearly have
other ideas. Today's magazines make the most of sex-related issues
because that's what walks off the shelves. And the cover lines are not
only symptomatic of the readers' zeal for sex, sex and more sex, but
also the editors' understanding of their readership's increasing
sophisticated sexual awareness, and their appreciationg of irony.
Back in the seventies Cosmopolitan may have been ground-breaking in
airing what went on between the sheets but nineties magazines not only
reflect contemporary candour about sexuality but also gently satirise
it: More!'s ''The size of his packet'' is a spoof on the size of his pay
packet, written by a bloke, the skint Damon Syson, who complains that
size definitely matters to women when it comes to the wallet department.
More!'s readership, used to cover lines like ''Show us your hosepipe'',
which relates to a soft-centred feature on a fireman's charity calendar,
will get the joke.
But the humour is clearly lost on Hopkirk and Ashton, self-appointed
Mary Whitehouse guardians of the glossies. It's difficult to take their
proclamations seriously, so overwhelmingly do they reek of hypocrisy.
Ashton was a top model in the sixties, a decade which has been trumpeted
as one of women's liberation but which in fact subjugated women as
sexual subjects more than any other, and Hopkirk was not only a
''pioneer of the feminist revolution in women's magazines'', as the
Daily Mail describes her, but also a pioneer in capitalising on women's
hunger for sexual knowledge -- perpetrating exactly what she is accusing
those in the editorial hot seats today of doing.
It was a hunger which was often exploited in the most ruthless
fashion. Cosmopolitan's infamous obsession with the multiple orgasm and
the G-spot may have broken taboos but it also triggered feelings of
inadequacy amongst many women. Today's magazines might explore ever more
inventive sexual games but they are also careful to constantly reassure
their readers through gentle self-deprecation. They are as likely to
document sexual failures as tales of triumph. And More!'s
tongue-in-cheek description of the turn-off potential of a popper is
infinitely more humorous and appealing than the straight-faced cover
line of Cosmopolitan's fifth issue in 1972, ''How to find and keep a
rich man''.
Sociologist Angela McRobbie of Loughborough University concurs with
this view. After completing many rigorous academic studies of various
women's magazines, she admires the irony evinced in the publications.
''There have been such dramatic social changes in the past 20 years that
there is simply no point in saying that magazines today are less moral
than those of the seventies,'' she says. ''It's simply irresponsible and
is not a useful way of looking at changes in sexuality. Contemporary
magazines exhibit a parody, detachment, and humour that suggest that the
editors are very aware of how sophisticated their readers are. There are
certainly far more pernicious and damaging images of women in mainstream
culture, such as the tabloid coverage of sexual issues, which is often
influenced by a great deal of voyeurism.''
Cosmopolitan has maintained a dignified silence in the face of the
accusations from Ashton and Hopkirk, issuing a curt, ''We are not making
any comment on it at all'', to all media enquiries, although off the
record their attitude is that they are simply not prepared to play ball
with Ashton and Hopkirk's wearisome attempts at snatching media
coverage.
A more recent former editor of Cosmo, the vivacious Marcelle D'Argy
Smith, has gone on the record as impishly hinting that Ashton is fed-up
with the obsession with sex because it's no longer a significant part of
her personal life. Are Ashton and Hopkirk piqued because they have been
pipped? Who knows?
More!'s strap line is ''Smart girls get more!'' (this is a mag much
taken with the exclamation mark), a play on Cosmopolitan's long-running
slogan, ''Smart girls carry Cosmo'', which was in itself a play on the
Aids education message ''Smart girls carry condoms''. Perhaps Hopkirk
and Ashton aren't getting enough. Of attention, that is.

A SIGNALMAN who turned up for work having drunk nearly three times the
safe level of alcohol, then waved an early morning commuter train past
his box because he forgot how to use the equipment, was fined #1000
yesterday.
Elgin Sheriff Court heard yesterday how Robert Kirkwood, 42, had run
from his home after being ''woken in panic'' by Railtrack Control in
Glasgow at 5.30am -- 25 minutes after he was due to report for duty.
Kirkwood had earlier admitted being under the influence of alcohol
when in charge of his signal box at Elgin on the main Aberdeen to
Inverness line on January 14 of this year, in contravention of the
Transport and Works Act 1992.
Kirkwood, of Springfield Road, Elgin, told police: ''C'mon, I was at a
party at one o'clock.''
Fiscal James MacKay said officers who had been asked to go to
Kirkwood's home found ''his eyes glazed and his speech slurred''.
Mr MacKay had earlier told the court how the first train of the day to
Aberdeen had been held up at Forres waiting on Kirkwood to give the all
clear for it to pass through Elgin.
''There is a system for signalmen to advise each other when they come
on duty and trains cannot pass until each box has been opened. It is a
failsafe method,'' he explained.
But once Kirkwood had adopted the proper procedure, he ran into
trouble again.
At Elgin, he was unable to lift the lever which changed the old style
signal from ''Stop'' to ''Go''.
Believing it was a technical fault and having cleared the line
eastwards to Keith, he walked down to the trackside with a red light and
explained to the driver it was safe to proceed.
Mr MacKay continued: ''A supervisor at Railtrack Control in Glasgow
then contacted Kirkwood to find out what the problem was and Kirkwood
stated: 'I have made a mistake. I might as well walk off the job. I am
unwell.'''
Kirkwood's agent, Mr David Gibb, said: ''The lever fault had been
through the failure of an adjuster but this is fairly elementary for
signalmen. It happened against a background of panic and embarrassment
that he forgot to check the adjuster.
''As soon as he received the telephone call, he threw on his clothes
and ran to the box.''
Kirkwood claimed he could not believe the level of alcohol could have
been so high.
Sentencing Kirkwood, Sheriff Noel McPartlin told him: ''It is
difficult to accept you had no consciousness of the level of alcohol and
in any case it is always better to err on the side of caution.
''The fact is you did attend for work with a very high level of
alcohol and the potential for danger was there. Any kind of accident on
the railway can be very serious indeed. It is tragic you should be
appearing before the court on such a charge.''

SOMETIMES you can get too much of a bad thing. Next week would appear

as ever. The slightly more acceptable John Stapleton is over on ITV with
The Time . . . The Place. Then there's the gruesome twosome, Oprah
Winfrey and Rikki Lake, alternating on C4, and the teeth, Esther
Rantzen, on BBC2. The things you see when you don't have a flame
thrower.
Still, you can't blame the networks. It is cheap television designed
to fill a hole. Like the celebrity talk show before it, the audience
discussion programme is fast becoming a tired old formula.
Nevertheless, there is always the exception which proves the rule.
Which is why we should welcome the return next week of Scottish
Television's Scottish Women. For here is a show which, despite the
familiarity of its format, is actually rather good. Appealing rather
than appalling.
Fresh from her success with Scottish Men, Kaye Adams (one of STV's
better presenters) is back on familiar ground with an audience of
forthright women talking the hind legs off the donkeys. In the opening
show it's divorce. Or rather the pain of divorce. You always hurt the
one you (no longer) love. That's the way the cookie crumbles,
broken-marriage wise.
There's a woman, flying over from America, who runs a service for
divorcees which encourages them to bash their wedding rings with a
hammer and turn them into items of jewellery. Could be worse, I suppose.
It could be their ex-husband's head.
Being so cheery keeps them going, these Scottish Women folk. The
following week it's death. A light-hearted look at death, apparently.
Maybe we'll all die laughing.
Scottish Women has a new producer for this, its fifth series. And,
curiously for a woman in television, her name is not Kirsty. It is,
however, Louise. And Louise used to be an equally popular name for TV
women. When Louise Tait worked at BBC Scotland she was one of a trio of
journalists with the same Christian name.
This, she explains, was fortuitous during editorial brain-storming
sessions. If there was a particularly nasty assignment which the editor
earmarked for ''Louise'' then there would be this curious Mexican
stand-off as all three kept their heads down in the hope that their
namesake would bottle out first.
Now Ms Tait is the only Louise in her team. The trick is, of course,
to keep breathing new life into Scottish Women. The danger is that, when
discussion programmes have been going for a long time, a sense of deja
vu takes hold as they return to the same old subjects.
''That was one of the problems,'' explains Ms Tait. ''When I started I
had lots of ideas for topics and then Kaye gave me a list of what they'd
done in previous series and, of course, all my ideas were on it.''
Still, the new series promises to hold the attention of its audience
(40% of which are men, by the way). One programme, about religion, will
involve filling the entire studio with nuns. First, you have to find
your nuns. Or even ex-nuns who have kicked the habit, so to speak.
Another programme will discuss the question of whether or not a woman
can fake an orgasm. This has nothing to do with nuns. Well, it wouldn't,
would it? However, it has a great deal to do with setting up a short
film (like When Harry Met Sally) of a young lady kidding on -- very
loudly -- that she's having an ecstatically great time in a very public
place. This may have been easy enough to accomplish in Hollywood but is
somewhat problematic in a cafe in Glasgow.
It is Ms Tait's job to find that cafe -- and, indeed, to find a young
lady prepared to fake an orgasm. It's a woman's life in Scottish
Television. Now, for really cutting edge television, the secret would be
to find a nun prepared to fake an orgasm. And, for the next series of
Scottish Men, perhaps a bloke?
* Scottish Women starts its new series on Monday.

As Prada flaunts its new range of unfortunate blasts from the past on
the catwalk, John Davidson praises Versace and Armani for showing flair
while maintaining class
THERE is a great joke circulating Milan this week. This is how it
goes. How many fashion editors does it take to change a lightbulb?
Fashion editors can't change lightbulbs, silly; Prada doesn't sell them.
Prada has not only become the fashion insiders' uniform, its influence
stretches way down into mainstream fashion. But having inspired legions
of high street copycats, with its oh-so-familiar handwriting of elegant
knee-length dresses, narrow belts and lady-like handbags, it was time
for Prada to move on. Only where? Prada has now rehabilitated the most
unlovable aspects of seventies style: air-hostess A-line skirts with an
inverted front pleat, uniform dresses straight from an American diner,
and wicked seventies colours like bile green, murky brown or mustard.
Even polyester jersey has resurfaced . . . along with prints which
Oxfam is still struggling to offload from the first time around.
It was all so awful that it had a certain weird charm -- the lure,
perhaps, of pure kitsch. What entertainment it will be to see mindless
fashion victims discarding their refined black dresses and dainty shoes
for this neo-naff look.
At Gianni Versace, by way of contrast, the future is looking brighter.
In fact it is fluorescent orange, yellow, green -- formed in skin-tight
tailoring and sexy dresses. Prints resemble squiggles of Dayglo
highlighter pen made by a bored secretary. But there was nothing boring
about the show. A very up soundtrack proclaimed a welcome to ''The
Versace Experience'', naming all the nubile runway stars . . . Linda,
Naomi, Helena, Kristen. Remember that Versace is a fully paid-up member
of the supermodel cult; his clothes demand those Amazonian bodies.
When gorgeous Helena Christiansen reached the end of the runway in a
floor-length luminous green gown, a tell-tale flick of her hair
confirmed that she too knew that this curve-accenting creation had
transformed her from mere babe to total sex goddess.
If, like Melanie Griffith's character in Working Girl, you too have
''a body for sin'', Versace is just the designer to expose it. And
talking of bodies which he has exposed, Elizabeth Hurley sat in the
front row with hapless Hugh in tow. Her short sparkly pink Versace frock
and spike-heeled white boots seemed very happy hooker -- such an
unfortunate choice in her circumstances.
Talking of unfortunate choices, there is a rumour in Milan that La
Perla Noir (as Naomi Campbell is known here) is reconsidering betrothal
to Mike Tyson. Versace would surely do the dress.
''Every woman is different,'' proclaims Giorgio Armani, by way of
explaining the breadth of choice across his main collection and younger,
more sporty Emporio line. An Armani jacket can be long or short, fitted,
or as easy as a cardigan. Just choose his cut according to your width.
Then put it with a skirt, trousers, perhaps even a dress. Whatever you
please, as long as it's Armani.
There is a basic aesthetic in Armani's softly-coloured clothes which
you either embrace or reject at the outset. Thereafter, they really
don't impose. They don't have the look-at-me insistence of Versace, or
the offbeat fashion force of Prada. In fact they are fairly normal. And
unlike designers whom you now know will leave you one season on with
something in your wardrobe that's far too foolish to wear, that Armani
jacket will last for ever.

<HEADLINE>Oryx cuts 120 jobs offshore</HEADLINE>

OIL AND GAS
AROUND 120 offshore jobs will be lost due to restructuring at Oryx UK
Energy, the oil company which took over Conoco's Murchison, Hutton and
Lyell fields at the beginning of the year.
Oryx plans to improve the fields' performance by carrying out
significant changes, including retraining for multi-skilled teams,
leading to a 40% cut in core crews on each installation.
The average core crew on the Murchison and Hutton platforms -- Lyell
is an unmanned satellite -- is 77 at a time and that will be reduced by
about 30. There are two crews for each platform.
A company spokeswoman stressed: ''Safety will not be jeopardised and
Oryx believes that the restructuring will not only enhance teamwork, but
also promote the continuous improvement in safety performance which has
been evident throughout the year.
''A few positions in the new organisation will be filled by Oryx staff
and all other Oryx employment contracts will cease,'' she added.
Atlantic Power and Gas (APG), the contractor with which Oryx has
formed an alliance and which runs its day-to-day offshore operations,
will recruit for the new organisation.
Oryx was little known until it was revealed last year that it was to
take over some Conoco interests and receive #26m in exchange for its
small share in the giant Britannia gas field.
Oryx UK Energy -- which has an African antelope on its corporate logo
-- is based in a converted warehouse in Aberdeen's dock area.
Oryx Energy is one of the largest independent oil and gas companies in
the world with its headquarters in Dallas and around 1200 employees.
Its history in the North Sea goes back to the early 1960s when it was
a wholly owned subsidiary of Sun Company and managed all of its
world-wide exploration and production assets.
It became independent in 1988 and re-entered the UK in 1990 with the
#600m acquisition of some BP assets opening an office in Uxbridge.
Its announcement of the Conoco deal came after months of secret
negotiations at an Aberdeen conference centre.
Oryx had been a partner in the Hutton and Murchison Fields with Conoco
but had disagreed about their future prospects.
The deal is thought to have been mutually agreed. Oryx is said to be
enjoying profits from the fields which Conoco did not think it would be
able to profitably develop beyond 1996.

You have to look upon every night as a new show, a fresh gig you're
promoting
TEN Day Weekend: year-round late-night entertainment. A new venue for
the staging of the latter this week kicks off when Archaos opens its
doors in Glasgow's Queen Street. Designed by Keith Hobbs, the man
responsible for the rebirth of style guru Terence Conran's London
restaurant, Quaglino's, Archaos is the latest clubbing venture from
established Scottish entrepreneur du nuit Mark Goldinger, present
co-owner of Glasgow's Bar Miro.
In addition to Archaos's range of bars, the club sports a 40-seater
restaurant offering what Goldinger describes as ''quality fast-food:
Thai fish-cakes, pitta bread, fresh pastas . . . definitely no
chicken-in-a-basket.''
Archaos's main attraction, however, is bound to be its circular domed
music room, the inspiration for which came from the video for Lenny
Kravitz's Are You Going To Go My Way, with its evocation of a vast
amphitheatre. In addition to the dancefloor and DJ booth you'll find in
every club, Archaos has a stage for live music events, planned to run
regularly in midweek, starting with Ten Day Weekend gigs by Raw Stylus
and Credit To The Nation next Wednesday and Thursday respectively.
Disc-spinner Derek Wallace will be the usual occupant of the Archaos
DJ booth, with Portishead's Andy Smith premiering next Wednesday.
When it comes to stating Archaos's credo, Goldinger is at pains to
stress that he is no personality clubland host. ''I prefer to write the
script rather than be the leading man in the movie,'' he says,
simultaneously crediting his co-partner, Stefan Karl, as the man with
the idea for Archaos's spatial roundness. Nevertheless, Archaos has been
shaped by Goldinger's vision and experiences as a musician first and
clubber second.
For one thing, Goldinger will be running a record label, Roundhouse,
in conjunction with the club, its DJs, and the bands who appear there.
''Synergy's the word. And I want the label to be eclectic. The first
single, by Melonhaus, is housey/trancey/dancey, but no matter the style,
if good bands or individual tracks come along, we'll release them,
hopefully at the rate of one single a month.''
He started as a player himself, you see. At the age of 10, as a
saxophonist. But while attending music college in Leeds in his teens, he
was happily derailed by nightclubbing. ''I was soon working as a barman
four nights a week, and my academic career went down the toilet.
''Youthful naivete led me in . . . clubs had a buzz, an energy that
was irresistible. This was the life for me. At first my parents saw it
as a precarious job because youth culture didn't exist then . . . it
didn't have the resonance as an industry that it does now.
''But music was always my main motivation: black music, jazz, soul. I
continued playing till 25 or 26 but then stopped taking myself seriously
as a musician. Since adolescence I'd thought I could be Sonny Rollins or
John Coltrane, but then I realised that being a not-bad semi-pro was the
limit of my talent.''
Better to be a pretty-good, fully-professional club overseer.
Goldinger started Henry Afrika's in Glasgow with another nightlife
figure, Ron McCulloch, in 1984. Clubs and bars have come and gone ever
since. Nico's in Glasgow; Fat Sam's, Dundee; a club in Puerto Banus,
Spain.
Ditto bands, Goldinger having managed such long-gone Glasgow
contenders as Sugar Sugar, Wyoming, and Five Guys Named Mo. The
Nightcrawlers were his most recent charges. He likes music, always has,
always will.
''I remember booking Bronski Beat into Henry Afrika's for #45 and
Simply Red for #75 when no-one had heard of them. My best night there
ever was Curtis Mayfield . . . my hero!
''You'd get all the crap bands that couldn't play taking eight hours
to do a soundcheck. Curtis Mayfield comes in with an 11-piece band, you
ask him how long he needs for his soundcheck, and he says 'Oh, no, we
don't bother with those'. He just went on and gradually built his set up
from a semi-acoustic start. A complete pro.''
No matter how professional you are, isn't it inevitable that any
club's natural lifespan is a short one. They all simply go out of
fashion?
''No. As long as the people running clubs remain interested, excited,
and focused constantly, they don't go off. But you have to look upon
every night as a new show, a fresh gig you're promoting. You lose it
once there's the feeling 'Oh, Friday again, I suppose we better open the
doors'.''
You can choose your club's music; how do you choose your clientele?
''You want an interesting mix, not a one-dimensional audience. Some
folk are happy with a club with four black walls and a sound system. Not
me. Clubbing has become boring lately. I did nationwide market-research,
visiting all sorts of clubs. London? There's nothing there right now.
''We'll have the top DJs like Jeremy Healy and Graeme Park here
eventually, but in general I'm not into building a club around big-name
DJ events. As a musician, I've always wanted to do something different
as opposed to just running a discotheque.
''In Glasgow, you can look at the Arches as one club that's been
trying to offer more; to provide entertainment; entertainment plus a bit
of a dance and a drink.
''And something to eat. Your fascist clubbers don't like the notion of
being able to eat something in a club. But Archaos isn't shirts-off,
hands-in-the-air and all that that entails.''
Fully dressed-up entertainment will be on offer on Sundays when
Archaos mutates into Shirley's Temple, a camp idyll with the mysterious
Ms Alston at the controls. Hip-house bagpiper Martyn Bennett is among
this Sunday's opening attractions during the Ten Day Weekend.
Along with the soon-to-be-infamous Archaos circus-style trapeze and
bizarre wall-mounted performance hatches. All part of a musical,
fully-rounded, and highly interesting night out at Archaos, you might
say.

<HEADLINE>Expert predicts short life for single-tiers. New councils 'are doomed'</HEADLINE>

THE Tories' new system of 29 single-tier councils in Scotland is
doomed, according to a leading local government expert, Professor Arthur
Midwinter.
In his new book, Local Government in Scotland, Reform or Decline?,
published today, the professor says a period of turbulence in inevitable
and then a further reorganisation. He believes it will take place either
because the smaller councils prove not to be viable or as part of a
devolution package if Labour comes to power.
Professor Midwinter also warned yesterday: ''I believe that, if
devolution does go ahead, a Scottish parliament will find it very
difficult not to take over the major services of education, police, and
perhaps water which is now under three new quangos.''
Even if a parliament was not established, these issues would still
have to be addressed by a Labour government and he could not see the
large number of small authorities surviving.
Conservative Ministers claimed the new unitary authorities would prove
more local, more efficient, and more accountable but Professor Midwinter
argued that what was actually on offer was a more complex, fragmented
pattern of service provision which might add to cost and blur
accountability.
The case for reform is not a good one, he claims. No clear benefits
are on offer and the prospect of higher costs and lower services remains
a possibility. The Budget is approaching and Professor Midwinter says
the Government faces ''tricky financial problems'' over financing the
councils.
''If they set capping levels too tightly, services will be squeezed
and reorganisation will be blamed. If they set grant levels too tightly,
local taxes will rise and reorganisation will be blamed. This will
discredit the system in its infancy,'' he writes.
Meanwhile, the new Inverclyde Council, which was recently attacked by
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth for taking on too many highly paid
officials, has challenged him to see for himself how the council plans
to provide efficient public services.
The Labour council leader, Mr Harry Mulholland, said that comments
made by Mr Forsyth were ''inaccurate and certainly unhelpful at a time
of great uncertainty for local government employees throughout
Scotland''.
In a wide-ranging attack on the behaviour of Labour councils delivered
at the Tory Conference in Blackpool, Mr Forsyth accused Inverclyde as a
small authority of taking on 20 senior officials -- one for each
councillor -- at a wage bill of nearly #1m.
Councillor Mulholland, in a letter to Mr Forsyth, said he was
astonished that neither the Scottish Secretary nor his officials had
bothered to contact the council before making ''such damaging and
inaccurate public comments''.
He said the combined salary bill of approximately #996,000 for the
officials was less than 1% of the total salary bill for the new council.
The existing district council, which provided around one third of the
services which the new council would provide, had management salary
costs of #822,000.

ETAM, the downmarket women's fashion chain, is having a tough time. It
plunged into a loss in the first half of the year, cut its dividend and
warned about the prospects for the full year.
Following the poor results three senior directors have left the
company. Rodney East, executive vice-chairman, finance director Keith
Miles and buying director John Maynard have all resigned with immediate
effect. Under their contracts, Mr East and Mr Maynard will receive two
years compensation and Mr Miles one year.
In the 28 weeks to 12 August the group made a loss of just under #4m
on 6% lower sales. The company blamed uncompetitive pricing relative to
companies like Marks &amp; Spencer and Next for the poor sales.
At the operating level, a loss of #660,000 was incurred before
non-recurring reorganisation costs. These costs were #2.98m, which
together with the loss on disposal of fixed assets and net interest
payable resulted in the #3.8m loss.
Despite the trading problems, the balance sheet is strong with gearing
of just 6% and business development continued. Capital expenditure
during the period was #7.7m up from #4.8m previously. The group trades
from 227 sites.
Wholesale changes are being made within the company in terms of both
personnel and operations.
Board changes were made in the spring following the resignation of
former Defence Minister John Nott as chairman. Stanley Lewis, who with
Oceana Investment failed in a hostile bid for Etam in 1991, became
chairman in March.
Nick Hollingworth, previously head of the Evans division of Burton,
started as managing director at the end of April. Further key
appointments are to be made in due course to strengthen the management
team.
A review of the group's merchandising, marketing and information
systems is under way. The buying and planning departments have been
restructured and a design department has been introduced to provide
clearer merchandise focus. However, Mr Lewis said the necessary changes
would ''take time both to implement and to take effect''. He added:
''There is no quick fix solution''.

<HEADLINE>Wholesale prices rose 3% in September</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>27</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975913200</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
Washington, Thursday -- Wholesale prices rose 0.3% last month, led by
food prices, the Labour Department said today.
The rise, the largest since January, in the Producer Price Index for
finished goods had been expected by Wall Street economists. It followed
a seasonally adjusted 0.1% drop in August and left the index 1.8% above
its level of 12 months ago.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components of the index, the
so-called core rate of wholesale inflation rose 0.2% last month after
rising 0.1% in August, the department said.
In a separate report, the department said the number of workers
applying for unemployment benefits for the first time rose slightly to a
seasonally adjusted 348,000 in the first week of October from 342,000 in
the last week of September.
But the more stable four-week moving average of first-time jobless
claims declined in the same period, to 347,750 from 351,750, the
department said.
The reports follow recent indications the economy is slowly regaining
some of its momentum after growing at a meagre 1.3% rate in the second
quarter, its weakest quarterly performance in more than two years.
The department is due to release its Consumer Price Index for
September -- the most widely used measure of inflation -- this week.
Leading last month's increase in the Producer Price Index, which
gauges the prices charged by producers of finished goods, was a 1% jump
in food prices, which had been unchanged in August.
Prices of fresh and dry vegetables surged 38.6 percent in September
after falling 12.7% in August.
Egg prices jumped 10.2% after a 0.9% gain, and prices of shortening,
cooking oils and pasta products climbed last month after declining in
August, while increases accelerated in prices of turkeys, pork, rice and
processed fruits and vegetables.
Prices of finished energy goods, including gasoline, home heating oil
and natural gas, fell 0.5% last month after a steeper 0.9% decline in
August.
Gasoline prices fell 2% in September, while home heating oil prices
rose 0.9% and residential electric power costs slipped 0.4%.
Passenger car prices rose 0.5% in September after a 0.2% gain in
August.
Prices also accelerated for newspapers, prescription drugs, girls'
apparel, furniture and floor coverings, the department said.

CHANGES in law and order strategy outlined by Scottish Secretary
Michael Forsyth have been put under close scrutiny by politicians and
prison officer representatives, who claim that there are serious flaws
in his new get-tough policies.
Mr Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat spokesman on Home and Legal
Affairs, said last night that Mr Forsyth's move to give minimal
remission for good behaviour was ''hardly likely to help maintain peace
in the prisons,'' adding that his proposals had been determined by
''base emotion''.
He said: ''His proposals may be superficially attractive to unthinking
Tory conference representatives, but they ignore the sophisticiation of
the Scottish judicial system. If a judge knows that the sentence he
imposes will be served in its entirety, he will undoubtedly alter the
sentence accordingly.''
Members of the Prison Officers' Association said the move for tougher
sentencing would lead to a bigger prison population, and would
strengthen the need for a new prison to be built in Scotland to cope.
The criminal justice charity, Sacro, said it had grave reservations
about the changes and would be making representations to Mr Forsyth.
Mr Jim Dawson, deputy general secretary of the Prison Officers'
Association, said ending the automatic chance of remission for inmates
would inevitably lead to an escalation in the prison population and lead
to frustration among prisoners.
At present, there are 5700 prisoners in 21 Scottish jails, looked
after by 4000 prison officers. Before Mr Forsyth's decision to toughen
up sentencing, it was estimated that, by the year 2000, there would be
around 6000 people in Scottish jails.
Mr Dawson said: ''If the prison numbers go up then the issue is far
greater than looking for more staff and money. It is clear, with the
estimated rise in prison population and Mr Forsyth's comments, a new
prison will be needed.
''However, we have a difference of opinion with Mr Forsyth and Mr
Eddie Frizell of the Scottish Prison Service, who seem to think any new
prison should be privately financed.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson challenged Mr Forsyth to
tell the people of Scotland how much his new policy would cost them.
Mr Robertson said: ''Tougher sentencing and tighter rules on remission
will mean more people in prison. How much will all this cost the
taxpayer?''
Ms Fiona Hyslop, for the Scottish National Party, accused Mr Forsyth
of failing to address head-on the problems in the prison service.

'Wild West' exchange seeks investment in Scotland.
Vancouver, Thursday -- Some top officials of the Vancouver Stock
Exchange are coming to Scotland next week to try to persuade the
financial community that it has cleaned up its act, even though it
cannot shake off its ''Wild West'' reputation here in British Columbia.
Ross Sherwood, who has just completed a two-year stint as chairman of
the VSE, will head a delegation including the exchange's major
stockbrokers and three companies considered to exemplify the changing
face of the market.
The VSE is well aware of its bad reputation but claims it is
undeserved in light of major changes during the last eight years in the
way it is run and regulated.
It will put its case to the Scottish financial community at
presentations in Edinburgh and Glasgow on Monday.
The visit to Scotland, far and away the VSE's most high-powered
attempt to attract the funds of the major institutional investors and
''high net worth individuals'', is part of a wider European tour.
Both the VSE itself and its major brokers also see an opportunity for
Scottish companies, such as technological pioneers, to raise venture
capital through a listing on the Vancouver exchange.
The only prominent UK company listed in Vancouver at present is
Tradepoint, a London-based electronic trading systems company, which has
been quoted on the Canadian exchange since 1993.
Several US companies are also listed in Vancouver.
Jock Ross, vice-president of broker McDermid St Lawrence Chisholm in
Vancouver, sees the VSE as an attractive alternative to AIM, the London
Stock Exchange's recently-launched market for smaller and growing
companies.
He envisages a two-way flow of funds between Scotland and Canada.
Mr Ross said: ''We have capital we are looking to provide homes for
and we have deals and we are looking for capital for these deals.''
However, even though the VSE's member stockbrokers and the regulator,
the British Columbia Securities Commission, back the VSE's contention
that it has wiped out many of the scams which muddied its reputation in
the first place, this argument cuts no ice with several journalists in
Vancouver.
The exchange, rightly or wrongly, remains the whipping boy of North
America.
Michael Johnson, the VSE's new president, believes the exchange's
reputation in the public's mind has become worse ''almost in an inverse
relation to what has been done in terms of improving things''.
Mr Johnson added: ''We have had a very aggressive local media who have
managed to create what I would like to think is a distorted picture.''
Douglas Hyndman, chairman of the securities commission, said: ''There
have been, in the last eight years, some pretty major changes in the way
the market is regulated and the way it operates.
''What has lagged behind that to some degree is the perception
certainly in the local media and, probably through them in some of the
international media, of what is behind that market.''
However, following the much-publicised collapse of a group of
companies about three years ago, a British Columbia Government-appointed
commission recommended radical restructuring of the commission itself.
The Government ultimately decided that this was not necessary.
There have been some major changes in the VSE since 1987, when the
provincial Government beefed up the regulation of trading with the
formation of the securities commission.
The VSE makes no bones about the abuses of the past.
In 1990, the ''open outcry'' mechanism was done away with and the
trading floor replaced by the ''Vancouver Computerised Trading'' system.
The VSE acknowledges that, in the old days, unscrupulous players could
introduce a stock, run up the price and sell out at a massive profit,
leaving other investors nursing losses. The stock play was often more
important than the company's underlying business.
David Laundy, vice-president of public affairs, said: ''One of the
complaints you used to hear about here a lot was the behaviour on the
trading floor, where people would be manipulating stocks and making
money on the way through. All of that ceased when we had a computerised
trading system.''
VSE's enlarged surveillance department watches transactions for signs
of manipulative or insider trading, with the securities commission
ultimately largely responsible for prosecutions or disciplinary action.
There is also some evidence that the VSE's Pre-listings Advisory
Committee, established three years ago, may be improving the quality of
companies coming on to the exchange.
Stockbrokers in Vancouver, who now have to sponsor a new market
entrant and justify its listing to their peers on the committee, have
been been developing corporate finance operations to ensure they meet
their increased ''due diligence'' responsibilities.
Mr Johnson is up front about the risks inherent in a small or
micro-capitalisation venture capital market.
The VSE is currently home to about 1500 companies with a combined
market capitalisation of only C$7400m (#3511m).
Mr Johnson cites the venture capitalist's ''two-six-two'' expectation,
which states that, out of 10 such companies, two will be very
successful, six will become ''part of the living dead', and two will
die.
Similarly, Mr Sherwood believes potential investors must do their
homework and understand the risk.
He said: ''It is a risk market. You have got to do your due diligence.
If you don't do your due diligence, you deserve what you get.''
No-one would argue that the VSE, by its very nature, is risky. Mining
stocks are still in the majority, although the number of companies in
the technology sector is increasing.
And the VSE, perhaps because of its reputation, remains a magnet for
the unscrupulous.
During the last two years, between 30 and 35 different parties have
been refused access to capital through the VSE after their history was
uncovered by a simple search by the exchange on the Lexis-Nexis
international media databank.

SCOTTISHPOWER yesterday appointed its corporate resources director,
Mike Kinski, as the new head of Manweb.
His appointment as chief executive had been widely expected following
the success of ScottishPower's hostile #1100m takeover bid for the
Chester-based power company.
Mr Kinski, 43, led a team of senior ScottishPower managers which had
been waiting in the wings for several weeks to take over at Manweb.
The company distributes electricity to 1.3 million consumers in
Merseyside and North Wales and Mr Kinski will be charged with
implementing cost-cutting measures to improve its efficiency.
In particular, he is expected to impose sweeping staff cuts, which
could see Manweb's 3000 workforce reduced by half over the next three or
four years.
Manweb's outgoing board, which opposed the ScottishPower bid tooth and
nail, resigned en masse yesterday after four days of talks with
ScottishPower on transition arrangements.
Before leaving, it recommended that Manweb's minority shareholders
accept the inevitable and sell out to ScottishPower.
''Your board believes that it would not be in the interests of
non-accepting shareholders to remain as a minority in Manweb,'' the
departing directors said.
Outgoing chief executive John Roberts and Manweb's five other
executive directors will receive generous severance packages, believed
to be worth about #4m.
In addition to straightforward severance payments, they will receive
pension contributions and profits from cashing in their share options.
A ScottishPower spokesman declined to comment on the terms agreed,
beyond saying they were ''within the contractual legal entitlement.''
ScottishPower, which had gained control of 61% of Manweb by the time
its offer closed on October 6, yesterday declared its offer
unconditional.
The Glasgow-based company will allow those who have so far held onto
their Manweb shares to sell them under terms of its final offer until
October 20.
ScottishPower chief executive Ian Robinson, who becomes the new
chairman of Manweb, said: ''We strongly urge all remaining Manweb
shareholders to accept our increased offer without delay.''
ScottishPower's cash-plus-shares offer for Manweb is currently worth
1009p per share. There is an all-cash alternative of 990p, but this is
currently worth less than the than the open market price.
Manweb shares rose 2p yesterday to 999p, while ScottishPower gained
7[1/2]p to 356p.
ScottishPower has appointed four of its own executive directors to
take over the vacant boardroom at Manweb.
Mr Kinski and Mr Robinson are joined by ScottishPower finance director
Ian Russell and Duncan Whyte, ScottishPower's chief operating officer of
energy business.
''We will be moving in from Monday onwards,'' a ScottishPower
spokesman said.
Mr Kinski joined ScottishPower nearly three years ago after spending
16 years as a personnel manager in the motor industry, where he rose to
become director of personnel at Jaguar.
Before that he studied electronic engineering and gained an MBA in
business studies from Warwick University.
The energetic and pugnacious new head of Manweb therefore has a solid
background for implementing the painful staff cuts which are expected.
His axe is expected to fall first on Manweb's 700 headquarters staff
in Chester, which could well be whittled down to less than 150.
But Mr Kinski yesterday sought to allay fears that a bloodbath was
imminent.
''The past two months have been a sensitive time for Manweb employees
and we want to handle the transition of ownership as sensitively as
possible,'' he said. ''We need to ensure that service to our customers
continues at a high level while we begin to integrate the activities of
the two companies.''
Mr Kinski said he would undertake a two-month round of consultations
with the staff and trade unions of Manweb, after which ScottishPower
would present its plans for the future of the company.
At ScottishPower, Mr Kinski's responsibilities widened beyond the
human resources area.
He also supervised the electrical retailing division, which runs a
chain of stores throughout the UK, the contracting division, the
techology division and information systems.
''He has done well at ScottishPower and has moved into the fast
track,'' said Andrew Stone, utilities analyst at Daiwa Securities in
London.
One immediate consequence of Manweb's takeover is its disappearance
from the FTSE-250 index of second-line shares. The FTSE Actuaries share
indices committee said it would be replaced by the pharmaceuticals
company Celltech.

INSURANCE
PROVIDENT Mutual Assurance has recommended policy holders accept an
agreed #170m takeover bid by General Accident, warning that to remain
independent it would have to incur additional costs of at least #20m.
The takeover was agreed last month and will be formally put to policy
holders at an egm on November 15.
If approved, it should be completed by the end of the year.
Provident Mutual said it was unable to transact new business
profitably in current market conditions and, with competition in the
industry growing more intense, these were unlikely to improve.
In a letter to policy holders yesterday the board said that closing
the Provident Mutual Fund to new entrants would lead to costs of at
least #20m in the short-term and a long-term increase in unit costs.
Perth-based General Accident will pay #145m for a 10% share of future
profits from the Provident Mutual Fund. It will also pay #25m to finance
special bonuses to eligible with-profits policy holders.
Provident Mutual all its policy holders would benefit from enhanced
security as part of the General Accident group.
It said they would enjoy a 10-year period during which most of the
costs of the Provident Mutual Fund would remain fixed in real terms.
There would also be greater freedom in investment policy, relief from
the substantial costs of writing new business and insulation from
restructuring costs.
Brian Richardson, chief executive of Provident Mutual said: ''The
proposals with General Accident achieve the main advantages of closing
the fund without the disadvantages and offer policy holders more capital
and security.
''I am convinced that the interests of all our policy holders will be
fully protected and the prospects for with-profits and unit-linked
policy holders improved.''
Barrie Holder, deputy chief executive of General Accident, said: ''We
are delighted our proposals have received the full support of the
Provident Mutual Board.
''Our offer will enhance porspects for all Provident Mutual policy
holders and provide them with the added security that comes from being
part of a major international insurance group with extensive financial
resources.''

BRITAIN'S leading bus builder, Walter Alexander of Falkirk, yesterday
landed a bumper #20m order from Stagecoach, the UK's biggest bus
operator.
This brings its new orders to #29m in the last week and the company
said it would take on more staff to deal with the extra workload.
Chairman John Fleming said Alexander will have to recruit another 100
coachbuilders to help complete 660 bodies for Stagecoach in time for
delivery next year.
Alexander landed the lion's share of a 1000-bus order by Stagecoach,
announced at the Bus and Coach Show in Birmingham. The Perth-based
company is ordering new buses for its subsidiaries in Africa, New
Zealand, and Portugal, as well as the UK.
Alexander will build the bodies of 400 minibuses, 100 midibuses, 100
double-deckers and 60 single-deckers. Most of the work will go to its
main plant in Falkirk, but about 100 of the minibuses will be built in
Belfast.
The Stagecoach order continues a link between the two Scots companies
which began after bus deregulation in the mid-1980s.
Since then Stagecoach have ordered more than 2000 bus bodies from
Walter Alexander, worth almost #100m.
To meet the latest demand, Alexander has created two extra production
lines which can handle a mix of product types.
Announcing the order from Stagecoach, Mr Fleming said: ''This is a
tremendous vote of confidence in Alexander and is an excellent example
of a high-quality customer partnership that forms the basis of our
business.''
Bill Cameron, managing director at Falkirk, said: ''This represents a
significant increase in our overall capacity and flexibility to meet the
increasingly varied demand by the market.
''We can now combine a dedicated build approach to major groups like
Stagecoach with an adaptability to balance variety and volume for our
many other customers.''
Stagecoach chairman Brian Souter commented: ''We are delighted to
retain Alexander as the major supplier of bus bodies to our group.
''It has continued to demonstrate its ability to build a quality range
of products in high volumes at a competitive price. It is also able to
meet very high delivery deadlines, which is an extremely important
factor for our operations.''

TEXAS Energy Partners, jointly owned by Hosuton Industries and Central
&amp; South West Corporation, has officially pulled out of the bidding to
acquire Norweb, the regional electricity company (REC) serving north
west England.
The way is now clear for rival bidder North West Water to acquire
Norweb. So far, North West Water has bought 29.4% of Norweb's share
capital on the stockmarket. On Wednesday, the water company made a
higher offer for Norweb, valuing the company at #1830m, which was
recommended by Norweb's board.
Analysts have estimated potential cost savings of up to #100m although
customers are not expected to see the benefits of this before the year
2000. The bid is at a price to earnings ratio of 12.4 times based on
1996 consensus forecasts, a level almost in the middle of recent bids.
Texas Energy Partners is widely expected to turn its attention to
London Electricity, which is one of the five remaining independent RECs.
However, City analysts cautioned that bidders should not lose sight of a
likely Labour Government in 18 months time, with the possibility of a
windfall tax on the utilities.

ENGINEERING
A SWIFT change of gear on the factory floor has taken a Scots-based
diesel engine manufacturer into the fast lane with a string of
improvements in productivity, training and a dramatic reduction in the
number of days lost through sickness.
Over the last four years productivity at the Cummins Engine Company at
Shotts in Lanarkshsire has improved by 27%, faults have dropped by 80%
from five per hundred engines to only one per hundred, and days lost
through sickness averages 2.8%, well below the national average for the
manufacturing industry of 4.5%.
The plant has a workforce of 640 full-time employees and 80
part-timers and produces over 12,000 diesel engines per year for use in
trucks, electricity generators, rail locomotives, construction
equipment, and military vehicles.
One of the changes introduced by the company was a Japanese system of
organising the workforce into small teams to improve working methods and
ensure a better service for customers.
Set up in Shotts in 1956, the company is part of Cummins UK which also
has plants at Darlington and Daventry and has an annual turnover of over
#430m and an annual average profit of around #27m.
Yesterday the Shotts plant was awarded an Investors in People award
for its commitment to employee training and development.
Plant manager Bob Scott said: ''We have been making a lot of
improvements over the last five years in training and involving people.
I am pleased these efforts have now been recognised outside the plant.''

RETAILING
MAIL order group N Brown, whose catalogues include JD Williams,
Oxendales and Ambrose Wilson, is prospering despite the difficult retail
environment.
Its sales rose by 7% in real terms in the first six months of the year
and txable profits grew by 16% to a record 12.6m.
The results were better than the City had been expecting with a
notably good performance from newer catalogues such as Fashion World and
Classic Combination.
Prolonged hot weather in August led to an unexpected demand for summer
clothing but this was more than offset by a slow start to autumn season
sales.
The sales growth was achieved from 3% more customers and higher sales
to existing customers.
Gross margins were maintained at last year's level although selling
prices were competitive. Operating margins improved due to lower
overhead costs.
The balance sheet improved in the period with a cash inflow of #5.2m
compared with a previous outflow of #1.8m. Gearing declined from 35% to
27%.
Current trading is said to be encouraging. Additional marketing
initiatives are to be taken in the run-up to Christmas.
Chairman Sir David Alliance said the company was confident it would
produce a commendable result for the full year.

ECONOMY
THE inflation figures for September were worse than expected, with a
0.5% rise on the month lifting the headline annual rate to 3.9% from
August's 3.6%.
The figures wrongfooting analysts who had been projecting 3.7% but
they made no impression on financial markets. The FTSE-100 Index, which
earlier this week had plummeted around 50 points on Wall Street weakness
and economic uncertainties, surged by 49.5 points to close at 3523.8.
The Footsie was led by futures and a firm start to Wall Street as well
as bid speculation in the banking sector.
Government securities closed unchanged after early weakness.
Suggestions that the RPI data meant that the prospect of a reduction in
interest rates had faded made little impression. Sterling was drifting
but unconcerned with the RPI.
The underlying rate of inflation, which excludes mortgage interest, at
3.1% against August's annual rate of 2.9%, was also above market
forecasts which had centred on 3%.
The increases will add about #700m to #800m to next year's social
security bill as benefits are normally uprated in line with the
September's RPI and this is 0.9% higher than was projected when spending
plans were drawn up last year.
This time the figures are likely to strengthen the arm of the Governor
of the Bank of England Eddie George when he next meets Chancellor
Kenneth Clarke for one of their regular monthly monetary meetings.
Mr George has dropped his call for an immediate increase but according
to the minutes of these meetings he keeps warning the Chancellor of the
dangers of delay. Up to now, though, most of the brownie points look to
have gone to the Chancellor.
Mr Clarke, commenting on the RPI yesterday, said the figures were
still being distorted by the aftermath of a hot summer on food prices
and that the wider picture showed inflation still under control. He
pointed out that increases in the cost of raw materials earlier this
year were always expected to push up retail inflation for a while,
before falling back again next year.
The Central Statistical Office said that seasonal food prices fell
less than last year and non-seasonal food prices rose between August and
September in contrast to sharp falls a year ago. Sales recoveries for
household goods and clothing and footwear were both stronger this
September than last year.
Other upward pressures on the 12-month rate came form personal goods
and services, fuel and light, and leisure services. These upward
pressures were slightly offset by sharper reductions in motoring costs
than last September.
The Chancellor has said he believes the UK is still on course to meet
its inflation target of 2.5% or less by the next election but he also
made clear that he would raise interest rates if necessary.
David Walton, an economist at securities house Goldman Sachs,
considered the inflation figures to be poor enough to quell any real
hope of a base rate cut at the next monthly meeting of the Chancellor
and the Governor. But it seems unlikely, anyway, that the Chancellor
would make a move before bringing down the Budget on November 28.

PICKING on scapegoats, if I may adapt an old adage, is the last refuge
of the politically bankrupt. The original Old Testament goat was
symbolically laden with the sins of the Israelites and despatched into
the wilderness to destruction.
This week in Blackpool it was replaced by a procession of latter-day
scapegoats, ranging from single mothers to a single European army, each
one ritually slaughtered from the platform, in a cynical exercise
designed to absolve the Tory party, after 16 years in office, from any
of the ills which still afflict this country.
Burglars, bureaucrats, and benefit fraudsters, as the front page of
yesterday's Daily Telegraph euphonically put it, also took it in the
neck for besmirching the miracle which is said to be Britain on the
brink of a new millennium.
The depressing process began on Tuesday with Defence Secretary Michael
Portillo's unprincipled xenophobic rant against all things Bruxellois.
His scapegoat -- a single European army bedecked with standardised
uniforms and common cap badges -- isn't even on any credible agenda.
But, like a straw man designed for bayonet practice, the darling of
the ascendant Tory right had the phantom force first stuffed, then
eviscerated in the time it took to proclaim: Our boys die for Britain,
not for Brussels.
It was, as even many Tories have had the decency to admit, a
nauseating spectacle. But Portillo was far from alone in seeking to
place the spotlight on anyone and anything which might be scapegoated
for all the sins of a Government staring electoral defeat full in the
face.
Michael Heseltine was banging on about benefit fraud even before he
got to Blackpool, as if it were some new phenomenon which had suddenly
ignited the ire of the electorate. I remember, 30 years ago, in a brief
spell as a meat porter on the fringes of Smithfield market, working
beside a couple of nothern wide boys who claimed to be both working and
signing on in a variety of fake names.
Like most people who try to play by the rules, I resent that kind of
behaviour. But fiddling the system is as old as the system itself. And
no authority that I know of believes the promised Tory crackdown will
come up with more than a token contribution to the yawning public sector
borrowing requirement. The black economy, I suspect, just grows and
grows. It is, after all, a market mechanism.
Before the week began we were promised a whole raft of new policy
ideas which would reinvigorate the Tories' appeal to a deeply sceptical
electorate. Where were these fresh policies? Wheel clamps for car tax
dodgers? Smart cards for benefit claimants? New qualifications for head
teachers?
Is this the red meat which will replenish the depleted Tory policy
larder? That much-vaunted Chequers brainstorming session has come up
with the policy equivalent of mice squeaking from behind the skirting
boards.
But there is, of course, one last significant shot left in the Tory
locker. The tax cuts which restless back benchers are vociferously
demanding but which Chancellor Ken Clarke -- constrained by pre-Budget
purdah -- could only hint at in his speech yesterday.
In what he, party chairman Dr Brian Mawhinney, and others did say
about tax there were no scapegoats. Just that familiar reaffirmation
that their party, not Labour, is the one which believes in a low-tax
economy as a core article of faith.
''Our instinct, our goal, is to cut tax. It always has been and always
will be,'' claimed Dr Mawhinney on Tuesday. ''We are the only party that
believes in lower taxation,'' echoed the Chancellor yesterday.
At times it sounded as if they were trying to convince themselves. As
well they might. For the record shows, quite decisively, that the gap
between instinct, goal, and belief on the one hand and achieved reality
on the other has remained, for most of the past 16 years, unbridged.
As a share of gross domestic product, taxes and social security
contributions in this country rose rapidly after the first Thatcher
victory in the 1979 election. Geoffrey Howe's near doubling of VAT was a
major contributory factor.
From a trough of just over 34% of GDP before that 1979 election, taxes
and social security contributions were, within three years, gobbling up
nearly 40% of GDP. That percentage then declined over the rest of the
1980s. But it was 1991 (and a protracted recession later) before the
percentage tax take fell below the 36.75% peak recorded during the
1974/79 Labour government.
With the swingeing tax increases announced in the two 1993 Budgets,
that percentage is expected to rise sharply again through the rest of
this decade. If you don't believe me, you'll find precisely that message
in the Treasury's own Red Book, page 68.
So, apart from a brief spell between 1991 and 1994, the share of the
national cake taken by successive Tory governments in taxes and social
security contributions has either been rising or has been above the peak
level set by Labour.
On that evidence, the oft-repeated Tory claim to be the low-tax party
is as bogus as Portillo's phantom European army. The basic rate of
income tax may have been cut to 25%. The higher rate may have been
consolidated at 40%. But the freezing of allowances, increases in and
extensions of VAT, and rises in national insurance contributions have
all helped torpedo the aspirations Clarke and Mawhinney were still
trumpeting this week.
IT'S a bit rich, after 16 years, still to be contemplating what the
Tories say they meant to do all along. And the problem now, with the
electoral arithmetic closing in, is finding the wherewithal to make the
much-trailed cuts.
Mr Major has promised a really tough spending round this time. But
with law and order, education, and health budgets all ring-fenced
because of manifesto commitments, the pain inflicted elsewhere will have
to be severe indeed to justify more than token tax relief.
And even if the Chancellor does manage to square the fiscal circle,
who's to say the electorate won't take the money and vote them out of
office anyway. After all, when looking around for someone to blame, the
British people have no need for scapegoats.

THE higher the sum deposited in fixed-interest investments the higher
the return and those seeking to save relatively modest amounts
invariably receive a poor deal.
A Tessa is the clear first port of call if a savings plan can be
maintained for a full five years as the interest is tax-free and more
than 7% can be obtained.
However, not everyone wants to save over five years and for those
prepared to save for a year Nationwide is offering 6% gross for amounts
saved of between #20 and #1000 a month. The catch is that no withdrawals
can be made for a year if the full rate is to be received.
The money is not actually locked up and up to six withdrawals are
allowed a year. But if any withdrawal is made the interest return drops
to only 3%. In fact, the ''Bonus Saver'' account is structured with this
rate as the base and the additional 3% is counted as a loyalty bonus.
One monthly payment can be missed without penalty but the account
clearly should not be used if there is any possibility the money might
be required before a year is up. There is provision, however, for the
monthly amounts to be varied, so long as the minimum and maximum limits
are adhered to.
Nationwide has added some bells and whistles to the account, including
an additional #100 cashback should the accountholder take out a mortgage
with the society, a 1% discount on the standard rate on a Nationwide
unsecured loan, a #150 holiday voucher giving a discount on a two-week

The bonus idea gives a strong incentive to maintain the savings plan,
which is no bad thing. Account holders are members of the society so
stand to benefit from any corporate action.
Alternatives include National Savings Investment Account with a
minimum requirement of #20 a month. The interest is currently 5.25%

A SCOTS company, which has broken into the Japanese market for auto
electronics, has won a Business Excellence Award for Exporting from
Dunbartonshire Enterprise.
McGavigan Holdings of Kirkintilloch will supply Toyoda Gosei with a
specialist membrane switch for the horn of an as yet unspecified car
model allowing air bags to be fitted.
McGavigan has already captured 85% of the US market for its innovative
product. Its customers include Ford, Volkswagen, Seat and Opel. It also
supplies America with parts for Chevrolet, Pontiac, Buick and
Oldsmobile.
Over the past 10 years it has seen annual exports grow from #477,000,
9% of turnover, to #6.4m, or 41% of turnover.
During the same period its sales have grown from #4.9m to #15.7m.

SOME brands have magic, such as Rolls-Royce or Ferrari (but not the
rather boring Mercedes). While a man may want a Hermes tie, a woman
might like to buy a Chanel suit. Their secret is their exclusivity and
the way they make us ''hunger for'' them.
Knowingly, Time Products is investing heavily in resources to build up
the Judith Leiber name. Currently it depends totally on its range of
handbags which in the US retail for the equivalent of around #300 for a
daytime bag to #2500 for one for evening use. Now Time is launching very
high quality costume jewellery with starting prices of #150 an item
using the Leiber brand. Fragrances will not be too far away and
similarly will be sold only in selected up-market shops in the US.
Chairman Marcus Margulies said that a new 11-handed watch -- which
could be the most complicated to be built in the past 50 years -- is
still in development. It will sell eventually for perhaps #2m.
Time sold a watch for just over #1m in the half year to June which
helped increase its turnover by 4% to #38.6m (despite the absence of #1m
of watchstrap sales in Canada, due to a subsidiary disposal) and profits
by 18% to #5.54m.
Both the UK and US markets have performed well but the third
territory, Switzerland, has been depressed because of the strength of
the local currency and so has given Time the opportunity to buy a shop
in Zurich and one in Zermatt.
The ski resort has 2,000,000 bed nights a year for generally high
spending people of whom more than a handful may be tempted to buy an
Audemars Piguet or Baume &amp; Mercier watch -- the luxury market is
trending upwards.
Some are tailormade for one super-rich individual -- others are made
even before there is an order although it knows some customers so well
that a sale is assured.
At almost the other extreme, sales of Sekonda watches have been good
with like-for-like sales up by 6% to about 1,500,000 units and which are
a stable source of earnings.
However the middle market range such as Longines at around #500 has
been much slower due to the recession which has hit the middle classes
harder than at any time for several decades throughout Europe.
The interim dividend has been raised 8% to 3.5p. Full-year profits
should expand by #2m to about #14.5m so that the shares at 263p would be
selling at times earnings with a likely yield of around 4.3%.
As the concept of branding becomes ever more important and underpinned
by some of the best distribution rights in the luxury industry, it could
be seen as a tempting target for LVMH or Vendome. However, it is also a
very personal business which offers exciting medium term prospects.
And while Time demonstrably knows how to sell, perhaps a slightly more
sophisticated name would be appropriate for the company.

CREOS International, a small hi-tech company based in Fife, has raised
#4m through a share placing and is joining the Alternative Investment
Market (AIM).
Creos has placed 6.7 million new shares at 65p each, which values the
company at #23.3m.
The issue has been underwritten by Greig Middleton in Glasgow and the
shares will start trading on the AIM on October 25.
Creos develops and produces high-voltage generators for use in medical
imaging systems such as X-ray machines and computed tomography (CT)
scanners.
It has built up strong links with seven companies in Europe, Japan,
and the United States which control more than 70% of the world market
for this equipment and aims to become a major supplier of components to
them.
Creos employs 40 people working on generator equipment for X-ray
machines at Dalgetty Bay in Fife and a further 30 working on components
for CT scanners at Denver, Colorado.
It was founded in 1989 by a team of Scottish and American scientists
with the help of venture capital firm Electra Asset Management.
Ivory &amp; Sime and Mercury Asset Management subsequently put more
venture capital into the company.
Creos has so far made a loss due to high start-up and research and
development costs, but it aims to become profitable in 1997.
''R&amp;D spending and the rest of the business infrastructure costs have
now reached a level where they are not going to increase,'' said chief
executive Michael Low.
On the other hand, he said, a rapid increase in sales should soon put
the company into profit.
Sales are seen rising from #4.2m in the year to September 31 to #6.8m
in 1996 and #12.2m in 1997.
Creos aims to cut its #1.5m loss in the financial year just ended to
#915,000 in 1996. A #1m pre-tax profit should follow in 1997.
Electra, Ivory &amp; Sime, and Mercury presently control 58% of Creos and
Mr Low said these three groups would maintain or slightly increase their
collective stake as a result of shares bought in the placing.
Creos directors currently own 30% of the company.
The new shares in the placing are equivalent to 18.6% of the enlarged
stock of the company.

MOST of us stay healthy; we all go to school. Nothing, not even the
sacred status of a national health service which was always going to run
out of adequate funds, is more important than education. In Third World
countries they are hungry for it. The appetite for learning gnaws at the
bellies of the pups of the tiger economies. In this country, children
creep unwillingly to school.
Who can blame them? Over the past 25 years their elders and betters
have been brawling like playground bullies over education policy, and
there is still no level playing field for the nation's young. There
never will be, until some fantasy government razes to the ground every
school which isn't funded by the state and controlled by its local
authorities. Even then, the level playing field would have vantage
points for some and sidelines for others, but the demands for investment
in education would become universally clamorous.
Until that happens -- and it won't, in your lifetime or mine -- the
Labour Party does well to trim its ideological sails. Tinkering with
independent or grant-aided schools not only has little impact on the
state system but leaves Labour rudely exposed to the charge of
''nauseating hypocrisy'' fired off by Michael Heseltine in his
conference speech this week.
When it comes to the fruits of our loins we are all hypocrites.
Publicly we admire other people's children, privately we want our own to
be brainier and better-looking. The decent parent suppresses this base
instinct and the wise parent is only too aware that we're usually
required to settle for less. But the desire to advance our children, to
supply them with armour for the brutal world, to give them -- yes --
advantage in their personal struggles for survival, is visceral; which
is why young Euan Blair may become a footnote in political history.
With its revised policy on grant-maintained schools the Labour Party,
prompted by Euan's dad, has inched towards a position which the
religious will recognise as ''acceptance''. Labour has accepted the
pluralist nature of our education system, accepted that there's only so
much you can do to change human nature (although you must never stop
cultivating its better side) and accepted, although not admitted, that
some of its MPs and many of its disciples have indeed been guilty of
hypocrisy in the contortions they employ to protect their own children
from the mediocre end of state education.
Thousands of Labour households must be sleeping sounder, easier of
conscience, since Euan Blair made his first eight-mile journey to London
Oratory. Harriet Harman's children, and the children of Paul Boateng,
the party's legal affairs spokesman, are already installed in opt-out
schools, and other luminaries of the parliamentary party, according to a
waspish story in the Sunday Times, buy private education through the
back door by hiring tutors for their children. (The MP for Workington,
Dale Campbell-Savours, offered the lamentable excuse that he was unable
to give his children personal help because of his commitments as a
politician.)
Others again -- Labour, Tory, LibDem, SNP or Monster Raving Loony --
choose their homes with calculation, sometimes moving house to snuggle
up to the best local authority school available either because they
can't afford school fees or because their ethics won't authorise them. I
don't sneer at those parents. I've been there, too; I've done some
tormented, ideological wrestling in the ring of educational equity and
parental self-interest, but I've also seen how those ethics crumble when
the state system comes into conflict with itself.
A few years ago Lothian education authority, faced with a declining
population in one of its ''sink'' secondaries, decided to close this
school of ill-repute and instal its pupils in a thriving, middle-class
comprehensive in the Labour-held constituency of Edinburgh Central. The
proposed amalgamation was more of an assimilation -- of the failing
school by the prospering one -- but it brought out the teeth and claws
of the local parents.
School board and PTA united against the merger, which went ahead. Many
were Labour voters, some were even party activists, but they were less
than eager to open their hearts and classrooms to a potential underclass
of pupils. History has shamed them. There have been peripheral social
problems imported by some of the new pupils, but the school's academic
record hasn't suffered.
Hoist with their own hypocrisy. Despite its reflex of distaste for the
independent sector and its menacing of the assisted places scheme (a
gnat's nibble from the education budget) the Labour Party's soul looks
cleaner for the example shown and the policy inspired by Euan Blair's
schooldays. I have London friends who did their own soul-scouring years
ago when their daughter's Camden Town primary failed to teach her to
read by the age of seven and told them their anxiety was the product of
middle-class hang-ups about literacy. They stopped voting Labour and
started paying fees.
I have another London friend, herself a former teacher, who also tried
to keep her children in the state system. Eventually they went to Harrow
where, she says, their education was no superior to the one she received
at the Lancashire grammar school which, 30 years ago, prepared her for
an Oxford scholarship. She has never forgiven the Labour government of
Harold Wilson for ''destroying'' her grammar school.
These tales came to me over the years from a distant country. When I
was growing up in Scotland, and for a long time afterwards, the whole
idea of fees, private schools, independent education was almost risibly
exotic.
''The Scottish education system is first class,'' said Gillian
Shephard, the Education Secretary, announcing her initiative to improve
spoken English. Old reputations die hard, and become myths. These days
the Scottish education system is only patchily first class, and when the
time came, last spring, to make a final decision about our daughter's
secondary school I felt a melancholy sense of betrayal.
As we signed her up for the independent sector I felt the ghost of my
father standing at my shoulder. Until he retired in the seventies he
spent his adult life teaching languages in some of Scotland's best
schools: Hamilton Academy, North Berwick High, Aberdeen Grammar. But in
the seven years our daughter spent at her local primary there were never
fewer than 33 pupils in her class. At her new school there are never
more than 13.

PAUL Fitzgerald does not exchange Christmas gifts with the adults in
his family -- a decision they reached amicably five years ago. ''It's
not a big moral issue. It just means more to us to sit down and eat
together,'' he explains. Fitzgerald is a founder member of Enough, an
anti-consumerism society based in Manchester. The campaigning
organisation was set up three years ago when a group of like-minded
friends -- all working for charities -- met together to address how
western consumerism contributes to Third World poverty. Their starting
point was that 20% of the world's population consumes approximately 80%
of its global resources.
''Unless we want to dictate to the Third World, to tell them to stay
poor -- something has to change,'' argues Fitzgerald who, with six
colleagues, helps run Enough on a shoestring, part-time.
Enough activists deny they have anything in common with Scrooge,
however. Fitzgerald insists he enjoys Christmas (''It should be a
community celebration''); he simply advocates moderation. ''We're
saying, do you really have to buy gifts for everyone? Do you have to
send a card to everyone?''
He is not trying to convert us to an ecologically poor Christmas;
rather, he is urging us to resist all the pressures of the market place.
After all, Christmas is the ultimate consumerist nightmare. The
atmosphere ends up polluted with C0[2] from the manufacture of millions
of gifts which, in turn, end up disposed of by those they were destined
for. And there's more. ''Toys are produced in the Third World. But the
fact is, we're not willing to pay the real price for these in terms of
child labour, low wages and safety.''
Small wonder then, that in the USA, birthplace of that temple of
consumer culture, the department store, there is an organisation
specifically opposed to yuletide consumerism. The Society To Curtail
Ridiculous, Outrageous And Ostentatious Gift Exchanges encourages
sensible, pragmatic purchases such as smoke alarms, first aid kits and
self-improvement classes. Fitzgerald, who is single, goes along with the
anti-ostentatious part, but he is less po-faced, and all for a bit of
festive frivolity. ''Last year, I bought the kids in my family a load of
things from a joke shop at 50p each. They were nuts for it!''
Basically, Enough wants people to be aware of profligacy, wanton
behaviour which reaches obscene heights at Christmas, with individuals
squandering hundreds of pounds on each other. Last year, to support
Enough's annual No Shop Day (1995's was last month), Aberdeen
University's Green Society sold (empty) bags of happiness in the city
centre.
Edinburgh's shopping thoroughfares are to become the focus for a spree
with a difference. Subscribers to Edinburgh University's open studies
course on Shopping and Gift Giving: The Cultural Wrappings (Thursday
evenings -- October 19 for nine weeks) are to be taken on a field trip
in the thick of the consumer bonanza. Course lecturer Elspeth Murray, a
graduate in social anthropology, explains that ''participant
observation'' is the hallmark of her science.
''Using themselves as research tools, students learn the language, so
to speak, and become one of a family.'' Murray hopes students will
follow up individual interests, but she expects some to look, for
example, at the way products are marketed for children. Or at how
charity shops try to emulate mainstream stores. Or how sales assistants
interact with customers.
Back in the classroom students will be urged to reflect on such
conundrums as whether Christmas shopping is a necessary evil and what
makes a family ritual. ''There's so much going on we take for granted,''
cautions Murray. ''This class offers a chance to stand back. So many
marketing devices are designed to lift the Christmas shopping experience
out of the ordinary, to disguise the fact that we're spending.''
The ruse is to persuade us suckers that what we're buying is special.
Soft music, lights and decorations conspire to make us feel all goey
inside, to remind us of special relationships and to help us forget
we're in, well, a shop. ''Sometimes staff dress up -- another
transformation of the ordinary. Wrapping gifts instore, works in a
similar way. It's not just a watch you're buying -- it's a Christmas
gift watch.''
At 25, Murray herself is the kind of consumer Enough would be proud
of. Having had a sound Presbyterian introduction to gift-buying in
childhood (''we had a family bank account for Christmas, so we'd go to
Woolworths. We were encouraged to think carefully'') she now buys lots
of goods second hand. This isn't moral superiority, a cheap ride on the
back of consumerism. ''Buying second hand shouldn't be about filling
one's wardrobe faster -- it works only if you're recycling.''
Murray has always had an interest on the social and cultural forces
lurking behind shopping habits -- factors like layout and advertising
and gimmicks. By de-romanticising Christmas, she believes, we risk
destroying the mystery necessary to sustain an important family ritual.
''Consumerism isn't necessarily opposed to the warmth and social aspects
of Christmas, but it can run away with itself.'' Christmas shopping
should be kept in perspective: an enjoyable lead-up to the more
significant aspects of the festive season.

THE tribunes of Glasgow's local government have been exercising
themselves this week on the subject of traffic in the city. Strathclyde
Regional Council has agreed a new offensive to keep cars out of the city
centre.
Certain areas will become no-go areas for private motorists.
Car-parking restrictions will be extended to cover early evenings and
weekends -- to the chagrin of those who fancy popping into town for a
spot of socialising.
At the same time the good cooncillors of Glasgow District Council have
been sitting in judgment on whether to allow planning permission for an
extension to the M74 road system, allowing cars to speed more easily
around the East End of the city. They decided to allow the #250m plan to
go ahead.
Why is the Diary blethering on about this? we can hear you ask. Well,
we have in front of us a communication from the town clerk's office at
the City Chambers to members of the planning sub-committee on
development control which met to consider the above proposal on city
traffic.
It reads: ''This hearing will take place in the City Halls,
Candleriggs, on Wednesday, October 11 at 10am. A bus will be available
at the front of the City Chambers at 9.30am to take members to the City
Halls. The bus will also be available at the close of the hearing to
bring members back to the City Chambers to make a decision on the
application.''
Those familiar with the geography of Glasgow city centre will know
that it is no more than a five-minute stroll from the City Chambers to
the City Hall. Even councillors used to being chauffeured from lunch to
reception should know that you turn left down on to Ingram Street, left
again, straight on for about 400 yards, turn right and there's the City
Halls.
It is a classic case of one law for the citizen motorists and another
for the elected representatives. Glasgow's council officials will not be
worrying, either, about the new draconian parking regime. Just check out
the number of free car parks they have allotted themselves in the city
centre.
Cheese and wine
LATEST essential purchase for the Monklands resident who has drunk the
wine, had the hangover, and served the 30 days in prison for breach of
the peace is a new range of furniture from Banquet Kitchens. It is
called the Buckfast range. As the catalogue states: ''Fresh blue willow
patterns naturally go together with Buckfast like apples and cheese . .
.''
Flattering portrait
ONE of the speakers at the Tory conference in Blackpool was John
Godfrey. The party thoughtfully provides a pen portrait of each speaker.
It tells us that Mr Godfrey works in finance, was the Conservative
candidate in Glasgow Maryhill in the General Election, and was its
candidate for Strathclyde West in the Euro election last year.
It fails to mention a certain other election, the by-election in Perth
and Kinross this spring, in which the boy did not do at all good and
lost the Tory seat to the SNP.
The Name Game
ONE of Strathclyde's finest at Bellshill cop shop, according to the
Motherwell People newspaper crime column, is a PC Hearsay. Wonder how
his evidence goes down in court?
Sheer phantasmic
WE know that life in Scotland can be pretty damn exciting but we feel
that the curators of a proposed exhibition at the Centre for
Contemporary Arts in Glasgow may be pushing their luck.
The exhibition is to be called Phenomenal and the organisers ask:
''Have you ever been abducted by an alien being? Do you have direct
experience of strange possibilities -- miracles, apparitions, magic, or
the paranormal?''
They are also interested in anyone who ''may have heard strange sounds
or voices''. If any of the above applies to you, and we are sure it must
to about half of the population even if they are not from Kilwinning,
contact the CCA on 0141 332 7521.
Sales sweetener
A SWEDISH-owned company caled Dpnova, which makes dentures, crowns,
and other artefacts for the gumsy, has been handing out free gifts. So
what are these promotional items? Toothbrushes? Dental floss? Fixatives
for keeping the wallies in place?
No. Sticks of rock bearing the company name. Nothing like making sure
the business keeps flooding in.
Exported business
DIARY reader David Lamb, late of Garthamlock, Glasgow, and now working
in Jakarta, Indonesia, passes on an article in Asia Inc business
magazine about how South Korea is poised to claim the title of the
world's premier shipbuilding nation.
The magazine has a photo of the busy Daewoo Heavy Industries shipyard
in Pusan. It may remind older Glaswegians of what the Clyde used to be
like when our shipyards were working full out. Appropriately, the name
of one of the supertankers under construction is clearly visible. It is
called the Golar Glasgow.
Great minds at work
WE have a report of a meeting of electronic engineers at a factory in
South Queensferry. During a discussion on a certain problem, a boffin
was heard to exclaim: ''I can count the number of times this has
happened on one hand and it's at least half-a-dozen.''
From the mailbag
THE Rev Eric V Hudson of Westerton Parish Church in Bearsden was moved
to write after our reference to Pastor Jack Glass and his ''No Pope
Here!'' banners in St Peter's Square, Rome. He tells of the time he met
the late Cardinal Gordon Gray in his home at 42 Greenhill Gardens,
Edinburgh. He broached the subject of the Pope's visit and asked the
cardinal if there had been trouble when the Pope was staying with him.
The cardinal replied: ''No. The nearest we got to trouble was when I
noticed that someone had chalked -- very neatly -- on the gatepost of
the house next door the words 'No Pope Here'. I felt like adding, 'Try
number 42'.''

* CRIME fighters have stolen an idea from Russian space research to
help householders suss out unwanted callers this winter.
A new ''all-seeing'' front door spy hole gives a 200-degree view
covering both sides of the door frame -- a notorious blindspot.
Another space age innovation: a burglar alarm that runs on solar
power, needing no wiring or mains electricity. Battery-operated
detectors inside the home transmit security coded radio signals to an
outside siren/strobe light, recharged even on the dullest days.
For information contact security firms (listed in Yellow Pages) or the
crime prevention officer at your local police station.
* AFTER intensive research, the Potato Marketing Board has made an
earth-shattering discovery: we prefer our potatoes mashed! This is just
as well, as the Board's new recipe booklet is called The Perfect Mash.
The fact that this is also the opening recipe suggests we may have
been getting it wrong for 400 years. Method: cook potatoes in salted
water for 20 minutes, drain, add butter and hot milk -- cold milk makes
potatoes heavy and sticky. Now they tell us!
With last month's wet weather and the current warm spell promoting
growth, fears of a price hike this winter are now on the back boiler. So
the booklet, with adventurous offerings like curry raita, provencal
gratin and prawn patties is a passport to cheap, healthy eating.
For a free copy send a large sae to PMB, Broad Field House, Four
Between Towns Road, Cowley, Oxford, OX4 3NA.

I ONCE had a boss who was wont to announce things like ''These things
are sent to try us'', or ''Jist crosses we huv to bear, boays'', and
even ''We urr jist the poor bluidy infantry''. When he got to ''Our's
not tae wonder why . . .'' you were dementit with it. He wasn't just the
boss: he was the owner. He was the origin of our woes, he was the
engineer of our misery, he was the great architect of our misfortune.
What particularly stuck in the craw, however, were not the woes,
miseries, or misfortunes: it was the fortitude with which he met them on
our behalf. For Mr James Wilson, factor of this parish some 30 odd years
ago, possessed a splendid agility in shifting his fault to ours. I think
I could have managed without the sigh of sympathy to the recipients of
his wiliness. And especially the cosy phrases with which he expressed
his regret at the sheer bloodiness of a world he had created for his
employees. And to this day I cannot abide phrases which send you adrift
into the Slough of Despond. Actually I am not sure I can take phrases at
all, unless I write them.
I used to enjoy getting annoyed, but now I take no sanguine pleasure
in the process. There's simply too much to get annoyed about. Phrases,
words, deeds, people, newpapers and television, politics. Pronunciations
and accents for a beginning. I used to think the worst thing I had to
encounter was Donald Dewar and his ilk, people who could contrive to be
passionate and boring at the same time, and who spoke for minutes with
their eyes closed and the palms of their soft hands pressed together in
a silent salute to the dignity of manual labour.
Actually Dewar possibly started up one of the worst affectations of
speech for other politicians and so-called community leaders and social
work directors and academics might just have learned the irritating
habit from this most anodyne of Scottish political leaders. The habit of
pronouncing ''the'' as ''thee'', usually with closed eyes and palms
pressed together in a wee scholarly tent shape. ''Thee problem with thee
situation, is perhaps thee difficulty in addressing thee question, which
is . . .''.
THEE problem with yet another word is thee word ''addressing'' for a
start. ''If I may address thee question . . .'' No you may not, you
scions of thee Glasgow Academy (Donald then skipped off to thee Glasgow
Yooni, thereby displaying the sort of imagination for which he has been
ever since noted), and no you may not at that because I don't want thee
question adressed. I want it answered, if you don't mind. A forlorn
consideration. Forlorn because an answer, instead of an address, is not
on the agenda.
This word ''agenda'' is part of the ''thee'' syndrome, and addressing
questions, and ticking two fingers of both hands to denote quotations
marks and if it were myself I would be releasing Duncan Ferguson from
the Wendy House ower in the East End of my city that he might therefore
rectify such abhorrences with the vigour he seems to display in stadia
and railway stations and other spots where the proletariat gather. Wan
with the nut might do the job.
What in heaven's name is this agenda nonsense? An agenda means in fact
a list of things to be done. Politicians have subverted the word
entirely. It doesn't mean things to be done anymore and not at all.
Politicians don't know anything about things to be done apart from an
expenses sheet. True, Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov once wrote a pamphlet
titled What Is To Be Done (so of course did the convener of post-war
austerity, Stafford Cripps, in an enlightening tract in which he
envisaged a merry life of riotous fun filling in forms in post offices
run by a character invented by Gogol).
Well V I Lenin at least knew what was to be done and had an agenda to
boot. The Kulaks soon found out all about it and so did the rest of the
Dead Souls. At least we know that no present politician is going to
enact an agenda, though he might possibly address one. What is this
damned agenda that trips off politicians', telly presenters', and
illiterate journos' lips?
''What is your agenda?'' is a question which might be what Craig Brown
is going to address about his team not playing very well, but it could
also be what Duncan Ferguson is going to have for his tea tonight. And
out of the mouths of babes did we not have our youngest political
figure, stating that his agenda was closing hospitals and impoverishing
his own mum for bringing up a family on her own.
The young Justin Hinchcliffe, who was to be heralded as the
13-year-old star of the Conservative Party conference this week, told us
his agenda. I have mine. Thee agenda is to boot him up his dreadful wee
erse. His maw's agenda should be to do it first and start on the rest of
thee Tory politicians. Thee answer really.

KEITH BRUCE meets Tony Reekie who intends to give children's theatre
fresh impetus
THE Scottish International Children's Festival yesterday named the
successor to its founding director Duncan Low who is leaving the event
he established six years ago to work in children's theatre in Canada. He
is 30-year-old Tony Reekie, who himself founded the highly-rated
Scottish children's theatre company Visible Fictions, now based at the
MacRobert Arts Centre, Stirling.
The appointment of Reekie, a young man whose commitment to
high-quality professional theatre for young people is beyond doubt, will
be widely welcomed, even if his departure from the company he
established raises parallel concerns.
It is no coincidence that Visible Fictions won a Bank of
Scotland-funded commission for new work for young people at this year's
festival in Edinburgh. The resulting work, a staging of the popular
children's tale Pinocchio, will be seen at the 1996 festival, which runs
from May 22 to 26.
Reekie, whose brother Iain is director of 7:84 Theatre Company, said
yesterday that there had been no question of him continuing to manage
Visible Fictions while running the festival.
''This is a full-time job and there would be an obvious confict of
interest. I want to set things up so that the management of the company
is maintained. The artistic team is in place and I have always been more
of a producer, so we will be bringing someone in in a management role,''
he says.
As ever, however, funding is an issue. Visible Fictions may be the
only children's theatre company receiving guaranteed funding from the
Scottish Arts Council, but Reekie has effectively subsidised it on a
personal basis. While he is confident about the future of the company,
he is concerned at the level of salary he is likely to be able to offer
a new general manager.
While Visible Fictions' #25,000 a year for this and two subsequent
years is undoubtedly an important step forward, it does not compare with
the #90,000 grant which is awarded to English company Pop Up Theatre,
who visited the MacRobert this week. Reekie admits that it can be
embarrassing when his organisation is approached by better-supported
organisations from overseas seeking to collaborate with Visible Fictions
to have to decline on the grounds of lack of cash.
It is an argument he will be pursuing in his new role. ''This is an
opportunity to work on a wider scale. I hope a real body of work can be
created in Scotland. I want to start a general conversation about why
funded companies don't do shows for young people. My brother, for
example, says only that it is not part of 7:84's policy.''
His aim for the children's festival is straightforward: ''I want it to
connect with and thrill as many children as it possibly can. The
festival has been really succesful in giving a focus for work that had
never really been seen in Scotland before.
''It has a great relationship with schools who come to the Inverleith
Park site and not only see a show but are part of an all-day experience.
Rather than being seen as an organisation that presents work, I want it
to be an interactive, all-encompassing experience.
''I want to get away from the idea of theatre being an 'arty'
experience. It has been really successful with the schools audience, but
we need a broad cross-section of people to come along. The arts are not
separate from where children are culturally. Television is very
important for them and we have to acknowledge that, but we don't want
them to grow up thinking that theatre is not something for them.''

<TEXT>
DIETING can damage your health, according to new research released
yesterday.
''Dieting is not very healthy -- it screws up your metabolism,'' said
Dr Mike Green of the Institute of Food Research in Reading after four
years of research into the effects of dieting.
He said yesterday that diets caused anxiety and stress and it was this
mental pressure that caused the problems, not the diets themselves.
Dr Green, a research psychologist, tested a group of people with a
variety of mental exercises. Some of the people were on diets, some were
not.
In a series of tests, he concluded:
* Dieters ''display a poor ability to concentrate''.
* ''Reaction time and short-term memory are impaired'' for those on
diets.
* Diets cause as much stress as school exams and impair performance to
the same extent as two units of alcohol.
* Food deprivation in itself has no effect on mental ability.
''Constantly thinking about food and worrying about diet means that
dieters don't have enough mental processing capacity to deal with tasks
properly,'' he said.
Mrs Caryl Richards, a field manager for slimming organisation Slimming
World, said Dr Green was right.
She said: ''You are feeling hungry, you are deprived of the foods you
would normally like, you become obsessed with what you can and cannot
eat -- of course it's going to become an obsession.''
Mrs Richards said diets had to focus on long-term eating patterns, not
short-term crash diets and she said Slimming World would not recommend
crash diets.
Dr Green agreed that the solution was a consistently healthy diet, not
''yo-yo'' dieting -- coming on and off harsh regimes in a desperate bid
to lose weight.

IS IT the Father Christmas, the nativity scene or the charity which
determines the choice of card? In the season of goodwill, it has long
been politically incorrect to buy anything other than charity cards, but
if supporting a particular cause is our main motive, we should be
careful how we go about it.
Scots have to be aware that many English charities extend their
fundraising to Scotland without extending their work here, and often
allow people to assume they are UK charities when they are not, warns
Lucy Pratt, policy analyst of the Scottish Council for Voluntary
Organisations. It is not always clear from a name like Mencap or Mind
that these charities operate only in England, but anyone who wants to
help people with learning disabilities in Scotland should support Enable
or the Scottish Association for Mental Health.
It sounds unnecessarily petty, but according to Lucy Pratt: ''Charity
Christmas cards are an illustration that in all forms of fundraising for
charity the big are getting bigger. The big London-based charities which
are usually English charities, but occasionally UK-wide, are in a
position to strike deals for the use of their name for the kind of
promotion which means that 1p from the sale of a chocolate bar goes to
charity, but only organisations with dedicated fundraising staff can do
that. In UK terms, the vast majority of Scottish charities are medium or
small.''
That means they are increasingly being squeezed by the professional
fundraisers, who live on commission or a salary paid by a charity,
according to Neville Bass, chief executive of the Charity Christmas Card
Council, more snappily known as 4C. When 100 charities banded to market
the fairly new idea of charity Christmas cards 30 years ago, the
collective approach was met with a huge amount of opposition from the
commercial sector, which foresaw the erosion of one of their biggest
profit margins. Bass believes that the publishers and retailers of
commercial cards are still trying to undermine sales where all the
profit goes to charity, but this time more cynically on the basis of
''if we can't beat them, let's join them''.
His wrath is directed at the royalties deals between big publishers
and a few of the major charities. The resultant cards are sold in high
street newsagents and supermarkets with an endorsement that a certain
amount will go to particular charities from the sale of the cards. He
believes that many people do not realise that the percentage charities
receive is usually between 5% and 10% of the profit -- a very poor
donation to the cause compared with the 100% after expenses from sales
through charity shops or direct mail-order.
As a result of the Charities Act of 1992, there has to be a statement
of the proportion of the price which goes to charity, but there is no
regulation over the size of the print, complains Bass. ''When we were
set up by the charities themselves we established two main ways of
selling cards. The first was to the business community with an executive
range catalogue which sells across the business community. They choose
whichever charities they want to support but come to us for one-stop
shopping and after all the sales are over we send each charity a note of
the amount we have raised on their behalf.
''In 1993, the total was #2m, last year it was down to #1.85m. Our
expenses are in printing the catalogue, compiling a list and sending
them out to customers. The second is through the 4C shops, which we beg
or borrow in key regional centres as well as in London,'' he said. None
of their shops are in Scotland where individual charities open their own
or rely on volunteers to run sales for a number of charities in their
local hall.
Bass estimates that licensing deals have more than trebled in terms of
turnover. ''Obviously the publishers tend to favour the big ticket
charities. The Save the Children Fund has far greater appeal than the
Eczema Society. Only a dedicated minority of people are locked into
specific charities and are on their mailing lists. The majority of
people simply want to send Christmas cards and if they can also support
a charity that is a bonus.
''What some of the charities who have signed up for these deals have
not realised is that they are undermining their sustainable income. One
year a publisher will ask charity A to get into bed with him and on the
face of it, they will be able to increase their Christmas income several
times; but the next year the publisher will favour charity Y. Since most
charities live a hand-to-mouth existence, they cannot turn down the
possibility of big returns even for one year, but this is not
sustainable. The price they pay is their independence and a whittling
away at their own trading operation.''
Charities with their own retailing operations make a similar profit
margin to the retail average according to research due to be published
later this year. Research carried out for 4C by the market research
company Mintel estimated the turnover on charities own-brand cards last
year at #42m, which would give them a profit of between 40% and 60% of
that sum.
Jonathan Chambers, Christmas card supremo of the Cancer Research
Campaign, has several agreements with major retailers, which ''provide
income at an acceptable level'', he says. His best deal is with English
high street giant W H Smith in which #1 of a pack of cards which sells
for #4.25 goes to Cancer Research. He admits that is one of the better
deals due to the popular nature of this particular charity.
''Generally the deal is about 15% and we don't have production costs
to worry about. Even if it is a lower return, the volume of sales is
going to be much greater if people can buy the cards in major stores
when they are doing the rest of their Christmas shopping. I think it is
our duty to get as much income as we possibly can, after all we do not
benefit from the National Lottery,'' he said.
The same approach is taken by the British Heart Foundation, whose
trading manager, Fiona MacMillan, says: ''In an ideal world, there would
not be any royalty deals, but you have to live with commercial reality
and that means that major retailers are going to continue selling cards
and are not going to give all the profits to charity.''
For the first time this year under fundraising regulations attached to
the Charities Act, goods sold in aid of charity in England are required
to state how much of the retail price will go to the charity.
They do not apply in Scotland, where charities and voluntary
organisations have been campaigning for a review of charities
legislation. But if we are unable to seek out a Scottish charity we can
at least see how much of our money is going to good works elsewhere.

DIRECTOR Gerard Murphy has amalgamated a hotchpotch of theatrical
styles in this Royal Lyceum Theatre Company's production of Bertolt
Brecht's quirky cautionary tale, which is basically an earthy version of
Solomon's judgment. The first scene -- The Dispute Over The Valley, with
opposing factions of a communist bloc disputing the most fruitful use of
a piece of land -- is firmly rooted in stark Eastern European
traditions, with the cast nonchalantly milling about on an open set, the
rigging exposed and the action played out under full house lights.
Then we are plunged into the play within the play, a body enactment of
a thirteenth-century Chinese fable, here realised in playful Scottish
and northern English vernacular and stylised in pantomine hyperbole to
the extent that the governor's wife is played by Michael Percival
Maxwell in drag, if somewhat restrained drag.
Lively direction, involving a continual stream of role-changing, keeps
the cast on their toes and the audience alert but despite some very
humorous setpieces, often verging on slapstick -- with some particularly
strong performances from Russell Hunter, the magnificent Ann Louise
Ross, and Jimmy Chisholm who cannot fail to extract some laughs from his
enactment of courtroom flourish -- there was a lacklustre air to it all.
Louise Gold's characterisation as Grusche, the maid servant who looks
after her mistress's abandoned child, is deliberately flat and
unemotional. It's an intriguing, difficult, and very accomplished
portrayal yet ultimately one which exacerbates the dullness which
pervades the piece which leaves you feeling dissatisfied for all its
cleverness.

DEFENCE Secretary Michael Portillo yesterday made it clear that he
would do everything possible to help solve the problem of dangerous
munitions being washed on to the Scottish coastline.
His intervention came hard on the heels of Scottish Secretary Michael
Forsyth voicing concern at the situation, which has seen beaches on the
Firth of Clyde, Ayrshire, and Argyll littered with more than 1000
phosphorus sticks.
Earlier this week, The Herald reported that both Ministers'
departments, along with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food,
appeared to be absolving themselves of responsibility for finding the
source of the outbreak.
But, within 24 hours of our story, Mr Forsyth had ''explained the
importance attached by the Scottish Office (to this matter)'' to Mr
Portillo.
Yesterday, a Ministry of Defence spokesman said the Defence Secretary
took the view that full support should be offered to the local
authorities, police, and coastguards in the clean-up operation.
''We do not know whether the munitions were ever the property of the
MoD or any of the forces, but Mr Portillo has spoken to Mr Forsyth and
has agreed that help should be offered in whatever area is necessary,''
he said. The Defence Secretary will also meet Ayrshire MPs George
Foulkes and Brian Wilson to discuss their concerns when the Commons
resumes next week.
Mr Portillo's spokesman said there was no evidence to support the
theory the munitions were leaking from Beaufort's Dyke, the deep trench
in the Irish Sea between Belfast and Stranraer where thousands of tons
of nuclear waste are submerged along with chemical weapons and munitions
from the Second World War.
Earlier this week, a Clyde Coastguard spokesman suggested a more
probable source was a munitions dump east of Arran. It has also been
claimed the sticks were washed ashore after work done for British Gas in
preparing the route for its inter-connector pipeline from Scotland to
Northern Ireland.
One source said the company was deliberately clearing the way by
''ploughing'' the sea bed to eliminate any munitions and thus avoid
damage to expensive pipe-laying equipment. British Gas has insisted that
its contractor is doing ''nothing outside of normal maritime activity''.
Clyde Coastguard said last night that the operation to destroy the
phosphorus sticks had been scaled down, but there were still reports of
objects being washed ashore.
Warnings signs have been posted on all affected beaches, and visits
have been made to most schools, warning pupils not to touch the sticks.

PROMOTED as Glasgow's main contribution to National Poetry Day, A
Woman's Life and Love fulfilled its aim to ''celebrate the complex and
passionate expression of women artists''. Combining emotionally charged
poetry and song, old and new, this delightful programme entertained a
large and appreciative audience from start to finish.
Robert Schumann's Frauen-Liebe und Leben demonstrates perfectly the
familiar plight of a woman in love, juggling emotions from one minute to
the next, the love-struck virgin versus the tragic heroine. Sandra
Porter's mezzo-soprano found an easy route through the many different
personalities. From playful flirtation through blissful marriage to
woeful death, Porter's was a captivating interpretation.
Contrasting with the Schumann came the evening's showpiece -- the
world premiere of Clara -- a collaboration between Scottish writer
Janice Galloway and adopted-Scottish composer Sally Beamish. Composed as
a continuous song cycle, the piece celebrates the life of Clara
Schumann, wife of Richard, and takes his Frauen-Liebe und Leben as its
starting point.
Presented with Galloway's exquisite text, Beamish has delivered an
absolute jewel of a score. A predominantly rhapsodic vocal line, the
whole cycle could be mistaken for the central aria to any tragic opera,
such is the urgency of the marriage between words and music.
Impressionistic note clusters and jagged leaps around the keyboard focus
the predominantly romantic musical style of this brilliant miniature.
''Music -- that is how poets speak'', wrote Galloway in her text,
confirmed by Gerda Stevenson who read a considered selection of women's
poetry. Every one a delight, Janet Paisley's Words for my Daughter was
given a fitting dedication to Sally Beamish and her days-old daughter
Stephanie Rose -- another female artist is born.

IN Benchtour's most accomplished piece of theatre to date, playwright
John Harvey and the company look down both ends of a telescope at a
painful domestic tragedy. Rachel (Catherine Gillard) has just buried her
young son and, in a confused attempt to make order out of her mental
chaos, trips off into a nightmare of cosmic proportions.
The limboland she finds herself in is an unpredictable purgatory
populated by gangster scientists, kangaroo courts, the ghosts of Galileo
and Einstein, and a library in which the words can't be relied upon to
stay on the page. Her emotional distress, in other words, is set against
the disorder of an unfathomable universe.
Under the direction of Pete Brooks, with a company of extras bumping
the cast list to almost 30, this is the most disciplined I've seen
Benchtours. And thanks to constant movement, Paul Sorley's lighting and
an excellent semi-operatic score by Pete Livingstone, it is a delight to
behold.
There were times, though, when I wished the production were in some
unknown foreign language, for the text often seems a distraction rather
than a useful contribution to the whole. It's not really John Harvey's
fault, but in the absence of any major plot development (it's all
atmosphere rather than story), his long sequences of bogus astronomical
theory don't move anything substantially forward.
And somewhere in there lies the weakness of the production overall,
which is that although it's a weird, fascinating and slickly realised
vision of chaos, it isn't sufficiently rooted in reality to have very
much meaning or lasting emotional resonance.

JEWELLERS have founded an international body to crack down on the sale
of bogus top brand name watches, often used as a means to launder money
by organised crime.
The UK's sole representative on the board of the Association
Interprofessionelle de la Haute Horlogerie is Glasgow-based Mr Stuart
Laing, chairman of Laing the Jewellers.
Mr Laing said yesterday that the group would join law enforcement
agencies, including Interpol, to combat imitations ''in the interests of
both the consumer and the trade''.
He added: ''We are pledged to fight against both disloyal commercial
practices within the profession and against practices detrimental to
fine watch-making.''
AIHH was determined to raise standards within the industry and curb
the worldwide trade in counterfeit watches which is worth billions of
pounds a year.
Mr Laing added: ''There are factories producing imitations by the
thousands. Profits often go to organised crime, and includes money
laundering by those in drugs.''

MARGARET Flett has spent 27 years collecting miniatures of whisky --
and she hasn't touched a drop.
Now she wants to sell her collection of 1500 bottles, which takes up
an entire wall of her living room.
Mrs Flett, 52, from Montrose, said: ''I have never drunk any of the
stuff. The smell of it is enough to put me off.'' She started her hobby
after her father gave her a whisky miniature. She has travelled all over
Scotland in her quest for every kind of whisky miniature and has spent
more than #5000 on her collection.
''Every time I saw a miniature I just had to buy it,'' she said. ''I
have malts, grains, and blended whiskies from all over Scotland.''
Now she has put every bottle up for sale. ''I just got fed up with
them all and decided it was time to put an end to it all,'' she said.
''But I want the collection to stay together, so I'm looking for
another collector to buy them.''

Margaret Vaughan examines the different approaches to the control of
drugs in schools
RIGHT, one last check of the schoolbag: maths homework, clean
knickers, hanky, playpiece, dope. Dope? Oh yes, if you believe all you
read, cannabis has replaced Woodbine as the favoured gasper behind the
bikeshed.
While it's true that the story of the primary four pupil peddling his
mammy's jellies in the playground for a Mars Bar has become another
urban myth there is at least enough anecdotal evidence in numbers
suspended for possession of illegal substances to believe that locking
the school gate is not enough to ensure schools remain drug-free zones.
It may be that the use of soft drugs among pupils simply reflects the
availability of drugs in the wider community. What is clear is that drug
misuse among young people is not peculiar to any section of the
community. From the playing fields of Eton to the playground of Plockton
High, no school is immune to the dangers of illegal substance abuse.
Which makes it all the more strange, then, that there are no national
guidelines laid down by the Scottish Office on how education authorities
should deal with drug incidents in schools.
Scottish local authorities have worked out their own procedures, which
vary from authority to authority, evolving flexible responses on how to
react to individual cases. But, the Scottish Office admitted yesterday,
there is no central advice offered on how to tackle drug-taking among
pupils.
Yesterday, in Dublin, headmasters of public schools gathered to hear
recommendations for a set of new guidelines on tackling drug misuse in
the private sector.
In Scotland, advice is issued by the education departments of regional
authorities to individual schools. The appropriate response will vary.
In Strathclyde, for example, the circular No 71(a) issued to head
teachers says: ''The police should be informed immediately by the head
of establishment and asked to attend to give advice . . . The nature of
the offence should be defined by the police before further action is
taken . . .''
By contrast, in Central region, the circular advises head teachers who
discover a child is involved in a drugs incident to liaise first with
the education authority before police become involved. If a pupil was
caught dealing in school, police would be involved right away.
In Fife, head teachers have a fair degree of autonomy in interpreting
the guidelines laid down by the regional education authority.
Last month, five fifth-year girls from the 310-pupil school in Wester
Ross were suspended on suspicion of taking drugs in a classroom.
Highland Regional Council's education chairwoman, Val MacIver, was not
shocked by the incident. It was, she insisted at the time, a widespread
problem in all Highland schools: ''Pupils at Plockton are no different
from those in any other school in the Highlands, or indeed in any other
school in Scotland.''
The Plockton incident is understood to have involved cannabis, as did
the latest at Eton College, the public school where Prince William
started last month. So far this year drugs incidents at the school
include three boys arrested for possession of ecstasy outside a club,
the expulsion of a boy whose school uniform tailcoat had cannabis in it,
and another pupil caught trying to break into Windsor Castle who was
expelled after cannabis was found hidden in his sock.
In Scotland, a 12-year-old schoolboy was found dead at his Borders
home recently after being excluded from Peebles High amid allegations of
drug possession.
In September, three senior pupils at Loretto School in Musselburgh
were suspended after allegedly being caught sniffing crushed sleeping
pills at a school ceilidh.
Do such stories, then, give parents a distorted view of their
children's vulnerability to drugs and the level of their availability in
school?
''Marcia'' says she feels like Dickens's Mrs Jellybe, busy with
philanthropy while her own kids are tumbling downstairs. She is a drugs
counsellor. Earlier this year, her son was suspended from school for
having cannabis in his blazer pocket: ''In my work I tell parents not to
panic, that in most cases their kids are experimenting. When it happened
in our family, I went completely spare. I've calmed down a bit now. But
while I know that most kids experiment, or get caught up by peer
pressure, I suppose I thought somehow mine were diffent.
''I know most children won't become addicts, that they'll mature out
of the need to experiment. But it's easier knowing that with your head
than feeling it in your heart.''

BRITAIN'S youth ranks alongside the best in the world, Welsh Secretary
William Hague insisted yesterday.
As the conference put the spotlight on the younger generation, Mr
Hague told critics of teenagers: ''Don't run down the young people of
this country. One of the most sickening aspects of our national habit of
self-denigration is the running down of the potential and prospects of
British youth.
''Whenever I have seen our generation in this country compete in
business, sport, and the academic world, they are up there with the best
in the world.''
Mr Hague, at 34 the youngest Cabinet Minister of his generation, said
that for the first time since the 1930s the country was seeing a
generation which was not the natural ally of the political left.
''Our generation's beliefs are the same as our party's -- patriotism
without bigotry, public services without penal taxation, enterprise
without envy, being in Europe without being run by Europe.''
In a radical departure from the normal conference structure, the
Tories abandoned a formal debate on the young, with former Olympic
athlete and Tory MP Sebastian Coe introducing a series of young speakers
instead and going among the audience to speak to young party members.
One young person introduced by Mr Coe was university student Jason
Williams, of west Wales, who plans to be an Oxfam worker. He told the
conference: ''My family, under successive Conservative governments, have
given me a great start in life.
''And with the next Conservative Government, elected at the next
General Election, hundreds of thousands of young people will continue to
make our nation great.''
Mr David Mellor, from Portsmouth, said he and his brother had entered
the family manufacturing business 16 years ago. Then it had employed
only five people and their ambition was to take on a sixth.
''Today, thanks to changes brought by 16 years of Conservative
Government, our company now employs not six people but 300 and we are
still growing,'' he told cheering representatives.
The Government had not built the business, said Mr Mellor. ''We had to
work hard for ourselves. But what Conservatism did to give us the chance
to prosper, the will to succeed, the encouragement to believe in
ourselves.''

DO NOT go recklessly into this bad Friday. It is all very well for my
little braggadocio boy to skip under ladders and laugh as I wince, but
we beleaguered big ones must take greater care.
Nonsense beliefs and logic-defying strictures define our lives all the
time, so I cannot be so cavalier as to believe that my resistance to the
irrational will nullify any pagan curse I may incur.
Anyway, the gods can smell a fake swagger kilometres away (You see? I
said kilometres, not ''miles'' -- I am ready to submit to minor rulings
in the hope that I might get away with grander transgressions).
In the summer before I was married I told an Italian man that I
intended to go to Venice for my honeymoon, my luna di miele. (It sounds
better in Italian; more Puccini-and-passion, less
Pyrex-and-wedding-list.) He recoiled in rather graceful horror and told
me that such a choice would curse a marriage, so I went to Florence
instead, which turned out to be quite a bit lower down the bad-luck
league.
I don't think I will risk being more specific than that, but it has
since occurred to me that there might be a malevolent venue list for
Scottish honeymooning which has been lost to our consciousness, but
which still applies -- Saltcoats for soft-ons, perhaps, and maybe
bridegrooms should beware of Oban, where brides become bitches and bonk
turns to bicker.
And seemingly you must not sing at your own wedding. (Most especially
not in Venice, I suppose.) This seems a bit mean, since you can't get to
karaoke at your own funeral, and it would be a bit tasteless to start
rapping after wrapping it all up in the divorce court, which only leaves
you with the Baby Blues after giving birth, but those tend to be
snuffled rather than sung.
Also, you must never show your future husband your wedding dress
before the big day. That yellow sunshine-of-his-life dress could remind
him, in the cold light of an ordinary day, of sickening advocaat --
advocating inner warnings.
Superstitious adulterers have special problems. After the good, comes
the bad sticky moment when the cheater discovers she has her sweater on
inside out; she is racing down the road, later than her excuse has
merited, and she cannot dive up the nearest close to readjust label to
skin and seam to spine.
Bad luck to reverse your garb yourself, you see. She has just to go
back and get her lover to do the necessary, so she is even later and
like a Macbeth of lust, steeped even further into the inevitable bloody
mess.
Of course, actors will not say Macbeth out loud (it's ''Maccers'' or
the Scottish play.) I only know about theatre superstitions, but other
professions must have their equivalents. Perhaps butchers have to leap
into their walk-in fridges and turn around three times if someone says
''Linda McCartney''.
If you drop a glove you cannot pick it up yourself. Maybe this
explains those forlorn single gloves spiked on railings that you see,
woolly victims of the fearful and unpartnered.
And should you wish to stay partnered beware of ''splitting the
pole''. Couples should stay on the same side of lamposts and traffic
lights, and not divide, or they will end up literally going their
different ways.
But that fate might be OK. You might end up, after the end of the
affair, humming Nessun Dorma to yourself in the Piazza San Marco, your
sweater happily inside out, listening to a graceful Italian spinning you
a line with no basis in fact. And buona fortuna to you.
Astrologers are always insisting that their predictions are not to be
taken as unavoidable scenarios, with no opting-out on offer, but helpful
directives to guide us, like a personalised cosmic weather forecast. (A
bad rain's gonna fall, but you'll be fine if you don't forget your
brolly.)
So this Friday 13th I intend to stay home, tucked up in my bed, my
(closed) umbrella propped by my double Chubb-locked storm doors. And it
will not be fatalistic cowardice.
On the telly this week I saw Steven Sondheim telling Jeremy Isaacs how
he always wrote lying down, and I'm going to emulate my hero, positively
thinking on my propped-up pillow. Eschewing predetermination under my
downie. I might even write a song, and free spirit that I am, I shall
dedicate it to the gods.

The superstition is as alive and well today as it was with our
ancestors . . .
Joe Donnelly investigates the origins of the black Friday myth, the
people who live in fear of 13, events which seemed cursed by the number,
and those brave souls who have pushed their luck and defied the omens
TRISKAIDEKAPHOBIA. It's never going to catch on as a movie title, but
it's real and affects thousands of people. It's such a powerful fear
that many people just won't leave their homes today.
Triskaidekaphobia is the fear of the number 13. Today, Friday, the
phobia will be at its height, because mixing the day of the week and the
number seems to enhance the sense of impending doom.
It's a real fear, according to Thomas J Fernsler, an assistant
professor of education at Mansfield University in Pennsylvania. He
studies the superstition and actually gives talks across America on the
fear of the number 13.
''The superstition is as alive and well today as it was with our
ancestors. Watch and see how many people -- from friends to newscasters
-- bring it to your attention when it arrives,'' he says. Possibly he
would also include newspaper articles too.
Fernsler has researched the origins of the Friday 13th phobia. The
negative connotations of the number 13 date back to Nordic mythology.
But the combination of Friday and the number 13 seems to have originated
with Christ, whose last supper before his arrest seated 13 and who was
crucified on a Friday.
''Since then, when Friday is combined with the number 13 it is
supposed to portend a double dose of misfortune,'' Fernsler said.
Some superstitious folk will probably spend Friday 13th clutching a
rabbit's foot in one hand. The Irish might want a piece of lucky
shamrock in their hat, and a Scot might opt for white heather. Others
will feel safer with a sacred talisman like a St Christopher medal, or
even consider staying at home out of the way of the buses, or falling
rocks, or the meteorite that's sure to single them out for personal
misfortune.
Most will scoff, of course, and chance fate. But is that wise? For the
number 13 does seem to be the fellow traveller of misfortune and
disaster, or something close to it.
Yet number 13 might be perversely lucky for some, particularly Tom
Hanks who is enjoying further fame and fortune in his role as the
commander in Apollo 13. For the original crew, the number was anything
but lucky.
Apollo Lunar Mission 13 was aborted en route to the moon in 1970
because of an explosion of a fuel cell in the service module. The flight
left the launch pad at 13:13 hours and the accident occurred on April
13. The whole world watched, white-knuckled, as the crew faced death a
quarter of a million miles from home. It will not spoil the film to
explain that they made it back with minutes to spare.
Among the famous, President Franklin Roosevelt was as superstitious as
Nancy Reagan. He avoided leaving on trips on the 13th of the month. So
desperate was he to avoid calamity on the 13th that he stubbornly died
on April 12, 1945.
There's a rumour that the Queen, scheduled to depart on a train from
platform 13, had the number of the platform changed before boarding.
Such superstition didn't bother her great granny, Queen Victoria, who
was the first British monarch to travel by train -- and on the 13th too.
There are 13 witches in a coven and during the Salem witch trials in
1692, 13 women were executed for witchery.
The first person to die as the result of a car accident was a
67-year-old man who was struck while leaving a streetcar in New York on
September 13, 1899.
Triskaidekaphobics suggest that by adding the digits in the victim's
age, we find more evidence in the baneful total.
Each year has a minimum of one Friday 13th and a maximum of three. The
next year with three is 1998.
For some, however, 13 is considered a lucky number. At Colgate
University in New York, 13 is star-kissed because the college was
founded by 13 men with 13 dollars and 13 prayers to train young men for
the ministry.
The ancient Celts had no such superstition (though they were
superstitious about almost everything else) as they followed the lunar
cycle and had 13 months in their year, symbolically represented by 13
colours and 13 trees. Their thirteenth number, uath, represented chaos.
Thirteen was also in a baker's dozen, which ensured no-one got short
measure.
There are 13 cards in a suit. There are 13 weeks in a quarter, when
most of the big bills have to be paid. And as luck would have it, 13
traditionally is the number of large whisky measures in a bottle,
depending on who is pouring. At least it was until we went metric.
Thirteen was certainly unlucky for some. Wyatt Earp died on January
13, 1929, doubly unlucky in that nearly 70 years later he'd be portrayed
by Kevin Costner in an abysmally dull movie.
On the 13th day of the month, Catherine Howard, fifth wife of Henry
VIII was executed; the MacDonalds were massacred by the Campbells in
Glencoe; the SFA was formed in 1873; Nazi Germany invaded Austria,
sparking events which would lead to world war; the English got back the
Scottish Stone of Destiny (allegedly first borrowed from the Irish);
Ruth Ellis was the last woman to be hanged in Britain; and the last men
were hanged at Strangeways and Walton.
And lucky for others: Stephen Hendry, born in 1969; the SFA, formed in
1873; the first public striptease was performed in Paris; Stevie Wonder
was born in Saginaw, Michigan; the first cat show, including lucky black
ones, was held at Crystal Palace; the World Cup was instituted. Robert
Louis Stevenson was born in Edinburgh; the brassiere was patented; the
battle of the Somme ended.
On the thirteenth of this month, in 1925, a girl was born who was
destined to change the nature of British society for all time. Her name
was Margaret Roberts. She became Margaret Thatcher, first female Prime
Minister.
Weren't we all lucky? Weren't we?

WE ARE an old people, and we are set to get older. When I retire
(2019, as you ask) I will join the 18% of us who will then be over 65.
This is a lot of old folk, which is not itself a problem, but some great
difficulties follow -- a shrinking base of taxpayers, a growing demand
for health services, an increasing pensions bill.
As yet, Britain's old people have not become politicised. Unlike
Germany, and despite the best efforts of Jack Jones -- who was feared
when he was a trade union baron but is patronised now that he represents
the elderly -- we do not have a ''grey'' movement.
Because the elderly are more likely to turn out and vote than are the
young, the greys could have electoral clout greater than their presence
in the population but, as yet, aged voters are not scrutinising
competing political agendas to see which party offers them the best
prospects.
However, this does not mean that age will not be a factor in the
election. Though not a well-organised interest group, the elderly may
yet, in a roundabout way, have some bearing on the outcome of the next
election.
The political leadership of the Western world has recently passed to a
younger generation. After Reagan and Bush, the sax-toting Clinton. After
Foot and Kinnock, the guitar-playing Blair. Ireland has a President and
Prime Minister who are young enough to work in day-time TV and Francois
Mitterrand has followed the crumblies of Eastern European communism into
retirement.
Advertisers have only two stories: nostalgia and novelty. Products are
sold either with cloth caps and clogs or with chrome and shiny steel:
heritage or dynamism.
In any event, the long wait in opposition would have disposed the
Labour Party to sell itself as the novel alternative to 16 years of Tory
rule but the sudden death of John Smith (middle-aged, Presbyterian,
staid, traditional) and the elevation of the man the Tories tried to
ridicule as ''Bambi'' removed the heritage option.
On the sound principle of trying to have it both ways, Blair is keen
to claim that his policies embody either universal or traditional values
but his dominant motif is change: New Labour for a New Britain.
Quite how the Tories should and will respond is not clear. They have
already played the novelty card. They became ''new and improved'' when
they ditched Margaret Thatcher.
Portillo, Lilley, and Howard might want to present their philosophy as
radical and dynamic but we have had radical Toryism for so long that it
is old-hat. Yet the party has not sufficiently purged itself of
Thatcherism to return openly to the classic one-nation Toryism which is
defined by continuity and tradition.
Early in the summer John Major, worried that he seems lifeless
compared with his predecessor, promised us an unprecedented radical
review of Government policies. But his heart lies with the warm beer and
village-green cricket of the past and the heritage option may prove a
better way of holding the votes of the old.
To prove how well micro-economic theory could explain religious
behaviour, an economist from the University of Chicago explained the
well-known observation that people very rarely change faith late in life
-- in holding any set of beliefs, we invest ''human capital'': time,
effort, some of our personality.
The young have invested little in any belief system or set of values
and they have a long future in which to gain from their new investment.
The elderly have a lot invested in their present beliefs and values and
few years ahead of them in which to profit from a new portfolio.
The metaphor is a little clunking but we can see what he means.
Whether they are Conservative, old people are conservative. While many
elderly people might welcome a different approach to the management of
the economy or the NHS or the social service, the constant emphasis on
the newness of New Labour for the New Britain may form a subtly
discouraging backcloth to the specific policies, no matter how appealing
in their own right. It will probably not save them but demography seems
to be on the side of the Tories.

LABOUR'S plans for a minimum wage would amount to a cruel deception on
those on low incomes, President of the Board of Trade Ian Lang told Tory
conference delegates yesterday, (writes Benedict Brogan).
In a speech that earned him a standing ovation, the former Scottish
Secretary led the Government's attack on Labour's employment policies.
There was no painless way to help those on low wages, he said. ''I know
it might sound appealing to some. We all want to help people on low
incomes. But the pretence that there is an immediate, painless way to do
so, just by passing a law to say they must be paid more, is a cruel
deception.
''Imposing an artificial pay rise is the fastest and surest way to
detroy jobs. And it would be the low income jobs, the first rung on the
employment ladder, the very people Labour claim they want to help, they
would be the hardest hit. For many of them, it would be, instead of low
pay, no pay,'' he said.
A minimum wage was unfair, either to those who lost their jobs because
of it or to employers forced to pay higher wages. Labour had refused to
set a figure for a minimum wage because it knew it ''would cost this
country hundreds of thousands of jobs, with young people and the low
paid first in line for the chop''.
Evoking his shared background with the Labour leader, Mr Lang added:
''I have a candid, friendly, helpful message for Mr Blair, as one
Scottish ex-public school boy to another: play fair, be honest with the
electorate. If you're not prepared to show the price, don't put that
item on the menu.''
Mr Lang's other target was Labour's deal with BT, announced by Mr
Blair in his speech in Brighton last week, under which the company would
provide every school, hospital, and library in the country with a
computer link to the Internet in exchange for a relaxation of Government
anti-monopoly legislation.
He described the deal as a sham and a fraud, and claimed much of what
Labour was promising was already happening thanks to the Government's
initiative. Schools were being linked to the Internet at the rate of
almost 100 a week.
''And it's happening without the need for any attempt at shady
sweetheart deals behind closed doors that would allow one company
superhighway robbery,'' he said.
Mr Lang announced the creation of a network of Small Business
Ministers from all departments across Whitehall to co-ordinate
Government policy on small businesses. Scottish Office Industry Minister
George Kynoch already handles those responsibilities in Scotland.

Seamus Heaney was last to hear he had won the Nobel Prize for
Literature. He speaks to Hugh Barnes
THIS year's winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature was in sportive
mood yesterday as he celebrated his triumph amid a nationwide carnival
of verse. By happy accident the Irish poet Seamus Heaney chose the
much-hyped National Poetry Day to make his first public comment upon
winning the prestigious award.
His choice of venue was no less appropriate. On a balmy October day,
Seamus Famous, as he is known throughout Ireland, was holding court in
the London offices of Faber &amp; Faber, where a generation earlier T S
Eliot and W H Auden had both been published. Heaney is as much their
heir as the unquestioned successor to Yeats in Ireland.
Heaney is arguably the most celebrated poet in the English language,
the only possible competition being Ted Hughes or Derek Walcott. Now
aged 56, Heaney has become a globe-trotting international ambassador for
verse who divides his time between a home in Dublin and Harvard where he
is the Boylston Professor of Oratory and Rhetoric.
Nevertheless, he claims to have been utterly surprised by last week's
announcement from the Swedish Academy. ''My first reaction was
bewilderment,'' he told me yesterday, though he later admitted that any
reaction at all was long overdue. Heaney was on holiday in Greece last
week, and was therefore just about the last person on the planet to hear
of his Nobel triumph.
''I didn't hear about it until I phoned home last Friday afternoon
from a small hotel in the Peloponnese. My son Christopher answered and
the first thing he said was: 'Dad, I'm so proud,' he thought I knew. I
said: 'What about?' and then he told me.''
With his wild thatch of grey hair and undressy appearance, Heaney
retains the demeanor of a ploughman's son from County Derry. He first
caught the public attention 30 years ago when Death of a Naturalist was
published to instant acclaim.
Nine books have followed and the themes have amplified to take on the
grandest and humblest human predicaments: translations of Irish epics,
invocations of the ancient Greeks, and even, tentatively, and his
critics would say too lukewarmly, troubles in Ulster.
Heaney believes that the prize will give him an international platform
and opportunity to explain why poetry matters. But he also recognises
that the #600,000 prize money will give him other opportunities, other
freedoms, as a writer. He claims to have no idea what he will do with
the cash. ''Money is not an art of mine,'' he adds. ''I don't know. In
fact I don't think about it. It's the magic, it's the thunderbolt aspect
-- that's the real thing about the Nobel.''
I asked him why the English had a tendency to be rather snotty about
the prize. Was it sour grapes? ''Who knows? The role of the prize is
that it's an amplification system, not for the individual but for the
art form. It's a magic word. Nobel! It promotes good activity.'' Heaney
sighed. It had been a long day of discussing poetry.
A BBC reporter was pestering the Famous Seamus wanting to know if he
had cast a vote in the National Poetry Poll. But the ambassador of verse
was diplomatic as ever. ''I can't say what is my favourite poem by
another writer,'' he replied. ''I can't say whether I prefer the Odyssey
to the Devine Comedy. In the realm of art you really can't say the haiku
is smaller than the epic.''

LABOUR leader Tony Blair suffered a blow yesterday when one of his
senior MPs resigned his post.
Wakefield MP David Hinchliffe, 46, is returning to the back benches
after three years as Labour's spokesman on social services and community
care. He has made the move as he wants to spend more time in his
constituency and with his family.
His move is nowhere near as serious to Mr Blair as the defection of
former Minister Alan Howarth was to Mr Major, but it demonstrates that
there is some concern on the Labour benches.
Last month, Mr Kevin McNamara (Hull North) resigned from the Labour
front bench in protest at Northern Ireland policy and relations with the
unions.
Labour is well ahead in the opinion polls, but constituency boundary
changes mean that Mr Hinchliffe, with a majority of 6590, could face a
battle to hold on. He says that representing two extra wards in the new
constituency will ''involve a considerable amount of additional work and
effort''.
A Labour spokesman said the party had been aware of Mr Hinchliffe's
impending move for some time.
As soon as the boundary changes were finalised, Mr Hinchliffe had made
it clear that, because the new constituency was more marginal, he could
not afford to spend the time in London that his front bench duties
required.

Robbie Dinwoodie scans the Conservative conference crowd and discovers
few Tory youths have come along for the ride
THE Big One hasn't done much trade in Blackpool this week. You can
queue for more than an hour to ride on the world's biggest rollercoaster
but there hasn't been that level of demand with the Conservative
conference in town.
For in spite of yesterday's much-trumpeted youth debate, the
Conservative Party has a serious problem with its age profile. One
leading young Tory claimed yesterday that the average age of party
members was 62, at which stage most people have given up the thrills of
the fairground.
The perceived problem of ageing Tories is not new. There has been talk
for years of the ''greying'' of the party and its problems in attracting
young blood. But there is a new twist to the issue, for young
Conservatives themselves are at odds with the party leadership on how to
deal with the problem and claim they are now being deliberately squeezed
out of the picture at a time when Labour is pouring resources into its
youth wing.
Who would have thought a few years ago that at St Andrew's University,
that bastion of the right, the Labour Club would outstrip the
Conservative Club in membership, as it has now done? Both parties have
had their problems in the past with their youth and student wings.
Labour dismantled the Young Socialists and then rebuilt it as Young
Labour in an emphatically Blairite image, to the point where that
organisation's representative on the national executive council,
Catherine Taylor, actually led the education debate for the leadership
in Brighton last week.
The Young Tories however remain an anathema to Mr Major and a headache
to the party's spin doctors. The Prime Minister did not even attend the
Young Conservative ball at Blackpool this week -- a clear snub which
received its answer when deputy prime minister Michael Heseltine arrived
in his place to chants of ''Maggie, Maggie, Maggie''.
One of the media darlings of this week has been Justin Hinchcliffe,
the 14-year-old from London who had hoped to make his debut speech at
the conference. This eccentric youngster, the product of a one-parent
home which gets by on #85 a week in benefits, made good copy but there
was never any chance of the party letting him near the platform. It was
no surprise when he failed to catch the chairman's eye.
Another precocious youngster in his day, and now Welsh Secretary,
William Hague summed up the youth debate yesterday but got it wrong. He
made a personal attack on Taylor's speech of last week and then said
that the student generation which in his day featured ''wild-eyed
Marxist idealists and red-blooded militants'' were now Young
Conservatives. In fact he has skipped a generation, for it looks
increasingly as if that Tory flowering of student politics is giving way
to a new period during which it has become fashionable once more to be a
Labour supporter, whether or not that is seen as left wing.
But whereas Labour has rebuilt a youth movement to replace the one
which had become an embarrassment, the Conservatives have squeezed the
life out of their youth wing and put nothing in its place. They have not
fully cleaned their act up. For example, the current issue of the Young
Conservative newsletter carries a picture of two leading officials, one
of whom is carrying a baseball bat. The caption jokes about whether this
was an innovative new recruitment technique or a way of dealing with
opponents in internal YC elections.
However, one leading figure in the YCs claimed yesterday that they
were being deliberately marginalised in spite of having cleaned up their
act and they were bitterly disappointed with party headquarters.
''No matter how much emphasis you put on youth on the conference floor
-- and even that was outrageously stage-managed this morning with
unrepresentative hand-picked speakers -- you will get nowhere if you
don't fund the party machinery,'' the YC representative said.
Senior party figures insisted yesterday that there was no problem in
bringing young recruits into the Conservatives but the evidence is there
for television audiences to see -- an ageing party with a sprinkling of
young eccentrics, unsure of its ground when it discusses issues
affecting young people.

The Hague
MUSLIM survivors of Serb prison camps in Bosnia today told the UN war
crimes tribunal how neighbour turned on neighbour as peaceful
co-existence dissolved into a nightmare of killings.
''Things changed overnight. It was as if we had not lived together at
all, even though we had lived together for centuries,'' said Suad
Mahmutovic.
The 41-year-old witness appeared on the fourth day of hearings in The
Hague in the case of Bosnian Serb Dragan Nikolic. He commanded the
Susica camp in north-east Bosnia in 1992 and is accused of murder,
torture, and crimes against humanity.
Visibly distressed, the Muslim witness told the court how Nikolic, who
he had known for years, swaggered around the camp supervising the
systematic beating of selected prisoners.
''Prominent people were chosen. Rich, industrious people. They wanted
to liquidate the best Muslims,'' he said.
Echoing evidence from earlier witnesses, he recalled how Nikolic
taunted men who believed they were doomed.
At one point Nikolic had told them: ''I'll cut your throat with this
blunt bayonet and it will take days for you to die. All of you together
are not worth one bullet.''
One man, still terrified of his former tormentors, gave evidence from
behind a screen, becoming the first witness to invoke rules which allow
victims to give evidence anonymously.
0 Nikolic, 38, has remained at large in Serb-held territory in Bosnia
since he was charged in November last year with killings and torture at
the Susica camp, where up to 8000 Muslims were held.
Prosecutors allege that in the summer of 1992 Nikolic commanded the
camp, which was set up soon after rebel Serbs seized Vlasenica in
north-east Bosnia on April 21, 1992.
The tribunal cannot try suspects in their absence but the hearing is
expected to lead to an international warrant for Nikolic's arrest.
Victims said daily beatings at Susica reinforced a regime of terror
and many prisoners believed they would not get out alive.
Mahmutovic's younger brother Nurija told the court he was shown a list
of 100 people singled out by the Serbs for execution. ''I was on the
list,'' he said.
Fear mounted after a bus full of people drove past the camp, followed
by an earth mover, and later returned empty.
''A busload of our people left with a bulldozer. There were 40. They
were all killed,'' the 38-year old Muslim said.
Other prisoners told the court they had seen the bus and later heard
gunfire. When it drove back empty they also concluded there had been a
massacre.
The tribunal, created by the Security Council in 1993, is the first
international body for prosecuting war crimes since the Nuremberg and
Tokyo trials 50 years ago.
It has so far charged 43 suspected war criminals, including Bosnian
Serb leaders Radovan Karadzic and General Ratko Mladic, but has taken
custody of just one, a Bosnian Serb whose trial is expected to start
next month.--Reuter.

* THE Conservative Party is facing a crisis in its younger ranks, with
many leading figures in its youth wing boycotting yesterday's debate on
young people, claiming it was an unrepresentative carve-up.
Among those who did not attend the session was the chairman of West of
Scotland Young Conservatives, Richard Cook, who said the party had
failed to heed the advice earlier this year of Scottish vice-chairman
Annabel Goldie, who had said conferences should not be afraid to debate
issues.
He said: ''There is nothing wrong with strong and vigorous debate but
this week there has been no debate on anything that might lead to a
policy change. That is not freedom.''
He said that London headquarters had closed down their youth
department last year and although the situation was slightly better in
Scotland there was still big problems facing those in the Young
Conservatives. He said that three years ago they had been told by
Raymond Robertson, now Scottish Education Minister, that they were a
dying breed and had to help themselves, but their conferences had
continued to dwindle in size.
The youth wing of the party had effectively been stood down but no
resources had been put into rebuilding it. He said: ''If the young
people we do attract are right-wing then the leadership is just going to
have to accept that and say, so be it.''
He pointed out that the Labour Party were pouring resources into
rebuilding their youth section, and he gave an example of a recent media
interview for which he paid his own way to get to London while Labour
paid all the expenses of their representative. He said the consequences
of this rundown would be an inability to field candidates at future
elections. ''We shouldn't be scraping around to get 73,'' he said. ''We
should have at least 200 and be able to pick the best.''
One senior figure in the Young Conservatives pointed out that Labour
last year spent #150,000 on a youth membership drive which boosted their
total to 45,000. Meanwhile the Conservatives had reduced their resources
to one fifth of one member of staff at party headquarters. He also
accused the leadership of stage managing yesterday's debate and said
those called to speak had been hand-picked. ''To run down our youth
section is pure madness,'' he said.
''We have to ask the party chairman why he isn't investing in youth at
a time when the average age of party members is 62. There is going to
come a time when they are not going to be able to put in the word any
more.''
Party chairman Dr Brian Mawhinney later said that if only Young
Conservative office-bearers had been called to speak, the press would
have been quick to see that this was a carve-up. ''We value the Young
Conservatives as an important part of the party and they are already
there and contributing. I think we are doing all right.''

LEGAL authorities have halted criminal proceedings against the
satirical Kukly puppet show, the Russian equivalent of Spitting Image,
which pokes fun at President Boris Yeltsin and other political figures.
No reason was given.
Kukly, or ''dolls'', appears weekly on the independent NTV channel and
was accused of denigrating Yeltsin and his officials by portraying them
as poor tramps in a hovel on Russia's #6.20 monthly minimum wage.

Moscow
RUSSIA'S top prosecutor said today that at least 100 people with
criminal records were running for Parliament and he feared that
mafia-type gangsters could be elected.
Oleg Gaidanov, acting prosector general, told a news conference that
police were powerless to prevent people with a criminal past from
contesting the December 17 election to the State Duma lower house.
''Mafiosi of all ages and all types are trying to get in to power and
the interior ministry has already learned that about 100 of the people
who have already officially declared their candidacy have criminal
records,'' he said.
''We have the right only to provide information to the election
commission and the voters . . . having a criminal record is not an
obstacle to taking part in an election to local authorities or Russian
Parliament,'' he said.
Gaidanov gave no details of the election hopefuls who had criminal
records. He said, however, that they did not include anyone found guilty
of political crimes, meaning former political prisoners or dissidents in
Soviet times.
Gaidanov, who was appointed when President Boris Yeltsin sacked acting
prosecutor-general Aleksei Ilyushenko at the weekend, was voicing the
concerns of many Russians that criminals wanted to use Parliament as
protection against jail.
MPs enjoy immunity against criminal prosecution, meaning they can
literally get away with murder as long as they retain their seats.
''The next State Duma could be a congress of thieves-in-law,'' deputy
Stanislav Govorukhin told the Duma last week.
The Duma yesterday threw out moves to limit parliamentary immunity and
allow criminal cases to be opened against MPs.
''Once a deputy is elected, he must be free from all harassment,''
ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky said.
However several MPs have said they will keep pressing for changes and
last week the Duma set a precedent by expelling the member who operated
the MMM pyramid fund which swallowed up thousands of shareholders'
savings.
Sergei Mavrodi's credentials were removed on the grounds that he had
violated a law forbidding MPs to carry on business activities. He is now
expected to face prosecution.
MP Sergei Skorochkin escaped prosecution last year after he shot dead
a woman whom he said had been threatening him, and also killed a woman
passer-by.
However Skorochkin, who said at the time he had been attacked by the
local mafia for refusing to pay protection money, was himself shot dead
last February.
Gaidanov said Russia was doing all it could to clamp down on organised
crime but was hampered by a lack of funds.
He said he would ask the Finance Ministry to release more money to the
Interior Ministry and would urge Parliament to pass laws giving police
greater powers to tackle crime.

Pretoria
SOUTH African police today identified a man they suspect to be a
serial killer blamed for the deaths of about 40 black women in a wave of
killings that has terrorised the nation.
Police released a photo of Moses Sithole, 31, who they said used six
aliases. They appealed to the public to turn him over to the authorities
and not to inflict mob justice if they find the man suspected of raping
and strangling dozens of young women and dumping their half-naked bodies
near train stations, in open fields, or in mine dumps.
Sithole was the second man to be named as a suspect in the killings. A
previous suspect was shot dead last year by police, but officials said
they had probably killed in tandem over an 18-month period.
National Police Commissioner George Fivaz at a news conference urged
the public to remain calm if Sithole were found.
''Although I absolutely understand the anger of the community I must
make the strongest possible appeal to the community to stay calm and not
to take the law into their own hands should they be in a position to
apprehend the suspect.
''South Africa, especially the women of South Africa, must not be
denied the opportunity of having the mystery of the Gauteng serial
killings solved,'' he said.
The bodies of two more women were found this week in Johannesburg
suburbs, one at the Jupiter station in Germiston and the other at
Cleveland -- near mine dumps where the bodies of 11 black women were
found strangled last year.
Police were investigating the possibility that the two women were also
victims of the serial killer.
The US FBI Behavioural Science Unit's former chief Robert Ressler
visited recently and gave a psychological profile in the case,
indicating the possibility of more than one killer.
He said the killer was an upper-middle-class black man who visited
shebeens (illegal bars) and pubs, probably drove an expensive car, and
wore flashy clothes to lure his victims.
The Star newspaper reported it had received calls from a man claiming
to be the killer and who said he had killed 76 women.
Police said the caller had provided details about the killings not
publicly known and were not treating it as a hoax.--Reuter.

SINN Fein and the IRA were warned yesterday by Northern Ireland
Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew that unless the threat of renewed violence
was removed the inter-party peace negotiations on the future of the
Province would not start. He told the conference: ''No-one is going to
negotiate in a democracy upon their future if the shadow of the gunman
or the bomber falls across the table.''
However, he indicated that even a start on decommissioning weapons
would be enough to begin the process and reaffirmed that the British and
Irish governments are willing to invite an independent international
commission to advise them on how illegally held arms might best be
decommissioned.
Sinn Fein would be expected to commit itself in principle to
decommission arms and explosives ''progressively'' and join an agreement
on the best method of doing it.
The Ulster Secretary added: ''We seek no surrender by anyone, no
victory, and no defeat.
''Only the IRA use language of that kind. What we need to hear, and
what we use ourselves, is the language of trust and confidence.''
Sir Patrick said: ''If people who claim to be wholly committed to
peaceful methods are yet not prepared even to start getting rid of
illegal arms, which by their own account they not longer need, then how
can they expect others to have confidence that what they are claiming is
true?''
However, he he faced a series of conference speeches demanding that
the Government do nothing that would remove the province from the UK.
Mrs Barbara Finney (Conservative Political Centre), a former member of
the RUC, pleaded with Sir Patrick to resist republican calls for its
disbandment.
Denouncing the Government's framework document on the future of
Northern Ireland, she asked representatives from other parts of the UK
how they would like a permanent power-sharing government at Westminstr
with some members of that Government former terrorists and to have
foreign governments with more say in running the country than the
citizens themselves.
The Conservative Party in Northern Ireland expected a seat at the
round table talks on the future of the province if they ever began, she
said.
Sir Patrick's plea to Sinn Fein was backed by Mr Terry Martin
(Halifax) who said: ''People who believe in democracy have no need for
the gun and the bullet.''
Mr Connor Burns (Southampton) said: ''We should tell Gerry Adams is
not enough to lay down your arms -- give up your arms at once.''
While welcoming President Clinton's help he added: ''We will not allow
him to play politics in our country.'' This led Sir Patrick to make an
unscripted addition to his speech saying how gratified the Government
was to the President for the assistance he had given the peace process.

THE former head of protocol at Saddam Hussein's presidential palace
was paraded before the world's media in London today wearing a false
beard and dark glasses.
Husain Rashid Hassan, the latest in a growing line of Iraqi defectors,
is not viewed by British intelligence as having had access to the most
crucial details of Saddam's government or military machine.
However, as master of ceremonies at the palace as well as holder of
key diplomatic posts in France and Africa, he would have seen and heard
sensitive information.
His defection is yet another blow to Saddam, whose son-in-law and
close adviser Lieutenant General Kamal Hassan defected to Jordan in
August.
Saddam's regime was on the verge of collapse, he said, following the
defection of Kamal Hassan and recent uprisings within Iraq.
However he warned that Saddam still had plans to invade both Kuwait
and Saudi Arabia and was attempting to rebuild his army, seeking to buy
4000 Russian built tanks, and repairing all his existing weapons.
He revealed that Kuwaiti prisoners of war were still held in Iraq and
were being transferred from prison to prison to avoid detection by the
UN.
He said there were feuds between the members of Saddam's family and
disclosed that the Iraqi leader had shown a film of someone having his
hand broken as a warning to anyone of his family who considered stepping
out of line.
He concluded that Saddam personally was responsible for all the
weapons programmes highlighted in last night's UN report.

A WRITER will find out on Sunday at an awards ceremony in London if
she has won a literary prize.
Frances Mary Hendry took her publisher's advice and stopped basing her
books in Scotland and using local dialects, and it has paid dividends.
Hendry, of Rose Street, Nairn, has been short-listed for a Writers'
Guild Award in the best children's book category, the only Scot to make
the short list.
Her previous seven books were based in Scotland but India is the
backdrop for her novel Chandra, which has won widespread acclaim.
Hendry said: ''I used a lot of Scots dialect in my previous books
which did not go down well with publishers in England or America. They
said it was a turn-off for readers and strongly suggested that I should
stop using it.
''So I decided it was time for a change and fulfilled a childhood
dream by writing about the land where Rudyard Kipling wrote Kim -- my
favourite book of all time.''
The Scottish Arts Council gave Hendry a grant to spend two months in
India researching the book. It charts the story of an Indian child-bride
in an arranged marriage who is beaten, abused, and starved by her
husband's family because he died one week after the ceremony but before
the 11-year-old moved into his family's house.
Hendry started writing 10 years ago after she gave up teaching. She
runs a boarding house in Nairn and finds time to write during the long
winter months.
She said: ''I have not exactly made my fortune with my books but I
have made a small profit which is more than can be said for a lot of
authors. I am thrilled and delighted to have been nominated for this
award. It makes it all worthwhile.''

THE price of fresh orange juice could rise by as much as 25% because
of new rules from Brussels penalising imports of non-EU fruit, it was
claimed yesterday.
Manufacturers warned that the price of a litre of freshly squeezed
juice could go up from about #2.39 to more than #2.80 a litre and put
1000 British jobs at risk.
The European Commission is imposing a tariff, from December, on non-EU
fruit and vegetables, to prevent Continental farmers being undercut. The
tariff particularly hits British processors, who buy most of their
oranges from outside the European Union.
Although British processors can use Spanish oranges, they import
comparatively few of them each year because the right kind are not
available all year round.
EU Commission Regulation (EC) No 3223/94, which comes into force on
December 1, prevents processors buying imported oranges for less than
29p a kilo. They currently pay about 22p or less a kilo.
Four of the UK's main processors of freshly squeezed orange juice
processors have set up a liaison group to lobby against the imposition
of the tariff.
The group's spokesman, Mr Geoff Barker, technical director of east
London-based Johnson's Fresh Products, said: ''We are very, very
frightened by this tariff which is going to hit us very hard, especially
jobs.
''There is going to be an enormous hike in price. The whole irony is
that it comes at a time when we cannot buy Spanish fruit.''
Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg is to meet the EU's Agriculture
Commissioner, Franz Fischler, in Brussels on Monday to urge him to drop
the tariff.

A BANK employee sacked after police said he was to be charged with the
theft of more than #40,000 from the Clydesdale Bank's cash centre has
lost his unfair dismissal claim.
Mr Austen Campbell, of The Auld Road, Cumbernauld, said that he only
confessed to police in a taped interview as they told him what to say
and mentioned certain things that would happen to him if he went to
prison.
He admitted that he brought the money into the cash centre at the
bank's head office in Glasgow but claimed a colleague took
responsibility for it from then on.
He denied that he was involved in any theft and claimed his sacking
for gross misconduct was unfair.
A Glasgow industrial tribunal heard that a jury returned a not proven
verdict of following a criminal trial.
Mr Campbell had uplifted 12 containers from a Securicor van by
himself, contrary to the bank's standing instructions.
The next day management discovered a case containing #40,620 in
sterling and #2481 in foreign currency was missing.
An investigation was launched and police were called in. Bank
management were satisfied the money had arrived at the cash centre but
had since gone missing.
An audit investigation found that Mr Campbell had wilfully disregarded
procedures, deliberately provided false information in a loan
application, and had concealed his business activities. They concluded
his integrity must be doubted.
Mr Campbell was summoned to a disciplinary hearing and sacked for
gross misconduct but he was reinstated when he appealed and was given a
final written warning instead to remain on his file for 12 months. He
was also banned from applying for further personal loans for the next
three years and was to be transferred.
After his reinstatement, a customer complained, alleging that Mr
Campbell had cashed a cheque through his own account but had not
accounted to the customer for the cash. He was suspended pending further
investigation.
Around the same time police telephoned to say they were about to
charge Mr Campbell with theft of #40,620 and #2481 in foreign currency.
Police searched the cash centre and found #2000 worth of #10 notes
hidden in a bag in the ceiling above the men's toilets at the cash
centre. Police said Mr Campbell had admitted the theft and told them
where they would find the money.
Mr Campbell failed to attend the disciplinary meetings and was
eventually dismissed in his absence. He wrote asking that the decision
be suspended until the whole matter had been cleared up.
The tribunal was satisfied the bank had good reason to dismiss him and
ruled that his sacking was not unfair.

BENEDICT BROGAN describes how an impassioned speech urging a tougher
assault on Labour's devolution plans brought wide acclaim at the
conference
ENGLISH Tories at the conference yesterday heard an impassioned call
to defend the Union against Labour's devolutions plans -- from a single
mother who believes Scottish Ministers are not doing enough to alert the
country to its dangers.
Mrs Mary Scanlon is the Tory candidate in the Inverness, Nairn and
Lochaber seat held by Liberal Democrat MP Sir Russell Johnston, who is
retiring at the next election.
Her speech in the trade debate -- the only so far at the conference to
make more than a passing reference to Scotland -- was interrupted
repeatedly by full-throated applause from delegates, as she told them a
Scottish parliament with tax-raising powers would destroy the Union and
its three centuries of common history.
However, afterwards she expressed surprise that her theme had failed
to provoke a response from Mr Ian Lang, the Trade Secretary and former
Scottish Secretary, who spoke immediately after her. The ommission, she
suggested, was evidence of the need for Scots in Government to speak up
for the Union.
''He didn't mention Scotland and I had hoped he would acknowledge it.
I think that the Scottish Ministers in the Cabinet could do more. They
should make a noise about it. We are threatened within one year of a
Labour government with a Scottish parliament,'' she said.
In a clear warning that grassroots activists around the country expect
their leadership to lead from the front, she added: ''Scottish Ministers
have a responsibility, nationally, to tell everyone about it.''
She told representatives that a Scottish parliament would precipitate
the break-up of the UK. ''Nothing is more important than our country,
our nation, our United Kingdom as a sovereign nation-state in Europe. I
stand for the Conservative and Unionist Party, I stand for the United
Kingdom, and I hope you will too.''
Mrs Scanlon, 48, is an economics lecturer at Inverness College. Her
progression to parliamentary candidate was unconventional by Tory
standards. She was raised in Montrose, left school without
qualifications, and is a single mother with two grown-up children --
both Tories, she says.
She attended night classes in Dundee to complete her Highers and
studied economics and politics at Dundee University for her degree. She
became active in politics 10 years ago, and stood unsuccessfully for
Dundee District Council, which, she said, was once the summit of her
ambitions.
In 1992, she stood as Tory candidate in North-East Fife, and is
confident she stands a good chance in Inverness East. The constituency's
boundaries have been redrawn in the Tories' favour, she said.
''In four months of canvassing, I have met only one person who wants
devolution,'' she said. ''The people of the Highlands are fed up with
being represented by backbench Opposition MPs. They want a direct line
to Government.''
She was determined to speak at the conference, and would have tried to
be called in another debate if her name had not come up yesterday
morning. ''Because I think the English Tories need to be told about the
threat posed by Labour. I don't think the people of England realise the
urgency,'' she said.
Her appeal to the Union's common history, and the sacrifices of
Scotland's regiments in a succession of wars, drew the most applause.
''We are as Scottish as we'll ever be in the UK, and we'll be no more
Scottish in a disunited kingdom. We also know that under Labour we will
pay more tax, a tartan tax, three pence in the pound in the first year''
she said.

Washington
O J SIMPSON gave an interview, of sorts, to the New York Times today
in the aftermath of his television debacle.
He had agreed to an hour-long ''no-holds-barred' interview with NBC
television and backed out at the last moment, a retreat that has
confirmed in their beliefs those who think him a murderer.
Those who think him innocent, who are virtually all black, tend now to
rejoice that their hero has escaped the pillory, even though it was he
who suggested the interview in the first place.
Those who are sure of his guilt, mostly white people, are now asking
''so what's he got to hide?'', certain that they know the answer. The
network now has egg all over its screen.
As for the Times interview, Simpson called a reporter in New York to
assure him that he had pulled out of the TV show because his lawyers,
all nine of them, had argued against it. They said it would make it more
difficult for him to defend himself in the civil suits brought against
him by the families of the two murder victims.
He refused to answer the reporter's questions about the murder case.
He was now willing to meet battered women to talk about ''my
relationship''.
He blamed the media for misleading the American public about the facts
of the case, including details of the NBC interview imbroglio, and
insisted: ''I am an innocent man.'' He refused to believe the polls that
show 70% of Americans believed him guilty.
Mr Simpson told the Times he had not met his girlfriend, Paula
Barbieri, since his acquittal and had no plans to marry her. He said his
financial situation was excellent. ''I've still got my Ferrari, I've
still got my Bentley, my condo in New York.''
Simpson was a celebrity before his ex-wife was murdered but must now
adjust to being a celebrity of a different sort. He hoped to begin his
rehabilitation with the NBC interview but agreed to scrap it under
pressure from his lawyers.
One of them told a reporter they had conducted a mock interview,
asking him difficult questions, and concluded from his answers that the
programme would be a disaster.
Richard Nixon achieved a considerable level of public acceptance after
Watergate. That took him 20 years, of course, and Simpson may hope to
recover the public esteem in less time than that.
His first experience has not been happy. There are financial
considerations, too. No TV company would agree to set up a
''pay-per-view'' interview, which he had hoped to sell for millions.
However many cars he owns, he still has $3m in legal bills to pay,
with further huge sums due in the civil suits.
All is not lost, however. When he returned to his house after his
acquittal, the scene was caught by long-distance TV cameras and viewers
may have noticed a press photographer snapping away.
He represented the Star, a supermarket tabloid founded by Rupert
Murdoch but now owned by another newspaper chain. The paper had paid
lavishly for the right to record touching moments of OJ's freedom and we
will be able to see them in the next issue.

yesterday. The tremor, measuring 6.1 on the Richter scale, lasted only
seconds and was again centred in the west, but was felt in the capital,
sending frightened people rushing into the streets as skyscrapers
swayed.
Monday's 7.6-magnitude quake killed at least 54 people and injured 90,

Sydney
MEDIA baron Rupert Murdoch watched from a Sydney car park yesterday as
firefighters battled a blaze at the headquarters of his Australian
newspaper operations.
Flames shot more than 9ft from the top of the five-storey building and
black smoke billowed over the city as Mr Murdoch arrived for lunch.
Surrounded by more than 1000 News Corporation staff evacuated from the
building moments earlier, Mr Murdoch watched for 10 to 15 minutes as
firefighters swarmed on the headquarters for some of his biggest-selling
Australian titles.
The building houses the offices of the newspapers published by Mr
Murdoch's News Limited subsidiary -- the Australian, the Daily Telegraph
Mirror, the Sunday Telegraph and the Sportsman newspapers.
''He waited around to make sure everyone was safe,'' said Malcolm
Noad, manager of the group's operations in Sydney.
''He could see that everything was under control so he was as relaxed
as you could be under the circumstances.''
No-one was injured. The blaze was thought to have started in the
basement and shot up to the roof via air-conditioning ducts,
firefighters said. It caused no damage to the main floors of the
building.
Staff and senior executives returned to the building after three
hours. Mr Noad said he was confident tomorrow's newspapers would hit the
streets as usual.
''You would have to say we may run a bit late tonight but we will have
the papers out,'' he said.
Firefighters said they did not yet know the cause of the fire but said
workers might have been using blow torches in the basement when it
started.
Police said there were no suspicious circumstances.
* Prime Minister Paul Keating hit back today at Murdoch's criticisms
of the Australian economy, challenging the tycoon to do more for
Australian youth.
Murdoch, speaking months before a General Election in the country
where he dominates the media, said he thought the economy was a
disgrace.
Keating said News Corp had done well from the Australian economy
lately, and pressed Murdoch to join a government scheme that subsidises
companies for employing young workers without skills.--Reuter.

Bonn
GERMAN politicians decided today to launch an inquiry into allegations
that Steffi Graf was given too much special treatment by her regional
tax authorities.
The parliament of the regional state, Baden-Wuerttemberg, where the
tennis star's tax affairs are being investigated, voted to form a
committee to look into the state's role in the matter, which has been
front-page news for months.
Miss Graf's father was jailed in August to prevent him fleeing or
concealing evidence to support accusations that he and his daughter
evaded millions of marks in tax. Miss Graf was questioned by public
prosecutors last week.
Parliament is investigating the affair since the Graf family says it
struck a deal with the state's tax authorities in 1993, agreeing on
their tax liability.
The Wimbledon champion, who added the US Open to her array of Grand
Slam titles last month, broke down in tears when questioned about the
difficulties of visiting her father in jail after the New York
final.--Reuter.

Baghdad
Iraq today accused chief UN arms inspector Rolf Ekeus of lying and dug
in for an extended period of economic sanctions.
A critical report by Ekeus on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction also
boded ill for food prices and weighed on the Iraqi dinar as traders
realised there was little hope that the United Nations would soon lift
the trade embargo imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
Iraqi Vice President Taha Mohieddin Ma'rouf, dressed in the green
fatigue uniform of the ruling Baath Party, reacted to the Ekeus report
at a ceremony commemorating 100 children killed by an Iranian missile in
1987.
''He's lying. He is a big liar. On one page he says Iraq is being very
helpful and co-operating with the committee, on another he says Iraq is
keeping secrets. There's contradiction in his words,'' he said.
Ekeus, head of the UN special commission set up to dismantle Iraq's
most dangerous weapons, submitted the report in New York yesterday. It
is crucial to the future of the sanctions.
Ekeus said Iraq had gravely misled his inspectors and developed far
more powerful weapons than previously thought.
In fact Saddam's biological warfare programme had developed enough
germs to kill the world's population many times over.
Iraq tested germs on sheep, donkeys, monkeys, and dogs, and may still
be hiding missiles that could reach targets thousands of miles away,
Ekeus's report said.
Baghdad had also produced more chemical weapons than previously
admitted, he said.
Some Security Council diplomats want Ekeus to show a video he obtained
of biological agents used on a dog, which was described as ''horrific''.
''Iraq's efforts to conceal its biological weapons programme, its
chemical missile warhead flight tests, and work on the development of a
missile for the delivery of a nuclear device led it to provide incorrect
information,'' Ekeus said.
He also revealed that Iraq was capable of producing the advanced nerve
agent VX. Germ warfare preparations included munitions production of
concentrated toxins containing botulism and anthrax.
By mid-morning news of the report had reached Jamila, the commercial
hub of Baghdad, where the future of sanctions is one of the biggest
factors in price fluctuations.
''Ekeus is the barometer of prices here. I'm afraid this time his
report will have a damaging effect,'' said a trader.
The dinar fell again today, to 2600 against the US dollar from about
2500 yesterday, and traders said they expected prices to follow suit
shortly.
The price of 30 eggs has jumped to about 4000 dinars from 3000 last
month and 2.2lb of lentils, the poor man's diet in Iraq, sold for 1100,
compared with 750 in the summer.
UN agencies say that between 22 and 30% of children are badly
malnourished.
However Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, the main target of the
sanctions, shows no signs of losing his grip on power.
On Sunday Iraqis are expected to vote ''yes'' in the first referendum
on whether he should be president.
At the ceremony attended by Ma'rouf this morning, schoolchildren sang
Saddam's praises and the speakers punched home the message that
endorsing Saddam was the right answer to foreign critics of the
government.--Reuter.

A MAN who stabbed to death his former lover may have suffered at the
hands of a woman with ''malicious divorced mother syndrome'', a court
heard yesterday.
A forensic psychologist told the High Court in Glasgow the resultant
depression could have driven Steven McGowan to kill nursing sister Irene
Duffy.
Mr McGowan, 30, of Meadowburn, Bishobriggs, has admitted he stabbed Ms
Duffy, 32, in ward 2A of Glasgow's Stobhill Hospital on June 16 last
year. However, he denies that it was murder.
Professor David Cook, 43, said Ms Duffy was probably suffering from
the syndrome which made her ''hostile and aggressive'' towards Mr
McGowan after they separated and began a legal battle over access of
their three-year-old son.
Professor Cook said that Mr McGowan's parents told him that on the
night he killed Ms Duffy the accused was like a ''zombie'' and had been
complaining about not receiving a birthday present or card from his son,
Christopher.
The professor said he had given Mr McGowan a ''psychological lie
detector test'' and did not think he had been trying to fake his
symptoms.
Mr Ronald Clancy, prosecuting, asked: ''Could it simply not be that he
was angry and hated her?'' He replied: ''Yes.''
Dr Margaret Smith, a 72-year-old forensic psychiatrist, told the court
that there were sufficient grounds for a plea to culpable homicide
rather than murder due to Mr McGowan's diminished responsibility.
Dr Smith was called to give evidence for Mr McGowan's defence about
the state of his mind the night he plunged a hunting knife into Ms
Duffy.
She said he was suffering from reactive depression caused by the
breakdown of his relationship with Ms Duffy.
At the time he killed her his depression had increased in severity and
intensity.
Dr Smith said Mr McGowan told her of his difficulties in getting
access to his son and his parents claimed to her he only saw him at Ms
Duffy's whim.
In the three weeks before the killing things were getting worse and Mr
McGowan wasn't sleeping, didn't eat or change his clothes, and cried a
lot.
It was a nightmare, he said, and he told her he was going to plead
guilty. She said his emotional stress was of such severity that he was
unable to cope with or control his impulses.
Dr Ronald Gray, 37, of Glasgow's Parkhead Hospital, said he told her
that before the killing he was ''broken, full of guilt, anger, and
sadness'' and trying to deny how he felt.
On his birthday, three days before the killing, he didn't get a card
or a present from Christopher. The day he killed Ms Duffy, Christoper
phoned him to say ''Hello dad'' then the telephone rang off.
Dr Gray said Mr McGowan remembered nothing of the incident until he
found Ms Duffy covered in blood at his feet and he was holding a knife.
Dr Gray said Mr McGowan was suffering from a full-blown depressive
illness which diminished his responsibility.
It had been brought on by difficulty over access to Christopher and
the ensuing conflict fuelled the situation.
Mr McGowan's father, Mr Francis McGowan, 55, told how his son's mental
state degenerated.
When asked if he was surprised he had killed Ms Duffy, he replied: ''I
would have been less surprised if he had killed himself.''
Mr McGowan's next door neighbour, Mr John McVey, said on the night Mr
McGowan left home to kill Ms Duffy he feared he was going to kill
himself in a nearby canal.
The court heard Mr McGowan did have access to his son, three days a
week and every alternate weekend.
The trial, before Lord Hamilton, is expected to end today.

VIENNA: Austria faced a snap General Election after the collapse of
its coalition government over economic policy, in one of Vienna's most
dramatic post-war political crises.
Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, leader of the dominant Social Democratic
Party (SPOe) and chancellor since 1986, conceded he could no longer
oppose early elections after budget talks with his coalition allies, the
People's Party, had broken down irretrievably.
He said the likeliest date for the poll was December 17, nearly three
years earlier than scheduled.
The election could transform Austria's political landscape, if gains
in popularity for the far right are translated into votes. About 28% of
voters, a record high, say they back the anti-immigration policies of
Joerg Haider's Freedom Party.--Reuter.

THE trial heard yesterdaythat on separate occasions both Mrs West and
her husband had attended an outpatients' department in hospital with
flesh wounds.
In his opening address, Mr Brian Levenson, QC, prosecuting, linked Mr
West's injury with the murder of Lucy Paddington. Her body, like many
others, had been dismembered and a sharp knife discovered with her
remains.
Yesterday, in an admission read in court it was agreed Mrs West was
also admitted to a hospital in Gloucester at 10.55pm on August 13, 1974,
some months later.
She had a deep laceration to the ring finger on her right hand and
said it was caused by playing with knives.
The injury required surgery and Mrs West was detained for two days. On
admission to the ward, the reason recorded for the laceration was
''cutting wood''.

THE last time various alleged murder victims were seen alive were
described yesterday in poignant evidence read out at Winchester Crown
Court.
One young man spoke of kissing and cuddling his girlfriend, having
made up after a tiff, and a final wave as her bus pulled out.
A handicapped girl also described waving goodbye to her best friend
who was leaving to catch a bus home -- a letter of application to join
an arts course in London in her hand.
Andrew Jones, in a statement he made in November 1973, described his
last meetings with his girlfriend of three weeks, Carol Ann Cooper, who
disappeared aged 15.
A group of friends had a day out in Worcester on a Saturday in 1973.
Shortly before seeing Carol to her bus, she had become a bit niggly
but it did not develop into an argument.''She put her arms around me and
wanted me to kiss her,'' he said. He, however, was still feeling niggly
and refused.
He saw her crying, but before her bus arrived they had made up. He
gave her enough money for her bus fare and 10 cigarettes.
She kissed him before boarding. He saw her go to a seat. She turned
round and waved as the bus moved off and that was the last time he saw
her.
Helen Wender made her statement on January 1, 1974, after her best
friend Lucy Partington, 21, a student at Exeter University, disappeared.
Helen had been handicapped since birth and was more or less confined
to a wheelchair.
She described how, on December 27, 1973, Lucy had visited her at her
home.
She arrived after 8pm and watched television, before Lucy wrote her
letter of application to the Courthauld Institute in London.
At 10.15pm Lucy left to catch the last bus home to Gretton. Near the
bus stop there was a letter box, and Helen assumed Lucy would be posting
the letter there.
''I would have expected her to return to the house if she had missed
her bus and my father would have driven her home,'' said Helen in her
statement. This had happened before.
Another statement from Mrs Edith Simmons, made in April 15, 1994, was
also read to court.
Mrs Simmons, who had lived in the UK for 35 years, held Swiss and UK
dual nationality.
She became friendly with Therese Siegenthaler, a young Swiss girl who
was studying at the then Woolwich Polytechnic.
Mrs Simmons described how 21-year-old Therese was intelligent and
self-assured, with an open nature, and was skilled in judo.
She felt, however, that Therese was not used to large cities and could
have been over-confident of her physical skills.
At Easter 1974, Therese stayed overnight at her home in London before
leaving on a planned visit to Ireland to meet a priest. Therese intended
catching a ferry from Holyhead.
They arranged a night out at the theatre on her return.
Mrs Simmons said she was surprised when she did not receive a postcard
from Ireland.
In the event, Therese did not come back to go to the theatre, even
though she had paid for a ticket.

SCOTTISH Office Ministers are to call Conservative councillors to a
meeting in Edinburgh later this month to report on the number of
executive posts and committees their local authorities are setting up.
Stung by criticism that their local government reorganisation will
result in rising costs, Ministers plan to fight back.
Already, they are comparing the number of committees being considered
as necessary by councils like Aberdeen and Dundee, when others such as
Dumfries and Galloway and Borders, which will have the same
responsibilities, are making do with fewer. They also believe that some
councils will appoint many more top executives than others.
The Ministers are inviting Tory councillors to provide them with more
information which could enable them to put the blame for rising costs on
the ruling local parties.

A DEFENCE Ministry contract for the construction of three
nuclear-powered submarines for the Royal Navy has run into a competitive
tendering wrangle.
The two bids for the work are from separate parts of the same firm.
Under the MoD's value-for-money policy, bids were sought on a prime
contract competition basis. Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering Ltd and
a rival consortium formed by GEC-Marconi tendered for the design,
building, and through-life support of the boats.
However, VSEL was then taken over by GEC and the MoD found itself with
two proposals from the same stable. Both are also believed to be above
the ceiling price.
The three new boats are intended to replace five ageing
Swiftsure-class submarines from 2004 onwards. If cash can be found,
there is an option on a further two.
A Defence Ministry spokeswoman said last night: ''Although the bids
are ostensibly from the same company, they are radically different. The
design teams are operating separately from different parts of the
country. It is still a contest of sorts.''
The Navy wants a selection made by the end of the year, with
construction beginning in June next year.
The solution may be a compromise by merging the best features from
each design.
The bad news for the Navy and GEC is the MoD would then be forced to
institute a ''no acceptable price, no contract'' system which would
delay the work and could involve downgrading the submarines'
capabilities to bring them within budget.

SHORTLY before she vanished, a young girl expecting Frederick West's
child was doing her utmost to keep out of his and Rosemary West's way,
Winchester Crown Court heard yesterday.
Mrs Elizabeth Brewer, a lodger in 1977 at 25 Cromwell Street,
Gloucester, described how her friend, Shirley Robinson, also living in
the house, was anxious to stay clear of the Wests. Shirley Robinson has
not been seen since May, 1978, when she was 18.
The court has heard it was common knowledge at the time that Shirley
was heavily pregnant and was expecting Frederick West's baby. Mrs West
was pregnant at the same time.
Mrs Brewer described yesterday how she used her room as a bedsit, but
Shirley seemed to be more a part of the West family and used her room as
a normal bedroom.
There was also a room in the house known as ''Rosemary's special
bedroom'', across from the bedroom the Wests shared.
Mrs Brewer described how in May 1978 there seemed to be a breakdown in
communication between Shirley and the Wests. ''Mr West would tell me
Shirley was becoming too possessive towards him,'' the witness said.
For her part, Shirley asked Mrs Brewer, who was at that time the same
age, if she could live in her room. ''Shirley expressed how she needed
to keep away from Mr and Mrs West,'' said Mrs Brewer.
''She spent all of her time thereafter in my room. There was a single
bed there, which Shirley slept on. I used the couch.''
The witness told the court that Shirley vanished one day.
Mrs Brewer said that when she first arrived at 25 Cromwell Street, the
Wests were very friendly and very generous, but used to embarrass her by
talking a lot about their open marriage and sex life. Rosemary had her
boyfriends and Frederick his girlfriends.
On one occasion Mrs West had told her that, when she retired, she
intended to spend her whole retirement indulging in sexual activity.
''She was going to spend all her time having sex,'' said the witness.
On one occasion she had seen Mr West and Shirley kissing and cuddling.
On another she was discussing a marriage break-up with Mrs West when Mrs
West told her that, no matter what her husband did, she would never
leave him.
Despite this, she described a major disagreement between the Wests
early one morning.
Mrs Brewer told the court that Shirley had stayed in her room for one
or two weeks. She identified photographs of her and Shirley taken at a
photo booth in Woolworths. The dates on the back were May 9, 1978, and
May 8, 1978.
The court heard yesterday that Mrs West had regular sex sessions with
young male lodgers who lived at 25 Cromwell Street in the early
seventies.
On one occasion, it was alleged, she went to bed with two young men on
the very evening they had arrived at her house.
Mr Ben Stanniland told the jury of eight men and four women that he
was 18 when he rented a bedsit with a friend at 25 Cromwell Street in
1972.
Asked about his relationship with Mr West, he said: ''It was fairly
good at the time. I got on well with him.
Asked about his relationship with Mrs West, he replied: ''The same.''
He added: ''On the night we moved in, Mrs West came upstairs and got
into bed with me and Alan Davies. Mr West was downstairs at the time.''
Asked if Mr West knew what was going on upstairs, the witness replied:
''Obviously.''
He added: ''In the morning obviously I was dubious about going
downstairs, but he made it obvious it was OK.''
Thereafter the two young men socialised with the Wests in a local pub.
Afterwards, when they returned to Cromwell Street for a cup of coffee,
discussion often centred around sexual innuendo.
The witness said that among the many girls he took to Cromwell Street
was Lynda Gough, one of the 10 young girls or women Rosemary West is
accused of murdering. She pleads not guilty to the charges.
Mr Stanniland said he had sex in the house with Lynda, who was 19 when
she disappeared. When he broke up with her, she continued to visit the
house, and he knew she had sex there with some of his friends. He also
believed she did some baby-sitting for the Wests.
He also agreed that he had sex with Caroline Owens, who had been hired
as a nanny by the Wests, before she was abducted by them and bound,
gagged and sexually assaulted by them. The Wests were fined in
connection with this incident.
Mr Stanniland said that Frederick West, who was a builder, was always
carrying out do-it-yourself jobs in the house. He was making alterations
to the basement area.
Another lodger, Mr David Evans, said he moved to the house in 1972,
when he was 23. Asked about Mrs West, he said: ''She was the landlady
but she also came upstairs regularly to have sex.''
This witness, too, had met Lynda Gough at the house and had had a
sexual relationship with her. He recalled an occasion when Rosemary West
one morning came up to his room and sat on his bed.
''She said Lynda Gough had hit her daughter while baby-sitting and
would not be coming back again.''
Mr Evans said he had accepted this explanation as to why she was no
longer around the house.
He agreed that police had visited 25 Cromwell Street on three
occasions, searching for drugs. He said he was fined for being in
possession of cannabis. In all, he had seven or eight convictions for
this offence, the last being two-and-a-half-years ago.
A third lodger, Mr Charles Jones, recalled going to the living room to
pay his rent when he came across something of a surprise. Two semi-naked
women were in the room, one of them Rosemary West.
Another lodger, Mr Terence Davies, also described the incident. Asked
if there was anything unusual about Mrs West's appearance, he said:
''She was wearing a negligee you could see through, if you call that
unusual. Apart from that, nothing much.''
The trial continues.

CHANCELLOR of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke offered hope but no more,
of an election-winning tax cutting Budget next month when he addressed
the Conservative Party conference at Blackpool yesterday.
On a day of unfavourable figures on inflation and on negative equity
for home-owners, his broadest hint of a tax cut came when he said: ''It
will be a Budget I'm looking forward to a lot more than the last two.''
However, he cautioned: ''Cutting the tax we want to cut can't all be
done in one go. It must not be done thoughtlessly and it must be the
start of a process continuing into the future.
''We will only cut taxes when it is in the interest of the British
economy to do so,'' and he promised ''When we cut taxes it will last.
When we cut taxes it will be for keeps.''
He told the conference he recognised that many party workers felt the
time had come for some reward in the next Budget. ''In the immortal
words of Francis Urquhart in The House of Cards -- you may think that
but I couldn't possibly comment.''
The only thing clear even now is that the Chancellor will be unable to
satisfy all the demands made by conference speakers during the economic
debate who called for wide-ranging reductions in both direct and
indirect taxes.
Mr Clarke promised his Budget would be ''based upon traditional Tory
values'' and would address Middle England, Middle Wales, Middle
Scotland, and Middle Ulster.
The call for big tax cuts was headed by Mr John Godfrey, the
unsuccessful Tory candidate in the recent Perth and Kinross by-election
and now the prospective candidate, who called for ''a real reduction in
the overall burden of tax, direct and indirect''.
He warned the Chancellor against taking a penny or two off the basic
rate of income tax only to take it back on tax allowances and VAT.
Mr Clarke told the representatives: ''When I go to work each morning
in the Treasury I think of ways to work towards our goal of reducing tax
on hard work, saving and enterprise.''
He repeated the Prime Minister's aspiration to double living standards
in Britain over the next 25 years and patted himself on the back for
making the right decision not to raise interest rates though he said the
rate would go up if he found it necessary to meet his inflation target.
Mr Clarke claimed: ''Tony Blair is the leader of a party that he
despises. He despises Labour's traditions. He hates its principles. He
actively dislikes a very large number of its members. But real Labour
will eventually have their revenge on Mr Blair.''
It also would have its revenge on the country, said Mr Clarke, in the
shape of high taxes, unemployment and inflation and an economy in deep
recession.
Opening the debate Mr Godfrey urged the Chancellor not to rule out a
windfall tax on the privatised utilities -- ''A further privatisation
dividend, payable to all of us this time.''
Mr Godfrey told the Chancellor: ''This party wants and expects a
reduction in tax.'' Among those who should be helped were home owners,
two parent families, savers, insurers against redundancy, ill health and
old age costs, those who wanted to start a small business or leave money
to the next generation.
The Chancellor also heard a strong warning against joining a European
single currency from Mr Nick Archer (Battersea), who said: ''Not now,
not tomorrow, not in 10 years time, not ever.''
Mr Edward Russell (South Shields) was applauded when he called for the
restoration of mortgage tax relief to at least 20%.
* The Chancellor succumbed to political correctness for fear of
offending the Scottish vote during his speech. A sentence in his text
said: ''That's why Gordon Brown looks as cheerful as any Scotsman ever
does when he's left footing the bill.'' However, when he reached the
sentence Mr Clarke decided to omit the reference to the Scots.

HOME Secretary Michael Howard put tough law-and-order measures at the
top of the Government's General Election agenda yesterday, by promising
to send a powerful message to criminals: ''if you don't want the time,
don't do the crime''.
To the cheers of Tory representatives, Mr Howard unveiled a package of
sentencing reforms that would abolish automatic remission, and impose
automatic life sentences and minimum sentences for a variety of violent
and sexual crimes. Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth announced similar
measures for Scotland.
They will be submitted for consultation, and a Government White Paper
will be published early next year, Mr Howard said. '''No more automatic
early release. No more release regardless of behaviour. And no more
half-time sentences for full-time crimes,'' Mr Howard said.
His speech was designed to satisfy the clamour among Tory activists
for radical measures to stem what they perceive as a runaway crime rate
and a too lenient judicial system. Automatic remission from prison
sentences was wrong, Mr Howard said: ''It makes a mockery of the Courts.
It sends the wrong signals to criminals. And it outrages the victims.''
Mr Howard delighted the conference with his robustly populist line on
criminals. However, on other issues he struck a conciliatory tone, and
failed to live up to his critics' expectations of a potentially
explosive attack on immigration. Instead he warned there was no room for
racism in the Tory Party.
To the victims of racial violence, he said: ''This country has an
honourable tradition of racial harmony. I am determined to do all I can
to maintain it.''
He added: ''There must be no quarter, no hiding place, and no mercy
for those who make the lives of other British citizens a misery because
of the colour of their skin. They must be caught, tried, and punished.
There will never be room for racists in this party of ours.''
He added: ''Good race relations and firm immigration control go hand
in hand. One thing should be understood. Nothing we do to control
immigration will be racist.''
In addition to his sentencing reforms, Mr Howard announced the
creation of a new Crime Prevention Agency, to help police, business and
local communities to tackle burglary and other crime.
The details of the proposals he announced include:
* No remission for prisoners serving less than 12 months. They would
serve thir sentence in full.
* An automatic life sentence for those twice convicted of a violent or
sexual crime that currently carries a maximum sentence of life
imprisonement.
* Repeat offenders, particularly those convicted of burglary or drug
dealing at least three times, would face stiffer sentences.
Mr Phil Gallie, MP for Ayr, said Mr Howard's speech was ''fabulous''.
The MP recalled that two years ago he had taken a lone stand in a
Commons committee on the Criminal Proceedings Bill which cut sentences
of under four years in prison by 50% automatically.
''What the Home Secretary has now done,'' he said, ''is exactly what I
called for. I can hardly wait to get back to Westminster to start
tearing up that earlier Bill.

LABOUR yesterday attacked the Government over its record on fireworks
safety as statistics showed the number of injuries increased by 50% in
1994 and were now at a 25-year high.
Shadow Consumer Minister Nigel Griffiths claimed that the dramatic
rise in injuries was a direct result of the Conservatives' drive to cut
red tape.
The increase, he claimed, coincided with the removal of import
controls on fireworks, allowing bangers with 20 times the power of
British ones to enter the country.
But the Department of Trade and Industry denied his allegations,
saying a large part of the problem was a big increase in the number of
fireworks sold. A spokeswoman added that many of the injuries were
avoidable and that people were becoming complacent when handling
fireworks.
Figures initially released by the Campaign for Firework Reform showed
that two died during October and November last year and more than 1570
were injured. This compared with an injury total of 1058 in 1993 -- up
from 805 in 1990.
''Instead of maintaining tough import controls, Ministers in the DTI
have pandered to pressure from Europe, where far more dangerous
fireworks are permitted and the injury rate is two and three times the
UK rate,'' said Mr Griffiths.
He also claimed that as part of their deregulation campaign, Ministers
had stripped councils of the right to investigate shopkeepers who sell
fireworks to children. He said that the Government had used the
Deregulation Act to abolish council powers.
However, Mr Ian Hillier, Strathclyde region's principal trading
standards officer responsible for safety, denied this was an exact
representation of the situation.
In repealing the Fireworks (Safety) Regulations of 1986 in March of
this year, the Government had left in place the 1875 Fireworks Act,
which has a similar legal effect. Regional councils had traditionally
interpreted this act in different ways, said Mr Hillier.
Some, like Fife, had always handed the powers for dealing with
fireworks sales to under-16s to both their trading standards department
and the police. Others, like Strathclyde, had empowered only the police
to act under the 1875 Act.
He advised the public to buy only fireworks marked with the British
Standard BS7114, and not to use fireworks in their gardens that were
clearly meant for use in larger venues.

''BRING out the grannies,'' shouted a gentleman from the North of
England during the law-and-order debate.
Despite a hard upbringing, he told us, he had never been in danger of
becoming a juvenile delinquent because he knew his granny would give him
what for if he did.
This idea had not occurred to Mr Michael Howard, the Home Secretary,
last year when he produced 27 new methods of fighting crime and he did
not take it up this year either.
However, in fact, the Tories did bring out the third most famous
British granny. Lady Thatcher in electric blue looked quite capable of
going to the podium and socking it to them as in the increasingly remote
eighties, but contented herself with smiling acknowledgement.
The prospect of a Thatcherite restoration having now become as remote
as the return of the Bourbons to the throne of St Louis, almost all
sections of the party were able to unite in applauding someone who is,
after all, a historic figure however you interpret history.
Mr Heseltine did so in such a languid manner that he looked as if he
had been filmed in slow motion. Even he, though, was positively
rapturous compared with Sir Leon Brittan who laid one hand against the
other then became preoccupied with studying his fingernails.
Desperate to counter the allegation that they are becoming a party of
grannies (and grandads) the Tories broke up the morning's debate with a
''Spotlight on Youth'' session in which Sebastian Coe, runner and highly
marginal MP, interviewed some reasonably young people about why they
were Conservatives.
Several were over the 20 mark but ''yoof'' is perhaps a moveable
feast.
The Chancellor, with the Budget next month, had to make a speech of a
rumbusious Trappist monk. It was energetic but said nothing of
significance. Even the heaviest hint of tax cuts to come was carefully
qualified in another passage. ''I know some of you think I talk about
Prudence so much that my wife should start getting worried,'' he jested,
a quip obviously not available to a Trappist monk.
His standing ovation was dutiful. Mr Howard's was close to ecstatic.
''If you don't want the time, don't do the crime,'' he cried and his
audience roared assent.
Before the day was out Mr Howard had been subjected to about the
closest to assault and battery the Lord Chief Justice of England has
got. Lord Taylor was up in arms at proposals which narrow judicial
options on sentencing.
Mr Howard, in a quick riposte, said judges have the range of options
that Parliament decides they should have. This may not play well in the
House of Lords but a majority of the nation's grannies are probably with
the Home Secretary.
One speaker who attacked ''stupid sentences'' roared: ''Who sacks
these people?'' In the case of judges, Parliament can but doesn't. Mr
Howard has plans to introduce his Crime Bill before the end of the year.
He must hope that not too many by elections come along before he gets it
through. For if they do, Labour could be celebrating remission of a year
or so on their sentence of 18 years in Opposition.

ONE of Blackpool's finest fish and chip shops has played host to the

The Cottage has gained a reputation for the exquisite quality of its
deep fried cod and chips at #2.70 a portion and Mr John Major was
clearly not going to miss out on a visit during Conservative Party
conference week.
He likes simple dishes and has been spotted in the past dining at
motorway service cafes on eggs, bacon, and burgers.
Mr and Mrs Major startled diners in the restaurant when they arrived
on Wednesday night with Special Branch men and were quickly ushered into
a back room for their supper.
With mushy peas, and jam roly-poly pudding and custard to follow --
the highlight of the menu -- the couple spent about one hour there
before embarking on a gruelling round of conference ''reception
surfing'' at the headquarters hotel.

DETECTIVES were last night hunting arsonists after police confirmed
that a fire which killed a young mother and her two young daughters was
started deliberately.
A murder inquiry was launched when petrol was found around the front
door of the home of Miss Diane Jones, 21, who died early on Wednesday
with her children, Shauna, two, and one-year-old Sarah Jane.
Detective Superintendent Colin Jones of South Wales police said the
attack on the terraced council house in Merthyr Tydfil, Mid Glamorgan,
was the most ''cowardly and despicable'' crime he had come across in 25
years of service.
''The assumption is it was petrol, and on that basis we are treating
it as malicious,'' he added.
Neighbours tried to rescue the victims, but the heat was too fierce.
Police yesterday spoke to the children's father, Shaun Hibberd, at
Cardiff jail, where he is serving four months for motoring offences. A
prison chaplain broke news of the deaths to him on Wednesday.

A BUSINESSMAN who told the Tory conference yesterday of paying
trainees about #1 an hour has rejected unions' criticism of his action
-- and found backing from his staff.
Mr Peter Bone, prospective parliamentary candidate for Pudsey, came
under fire after saying in a trade debate that Labour's minimum wage
would stop him being able to take on trainees.
Union spokesmen swiftly condemned the #1-an-hour figure as ''slave
wages'' and complained of Tories ''promoting bargain-basement Britain''
and engaging in ''special pleading for paying poverty wages''.
However, Mr Bone, 42, defended his action -- and was supported by the
two young women he had taken on as trainees at his travel firm.
Joanna Sweet, 19, and Rhiannon Thomas, 17, said working for Palm
Travel, in Newport, Wales, on #35 a week had given them the chance to
break into a popular profession.
Mr Bone told representatives: ''I couldn't have taken on either if
there had been a minimum wage. The minimum wage would condemn hundreds
of thousands of people to the dole queues.''
Mr John Monks, general secretary of the TUC, protested that #1 an hour
was ''slave wages'' by anyone's standards. ''The TUC recognises that age
and training will have to be taken into account when setting a minimum
wage, but young people, trainees and apprentices must not be exploited
as cheap labour.''
Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union, said it
was ''appalling'' that Mr Bone seemed to be proud of the money he paid.

MICHAEL PORTILLO'S unashamedly nationalistic attack on the European
Union on Tuesday earned a determined rebuttal yesterday from Sir Leon
Brittan, the British European Commissioner, who accused the Defence
Secretary of damaging the country.
Sir Leon's speech on the conference fringe in Blackpool continued the
efforts of pro-European Tories to reverse what they claim is the harm
done by Mr Portillo's ''don't mess with Britain'' address which drew
enthusiastic cheers of conference representatives.
He warned: ''I think that those involved in the leadership of this
country have a responsibility to speak with accuracy and with restraint.
If they fail to do so, they are damaging the party and damaging the
country.''
On Tuesday Mr Portillo suggested the European Commission was preparing
to standardise European regiments and cap badges and put British troops
on a 40-hour fighting week. Britain would not have its defence and
foreign policies dictated by Europe, he declared, adding: ''Britain will
not be told when to fight and when not to'.
His speech was condemned in Brussels and among Tory MPs and MEPs as
jingoistic and a misrepresentation of the work of the EU. The Maastricht
Treaty specifically excludes defence and foreign policy matters from the
Commission's competence.
Addressing a gathering of the Conservative Group for Europe, Sir Leon
mocked Mr Portillo's use of the SAS motto, ''who dares wins,'' saying:
''The shape of Europe should be a shape with which we can be
comfortable. We will not achieve that objective by skulking, by carping.
We will achieve that objective by participating. It is not a case of who
dares wins, but who is wise wins.''
The disintegration of Yugoslavia demonstrated the consequences that
flowed from adopting a different approach. ''It should not be the job of
politicians of any party to fan the flames. That's a dangerous principal
to adopt. I hope we will see no more of it.'' he said.
''Those in the Conservative Party who think we will win the next
General Election by swinging away from Europe should think again.''
Labour leader Tony Blair had not achieved a 30 point lead in the polls
by being anti-European.
DEPUTY Prime Minister Michael Heseltine yesterday stepped into a row
over Tory divisions on Europe.
Mr Heseltine said on BBC TV that the Government had a ''coherent
approach'' to the issue and emphasised Mr Portillo had been talking
about surrender of interests on military policy.

LABOUR'S plans for a minimum wage would amount to a cruel deception on
those on low incomes, President of the Board of Trade Ian Lang told Tory
conference delegates yesterday, (writes Benedict Brogan).
In a speech that earned him a standing ovation, the former Scottish
Secretary led the Government's attack on Labour's employment policies.
There was no painless way to help those on low wages, he said. ''I know
it might sound appealing to some. We all want to help people on low
incomes. But the pretence that there is an immediate, painless way to do
so, just by passing a law to say they must be paid more, is a cruel
deception.
''Imposing an artificial pay rise is the fastest and surest way to
detroy jobs. And it would be the low income jobs, the first rung on the
employment ladder, the very people Labour claim they want to help, they
would be the hardest hit. For many of them, it would be, instead of low
pay, no pay,'' he said.
A minimum wage was unfair, either to those who lost their jobs because
of it or to employers forced to pay higher wages. Labour had refused to
set a figure for a minimum wage because it knew it ''would cost this
country hundreds of thousands of jobs, with young people and the low
paid first in line for the chop''.
Evoking his shared background with the Labour leader, Mr Lang added:
''I have a candid, friendly, helpful message for Mr Blair, as one
Scottish ex-public school boy to another: play fair, be honest with the
electorate. If you're not prepared to show the price, don't put that
item on the menu.''
Mr Lang's other target was Labour's deal with BT, announced by Mr
Blair in his speech in Brighton last week, under which the company would
provide every school, hospital, and library in the country with a
computer link to the Internet in exchange for a relaxation of Government
anti-monopoly legislation.
He described the deal as a sham and a fraud, and claimed much of what
Labour was promising was already happening thanks to the Government's
initiative. Schools were being linked to the Internet at the rate of
almost 100 a week.

<TEXT>
AN expansion costing #1m at Scotland's newest ski area will be
unveiled later this month.
The project doubles the area available for winter sports at the Nevis
Range Ski Centre, on Aonach Mor mountain, near Fort William. There will
be a permanent reminder of the hit film Rob Roy, filmed locally. The new
T-Bar uplift is named after the outlaw clan hero played by Irish actor
Liam Neeson.
Skiers at Scotland's highest winter sports centre get access to the
Rob Roy T-bar via the new two-seater Great Glen Chairlift, which is
almost one mile long.
Among the areas opened up are more reliable sheltered slopes for
beginners to practise. The resort will be laying on private lessons for
youngsters under seven, while those over that age will be taught in
group lessons.
The main access up from the low-level car park to Nevis Range, which
lies off the A87 seven miles north of Fort William, is via Britain's
only enclosed mountain gondola cars.
The sports centre operators have bought a further chairlift to give
access to Coire Dubh -- the Black Corrie -- and it will be installed
next summer.
The new Nevis Range facilities open up a mountain area where
experienced enthusiasts can enjoy off-piste ''powder' skiing, if
conditions are right.
The resort is the first one in Scotland to recognise officially the
growing appeal of snow-boarding, by appointing full-time instructors and
designating a slope for them.
The opening ceremony takes place on October 23.

JOBS in Glasgow, Edinburgh and England are being lost after receivers
were called in at Colliers Erdman Lewis, a leading firm of chartered
surveyors and property consultants.
Within hours, the receivers, Ernst and Young, had finalised terms
allowing the firm to keep trading.
The deal was struck with Conrad Ritblat, chartered surveyors and
property consultants with 200 staff in offices in Glasgow, Leeds, London
and Ashford, in Kent.
But the takeover, aimed at providing ''a stable financial structure'',
will not prevent further redundancies at CEL. The firm had already been
slimming down operations and, overall, staff numbers will have fallen
from 375 to 305.
The Edinburgh office would close. There will be three redundancies,
while three surveyors will transfer to Glasgow where four of 46 jobs
will go.
The Birmingham office will close, with 20 job losses, and 25 out of 55
will go in Leeds.

OFFICIALS at Glasgow Airport were yesterday playing down the
significance of statistics which revealed another fall in passenger
levels.
Figures released by the BAAindicated that, last month, the traffic
using the airport fell by 3.9% in comparison with the total for
September 1994. At the same time, the tallies for Edinburgh and Aberdeen
rose, by 5.5% and 5.3% respectively.
However, a Glasgow Airport spokesman said the decrease was largely a
seasonal one, and could be explained by the summer heatwave in Scotland.
''Our business, much more than in Edinburgh and Aberdeen, is dependent
on charter planes, and we traditionally get a lot of late bookings for
autumn flights.
''But, because of the weather here, fewer people chose to fly out for
a late summer holiday this year. Last summer was dominated by rainfall,
so more charter planes flew out of Glasgow,'' he said.
Senior airport officials have, none the less, previously expressed
concern at the fact that several airlines have pulled out of Glasgow, at
a time when tens of millions of pounds are being invested in the
facilities.
Meanwhile, the BAA statistics reveal that the Channel Tunnel is taking
passengers away from the airlines.
Passenger numbers on most sectors at BAA-run UK airports showed big
increases last month, but European routes rose only 1.2%. BAA attributed
the small rise to Tunnel rail competition.
The number of Channel Tunnel Eurostar trains running from London's
Waterloo station to Paris and Brussels increased last month, putting
further pressure on airlines.
BAA's seven airports, including Heathrow and Gatwick, handled a total
of 9.1 million passengers in September, an 3.4% increase on last year's
equivalent figure.

<TEXT>
THE Serious Fraud Office yesterday quashed a private attempt to bring
Mr Nick Leeson to trial in Britain over the #860m collapse of Barings
Bank.
In yesterday's ruling, City of London Magistrates' Court withdrew
eight summonsesagainst the trader on changes of deception and false
accounting. It was a further blow to Mr Leeson's dwindling hopes of
avoiding a no-jury trial in Singapore and a sentence of up to 14 years
in Changi Jail.
Barings bondholders, who launched the original private action, have
said they will consider asking the High Court for a judicial review of
the court ruling.
The SFO, which had previously announced it would not challenge
Singapore's extradition request, took over the action and applied to the
court to have the charges withdrawn.
It was ''not in the public interest for there to be a prosecution of
Mr Leeson in the UK in the present circumstances'', the SFO said.
A German court last week approved Singapore's application for Mr
Leeson's extradition to face eight charges of fraud and three of
forgery.
Mr David Harrel, solicitor for the bond holders who lost #50m in the
Barings collapse, said they were considering challenging either the SFO
decision or an earlier court ruling that they had no right of audience
to argue against withdrawal of the summonses.

<TEXT>
SAFETY inspectors were last night investigating the death of a miner
believed to have been asphyxiated after an inrush of gas 650 metres
below ground.
Father-of-two Andrew Fielding, 39, was pronounced dead at Thoresby
colliery in Nottinghamshire after the incident, which led to the
suspension of coal production.
The National Union of Mineworkers said it had been trying for the past
three weeks to obtain masks for miners at the pit after they complained
of having to breathe in oil fumes.
Mr Fielding, of Kiveton Park, near Sheffield, worked as a service
engineer for a company supplying machinery to the mining industry.
It was the first fatality at a pit owned by RJB Mining, which bought
the bulk of British Coal at the end of last year.
Two of Mr Fielding's colleagues were taken to the Kings Mill Hospital
in Sutton Ashfield suffering from dehydration and breathing problems.
Four rescue workers were taken to the hospital at the end of the
rescue operation, suffering from similar breathing difficulties caused
by dust in the pit, just a few hundred yards from Sherwood Forest.
RJB Mining said Mr Fielding died after an underground roadway in which
he was working, three miles from the pit's shafts, hit a pocket of oil
and gas. The company said there was no explosion.
The Mines Inspectorate, which launched an investigation into the
incident, said last night there had been an outburst of oil and
hydrocarbon gases affecting several workers.
Mr Henry Richardson, Nottinghamshire area official of the NUM, said
there had been oil fume problems at the pit.
''We can't make any definite accusations about what went wrong because
it has got to be investigated,'' he said. ''But geographically in that
region there has been oil present underground in at least three
collieries, including Thoresby.''
Two years ago three miners were killed in a roof fall in Bilsthorpe
Colliery, Nottinghamshire, a few miles away.
Thoresby is one of the most productive pits in the Nottinghamshire
coalfield, employing around 500 miners and 280 contract workers.
RJB has a good safety record, claiming a 27% improvement at the 21
pits it bought from British Coal.

GLASGOW District Council leader Pat Lally said yesterday he was
''astonished'' that Post Office officials, and not its board of
directors, are to decide whether to accept a bid to buy the city's
George Square post office building to house the new National Gallery of
Scottish Art.
Speaking before a meeting between gallery supporters and the chief
executive of the Post Office, Mr Bill Cockburn, in London today, Mr
Lally said a decision of such importance should be made by Post Office
directors because they have public accountability while officials have
''more limited horizons'' and might not consider all aspects of the
Glasgow Development Agency bid.
Royal Mail Property Holdings, a business unit of the Post Office, will
decide which bid -- there are believed to be two others -- to accept and
is expected to announce its decision by next Wednesday, 14 days after
the closing date for bids on October 4.
Mr Lally had assumed that the Post Office board in London would make
the decision but the Royal Mail said yesterday that Royal Mail Property
Holdings would assess the bids, with input from the unit's Scottish
division, and make the final decision.
A spokeswoman said this was standard practice and insisted that ''all
relevant factors'' relating to each bid would be considered.
She rejected suggestions that the issue merited consideration by Post
Office directors because of the public interest aspects of the gallery
plan and said: ''The responsibility for the decision lies very correctly
with Royal Mail Property Holdings who are the owners and managers of
buildings in the Post Office group.''
However, Mr Lally said he would be very surprised if board members
allowed a decision of that nature to be made by officials ''on purely
what they might regard as commercial reasons''.
He added: ''The board of directors will have been appointed by the
Government and there is an element of public accountability as a
consequence of that.
''The officials' horizons are clearly more limited and more functional
than that and won't take into account all of the factors that should
influence a public body.''
Mr Lally also warned that accepting another bid -- one is believed to
be from a private property developer and #1.5m more than the GDA's #3m
offer -- could mean a long wait for the Post Office before it realised
its asset because a ''heavily qualified'' bid could involve lengthy
planning procedures.
GDA chief executive Stuart Gulliver and chairman Michael Lunn were
invited along with Mr Angus Grossart, chairman of the trustees of the
National Galleries of Scotland, to meet Mr Cockburn today. A letter was
faxed by the GDA to Mr Cockburn after a meeting between gallery
supporters and Post Office officials on Tuesday.
In the letter, the GDA called on Mr Cockburn's board to ''reconsider''
its offer, if the GDA's information that the post office building was to
be sold to a private developer was correct.
The Royal Mail has denied that any decision has been made, claiming
its position had been misunderstood at Tuesday's meeting, and yesterday
reiterated that the bids were still being considered.

<TEXT>
A YOUNG soldier is claiming damages of more than #1m from the Ministry
of Defence after he was paralysed from the neck down when an assault
course exercise went tragically wrong.
The Army has admitted liability for the injuries suffered by Private
Iain Roy, 23, and his lawyers have won an English court judgment against
Defence Secretary Michael Portillo. The amount of damages is likely to
be decided next year.
Private Roy had been in the Army's Royal Logistics Corps for three
months when the accident happened at Pirbright Training Camp, Surrey, on
January 22, 1994.
He claims he was pushed by an Army physical training instructor and
fell into a shallow pit of muddy water, breaking his neck on the
concrete bottom. The accident happened at an obstacle on the training
course where soldiers had to climb a bank, grab a rope, and swing over
water to the other bank.
Private Roy said his instructor attempted to get him on the rope with
four other soldiers to swing across the 2ft-deep water. His section were
competing against another to see who could get the most people across
the obstacle at one time.
The corporal instructing the group ordered Private Roy to leap on to
the rope with the other four and pushed him as it swung out of reach
over the water.
The lives of Private Roy's family have been badly affected by the
accident. His father, Brian, a policeman, was allowed to transfer from
Fraserburgh to his home town of Forres so that relatives could help with
caring for Private Roy.
Yesterday, from his bed in Raigmore Hospital, Inverness, where his
recovering from a chest infection, Private Roy said he wanted the matter
settled as quickly as possible.
He said: ''I want to get on with the rest of my life now. My mum has
given up 18 months of her life to nurse me since the accident. I could
not have asked for more from her but I need to get a place of my own and
full-time carers to allow her to get on with her life too.''
Yesterday, his mother, Veronica, of Forbes Hill, Forres, who did an
intensive week-long nursing course to allow her to look after her
disabled son, said: ''Before the accident, Iain was a big strong
strapping lad who had always wanted to join the colours. He enjoyed his
life in the Army right up to the accident.
''His 17-year-old brother, Colin, also though about joining up but now
there is no way I will let him.''
Mr Byron Carron, a personal injury claims specialist, of Townsends
Solicitors, Swindon, said that only one person should have been on the
assault course rope at one time.
He said: ''I have now obtained a judgment against the Ministry of
Defence with an order for damages for Private Roy. In view of his young
age and the condition in which he finds himself, the sum of money
involved is likely to be very substantial indeed.''
The lawyer said that it would probably be one year before it became
clear just how much cash Private Roy would receive.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said yesterday: ''We have
admitted liability and we hope we can settle soon to everyone's
satisfaction. The level of award will be worked out scientifically,
weighing up medical and other factors.''
An Army board of inquiry investigated the accident but apportioned no
blame to any individual. A spokesman said: ''We are treating this as
nothing more than a tragic accident.''

A TRIAL of an anti-cancer drug was launched yesterday amid renewed
controversy over the drug's safety.
The Cancer Research Campaign appealed for 20,000 women with breast
cancer to take part in the latest testing of tamoxifen to establish
whether the drug should be used beyond the normal two-year course of
treatment.
It is organising the trial with other charities and research bodies in
the UK Co-ordianting Committee on Cancer Research.
The drug, the most successful preventative treatment for breast
cancer, is known to improve a victim's chances of surviving for 10 years
from 45% to 51%. Worldwide, it is thought to save around 10,000 deaths
each year.
Its worth was established when women who had suffered cancer in one
breast were shown to be far less likely to contract it in the other if
they were given tamoxifen, typically as a follow-up to other treatment
such as surgery.
More than 3000 woman in Scotland are affected by breast cancer every
year and 250,000 worldwide.
The new trial, named aTTom, will compare the progress of women who are
given tamoxifen beyond two years with those who are not.
Professor Gordon McVie, scientific director of Cancer Research, said
yesterday: ''Previous studies indicate that two years is better than
one, and suggest that five years may be better than two, but there is no
direct scientific evidence that prolonging treatment beyond two years
has an extra therapeutic advantage.''
One of the possible drawbacks of the drug is an increased risk of
cancer of the lining of the womb, the endometrium, attributed to
tamoxifen use.
This bears even more keenly on another trial already under way testing
the drug on healthy women to prevent the disease in the first place. The
International Breast Cancer Intervention Study is targeted at women who
have been shown, through family history, of having at least double the
normal risk of breast cancer.
Last year, doctors at 10 cancer centres, including Glasgow, began
recruiting patients to the trial. However, on Wednesday night one of the
doctors who proposed the trial nine years ago, Dr Richard Bulbrook, said
on Channel 4 that the trial ought to be halted because of the side
effects -- of which 41 had been reported -- and hundreds of women were
being put at risk of endometrial cancer. Other links suspected include
liver and bowel cancer.
Dr Jack Cuzick, chairman of the UK Co-ordinating Committee's working
party for the Intervention Study, complained yesterday about the lack of
balance in the programme.
He said: ''We have already had calls from breast cancer patients on
tamoxifen who have been alarmed by the report and we are extremely
concerned that there may be women who may stop taking the drug without
consulting their doctor as a result.''
He emphasised there was nothing new in the fact that tamoxifen was
associated with endometrial cancer. It was made clear when the trial was
launched and all women taking part in it were informed.
He said: ''No woman is included with less than a one in six lifetime
risk of breast cancer, which is double the normal, but that only applies
to older women in whom the underlying risk is already higher; for women
under 45 we require a four-fold risk, and in woman aged 35-39 an even
higher ten-fold risk.''
Tamoxifen is thought to increase the risk of endometrial cancer from
three per 10,000 women each year to six to nine per 10,000.
Dr Adrian Harnett, consultant oncologist at the Beatson Centre,
Glasgow, said: ''It is a very rare complication, albeit a serious one,
and has tended to be associated with very long-term use at higher doses
than are now the norm. The world view is there are no excessive deaths
from other types of cancer.''
The Imperial Cancer Research Fund, the leading research charity in the
Intervention Study, said that, at worst, it expected 40 extra cases of
endometrial cancer and fewer than six extra deaths in the 7500 women
taking the drug over ten years.
Professor George Kerr, a former Glasgow oncologist now helping to
co-ordinate the aTTom trial from CRC Institute at Birmingham University,
said last night: ''There have only been two hunderd cases of endometrial
cancer linked to tamoxifen in five million women-years of use.
''Endometrial cancer is also treatable if caught in time, and doctors
and patients in the trial will be very much aware of the possibility if
symptoms emerge. We need lots of doctors to support this by recruiting
patients, including doctors in Scotland.''

A JILTED man vandalised the house which he and his former fiancee had
built after she ended their relationship, a court heard yesterday.
Mother-of-two Marion McAllister, 41, left former car salesman Gordon
Gillespie, 38, after learning he had embezzled thousands of pounds from
the garage where he worked.
Stirling Sheriff Court was told that Gillespie stole her car which was
parked outside the town's railway station.
He drove to Drip End Farm, outside Stirling, and let himself into
their former home with his latch key.
Gillespie ruined three new sofas, a new bed, a duvet cover and a
carpet by pouring red wine over them.
He pulled a fireplace from the wall and, using a pick axe, smashed
tables, a wardrobe, bathroom mirror, two pictures, and a plant stand.
He pulled every item of clothing he had given her from her wardrobe.
In the garden, he made a bonfire of bras, pants and nightdresses.
He also burned a number of skirts, trousers, jumpers, underskirts,
bodysuits and a pair of boots.
He stole jewellery he had given her -- taking her diamond ring back to
the shop where he had bought it and redeeming it for a fraction of the
retail price.
He also took a chair, an iron, family photographs and a hairdrier.
The devastation was discovered by Miss McAllister's daughters when
they returned home from school on November 17 last year.
The court heard that Gillespie could not be traced because he had left
Stirling. Police found him nearly a month later hiding in Miss
McAllister's garden.
He took them to nearby Kildean auction market where they found Miss
McAllister's car.
The court was told Miss McAllister had estimated damage exceeded
#25,000.
Gillespie, of Princes Street, Stirling, admitted theft, car theft and
malicious damage.
In July, at the same court, he had admitted pocketing nearly #10,000
in cash and cheques from his employers, Mogil Motors of Stirling, when
he was sentenced to 240 hours' community service.
Defending, Mr Ken Dalling said Gillespie, now unemployed, had put more
than #20,000 of his money into building the house. The job had cost much
more than expected, and the embezzlement had been to pay for it.
Gillespie was jailed for nine months and banned from driving for 12
months on the car theft charge.

THERE is a danger that any hardening of attitudes towards granting
bail could result in the unnecessary and costly imprisonment before
trial of many people who would have been good bail risks.
This warning will be made today when Mr John McNeill, chief executive
of the Scottish Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders,
addresses the organisation's annual meeting in Edinburgh.
He will tell delegates that programmes working with offenders in the
community are more effective than custody, but that provision throughout
Scotland is inadequate.
Mr McNeill maintains there is official recognition that greater
efforts must be directed to reducing prison overcrowding. Sacro has
always advocated that whenever possible criminals should be dealt with
in the community.
The meeting will hear a call for a shift of focus away from custody
and towards community-based facilities to support people on bail and
reduce the risk of their reoffending.
Mr McNeill, who will give figures showing that more than 80% of
defenders do not offend while on bail, will warn that young people are
highly vulnerable and incidents of self-harm and attempted suicide are
''over-represented'' among remand prisoners.

Service to the public is something I earnestly care about. It is
fundamental to the task of policing
THE new chief constable of Strathclyde is to be Mr John Orr, the
former village bobby of Monkton, Ayrshire, who led the Lockerbie bombing
investigation and became assistant inspector of constabulary for
Scotland.
Mr Leslie Sharp, the present chief constable, retires at the end of
the year.
Mr Orr, 50, is currently deputy chief constable of Dumfries and
Galloway Constabulary, holding the inspectorate post on secondment.
He was chosen for Scotland's top policing post, which carries a salary
of #87,000, ahead of Mr Barry Shaw, chief constable of Cleveland, and Mr
Malcolm Cairns, deputy chief constable of Greater Manchester Police.
He said it gave him great pleasure to come back to Strathclyde as
chief constable and that the knowledge he already possessed of the force
would stand him in good stead.
A native of Kilmarnock, his police career began in Ayrshire and Bute
Constabulary as a cadet in 1961, a career which saw him rise to joint
head of Strathclyde CID as a detective superintendent in 1987.
It was at that rank that he was seconded to head the Lockerbie murder
investigation in December 1988. Two years later he was appointed deputy
chief constable at Dumfries and Galloway.
He said yesterday, when asked about the highly acclaimed 90-day
operations mounted by Mr Sharp to tackle specific crime issues in
Strathclyde, that he hoped to be able to build in his own way on the
achievements of Mr Sharp.
''Service to the public is something I earnestly care about,'' he
said. ''It is fundamental to the task of policing. I have long been an
advocate of community policing and if you can get a balance between that
and the strategic policing of major crime problems that is the way
forward.
''There has to be a partnership with the public and a firm commitment
to the public.''
In 1989, The Herald profiled Mr Orr during his time as head of the
Lockerbie investigation. What he said then found echoes in what he
indicated yesterday: successful policing is a partnership between police
and public and that that is the only way.
He described his village bobby days in Ayrshire as the best possible
training in dealing with people; living with them, getting to know them
and being able to communicate with them.
When he took charge at Lockerbie he found himself applying the same
principles to a diverse community of policemen from differing forces and
eventually from different continents. The task was bigger -- finding the
mass murderers of 270 people -- but the principles did not change.
He stuck firmly to the Scottish view of fairness to any future accused
during that investigation, stepping back from trial by media, English or
American style, with the result that he gained an undeserved reputation
for reticence.
Eventually he was able to send a report to the Crown Office which led
to the indictment of two Libyan agents.
This outcome has led to international ridicule and to allegations that
the British Government was involved with the Americans in an elaborate
cover-up to protect the Syrians and Iranians who were the real authors
of the Lockerbie bomb but who had to be kept onside for the purposes of
the Gulf war.
Those who know John Orr find it impossible to conceive of his being
involved in anything so fundamentally wrong. The truth is that while
there were dribs and drabs of evidence suggesting involvement of others,
there was only ever a sufficiency of evidence against the two Libyans.
Mr Orr agreed that it would be his earnest hope to see the men
indicted for the Lockerbie bombing brought to trial in Scotland, but he
refused to comment further because the warrants for the suspects were
still active.
At the time of his appointment to lead the case senior officers told
The Herald it was his ability to motivate, allied to a sure eye for
selecting the right team members, which led to the choice.
It was clear even before that point that Mr Orr was ambitious. It was
always a possibility, openly discussed by those around him, that he
would go all the way to the top.
A family man with two sons also in the police, Mr Orr has had in the
past a close attachment to the Rotary organisation, which he sees as a
means of giving something back to the community. That is at one with his
ideal of service and the team approach.
It was through Rotary that he got some of his first international
experience, a study trip to America where he saw at first hand the
American way of doing things.
He earned a degree after a four-year Open University course and he
went on to complete a two-year diploma course in forensic medicine at
Glasgow University.
At the outset of Lockerbie, John Orr was quoted as saying he had never
done anything in his life without going for a positive result. Yesterday
he secured the best result possible.

BUS operators in Glasgow have won their case to keep services one-way
through Argyle Street between Union Street and Queen Street.
Under its much vaunted Millennium Plan for city centre traffic
control, Strathclyde region had hoped to remove all traffic from that
stretch of Argyle Street during main shopping hours.
However, after consultation with the bus lobby, the region's roads
department is now prepared to allow one-way eastbound traffic, including
eastbound buses on Argyle Street between Union Street and Queen Street.
Councillor Malcolm Green had argued that the amendment could hinder
efforts to reduce pollution under the Jamaica Street bridge. Mr Don
Carruthers, director of roads, explained that the original proposal
would create overcrowding at bus stops in adjacent streets.
Meanwhile, the council is pressing ahead with its strategy of
discouraging motorists from driving into the city. The controlled
parking zone will be extended from the city centre to include adjacent
areas.
Within the city centre itself, waiting and loading restrictions will
be extended to cover early evenings, Saturday afternoons, and Sundays.
But there was good news for cyclists and pedestrians who will have a
new bridge over the Clyde built for their use just downstream from the
King George V Bridge.

FIREFIGHTERS called to a house when the toaster caught fire found
three children, who had been left with a lodger while their parents went
to Florida for two weeks, living in squalor, Edinburgh Sheriff Court was
told yesterday.
The firefighters, and police who arrived after the fire, noticed an
''unhealthy stench'' in the Wester Hailes, Edinburgh, flat.
They also found it littered with scraps of mouldy food; an open bin
full of rotting rubbish; soiled nappies and dog dirt in various parts of
the flat; and the sink full of unwashed dishes.
The lodger, Robert Reid, 23, who had been left to look after the
children, was fined #200.
He had earlier admitted wilfully neglecting the youngsters by leaving
them unattended and without supervision in the house at various times
during the fortnight their parents were away in May.
Sheriff James Farrell was told that Reid, of Calder Grove, Edinburgh,
had been given #100 to look after the two boys, aged 12 and one, and
their eight-year-old sister.
Depute-fiscal David Dickson said that the situation was discovered
when the toaster in the flat caught fire.
Mr David Edgar, defending, said that Reid was a ''fairly dull'' man
who had wanted to help when asked to babysit at short notice. However,
he had no experience of looking after children and was not up to the
job.
The children's aunt would have been able to help, but Reid was
reluctant to bother her, said Mr Edgar.
He panicked when he heard about the toaster fire and realised the
potentially serious consequences.
Mr Edgar said that Reid would not be looking after these or any other
children again. Sheriff Farrell pointed out that Reid would have no
continuing connection with the children.

THE controversial privatisation of the Scottish NHS computer network
has hit further problems.
Last night, the new operating company, Computer Sciences Ltd, admitted
there had been a delay in the transfer of the service to it and a
shortfall in work which would inevitably mean substantial job losses
among the 500 staff.
Mr Dave Watson, regional officer of the public sector union Unison,
said: ''The whole exercise has been a complete shambles, damaging the
Scottish health service and costing the taxpayer millions of pounds.''
The service, based at several centres throughout the country, provides
computer systems for payroll, patient records and other administrative
functions for what is Scotland's largest employer.
It was privatised by the NHS special projects directorate, headed by
Mr Laurence Peterken, former general manager of Greater Glasgow Health
Board, to save an estimated #3m a year.
However, the National Audit Office is already investigating claims
that #14m was written off the assets of the service before to the
transfer.
Mr Watson said that blunder had already wiped out the #14m in
administrative savings in the NHS being sought by Scottish Secretary
Michael Forsyth.
He added that the current problem lay with the Scottish Office
specifications in the contract which had failed to deliver the amount of
work originally indicated.
''This means that some trusts are buying computer services from
outside which again is going to cost the taxpayer more,'' he said.
Mr David Patrick, programme controller for Computer Sciences, said
events had changed since the company made its final offer.
Instead of dealing centrally, it had to negotiate with 74 different
NHS trusts or agencies and there was a shortfall in work.
''We don't want to make people redundant, but this reduction in work
is going to make life much tougher for us. Ultimately that means a lot
of people will suffer the consequences,'' he said.
A Scottish Office spokeswoman said: ''We have expressed our
disappointment to Computer Sciences that redundancies are contemplated
so early in the programme and have asked the company to take all
possible measures to ensure that they are kept to the minimum
necessary.''

<HEADLINE>Tobacco firm wants cancer case widow to lodge #2m</HEADLINE>

A WIDOW with a meagre income has been asked to lodge up to #2m in
court by a tobacco company which she accuses of causing her husband's
death through lung cancer.
Imperial Tobacco said it faced ''astronomical'' costs in the first
court hearing of its kind in Britain and claimed the case by Mrs
Margaret McTear was part of a wider anti-smoking crusade which could
open the legal floodgates.
Mrs McTear's counsel argued that, if the tobacco company succeeded in
yesterday's court move, thousands of Scots could be denied their
fundamental right of access to justice.
Mr Alfred McTear died in March 1993 aged 49 after contracting lung
cancer. He had raised a damages action against Imperial Tobacco, makers
of the John Player cigarettes, which he had smoked for almost 30 years.
Lawyers went to his home at Cherrywood Drive, Beith, Ayrshire, to take
evidence from him but he died before he could complete it.
After he died, Mrs McTear applied for public funds to sue in her own
right, but this was refused by the Scottish Legal Aid Board. Her lawyers
are now pursuing the case on a speculative basis which means if she
loses they do not get paid.
Since Mrs McTear has very little money, it would also mean that
Imperial would be unable to recover its legal expenses from her if the
case went against her.
Mrs McTear claims that, when her husband started smoking in the 1960s,
he was not aware of the risks and later became addicted so that he could
not give up until death was staring him in the face.
Mr Nigel Emslie, QC, counsel for Imperial Tobacco, asked Lord Gill at
the Court of Session to order Mrs McTear to lodge money in court as
security for his clients ''colossal'' legal expenses.
''In the special circumstances of this case, the defenders ought to
have security against the very real risk of irrecoverable expense.
''If proper security for expenses were to be available, the defenders
are happy to defend the action and to fight the pursuer's claim. Justice
demands that they should not be exposed to massive financial burden with
no prospect of recovery at the end of the day.''
The central allegation was that the Imperial should have known of and
warned about the health hazards of smoking before Mr McTear took up the
habit in 1964. The argument was that, if such warnings had been given,
Mr McTear would never have taken up smoking.
Mr McTear continued to smoke until his cancer was diagnosed in 1992
despite the fact that warnings had been issued on cigarette packets and
in adverts from 1971.
Mr Emslie added: ''So far as the defenders are concerned, every
element of this claim is disputed.''
He said Imperial was going to have to embark on an enormous
investigation, not only of its own archive material but that of the
Government which had approved tobacco sales.
Mr Emslie submitted that, even if Mrs McTear won her case, she would
receive damages in the low tens of thousands while the cost to Imperial,
even to the stage of preparing its defences for a court hearing, could
rightly be regarded as astronomical. A figure of about #2m was ''not out
of the way''.
Mr Emslie also told the court that publicity material about the case
indicated that it was part of a wider campaign or crusade by at least
one of the anti-smoking organisations in alliance with Mrs McTear's
solicitors.
Mr Colin McEachran QC, for Mrs McTear, said she was clearly unable to
find the security demanded. She had little capital and only a meagre
income.
He argued that the courts should be open to all ''high or low'' and
added: ''The whole purpose of having the courts open to the general
public disappears if in each case they are told to find a huge sum of
caution before their case can proceed.
''The amount of civil legal aid has been cut back by the Government to
a very low level of income. Very many people would have no chance at all
to meet a claim for caution and the court must be very wary of cutting
these people off.''
Mr McEachran accused Imperial of making ''a huge mountain out of a
quite straightforward case''.
The hearing continues.

CONTRACTS for catering, cleaning, and suppling European Night Service
trains between Glasgow and Paris have been won by a German firm,
Mitropa.
Although catering and cleaning will be sub-contracted, it expects to
employ up to 100 staff at each of two servicing centres to be created in
Glasgow and London. Supply bases will also be created in Glasgow,
London, Manchester, Plymouth, and Swansea.
The contracts are for three years and expected to generate income of
about #6m annually.
Mitropa is an East German catering firm which joined forces last year
with its West German counterpart DSG following reunification. It has
already won a similar contract for overnight trains between Austria,
Germany, and Switzerland.
European Night Service's Glasgow to Paris sleepers, via the Channel
Tunnel, are expected to begin next summer, with trains also covering
London, Manchester, Plymouth, and Swansea.
A Berlin-based Mitropa official said last night that UK recruitment
would begin early next year. She added: ''We are delighted at winning
the contracts which were out to tender internationally.''

A SMALL girl badly injured when a shell exploded outside her Sarajevo
home, killing her three friends, will not undergo an operation in an
Edinburgh hospital because the risk is too great.
Maja Skoric, accompanied by her mother Hankija, was flown to the Royal
Hospital for Sick Children to be assessed for possible treatment of a
shrapnel fragment lodged near her brain.
Yesterday hospital authorities revealed that the assessment had been
completed and two consultants, a neurologist and a neurosurgeon, had
taken the decision not to proceed.
''An operation to remove the fragment would involve an unacceptable
risk to Maja, who, though she has some difficulty, is generally well,''
said an official. ''As a result Maja will be discharged from the
hospital later this week.''
Maja is the second Bosnian child this year to be flown to the
Edinburgh hospital.

Rudyard Kipling's anthem to the stiff upper lip which was voted
Britain's favourite poem after the first nationwide telephone poll for
National Poetry Day.
If you can keep your head when all about you
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:
If you can dream -- and not make dreams your master;
If you can think -- and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
And treat those two imposters just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:
If you can make one heap of all your winnings
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
Except the Will which says to them: ''Hold on!''
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
Or walk with Kings -- nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
And -- which is more -- you'll be a Man, my son!

IT is an object lesson in how to stop a drama rapidly turning into a
life-threatening crisis. The unlikely teacher is a quietly spoken
10-year-old boy from the Isle of Seil in Argyll.
The story begins on a dark, frosty February night on the island, as
the cluster of houses that cling to the western edge of Scotland at
Clachan Seil are battered by the wind whipping off the Firth of Lorn.
All is normal in the Maclean household. Ten-year-old Stuart, like boys
of his age all over the country, is doing his homework -- in this case
playing the fiddle -- while his mother Sue is busy round the house.
In that second that separates us all from potential tragedy, Stuart's
mother suddenly becomes ill and loses consciousness.
It is enough to panic any adult. But not, it seems, a 10-year-old boy
who has learned basic emergency care at the local primary school at
Easdale.
The family's doctor, Eleanor Steiner, takes up the story. ''Stuart got
his mother into the recovery position -- still unconscious. He then
rapidly telephoned the doctor on duty -- myself -- coping with the
recently introduced digital phone number.
''He gave a clear simple message, his name and address, saying he
needed urgent medical help. He then ran for a neighbour. It being dark,
he looked out for the doctor's car and took me to his mother.
''His actions could have been life-saving and took all his resources.
He is a quiet, not naturally confident, boy. He had learned basic
emergency care at his local primary school and put his knowledge into
action with great presence of mind.''
Last night, Stuart's actions were recognised at the Argyll and Clyde
Health Board's annual Action Health Awards at the Glynhill Hotel in
Renfrew.
Stuart was presented with a glass trophy, a framed certificate and a
cheque for #100 by Rangers striker Ally McCoist.
The highlight was meeting the irrepressible Mr McCoist whom he had
only seen on TV. ''I would love to go to a game,'' he said.
It was a good opening and there was no way McCoist could miss. ''We'll
sort it out for him,'' he said.
He thought Stuart was a tremendous character. ''He probably thinks
he's getting a boost meeting me, but it's the other way around. It's me
that's getting the boost meeting him.''
Two characters, in fact. A score draw the only outcome.

THE Barlinnie Prison doctor at the centre of last night's
controversial BBC1 Frontline Scotland programme on alleged jail
brutality is himself the subject of two investigations into misconduct,
it emerged yesterday.
In the TV report, Dr Simon Danson backed three inmates' allegations
that they were victims of brutality by prison officers at the jail. It
was televised after an interdict application by the Scottish Prison
Officers' Association failed.
In Beaten by the System, Dr Danson said that injuries sustained by
lifer James McGhee, who claims he was beaten by officers after being
transferred to Barlinnie following a riot at Shotts Prison in 1993, were
''a classic picture of having been tortured''.
He supported similar claims by Tommy Monaghan, allegedly beaten in
transit to Barlinnie following a 1994 Glenochil riot, adding that
Monaghan's life had been put in danger.
The programme showed photographs of the men's injuries which Dr Danson
said he took because he was appalled at their condition.
However, last night it emerged that the doctor is the subject of an
investigation by the Scottish Prison Service -- launched before he made
the programme -- into his conduct while medically examining three female
prison officers.
He also faces an inquiry into his action in publicly commenting on
cases which are still the subject of investigation by the Crown.
An SPS spokesman said: ''If the courts and the police had been
exhausted, one could perhaps understand Dr Danson's action.
''We cannot comment on the assault allegations while they are still
being investigated by the Crown and as a prison employee Dr Danson is
subject to the same code of conduct.''
He said that the doctor did not, as the programme stated, face a
disciplinary hearing over the matter at Barlinnie next week.
However, he added: ''Three female officers have complained about the
manner in which Dr Danson examined them during a routine medical. A
senior governor has investigated the matter and has sent a report, with
recommendations, to the Crown.''
SPS chief executive Edward Frizzell yesterday criticised the programme
which claimed the prisoners' complaints had not been given a fair
hearing.
He said: ''Allegations made in the programme were reported to the
police at the time and members of staff were part of the subsequent
police investigations.
''The producer was advised that we could not comment until the
prosecuting authorities have concluded their investigations.''

THE ''depressing and demoralising'' impact of pupil indiscipline and
the growing drugs menace in Scotland's schools were highlighted in a
report published yesterday.
When the main teachers' union, the Educational Institute of Scotland,
last carried out an in-depth study of school discipline less than 10
years ago drugs did not figure in the inquiry.
However, Mr Danny McDonald, who chaired the EIS committee which
produced the new report, confirmed yesterday: ''There is not a secondary
school in the country in which drugs are not an issue.''
The report confirms that persistent, low-level troublemaking -- such
as pupils talking out of turn, shouting, and leaving seats without
permission -- is still the biggest problem.
Recent research showed that dealing with such incidents halved the
learning time.
The EIS is also increasingly concerned about assaults on teachers and,
based on returns from one local authority, estimates one teacher in 70
is the victim of pupil assaults each year.
It believes the estimate is only the tip of an iceberg because
teachers are reluctant to report assaults since they will have to
rebuild relationships with excluded pupils.
The union also claims headteachers do not want assaults recorded
because the data reflects badly on schools, which are operating in an
increasingly competitive world.
Confirming the growing drug problem, the report states: ''It is not
merely a contravention of school rules. The increasingly widespread
availability and use of recreational drugs across Scotland is a cause of
particular concern to schools.
''It is a fact of life that a wide range of illegal drugs is available
in almost all communities and that many people, including young people,
become engaged in the buying and selling of drugs.''
Mr McDonald, principal teacher of English at Rockwell High in Dundee,
said teachers recognised that recreational drugs were a social
phenomenon which would not go away.
They were having to deal with pupils in school who had swallowed a
handful of unidentified tablets and others who came into the classroom
having smoked cannabis
He agreed that dealing must also be a part of the drugs problem in
schools.
Schools could not condone drug-related activities, which meant that
they would play a bigger part in disciplinary matters, says the report.
However, too many teachers already spent too much time on disciplinary
matters.
Mr McDonald said: ''Promoted staff want more time for school
discipline strategies. They find their days clogged up dealing with
indiscipline.''
The report calls for diversity in tackling indiscipline because there
is no single answer to the many problems. However, it notes that smaller
class sizes were identified as the priority for improving discipline.

THE Scottish Office last night dismissed claims that hundreds of
cracks had appeared in the Skye bridge before it had even opened.
The claim, made in a morning newspaper, said some of the cracks
measured eight feet.
However, a Scottish Office spokesman said the bridge was safe and
there was no question of danger to the public.
He said: ''There are micro cracks which are normal for most large
civil engineering projects where there are large concrete pours.
''They are cosmetic and have been filled by injecting epoxy resin
material. There is absolutely no structural problem or issue of public
safety.''
Children of Loch Duich Primary School are to perform the
ribbon-cutting at the opening of the #24m bridge on Monday.

CHANGES in law-and-order strategy outlined by Scottish Secretary
Michael Forsyth have been put under close scrutiny by politicians and
prison officer representatives, who claim that there are serious flaws
in his new get-tough policies.
Mr Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat spokesman on Home and Legal
Affairs, said last night that Mr Forsyth's move to give minimal
remission for good behaviour was ''hardly likely to help maintain peace
in the prisons,'' adding that his proposals had been determined by
''base emotion''.
He said: ''His proposals may be superficially attractive to unthinking
Tory conference representatives, but they ignore the sophisticiation of
the Scottish judicial system. If a judge knows that the sentence he
imposes will be served in its entirety, he will undoubtedly alter the
sentence accordingly.''
Members of the Prison Officers' Association said the move for tougher
sentencing would lead to a bigger prison population, and would
strengthen the need for a new prison to be built in Scotland to cope.
The criminal justice charity, Sacro, said it had grave reservations
about the changes and would be making representations to Mr Forsyth.
Mr Jim Dawson, deputy general secretary of the Prison Officers'
Association, said ending the automatic chance of remission for inmates
would inevitably lead to an escalation in the prison population and lead
to frustration among prisoners.
At present, there are 5700 prisoners in 21 Scottish jails, looked
after by 4000 prison officers. Before Mr Forsyth's decision to toughen
up sentencing, it was estimated that, by the year 2000, there would be
around 6000 people in Scottish jails.
Mr Dawson said: ''If the prison numbers go up then the issue is far
greater than looking for more staff and money. It is clear, with the
estimated rise in prison population and Mr Forsyth's comments, a new
prison will be needed.
''However, we have a difference of opinion with Mr Forsyth and Mr
Eddie Frizell of the Scottish Prison Service, who seem to think any new
prison should be privately financed.''
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson challenged Mr Forsyth to
tell the people of Scotland how much his new policy would cost them.
Mr Robertson said: ''Tougher sentencing and tighter rules on remission
will mean more people in prison. How much will all this cost the
taxpayer?''
Ms Fiona Hyslop, for the Scottish National Party, accused Mr Forsyth
of failing to address head-on the problems in the prison service.
Ms Hyslop said: ''Michael Forsyth is simply following Michael Howard
in these matters and the proposals are all very well. However, he has
failed to explain how the problem of prison overcrowding will be
addressed, or how the backlog of cases which are waiting to reach court
will be processed.''

<HEADLINE>Fears for 1200 postal jobs</HEADLINE>

SOME 1200 full-time and temporary postal jobs are to be axed across
Scotland and Northern Ireland, according to a confidential Royal Mail
document leaked by the Communications Workers Union.
However, there appears to be a lack of communication between the union
and the Royal Mail on the issue.
According to the union, the frequency and timing of mail deliveries
will suffer and second deliveries will be seriously undermined.
It has called an emergency meeting of branch secretaries and area
representatives in Edinburgh today. It says the proposed cuts have come
out of the blue, and are likely to mean compulsory redundancies.
However, the Royal Mail said the unions had misunderstood the memo,
which was an update of a plan revealed several years ago to slim down
the UK workforce by 15,000 over a five-year period to reflect increased
automation.
It said the proposed cuts were therefore not new and would be offset
by 500 new part-time jobs while 700 temporary jobs would be firmed up
into either full or part-time employment. At the same time there was
''no question'' of compulsory redundancies or reduced services.
Around 7000 jobs had gone over the past three years but there had been
no compulsory redundancies and that remained the objective, a Royal Mail
spokesman added.
The UCW strongly denies these claims, stressing that the latest cuts
have nothing to do with the automation and mechanisation programme which
was entirely separate and the subject of current negotiations.
The ''in confidence'' management document, sent to all senior managers
by Mr Drew Munnoch, resourcing manager for Scotland and Northern
Ireland, says full-time posts will be cut by 500, with a corresponding
increase in part-time employees, and temporary staff will be reduced by
700 before March 1996.
It mentions nothing about temporary staff being offered permanent full
or part-time work but does state that 75 administrative posts and 250
managerial jobs will also be the subject of a review.
The document hints that these jobs will either be lost through natural
wastage or compulsory redundancies as funds for early voluntary
retirement were being diverted eleswhere.
It reads: ''Generally EVR/redundancy has now been removed as a
management tool and can no longer be offered when implementing any
projects.
''With the only exceptions being the removal of 15 night sorting jobs
in Glasgow associated with the closure of the George Square office, 20
in Belfast and the tail end of the closure of the Perth sorting office,
all remaining monies allocated to the divisional EVR kitty have now been
put aside to help offset the service delivery overspend for the year.''
The Scottish divisional officer of UCW, Mr George Robertson, said last
night that the union was angry at Mr Munnoch's memo dated September 12,
which came their way after management had refused to discuss manpower
issues with them at a meeting on September 26.
The age profile of the workforce was such that these latest proposals
could not be dealt with solely through natural wastage; and with a block
on voluntary redundancy enhancements, compulsory redundancies appeared
inevitable.
He did not rule out industrial action in the event of compulsory
redundancies.
Even without action he felt that postal services, which were already
under severe strain, would suffer.
* Knoll Pharmaceuticals is to cut more than 260 jobs among former
Boots staff. A hundred will go at the firm's chemicals manufacturing
plant in Beeston, Nottinghamshire, and 165 among research and
development staff in Nottingham.

<HEADLINE>Bosnia battle threatens fragile truce. Serbs bid to retake town</HEADLINE>

THE president of Bosnia warned last night that the day-old ceasefire
was already in trouble because of continued fighting around a key town.
Muslim President Alija Izetbegovic, in Vienna, said the Serbs had
launched a bid to recapture Sanski Most, taken by the government side
hours before the truce started.
''I think that this news is really putting at stake the ceasefire and
the agreement on the ceasefire. We will have to respond to it if it does
not stop,'' he said.
As Bosnian army and Serb forces fought artillery duels for control of
the strategic town, one witness said: ''There is definitely no ceasefire
there.''
For the Bosnian Serbs, army chief General Ratko Mladic sent a formal
letter of protest to UN forces.
''It is obvious that the Muslim side does not respect any ceasefire
agreement and seriously threatens the peace process and provokes
wide-scale conflict,'' he said.
The Sanski Most area has this week seen the most violent end-game in
the Bosnian war and has left Muslim and Croat troops close to the Serb
stronghold of Banja Luka.
In Sarajevo, the capital, a single missile fired about two hours into
the ceasefire hit a block of flats. No-one was hurt.
UN spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Chris Vernon said: ''Militarily it is
unrealistic to expect that any two armies along a 1000km confrontation
line who have been in close contact are going to be able to disengage
themselves within a few hours.''
People strolled in the streets of Sarajevo, apparently feeling safe
from gunfire, but a UN convoy was forced to abandon an attempt to carry
aid from Sarajevo to Gorazde because of mines and landslides.
Bosnian government and Serb officials met at Sarajevo airport for the
first meeting of the joint ceasefire commission. They discussed ways of
monitoring the truce, including defining the confrontation line.
The ceasefire is due to last 60 days and peace talks are supposed to
begin on October 31 in the US.
Despite the continued fighting, Mr Izetbegovic said he believed the
truce would hold.

RUDYARD Kipling's anthem to the stiff upper lip, If, was last night
voted the nation's favourite poem after the first nationwide telephone
poll to coincide with National Poetry Day.
After one of the most remarkable displays of interest in poetry, If
polled twice as many votes as its nearest rivals, The Lady of Shalot by
Alfred, Lord Tennyson, and The Listeners by Walter de la Mare.
The result was announced on BBC1 by comic actor Griff Rhys Jones who
presents The Bookworm programme.
He said: ''The enormous response to the poll, and the wide range of
poems chosen, shows that we are truly a nation of poetry lovers. These
results are a victory for the poems we learned at school.''
Votes were cast for more than 200 authors and nearly 1000 poems with a
total of more than 7500 calls to the hotline which opened on Saturday
and closed at noon yesterday.
Kipling was also voted the nation's favourite poet ahead of W B Yeats
and William Wordsworth.
Daisy Goodwin, executive producer in the BBC music and arts
department, said: ''If was Marie Curie's favourite poem. It is on office
walls all around the country. The poem is even being used by business
schools to train modern managers.
''I think the choice of If reflects the nation's longing for a leader
who can keep his head while all around are losing theirs . . . I hope
that the politicians are listening.''
Chris Meade, director of the Poetry Society who launched the day,
said: ''I'm delighted that such a range of poems was voted for,
including many by living writers, but the winning poem was always likely
to be a traditional verse.
''If is an all purpose disaster repair kit: a stirring hymn to the
stiff upper lip; catchy, cumulative words which lift the spirits and
call us to action -- poetry with a purpose.''
Celebrities such as Terry Waite, Felicity Kendal, Annette Crosbie,
Kriss Akabusi, and John Cole each read a favourite poem during the week
to encourage the voting and they have all been amazed by the success.
Seamus Heaney, this year's winner of the #655,000 Nobel Prize for
Literature, said he was pleased with the idea of National Poetry Day as
a ''festive'' occasion to celebrate the art.
As the national celebration of verse continued, the #10,000 Forward
Poetry Prize for a best collection was won by Sean O'Brien for Ghost
Train, which contains a poem about Manchester United footballer Eric
Cantona.
The #5000 prize for best first collection went to Jane Duran, for
Breathe Now, Breathe, and best individual poem prize of #1000 to Jenny
Joseph for In Honour of Love.
Publisher William Sieghart, founder of the Forward Poetry Prizes and
National Poetry Day, said: ''Sean O'Brien is a poet who is very much
part of the current renaissance in poetry. This is his fourth book and
all the judges thought that, in it, he consolidates his technical
skills, his political and historical concerns, humour, and rich
language.
''It is also a pleasure to see an established female voice, such as
Jenny Joseph, providing a poem which the judges find fresh, memorable,
and moving.''
The prizes are the most valuable for poetry in the UK and were founded
by Forward Publishing four years ago.
The top 10 favourites in the National Poetry Day poll were:
1. If, by Rudyard Kipling.
2. Lady of Shalot, by Alfred, Lord Tennyson.
3. The Listeners, by Walter de la Mare.
4. Not Waving but Drowning, by Stevie Smith.
5. Daffodils, by William Wordsworth.
6. Ode to Autumn, by John Keats.
7. The Lake of Innisfree, by W B Yeats.
8. Dulce et Decorum, by Wilfred Owen.
9. Ode to a Nightingale, by John Keats.
10. He Wishes for the Cloths of Heaven, by W B Yeats.
The top poets were:
1. Rudyard Kipling.
2. W B Yeats.
3. William Wordsworth.
4. Alfred, Lord Tennyson jointly with Walter de la Mare.
6. John Keats.
7. Wilfred Owen.
8. W H Auden.
9. Stevie Smith.
Another leading writer held his first publicised reading in London
yesterday since going into hiding after the fatwa issued by the late
Ayatollah Khomeini seven years ago.
Salman Rushdie signed books in the bar of the Royal Court Theatre in
Sloane Square, London. He said: ''It has been wonderful to meet my own
readers. For a long time it has not been possible''
Rushdie, author of Satanic Verses, has relaxed his security after Iran
recently indicated it would not execute the fatwa.
Passports had to be shown to get into the reading, attended by around
130 people who heard Rushdie read from his new book, The Moor's Last
Sigh, at the pre-paid event.
Police installed two metal detector arches in the foyer. Five
uniformed officers stood guard around the theatre.

THE planned Tory revival faltered yesterday on a key General Election
issue, law and order.
No sooner had Home Secretary Michael Howard and Scottish Secretary
Michael Forsyth announced tough new anti-crime policies, than they were
criticised by senior judges on both sides of the border.
Today the Prime Minister faces this additional problem when he has to
inspire his party for an attempt at a fifth term in Government, against
the odds. If the judges are critical of law and order measures, the
Tories' attempt to win back their supporters is severely undermined.
Last night in Blackpool the Home Secretary's Cabinet colleagues were
disconcerted by a ''bungling'' exercise. Mr Howard was warned by his
colleagues at a Cabinet Committee meeting last Monday that his proposals
had been insufficiently considered.
As reported in The Herald they felt they were being ''bounced''.
Lord Chief Justice Taylor yesterday duly endorsed this opinion. No
sooner had the Home Secretary announced his proposals than Lord Taylor
of Gosforth warned that longer sentences would not deter career
criminals.
''Long sentences, sometimes very long sentences, are necessary in some
cases to protect the public. But I do not believe that the threat of
longer and longer periods of imprisonment across the board will deter
habitual criminals,'' he said.
''What deters them is the likelihood of being caught, which at the
moment is small.''
Two former Masters of the Rolls added their condemnation. Lord Denning
attacked the proposal that mandatory life sentences should be
automatically passed on certain offenders. ''This could be a contest
between Parliament and the courts which would be most undesirable,'' he
said.
Lord Donaldson, who succeeded Lord Denning, said: ''I am bothered
about this mixing of penal policy with party politics.'' He added: ''As
far as mandatory life sentences, I am very bothered indeed that people
should be delivered into the hands of the Home Secretary.''
Scottish judges are traditionally more reluctant than their English
counterparts to become involved in political controversy. However The
Herald understands there is some surprise that the Government is again
talking about a change in a law only two years old which introduced
remission for some categories of prisoner after half of their sentence
had been served.
Mr Forsyth is now saying that the period of remission for good
behaviour would be ''modest, much less than the one-third to one-half
automatically available at present''.
Some judges are also irritated at being blamed for decisions which are
the responsibility of the Government. One said recently: ''When I send
someone to prison for life I'm not the one who let him out. It's the
Secretary of State who lets him out.''
Tories at the Blackpool conference, meanwhile, were bemused by Lord
Taylor's statement.
This left the Home Secretary desperately trying to restore his law and
order initiative. ''The Lord Chief Justice is entitled to his opinion.
Most police officers take a different view. In our democracy it is for
Parliament to decide.''
Mr Major today also has to handle an economic situation in which
inflation has taken a sharp upturn to 3.9% -- the highest for three
years. Chancellor Kenneth Clarke yesterday promised that a Tory
Government would cut taxes and the Tory faithful gave him a standing
ovation led by the Prime Minister at his side. But the rise in inflation
put a damper on expectations of Mr Clarke's Budget next month.
This is another vital issue that the Prime Minister will have to cope
with today. Last night the Tories were less than enthusiastic about a
series of policy announcements they have been given by Ministers over
the last four days.
The Home Secretary's setback on the vital Tory issue of law and order
has left them needing further reassurance from the Prime Minister.
The Cabinet dispute about Mr Howard's proposals on Monday are being
fulfilled. Last night in Blackpool an emergency meeting of Mr Major's
closest confidantes was being called to try to resolve how he addresses
this new problem today.
Lord Justice Taylor's intervention on the Home Secretary's proposals
has put the Conservative spin-doctors in a spin. They were banking on
the Home Secretary's announcements to regain for them the political
initiative on the issue.
Today this initiative appears to remain in the hands of Labour leader
Tony Blair.
Mr Forsyth's announcement on cutting current levels of remission for
prisoners means the prison population in Scotland -- already one of the
highest in Europe -- is bound to soar. Mr Forsyth insisted that as the
primary duty of any Government was the safety of its citizens this was
''a price worth paying''.
0 Most of the measures had been flagged up in advance, but the
slashing of remission -- currently 50% on sentences under four years and
33% for longer terms -- came as a surprise. He envisaged a new rate of
no more than 15% remission and it would have to be earned by even better
behaviour by prisoners.
He stressed that the rule change would be carried out only after
consultation and would apply only to sentences after that date. It would
not apply to existing prisoners.
His latest proposals include:
* A new role for the National Criminal Intelligence Service and for
the Security Service.
* Extending the power of confiscation of assets which currently
applies to drugs offences to other areas of organised crime.
* Tighter control of high risk offenders after release.

A MURDER hunt was launched yesterday after four members of a family
were found dead at a house.
The grim discovery was made after police went to the house in
Islington, north London, after receiving a 999 call. The call was
abandoned before they knew what it was about, but it was traced.
The officers broke into the property, in Dagmar Terrace. Police named
the victims as John and Vivien Trant, a married couple in their 60s,
their daughter, Sophie Adadour, 32, and her 16-month-old girl, Amina.
Mrs Adadour lived near the house where the bodies were found. A
post-mortem examination will be held today.
Miss Ann Webber, a friend, said the Trants were travel guides who took
coachloads of tourists around London and the South-east. ''They were
very hospitable people, very kind and outgoing but at the same time
quiet.''
Mr Leslie Prince, 33, a lifelong friend of the family, said they had
lived in the three-storey terraced Victorian house in a cul-de-sac for
most of their lives.
He spoke of how he felt ''sick'' when he heard of the killings, and
described Sophie as a ''very lovely person''.
Sophie, one of three daughters of similar ages, was a midwife at the
Whittington Hospital, Archway, north London, but is believed to have
been working at another London hospital.
Last night no arrests had been made.
