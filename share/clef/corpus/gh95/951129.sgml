THE Budget raised more questions about prospects for the next General Election
than it answered. The Chancellor failed to come out with his guns blazing as
many had predicted. The prudent spread of proposals for both spending and
taxation seems to offer a little to most, but not the great battle cry that
many of his own Conservative foot soldiers would have liked.
What may now be clear, however, is that the Tory Party has decided its best
hope for an election victory lies in its timing. This was a Budget that
suggested more than ever that Mr John Major would like to hold on until the
last possible moment - May 1997. If the Tories can hold out, that means another
Budget next year and a further opportunity to restore trust and confidence in
the Conservative Party.
The spread of tax cuts, allowance increases, and spending increases on key
services point to an incremental approach to winning back support. There is no
quick fix in this Budget. Nor could there have been because consistent evidence
has existed in recent opinion polls that spending increases were likely to be
just as popular as tax cuts.
A recent survey, carried out for James Capel and Company among previous
Conservative voters, showed that even loyal Tory supporters favoured spending
increases on health and education over tax cuts by a margin of two to one. This
key group was evenly divided over whether tax rate cuts or increases in tax
allowances would be better.
Mr Kenneth Clarke has tried to address each of these concerns to some degree.
But the previous Tory voters, who have now ditched the party, favoured spending
increases over tax cuts by a massive nine to one. The modest increases in
public spending may not be enough to win them back.
A more subtle strategy for the Tories may lie in the hope that lower interest
and mortgage rates could be the key to winning back voters' confidence and
trust. This Budget keeps the possibility of lower interest rates clearly in the
picture.
Yet two events loom so large in the minds of British voters that this Budget
may be too little, too late. The ERM crisis of 1992, and the subsequent tax
rises equivalent to 7p on the basic rate of income tax, destroyed key elements
in keeping Tory support solid. After the ERM crisis, the Tories lost the
initiative to Labour over which party was viewed as being more competent to run
the economy. Tax rises, especially after the promise of no increases during the
1992 General Election campaign, have restricted the ``feel good factor'' and
accompanying feelings of optimism about the economy.
As a result, the Tories are struggling to regain lost ground. Tax cuts may
reverse pessimism about family financial circumstances but the key ingredient
of trust on running the economy will not return overnight.
Yet it could be argued that this Budget does offer a possibility of a greater
degree of trust in the Government's handling of economic affairs. It could even
be described as a ``listening'' Budget. While the clamour in certain sections
of the media might have been for headline tax cuts of perhaps as much as 3p off
the basic rate, many voters' concerns are for public services as well as for
some evidence of action to reverse unwelcome tax increases.
What then is the likely impact of this Budget over the coming year? It
certainly is not going provide a significant improvement in the Conservatives'
electoral strength immediately. Labour's lead is too wide for any swift hope of
a Tory revival. What is more likely is that the combination of factors included
in the Budget will give a boost to middle income voters who are the key
constituency that the Tories need to win back. The changes in direct taxation
still tend to favour these and higher earning groups.
Voters tend to use only a short-term memory, perhaps of around one year, in
their assessment of the economy. As the effects of a modest tax-cutting Budget
build up, perhaps boosted by lower interest rates, the expectation will be
that, by the end of 1996, voters' perceptions of the Tories performance will be
greatly enhanced and that the memory of previous tax increases will fade.
Middle-income Tory voters with mortgages who have defected or abstained in the
last two years are the key to a possible Conservative success. Win this group
back and Mr Tony Blair will find life increasingly difficult. Mr John Redwood
described this Budget as a ``down payment''. Many voters are likely to agree.
The full test is yet to come.
While some commentators might have considered that only a Budget which slashed
income tax rates was ``political'', it might be the case that yesterday's
Budget was the only real political Budget that Mr Clarke could have come up
with.

HOPES of a cut in interest rates before Christmas were back in the melting pot
last night after the City was taken aback by the public borrowing forecasts
announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, in his Budget
statement.
The Public Sector Borrowing Requirement for the fiscal year to the end of March
is now expected to be #29bn, much higher than the #21.5bn forecast in last
year's Budget.
Even worse was the #22.5bn forecast for the new tax year beginning in April.
This had been pencilled in at #13bn last November.
The slowdown in economic activity is hitting the Government's revenues. The
City had been prepared for the PSBR figures to be revised up. But the extent of
this came as a shock, especially as Mr Clarke limited his net tax cuts to just
over #3bn, much less than the #4bn to #5bn that had been anticipated.
Gilts and sterling both fell after the Chancellor indicated how much he would
require to borrow over the next two years. The price of Government stock
dropped by three-quarters of a point from the levels before Mr Clarke took his
place at the Despatch Box.
Sterling retreated from DM2.2196 to DM2.2162 on the news and continued to drift
lower in North American trading. The trade weighted index fell 0.3 points to
82.9, just 0.4 points above its all-time low.
By contrast the stock market, which had become increasingly nervous before the
Budget, retrieved some of its losses after the Chancellor ruled out a windfall
tax.
Drinks and gaming shares mostly benefited from the Budget measures, which cut
some excise duties and froze the duty on wine and beer. The FTSE-100 share
index ended the day down 0.2 points at 3648.8, well above its low point of
3636.1.
Adam Cole, UK economist at City stockbroker, James Capel, said the PSBR figures
were disappointing and the Chancellor should have done more to cut public
spending.
As a result there was less scope for an early reduction in interest rates, and
any cut was more than ever dependent on the performance of sterling and what
Germany and the US did. ``I am not so optimistic as I was,'' he added.
The Bundesbank and the US Federal Reserve Board are both thought to have the
scope to cut rates, with the Germans expected to lead the way with a reduction
tomorrow.
Mr Clarke meets the Governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George, on December
13 to decide monetary policy. Had the Chancellor been able to confine his PSBR
forecast for next year to the City's consensus forecast of #20bn, he might have
been able to force through a cut in rates. The prospect of this was receding
last night.
Eyebrows were also raised at some of his economic assumptions. He cut his
forecast for this year's growth rate from 3% to 2.75% and then increased next
year's figures from 2.75% to 3%.
Independent economists were susprised at the strength of his growth forecasts.
If they turn out to be too optimistic it could further exacerbate his
difficulties over public borrowing.
Some economists said that a reduction in rates would be needed if activity was
to pick up next year. The Bank of England, however, might argue that if the
economy was to grow at above its trend rate of 2.25% then there was no need for
rates to be reduced.
The Treasury is expecting the growth in consumer spending to increase from
2.25% this year to 3.5% next year. It also expects underlying inflation to fall
from 3% in the final quarter of this year to 2.5% by the end of next year. This
would be in line with the Government's own inflation target for the end of the
Parliament.

EVEN the dismal science of economics has to give reality a passing nod now and
then. Chancellor Clarke, bluff as an auctioneer of fine second-hand motor
vehicles, recites the happy mantras with the best of them, but he knows where
rhetoric ends and the real world begins.
``Spectacular efficiency savings,'' he said; ``policies of change''; ``popular
capitalism''; ``a property-owning democracy''; ``the enterprise centre of
Europe''. Yet even as these visions swam before the eye, it was clear this
Budget was just another small skirmish fought over Middle England, and one,
moreover, launched by a Chancellor so hemmed in by dismal facts he could
neither galvanise his party nor put Labour to flight.
With its close attention to privatised care, small businesses, employee share
options, and the like, Clarke's Budget was precisely as class-specific as you
might expect. This is not a Chancellor who lies awake at night wondering how to
defeat poverty or rejuvenate the inner cities, rather one who ponders how to
win back the flocks of middling sorts who have strayed in Mr Blair's direction.
They're still worried about the NHS? Chuck them a billion. Law and order? Order
up a few more bobbies. Schools? Give them something - but not too much. And if,
in a country in which 60% of the workforce now lacks true job security, they
still need a spoonful of sugar, try a penny off the basic rate and hope they'll
forget about indirect taxes.
In truth, this was tinkering, a little of everything and great deal of nothing.
Clarke may put his faith in 3% growth (he and Gordon Brown have a panacea in
common, if nothing else) but the markets see a PSBR that refuses to lie down
and die. And on past form predictions of zero borrowing will be like snow unto
a dyke come the millennium.
Only a suicidally-loyal Tory MP could imagine that this was an election-winning
prescription. There are few things more poignant than a politician who can't
scrape together the price of a bribe, and the stubborn truth is that, on the
day, Clarke simply did not have the wherewithal to buy his party out of trouble.
Then again, this dull Budget may have marked the real end of the Conservative
adventure. Having shifted so much of the country's burden on to consumption
taxes like VAT, it is now near-impossible for a Tory Chancellor to dazzle the
voters with the money he is putting back into their pockets ``to spend as they
like''. The old shell game doesn't play any more. Or as Blair correctly said,
people have caught on: what goes in one pocket leaves from the other.
All the signs are that Middle Britain, if such a place really exists, neither
wants nor needs a comfort blanket. The Budget does not address the real fears
glibly mis-named ``the feelgood factor''; it does not encourage anyone to
believe their home, job, or old age is secure.
It is neither Thatcherite revolution, with its fanatic self-belief, nor decent
one-nation Toryism: the whiff, distinct and unmistakable, is of low-grade
expediency.
Business will be content, not ecstatic. The whisky trade wins a measure of
simple justice; the privatised utilities escape to pillage again another day.
Property-owning democrats will discover, meanwhile, that the doubling of the
upper assets limit for long-term care is irrelevant when your home is your only
asset; single mothers and those under 25 trying to achieve an independent life
will find that Tory morality comes brutally cheap.
The rest of us might ponder why, with the economy going so well, a quarter of
taxpayers earn only enough to qualify for the 20% band. If this is something to
boast about, the pickings are slim indeed: paid so little, how do they afford
all those VAT-rated goods? If there was a philosophy underlying all this you
could describe it as the conviction that Government could be run as a business
and that, therefore, it might as well be handed over to business.
Clear from Clarke's speech was the idea that much of what was once the
responsibility of elected representatives should be farmed out to private
enterprise, that governments should do less governing.
Why, then, should anyone applaud a Chancellor who boasts of what he isn't going
to do, and who promises what we know he can't deliver? Tories will have hoped
for much more; the rest of us (that growing band) probably expected nothing
less.

Father John Conway, 64, Parish Priest at St Flannan's Roman Catholic Church in
Hillhead Road, Kirkintilloch, near Glasgow.
Budget hopes: Father Conway, who estimated that as many as 30% of young people
in some parts of Kirkintilloch were jobless, is particularly concerned about
unemployment and homelessness. He said this had lead to a lack of self-worth,
the breakdown of family life, and abuse of alcohol and drugs, and crime. He
would have liked the Chancellor to announce that the Government intended
devoting more resources to job creation and that cash-strapped local
authorities would be capped less and allowed to invest more in housing. He said
political expediency would inevitably be a factor in the Budget - ``there are
always a few carrots before a general election'' - but added that genuine
concessions to young people and the elderly and greater support for
professionals such as teachers was more important than short-term tax cuts.
Budget reaction: Father Conway described it as ``a cautious but disappointing
budget with no reference to unemployment or the long-term care of pensioners''.
He said he believed what Mr Clarke had given in education could have been much
better. He said the Budget was as he expected born of political expediency - Mr
Clarke did not want to ``rock the boat'' before the next General Election - and
that the average family would not be much better off as a result.

SECRETARY of State Michael Forsyth last night praised a Budget that delivered a
27p cut in whisky duty and tax cuts for all Scots as ``tangible proof'' of the
benefits of Scotland's place in the Union.
However, Labour claimed the Scottish Secretary failed to protect the country's
interests by accepting a 2.1% cut in next year's Scottish Office budget,
despite presenting himself as ``Scotland's man in the Cabinet''.
Mr Forsyth said: ``The Chancellor will be the toast of Scotland tonight and I
am delighted he has responded to the representations to cut the tax on Scotch
whisky. He has done us proud and the industry which is so important to jobs,
exports, and our national prosperity will be delighted.''
He emphasised that next year's Scottish budget would be the ``highest ever'' in
cash terms, adding: ``My budget represents an average #2838 per person next
year, well over a third more than the equivalent provision in England.
``It is tangible proof of the benefits to all Scots of our present
constitutional position within the Union.''
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson dismissed his interpretation. ``The
financial settlement for Scotland confirms that spending will be cut in real
terms,'' he said.
``Scots will have to pay the price of the Tories' economic failure through
poorer quality public services.
``The Secretary of State has clearly failed to protect Scotland from the
Treasury hawks. This Budget gives the lie to his claim that he is Scotland's
man in the Cabinet.''
He added: ``Today's `7p up, 1p down' Budget will not alter the fact that Scots
families are still worse off under the Tories and better off with Labour.
People are still #670 a year worse off after this Budget.''
He added: ``People in Scotland's rural areas will suffer from the rises in
petrol duties.''
Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond accused Mr Clarke of reinforcing
the unfairness of previous Budgets. ``Instead of the Budget for growth, jobs,
and social justice demanded by mainstream Scotland, we have the start of the
Tory tax drive at middle England,'' he said.
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace criticised the Chancellor for
failing to do anything to help Scotland's education system in what he described
as a ``Tory Save Our Seats Budget''.
He said: ``Last year, with a lower prediction for borrowing, the Government
said it was unable to cut taxes. This year, with higher predicted Government
borrowing, the Chancellor has cut taxes, bowing to back-bench pressure in a
desperate bid to save their seats.''
The opposition parties were unanimous in dismissing the cut in whisky duty as
an overdue reversal of previous increases.
Mr Robertson called it a ``humiliating U-turn'' that ``comes too late for those
workers in the whisky industry who lost their jobs as a result of last year's
tax hike''.
Mr Wallace said: ``The Chancellor has simply reversed the tax he imposed last
year in a fit of pique. He has accepted the argument for lower duties but has
not been bold enough to will the means''.
Mr Salmond said the cut was inadequate. ``The Chancellor has merely cancelled
the rise the Tories imposed in January,'' he added. ``He should have reduced
duty by 10% as the SNP proposed. This would have given the industry the boost
it so desperately needs.''
The leading Scottish Conservative who advocated a windfall tax on privatised
utilities yesterday conceded that the companies would now take action to avoid
any future attempt to claw back their profits.
Mr John Godfrey, the Perth and Kinross candidate who led the economic debate at
the party conferences in both Glasgow and Blackpool, said he stood by the view
that excessive profits should be returned to consumers but said it was
``ridiculous'' for Labour to assume that the ``utility cash pile'' would be
there by the time of the next General Election.
Mr Godfrey said: ``Having had a narrow escape this time, the companies
concerned will be all the keener to tax-plan the surplus away over the next
year.''
His remarks were seized on by Mr Salmond who said Mr Godfrey had ``blown the
gaffe'' on Tory tax anomalies, with the utilities being given a yellow card
warning them to take action to avoid future taxation. He claimed both the
Government and Labour should have looked at SNP sugestions to make permanent
cuts in standing charges for pensioners.
Scots Tory chairman Sir Michael Hirst called the Budget ``sensible and
balanced'' - a description which was used as a criticism by opponents.
Sir Michael insisted that the elderly, savers and the less well off would
benefit.
He also praised the Chancellor and Scots Secretary for responding to the pleas
of the Scotch Whisky Association by cutting duty on spirits and claimed the
average family in Scotland would be #9 per week better off as a result of the
Budget.
STUC general secretary Campbell Christie described the Budget as ``the most
socially divisive since 1988''.
He added: ``It has failed to address the fundamental problems of the British
economy. It will do little for job generation in Scotland and heralds a new
assault on public services and benefits claimants.
``This is a good Budget for someone living in a #200,000 house, driving a
vintage Rolls-Royce. It is a bad Budget if you are under 25 and homeless or
unemployed and seeking work.''

KENNETH CLARKE may not go down as Britain's greatest Chancellor, but his
antennae are so acute he could probably pick up the Princess of Wales's
mobile-phone conversations.
For weeks, the juxtaposition of economic expectation and political peril had
lain before him like a minefield. Yet yesterday he picked his way through it
with greater dexterity than that of a retreating Iraqi soldier.
Many thought it was beyond our Ken to dance to the tune of those disparate
constituencies: the electorate, the Tory back bencher, and the City. In the
event, his soft-shoe shuffle was carried out with reasonable aplomb and must
surely raise the share value of his beloved Hush Puppies. It might well, in
restrospect, do the same for the Government.
It might not have been the bravura performance of which he is capable, but it
did unsettle and surprise the Labour front bench, giving credence to the joke
circulating in Westminster that Tony Blair, after all those years, is finally
developing an attachment for Gordon Brown - it fits over his mouth.
Ken Clarke is no Harold Macmillan but there was a tinge of ``Super Mac'' -
albeit a Midlands version - in the way he teased and taunted despite having so
little in the locker. But for once the baying Opposition were akin to hungry
wolves in the desert rather than hounds round an entrapped fox as in the
debates over Europe.
Although his understanding of economic minutiae is allegedly on a par with that
of the House of Windsor on fidelity, Mr Clarke's Budget was nevertheless shrewd
and sensible. It underpinned the one great success of the Government, the
strength of the economy and the commitment to low inflation which are the
precursors to any possible feel-good factor.
But if anyone had any doubts that Mr Major intended to run this parliament to
the line and hold an election in 1997 then this should settle it.
This Budget was the prequel. The real pre-election Budget is 12 months away.
What it has done is hold the line and test the water at the same time.
According to the opinion polls, the public were keener on more public spending
in targeted areas than tax cuts. Well they got it - in the ultra-sensitive
areas of schools, hospitals, and police - note the use of the words, not
``education'', ``NHS'', and ``law and order''.
He also addressed the concerns of the burgeoning ``grey vote'' - the pensioners
who are afraid of losing everything they have worked for by seeing it gobbled
up in long-term residential care costs.
He was also able to make a concession on lower direct taxes with the 1p off
income tax, higher personal allowances, and one million taxpayers held within
the 20% tax limit. This is the area he will build on at the next Budget, which
he already has in his sights by deliberately raising the Public Sector
Borrowing Requirement for the following year by #10bn over his previous
estimate. If this does not pave the way to a 20% rate for us all by the next
election then my name is James Hewitt.
What his ``neutral'' Budget means is that by keeping the City sweet there
should be an imminent cut in interest rates, probably within the next week or
two in the run-up to Christmas. Next year, with billions of pounds expected to
be pumped into the economy when the merging of building societies releases cash
to thousands of individuals, along with extra in the Treasury coffers from
privatisations, the economy should recover from its semi-comatose state.
Further cuts in interest rates will be an additional stimulus to the economy.
This will result in a lower borrowing requirement. However, having declared
such a hefty sum, the Chancellor will be determined to use it for genuine,
swingeing tax cuts and more specific public spending.
His extra taxes on the road fund licence, petrol, and cigarettes, far from
being criticised by the public, will be welcome in this environmentally dotty
age. It is a well he will return to again.
As Mr Clarke likes to say: ``It's not all over till the fat lady sings.'' Or,
even, a portly Chancellor.

<HEADLINE>Blair hails milestone on the Tories' road to defeat</HEADLINE>

LABOUR leader Tony Blair last night branded Chancellor Kenneth Clarke's package
as the ``7p up, 1p down Budget'', and said it was another milestone on the
Tories' road to electoral defeat.
He described reaction on the Tory benches as ``the shortest-lasting cheer we
have witnessed'', and added: ``If this was supposed to relaunch the
Conservative Party, it will fail.''
A clearly angry Mr Blair told the House that the British people were not
novices in dealing with the Tories, but were battle-hardened and had learned
hard lessons. He branded the Tories ``masters of political deception''.
He said: ``Over 16 years they know that what they are given with one hand is
taken away with the other. One hand may hold open the public purse but the
other is there in the citizen's pocket.''
Rounding on the Tory benches, he said they claimed income taxes had been cut
over the years, but there had been rises in other areas such as rail fares, bus
and Tube fares, rent rises, water charges, and insurance premiums. Roared on by
his own side, he said: ``They don't like to be reminded of it, but that is
Conservative policy.''
For 16 years Conservative politicians had been standing in the House saying
there would be an economic miracle, but for 16 years, living standards had been
falling compared to other countries, with Britain now down from 13th to 18th in
the economic league.
The Tories knew that a higher proportion was taken in taxation than 16 years
ago, despite the benefit of #120bn in North Sea Oil revenues, and they knew
that, whatever promises had been made before the last election, there had been
the largest peacetime tax rises in British history.
Mr Blair said there were some things in the Budget that were welcome including
improvements in long term care.
But he said: ``Taken as a whole, this is not a Budget for Britain's long-term
future. It gives with one hand what it takes with the other in a host of costs
and charges.
``It ignores completely the fundamental weaknesses of the economy. It does
nothing about unemployment, social division and decay in Britain today.
``It doesn't deal with, but avoids, the key issues on welfare.
The Labour leader accused the Government of winning power by promising not to
raise taxes and then doing the opposite.
He said: ``People after this Budget will still remain, since the last election,
as a result of the tax rises, #700 a year worse off. That is a fact, they can't
deny it.''
He said the Chancellor should have introduced a windfall tax on the privatised
utilities, but he was afraid to do so.
``Because these are the vested interest of the Tory Party, and they do not dare
challenge them . . . the case for taking on these vested interests and funding
a decent education and employment programme for our young people is
overwhelming.''
Mr Blair said there were three things the Budget had to do - tackle the
problems of the economy, increase investment and skills, and tackle the
problems of social division, but nothing of that sort had been done.
He added: ``If Tory MPs think as the result of this Budget, the inspiration
will come to the British people to re-elect them again, I can only assume they
have been out of touch for so long, they do not know what to do to get back in
touch with the electorate again.
``Tory MPs have given up on any serious vision for this country's future. They
wanted to hail this Budget as a turning point, but the British people know
better.
``It is another milestone on their road to defeat and the sooner, the better,''
he said to Labour cheers and waving of order papers.
Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown said: ``This should have been a Budget to
save our schools. It is a Budget instead, for the Conservatives, to `save our
seats'.
``We have just heard the last shot in the locker of the Tory Party. There is
nothing more.
``The message of the Government was simple and brutally clear: please can we
buy your vote for a penny cut in income tax. We've nothing further to offer
you.''
He warned: ``In deciding how to respond to that offer from this Government, the
people might do well to remind themselves of an old Russian proverb, borne out
in this Budget: free cheese only comes in mousetraps.''
Mr Ashdown said Mr Clarke had produced the tax cut by a ``sleight of hand'', by
increasing borrowing, risking the economy's long-term future.

IT WAS to be the Budget where Kenneth Clarke would relegate thoughts of
economic statesmanship to more pressing political considerations.
Not for him the historic symbolism of the battered red box this year. Rather
the looming judgment of the thousands of black boxes into which the electorate
will deliver their final verdict on the Government within the next 18 months.
The Chancellor, we were told, was set to stuff our pockets with pound notes in
a blatant last-ditch attempt to buy our votes for a fifth successive Tory
victory. However, although there were tax cuts, yesterday's package was modest,
even mean in places. Tony Blair called it the 7p up-1p down Budget, a reference
to the thumping tax increases in the last three Budgets.
However, was it also the statesmanship in - opportunism out Budget?
For the Tory Party's natural constituency - the middle England, Scotland, Wales
and Ulster the Chancellor says he is targeting - the net effect of the income
tax changes and the rise in petrol and other duties leaves them with up to #450
extra in next year's household piggy bank.
Enough for an off-season week for two in Benidorm perhaps. Or a rock-bottom
personal computer for the kids. That does not look, on the face of it, the kind
of electoral bribe which might assuage years of middle-class unease over
negative equity, job insecurity, and the evaporation of inheritance hopes when
the grandparents go into residential care.
Each time Mr Clarke came to a specific announcement - the 27p a bottle sop to
the embattled Scotch whisky industry; the doubling to #16,000 of the asset
threshold above which the elderly have to pay for their own residential care;
the rise in the inheritance tax threshold to #200,000; and that final 1p off
basic rate income tax - the numbers he produced patently underwhelmed even
those sitting on the benches behind him.
And yet the politics underpinning yesterday's ``broadly neutral'' package are
fascinating. The Chancellor knew from some distance out that a reckless
giveaway would bring down the wrath of the markets. A worsening Public Sector
Borrowing Requirement this year, which had surpassed last November's full-year
forecast within six months, had them watching his every move like hawks.
Now we know that the year-end forecast for the gap between what the Government
raises in revenue and what it spends has been revised upwards again to #29bn
for this year, an even higher figure than most City economists expected. And
even two years from now the PSBR is now expected to be #10bn above what the
Chancellor was predicting just 12 months ago.
That gap could grow if the economy starts to flirt with recession again, and
tax revenues take a further dive. On growth, the Treasury remains remarkably
bullish, forecasting a 3% rise in GDP next year at a time when some in the City
are pushing their own forecasts well below 2% and even, in extreme cases,
contemplating a mild bout of recession, as demand in Europe and the United
States cools down and stocks here are run down.
If, despite the official Red Book forecast, the Chancellor recognises that
downside recessionary risk, was this prudent Budget a prelude to greater
excitement in monetary policy? Are we and the markets being softened up for a
dramatic full point cut in interest rates, say, in the days ahead?
Because of its immediacy, its impact on mortgage costs and its kick-start
effect on a stalling economy, such a move on interest rates would have far more
impact in the real economy and on the persistent feel-bad factor in the middle
lands of the kingdom than up to #8.50 a week extra in our pockets, money which
will not start appearing until next April.
That is one reading of what the Chancellor is up to. However, this cautious
package could also mean that Ministers are now reconciled to going the full
distance, hoping against hope that Labour's public consensus will fall apart
and leaving Mr Clarke free to unveil the real giveaway next November.
However, if the Cabinet is bracing itself for the really long haul, it will,
given its perilously small overall majority, have to take its own most
recalcitrant back benchers with it.
Before yesterday they were demanding really dramatic spending cuts to pay for
substantial tax cuts. They want a significantly smaller state where people keep
a lot more of what they earn.
Whatever those back benchers say in public, yesterday's package must have
disappointed them. After all the talk of a really bloody public expenditure
round, with William Waldegrave wielding a stylish cleaver, he has managed to
carve just #3200m from the #263.4bn control total pencilled in for 1996-97 a
year ago. And that is fully accounted for in the #3200m cut in next year's
contingency reserve.
Additional resources for schools, hospitals and the police were highlighted in
the Chancellor's speech. However, there are modest increases elsewhere too.
Big losers among the spending departments, apart from defence, housing and the
non-schools side of education and employment are hard to find.
The Chancellor will try to persuade them that he is on course to get public
spending below the 40% of GDP threshold by 1997-98. He will claim that the
private finance initiative is at last on track for take off, with #14bn worth
of contracts to be let by early 1999. He will insist that the welfare monster
is now under control. But will they believe him?
In this Budget, Kenneth Clarke has behaved as if he really believes in a
balance between personal incentives and a State which still provides for basic
needs. He may be planning a big and early cut in interest rates.
He and John Major may be in this for the long haul. Is he also, in an age when
the currency of politics has been devalued in the public mind, trying to
reassert some sense of principle and statesmanship? And, in one small corner of
his mind, could he also be contemplating an election already lost and,
thereafter, a fight for the soul of the Tory Party?
As I said, the politics of this grudging Budget are far more fascinating than
the economics.

q.Don't die before April 6. You relatives won't be able to benefit from the
increase in inheritance tax exemption from #154,000 to #200,000.
q.Go and fill up your car at Sainsbury's and Tesco's. They are both holding
their petrol prices until after the weekend.
q. Roll your own fags. Hand rolling tobacco escaped the Chancellor's clamp down
on smoking which pushed up the price of a packet of cigarettes by 15p.
q.Trade in your car for an old banger to avoid the new #140 tax disc -
increased by #5. Cars and motorcycles over 25 years old are exempt to help
owners of vintage and classic vehicles.
q.If strong cider is your tipple, start stocking up soon to avoid the 8p a pint
increase from next October.
q.Unlucky lottery players may think about returning to doing the pools or
having a flutter on the horses thanks to a reduction in betting duty - one
prediction that escaped Mystic Meg's crystal ball. Chancellor Clarke said he
was cutting pools betting duty by 5% from November. And Littlewoods was
delighted, saying the savings would be spent on promotion and prizes. Pools
firms have been pleading for help over the past year because of the damage the
National Lottery has done to the industry. In August, Littlewoods said it was
closing an office in Cardiff with the loss of 320 jobs as a result of
competition from the lottery.
q.Hang on before fixing your mortgage as all the experts are now forecasting an
early cut in interest rates to meet Mr Clarke's optimistic economic growth
target.
q.Don't worry if you are facing redundancy - Mr Clarke said he never was
planning to tax the first #30,000 of your pay-off as many pundits had suggested.
q.Top up your bank and building society deposit accounts where the tax rate is
going down from 25% to 20%. ``This change makes deposit-based saving more
attractive in terms of taxation than share-based products,'' said Building
Society Association director-general Adrian Coles.
q.Celebrate the forthcoming income tax reductions with a bottle of whisky,
which will be 27p a bottle cheaper. Tesco is aiming to cut the price of a
bottle of Scotch by 27p from today. Sainsbury's says prices will fall from
Friday and Asda is promising to undercut all its rivals.

MOTORISTS are the Budget's biggest victims, with 19p extra on a gallon of
petrol and Scotland's rural drivers paying even more, the AA said last night.
Highlands and Islands Enterprise added to the warnings about how rural
communities would be affected, claiming that Budget tax cuts for small
businesses in the North of Scotland could be offset by increases in fuel prices.
While reductions in tax for small businesses, which comprise 90% of companies
in the area, were welcomed, increased duties on petrol and diesel were likely
to push up transport costs.
HIE's senior economist, Tracey Slaven, said: ``Many firms depend on
long-distance road transport for importing raw materials and exporting finished
goods, while the area's #500m-a-year tourism industry relies heavily on
car-borne visitors.''
The Scottish Licensed Trade Association said: ``We are appalled at the savage
increase in the cost of petrol and diesel. This really does affect Scotland and
can have a devastating result on tourism, and to residents and visitors in our
more rural areas.''
The Chancellor's increases in motoring costs are likely to cost the motorist
who does about 8000 miles a year an additional #55 per annum.
Mr Neil Greig, the AA's road and environment officer in Scotland, said: ``We
have seen petrol duty rise by more than a third in the last three years. This
has a huge effect on rural Scotland, because motorists do not benefit from the
competition between petrol retailers in the Central Belt - and with lack of
public transport many have no alternative but to use their cars.''
Environmentalists claimed the Chancellor's measures lacked imagination and
would do little, if anything, to help transport related environmental problems.
Dr Richard Dixon, head of research for Friends of the Earth Scotland, said:
``We welcome the increased duty on super unleaded petrol, but it is not enough.
It should have been banned straight away. Even motoring organisations say there
is no real benefit in using it.''
Despite the rises, Chancellor Clarke said petrol prices in the UK ``should
remain lower than in any major European country''.
However, Mr Adam Wurf, speaking on behalf of the Freight Transport Association,
said that Britain had the highest fuel duty and VAT in Europe.

CHANCELLOR Kenneth Clarke had much less scope for tax reductions than had been
widely assumed.
As a result, his Budget, much of which had been heavily leaked, turned out to
be a damp squib. He now desperately needs the Government to survive for another
year so that he has a second chance to establish his reputation as a
tax-cutting Chancellor.
The slowdown in activity is having a much bigger impact on Government revenues
than had been predicted and the public sector borrowing requirement forecasts
of #29bn for the current fiscal year and #22.5bn for the year beginning in
April were disappointingly large.
Although there are modest cuts around the wicket for the spending departments
to pay for the extra resources allocated to the priority areas of health,
education, and the police, the tax cuts announced in the Budget have been
financed by raiding the contingency reserve.
In 1996/97, this has been reduced from #6000m to #2500m.
The latest PSBR forecast for the current year is #7500m higher than the one
made in last year's Budget, and the one for 1996/97 #9500m more. Having been
caught out once by his projections, the Chancellor may have been more cautious
in this year's forecasts.
The big disappointment is that he is now forecasting a higher PSBR for 1996/97
than the one originally forecast for the current year.
The net cut in taxes (from an indexed base) amounts to #3140m and this has been
financed by comparable reductions in Government spending. Accordingly, the
Budget is broadly neutral.
The centrepiece is the 1p cut in the basic rate of income tax to 24p at a cost
of #1600m, which represents a little more than half of the total available for
tax reductions. There was no way the Budget arithmetic could ever have been
squared with the 2p reduction sought by some of Mr Clarke's hawkish back
benchers.
Indeed, there is a strong case for arguing that the Chancellor did not have
enough money at his disposal to justify the 1p cut, the first reduction since
1988. The increases in allowances and in the higher rate threshold are
niggardly. The married couples' allowance, the value of which has been savaged
in recent years, has only been indexed for inflation.
Personal allowances are being increased by #100 more than inflation at a cost
of #480m. The higher rate threshold, which had been frozen in three successive
Budgets, is only being raised by #200 more than inflation at a cost of just
#40m.
The number of 40% taxpayers is thought to have increased by 700,000 to
2,200,000 over the last six years. This was a natural constituency for Mr
Clarke to have courted and he could have done so without a substantial loss of
revenue.
The lower rate band, where tax is charged at 20p, has been increased by #500
more than indexation and will now cover the first #3900 of taxable income. This
is fine but it seems absurd to represent it as significant progress towards the
objective of reducing the basic rate to 20p. The cost is #370m.
The most imaginative proposal in the Budget is the decision to cut the tax on
savings for basic rate taxpayers to 20p in the pound. Some may say it is the
only imaginative proposal. The new savings rate is in line with the 20% tax
credited to dividend cheques and will be of substantial benefit to large
numbers of retired people.
The tax system formerly discriminated against investment income but now it has
swung full circle to discriminate in its favour. Those with savings and
investments have become a large constituency whose interests will continue to
demand the attention of future Chancellors.
At a cost of #800m, it was the second biggest measure in the Budget.
Mr Clarke was able to increase the exemption limit for inheritance tax from
#154,000 to #200,000. The cost was #130m but there will be disappointment that
he could not do more to limit the impact of this tax on families who by no
stretch of the imagination could be described as rich.
The decision to cut the basic rate by 1p as the first instalment of what looks
like being a long haul to a 20p rate tied the Chancellor's hands, especially on
allowances.
Freezing allowances in earlier years played an important part in raising the
extra revenues needed to reduce public borrowing after the ravages of the
recession.
A significant reversal of this disguised method of raising the tax take would
have required the Chancellor to be much tougher on public spending or to have
foregone the 1p cut in the basic rate.

Business incentives rate limited approval
THE Budget contained several incentives for small businesses, including a 1p in
the pound reduction in corporation tax and a lower cap on annual rate rises.
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke also reduced the qualifying age for capital gains tax
relief for selling on a business from 55 to 50.
He raised the threshold for inheritance tax from #154,000 to #200,000 and
exempted all shareholdings in unquoted companies from death duty, making it
easier to pass on small businesses from one generation to another.
The Federation of Small Businesses gave a guarded welcome to these measures but
said the tighter rate cap did nothing to redress the complaint of Scottish
businesses that they generally paid higher rates than their English
counterparts.
``We give the Budget a muted, limited welcome,'' said Mr Bill Anderson, the
Scottish secretary of the federation. ``It is not everything we hoped for but
at least some things are good.''
The standard rate of corporation tax on small businesses was reduced to 24%
from 25%, in line with the Chancellor's 1p in the pound cut in the basic rate
of income tax.
Mr Anderson, whose federation represents 80,000 small businesses in the UK,
including 8200 in Scotland, said this tax cut was ``helpful''.
There was no change in the #1m allowance against capital gains tax given to the
owners of businesses selling up on retirement. Mr Anderson said the reduction
of the qualifying age by five years to 50 would make it easier to sell small
businesses, which generally employed less than 20 people and had a turnover of
less than #1m.
However, he was scornful of the Government's measures to place tighter curbs on
business rates, despite the favourable treatment meted out to small businesses.
The Chancellor reduced the general cap on annual increases in business rates
from 10% to 7.5% in real terms with effect from April 6, 1996, but for small
firms the cap was halved to 5%.
Mr Anderson said these measures would benefit English companies, many of which
suffered a sharp increase in rateable value last year, much more than Scottish
firms, which had always paid higher rates. Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth
said the tighter caps would reduce Scotland's business rate bill by #21m over
the next three years and would benefit 74,000 small non-domestic properties in
Scotland.
He announced that poundage for Scottish non-domestic rates would be 44.9p in
the coming tax year.
But Mr Anderson said the Government was just putting ``sticking plaster'' on a
problem that often led to Scottish companies paying 50% more in rates than
their English counterparts.
Mr Anderson called for the rating system to be scrapped and replaced with a
system of progressive taxation by local authorities, based on a percentage of
company profits.
He welcomed the increase in the threshold for inheritance tax to #200,000 and
the 100% exemption granted to shareholdings in unquoted companies, most of
which were small firms.
``That allows us to hand on from one generation to another and gives stability,
not only to the owners, but also to the workforce,'' he said.
The 27p a bottle cut in duty on whisky was seen as giving a filip to small
businesses in the Highlands and Islands, where distilleries featured
prominently in the local economy.
However, Mr Anderson said the extra 3.5p a litre tax on petrol and diesel would
penalise small firms in remote rural areas. Petrol was already about 10p a
litre dearer in northern Scotland than in the densely populated central belt,
he said.

THE Chancellor was bound to emphasise the Private Finance Initiative which was
introduced two years ago but has been roundly criticised as faltering, not
least by the CBI which is undertaking its own study into how the situation can
be improved.
The aim is for private companies and organisations to help fund public sector
projects across a wide range and, at the same time, bring in their management
expertise. However, many companies have complained of excessive red tape,
delays, and, in some cases, too high a risk factor. There have also been
complaints that there has not been enough focus on key projects and heavy
initial costs.
Mr Clarke, though, argued that the initiative delivered infrastructure projects
of higher quality at a lower overall cost to the taxpayer precisely because the
private sector put its own money at risk and brought its own management skills
to bear.
He backed his case by announcing a substantial new package of privately
financed roads, five projects with a capital value totalling #500m. Full bids
will be due on December 5 for #45m water schemes in Inverness and Fort William.
A minimum of #14bn of private finance contracts is expected to be agreed by the
end of 1998/99, including the #5000m of private finance contracts on course to
be agreed by 1995/96.
For Scotland, the estimated capital spending from the Private Finance
Initiative is #140m for 1996/97, #360m for 1997/98, and #420m for 1998/99. The
total of #920m compares with a UK total of #7240m.
CBI director general Adair Turner gave general approval to the Budget but said
his organisation was concerned about the cut in public capital expenditure,
which was to be supplemented by trying to attract private investment in capital
projects under the Government's Private Finance Initiative plan.
``We will need to see the details to assess this in full. The Chancellor has
set a very aggressive private finance initiative target to counterbalance that
cut and it is up to the Government to deliver on this,'' he said.
Transport Secretary Sir George Young, commenting on the #500m extension to the
Design, Build, Finance, and Operate (DBFO) roads programme, said the national
roads network would benefit from more than #1000m of private sector investment
in DBFOs, which together delivered 37 separate schemes in the revised road
programme.

couple
with two incomes:
AS both are earning there will be two increases in personal allowances as well
as the increased married couple's allowance.
With the reduction in tax rates their overall benefit will be around #400.
Running two cars will be more expensive as well as the cost of smoking, if they
indulge.
They can continue to save through Peps and Tessas.
Low-earning couple with baby:
THE fof benefit by more than 3% should help as family credit is not taxable.
They may be able to take advantage of the inreased allowance for child care
allowing the mother to look for work.
The income tax changes will help the low earner and should ensure that tax at
only the 20% rate is paid.
Unemployed couple with children:
THE uprating of benefits should help on a general basis.
It is hoped the changes announced prior to the Budget for the long term
unemployed as well as the reductions in Employers National Insurance
contributions could open the way back to work.
Married couple on a pension:
THE increase in allowances and reductions in tax rates will help considerably
and, if they have money invested in the bank or building society, the reduction
of tax on interest to 20% will be very welcome.
The increase asset threshold when calculating who pays for residential care
will go some way to relieving worries about the future.
Married couple with two children:
WITH no additional relief on their mortgage unless interest rates fall in the
near future, any benefits will come from the income tax changes.
They will get the full benefit of the reduction in tax rates, amounting to some
#340.
No changes in airport duty at least means no added bills at holiday time.
Single man with own car:
WHILE the single man will benefit from the increase in personal allowances, the
extension of the lower rate band and the 1p reduction in the basic rate, making
him better off to the tune of #184, he will have to pay more for his motoring
and, if he is a smoker, there's the additional 15p on a packet of twenty
cigarettes.
Overall he still be better off by around #120.

BTHE British Retail Consortium, which represents 90% of the UK retail industry,
last night hailed the Budget as ``good and prudent'' for shops and their
customers.
Its director-general, Mr James May, said: ``Retailers will see positive
incentives in the Chancellor's proposals and consequently will expect customer
confidence to receive a significant boost.''
Mr Gerald Weisfeld, chairman of the recently-opened Weisfelds department store
in Glasgow, said the Budget would have a neutral effect, bordering on the
positive.
However, he believed the Chancellor could have done more to resurrect the
``feel-good'' factor, by cutting taxes more heavily or by stimulating the
housing market.
Mr Weisfeld, who founded the nationwide chain of WEW discount stores from a
single clothing shop in Glasgow nearly 25 years ago, said: ``I would have liked
to have seen 2p off (the basic rate of income) tax. However, we have got a
penny off tax so we have to be thankful for that.''
Referring to the Chancellor's failure to do anything to kick-start the housing
market, Mr Weisfeld said: ``I think everybody would have benefited. The
feel-good factor would have benefited greatly from something to boost that
particular area.''
Mr Weisfeld believed the Budget would be seen internationally as conservative,
paving the way for a reduction in UK interest rates and further tax cuts.
The British Retail Consortium said decreases in personal taxation, the freeze
in excise duties on wine and beer, the cut in duty on spirits, and the increase
in resources for town-centre security were among the measures which retailers
had pressed for and warmly welcomed.
The consortium was thankful that there had been no increase in VAT.

THE building industry felt let down last night by what it described as a lack
of direct action to help first-time buyers.
The chief executive of George Wimpey, Mr Joe Dwyer, said it was
``disappointing''.
However, he said that the general tax reduction would mean that real,
disposable income should rise for the first time in years and thereby help
confidence.
Mr Dwyer also suggested that there was still time for a Christmas present for
the industry.
``It would be of further assistance to the housing sector if interest rates
were reduced before Christmas,'' he said.
``As the Chancellor himself pointed out, houses are more affordable now than
they have been for a long time, so now is a good time to buy.''
From the selling sector, Mr Donald MacLellan, divisional sales director of
General Accident Property Services, said: ``There is really nothing at all that
would do anything to stimulate the market place.
"It would have been nice to have seen a bit more on the Miras tax relief and an
increase in the threshold for stamp duty.''
Only last week, the housing market in Scotland was described as remaining
``resolutely flat'' by Mr Fred Goodwin, chief executive of the Clydesdale Bank.
Writing in The Herald, he said it was unrealistic to expect the Chancellor to
restore Miras to its former levels, even temporarily.
``What seems more realistic would be some form of enhanced Miras relief for
first-time buyers,'' Mr Goodwin  said.
He added that such relief would be seen as a clear sign from the Chancellor
that there was ``still support for the notion of private home ownership''.

THE confirmation of a landfill levy came as no surprise to the industry since
it was first signalled by the Chancellor last November.
Mr Brian Fitzgerald, CBI Scotland's vice-chairman and the chairman of its
environment committee, was pleased that the Government had heeded its
representations to make the tax weight-based - #7 a tonne - rather than based
on value.
He predicted it would encourage the industry to consider new methods of waste
minimisation.
Friends of the Earth Scotland, however, criticised Mr Kenneth Clarke for not
making the tax cover all forms of waste disposal.
Dr Richard Dixon, FoE Scotland's head of research, described the landfill tax
as a ``missed opportunity''.
``It will have some positive effects, but also some negative effects by making
incineration more attractive, which we are opposed to for a number of reasons.
If he had imposed a waste tax, he would have encouraged the recycling of
material instead of making people dispose of it in a different way,'' he said.
He added that landfill was still relatively cheap in Scotland compared to parts
of Britain like London. A charge of #7 a tonne in London would be barely
noticed, whereas in Scotland it might well double the cost of landfill.
Mr Ian Wakelin, managing director of UK Waste, one of the country's largest
environmental service companies, said the landfill tax would act as ``an
important catalyst for waste minimisation, recovery, and recycling in the UK''.
``By setting the level of tax at #7 per tonne for most waste, the Chancellor
has dramatically raised the cost of waste disposal by landfill. Waste producers
now have a financial as well as environmental incentive to seek ways to reduce
the amount of waste which they send to landfill,'' he said.

MORTGAGE lenders expressed disappointment at Mr Clarke's refusal to stimulate
the depressed housing market and help the UK's 16 million homeowners.
Mr Clarke confirmed that mortgage interest relief would remain unchanged at the
present 15% on a #30,000 loan.
He said he had considered carefully the case for special measures to revive the
housing market but believed that none of the ``affordable proposals'' would
make any difference.
An average mortgage costs #180 a month, a figure which was much cheaper than
renting, making house purchases more affordable now than for years, Mr Clarke
said.
``I remain convinced that what the housing market needs above all is steady
growth and low inflation.''
But the Building Societies' Association said it was disappointed no specific
measures for the housing market were announced, although it welcomed the news
that interest from savings would now be taxed at 20% for basic rate taxpayers.
``It is hoped that the cut in basic-rate tax will assist the feel-good factor
and help rebuild confidence, which would in turn encourage households to take
advantage of the current excellent affordability of home ownership,'' said
director general Adrian Coles.
The UK's biggest mortgage lender, the Halifax Building Society, expressed
disappointment that Mr Clarke chose not to abolish stamp duty on house sales.
It agreed that house prices and interest rates were low, but abolishing stamp
duty would have helped confidence - an important factor in the housing market.
Peter Birch, chief executive of the Abbey National, the UK's second biggest
mortgage lender, said: ``It is too early to predict a return of the
``feel-good'' factor but this Budget should boost optimism, which will feed
through to the housing market.
``By being prudent, the Budget has also left the way open for a base rate cut
in the months ahead.''
Birmingham Midshires Building Society said it regretted Mr Clarke had chosen
not to help the housing market.
Chief executive Mike Jackson said: ``The Government's commitment to homeowners
remains extremely muted.
``The Chancellor has failed to recognise that by supporting the housing market
he would be providing a catalyst for growth by boosting employment and high
street spending, rather than opting for small tax cuts.
``We would repeat our calls for the Government to follow the lead of the
housing market and cut interest rates.''
The UK's leading home removal company, Pickfords, called the Budget a ``wait
and see'' one for home-owners.
``Pickfords is disappointed that he has taken no direct measures to stimulate
the housing market, such as abolishing stamp duty,'' it said.
``We are, however, pleased he has decided to freeze Miras rather than pursue
the Government's long-term policy of reducing it.''

STEPHEN Barrett, chairman of the Institute of Health Services Management in
Scotland, said any increase in the the NHS budget was always welcome, but
pointed out that the impact would depend on what proportion went to Scotland.
The Scottish health service allocation last year topped #4000m for the first
time, but a growth rate of only 0.6% over four years was officially predicted
at that time.
``A billion pounds is only a small proportion of the overall UK health
budget,'' said Mr Barrett.He said there was a myth about management costs in
the NHS - one of the targets for trimming set out by the Chancellor.
The British Medical Association's Scottish council accused the Government of
undermining the stability of pay in the NHS by insisting that any salary
increase for doctors would have to be funded by increased efficiency.
``Doctors already work excessive hours every day of the week in the NHS,'' said
a spokesman. ``Asking them to do more may increase the number of patients
treated but it won't save the Government any money.''

SCOTLAND is set to benefit from more than #2bn of major investment over the
next three years under the Government's Private Finance Initiative.
This was stated last night by Scots Secretary Michael Forsyth when he responded
to the Chancellor's Budget reference to a #45m water project which will provide
sewerage treatment facilities for Inverness and Fort William.
Around 51,000 people will benefit from the North of Scotland project which is
the first Build, Own, and Operate scheme of its type.
Potential contractors due to submit tenders by December 5. It is hoped to let
the contract by the end of March.
Mr Forsyth was delighted the Scottish Office was one of the three leading UK
departments pioneering the PFI ``with a major boost to capital spending and
investment in Scotland's infrastructure''.
He added: ``Our success so far in identifying and bringing forward projects
demonstrates the major contribution that the PFI will make to delivering high
quality services in Scotland.''
Major projects being considered include the new Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh -
estimated capital value #140m - M6/A74 completion (approximately #100m),
Hairmyres Hospital (#60m), and Law Hospital (#115m).

INDUSTRY's reaction to the Budget was mixed. CBI director general Adair Turner
said his organisation was pleased the Chancellor appeared to have limited tax
cuts to reductions in spending and resisted the temptation to go for excessive
tax cuts.
Public borrowing remained higher than the CBI would have liked, ``but we are
satisfied it still appears to be on a downward path''.
CBI Scotland chairman Andrew Cubie said the Chancellor's comparative
inattention to the provision of national infrastructure was disappointing.
Scottish Chambers of Commerce said the Budget would do little to boost business
or create jobs and nothing to encourage construction or tourism.
Mr Peter Dunn, acting director-general of Scottish Chambers of Commerce, said
the Chancellor should have refrained from cutting taxes and invested more in
training, business support and education.
``This is undoubtedly a Budget with slightly more good news than bad news, but
my fear is that it will do little to help businesses and virtually nothing to
create additional jobs.''
He said the 3.5p a litre rise in fuel prices would discriminate against
businesses in remote rural areas and the speeding up of the Private Finance
Initiative, which aims to finance public works with private capital, offered
``too little, too late'' to be of any real help to the construction sector.
Mr Dunn said the decision to reverse last December's increase in duty on
spirits was one of the few bright spots. He said the 27p a bottle cut would
bring ``good cheer to the Scotch whisky industry''.
His main hope was that there would be an early cut in interest rates. ``This
will have a more positive effect on business,'' he said.
Mr Geoff Runcie, chief executive of Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, dismissed the
Budget as ``pretty mediocre''.
``In all, a bland Budget without any fire - a cautious Chancellor acting under
some pretty tight restraints,'' he said.
The engineering industry in Scotland were bitterly disappointed.
The Budget had done ``absolutely nothing'' to encourage the investment culture
in plant and equipment, nor moved towards encouraging long-term investment with
allowances for longer term investors.
Mr Howard Jordan, chief executive of Scottish Engineering, said the Chancellor
had made no attempt to support industry. He had spoken of small businesses
being the seed corn of future prosperity but done nothing to nurture its
growth.
``The tax on fuel will punish the engineering industry in Scotland, which is a
major transporter of goods by road,'' Mr Jordan said.
``As Scottish companies are further from their major European markets, this is
going to be an unwelcome burden.''
TUC general secretary John Monks said that the Budget contained a hidden agenda
of big public sector job cuts. Proposed reductions in the funding of the civil
service would mean a loss of some 26,000 jobs and could hit Customs officers'
attempts to stem drug smuggling and Inland Revenue officers' fight against tax
evasion, and reduce public safety.
Mr John Sheldon, general secretary of the National Union of Civil and Public
Servant, said ``tens of thousands'' of jobs were at risk and there would be a
deterioration in every area from coastguards to social security plus longer
queues for passports and delays for driving tests.
Mr Alan Jinkinson, general secretary of Britain's largest union, Unison, said
the Budget was ``the most short-sighted policy since the Trojans let the horse
in''.
It left people more heavily taxed than they were when the Government took
office - and public services were being devasted to pay for tax cuts. Local
government would be particularly hard hit with a #4bn shortfall.
Health spending needed to increase by 2% a year above inflation just to keep
pace with rising costs and instead the Government planned just a 0.6% increase
next year and 0.1% for the following two. Added to the 17% cut in capital
spending on new hospitials, this was devastating news for the NHS, he said.

Mrs Margo Gollogly, 42, a personnel clerk at Asda's Parkhead Forge supermarket

about #14,500. The couple live in Kentallen Road, Barlanark, Glasgow, with two
of their three daughters aged 12 and 10. Margo, who has worked at the store
since it opened in 1988, earns #7500 per annum.
Budget hopes: Margo would have appreciated any reduction in income tax, but
says the Chancellor could have helped families like hers in other, ways, for
example by cutting the cost of road tax and petrol. As a smoker, she firmly
believes that the price of cigarettes has been increased too often and by too
much, and claims the Government already earns enough from taxation on tobacco
without increasing it further.
Budget reaction: Margo dismissed the 1p income tax cut as almost irrelevant and
claimed the Budget would provide no help for most working class people. She was
very disappointed by the increase on cigarettes and said the 15p rise was much
more than those imposed in previous budgets.

Budget hopes: As a homeowner, Colin would have welcomed a reduction in interest
rates and did not want to see an elimination of taxation relief on mortgages
but, as a teacher, is more concerned about public expenditure. He would welcome
anything which would enhance his son's employment prospects and would like
student grants restored to previous levels.
Budget reaction: Colin said he was very disappointed with the Budget, which he
described as a Budget for people who were in employment and relatively well off
and contained no comfort for the poor or homeless.

General Hospital, Glasgow. She is married to Brian, 35, a psychiatric nurse at
Parkhead Hospital. The couple live at Glenfarg Road, Burnside, and have two
daughters, Fiona, six, and Mairi, four. Sharon earns #16,900 per annum, while
her husband receives #15,000.
Budget hopes: Sharon would have liked to have seen the Chancellor put more
money into health care, because a lot of new equipment is paid for by staff
fund-raising and gifts rather than from the Government or NHS trusts. She would
have liked more investment in education. She said her eldest daughter had to
wait for books because there were not enough to go round the class.
Budget reaction: Sharon was ``quite happy'' with the extra #1bn allocated to
the health service but emphasised it would probably mean a very small amount to
each individual health area. She claimed that, with the tax cut and increases
on petrol and road tax, the Chancellor had given on one hand and taken away
with the other. While she recognised many people would welcome an income tax
reduction she said she would be happy to pay an extra 1p in the #, because it
would have ``no significant effect'' on pay, but could be used to provide more
funds for health and education.

SAVERS are one of the main beneficiaries of the Budget through the lower 20%
rate of tax on savings income, specifically interest from banks and building
societies, purchased life annuities, interest from gilts, corporate bonds, and
authorised unit trusts.
The new rate only applies to basic rate taxpayers and will take effect from the
new tax year next April. Those subject to higher rate tax will still pay 40% on
their interest income.
Savings income will be counted as the ``top slice'' of income. For example,
someone with #5000 of taxable income after allowances of which #500 is interest
income will pay 20% tax on the first #3900, 24% on the next #600, and 20% on
the top slice of #500 interest income.
Basic rate taxpayers will not need to take any action. Tax will continue to be
deducted at source as at present. Non-taxpayers receiving income already taxed
will be able to claim the 20% back.
However, many elderly people dependent on small pensions and interest on
savings will not see any difference because they are already non-taxpayers or
20% taxpayers. But they will no longer have to claim back the present 5% excess
on income taxed at source.
The tax cut will make it even more worthwhile for retiring members of an
occupational scheme to take the maximum lump sum allowed from their pension
benefits because a purchased annuity or interest generated by the lump sum will
be taxed at a lower rate than pension payments.
The Chancellor said the intention of the move was to reduce income tax for
those with modest savings, reward and encourage saving, and make further
progess towards a basic rate of 20%.
The reduction will go some way towards offsetting the decline in income which
savers have suffered with the general decline in interest rates in recent
years. It will also take the edge off the likely reduction in interest rates
which is widely expected shortly and mitigate the effect of lower interest
rates on annuities.
The move will help building societies which derive much of their finance from
savers. The encouragement to savers will help their cash inflow thus enabling
them to be more competitive on mortgages. However, wholesale money markets are
a more important source of finance for many societies, particularly the larger
ones.
Mr Adrian Coles, director general of the Building Societies Association, said:
``This change now makes deposit based savings more attractive. It will assist
those mortgage lenders which raise their funds primarily from retail sources,
so both building society savers and borrowers should benefit.''

Albert MacKay, 43, and his wife Marian, 49, have run the seven-bedroom Guinach
House hotel near Aberfeldy, Perthshire, for the past six years and live there
with their son, Bert, 12.The hotel has an annual turnover of between #100,000
and #130,000. The couple take very little income from the hotel, ploughing the
profits back into the business.
Budget hopes: A reduction in the 17.5% rate of VAT paid by customers on
accommodation and meals would have lead to an increase in trade. A similar
reduction in VAT paid by hoteliers on all sales would have reduced costs which
would be passed on to customers. Albert said he would welcome a reduction in
duty on alcohol. A drop in interest rates would also improve the profitability
of the business.
Budget reaction: Albert was very disappointed that there was no reduction in
VAT. This, he said, was the biggest outlay he had to make and paying 17.5% to
the taxman every quarter often made him question whether the effort he put into
his business was worth it. He was pleased that duty had been reduced on spirits
by 4% and frozen on beer and wine.

Budget hopes: Robert would have been happy to forgo tax cuts in favour of a
reduction of base rates by at least one point. He would like to have seen the
Chancellor improve the climate for investment. He had hoped the Chancellor
would do little with indirect taxation, claiming a change in the headline VAT
rate would be ``entirely wrong'' because a stable background is vital.
Budget reaction: Bob described the 1p cut in the basic rate of income tax as
politically motivated and said the Chancellor seemed not to have fulfilled any
of his hopes. The Budget was ``mildly reflationary'' and might allow a modest
decrease in base rates, but not of the significance he was looking for.

His architect's practice, which employs 12 people, works for a variety of
housing association, private housing, health care, education, and industrial

son, and two daughters aged 11 and nine, declined to reveal his annual income.
Budget hopes: From a personal point of view, David would have liked to have

to a cut in income tax, and believes this would be particularly valuable to the
elderly. From a professional point of view, he would have welcomed a reduction

building extensions and making alterations. This, he said, would have benefited
charities in particular. VAT is zero-rated on new house builds but, he pointed
out, is levied at 17.5% on extensions and alterations.
Budget reaction: David said his main concern was that the Chancellor had missed
an opportunity ``to make society a bit fairer''. He could have reduced tax on
domestic fuel instead of cutting the basic rate of tax by 1p, which would
benefit people only marginally. ``Perhaps the Chancellor doesn't realise that
the tax on domestic fuel is not popular and not terribly fair,'' he said.

Retired schoolteacher Bob Harvie, 75, who taught mathematics in Lanarkshire
schools, lives with his wife, Freda, 58, in an old schoolhouse in Coronation
Street, Carstairs Junction, which they previously rented from the local
authority and now own. The couple have two sources of income - Bob's state
pension of #105 per week, which includes a dependence allowance for his wife
who has not worked during their married life, and his superannuation pension of
about #100 a week. Budget hopes: Bob said pensioners have not shared in the
general increase in living standards in Britain and would have welcomed an
increase of about #7 per week for married couples. Bob and Freda heat their
seven-room house with oil central heating and estimate that their annual bills
amount to #700, so would have been delighted to see a reduction in VAT on
domestic fuel. Bob also said that pensioners received a #10 Christmas bonus in
the late 1970s and were still receiving #10 despite the fact that this would be
worth as much as #100 now.
Budget reaction: Bob said that, generally speaking, he did not believe people
in similar circumstances to his would see any change in their standard of
living. ``The Government's policy seems to be every man for himself with a
safety net for the poverty stricken but that should not be needed. That theory
implies people need handouts for bare subsistence and personally I find that

THE decision to cut a swathe through the Government's major roads programme and
replace it with five privately-financed road schemes worth #500m were widely
condemned as ``highway robbery'' yesterday.
In all, two-fifths of new roads - a total of 77 motorway and trunk road schemes
- have been withdrawn, representing a 33% cut in a programme which will now be
worth #8.2bn.
The RAC described the announcement as ``highway robbery'' and added that the
environmental implications of scrapping bypasses was ``frightening''.
Five new private finance-built road schemes, built under the Private Finance
Initiative, are not expected to start before 1997-98.
Last night, speculation was growing that the proposed M74 extension through
Glasgow, which was recently granted planning permission and is estimated to be
worth #100m, might be one of the five new private schemes an-nounced, but not
detailed by the Chancellor.
Friends of the Earth Scotland pointed out that the A74/M74 scheme through the
South of Scotland, the first to be carried out under the PFI, had shown that
other schemes risked costing the taxpayer more in the end of the day.
The Freight Transport Association also said the road cuts were ``highway
robbery'', as congestion for tax-paying road-users would mean ``standstill and
deliver''.
``He is allowing industry to be choked by congestion. The latest roads cuts are
almost a dead end - bad for the economy and bad for the environment,'' said Mr
Adam Wurf, a spokesman for the FTA.
``The nation has a clear and growing transport problem that wastes time and
money and causes environmental pollution. We need a multi-faceted solution -
investment in public transport, comprehensive utilisation of the existing roads
infrastructure, use of rail where appropriate.''
``But in the absence of anything else we have a clear need for improving the
roads system where it presently pinches together with continuity of by-pass
building,'' he added.
Meanwhile, Mr Richard Diment, Director of the British Road Federation, said:
``Although the Private Finance Initiative is to be welcomed it is clear that it
has been unable to replace more than a small proportion of the money lost to
road investment through public expenditure cutbacks.''
He added: ``The Chancellor has ignored the warnings from industry and business
that without an improved road system Britain's long term economic success is at
risk.''
Mr Neil Greig, the AA's roads and environment officer in Scotland, said: ``The
Chancellor has to realise that the UK economy remains roads-based and trying to
replace a national roads programme with a few privately financed roads is not
going to fill the gap. It simply defers big Treasury bills until after the
General Election.''
Meanwhile, Mr Brian Fitzgerald, vice-chairman of CBI Scotland, said his
organisation was positive about the principle of PFI, but disappointed that the
Chancellor was not pushing it through faster.
He added that it was significant that when originally announced, the PFI was
intended to be ``additional'' to public sector procurement. Yesterday, the
Chancellor had referred to it as being a replacement, he said.

LIKE all would-be conjurers Kenneth Clarke knows that you don't extract the
bunny from the topper before the audience is properly warmed up.
He understands too that there must be a few teasers preceding the big event and
that a judicious amount of sleight of hand is necessary if you don't want
anyone spotting the fact that you've substituted last year's firm and binding
predictions for a completely revised set.
Yet on the evidence of yesterday he shouldn't hold his breath for admittance to
the Magic Circle.
A modest penny off the basic rate was bound to be anti-climactic after the
frenzy of speculation. Not least on the benches behind him, where the
arithmetic currently most of concern to his colleagues is how much of a
majority they need in the bank to have a hope of retaining their current
employment.
In the light of yesterday's modest largesse, they now have to hope that they
have a sizeable number of non-smoking, whisky-loving constituents running
around in gas-powered vintage cars with aged parents about to will them
something worth around the #200,000 mark.
So Mr Moneypenny's finale proved something less than a showstopper. And the
trouble with his build-up was that there are only so many times you can try to
pull off the same tricks without the audience getting the hang of how they're
being swizzed.
Not a good idea, for instance, to keep employing lines like ``efficiency
gains''. Too many people now know that's a pretty long-winded phrase which
freely translates as cuts.
As in: ``Thanks to the efficiency gains made by your local hospital we are
happy to announce that the waiting time for your operation has been slashed to
just three months. You will be entered on this fast track waiting list just as
soon as we can find a consultant to give you an initial appointment.''
In fairness, Mr Clarke has promised another billion of public funds into the
NHS, and investment via this year's sexiest policyspeak, the Private Finance
Initiative.
It was also good to hear that school budgets would get a much needed cash
injection, just strange that this was the only brief mention of the twin
engines of any genuinely modern, competitive economy - education and training.
In fact, young people featured in this Budget largely in terms not of what they
might get to enhance their future prospects, but in how they might be
penalised. Curious, too, to understand why one of the few specific mentions of
cuts in the social security budget, which will total #5000m in all, was that of
restricting housing benefit to the under 25s.
It seems the Government continues to cherish the illusion that there is an army
of young people wilfully and unnecessarily leaving home and thereafter
acquiring ideas above their housing station.
The reality, so far as most people can detect, is that those young people in
caring homes are so reluctant to to out into the ever chillier economic winds
that their parents cannot get shot of them. Those in homes where they are at
risk, or not able to be given adequate care and nourishment, are those who make
up the increasing number of young homeless who do not require any more fiscal
kicks in the teeth.
So far as ambushes by indirect taxation are concerned, it would be nice to have
a bit of frankness. Tobacco costs are not rising because uncle Kenneth is
fretting about our lungs, and fuel duties have very little to do with a
greening of the Major Cabinet.
As for whisky! The Chancellor, casting around for a quick fix a few months
back, stuck a hasty 26p on a bottle, trying to balance a leaky budget.
It backfired spectacularly actually losing the Treasury over #50m in
revenue.Thus yesterday's cut of 27p. Net gain to whisky industry: 1p on the
bottle.
Doubtless they are grateful for mercies, even if they come in distressingly
small measures.

CHANCELLOR Kenneth Clarke claimed yesterday that he had produced a Budget that
put Britain on course to be the enterprise centre of Europe, creating more jobs
and generating the greater wealth and prosperity in which all could share.
He told the Commons that business could flourish in a secure climate of low
borrowing, low taxation, deregulation and free trade through a Budget which
controlled overall public spending while shifting more money towards schools,
hospitals and the police.
The Chancellor, who sipped malt whisky and water throughout his 68-minute
speech, said he had achieved what he described as a ``hat trick'' because the
Government had followed a consistent economic policy. ``Only we have clear
objectives and only we know how to achieve them,'' he insisted.
He said that the Budget put the Government on the path to achieving borrowing
falling to zero, public spending falling below 40% of national income,
inflation below 2.5% and a 20% basic rate of income tax.
As a result of his Budget measures, a married couple with only one earner on
average earnings with two children would pay #190 less tax. Overall, their real
take-home pay after tax would rise by around #450 next year and they would be
#700 a year better off than they were at the time of the last election.
The Budget addressed the aspirations of the people of this country in an
economically and socially responsible way, he said.
Economy
Mr Clarke said that in 1994 the economy had grown by about 4%. This was
``fuelled by the success of British exporters overseas.''
Consumer spending was on an upward trend and he predicted it would grow further
in the next two years.
He said manufacturing investment had grown by 12% over the past year and he
forecast a growth rate of 2.75% this year and 3% for 1996.
Inflation remained on course to meet the Government's target of 2.5% or below
by the end of the present Parliament.
He said he expected the Public Sector Borrowing requirement to be #29bn in the
current financial year - #7bn less than last year and #16bn less than two years
ago.
Spending plans
Mr Clarke said: ``The share of national income taken by the state in public
expenditure must be reduced to below 40% if we are to remain competitive in
today's world.''
It was essential to give the private sector more room to generate jobs,
investment and wealth.
The Government was modernising welfare so it underpinned not undermined the
economy.
The Chancellor said ``the priority areas'' where spending would be increased
included the National Health Service which would receive an extra #1bn next
year.
In addition, patients would benefit from efficiency savings - including
reductions in NHS management costs - which would bring in an extra #650m to be
ploughed back into patient care.
Privately-financed projects would bring in a further #700m of extra investment
over the next three years. Mr Clarke emphasised that this would not in any way
undermine the principle of free health care at the point of delivery.
The Chancellor announced a rise in spending on schools of #878m.
``Parents will rightly expect local authorities to carry this funding through
to school budgets and they should ask their local authorities how this extra
money will be spent on their children.''
On crime, he said money was being provided for an extra 5000 police officers
over the next three years - on top of the 32,000 increase since 1979.
Plans also allowed for an extra 10,000 close-circuit television cameras in
towns around the country.
Mr Clarke said spectacular efficiency gains were being made in the running
costs of central government.
``The cash cost of Whitehall will be #860m lower in three years' time than it
is today.
Turning to social security, he said the Government expected growth in planned
spending of around 1% a year for the next three years.
He said this represented a reduction in growth from previous expectations that
social security spending would rise by more than 3% a year.
He said Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley was to announce a futher
intensive campaign against fraud.
He also would announce measures to ensure that asylum-seekers stopped receiving
social security benefit after an unfavourable adjudication.
Other moves included steps to close the gap between single parents benefit and
those paid to other families.
A package of measures to encourage people to go out to work included a further
increase in childcare allowance in family credit from #40 to #60 a week.
He said housing benefit would be restricted for the under-25s. ``It should not
be an inducement for young peple to leave their families before they need to.''
He pledged that the measures announced in his three Budgets so far would reduce
social security expenditure by #5bn a year by the end of the century
The Chancellor said that extra money could be found for the social security
budget ``by trimming back elsewhere''.
He said efficiency savings had been found in defence while the Government
maintained its ``commitment to a strong front line''.
On the Private Finance Initiative, Mr Clarke announced a ``huge'' new package
of privately financed roads - five new projects with a capital value totalling
#500m. Full bids were due on December 5 for the #45m water project in Inverness
and Fort William.
Mr Clarke said #250m had been made available for the third and fourth bidding
rounds for the Single Regeneration Budget Challenge Fund, to help areas
including inner cities.
Over #300m of Challenge Funding would be made available to speed the transfer
of deprived housing estates to housing associations and other private landlords.
Mr Clarke said that he expected total public spending this year to be down to
42% of national income.
Spending plans for 1996-97 will be cut by over #3bn, Mr Clarke said.
Taxation
Mr Clarke said that since 1979, the Government had shifted the tax burden away
from direct taxes on income and employment towards indirect taxes on spending
and consumption.
He announced that the new Landfill tax proposed last year, a charge on the
disposal of waste in tips and old quarries, would come into effect on October
1, 1996.
It would be charged at a standard rate of #7 per tonne and a lower rate of #2
for inactive waste.
He said money raised by this tax would allow for a cut in employers' National
Insurance contributions by a further 0.2% to 10% from April 1997.
This would cut the cost of employment by #500m, making it cheaper for
businesses to create new jobs.
Petrol
Tax on petrol and diesel would rise by 3!sp a litre.
Tax on super unleaded petrol would ill be increased by a further 4p next May.
Mr Clarke said that the Government wanted to encourage further use of gas used
in road vehicles and proposed reducing the duty on them by 15%, amounting to a
5.8p cut in road fuel gases.
He expected pollution from vehicles to fall over the next few years and said
the Government would use vehicle excise duty to encourage lower emissions. This
year, therefore, the cost of the tax disc for cars would rise by #5, although
Mr Clarke said he would freeze the rate for lorries for the sixth year running.
To make sure vintage and classic car enthusiasts were not penalised, the road
tax would be exempt on all cars and motorcycles over 25 years old taking
150,000 historic vehicles out of tax.
Mr Clarke said he would cut general betting duty by 1%. This would benefit the
betting industry as well as horse and greyhound racing.
This would come into force on March 1 next year if agreement could be reached
quickly.
The Chancellor said he would reduce pool betting duty by a further 5% from
December 3.
Tobacco, drinks
A packet of 20 cigarettes would go up by 15p.
There also would be an 8p increase on a 25g packet of pipe tobacco and a packet
of small cigars will cost 6p more.
Mr Clarke said there would be no increase on hand-rolling tobacco.
Of duties on alcohol, the Chancellor said he would freeze duty on beer and wine
adding: ``Tax at a share of the cost of a pint of beer is now the lowest for
over 20 years.''
Very strong cider was under-taxed compared with other drinks and he intended to
raise its duty by 8p a pint from next October but without disturbing the rate
for ordinary ciders.
High rates of duty at home had made it difficult for the Scotch whisky industry
to press ``their excellent case'' for lower duties in other countries, Mr
Clarke said.
Scotch was one of Britain's most important exports and spirits duty would
therefore be reduced by 4%, the equivalent to 27p off a bottle of whisky.
Mr Clarke ruled out a one-off windfall tax on the profits of the privatised
utilities.
``A windfall tax would damage investment and threaten the quality of customer
service,'' he said.
``I do not intend to introduce such a tax.''
He said there also would be no changes to the rules which allow the first
#30,000 of redundancy payments to free of tax.
Increases in insurance premium tax and air passenger duty also were rejected.
Mortgage interest relief would remain unchanged for the lifetime of this
parliament.
Mr Clarke said he agreed with many housing experts that none of the affordable
proposals to revive the housing market would make any difference.
The housing market needed steady growth and low inflation above all: ``That is
what this Budget delivers.''
Mr Clarke announced help for elderly people who need care in residential or
nursing homes.
He said benefits from a range of insurance policies which provide long-term
care benefits would be exempted from tax.
``We should encourage, not penalise, people who decide to take responsibility
for themselves.''
At present, people with assets worth less than #3000 did not have to contribute
towards their care from their capital, while people with assets worth more than
#8000 received no financial support from the Government.
Mr Clarke said from April the lower threshold would be more than trebled from
#3000 to #10,000 and the upper threshold doubled from #8000 to #16,000.
``That means people in residential care who have worked hard and saved will now
keep more of their own money.''
Pensions
He said the Inland Revenue would consult on the possibility of extending the
option to take a variable pension to members of occupational pension schemes.
This could provide a larger pension in later years when people are more likely
to need long term care in exchange for a smaller pension earlier on.
Mr Clarke said Pensioners Bonds had proved a very popular National Savings
product since their introduction two years ago and announced that the
qualifying age for purchasing these bonds would be reduced from 65 to 60.
Mr Clarke said the minimum period for saving under a SAYE scheme was to be
reduced from five years to three and the minimum contribution would be halved
to #5 a month. The holding period under profit sharing schemes will also be
reduced from five to three years.
Mr Clarke introduced a new tax relief enabling companies to grant share options
to their employees up to a limit of #20,000.
``These changes go further than ever before in creating a climate in which
employee share ownership can become the norm.''
Mr Clarke announced that the cap on increases in business rates will be reduced
from 10% to 7!s%. He added: ``Small businesses will get extra help. The maximum
increase for small properties will be 5% instead of 7!s%.''
Capital gains
On Capital Gains Tax, Mr Clarke said: ``We remain committed to abolishing
Capital Gains Tax when resources allow.''
He announced that Capital Gains Tax relief would be extended by reducing the
qualifying age from 55 to 50.
``It is the mark of a Government that backs enterprise,'' he said.
The Chancellor said inheritance was now an issue for Middle Britain, and he
confirmed it was the Government's intention to scrap inheritance tax as soon as
it could be afforded.
It was a myth that only the very rich paid the tax.
The tax-free allowance on inheritance tax would be increased from #154,000 to
#200,000, reducing by one third the number paying the tax.
Income tax
Mr Clarke said on income tax he would be increasing allowances for married
couples and people receiving related allowances by #70.
In order to relieve the burden on as many of the lower paid as possible he
would be increasing the basic personal allowance by #240 - #100 more than
indexation. As a result, more than 200,000 people would be kept out of tax
compared with the indexation of allowances.
On the top rate tax band of 40%, he said that he would be raising the threshold
by #1200 - #200 more than indexation.
He said he also would be increasing the 20% tax band by a further #700 - #500
more than indexation - bringing an extra one million people into that band.
Mr Clarke said about a quarter of all taxpayers, over six million people, will
pay tax on their income at just 20p in the pound.
Now he also proposed to reduce the rate of tax on all savings income for basic
rate taxpayers to just 20%.''
About 14 million savers would gain from this change, receiving an extra #5 from
every #100 invested.
Small companies rate of corporation tax would be cut to 24%.
Mr Clarke said: ``My final proposal in this Budget is therefore to reduce the
basic rate of income tax by one penny to 24p in the pound.
``These three steps - widening the 20p band, a 20p tax rate for savings' income
and 1p off the basic rate - move us much closer to a 20% basic rate of tax for
all income.
``We have a clear commitment ot the 20p basic rate. We believe in it and we can
achieve it.''
As a result of the Budget measures, a married couple with only one earner on
average earnings and with two children would pay #190 less tax.
Overall their real take home pay after tax would rise by around #450 next year,
Mr Clarke said.
Such a family would be #700 a year better off than they were at the time of the
last General Election.
Mr Clarke said: ``My Budgets of the last two years have kept us on the course
we said we would follow.
``We have cut taxes, we are cutting taxes and when we can afford it and when it
is in the interests of the economy we will cut taxes again. Good economics is
good politics.''

KENNETH CLARKE caused a furore in July when he withdrew capital gains tax
treatment for approved share option schemes following the Greenbury Report.
Contrary to his intentions, this change hit many employees in the middle and
lower income ranges rather than the ``fat cats'' against which the tax change
was supposedly targeted.
As a result, many employees found that they would pay income tax when they
exercised their share options. Previously they would have been liable to
capital gains tax, but could minimise the liability by claiming their annual
exemption of #6000 when the shares were sold. The exemption could be doubled if
shares were transferred to a spouse before sale.
The Chancellor effectively has reinstated the capital gains tax treatment for
share options granted after July 17, 1995, up to a limit of #20,000.
The new scheme must be approved by the Inland Revenue and there will be no
income tax to pay either when the options are granted or when they are
exercised.
The #20,000 limit applies to the market value of the shares at the time the
options are granted. The exercise price should not be less than the market
value at the date of grant, ie the shares should not be issued at a discount.
Many employees will be holding share options which were granted to them before
July 17, 1995, under the Revenue-approved rules. These options will continue to
be eligible for capital gains tax treatment, but any new options granted after
that date will be aggregated with the previous options to determine the new
#20,000 limit.
Broadly, all other conditions of approved share option schemes under the old
rules will continue to apply. In particular, options must be exercised between
years three and 10 after the date of grant.
The practical effect of this new relief is that the majority of employees who
are in approved share option schemes will continue to obtain capital gains tax
treatment when they sell their shares and they will not be liable to income tax
on the value of the shares when the options are exercised or the shares are
sold.
With the benefit of capital gains inflation relief and the annual exemption,
this will take many employees out of tax on their share options.
This sensible reinstatement of the previous tax advantages is designed to
motivate and reward employees by giving them a stake in the success of their
company without major tax penalty.
Business bonus
THE Chancellor made welcome announcements for owners of small business both on
capital gains tax and inheritance tax.
Currently, when an individual disposes of the whole or part of a business or of
shares in a personal company on retirement, full relief from capital gains tax
is given on the first #250,000 of gains, with an effective 20% tax rate
applying to gains between #250,000 and #1m.
Such relief is currently available to taxpayers who have reached the age of 55
or who retire earlier due to ill health. Under the Chancellor's proposal, the
qualifying age will be reduced to 50.
The reduction in the qualifying age will extend the benefit of the relief to
more entrepreneurs and shareholders in family companies who want to dispose of
their interests before the typical retirement age.
This also could have the effect of releasing capital to be reinvested in new
business projects.
Where the businessman holds only a proportion of the shares in his company,
inheritance tax can be a problem. In general, transfers of unquoted
shareholdings of 25% or less in trading companies will only attract 50%
business property relief.
From April 6, 1996, all unquoted shares in qualifying companies held for at
least two years will qualify for 100% business property relief.
Previously, there was a disincentive for owners of family businesses to reduce
their interest by passing on majority stakes to children and other relations.
These new provisions will now make this more attractive and at the same time,
with the increase of the inheritance tax threshold to #200,000, it should be
possible in the vast majority of cases to avoid inheritance tax altogether.
Special rules apply to transfers of agricultural assets but again, with careful
planning, 100% relief should be available to taxpayers in these circumstances.
Charity boost
CURRENTLY, donations which are given by employees to charities can be made
through a payroll giving scheme. For 1995-96 up to #75 per month or #900 per
annum could be given by employees. This means that the amount paid is treated
as a deduction from their taxable pay so that, in effect, tax relief is given
on the amount paid.
From April 6, 1996, it is proposed that the limits will be increased by
one-third to #100 per month or #1200 anually. The Chancellor says it is his
intention to promote further charitable giving and the increased limit is a
response to representations from a number of charities.
Almost 7500 separate employer schemes exist at present. Last year, #16m was
donated under the payroll giving scheme on which tax relief of #4m was given.
It is hoped that these figures will increase significantly.
The Chancellor also proposes to exempt charities from tax on certain investment
income. Charities already are exempt from tax on most types of income and this
exemption is extended by concession to include bank interest, interest on
dividents payable by building societies and interest on income arising from
property abroad. It is proposed to make this exemption statutory rather than
relying on a concession.
Making it simple
THE Chancellor has responded to widespread criticism that tax law is not only
lengthy and complex but is unnecessarily confusing.
He announced that a start will be made next year on a project to simplify tax
legislation for the benefit of businesses and taxpayers generally.
Key aims of the project are:
q To rewrite tax legislation in plain, user-friendly language.
q To redesign the framework of tax so that it will be easier to understand and
work with.
q To help taxpayers operate the new system of self-assessment
q To reduce compliance costs and improve service from the Inland Revenue.
The plan is to simplify tax legislation. It is not aimed at changing tax
policy. A detailed report is being prepared by the Inland Revenue for
presentation to Parliament next month.
Full consultation will be held with representative bodies and taxpayers to
ensure that taxpayers' concerns are taken fully into account.
While there will be substantial costs involved in rewriting the voluminous tax
legislation, the Government believes that the long-term benefits for business
and self-employed taxpayers, in particular, will substantially exceed those
costs.
Much of the existing legislation is virtually unintelligible even to experts.
Any meaningful progress towards simplification is to be welcomed.
No quick fix
WHILE the Chancellor announced his intention to simplify legislation a good
example of where this won't work concerns the legislation dealing with foreign
exchange.
For most companies, this legislation will come into effect from January 1,
1996, with the intention of bringing a measure of certainty to the tax
treatment of foreign exchange differences which will affect most companies
trading abroad.
However, you just have to look at over 30 pages of legislation which is
mind-bogglingly complex to appreciate that there will be no quick fix.
When dealing with matters financial, in particular all of the complicated
financial instruments and foreign exchange hedges, you cannot be simple. The
simpler you are, the easier it will be to get round the very provisions that
are introduced to try to prevent avoidance of tax.
At least the complex and lengthy legislation should ensure a degree of equity
and certainty to companies affected but finance directors are going to have to
make a number of decisions and elections to protect their company's position.
It is imperative that they understand the legislation - no easy task. Our
advice would be to get professional help as you can't afford to be caught out.
Gilts change
THE Chancellor had already announced changes in respect of gilts and bonds that
will come into effect from April 1996.
While private investors - individuals and trusts - will continue to pay tax on
interest on the present basis, there are new provisions which will affect
taxation on disposal of the investments.
Private investors holding more than #200,000 nominal value of most Government
gilts and company loan stock will be liable to pay income tax from April 6,
1996, on any gains realised. If losses are realised, these can be set against
other income in the year in which the loss arises.
Specific exemptions to these rules will apply in respect of two widely held
gilts - 3.5% 1999-2004 and 5.5% 2008-2012.
The gilts and bonds changes for companies will have a more significant impact.
For companies from April 1, 1996, all holdings of gilts, loan stocks, and
corporate debt will be within the new regime, and revised treatments will apply
to borrowings as well as investments.
Companies borrowing and investing in these forms of debt will be taxable on an
accruals basis, revaluing the capital amount and giving relief over time for
discounts, and taxing gains as they accrue rather than when they are realised.
In addition, there will be significant changes to the tax treatment of
companies' interest receipts and payments as these will be taxed or relieved on
an accruals basis, regardless of the date of payment or receipt.
While some complex provisions already contained in the legislation will
disappear for companies which will lead to a welcome simplification, as usual,
anti-avoidance legislation is likely to appear in some abundance.
There is still a lot of uncertainty left by the Chancellor in connection with
these new rules, but the by-word for companies will be watch out and make sure
that you understand the new rules.
Helping yourself
THE Chancellor announced that help would be given to those who make
arrangements to protect themselves against the financial losses caused by
personal misfortune. Under these proposals, certain insurance benefits paid in
the event of accident, sickness, disability, infirmity or unemployment will no
longer be taxable.
Previously the Inland Revenue did not collect tax where the insurance benefits
were provided in times of sickness, disability or unemployment to meet existing
obligations such as mortgage payments. Under the proposed measures, all such
insurance benefits will no longer be taxable provided the person entitled to
them is sick, disabled or unemployed. This will include top ups to earned
income when it is reduced as a result of sickness.
The exemption will not apply to insurance benefits that are taken into account
in computing trading and similar profits, nor where the premiums have received
tax relief. Sick pay, which is funded by way of a group policy taken out by the
employer, will remain taxable unless the employees have themselves contributed
to the premiums.
It is proposed that the measures will remove the obligation from insurers to
deduct tax from exempted benefits.
VAT relaxed
A POTPOURRI of changes in VAT legislation are included in the press releases
which accompanied the Chancellor's Budget statement. These include increasing
the registration limit for small businesses to #47,000 from midnight tonight
and increasing the deregistration threshold from #44,000 to #45,000.
The Chancellor also announced a package of measures to simplify VAT for
businesses trading with other EC member states. The most important measure is
the introduction of arrangements known as fiscal warehousing. This will allow
various commodities, including metals, foodstuffs and chemicals, to be traded
in a VAT-free regime. This system will be introduced from June 1, 1996.
From November 29 VAT will no longer be charged on business gifts costing #15 or
less. The limit was previously #10 and has been in place since 1973, therefore
the increase seems hardly generous but should cover the cost of a bottle of
whisky.
One area to be welcomed is the relaxation of the rules on what must be shown on
a VAT invoice. This relaxation had been applied previously but was withdrawn
due to faulty legislation. It is good to see that the former position for the
benefit of business is being restored.

FAR-reaching changes to welfare aid for lone parents, leading to abolition of
special benefits, emerged in a radical shake-up revealed yesterday.
Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley said the changes - which include the
immediate freezing of one parent benefit and lone parent premium - would end
the system's discrimination in favour of lone parents.
Announcing details of the proposals following the Budget, Mr Lilley disclosed
long-term plans to phase out special benefit help for 1.5m lone parents.
At the same time he announced extra help with child care costs - and revealed
the minimum maintenance payments under the Child Support Act would be doubled.
Campaigners the Child Poverty Action Group warned that the end to special lone
parent benefits would hit the 2.3 million youngsters living in such families,
who often relied on the cash for food.
Mr Lilley revealed that regulations are to be introduced so that one parent
benefit - worth #6.30 a week to all single parents - will be built into Child
Benefit.
Similarly the lone parent premium, worth around #5.20 a week to people on
means-tested benefits, would be merged into the family premium element of
income support.
No-one receiving the benefits will lose out. But a review will be held every
year into the ``appropiate level of special support''.
``While I cannot prejudge what I will do in future years, my intention over
time is to narrow the gap between lone parent benefits and those which go to
couples.''
Other changes announced include:
q Introducing a pilot scheme from April 1997 to provide help with job search
and skills training for up to 25,000 lone parents.
q Increasing the childcare allowance in Family Credit from #40 to #60 - a move
calculated to help up to 10,000 families.
q Increasing the minimum maintenance payment under the Child Support Act from
#2.35 to #4.80.
The National Council for One Parent Families said lone parents faced
``significant extra costs'' to couples.
This would place extra pressure on families and risked driving them into deeper
poverty, added a spokeswoman.
She accused Ministers of failing to recognise that not all lone parents would
be able to go back to work quickly.
Elsewhere, Mr Lilley announced cuts in housing benefit for young people living
away from home. In future this will not cover the full cost of rent, but only
the cost of shared accommodation for under 25's. Parents who get housing
benefit for their children living at home will also be hit under the changes.
Shadow Social Security secretary Chris Smith said young people would be forced
into multi-occupancy housing, with all the potential health and fire hazards.
``The real way to reduce the Social Security budget is not hit young people,
single parents, and families but to get people back to work. This would cut the
benefits bill and increase our tax base.''

THE successful take-up by Scottish industry of more technology and research
from the country's universities is more important than the much-lauded business
birthrate initiatives, Crawford Beveridge, chief executive of Scottish
Enterprise, conceded yesterday.
He and Professor Tom Johnston, president of the Royal Society of Edinburgh,
reported on findings from a year-long joint inquiry into how the Scottish
science research and development base could be made more commercialised.
Mr Beveridge said: ``Since I returned from the United States to do this job
five years ago, it has struck me that, despite our strong performance compared
to the UK over the last few years, the Scottish economy is still very fragile
and heavily dependent on inward investment.
``We need to expand the base and ambition of Scottish companies,'' he added.
``The first big issue to be tackled then was the business birthrate and the
agreed strategies now being implemented. The second, and in my view even more
important issue, is how we can bring the massive store of intellectual property
in our universities out into the industrial community as a key component of
building a high growth, high wage economy.''
The inquiry team has set itself a deadline of next spring to pull together a
draft long-term R&amp;D strategy for Scotland.
An action plan will be supported by academics and industrialists alike backed
by the financial sector, with the aim to link higher education home-grown
technology more closely to the country's commercial base.
Mr Beveridge said it wanted to create a ``virtuous circle'' to increase the
amount of research commercialised in Scotland whether by new or existing
companies.
``We all know that a high-wage economy must derive much of its competitive
advantage from the application of science and technology.''
Increased commercialisation had the potential, therefore, to improve the
overall economic development of Scotland, and also to benefit the academic
community by helping to ensure continued investment in high-quality research.
He added: ``Scotland already has the key component of commercialisation in
world-class research. However, all too often this research is developed,
manufactured and sold elsewhere.''
Professor Johnston said benefits would not be solely for Scotland as a whole.
It would also offer the potential for graduate recruitment from a strengthened
indigenous corporate base.
He reported on the success of a recent inquiry forum at Glasgow's Clydeport
building when senior decision-makers from across industry, finance and academia
were present.
Several emerging issues became evident. These included a clear need for better
dialogue, the mismatch between the strength of the science base and industrial
take-up, and a serious gap in funding provision.
The inquiry has emphasised no one magic formula for success. Nevertheless, it
was crucial the balance of transfer of research output to industrial take-up in
Scotland was greatly improved.

Paris
GUNMEN have assassinated an Algerian army general, a source close to the
security forces said today, in the first major attack since the presidential
polls 12 days ago.
General Mohamed Bouteghan died last night in the luxurious Hydra suburb of
Algiers by young men who had trailed him, the source added.
His killing came nearly eight hours after President Liamine Zeroual took the
oath of office in a ceremony attended by about 500 dignitaries, including army
leaders.
The general, who is believed to be the commander of Algeria's military coast
guard, was the most senior army officer to be killed in the country's four
years of civil strife.
Up to 50,000 people have been killed in Algeria's violence since early 1992
when authorities scrapped a general election which Islamic militants had been
poised to win.
The 59-year-old Bouteghan was shot dead in an exclusive neighbourhood where
several embassies are located on the heights overlooking the Algerian capital.
The source did not know why the general was in the suburb where many senior
officials and officers once lived before the violence erupted.
Many villas in Hydra are now closed as rich foreigners have left the North
African country and senior officials and officers moved to more secure
locations like the coastal resort of Sidi Fredj, outside Algiers, residents
said.
The killing came as a bitter reminder of the insecurity challenge still facing
Zeroual, himself a general.
Colonel Cherif Djelloul, army commander of Algiers district, was shot dead in
Algiers in last November while leading troops in an operation against
guerrillas.
Zeroual was elected on November 16 with more than 61% of the vote in a massive
turnout by Algerians despite militant threats to shoot voters or cut their
throats.
Diplomats and analysts have been expecting Muslim guerrillas to strike to show
they are still a force to be reckoned with despite the stunning elections
setback.
The Algerian newspaper Liberte said a union official, M'hamed Belabla, was
assassinated on Sunday in the Baraki suburb, south of Algiers. The newspaper
did not give details.
Zeroual yesterday vowed to continue fighting the rebels while offering to hold
a dialogue with political parties and to show leniency to fundamentalist
organisations.-Reuter.

Newcastle 13, Transvaal 38
THEY were the 12 minutes that probably signalled Gary Armstrong's Tyneside
rugby future. The Jed-Forest, Scotland, and British Lions scrum half came on
after 68 minutes when Newcastle were trailing 31-8. Almost immediately,
Newcastle lock John Dixon had driven over for a try to put the Tynesiders into
double figures.
The seconds that Newcastle's millionaire benefactor took later to answer a
simple question were more important.
Question to coach Rob Andrew: ``Would Newcastle's Scottish recruits be released
to play for district sides in the European championship if Newcastle also were
involved?''
``That's a good question,'' replied Andrew. Step in Sir John Hall. ``That's a
good question and a hypothetical question, and it's much too soon to say. We've
got more important things to worry about.''
Maybe so, but it's a question that the Scottish rugby hierarchy will want
answered before much more water has passed under the bridge over the River
Tyne. Back to the game.
Newcastle, with new signings Dean Ryan and Nick Popplewell on parade, Tony
Underwood and Doddie Weir watching on the sidelines, were no match for the
slick South Africans, but they did just enough to suggest that once Andrew has
completed his recruiting drive, then they may spring from their precarious
perch at the foot of the English second division.
Transvaal, fielding five Springboks, and a huge pack, opened the scoring after
six minutes with a try from fly-half Louis van Rensberg. Hans Pfluger converted.
After 30 minutes, Transvaal went further ahead with a try by the Springbok
hooker, James Dalton, after his own break and a return pass from fly half Louis
van Rensberg. Pfluger failed with the conversion.
Newcastle snatched a try five minutes before the interval when the ball shot
from the front of the lineout and hooker Neil Frankland pounced for the
touchdown. Rob Andrew sent the conversion attempt wide.
In the second half, Transvaal sneaked a try after six minutes when Philip
Schutte snatched a lineout ball and tumbled over unopposed for the touchdown.
Pflugler converted.
Andrew kept Newcastle in the hunt with a penalty after 53 minutes, but two
minutes later, Transvaal retaliated with a sparkling try by Jaco Louw.
The South Africans took a tapped penalty deep inside their own half, Van
Rensberg and Louw galloped upfield and Louw went over. Pflugler was on target
with the conversion.
Louw put Transvaal out of reach after 63 minutes with a try after a searing
break up the left touchline.
With 12 minutes to go Newcastle were awarded a penalty in front of the
Transvaal posts. Armstrong, who had been warming up on the sidelines, made his
Kingston Park debut, and Dixon drove over for the try.
In the final minute, Louw had his hat trick after yet another electrifying
break and again, Pflugler converted.
Newcastle - I McLellan; M Wilson, R Wilkinson, J Fletcher, G Childs; R Andrew,
G Robson; N Popplewell, N Frankland, P Van Zandvliet, F Mitchell, J Dixon, R
Arnold, S Cassidy, D Ryan. Replacements - G Armstrong, D Weir, P Belgian, A

BOTH bookmakers and the pools companies have had to shed jobs because of the
impact of the national lottery.
To help reduce the damage, general betting duty is being cut by 1% to 6.75%
while pool betting duty will fall 6% to 26.5%.
The changes will reduce Exchequer income by about #100m in a full year.
Mr Mike Kershaw, managing director of Stanley Leisure, the largest of the
quoted pure gambling companies, said that the changes were too little and too
late. He had been hoping for a 2% reduction.
Stanley warned earlier this month that there could be a significant drop in
racing division profits.
Even harder hit has been Ladbrokes, which has been forced to make 500 people
redundant in racing activities, and in Vernons Pools, where turnover in the
first nine months was down 27%.
Mr Kershaw said that it would be difficult to split the 1% between the punter
and horse and greyhound racing as a !s% could be a difficult figure to
distribute when it comes into effect in March. The pool duty reduction comes
into effect in two stages.
Ladbrokes shares rose 2p to 151!sp, reversing an earlier loss.

JEFF Green's television-inspired route from light engineering to stand-up
comedy was more straightforward than might first appear. It was also very
tiring, as he explains.
``I came out of university with an engineering degree and loads of debts, and
so to pay them off I took a sales job with British Oxygen, travelling around
the country convincing welders to buy oxygen and acetylene. I very quickly
realised that I'd made a big mistake, career-wise.''
He kept both disparate occupations going, in the process almost dying from
sleep-deprivation. ``For two years from 1988 to 1990, I did stand-up at night
and toured welders' premises by day. I was getting to bed at 2am and then
getting up four hours later. Even in my dinner-hour, I'd be trying to write
jokes.
``Even though I was only 24, I was completely knackered.''
Thankfully, Jeff's winsome brand of laddish confession has never seemed tired,
as his many Scottish fans will be able to discover when he journeys north of
the Border this week. But how did he get from retailing oxygen-cylinders to
creating a happy atmosphere in clubs?
``Friday Night Live on Channel 4. I'd watch it and think: `Here's a bunch of
people who look like me; who haven't had to go through being Butlin's Redcoats;
who are doing comedy that sounds as though it's the kind of comedy I could
write.' ''
Jeff has now been writing and performing his comedy full-time for five years.
Although he's yet to make a major TV breakthrough of his own, he has picked up
sundry Edinburgh Fringe awards. Plus something less tangible, but more
rewarding.
``I have paid my dues, as they say, in Edinburgh. I remember doing a three-week
double bill with Lee Evans in 1991. It was very demoralising at the time,
playing to six people, then nine people. Maybe at the weekend it would rise to
20 people, but then it would be back down again.
``I didn't do a full Edinburgh run this year because I only had 40 new minutes
of material, and it wouldn't have been fair on audiences. So I just did three
nights, but while all my stand-up mates were saying: `You lucky devil,' I was
acutely aware of how much I missed being there for longer. You see, no matter
how few people you might be playing to, a stand-up can't help but come away
from Edinburgh red-hot, honed to perfection.
``I will be doing the whole three weeks next year.''
Other parts of Scotland have been highly important in Jeff's development as a
performer, too.
``I appeared one Burns Night at Glasgow's Old Athenaeum after having been away
on holiday for three weeks. I hadn't looked at my material in all that time,
and as I stood waiting for the curtain to go up, listening to this fearsome
baying noise from the stalls, I knew that I would never be able to remember my
opening line.
``Sheer terror somehow transformed me into a bloke who had never in his life
been so pleased to be standing on that stage that night. I did another Glasgow
show, at Mayfest last year, in a big circus tent. Jo Brand was MC, and I had to
follow a comic who had been most horribly booed off.
``Going on stage in those circumstances can actually make it easier to please
an audience, as they're maybe a little guilty about what they've done, as well
as desperate for light relief. But I'd got a load of new material I hadn't done
before, in preparation for Edinburgh, and I almost bottled it. Thankfully, I
didn't and people liked it.''
Breathe in some of Jeff Green's life-giving comedy and you'll be thankful, too.
n Jeff Green visits Scotland on the Gilded Balloon comedy circuit, calling at
East Kilbride tonight (Arts Centre); Edinburgh tomorrow (Gilded Balloon);
Aberdeen on Friday (Lemon Tree); Dundee on Saturday (Dundee Rep), and Glasgow
on Sunday (Tron).

MODERATOR of the General Assembly in 1957; Rector of Glasgow University from
1968-71; founder of the Iona Community in 1938 - George Macleod, to most of us
south of the border, is probably best known for the latter role.
By all accounts, and judging by Tom Fleming and Ronald Ferguson's dynamic
recreation of the man, he was a man who revelled in ruffling feathers. Already
rousingly received at the St Magnus Festival and in Edinburgh, how would this
account go down in London?
In fact, in the austere but almost intimate surroundings of the Church of
Scotland's Crown Court, a place conspicuously apt in George Macleod's centenary
year for being the site of his marriage in 1948, Tom Fleming's two-hour solo,
an undeniable theatrical tour de force, conjures up a very particular kind of
Scottish spirit: that of the fierce, independent freethinker.
With only the help of a lampstand, rug and chair, Fleming leaves it to
Macleod's words and his own inestimable voice to conjure the many-sided images
of this no doubt part-irritating but also inspiringly honest spiritual
traveller - an uncompromisingly uncategorisable and life-long pacifist and
ecumenical, in flight from any form of political or, for that matter, religious
correctness, but also one, paradoxically, deeply involved in religion as a
political force.
Listening to Macleod's blasts against the arms trade and Big Banking, the
rigidities of religious bigotry and sectarianism, you couldn't help thinking
that he and Christ (particularly Dennis Potter's doubting, disputatious one),
would get on like a house on fire, arguing through the night and on into
eternity.

Ajax 0, Gremio 0
(After extra time)
Ajax won 4-3 on penalties.
BRAZILIAN striker Jardel, who will join up with Rangers in the new year,
yesterday failed to add to his honours when his current side, Gremio, lost out
on a penalty shoot-out to European champions Ajax in the World Club
Championship before 60,000 fans in Tokyo.
Jardel, who was substituted late in the game, was left to reflect on the two
second-half chances he missed, first shooting wide from good position and then
sending a header past a post.
Yet, in terms of clear-cut chances, Ajax's Patrick Kluivert and Finnish
internationalist Jari Litmanen were as guilty as Jardel of missing a virtually
open target more than once.
When extra time left the match still without a goal, Ajax captain Danny Blind
converted his team's last penalty to give the Amsterdam side a 4-3 victory.
It was the third time since 1985 that the match has been settled by penalties
and the fifth occasion it needed extra time.
Ajax were always in front during the shoot-out after Edwin van der Sar saved
from Dinho and Francsico Arce hit the bar with Gremio's second, even though
Kluivert put the Dutch side's opening spot-kick wide.
The victory rewarded the more enterprising side on a bitterly cold afternoon
that had some Brazilian outfield players wearing gloves.
The Dutch side dominated the match, but were unable to breach the strong Gremio
defence, even though the Brazilian side were down to 10 men after 56 minutes.
Paraguayan central defender Catalino Rivarola was sent off for his second
bookable offence, a second successive foul on teenage striker Kluivert in the
space of three minutes.
Ajax were lucky not to have international winger Marc Overmars sent off minutes
after Rivarola's dismissal. He swung an arm in front of Arilson's face and the
Gremio midfielder went down holding his mouth. But English referee David
Elleray, who had his back to the incident, simply went ahead with a free kick
he had already awarded Gremio after consulting his linesman.
The match could have got out of hand at that point as the Brazilian side
demanded Overmars be sent off, but Elleray's firm hand steered it away from
trouble.
Afterwards, Gremio's coach Luis Felipe said: ``Ajax had too much possession and
it was difficult to fight with only 10 players, but I think we did well to get
to the penalties.
``They are one of the super teams of Europe and today they did not score, so I
think the sides are very even.''
Ajax are unbeaten in 49 successive league games and have run up 55 goals in
their 15 league games so far this season and 11 in five European Champions' Cup
matches.
Coach Louis van Gaal criticised the Tokyo pitch, saying it had prevented his
side from playing their usual passing game.
``We were forced to play another style because of the field. My team were not
so good today, but that was also due to Gremio. They defended in a small area
and played the counter-attack. But we can kill a defence like this on a good
pitch.''

IT was very different when Blur last played the SECC, in 1992, at the bottom of
a four-band bill headed by the Jesus and Mary Chain. Then, a tired and
emotional Damon Albarn spent most of the gig laddishly trying to pull down
bassist Alex James' trousers.
The ennui-laden cognoscenti, present for more credible names such as My Bloody
Valentine, looked on askance.
In contrast, most of last night's audience - the massed ranks of 14-year-old
girlies - would have died at the mere thought of pulling down Damon's trousers.
They screamed. They ripped the breast-pocket from Damon's shirt when he
unwisely forayed into the stage-front pit, within reach of their frenzied
grasp. They screamed again.
Damon shrugged resignedly before totting up the votive offerings flung from the
seething mob on to the stage: one leather jacket, a koala bear, a trumpet, a
broken pair of sunglasses...... and a tin of Spam? Lumme, imagine copping a
flying tin of Spam in the chuzzlewits. Oooh. So where's it healthier for Blur
to be in 1995? Sneered at by self-styled hipsters, or the targets of unthinking
adoration? Somewhere in-between, obviously.
But how to get there, now they've outgrown their roots in matey music hall and
nimble power-pop and become stadium-sized teen-fodder? Tunes. They just have to
keep knocking them out. With literate lyrics attached, of course. It's worked
for the past three albums.
Yet overly receptive crowds can cloud your judgment.
So maybe last night's most important sight was Damon smiting himself on the
head with his microphone every so often. Keeping himself in touch with his
knockabout past? Finding strength through suffering? Time alone will tell.

ST JOHNSTONE defender John McQuillan has spent the last three weeks walking
around on a broken leg. It was only after the 25-year-old full back underwent a
second scan this week in Glasgow that it emerged he had cracked his fibula.
Signed from Dundee during the close season, McQuillan thought he had suffered a
calf strain when he was injured against Dumbarton at Boghead on November 4. Now
he faces a further six weeks out of the game.
Last night he admitted he counted himself lucky. ``I continued to train after
getting the injury and everything was fine as long as I was just running. But
there was a lot of pain when I tried to turn or stretch. I began to worry that
I might have picked up one of those injuries that take ages to clear up. I was
actually relieved to be told by the specialist after the second scan that it
was a cracked bone.
``I thought it was very unusual that the break did not show up the first time,
but I am told that exactly the same thing happened to one of our young players
last season.''
q FORFAR manager Tommy Campbell has told teenager Sean Christie that he does
not want to see him playing in the first team again this season. The
15-year-old became the youngest player ever to appear in a Scottish League
fixture when he came on as a substitute against Berwick last weekend, but
Campbell knows the danger of burning out young talent.
Campbell explained: ``Using Sean against Berwick was done more out necessity
than anything else. We were struggling to field a team and Sean happened to be
at the front of the queue.
``He plays regularly in our reserve team and I knew he would not let us down.
But I really would prefer not to use him in the first team again this season.
He has bags of potential, but I don't want to risk rushing the lad too quickly

BATHGATE'S Stephen Gallacher and Longniddry's Raymond Russell will join the
European Tour next season after having graduated from the ardous qualifying
school at San Roque in Spain yesterday.
As a fierce wind blasted the Costa del Sol venue, Atherstone's Steve Webster
triumphed with a remarkable eight-under-par total.
Gallacher slipped to a poor, but understandable, closing 76, yet still finished
in the top five while Russell posted a level-par round of 72.
Starting the day at four-under, Gallacher was virtually assured access to the
lucrative circuit yet failed to fire and finished with a double bogey at the
final hole where his approach found water. It was his first such score in 108
holes.
After his first and, hopefully, last sortie to the school, Gallacher said: ``My
main objective was to gain my card, but it was nice to finish in the top five.''
Having clinched his card at the third attempt, the jubilation of Russell was
tempered as two his countrymen fell at the final hurdle. Both William Guy, of
Buchanan Castle, and Scott Henderson, of King's Links, failed to secure their
cards, slumping to four-over-par rounds of 76.
An exhausted Russell said: ``Thank goodness that tournament is over. It is hard
enough at the best of times without having to endure this wind in the final
round.
``I lost my rhythm completely following the rain shower at the second hole and
was one-over-par after seven holes. But even that included a number of
excellent up and downs.'' Leading British and Irish qualifiers:
422 - S Webster 74, 65, 71, 74, 68, 70.
423 - A Collison 69, 70, 71, 73, 69, 69, 73. 428
430 - C Suneson 71, 74, 70, 76, 70, 69; M Welch 74, 73, 69, 72, 71, 71; S
Gallacher 72, 72, 68, 69, 73, 76; M Wills 71, 68, 70, 72, 72, 77.
431 - F Howley 72, 69, 75, 73, 71, 71; R Coles 69, 72, 69, 74, 73, 74.
432 - P Harrington 71, 75, 68, 76, 70, 72; J McHenry 73, 72, 70, 73, 72.
433 - R Russell 70, 73, 71, 76, 71, 72.
Scots who missed out: 437 - S Henderson 70, 76, 69, 75, 72, 76. 440 - W Guy 73,

HOPES of an increase in hill livestock compensatory allowances were dashed
yesterday when the Government confirmed they would remain at present levels for
the third year running, writes ROBERT ROSS.
Scottish Office Agriculture Minister the Earl of Lindsay said even a
stand-still figure represented a significant achievement in the current severe
public expenditure round.
``It is a clear sign of our continued commitment to support hill farming,'' he
said.
HLCA payments are made on breeding ewes and breeding beef suckler cows.
Last year they totalled #40.8m - #17.7m for sheep and #23.1m for cattle.
Scotland has 13,500 hill farmers for whom the payments are regarded as a vital
support.
Lord Lindsay acknowledged the importance of the sector saying: ``If you can
keep the farmers in business you can keep whole communities in business.
Scottish Ministers have fought very hard to protect the HLCAs.''
John Scott, hill farming convener for the National Farmers' Union of Scotland,
said it was disappointing the Government had reacted so negatively to its
request for special consideration for the plight of hill farmers and crofters
in the West and North, where conditions this year had been particularly
difficult.

ENGLISH football's breadline clubs were tossed a crumb of comfort with the
announcement yesterday of a #125m, five-year deal for Sky Television to
broadcast Endsleigh League matches. It could mean as much as #1m a year for
first division clubs, with scaled down payments to those in divisions two and
three.
``For some of our clubs this deal will be a lifeline. It will increase their
revenue and raise their viability at a crucial time,'' said League president
Gordon McKeag.
The prospect of a cash share-out from the record deal, allied to extra
advertising from live matches, will almost certainly kill the threat of major
clubs breaking away to form a Premier League division two. There was a sense of
jubilation at the League's Lytham St Anne's headquarters. Their TV income is
set to soar from #8m to #25m per season as a result of this agreement.
A meeting of all Endsleigh clubs will be held in London next month to thrash
out distribution details of the bonanza.
From next August, Sky will broadcast up to 60 Endsleigh matches and the three
end-of-season Wembley promotion play-offs live. Sky will probably broadcast
League matches on Friday nights and Sundays, but head of sport Vic Wakeling
insisted: ``It would be premature to assume a schedule at this stage.''
The deal also includes at least one live tie from each round of the Coca-Cola
Cup and exclusive coverage of the final.
The Football League were involved with the FA and the FA Premier League in
recent discussions about joint television agreements. Their decision to go it
alone has paid dividends.
The FA withdrew their offer after the League stalled on a decision about
whether to accept around #120m of a #250m five-year deal. However, FA spokesman
Steve Double said: ``Any deal which can help secure the financial future of its
member clubs is welcome. The deal is extremely similar to the one we offered.''

WOMEN'S GOLF
SCOTLAND'S Myra McKinlay overcame a tense start before handing in a
one-under-par opening round of 71 in the 72-hole American Express Tour
qualifying school tournament at La Manga, Spain, yesterday.
It left McKinlay alongside compatriot Tracey Craik and just two strokes adrift
of Australian Joanne Mills, who leads the field after an almost faultless round
of 69.
McKinlay started her round from the tenth tee and thinned her opening drive
into a dry ditch just 40 yards from the tee.
From there the former Curtis Cup player hit a No.4-wood into another hazard but
played out to 15 feet from where she holed for an unlikely par 4. She dropped
shot at the fifteenth but holed from five feet for a birdie at the next hole to
reach the turn in 36.
After the turn, McKinlay found sand to lose a shot at the second hole but then
hit a glorious No.4-wood to 25ft for an eagle 3 at the long third before a run
of regulation figures brought her home in 35.
Craik, who also started her round at the tenth, was out in 36 but despite
losing an early shot to par on the inward half recovered with two birdies to
come home one under 71.
Mills never looked back after starting the day with birdies at the first three
holes.
Another followed at the sixth where she holed from seven feet before dropping
her only shot of the day at the fifteenth, the only green she failed to hit in
regulation. Leading first-round scores (British and Irish unless stated):
69 - J Mills (Australia).
71 - I Tinning (Denmark), T Craik, M McKinlay.
72 - T Loveys, D Doniger (USA), S Sharpe.
74 - H Koch (Sweden), E Aron (France), S Hanley (USA), L van Engelburg
(Holland).
75 - E Valera (Spain), E Kruuse af Verchou (Sweden), A-M Knight (Australia),
E-J Smith, S Melin (Sweden), E Engstrom (Sweden), S Burnell, F Fehlauer
(Germany), A Lacy (USA), M Arruti (Spain), R Bates (USA), M Burstrom (Sweden).

DURING the run-up to the Budget, the conventional wisdom has held that the
Government faced a choice between tax cuts and investment in public services.
The general advice to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, from leader writers in
the newspapers, from talking heads on the television, and a wide range of other
compassionate folk, was that he should hold off on the cuts and concentrate on
the investment. Anything else, it has been implied, would be sacrificing the
future of the country to the interests of the Conservative Party.
Now Kenneth Clarke, in what seemed to me a bravura performance, has given us
both. There will be higher spending on public services, at least on the more
popular ones, on schools, hospitals, and the police. And there will be tax cuts
for everybody, but most of all, in effect, for the old and for others on the
lowest taxable incomes.
These, far more than the rich, have been the worst example of injustice in our
system of taxation, because of the absurdly high marginal rates they face when
they enter it.
To that extent, the Chancellor ought to silence his critics. Most of them have
indeed been talking rubbish. But once today's headlines, and the special
pleading which produced them, have been consigned to the dustbin of history,
there will be deeper questions about what Clarke has done.
In particular, is this what he claimed it to be, a cautious Budget, steady as
she goes with his own hand firm on the tiller, sailing serenely on to
well-defined long-term goals? Or is it an incautious, an over-optimistic
Budget, a gamble to recoup the fortunes of a desperate Government?
Well, there is plenty of evidence of caution. As Tony Blair remarked during his
efforts to whip up a bit of indignation from his own benches, what the
Chancellor gives with one hand he takes away with the other. Smokers and
drivers, as ever, pay more, while wastrels and fraudsters on social security
get less. The proceeds benefit the rest of us insofar as we do not fall into
those other categories.
The sums balance out and leave the overall fiscal stance unchanged. But then,
Labour does not propose as a general principle to do anything else. And this
general principle is in present conditions just as it should be.
More significant than the details of Clarke's measures were the results that he
expects from them. The most important single item in his speech was the
forecast for growth in 1996. It is estimated to rise to 3% from 2.75% this year.
In other words, the economy will expand faster. Unemployment will shrink
further. A greater number of people will be paying their albeit lower taxes.
Public borrowing will fall. Interest rates will go down with it. The effects of
recession will at last pass away.
Something like the glory days of Thatch-erism may even return, preferably
without the frenetic atmosphere of get-rich-quick. We may hope at least that a
sadder and wiser Government would not for a second time bring the glory days
crashing to a premature close.
Is the Chancellor's forecast plausible? Much hangs on the judgment. The British
economy has grown on a trend rate of between 2% and 3% since 1870 so perhaps it
would be a man bold to the point of foolhardiness who hoped for anything
better. Still, Clarke does not hope for more than 3%.
At the same time, it could just be that the British economy's potential has
improved since 1979. The deregulation of the Thatcherite era ought to have had
some effect beyond inflated wages for chairmen of privatised monopolies. It
ought to have freed capital and labour from the unprofitable activities into
which they were locked before. It ought to have allowed the capacity of a
basically wealthy country to be better used.
Unfortunately, we cannot be quite sure that all this has happened. The benefits
of deregulation were lost in the Lawson boom and the following recession before
their permanent results could be verified. But we can observe some signs at
least that permanent results, and permanent improvements, may indeed be there.
In 1994, the economy grew at 4%, well above the historic trend. That brought
consequences which had to be carefully watched and somewhat curbed, but which
have not got out of hand.
To forecast growth of 3% may therefore err on the optimistic side, but it is
not going over the top. Or at least it would err on the optimistic side if the
Chancellor had done nothing. His bravura performance lies in putting more money
in the taxpayers' pockets without altering the fiscal stance. This may be the
kick-start needed to hit 3%. At any rate, it seems to me a better way of
delivering the kick-start than what Gordon Brown has had to suggest.
Whether this will alter Tory fortunes decisively is, of course, a different
question. I suspect that voters still do not consider that the Government has
taken enough punishment for its past sins. So they will be slow to reward these
small tokens of repentance.
But a day of final reckoning must come in 18 months or so. And on that day, at
the General Election, we know from experience that people tend to act on
different motives from those impelling their expressions of opinion in
mid-term. They have to weigh the record of five years, and ponder the very
serious question of who is best fitted to govern them for the next five years.
This is not to predict that the Tories can yet snatch victory from defeat. But
if Clarke's record is coolly weighed, it will surely be found a creditable one.

ATV dangers
highlighted
THE potential dangers of all-terrain vehicles - ATVs - are highlighted by the
Health and Safety Executive in a new video launched yesterday.
Eleven people have been killed and many more injured in accidents over the last
10 years due to lack of proper training, says the executive.
The video shows examples from 100 serious ATV accidents which were investigated
by inspectors. Excessive speed is blamed for overturning incidents especially
when cornering. The use of the wrong gear on sloping ground can also cause the
vehicle to turn over.
Frank Lindsay, chief agricultural inspector, said: ``ATVs are increasingly used
on farms and are popular with young people. It is essential that riders know
the correct techniques for body positioning to improve both stability and
steering. It is also important that loads are correctly distributed on the
front or rear of the machine.''
Profits peak
THE ``golden profits'' period, which has seen farm incomes in some sectors
double over the past four years is reaching its peak, according to Chris
Bouchier, head of agriculture development with the advisory      service ADAS.
Speaking at Smithfield FarmTec, Mr Bouchier said short-term prospects still
looked good but current high profits were largely due to devaluation and the
continuing weakness of sterling - facts beyond the control of the producer.
Compensation
THE maximum compensation payable next month for an animal slaughtered because
it is affected with brucellosis or tuberculosis will be #756.

TRACEABLE company donations to the Conservative Party have fallen to a
five-year low of about #2.5m, according to the latest survey from the Labour
Research Department, which also reveals a further #1.79m from undisclosed
corporate sources.
Meanwhile, Labour has started to attract a few corporate donations, although as
yet these total only #81,000 for the year ended March 1995, during which the
Liberal Democrats attracted just one, worth #2500.
The independent Labour Research Department maintains that its survey fundings
demonstrate the difficulty of getting to the bottom of Tory Party financing and
lend weight to those calling on Lord Nolan's committee on standards in public
life to reverse its decision not to investigate the finances of political
parties until after the General Election.
A company must declare a donation if it produces a directors' report and makes
a donation of #200 or more. With around one million UK companies, about three
quarters of which are required to file such details with Companies House, an
exhaustive survey is not feasible.
Labour Research's latest sift through the accounts of around 5000 key public
and private companies has traced 172 companies giving a total of #2,461,655 to
the Tory Party in the year ending March 1995 - the lowest number of companies
and the smallest amount donated for the last five years.
This compares with 198 companies traced as giving #2,836,600 in the previous
year and substantially down on 1990 - the best non-election year for the
Tories, who attracted #3,815,071 from 309 companies.
Conservative finances have been hit by long-time company supporters deserting
the party. Around 50 have stopped making donations in the last 18 months.
Notable examples are United Biscuits, the Rank Organisation, insurance group
Sedgwick, Whitbread brewers, property giant Great Portland Estates, and cereals
multinational Kellogg.
The collapse of Barings Bank also cost the Tories dear. Other recent deserters
include Glaxo and Lucas. In addition, nearly 30 companies have reduced their
donations over the past two years.
On the plus side, the party has attracted eight new donors, with 28 companies
resuming donations and more than 40 increasing theirs over the past two years.
This fall in corporate donations leaves an increasing proportion coming from
undisclosed sources.
Over the past five years, unaffected by General Election donations, the company
donations traced by Labour Research as a proportion of total donations show in
the Tory Party accounts has plummeted from 52% in the year ending March 1989,
to just over 30% in 1994, and a mere 19.3% in the latest survey.
The Labour Party's financial backers include Dr Swraj Paul's Caparo
conglomerate (#54,000), Pearson Group publishers (#25,000), Currie Motors
(#1000), and Meconic (#1000).

BRIAN Lara's international future may be in jeopardy after the world's leading
batsman withdrew from West Indies' tour of Australia which starts next week.
Lara, who was fined 10% of his tour fee along with Carl Hooper, Curtly Ambrose,
and Kenneth Benjamin for misconduct on the tour of England this year, withdrew
from the tour party on Monday.
West Indies Cricket Board of Control president Peter Short told the Caribbean
news agency, CANA, that Lara had not signed a tour contract.
``However, I explained to him that I considered that there was a moral
obligation,'' Short said.
Asked about Lara's prospects of playing in next year's World Cup in India,
Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, Short replied: ``What the future holds is very open.
``I don't know what will happen there, I don't know what view the board is
going to take, I don't know what view Brian is going to take about his future
and his immediate post-Australia participation.''
Lara was released from his three-year contract with County champions
Warwickshire last week after pleading fatigue.

TOP Scottish agent Blair Morgan has pulled off one of the biggest football
coups ever by signing up two of the Ajax players who helped the Dutch champions
to their World Club Cup triumph in Tokyo yesterday.
Nigerian internationalists, Finidu George and Nwanko Kanu, could be available
to the leading Scottish clubs at the end of the season.
The Dunfermline-based lawyer was in Amsterdam at the weekend, and after talks
with the Dutch champions, he signed up both players. And this will give
Scottish clubs the chance to move in.
Last night, Morgan maintained a low profile. The players will not necessarily
be leaving Ajax - though the -recent policy at the Amsterdam club is to sell on
players and continue to produce their own talent through their youth system.
There is little doubt that if suitable offers arrive, then George and Kanu will
move and, equally, with an agent based in Scotland, then the major clubs in the
premier division will have an inside track.
Last night, Morgan said: ``Yes, I was in Holland at the weekend and I have
confirmed that I will be representing the two Nigerian players, Finidi George
and Nwankwo Kanu.
``I cannot say more than that. Both of the players were in action in Tokyo, and
they could be available at the end of the season. I cannot say where they might
go, but if anyone in Scotland is interested, then they can contact me.''
The opportunity is there for our clubs. In the past, the top Dutch players have
moved on to Italy and then, like Ruud Gullitt, have been disenchanted by the
life provided there for footballers.
Now there are two players      who have been hardened by European competition,
gaining winner's medals just last season, and handled by a Scottish-based agent.
The chance is there for our top clubs to move in just as aggressively as Morgan
and sign up the Ajax men.
q.SERIE A could become an even more impressive footballing arena if the Italian
Senate pushes through legislation which will forbid all sports authorities from
restricting the numbers of foreign athletes which is in line with the thinking
of Otto Lenz, the European Court of Justice's advocate general, who has
recommended free movement of European footballers.
If the Italian football federation is forced to end the practice of allowing
only three non-Italians in each club side - Scottish and English clubs can play
as many foreigners as they wish in domestic competitions - people like the
country's former President, Silvio Berlusconi, who is the owner of AC Milan,
will move to import more of world's best players. But he would only do that if,
like Rangers, he was convinced UEFA will be forced to work according to the
Treaty of Rome.
European law regards UEFA's stance on the number of non-nationals per team -
only three foreign players are allowed to play with each club side in any of
the three European club competitions - as illegal, and there will be further
movement on that front before the end of the year, but the Italians probably
believe they are moving into line with what might soon become law.
The Senate voted yesterday to lift restrictions on transfers and use of
football players and other professional athletes from European Union countries.
Under an amendment presented by the Northern League and approved by the Senate
within a broader package of immigration laws, Italian professional clubs would
be able to buy and field an unlimited number of EU players.

THE British Boxing Board of Control will today almost certainly issue a ban on
all ``casual'' fans from sporting club wine-and-dine shows throughout the
country.
That is the likeliest outcome when the board's stewards, headed by chairman Sir
David Hopkin and including Shadow Minister for Sport Tom Pendry MP, make their
inquiry into the serious disturbance which flared at the end of the tragic Drew
Docherty-James Murray British bantamweight title fight at the Hospitality Inn,
Glasgow, on October 13.
At the end of the bout, which Docherty won by a twelfth-round knockout, fans,
who had been allowed late entry to the event, went on the rampage throwing
bottles and chairs.
The board will consider representations from the promoters, Katherine Morrison
and Frank Warren, Strathclyde Police, the security firm, and the hotel
management before announcing any new measures to be introduced.
Although Docherty-Murray was the main event of a dinner show and not a public
promotion as such, extra stewarding was on hand.
The vulnerable area appeared to be linked to the admission of non-diners to
watch the fight.
Board secretary John Morris said: ``That sort of thing is bound to be discussed
- alcohol is bound to be discussed, plus police presence.
``You are always going to get the flash situation you don't expect. This one
was difficult to deal with in all the circumstances.''
Meantime, Johnny Armour, from Chatham, rated No.2 by the IBF, tonight defends
his European bantamweight title against France's Redha Jean Abbas at York Hall,
Bethnal Green.
Victory would almost certainly lift him into top spot with the IBF, so it is no
time for 19-win Armour to lose his title or unbeaten record.

THE Government could face a massive compensation claim after the European
Court's advocate-general yesterday backed Spain in a battle over
``flag-of-convenience'' fishing.
If the interim ruling is endorsed by the European Court of Justice, Britain
could be forced to pay out at least #30m to Spanish trawlermen who exploited a
loophole in European law to register at British ports and qualify for limited
UK fishing quotas.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food, the ruling could
allow around 100 Spanish boat owners to pursue damages claims for sums of
between #250,000 and #650,000 each in the British High Court.
Around 150 Spanish vessels, some UK-registered and operating out of the west
coast port of Ardrossan, were prevented from fishing in British waters
following the introduction of the Merchant Shipping Act in 1988.
The Act said British-registered boats had to be 75 per cent UK-owned and run by
British bosses.
For 15 months, the Spanish-owned ``British'' boats were forced to tie up.
However, in 1991, the European Court declaed the law contrary to EU rules,
which allow any company to set itself up anywhere in Europe.
Yesterday's statement could rekindle the political fury over interference in
national sovereignty and provoke a backlash from the domestic industry, furious
at the prospect of handsome rewards for Spanish fishermen seen as having
cheated on fish quota rules at the expense of UK fishermen's livelihoods.
Mr Elliot Morley, Labour's fishery spokesman, said the practice of ``quota
hopping'', whereby Spaniards bought up British boats and registered them in the
UK to gain access to Britain's fish quota, had been restricted by amendments to
the Merchant Shipping Act.
He added: ``The Government didn't move swiftly enough to close the loophole.
``This ruling is very bad news for the British fishing industry and the
taxpayer in terms of compensation.
``It is clear that attempts to stop quota-hopping were never implemented
successfully through the Act.
``We need to resolve this situation with the European Commission and try to
minimise the liability to the United Kingdom.''
Earlier this year, Tory MP David Harris, whose St Ives constituents include
fishermen threatened by the Spanish invasion, described the situation as ``an
absolute scandal''.
He has long campaigned on behalf of the Cornish fishermen and condemned
yesterday's decision saying: ``It is absolutely disgraceful if we have now got
to pay #30m on top of having the wretched flag-of-convenience boats in our
waters and fishing against our quotas.
``Cornish fishermen are furious about this further move, which just rubs salt
into sore wounds.''
However, a MAFF spokesman said litigation depended on the actual ruling.
He said: ``We have to wait for the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
Only then will we know whether claims for damages are likely to be pursued
through the UK courts.''
Mr Paul Tyler, the Liberal Democrat MP for North Cornwall, said: ``It is
extraordinary that the Minister is so relaxed about this and yet at the same
time we still have not got the Spanish boat owners to pay up the compensation
for acts of piracy against Cornish fishermen 15 months ago during the tuna
war.''

LOOK, I'm getting pretty cheesed off with my generation being labelled as a
bunch of malcontent slackers who are more apathetic than a gang of stoned
sloths. I'm fed up with hearing us described as perpetually fed up. Last year
the Washington Post nicknamed us Generation Hex. Apparently, we're all cursed
with the Don't-Give-A-Damn Disease, disinterested in anything but indulging our
desires and incapable of interest in anything other than the latest indie
import.
Well, hey, sometimes we do give a damn. We're just not very good at expressing
it. Admittedly, we have a slight aversion to the ballot box and would rather
watch The Chart Show than march up and down town on over-demonstrative
demonstrations of a Saturday morning, but that doesn't mean to say that we
don't care about, well, stuff.
We worry about the same things you wrinklies worry about; the nation's
wellbeing, litter on the streets, the future of the family, global peace, and
the price of denture cream. Well, okay, maybe not the latter: our fluoride
situation is sorted, thank you very much. But our chat isn't all about the
sexual shenanigans of Paula Yates, the latest Boddington's advertising
campaign, or the respective merits of Blur and Oasis.
It's not all shallow piffle. Sometimes we get all deep and meaningful. We do
care, honest we do. We even care about the children. Just because we're not
rushing headlong towards the maternity wards doesn't mean we're not interested
in sprogs. Why, just the other week my cronies and I worked ourselves into a
state of deep distress about the nation's youngsters, and their dependency on
the VCR and the computer.
They don't get enough fresh air: that makes us worried. They don't know how to
enjoy themselves: we feel stressed. Their standard of play has been seriously
eroded: we get so anxious we need a drink. See, that shows how much we care.
Last Sunday's Screws of the World got its crotchless knickers in a twist about
the fact that children are about to have access to a CD-Rom showing them how to
make bombs. We concur with the tabloid's concern. This is a very grave
situation. Why should kids today have it so easy? Do they need step-by-step
guides to everything? Do they have no imagination of their own?
I mean, we remember a time when children didn't need to be fed a video or
computer-generated diet of violence and sex. We made our own fun, we created
our own violence and sex. Maybe it's nostalgic, maybe it's rose-tinted crap,
but the conversation quickly settled into an evening of looking back on the
good old days.
``We used to have screaming competitions,'' I remembered fondly, recalling the
occasions when we young teenage girls would gather to vent our hormonal energy
by howling at the moon, testing local residents' commitment to what was going
on in their own backyard. Sort of an antecedent to car alarms, if not very good
on the tonsils.
``Well, we used to have spitting competitions,'' said the current man in my
life who's putting life in my life, waxing lyrical about the time when he and
his compadres would gob across the close in what was surely a psychic limbering
up for future punk concerts. Old ladies would have to show off their twinkle
toes to dodge these phlegmatic bullets. Do young people nowadays show such
concern for the exercise of their elderly neighbours? I think not.
An atheist I may be but I believe that there is something in Jesus's maxim:
``Suffer little children to come unto me.'' My, how we suffered. How we learned
through pain. Our enthusiasm for British Bulldog, a game which was basically
the legitimised beating up of smaller children, was a graphic example of the
rules of Survival of the Fittest. When you are being punched and pummelled and
brought down in the scrum you soon learn to target the kid down the road with
the gammy leg. Unless he had a particularly big brother.
And what's all this fuss about sexual education? Just drag the kids away from
their poncey computers and hurl them into the playground for a quick burst of
Kiss, Cuddle, or Torture. It was good enough for us. In fact, it was a
veritable obsession with us. But surely healthier than being addicted to
heroin, as today's tinies supposedly are, according to the press. No wonder my
generation are such sophisticated practitioners of SM; our school intervals
echoed to the cries of, ``torture, ah, torture please''.
Social order is necessary for the imposition of any form of democracy and we
anticipated boring university lectures on Machiavelli with the strategic
imposition of Bugsy Circles. Chalk circles were drawn around any miscreants -
ie, someone with a faded cardigan - and they weren't allowed to step outside.
Well, you have to be cruel to be kind. The victims should have learned to shape
up. I guess it was an early form of tough love.
And we didn't need video nasties or drugs for our adrenalin rushes. We had
organised vigilante groups instead. And they were truly democratic. Everyone
got their turn. Pah to Freddie Krueger. I remember the heart-thumping
excitement of being chased home by a gang of fellow 10-year-olds, convinced
that they would scalp me if they caught me. And they probably would have.
Virtual Reality just can't replicate that kind of thrill.
Young folks today, saturated on a dull diet of educational Lion King computer
activities, just don't know what they're missing. We despair for them, really
we do. But every now and again you catch a glimpse of a situation which
gladdens the heart, which offers the optimistic suggestion that old traditions
die hard.
The other day I was slumped, I mean slaving, over my Applemac when a din
interrupted my mental gestations. Outside, a gang of eight-year-old girls were
taunting a smaller group across the road. ``Scabies! Scabies!'' they shrieked
with a viciousness and energy which fair caught at my throat. I clasped my
hands together with delight. Perhaps there's some hope for the young 'uns after
all. Suffer, little children. Suffer. Generation Hex cares after all.

HELLO, is that the BBC? Is it a Team of the Year you are after for your Sports
Review of the Year prog? Look no further, my fine fellows, than the glittering,
Jim Leishman-led Livingston, whom you will find in the spanking new stadium at
Almondvale, all lights ablazing.
I was there, and proud to be, when Kilmarnock came for a special challenge
match on Monday night. OK, it was a friendly. But 3000 people turned up.
You see, there has never been a senior football club in the new town until this
year. That's when Meadowbank Thistle took on the mantle of Livingston FC and a
club and an all-seater stadium was born.
Today they are proudly on top of the Scottish third division, leading by four
clear points. If they beat second-placed Ross County this week I bet nobody
catches them in the second half of the season.
Bill Hunter, an East Lothian builder and the club chairman, is the man who made
it happen, backed wholeheartedly by the Livingston Development Corporation.
When he announced his intention to move the club from Edinburgh he and his
family were subjected to a sustained campaign of vilification by a small band
of supporters. He has seen them off.
When I was greeted by him on Monday night he told me they had held a dinner in
the town the previous Friday. ``We had 280 people there, which is more than we
often had attending matches at Meadowbank.''
Thistle, which had developed from the Ferranti works team, had a perfectly
decent record as a senior side - under manager Terry Christie they almost
gained entry into the premier division. But the stadium built for the
Commonwealth Games did not allow room for promotion - even when Meadowbank drew
a plum cup-tie they had to stage it somewhere else.
Hunter bit the bullet, became convinced he could build a new support and now
runs an operation which is the envy of most of the clubs in the country. ``I
was really tickled at that dinner. One guy paid #450 for a shirt signed by Ruud
Gullitt, somebody else coughed up #1300 for a framed Livingston jersey.''
He must be the only club chairman in the land whose office is next door to that
of the cleaner - ``In this game you never know what is going to happen next.''
It was time to have a look at the team. All credit to Kilmarnock, they sent a
full squad and manager Alex Totten, who does not tolerate non-triers, was in
the dug-out.
Totten wasn't over-happy when Robert Connor, late of Aberdeen, slid a cross
past his own keeper. Never mind, Stewart Williamson did the same at the other
end, so the big boys were back on track. Not for long.
A young trialist from Newcastle, named Cona Hislop I was assured, cracked in a
peach of a shot and before half-time Graham Harvey, who has had more clubs than
Arnold Palmer, made it 3-l for the home team before John Henry got one back.
Two unusual features: if the ball goes over the wall at the east end it rarely
comes back; the Labour and SNP parties both have permanent trackside adverts. I
wonder how long a Tory one would last?
Missed Gordon McLeod's fourth goal for Livvy because I was finishing my pie
with Peter Donald, high heid yin of the Scottish League. We remark on the
number of families, mothers as well, who are present.
``If you had to introduce families to football,'' muses Peter, ``can you think
of a better place to do it than here?'' I was back to acclaim goal No.5, from
lively winger Mark Duthie. Livingston had played good football, shown some fine
individual skills and we hadn't had a chant or an F-word from the crowd all
night.
Back in the boardroom Ann Young, the club's marketing manager - her father,
Billy Nimmo, played in goal for Leeds and was Kevin Keegan's hero, so it's in
the blood - was insisting: ``This whole scenario is going to work, the
community is behind us.''
Then in he came, the poet himself. ``You know me,'' said Jolly Jim, with a
wink, ``I have no great tactical awareness. I just like them to pass the ball,
deny the opposition possession, and fire in the odd shot. Simple, really.
``We know fine that was just a friendly, that Kilmarnock let us play, but it
does the boys' confidence a power of good.''
Being around Jim Leishman, an inspired choice, does that for everybody. I want
a Livvy Lions T-shirt in my stocking, please.
And I expect action from the BBC. It's down to you, Dougie.

<HEADLINE>UK a haven for Islamic militants, claims Egypt</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BRITAIN was home to Muslim militants fighting the Egyptian government since
1992 and could suffer in the end from militant activities, Egypt's interior
minister Hassan el-Alfi said today.
``There are information centres for the terrorists who roam British soil and
who hold conferences there,'' the minister was quoted as saying in Cairo's
al-Ahram newspaper.
``They also get their instructions (to attack) there and all the attacks that
occur are commissioned from outside Egypt,'' he added.
Last week, the militant Jihad (Holy Struggle) group claimed responsibility for
blasting the Egyptian embassy in Pakistan in which 16 people died and at least
60 were wounded.
Two other militant groups said they were behind the bombing, and one also said
it killed an Egyptian diplomat in Geneva earlier this month.
The minister also warned the United Kingdom that it would be ``burned by the
fire of terrorism'' as long as it gives these groups asylum.
Egypt claims that several Arab and European countries host fugitive militants,
who sometimes claim asylum on human rights grounds.
The government in Cairo charges that some, like Sudan, train militants aiming
to topple President Hosni Mubarak.
About 900 people have been killed in political violence in Egypt since 1992.
Meanwhile, Egypt's parliamentary elections tomorrow have captured the interest
of a larger than expected number of voters, and many said on election eve that
they would cast ballots.-Reuter.

THE eccentric German artist who owns Eigg is facing an investigation in
Stuttgart after allegations of fraud.
Marling Eckhard-Maruma bought the island in July, promising millions of pounds
to turn it into a holiday paradise.
A spokesperson for the prosecutor's office in Stuttgart said yesterday: ``We
have opened a formal investigation for investment fraud.''
She said the investigation mainly concerned statements made by Mr Maruma in
brochures promoting the Maruma AG Holding.
She said a person who cannot be identified for legal reasons had supplied
information concerning Mr Maruma's business activities, which had been checked
for several weeks before the prosecutor called for the formal investigation.
Mr Maruma was not available for comment yesterday.
Rumours have circulated about the income allegedly generated by the self-styled
professor's fire-paintings.
A 1993 brochure issued by Maruma AG Holding woos would-be investors by claiming
enormous profits from the spiralling value of the paintings, which would serve
as the holding's main assets.
However, as an investigation by The Herald earlier this year had established,
no German museum, art gallery, or important arts dealer had heard of Mr Maruma.
Even at his home base in Stuttgart, where he runs his so-called Maruma Centre
from a disused factory, he was unknown on the local arts scene.
Mr Maruma insists the Maruma AG Holding never left an embryonic blueprint
status.
Before the launch of the investigation, he told The Herald he had devised a new
art concept years ago.
``But I dropped it without its having been put into practice. The Maruma AG
Holding was never established nor has a single share been sold,'' he said.
He added: ``The blueprints were drafts, plans, concepts, trying to establish
whether such a system would work.''
The prosecutor decided on a full inquiry as press reports are insisting the
material they were shown looked like a brochure designed for a wider
circulation.

THE Chancellor stood accused last night of helping old cars more than old
people.
While politicians and elderly groups in Scotland welcomed parts of the Budget,
they said it did not go far enough to help the vast majority of pensioners and
would not stop the enforced sale of family homes to pay for residential care.
Mr Clarke raised the savings limit below which people qualify for free
residential care from #3000 to #10,000. In addition the higher band beyond
which people have to meet the full cost of care rises from #8000 to #16,000.
Edinburgh District Council's Tory group leader, Daphne Sleigh, who led a
campaign to increase the thresholds, said last night: ``I am pleased he has
responded so quickly but we are only half-way there.
``I was hoping to have the upper threshold raised to #35,000 or #40,000 and I
will be looking for the rest of it next year. He has made a good start and it
will be welcomed by many people.''
However, SNP health spokesman Iain Glen said the Chancellor had helped vintage
vehicles with road tax exemption rather than elderly people.
``Old cars are being looked after better than old people, who will still have
to sell their homes to meet residential care costs. It is a Budget for the
better-off and it doesn't help the elderly except marginally,'' he said.
Ms Hilary Patrick, legal adviser to the Scottish Association for Mental Health,
said raising the higher band would help many people who could not be described
as rich.
``But Mr Clarke has not attacked the main problem: the way the family home is
taken into account. People will still have to sell their homes to pay for
residential care.  They will not be able to pass the house on to their
children. When the NHS was founded we were promised care from the cradle to the
grave. That promise has been broken and the Budget has not altered this.''
Of Scotland's 800,000 people over the age of 65, only 17,000 live in a
residential care homes.
Ms Maureen O'Neill, director of Age Concern Scotland, said the failure to
increase capital limits for other means-tested benefits meant the system was
still penalising older people with savings living at home.
``Tax cuts will not help the vast majority of Scottish pensioners. Only one in
three pay any tax and a couple aged over 75 would have to have an income of
more than #10,000 to benefit from these measures. The Budget contained nothing
to benefit poorer pensioners or to help older people with winter heating
bills,'' she added.
Mr Clarke also increased the inheritance tax threshold from #150,000 to
#200,000 and said the Government would be consulting on new schemes to reward
people who planned for the cost of care in retirement.
Ms Lily Kennedy, chairperson of Strathclyde Elderly Forum, said: ``We are angry
and disappointed. The Chancellor has ignored the problems facing the vast
majority of older people.
``We desperately needed the Budget to address fuel poverty, the frozen savings
limits for means-tested benefits, and the appallingly inadequate pension.''
She said the savings threshold increases affected only 2% of the elderly
population and would not stop pensioners being forced to sell their homes.
``There is also little point in increasing the threshold of inheritance tax if
the family home has been sold to pay nursing home fees,'' she added.
The Labour Party dismissed the Budget announcement on long-term care for the
elderly as inadequate and predicted it would not stop people having to sell
their homes to pay for the care they needed.
Labour's social security spokesman, John Denham, and health spokesman Alan
Milburn said: ``With the average house worth #67,000, the new #16,000 capital
disregard will not safeguard the homes of elderly people who believed they had
been promised care from the cradle to the grave.
``Without clear national guidelines people with assets above the new threshold
will still be paying for care which may be free in other parts of the country.
Under the Conservatives where you live determines the care you get and the
prices you pay. We challenge the Health Secretary to make access to care a
matter of right not a matter of chance.''
Labour also claimed that most members of occupational pension schemes simply
could not afford to buy long-term care insurance. According to the National
Association of Pension Funds a pensioner couple would have to cut their pension
by #3000 a year to allow for higher payments if they need long-term care.
The savings limit has been one of the most contentious aspects of Care in the
Community as old and dependent people were transferred from NHS care into
social services care. A maximum of #3000 in savings were allowed before a
contribution to the cost had to be made, on a scale up to #8000, when the
entire cost had to be met by the client. That scale now begins at #10,000, with
the full charge payable if savings exceed #16,000.

BRIAN Lara will not take part in the forthcoming short tour of Australia by the
West Indies, and that may be the best bit of news first-class cricket has had
in many a long day.
Not that the supreme talent of Lara will not be profoundly missed, but this
withdrawal, at the player's own wish, may be the dawn of sanity in the game.
Lara is unusual, perhaps unique, in that he is capable of playing an innings
which is both long and flamboyant.
Normally, great batsmen divide into two clearly recognisable camps.
There are the Bothams, few in number, ferocious in attack, but by definition
seldom at the crease for two days.
Then there are the Bradmans and Boycotts, prodigiously gifted technically, but
with a cast of mind which makes them willing accumulators.
Lara does not appear to have this obsessive desire to make runs heavily all the
time, especially when all the time means six days a week, 52 weeks a year.
His talent is such that his rare, but inevitable, failures provoke almost a
palpable hostility from those spectators who have paid heavily, but on that day
will see little of the tiny genius.
Genius by definition is variable. It cannot be turned on like a tap. Competence
is steady, genius variable.
Warwickshire members were entitled to hope that Lara would fulfil his contract.
He will not.
The reason? There is far too much international cricket played; far too many
Tests and infinitely far too many dreary, meaningless one-day matches.
The tournament which Lara has opted out of was just such a tedious affair, and
the player himself shows good judgment here.
More significantly, he has just been fined because he went AWOL on part of last
season's English tour. The first-class game the world over is underpinned by
the County championship in England.
It not only produces English players, but cricketers worldwide use it to learn
their trade. There is literally nowhere else to do this.
Now, England supremo Ray Illingworth proposes to take powers to compel the
counties to drop their England players from their sides in the run-up to
England Test matches.
Fred Trueman was a considerably better bowler than anything available to
England at the moment, and he prepared for Tests by bowling fast in County
matches, not by theorising in the nets.
Surrey, or Somerset, or Yorkshire have, at the most, nine home County fixtures
per season and now may well lose their star turns for four or five of these
matches.
This is bound to happen as the counties lose control of the game in the short
term, as the FA have lost it to the Premiership, and the SRU may well do to a
handful of powerful clubs.
It is bound to happen as the new breed of sporting entrepreneurs proclaim
glibly that sport is now a ``managed event'' rather than the glorious
uncertainty we always took it to be.
Fine, if you realise that the price you pay in going after passing trade may
well be the permanent alienation of your former regular customers.
In football terms, ``the good news, Walter, is that Andy Goram is back in the
Scotland side. The bad news is that he misses your next five league matches.''
Great batsmen are not wound up by keys in their backs. They don't become great
by participating in ersatz bunfights.
Seems to me we owe Lara a nod of gratitude.

Leonard Cohen, once branded a boring old drone, is now fted as one of the
greatest and most literate songwriters
HE was called the Godfather of Gloom or Laughing Len if you wanted a touch of
irony; the man whose music you should listen to if contemplating suicide (or as
some would have it, you might contemplate suicide after listening to his
music). He was the man with the lugubrious features who sang dolefully of love
ending, of passion spent, in songs like Suzanne, So Long Marianne, Sister of
Mercy . . . Or as one British music paper summed him up somewhat unkindly -
Leonard Cohen was a boring old drone who should get back to Canada where he
belonged.
But that was a long time ago. In a dramatic revival of his career with the
fabulous 1989 album, I'm Your Man, followed by The Future, critics finally
hailed him as one of the greatest and most literate songwriters of our time,
even recognising the wit and euphonies in his work that had always been
overlooked in favour of the pessimism and pain.
``They've started being quite charitable, even downright complimentary in
Europe and Canada,'' he says in a gloriously deep and sensual voice, as you
would expect from a man who sings, especially about sex, on the same scale as
Barry White.
``But in America I still have to justify the fact that I dare to sing. It's
pretty well accepted that I know how to write a song but the conventional
wisdom is that I should leave it to others to sing them. I can't say my
feelings are hurt. It amuses me.''
The Americans then, will no doubt approve of a newly released tribute album of
his songs, which features an impressive line-up of stars including Elton John,
Bono, Sting, and Peter Gabriel, all paying their respects to the musical poet.
Leonard Cohen, a polite and unassuming man, appears to be genuinely delighted
that people still wish to listen to his music, huge-ly flattered that singers
should wish to record his tunes, and these days impervious to critics.
He began his writing career as a poet, which brought international recognition
while still in his early twenties, then turned to prose with two novels, The
Favourite Game, a portrait of the artist as a young Jew in Montreal, and
Beautiful Losers. ``James Joyce is not dead,'' declared one critic. ``He is
living in Montreal under the name of Cohen.''
``A friend of mine, a great Canadian poet, said the two characteristics
essential to a young poet are arrogance and inexperience. I had plenty of both
so when they compared me with James Joyce I thought, `Yes, that's about right'.
I have a somewhat different view of it now,'' he says with a wry smile.
Cohen left Canada long ago and now lives in California, in a Zen monastery,
6000 feet up a mountain. He rises at three o'clock in the morning and proceeds
to the meditation hall where he sits upright on a cushion for a few hours, his
eyes closed, his knees crossed, his mind open. After breakfast he works -
shovelling paths, cooking, cleaning - then returns to meditate further.
In the evening he often sits in the cabin of the 87-year-old Zen monk who
founded the retreat, the Roshi, where even a discussion of the vodka they are
drinking carries a philosophical flavour. Cohen first became interested in the
practice of Za Zen 25 years ago, and since it required neither theological
discussion about the nature of God nor worship it did not come into conflict
with his family religion of Judaism.
``I was taught to swim by being thrown into a lake. This was the same. Nobody
told me what I'm supposed to think or where I'm to hold my mind. I just knew
that sitting there with myself seemed to have some nourishing capacity. It's
hard to do alone. I often do, but find the companionship of others very
helpful.''
So two years ago he moved from a modest flat in Los Angeles and settled in the
monastery, joining four monks and two students. Now he has near-resident
status, living in a little guest house where he keeps his synthesiser so he can
continue to write.
``It's a very nice way to live. A long time ago my mother said: `Follow your
little heart.' And I guess that's what I'm doing.
``Like anything else that's important or touches you deeply it's hard to
describe but it's the way I keep in touch with my heart, with what's really
true. It also keeps my back straight,'' he adds, his mouth twitching into a
faint ironic smile.
Ensconced in his guest house, Cohen is writing a new collection of songs, and
when finished, perhaps sometime next year, is considering a tour.
``Writing is my lover. I have this intimate feeling, like being in the embrace
of one's beloved. Though it can be infuriating. Someone is whispering to me but
it's often inaudible. You can't always hear what your beloved is saying. I
often beg for the whispers to be louder or clearer.''
The words may not always come easily but he now feels a necessity to write, a
need to hear himself ``speaking from a deep place''. Does it help him get
through life?
``I don't know. I've pretty well made a mess of that. Well, everybody makes a
mess of it in some way,'' he explains. ``You hurt people, structures you tried
to establish fail, you weren't the kind of friend, or father, you meant to be.''
Although he never married the mother of his children, Cohen is, in fact,
gratified by the relationship he shares with them. His daughter, Lorca, 21, has
a coffee shop in Los Angeles, while Adam, 22, has a band and thinks his father
is suitably talented to have all the credentials for a long and agonising life
in art.
``My father died when I was nine and it left me in a kind of ignorance about
how to be a father, so I'm very pleased to have maintained a closeness with my
kids even though we were separated a lot of the time. I didn't take to
domesticity,'' he admits. ``I avoided it at every possible instance.''
Cohen, a small man with cropped grey hair and dressed entirely in black, is now
61.
``I find it a very agreeable age,'' he says. ``Men mature late in our society.
It's very different for women but men really don't start to get a handle on
things until their fifties. And people are kind to you for some reason.
Policemen are nice. Customs officials are polite and women seem to forgive you
for many things which they found unforgivable when you were younger. It's very
agreeable.
``My Zen teacher said: `The older you get the lonelier you become and the
deeper the love you need.' I think it's very true and I'm fortunate that my
closest friends are still those I knew in school and that I still see the very
first woman I ever slept with - I think that's lovely.
``But I do have some young woman friends. As a friend of mine said when he was
well into his seventies, beauty never ceases to wield its tyrannies and its
terrors, and its promises . . .''
Leonard Cohen smiles at the thought. The Godfather of Gloom looks happy enough.
n Tower of Song - the Songs of Leonard Cohen was released on A &amp; M Records last
month.

THE democratic deficit faced by Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth when he
unveils his constititutional reforms tomorrowis highlighted in a report showing
that five in every six pieces of recent legislation applying to Scotland have
been tagged on to English and Welsh legislation.
``The Tory Party has become so pro-English as to subject Scotland to weak
clauses tagged on to essentially English legislation,'' argued Scottish Liberal
Democrat parliamentary spokeswoman Ray Michie yesterday.
She was publishing a report based on figures gathered from the House of Commons
library demonstrating how marginalised Scottish legislation has become in
recent years, with English Tory MPs packing committees and Scottish matters
simply appended to inappropriate English measures.
``Scottish legislation has been bullied through the House of Commons in an
unacceptable manner, with little attention having been paid to the wishes of
the Scottish people,'' said Argyll and Bute MP Mrs Michie.
She said Conservative measures, such as boosting the Scottish Grand Committee,
did not go nearly far enough.
``The Government's rhetoric has so far exceeded its action. A talking shop is
no substitute for a Scottish Parliament.''
Her study found three symptoms of the deficit: too many Bills were tagged on to
inappropriate English legislation; committees considering these Bills had far
too few Scottish members; and those Scottish Bills which were considered
usually had English Tory MP's appointed to ensure a Tory majority at committee
stage.
``Scottish issues are all too easily overlooked in the desire for legislation
to be rushed through Parliament. This year, just as in the past, Scotland has
had to make do with English oversights,'' she said.

Ross Finlay finds the Almera has an identity of its own
NISSAN chose the name Almera for its new car to replace the Sunny, partly on
the grounds that it is pronounced the same way in all European languages. And
yet, I have heard some people call it the Almeera while others automatically
say Almayra. There is just no standardising folk!
Model names are often a problem, partly because so many possibilities are
legally reserved by companies who may never use them. There is a minor industry
in researching and nabbing likely names. That is one reason why so many
companies moved on to model numbers, but customers, especially in Japan, do not
like them. Names are not intercontinental, though. In Japan the Almera is
called the Pulsar.
Anyway, Nissan hopes that Almera is a livelier kind of name than Sunny. The new
model shows that the company wants to branch out and attract more, as well as
different, customers, and not just the ones who would automatically replace one
Sunny with another.
There is no doubt that the Sunny had an image which many younger and perhaps
sportier people did not think of as their own, despite the model's successes in
competition. Alister McRae, after all, won this year's top UK rally
championship in a Sunny GTi.
However, there is a curiosity about Nissan's UK customers which I had not
appreciated until somebody mentioned it at the launch of the Almera. The
motoring press regarded the little 100NX coupe as pretty much of a failure,
dismissing it as what some people sneeringly refer to as a hairdresser's car.
And yet, when it slipped off the market, Nissan had so many outstanding orders
for it here, and more in the pipeline, that the company moved production to
another factory and kept building it in smaller numbers for six more months.
Despite all the statistics about company cars, something like one third of all
new car registrations in this country every year are small family types like
the Almera. Nissan seems to be in a stronger position with the Almera, when you
set it against its class rivals, than it ever was, using the same comparison
year by year with the Sunny.
I am surprised that some critics have given the Almera a fairly lukewarm
reception. The 1.4-litre three-door Si I have been driving, with the Loden
green exterior which shines like a fluorescent beacon in a crowded car park, is
a car with a strong identity of its own, something which was always lacking in
the different generations of Sunny.
The front-end treatment provides a family styling link with the Primera, and I
prefer the three-door's generally simpler appearance to the rear-end of the
five-door. That version follows the trend to rather confused lines which the
Scottish Motor Show demonstrated is ``catching'' throughout many rival model
ranges.
At #10,495 the test car came with the mid-range Almera specification, providing
a good range of interior equipment and lively trim. The 1392cc engine peaks at
88bhp, allowing a 0-60mph time of about 12.5 seconds and a test track maximum
around 105mph. According to the new EC calculations, it is likely to average
about 40mpg in normal use.
Except in its more sporting guises, the Sunny was not a car which enjoyed
itself when you tried to explore its handling limits. The Almera is different,
thanks not only to the whole plan to give it a more youthful feel, but also, in
hardware terms, to the multi-link rear suspension borrowed and scaled-down from
Nissan's flagship QX saloon.
The handling is transformed, on fast corners as well as on the kind of
up-and-down country roads with bends over brows which would unsettle most types
of Sunny. In fact, although this is a judgment I heartily dislike pronouncing,
the Almera could happily cope with more power than the 1.4-litre model offers.
Of course, that is why there is also a 1.6.

BOWLS
DEFENDING champion John Price and three-times world indoor champion Richard
Corsie both eased through their opening matches in the CIS Insurance Masters at
Coatbridge yesterday and will meet in the semi-finals this afternoon.
Price was the first in action and battled to a 7-3, 7-5 win over East Lothian's
Graham Robertson in a repeat of last year's final.
The Welshman was quickly joined in the last four by Corsie, who needed just
seven ends to defeat Irelands' world outdoor champion, Margaret Johnston, 7-1,
7-1.
Robertson picked up a double on the opening end of his clash with Price, but
immediately dropped behind when the defending champion counted three shots on
the second end.
The players then traded singles to leave Price 4-3 ahead before the Swansea man
stepped in with another count of 3 to take the opening set.
The East Lothian man dropped singles on the first two ends of the second set,
but then a double and a single pushed him 3-2 ahead.
Doubles on the next two ends took Price to within one of victory at 6-3, but
Robertson countered with two singles to be only one down going into the ninth
end.
Price struck with his penultimate delivery and pushed the jack into the ditch.
Robertson drew to within a yard with his last bowl, but Price proved more than
up to the task by drawing shot with his last bowl.
While Price had to work hard for his win Corsie got things all his own way in
the battle of the Commonwealth champions. The Scot started and finished in
style with a maximum 4 on the opening end and the last for the easiest of
victories.
Tweedbank`s Joyce Lindores lost out in the battle of the world champions last
night when Andy Thomson coasted to a 7-3, 7-0 victory in 11 ends.
Thomson led 4-3 after four ends of the opening set and Lindores failed to score
again as the England international wrapped up a comfortable win.
Scottish champion Paul Conlan joined Thomson in the semi-finals with a 0-7,
7-6, 7-5 victory over fellow-Scot Alex Marshall.

EXCLUSIVE
THE head of a major Japanese electronic plant is going public to urge the rest
of corporate Scotland to be less wary of constitutional change and to join in a
productive debate about the future.
In the run-up to tomorrow's St Andrew's Day unveiling of the rival
constitutional options, there have been claims and counter-claims about the
attitude of the business community to change. These have been based mainly on
anonymous rumblings of concern or optimism.
Now the head of the Mitsubishi video recorder factory at Livingston has put his
head above the parapet of corporate Scotland to add his voice publicly to the
debate.
Mr Alan Gemmell has agreed to appear on the St Andrew's night edition of Words
with Wark on BBC tomorrow to discuss the options and to urge other business
leaders to do the same.
``I can only give a personal view,'' said Mr Gemmell yesterday. ``As a company,
we are very strong on Scotland and we have four manufacturing plants here.
``If people ask whether in the light of political change would we be pulling
out or reducing our investment here, the answer is obviously not - we are
already committed here.''
Mr Gemmell said Scotland was competing for business with the likes of the
Republic of Ireland and Spain and any future Scottish political administration
would have to recognise that. ``If they did anything to damage inward
investment, that would be particularly irresponsible.''
He confirmed that by this he meant that he did not believe such
irresponsibility was likely, which was why he was perhaps less fearful of
change than some in the business community.
``A lot of it is fear of the unknown,'' he said. ``A lot of those who do not
want to take part in the debate just don't know the answers. People are wary of
something that may or may not be coming from a party line.
``A Scottish Assembly would be Labour-orientated and I am not so sure that the
Labour Party has got to grips with what industry wants. The Scottish Office has
the tint of Mr Lang and Mr Forsyth. Labour still has to find its feet.
``There is also the fact that we have had one Government for so long, even
without the devolution issue there is a nervousness about change.''
Mitsubishi opened its television plant at Haddington in East Lothian in 1979
and the video factory at Livingston in 1983, the year Mr Gemmell joined the
company.
The firm also manufactures air-conditioning equipment in the West Lothian new
town, and at Glenrothes in Fife they produce Apricot personal computers. Total
employment in Scotland is 2000.
Words with Wark producer Alan Clements said yesterday: ``I would laud Alan
Gemmell's bravery in putting his head above the parapet.
``It is difficult for the business community and they are sometimes reluctant
to get embroiled in what they see as political controversy but we believe it is
important to get business people to join in the debate.''

MONKS Investment Trust's cautious view of the dizzy heights to which world
equity markets have climbed is reflected by the fact that nearly one-fifth of
the fund's #532m of assets are held in cash.
The Edinburgh-based trust yesterday reported an 11.2% rise in net asset value
to 634.1p for the six months to end-October.
Monks convincingly outperformed its benchmark FT World index, which advanced
only 5.0% during its first half, mainly because of the buoyant performance of
the fund's UK equities. The interim dividend was raised 75% to 3.5p, although
this move is aimed at reducing the disparity between the half-time and final
payouts.
n EDINBURGH Income Trust yesterday announced a 7.1% increase in total assets to
#15.2m for the six months to end-October. Net asset value per Ordinary share
rose 8.8% to 43.3p, after providing for the repayment cost of zero-dividend
Preference shares.

PARTICK Thistle manager Murdo MacLeod is confident he will sign Celtic's Mark
McNally, despite the fact that the player is in Southend, where he is being
considered for a possible move to the English first division club. MacLeod
spoke to McNally before he went south and is very hopeful that he will be able
to persuade the defender to travel the short route to Firhill rather than the
500-mile journey to Essex.
``I expect to speak to Mark when he returns before the weekend,'' said MacLeod,
``and I was aware that he was going to Southend for talks. You can never be
sure of anything, but I believe we still have a good chance of bringing him
here.''
The word from the south is that Southend are eager to pip the Scottish club for
the Under-21 internationalist's services. Their manager, Ronnie Whelan,
admitted that Celtic had not been prepared to let McNally join them on a
month's trial, but agreed to let him go down this week.
McNally has been signing month-to-month contracts since the start of the
season. Parkhead manager Tommy Burns sold winger Paul Byrne to Southend for
#60,000 earlier in the season.
Meanwhle, Hibs are facing up to yet another injury crisis as they prepare to
meet Motherwell, themselves in the midst of injury chaos, at Fir Park on
Saturday.
Manager Alex Miller is close to being able to name a full side of those queuing
up for treatment in the casualty department. The list includes nine first-team
contenders and covers every area of the team bar goalkeeper, where the ageless
Jim Leighton stands firm.
Motherwell have a host of first-team men to check out as well, among them
Dougie Arnott, Shaun McSkimming, and Jamie Dolan.
Falkirk might still be able to persuade Aberdeen's Paul Kane to make a move to
Brockville after the former Hibs man's earlier decision to stay put at
Pittodrie. The clubs had agreed a fee but, although Kane turned down the terms
offered, it could be that the neogiations will be re-opened.

NORCROS shareholders are still waiting for details of the proposed flotation of
its print and packaging division, but chairman Michael Doherty said he was
determined the matter would be settled by the end of this financial year,
writes ANDREW WILSON.
Meanwhile, the interim results show continued pressure in print and packaging
although ceramics enjoyed a marginal improvement, so the combined operating
profit from the continuing businesses was stable at #10.9m.
The impact of the restructuring which will result in Norcros turning into a
ceramics-only business has considerably distorted the pre-tax total. The sale
of the five building products activities brought in #51.4m in cash which threw
up some #12m of surplus with another #1m coming from the release of earlier
provisions to boost stated pre-tax profits by #9.72m to #18.7m.
Although Norcros has ended up with earnings of 2.2p per share from actual
trading and 9.8p including the asset surplus, the lack of distributable
reserves means no dividend can be paid.
The shares eased 3p to 75p with sentiment affected by Monday's warning from
Spring Ram about the continuing difficulties in the building sector.

SNOOKER
RONNIE O'Sullivan reached the last eight of the Royal Liver Assurance UK
Championship yesterday and boasted: ``I have got more ability than anyone else
left in the tournament.''
The former champion, who completed a 9-2 demolition of Scotland's Chris Small
in Preston, said: ``If I hit form I can win it again. But I cannot really look
forward any further than my next match. There are no easy games and I've got a
tough quarter-final coming up.''
O'Sullivan began with a 7-1 overnight lead and although Small won the first
frame of the day, it was only delaying the inevitable. Twenty-seven minutes
later he cruised into the last eight, helped by breaks of 42 and 38.
``If I'm playing well, I can say I have won a tournament even before it
started,'' added the 19-year-old from Essex. ``That's how confident I feel.
``When I am flowing, it's a beautiful game. It's something you can't explain.
Only a sportsman knows what its like when their game comes together. It's so
easy and the best feeling in the world.''
Desite the world No.3's insistence that there are no longer any pushovers, he
has enjoyed an easy passage into the quarter-finals - Edinburgh-based Small is
the lowest ranked player he has faced.
The 22-year-old Scot failed to make a game of it during yesterday's first
session and said: ``I'm usually full of nerves before and during the match, but
I felt nothing. Perhaps that's the reason why I couldn't get going.''
Meanwhile, Stephen Hendry yesterday landed a lucrative five-year deal with
snooker equipment manufacturer E J Riley.
The world champion, who faces Irishman Ken Doherty in today's quarter-finals,
has signed a contract which will earn him around #660,000.
Hendry has been associated with the Lancashire-based firm since the early
stages of his career and the present deal will take him to the year 2000.

EVERY breath taken by a critically ill two-year-old girl was being monitored by
doctors and nurses last night after a 106mph dash by a relay of police cars.
The cars delivered a vital piece of fibre-optic tube 450 miles from Kent to the
Royal Hospital for Sick Children at Yorkhill, Glasgow.
The through-the-night journey, completed in four hours and 17 minutes, was made
in response to a plea from the hospital to Abbott Laboratories, in Sheerness.
It came after the girl, who has not been named, had been admitted from
Lanarkshire suffering from meningococcal septicaemia - blood poisoning caused
by the bacterium responsible for meningitis.
The fibre-optic catheter was inserted through a vein in the girl's neck and
passed along to the heart.
Dr Pim Kon, Abbott's senior medical adviser, said last night: ``The tube is
connected at the other end to a machine which the hospital already has. It
operates by shining a light at the heart area and measuring the level of the
reflection.
``The amount of light absorbed by the tissues is computed to measure how the
heart and lungs are performing. This lets the staff know how much oxygen and
fluids to give the patient.''
Two of the #150 tubes were delivered after inquiries at other hospitals in
Scotland and the North of England failed to turn up any of the right size.
The first leg of the journey north, by police traffic car, took the equipment
to Lancashire. A Kent Police spokeswoman said: ``We handed it over to the
Lancashire force and it was relayed from there to Glasgow via police in
Cumbria, Dumfries and Galloway and Strathclyde.''
A special lane and toll booth were opened at the Dartford Tunnel in Kent.
Further north, a closed section of the M6 was reopened to allow the police cars
and their cargo through.
A hospital spokesman said: ``We are tremendously grateful to the police. The
equipment will help us monitor the little girl's heart output over the next 48
hours, which will be critical.''

Washington
PRESIDENT Clinton has made a ``good start'', according to Senator Bob Dole, in
persuading Congress to support his Bosnia policy.
Mr Clinton addressed the nation last night, and the broadcast was carried on
all the networks, and he justified sending 20,000 troops to Bosnia, but his
chief audience was in Washington.
He does not need immediate Congressional support, but if the US contingent is
to stay in Bosnia for the ``year or more'' that the planners expect, the
president will need Congress to find the money. So his main objective is to
convince members of Congress that the operation is in the national interest.
He appears to have persuaded Mr Dole, uncontested leader of the Republicans,
which means that the Senate will follow him.
The senator said today: ``I want to support the president if I can. We have
only one president at a time in this country.''
He added: ``There comes a time when you have to be responsible and show
leadership,'' and that meant Congressional leaders standing up to support the
president.
A number of other influential senators, on both parties, stated that they were
inclined to support the president, with the same lack of enthusiasm shown by Mr
Dole.
Senator Phil Gramm, who is running for president, seized the opportunity to
distinguish himself by denouncing Mr Clinton's proposals. That will not be
enough to defeat the president.
The House of Representatives will be far more difficult.
The president will probably get the support of most of the Democrats, and will
therefore need 50 or so Republicans.
Several polls published today show that a majority of Americans oppose sending
troops to Bosnia.
Meanwhile, Bosnian Serbs today backtracked on warnings of bloodshed over Nato's
peacekeeping operation in Bosnia. Bosnian Serb ``president'' Radovan Karadzic
said from his base in Pale, near Sarajevo: ``If American troops come here in a
friendly manner, they will find Serbs friendly. If foreign troops behave
completely impartially, they will find friends.''
His statement contrasted with earlier threats of carnage, Nato casualties going
home in body bags and a long struggle which would turn Sarajevo into another
Beirut.
Karadzic said Serbs wanted a peaceful solution to their demand to keep Sarajevo
suburbs where they have always lived, but which are due to be put under Bosnian
government control.
q Nato and Russia tonight reached an historic deal that has paved the way for
the Russians to play a full role in the Alliance-led peace mission to Bosnia.
``This is truly an historic day for Nato,'' said American Defence Secretary
William Perry after talks with Russian defence chief Pavel Grachev.
French Defence Minister Charles Millon said Russia and Nato had agreed a
formula for political control of the Bosnia operation, the last stumbling block
to Russian participation.
The Russian minister said later he was satisfied today's deal answered all
Moscow's concerns and would be approved by his government.
An earlier deal had already been struck allowing Russian forces to take part
without coming under the direct command of Alliance generals.
Today's deal not only clears the way for an unprecedented joint US-Russian
peacekeeping unit but also marks an important step toward closer political and
military co-operation between Moscow and its old Cold War enemy, Nato.
Grachev said about 1500 Russian troops would now join the Nato-led peace force.
They will be part of a multinational unit comprised mainly of members of the US
Army's 1st Armored Division and commanded by American Major General William
Nash.-Reuter/AP

Colorado Springs
A TWO-TON Chinese spy satellite could streak disastrously back to Earth next
April, American air force trackers warned today.
A spokesman for the US Space Command in Colorado Springs said it was too early
to predict where it might land, if it does not burn up on re-entry.
Aviation Week and Space Technology magazine reported that the FSW-1 satellite,
launched in October 1993, was passing over most of the world's heavily
populated areas, including central Europe.
If its parachute works and it has a ``soft'' landing, it could provide valuable
information about Chinese intelligence capabilities. But the US Air Force is
more concerned about it streaking to Earth in a populated area, said the
spokesman.
The Space Command tracks space debris and has a list of items larger than one
yard square that have more than a 5% chance of returning to Earth intact.
``Anything that could cause damage to lives or property goes on that list,''
said the spokesman. ``We expect this item to go on that list.''
Meanwhile Nasa said today it plans to send a spacecraft to within 62 miles of a
comet to capture dust samples and bring them back to Earth for analysis.
``This is the first time since the Apollo programme in the 1970s that a sample
of something interplanetary will be collected and returned to Earth,'' said Ken
Atkins, project manager at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
The spacecraft, Stardust, will be launched in February 1999 and will hurtle
through the solar system toward a fly-by of the comet Wild-2 in January 2004.
According to the plan, a return capsule bearing the comet particles will
parachute into a dry Utah lake bed in January 2006.
q China's official Xinhua news agency confirmed that Hong Kong's #150m AsiaSat
2 satellite had been placed successfully into orbit today after its launch from
southwestern Sichuan province atop a Chinese-made rocket. It gave no further
details.-AP/Reuter.

THE postal dispute erupted again yesterday when 70 staff failed to return to
work at Hamilton, despite voting in favour of ending their walk-out.
Royal Mail management said it was bitterly disappointed at the ``pointless
disruption'' which centred on union calls to have a manager switched from the
Hamilton sorting office.
Postal services were disrupted throughout Scotland last week by unoffical
action. A back-to-work deal involving the 5000 strikers was agreed on Sunday.
Hamilton, the only place where the strike was official, recorded a similar vote
on Monday.
However, when the Hamilton night-shift staff arrived for work, they were
infuriated to find Mr Gordon Johnson - who was part of a team drafted into the
office 16 weeks ago to improve working practices, in the office, despite
earlier demands that he be moved.
The night-shift workers mounted a picket and were joined by 70 postmen at
4.30am yesterday.
One of the pickets, Mr John Lynas, a union official for Lanarkshire, said: ``We
were told on Saturday when we met Royal Mail that Mr Johnson would be moved. He
was not. We will not return to work until he goes.''
Mr Steve Cameron, Royal Mail area manager, said: ``We are bitterly disappointed
that customers in Hamilton will suffer further disruption. Staff voted to
return to work on Monday and there were no conditions on that return.''
Mr Cameron said that - despite advice given by the Royal Mail, by the
Communication Workers' Union divisional representatives, the staff vote, and
the wishes of their own customers - the CWU area representative had chosen to
continue the pointless disruption. ``I would urge staff in Hamilton to consider
their customers and return to work,'' he added.
Mr George Robertson, divisional representative of CWU in Scotland and Northern
Ireland, said there was now a danger of the dispute escalating.
He said: ``Many members from other areas are getting upset that Hamilton cannot
get back to normal working. We understood the back-to-work agreement meant the
removal of the so-called policing managers appointed to thrust the new methods
on us.''
There was further controversy when pickets reported to police that a Royal Mail
driver had run down one of their colleagues, who was slightly injured.
More than 5000 Scottish postal workers returned to work on Monday and began
clearing a 12 million-letter backlog which built up during the strike.
Last night, Royal Mail management said staff were pulling out all the stops to
clear the backlog. A spokesman said: ``In the worst affected areas, it will
take one week to clear.''

POTATO processors in Britain should respond to the ending of the quota system
by cutting imports and increasing their use of home-grown potatoes, it was
suggested yesterday.
John Heading, chairman of the Potato Marketing Board, said the clarion call
from Government and processors had been: ``Get rid of quotas and regulation and
you will get investment in facilities to process more British potatoes in
British factories.''
It was now time for the processors to deliver on that call, he told the board's
annual meeting in London.
It is estimated imports of processed potatoes amount to about 700,000 tonnes a
year - mostly frozen chips.
``We know we do not have a divine right to grow these potatoes but we have
delivered the quota-free market which the processors wanted,'' Mr Heading said.
``We do have the expertise. We have a track record of reliable supply. We have
a good disease record. We have invested in the technology, the storage and the
structure to expand potato production to meet real market needs in the late
nineties.
``The sight of boatloads of Dutch and Belgian potatoes coming into our ports -
some from areas with considerable disease risks - is galling.''
Mr Heading called for the utmost vigilance to prevent the spread of brown rot
from Holland to the UK. ``We want to ensure no infected potatoes of any sort -
seed or ware - come into this country,'' he said.
He expressed concern that there were significant quantities of ware grade
potatoes already in the country which might not have been subject to the
rigorous inspection now being demanded. The Ministry of Agriculture had
deployed a team of 200 inspectors to examine all consignments.
Jim Cruickshank of Inverurie, vice-chairman of the board, said all growers
should be alert to the dangers of brown rot. The disease, which is notifiable
in the UK, causes tuber rotting and, therefore, a serious reduction in yields.
If it became established here it would pose a threat to the seed potato
industry, particularly in export markets. Infected land could be taken out of
production for five years.
The Potato Marketing Board chairman said the industry must guard against
falling consumption especially at times of high prices. This could be done only
if consumers were constantly reminded about the quality, nutrition and value
for money of home-grown potatoes.
``Stable prices for quality potatoes leading to steadily increasing demand is
our goal,'' he said. ``We have to put money into achieving that over the long
term.''
He said next year, which had been declared a no-quota year for potato growers,
would be a dry run for deregulation in 1997. In most respects the operation of
the Potato Marketing Board in 1996 would mirror the likely operation of its
successor body the following year.
There was good news on exports, he said with 1994-95 the best year on record
for British ware potatoes. Growers and merchants had been able to take
advantage of poorer yields and quality in continental Europe.

PRESSURE groups representing vulnerable sectors of society found little to
cheer in the Budget. Citizens' Advice Scotland criticised the cutbacks for
single parents, claiming it would cost them up to #300 a year.
Chief executive Martyn Evans said: ``I am also disappointed at the cuts in
housing benefit for young people who are, in increasing numbers, vulnerable,
facing rising housing costs or even the plight of homelessness. However, I
welcome the increases in child-care allowance as a small step in the right
direction.''
His views were shared by One Parent Families Scotland, which speaks for about
140,000 people. Spokesman Ian Maxwell said: ``Lone parents and their families
are overall losers in this Budget. The income tax cuts will do nothing for the
majority of lone parents who live on or below the tax threshold.
``Cutting welfare benefits paid to lone parents won't stop marriages breaking
down or relationships splitting, but it will make it even harder for lone
parents to make ends meet.''
Mr John Findlay, of One Plus, said: ``There can be no excuse for taking away
benefits which so many families need simply to survive.
``Any cut to one-parent benefit penalises parents struggling to rebuild family
life for their children by taking up employment, and is contrary to the
Government's stated aim of helping lone parents to escape benefits.''
The Scottish Low Pay Unit said the Budget had left low paid workers in the slow
lane while those on higher incomes would contribute even less to the
maintenance of public services.
Director Morag Gillespie said: ``This Budget is targeted at savings, financial
provision for old age, and people with personal wealth to pass to descendants.
``Low-paid workers struggle to manage from day to day and they have no scope to
set cash aside in the form of property, assets or other investments.
``The Scottish Low Pay Unit has a question for the Chancellor. How do you
benefit from savings and inheritance when you haven't got a penny to spare?''
Housing groups were also critical of Mr Kenneth Clarke. Shelter said the
decision to cut housing benefit to young people would lead to more homelessness.
Depute director Kate Caskie said: ``The Chancellor claimed that these proposals
will encourage young people to rent within their means. Many young people have
no means and will not be able to rent at all.''
The Scottish Federation of Housing Associations added: ``The Chancellor has
offered tax cuts for short-term political gain. What was needed was investment
for long-term economic and social gain.''
``Cuts in housing benefit are vindictive and counterproductive. The Budget
demonstrates that the Government cares little for those in real need.''

They meet tomorrow, and it is still not certain whether the Rangers' players
involved, Paul Gascoigne, John Brown and Alan McLaren, will attend that hearing
- their appearance, of course, is not necessary.
That committee will determine whether or not the players should be held
accountable for incidents which occurred during the Ibrox game when Rangers met
Aberdeen. The Pittodrie striker Billy Dodds also has an invitation to attend.
The various flash points at Ibrox were all missed by the match referee, which
has caused Rangers concern over the involvement of the referee supervisor,
whose evidence will be heard by the SFA committee.

EXCLUSIVE
THE campaign to reunite Railtrack and ScotRail has received backing from the
most unexpected of quarters - Swedish Railways, a front-runner in the
European-wide break-up of the industry.
Sweden approved a plan to separate ownership, responsibility for track,
signalling, and other infrastructure from the operation and running of trains
in 1988.
Its experience since then, judged a success, is widely regarded as the model
for the Tories' relentless drive towards rail privatisation in the UK since
1993.
But Swedish Railways' managing director, Mr Stig Larsson, has now concluded
that the decision to separate infrastructure from operations was wrong - and
that Sweden's railways benefited when kept together, according to delegates at
an international conference.
Mr Richard Prosser, general secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffs'
Association, said yesterday that Mr Larsson's comments were ``an
embarrassment'' to the Government, which has repeatedly cited the Swedish
experience when justifying privatisation.
Mr Larsson, at the International Transport Workers' Federation conference in
Budapest, appeared to argue that newly created railway companies were concerned
more with individual balance sheets than the network and services as a whole.
The conference, discussing concerns over changes in structure and ownership in
an increasing number of countries, subsequently called for infrastructure and
operations to be reunited.
Mr Larsson's declaration that those in charge of infrastructure had different
priorities than train operators coincided with the Rail Users' Consultative
Committee for Scotland warning that the split between ScotRail and Railtrack
was not working.
The break-up was damaging - diverting money, time, and effort away from
improving services and infrastructure - and there was no sense in having two
separate organisations ``to do what one did before, and did well''.
Mr Larsson's comments also coincide with increasing fears that Railtrack will
be sold at a give-away price because the Government is so eager to press on
with privatisation.
The conflict in Sweden over railway fragmentation has arisen despite a
restructuring far less radical than that underway in Britain.
For example, the private sector's input has been made easier in Sweden, because
it need not worry about investing in trains. The Government also provides the
infrastructure, with spending now running at three times the level prior to
1988.
Indeed, a trawl of European railway operators reveals that the UK programme is
``exceptional''.
Not only is the infrastructure owner, Railtrack, required to be
self-supporting, but train operators are subsidised to enable them to meet the
access charges.
In Sweden, where the majority of services remain in state hands, only a third
of track maintenance costs are recouped in access charges from train operators.

DARREN Gough believes a successful winter in South Africa could be just the
spark England need to start soaring up the world ratings.
Overall, England have looked more like chumps than champs in recent years -
losing five of their last eight series and beating only New Zealand.
But Gough pointed out: ``When we perform well, no-one in the world could beat
us.
``We showed that in Adelaide last winter by defeating Australia and twice
against West Indies during the summer.
``The problem is we are not having enough of those days. We need a good series
here to set it alight.''
England are certainly bubbling with optimism at present - and rightly so - as
they start preparing for tomorrow's second Test at The Wanderers.
The opening match of the series in Pretoria may have been ruined by rain, but
the way Mike Atherton and co. stood up to South Africa's prized pace attack was
highly encouraging.
``If it had been on a points system, we would have won the first Test,'' said
Gough. ``But now we have to start again and treat the game in Johannesburg as
the opening match of the series.''
Meanwhile, England's cricketers have been told not to worry about their safety
in the aftermath of the fatal shooting which took place during a boxing match
in Cape Town earlier this week.
England, who are based in Johannesburg for the second Test, have been assured
that there is no problem with security in a city regarded as one of the world's
most dangerous with muggings and shootings every day events.

Tyre, Lebanon
ISRAEL launched three air raids on Muslim guerrilla targets in south Lebanon
today after Katyusha rockets hit northern Israel.
The planes struck at areas used by guerrillas for infiltrating into Israel's
south Lebanon occupation zone.
Hizbollah earlier claimed responsibility for Katyusha rocket barrages that
wounded several people in northern Israel in the terror group's fiercest attack
for months.
Tens of thousands of frightened Israelis were sent scurrying into bomb shelters
across Galilee and Prime Minister Shimon Peres later visited the border area
and inspected one of several heavily damaged blocks of flats.
Waves of rockets slammed into eastern and western Galilee, damaging houses and
cars in a barrage that began when Israeli parents were taking their children to
school.
A first aid official in the northern town of Kiryat Shmona said four people
were slightly wounded by shrapnel and about 30 others were treated for shock.
In the first wave of Israel's response jets fired up to a dozen rockets in
three runs into Wadi al-Qaysiyyeh, a valley used by pro-Iranian Hizbollah
guerrillas for launching attacks.
In a second raid, jets rocketed an abandoned Lebanese army barracks on the edge
of the market town of Nabatiyeh before returning more than an hour later for a
third raid, firing another 12 rockets into Wadi al-Izzieh and other valleys
swarming with guerrillas, security sources said.
Hizbollah guerrillas in Lebanon had earlier mounted their fiercest rocket
attack on northern Israel in months.
Peres visited the border area and inspected one of several heavily damaged
apartment buildings.
Visiting the border town of Kiryat Shmona, Interior Security Minister Moshe
Shahal said: ``The Israeli government . . . response must be effective, strong
and of a scope that will ensure these events do not occur again.''
The waves of Katyusha rockets drew a warning from Israel's army chief that the
last active war front between Israel and its Arab neighbours could heat up.
``Hizbollah is endangering the well-being of many thousands of residents of
south Lebanon . . . I think the Lebanese government also should be very
troubled over what Hizbollah is doing within Lebanese territory,''
Lieutenant-General Amnon Shahak said.
Minutes after Shahak spoke, security sources in Lebanon said Israeli jets
blasted suspected guerrilla hideouts.
Waves of rockets slammed into eastern and western Galilee, damaging houses and
cars in a barrage that began when Israeli parents were taking their children to
school.
A first aid official in the northern town of Kiryat Shmona said four people
were slightly wounded by shrapnel and about 30 others were treated for shock.
Hizbollah, at the forefront of a fight to oust Israeli soldiers from an
occupation zone in south Lebanon, claimed responsibility for the attacks.

THERE was only one change in National Savings' products in the Budget but it
was an important one for pensioners.
From today, the qualifying age for buying the Pensioners' Bond has been reduced
from 65 to 60 and the maximum holding is increased from #20,000 to #50,000
(#100,000 for joint holdings).
The bond is a highly competitive product, with the current series paying 7.5%
fixed for five years, after which a new fixed rate is offered. Income is paid
monthly and is paid gross with no tax deducted.
After the new 20% rate on interest income takes effect next April, the net rate
will be 6% compared with 5.62% at present.
National Savings is forecast to increase its contribution to the Government's
coffers from #2500m to #3000m for 1995-96 and the new rules for the Pensioners'
Bond are likely to pull in much of this increase, largely at the expense of the
building societies.
Economic Secretary to the Treasury Angela Knight said the changes were what
pensioners had been asking for.
``Many retire earlier and want a good return on their money. The Pensioners'
Guaranteed Income Bond gives more people a good fixed return on their
savings,'' she declared.
q The earnings cap on which the maximum level of pension contributions to an
occupational or personal pension scheme is calculated has been uprated in line
with inflation to #82,200.

THE director of Strathclyde's education authority is to quit local government
in April, when he will join the ranks of the unemployed.
Mr Frank Pignatelli, who has run the region's education service since 1988 and
earns #94,500 a year, has told the new Glasgow City Council that he will not
take up the offer of a job with the unitary authority when his post disappears
with local government reform.
He saidyesterday: ``Given the nature of the job and the public reaction to it,
which has been very negative, I have decided that it would not be in my
professional or personal interests, or in the interests of the city council, to
take the post.
``Against that background I will resign and go into open competition for
alternative employment in April.''
Mr Pignatelli declined to elaborate, but it is known that he has been unhappy
about damaging comments which emerged after Glasgow City Council decided in
August that it wanted to use his talents to produce a strategy for the
continued funding of the voluntary sector, which is under severe pressure
because of the break-up of the region.
Like thousands of other local authority employees under 50, he has a statutory
right to be transferred to one of the new councils, with conservation of
salary, for three years. But colleagues believe he would have found it
difficult to adjust to what amounts to a lower-level, less influential post
which would be outside the city council's senior management team.
``It is the kind of task he would normally carry out between meetings,'' one
said last night. As Strathclyde's director of education Mr Pignatelli is
responsible for an annual budget of #1300m, 36,000 staff, and nearly 2100
schools and other educational establishments.
The Herald understands that contracts for the Glasgow job have not been
exchanged, but it would have involved Mr Pignatelli carrying out a strategic
and financial review to safeguard funding in Glasgow for organisations such as
single parent, ethnic minority, and special needs groups, as well as uniformed
organisations such as the Boys' Brigade and the Scouts.
Strathclyde's budget for the voluntary sector is #970,000, and Glasgow's share
would be smaller. There have been damaging comments about Mr Pignatelli taking
responsibility for the BB at a salary of #94,500.
Some Labour councillors have expressed concerns about the post emerging at a
time of cuts in services and jobs being ``disaggregated out of existence''.
It is likely the glare of adverse publicity would have intensified on the post
as Glasgow embarks on a programme of school closures to help cut costs: the
city faces particular funding problems because of its relatively poor tax base
and the comparatively high number of former regional staff assigned to tackle
its huge social problems.
Mr Pignatelli has not applied for any jobs as he has overseen the break-up of
the Strathclyde education service and the transfer of its responsibilities to
the new councils. Neither does he have a job lined up.
It is believed that his decision to turn down the Glasgow post will cost him
dear in financial terms. He did not qualify for redundancy and pension rights
under the staff transfer scheme because he is under 50.
He will not be 50 until December next year and if he had gone to Glasgow until
then, or had exercised his right to stay for the full three years, he would
have qualified on leaving for a lump sum of about #85,000 plus an annual
pension working out at about #47,000 with enhancement, or about #30,000 without
the discretionary element which has applied to other officers going early.
As it is he will qualify for a redundancy payment which will work out at less
than a year's salary, and he will not have access to his pension until he is 60.
A senior education source said last night: ``In a sense he has been caught in a
trap. He is too young to go and, with local government reform, there is no
other job which would allow him to exercise such a range of management
responsibilities.''
It is known that Mr Pignatelli is anxious to continue working for at least the
next 10 years at the same pace which has characterised his time at Strathclyde.
Headhunters invited Mr Pignatelli to apply for the job of running New York's
public education service but it was not a serious option for several reasons.
Mr Pignatelli is a member of several influential bodies including the Secretary
of State's advisory council on education and training targets, and chairs the
group given the key task of shaping the curriculum and assessment procedures
for the forthcoming reform of upper secondary schooling.

HOOVER, Midland Bluebird of Falkirk, and Scottish Pride are top scorers in a
new ``Scrooge index'' of companies which offer their employees no Christmas
cheer.
The Cambuslang Hoover operation, which employs some 780, was even singled out
for special mention in the Labour Research Department publication as this year
it has not only stopped its staff lunch but also scrapped parties for
pensioners and employees' children, thereby ending a 15-year custom.
Some of the 980 employees of Scottish Pride, the Glasgow dairy products
company, used to qualify for a #50 bonus and cartons of cream, but this perk
has disappeared under ``harmonisation''.
Out of 105 workplaces surveyed, 40 (38% of the sample) offered their staff no
Christmas dinner (whereas 32% did), or children's party (25%), a gift (21%),
employees' party (19%), bonus (10%), or time off for shopping (7%).
Forty five per cent of the companies offered two of the six benefits and 17%
offered three or more. Only two companies, Lombard North Central, of Surrey,
and Sericol, of Broadstairs, offered four benefits while the outright winner ,
providing five (dinner, bonus, gifts, shopping, and party) was clothing
manufacturer Dewhirst, of Peterlee, County Durham.

THE water company reporting season got under way yesterday with Severn Trent
reporting a 16% increase in pre-tax profit to #189m, writes NICOLA REEVES.
Profit from the core water services business rose by 12.5% to #206m. This was
largely down to tight cost control, with direct operating costs up by just 1.4%.
The costs included #6.7m of extra expenditure on measures to combat this year's
drought and control leaks from pipes. A further #5.2m of similar extra cost is
expected to be incurred in the second half of the year.
Chief executive Vic Cocker said Severn Trent's decision to spend an extra #130m
on resources and services over the next five years stemmed directly from the
drought conditions which dominated the first half of the year.
The board has retained Arthur Andersen to undertake a comprehensive review of
the main board directors' remuneration packages and, in line with the
recommendations made in the Greenbury report, it will report to shareholders in
the company's annual report to be published next June.
The interim profit and dividend was ahead of City expectations. There is a
second interim dividend of 3.84p payable in August 1996.

FORMER Scotland captain David Sole will not be at Murrayfield tonight for the
planned meeting with the Scottish Rugby Union over his criticism of a referee
after Edinburgh Academicals' premiership clash with Melrose.
Sole, who was unhappy with the performance of referee Colin Henderson following
a series of nine penalties against Academicals which led to an 18-15
injury-time victory for Melrose, said after the game that Henderson's
performance had been ``tantamount to cheating.''
The game was a crucial one for Academicals as they were then in the midst of an
ultimately unsuccessful battle for Division 1 survival.
SRU chief executive Bill Hogg said on Monday that the union had invited club
representatives to Murrayfield for an explanation and Academicals - one of the
union's founder members - had said that Sole, president Charlie Jackson, and
secretary Ken Lauder would attend tonight's face-to-face meeting.
Hogg said that ``all and every'' sanction was open to the union under bye-laws
relating to conduct not in the best interests of the game but only after
discussion would it be apparent whether sanctions were required or not.
Yesterday, Sole said that he could not attend the meeting because he was
baby-sitting.
``My wife has just started a business and she is going to be out. I have to
look after the children, so I can't make it to Murrayfield,'' he said.
The 1990 Grand Slam captain, who managed the Scotland under-19 side at the
Junior World Cup in Bucharest last season, said that he had already written to
Academicals, declaring that his comments about the refereeing had been made in
a personal capacity and had not been intended to embarrass them.
Yesterday, the SRU chief executive, asked if the meeting would still go ahead
in Sole's absence, said: ``This is a surprise. I confirmed no later than last
night with the club that they would all be coming. We shall have to speak to
them again to find out just what is going on.''

IT should take a kind of genius to persuade anyone to feel nostalgic for Soviet
communism. Seven decades of murder, repression, and economic chaos ought to be
quite enough to cure any society of its appetite for state socialism and the
fairytale of history's benign and inevitable tendencies.
Besides, didn't the West always argue that freedom, once tasted, would become
addictive; that the huddled masses of the old Soviet empire would take to
individualism and the free-market like famished men to a feast? Were not
prosperity, liberty, and political stability supposed to be their own best
advertisements? In Russia at least, it hasn't worked out that way.
With fewer than three weeks to go to elections to the lower house of the Duma,
setting the scene for presidential elections next summer, the Communist Party
and its allies are dominating the opinion polls. Ordinary Russians have
concluded that a few vastly expensive hamburger joints are no compensation for
crime, corruption, shambolic politics, and a crippled economy.
Who'd blame them? And who, really, would hold it against them if they despised
those westerners who sold them the dream of freedom while looting their country
four ways from Sunday? If Russia is in a mess that is the responsibility, first
and foremost, of the alliance which won the Cold War.
Now, in place of state repression, Russians suffer under a criminal Mafia that
straddles politics and the economy; in place of Soviet yes-men they are offered
parliamentarians who are either openly crooked or stupidly heroic (four have
been murdered in the past two years).
Strategic industries are being put up for auction - the choice is simple:
privatise or go bust - and the currency is a plaything for speculators.
Small wonder people tell themselves that in the old days they at least had
work, education, housing, welfare, and safe streets, paltry as each of these
may have then seemed compared to VCRs, BMWs, Levis, and Marlboros. In the old
days, they didn't get rich, but at least their salaries and pensions didn't
melt away in the night. Millions may have been murdered, but for the rest,
what? A very human formula; it could have been worse.
Since the party fell from power, or to be more precise, since the party bosses
switched their allegiances, ordinary people have experienced perhaps the most
crushing disillusionment of all. The single alternative to the old life, the
one glittering path that would make things better, has actually made them
worse. After the frying pan, the cruel fire.
This must be hard to comprehend if, all your life, you were seduced by images
of the decadent West. The democracies held out the only hope (keeping their own
people in line, meanwhile, with the fear of Soviet totalitarianism), and with
that hope exposed as a sham, what remains?
A mass return to the CP looks like naivety at best, desperate self-deceit at
worst. Long before it ceased to function as an instrument of control, the party
had lost the ability, never mind the will, to think. By the time it fell,
Soviet communism had not produced a new idea in 50 years.
There is no good reason, therefore, to imagine it has recovered its
intellectual vigour lately. Besides, does anyone really believe the West will
allow wholesale revisionism, even when democratically achieved? If the
Communists were to regain power, eastern Europe would be alive to the sounds of
plugs being pulled. Western companies would bale out and western banks would
haul down the shutters. The American right, meanwhile, would embark joyfully on
another arms binge.
However, the apparent rejection of ``modernisation'' by Russian voters tells us
more about the world than it does about the CP. Most of us grew up with the
myth there were only two political choices in the world. In particular, we were
obliged to believe if state socialism was wrong, free-market capitalism must,
as though true to the principles of the most banal syllogism, be right. It had
to be one or the other, and the world spent half a century on the brink of
immolation trying to decide which.
The message of Russia as the century closes is, perhaps, that both these
systems were intrinsically flawed, inherently cruel, and spectacularly
inefficient.
To the miners of Vorkuta high up in the Arctic, who went out strike on Monday
after receiving no pay for months, there is little to choose between old and
new. But choose, for all that, they must.

SALLY KERR views an exhibition which brings together a wealth of ideas covering
a vast range of subjects
THE Royal Overseas League 1995 Open Exhibition, touring for only the second
year in Scotland, is showing 56 works selected from the 500 individual pieces
submitted by artists from 27 Commonwealth countries.
More than #7000 has been awarded in prizes, with Lesley Banks, a graduate of
Glasgow School of Art, winning the ROSL Scottish prize and a travel scholarship
to Singapore.
The standard is consistently high with most overseas artists exhibiting in
Britain for the first time with a vast range of subjects and styles covered.
Joe Amenechi's Balawo, (a metal foil relief), shows the influence of his
Nigerian birth with the simplified features of a native subject.
There is hot emotion and rhythm in Dana Toki's Indoor Jazz, an abstract squash
of a painting, a vision of trumpet, saxophone and swirling music in thick
acrylics, while Karen Macaw's Going Adrift - a figure standing in a stormy
field engulfed by corn - is full of loneliness.
There is humour in John Kelly's Two Men Lifting a Cow (a huge square cornered
monster); and Antonio Argenio's Love - a squirming jelly of a man, all liquid
arms and legs and rubber mouth.
David Wheeler's Pomfret Sisters, a study in photo-realism, is an eerie view of
two women with symbolic chalice and bell, standing in front of a medieval
painting, a landscape of peasants and castle.
Still-life is given a new twist - Jane Williams' Three Studies for Banana in
Red, is stark and large, the primary rich colours lifting the subject, whilst
Robert White's Green Chillies, is a small contemplative piece.
There is no obvious link or theme in this show; and in fact that is its
strength. It is rare to visit such a creative exhibition and see so much talent
and vitality.

ends tomorrow.

On the eve of its 60th birthday, Hugh MacDonald, head of music    at the BBC,
speaks to Michael Tumelty about his fears, hopes, and plans for the SSO
THERE may be some imaginative reading of the runes required, but it is possible
- just possible - that the outlook for the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra,
which is suffering as much as other Scottish orchestras in the present bleak
climate, might be about to take an optimistic turn as the SSO heads for its
60th birthday next week.
On the downside, as it were, Hugh MacDonald, head of music at BBC Scotland, is
not pulling any punches when he says that the BBC SSO is as much ``in the
doldrums'' as the other Scottish orchestras. He is facing a 5% cut next year in
a budget that he claims is already trimmed as tightly as possible.
``We have great financial worries about how we're going to carry on,
particularly given the financial situation in broadcasting,'' he says. On the
home front, he says, if the entire BBC is having to cut its budget, then Radio
3 will have to cut its overall budget, and those cuts, in turn, will be passed
onto the corporation's orchestras, including the SSO.
And there is little comfort in looking at broader trends in Europe, he says,
citing Italy, which used to have five broadcasting orchestras, and now has one,
or Holland where, similarly, orchestral broadcasting resources are being
slashed.
Radio orchestras, says Hugh MacDonald, are now very vulnerable if they are
totally dependent on broadcasting. ``The whole raison d'etre for them being
formed in the first place has changed, if not disappeared. The BBC is no longer
a monopoly; we're surrounded - in radio terms alone - by hundreds of new
stations.''
The BBC governors have made a commitment to maintaining orchestras in this
country, says MacDonald. ``But they have also said that they expect the
orchestras to generate more of their own income.''
Sponsorship, he says, is very hard to get, is unpredictable, unreliable, and,
in any event: ``if we got any, we'd be taking it away from others''.
More lucrative and promising is the series of commercial recordings the SSO is
now engaged upon, which have evolved from a redefinition of BBC orchestras'
contracts, allowing recordings made for Radio 3 to be licensed on to record
companies. ``It's not a large amount of money, but it is contributing an amount
which is very useful,'' says MacDonald.
The main area of hope he sees for the future, is some sort of collaboration:
``The future for us is definitely some sort of partnership funding so we're not
totally reliant on the BBC.''
Which is exactly where the whole orchestral edifice has crumbled in the last
three years. First the proposed merger of the BBC SSO with Scottish Opera, and
the subsequent Liddell report; then the proposed collaboration with the other
Scottish symphony orchestras to replace Scottish Opera's orchestra, and the
ensuing Robertson report. All have run aground.
MacDonald, along with other orchestral chiefs, doesn't hide his disappointment
over the apparent collapse of the latter plan. ``Make no mistake about it; if
anything happened to the Scottish Opera orchestra, we'd be in there like a
shot.''
If none of these comes to fruition, then it leaves the BBC SSO in a situation,
he says, ``where we have as much stability or instability as the other
orchestras.''
What it has meant, says MacDonald, is that ``we've been in a state of
semi-stasis for three years. We weren't really in a position to plan ahead very
far. Certain things had to be put on hold. The merger discussions and all the
rest of it didn't work out, so now we can make decisions.''
Spearheading a series of important decisions is a determined statement of
intent. Despite all of the financial problems around the corner, says
MacDonald, ``I cannot conceive of the BBC SSO not carrying on. If it wasn't
there, it would be a unmitigated disaster for Scottish musical life. If it
wasn't doing the kind of things it does - especially the contemporary music
side and special projects - it would be an immeasurable loss.''
Up to 12 vacant posts in the orchestra have now all been advertised, and the
orchestra has been snowed under with applications. (Since musicians' contracts
were renegotiated, BBC orchestras' pay now places these posts into the category
of highly desirable.) Collaborations with other Scottish orchestras will be
pursued, as will the expanding commercial recording venture.
With special projects - such as Gavin Bryars's opera Medea, recently performed
at the Tramway, a series of five programmes of excerpts from obscure British
operas, and another four of neglected British symphonies from the fifties -
MacDonald says: ``We are proving our worth, artistically, in our
adventurousness, and I am absolutely determined that the SSO's role will be to
complement the other orchestras; we're not in the business of competing.''
But undoubtedly the main thrust of effort in breaking loose from the
``semi-stasis'' of recent years, will be the announcement, in the new year, of
a newly appointed principal conductor, another post that has lain vacant for
more than two years since the previous encumbent, Jerzy Maksymiuk, was
appointed conductor laureate.
``That,'' says Hugh MacDonald, ``will give us a tremendous shot in the arm.''
But he clearly intends it to be more than just that. ``We intend to build a
team; and with a new chief conductor in place, we've got the core of a good
team.''
As well as the new chief, says MacDonald, the SSO will have associate
conductor, Martyn Brabbins, ``very good with certain repertoire, and liked by
the recording company''.
Then there is the unstoppably energetic Polish conductor laureate, Jerzy
Maksymiuk. ``With his 120% commitment to everything he does, Jerzy is going to
be with us - for life. We will play to his strengths, and obviously they will
include contemporary music.''
And the latest appointment, Chinese composer Tan Dun, MacDonald sees as
``far-reaching''. Tan has an international reputation, and is producing some of
the most imaginative music on the scene. Association with him can only benefit
the orchestra, suggests the head of music.
Even beyond the establishment of an in-house team, MacDonald has plans to
rationalise and focus the range of conductors employed by the orchestra. ``We
want also to cultivate some other people that we know work well with the
orchestra.'' The superb French and Russian conductors, Jean-Yves Ossonce and
Alexander Titov, were named.
``Rather than having a constantly changing variety of guest conductors, we need
to narrow it down, aiming for a more coherent and consistent presentation.
``I want the orchestra to develop its strengths, and concentrate more on
them,'' says Hugh MacDonald. ``We're always going to play Beethoven, Mozart,
and Brahms.
``But this orchestra has got more than just technical competence in
contemporary music. It has a natural affinity. It gives a special kind of
commitment which is quite rare, and we need to capitalise on that.
``We can forge an identity which means that when people hear the name, BBC SSO,
they know that that's the one in demand for exciting projects with new work.
After all, if we're good at contemporary music, why not flaunt it?''

THE SFA and the Scottish Football Players' Union are to combine in a move to
help managers deal with stress.
Union secretary Tony Higgins said yesterday that he had already held talks with
Scotland manager Craig Brown about the move.
Already this season St Johnstone manager Paul Sturrock and Morton's Allan
McGraw have been rushed to hospital amid fears of a heart attack. Happily, in
both cases this proved wrong.
Higgins said: ``Previously, we ran a management course and part of that dealt
with stress and how to deal with problem situations. I have already had talks
with Craig Brown and    the intention is to hold, at the end of the season,
another course for managers and senior players who may be considering
management.
``It is important to give as much help as possible on the techniques of dealing
with stress. Stress is part of the baggage of the job nowadays.
``In years gone by managers such as Alex Smith and Walter Smith served a long
apprenticeship by being coaches or assistants at clubs. But with players
stepping straight from playing into management there is not the same
opportunity to gain experience.
``There is no management job in industry where the person appointed has not had
some sort of training, but it happens in football.''

A MAGAZINE we try never to miss is the Literary Review, especially the December
issue when they hand out their Annual Bad Sex Prize. This is awarded to the
book which contains the most irrelevant, redundant, perfunctory, embarrassing,
or unconvincing piece of writing describing the old rumpy-pumpy.
First, one of the losers, a section from Involved, a novel by one Kate
O'Riordan, describing a scene between a chap called Eamon and an Irish lady of
the night:
Her blouse lay at her feet, wet with sweat under the armpits. She kicked it
away. Eamon pulled his sweater over his head and stood in his vest and
trousers. He pulled his stomach in and watched her wrestle with the zip of the
tight red skirt.
She wriggled it down along her meaty thighs and kicked it to join the blouse.
She was wearing white suspenders and panties above black stockings over which
white soft flesh spilled generously. Layers of belly, winkled in the middle and
scarred below the navel, quivered beneath the white brassiere.
Enough, enough. We get the picture.
Possibly in second place we have this bit from Blackout, a novel by John
Lawton, set in wartime London:
Troy sat on the edge of the bed with his back to Tosca and unscrewed the top.
``Gorgeous,'' he said, inhaling from the jar. ``Pity we've nothing to eat with
it.''
``We have,'' she said, out of sight.
``Such as?''
``Such as . . . me!''
He turned. She had taken off her blouse and was unhooking her brassiere,
unleashing a bosom of such magnificence as to stagger the beholder. She grasped
the jar and upended it over her torso.
``OK, baby, I'm yours. Sauce me!''
And the winner is . . . Sorry, we've run out of space but we will tell you on
Friday. Sorry to keep you in suspenders, so to speak.
Get in the mood
THE Diary reluctantly acknowledges the advent of Christmas and, indeed, the
advent of advent. To get into the festive mood, we launch a series of
competitions. And what do competitions mean? Prizes.
The first test of the ingenuity of you dear readers is that you have to
nominate a fourth Wise Person who might have visited the stable at Bethlehem
and suggest what gift he or she might bring.
Would Duncan Ferguson, footballer and sometime guest of Her Majesty's prison
service, bring a garden gnome that he made in the workshop at Barlinnie?
Would Gerry Adams give the infant as a token of peace an Armalite rifle or a
daud of Semtex that was now surplus to IRA requirement? The Princess of Wales,
echoing Salome, offering her husband's family jewels (not the ones from the
tower) on a plate.
We are almost certain you get the drift. The prizes? Bottles of Langs Supreme
whisky and the Langs Hogmanay first-footing kit which consists of a stylish
package containing a miniature of whisky, a crystal glass, a bit of shortbread,
a lump of coal, and a pinch of salt.
Entries welcomed by letter, pigeon, fax, or phone, if you can get us in.
Lesson learned
A BOOK called Scotland the Worst (Canongate, #4.99) is already living up to its
name. This list of people and situations which are, literally, awfully Scottish
was serialised, appropriately, in the Sunday Times Scotland. The article was
located adjacent to an expensive advertisement from Dollar Academy, the top
people's school. Who are now refusing to pay because of their proximity in the
paper to a survey of the worst things Scottish.
Toeing the line
AN entirely apocryphal story, we hope, from a Glasgow school. Each wean is
asked to describe father's occupation (the school is obviously in one of those
areas where people have jobs).
``Ma faither's a jiner,'' says one. ``No, your father is a joiner,'' replies
the teacher. ``For tomorrow, I want you to learn to spell the word joiner and
also bring me something relating to your father's employment.''
The next pupil says that his father is ``a bookie''. He is told to learn to
spell bookmaker and bring something relating to his father's business. The
third child is a recent immigrant to Scotland and is struggling with the
language. He says that his father is a ``feet-fixer''. He is given the same
instructions as the previous pupils.
The next day, the first wean duly spells the word joiner and produces a hammer.
The second spells bookmaker and produces, as his evidence of his pater's
profession, a betting line with the words: ``Ten-to-one the wee foreign guy
can't spell chiropodist.''
The last word
WE hope that the Diary's chum Eddie Mair, who left stardom at BBC Scotland to
work on Radio 5 Live in London, has not been introduced to any substances of a
mind-blowing nature.
We ponder this only because Eddie has taken to closing his midday programme on
Radio 5 Undead with comments of a mystical and unexplained nature. So far these
have included:
q Not to be taken internally.
q Made only with pulp from sustainable forests.
q If you can read this, you're driving too close.
q If the red light shows, wait here . . .
Presumably, we can look forward to such statements as: ``My other radio channel
is Classic FM'' or ``I used to live in Dundee but I'm alright now.''
Any suggestions direct to Mr Mair at the BBC in London.
Only an excuse
HOGMANAY is a difficult enough time of year for the average person who might
have taken a dram or two before wending homeward.
The city of Edinburgh is intent on making it even more trying with some of the
events in their five-day Hogmanay festival.
Try, for example, explaining that you were on your way home, honest, but were
held up by an entire half-mile of street theatre.
On no account mention one of the turns in this plethora of street theatre. It
is called Ezili - The Mother of All Monsters.
It is a giant orange, inflatable plastic beastie on the same scale of the Loch
Ness monster which will be laying exploding eggs. Much more frightening than
little pink rats.
Also in attendance and possibly even more disconcerting will be both the
Edinburgh and Cardiff samba schools.

Douai, France
BANKRUPT former Marseille soccer boss Bernard Tapie today was sentenced to two
years in prison, of which 16 months were suspended, on match-rigging charges.
The appeal court in the northern French town of Douai also declared Tapie
ineligible for public office for three years.
Tapie's lawyer immediately announced that he would appeal to the Supreme Court,
a move that keeps him out of prison while the legal proceedings continue.
The one-time business tycoon, cabinet minister and aspiring politician who
remains a member of the French and European parliaments, had been sentenced by
a lower court last May to one year in jail with another year suspended for
bribing players of rival team - Valenciennes - to lose a 1993 league game to
Marseille and for interfering with witnesses.
The financially troubled tycoon, known for his brash personality and left-wing
views, admitted that while owner of Olympique Marseille he had met the trainer
of the Valenciennes team but denied trying to fix a 1993 match.
Jacques Mellick, the mayor of Bethune who helped construct an unsuccessful
alibi for Tapie, saw his two-year suspended sentence reduced to one year. The
court upheld his two-year ineligibility for office.
The court reduced to 18 months the two-year suspended sentence for Jean-Pierre
Bernes, Marseille's former director general. Bernes told an investigating judge
in June that the Marseille club under Tapie spent up to #750,000 a year buying
off opposing players and international referees.
The court upheld suspended sentences against Jean-Jacques Eydelie, who played
for Marseille, and Valenciennes players Christophe Robert and Jorge Burruchaga.
The defendants were accused of fixing a match on May 20, 1993, in which Tapie's
Olympique Marseille won 1-0 and went on to become European champions.
After the scandal broke, Marseille was stripped of its 1993 French championship
title and relegated to the second division last season, but was allowed to keep
the title of 1993 European club champions.-AP.

WESTERN Samoa coach Bryan Williams was a two-time Twickenham winner more than
20 years ago and is hoping that his squad can emulate him when they play London
today and return for the Test against England next month.
Williams landed a drop goal in the All Blacks' 9-0 defeat of England in 1973
and scored a second-half hat trick of tries when a World XV crushed England
during the RFU's 1971 Centenary celebrations.
``Being an All Black gave me the attitude that every rugby game was there to be
won.
``But on this tour with Western Samoa we have the twin objective of giving the
new players a taste of international rugby,'' said Williams.

<TEXT>
AGRICULTURE Minister Douglas Hogg yesterday confirmed plans for further
tightening of the rules designed to protect consumers from any risk of BSE,
writes ROBERT ROSS.
Under new measures the use of an animal's vertebral column in the manufacture
of mechanically recovered meat will be banned.
An advisory committee had expressed grave concern about findings by the State
Veterinary Service that there had been a number of instances where
slaughterhouses had left small pieces of spinal cord attached to carcasses
after dressing.
The cord is a specified bovine offal (SBO) which should be removed from
all carcasses of cattle over six months of age and destroyed.
The Government's chief medical officer, Dr Kenneth Calman, welcomed the new
restrictions and emphasised there was no scientific evidence that BSE could be
transmitted to humans or that eating beef caused Creutzfeld Jacob Disease.
Mr Hogg said that the new measures were a consequence of failings in handling
SBO in slaughterhouses. They did not reflect any concern about the mechanically
recovered meat process itself.
``I look to slaughterhouse operators now to deliver 100% compliance with the
SBO controls,'' he said.

Paris, Tuesday
RAIL transport was virtually paralysed in France for a fifth day today as
public service unions vowed to step up pressure until the government drops
plans to overhaul the social security system.
Thousands of rail workers, joined by doctors and students, marched in Paris to
protest Prime Minister Alain Juppe's plan to increase the number of years
workers must pay into the social security system before they can retire with
full benefits.
Students are demanding more funding and teachers to relieve crowded classrooms.
Marc Blondel, secretary general of the Worker's Force (FO) union, said
government workers could not accept the proposed changes, which would take away
control of the social security system from the unions and give it to Parliament.
But Juppe dug in his heels today, saying he would not withdraw his
controversial social security plan that seeks to cut next year's deficit of 60
billion francs (#7000m) by half and to eliminate it entirely in 1997.
In what may be the worst piece of news for the conservative government to date,
French unions are discussing the idea of a national strike that would bring out
two million people to the streets next month, the Paris daily Le Monde reported
today.
Juppe admitted in a newspaper interview on November 16 that his government
could not survive such a show of force.
French commuters lived through another difficult day today as trains, subways
and buses were nearly non-existent for the second time in less than a week.
Traffic jams up to 20 miles long were reported on highways leading into the
capital as commuters took to their cars to get to work. Rail, subway and bus
service in and around Paris was seriously crippled.
The strike was called by two of France's three major unions - Worker's Force
and the communist-led General Confederation of Workers (CGT).
A third union, the Democratic Confederation of French Workers (CFDT), which
supports some but not all of the government's proposals, did not participate in
today's strike.
Last night the government said it would exempt the 182,000 railway workers from
its plan to increase the amount of time public sector employees have to pay
into the state retirement fund by 2!s years.
But union leaders immediately rejected the olive branch.-AP.
Nicholas Powell writes: The national rail network and Paris's public transport
system are again expected to be at a virtual standstill tomorrow. According to
unions, 60,000 workers marched through the capital today. Impressed by their
own show of strength, unions promised they were only at the beginning of a
major campaign of industrial action against the highly unpopular right-wing
Government.
The demonstrations and stoppages are due to culminate a week before Christmas
with a massive protest in Paris. Today's strikes also included stoppages in
postal sorting centres.
The government measures entail the overhaul of the nation's chronically
overdrawn welfare system, increases in taxation over the next 12 years to
absorb the overdraft, changes to public sector retirement schemes, and a plan
to mop up the debts of the national railways.
To make matters worse for the government, French students have resurrected the
spectre of the May 1968 Sorbonne riots in recent weeks with protests against a
shortage of teachers, overcrowding, and underfunding in universities.
A major student demonstration, which should bring further chaos to the streets
of Paris, is planned tomorrow.

Weir joins SGN
in new venture
WEIR Group hopes to share in contracts worth billions of pounds to decommission
UK nuclear power stations through a new joint venture with a French nuclear
power company.
Strachan &amp; Henshaw of Bristol, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Glasgow
engineering group, announced yesterday it was joining up with state-owned SGN
of France to form European Nuclear Technologies (Entech).
The new company, which is based in Bristol, will compete for Government
contracts to dismantle and dispose of nuclear power plants throughout the UK.
Merger approval
LLOYDS Bank shareholders have approved the merger with the TSB by a majority of
100-1. Some 566.6 million votes were cast in favour, with 5.7 million against.
A meeting of TSB shareholders at the Scottish Conference and Exhibition Centre
in Glasgow today is also expected to rubberstamp the deal.
Cairn deal
EDINBURGH-based Cairn Energy has signed a deal to conduct its first exploration
in co-operation with a Chinese partner. Cairn and China National Offshore Oil
Corporation will drill in a 2945 square kilometre block in the Beibu Gulf off
southern China. The company did not disclose investment details, but it will
bear all the costs of the operation, including a 1996 seismic analysis which
could lead to drilling in the first quarter of 1997.
Tate changes
TATE &amp; Lyle has made several board changes, including the appointment of Larry
Pillard as chief operating officer and group managing director. Paul Lewis will
step down as finance director to be replaced by Simon Gifford, who will become
an executive director. Mr Lewis stays deputy chairman.
Disney record
THE Walt Disney Co posted record profits and revenues for the fourth quarter
and full year. Net income for the three months to end-September jumped 17% to
$264m from $225.9m, while revenue rose 16% to $3120m. For the full year, net
income leapt 24% to $1380m and revenue advanced 20% to $12.11bn.
Capital flight
EDINBURGH has been selected by Belgian airline Sabena as the first destination
to be served by its new Avro RJ85 jet. The 82-seater aircraft will be put into
service on its Edinburgh-Brussels route on Christmas Eve. The RJ85 will be
introduced on its Glasgow-Brussels route in March.

Presidency bid
by `Mad Vlad'
MOSCOW: Ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, long seen as the bad boy of
Russian politics, has defied critics who say his time is past by declaring he
will run for president.
Dubbed ``Mad Vlad'' by the Western media, Zhirinovsky's announcement seven
months before the vote appears designed to boost the flagging hopes of his
oddly-named Liberal-Democrat party in parliamentary elections on December 17.
Peace pledge
BARCELONA: European and Mediterranean countries pledged a new era of peace and
prosperity yesterday in an historic Barcelona Declaration adopted after
last-minute wrangles over the Middle East. An unprecedented conference of 27
countries ended nearly three hours late after ministers found a way around
Arab-Israeli issues including terrorism and nuclear weapons.
Afghanistan plea
UNITED NATIONS: Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali expressed grave concern
yesterday at the escalation of fighting in Afghanistan, where government forces
are battling rebel Taleban militia, and urged all parties to exercise restraint
and work for a ceasefire. Taleban, led by Islamic students, has taken control
of more than half of Afghanistan since its emergence last year.
Whitewater move
WASHINGTON: A US Senate panel resumed hearings yesterday into the Whitewater
affair, focusing on what the White House might have been told of government
investigations into two Arkansas firms. The Senate Whitewater Committee is
trying to find out if the White House tried to influence investigations into
the Madison Guaranty saving and loan institution and Capital Management
Services Inc.
Summit opens
CAIRO: Four Central African leaders met in Cairo yesterday with former US
President Jimmy Carter trying to mediate a solution to the havoc which conflict
between Hutus and Tutsis has brought to Rwanda, Burundi and their neighbours.
President Hosni Mubarak of the host country Egypt told the opening session that
peace was vital and he was confident the African presidents, from Burundi,
Rwanda, Uganda and Zaire, could lay the groundwork.
Promise kept
MADRID: Spain yesterday kept a promise made almost 60 years ago to the
International Brigades which fought alongside the Republicans against Franco's
fascist forces in the Civil War. Parliament unanimously approved a motion to
grant Spanish nationality to all surviving members of the 45,000-strong
volunteer force, many of them British.
Graf defended
BONN: Tennis star Steffi Graf's father yesterday insisted she was not involved
in a tax evasion scandal and urged German prosecutors to leave her alone, his
lawyer said. Peter Graf, 57, has been in jail since August on suspicion of
evading tax on millions of pounds she has earned during her high-powered career.

THE Scotch Whisky Association last night hailed Mr Kenneth Clarke as the first
Chancellor in 100 years to announce a cut in excise duty on whisky.
His decision to lop 27p off a bottle was widely welcomed by the industry, which
had mounted a powerful campaign to reverse the 4% rise in last year's
mini-Budget.
It will be seen as a particular boost in Scotland, where an estimated 45,000
people are employed, directly or indirectly, by distillers. The last price cut,
in 1895, was of a ha'penny in duty.
The Chancellor's move may also trigger a Christmas whisky war, with companies
vying to woo back drinkers who may have been deterred by soaring prices.
A spokesman for the Scotch Whisky Association said: ``The market is so
competitive at the moment that I think the pressure will be on for retailers to
cut prices. The whisky war is already on in some respects and it is bound to
intensify.''
Mr Hugh Morison, the association's director general, said: ``This cut is
extremely good news. The Chancellor has recognised the commercial damage
inflicted on the industry by successive Governments, which have consistently
discriminated against spirits.
``We hope that this is the first step of a long-term programme of cuts which
will bring the duty on spirits in line with the much lower duties applied to
other drinks.''
Mr Morison said the cut would also strengthen the Chancellor's negotiating
position in the discussions with European Union finance ministers over the
harmonisation of duties.
``By cutting the duty on spirits, the Chancellor has sent a clear signal. He
can tell his fellow ministers, as well as those in Japan and other world
markets, that tax discrimination against Scotch whisky and other spirits is
unacceptable.''
Whisky makers have been fighting a losing battle against the popularity of wine
for the past 15 years. Sales have dropped 30% since 1979, with the average
price of a bottle of Scotch rising #4.70 to #11 during that time. On average,
tax on a bottle of whisky is around 70% compared with 30% on wine.
Mr Clarke's decision was broadly welcomed by individual distillers. Mr Ken
Hitchcock, chairman and chief executive of the Whyte &amp; Mackay group, said: ``We
are delighted. Alongside the industry's recent commitment to TV advertising,
the tax cuts will manifest themselves as a direct benefit to everyone connected
with the industry.''
The managing director of Allied Distillers, Mr Andrew Dewar-Durie, said: ``This
cut deserves two cheers. The announcement shows that Mr Clarke has learned the
lesson that duty increases depress sales, reduce revenue, and cost jobs.
Ultimately, however, we hope to achieve our goal of an 8% cut in duty.''
Highland Distilleries chairman, Mr John Goodwin, said it was as much a
principle than the actual amount that mattered, as the Government was now
actually doing something.
The distiller of Famous Grouse is more exposed to the home market than almost
any other, with 1.2 million case sales compared with one million in export
markets. So it will benefit to a greater extent from any improvement in
domestic sales through the tax stimulus.
That was reflected in Highland shares jumping 20p to 367p, the biggest mover in
the sector.
At Macdonald Martin, the distiller which makes Glenmorangie, finance director
Jim Fyffe expressed concern that no commitment had been given on eventual rates
of duty nor the timescale. He said there remained a complete imbalance between
duty on spirits and that on beer.
While the distillers were happier, there were dismal faces at both the brewers
and the wine importers.
Carlsberg-Tetley pointed out that the British drinker pays seven times as much
duty as a French counterpart. The Chancellor had talked about the legitimate
concerns of the British drinks industry but had done little, said the company.
Tennent Caledonian said the freeze was extremely disappointing and was ``simply
not enough''.
The company added: ``Only the bootleggers will benefit because as long as the
massive gap between British and French beer tax levels remain unchanged, they
will continue to profit from the illegal resale of imported foreign beer.''
Wine and Spirits Association chairman, Mr David Grant, said he had mixed
feelings. He was happy about the move on spirits but quite depressed that there
would be ``another year of carnage'' in the wine trade.
The imbalance in duty between Britain and Europe is now such that 11!s% of wine
is imported quite legally by the consumer. This has meant that there has been a
tax deficit of #453m and a loss of busines to the trade of around #1200m.
Cider shares were hard hit after the decision to raise duty on very strong
ciders - those above 7.5% alcohol - with Matthew Clark, which recently took
over Taunton Cider, dropping 21p to 620p while industry leader HP Bulmer was 9p
down at 484p.

MILK producers attending today's DairyScot event at Ingliston in Edinburgh will
get some good news - and some bad.
According to Scottish Agricultural College experts, milk yields in the last
year have increased despite less expenditure on concentrate feeds, but valuable
milk protein levels have fallen.
Dairy farmers have been told that future milk pricing policy will lead to
reduction in milk fat without lowered protein content.
The latest SAC costings show that milk yields rose by 219 litres to 6008 litres
per cow in the last year. At the same time concentrate usage fell by 135kg a
cow, boosting profits over concentrate usage to a record 20.60p a litre.
This was helped by the availability of high quality silage for last winter and
good grazing conditions this summer. However, SAC's David Scrimgeour pointed
out that milk protein declined by 0.07% to average 3.32% while butterfat levels
rose by 0.04% to 3.98%.

A FARMER was arrested by police at the Smithfield FarmTec show in London
yesterday after an exhibitor claimed his animal had been injured.
A spokesman at Scotland Yard said that officers at Kensington Police Station
were investigating an allegation that a bullock had been hit in the foot by a
pitchfork.
``The incident occurred on Sunday between 9pm and 10pm,'' said the spokesman.
``The animal was seen by a vet and sedated. It had suffered a cut in its left
foot.'' A complaint was made to police on Monday and after investigation the
55-year-old farmer, from Peterhead, was arrested at the show.
The farmer, who has not been named, was released on bail and told to report to
Kensington Police Station on January 9.

A TIP-OFF from a chum and there I was in young Brendan McLaughlin's Clutha
Vaults Bar. Brendan is the landlord of the famed Scotia Bar across the road, a
Glasgow landmark for folk and blues and all sorts of cultural activities.
Indeed The Scotia is a venue for new Scottish writing and even does rather
splendid book prizes. But it was at Brendan's other venue, The Clutha, that
Richard Avedon came to photograph the new Scottish writers.
He booked it early and took hours, my dears, to take one snap: wur ain Harry
Turner, took two minutes to portray Mr Avedon, and Harry didn't have the nine
assistants and 80 cars or whatever which seemed to be a requirement for this
American snapper legend.
As it happens, Harry had taken a large number of photographs in advance for
Avedon just to let him see the lie of the land like. Avedon chose The Clutha,
and also the writers.
The American wizard is travelling around the UK, taking shots of lots of Brits.
``Writers and actors, politicians: I'm doing a lot throughout,'' he said.
``This shot is for our first assignment but a lot of the rest we'll do in wait
for later numbers of the New Yorker.''
Richard Avedon is the man who did the stills for Funny Face with Fred Astaire
and Audrey Hepburn. Later, he was Harper's Bazaar and Vogue.
He did the front cover for The Beatles' A Hard Day's Night album. Jean
Shrimpton posed for him.
For many years, Avedon was the most sought-after photographer in the world and
ad companies turned him into the sort of multi-millionaire which made senior
execs in every multinational company in the world wonder why they stayed on so
long at the Harvard Business School instead of learning how to point a Brownie
125.
Avedon proved to be a small, lean man with a shock of grey hair and not much
time for you, or anybody at all. He has been a star so long, it wouldn't matter
if he took a snap of his dog's turd, they would still run it on the front cover
of Life.
He does take a decent picture all the same and no denying. So would I with all
day and nine assistants, and a level of deference normally due to pontiffs.
But at least the reverence was given, and not asked.
There were a lot of writers about, assembled from all over just to get their
photie took by Avedon, including one of our most august novelists, Alasdair
Gray.
I didn't know who most of the others were actually and they wouldn't speak to
me at that apart from a rather nice fellow called Irving Welsh (he wrote that
trainspotting book), who told me how much he'd enjoyed an article of mine about
Liverpool when he was at Manchester Yooni and feeling homesick for Scotland.
I was touched. I wrote the piece, which I remember, 18 years ago.
And then Harry and me went back to work. Harry's picture's great. Made Richard
Avedon look dead like himself too.

<TEXT>
A CONTROVERSIAL video showing ``spy camera'' footage which includes a couple
having sex in a lift is to be withdrawn from sale.
Carlton TV threatened the makers of Caught In The Act! with an injunction when
it emerged that one of the sequences came from its programme Inside Crime.
The clip showed a suspect's car crashing through a shopfront in an unsuccessful
effort to evade police in New Bridge Street, Blackfriars, in the City of London.
However, film maker Barrie Goulding, who confirmed he was withdrawing the
video, said the reason for the withdrawal was political controversy and not
copyright dispute.
Police said they had authorised release of the car crash footage only to the
Inside Crime show and not to Mr Goulding.
Carlton claimed Mr Goulding had infringed their broadcast copyright and its
spokesman said: ``The company concerned will be withdrawing the video from
sale.''
MPs from all parties had demanded immediate Government action on controls on
closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage following the release of Caught In The
Act!
Mr Goulding blamed the political storm over the video for forcing him to
withdraw it yesterday and pointed out Carlton had not taken legal action
against him.
``As a responsible film maker, I have made the necessary research and have the
legitimate and proper paperwork supporting our copyright,'' he claimed.
``However, in the light of the pressure placed on me by politicians, I have
instructed the distributors of this video to cease distribution with immediate
effect.''
No further copies would be manufactured or made available, he pledged.
Mr Goulding said he would seek to re-release the video in the new year.
Amid the political storm, Labour MP Tam Dalyell claimed the video highlighted
the potential for blackmail in closed-circuit television systems.
Mr Roger Gale, Tory member of the media backbench committee, said he wanted all
commercial exploitation of clandestine camera footage to be outlawed.
Mr Goulding argued that Caught In The Act! performed a public service by
prompting debate about CCTV and invasion of privacy.
Ironically, the City of London Police clip which prompted Carlton's legal
threat is relatively uncontroversial.
The film's commentary suggests a hard-up security guard could have been tempted
to sell the voyeuristic footage.
``There is nothing to stop him selling it, us showing it or you watching it,''
the commentary says.
Equally, the private company which apparently shot the footage and owns the
copyright could have supplied it with little hindrance under current law.

<HEADLINE>Bid to challenge will was 10 years too late</HEADLINE>

A SON who waited 10 years to go to court after his mother cut him out of her
will was too late, a judge has ruled.
If Mr James McLure had challenged the will immediately after his mother's
death, his father would have demanded repayment of ``thousands'' of IOUs, Lord
Milligan was told.
Mrs Helene McLure, of Bowling Green Place, Crail, Fife, died in May 1983,
having changed her will the previous month.
She owned a house at Liddle Place in Crail, in which Mr McLure had been living
rent-free. She left him the house in an earlier will but, in 1983, decided to
leave everything to her husband, also James, who died in April this year.
Her son raised an action in 1993 claiming the will was void because of
irregularities in the way it had been witnessed. However, his sister, Mrs
Helene McLeod, of Pickford Crescent, Cellardyke, Fife, argued that the will was
valid and that her brother had raised the action too late.
In a written judgment issued at the Court of Session yesterday, Lord Milligan
said Mr McLure had consulted a solicitor within a week of his mother's death to
see if there were grounds for challenging the will. He was advised to leave
things for the time being to see what his father's attitude would be.
The judge said there was evidence that the mother had given and lent cash to
her son on many occasions.
Mr McLure said in evidence that he had suffered a serious accident in the Army
about 32 years ago when he was about 22, which resulted in epilepsy. After his
discharge, he had made various ventures into coastal fishing which had caused
substantial financial loss and his mother had helped him out.
Lord Milligan said: ``At the time of the mother's death and the making of her
will shortly before, it seems that Mr McLure's financial position was at best
precarious and there was some reason to suppose that any inheritance would
benefit his creditors rather than himself.
``In particular, there was a risk that the house at Liddle Place would be lost
to the family.''
Mr McLure alleged that in 1992, his father took steps to repossess the house at
Liddle Place and evict him. He raised the court action after it became clear a
reconciliation was impossible.
Lord Milligan said Mr McLure had granted IOUs in favour of his mother, now
unknown in number and value. They had been found after the mother's death and
eventually disposed of by the father.
In evidence given in hospital before his death, the father testified that he
tried to get his son to repay the IOUs but that he had refused to do so.
``The father also said that, had there been a challenge of the 1983 will by the
son, he would have taken him to court for repayment of the IOUs.''
Lord Milligan said: ``It is clear that Mr McLure not only had the opportunity
to take expert legal advice as to whether to challenge the will at the time of
his mother's death but that he did so.''
He said the advice not to pursue legal action but wait to see if his father let
him stay at Liddle Place was probably very sound, taking account of his
rent-free occupation and his debt problem.
He added: ``The fact that Mr McLure made a calculated decision not to challenge
the will, taking account of his hopes and expectations with regard to his
father's attitude in the future, would not avail him should his hopes and
expectations prove to be false.''
The judge also rejected Mr McLure's argument that the 1983 will had not been
validly signed and witnessed.

A DRUGS dealer who enjoyed a life of luxury while claiming State benefits has
been ordered to hand over profits of nearly #40,000 from his illegal trade.
George Rodden, 32, was jailed for 10 years last month after the biggest drugs
seizure yet in Fife - #40,000 worth of LSD, ecstasy, Temazepam, and diazepam.
His common-law wife, Christina Fisher, 30, who acted as the banker in the drugs
operation, was jailed for five years.
Lord Abernethy was told that Rodden and his wife had lived a luxury lifestyle,
enjoying foreign holidays although both were ``unemployed''.
Police found a cache of drugs during a raid at their home in Dunolly Gardens,
Windygates, in Fife.
Fisher was found to have a ``tick list'' of drugs debts totalling #27,000.
Rodden originally intended to contest yesterday's application by the Crown at
the High Court in Edinburgh for confiscation of the profits of his drugs
operation.
However, his counsel, Mr Jamie Gilchrist, told the court that he had been
instructed to withdraw the defences to the action.
Mr Gerard Moynihan, Advocate-depute, said the Crown was seeking confiscation of
#37,975 of assets which were the personal property of Rodden.
It also wanted him to hand over a further #1000 which had been a gift to his
wife.
Lord Abernethy made an order for Rodden, a father of five, to hand over a
#38,975 within the next six months.

A SINGLE mother - forced to leave her job as a London Underground train driver
to look after her baby son because of a new shift system - won her claim for
sex discrimination yesterday. The level of compensation will be set at a later
date.
Ms Susan Edwards, who was one of only 21 female drivers on London Underground,
continued working for five years on day shifts after the birth of her child
until a new rostering system was introduced in 1992. This meant she would have
had to work early and late shifts and so would not be able to look after her
child.
Ms Edwards took voluntary severance but later decided to take London
Underground to an industrial tribunal, claiming loss of earnings and injury to
her feelings.
She was supported by the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC), which yesterday
welcomed her victory as a warning to employers to consider the impact of
changes to working practices on workers with families.
London Underground argued it introduced the new shift system to reduce costs
and increase efficiency but the tribunal found that the company could
``easily'' have accommodated Ms Edwards. The company is still considering the
tribunal's decision.
In a separate case, a black woman working for the Arts Council of England won
one of the highest ``injury to feelings'' awards - #8000 - at an industrial
tribunal after losing out on a promoted job to a less qualified white woman.
Ms Alex Ankrah applied for the post of combined arts officer at the Arts
Council of England, as an alternative to redundancy, along with two other black
women and one white woman who turned out to be the successful applicant even
though she did not meet the personnel specification and was working at a lower
grade.
The industrial tribunal upheld Ms Ankrah's claims of race and sex
discrimination, the latter because of her treatment while on maternity leave
and awarded her #8000.
Commenting yesterday, Ms Ankrah said hers was an important victory for black
people working in the arts and cultural field who had experienced
discrimination at work, particularly during restructuring.

<HEADLINE>Contract workers were exposed to high levels of contamination at nuclear waste pits Dounreay may face prosecution</HEADLINE>

SENIOR management at Dounreay may face prosecution after the contamination of
two workers employed by a private company on the first nuclear waste-handling
contract put out to compulsory competitive tendering at the Caithness plant.
Meanwhile, Dounreay yesterday finally published the report of investigations
into an explosion in its controversial intermediate level waste shaft, more
than 18 years after it happened. However, it could be a further 25 years before
it begins to retrieve the nuclear waste in it.
The two men, whose safety could be the subject of a report to the
procurator-fiscal, are reported to have been exposed over the summer to 10mSv,
10 times the level of radioactive contamination that would normally be expected
for a Dounreay worker.
This was made clear by HM Nuclear Installations Inspectorate's principal site
inspector, Mr Malcolm Macphail, at yesterday's meeting of Dounreay Local
Liaison Committee. The NII is responsible for licensing Dounreay's operation.
The two men, a fork-lift driver and another worker, had been working for a firm
called Probabilistic Risk Assessment Ltd, which had been sub-contracted by AEA
Technology, a commercial division of the UK Atomic Energy Authority now being
privatised. They were involved in compacting the drums of low-level waste which
had originally been left rusting in Dounreay's controversial low-level waste
pits until after 1993 when public anger was followed by remedial action.
The work was stopped early in the summer when the contamination was first
discovered, and then restarted, only to be stopped on September 25. It has not
been restarted since.
Yesterday's meeting at Dounreay was first alerted to the problem by Dounreay's
head of safety, Mr Ken Butler, when he reported that there had been ``some
problems with the level of dust, there had been small quantities of
radioactivity breathed by operators . . . . in September we stopped the work
again because there was still evidence of internal contamination and after
investigation it appeared that the workers could have breathed in dosages
towards the upper end of limits''.
Mr Butler did not blame the use of outside contractors but rather an internal
failure to evaluate properly the information and to tell the proper people.
Mr Macphail, meanwhile, reported: ``Two contractors received significant
radioactive doses. Less than the legal limits but still significant. We regard
the incident as very serious. We have been taking formal statements and the
matter will be taken further.''
Afterwards, Mr Macphail said that the level of dose represented one fifth of
the annual legal dose. He said the failure of Dounreay's systems to prevent
this could well constitute a breach of Dounreay's 35 licensing conditions:
``Prosecution is a possibility.''
Mr Macphail had also revealed that the NII had issued the plant with two
improvement notices, which meant that the different areas of radioactive
contamination around the site had to be cleared up by October 1996, apart from
the area around the the controversial waste shaft. The operators had until
January 1997 to clean up there.
Meanwhile, following the publication of the report into the 1977 explosion in
the shaft, Dounreay director John Baxter said the aim was now to remove the
waste from the shaft in an operation that could cost #200m.
``Rather than leave the stuff there, we are seeking to retrieve it, but that
will not be easy and we think it will be the year 2005 at least before we start
taking the waste out, and there are some advantages in leaving it to 2020.''
The report itself records how an explosion was heard about 20 past midnight on
May 10, 1977, in the shaft where nuclear waste, including uranium and
plutonium, had been stored along with other items such as electric motors and
vacuum cleaners, since 1959. The explosion was heard along the coast at the HMS
Vulcan naval establishment but early investigations at Dounreay had failed to
locate anything unusual.
At 1.25am, a general worker reported he had heard an alarm bell ringing. At
1.55am, the site police were informed and road blocks erected to prevent anyone
entering the area of the shaft. One early theory was that it might have been a
bomb but that was discounted.
Mr Baxter pointed to a comparison which showed that levels of radioactivity
around the shaft after the explosion had been less than they had been in 1964
and 1965 and concluded:
``From the perspective of the mid-1990s, neither the use of the shaft as a
disposal site nor the levels of contamination and radiation at the head of the
shaft in the 1960s are acceptable. However, it is important to judge our
predecessors against the standards in force at the time, not the standards we
expect today.''

A LEADING Glasgow doctor last night launched a strong attack on the case for
voluntary euthanasia.
Dr George Chalmers, emeritus consultant geriatrician at Glasgow Royal
Infirmary, said such a move was unnecessary and would be dangerous to society
as a whole.
Dr Chalmers, an elder at Sandyford Henderson Memorial Church in Glasgow, said
he had long-term worries about the effects of any move to make euthanasia
legal, particularly on the most vulnerable members of society.
He cited as an example pensioners in a Dutch nursing home who apparently felt
pressure along the lines of a ``duty to die'' for the sake of those who were
paying the bills.
``Introduce the option to kill and we are in real danger of turning the
exception into the rule, euthanasia being more and more frequent, given even
easier justification,'' said Dr Chalmers.
His comments came during a debate examining euthanasia in the context of
morals, ethics, and law partly organised by the Church of Scotland Board of
Social Responsibility held in Edinburgh last night.
In his speech, Dr Chalmers, who helped prepare a paper on the subject of
euthanasia to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland last year, said:
``Humanism, the philosophy from which much of the pressure towards euthanasia
derives, is Godless by definition and profoundly self-centred. It is
utilitarian, respecting only what is of demonstrable value in material and
human terms.
``If we adopt this way of thinking, we will begin to evaluate our fellow human
beings merely in terms of their contribution to society and we shall bring
pressures upon the most vulnerable members of that society which they are the
least able to resist.
``To legalise euthanasia would be to take a major step towards adopting a
utilitarian philosophy of life for our society and would make a major
concession to the barbarism which would arise from it.''
Dr Chalmers said he believed support for euthanasia and its promotion was
founded so often upon the fear of suffering rather than the fear of death
itself.
``We need to be aware that our actions change us, they make us what we become.
If I lie, I become a liar. If I steal, I become a thief. What do I become, as a
doctor, if I kill?''
q Another meeting on the issue of euthanasia is being held in Renfield St
Stephen's Church, Bath Street, Glasgow, tonight at 7.30.
As well as Dr Chalmers, Mr John Welsh, professor of palliative care at Glasgow
University will be involved in the debate.

TORY MP David Ashby yesterday denied taking the most terrible gamble and
``putting his head in a noose'' by sharing a double bed on a French holiday
with a male doctor.
Cross-examined by Mr Richard Hartley QC, for the Sunday Times, which Mr Ashby
is suing for libel over an allegation that he was homosexual, the 55-year-old
MP for North West Leicestershire said he thought nothing of the incident at the
Chateau Tilques, St Omer, in January last year.
He was not handing evidence ``on a plate'' to his  estranged wife, Silvana, his
sister, Lynne, and the Sunday Times - who all believed he was having an affair
with Dr Ciaran Kilduff - because there was no evidence, he told Mr Justice
Morland and a jury at the High Court in London.
``For the 28 years of my marriage, my wife had done everything possible to stop
me having friends. She destroyed friendships when I got married, which I
discovered afterwards, with dreadful letters to people. She stopped me from
seeing my family and I didn't see why she should dictate how I lived and who I
saw after I left.''
Mr Ashby, of The Downs, west Wimbledon, and Ravenstone, Leicestershire, is
claiming damages over a January 1994 story that he shared a double bed with a
man friend during a holiday in Goa at the end of 1993.
Times Newspapers Ltd and former Sunday Times editor Andrew Neil deny libel,
although they accept that Mr Ashby did not holiday with a man in Goa. They
assert he was and is having an affair with 32-year-old Dr Kilduff.
Mr Ashby said that when his wife told a Government Whip that he had left her
for a man, the Whip roared with laughter. ``He knows me very well indeed and he
thought it was a very funny thing.''
He said someone would have to have a dirty mind to think he was having an
affair with Dr Kilduff, who sat in court only yards away from Italian-born Mrs
Ashby, 52.
Mr Hartley pressed: ``Knowing of your wife's allegations, don't you think you
were taking the most terrible gamble, in effect putting your head in a noose,
by sharing a double bed with Dr Kilduff?''
Mr Ashby: ``I knew I wasn't going to be dictated to by my wife and I was going
to do what I wanted to do in going away that weekend.''
Mr Ashby said he took some responsibility for his marriage breakdown in the
autumn of 1993 but the problem was that his wife had never had any real insight
into what was going wrong.
Mr Ashby broke down, and there was a brief adjournment, when Mr Hartley asked
again why he did not tell his wife he was going to France with Dr Kilduff.
Struggling for composure, he said: ``I had no reason to. I felt very hurt and
bruised and didn't think I could take much more, and I couldn't. I desperately
hoped that my marriage would . . . I hoped that by leaving her and doing all
these things maybe . . . maybe things, pray to God, they would change but they
didn't.''
The hearing continues.

REALISM - accepting your short-comings, then confronting your fears and
inadequacies - is essential to the make-up of the champion athlete.
Sally Gunnell helped a group of 34 of Scotland's best young female athletes to
understand that truth yesterday as part of a TSB coaching initiative, Gunning
for Gold.
In a day-long course at Meadowbank, she gave the kind of advice and unique
insight which only a world, Olympic, European, and Commonwealth champion can
provide.
Yet, even goddesses are mortal, and can have doubts. If Gunnell succeeds in
making a successful defence of her Olympic 400 metres hurdles title in Atlanta
next year, then she will owe much to her husband, Jon Bigg.
Publicly, it was a minor operation which Gunnell required in August to cure the
foot problem which sidelined her all season and prevented her from defending
her world title in Gothenburg.
But the serious nature of the surgery, and the depths of Gunnell's subsequent
private doubts and fears, emerged as Bigg confessed how he had helped his wife
to train when she was still on crutches, and the pain was so intense that she
could not stand on her own feet.
``We had tried everything, but whenever I hurdled, I broke down,'' Gunnell
said. ``I didn't want to have an operation, but it was no use. A bone had grown
into a point, digging into the bursa of my Achilles tendon.''
A Swiss surgeon filed the bone, removed the bursa, and cleaned it out. He had
promised beforehand that Gunnell should be ready to restart training within a
fortnight, but the damage he found was much worse than had been anticipated.
``The operation was far bigger than we originally envisaged,'' said Bigg. ``In
some ways that was a relief. Finding there was a major problem explained why
Sally had had such a miserable summer.''
But the rehabilitation was almost more than the impatient Gunnell could
tolerate. ``I was a nearly a month on crutches, then a month trying to walk,
let alone run,'' she said.
``The pain I went through was far worse than the injury. I was two weeks just
learning to walk again, then another two before I could jog on the flat of my
feet. It was a further two weeks until I could get on my toes.
``Was I hard to live with? Just ask Jon,'' she added.
``The slow progress was completely disheartening to Sally,'' revealed her
husband, a former international 800m runner. ``Remember, she had never had a
serious injury before.''
Harder, than that, was when, out of the blue, she was locked on to the business
end of a microphone as her world record fell in Gothenburg.
The injured Gunnell had been signed up by BBC, and was in the stand,
commentating.
She did not realise for some moments that her world record had gone, and that
both the winner, Kim Batten, and runner-up Tonja Bufford, just one-hundredth
behind, had broken her time.
``The heats and semis had been nothing special, then, out of the blue, this
happened in what was expected to be a mediocre race.
``All I could think of was what might have been had I been in the race.''
Could things get worse?
Yes. She was ordered to go down and interview Batten.
To her credit, any pardonable uncharitable emotions were kept in check.
Gunnell's enthusiasm for her event, and for a great performance, were what
bubbled through as she spoke to the American.
``I was lucky the right side of me came out,'' said Gunnell.
Coach Bruce Longdon confirmed that, outwardly, Gunnell had never appeared to
let the loss of her world record affect her.
``If anything, it has helped motivate her even more,'' he said. ``If having won
everything in the sport could have been calculated to make you complacent, then
this was all Sally needed.
``But there is no point in minimising what she has been through. You only have
two feet, and if you are a runner, and if you have a great lump of bone carved
out of one of these feet, then that's a major operation.''
Gunnell remains convinced she can come back.
``What this has taught me is that I cannot go out and have it all my own way,
and win as easily as I did before.
``One of my goals now is to regain the record, and set the kind of time which
will stand for 10 or 15 years. That is my dream.''
The pain I went through after my operation was worse than the injury. I was two
weeks just learning to walk again, then another two before I could jog on the
flat of my feet.     It was a further two weeks until I could get on my toes.

<HEADLINE>Conran and Mosimann to open restaurants.   New highs for haute cuisine in Glasgow</HEADLINE>

TWO high-profile figures whose names have become synonymous with excellent
cuisine are set to open restaurants in Glasgow.
Sir Terence Conran, called the ``emperor of eating out'' for his range of
innovative restaurants in London, is expected to finalise the details soon of
his plans for a brasserie/bar in the new 163-bedroom luxury Hotel
Inter-Continental Glasgow at the former Glasgow Sheriff Court building.
The Herald also understands that the noted chef and broadcaster Anton Mosimann
will soon confirm plans to open a 100-seat restaurant and bar in the hotel.
It will be the first venture outside of London in the restaurant business for
the two men. Sir Terence has seven restaurant-bars while Mr Mosimann owns an
executive dining club.
News that the two exponents of gourmet eating are set to become established in
Glasgow was welcomed yesterday by renowned city hotelier Ken McCulloch.
He said: ``It is great news that Glasgow is able to attract people of this
stature. The more quality we have in the city the better. Their presence will
only make a visit to Glasgow even more memorable.''
It is expected the new restaurants will open in October, 1997, although the
#15m hotel development is not scheduled to open to the public until Christmas
1997.
The Hotel Inter-Continental Glasgow will be one of 141 hotels in 55 countries
operated by the Saison Group of Japan. The group also has interests in the
five-star George Hotel in Edinburgh and the St Andrews Old Course Hotel.
It is perhaps not surprising that Glasgow is the location for Conran's first
major restaurant outside of London, given that Glasgow was the
first-out-of-London location in the seventies for his Habitat stores group.
Sir Terence, who established a high reputation for innovative retailing, is
planning to open a Conran Shop selling highly-individual designer furniture and
household articles within the hotel.
The Glasgow shop will add to his specialist shops in London, Paris, Tokyo, and
one which will open soon in Milan.
Mr Des Gunewardena, chief executive of Conran Holdings, said yesterday: ``We
have chosen to concentrate the restaurants in London in the past because we
believe they needed close management.
``We only considered opening a restaurant in Glasgow because we are opening a
shop there. It is not because we think it is the second-best city in the UK for
restaurants after London.''
The two new restaurants will be sited at either end of the new hotel and will
complement the hotel's own 140-seat restaurant although they will be run as
completely separate business operations.
Conran's range of theme restaurants in London includes Quaglino's, one of
Britain's new period piece restaurants, which has been described by Egon Ronay
as a place of such brilliance in design as well as food for mass pockets that
it is ``epoch-making''.
The stable also includes Mezzo in Soho, Bibendum in South Kensington, the Blue
Print Cafe in the Design Museum at Butler's Wharf, and the nearby Le Pont de la
Tour with its cinematic views of Tower Bridge.
Mr Mosimann's restaurant in Glasgow is likely to be pitched at a slightly
higher level of clientele than Sir Terence's 100-seater, which is expected to
provide ``simple, classy cuisine in simple, classy surroundings'' and be based
on the Le Pont de la Tour.
Mr Mosimann, who developed his culinary skills while working in his family's
restaurant in Switzerland, became the youngest chef to win the prestigious Head
Chef Diploma Award. He was only 28 when he was offered the notable position of
chef de cuisine at London's Dorchester Hotel.
His skills and energy earned the hotel two Michelin stars before he left in
1988 to establish Mosimann's, an executive dining club in London's Belgravia.
The Herald understands that he will confirm his interest in the former Sheriff
Court development early in the new year. He could not be contacted for comment
yesterday.
Mr Patrick Davies, managing director of Sheriffhouse Limited, the Scottish
company created to develop the building, said yesterday: ``For many years, we
have recognised Sir Terence's abilities in retailing and lately in the creation
of landmark restaurants as being without peer on the English scene.
``We are very happy to welcome Sir Terence to join Inter-Continental in the
development of what we believe is the most prestigious building in Glasgow.''

ITALIAN universities last night began sacking foreign lecturers as part of a
campaign to give their jobs to local people in defiance of European law.
Professor David Petrie, a languages lecturer from Dumbarton, who works at the
University of Verona, has not yet been sacked but has been demoted and
reclassified as a non-teacher.
Professor Petrie is leader of the Committee for the Defence of Foreign
Lecturers, whose 32 members include a German at the University of Rome. She was
sacked recently but won an injunction allowing her to keep her job meantime.
In Verona yesterday, two employees, a Frenchman and a German, were evicted from
their offices and teaching posts (which they had held for more than 12 years)
and moved to non-teaching jobs. Italians are being hired in their place. The
foreign teachers have been defended by the European Parliament and their plight
has been condemned by the European Commission. The European Court of Justice
has twice found in their favour - but the Italians have simply continued to
ignore the judges.
Professor Petrie has in the past been evicted from his office, demoted, and had
his salary cut. He won compensation and his old job back after taking his case
to the Italian courts.
Last night he said: ``So far they have not sacked me. But I expect to be
reclassified as a non-teacher and after that, who knows? I was recently told
that I could expect to be punished for putting up newspaper cuttings including
some from The Herald and the Times Literary Supplement highlighting our case at
a student meeting.''
The lecturers' case has been taken up by Labour Euro-MP Hugh McMahon, whose
Strathclyde West constituency includes Professor Petrie's home.

A KEBAB shopkeeper who tricked his mistress and a policeman into backing a
#150,000 National Lottery swindle was convicted of attempted fraud yesterday.
Ali Hirli, 41, now faces up to seven years in jail. He had hoped to fool
lottery organisers Camelot with parts of two tickets stuck together with sticky
tape last December - within weeks of the lottery's launch.
The court was told Hirli had induced girlfriend Fatima Quasein, who worked for
him as a part-time cleaner, to run up to a policeman in the street pretending
her baby had chewed up a second prize ticket.
Police Constable Vincent Morley told Southwark Crown Court: ``A lady approached
me in a distressed state with this torn ticket. In very poor and broken English
she said: `Winning ticket - please help.'
``She said something about her baby had eaten it.''
He took Ms Quasein and Hirli back to the station to try and sort out the
problem.
``I was just trying to give them some assistance,'' he said.
``The ticket was in five or six pieces. I tried to stick them as best I could.''
Mr Morley then telephoned Camelot to tell them about the ticket.
Two Camelot representatives carried out security checks which showed Hirli had
joined together two tickets, both from a shop in Plaistow, east London, one
purchased on the day of the draw and the other the day after.
One half carried the winning numbers and the other part displayed the correct
date.
Mr Michael Holland prosecuting said: ``This was a crude attempt to obtain money
but nonetheless a serious and determined attempt.''
Had the fraud succeeded, Hirli would have received #149,596, for five winning
numbers plus the bonus ball.
Moroccan born Ms Quasein, of Outram Street, East Ham, east London, was cleared
of attempted fraud after explaining that although she had lied for her
boyfriend, she had not suspected the ticket was anything but genuine.
Hirli, of Brereton Road, Tottenham, north London, who claimed it was her idea,
will be sentenced on January 8.
Meanwhile, a family syndicate have collected a cheque for more than #3.3m.
Prison officer John Lane, 29, his father Brian, 52, and father-in-law Alex
Gunn, 52, plan to share the #3,338,805 with their wives and children.
Mr Lane, who kept the winning ticket in his Bible before notifying Camelot on
Monday, lives in Broadstairs, Kent, with his wife Amanda and three children,
Adam, seven, Holly, four, and Ellie, 13 months. He works at top security
Belmarsh prison in south-east London.
The Lanes plan family trips to Disneyland and a special birthday celebration
for son Adam who is eight next week.
Their syndicate has used the same nine lines of randomly chosen numbers since
the lottery began a year ago. Until now they have won just #30.

PLANS to spend #154,000 on a giant talking horn beside the M8 motorway came
under fire yesterday.
The floodlit 78ft-high steel horn is to be built at Polkemmet Country Park,
near Whitburn. It will blast out taped messages extolling the virtues of West
Lothian.
West Lothian District Council has been awarded #80,250 from the National
Lottery to help pay for the horn.
Mr Charles Eardley, chairman of Whitburn Community Council, said: ``It will be
nothing but an eyesore. A sheer waste of public money.''
The cost of the structure has risen from an original #50,000.
It has been moved from its planned site because the AA feared it could distract
motorists. Council convener Jimmy McGinley defended the horn as a work of art.
He said it was one of a number of sculptures planned to brighten up the M8.

BRITISH Waterways will resubmit its #30m bid for millennium lottery funding
today along with a 30,000-name petition gathered by supporters of a project
designed to create a navigable canal across Central Scotland.
An application earlier this year for funding in support of its #95m Millennium
Link project - which also plans to build a giant wheel based on the technology
of the ancient Greeks at Falkirk to link the Forth and Clyde Canal with the
Union Canal - was not given priority by the Millennium Commission.
The application was one of several projects which lost out on millennium
funding awards earlier this year. They were given B-listed status and invited
to submit more detailed second bids.
Mr Jim Stirling, British Waterways' manager in Scotland, said yesterday that
the board's bid had now been ``refocussed'', with the timescale of the project,
altered although the core project remained intact.
He remained hopeful of securing the commission's support for the project which
had received widespread support from MPs, community groups, and SusTrans, which
was awarded #42.5m of lottery funding earlier this year to create countrywide
cycle links. A decision on the application is expected early next year.
The Millennium Link proposes reopening 70 miles of canal between Bowling and
Grangemouth, creating a unique coast-to-coast Scottish waterway and a corridor
for recreation, environmental improvement, and jobs.
Under the proposal, dependent on receiving multi-million pound funding from the
Millennium Fund, a 75ft-high wheel would be built at the Falkirk Canal
Interchange at Roughcastle, to the west of Falkirk, to transfer boats from one
canal to the other.
Mr Guthrie Hutton, of the Forth and Clyde Canal Society, who helped organise
the petition, said yesterday: ``It was a tragedy when the canal closed. It
would be an even bigger tragedy if the Millennium Commission failed to support
its reopening.''
His comments were supported by Mr Tony Worthington, Labour MP for Clydebank,
who said the project would create much-needed jobs. ``Everyone I have met has
been in favour of it,'' he added.
An independent survey by Coopers and Lybrand forecast that the Millennium Link
would provide between 4200 and 4600 permanent jobs, as well as 1500
construction jobs a year while the canal and its surroundings are revitalised.
The report also predicted an increase of #40m per year in extra spending in
central Scotland.
Mr George Ballinger, British Waterways' principal engineer, urged the
Millennium Commission to recognise the importance of the bid to Scotland's
population.
``We think this is really a people's bid,'' he said, citing the fact that the
canal is within a one-hour drive of seven out of 10 Scots.
Scottish Natural Heritage yesterday also launched a more detailed second bid
for #8m of millennium funding to help create better access to the countryside
by developing a network of paths around towns, cities, and villages. The second
application expands on how the Paths For All project will be taken forward by
securing access and involving local communities in the initiative.
Meanwhile, it has emerged that islanders on Bute are considering a plan to mark
the millennium by reintroducing trams which were withdrawn from service in 1938.
The last tram ran between Rothesay and Ettrick Bay on the west side of the
island on rails which ran from the centre of Rothesay to Ardbeg and Port
Bannatyne before heading inland for two miles across to Ettrick Bay.
Rothesay Rotary Club, which is co-ordinating Bute's campaign for millennium
funds, says trolley-buses, which have been introduced in transport systems on
the Continent, could be an alternative to rail-borne trams.
Club officials are considering the possibility of running the trams or
trolley-buses from the village of Kerrycroy, south of Rothesay, linking two of
the most scenic coastal stretches on Bute.
The construction of a road bridge linking the north of the island at Rhubodach
to Colintraive on the Cowal mainland is among other options also being
considered for millennium funding.

SEB Sanders can continue his successful run today courtesy of Miroswaki in the
two-mile Royal St Georges Handicap at Lingfield.
The youngster, who lost his right to claim in the summer, has already clinched
the apprentices' championship.
He is keeping busy by riding on the all-weather through the winter.
And he showed on Monday that he is a rider worth booking even without his
allowance when he completed a treble for three different stables.
He teams up this time with his retaining trainer, Reg Akehurst, who has already
supplied him with ammunition such as Wokingham winner Astrac this year.
Miroswaki is no potential Royal Ascot winner but he has very strong claims
today.
The gelding has proven his effectiveness both at this trip and on Lingfield's
equitrack surface.
He is now very well treated at the weights having failed to find his form this
year and is just the type whose enthusiasm is likely to have been rekindled by
a switch to Akehurst.
The Epsom trainer has time and again landed gambles with runners making their
debut for his yard and Miroswaki looks set to do the same in a race which will
take little winning.

There have been two sightings of Natasha Jones, nine, and Louise Dixon, 10,
both from the Saffron Lane council estate in Leicester, who went missing on
Sunday. Police believe the girls may be sleeping rough on the estate.
In Hampshire, a spotter plane was being used yesterday in the hunt for Mrs
Janet Cooper, 58, who went missing after her dog was killed in a traffic
accident. Tracker dogs were also combing the countryside surrounding Mrs
Cooper's home in Titchfield, near Fareham.

ARMED raiders have stolen a group of pensioners' Christmas savings from an
Edinburgh nursing home.
Two men armed with a knife and wrench forced a male charge nurse to open a safe
containing about #1000.
The thieves appeared to be after drugs but changed their minds when they saw
the safe.
The managing director of the Edinburgh Nursing Home in Duddingston Road, which
has 40 occupants, spoke of the residents' anger.
``They are not thinking about the money at present although that may come, but
are very upset about the invasion of their privacy and the fact their homes
have been broken into,'' said 40-year-old Mrs Liz Miller.
She praised the staff and said: ``They are coping in their own ways. We are
trying to keep things as normal as possible for everyone.''
Around 3.30am yesterday, the raiders, one wearing a crash helmet, the other
sunglasses, confronted three women and one male staff member in the home's
conservatory.
After asking where drugs were kept, the knife-wielding raider forced the male
charge nurse to take him to the cashier's office while the second man guarded
the others.
None of the staff was injured and no resident was aware of the robbery. One
raider is described as aged 25, 5ft 8in and slim. He wore a blue crash helmet,
tartan scarf, and blue checked shirt.
The second is in his mid-20s, stocky, and wore a grey shirt and dark trousers.
A police spokesman said: ``This robbery was well planned. The home is situated
in a quiet area and we would like to hear from anyone such as taxi drivers who
may have passed by during the early hours of the morning.''

GLASGOW has lost out on hosting a significant international conference worth
about #1m to the city because the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre
``did not try hard enough'', the co-organiser of Scotland's successful bid
claimed yesterday.
The 1998 conference on contaminated soil, which is expected to draw more than
1000 delegates from Europe and the US, will be held at Edinburgh International
Conference Centre after Scotland beat off competition from Austria, France, and
England to be hosts.
Edinburgh was chosen as Scottish representative in September, after the city
was invited to compete with Glasgow for the event in June.
Strathclyde University environmental management professor George Fleming, who
fronted Scotland's bid alongside Scottish Enterprise, said Glasgow was rejected
because its venue, the redeveloped SECC, had been ``bureaucratic'' and
unwilling when asked to provide plans, dates, and prices for the conference.
He said: ``Scotland has won a highly prestigious conference, representing a
multi-million-pound industry. That is great and nothing should detract from it.
``However, I am just disappointed that Glasgow could not have smiled better.
Both the Edinburgh and Glasgow convention bureaux responded beautifully but all
we were told by the SECC was that their new conference facilities would be
available from 1997 and could accommodate our numbers.''
Professor Fleming claimed he received no further response before the September
deadline when he pressed for more detail, even though artists' impressions of
the Sir Norman Foster-designed facility were available from July.
``We had to decide to leave Glasgow aside, because of the lack of effort in
providing information. I am a Glaswegian, and that hurts.''
However, the SECC's marketing director, Mr Robert Enyon, rejected the
professor's claims, saying that prices, dates, and rough floor plans had been
made available for the bid.
He said: ``Professor Fleming came to us two months into our new facilities
project at too early a stage to provide exact floor details. There would have
been no point in offering something we weren't definitely going to produce.
``We are simply pleased that Scotland has won this major conference.''

by Miller Homes to mark the release of a new phase of one- and two-bed flats.
The interior has been designed by Brian Swinton, who says it has a strong
European influence ``with lots of bold colours and ethnic styling which will
appeal to the younger buyer''. The new flats will be ready by Christmas, with
prices starting at #53,000.

WASN'T it Sir Terence Conran who, judging the City of Architecture '99
applications, looked at a rejuvenated Castlemilk and said he would be perfectly
happy to live there? Let the picture tell the story. See what's happened to the
changing townscape of Grange Square, for example, or over at Tormusk Road.
Aspects of council housing are showing great style.
With Glasgow's population below 700,000 and people moving into the suburbs,
what's needed is the kind of working partnership Castlemilk has found. The
existing stock of houses is improved, the local environment upgraded, and every
effort made to have housing that is affordable so that people decide to stay
and, hopefully, work in the area.
The approach is to take a block of flats, reduce the overall height, provide a
new look, include individual front doors for tenants, add in gardens and a more
secure environment.
The bottom line is new flats, with off-street parking, double glazing, central
heating, new kitchens and bathrooms (but unfurnished). And local people are
positively encouraged to particpate in design aspects. Rents range from around
#103 a month for a two-apartment flat to #183 for a five-apartment. Expenditure
ranges from #38,000 to #45,000 a flat in the Grange Square and Tormusk Road
schemes - down to #15,000 per flat in other schemes.
Local authorities are seeking to bring in private sector finance to provide new
homes for sale, in peripheral schemes as well as      in purely greenbelt
areas. In Castlemilk, for instance, there has been a clear rise in demand for
council properties to rent. There is also increased interest by the private
sector. What the district council wants is for people to take pride in living
in Glasgow, in private or rented accommodation. As the population reduces and
demand for council houses falls, the need to remodel housing estates becomes
more urgent.
About 11,000 council houses have been demolished over the past 10 years. By
2000, the total could be 15,000. To give a facelift to all tenements would need
massive sums. But, if Castlemilk is anmything to go by, it could make a world
of difference.

Robert MacLeod looks at a scheme to help families move up and down the housing
ladder
THE ideal of a new address by Christmas is still a practical reality for some
of the Scottish families who take advantage of one of the many new
part-exchange purchase schemes now available in most parts of the country.
``Most builders have been fine-tuning their part-exchange scheme procedures to
make the whole process smoother and as swift as possible in terms of getting
information about survey valuations back to clients,'' said the director of
sales for one prominent West of Scotland builder.
``Part-exchange is continuing to grow month by month in terms of its importance
in the overall new house purchase scene in Scotland. Most builders will readily
agree that l995 has been a fantastic year for part-exchange growth, easily
surpassing last year's figures. More and more people have experienced
part-exchange schemes as the best option for speedy, frustration-free moves.''
In some new house developments at least 30% of families moving in are able to
do so because they have taken advantage of a builder's part-exchange plan. At
the same time, a growing number of first-time and other buyers are finding
their dream of a new home becoming reality when they buy a competitively priced
``established home'' from builders selling part-exchange houses.
As the part-exchange option keeps growing in popularity, two of Scotland's
largest housebuilders now point out that they are prepared to consider
properties located anywhere in Britain when customers come forward saying that
they want to relocate in Scotland.
In another widening of the market, the same builders now emphasise that they
are extending their part-exchange schemes to include a section of the
house-buying market which may previously have felt excluded.
``Most part-exchange schemes are intended to assist families trading up towards
a larger new house, with a typical upward difference which may be around
#20,000,'' said another sales director. ``But there are people who, for a whole
variety of reasons, may wish to move to a smaller home - then find that their
existing property can't be accepted for part-exchange because they are trading
down.
``The answer has been to introduce a new and supplementary part-exchange
scheme. In our case, we now work in conjunction with a major group of estate
agents and offer these owners of larger properties a special package of help to
assist in the marketing of their existing property.''
A very wide variety of properties have been bought in by builders in recent
months in part-exchange packages. They have covered a spread from modest flats
priced at around #2l,000 to larger, top of the range family properties at
values sometimes exceeding #150,000.
``Part-exchange schemes are taking the hassle and concern out of the process of
selling an existing property and leaving the way clear for more and more
families to achieve the move which is their goal.''
Stage one in any part-exchange scheme is for the builder to arrange two
independent and separate valuations to be carried out on the customer's
existing home. Following that, the builder can make a carefully decided
part-exchange offer, usually guaranteed for a stated period. The usual aim is
to get back to the customer with that proposed offer within seven days.
``There is nothing really new about part-exchange in the house-building
world,'' said the marketing manager for a firm currently building a wide range
of homes in sites throughout the Central Belt. ``We have offered our own scheme
to customers for the past twelve years. It was first introduced to combat the
difficult market conditions of that time. Today, like many other firms, we now
view part-exchange as an established and basic part of the general house
building business and one which is very much here to stay.''
All concerned agree that any home owner considering part-exchange - ``a service
that can unlock the chains on house sales'' would be well advised to examine
the many options now available in the schemes now being offered by various
builders.
It is an indication of how popular part-exchange has become that one builder
now has an office specifically to deal with that demand. But most others have
details of their particular schemes available at their show houses. The size of
the market involved is illustrated by one builder who achieved a #10m turnover
of established homes last year. He has already seen that figure overtaken in
l995.
Different firms offer different fringe benefits and it can be to the
house-hunter's benefit to compare packages and decide which would be best
suited to particular needs and circumstances.
The many options can include packages covering additional financial assistance
or such things as low interest mortgage packages, plus legal costs and survey
fees being partially funded. Some include free mortgage protection assurance
over a period of up to three years, offering payments of up to a maximum of
twelve months.
The experts agree that when part exchange is part of a new house purchase then
customers can relax knowing what price has been achieved by their exisitng
property and also the contractually agreed price on their new home. The
guesswork has thankfully gone, the commercial risk element is being taken on by
the builder.
They are careful to warn that not everyone automatically qualifies for part
exchange and, above all, the rule has to be that both parties are totally
satisfied before an agreement goes ahead.
But more and more the part exchange option is smoothing the path towards a new
home. With everybody happy.

n HAVE got that sinking feeling? Is your cornice cracking, your skirting
sagging? A house that is subsiding can create tremors in your bank balance but,
if you are properly insured, the problem need not lead to total collapse of
your dream home.
Nationwide, the UK's second largest building society, has produced a
leaflet-guide to subsidence. Designed to help customers who think they may need
to make a claim on their insurance, it also aims to put their minds at ease by
offering advice on......
l.How to recognise subsidence, heave and landslip.
l.What to do if movement of the house is suspected.
l.The different steps involved in making an insurance claim for subsidence and
details of what to expect from the insurers.
l.The kind of questions they are likely          to be asked, enabling them to
save time              by getting the information in advance.
The guide is free to Nationwide borrowers who think they may have subsidence
and wish to claim. Peter Richardson, Nationwide's marketing director, says:
``The aim is to help our customers understand more about subsidence and its
causes, and to reassure them that there are solutions. The guide helps them
with claim procedures and provides sources of contact. We hope it will allay
many fears.''

ADULT learners and ambitious students were rewarded for their efforts in
acquiring new skills and qualifications at the annual Scottish Vocational
Education Council awards ceremony in Glasgow yesterday.
Eight students from colleges across Scotland gathered at the Royal Concert Hall
to receive a student of the year award and a cheque for #350 after
demonstrating exceptional skill and commitment.
Scotvec, the Glasgow-based training organisation, also recognised the efforts
of six schools, four further education colleges, two training organisations,
and a hospital for encouraging people to take up courses.
Among those picking up a trophy was Ms Doreen Carnan, 49, who ventured back
into the world of education after her daughter Connie, 20, was seriously
injured in a car accident nearly nine years ago.
Ms Carnan said that while her daughter lay in a coma she took swimming lessons
and noticed a sign for adult education. She then completed a number of care
courses to help her look after Connie.
One course led to another and despite leaving school with no qualifications Ms
Carnan has completed around 30 Scotvec courses including hairdressing, machine
knitting, and a medical receptionist course at the city's Anniesland College.
Accompanied by her daughter, who now works for Marks &amp; Spencer, she said she
was surprised and delighted to receive an award. Studying, she added, had been
a tremendous experience, opened up a new world and given her something to focus
on while helping her daughter to recover from her injuries.
Speaking at the ceremony, the chief executive of Scottish Enterprise, Mr
Crawford Beveridge, stressed the importance of training and said companies
could compete only if they had a skilled workforce. ``The simple question we
all have to ask is whether we are happy to continuously slip down the
international table of wealth or whether we want to do something about it.''

A LEADING Roman Catholic bishop yesterday pleaded with the IRA to reveal where
its members buried the bodies of at least a dozen people killed during the
Troubles.
The Bishop of Down and Connor, Dr Patrick Walsh, made his appeal as relatives
of the missing revealed plans to carry empty coffins through Belfast on
Christmas Eve to highlight the issue.
Speaking at a service of remembrance in St Mary's Church, Belfast, the bishop
said: ``In the name of humanity, in the name of Christ, I make a fervent and
heartfelt plea for the return of thebodies.''
He added that respect for the dead had always been regarded as a sign of a
civilised society.
``In Ireland, there has been a long and honoured tradition of having a wake at
home so that in the natural and homely setting of the family the relatives can
take their personal farewell of their loved ones.''
He said it was recognised as a valuable constituent of the grieving process
which the relatives of the disappeared had been denied, making their loss more
intense.
One of the relatives, Mr Seamus McKendry, will be among the guests at a west
Belfast factory to be visited by US President Bill Clinton tomorrow.
The IRA kidnapped, killed, and buried his mother-in-law in 1972.
Mr McKendry told the congregation yesterday that the families did not want
revenge, nor political gain, just the return of the bodies.
``They are buried some place on this island, hidden away and forgotten about by
those who try to monopolise justice.
``Today we ask that those responsible for this suffering and anguish own up to
their responsibilities - no-one has the right to keep our families hanging
around in limbo.
``We do not want these masked men and women unmasked, we do not seek
incarceration . . . a phone call, an anonymous letter, a note slipped under a
door will suffice.''
President Clinton has already called for the bodies of the disappeared to be
returned. However, he could face new demands during his visit to Northern
Ireland to put more pressure on Sinn Fein to help end the relative's distress.
Revealing the plans to carry the coffins through Christmas shoppers to a
candlelight vigil outside City Hall in Belfast, Mr McKendry said it was time
republicans realised that the missing had a right to be buried on consecrated
ground.

THE second, smaller, part of John Macleod's article (November 28) devoted to
the Princess of Wales's Panorama interview was one of the best I have read on
the subject. What a pity he had to spoil it.
The Irish Referendum on divorce is an item which has been the subject of much
debate among commentators. Rightly so; as the result showed, it is seen by many
as another example of the erosion of traditional Christian values and influence
in an increasingly secular world. Indeed some weeks ago John Macleod himself
lamented on this trend.
While not agreeing with their specific case one would have thought that he
would have had a grudging respect for their stand and some sympathy for those
who lost the argument.
Alas no; when John Macleod writes about anything Catholic he seems to lose all
sense of proportion and we are subjected, once again, to historical
half-truths, irrelevances, and embellishments based on his own particular
prejudices.
As a responsible newspaper you surely have a responsibility to discuss matters
involving religion with sensitivity. Do you think think it enhances the debate
by giving free-rein to John Macleod's sectarian outbursts? He is a talented
writer who can be controversial without being offensive to Scottish Catholics,
or any other minority.

FROM the outset let me make it plain that I am a Scot, born, bred, and educated
in Ayrshire and Glasgow.
I, too, have stood on the terraces at Hampden, roaring on my beloved Scotland
against all ``enemies'', and in particular the ``effete English''.
That having been said, I found The Herald Essay of November 25 to be an utterly
incomprehensible anachronism.
I enjoy The Herald for its appreciation of the exquisite English language and
do not expect it to give credence to the spread of such drivel.
For the same reason I have no time for the ludicrous radio broadcasts of Billy
Kay.
Such people would have us dragged screaming into the eighteenth century.

CHANCELLOR Kenneth Clarke insisted that he was not of the slash and burn
tendency when he began his Budget statement yesterday.  He went on to prove it
by demonstrating instead an unsuspected ability to snap and singe.  This was
not an adventurous budget; bunnets remain firmly on heads, although City bowler
hats may oscillate gently with approval; all-in-all it was dull, workmanlike
and possibly devious.  We cannot criticise Mr Clarke for this.  He could have
emulated Chancellor Lawson and thrown caution to the winds with a Budget that
might have allowed Britain to feel good at the expense of much pain afterwards.
We should be glad that he did nothing of the sort.  Britain, as a
medium-to-small nation and economy in not particularly good shape, needs
measured and sensible growth rather than any consumer sprint which would
inevitably lead to inflation and further decline.  To that extent, for his
prudence, common sense, and an endearing tendency to make the best of a weak
hand, he may feel content.
Yet there are large questions which are unanswered by the numbers presented by
Mr Clarke.  Estimates of economic growth are notoriously difficult but they are
also important, both psychologically and as a gauge of how the economy is
performing.  The Treasury has missed the target with past forecasts and this is
unfortunate.  Last year it was estimated that growth ove the succeeding 12
months would be 3.25%.  That figure was reduced to 3% earlier this year and
yesterday the Chancellor confirmed that the actual figure would be 2.75%.  We
are not unique in this as national economies around the globe have dipped over
the same period but the downturn has been more noticeable in Britain.  Stocks
have grown much faster than output, investment is poor and showing little sign
of improvement and even exporters, appear  to have rested on their
achievements.  There is nothing in the Budget, apart from the hope of steady
growth and stability, which will remedy this situation.
Unemployment
Nor is there anything coherent which could be described as a serious attempt to
deal with unemployment.  Those measures aimed at businesses, and particularly
small businesses, are welcome.  They will give this vulnerable end of our
business community a measure of breathing space in the form of reductions in
corporation tax and business rates bills, but welcome as this is it is simply
not capable of making much of a dent in the unemployment figures.  It is all
very well to repeat ad nauseam that growth in the economy will eventually lead
to a reduction in unemployment but, in a situation where many people have been
unemployed for a long time, this is an insufficient answer.  And then there is
the Private Finance Initiative, re-launched repeatedly but no more capable of
floating towards harbour than it has ever been.  The Chancellor's emphasis on
this fig-leaf of a policy was one of the most worrying parts of the speech for
the signs are clear that private business has better things to do with its
money and is likely to be strongly tempted only by concessions which would
amount to state subsidy.  None of the measures proposed will create jobs,
either directly or indirectly, and for the sake of the social fabric of the
country this issue should have been addressed with more urgency and commitment.
It is possible, indeed probable, that there is more to come on the subject of
the wider economy.  By keeping tax cuts to the absolute minimum necessary for
what the Tory Party regards as decency, the Chancellor has opened up a degree
of freedom to cut interest rates in the near future.  A simple 1p reduction in
tax, taken together with apparently energetic cutting of Government expenditure
in certain areas, has ensnared a favourable reaction from the City.  With this
in his pocket Mr Clarke will be able to work on an interest rate cut before the
end of the year.  He has been helped by the slowdown in economic growth but
will need to keep a close eye on the value of the pound which will curtail his
ability to cut interest rates.
This is all very well, the various tweakings, trimmings and twitches to the
economy are interesting but of a somewhat neutral nature.  Surveying it all we
have to pinch ourselves hard to recall that until this week the Budget was
being routinely described as the most important in many years, the Budget which
would make or break the Tory Party.  It was to be a political Budget and
rumoured to contain just the sort of proposals traditionally required  to haul
the Government's rapidly burning electoral coals out of the fire.  It appears
to be nothing of the sort, at least not at first glance.  Tory back benchers
are rallying round gamely and proclaiming that a headline 1p income tax cut is
prudent and therefore likely to enhance their reputation as good managers of
the economy, but in their hearts they are disappointed.
Housing Benefits
The abandonment of the sagging housing market to the mystical benefits of an
improving economy will be particularly galling to many Tory MPs who will have
been under steady and increasing pressures from their constituencies  for
something, anything, to be done.  Perhaps the Chancellor is correct and nothing
can be done in the short term but it will not sell well in the South-east.
There are things to cheer Tory MPs, of course.  The assaults on social security
looks like being serious, although an assessment of just how serious, it is
must wait for the fine detail. The restriction on housing benefits for the
under-25s is mean-minded and unworthy while the Chancellor's enthusiasm for
helping older citizens through savings plans and help with care in older age
suggests that he has paid much more attention to the latest
economic/demographic studies.  The spending figures for education, police, and
the NHS likewise imply that Mr Clarke's eye for political advantage has not
dimmed.
Nevertheless, there is something missing.  Nobody in possession of their senses
could believe that this Budget will save the Tory Party.  At least it provides
a steady hand, a soothing voice and a hope for better times.  It suggests
something else: that is the racing certainty that the Government is determined
to hold out until the spring of 1997, or as near to it as it can get.  This
would allow another Budget a year hence in which all the magic tricks of a
political Chancellor could be produced with a flourish.  True, they would not
have the slightest chance of coming into effect before the General Election but
in Mr Clarke's assessment that does not matter.  They will look good, sound
good, and they will do the Tory Party good.  That, at least, is the
calculation, which has the added benefit of featuring a give-away Budget which
would either win the election for the Tories or leave an incoming Labour
government with an almighty mess.  If that is too cynical, consider the
position of the Ulster Unionists.
Peace Process
If the Government hangs on until 1997 their support will be vital, yet Mr
Trimble and his associates are tough men and it is clear that they have little
confidence in Mr Major's handling of the peace process.  The Budget may have
passed, just, but the peace in Northern Ireland is clearly balanced on a
precipice.  The Chancellor may be determined to play a long game, but the game
may yet be taken from him by events which he cannot control.
It is a strange Budget, more subtle than it looks and not really what was
expected.  It is not populist but is not austere, neither does it raise the
hopes of either the country or of the Tory Party.  We have left the subject of
whisky to the last, admittedly not a Scottish trait.  Duty has been reduced but
only an inebriate would forget that it was increased by much the same amount
last year.  Yet Mr Clarke is the first Chancellor in a hundred years actually
to reduce the duty on whisky.  Given his fondness for it, he might find that
fact an acceptable epitaph, given that his original choice - saviour of the
Tory Party - no longer looks attainable.

US President Bill Clinton is due to touch down at Heathrow at about 7am before
launching into an action-packed three-day schedule.
He plans talks with all the province's political leaders including Mr Gerry
Adams and fringe loyalists this evening at a reception at Queen's University
and a senior US Government official said: ``We hope that at the reception the
president will have the opportunity for good substantive exchanges with the
party leaders.''
Mr Clinton's day in London includes a visit to the tomb of the unknown soldier
at Westminster Abbey, talks at Downing Street with Mr Major, followed by a
joint news conference, then an address to both Houses of Parliament.
After that, he goes to Buckingham Palace to meet the Queen, holds a meeting
with Labour leader Tony Blair at the US ambassador's residence in Regents Park,
and attends an evening dinner and reception at Downing Street.
Tomorrow, he flies to Belfast, becoming the first American president to visit
Northern Ireland, and travels immediately to a factory in the nationalist
Springfield Road in west Belfast, where he will make a keynote speech before
heading across town to Unionist-dominated east Belfast.
In Londonderry, he will meet representatives of both sides of the community and
will do so again when he meets Belfast City councillors after switching on the
Christmas tree lights outside Belfast City Hall, which is expected to draw huge
crowds. Belfast-born rock star Van Morrison will perform songs there.
A normal lighting-up ceremony attracts crowds of around 15,000 but the RUC
expect that to be exceeded many times over.
Mrs Hillary Clinton will remain at her husband's side for most of the visit but
will break away for a meeting with female activists from both sides of the
community in a restaurant in south Belfast's Ormeau road - scene of clashes
between Orangemen and Republicans during the summer marching season.
Among those meeting the first lady will be Joyce McCartan, from the Ormeau
road, whose 17-year-old son was killed by UVF gunmen in 1987.
On Friday, the focus switches to the republic. There will be meetings with
President Mary Robinson and Mr Bruton, with a press statement to be issued
after the latter.
Mr Clinton will address a public rally at College Green, where the freedom of
Dublin will be conferred on him. He will then make a joint address to the Dail
and Senate. He may also take time out to enjoy a pint of Guinness in a city pub.
In the evening, he will attend a dinner hosted by Mr Bruton at Dublin Castle
and then flies out on Saturday morning.

Today a family will seek permission to withdraw feeding for a woman who has
lain in a coma for more than three years. Elizabeth Buie looks at the questions
raised by Scotland's first `right to die' court case
SCOTLAND'S first ``right to die'' case will be heard in the Court of Session
today. Law Hospital NHS Trust, with the backing of the family of Mrs Janet
Johnston, 50, of Allanton, near Shotts, will ask the court for permission to
withdraw the feeding system of their patient who has lain in a coma for more
than three years since being admitted to hospital after taking an overdose.
Doctors are agreed that she is in a persistent vegetative state (PVS) with no
hope of recovery. Only artificial feeding is keeping her alive. Mrs Johnston's
daughter, Linda, has been seen on television pleading for her mother to be
allowed to find peace.
The Archdiocese of Glasgow, in its magazine, Flourish, has accused the family
of thinking of itself, rather than seeking peace for Mrs Johnston herself. It
has also warned that giving legal sanction to the withdrawal of artificial
feeding will open the way to the legalisation of euthanasia.
However, the hospital's senior staff say they are bringing the case on
humanitarian grounds.
There can be little doubt this case is intended to clarify the law in Scotland
as regards the treatment of PVS patients. For, although the House of Lords
ruled two years ago in the case of Tony Bland, the young Hillsborough Disaster
victim, its decision is only persuasive in Scotland, not binding. Doctors want
to know where they stand, and particularly whether their actions, even if they
are in accordance with good medical practice, could still leave them open to
prosecution.
Earlier this year, the Scottish Law Commission recommended that doctors in
Scotland should be able to switch off life-support machines that are keeping
brain-dead patients alive and withdraw treatment for the terminally ill without
the risk of being prosecuted or sued - in essence that a doctor's duty of care
does not and should not extend to providing futile medical treatment to
incapable patients.
The issue of switching off life-support machines for brain-dead patients is
largely settled in the public mind. However, the treatment of PVS cases is not.
In their situation, the brain-stem is intact, permitting the patient to breathe
independently, but the higher levels of the brain are damaged beyond hope of
recovery.
It was the case of Tony Bland that really opened up to public debate the issue
of whether artificial feeding, which is necessary to keep the patient alive,
constitutes a medical intervention. Doctors maintain it does, and that its
withdrawal comes within the scope of the decisions they have to make daily to
discontinue treatment which is no longer of benefit to the patient.
However, one of the difficulties of PVS cases is it can take some time for the
condition to be safely regarded as irrevocable. The British Medical Association
therefore recommends a minimum of one year of insentience before that decision
is reached. After that point, the BMA believes the persistent vegetative state
can be declared permanent.
The House of Lords' ruling in the Bland case confirmed it is acceptable in some
circumstances for a decision to be made to provide or withdraw treatment in the
patient's best interests, but that until such time as a body of experience and
practice has built up, each case will have to go before a court.
However, no-one has yet satisfactorily explained what the patient's ``best
interests'' are, how they are measured, or whether it can ever be in anyone's
interests to be allowed to die rather than be kept alive.
In Scotland, up until the Bland judgment, it was generally held that if a
doctor acted in accordance with responsible body of medical opinion, he was not
acting negligently if he withdrew artificial feeding. But there was no clear
legal direction and the issue remained: is the removal of tubal feeding an act
or an omission? If a doctor has a straightforward duty of care, then surely he
or she has a duty not to omit in the same way as he or she has an obligation to
act? Or is this issue simply a ``distinction with a difference''?
As the supreme civil court in the UK, the House of Lords' ruling in Bland
should have laid the matter to rest. But while its judgment is highly
persuasive in Scotland, it is not binding, and it will be open to the Court of
Session to reach a different conclusion in the Johnston case.
The other underlying problem with the Bland case is that, while all five House
of Lords judges reached the same conclusion, they arrived at it from different
perspectives and using different arguments. Significantly, two of them
suggested this was not a matter for the courts and they urged the Government to
legislate.
Against this background, the Court of Session's ruling is likely to be very
significant. The court has a number of options before it:
n.To disallow the withdrawal of tubal feeding on the grounds this equates with
passive euthanasia and is therefore a criminal offence.
n.To claim the argument is not backed up sufficiently by medical evidence and
that withdrawal of tubal feeding would be negligent.
n.To authorise removal because it is not in the interests of the individual to
be kept in this condition.
n.To allow withdrawal because such an action is based on current medical
practice.
The Court of Session may then rule on whether each future case must be
considered in court - as the House of Lords did in Bland - or it may lay down
guidelines that hospitals must follow in future, which is what the BMA favours.
Professor Sheila McLean, head of Glasgow University's Institute of Law and
Ethics in Medicine, would like the court to call for Government legislation.
She is concerned that decisions on PVS cases may be considered purely on
clinical grounds, while in her opinion they are a matter that society as a
whole must consider.
She adds that medical teams may inevitably find themselves taking resource
implications into account. They will honestly believe such considerations do
not come into the equation, but subliminally, the question will be there.
``Prognosis and diagnosis are clinical, but as a society we have a role in
saying whether this is a right thing to do with people simply because their
condition is hopeless,'' she says.
Nor have relatives a technical legal right to make decisions about healthcare
in respect of an adult person. They cannot be dispassionate. For some people,
if a member of their family is in a PVS condition, not suffering, the instinct
may be to say they should be allowed to go peacefully. Others may argue for
keeping them alive at all costs as long as possible.
``I actually think that relatives and doctors are very well placed to
understand the grief that is going on because they are experiencing it. But I
do not think they are sufficiently distanced or dispassionate to leave the
decision up to them,'' says Professor McLean.
If we are to follow down the path she suggests and adopt permissive legislation
dealing with difficult cases such as this - in the way the Government did over
the Abortion Act - then as a society we will have to consider many related
issues. How do we feel about voluntary euthanasia, or even non-voluntary
euthanasia? What is our position on assisted suicide?
Can we actually find the courage to state openly what is quietly acknowledged -
that we allow some handicapped infants to die, and accept the decision of
rational adults when they say they do not wish certain treatment?
Professor McLean believes we should start from the point that it is always
wrong to take another person's life - but there are certain conditions which if
met, will not render such an action wrong.
``This would give everybody involved, doctors and families, a set of tests
against which they can measure their judgment. It would relieve them of the
pressures. It would take the moral burden away from them and allow those of us
who are competent at the moment security in the knowledge we will be treated
with respect,'' she says.
Those with religious objections would not be obliged to participate.
She also argues from a pragmatic point of view, saying that such actions are
taking place anyway and it would, therefore, be better if they were carried out
according to guidelines.
She also believes it would be kinder to doctors and families - for doctors,
because at present they have to shoulder an awesome responsibility, a
responsibility particularly hard to bear for people who have been trained to
cure and to restore health.
Some medical experts believe there are between 1000 and 1500 PVS cases in the
UK at present. It is possible the Court of Session's ruling may lead to a long
string of other hospitals coming to court to ask permission to withdraw
artificial feeding; or the responsibility may be thrown back at the doctors and
families, and the public will never know how many decisions have been taken
privately to accord the right to die; or, in the final analysis, the court may
rule it is not in Mrs Johnston's best interests to have her tubal feeding
withdrawn.

YOU report that Britain's Armed Forces no longer have the capacity to launch a
Falklands-style operation (Britain's sinking power on the seas, November 27).
Garrisoning and rehearsing the reinforcement of the Falklands and South
Georgia, the sovereign bases in Cyprus, Gibraltar, Ascension, Diego Garcia,
Hong Kong, and other British dependent territories are legacies of the British
Empire which consume around 15% of the UK's defence budget.
To maintain an illusion of greatness with Trident the Government admits to
spending 8.6% of the defence budget, although the true cost is much higher.
The money invested in Trident might have been better spent equipping the
conventional forces to meet their post-imperial obligations.
The most refreshing aspect of the current defence review in the SNP is that
none of the above obligations, either inherited or chosen by the UK parties,
will be incumbent upon an independent Scotland.
Not only will the people of Scotland, through their parliament, be able to
choose where and when they will deploy Scotland's forces. The reduction in
defence expenditure brought about by being released from the above obligations
will also free resources for defence diversification and investment in the
infrastructure of Scotland.

A POLICE officer on trial for corruption advised a man with whom he regularly
drank how to deal with a police investigation into incidents, including one
involving a firearm, in which he had been involved, the High Court in Aberdeen
was told yesterday.
Ian William Smith, 32, who the court has heard was known as ``Fat Billy'' and
was a police informant, said he had been friendly with a number of policemen
through his job as a barman, including the accused, Mr Neil Cooper.
He said as well as being a barman at the time he had sold fake watches,
perfume, and T-shirts, and recalled an incident in which he lost a briefcase
which contained #600 or #700 worth of watches.
He said he phoned Mr Cooper at Grampian Police headquarters and asked him to
let him know if he heard anything about them. He told the court that, a week
later, Mr Cooper contacted him and gave him the name of the man who was
apparently selling them.
He and a friend, Ronald Cormack, who the court has heard is serving 15 years
for drugs and firearms offences, tracked him down to his home.
Smith said the man, Brian Brown, had threatened them, at which point Cormack
had gone to his car and returned with a handgun which he held at Brown's face.
Brown then agreed to return the watches.
Smith said he had been concerned and had phoned Mr Cooper because the incident
had become more serious than he had expected.
He told the court: ``Mr Cooper said it was stupid and he wasn't very happy but
just to leave it with him.''
Smith said that, a few weeks later, he received a call from Mr Cooper who told
him a report had been received about the incident.
He contacted Cormack and they both met Mr Cooper outside a bar before they
later reported to the police station.
Smith claimed Mr Cooper told them to deny having the gun. He said to say they
had been in Brown's house but did not have a gun.
Asked why Mr Cooper had warned him, he said: ``Because he was my pal.''
The trial continues.

EVER heard of a meat boutique? They have in Stonehaven. Shoppers in the
Kincardineshire town have become blase about the flair of their unusual butcher
shop - Charles McHardy's - in the market square. The 88-year-old family
business prides itself on employing a professional to dress the windows: the
Christmas display went up last week. And trade has gone up by 20% since
McHardy's became top butcher's shop in Scotland earlier this year.
Charles McHardy and his brother Kenneth crowned previous owners by winning the
Meat Trade Journal's new Top Shop Award For Scotland. They are also UK
runners-up.
In the past, the Journal has run numerous product competitions, but this is the
first time the focus has been on shops as a whole. The three judges - a meat
and livestock commission inspector, a food economist and a freelance journalist
- declared McHardy's to have ``not only a superb choice of product, but a whole
range of foods to make a complete meal''. And they were very impressed with the
hygiene standards.
Charles McHardy recalls the judges did a very thorough job: ``They were into
our computer programme to see how we do pricing, they were running fingers
across the top of pictures - they were practically under the floorboards.'' In
common with the other 215 participants who entered the first round, McHardy's
was nominated by wholesalers and was required to submit an illustrated CV.
Scotland was one of seven UK areas represented. The 35 shops who were graduated
to the next round had to submit to rigorous inspection.
Of Top Shop Award's 21 finalists, 16 belong to the Q Guild, an exclusive meat
retailers' association which grants membership (50 in Scotland) to those who
meet its high standards. Like many Q Guild members, McHardy's enter products
for the three-yearly meat traders fair at Utrecht; it is through visits to
Holland that the brothers became aware of the gulf between continental and
British butchers. ``The Dutch are clean, methodical and good businessmen,''
says Charles. ``The average UK butcher falls down on presentation.''
To that end, McHardy's has spent #140,000 over the last seven years in
state-of-the-art refurbishment.
Patrons of McHardy, some of whom travel 15 miles from Aberdeen, can choose from
15 ready-made meals including Chicken Catalan (which won a gold medal at
Smithfield) and 14 different stir-frys. Steak and chicken wine marinades are
especially popular, as is the shop's diversification into bakery products,
overseen by the McHardys' niece. For Christmas, the brothers are preparing
their sought-after boned turkey stuffed with ham; and they supply hampers
(smoked gammon, tongue etc) for oil companies in the area.
Charles explains: ``We hope to cure our own bacon, even smoke it and we're
considering a mail shot. Our competitors are the supermarkets, so we want to do
all the things they can't do.''

DAMIEN Hirst, the man who floats sheep and cows in glass cases, was last night
named this year's winner of the #20,000 Turner prize.
The controversial conceptual artist had been favourite of the four shortlisted
artists to win.
He had the highest public profile, thanks to the notoriety of his work and to
his populist approach.
Jury members said they thought this year's artists had been varied and well
matched.
Hirst, 30, was presented with his prize at an awards dinner at the Tate Gallery
in London by Brian Eno, avant garde musician and former Roxy Music member.
His main exhibit at the shortlist show - a cow and calf each cut in half and
called Mother and Child Divided - was late going on display because preserving
fluid threatened to leak from the display cases.
He also showed two of his ``spot'' paintings called after modern
pharmaceuticals.
However, the judges awarded him the prize for exhibitions in Pittsburgh,
Berlin, and the Serpentine Gallery, London.
Hirst has said: ``I wanted to make art that everybody could believe in.''
The jury, chaired by Tate director Nicholas Serota, praised him ``for having
created an extraordinary series of objects that have caught the public
imagination.''

Niddrie area of Edinburgh late last night. A spokesman said there had been a
serious incident in the vicinity of Greendykes Road. It is understood a
middle-aged man was shot. Early today, eight police vehicles were parked
outside a three-storey block of flats in Greendykes Road as officers
investigated. Police were on patrol around the building.
Church for sale
THE Church of Scotland is selling the Old Parish Church, Alexandria,
Dunbartonshire, which houses the town clock. The building became surplus to
requirements when congregations in the Vale of Leven area merged last year.
Robbery foiled
POLICE in Edinburgh are investigating an attempted robbery at a Pik-N-Save
grocer's shop, in Easter Drylaw Place, Drylaw, where staff, threatened with a
handgun, foiled the two men by locking the till and throwing the keys away. The
men, in their mid-20s, drove off in a stolen blue Ford van.
Fumes scare
TWO young female students were taken to hospital in Edinburgh after being
overcome by ammonia fumes from a leaking refrigerator at their residence in the
city's Warrender Park Road, yesterday. A spokeswoman at Edinburgh Royal
Infirmary said the students were released after treatment.
Hogmanay buses
EXTRA free buses will take revellers home after this year's Edinburgh Hogmanay
street party. Lothian Regional Council said yesterday the number of buses would
be increased from 34 to 53 and would run from St Andrew Square from 15 minutes
after midnight until 3.15am on January 1.
Homely hotel
MS Tricia Fitzsimons, 33, whose father, John, is the senior sheriff at
Dumbarton, has taken over as general manager of the Mews Hilton in Park Lane,
London. She intends to make it the most homely hotel in the capital. One of her
first moves will be to buy a ``big soppy dog to lie in front of the fire''.
Sewage decision
STRATHCLYDE councillors agreed yesterday to seek local planning permission for
structures to house disinfection and screening equipment for sewage outfalls at

There's a new look for the career woman - and it suits her. John Davidson finds
that power dressing is giving way to a more feminine style
WHAT'S happened to power dressing? Forget your preconceptions - that pair of
outsize shoulder pads and a rather assertive lapel line. The new armour of the
executive woman is feminine elegance.
Disarming is exactly the effect of such svelte sophistication - as streamlined
and unadorned as a sixties skyscraper. Like modernist architecture, fuss-free
daytime dressing depends on strong simple lines, spare, minimal detailing and
distinctive fabrications.
Maybe there is something just vaguely reminiscent of the late fifties and early
sixties in these refined clothes, the way an eyebrow is to be drawn, those
carefully defined lips. But this is not another wave of retro-fashion - better
suited to fancy-dress than life in the real world. This is fashion defined by
committed modernists like Gianni Versace.
Some principles of the business world just never change. Which means that city
style is still based on the suit. But the newest suit fits as snugly as the
satin glove which is its unexpected partner. (Yes - even for business.) The
jacket is cut brace-close to the midriff; skirts hug the hips in what could be
termed an intimate caress. Or, most radically, the suit becomes a lean-fitting
sleeveless dress worn under a matching jacket or coat.
Ease is abolished. In its place comes effect. And for effect, think effort. For
there is nothing carefree or careless about the new ideal of elegance.
It takes a deal of time and application to work nails into that perfect short,
French manicure. It takes practice to master really elegant heels. And it
surely requires a computerlike memory to dispense with all the paraphernalia of
information materials in order that hand baggage can be restricted to an
elegant clutch.
No briefcase? Well, there's true minimalism for you. Clearly this new executive
woman is so successful that she has someone else to lug her laptop.

WE ARE constantly advised that there is a lack of both financial and human
resources in the prosecution service in Scotland with little prospect of funds
being made available to correct this.
The press reports that recently a court in Falkirk was closed and offenders set
free all because there was no prosecutor available to deal with the cases.
Against this background how does the procurator-fiscal in Glasgow best utilise
his scarce resources? He sits with a notebook and video recorder watching an
on-field incident at a football match. The fact that such matches are subject
to their disciplinary code seems to escape him.
The justification for all this effort and expense is some nebulous theory that
the public may take a lead from the conduct of those they are watching on the
field. There is no evidence to support this.
Surely in the present climate the fiscal's energies could be better channelled
elsewhere. On the other hand there are those of us who might regard this
interest in football by the authorities as a cynical attempt to draw attention
away from their inadequacies in more routine cases.

The Scottish Secretary has become adept at confounding his critics. Margaret
Vaughan profiles a politician who is sure of his own standing
WE were all wrong, you know, to conjure up those spine-chilling images on
Michael Forsyth's return to Scotland. All that hairy-scary nonsense, with Drac
is Back, and the Bogeyman's Revenge...... The Nightmare on Cliche Street, as
one observer described the coverage of his appointment in July.
Wrong, because Michael Forsyth II, the Sequel, never lived up to its
flesh-eating publicity. Wrong, anyway, to borrow from the blood-curdling
lexicon of horror films.
From those opening moments, when he sprang like John Travolta into the news
conference at St Andrews House, we should have known. The soft shoe shuffle for
Scottish local authorities, a smouldering tango with the scion of Scotland's
trade union movement, Campbell Christie: yes, we should have been brave enough
to admit it.
This is Michael Forsyth as you have never seen him before. The man has had a
makeover. Ditched his old demonic image as Drac for a nimble new Travolta
routine. He's been doing a vigorous lambada, dancing circles round some of his
opponents, who are left looking like old twits doing a sad, sedate twist.
It has been an astonishing performance in wrong-footing his critics. But then
the man has rewritten the script. And the zealous Thatcherite novice, who as
Scottish Tory Party chairman so alienated huge sections of his own party by
bringing in a chorus of pimply youthful aides with mobile phones and no
political acumen that he almost split the Scottish party asunder, has entirely
recast himself.
If he comes a cropper, it won't be for want of polishing up his political
routine. Hoofing it around Scotland making conciliatory noises, nurses are
nice, teachers are super: sashaying along to the haunts of his old adversaries,
those Scottish Tories who helped his political trajectory take a swift
southernly direction, making soothing noises about the union.
His latest bit of nifty footwork is an attempt to out-perform the carefully
worked out steps of the Scottish Constitutional Convention towards a Scottish
parliament.
Today he will take the wraps off his plans to make the Union dance to a new
tune. He is expected to tell Parliament he wants to revive the old Scottish
Economic Council, give the Scottish Grand Committee greater focus, and devolve
back to local councils many of the freedoms and responsibilities sucked into
the centrist corridors of Tory power. The performance has been well-rehearsed.
It is his speech to local authorities, timed for tomorrow to coincide with the
unveiling of details of the Constitutional Convention's final cut, that will
disclose just how nimble he can be in bolstering the Unionist argument.
A surprise or three is expected: it is hardly in his nature to fail to conjure
up an image grabbing headline.
So far, Mr Forsyth's come-back to the Scottish political stage after three
years banishment has involved a lot of adroit footwork. Can he keep it up?
Let's step back and review the performance so far.
When John Major appointed Forsyth Scottish Secretary in July, it took him by
surprise, according to some political observers. After his enforced move south,
he impressed as a junior minister in two departments, but was said to believe
his star was in decline.
That he was elevated came as no great surprise in Scotland: in the depleted
Tory ranks who else was there to replace the languidly, urbane Ian Lang on his
promotion to Trade and Industry?
Forsyth told Peter Jones, the Economist's Scottish political commentator, it
was a chance he never believed he would get. He intended to make the most of it.
The wounds within Tory ranks had not quite healed. His free-market, Thatcherite
enthusiasms had not diminished: far from it. He remains an unreconstructed
right-winger, as he freely admits. But he had to take the deeply-suspicious
Scottish Conservative Party with him.
When he arrived at the Scottish Office, this time in the driving seat instead
of strapped into the back, he came as a reinvigorated force but with a
remarkably more conciliatory tone.
On one view, he has accepted he exists in a changed political landscape. No
longer the pampered political toy-boy of the Thatcher years, his means must to
be tailored to suit the terrain. By the same view, he learned from his previous
incarnation that in order to reach the end you seek, you have to take people
with you. He has, in other words, polished up his political skills, but with
the same end in view.
Those who have watched his shrewd adoption of a conciliatory tone, instead of
the hectoring, dogmatic voice of the right-wing ideologue, point out he does
indeed appear to be a man rejuvenated. He has thrown his restless intelligence
and dynamism into the role.
In the past, he was held in check because he was simply a minister. A junior
minister can only do what a Secretary of State allows him to do. Now he is the
master, albeit of a small country. His raw energy has shaken up civil servants.
There is resentment that he appears to want 100 impossible tasks performed
before breakfast and that he has brought in his own personal, political aides.
He has, though, shown either cunning or considerable shrewdness, depending on
whom you listen to, in tiptoeing round Scottish political sensibilities. For
instance, he has said he wants to keep increases in water rates down to 6%. But
he can easily recoup the money lost through forcing local authorities to raise
the rates. He knows people will blame the councils not the Government. Nor has
he foisted privatisation in forestry or water.
In one of his first interviews as Scottish Secretary, Mr Forsyth told The
Herald he intended to approach his new job in something of the spirit in which
he operated in his own Stirling constituency, representing the interests of the
whole area, not just those who voted for him.
He said, too, he wanted to find common ground with local councils, be a
listening ear. And indeed his conciliatory tone at the first meeting with the
Convention of Scottish Local Authorities surprised, even confused, many who
were there.
The mutual back-slapping didn't last long. By autumn, Forsyth, along with his
local government minister George Kynoch launched a series of jointly ferocious
attacks on some of the new unitary authorities, accusing them of paying
themselves too many allowances, employing too many staff, and creating ``jobs
for the boys''.
The strain at the seams of the jolly new relationship was beginning to show.
Whether he can mend broken fences by announcing powers to be returned to local
councils on Thursday remains to be seen.
According to one insider, having been given a second chance in Scotland Forsyth
has grabbed it with both hands. He knows he has around 15 months to go until
the General Election, so he has decided to fling everything he has into it. If
the Tories lose, and he with them, he has given it his best shot.
Whatever the outcome, he cannot lose. He is young, just over 40, and looking to
the longer-term, would re-emerge as one of the few right-wingers with Cabinet
experience in some distant Conservative revival, perhaps for an English seat.
Irrespective of whether the Tories win or lose, if he holds up their Scottish
vote, he will have achieved what he set out to do, to secure a Tory base in
Scotland. He has done, as one observer says, what appeared to be impossible in
adapting the tone - if not the ultimate message - of his political ideology.
On his appointment, he said his views, the principles and ideas, remain the
same. The way he planned to go about things had changed: ``I think that I have
probably a greater understanding, having done a number of jobs in Government,
about how to get to your destination. That does not mean that you've forgotten
where you are travelling to.''
So if Michael Forsyth, the consummate politician, is dancing the Last Waltz
towards a General Election, it is to his old tune, played softly. A final
curtain call is some time off yet.

JOHN Hodgert tells us that the way forward for Scotland is that we should all
learn to write Scots or Gaelic (Herald Essay, November 25). Aye, and I suppose
national dignity will be fully restored when the White Heather Club returns to
our television screens.
The Saint Andrew's Flag should not remind us, as he suggests, of a crossroads
but of a ford. Athelstane Ford to be precise.
The whole point about a ford is this: you cannae go forward if you're feart to
get your feet wet. The story of our nation's flag and the battle of Athelstane
Ford has a clear, unambiguous message - there is a time when you have to stop
running and turn to fight.
Now if writing in Scots is all the fight Mr Hodgert can muster then fair
enough, contribution gratefully accepted, but I imagine that his essay had
Michael Forsyth sniggering into his breakfast.

<HEADLINE>Absentee laird gifts 10,700 acres to Melness crofters</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>
<PAGE>9</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975143066</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
AN absentee laird has gifted 10,700 acres of his estate at Melness, Sutherland,
to crofters.
Mr Michael Foljambe, 63, who lives in Nottinghamshire, had asked the 60
crofters to respond by yesterday to his offer to give them crofts and common
grazing land on his estate.
The estate is centred on Melness (population 150), at the western end of the
causeway which carries the north coast A836 road over the Kyle of Tongue.
Yesterday, Mr Frank Gordon, the Melness grazings clerk said: ``We have said
`yes' unanimously to Mr Foljambe's generous offer. We hope that the formalities
will be concluded soon, so that we will become the actual owners by the new
year''.
Mr Foljambe's family have owned the 32,000-acre Melness and Hope Estate for
more than 40 years. He owns land in the Midlands but has no heirs.
He inherited the land in North Sutherland on the death of his father in 1983.
He will retain the non-crofting area, which has valuable fishings and shootings.
He is also passing on the mineral rights under the land-surface to the crofters
and they will gain control of the shootings on the common grazings, which they
have agreed to lease back to him.
Croft rents at around #4 to #5 per year have not been increased since they were
fixed at that level in 1886, when the Crofters Act ended the Clearances by
giving tenant crofters security of tenure over ``their'' lands for the first
time.
Mr Foljambe said he had been thinking about gifting the crofting portion of his
land to locals for some time.
He explained: ``It has always saddened me that children have to leave Melness
as soon as the finish their schooling. There is no possibility of me living
there and I think that the local community could develop its possibilities
better than I can from afar.''
He added: ``For instance, there is now a better availability of public funds
for development projects in rural areas, which makes community self-management
more viable these days.''
The Melness crofters could model their new set-up on the ground-breaking Assynt
Crofters Trust.
The 200 crofters there bought the 8000-acre estate, near Lochinver, in West
Sutherland, three years ago and have embarked on a programme of improvements
and diversification into electronics, hydro-power, forestry, and fish farming.
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth visited the Assynt crofters recently and
announced that he wants to hand over 250,000 acres of ``nationalised'' land
involving 1400 crofts on 56 estates in the Highlands to local crofters' trusts.
The situation in Melness contrasts with the recent threat of rent increases
faced by 130 crofters on the other side of the Kyle of Tongue.
Crofters on the Borgie, Tongue, and Skerray lands were told early in the autumn
that Sutherland Estates wanted to raise rents.
However, earlier this month, the 74-year-old Dowager Countess of Sutherland, a
direct descendant of the first duke, of Clearance infamy, stepped in to block
the move by her factor Mr Christopher Whealing and her son Lord Strathnaver.
She asked them to withdraw the formal application to the Scottish Land Court
for the rise, which would have been the first since 1984.

A LAWYER collapsed in the dock as he was jailed for a year for embezzlement at
Glasgow Sheriff Court yesterday.
William Templeton, 39, crashed to the floor after he was found guilty of
embezzling #11,605.
His wife, who was in court for his sentencing, ran to his aid.
Templeton, of Heath Avenue, Lenzie, near Glasgow, had admitted at an earlier
hearing taking the money from 10 clients' accounts at the city law firm where
he was a partner in 1990.
Defence solicitor-advocate Paul Burns said that Templeton had suffered stress
at the time of the offence.
Mr Burns added that Templeton's daughter had been ill, his wife pregnant, and
that he had money worries.
He said that Templeton had been subject to stress in his legal practice.
Mr Burns told the court: ``A remarkable log was kept by one of the partners of
the obsessive atmosphere in the office, and one wonders if there was any legal
work done at times.
``Templeton was working a 12-hour day and being phoned at home by two partners
who were clearly at war with each other.
``He was like a child in the middle of a divorce.''
Templeton was only paid the ``wages of a typist'' and was forced to carry out
``homers'' doing joinery work and started a toy soldier business which failed,
Mr Burns said.
As he became ill Templeton suffered irrational fears and plan- ned building a
nuclear shelter in the back garden of his home.
The lawyers' guarantee fund had made good the money embezzled from the 10
clients, some of them elderly, but the partners of the law firm, McDowall and
Kerr, of West George Street, Glasgow, were left out of pocket.
Depute-fiscal Ian Bradley told the court that Templeton, who has been struck
off as a practising solicitor, had committed a ``gross breach of trust'' when
the took the money.
As Sheriff Brian Lockhart jailed him Templeton collapsed, vanishing from view
in the dock.
His schoolteacher wife later accompanied him in an ambulance to Glasgow's Royal
Infirmary.

THE Princess of Wales would make an ``excellent roving ambassador'', Argentine
president Carlos Menem said yesterday, as he declared that her visit to his
country had helped mend relations with Britain.
The result of the princess's first foreign foray since her declaration in her
Panorama interview that she wanted an ambassadorial role was ``exceptional,
absolutely positive''.
``She managed to make her way to the heart of the people of Argentina,'' he
said, adding that she ``could be an excellent roving ambassador of goodwill,
representing the UK in the rest of the world''.
The president told the BBC Radio 4 programme Today that he sympathised with the
princess over all the media pressure she faced.
The visit passed without any major demonstration over sovereignty of the
Falklands but Mr Menem reiterated Argentina's claim to the islands.

HIGHLAND Council leader Peter Peacock is calling on community groups in the
area to declare their views on the renewed campaign to bring British time into
line with Europe.
Councillor Peacock believes there is a need for widespread debate on the
proposed scrapping of Greenwich Mean Time, which would mean clocks staying at
British Summer Time in winter and moving forward another hour in summer.
Victim named
POLICE yesterday named the victim of a road accident as Mr Walter Beattie, 42,
of Braeside Road, Ballinluig, Perthshire, who had just alighted from a bus in
the village when he was struck by a car. Mr Beattie died from multiple injuries
in hospital.
Hope for jobs
UP to 50 new jobs are expected to be created in Perth, hopefully before
Christmas. The district council is negotiating with an as-yet unnamed company
over land and a building on the town's Inveralmond industrial estate.
Action delayed
INDUSTRIAL action by thousands of workers at car manufacturer Vauxhall has been
postponed for a week because of a ``technicality'', unions announced yesterday.
Production workers at the company's plants in Luton and Ellesmere Port were due
to start an overtime ban and a two-hour a week ``strike'' today in protest at a
3.5% pay offer.
Appeal response
MORE than 150 callers have responded to a police appeal for help concerning
nine girls and young women untraced since visiting 25 Cromwell Street,
Gloucester, the home of Frederick and Rosemary West, where the bodies of nine
young women were discovered. Rosemary West was jailed for life last week after
being found guilty of murder.
Death toll
SHETLAND is Britain's fatal accident blackspot, a survey revealed yesterday. It
had 21.74 deaths per 100,000, compared with the national average of just 6.7.

BRIAN Meek (We can't have our oatcake and eat it, November 23) is clearly a
humorous and warm-hearted man. He is also a good sports journalist and gets
into international rugby matches at Murrayfield for nothing. So he must have
heard, quite a few times by now, the spectators fervently singing that bit
about being ``a nation again''.
They mean it too, as every indicator has shown for years now. So I find it
genuinely sad that Brian Meek should rubbish the best offer so far made to give
the Scottish people their wish - a Scottish parliament.
I speak for no political party and I would accept that there are flaws and
weaknesses in the proposed parliament, but it's a start and the Scottish people
will no doubt improve it with the passage of time.
Can Mr Meek not see that he is playing the role of King Canute? Scottish
political history since the Second World War shows the irresistible rise of the
Scottish people's will to nationhood, despite many setbacks. Had people like Mr
Meek and Allan Massie, for example, understood this we might have had a
parliament ere now.
The deep-lying social magma that has fuelled this long drive to the resumption
of nationhood is the frustrated desire to give again to the world the fruits of
Scotland's innovative genius.
Our ancestors brought civilisation to Europe in the Dark Ages; the Reformation
and the Scottish Enlightenment are great landmarks in European history; the
Industrial Revolution was born in the work of James Watt and Adam Smith; and
the whole modern electronic miracle stems from the work of James Clerk Maxwell,
as Einstein recognised.
To do things like that again Scotland needs, and means, to be free. Brian Meek
should get on board.

<HEADLINE>Parents' anger at opt-out petition</HEADLINE>

PARENTS of children at an Ayrshire primary school are to seek legal advice over
an opting-out petition which they claim they were duped into signing.
They say a small group misled them into signing the petition, which has
triggered a ballot on quitting the state system.
The claim came at the meeting in Gateside village hall last night after a
number of speakers had spoken out against the opting-out proposal.
There was anger as several parents declared they had never intended that opting
out should be put to a ballot and that they only wanted information about the
possibilities.
One parent, Mrs Elizabeth Steel, said: ``This has been a waste of time and
completely unnecessary. Why did we have to go through all this ridiculous carry
on just to get some information.''
The controversy began earlier this month when it was disclosed that a
49-signature petition had been received by the school board. It left the board
no choice but to initiate procedures for a ballot to be set up for completion
at the end of January.
However, as word of the ballot spread, parents told the school board it was
never their intention, and that they wanted their signatures withdrawn.
Mr Alistair Wilson, vice-chairman of the school board, warned against opting
out and added: ``If it went ahead, Gateside would wither and die. There is an
avalanche waiting round the corner to sweep this wonderful school away. And it
would be all for a bit of political dogma.
``The whole opting out process is dangerous nonsense and must be rejected.''
Mr David Bates, however, presented a strong argument for opting out. He said it
would save the school from closure and that it would prosper, as many schools
in England have done under grant-aided support.
Mr John Travers, director of education at the new North Ayrshire Council, told
the meeting it had never been the council's intention to close Gateside and he
gave a five-year pledge on the future of the 67-pupil primary school.
He said: ``There appears to have been an attempt to convince parents that
opting out is necessary to safeguard Gateside primary from the threat of
closure.
``Let me assure you that North Ayrshire Council has no intention of proposing
such a closure and is aware of the central role played by the primary school.''
Support for the parents came from Cunninghame North MP Brian Wilson, who is to
ask Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth today to halt the ballot procedure.
Mr Wilson said: ``For whatever reason, political or otherwise, many parents
appear to have been duped into believing that all they were doing was seeking
advice on opting out and protecting their school.
``Instead, a series of events which they did not want was launched and now it
must be stopped. I will be urging Michael Forsyth to end this fiasco before it
causes any further problems for the pupils, teachers or parents of this fine
village school.''
Head teacher Agnes McGuigan said: ``The staff and pupils have been greatly
upset by the events of recent weeks. We are anxious that it can now be brought
to a halt and that we can get on with what we are here to do - teaching the
children of the area.''
The chairperson of the school board, Mrs Helen Smith, will be seeking counsel's
advice on how the petition can be withdrawn and the opting out ballot stopped.
She said: ``We do not want the uncertainty to continue. However, if the ballot
has to go ahead, I am confident the outcome will be an overwhelming rejection
of opting out for Gateside.''

The peace process was rescued last night when John Bruton flew to London to
meet John Major. John Cooney reports on the background
THE launching late last night of a twin-track policy to advance the peace
process in Northern     Ireland was inspired by a manic-like determination by
Taoiseach John Bruton to secure a deal with John Major ahead of President Bill
Clinton's visit to Britain and Ireland.
The 48-year-old Irish Premier's diplomacy centres on the finding of a formula
to circumvent London's demands that the IRA should hand over some of its arms
and ammunition as a precondition for Sinn Fein's admission to all-party
political talks.
The deal involves a tight schedule. It aims to achieve all-party talks by
mid-February, with the commission reporting on ways of decommissioning arms by
mid-January.
After two phone calls the decision was taken by Bruton to travel to London for
a joint presentation of the deal.
An Irish Government spokesman indicated that the breakthrough hinges on the
terms of reference to be given by the two governments to an international
commission that would examine the arms decommissioning issue.
The Irish Government has argued that all the elements involved in
decommissioning of weaponry should come under the remit of the commission,
including the British demand that some weapons must be handed over by the IRA
before Sinn Fein can take part in round-table talks.
Dublin is also trying to persuade Britain to keep an open mind on the
commission's work, especially its efforts to determine other ways in which
British wishes can be met.
However, in view of Major's sensitivities, the Irish are prepared to accept
Britain need not make a prior commitment on this alternative approach. The
Irish expectations are based on Britain making concessions on the arms issue -
on the basis of a fudge.
The latest burst of diplomatic activity came after London and Dublin appeared
to be at loggerheads. Bruton's frantic telephone diplomacy with Major had taken
place as pessimism grew of an IRA return to hostilities in the early New Year
if Dublin and London fail to break the deadlock over the arms issue.
Sources close to Bruton insist he is driven by a mission not to go down in the
history books as the man who failed to consolidate the 15-month IRA ceasefire
which he inherited from his predecessor, Albert Reynolds.
Question marks have hung over Bruton's handling of the peace process following
his pull-out from a scheduled summit with John Major in September after Sinn
Fein leaders warned him the IRA would not give up a single gun.
Suspect in Sinn Fein eyes of being too conciliatory to Ulster Unionists - he is
sneeringly referred to as ``John Unionist'' - Bruton lost the confidence of
Unionists who regarded his summit postponement as capituation to Sinn Fein.
Increasingly, Dublin has looked to Washington in the hope that President
Clinton would put pressure on London to show flexibility.
Reports of progress carried yesterday by Irish newspapers emphasised the
involvement of two senior Clinton aides, Anthony Lake, national security
adviser, and Nancy Soderberg, the President's Northern Ireland adviser.
The overnight optimism came after Britain and Ireland appeared to be engaged in
a war of words about who was to blame for the loss of momentum in the stalled
peace process.
In a widely quoted article in the Irish Independent, the commentator and
author, Tim Pat Coogan, claimed Britain was using the decommissioning argument
to prevent progress in the same way as the Orange Card had been used last
century by the Conservatives to frustrate the introduction of Home Rule in
Ireland.
While the Bruton/Major deal has not been directly brokered by President
Clinton, undoubtedly it will have his imprint on the fine text.

MOTORISTS are the Budget's biggest victims, with 19p extra on a gallon of
petrol and Scotland's rural drivers paying even more, the AA said last night.
Highlands and Islands Enterprise added to the warnings about how rural
communities would be affected, claiming that Budget tax cuts for small
businesses in the North of Scotland could be offset by increases in fuel prices.
While reductions in tax for small businesses, which comprise 90% of companies
in the area, were welcome, increased duties on petrol and diesel were likely to
push up transport costs.
HIE's senior economist, Tracey Slaven, said: ``The decision to cap increases in
business rates, and to reduce corporation tax for small businesses, will
undoubtedly help the majority of companies in the Highlands and Islands area.
We look forward to seeing the details of the Chancellor's plans.
``However, many firms depend on long-distance road transport for importing raw
materials and exporting finished goods, while the area's #500m-a-year tourism
industry relies heavily on car-borne visitors. The increase on diesel and
petrol of 3.5p per litre could do much to strip businesses of the other
benefits announced, as fuel costs are already disproportionately higher in our
area.''
The Scottish Licensed Trade Association said: ``We are appalled at the savage
increase in the cost of petrol and diesel. This really does affect Scotland and
can have a devastating result on tourism, and to residents and visitors in our
more rural areas.''
The Chancellor's increases in motoring costs are likely to cost the motorist
who does about 8000 miles a year an additional #55 per annum. A sales
representative doing 50,000 miles will have to find an extra #265.
Mr Neil Greig, the AA's road and environment officer in Scotland, said: ``We
have seen petrol duty rise by more than a third in the last three years. This
has a huge effect on rural Scotland, because motorists do not benefit from the
competition between petrol retailers in the Central Belt - and with lack of
public transport many have no alternative but to use their cars.''
Environmentalists claimed the Chancellor's measures - car road tax up #5 to
#140; petrol and diesel up 3.5p a litre; super unleaded petrol up a further 4p
a litre from next May; and all cars and motorcycles over 25 years old exempted
from road tax - lacked imagination and would do little if anything to help
transport related environmental problems.
Mr Greig said on behalf of the AA in Scotland: ``These measures will make no
difference to the environment. Our surveys have shown that people will continue
to drive, no matter how much petrol costs. We were looking for incentives to
use smaller cars.''
He added that the higher duty on super unleaded petrol, reflecting concerns
about benzine, would have little effect as most new vehicles used normal
unleaded fuel.
Dr Richard Dixon, head of research for Friends of the Earth Scotland, said:
``We welcome the increased duty on super unleaded petrol, but it is not enough.
It should have been banned straight away. Even motoring organisations say there
is no real benefit in using it.''
He said the increase in duty was giving the right message to the motorist, but
it was not being done in the right way.
``While the cost in motoring has to be increased to reflect the costs to
society, rural populations do not have any buses or trains. Therefore we do not
think this is the right way to change transport policy,'' he said.
He added that, while it was argued that cars and motorcycles over 25 years old
had to be well maintained or they simply would not go, nevertheless such
vehicles were fuel inefficient and heavy polluters.
``We would not be calling for them to be banned from the road, but exempting
them from road tax does encourage people to operate vehicles that may be more
polluting than modern vehicles,'' he said.
Despite the rises, Mr Clarke said petrol prices in the UK ``should remain lower
than in any major European country''.
However, Mr Adam Wurf, speaking on behalf of the Freight Transport Association,
said that Britain had the highest fuel duty and VAT in Europe.
He added that the 3.5p per litre rise in diesel would add #400m to the cost of
UK industry, and would add #1400 per annum to the fuel bill of heavy goods
vehicles. However, he welcomed the Chancellor's decision to freeze the tax disc
rate for lorries for the sixth successive year.
This recognised the direct contribution already being made by the freight
industry to reducing damage to the environment, particularly in the area of
diesel technology. The freight industry was also far closer to using
alternative-powered vehicles than the car industry, he added.
Both Tesco and Sainsbury's said they would freeze their petrol prices until
next Monday. Tesco unleaded is currently 223p a gallon (49.08p a litre) while
Sainsbury's is 226.8p a gallon (49.9p a litre).
The increase in fuel duty was described as ``a typically knee-jerk reaction''
by the Road Haulage Association.
``It seems every time the Government runs out of ideas they tax road
transport,'' said Mr Wylie Cunningham, regional director of the Road Haulage
Association.
``Today's increase will put almost #540m on to the annual costs of the road
haulage industry in the UK. That is a price which every factory, every shop,
and every consumer in the country will have to pay.''

DESPITE Mr Kenneth Clarke's efforts yesterday, the Tories are facing the stark
reality of the need for another Budget next year to enhance their chances in
the coming General Election.
The Chancellor took a cautious step towards political recovery but the dramatic
stride to avoid General Election defeat was missing.
The average family should be #9 a week better off next year: this is only
halfway towards wiping out its losses since Mr Major's 1992 victory.
Labour leader Tony Blair at once spotted this political weakness in the
Chancellor's Budget measures as the Tory Commons majority falls and Mr Major's
reliance on the Ulster Unionists to keep him in power for another year
increases.
Mr Clarke called his Budget ``prudent'' and he expects it to find favour
amongst some wavering Tory voters and the City. He hopes interest rates can be
cut again but Government borrowing is still standing at #22bn. He could do
nothing ``affordable'' to help the crucial housing market.
Mr Blair declared: ``This is not a Budget - it's a wish list. It is long into
the future, long after they've gone of course.'' The Chancellor, he said, was
giving with one hand and taking away with another.
Public spending has been cut by #3250m next year, equivalent to the amount that
is to be cut in taxes. Right-wing Tories wanted much bigger cuts in spending
and taxation but the majority at the Commons believed the Chancellor had found
the correct balance in the circumstances.
All departments have been obliged to make savings to provide impressive
increases in priority spending. The NHS is to get another #1300m. Schools will
benefit by #878m extra. Police forces get another #20m plus 5000 officers and
10,000 closed-circuit TV cameras.
The Chancellor declared: ``We are going to leave our children a welfare state
that works and one that we can afford.''
Social security looks like taking the biggest cuts in housing benefit and
single parent allowances. Mr Clarke predicted that the social security budget
of #97bn would be reduced by #5000m each year to the end of the century.
He is placing great faith in the Government's Private Finance Initiative, which
he hopes will bring #2000m a year of private investment into State ventures
like roads, hospitals, and prisons.
Mr Blair mocked this target because so far the PFI has brought in only around
#500m.
If the scheme works, there will be a bigger switch from state spending and
borrowing into tax reduction.
The Chancellor described what he called three steps towards his target of a 20p
basic rate. Yesterday, he cut it by 1p to 24p, widened the existing 20p band by
#700 to #3700, and cut taxation on savings income to 20p in the #. He also
raised personal allowances and indexed to inflation married couples allowance
and age related income limits.
He reduced the tax rates of 18 million people. A quarter of all taxpayers will
be on the 20% rate and nearly a quarter of a million are taken out of income
tax altogether.
Employers also benefit with a #500m cut in national insurance contributions;
small businesses will pay 1p less (24p) in corporation tax and they are to get
more help on their rates bills.
The Chancellor has also targeted family savings for help with the inheritance
tax threshold increased by #50,000 to #200,000.
The elderly get increased assistance with the cost of long-term care. Mortgage
protection and long-term insurance benefits are to be exempt from tax.
To help pay for all this, customs duties are increased on strong cider,
cigarettes, petrol and diesel, and road tax. Scotch whisky has about 27p cut
from a bottle and he has helped the pools, horse and dog racing by cuts in the
betting levy. Duty on lorries remains the same.
All this made the Tory back benchers feel a little better but they were still
cautious about their General Election chances if the Government does not get
the chance to produce another Budget next autumn.
Some right wingers felt that the Chancellor should have made at least a 2p cut
in the standard rate of tax to have a political effect. Others felt he was
constrained by the Government's borrowing figures, which are still #10bn more
than they were hoping for.
The Budget pleased Essex MP Gerry Hayes, with only a 3000 majority. He said:
``The theme of this Budget is `who cares wins' and I think the Chancellor has
done a lot of good things for my constituents who have been wavering in their
support.''
Ministers believe that the Budget will give them no immediate turn around in
the opinion polls until next spring. One said: ``Public borrowing is on a
downward path to sustain the economic recovery. People are going to keep more
of what they earn and save, and a whole lot more is going to be spent on the
public services that people care about.''
Business leaders welcomed Mr Clarke's decision not to bow to political pressure
for swingeing tax cuts.
Mr Adair Turner, director-general of the CBI, said Mr Clarke had produced a
Budget that stuck to a prudent economic line.
``Overall, caution won the day and we should welcome that,'' Mr Turner told the
annual dinner of the Building Employers' Confederation in London.
However, Mr John Prescott, deputy leader of the Labour Party said: ``The
Government are simply incapable of telling the truth about their own tax plans.
Senior Ministers keep deliberately giving the impression that as a result of
this Budget the typical family will be #9 a week better off.
``That is rubbish and the Tories know it. The tax changes will make a
difference of less than #4 a week. The rest comes from rises in earnings which
have nothing to do with the Budget. And this still means that the typical
family will be #670 a year worse off than they were in 1992, because of Tory
tax increases.
``That is the truth about this Government's tax policies.''
This Budget was a fiscal package for survival but Mr Major could lose his
majority through defections and by-elections. Mr Blair is clearly out to get
him before he can produce an election-winning Budget.
Calum MacDonald writes: The Chancellor's Budget tipple was the Speyside malt,
Glenfarclas.
His choice echoed that of a predecessor, Mr Norman Lamont, who also sipped the
malt while delivering a Budget speech.
Distillery production manager, Mr John Miller, welcomed the tax cut, but added:
``We would like a bit more to be honest. But every little helps.
``I knew that Mr Clarke drank it but I wasn't aware that Mr Lamont did too.''
Mr Miller said the distillery, which lies between Elgin and Grantown-on-Spey,
employs about 20 people.
Mr Clarke visited the distillery last year.

As a nation of shopkeepers, the British will try to sell anything. Lorn
Macintyre has a lingering dinner with the successful shopkeeper who hopes to
put a bit of naughtiness into the nation's bedrooms
THIS middle-aged interviewer may seem to be on an enviable assignment, dining
with a petite, attractive lady in a hotel on Edinburgh's Princes Street on an
atmospheric evening where the waiters move about like ghosts. Before the entree
arrives she tells me that she would love to open a shop on Princes Street. The
name above the door would be Ann Summers, and beyond the lingerie display sex
aids would be on sale.
I am having a tte-a-tte with Jacqueline Gold. When I agreed to interview her
about her autobiography Good Vibrations (Pavilion, #14.99) I did not know her
name, or that of Ann Summers. It is never too late to learn, and I tell her
that I enjoyed her candid story.
But how am I going to put the questions? I needn't worry: Jacqueline is a good
talker with no inhibitions about the achievements of the dynastic Golds.
After the Second World War her grandparents bought up the books and magazines
used as ballast in container ships from America.
Her father (an East End bricklayer) and uncle created a lucrative publishing
company of top shelf girlie magazines, and acquired Britain's first sex
supermarket in 1971, building up a successful chain of a dozen sex shops based
on the Ann Summers name.
As a teenager Jacqueline started off creating word puzzles for cash, and
selling bric-a-brac on a Kent market stall. ``I went into the family business
in 1979 when I was 19. Initially I had no intention of staying because it was a
very male oriented business. I attended a Tupperware-style party in Essex by
accident.
``Afterwards the women who were there said to me: why doesn't Ann Summers do
parties? Women want to buy sexy underwear and sex aids, but we're too
embarrassed to go into a sex shop. I had also been in a sex shop and could
totally relate to what they were saying.''
Ann Summers Party Plan, Jacqueline's clever scheme for selling to women at
home, started in 1981. ``When women initially come to our parties, they're not
necessarily coming to buy sex aids. They're coming out of curiosity. They'll
buy the underwear and have a good laugh.
``They'll come to another party a few months later, and perhaps get a little
bit more adventurous. They might buy a small vibrator. As time goes on they
seem to become more and more experimental. We now sell 300,000 vibrators a year
to women.''
I take advantage of a rise in conversation level at a nearby table to put a
male-oriented question. Why do women need sex aids? Jacqueline preserves eye
contact. ``A few people may assume that it's because the relationship is
failing. I don't think it's that at all. In the main the majority of women who
buy these aids are already in relationships. Women are much more comfortable
than they used to be about talking to their partners about what they want from
a relationship.
``It's the fact that they are experimenting; it's very much a sharing
experience. They're being more adventurous than perhaps they used to be.''
But surely men get angry if they discover that their wives and partners have
bought such aids? ``In the main men are excited when they learn that their wife
or partner is going to a Party Plan. I hear stories all the time of men saying:
`here darling, here's an open cheque book'. They'll even look through the
catalogue beforehand together and choose what she's going to get.''
I am grateful for the arrival of the starter, but Jacqueline is not embarrassed
by the turn our conversation is taking. ``I know exactly what you're saying
about some men getting angry. When we opened our Southampton shop last year I
heard an argument going on outside. The wife was saying: `Oh, it's Ann Summers;
look after the pram while I go in'. He frog-marched her down the road, saying:
`It's the real thing or nothing at all'.''
Jacqueline recruited more than 1000 sales women in the first year, and, a
decade later, 7500 sales women organise parties for two million women, bringing
a gross annual turnover of around #40 million.
There are also the Ann Summers shops. Do men go into them, perhaps looking for
gifts for loved ones? ``I think a man would feel embarrassed. If you go into a
shop and look at the body language, there are more men who look uncomfortable
than there are women. That's because with women getting together to talk about
sexual issues, it's much more light-hearted.''
The main course has arrived under shining covers, but I have to ask her if
being in the sex industry causes her shame. ``You apply the same business
principles as you would if you were in catering or manufacturing. This is one
reason I wrote my book. I wanted the company to become much more professional
and improve its image. We have our own customer care department, our own
quality care department. It's just like any other business.''
There are now eight Ann Summers shops, including the three opened this year.
But on this November night in Edinburgh, as she toys with her steak after the
long promotional day, she tells me: ``I would love to have a shop up here but
it's finding the right site.''
I am thinking: when I write in The Herald of the possibility of Ann Summers
shops on Princes Street or on Glasgow's Sauchiehall Street, there will be
appalled letters. If the douce citizens of the capital get steamed up over
saunas, how are they going to react to vibrators on the pride and joy of
Princes Street?
Jacqueline is honest but determined: ``We get opposition from time to time. You
might get the odd councillor who isn't happy, but as yet that hasn't stopped us
from opening any shops. The more shops we successfully open, the more people
will get to realise that there is nothing to worry about.
``People have this idea of Ann Summers. I remember getting a taxi to our head
office in Surrey a few years ago. The driver said: `You're not going in there,
are you?' I said: `Why, what's the problem?' He said: `You know what goes on in
there'. I always say to people: please go along to one of the shops; please go
to a party; please look in the catalogue.''
One day Jacqueline Gold will become chairwoman of her family's #150 million
empire. She is divorced, has no children, and, from what I can see in the
discreetly lit dining-room, does not overindulge in either wine or food. What
drives her? ``Throughout my career my motivation has changed. When I was very
young it was very much money. I wanted to be financially independent. Now it's
achievement and success; the success of products I'm involved in, and also
seeing the success of other people around me involved in the business.''
Aren't the mid-thirties too tender an age to write one's autobiography? ``If
I'm honest, the real reason I wrote it was the preconceived ideas and
prejudices. I've been portrayed as a sex queen.
``I laugh a lot of it off now. I don't see myself like that. Also, there are
lots of funny stories in the book, like the talking vibrator.''
Does it speak English, I ask? ``Its vocabulary isn't particularly advanced;
it's lots of oohs and aahs.''
As I savour my main course Jacqueline has more stories. ``I was talking to a
chap who told me he had bought his girlfriend a vibrator. They call it Colin.
He says: `We can talk about Colin in public and nobody knows who we're talking
about. We'll often say: we must tell Colin about that'.''
No, she couldn't retire and live on her fortune because she has too much still
to do for Ann Summers. Is she proving herself to her father? ``I've already
proved myself.'' So what is the next strategy?
``I'm already in Germany, Denmark and Holland, so expanding further into Europe
is on the cards. I suppose what excites me most are the States. I went over
there last year and met with a couple of other direct selling companies. The
potential over there is huge because we won't have the language problem over
there that we have in the other countries. I get a buzz from the business being
successful and trying new things.''
Has Ann Summers in the guise of Jacqueline Gold helped to liberate the British
people sexually, I ask after a superb meal, and an altogether enlightening
evening? ``I don't know if that's quite the right expression. I certainly think
that Ann Summers has contributed greatly to giving women the opportunity to buy
and to take control of what they want, rather than what their partners want. We
all know, don't we, that what men think is sexy, and what women think is sexy,
are different.''
I have no further questions.

THE meeting last night between Mr John Major and Irish Premier John Bruton was
a last-ditch effort to restart the stalled Anglo-Irish peace talks before
President Clinton arrives in London for a three-day visit.
The key issue behind the stalemate has been the British Government's insistence
on the IRA beginning to decommission weapons.
November 3: Northern Ireland Minister Michael Ancram rejects demands for
all-party talks from Sinn Fein and says decommissioning must come before the
party can join peace talks.
November 8: Mr John Hume, leader of the SDLP, urges Mr Major to respond to
proposals for a summit by November 30. Unionists say they will not be forced
into talks ahead of IRA disarmament. Mr Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein demands that
preconditions over arms should be dropped.
November 10: Leaders of Republican Sinn Fein, the hard-line breakaway group,
denies it is behind a 1000lb bomb found near the Irish border. They say the
ceasefire is a betrayal which would fail.
November 11: A speech by Mr Bruton to the Meath Association of London causes
``anger and dismay'' when he calls for talks without the IRA giving up its
weapons. Government spokesmen say: ``This is an extraordinary speech, at an
extraordinary time, the eve of Remembrance Sunday and delivered in Britain
through a megaphone.''
November 13: It is announced that Mr Major and Mr Bruton will speak on the
telephone in a bid to heal the rift.
November 14: The White House considers whether to cancel President Clinton's
visit. Mr Clinton says he will not go to Belfast ``just to turn on the
Christmas tree lights''.
November 17: New proposals for talks allowing Sinn Fein to take part are
revealed in London. They include an early target date for discussions to begin
and acknowledgement that Sinn Fein could raise as evidence to a disarmament
commission its views on the British Army and RUC. The need for decommissioning
would not be part of the commission's remit.
November 19: Mr Martin McGuinness of Sinn Fein says on radio there is ``no
possibility'' of any IRA weapons being handed over before Sinn Fein is admitted
to talks.
November 18: Mr Major offers new deal leading to speculation that he and Mr
Bruton will meet to set up an international commission on IRA weapons and a New
Year date for all-party talks.
November 20: Mr David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionists, rules out talks
with Sinn Fein, saying Mr McGuinness and Mr Adams ``not fit'' to sit at the
negotiating table.
November 21: Phone call diplomacy between London and Dublin fails to bring a
deal to put the process back on track.
November 24: The IRA tells its members to prepare for a ``return to war'' if
London and Dublin fail to break the deadlock.
November 26: Efforts to arrange a summit are abandoned amid accusations that
Dublin is advocating a ``Sinn Fein prospectus''.

THE spontaneous strike action taken by postal workers across Scotland last week
was an outburst of underlying anger at the manner in which management has
undertaken the task of rationalisation over the last five years.
In Royal Mail's rationalisation programme we can see in microcosm the vast
changes in working practices our society has undergone since the early eighties.
These changes and the underlying tensions they have created are one of the
major challenges facing Tony Blair's industrial policy makers, if he wins the
next election.
The tiny Edinburgh office at Portobello, the strike's epicentre from where the
shockwaves spread out across the country, is representative of the situation
throughout Royal Mail. The trend has been towards casualisation, increased use
of part-time staff, and heavier workloads, changes implemented with glee by
over-zealous and in many cases over-young management.
At Portobello out of 28 full-time positions four second deliveries have been
rationalised, to use Royal Mail terminology, or to speak more plainly four
full-time jobs have been cut.
Hamilton is currently undertaking official strike action against similar cuts.
Every delivery office across the land has been visited by this attack on
full-time jobs which explains the swiftness of the secondary action and the
deep anger of the strikers.
Alex Gibb has justified Royal Mail management's attack on full-time jobs by
stating: ``Almost 90% of the mail is now available to go in the first delivery
whereas previously it was 60%. The impact on second delivery is that we have
less mail. We have no intention of getting rid of the second delivery but it is
the number of people available to make that second delivery.''
Increased automation and more efficient utilisation of transport have made this
possible. Yet Alex Gibb is speaking the cold, calculating language of the
private sector of the mid-1990s.
Royal Mail as a business made a profit of #1500m last year and from its own
figures 98% of first-class items make it for delivery the following day. Just
how much more efficient can Royal Mail become?
Once again the arguments used during the campaign against privatisation must be
reiterated. The Post Office is not and should not be simply a machine for
making money: it is a public utility set up to provide a service to and jobs
for people in the wider community.
An uneasy peace has broken out with many postal workers returning to work in
order to maintain this high-quality service to the public over the Christmas
period. However, the day of reckoning may only be postponed until the new year.
The Post Office is determined to cut staffing levels on the second delivery
which must logically lead to redundancies.
If Royal Mail persists with this policy it is difficult to imagine how a
protracted industrial dispute can be avoided. Such a dispute has far wider
implications and will be seen by many as an acid test for Tony Blair and New
Labour's commitment to those on a low income.
Support for a wholly legal campaign against job cuts in Royal Mail at a future
date by Tony Blair would go a long way to reassure that other electorate out
there who do not hail from middle England, and whose overriding concern is not
tax cuts.

A 12-YEAR-OLD boy was found guilty yesterday of stealing more than #4600 from a
filling station.
The boy, who was 11 at the time of the offence, has already been referred to
the Reporter to the Children's Panel in Dundee 120 times, Aberdeen Sheriff
Court was told.
The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, fidgeted with a packet of
sweets as the sheriff found him guilty.
He had denied stealing #4657 from the Cocket Hat (South) filling station,
Aberdeen, on Friday, January 13, this year. The money was not recovered.
Workers at the garage noticed the cash missing from an office safe shortly
after a member of staff found the boy trying to leave via a fire escape, the
court had heard.
When one of the staff went to the forecourt and asked his mother to go back
inside because of a problem, the boy ran away.
He was being taken to a Children's Panel hearing in Dundee and had tried to run
away earlier that day, the court was told.
The boy told the court yesterday that he was trying to escape from his mother
to avoid going to the hearing, and took his chance when they stopped at the
garage so she could buy cigarettes.
He denied going into the office and taking the cash, or telling staff that he
was looking for a toilet.
The boy added: ``It was Black Friday that day and I thought I was going to get
put away by the panel. That's why I wanted to escape.''
After running from the filling station, he went to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary,
where he took a taxi to the railway station and, he said, boarded a train to
Dundee, avoiding buying a ticket by hiding in a toilet.
In Dundee, the boy said, he had met friends and played on a moped - ridden by a
12-year-old friend - before police caught him later that night.
Sheriff Alexander Pollock found that the boy stole the money and adjourned the
hearing until December 12 so that reports could be prepared.

``IT is not difficult,'' remarked P G Wodehouse, ``to tell the difference
between a ray of sunshine and a Scot with a grievance.'' Michael Forsyth may be
reflecting on these wise, if somewhat condescending, words as he prepares for
the constitutional shootout on St Andrew's Day.
One big problem is the extent of Tory pre-match hype, particularly from the
Prime Minister in his interview of last week. Scotland, on the basis of the
words from No 10, should be fastening its seatbelts and preparing for lift off.
If then all oor Michael has to offer is a sooped-up Grand Committee and a
bigger quango to ``advise'' him on matters of state then a lot of people are
going to be more than a little disappointed. His reported remark at a lobby
briefing last week, ``it is the best I can do'', sounds almost plaintive as if
he already expects Scotland to greet his proposals as a damp squib rather than
constitutional fireworks - not so much ``taking stock'' as ``laughing stock''.
This is the difficulty of course with being dragged on to the ground of your
political opponents. Over the past six months Michael has been enjoying himself
poking fun at Labour's devolution scheme, particularly the Aunt Sally 3p
variation in the basic rate of income tax.
This, incidentally, is a proposal so foolish that conspiracy theorists might
believe that the less enthusiastic in the Convention deliberately planted it
there with the precise purpose of giving the Scottish Secretary a target to hit.
Michael has also been relishing the opportunity to raise one bloodcurdling
piece of scaremongering after another. To listen to the Scottish Office team,
constitutional change in Scotland would lead to the end of civilisation as we
know it. What they actually are concerned about is that it would lead to the
end of the Scottish Office team as we know them.
That is the luxury of negative campaigning. It also has limitations.
Scaremongering is the easiest card to play in politics, however it seldom takes
a trick on its own.
Despite saturation coverage for his anti-devolution and independence views,
Tory support remains stubbornly anchored in the depths of Scottish politics.
People may see a lot of Michael. A few might even believe him but next to
nobody is going to like him.
The solution, therefore, is to have something positive to say and that brings
us to the big St Andrew's Day announcement. The difficulty is that as soon as
something is put forward it can be dissected by the other parties. From
negative campaigning on the front foot the Scottish Secretary might soon find
himself campaigning positively on the back foot.
Certainly if he launches the good ship ``real devolution'' on Thursday with the
proposals that have been ventilated thus far it will soon be renamed ``no real
change''. His first problem then is on how to spring a surprise to avoid being
sunk by general public derision before he even gets the boat down the slipway.
Given the extent of the leaks and the weakness of his proposals he is in a
pretty tight corner.
One possibility which presents itself is to offer a constitutional referendum
on the various proposals which are being put forward.
It would certainly be a gambler's move but it is not as unlikely as it first
might seem. It would wrongfoot Labour who adopted a policy of favouring a
multi-option referendum after the last election but do not propose to have one
on their own devolution proposals.
It would bring the Scottish position broadly into line with Northern Ireland
where, since the Downing Street declaration, the Prime Minister has accepted
that any constitutional settlement must be tested by referendum. There is a
downside, however, as there is with most pieces of political chicanery. It
would make an explicit recognition of Scottish sovereignty and the problem with
expressions of the popular will is that it might come up with an inconvenient
answer. It would also immediately revive memories of how the last referendum
was rigged by the 40% rule.
Worst of all, however, is that if a vote was offered only after the next
election it would be vulnerable to the immediate and obvious question, ``Why
not test opinion right now?''
And to that question there is only one real answer. The Scottish Secretary is
engaged in an exercise of trying both to survive politically and to protect
Westminster control of Scotland for as long as it is possible.
Prolonged pressure has brought him to the top of the slippery slope to change.
He is likely to delay his trip down it to the last possible minute even if that
procrastination makes the journey all the more certain.

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth has redrawn the rules covering capital
spending and council debt for the new single-tier councils.
He made it clear yesterday when giving details of the local government
settlement for next year that they would be expected to rely much more on
involving the private sector to meet local needs.
Mr Forsyth spelled out the thinking behind the changes. ``The outgoing councils
have in general been able to pursue the outdated philosophy that, where the
needs exist, they must be met by direct public investment,'' he said
``The Government's approach, reflected in the Private Finance Initiative, is
that the public sector should increasingly focus on specifying the services its
customers need and look to others to incur the necessary investment.''
Mr Forsyth also announced that he would retain his powers to cap local
authority spending, despite his general desire to reduce controls on local
government.
Effectively, he blamed the behaviour of Scottish councils for his decision to
keep the capping controls. It had been made, he said, against a background of
increased council spending, growing council manpower, and rising council tax
bills.
He repeatedly contrasted the higher levels of spending by Scottish councils
with those of their counterparts in England.
On council grant, the Scottish Secretary said he had improved on last year's
plans by #106m. Government support for council spending would total #5400m and
he had allocated Scottish councils the full formula consequences of the English
settlement.
Scottish councils, he claimed, were being treated ``very favourably'' and there
was no need for cuts in front-line services or excessive council tax increases,
especially if the new councils took the chance to streamline their management
structures and took a fresh approach to the way services were delivered.
However, Convention of Scottish Local Authority leaders disagreed totally, and
warned of council tax rises and the need for ``savage'' cuts in services to
stay within the new capping limits.
The Scottish Secretary said it was necessary to take steps to control the
escalating level of Scottish local authority debt which, on general services,
had risen by 65% since 1987. Housing debt had risen by 57% over the same period
and he said that paying the loan charges meant using up more and more money
which should be available for spending on services.
Under the new rules next year, councils will have to use 25% of their capital
receipts from house and land sales to repay their capital debt. That figure
will rise to 50% for 1997-98.
Mr Forsyth said he recognised that his decision would curtail councils' ability
to incur capital expenditure at their own hand but he said that, by engaging in
joint ventures with the private sector under the PFI, the councils should be
able to attract private investment on a scale ``which would more than offset
the effects of his decision''.
The unitary councils will also face severe new restrictions on the amount of
current revenue they can spend on capital projects.
Mr Forsyth said this action would protect council taxpayers. Capital funded
from revenue involved the use of council tax money and the new curbs would
reduce the average council tax bill by #41 as compared with this year.
Councils had planned to spend #132m on Capital Funded from Current Revenue this
year. This had added #79 to the average council tax, claimed Mr Forsyth. Next
year, such spending will be limited to just #62m.
Cosla's Labour president Councillor Rosemary McKenna said the settlement meant
greater control of local government finances by central Government at a time
when we had a Scottish Secretary who claimed to want to devolve more powers to
local authorities.
More control was being exerted by the requirement on councils to use a quarter
of their capital receipts from the sale of assets to pay off loan debt rather
than invest in much-needed community facilities.
Scottish Liberal Democrat local government spokeswoman Ray Michie MP said the
new regulations on capital receipts would mean that the #500m backlog in school
building repairs in Scotland would only get worse.
Announcing the settlement in a series of Parliamentary written answers, Mr
Forsyth said Grant Aided Expenditure - the amount the Government thinks
councils need to spend on services and debt charges - was 1.75% higher than in
the current year after adjusting for transfers of responsibility. Aggregate
External Finance - councils' total income from grant and business rates - would
rise by 2.62%.
Cosla said the settlement went nowhere near meeting the 3.2% rate of inflation
nor the fact that councils would have to find more than #200m of additional
spending for Government initiatives.
Labour's Scottish Local Government spokesman John McAllion MP said the new
capping regime would force deep cuts in council services as well as impose
council tax increases.
He said the settlement confirmed the continuing centralisation of decision
making away from local government. Michael Forsyth had effectively decided the
level of local services and taxes across Scotland.

DOUGAL PERMAN talks to the volunteers preparing for a cold night on the
Edinburgh streets
Former Housing Minister Lord James Douglas Hamilton maintains: ``There isn't a
housing problem in Scotland.'' If not, why are 100 people bedding down outside
St Andrew's and St George's church in Edinburgh on Friday.
Homeless charity the Rock Trust recognised that there is a problem and is
encouraging as many people as possible to abandon their beds in favour of cold
concrete as part of the seventh national sleep out for the 110,000 Shelter
estimates are homeless in Scotland.
This is the third sleep out organised for the ecumenical Christian charity, the
Rock Trust by Communications worker Ruth Innes who sees it as a ``great
opportunity for us to raise not only the Rock Trust's profile but the public's
awareness of the homelessness problem''.
Innes got in touch with the National Trust for the Homeless three years ago and
90 people slept out to raise #7000. Last year 70 people raised #4000. This year
the target is #10,000 to be shared between the Homeless Outreach project, the
Grassmarket Advice Centre, and the Rock Trust's Stepping Stones.
Apart from funds raised through sponsorship from the sleep out or the light
option of paying #15 to sleep in your own bed, Innes contacts previous
supporters and urges them to give help and money.
The Trust divides its cash between three ventures. Bedrock takes young people
from emergency hostels like Edinburgh's Stopover hostel and houses them with
three or four others and a supportive flatmate who helps them shop, budget and
pay the rent.
From there the young people move on the Stepping Stones project which also
takes young homeless people from other organisations like Barnardo's and
Bethany. ``One girl was a Big Issue seller who felt she couldn't quite manage
on her own and wanted to go to college,'' says Innes. Stepping Stones pays her
bills and allowance so she can go to college.
Edinburgh District Council gave the trust three Stepping Stones houses, and
they have bought two themselves. Each house and a flat has to be renovated and
decorated by volunteers. Stepping Stones has four flats providing six spaces
and the trust are about to buy two more flats.
The third stage is the Keystone project, befriending young people on their own
for the first time.
Part of helping these people is raising awareness. Many people do not know what
it is like to be 16 or 17 and out in the cold. They can't get benefits or help
with housing without disclosing very personal information; 70% are abused.
Even when all their housing spaces are full, the trust continues interviewing
applicants so that when spaces are available they can help. Each applicant has
to be assessed by the Community Care department. The homeless have to prove
they are vulnerable.
Lothian Regional Council is good at recognising the problem. Perhaps because of
the scale of the problem in Edinburgh or perhaps because of the awareness
raised by homeless charities. Officially Edinburgh's housing applications stand
at 3500. Shelter estimates it at three or four times that because of family and
group applications and many single people do not apply.
Lord Douglas Hamilton, who was contacted by the Rock Trust to ask for his
support last year, may not see the problem evident on every High Street in the
country but the same is not true for all.
Ruth Innes calls on everyone to volunteer their support. ``I'm not very popular
at this time of year,'' she laughs. This year, however, all eight of the
Edinburgh office staff are sleeping out.
Last year while fund-raisers bedded down outside, the minister of St Andrew's
and St George's church allowed several homeless people who turned up to see
what was going on to sleep in the church's undercroft. The Carlton Highland
Hotel sent down a huge spread of sandwiches for the sleepers.
The Rock Trust operates on care and compassion which is why 100 people will be
on George Street on Friday doing more than just losing sleep over the
homelessness problem.

THE Scottish Office faces a sharp reduction in its annual budget over the next
three years as its share of an overall cut in Government spending, according to
expenditure plans announced yesterday.
Mr Forsyth chose to stress a #173m cash-terms increase in next year's total
allocation as ``the highest ever'', and claimed it was a far better settlement
than pre-Budget rumours had indicated.
``I am delighted with the outcome of this year's public expenditure
negotiations in what was rightly billed as the toughest expenditure round for
years,'' he said.
However, figures show Mr Forsyth has had to accept a #329m cut in real terms to
his budget next year and faces cuts rising to 5% in the financial year
1998-1999.
Scottish Office spending will fall by #329m in real terms next year from
#14,048m (in last year's prices) to #13,719m. The cuts will continue, bringing
the department's predicted spending in 1998-99 to #13,318m - #730m less than
this year.
Despite claiming to have done better than his critics had predicted, Mr Forsyth
denied suggestions that Scotland's Budget settlement was politically motivated.
``I don't set out to bail out the Tories' fortunes when dealing with the
nation's finances,'' he said.
He had successfully defended the Barnett formula, which guarantees Scotland an
enhanced, fixed share of spending in England and Wales. Scotland had come out
``around the middle'' in the list of Government departments facing cuts.
The Budget was ``prudent and sensible'' and went ``far beyond what had been
expected in Scotland'', he said, adding: ``The Chancellor has done what's right
for the country. We'll give him credit not to succumb to any politically driven
pressures.''
Announcement of the cuts was offset by the Scottish Office coming third among
Government departments taking on the Private Finance Initiative to transfer
capital spending to the private sector.
Mr Forsyth said Scottish Office spending will be supplemented by investment,
under the PFI, of #930m over the next three years.

THE Secretary of State for Scotland is reported as saying that he has set
himself the test ``to find ways of improving the accountability of the
Government and give Scots more say in their own affairs and decision-making''.
The test I will use in assessing his proposals is whether he has removed the
situation in which he can block a piece of legislation which exists for England
and Wales from being introduced in Scotland even though the vast majority of
the Scottish people have been shown by opinion polls to want it.
The particular piece of legislation I have in mind is that enabling National
Parks in England and Wales and they have been described in Government papers on
the environment as ``jewels in the crown''.
Although in 1949 five Scottish areas were designated ``National Park Direction
Areas'' no progress has been made, despite the recommendations in 1990 of the
Countryside Commission for Scotland (then the Government's advisory body in
such matters) that four areas in Scotland be designated National Parks.
When 1000 people were interviewed by System Three Scotland in 1991, 84% thought
that we should have National Parks in Scotland.
When a local MP whose constituency borders Loch Lomond sought in 1991 to
introduce legislation enabling National Parks to be designated in Scotland, his
proposals were blocked by Ministers who introduced instead a new designation of
Natural Heritage areas.
Perhaps these would be more appropriate to the Scottish situation, but the
failure to make any significant progress in even defining what these should be,
let alone designating any particular area as a National Heritage Area in the
four-and-a-half years which have followed, appears to show the Government's
real motive - to frustrate the wishes of the Scottish people for bodies to be
set up with adequate powers and resources for the management of the most
popular mountain areas of Scotland.
What can possibly be the justification for Scotland to have separate
legislation from the remainder of the UK when it is used by the Government in
Westminster to deny the Scottish people a facility they want and which has been
enjoyed by the people of England and Wales for 46 years?

<TEXT>
A PRISON nurse who examined a teenager hours before she hanged herself in her
cell said yesterday that he blamed himself for her death.
Mr William Rock, 46, told the Corton Vale hangings inquiry that Kelly Holland
was ``quiet and apprehensive'' when she arrived at the jail from Hamilton
Sheriff Court on June 22.
Mr Rock, a prison nurse for 22 years, said he did not consider Holland, 17, to
be a suicide risk but he placed her on 15-minute observations for alcohol
withdrawal.
He told procurator-fiscal John Miller, who is conducting the inquiry into the
deaths of Holland and another prisoner, Arlene Elliot, that even with hindsight
he considered his assessment reasonable.
However, he said he would have put Holland on suicide watch in a bare cell if
police had sent a ``special risk'' form to the jail with her.
Mr Miller asked Mr Rock: ``What was your reaction when you heard Kelly had
died?'' He replied: ``I was blaming myself.''
He said that, after the two deaths, he went on a two-week suicide prevention
course but learned nothing that would have made him act differently.
Mr Rock said a psychiatrist had tried to get Elliot, also 17, admitted to a
psychiatric hospital eight weeks before she hanged herself but she was still at
the prison on May 24 when her sentence ended.
Medical notes revealed that on May 2 she was ``very upset, pulling her hair and
hearing voices telling her to hurt herself''.
She was readmitted to Cornton Vale on remand on May 30 and found hanged on June
26, after a prison doctor had taken her off strict suicide supervision.
Earlier, a doctor accused of dismissing Holland as an attention seeker defended
his judgment.
Police surgeon Michael O'Keefe said he examined her in the cells at Hamilton
Sheriff Court on June 7 after she was reported to have to tried to jump out of
an upstairs window in an empty flat.
He said Holland had told him the accusation was ``rubbish'' and ridiculed
suggestions that she might be suicidal.
She told him she had been drinking before the alleged incident in the flat.
Dr O'Keefe said: ``I found that Kelly did not have an acute psychiatric or
psychotic disorder but a personality disorder with addictive traits.''
The inquiry, at Stirling Sheriff Court, continues.

LAST week's decision by the British Dental Association to sanction the
recommendation that newly qualified dental surgeons can assume the title of
``doctor'' cannot go without some form of comment. Indeed, the ballot, in which
95% of dental students voted in favour of this change, could be described as
little more than a farcical exercise at elevating the status of dental
practitioners.
What is particularly perplexing about this decision is that it confers to newly
qualified undergraduates a title which ordinarily has to be earned by
postgraduates after, in many instances, several years of punishingly demanding
research.
For those of us who have completed PhD research, and therefore rightfully
earned the title ``doctor'', it is somewhat insulting, if not insensitive, that
an undergraduate with very limited research experience and almost certainly no
peer-reviewed publications can gain entitlement to use this title.
While one recognises that general practitioners have long assumed the title
``doctor'' it must be made clear that there is a distinction to be drawn here.
Historically, the title ``doctor'' has become synonymous with the general
practitioner and therefore something with which the public can readily
identify. Contrastingly, there are many hospital consultants and surgeons who
prefer to be known as ``Mr''.
Titular elitism is nothing new and owes much to its American roots where every
conceivable medical, para and quasi-medically-qualified person prefixes their
name with ``Dr''.
However, standards must be maintained within tertiary education and
professional organisations should not be able to deem that an undergraduate
qualification confers some immediate right to the title of ``Dr''.
Furthermore, the right to confer the title ``Dr'' is one which universities
receive by virtue of their respective Royal Charters to confer degrees,
diplomas and certificates.

THE Chancellor's latest hike in tobacco prices produced predictable responses
from the respective sides of the smoking divide.
His announcement means a 15p increase on the price of 20 cigarettes, while
cigars rise by 6p and pipe tobacco by 8p. Duty on rolling tobacco was frozen to
deter smugglers.
Doctors said the increases could help to save 2500 lives, although both the
British Medical Association and the British Thoracic Society urged the
Government to go further by banning tobacco adverts and promotion.
Tobacco manufacturers and retailers warned that the tax increases would
encourage criminals to move into cigarette smuggling.
A BMA spokesman said: ``Fifteen pence on a packet of 20 will help doctors in
the battle to persuade smokers to give up and so reduce the 110,000 deaths from
smoking each year.
``Such a rise could save up to 2500 lives in the long run but the Government
must follow through this real commitment with other measures, such as a ban on
tobacco advertising and promotion.''
Professor John Moxham, of the British Thoracic Society, said: ``This is a
welcome step in the fight to cut future lung cancer and chronic lung disease
cases.'' He, too, called for a ban on tobacco adverts.
Ms Pamela Furness, chief executive of Action on Smoking and Health, said:
``This is a good day for public health in the UK.''
The pressure group Quit, which helps smokers to give up the habit, said:
``There is no doubt that the price increase will encourage some people to stop
smoking.''
However, the Tobacco Manufacturers' Association warned of a tide of cigarette
smuggling following the increase.
``UK cigarette duties are already among the highest in Europe and another
punitive increase is the last thing either smokers or the tobacco trade want or
need.''
Mr Paul Mason, national spokesman for the Tobacco Alliance which represents
independent tobacconists, said Mr Clarke had ``given smugglers a Christmas
bonus and retailers a stab in the back''.
Forest, which campaigns for people's freedom to smoke, said the price increases
were ``disappointing'' but not a surprise. Campaigns manager Juliette
Wallbridge said: ``Smokers are constantly being hit.''

Ulster deal breaks
the IRA deadlock
THE deadlock in the Northern Ireland peace process was broken last night, with
Irish Prime Minister John Bruton making a dramatic flight to London.
After a day of intense diplomatic activity and negotiation the British and
Irish Governments settled their differences on how to move towards IRA
disarmament.
The announcement by Mr Major and Mr Bruton of the breakthrough cleared the way
for all-party talks by the end of February.
Mr Bruton flew to Britain for a hastily arranged late night news conference
with Mr Major at Downing Street to unveil their historic agreement to end the
peace logjam.
The deal was struck on the eve of US President Bill Clinton's arrival at
Heathrow this morning for his visit to Britain and Ireland.
Before he left Washington, Mr Clinton hailed the new initiative. ``The United
States is proud to support the peacemakers,'' he said, adding that it ``brings
the people of Northern Ireland one step closer to the day when the only
barriers their children will face are the limits of their dreams.''
He said as the arms issue was being addressed, political talks would be
organised ``in which all parties will be invited to participate.''
Mr Clinton saluted Mr Major and Mr Bruton for their ``vision and courage''. He
said their agreement ``demonstrates that the will for peace is more powerful
than bombs and bullets, and it reminds us once again that with courage and
resolve bitter legacies of conflict can be overcome.''
Mr Major and Mr Bruton agreed to set aside remaining differences in order to
agree the final details of a ``twin-track'' approach to peace.
At the Downing Street conference, Mr Major called on all parties in the
conflict - and Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams in particular - to find the
courage to take risks for peace.
He said: ``No one is being asked to abandon a principle. But if we are to reach
agreement and carry the process further forward everyone will need courage to
take risks in the search for peace. That includes Mr Adams.''
However, he said he would not be prepared to meet Mr Adams until the IRA had
started to hand over their weapons. He said: ``In due course, the time will
come, but it is not here yet.''
Under the agreement, an international body will be established to provide
independent advice on decommissioning arms - rather than overseeing the process.
The creation of the body resolves the main obstacle in the peace process which
had been over decommissioning of IRA arms.
There had been differences between London and Dublin on Britain's insistence
that the IRA must start decommissioning its weapons before Sinn Fein could join
all-party talks.
Mr Major announced that US Senator George Mitchell would chair the body of
three members and said approaches were being made to two other eminent people.
Sitting with Mr Bruton at the news conference in Downing Street's state dining
room, Mr Major declared: ``Reaching this agreement has been neither easy nor
quick.
``In fact it has been an extremely difficult agreement to reach. But for both
of us the most important thing has been to reach the right agreement, an
agreement that in our judgment is going to generate further momentum in the
peace process and help us address some of the difficult issues that lie ahead.
``That, we think, is the way to take us closer to negotiations on a lasting
settlement involving all the political parties.''
Mr Major stressed that both governments had consulted widely over the agreement
and it did not represent the views of any one party.
He said it was founded on principles in the Downing Street Declaration,
unveiled almost two years ago.
``We hope that this agreement we've reached will attract the widest possible
co-operation on the part of everyone who genuinely wishes to consolidate peace
in Northern Ireland,'' he said.
Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams said last night: ``When Sinn Fein is briefed on
the detail of tonight's agreement we will explore this positively as we have
all other propositions to re-establish the peace process.
``We will come to this on the basis of our analysis and integrity.''
Mr Bruton declared: ``What we need now is to move towards political structures
that will give political expression to the feelings of the people, feelings
that are expressed in terms of a yearning for peace, a yearning for
reconciliation and a yearning for a way of life that entrenches mutual
respect.''
He said: ``We are now taking the steps necessary to restore momentum in the
peace process.
``We are setting out on a road which is designed to overcome the difficulties
which have prevented us up to now from setting a date by which we will be
aiming to commence all-party discussions.''
Mr Major warned that although it was 15 months since the IRA ceasefire, there
were still daily episodes of violence and intimidation by paramilitary
organisations.
``We are now approaching a second successful, peaceful Christmas throughout the
whole of Northern Ireland.
``It is beyond question that life in Northern Ireland has been transformed and
that the people of Northern Ireland want both a just and a permanent peace,''
he said.
``This initiative that we are launching this evening is about generating the
confidence that will help us to achieve that lasting peace.
``No one is being asked to abandon a principle. But if we are to reach
agreement and carry this process further forward, everyone will need courage to
take risks in the search for peace and I hope that they will be prepared to do
so.''
The joint communique issued by the two premiers said they had agreed to launch
a ``twin track'' process with the aim of securing all-party talks by the end of
February.
All parties will be invited to intensive preparatory discussions with an open
agenda to reach widespread agreement over the structure, format and agenda for
the talks.
They would also look at whether and how an elected body could play a part, a
key demand of the Ulster Unionists.
The communique also gave details of the proposed new international body which
will provide ``an independent assessment of the decommissioning issue''.
It will be asked to report on the arrangements necessary for the removal of
arms from the political equation.
In particular, the body will be asked to ``identify and advise on a suitable
and acceptable method for full and verifiable decommissioning''.
It would also be asked to ``report on whether there is a clear commitment on
the part of those in possession of such arms to work constructively to achieve
that''.
The body will be asked to submit its report by the middle of January but
neither government is bound to accept its recommendations.
The two governments have agreed to meet again in mid-February to review
progress in the preparatory talks.
If the commission can produce a formula for handing over arms acceptable to the
IRA and loyalist para-militarities, the way could be open to starting all-party
talks on the future of the province although the Unionist parties will want
hard evidence that a substantial amount of IRA weaponry has been collected.
They may also insist that the IRA disclaims any desire to return to violent
methods if the all-party talks do not go its way.
Mr Bruton, deputy Irish premier Dick Spring and their team of advisers left
Dublin's government buildings at about 8.30pm for the London meeting.
They were flying in the Dublin government's executive jet from Baldonnel
military airfield on the outskirts of the Irish capital.
Indications that Mr Major and Mr Bruton might be on the point of agreement
emerged early today from Washington after their governments had appeared to be
drifting apart amid acrimony in the wake of failed weekend negotiations.
The mood was apparently transformed by contact that went on until the early
hours between civil servants from the two governments and with a strong
Washington input.
White House sources said they were increasingly confident of a successful end
to the talks between the two prime ministers.
The key moment was thought to have come when the leaders spoke together on the
telephone about the peace process at lunchtime for the sixth time in a week.
Their conversation lasted almost an hour and made what Dublin officials called
``tremendous progress''.
Mr Major is now likely to join Mr Clinton in Belfast tomorrow, according to
Government sources.
It appeared Mr Major would join the president at a reception in Queen's
University to which the leaders of all Northern Ireland's political parties,
including Mr Adams and the fringe loyalist groups, have been invited.
There was also speculation in the city that Mr Bruton would travel to Belfast
so that the three political leaders could stamp their authority on new moves in
the peace process.
However, there was a warning note last night from Conservative MP David
Wilshire, a member of the Northern Ireland Select Committee and British-Irish
Inter-Parliamentary Body, who described          the agreement as ``a classic
fudge''.
He warned that it might represent a long-term defeat for the British Government
for the sake of a short-term gain.
He predicted that, although the new international commission is intended to
have an advisory role only, the Government might find itself unable to reject
its advice in February.

It's still a buyer's market
And the hills are
alive with Hooray
Henrys once more,
writes Property
Correspondent
Stewart McIntosh
A THREATENED species is making a comeback to the Highlands. Though the property
crash drove the species to the brink of extinction, the wealthy buyer of
Scottish estates and country houses is undergoing a recovery.
The cry of Hooray Henrys and Henriettas, backed by the yap of the yuppie, can
be heard once again in the bens and glens. Strutt &amp; Parker, an agent which
specialises in Highland estates and large east coast farms, has declared that
we are in the midst of ``a tartan property boom''.
However, Jamie Macnab of rival agent Savills says that, although the market is
recovering, it is still ``fickle''.
A particular problem is Scotland's ``sealed bid'' purchase system which is
mistrusted by would-be buyers from other countries. ``Giving all interested
parties one opportunity to make their best offer at a closing date is disliked
and treated with suspicion by the majority of buyers from outside Scotland,''
says Macnab.
As a result, buyers are circumventing the system and few of the large country
houses sold by Savills this year have gone to closing dates. ``Either a buyer
has materialised at the outset of the sale and has made a premium offer to take
the property off the market, or the property has remained on the market for
four or five months before being sold by negotiation,'' says Macnab. ``This has
been to the advantage of buyers who have known where they stood throughout.''
Indeed, buyers have held the clout throughout this year. ``A handful of
particularly desirable properties have changed hands very quickly - either
privately or as soon as they have reached the market - and at very high prices.
But most properties have taken longer to sell than in other years, and prices
have been reasonable but not high. On the whole, it's still a buyer's market.''
This year has seen an odd trend where more country properties were sold outwith
the traditional selling seasons than within them. Scottish country properties
are usually sold at two peak periods - between April and the end of June, and
between mid-August and October. During the summer holidays and the winter
months the market generally goes to ground.
But Savills got off to a flying start at the beginning of this year by selling
a dozen large houses in January and February - traditionally a dormant period.
These included houses snapped up before they could get to the market as well as
some which remained unsold from the autumn of 1994. Around 75% of the sales
went to buyers from outside Scotland - ``and the prices achieved were good''.
In sharp contrast, the main spring selling season from mid-April to July
produced far fewer sales. ``The reaction to quality properties was good in
terms of the number of enquiries from advertisements and the number of
viewers,'' says Macnab, ``but it proved very difficult to achieve deals.''
In two cases Savills had no fewer than five notifications of interest, but
no-one offered at the closing dates. Both houses were subsequently put under
offer after negotiation with individuals. ``But this demonstrates the lack of
genuine confidence on be-half of local buyers,'' says Macnab. His message to
buyers is that there is a good supply of quality country houses on the market -
and they are generally on the market for a longish period, usually four to six
months, before selling.
And his message to sellers is: ``Don't give up hope because houses are selling,
though the time needed to find the right buyer is longer than it used to be.''
Further upmarket, the message is even more upbeat. Strutt &amp; Parker's tartan
property boom is happening ``despite the problems in Lloyds and the threat of
devolution'', says the firm's latest UK market report. There are three types of
buyer interested in purchasing bens and glens . . .
Wealthy people based in the UK who want an estate for sport and privacy;
conservation and environmental groups (in four transactions, conservation
groups purchased a total of 150,000 acres); and foreign purchasers, of whom
Strutt &amp; Parker has several on its books, seeking substantial estates (one
American paid more than the #3m asking price for one of the largest on the
marker).

THE STABLES, SHANDON,
NEAR HELENSBURGH
IF you have a good view, you should make the best of it. When an old stable
block in Shandon, near Helensburgh, was being converted into modern living
accommodation it was decided, for the sake of the viewer, to break the usual
rules of interior layout . . .
The result is that the ground floor consists of three bedrooms, a bathroom and
a sauna - while the whole of the upstairs is taken over by a large lounge and
dining kitchen. Measuring 29 by 17ft, the lounge has a central gas fire and, at
one end, patio doors which open on to a terrace which has sweeping views over
Gare Loch to the Rosneath peninsula.
Both the lounge and the dining kitchen have large French doors which open
directly on to views of the loch. Attic space provides the possibility of
further expansion, although local authority consents would be required.
Built of sandstone, the stable block was redeveloped in 1989 and many of its
original stone features preserved. The house has its own private garden and a
shared courtyard. Slater Hogg &amp; Howison is seeking offers over #139,500.

THE conversion of Glenburn House offers a rare opportunity to live in a
building designed by one of Scotland's foremost architects.
Built in 1887 at Currie in the shadow of the Pentand Hills, Glenburn was
designed by Robert Rowand Anderson - a remarkable man who combined a career in
architecture with an important role as a military engineer.
Educated in the law in Edinburgh, he turned his back on a legal career and
trained with Sir George Gilbert Scott, the architect who designed the Albert
Memorial and Glasgow University's buildings.
Like Scott, Anderson loved working in the Gothic style.
He designed classical additions to Glasgow's Pollok House and Edinburgh
University's Medical School.
In domestic architecture he was to play a leading role in the revival of 17th
century Scots architecture.
Glenburn House was designed in that Scots Renaissance style, and features a
galleried hall, an astronomical observatory, and a billiard room. The grounds
include the Poet's Glen - allegedly named after an Edinburgh equivalent of
McGonagall - which runs alongside the house. The conversion of Glenburn has
produced four individual terraced properties, each with three bedrooms. They
all have accommodation on ground and first floors.
The properties incorporate many original features, but the most noticeable are
the original observatory tower and the billiard room.
Two new four-bedroom houses with a gallery feature have been built in the
grounds.
Glenburn stands in several acres of protected green belt land in the Pentland
foothills at Currie, six miles from the centre of Edinburgh. The property has
panoramic views of the city and the Firth of Forth.
Glenburn House is approached via a tree-lined driveway a short distance from
the village of Juniper Green.
Prices range from #110,000 for the conversions to #215,000 for the new houses.
The sale is being handled by Edinburgh agents O'Neill.

<HEADLINE>Terrorism trial told seized Filofax detailed peace talks</HEADLINE>

DETAILS of the peace talks between loyalists and Northern Ireland Minister
Michael Ancram were discovered in an alleged terrorist's Filofax, a court heard
yesterday.
The thick file was seized by police after the arrest of Progressive Unionist
Party official Lindsay Robb, who took part in the talks at Stormont in March.
The detective, who said he found the Filofax in a house in Ayr where Mr Robb
had been staying, told the High Court in Glasgow of other things it contained.
q An Ulster Volunteer Force plaque and a UVF pen;
q A handwritten UVF statement similar to one used by hooded paramilitaries
when they addressed Scots loyalist functions;
q The visiting card of a US senator from Massachusetts and another of a
British Labour MP.
Mr Robb, 28, a leading member of the Progressive Unionist Party, is on trial
with five other men accused of plotting to further the aims of the UVF by
acquiring guns and ammunition, intended, it is alleged, to endanger lives in
the UK and the Republic of Ireland.
The five other men are Mr John Johnston, 49, from Laurieston, Falkirk; Mr
Francis Hives, 45, of Liverpool; Mr William McArthur, 41, of Bonnybridge; Mr
David White, 29, of Airdrie; and Mr Alexander Davidson, 23, of Lurgan.
Evidence of the discovery of Mr Robb's Filofax after his arrest in an Ayr house
in July was given by Detective Constable Michael Tuckerman of Central Scotland
Police.
He read out the UVF statement in Mr Robb's handwriting which said: ``Loyalist
people of Scotland. It has been a long road. It has been a bloody road. We have
won the battle but the war is yet to be won.
``With the help of our fellow comrades in Scotland we will win the war. With
the help of the Scottish people we will gain an honourable settlement in our
land.
``Many men and women of the Ulster Volunteer Force have laid down their lives
and liberty in the name of Ulster.
``We the Ulster loyalist people owe our fellow loyalist people of Scotland a
debt of gratitude.
``The Mid Ulster UVF will not hesitate to maintain self sacrifice in the name
of the cause For God and Ulster.''
Mr Tuckerman told Mr Ian Bonomy QC, prosecuting, that the Filofax also
contained the names of several of Mr Robb's co-accused.
Entries told of visits to an Airdrie bar and loyalist functions in the Falkirk
area plus a visit to a man in Barlinnie Prison, and visits to Liverpool and
Scotland with a schoolboy football team.
However, Mr Tuckerman admitted to Mr Robb's QC, Mr Donald Findlay, that if the
Filofax contained anything illegal or sinister it would have been foolish to
leave it around openly on view.
He also agreed it was precisely the sort of thing someone involved in the
political world would have and that there were a number of entries relating to
his peace process meetings.
There was also nothing in the Filofax to suggest bombs or guns and the entries
were a reflection of what had been going on in Northern Ireland for a number of
years, with Mr Robb expressing his thoughts on the peace process, his
disappointment at the lack of progress, and the need to take a stronger line.
The trial, before Lord Sutherland, continues.

PAUL GASCOIGNE may have scored a great goal for Rangers against Steau
Bucharest, but he has failed to find the net against CALA Homes. The company
has declined to sell him one of its show homes.
The advantage of buying a show home is that it comes with everything from
carpets to cutlery. CALA is keen to sell him a house, but its show homes have
been declared offside - as they are vital to its marketing campaign.
But if Gazza turns his gaze eastwards, he could pick up a CALA showpiece and do
his team-mate Trevor Steven a favour into the bargain. Steven is selling his
current home, a substantial CALA villa on the outskirts of Edinburgh, to move
nearer to the city centre.
The Corner House, as it is called, is in Kings Cramond at Barnton on the city's
leafy north-western edge. Built in 1989, the house has been upgraded and
extended, ``making this the ultimate house of its type on the market at
present'', says selling agent David Alexander.
The ground floor comprises entrance porch, reception hallway, lounge with
conservatory, dining room, family room, kitchen, breakfast room, a further
conservatory, shower room, and utility room. The stereo system has been
specially wired through the walls.
Upstairs are five bedrooms. The main one has an en-suite shower and steam room.
The attic is partially floored.
The property is part of a small residential development of a number of houses
of similar character varying in size. Its corner location makes it the most
private one.
``The Corner House benefits from being located on one of the best strips of
land,'' says David Alexander. ``The easily-kept gardens are a delight, well
stocked with plants and shrubs giving a variety of colour throughout the year.
The substantial rear garden is in excellent order and the lawn has been
painstakingly lifted, drained and relaid.'' The gardens have lighting to front
and rear.
The house is entered from the road by a 50-metre block paved driveway. It is
being sold at offers over #350,000 by Edinburgh agents D J Alexander. Will
Steven pass it to Gascoigne?

THE definition of contaminated land, of those affected by it, and of the
circumstances in which pollution arises, is no simple task. The drafters of the
Environment Act 1995 have succeeded in creating a statute which, for the first
time, defines succinctly the subject matter but leaves deeper exploration to
``guidance'' by the Department of the Environment (in Scotland, our own
Secretary of State).
The new Act is designed to remedy, or at least minimise, the worst effects of
historic land contamination, identify responsibility, and penalise the
polluter. It is the first Act to tackle purposefully historic pollution. It has
led to the constitution of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA),
which assumes the functions of the river purification authorities, HM
Industrial Pollution Inspectorate, and the Waste Regulation bodies.
One may question the need for yet more legislation of this kind: we have the
Environmental Protection Act 1990, the Control of Pollution Act 1974, the
Public Health (Scotland) Act 1897 (soon to disappear), and the age-old Common
Law of Nuisance - to say nothing of European legislation to which we are now
subject.
However, the 1995 statute is essential if we are to deal responsibly with the
waste we have created with the poisonous residues of derelict industry. The
very nature of contaminated land now receives definition: ``Any land which
appears to relevant local authorities to be in such a condition (by reason of
any substance in, on, or under the land) that significant harm is caused or
there is a significant possibility of significant harm being caused.''
These concepts are left largely undefined and the responsibility for amplifying
them will lie initially with the Secretary of State for Scotland (who is so
empowered to issue guidance on this and most other salient issues arising under
the legislation).
Indeed, draft guidance from the Department of the Environment is already
circulating. This is just as well because it is really in the draft guidance
issued in May this year that we perhaps see the underlying Government policy
(underpinning the new contaminated land laws) which has a little more
appreciation of the needs of industry, business and the economy generally than
is addressed by the bald provisions of the 1995 Act.
Since the shelving of the dreaded ``Register of Land put to a Contaminative
Use'', it has been recognised that the response to our industrial heritage
should rely as far as possible on market forces. This is already implicit in
the operation of town and country planning. It is increasingly common for
``brownfield'' sites to receive regeneration through new development.
The draft guidance talks of a ``suitable for use'' principle, in terms of which
consideration must be given to whether contamination represents an unacceptable
risk to the environment and whether there exist appropriate and cost-effective
means of remediation which take account of the actual or intended use of the
relevant land.
Furthermore, the authorities may only require ``reasonable'' remediation. In
judging what is reasonable in the circumstances they must weigh up the likely
cost against the seriousness of the pollution.
That said, the legislation will, inevitably, be enforced widely. Its primary
target is the polluter - the party who has caused or knowingly permitted the
contaminative substances to be on, in, or under the land.
However, given we are largely dealing with historic contamination, the polluter
may be nowhere to be found. If this is the case, then it will be the owner or
occupier of the land who will step into the firing line. Such is the wide
definition here of ``owner'' that a bank or other lending institution which
attempts to enforce fixed security over the land, and possibly also receivers
and other insolvency practitioners, are at risk. In some circumstances, it may
even be cheaper to write off the bad debt rather than risk direct involvement
with the land.
In most insolvency cases, of course, it will be necessary to take on the
property. Here, the receiver and the appointing bank must go in with their eyes
open and have at least a reasonable understanding of the condition of the land
and its potential to give rise to pollution.
Obviously, the ``suitable for use'' principle is relevant here, but failure to
inform oneself and adopt any necessary measures will easily lead to such an
``innocent party'' being deemed to have ``knowingly permitted'' resultant
pollution.
Failure to comply with a remediation notice involves criminal liability (with a
maximum penalty on summary conviction of a #20,000 fine, but with daily fines
applying thereafter) and will allow the authorities to exercise their own wide
powers of clean-up and cost recovery against the unfortunate ``owner'' or
``occupier''. Moreover, pollutants are known for their migratory tendencies.
Liability will not be confined to your own land.
An essential step in the purchase or lease of, or taking security over, land
which may be contaminated should be some form of environmental audit of past
and present use; identifying the nature and extent of any contamination,
current or historical; and potential liabilities of both ownership and
occupancy.
While water and air-borne pollution can be readily detected in most instances,
buried contamination is usually invisible, lying as a toxic sub-stratum until
inadvertently released by demolition or construction works.
Finally, it should be borne in mind that, in substance, there is nothing
radically new in these provisions. For centuries now the common Law of Nuisance
has existed and often been used to protect landowners from the misdemeanours of
their neighbours. The trouble with the common law is that it depends upon
individual citizens having the inclination and finance to go to court.
These new laws are an attempt to put effective public regulatory machinery in
place to tackle the problems of contaminated land. I have no doubt they will be
used to some effect.
As they say, and with good reason: ``Caveat emptor - let the buyer beware.''

MY God, it must have been awful for Robert Liston. The stench of the blood
splattered over the floor, patients held down as their legs, breasts, arms, or
whatever were hacked off on the operating table, sometimes without even a swig
of brandy to help them. So bad in fact that, as Glasgow University's professor
of pathology Hugh Simpson told the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh,
Liston once walked out intent on switching to something only slightly less
ghastly . . . the law.
Fortunately, the fastest cutter of his generation didn't, and later proved a
model for James Young Simpson, whose knock-out parties for colleagues
eventually came up with ether as a medical anaesthetic.
Penitent's stool
WE got it wrong. The Diary is indebted to Bryan Douglas for pointing out the
error. The first non-white lawyer within the Scottish Bar was not Dr Raj Jandoo
but Albert Mkandawire who was admitted in 1963.
He was born in Nyasaland, now Malawi, where at least the Faculty, the Bar
Council, and the English Law Society have made a positive impact. It was their
delegation, and particulary Jane Deighton, whose intervention in the case of
lawyers Orton and Vera Chirwa which prompted the first moves for democratic
change in Malawi - unlike the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh which in
1991 bestowed its highest honour on the Malawian dictator Hastings Banda after
he had written out a large cheque.
Maybe Liston made the wrong choice, after all.
Bar crime
SOUTH Africa was just one pit stop for Ross Harper in his globetrotting duties
as president of the International Bar Association. Straight on to the plane
after meeting its lawyer President, Nelson Mandela, he jetted off to launch the
IBA year of Latin America in Brazil.
``The IBA is committed to the rule of law and the right to live under the rule
of law,'' he told the assembled gathering. Unfortunately his two presidential
gifts, an IBA tie and set of cufflinks, both portraying the scales of justice
and the hand of fellowship, had been pinched by a tea leaf in Johannesburg.
``The best I can do is offer a firm handshake, a note of thanks, and a promise
to send out replacements as soon as possible,'' El Presidente Harper meekly
added.
Tales from
the Bench
A WOMAN aged 28 was reluctantly giving evidence at a trial at Edinburgh Sheriff
Court concerning a man who had allegedly been beaten up and robbed of 32p at a
boozy party. Shown a photo of the victim, she spluttered ``uuuurgh'' then told
the depute fiscal, Anne Keenan, ``that is a face I would never forget . . . I
have never seen him before in my life''.
Later Sheriff Andrew Bell demanded to know why she was claiming she did not
remember being quizzed by police when she had told the jury she just said ``F .
. . off, F . . . off, F . . . off'' when being interviewed by the constabulary.
``That's what I always tell the police,'' she candidly replied.
Haunting case
THE horrors of Cromwell Street will live on forever for the surviving victims
of Rosemary West. It might be argued that lifetime incarceration among the
likes of Myra Hindley may be a depraved dyke's heaven, particularly for someone
whose sexuality extends to appalling sadism.
The London-based hacks who dutifully chronicled the 31-day trial may now find
themselves in trouble with the Attorney-General over pre-trial publicity. That
would not have happened here and, arguably, the Crown could not have won
convictions up in Scotland because of the lack of corroboration.
Own counsel
THE jury and others have been offered post-traumatic stress counselling. Did
this extend to Mr Justice Mantell QC, who won unanimous praise for the way he
handled the trial?
``Good question,'' said the Lord Chancellor's office. Theoretically, it is
still open to him, but he seems to be made of the right stuff. Not even a wee
holiday for the senior presiding judge of the Western Circuit: he wasr back on
the Bench in Winchester this week presiding over a mundane five-day civil case.

UNTIL recently the proceedings in every sheriff, jury, and high court trial had
to be noted by a shorthand writer. Certain courts are now using recording
equipment instead, and eventually all court officials will be trained in the
use of the machines. I feel some regret at this change.
I have always found it helpful, both as a solicitor and a sheriff, to be able
to ask that the notes be checked to see exactly what a witness said previously
if a dispute has arisen. I have great admiration for the skill and dedication
of the small army of ladies and gentlemen who quickly can find the correct
passage among all the squiggles and dots and read back the exact words used.
When both lawyers and the judge are trying to follow the evidence and also ask
questions it is difficult for them accurately to note the exact words the
witness has used. This can lead to a verbal clash if 20 minutes later it is
suggested a police officer has said something ``may'' have occurred rather than
it ``probably'' happened.
I for one will miss having the help of a shorthand writer in dealing with such
situations; re-winding a tape recorder and trying to find the correct passage
may, I fear, be a poor substitute.
Some judges do know and understand shorthand and for them accurate note-taking
may be easier. One such person was the late Mr Justice Cassels who before going
to the Bar had been a newspaper reporter. He took all his own notes using
shorthand, except when he was presiding over a murder trial. In the 1940s and
50s, when the death penalty was still in use, it was compulsory for all judges
in England when presiding over a capital case to make their trial notes
available for the Appeal Court and the Home Secretary.
As nobody but Sir James Cassels could read shorthand, he required to adapt his
style if he was trying an alleged killer. Only when he pointed out that a
verbatim version of what was said was already available from the court
shorthand writer (it became universal in England and Wales in 1935) was he
allowed to dispense with exhibiting his notes to the Appeal Court. He reverted
to shorthand for every case.
His ability to understand and write shorthand did, however, bring one case to
an abrupt halt when he himself was sitting in the Criminal Appeal Court.
Counsel for the appellant, P H Lawton KC, had claimed a trial judge had
misdirected the jury in a case when he referred to ``these'' cases of stolen
property, when in fact only six out of hundreds of cases of purloined whisky
had been proved.
Sitting with the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Goddard, Cassels pointed out that in
shorthand ``six'' and ``these'' are very similar and a mere dot distinguishes
them. An examination of the actual notes showed the original judge had used the
correct words and an error had arisen in the transcription. ``I seem to have
been defeated by a dot,'' commented Lawton as his client was returned to prison.
A dot also led to the downfall of a corrupt post office official. In June 1934
a firm of bookmakers noticed a Mr Abrahams, a professional racing
correspondent, always seemed to be successful with his bets when he placed by
telegram at one post office but equally invariably lost money if he used
another method of communication. They investigated the position and found
almost all the successful telegrams had been handled by a young clerk, one
William Harvey.
Harvey was believed to be of impeccable character and in a long statement,
every page of which he initialled, he told the police he had never had any
financial dealings with Abrahams and had received the telegrams in the normal
way, stamping them to record the time of receipt and passing them through the
system. He denied any part in the alleged fraud.
The bookmakers decided to try to prove the telegrams had been time-stamped
before the winning horse's name had been added and money had been paid by the
punter to the young post office clerk in return for this service. They finally
traced a #5 note which had been undoubtedly paid by a bank to Abrahams but
which was presented later to a tobacconist near where Harvey worked.
Could they prove the note had been spent by William Harvey? It was noticed that
the store-keeper required any customer presenting him with a Treasury note to
put their initials on the back and this particular one had ``W H'' in pencil in
the corner.
Harvey denied all knowledge of the money. He claimed the letters ``W H'' were
not his. Handwriting experts gave lengthy evidence, some favouring the view the
initials had been made by Harvey, others the contrary. All, however, accepted
there was considerable doubt in the matter.
As the case was drawing to a close, Sir Patrick Hastings, KC, acting for the
bookmakers, picked up Harvey's police statement and while perusing it noted
that on each page Harvey had placed a dot after his last initial; the
significance of the dot was apparent when it was realised it was not in the
usual place of a full stop but nearer the top of the ``H''. In every case the
dot was in exactly the same place.
The #5 was sent for and re-examined by each expert. There, unnoticed before,
was the fatal dot. The experts who had been in doubt before were unanimous in
their view Harvey had initialled the #5 note. The connection between him and
Abrahams was proved beyond doubt and both were imprisoned for their part in an
ingenious fraud.
As shorthand notes are replaced by tape machines in the courts,

THE Princess of Wales would make an ``excellent roving ambassador'', Argentine
president Carlos Menem said yesterday, as he declared that her visit to his
country had helped mend relations with Britain.
The result of the princess's first foreign foray since her declaration in her
Panorama interview that she wanted an ambassadorial role was ``exceptional,
absolutely positive''.
``She managed to make her way to the heart of the people of Argentina,'' he
said, adding that she ``could be an excellent roving ambassador of goodwill,
representing the UK in the rest of the world''.
The president told the BBC Radio 4 programme Today that he sympathised with the
princess over all the media pressure she faced.
The visit passed without any major demonstration over sovereignty of the
Falklands but Mr Menem reiterated Argentina's claim to the islands.
