A GUNMAN was jailed for 14 years yesterday following a siege in which
he held a sawn-off shotgun in the mouth of a woman hostage.
The High Court in Perth was told that, following her ordeal, Ms Ann
Hutcheon, 27, suffered from severe post-traumatic stress disorder and
has been under psychiatric care in hospital for the past three months.
Judge Lord Gill told Wayne McGettigan, 25, that Miss Hutcheon and four
policemen were fortunate not to have been murdered during the seige.
Information that McGettigan had a sawn-off shotgun led the police to
surround his lodgings in Christies Lane, Montrose, last November 27.
McGettigan admitted he held armed officers at bay, he presented the
gun at two of his guests, Miss Hutcheon and her boyfriend Mr Stuart
Buist, detained them against their will, put the gun at the woman's head
and in her mouth, and compelled her to shield him from police marksmen
as he moved to another house in the same street occupied by his mother.
He also admitted that, during the siege, he fired the gun twice at a
total of four policemen.
McGettigan eventually released Miss Hutcheon as he retreated into his
mother's home where he took sleeping tablets He was arrested in a
semi-conscious state four hours after the siege began.

AS I boarded the 8.15 to Queen Street with the other early-morning
commuters I felt like John Cleese's memorable creation in Clockwise --
the schoolteacher who thought he could control time. I seem to remember
him boarding the 8.15 somewhere, bound for a meeting -- with disaster.
Perhaps, after all, this meeting -- a ''time management'' seminar --
for which I was bound was not intended for teachers like me. Perhaps
members of the teaching profession are destined to be controlled by time
-- summoned by regular bells -- rather than be its master.
''Let's start by finding out how many of you are self-employed!'' our
sharp-suited American seminar leader intoned. The forest of hands around
me confirmed my growing sense of being at the wrong seminar. After all
we were at the Glasgow Hilton -- a place where a cup of coffee costs
more than most teachers are prepared to shell out for a three course
lunch.
But our leader was not satisfied with the level of response to his
first question. ''Excellent!'' This was his response when he wasn't
particularly happy with the answer he'd just received. He went on: ''Now
let's try that again and I want to see every hand up.''
I suppose I'm one of that unusally stubborn and un-American breed
which refuses to agree with a proposition which is untrue -- so mine was
perhaps the only hand which remained down. This could, in retrospect,
have been a mistake.
His basic thesis was that we are all self-employed since we have the
power to exercise choice in the use of our time. ''Efficient time
managers arrange their working day according to predetermined priorities
in order to maximise the use of the most precious resource we have on
this earth -- time.'' Sounds good, common sense even, but is it possible
for teachers? That's what I was here to find out.
First task of the day: think of something that you must achieve in the
next five days, work out a reasonable time frame for its completion and
resolve to have it done by midday Friday. After all: ''There are no
impossible goals, only unreasonable deadlines.'' I resolve that my
Standard Grade Prelim marking is going to be my priority task for the
week; the deadline is tight but not unreasonable. Just in case we feel
like backing out of our pledge, we are told to find another delegate and
exchange business cards so that we can ''phone (or fax) each other
Friday, midday to check up on completion''. I seem to have left home
without my business card . . .
The next job is to select at random five tasks which we will be
required to perform over the next 10 days and ''grade them according to
the time investment involved versus the payoff in terms of either
heightened personal profile or improved status of the organisation'', if
not both. As a result of this analysis, we either proceed with the task,
reconsider it, or eliminate it.
Perhaps because of my previous stubbornness, I have caught the
speaker's eye and am chosen to extol the benefits of this method of
organising one's life. I am forced to confess to the 150
''self-employed'' delegates that, after my deliberations, I have just
managed to eliminate my number one priority task for the week. Our
leader is so thrown that he cannot even so much as hiss an ''excellent''
through clenched teeth. I explain that as a result of this decision I
have probably just been fired by my ''organisation''.
So what happens when a given task is not on top of my list of
priorities, but may be important to my employer? Simple: ''That becomes
your number one priority.'' In other words the idea that I can make
decisions about what to do with my time is a fallacy? I never really got
an answer to that conundrum.
What became glaringly apparent is that the world of business and the
world of education are governed by different concepts of time. Our
school day is doled out to us in pre-packaged units which offer little
scope for choice. When the second year come through the door at 11.35am
there is no use asking: ''What are my priorities for the next 40
minutes?''
Businesspeople, I suspect, secretly long to return to this state of
chronological innocence, but having no means by which to achieve it they
end up not so much seeking to control time as to control each other. In
fact numerous tried and tested methods were recommended of making others
feel uncomfortable if they threatened to rob you of more of your
precious time than they were entitled to expect. This is important in
business, as time is money.
To prove the point, at many business meetings in the States the
participants are required to key in to a terminal their hourly rate of
pay so that the computer can add together the hourly rate of everyone
present and keep a running total which is flashed up on a giant
electronic scoreboard every few minutes.
Once they realise they have just spent $10,000 of their companies'
money deciding whether to have coffee or tea at their mid-morning break
they will be frightened into making a decision about something which
matters, or so the theory goes. This, of course, would be unlikely to
work with the teaching profession in this country as the sums of money
involved would frighten no-one.
Even more effective in cutting down time-wasting, apparently, has been
the removal of the tables and chairs from some American board rooms. It
would appear that overweight executives are so keen to return to the
padded comfort of their reclining office chairs that they now take
important decisions in a fraction of the time it took them in their
former, semi-recumbant posture.
Could businesses in this country use such techniques? A couple of
weeks ago I recognised one of my fellow seminar-goers, an independent
financial advisor, from her photograph in the local paper.
Finding myself in need of some independent financial advice, I made an
appointment to see her. I arrived dead on time and was mightily relieved
to have to wait nearly 20 minutes before she could see me.
Far from making me feel that her time was money, she was extremely
tolerant of my limited grasp of elementary mathematics and endlessly
patient as her computer program crashed and had to be coaxed back to
life. In fact my appointment with her over-ran to such an extent that my
wife began to think that I had been over-run -- probably by a bus.
She told me that for the first week everything had gone well; she even
purchased some tapes which expanded upon the principles we had been
taught at the seminar. Soon she discovered that time management
principles were fine if you happened to be in charge of the
organisation, but were not so easy to implement if you were lower down
the pecking order.
And it's not hard to see why: people in positions of power tend to
have elaborate means of ensuring that their working time is not
disturbed by unplanned interruptions. Try to get the head of any large
organisation on the phone and your call will be screened by several
secretaries who will get you to divulge the nature of your business and,
if you are lucky, you will be palmed off on some junior executive.
Thus many successful businessmen who give these seminars and write
treatises on time-management are so shielded from real time pressures
that they think we can all keep interruptions at bay. They don't just
manage their time on their own; they employ legions of subordinates to
help them to do it.
So how is my own time management system shaping up? Last week I
received a letter containing the following statement:
''OVERDUE NOTICE: it has come to our attention that payment for the
undernoted seminar has still not been received by us. Any further delay
will result in financial penalty.
Seminar title: How to Manage Priorities and Meet Deadlines.''
I rest my case.

IN the ongoing debate about the Scots language, folk are aye threipin
on aboot a standard literary Scots, as well as a standard spoken Scots.
Neither of them exist at the moment, although they did in the past. The
argument today is about how they should be reclaimed.
One school of thought looks to the literature that has come down to us
to form the basis of a spoken language, superior to dialect, that would
be understood from the Borders to Buchan and beyond . . . and another
group sees the living forms of Scots we have inherited as the starting
point for encouraging a Standard Scots to evolve, as presumably it did
in the past.
These warring factions seem to me to have missed a point that is
fairly obvious to anyone who has studied both language and literature,
whether in Scots, English, American or anything else.
Here are two quotations to compare. The first is from John Galt's
''The Last of the Lairds'' and describes a man in his thirties:
''Dr Lounlans was one of those ornaments of the Scottish church, by
whom her dignity, as shown by the conduct and intelligence of her
ministers, is maintained as venerable in public opinion, as it was even
when the covenanted nation, for the sake of their apostolic bravery and
excellence, broke the iron arm of both the Roman and Episcopal
Pharaoh.''
Here is another paragraph about a man of the same age from Ron
Butlin's critically-acclaimed novel The Sound of my Voice:
''You were at a party when your father died -- and immediately you
were told, a miracle happened. A real miracle. It didn't last, of
course, but was convincing enough for a few minutes. Then, an hour
later, you took a girl home and forced her to make love. She cried and
pleaded with you; even now, her tears are still the nearest you have
come to feeling grief at your father's death. You are thirty-four years
old; everything that ever happened to you is still happening.''
Both of these paragraphs are written in English, so what has this to
do with the debate about literary Scots? If you consider that one was
written in 1826 and the other was written in 1987, you may see the
reason for the difference between them. While Galt's paragraph is
couched in elegant prose that bears no resemblance to everyday spoken
language, Butlin's is written as something you might hear someone say.
In fact reading it is very like listening to the writer's voice.
Butlin isn't the only present day Scots writer to do this: think of
Jeff Torrington and Swing, Hammer, Swing, think of Alasdair Gray and
James Kelman, Liz Lochhead and Dilys Rose, Brian McCabe and Bess Ross,
all award-winning writers.
The point I am making is that even the best writers today don't keep a
special language for writing in that is remote from everyday speech.
That is a thing of the past and those who are exercising themselves in a
strenuous pursuit of ''literary Scots'', even for poetry, are wasting
their time. It's worth remembering when Wordsworth and Coleridge reacted
against the poetic diction of the eighteenth century in the preface to
their Lyrical Ballads, aiming rather to write in ''the real language of
men'', that Burns had already been doing just that for many years. One
of the finest Scots poets of the twentieth century, William Soutar,
wrote a good deal of his poetry in the Scots that can still be heard
''aside o Craigie Hill''.
Sheena Blackhall, native Scots speaker and many times winner of the
Scots Language Society's Literature Competition, writes in Aberdeenshire
Scots:
''Jist merriet, Janet McHardie wis bein led roon the guests like a
prize heifer, bi her faither, Jeems Cochrane. The guests hid pyed guid
siller for the presents -- hidna mockit her -- was entitled tae gie her
the aince-ower. She wis wearing a wee fite hat, clapt abune her lugs
like a booed ashet. She passed Kirsty's table wi nae davaul -- a
shargered scrat o a bride: it nocht merriege and bairns tae beef her oot
sa bittie.''
Now what more descriptive power and virr could that passage possibly
gain from being written in some as yet unevolved literary language? If
we want to write in Scots we should use the rich varied language we
still possess.

NO longer perceived as an off-the-wall piece of self-indulgence for
cranks and celebrities, alternative medicine is now used by one in five
people in the UK, either instead of, or in conjunction with,
conventional medicine.
If the trend continues, as recent research by Yale Medical School on
the health habits of the American public shows, it looks as if a visit
to your alternative health practitioner will become at least as common
as going to your GP in the not-too-distant future.
The market for alternative medicine is vast, claims Brian Fleming,
administrative director of the School of Complementary Medicine in
Glasgow. Career opportunities are wide open in this rapidly expanding
field of work. But with an ever-increasing range of alternative
therapies and with centres, schools and colleges springing up all over
Scotland, the UK, and Europe to cope with the demand it can be a
confusing field, full of potential pitfalls, for the aspiring
practitioner to enter.
Deciding which therapy to study is the first thing, says Brian
Fleming. This seems to be stating the obvious until you realise that
massage therapy, for example, can mean aromatherapy, Tai massage,
shiatsu, reflexology -- there's even a stress doctor in Glasgow's South
Side offering Brazilian toe massage -- and umpteen other things.
A copy of the Complementary Medicine Careers Handbook (Hodder and
Stoughton) is a good starting point. It gives information on the various
specialisms within alternative or complementary medicine, common career
patterns and details of courses and training organisations in the UK and
throughout Europe.
The Institution for Complementary Medicine is another excellent source
of information. It deals with 30,000 enquiries about courses and is
working towards setting up a minimum National Vocational Qualification
for all practitioners of alternative and complementary medicine.
''There are the good, the bad and indifferent,'' warns Brian Fleming.
''But sticking a pin in a newspaper or magazine is not the way to do it.
A professional body can guide you to a good and reputable college.''
Information is the key to finding a good training course, agrees Ian
Holland, who has practised remedial massage and postural integration in
Glasgow for 16 years, and now teaches the subject. He also published
Connections, the alternative health magazine, and is the organiser of
the Scottish Alternative Health Fair which comes to Edinburgh in March.
''Ring round people working in the field for advice,'' he says. ''And
it is a good idea to have a thorough discussion with the organisers of
your chosen course before you commit yourself to anything.''
The older, more established fields of alternative medicine are
generally the most reliable in terms of training. Osteopathy,
acupuncture, homeopathy and herbalism are all well regulated and are
increasingly used as a complement or alternative to conventional
medicine by GPs.
The Osteopathy Act in 1993, registering qualified osteopaths in the
same way as conventional doctors, seems to be indicative of the way
alternative medicine is moving to regulate itself.
The kinds of people who want to make a career in alternative medicine
are as diverse as the disciplines within it. I heard of an ex-army
sergeant, a nun and a priest -- the last two wanted to add therapeutic
massage to the pastoral skills they used in the community.
A common mistake for newly-qualified people is to give up their
full-time job and rush into the launch of their new business.
Aromatherapy, the fastest growing field in alternative medicine in the
UK at the moment, is more than saturating its market, according to Ian
Holland, yet there is a shortage of acupuncturists around Glasgow.
''There are hundreds of people on aromatherapy courses,'' he says,
''Every second person I meet seems to want to be an aromatherapist.
People give up their job and set up a therapy room in their house and
wait for the phone to ring. Then it hardly rings at all. But you have to
take a wee bit of time to get known. It's like a car mechanic, you get
known by word of mouth.''
Other options include working from an already established base, such
as in one of the many complementary medicine centres now operating
throughout Scotland. Many such centres offer independent therapists
space to rent on their premises. Or you could set up your own clinic,
teaming up with a group of therapists to form a centre.
One young woman who has set up her own therapy business, successfully
avoiding the pitfalls that trip up many older would-be entrepreneurs, is
20-year-old Marisa Forte from Bearsden near Glasgow. Careers analysis in
her final year at school directed Marisa towards an HND in Beauty
Therapy at Clydebank College, where she specialised in reflexology and
aromatherapy.
Just three years later, Marisa now runs a busy home salon alongside a
mobile therapy service which includes weekly sessions at the Kirkhouse
Hotel in nearby Blanefield.
Marisa believes her thriving business has been successful because of
her decision to offer a range of treatments based on popular alternative
health remedies, appealing to a wide market, as opposed to specialising
in one area.
''There is a very good market for alternative-type treatments such as
aromatherapy, reflexology and hydrotherapy as well as for products which
are based on alternative remedies,'' says Marisa.
Marisa's success has also been due to her sound business approach. She
gained valuable work experience in a salon after leaving college and,
deciding that she would have far more scope in working for herself, did
some market research.
Business advice and practical help in setting up came from Scottish
Enterprise and The Prince's Trust, and a spare room in her parents' home
was converted into a mini-salon.
Less than a year after setting up, Marisa says she is enjoying the
challenge of running her own business and the satisfaction that comes
from providing her growing list of clients with a session of therapy
that is time out from the stresses and burdens of modern life.
* Careers advice on opportunities and training in alternative health
is available at The Scottish Alternative Health Fair held in the
Assembly Rooms, George Street, Edinburgh, March 25 and 26. Phone Ian
Holland on 0141 334 5846 for further information on lectures and
workshops.

<HEADLINE>Sports beneficiaries revealed. Lottery stands to revolutionise community facilities with #13m awards within the year</HEADLINE>

SEVEN Scottish projects were named yesterday as Britain's first
beneficiaries of the National Lottery Sports fund.
From Shetland to Carluke, a total of #1,869,500 was allocated to
community facilities ranging from football to gliding. Sir Hector Monro,
the Scottish Office Minister for Sport, confirmed there was no question
of lottery funds affecting money already promised from Government
sources.
By the end of the year, Scottish sports bodies are expected to have
hit the jackpot by receiving #13m, said Scottish Sports Council chief
executive Allan Alstead. The scope and scale of grants reveals the
capacity of the lottery to revolutionise sporting life in Scotland.
The largest award, #760,000, is for the building of Ness Islands Aqua
Dome, Inverness. Plans include an eight-lane, 25-metres competitive
swimming pool.
Clydesdale District Council will be given #673,000 to help build a
20-metre pool, at Carluke, for joint school and community use.
The #10m East End Leisure pool in Glasgow's Tollcross will benefit
with a #280,000 grant which will be used to instal a 25-metre moveable
floor, although the full pool will be 50 metres.
The floor, the world's largest moveable one in a pool, will be able to
rise completely from the water, allowing roll-on wheelchair access. It
can also be tilted, making it particularly safe for beginners.
Completion is expected next summer.
Deeside Gliding Club, at Aboyne, receives #49,000 to build a glider
storage hall, while #45,000 will go to the Northern Sport Development
Trust, at Brae, Shetland. It will be spent on changing accommodation for
their synthetic all-weather pitch, the only one of its kind on the
island.
''Grass is unplayable from September to May, and people travel up to
40 miles to play at Brae,'' says trust spokesman Rab Duffin.
Bellshill &amp; Mossend YMCA is receiving #37,500 to help fund a multi-gym
and health suite. The club, which introduced Tom McKean, the former
World and European 800 metres champion, to athletics, will use the money
to broaden family appeal.
Priestfield Tennis and Sports Association, an Edinburgh club
unaffiliated even to the Scottish Lawn Tennis Association, demonstrates
what can be done by grass roots sports bodies who get their act
together. They were awarded #24,700 to resurface their five courts.
However, Mr Alstead reiterated a complaint revealed some months ago in
The Herald, namely concern that lottery funds can be used only for
capital projects. Nothing can be given to sportsmen and women who are
regularly out of pocket, to the tune of #5000 per year, representing
their country. The drive to force Government to change the lottery rules
will continue, said Mr Alstead.
The Scottish Sports Council plans to announce lottery beneficiaries
once a month for recipients of up to #100,000. Those receiving more than
this will be named every three months. Already the SSC has received more
than 90 applications, and has distributed 1220 forms. Details of how to
apply are available from the SSC, Lottery Sports Fund, Caledonia House,
South Gyle, Edinburgh EH12 9DQ.
Glasgow already has an application for a #65m project for regeneration
of Glasgow Green, which includes a 14,000 capacity international sports
arena.
Initial grants to organisations in England totalled more than #3m,
which went to 34 projects.

<HEADLINE>Attack on Camelot over the profits system</HEADLINE>

THE Lottery Promotion Company yesterday launched an attack on the size
of profits which will be paid to Camelot, the private company running
the lottery.
Mr Gawain Towler, a spokesman for the Lottery Promotion Company, said
he did not blame Camelot itself but rather the Government's regulator
Oflot.
Mr Towler claimed Camelot, a consortium including Cadbury Schweppes,
De La Rue, Racal, GTech, and ICL, had already taken #106m after the
pay-outs and that it would take only four more weeks for it to cover its
outlay of #125m.
After that, he said, Camelot would have more than six years remaining
of its seven-year contract. Retailers received 5% of lottery revenue,
with Camelot getting 10%, a clear 5% of which would be pure profit, Mr
Towler said.
Mr Chris Smith, Labour's shadow environment spokesman, said that if
the profit was indeed as high as had been predicted, then the Government
should sit down with Camelot and renegotiate its contract.
''I am going to question how much of their expenditure in
establishing, advertising, and getting the lottery off the ground they
have now recovered from their income,'' Mr Smith said.
Mr David Rigg, Camelot's communications director, said the company
would not be disclosing its financial results until the end of the
financial year, the end of March, but he did confirm that Camelot had
received around #100m, not all of which was profit.
Around #50m had gone to retailers and commission, and #34m on
advertising and marketing, he said.
''When we started in November, #49m worth of tickets were sold in the
first week. Everyone thought that that would drop off but it has
continued to climb slowly to #60m a week,'' said Mr Rigg.
He said the scratch cards to be launched today might increase sales by
25% and that Camelot was considering running a mid-week draw offering
lower prizes than the Saturday draw.
Mr Towler predicted that Camelot in its first year could reach a
profit of as much as #150m providing that the launch of scratch cards
was well handled.
He said the ''prediction of Oflot to Sir Ivan Lawrence (chairman of
the Commons Home Affairs Committee) that Camelot would not receive any
cash until the fourth year bears no relationship to reality.
''In fact, Camelot, having already taken #106m, could have covered
their equity capital plus #41m of their #75m loan before any good cause
has received one penny.''
Mr Towler claimed the regulator had miscalculated the money involved
in the lottery from day one.
''The regulator did not realise how successful it would be,'' he said.

THE horrors of the Bosnian war temporarily behind her, 12-year-old
Menira Drace played cards with her doctor yesterday as she prepared for
heart surgery at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow.
Menira, who made a two-day, 2000-mile journey with her mother by road
and air from the siege town of Mostar, will have an operation on
Thursday to repair a hole in her heart.
The slightly-built but outgoing girl has seen nearly a dozen people
killed in the streets, lost her home, and seen her father shot.
Twelve days ago, Menira, along with her mother Edina, 40, left father
Maid, 41, and brother Mithad, nine, and set off in a Unicef Land Rover
to catch a flight from Split in Croatia. They flew to Glasgow via
Zagreb, Frankfurt, and London.
What was it like in Mostar after three years of war, I asked Menira.
''Go and see for yourself,'' she pleaded. ''I couldn't describe it --
it has to be seen to be believed.''
Although an uneasy peace has settled on Mostar over the past year --
due to an EU-brokered settlement -- the town is still an island in
hostile territory, with Serb guns not far away.
Menira, who underwent surgery in 1990 in Belgrade, was born with a
hole between the two top chambers in her heart and with an unrelated
growth problem. As a result, while she has grown only 12cms in the past
five years, her heart has grown abnormally large, and so has the hole.
Dr Bill Doig, a consultant paediatric cardiologist at Yorkhill, said:
''The hole is now about 1.5cms across and the patch that was made five
years ago does not cover it. If she doesn't get this treatment she will
develop serious problems before long.''
Mr Kenneth McArthur will carry out the operation on Thursday and, if
it goes well, Menira will be fit to return to Mostar in two weeks.
Meanwhile, a nine-year-old Bosnian girl who has received specialist
treatment at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh, is to be
allowed home.
Dzenita Kurbegovic underwent extensive tests to assess the extent of
damage caused when a sniper's bullet tore through her neck, tongue, and
epiglottis.
Director of surgery, Mr Gordon MacKinlay, said the investigations
showed her wounds had healed remarkably well over the last two years and
would not require corrective operations.

SCOTTISH charities which depend on councils for the bulk of their
funds are looking to the National Lottery for a lifeline when local
authority reform wipes an estimated #90m from their budgets next year.
However, the newly-formed National Lottery Charities Board is expected
to have only #100m to deal out to charities and voluntary groups
nationwide.
Charities umbrella group, the Scottish Council for Voluntary
Organisations, fears many groups could fold following next year's local
government changes, when tens of millions of pounds in funding are
expected to disappear. It expects many to look to the lottery to plug
the gap.
SCVO is leading a series of seminars, which are expected to attract
more than 500 groups, giving them the chance to question a lottery
charities panel over what they may be able to claim.
Ms Lucy Pratt, of SCVO, said said they feared many groups and
charities could collapse if they lost out on vital council grant aid and
were refused lottery help.
''There is nothing to say that the National Lottery Charities Board
will choose to fund any organisations which lose out on council aid,''
she said.
Charities' board chairman David Sieff said yesterday that the first
phase of the funding distribution blueprint would be announced at the
end of May.
Mr Sieff, who was in Edinburgh at the second of the series of five
Scottish consultation seminars, told 250 delegates that the board's
greatest concern was to ensure it was ''efficient, effective, and fair''
in its awards.
''We won't be able to please everyone all the time but we hope that
people will recognise that we have sought to gather their views and
listened to their comments,'' he said.
Further seminars are planned in Glasgow, Ayr, and Aberdeen in April.

A GLASGOW GP, who formed a long-lasting and improper emotional
relationship with a patient, was refused the chance to resume
unrestricted practice after a General Medical Council meeting yesterday.
Dr Alastair Muir, 33, a therapist, of Milverton Avenue, Bearsden, was
ordered not to practice hypnotherapy or to teach it for a further twelve
months -- added to a similar twelve months' restriction previously
imposed after he was found guilty of serious professional misconduct in
March last year.
Mr Tom Rider, solicitor to the council, told its professional conduct
committee that Dr Muir had been found guilty of ''forming and pursuing''
an improper emotional relationship with a Ms A during hypnotherapy
between October 1991 and February 1992.
Mr Ralph Shipway, for Dr Muir, said he accepted he had made a serious
error in allowing himself to become so emotionally involved as to cloud
his professional judgment.
The doctor had followed the previous committee's directions that he
should agree to seek and follow the advice of a psychiatrist with a view
to training, as well as not practising or teaching hypnotherapy himself
for twelve months.
After lengthy discussion, committee chairman Sir Herbert Duthie told
Dr Muir that it did not consider it would be right at this time to
restore him to unrestricted practice.
Accordingly, the conditions forbidding him from practising or teaching
hypnotherapy would remain.

THE Health and Safety Executive will submit a report to the
procurator-fiscal in Inverness within the next few weeks on the gas
explosion which badly damaged an elderly couple's council house in
Inverness early in January.
Mr James Ross, 82, is still recovering from burns sustained in the
explosion at his Bruce Gardens home. Preliminary investigations linked
the explosion to a faulty British Gas meter. The husband of a niece of
the Rosses, Mr Colin Baillie, insists he reported the leak, phoning
British Gas twice.
Although British Gas admits it received the initial call, it can find
no trace of the second. Speculation was growing yesterday that the
company might now face prosecution.
The police have already submitted a report to the fiscal but a force
spokesman said that this would be done as a matter of routine with such
an incident.
A spokesman for British Gas said yesterday: ''British Gas are not
aware of any charges being brought regarding the incident at Mr Ross's
home in Bruce Gardens, Inverness. We are however, aware that the Health
and Safety Executive's report into the matter has yet to be finalised.
''Our investigations have been completed and we will be making the
findings known to the appropriate authorities when required.''

THE Queen was welcomed back to South Africa yesterday with a warmth
matched only by the sunshine.
Thousands of people turned out to greet her and the Duke of Edinburgh
in Cape Town at the start of their historic state visit which seals
South Africa's return to the Commonwealth after the isolation of
apartheid.
In a keynote address to the South African Parliament, the Queen
praised the creation of a new, democratic South Africa as ''little short
of a miracle''.
She bestowed high honour upon President Nelson Mandela, the man who
worked that miracle, awarding him the Order of Merit.
President Mandela, who achieved black majority rule peacefully in
South Africa, joins Mother Teresa of Calcutta as only the second living
holder of the award outside Britain.
The Queen also announced that the president would next year make a
state visit to Britain, the first by a South African head of state.
A flotilla of small yachts and boats escorted Britannia to her mooring
in Cape Town harbour as a Royal Marines band played on the upper deck
and Britannia's crew lined the lower decks.
The crowds gathered along the waterfront were predominantly white and
did not wholly represent the people of the new South Africa but the
warmth of the welcome was unmistakable.
President Mandela and his niece Rochelle Mtirara were on the quayside
to meet the Queen, who was wearing a light blue silk dress, matching
blue linen coat, and brimmed straw hat.
There was a 21-gun salute and a fly-past by six South African Air
Force jets as the Queen reviewed a guard of honour.
She delighted well-wishers anxious for a glimpse of the royal visitor
by making two walkabouts, shaking hands with people in the crowd, many
of whom gave her flowers.
The Queen waved and smiled at the people but showed a special interest
in 40 corgis paraded for her by Cape Town Corgi Club.
Meanwhile, Prince Philip set off explosive charges to excavate part of
a new dock development on the Cape Town waterfront.
President Mandela's estranged wife Winnie stayed away from the
ceremonial welcome and was absent -- said to be visiting squatters in
the township of Soweto -- when the Queen addressed the South African
parliament.
The Queen told the parliament that the spirit of reconciliation in
South Africa was a ''shining example to the world''.
There could be ''no turning back'' from democracy, she said.
Ever since her last visit in 1947, she had wanted to return.
''That wish has never deserted me through a half-century during which
you have seen turmoil and tragedy,'' the Queen told parliament.
''Now, though, you have become one nation, whose spirit of
reconciliation is a shining example to the world, and I have come back
to see for myself what is little short of a miracle.''
She concluded with words from the Bantu National Anthem: ''Nkosi
Sikelel iAfrika'' -- Lord Bless South Africa.
Later, in a speech at a state banquet given in her honour, the Queen
described her reception in Cape Town as ''unforgettable''.
She referred to the ''pain and suffering'' felt by many, and
especially by the Afrikaner people, during the Boer War at the turn of
the century.
Hardline Afrikaners had threatened to boycott the Queen's visit until
she ''apologised'' for the war.
Her reference stopped short of an apology but was a recognition of the
strength of feeling among the Afrikaners.
President Mandela, also addressing the banquet, said that while
watching Britannia sail into Cape Town, he could not help thinking of
the 50 years of turbulent history separating the new South Africa from
the Queen's last visit in 1947.
''We knew, through the many years of privations, that your Majesty's
'home from home' would one day emerge into the sunshine of the world
community of democratic nations,'' he said.
''For this, we owe much to the support received from your Majesty, her
Majesty's Government, and the people of the United Kingdom.''

A VOTE by midwives to abandon their traditional ''no strike'' policy
was welcomed by other health unions as the strongest indication yet of
the widespread anger sparked by the Government's ''derisory'' 1% central
award to the 600,000 NHS nurses and midwives.
A ballot of the Royal College of Midwives recorded a massive 82% in
favour of dropping the 115-year-old policy of moderation and a similar
ballot result is expected next week from the Community and District
Nurses Association.
With the largest health union, UNISON, already gearing up for an
industrial action ballot, attention will soon focus on the 300,000
member Royal College of Nursing which is also to review its no-strike
stance next month.
With all 18 unions and associations agreeing, so far at least, to work
in concert it is quite possible that one million NHS workers will soon
be balloted on a campaign of industrial action in support of a 3%
national wage settlement.
Health Secretary Virginia Bottomley urged midwives to ''think long and
hard'' before abandoning their no-strike policy and claimed that 70% of
NHS trusts had indicated they were prepared to improve on the 1% award
with local deals of up to 2%.
The full ballot results showed that while only 20% were in favour of
strike action, 53% were for a partial withdrawal of labour. This figure
rose to 75% supporting an overtime ban; 78% in favour of working to
grade; 70% support for refusal to undertake administrative duties; 67%
in favour of work to rule, and 72% for a withdrawal of goodwill.
Giving details of the ballot result, Ms Julia Allison, RCM general
secretary, said: ''I make this announcement with a heavy heart, as I
know that many of the RCM members voted with the same feeling. We find
ourselves on a path which is not of our choosing, and firmly put the
blame on the Government's shoulders.''
Midwives, she said, would hold a second ballot on industrial action
within 10 days and a special working group would spend the next few days
examining possible options.
Never in its history had the RCM been so close to industrial action
she said.
Mrs Allison revealed more than 16,000 midwives voted in the first
ballot out of the college's 34,000 membership -- a very high turnout of
53%. She added that she was sure members would vote for industrial
action in their fight for ''justice''.
* UNISON accused the Government of adding insult to injury by
appointing Mr Michael Bett, chairman of the Nurses and Midwives Pay
Review Body which awarded the controversial 1%, to the #57,000 a year
three-day-week job of head of the independent civil service
commissioners.

<HEADLINE>Graduates avoiding 'futile' careers in executive jobs</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>979288200</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
GRADUATES are shunning highly competitive executive jobs because they
regard the career path as ultimately futile, according to a report by St
Andrews University.
The study states that students in the 1990s are opting for safe but
unchallenging jobs, after watching their parents being sacked or made
redundant in mid career.
Graduates no longer see a degree as a ''meal ticket'' but realise they
will have to ''muck in'' and make their way in small companies doing
jobs that are beneath them, the report says.
It also found that many of today's graduates lack any confidence in
finding a safe career in a top-flight company.
Mr Jack Daniels, director of St Andrew's University Careers Advisory
Service, said: ''I have no doubt that this is a very significant factor
in the types of jobs students are seeking.
''They have seen their parents suffering after being made redundant in
corporate restructuring and it is undoubtedly creating a mood of caution
and despair.''
Mr Daniels said that, in times of recession, large companies usually
had a huge increase in the number of applications made for graduate
training schemes.
Instead, large firms like Shell and ICI have discovered the number of
applicants is dropping.
''It is becoming so much of a gamble, a lottery really, and so time
consuming that people are being put off from applying,'' Mr Daniels
said. ''Companies have become so successful at weeding people out that
even suitable applicants aren't applying now.
''Students fear that by the time it is over they will have missed out
on other vacancies, so they choose to go for easier things.''
Mr Daniels said that he felt there was still a long way to go before
students were suitably equipped for the necessary skills required in the
1990s.
''Students must make far more use of their time at university. They
have to use their vocational time to get practical experience, as well
as acquiring skills in computing, numeracy, and communicating,'' he
said.

A SURFER, in danger of being swept out to sea, was rescued by
helicopter after his cries for help were heard by a man walking along
the shore on Lewis yesterday.
Harris Tweed weaver Donald Morrison, 67, of Lower Barvas, jumped on
his bike and cycled home to raise the alarm after spotting the
struggling lone surfer among the waves, out of Croig Bay, near Barvas,
on the west of the island.
Mr Morrison said: ''When I got back to the house, I was in such a rush
the first thing I thought of was to phone my daughter Tina who works at
the control tower at the airport in Stornoway.'' The tower's number was
pre-programmed into Mr Morrison's phone and he was through to her in
seconds.
Daughter Tina alerted the coastguard, who diverted the rescue
helicopter which was already airborne on exercise.
The exhausted surfer, who is aged 30 and visiting Lewis from Ayrshire,
was winched aboard the helicopter and taken to the shore.
He told rescuers he had been in the water for about two and a half
hours. He had been using a short board, known as a Boogie Board, which
is controlled by the surfer using his flippers but he had lost the
flippers and was out of control.
After he was rescued, the surfer became unwell and an ambulance was
called to take him to Western Isles Hospital.
The surfer declined to give his name at the hospital. He walked from
the emergency department to the X-ray department for a chest X-ray, but
his condition was unknown last night.
When he first heard the cries for help just before 3pm, Mr Morrison
thought it was winkle-pickers on the shore who were shouting.
He said: ''But as I walked near the shore I realised the cries were
coming from the sea. I had my binoculars with me.
''The surfer was obviously in trouble. I could see that he was trying
to get on to the board but he couldn't manage it.
''He was probably a mile off the shore. Although there wasn't much
wind, the current was taking him out to sea.''
Mr Morrison added: ''He was obviously very tired and cold.
''I don't know what he was doing out there on his own but he was very
lucky.''

DUNFERMLINE may join Edinburgh District Council in a joint effort to
improve maintenance and repairs to the Forth rail bridge.
Both councils have powers to force Railtrack to restore the bridge to
its original condition.
Edinburgh's director of planning, Mr Graham Duncan, said he had been
concerned about reports of the state of the bridge for some time. He has
asked for access to the bridge by council officials and has reserved the
council's position to use its enforcement powers.
Councillor John Simpson, leader of the Labour Group on Dunfermline
District Council, said yesterday: ''Edinburgh's approach is certainly an
interesting option. I would be sympathetic towards and will be having
discussions with my officials to see if it is worth taking further.''
Railtrack has insisted that it is satisfied with its maintenance
programme and that any corrosion is superficial.
''Edinburgh has asked for details on the maintenance schedules and we
would be happy to meet them,'' a Railtrack spokeswoman said.

MOTHERWELL's #400,000 bid to sign Dutch defender Mitchell van der Gaag
ground to a temporary halt last night.
For PSV Eindhoven insisted on certain written guarantees before they
would agree to finalise the deal for their former Under 21 player.
Motherwell manager Alex McLeish said: ''Eindhoven's representative
have made certain conditions with which we are happy to comply.
''We have made further progress and hope to conclude the transfer
tomorrow. In the lengthy talks I have had with the player since he
arrived here he has made it clear that he is very keen to re-launch his
career at Motherwell. I believe he will be tailor-made for the Scottish
game.
''However, even assuming everything goes as planned, it will leave
little time to arrange his clearance with the Dutch FA.
''But every effort will be made to clear the formalities because I
hope to have him in place for the game against Hibs at Easter Road on
Wednesday afternoon.
It will have a major bearing on the race to qualify for Europe and I
want my strongest team available. ''

CRAIG Brown, the Scotland manager, named Duncan Ferguson in his
international squad yesterday, sat for several minutes explaining how
the Everton player could be vitally important in Moscow next week, and
then learned that the ex-Rangers man might not be available.
The news from Everton is that Ferguson is suffering from a groin
strain which has nagged at him over the past few weeks. His manager, Joe
Royle, spoke to Brown yesterday afternoon to declare the #4m man as a
serious doubt.
And that call threw Brown's plans into chaos.
The Scottish manager had named only three strikers in his pool of 18
players -- Ferguson, Darren Jackson, and John McGinlay. When that was
pointed out he defied anyone to name others who could push his way into
the squad.
Only Chelsea's John Spencer rated a mention and he must prove his
fitness against Queen's Park Rangers tomorrow before Brown will bring
him in.
After the call, Brown admitted: ''If big Duncan is not fit then we
could be in trouble. It is not an area where we have several players
available and, really, were down to the bare bones. Now, when we have
based our planning on the big fellow being there, we have to think
again.
''I told Spenny that he was still in my thoughts but that he had to
play a full game for his club before I could take him to Russia. He has
an opportunity to show me that against Queen's Park Rangers.
''If he does not make it then we have serious problems. There is no
disguising that.''
Brown would be left looking at Eoin Jess, who is mainly a substitute
at Aberdeen, or Duncan Shearer, who has just come back after injury, or
even the man he overlooked yesterday, Brian McClair who, these days, is
used mainly in midfield by Manchester United.
It is not an easy shout for Brown. He remains hopeful that, on Friday,
a fitness check at Goodison Park will allow Ferguson to travel with the
squad.
That would alleviate his problems. In the meantime Brown intends to
travel south in midweek to see shock choice, Colin Calderwood, play for
Spurs against Liverpool.
It will be a mission to look at whether the 30-year-old uncapped
player can push his way into the team alongside Blackburn's Colin
Hendry.
It is not usual, these days, for someone to emerge and be named in the
squad with no previous recognition for Scotland. Calderwood has beaten
the system -- and Brown admits: ''He is there because he is a form
player in a form team. It is as simple as that.
''We have looked at him before but, right now, he is playing well,
Spurs are looking good, and Colin has benefitted from the changes there
have been at the club. I would have no hesitation about playing him in
Moscow because he is used to playing in big, big games.
''His temperament is good and if I decide to put him in I would have
no worries about how he handled the situation.''
Calderwood, himself, was surprised at his selection. He confessed:
''This is a big, big surprise to me. When you are playing for a big-time
club like Spurs you always hope that someone will notice you.
''But I honestly thought my time had passed. Then this morning Gerry
Francis and Craig Brown phoned me to say that I was in. I sat there
waiting for Noel Edmonds to call and say it was all a joke -- but that
didn't happen.
''Actually I was not at the club today because there has been a bug
going the rounds here. My three-year-old daughter, Abby, and my wife,
Karen, have been ill and I felt it during the night. I was really sick.
But I'm fine now and I want to play against Liverpool and further
convince Craig Brown.
''It's funny to think that last summer I was almost a Celtic player
because things were not working out for me at White Hart Lane. In fact,
if Lou Macari had not been sacked, then I would have signed for them.
''Now, since Gerry Francis arrived, things have just turned around.
The team are playing so well and I have been happy with my own form,
too.''
Macari has been a major influence in Calderwood's career. He took him
from Mansfield to Swindon where he established the reputation which
aided him in his move to Spurs.
Now he says: ''It would be a dream season for me if I could play for
Scotland and go onto the cup final with Spurs -- especially at this
stage of my career.''
Bolton's McGinlay will be asked to travel north for an hour-and-a-half
long training session on Saturday, instead of playing for Bolton at
Portsmouth. It is a decision which will hurt the striker whose club
place at Wembley the following week could now be under threat.
And, despite the manager disagreeing with me, I feel he is making a
mistake on this occasion.
Brown now faces several worrying days before he can head for the
Russian game with any degree of confidence.
Meanwhile, the Under-21 squad was also named and, there, you have
strikers who are scoring freely -- Dean Freedman helped himself to a hat
trick for Barnet and Andy Liddell scored two for Barsnley at the
weekend.
If they play in Moscow they will have players to provide ammunition
for them. Dundee winger Neil McCann will be there and Celtic's Brian
McLaughlin has been brought into the squad for the first time.

THE Scotland rugby side may soon have a full-time professional team
manager in the manner of their football counterparts.
The proposal has the backing of current manager Duncan Paterson,
although he will not be a candidate for the post when he leaves office
after the World Cup in South Africa this summer.
The appointment of a paid team manager is just one part of an internal
management review being undertaken by the Scottish Rugby Union. Another
possibility is the appointment of a general manager to look after the
burgeoning sponsorship and marketing interests of the international
side.
The SRU, although retaining the amateur committee structure which has
served it well throughout its 122-year history, has already moved to
meet the demands of the game as it moves into the 21st century.
The Union operates under chief executive and secretary Bill Hogg.
Recent senior appointments have been made to assist in the running of a
business with a #5.5m annual turnover and, on the playing side, the
Union has appointed Jim Telfer to the post of director of rugby.
Paterson, who became Scotland's first team manager for the 1991 World
Cup, has been heavily involved in the internal review at Murrayfield,
which seeks to take account of the fact that, with summer tours and
World Cup competitions every four years, the game has, in the manager's
words, ''exploded'' in popularity since the early eighties.
Yesterday, back at his woollen business in Galashiels, Paterson
reflected on Scotland's rags-to-riches season, which culminated in
Saturday's Grand Slam showdown with England and on his four-year tenure
in the manager's role.
''So far as Saturday is concerned I think that we came very close,''
he said. ''If we had been allowed to ruck then I think we might have
done it. Brian Moore's comments about us slowing down the game were just
ridiculous. It wasn't in our interests to slow it down. Our whole
concept was to speed it up.''
The former Scotland scrum half, who won 10 caps between 1969-72, said
that since he became manager in 1991 -- from the chairman of selectors'
post -- he had often been putting in 50-60 ''rugby'' hours a week. He
was fortunate in that family and colleagues shouldered the burden at
work, but it was becoming an increasingly onerous task for an unpaid
volunteer to carry out.
''Talks are going on within the SRU which take account of the fact
that there will probably soon have to be a general manager looking after
the administration, sponsorship, and marketing. Also a team manager who
will be responsible for the team. I think that this will have to happen
sooner rather than later.''
Paterson said that he would not be a candidate. ''I've done my bit and
I've enjoyed it but I leave after the World Cup and so I won't be a
candidate. But I know just how time-consuming the job is.''
''Twenty years ago, with the same number of committee-men, the
turnover of the SRU was in the order of #40,000 a year. Now it is a huge
commercial enterprise turning over last year something like #5.5m. The
game has just exploded in the last decade and this is something that is
being addressed right now.''
The manager, like the coaching and playing personnel, came under heavy
criticism during the run of nine games without a win. That ended after
the victory over Canada in January when the selectors -- Paterson among
them -- wielded the axe and nine fresh faces were introduced to the side
which met the Canadians.
''Yes, the going was tough at times but I never ever thought that it
was as bad as some of the critics made out. We suffered desperate luck
last season with injuries and games just going against us.
''This season, though, has been a tonic. I think this has been the
most enjoyable two months of my life. The high-spot was France, where we
won for the first time in 26 years,'' he said.
A feature of the Scotland set-up this season has been the upbeat
atmosphere that permeates the entire squad, and it is one which they
will take with them to South Africa in the summer.
''The atmosphere in the squad is down to getting rid of complacency.
That came through making the nine changes after the South Africa game.
It was a gamble but the time had come for us to take a long, hard look
at ourselves.

THEO Snelders must play his part in Aberdeen's fight for premier
division survival if he is fit so to do.
The Pittodrie club will not permit their 31-year-old Dutch keeper to
decide his season is over unless there is medical evidence to support
his case.
Snelders, who injured an ankle in clearing a back pass from team-mate
Joe Miller, had a furious row with the winger then revealed that he
would be unable to play in any of Aberdeen's seven remaining league
games.
However, assistant manager Drew Jarvie dismissed belief yesterday:
''He will play if he is fit,'' said Jarvie. ''He is a good professional
and there will be no problems. X-rays have shown there is nothing
broken.
''His foot is swollen and sore but the bruising is coming out. We are
hopeful he will be ready for our next game here against Kilmarnock.''
Snelders and Miller have rowed openly before in games. Now there are
genuine fears within Pittodrie that their deteriorating relationship
could affect dressing-room morale at a critical stage in the relegation
battle.
Defender Colin Woodthorpe, out of action for four months with a back
injury, made a successful return against Hibs reserves yesterday.

<TEXT>
SCOTTISH football's longest-running dispute will stagger on a little
longer, to Thursday, April 13, before a decision will be made on the
compenstion row between Kilmarnock and Celtic.
It was expected the panel, chaired by Lord Ranald McLean, would issue
a ruling yesterday after having considered the submissions of both
clubs.
Fergus McCann, Celtic's managing director, still claims his club's
innocence despite the Scottish League's imposition of a #100,000 fine
after the club had been found guilty of enticing Tommy Burns away from
Kilmarnock.
This is the first time the SFA have used the arbitration panel and it
will be important to make sure everything is done properly and that both
parties are comfortable with what is being done.
Burns was appointed at Celtic Park way back on July 12 of last year
and Kilmarnock are claiming around #300,000 in compensation for the loss
of their manager and his assistant Billy Stark.
The SFA yesterday issued a brief statement saying: ''The tribunal met
and heard submissions from both clubs with regard to the procedure which
should be followed at the final hearing which has been set for April
13.''

DUNDEE United's Brian Welsh has been banned by the SFA for tonight's
premier division match against Hearts at Tannadice. And the defender is
just one booking away from being hit by a new suspension as United
continue their fight for survival in the big time.
The club yesterday were told by the SFA that Welsh had picked up the
equivalent of a red card for swearing at referee Hugh Dallas as the
teams left the field after the weekend defeat by Motherwell.
That offence brought an automatic, one-game ban for tonight and also
brings Welsh to a disciplinary points total of 13 -- just three short of
a new suspension.
Tannadice coach Gordon Wallace said that Welsh will also be hammered
for his outburst under United's disciplinary code. ''This is a blow,''
said Wallace, ''but we have just got to get on with it the best way we
can.
''This is a home game for us and we have be determined to show a more
positive approach. That is what we have been working on in training.
''The sooner we add to our points total the better and we realise the
responsibility for this falls between myself, the coaching staff, and
players.''
Mark Perry or Christian Dailly could fill in for Welsh.

* FRANKIE Dettori will bid for his first success in the William Hill
Lincoln on either Penny Drops or Country Lover at Doncaster on Saturday.
The champion jockey was originally due to ride last year's third,
Wainwright, for Sheikh Mohammed but was snapped up by Lord Huntingdon
when that horse was withdrawn by John Gosden at yesterday's acceptance
stage.
Dettori's agent Matty Cowling said: ''Frankie will ride Penny Drops if
it runs, otherwise he will be on Country Lover.''
Country Lover, 10-1 second favourite with the sponsors, has not run
since he finished fifth in a Listed race at Bordeaux last September.
The four-year-old is now 8-1 clear favourite (from 12-1) with
Ladbrokes.
Gardner Merchant Mile winner Penny Drops has top weight off 9st 10lb
and may be rerouted to Thursday's Stones Bitter Doncaster Mile. If that
was the case, then the Lincoln weights would rise by 7lb.
A total of 82 stood their ground for the #50,000-added race at
yesterday's acceptance stage.

CELTIC manager Tommy Burns yesterday dismissed continuing speculation
about his under-21 internationalist, Brian O'Neil, who has been
outstanding since he was converted to a central defender this season.
Reports linking O'Neil, who already has had talks with Burns about a
new contract, with southern clubs do not impress the Parkhead manager
who said: ''There is no doubt we'll fix up Brian before the end of the
season. He wants to play for Celtic and Celtic have to pay the going
rate, like everyone else.''
O'Neil's contract ends in June and there have been indications that
the negotiations have hit snags but Burns believes that it would be in
the player's own interests to sign again at Parkhead.
''I wouldn't foresee him playing anywhere else just now. If I was him
I would be trying to establish myself with Celtic, rather than widening
horizons at this stage. He can go on to achieve great things but I
believe it would be better to do that in an environment which is
secure,'' said Burns.
O'Neil is one of a handful of players whose contracts Burns hopes to
renew in the next few weeks. The 22-year-old will be absent from the
team to meet Kilmarnock at Rugby Park tonight as he begins a two-match
suspension.
The chances are that the Albanian, Rudi Vata, will get a chance to
please the gaffer with an appearance at some stage. Vata is one of the
few seasoned players on the staff who has not been given an opportunity
to stake his claim for a first team place. ''He had problems with
injuries but has worked hard and definitely is in contention.''
Victory for Celtic would put them ahead of Hibs, although the
Edinburgh side could reverse that by beating Motherwell tomorrow, and
Burns believes that it is still within his team's capabilities to win
the cup and finish second in the table.
No-one has appreciated the good news that has been emerging from
Tynecastle in recent weeks more than a man who has had to sit and watch,
rather than join in the fun.
Craig Levein, who has spent a great deal of time this season in the
stand as result of two different suspensions, will get his chance to
rejoin the party tonight when Hearts take on Dundee United at Tannadice.
The Hearts and Scotland defender has suffered a severe punishment,
rightly so, albeit for an uncharacteristic involvement in a brawl with
former team-mate Graeme Hogg in a friendly with Raith Rovers last
summer, but has now wiped the slate clean and is ready to resume normal
service.
Levein was suspended automatically for one game after that piece of
retaliation but then was banned for 10 games by the SFA, who also added
12 penalty points to his record.
When he returned, Levein had to attempt to steer clear of yellow
cards, otherwise he knew that a further two-game ban was in the
pipeline. He managed that for seven games but a trip on Celtic's Brian
McLaughlin cost him a booking -- and another absence.
He missed the cup win over Dundee United as well as Saturday's defeat
of Rangers but is now eager to get into his maroon shirt again. ''I was
worried about Saturday's game being postponed,'' he said, ''because that
would have meant me missing out tonight.
''With no games this weekend, I would then have had to go into the cup
semi-final without a first-team match in five weeks. Now, I have a
chance to get started earlier. It's amazing how one lapse in a friendly
can follow you right through the season.''
Levein confessed that he found it very difficult during that period
when one booking would put him on the sidelines again. ''It was murder.
As a defender, it is hard to avoid cautions and I had to make sure I
tackled with 100% concentration, but now at least the pressure has been
removed and I can start from scratch.''
The defender is also back on schedule to resume his international
career and that is likely to mean a place in the team next week in
Moscow.
One man who would have been a contender for that game, too, is
team-mate John Robertson but he suffered a knee injury on Saturday and
is almost certainly out of the team tonight. Others are likely to join
him, like Brian Hamilton, Colin Miller, Fraser Wishart, and Kevin
Thomas, while Dave McPherson and Neil Berry are doubtful.
So stretched are Hearts that coach Eamonn Bannon, who has been turning
out for the reserves, is on stand-by.

THE Yemeni government are ready to declare a ''Naz day'' for their
most famous sportsman. If Prince Naseem Hamed fights for a world title
in the Yemen, it will be made a public holiday to allow the locals to
watch it.
Hamed and his promoter Frank Warren were in a party of 20 who flew out
yesterday and the project will be discussed with President Ali Abdullah
Salah.
The Sheffield-born fighter of Yemeni parentage will defend his WBC
international super-bantamweight title at Shepton Mallett on May 6 while
he waits for a world-title shot at Puerto Rican WBA champion Wilfredo
Vasquez.
Hamed's showmanship has been compared to Chris Eubank but ''Naz''
insisted: ''Chris showed his limitations against (Steve) Collins. I
don't think he's got the ability to go with his confidence. I have the
ability to go with my confidence.''
Eubank's promoter, Barry Hearn, yesterday denied that the middleweight
has severe financial problems -- but hinted that a rematch with Collins
could be on the cards.
Hearn said: ''(Nigel) Benn, Eubank, and Collins are going to be three
of the biggest earners in the sport. You can perm any two from three,
which means that you could see some very, very big fights over the next
12 months.''
Collins would love to make his first defence at Dublin's Croke Park in
the summer and will have talks with Hearn, who is also his promoter.
That defence seems likely to be against the French European champion,
Frederic Seillier, in May.

TERRY Venables took a stand against the sleaze factor yesterday when
he left England midfield player Paul Ince out of the squad for next
week's friendly international against Uruguay at Wembley.
The England coach has also dropped Southampton's Matt Le Tissier,
Arsenal striker Ian Wright, and QPR's Les Ferdinand as he makes sweeping
changes in the wake of the ill-fated game in Dublin.
Liverpool youngster Jamie Redknapp is included in the senior squad for
the first time and Newcastle's Barry Venison is recalled.
But the most controversial decision is the omission of Ince four days
before he appears with fellow Manchester United player Eric Cantona in
front of Croydon magistrates to answer assault charges following
incidents at Selhurst Park in January.
Venables included Dennis Wise last month even though he knew he was
facing assault and criminal damage charges a few days later following an
affray with a taxi driver outside Venables' London club.
The Chelsea winger was withdrawn from the ill-fated game in Ireland
only after he was convicted.
Subsequently, he has been sentenced to three months' imprisonment and
freed on bail while he appeals but he is currently injured so has been
omitted from the squad.
With Ince, Venables has acted to avoid a repeat embarrassment. But the
United player plans to plead not guilty and his case could be adjourned
to the summer, leaving the England coach open to the accusation he has
prejudged the issue.

EDINBURGH Racers have had a #5000 fine cancelled and five
premier-division points restored as the British Ice Hockey Association
decided yesterday that the club had not breached wage-capping rules
after all.
News of the about-turn by the sport's top officials came just hours
before an appeal hearing -- involving other clubs similarly punished by
the BIHA -- takes place today in Bournemouth.
However, Racers are not satisfied with the outcome, and believe that
the episode has cost them money.
Responding to the news, Racers' director Stuart Robertson revealed:
''The BIHA made this public last week and we feel we've suffered
financial loss because of adverse publicity.
''I also have a letter from one of our sponsors this season, who is
reviewing his interest in light of the publicity we received.
''The matter is now in the hands of our solicitors, and they'll decide
if we take it further.''
A BIHA spokesman said that four other clubs who all were handed out
the same punishment as Racers -- premier-division leaders Sheffield
Steelers, their closest rivals Nottingham Panthers, last season's
champions Cardiff Devils, and first-division outfit Guildford Flames --
were expected to appear at today's hearing.
He added: ''The league auditors, having processed all relevant
information, found that Edinburgh Racers had not breached wage-capping
guidelines.''

TOM Brewster concluded another successful day for Scottish teams at
the world junior championships in Perth yesterday.
The man from Lockerbie recorded a 6-3 victory against Canada to stand
alone at the top of the men's rankings with a 100% record, having
earlier defeated Denmark 7-3.
In her two games yesterday, Scotland's women's skip, 16-year-old Julia
Ewart, beat Japan 12-1 and followed that up with a hard-fought 5-3
victory over Switzerland.
At the end of the second day of round-robin play, both Scottish teams
remain undefeated and look set for the weekend's knock-out sections.

BEFORE the World Cup opens in Cape Town on May 25 it is essential that
the pool of referees seeks uniformity in the way in which they officiate
and, in particular, where moving mauls and players on the ground are
concerned.
One has much sympathy with referees, especially those at international
level, who have to aim at a compromise of virtually opting out of some
law provisions in order to provide longer spells of moving action. They
also have to deal nowadays with aggressive old soldiers who use what is
termed their street-wisdom to gain unfair advantage and who, in
increasing numbers nowadays, aim to intimidate officials either by clear
expression of disagreement with decisions or almost by trying to referee
the game themselves. That is one area in which referees should take a
stronger and united stand, with a clear message to players to cut the
cackle.
One clear example of lack of uniformity was in the situation that led
to Peter Wright being shown a yellow card. I had some sympathy with the
Boroughmuir prop. They certainly would laugh their heads off in New
Zealand at such a decision, for down there anyone lying on the wrong
side of the ball and not trying to move away is given the shoe
treatment. Even backs have been known to do it.
Will Carling was illegally blocking Scottish clearance. Wright merely
did what is commonplace in the modern game. He aimed to post a physical
reminder to Carling not to go over the ball illegally and block it off.
While players take a dim view of being kicked, they accept as part of
the game that in such circumstances they might be walked on or even
rucked outwith the ball. The clear instruction to players, however, is
that they must go for the ball and not solely for the player.
Clearly Brian Stirling, the Belfast referee, wanted to make a point
early while dampening the fires in a tension-laden contest. The player
who should be penalised, however, is the one who makes no attempt to get
away from an illegal blocking position on the ground. If those players
are not dealt with by the referee, they surely will come in for some
form of treatment from opponents. In New Zealand, where rucking first
made an appearance, little sympathy is extended to the one who is
''shoed''. Referees, however, must be aware of the possibility of
dangerous play.
World Cup officials also must make up their minds about how they are
going to deal with the rolling maul. Jim Telfer does have a point that
this form of slow, grinding progress does limit the spectacle, as
increasing close-quarter work at the expense of handling spreads. It
could be argued, of course, that big men should be able to take
advantage of their size and that maul driving is one method of sucking
in opposing defenders, thus giving more encouragement to backs to run
subsequent delivery.
But there is an element of unfairness in that if, in a big heavy pack,
the ball-carrier can be completely blocked off by colleagues not only at
the side and behind but more so by a solid screen of pals in front of
him, there is virtually no way of arresting them legally. If defenders
seek infiltration by boring in from the side, they can be penalised
because of the ruling that a maul or ruck can be joined only level with
or behind the rear feet. In olden times defenders just took the maul
down but, in the interests of safety, that now is deemed illegal.
Just how hard it is to cope with maul driving or rolling by a massive
pack was demonstrated when England rumbled forward some 15 metres
against Wales for Victor Ubogu to roll off the edge for a smash-over
try. It was to the credit of Scotland's forwards that they didn't allow
the English pack that particular luxury.
It was recommended to referees at the start of this season that those
players who take up stance in front of the ball-carrier, sometimes to
pull him forward, should be penalised as obstructionist. But here, too,
there has been a lack of uniformity in approach so that screening the
ball-carrier has become something of an art form at which, and Brian
Moore may care to check on this, his own colleagues, and especially Tim
Rodber and Dean Richards, are past masters.
Few things annoy players more than being penalised by one referee for
something that another ignores. That is one reason why nowadays an
important element of team preparation is to study the method of the
referee of the day.
So World Cup officials must put their heads together in order to seek
uniformity. That surely would reduce those occasions when players try to
lead the referee along the paths of righteousness -- as they see it!
' In New Zealand, little sympathy is extended to the one who is shoed.

WALES coach Alan Davies and team manager Rob Norster face the sack
next week -- unless they decide to bring their four-year reign to an end
voluntarily.
They and assistant coach Gareth Jenkins are expected to be axed when
the committee that recommends on coaching appointments meets next Monday
night.
Their fate was virtually sealed yesterday when WRU secretary Edward
Jones announced that selection of the World Cup squad, scheduled for
Wednesday, has been ''postponed for a short while.''
The delay was to allow the WRU's general committee to discuss the
national side's recent performances -- which reached the lowest ebb with
Saturday's wooden-spoon defeat by Ireland -- and a selection row which
blew up in the aftermath.
Davies said: ''I have been informed by the WRU that they do not wish
the selectors to meet this week to choose the World Cup party. I am
waiting to hear further when they wish us to proceed.''
But it is clear that unless the trio step down, the decision will be
taken for them when the National Player Development Committee meets next
Monday to discuss Wales' disastrous Five Nations Championship
performance.
Last Saturday's 16-12 defeat in Cardiff condemned Wales, last season's
champions, to only their second wooden-spoon whitewash. Davies also
became the first coach to preside over five successive defeats. Wales
managed just one try in the championship and it was clear he lost the
confidence of the players.
And following a row over the side chosen to face Ireland, former
full-back J P R Williams, the country's most capped player, quit as a
selection adviser.

WILL Carling's ambition for the European season has been achieved with
the Grand Slam and now he is looking to the world stage.
England entered the 1991 World Cup on their own turf as Grand Slam
champions and reached the final.
But Carling, who will lead his country for the fiftieth time in South
Africa, pledged: ''We have more confidence and self-belief. We are in a
better shape to make a real challenge for the big prize. Four years ago
we were happy just to be in the final. If we get there in June, we will
regard being in the final as a job only half done.
''Given the conditions and a certain type of referee, we could be
dynamic.''
But England's worry is that they will be as thoroughly messed about by
Argentina and Italy in the pool matches as they were by Scotland in
Saturday's tryless contest. Their other pool opponents -- Western Samoa
-- also will mount a ferocious defence, even if without cynicism.
Hooker Brian Moore accused Scotland of ''repeatedly killing the ball''
-- the Scots were penalised 21 times -- but the Italians managed to
concede the notoriously grim total of 38 penalties when they played
England in the 1991 World Cup, killing the ball stone dead at every
point of contact. Argentina are masters at lingering offside to cut down
all options when their opponents win the ball.
It is a problem that England must solve, because they will need those
pool matches to develop a style before they run into the big boys --
either South Africa or Australia.
There were no tries on Saturday, but tries are a must in the World
Cup, as England cannot rely solely on the golden boot of Rob Andrew.

OWEN and Martin Brennan should make another winning visit to Newcastle
today courtesy of Cash Chase in the 'Tip-Top Timeform Ratings' Handicap
Hurdle.
The father-and-son trainer-and-jockey combination landed a 16-1 double
on the course on Saturday, highlighted by Strath Royal's success in the
Arthur Stephenson Memorial Chase.
That made it three wins in two days for Martin since his comeback from
injuries sustained in a fall from the same horse at Doncaster earlier in
the month.
He can make a swift return to the winner's enclosure on Cash Chase,
who ran a fine race from a long way out of the handicap behind Champion
Hurdle runner-up Large Action at Nottingham last month.
That performance was no flash in the pan as the mare had earlier won
in good style at Uttoxeter and Market Rasen and is developing into a
useful hurdler.
Mary Reveley's Mr Woodcock looks the answer to the 'Bet-Compelling
Timeform Commentaries' Handicap Chase.

NICK Farr-Jones, who led Australia to World Cup triumph against
England in 1991, rates Scotland among the top six nations in the world
after having watched Saturday's Grand Slam decider at Twickenham.
Farr-Jones praised England's achievement but also had words to
encourage the Scots. He said: ''Scotland have performed admirably in
1995 and played at Twickenham with the sort of tremendous passion that
should carry them a long way in the World Cup.
''I believe they have now developed into a third-tier nation alongside
France -- that's with Australia and England at the top, and New Zealand
and South Africa just behind.''
Bookmakers rate the Scots as 25-1 outsiders for the World Cup, but
Farr-Jones puts them in the same bracket as France, who are fifth
favourites at 7-1.
Gregor Townsend, the 21-year-old centre, believes Scotland can play
better than they did at Twickenham. ''People say we have had a
triumphant season, but it's not over yet. We're very disappointed with
our performance at Twickenham because I think we can do a lot better
than that.''
The clash with France in Pretoria on June 3 is the next big target. If
the Scots repeat their Paris victory over the French, they most likely
will avoid New Zealand and earn themselves a quarter-final tie against
either Ireland or Wales.
Scottish officials have already begun to do their homework on our Pool
rivals. Scotland A team assistant coach Hugh Campbell was in Pretoria at
the weekend to watch Northern Transvaal's 97-7 rout of the Ivory Coast.
Scotland coach Dougie Morgan said yesterday: ''It's important that we
gather as much information as possible on our pool competitors. France
are a known quantity, and we will be getting videos of Tonga taking part
in the Super Ten competition, but we felt we needed to know a bit more
about Ivory Coast.
''Team manager Duncan Paterson already has seen them in a qualifying
round. Many of the Ivory Coast players are involved in French club rugby
and, by all accounts, they are a big and physical side.''
That observation seems to be borne out by the fact that Ivory Coast
forward Bado Gilbert was suspended for 30 days after having been sent
off for head-butting Johan Ackerman in Pretoria.

PARTICK Thistle's fight against relegation could be wrecked by a
fixture pile-up. The backlog of matches means that the Jags do not know
when their season will end.
Their game against Celtic at Hampden last Saturday was called off and
now league chiefs face a headache in their efforts to rearrange the
match.
The Scottish Cup semi-finals and Scotland's European Championship
qualifying match have put the Thistle match on hold.
A league spokesman explained: ''Next midweek, Scotland are in Russia
and then there is the Celtic-Hibs cup semi-final, followed by a
rearranged league game between the same clubs at Easter Road the
following midweek, providing there is no cup replay.
''Thistle are scheduled to meet Hearts on April 4 and Dundee United on
Tuesday, April 18. The following Saturday is a clear day as Scotland
prepare for the game against San Marino.
''We will need to wait and see when we can manage to get the
Celtic-Thistle game played.''
However, there are no plans to extend the league season beyond
Saturday, May 13, even though the Scottish Cup final won't go ahead
until May 27.
The spokesman said: ''It is the job the league management committee to
ensure that all fixtures are completed in order we know who will be
involved in the play-offs as we may have to make all-ticket arrangements
for those matches.''
Thistle are bottom of the table, two points behind Aberdeen, but with
two games in hand over the Pittodrie side.

ONE victory does not make a career, as many professional golfers have
discovered to their chagrin, but it can alter perspectives dramatically.
For example, Adam Hunter's success in the Portuguese Open promoted him
from No.75 to ninth on the order of merit and from total obscurity to
seventeenth on the Ryder Cup points table.
Hunter's baptismal triumph, however, surprised even him by happening
as quickly as it did. Only last November he spent a week in Florida
working with David Leadbetter, currently golf's most fashionable coach,
on swing changes and more recently he has been advised on a fitness
programme by Paul Darby, the Wolverhampton Wanderers physiotherapist.
After he had added a 65 to his opening 73, achieved despite the fierce
winds which disrupted the first round at Penha Longa, Hunter
acknowledged: ''I had to stop just plodding along. Whether or not my
commitment will pay off remains to be seen, but already I'm happier with
my swing.''
Hunter, who had missed four cuts and finished fifty-fifth in five
outings, then took joint-seventh place in the Morocco Open. That seemed
like a promise of better times ahead and he also was more content with
his putting, using a club adopted only two weeks before and
optimistically stamped on the sole ''the fat lady swings.''
Yet the aluminium, mallet-headed putter -- a model used by Nick Price
last year when he won the US PGA title with a milled face to give a
''soft'' feel -- almost let Hunter down at the climax. Having led with a
stroke with five holes to play, Hunter three-putted the fourteenth and
sixteenth for bogeys and missed an eight-foot eagle putt at the last.
''I had done the hard work and was in control all the way. I was
gutted by those mistakes,'' Hunter confided, before he holed from five
feet to defeat Darren Clarke at the first hole of their sudden-death
play-off. ''I missed only two greens in regulation and no fairways, so I
was fairly happy.
''I've done a lot of work on my game because my swing was not standing
up under pressure and it's still not quite right,'' Hunter added --
rather prematurely given the subsequent outcome. ''And I was so unfit
that it took me three months to reach the point where Paul Darby's
exercises were becoming effective.''
Unlike Paul Lawrie and Andrew Coltart, who have enlisted the help of
mind-readers with respectively a consultant and a book, Hunter has not
engaged the services of a sports psychologist. The likelihood of adding
another counsellor to the two whose advice has already been so fruitful
seems improbable.
Lawrie's team, by contrast, consists of his coach, Jim Farmer, his
brother- in-law, for fitness and diet, and Richard Cox, the Scottish
rugby international squad's adviser on the power of positive thinking.
Their combined efforts have not yet led to a tour victory but some
consistency has developed this year.
Although Lawrie had missed three cuts in five tournaments, his two
other placings were twelfth and sixteenth. He finished tenth equal on
Sunday and the Aberdonian, whose wife Marian expects their first child
in four weeks, was pleased to have finished six under par after having
started with a 75 in the same rough weather as Hunter experienced.
Indeed, Lawrie's resilience was underlined when he recovered from
having started with two bogeys after he pulled both drives into bunkers.
And Gordon Brand Jr performed a similar recovery to the two others, six
under par for the last three rounds after he had taken 76 in the first
round.
Hunter's achievement means that three Scottish professionals (the
others being Colin Montgomerie and Sam Torrance) are in the first 20 on
the order of merit. Otherwise this season has provided their compatriots
with short commons, for only Lawrie (No.71), Brand (73), Dean Robertson
(83), and Stephen McAllister (98) are among the first 100 on the list.

SCOTLAND's women got the perfect boost before launching their bid for
a third successive home international title in Ballymoney, Northern
Ireland, today when they picked up two British titles yesterday.
The Scots claimed the pairs and triples championships and only a late
slump in the fours prevented them from completing a hat trick of
championships.
Jan Woodley led the way with a runaway win in the pairs. Woodley, and
West of Scotland clubmate Angie Baird coasted to the title with a 32-6
win over the English champions Joan Hill and Janet Tester.
The opening six ends yielded five singles and a double that put the
Scots 5-2 ahead but then a run of 3, 5, 3, and 1 pushed them 17-2 in
front and virtually tied up the title.
In the triples Falkirk's mother-and-daughter pair Maureen and Vikki
Leishman and Roberta Hutchison made a great start in their match with
Betty Morgan's Welsh side and opened up an 8-0 lead after four ends.
However, the Scots counted just two more singles over the next 10 ends
and the Welsh trio recovered to tie things up at 10-10 with four ends to
play.
Falkirk regained the initiative with a count of 3 on the next end and
singles over the last three took them to a 16-10 win.
The Galleon rink of Jeanette McCreath, Ann Gilmour, Dorren Jeffrey,
and Jean McFedries, looked poised for a successful defence of their
fours title when they led Rita Jones' Welsh rink 15-12 with four ends to
play but in an amazing slump the Scottish side lost 1, 5, 3 and 2 to
lose 15-23.
The singles title went to England's Mary Price, who beat Welsh
champion Doreen Rowlands 21-18.

* FALKIRK chairman George Fulston could be invited to stand before the
SFA and justify remarks made after the Brockville side's match against
Kilmarnock was called off last Saturday, but he won't flinch. He never
does.
Fulston didn't like the way referee Martin Clark conducted an
inspection of the pitch and said so with typical candour.
When there is something on his mind Fulston speaks, regardless of the
consequences, as chief sports writer JAMES TRAYNOR discovers in
conversation with Fulston, a tough football man who lets no-one take
advantage.
WILLINGLY, he would have ridden shotgun with John Wayne in Stagecoach
or been at the shoulder of Gary Cooper as he wandered down to the OK
Corral. George Fulston believes he should have been a cowboy. Some,
especially the more sensitive souls who have been left trembling in his
wake, would insist he is.
Fulston, who jumped horses when he resigned his chairmanship of
Hamilton to purchase Falkirk, is a polite enough individual but a hectic
schedule leaves him little time to tip-toe around egos or play
football's interminable political game.
The 49-year-old is straightforward and at times blunt, but he makes no
excuses. That's the best way to be in his part of the world. Those who
know Blantyre will understand that and those who don't are advised to
stay away. Affected accents and open displays of aloofness are bad
attitudes in what used to be known as Lanarkshire's Tombstone.
Plain speaking is all that is asked there and Fulston is happy to
oblige leaving no-one in any doubt where he stands on a variety of
matters which can include football, of course, politics, social values,
and people in general.
''There are too many wahoos around, especially in our game,'' he says.
''You can always tell them because they have handshakes which feel as
though an eel is slipping out of your grasp and they can't look you in
the eye.
''And this talk recently of secret meetings and league reconstruction?
I'll talk to anybody about reconstruction, but let's do it openly.''
Fulston puts in anything between 60 and 80 hours a week, but there are
still some places in football where the working man isn't welcome.
''No-one leaves Falkirk's boardroom feeling they haven't had a good time
but to tell you the truth there are one or two boardrooms in the country
in which I can sense I am not welcome,'' he said.
''It doesn't bother me and neither do the people who come down from
Huntly or up from Dumfries to attend SFA of Scottish League meetings in
Glasgow and are then allowed to go to a Scotland game with a free ticket
a couple of times a season. No harm in that, but the other stuff gets
me.
''You know, the inner sanctum, what I call the blazered brigade, the
entourage with international teams. And, as for the team? Don't you
think we have too many internationalists who think they are players?
That saddens me because I'm a supporter.''
It is precisely this kind of uncompromising stance which tends to make
others flinch when they see Fulston, a character who is large in all
senses, approach. They simply don't know what he is liable to say or how
he will react to certain suggestions or proposals, but if he is anything
it is committed to making Falkirk a force. He is also determined to take
the club to a new stadium.
There aren't too many willing to force an issue with an opponent who
stands 6ft tall and weighs in at around 18 stones and Fulston's presence
can also help give footballers, some of whom are notorious prima donnas,
a proper perspective.
''Jim Jefferies wanted to do some spring cleaning with the team and he
brought in the Kirks and McGrillens and only recently Maurice Johnston,
who I believe will do a real job for us while there are others who think
that he won't,'' Fulston said.
''Now, having spend 12 years at Hamilton where our backs were always
to the wall and where sometimes it was a struggle to pay the wages I was
serving a good apprenticeship which might one day make me a good
tradesman in this business, but I feel I have watched enough football to
know a player.
''Besides, Maurice is married to a wee Blantyre girl and he can't kid
me, so, after he signed for us, I just said to him, 'give us any
nonsense and you'll get one of these.' ''
He made a fist, a big one too, of his right hand as he spoke and left
no doubt about his intention. ''We all want to stay in the top division
and see the club move into a new ground,'' he said. ''Brockville is a
tired old lady now and we are working in partnership with the district
council in the hope of building a new ground, which would be the centre
of a leisure complex, on a site near the motorway.''
The chairman reckons the stadium would cost in the region of #5.5m,
but he wants a complex which could be used seven days a week and become
a focus for the community, especially the young people. ''They need
somewhere to go, a sense of direction and if any of us can help them get
on then we have a duty to do so,'' he insists.
''Also, football doesn't do enough to attract youngsters and if the
football club is part of a facility which caters for as many sports as
possible we would surely benefit. Better to have a drip off the roast
than nothing at all.''
It is peculiar that Fulston can be so relaxed in his dealings with the
local councillors -- ''They have been very helpful so far,'' he said --
because, generally, politicians exasperate him. ''It doesn't matter who
they are or what their politics are because when in power they don't
work for you in any case.''
Fulston owns a forklift truck company which he operates along with his
son, Clark -- ''a dour, but bright big bugger'' -- and his daughters
Sarah and Clare also help out. Frequently, the boss pulls on his
overalls and picks up his tools.
''Christ, I'm not a bad engineer,'' he claims, but you suspect he
likes to get his hands dirty as though doing so provides some kind of
therapy.
Hard work has never scared Fulston, although he admits to fatigue
after six months of trying to keep on top of his business as well as
address Falkirk's problems. ''The problems here were massive,'' he says
as he looks around Brockville's boardroom before pointing to the
ceiling.
''You know when I came in here there was one light hanging from that
ceiling and only one bulb was working, but even that was flickering. It
was appropriate. The club was in the dark.''
Fulston rewired the boardroom himself and also helped lay concrete
below the dug-out area -- in fact, he concluded the negotiations which
brought Steve Fulton from Bolton to Falkirk while standing in his
working clothes -- but that's his style. He believes a person only gets
out what he puts in and if that is true the Falkirk experience, which so
far has cost the Fulston family about #600,000, ultimately will be a
rewarding one.
''I love it all, the tension, the pressures, and even the growling of
the players before they run out of the tunnel,'' he said. ''I'll tell
you this, we lost our shipyards and our mines and now we are losing our
Celtic spirit, but if the country had the same attitude as these players
we would have the most buoyant economy in Europe.''
Fulston operates with a small board of three members, himself, David
Morton, and David Bayne, and on the basis that a good meeting is
conducted when any two of the three don't show up, and it is a system
which seems to be working well. People always know where they stand with
Falkirk's chairman, who has never lost touch with the game's supporters.
He couldn't, of course, because he is one himself.
He is wealthy -- ''Maybe, but you can't eat paper'' -- yet his idea of
a night out is a pint with his friends in Blantyre. ''The miners'
welfare there is the best place around,'' he says without hint of a
smile. ''I'm telling you, that's the place to go and I can mix it with
the best of them there.''
Any time at home he spends watching old black-and-white Westerns
which, apart from football, is his passion. ''I could watch them all day
and night if I had the time because they are good and there isn't any
filth in them,'' he said. ''I sometimes think I'd like to have been a
cowboy.''
That, of course, brings us back to where we came in. Where he will
walk out is anybody's guess, but you can be sure he won't leave his work
in football unfinished. When challenged tough guys don't walk away.

THE biggest news imaginable in US sport occurred last Saturday when
Michael Jordan announced his return to basketball.
Jordan was the superstar player for the Chicago Bulls who quit a
year-and-a-half ago to begin a career playing baseball for the Chicago
White Sox.
Unfortunately, Jordan's baseball skills were nowhere near those he
displayed on the basketball court and he was confined to ignominious
positions in two of the White Sox minor-league farm teams.
While he toiled away at his new sport, his team-mates were as
diplomatic as one would expect. Now that he has departed, a sense of
their true feelings is becoming known.
Gene Lamont, manager of the White Sox, commented: ''I'm a baseball
guy, and it's a privilege to play. Michael didn't want to play. As a
fan, I'd rather see him play basketball. It makes things a lot easier
for our chain of command. We won't have to hear about Michael being
ahead of somebody he shouldn't be.''
Such comments are generally dismissed as sour grapes. Jordan's return
to basketball is having such an impact that it even caused a ripple on
the Stock Market. The McDonald's hamburger chain is one of Jordan's
sponsors. As soon as the news was announced, McDonald shares began a
distinct upward climb. Those with stock in the Chicago White Sox
witnessed no corresponding movements.
Unhappily, Jordan failed to hit the winning note when he ended his
21-month absence from basketball at the weekend. The 32-year-old was
unable to inspire the Chicago Bulls as Indianapolis Pacers secured a
103-96 victory after overtime.
* YOU could say that the tyres used in Sunday's Indy Car race in
Australia's Gold Coast already had plenty of miles on them before the
event had even began. Goodyear had to send about 1200 tyres Down Under
especially for the race.
The first batch of 180 tyres were sent from the plant in Brookpart,
Ohio, via air at a cost of $100 apiece. They got there in just a few
days. Goodyear, evidently, did not want to incur that kind of cost for
the remaining 1051 tyres.
Instead, they were sent by lorry from Brookpart to Norfolk, Virginia,
where they were loaded on to a ship bound for Brisbane. There they were
loaded on to another lorry which drove them the final leg of the journey
to the Gold Coast resort of Surfers Paradise. Total travelling time? 44
days.

FARMERS may be taking a special interest in their field boundaries
over the next few weeks as they comply with a Scottish Office request to
provide up-to-date maps of their holdings, identifying every field and
giving it a unique identification name or number,
There are estimated to be 700,000 fields in Scotland and by May 15
each one should have been registered with the Scottish Office
agriculture department.
The exercise is part of a European Union plan to combat fraud by
eliminating the possibility of two farmers each claiming grant for the
same piece of land.
The practice is not believed to be rife in Scotland and any instances
which have occurred are generally regarded as having been accidental.
That is not the case throughout the EU member states, however. There
have been occasions in the past where the area for which grant claims
were lodged was actually greater than the area of the country concerned.
In future that possibility should be eliminated by use of the
intensive mapping system and the allocation of individual identity
numbers to each field. These numbers will require to be quoted on claims
forms for support under the various aid schemes. All returns will be
scanned by computer and any duplicated claims will automatically trigger
a call for further investigation.
A Scottish Office spokesman said that the EU was insisting on strict
compliance with the new regulations in view of the large amounts of
money involved in farming support. ''They want to ensure that there are
adequate control mechanisms in place and we would support that
absolutely,'' he said. ''This is public money.''
Once the major mapping exercise has been completed it will be
regularly updated to take account of any boundary changes which may have
occurred.
The annual exercise of making grant applications under the Integrated
Administration and Control System -- IACS -- is now under way and most
farmers will receive their forms by the middle of this week. The
Scottish Office have emphasised that forms must be returned by ,May 15,
after which penalties will be progressively applied. The final cut-off
date is June 5 and applications received after that will be rejected.
With the various arable and livestock schemes expected to be worth
around #350m to Scottish farmers this year there are significant amounts
of money involved. The average arable payment last year was #20,000 and
the top payment was #340,000. ''We have little or no discretion as far
as penalties are concerned,'' warned an agriculture department official.
Last year a small number of farmers suffered penalties for late
application but no one failed to meet the final June deadline. Scottish
Office agriculture minister, Sir Hector Monro, urged farmers to tackle
this year's form-filling in the same business-like way as they have done
in previous years. ''The form-filling, unpopular though it is, is
necessary and the time taken to complete forms accurately is very well
spent,'' he said.
Farmers applying only for sheep annual premium need not make an IACS
return but the Scottish Office have warned: ''You must be absolutely
certain that you are only going for SAP. If you discover by July that
you want to apply for something else it will be too late.''

<TEXT>
THE Scottish Office Agriculture Minister, Sir Hector Monro, yesterday
welcomed the launch of a new database on farming and rural practices as
a means of counteracting some of the anti-farming attitudes being
promoted among young people.
''A number of lobbyists, who do not have our interests at heart, are
doing their level best to infiltrate our schools and community
organisations,'' he told a largely farming audience at Ingliston, near
Edinburgh, at the launch of the Scottish Farm and Countryside Education
Trust's new database for schools. The information is available on a
random access memory compact disc -- CD ROM.
Sir Hector said it was very important that school pupils would be able
to use the material on disc to study current ''hot'' topics such as
animal welfare or conservation.
''It is vital that young people of today are given the opportunity to
study and understand the complex inter-relationships which exist between
man and his environment,'' he said.
''They will have the opportunity to see how farming has shaped the
landscape, how land use is determined by geographical factors, how
weather affects crop yields, why there are so many specialist breeds of
livestock?''
The CD database has been compiled with the financial help of the Bank
of Scotland who put up #15,000 sponsorship. The new system, which is
geared for use with Macintosh computers, will be tested in Lothian
schools over the next few months. It is hoped that the disc will be
available to all Scottish schools from August, in time for the start of
the new school year.
The information on the database is specifically targeted at pupils
studying standard grade geography but it is regarded as being suitable
for use by older primary school pupils and by senior secondary pupils
who may be studying agriculture as part of a specialist project.
Yesterday also marked a change of name for the trust, which was
formerly known as the Scottish Association for Agriculture. As part of
its remit it organises farm visits for school pupils and also runs a
schools challenge which invites students, individually or in groups, to
submit projects on specific farming and rural topics.

A BUSINESS advice and information network launched in Glasgow
yesterday could provide an example to the rest of Scotland, it was said
at the opening.
The Glasgow Business Shop Network will give guidance to new and
established businesses. The network is centred on a new city shop in
Bothwell Street but nine other business advice centres are spread around
the city.
The Glasgow Development Agency, Glasgow City Council, Glasgow Chamber
of Commerce and Strathclyde Regional Council formed a partnership to
provide unified business support services, such as start-up guidance, UK
and European legislation, marketing, finance and technical issues.
Information is offered from a wide variety of sources -- public and
private, national and international. Similar networks have been set up
in other parts of Scotland by Scottish Enterprise.
The editor of The Herald, Mr George McKechnie, officially launched the
new information network at the Bothwell Street office yesterday.
He said: ''Today we are welcoming an initiative that seeks to assist
and improve the present and future economic growth, not only of Glasgow,
but west, central Scotland and Scotland itself.
''It has been described as a super signposting service supporting the
business inquirer that enables he or she to understand where the best
assistance, support and advice can be provided.''
Mr McKechnie added that The Herald had been in the business of
providing information since it was established in 1783.
He added: ''Would we use a business shop for advice, for direction? If
we thought someone there could provide us with a piece of information
that would help our business, we would not be too proud to ask.''
He said the partnership approach in Glasgow was encouraging and would
help to develop a service suited to the needs of the customers.
Businessmen from one company that has already benefited from sound
business advice were also at the launch.
Mr Brian Duffy, technical director of Easterhouse-based Dakon
Electronics, said he went to Glasgow Opportunities, in West George
Street, for advice before starting the company two years ago. He
described himself then as ''young, naive and very inexperienced''. Dakon
is now a leading electronics firm and is set to launch some innovative
products on the market.
He said: ''From day one, all new or young businesses require the
benefit of many years' experience if they are to survive in this world.
Support is required, not only in financial terms -- although this is
very important -- but also in terms of good solid business advice in all
the areas a new business needs it.
''Through the huge wealth of experience available through all the
support agencies in the city, Dakon has been able to thoroughly examine
and form its plans in the great detail necessary.
''Scotland has a long and good history of being inventive,
enterprising and industrial. There is a huge wealth of viable business
ideas out there, capable of providing many new jobs and regenerating the
local economy.
''Through the setting up of the Business Shop Network, new and
existing businesses will have on hand the collective efforts of all the
support agencies in the area.''
Mr Duffy said the company was set to unveil a range of products which
could be used to track climbers lost in the hills, suspects breaching
bail conditions, children who have strayed from parents and elderly
people missing from home.
Representatives from the partnership organisations were at the Glasgow
launch.

EDINBURGH Fund Managers achieved a 40% rise in final pre-tax profits
to a record #13.7m, even though funds under management were battered by
plunging Latin-American and Asian markets.
However, managing director Iain Watt warned yesterday that, unless
share prices returned to previous highs in the near future, current year
earnings would be closer to those for the year to end-January 1994.
Respective plunges of 27% and 29% in Asia Pacific and LatAm markets
during the year to January 31 took a heavy toll on funds under
management, which fell 14% to #3437m. The two emerging regions account
for 23% of funds.
Earnings per share rose from 37.2p to 49.7p. After an unchanged final
dividend of 16p, the total payout is up 9% at 24p.
Shares in the international fund management group yesterday lost 2p to
728p.
Behind the rise in profits was a 31% increase in fund management
income to #22.3m, boosted by a full year's income from new funds in the
previous financial year.
The #136m launch last February of the Edinburgh New Tiger Trust, which
focuses on smaller quoted companies in emerging Asian countries, and
last March of the #39m Latin American-focused Edinburgh Inca Trust also
boosted fee income.
Fund management income increased from 0.55% to 0.59% of average funds
because of the higher fees resulting from the two new trusts' specialist
nature.
Chairman Colin Ross pointed out that the decline in funds under
management had arisen in spite of Edinburgh Fund Managers' success in
attracting more than #100m of net new money to manage.
While the plunges in the LatAm and Asia Pacific regions were most
spectacular, the setback also came against the backdrop of a 15% decline
in the UK market, a 7% fall in the US, an 8% setback in Continental
Europe, and a 7% slide in Japan.
However, Edinburgh Fund Managers, which won a number of investment
trust awards during the period, is relatively confident about the
outlook for world markets, believing anticipated interest rate rises
factored into share prices to be overdone.
Mr Watt, who expressed disappointment at the market-induced setback in
funds under management, was pleased to achieve net sales of unit trusts
but unhappy with the lack of new management contracts for pension funds.
Edinburgh Fund Managers, which outsourced investment administration to
the Edinburgh-based WM Company during the year, is to seek shareholders'
approval for the creation of a holding company to improve management
structure.
* EDINBURGH Oil &amp; Gas, of which Colin Ross is also chairman, raised
pre-tax profits by 15% to #185,000 in the year to December.
The company, which combated weak first-half oil prices with a 6%
increase in average production to the equivalent of 391 barrels per day,
intends to move to a full listing this spring.

PAKISTANI stockbrokers, in despair at a bear run that has sent the
Karachi Stock Exchange tumbling, have sacrificed 10 goats to try to halt
the crash.
The black goats were paraded through the trading hall of the exchange
on Sunday, a trading day in Muslim Pakistan, before having their throats
cut in the car park outside, officials said.
Turnover rose to a record 23.3 million shares after the sacrifice, but
the 100-share index fell again, 12.57 points to a 16-month trough of
1683 points.
The meat was given to the poor.

RISING pulp prices have been good news for Bunzl, the international
paper and plastics company, writes NICOLA REEVES.
Fine paper prices have risen closely in line with pulp prices which
have been boosted by stockbuilding. Increases in pulp prices have come
in quick succession with the January 1995 price of $750 per tonne
representing an increase of 92% from the trough in the fourth quarter of
1993.
From January, Bunzl saw the price of its fine papers rise across
Europe with marked increases in the UK and Italy. Volumes also rose as a
result of increased economic activity and restocking. These improved
trading conditions, coupled with internal restructuring during the past
two years, saw profits in Bunzl's Fine Paper division surge by 122% to
#13.3m on 16% higher sales of #396.7m. Margins almost doubled to 3.4%.
However, a board decision to eliminate #84.7m of goodwill arising from
the sale of Bunzl Building Supply and acquisitions pushed the group into
a pre-tax loss of #4.9m last year compared with a #55.8m profit in 1993.
Before the goodwill write-off, taxable profits were 43% higher at
#79.8m. The results benefited from a lower tax rate in the second half
of 35% compared with around 38%.
Adjusted earnings per share before the goodwill elimination rose by
45% to 12.0p. The total dividend was increased by 22% to 5.0p after a
final dividend of 3.2p.

RECORD orders for Aberdeen-based BioCuRe Holdings' diabetes products
enabled the pharmaceutical research group to cut half-time pre-tax
losses by more than two-thirds, writes IAN McCONNELL.
In the six months to end-December, turnover was up 77% on the first
half of the previous year at #2.7m. Losses were reduced from #496,000 to
#148,000.
Suffolk-based Hypoguard, which manufactures and distributes the
''Supreme'' blood glucose monitoring system for sale by agents and major
corporations, was behind the improvement.
Licensing of its older GA wipe diabetes monitoring system for
manufacture and distribution to developing countries also boosted
revenues.
BioCuRe reported steady progress with cancer treatment compound MT2,
in which the National Cancer Institute of the United States has renewed
its interest.
Shares in BioCuRe, which were floated on the Unlisted Securities
Market last year and posted a year-high of 45p, closed unchanged at 10p.
Director Richard Hardie purchased 40,000 shares at 10p yesterday, with
fellow director Michael Zanre buying 20,000.

CHARTER'S #286m acquisition of the Esab welding equipment group last
August is increasingly proving inspired, writes ANDREW WILSON.
Its contribution in the three months to December of #21.9m before
finance costs gives a hint of what is to come in the current year as the
European economies begin to motor.
In the full nine months to December (it is a truncated period as
Charter is changing its year-end into line with that of Esab), group
pre-tax profits amounted to #54.8m. There are no strictly comparable
results although chief executive Jeffrey Herbert said that earnings of
39.4p for the nine months compare with 35p of the preceding 12 months.
The Hargeaves building materials subsidiary based in the north of
England is now up for sale and is expected to realise over #30m.
Following the sale of the coal interests, including Motherwell-based
Anderson last month for #29m, Charter will have only Esab, 65.3% of the
Cape international building materials subsidiary and the Pandrol
railtrack equipment and maintenance company.
A full year of profits this year should reach #100m without too much
difficulty which would leave the shares at 795p selling at 13 times
earnings. The 1994 dividend is 18p with a 10.5p final with a total of at
least 27.5p in view for a 4.3% yield.

Dick Louden reports on a popular learning initiative which gets under
way after the four o'clock bell rings
BRUCE Malone, head teacher of St Andrew's Secondary in the east end of
Glasgow, supervised the orderly exit of pupils on to Carntyne Road. His
concern that no school crossing patrol had been allocated seemed
justified as the children weaved their way through traffic. He knew them
all by name, taking time to prevail upon one unemployed girl that it was
not too late to come back and sit one or two Highers.
Inside the school, supported study was about to begin. ''This is one
of Strathclyde region's most successful initiatives,'' Mr Malone
explained enthusiastically. ''It is part of the social strategy, it is
designed to combat disadvantage, and it has done precisely that.''
St Andrew's, with nearly 900 pupils, serves a mixed catchment area,
including a large area of priority treatment which takes in Cranhill and
parts of Ruchazie and Greater Easterhouse. Made possible by extra
funding from Strathclyde, the supported study scheme -- coordinated by
assistant head teacher Joseph McCue -- enables pupils from third year
upwards to do additional work after school under the supervision of
specialist teachers. Under a contract which they and their parents sign,
pupils can attend on one or more days, selecting from subjects which
include English, maths, chemistry, physics, biology, business studies,
art, computing and technical education.
In the words of Bruce Malone, supported study ''enhances self-esteem,
raises expectations and builds positive attitudes. In a more relaxed
atmosphere, it cements the relationship between teachers and pupils.''
Supported study at St Andrew's is not about doing homework. It is
about doing supplementary study aimed at improving performance. Much of
the time is devoted to consolidation and remedial work, though extension
exercises are also set for the most able.
In an evaluation, Learning for Yourself, commissioned by Strathclyde
region from the Quality in Education centre at Strathclyde University,
it is stated that ''one of the surprising things about the initiative is
that the impetus for attendance tends not to come from parents but from
students themselves.''
In St Andrew's, though the emphasis is on preparation for Standard
Grades and Highers, pupils have suggested that supported study should
also help them attain final learning outcomes for Scotvec modules. This
is now being done.
Learning for Yourself also highlights improved exam performance as a
result of supported study. ''In all schools with schemes operating,
there is evidence of unforeseen gains, in some individual cases quite
dramatic,'' it says. In each of the last two years, St Andrew's has
exceeded by around 25% the level of Standard Grade performance predicted
by Strathclyde's computer model and hopes that the improvement will feed
through to Highers next year.
Fifth-year pupils had no doubts about the value of supported study.
Diane Coakley, attending on two afternoons for Higher English and
Biology, said: ''The extra time and work are helpful. If you need
anything gone over, the teacher is there.''
Lynsie McDougall stays behind three days a week -- for English, maths
and office and information studies. ''I did better in my prelims because
of supported study,'' she said. ''I would recommend it to the younger
ones in school.''
Staff are equally enthusiastic. For maths teacher Jim Sharkey, ''there
is more time to become aware of weaknesses and to gain an insight into
more general difficulties which pupils are experiencing''.
St Andrew's, its roll swollen by merger with St Gregory's Secondary in
Easterhouse a few years back, may not immediately impress those who take
national tables of SCE results at face value. However, it is progressing
admirably from a challenging base.
The new local authorities which emerge next year may lack financial
flexibility, and innovative schemes will come under scrutiny. The demise
of supported study would be a tragedy. Sceptics need only visit St
Andrew's to be convinced.

SOMETIMES on Sunday night, when the old hits were being crisply
cranked out in finest glam-punk fashion, Adam stood pleasantly revealed
as the missing link between Gene Vincent, Marc Bolan and Johnny Rotten;
between James Dean and Johnny Depp.
What moody, offhand grace! What gutsy feyness! What expressive and
heroic postures, all fluttery fingers and arching eyebrows! What
preoccupied solid-gone stares into the middle-distance! What a boyish
smile for a 40-year-old! Yet what long-term future is there for Adam in
riding the 80s retro bandwagon alongside his young champions, current
contenders like Elastica and Nine Inch Nails?
Not a big one, duckie, is the answer if you judge solely by the
evidence of the newer songs on which Adam's full-scale comeback is being
staked. One such song posed an unanswerable -- and silly -- question
(''Shall we tie our shirts together and make up a sail?''). Another
sounded like a thin Madness pastiche. A dreary new ballad, Vampires,
embodied anaemic middle-aged leching rather than red-blooded teeny
lusting.
During such songs, Adam's heritage seemed less appealing . . . not so
much one of popular culture's more vital routeways, rather a minor
B-road connecting Essex -- David Essex -- with Oldham . . . sorry, that
should read ''old ham'', ie Gary Glitter.
Ah, but Adam's vintage hits sounded brilliant, and his following is a
touchingly fervent one. What was the title of one of his old hits?
Desperate But Not Serious. In 1995, Ant-music is far from desperate, but
neither is it something to get seriously worked-up about.

WONDERING glances flashed across at the empty ''stage''. ''Have we
been had?'' looks were exchanged. Shoulders were shrugged. The bar staff
gave off ''trust us'' vibes. ''9.30-ish,'' said the chalkboard, and
shortly thereafter, with a minimum of fuss, the ''stage'' (a raised part
of the backroom which had been cleared of table and chairs) was set and
the music begun.
Within ten seconds of hearing him put bow to fiddle, the Sean Maguire
initiate must wonder what on earth this stunning musician is doing
playing in the backrooms of pubs rather than full-to-capacity concert
halls. But that is the way of things and thanks be to Scruffy Murphy's
for letting us hear him play at all (and for free).
Maguire has been called the Stephane Grappelli of Irish fiddling and
his ability to embellish a tune way beyond anything suggested by the
original melody may justify that comparison. But whereas Grappelli can
be showy, Maguire, even at his most adventurous, is always direct, every
demi-semi-quaver articulated with a commitment that borders at times on
ferocity.
Guitarist Brian Collum acts as Maguire's travelling companion,
accompanist and voice (the fiddler had a speech valve fitted following
an operation some years ago), giving him a breather by singing
adequately songs such as Woody Guthrie's This Land.
Breather over, Maguire springs into a reel like a whippet after a
rabbit, his bow dusting the strings percussively. In a more relaxed
moment Tom Anderson's lovely slow air, The Resting Chair, is played with
the precision and genuine feeling of a master with so much music in him
-- surely more of us should be sharing it.

Music
SINCE it was originally meant to have been conducted by Sir Alexander
Gibson, Sunday's account of The Song of the Earth by the BBC SSO was
bound to seem like a valedictory tribute to him. But eloquent
performances even of this nature cannot be supplied on tap, and on this
occasion Mahler's great song symphony obstinately eluded the grasp of
the substitute conductor, Mark Elder, and of at least one of the two
soloists.
It was a performance, on the whole, for those who like their Mahler
dry -- not necessarily a bad thing in the post-Bernstein era. There was
no false sentiment about Elder's conducting, or about Eva Randova's
singing of the Abschied. The trouble, too often, was that there seemed
to be no sentiment at all.
Randova, sounding seriously hard-edged in all but the softest
passages, declaimed her part with the authority of a senior lecturer
addressing a class. A fine Wagnerian mezzo in her day, she relied on
firmness of voice rather than lyricism to see her through what was
clearly not one of her better evenings.
Stig Andersen, on the other hand, sang as if the words of the tenor
songs really meant something to him. He also struck a happier rapport
with Elder, who proved more at ease in the faster, spikier music than in
sustaining the flow of the slow. The orchestra, inflated to fill the
whole of the Festival Theatre's stage for this last of its concerts
entitled Mahler and More, made a splendid sight, and brought greater
conviction to the Mahler than to the More -- in this case a rather
scrappy opening account of Beethoven's Fourth Symphony.

As positive attempts to advance the cause of women meet renewed
opposition, Sara Villiers speaks to some who are pioneering a more
collaborative approach to changing female roles in the drama world
AT a point when positive discrimination favouring women is coming
under fire, it is intriguing to note that in Scottish theatrical circles
there has been an upsurge in women-centred companies, such as Diva,
Stellar Quines and Chineara.
It might seem surprising in a profession renowned for its liberal
image, but many women theatre artists are discovering that glass
ceilings do hover above the stage and sometimes the only way they can
ensure a platform for their work is to put on a show themselves.
But these are women's groups nineties style, advocating the promotion
of work by women writers, directors, designers and actresses, in
collaboration with men. One such group, Diva, debuts at the Tron this
week with Brilliant Traces, a play by American writer Cindy Lou Johnson.
Diva are up front about their intention to find an active and
articulate female voice but clearly states that this is not a separatist
one. Director Caroline Hall explains their aims: ''There was a really
huge splurge of women's writing in the seventies which was a real
watershed but things have moved on from then. I think it's important to
have a woman's voice but it does seem important that that shouldn't be
exclusive, not because it would seem slightly old-fashioned but because
it would be inverse sexism.''
As she distances herself from separatist politics I note that she is,
ironically, dressed in the stereotypical uniform of the radical feminist
-- a natty pair of dungarees. ''Oh I didn't even think about that,'' she
retorts, adding humorously, ''I thought I was looking rather stylish.''
While Hall is earnest about promoting women's work, it is not a
narrow-minded vision. ''We are very clear that we are interested in
finding an eloquent and muscular female voice, but Diva is not about
only doing plays by women and it's not about not having men in the
company.''
In this respect Diva is similar in its intentions to the
Edinburgh-based Stellar Quines, which was set up on a profit-share basis
in Autumn 1993. Following a successful touring production of Susan
Yankowitz's Night Sky, the company received project funding from The
Scottish Arts Council a year later and will stage Sue Glover's neglected
early play The Seal Life, this Autumn.
''We'd agree with Diva's agenda: we focus on women's work but do so in
collaboration with men who share that vision,'' says Morag Ballantyne,
one of the co-founders of Stellar Quines.
One difference between the two companies can be discerned in their
respective, apparently similar, titles -- Stellar Quines means Star
Women. The Quines are very much a collaborative outfit, while Diva is
more of an individual initiative, kick started by Hall.
''The name was a combination of the feminine and theatrical and also
something that was a little bit to do with me,'' Hall explains, quickly
denying that she is a prima donna. ''I'm not saying that I'm a diva but
I have worked in opera and the film Diva happens to be one of my
favourites.''
She elaborates the fact that while she is very much the driving force
behind Diva, it is not a case of: '' 'It's my company and I'll do what I
want to.' I'm trying not to make this sound terribly arrogant, but for
the moment Diva is really about the direction I want to go, but
hopefully the future of the company will open up to other women so it
won't be some egocentric exercise.''
While it was Hall's passion for Johnson's script -- an offbeat love
story set in Alaska, featuring a runaway bride and an angst-filled
recluse -- which dictated the choice of the debut production, it is very
much the shared vision of herself, designer Mark Leese, and lighting
designer Jeanine Davies, who is also involved with Stellar Quines.
The trio have worked closely together on numerous projects before.
''We do get on very well and have developed a shorthand for
communicating. We can give each other a lot of space and have a very
collaborative way of working,'' says Hall.
She regards Brilliant Traces as a brilliant choice of a debut. While
she was struck by it as a moving and challenging piece, it had the added
appeal of being a relatively inexpensive two-hander.
''That was a big advantage,'' she admits. ''I'm not very interested in
making compromises which endanger the artistic integrity of the show. We
wanted to ensure the highest standard possible of production values and
we have very high-calibre people working on the project.''
This is not an empty claim; alongside the experienced production team
Hall has secured the high-voltage pairing of one of Scotland's most
talented actresses, Fiona Bell, with Sam Graham, who makes a return to
the Scottish stage after successes in Cheek by Jowl's, As You Like It
and the Royal Shakespeare Company's Richard III.
A freelance director with an extensive network of relationships with
theatres across Scotland, Hall points out that one of things which
motivated her to set up Diva was noticing a shift in who was running
those theatres.
''It just happens that nearly all the artistic directors are currently
men. Look, things change, and I'm not in any way saying 'My God, it
shouldn't just be men running Scottish theatres', but the fact that this
is the case means that a lot of women theatre artists are in freelance
positions which does mean that they can be left out.''
She believes that companies like Diva and Stellar Quines have a shared
sense of frustration, not of grievance. ''It's about trying to find
plays which allow women to prove what they can do, which stretch and
challenge them. It's not about moaning about lack of opportunities. I
just think that moaning and complaining is such a negative channel for
your creativity,'' she says, adding firmly, ''and you should just get up
and do something about it.''
At which point she does just that, flouncing off in as un-diva like
way as possible to continue rehearsals for her opening night.

JUST now, Phyllis Nagy is riding the crest of a wave. Considered one
of the most exciting theatrical writing talents of her generation by
Stephen Daldry, artistic director of the Royal Court where she is
writer-in-residence, Nagy (pronounced ''Naj''), still in her early
thirties, had exploded on to the British theatrical scene.
With Weldon Rising, Entering Queens, and Butterfly Kiss, the
Brooklyn-born Nagy (of Hungarian-Italian descent) signalled the arrival
of a very particular, slightly surreal, poetic new voice.
Earlier this month, The Strip, her latest and most ambitious play to
date, opened at the Royal Court to reinforced critical approval.
Meanwhile, at the beginning of February, an earlier play, Disappeared,
opened at Leicester's Haymarket theatre to a shower of acclaim.
Some commentators have likened her work to Chandler or the crime
stories of Ed McBain (a writer Nagy much admires, along with Martin
Amis). Certainly Disappeared, runner-up in the 1992 Manchester Mobil
Playwrighting competition has its full share of red herrings,
unexplained character shifts and quirks of fortune. But then Nagy has
always been fascinated by the accidental -- or should we call it
incidental -- in life.
It's no coincidence that one of her pet loves is rummaging through
remaindered records and books and reading trade mags -- ''I just love
them for their lingo'', she admits.
Disappeared was the last play she wrote before leaving New York,
written during the hot and sultry summer of 1991. After that, she came
to London, fell in love and her life was from then ''upended in the most
remarkable manner''. Considering her preoccupations in Disappeared with,
among other things, flight and coincidence, Nagy herself found it
''oddly apt''. ''Coincidence or fate?'' she asks.
The question runs like a nagging sore throughout the play. Loosely
based around the true life incidences of young women who actually
disappeared in New York that year but who also, in one instance, turned
up years later with a completely new identity.
More than anything, however, Disappeared -- like Simon Donald's The
Life of Stuff -- is a play about urban desolation. In one memorable
scene, Elston Rupp, the last man to see Sarah, a young travel agent,
alive and possibly her murderer, is cross-questioned by a dour
detective.
Relating notes found in Rupp's apartment, the investigating detective
reads out what amounts to a litany of desperation for some kind of
acknowledgment, some kind of sign from another human being that will
tell him he exists.
Like the best of thrillers Disappeared keeps us guessing up to the
last, but with an added layer of mystery in the characters. You can
never be quite sure exactly what they are about. Only, in this instance,
that all are affected by Sarah's disappearance.
* Disappeared is at Edinburgh's Traverse Theatre from March 29 to
April 2 and at Glasgow's Tron April 11-15.

SOMEWHERE in this City, ambition is on the loose. Somewhere in this
City, ambition gets a little out of sync. Some things are all happening.
Like scenery. There are 39 scenes and a prologue. Whee-oo! How those
locations shift. From office to bedroom, library to morgue, someone's
else's office to someone else's bedroom . . . it is a prime example of
trucking about, the various sets on squeak-free castors, coasting into
place, if only for a few seconds.
Elsewhere in the City, however, things are not so smooth. It's as if
the show had come on stage at least a week too soon. The snazzy
one-liners that Larry Gelbart larded his script with tend to mumble
past, without the timing that would point them out to an expectant
audience who are thinking -- ''Hey! Didn't Gelbart do MASH and other
stuff? Isn't he meant to be funny? This must be his regulation turkey .
. .''
Somewhere this City of Angels has fallen victim to an understandable
mistake.
Take a super-duper product, one that has won lots of awards but hasn't
been seen in Scotland, and you're on to something that's bound to
attract audiences, and please them. Not so if those on stage are
wandering round the City, looking for signposts to tell them how to get
to where they want to be.

OURS is a tawdry craft in many indefensible ways, propelled by
prurience and a lust for moral shabbiness dressed up in self-important
clothes called the public's right-to-know. This is the downside of
journalism, and always has been; a sin which, like lots of venality,
brings both loathing and hunger to its door.
Even so, these perceived characteristics of the British press have not
prevented us from shouting about the need to preserve press freedom. But
how frivolous our cries seem compared to those of colleagues elsewhere
whose news sense has driven them into torture's grip or the brutal
nothingness of unmarked graves.
Last year represented the worst-known period for reporters and
photographers being killed or jailed while in pursuit of their work.
According to the International Federation of Journalists in Brussels
115 members of the press lost their lives throughout the world, with
genocide in Rwanda and violence in Algeria accounting for more than half
the victims. And of the 72 deaths recorded by the Committee for the
Protection of Journalists, based in New York, 58 journalists were
deliberately targeted. A total of 173 press people were imprisoned, 74
of them by Turkey.
The recent outpouring of Russian grief for the assassinated Oleg
Shchedrov defined the daily peril of investigative reporting in a
country now overrun by gangsters. But on the whole there is no public
requiem for fallen journalists. Their violent deaths occur off track, in
dank corners and the remote swamplands of evil, and may never penetrate
the open world for years.
Not long ago Latin America had the worst record for reporters and
photographers killed in the line of duty. Today the most dangerous
territory is Algeria where 19 members of the press died during 1994. Why
this global escalation? The obvious reason is the increase in battle
zones -- Bosnia, Somalia, Angola, Chechnya, Rwanda -- where death often
comes quickly in turbulent circumstances.
But also the rules have changed. In earlier wars correspondents were
plainly identified, unarmed and largely tolerated by belligerents. Today
they are not only directly exposed to fire but purposely sought out in
order to destroy the technological speed of their dispatches. At other
times the reason for execution arises only from xenophobic hatred: two
years ago four journalists were killed in Mogadishu simply because they
were foreigners.
A few others also become fatalities because their motives for being in
the midst of alien wars were dubious and confused in the first place.
They arrive there to prove something dramatic about themselves to
others. However, the vast majority of journalists killed or incarcerated
represent something far more profound than a reckless leap into the path
of an assailant.
Most who are punished have refused to see truth held permanent hostage
by tyrannous regimes. They go about their work knowing they are in the
rifle sights of hired attackers, learning quickly to be suspicious of
everything.
Walking alone in the streets, one Kenyan journalist never forgets the
drill: his route to unspoken places follows no predictable trail. He
takes this path, turns a corner, takes another, doubles back, knowing
that to defeat the murderer he must throw choices in his road. Others
live by alias in hotel registers, on airline tickets, anywhere
commonplace when not to give a name alarms or draws attention.
Writing in a way that demands the powerful be accountable has always
been a risky business. ''Wherever words are burned,'' observed the
German poet Heinrich Heine, ''human beings will be burned too.'' A
prophetic observation for the greatest recorded words-burning in history
was carried out by Hitler in 1933, to be followed by the greatest
recorded sacrifice of human life.
But criminal intimidation also happens close to home. Just before
Christmas the Dublin journalist Veronica Guerin was ''warned off'' her
investigations into major bank raids by a gunman who shot her in the
thigh when she opened her front door.
As yet there is no single place, no international memorial, where the
names and work of murdered journalists can be preserved. But perhaps
there should be because press freedom has always been about something
more important to the human spirit than crouching in the shadows,
listening for the squeak of forbidden bed springs.

IT PROMISES to be the funeral of the year, the event of the decade.
Assorted killers, muggers, pushers, fencers, hoodlums, racketeers,
safeblowers, housebreakers, gangsters and low-life of every description
are on their way to London for ''the biggest funeral the East End's ever
seen''. And they'll be joined by assorted pop-singers, columnists,
ageing actresses and minor glitterati, all in full view of press and
television, for the last march of Ronnie Kray.
Kray died last week at the age of 61, having spent more than 25 years
in prison -- sent down with twin brother Reggie in 1969 for two brutal
murders. In reality, of course, they were behind a good deal more than
that -- homicide, assault, slashing, mutilation, and a reign of terror
in their squalid little empire at length provoked the authorities to
action.
Twenty-five years inside do something to a man: for Ronnie Kray --
who, famously, was as queer as a #3 note -- it reduced him to paranoid
schizophrenia. Until his final illness he saw out his days in Broadmoor,
a sick man, more pitiable than fearsome. The last pictures showed a
puffy, greying, chinless little fellow.
The Krays, for real, were cheap, violent, sadistic and perverted.
Tales of their tortures are legion. And yet, incredibly, when all of
London knew them for what they were, they were lionised by the rich and
famous; today, immortalised in a movie, they are viewed with misty-eyed
nostalgia.
Barbara Windsor has already keened for the late Ronnie -- and slated
the authorities who locked the evil twins away. ''They weren't menacing
and did a lot for charity. They were charming with old people and
towards women and they've been badly misrepresented for over 30 years .
. .''
What was this: Camberwick Green? Yet Ms Windsor and another actress,
the late Diana Dors, were only two celebrities to mingle with the Krays
when they deigned to take an evening out from a hard week's knifing,
slashing and kneecapping.
Christine Keeler mingled. Profumo mingled. So, it appears, did anybody
who was anybody. Royalty, singers, musicians, actors, writers,
celebrities of every hue . . . they hung out in the glitzy clubs run by
the Krays or their associates. The brothers loved to be seen with the
famous.
The disgusting glamorisation of the Krays is hard to fathom. Part of
it, undoubtedly, is the perception that they only picked on their own
kind -- the same logic, no doubt, that made it impossible to -- er,
solve the shooting of our own beloved Arthur Thomson Jr. (But, in
reality, the Krays victimised all sorts of people; and their business
methods were bestial.)
Then there is, I suppose, the sheer style of those guys -- the white
shirts, slicked hair, narrow ties and cashmere topcoats; a sartorial
elegance long abandoned by the pimps and thugs of today.
And there is pure nostalgia for the London of the sixties, when it
really was the best and most fashionable city in the world; that golden
age when little boys played football in the street, marmalade cats
roamed the chimneyheads, rag-and-bone men clopped about, and
pop-stars-to-be messed around in alleys with their mates.
There was little unemployment then, little erosion to the welfare
state; racial tension had hardly arisen; the Queen and her house were
held in reverence, and Margaret Thatcher was a very junior minister in
the Macmillan Government.
None of this, however, justifies the extraction of money by threats of
violence, far less holding a fellow's hand over a snooker-pocket and
twisting a sword through it -- a typical scene from a soiree with the
Krays.
The twins are not alone in glory, of course. In America, the more
ghastly and sensational your crime, the fatter the cheques for the
mini-series. Ronnie Biggs, Great Train Robber and prison escapee, is
held in high affection -- though the driver bludgeoned in their jolly
little enterprise never recovered from his injuries. Jimmy Boyle stalks
Scotland dripping righteousness, but also the delicious whiff of past
smooth violence.
There are serious questions to be addressed. It is hard to see why,
for so long, the Krays were allowed to operate unmolested; the final
crackdown by authority was belated, and perhaps political. It is also
hard to see why they, alone of most convicted murderers, had to serve so
many years in prison.
It would, of course, be excellent if all convicted murderers were
hanged. It would be a fair enough exchange if, instead, they all eked
out their time till death. But it is strange that Reggie Kray is still
inside and so many others -- no less vicious, some patently nastier --
have long since been released.
There is a hard reality beyond the crocodile tears of hooligans and
starlets. It is the reality of life on the mean streets of our cities.
Even today, we still delude ourselves that the poor are barbarians
without the camp, rising nightly as one to break our windows and steal
our goods and joy-ride our cars. The truth is that the poor are, by far,
the biggest victims of crime. There is more robbery, more bloodshed, and
more misery on the average council scheme in a month than a Kelvinside
street will see in a year.
The Krays understood that reality. And, in their own grim little
world, they showed remarkable application of Hobbes' Leviathan. Men seek
a sovereign with a monopoly of violence rather than be destroyed in the
state of nature. The British state, then and now, failed the East End
and the poor everywhere. So the Krays established their law. It was
corrupt, vicious and illegal. Yet, for those who abode by their rules,
and toed their line, it worked.
The Krays have gone. So is the strange order of their East End. But
history grants them a strange order of their East End. But history
grants them a strange triumph; a glory beyond that of the minor talents
they once cultivated.
Ronnie's funeral will be a media extravangaza; his grave bedecked with
flowers for years to come. Who today remembers Jack ''The Hat'' McVitie?
For not even the police, with all their resources, have ever found his
body.

SCOTTISH sausage skin giant Devro International is paying a total of
#183m for Teepak of Illinois which will establish the Moodiesburn-based
company as world leader in sausage casing manufacture.
The deal is a large mouthful for the company capitalised at #290m --
the payment includes taking on #97.8m of debt which will raise Devro's
gearing to 80% -- but it appears to offer scope for a substantial
increase in earnings per share in two years' time.
Market reaction was muted with Devro shares up just 1p to 217p on
minimal turnover.
Chief executive Graeme Alexander said the purchase came after a major
strategic review last year which concluded that the company wanted to be
the world leader in casings. While Devro makes collagen products,
typically found on the British sausage, Teepak using a cellulose casing
caters much more for the skinless sausage with its biggest market sector
being the hot dog.
Teepak is being sold by a US venture capital group Hillside which will
end up with 15% of the enlarged Devro equity votes. The senior
management is being retained with James Hermesdorf who will become chief
operating officer and number three in the Devro hierarchy -- Leon Allen
is chairman.
The consideration is being met by the issue of almost 11 million new
Devro shares and the equivalent of #33.3m of Devro dollar-denominated
6.65% redeemable Convertible Preference shares and #28.4m of cash which
will be financed by a vendor placing of new shares.
The attractions of Teepak include a huge increase in turnover with its
having sales last year of #205m compared with just #98m at Devro, a
substantial exposure to the Americas which will account for 50% of the
combined #303m of sales as well as bringing in cellulose technology
where casing demand is rising globally at twice that of collagen at
about 5% annually.
It has manufacturing plants in Danville in Illinois, Sandy Run, South
Carolina and Lommel in Belgium. There is also a 56% stake in Cuitsin of
the Czech Republic which supplies collagen products to local markets and
has benefited from heavy investment recently.
In the last three years, Teepak's margins have declined from 13.8% to
10.6% due in part to first a downturn in the important German market and
last year production difficulties at new plant at Sandy Run.
Profits in 1994, excluding exceptional items, were #16.5m. In
contrast, Devro increased its operating margins from 27.8% to 29.2%
which helped raise pre-tax profits 14% to #29.1m. The only significant
disappointment was Japan where competition intensified.
The dividend total has been raised 13% to 7.05p with a 4.7p final.
Mr Alexander said that the acquisition would be broadly neutral in
terms of earnings in 1995 which points to the stock trading at 12 times
possible earnings and so appears a little cheapish against the market.
The yield is 4%.

LUCAS has had its share of troubles over the past year as a result of
its problems with aerospace contracts in the US but trading at its car
components business is moving forward strongly.
As a result, profits in the six months to January more than doubled to
#44.5m and there are good prospects of solid earnings growth for several
years to come.
The interim dividend is only held at 2.1p because cover is still well
below the preferred twice to three times.
The aerospace division is still depressed and Dundee-born group chief
executive George Simpson sees little improvement this side of 1997. The
division suffered a heavy blow over its US business, which was fined
$18.5m for failing to follow agreed procedures on defence contracts.
It has been debarred from certain work for the US Navy, though this
relates to just #40m worth of business. The fine ended the criminal
investigation but civil proceedings are continuing.
Rather then ending the episode with an out-of-court settlement, Lucas
has decided to fight through the courts because it is convinced it has a
strong case. The matter could take a year to two to resolve.
Meanwhile several top executives has been sent over to get the
operations right. Current losses of the business are running at the same
level as a year ago and should be much reduced by the year-end. Present
provisions are thought adequate.
Strong car markets provided a bonanza for Lucas, which showed the
first benefits of restructuring that began during the recession and will
not be complete until 1996. Sales rose 32% to #1001m and with margins
improving operating profits more than doubled to #56m.
Diesel injectors were a strong market and Lucas ran up against
capacity restraints, which are being resolved through increased capital
investment. The group has recently received a massive shot in the arm
with big contracts from Volkswagen and Peugeot for its latest technology
injectors. Other major orders are in the offing and the group is bound
to benefit from the doubling of Toyota's plant in Derbyshire.
Braking systems returned to profit on a 26% jump in sales and
cost-cutting. Major developments here are joint ventures in China and
the US, for heavy braking systems and anti-lock brakes respectively.
Group aftermarket sales have moved ahead, with market share improving.
As distribution channels improve further progress is expected.
Aerospace remains difficult. Although airline traffic is picking up,
Mr Simpson does not think this will translate into fresh orders until
the end of 1996 or early 1997. Spares orders have picked up 5%, however.
The group is using the quiet period to restructure the business over the
next 18 months. It remains a core activity though its contribution to
sales is now down to a quarter. The profits contribution, unchanged at
#9m, is even less at 15%.
Mr Simpson is hopeful the activity will prove to be counter-cyclical
to motor components and it has traditionally had margins twice those in
the latter.
At the moment, however, they are depressed, while on the motor side
they improved from 3.3% to 5.6% in the first half. Mr Simpson reckons
they could rise to 7%-8% across the group as a whole. Customer
reluctance to accept price rises even when raw material costs are rising
means that margins will not be able to return to the level seen in the
last peak of the cycle.
Lucas shares eased 1p to 197p and are a firm hold, selling at 15 times
likely earnings for the full year.

DESPITE all the talk of doom and gloom in the High Street there are
some retailers who are doing well. These tend to be companies who offer
strong volume sales, good value or design innovations, and Argos is one
such company.
Last year its sales grew by 13% to just over #1200m. This helped
profits to rise by 20% to a record #100.2m, ahead of City expectations.
Shareholders are rewarded with a 31.3% increase in the total dividend
to 10.5p after a final payment of 7.85p.
Chairman David Donne said the results vindicated the group's strategy
of offering customers a wide range of high-quality branded goods at
consistently low prices, with a rapid and efficient service from 350
outlets.
A further 31 stores were opened during 1994, including 10 Superstores,
contributing 7% of the sales growth. Capital expenditure in the year
increased by #8m to #38m.
Argos Direct, the home delivery business, achieved sales growth of 37%
to #51m and sales associated with Argos Premier Incentives totalled
#79m, up 20% on the previous year. All product ranges produced positive
sales growth, although furniture, textiles and toys were the top
performers. Most product ranges also showed improved market shares with
notably strong gains in jewellery and toys.
Market leadership gives companies an advantage in maintaining or even
growing their margins in what remains an intensely competitive trading
environment. Argos's gross margin for the year was only marginally lower
than in 1993. However, good cost management together with the strong
sales growth resulted in productivity improvements which enabled net
margins to advance to 7.3% from 6.9%.
The company remains very strong financially with good cash generation.
The average cash balance increased by 30% to #149.3m and net cash at the
year-end was #354m up from #298m.
Sales are continuing to grow strongly in the first few weeks of the
new financial year. In the first ten weeks sales were up 11.5% on the
comparable period last year, 8% of the growth coming from new store
openings.
Net openings of 21 stores are expected in the current year with
capital expenditure budgeted at #34m. Gross margins are currently
holding steady at last year's levels despite lower prices in the
spring/summer catalogue launched in January.
Mr Donne is confident that despite the economic and political
uncertainties which are likely to affect consumer confidence and create
another difficult year for retailers, ''our own efforts and initiatives
will produce increased shareholder value''.
The company intends to ask shareholders for permission to buy back its
own shares at its annual general meeting in May.
The City was pleased by the generous dividend and optimistic trading
statement and the shares gained 19p to 376p where they yield 3.5%.

MANAGEMENT of the Dundee-based Alliance Trust voiced tentative hopes
for the first economic soft landing in living memory, as they reported a
12% full-year decline in net asset value to 1877p.
The investment trust's setback compares favourably with a fall of
15.2% in the FTSE All-Share index, with 56% of the fund invested in the
UK at its January 31 year-end.
However, the US market, which accounted for a quarter of the #950m
income and capital growth fund's holdings, fell only 7.8% in sterling
terms during the period.
Alliance's total dividend is 6.4% higher at 50.0p, after a 7.7%
increase in the final payout to 35.0p. Its shares strongly outperformed
the sector yesterday, putting on 24p to 1809p.
The inflation-fighting monetary squeeze implemented by central banks
since early last year has, according to the trust, produced the
perception that a gentle slowdown in the rate of growth can be achieved
without pushing economies into recession.
Somewhat euphemistically, Alliance said this outcome would be a very
satisfactory result.
However, the comments of joint managing director Lyndon Bolton
reflected the trust's ever-cautious outlook, which can also be seen in
the fact that cash holdings accounted for 5.6% of the fund at the
year-end.
Mr Bolton said: ''We haven't actually had a soft landing in living
memory, without the economies tipping into recession. At the moment it
is no more than a hope.
''I think we would feel that, if the hope is realised, then interest
rates should not go up very much more.''
However, with the Mexican financial crisis and other factors producing
a flow of cash particularly into the US but also into the UK, Mr Bolton
voiced concerns that this could feed through in higher inflation.
He said: ''We are at a period of considerable doubt as to which way
this cat is going to jump.''
During the year, the number of Alliance shareholders grew from 27,000
to nearly 29,000. Investors' funds within the PEP and savings schemes
increased from #200m to #230m, with the true extent of the increase
concealed by the fall in the markets.
The management of Alliance is pleased with its revenue performance.
Strong growth in corporate dividends boosted earnings per share by 7.4%
to 50.77p.
In the 12 months, Alliance slightly reduced equity holdings in the UK,
Continental Europe and the US, increasing Far Eastern and Australian
holdings, which accounted for 9.0% of the fund at the year-end, and cash
holdings.
Alliance hopes to add gradually to its investments in the Far East,
where it sees considerable growth potential. It is less certain of
short-term stock market valuations, in light of political uncertainty in
Hong Kong and China.
* THE Financial Reporting Review Panel yesterday welcomed Alliance's
production, for the first time, of additional consolidated accounts
including the results of banking and savings subsidiary Alliance Trust
(Finance).

Familiar family disputes are given an interesting twist when set in
Glasgow's Asian community, finds MARY BRENNAN
ON stage there is a good-going family rammy: big brother doesn't like
kid sister's boyfriend; dad is trying to lay down the law to both of
them; nobody is giving way and tempers are blazing.
It's a scene we've seen before, possibly even played in. What gives
this version its edge is the family at the heart of the drama, for
Vishal, Chander and Anna are drawn from the life of Glasgow's Asian
community and their experiences form the bedrock of Fablevision's latest
project, Safar So Far.
Safar means journey, and as Liz Gardiner, Fablevision's artistic
director, fills in the background, the project itself takes on the
dogged, inspired feel of some great trek. In the early days, plans were
on a large scale, reaching beyond the local community. Gardiner had
spent time over in New Delhi, watching Barry John and his company,
Theatre Action Group, at work. Like Fablevision, their patch was
community theatre and they use theatre to explore social issues, and to
foster a sense of identity and self-esteem among those who seemed
vulnerable within the wider system.
Wherever she looked -- in Glasgow or New Delhi -- Gardiner saw
instances of tension and dissension in the minefield of cultural roots.
People were constantly getting tangled in conflicts of ''belonging''.
Regardless of how their new neighbours treated them, all too often
incomers carried a sense of being forever unsettled -- home was always
the place they had left.
But what if Barry John's company and performers from his local
community, could join forces with Fablevision in Glasgow? Audiences
could learn that alongside differences of language or religion, there
are similarities in how folk live and dream, despair and battle on.
If passion and commitment paid dividends this scheme would have
floated happily into being. Gardiner is brisk about the lack of funding
that scuppered the de Mille version of Safar So Far. She has fierce
views on the second-class status accorded community theatre within the
UK, views reinforced by attending European conferences where Ministers
of Culture stand up and applaud the work done by community companies in
furthering integration and promoting understanding between various
sectors of society.
Barry John, who for 20 years has been a major influence in the
development of community and education theatre in India, was invited in
as a co-director of the piece Gardiner decided to develop. A steering
committee was set up, so that the Asian community could contribute
information and ideas -- rather than think that their situation was
being hijacked by a Scottish company with no awareness of the truth.
Writer Chris Ballance was brought in to structure the material that
the Scottish-Asian cast were devising out of their own experiences and
perceptions.
What is depicted may touch a raw nerve within sections of the Asian
community. That family rammy, where one generation clashes with another,
is -- as the cast acknowledge -- a public airing of something usually
kept behind closed doors.
The row is fuelled because Anna's boyfriend is a white boy who has
previously insulted her brother. When Vishal, their widowed father,
intervenes it is to say that he's made up his mind: they are going back
to India the confrontation becomes a matter of obedience and respect.
Naomi Breeze, Faroque Khan and Archie Lal, who play the family, know
that the piece doesn't offer any answers to the problems that attend a
multi-ethnic society. Their hope is that the audience will see
themselves in the story and may be question their own attitudes.
In terms of staging it isa triumph of imagination over a shoestring
budget (and Jaya Dheer's dancing is a rich addition).And the message?
Gardiner sums it up rather pithily.
''You discover that love isn't enough. Going around, being friendly
but not ever discussing the issues, doesn't solve anything, change
anything. You have to listen, and you have to ask questions, and you
have to be prepared for tough answers. And that goes for all sides.''
* Safar So Far journeys round venues in Central Scotland, with
education workshops in some schools. The production can be seen tonight
at the Calton Neighbourhood Centre, Glasgow.

TRIBUTES in the Stornoway Gazette to deceased ministers of the Free
Presbyterian Church are not usually among the Diary's required reading
material. We make an exception for the appreciation of the Rev Donald
John Macaskill who died in Leverburgh, Harris, earlier this month at the
age of 85.
We are told: ''Mr Macaskill never held high office in his church --
save as moderator of synod which honour fell to him in 1951. He retired
remarkably early -- Free Presbyterian ministers tend to quit only in
great old age or infirmity -- and, despite his many charges is generally
agreed to have been an unreliable preacher; sermons ill-organised, dully
delivered, sometimes bizarre in theme.
''Why remember such a man? For one, his considerable gifts as a
pastor. He visited the people industriously, when much more eminent sat
in their manses . . .''
But back to the Rev Macaskill's ''legendary eccentricity'' as
described by the writer of the tribute: ''Mr Macaskill was of that
generation who never passed a driving test and though he drove much
could not reverse a car. (When he met the Uig bus on the single-track
road, its driver would pop out to reverse it for him.)
''He invariably wore layers of clothing and the hotter the weather the
more he put on -- stock and waist-coats, cardigan, jacket, coat and big
woolly pullover, a voluminous water-proof.''
We are told that: ''His preaching, if chaotic, was interspersed with
wonderful notes, anecdotes and observations, sprayed out in one torrent
of asides. There were bad occasions when it was dominated by the fruits
of vast reading. Mr Macaskill devoted an entire Communion season to the
exploits of Garibaldi.''
We have a happy ending, according to the tribute (written by one J M
M): ''Mr Macaskill, well-clad as ever, went down to Am Clachan to post
seven letters and buy the Stornoway Gazette. He returned home,
tip-tapping up the road, and was found in the chair when they went to
call him for lunch. He had gone in truth to the haven he had sought to
see, taken as gently as a child.''
Flight of fancy
THE BBC Scotland comedy series The High Life is being shown on World
Service television. The series which features Siobhan Redmond, Forbes
Masson and Alan Cunningham is described thus in the BBC Worldwide
magazine: ''Poised at the end of the runway, this comedy concerns the
antics of an Air Scotia shuttle crew based at the fictional Prestwick
Airport . . .''
The BBC mag obviously knows something about dear old empty Prestwick
that the airport operators themselves have yet to admit.
Lost in translation
THE Nuffield Hospital in Glasgow decided to advertise its infertility
service in an Arabic magazine. A London advertising agency who
specialise in such translation matters were asked to provide the Arabic
equivalent of the phrase: ''The joy of having a baby.'' The Nuffield
people duly received the artwork in Arabic at which they nodded sagely
but uncomprehendingly and sent back, marked approved.
Fortunately before the publication went to press, someone noticed that
the Nuffield were inviting their Arab customers to come to Glasgow and
savour the joys of a much earlier part of the process of making a baby.
One in the teeth
THE scene is a leafy London suburb where John Maxton, Labour MP for
Glasgow cathcart, is out jogging. He is waylaid by a troublesome dog
which insists on pursuing him and impeding his aerobic progress. Mr
Maxton is annoyed to note that the lady owner of said dog appears to
find the whole thing rather amusing.
Assessing that he is unlikely to lose any votes in Castlemilk by
speaking his mind to a London dog-owner, Mr Maxton explains in some
detail what will happen unless the animal is restrained. ''Come, come,
Mr Maxton. That's not a very nice thing for an MP to say,'' the woman
replies.
Marks for trying
AND so we come to announce the results of the Famous Grouse Grand Slam
competition. We offered the chance to win either an autographed Scotland
jersey and or a ball to remind you of the time our boys nearly won the
Grand Slam but England did.
No prize but a special mention to T P Moran of Mount Vernon who
responded to our failure to set a tie-breaking question last week: ''The
answer to the question not posed is, of course, 'Anything with a stewed
prune in the middle'.'' In the same vein, a Mr Hastings of Fintry
writes: ''I think the answer to the question you thought about asking is
'Scotland'.''
All the correspondence having been put in a bin, the winner of the
signed jersey, duly drawn at random, is Gerard Fallon of Summerston,
Glasgow. The person who now has an odd-shaped ball is Billy Nimmo of
Stewarton, Ayrshire.
Away with the birds
* THE above advertisement for a forthcoming event at the Edinburgh
Festival Theatre is certainly eye-catching. What exactly is going on the
photie, we asked the Festival Theatre people. ''He's hugging the swan,''
they replied. We took their word and asked no further leda-ing
questions.
The version of Swan Lake is by a modern dance company called
Adventures in Motion Pictures, an adjunct of the Royal Ballet. ''It's
modern dance with a sense of humour,'' they said, which you can believe
if you like.
There is no live swan actually involved in the production, if any
animal rightists are reading this.

AFTER the turmoil in the currency markets in recent weeks with the
dollar and sterling in full retreat against the German mark, yesterday
saw a semblance of order return to foreign exchanges.
The pound and the dollar showed substantial gains against the German
currency. And while this can probably be mostly put down to
profit-taking and some talking up of the dollar at the European Union
Finance Ministers' meeting in Brussels, it certainly helped boost equity
markets.
The FTSE 100 Share Index closed up 34.9 points at 3124.2, above 3100
for the first time in nearly six weeks, aided also by a steady Wall
Street opening and stronger futures. This was despite ex-dividends
hitting the index by 10.4 points.
Meanwhile, the provisional February figures for M4, the broad measure
of money supply which includes lending by the banks and building
societies, did nothing to dampen markets. They showed growth of 0.6% for
the month taking the year-on-year rate to 4.6%, up from 4.2% in January
and ahead of market expectations which had centred on around 4.4%.
Actual lending by the banks and building societies fell to #3700m in
the month compared to January's #4600m, more in line with market
projections. Consumer borrowing remains relatively subdued as the
feel-good factor refuses to take hold.
However, the January figure was believed to have been boosted by
companies borrowing to pay their corporation tax and the February
figures still show steady underlying growth which has been the case over
the past 12 months. And companies, who at one stage had been repayers of
debt, are now increasing their borrowings, reflecting higher investment
spending, and this has to be bullish for the economy.
For consumers, though, the picture remains cloudy, with little sign of
any return of real confidence. It is still exports that are fuelling the
recovery, not spending by consumers. The building society mortgage
lending figures for February confirm this.
Although net new commitments increased from January's #2012m to #2697m
this was below expectations and still below the level of a year earlier.
Moreover gross and net lending both fell over the month and net lending,
at #542m, was also 17% lower compared with February 1994.
The Building Societies' Association was yesterday suggesting that
fading concern over further increases in interest rates in the near
future along with the onset of the traditionally buoyant spring months
may mean that there will be some increased activity in the coming
months.
But it admits that it is now becoming clear that neither prices nor
transactions will show any significant growth in 1995 compared to 1994.
And this of course can have repercussions for the other consumer areas
such as High Street spending where there are conflicting signals at
present.
The Chancellor's two-year timescale for feel-good may prove to be only
too accurate.
But so far as borrowing is concerned, any slack on the consumer side
is now being taken up by companies. Bank lending to the private sector
rose by #2962m in February, according to separate figures from the
British Bankers' Association (BBA). This was almost identical to the
rise in January, which was the largest increase since March 1990 and
compares with an increase of #573m in February 1994. The annual growth
rate has picked up to 5.8% in February from 4% at the end of 1994. But
on the personal lending side, there are again conflicting signals.
Mortgage lending's growth rate of 6.9% has been decelerating every
month for over a year, while consumer lending is now rising by 5.5%,
having been contracting a year ago.
The BBA's director-general, Tim Sweeney, said it remains debatable
whether the latter reflects growing consumer confidence or involuntary
borrowing. Since there is little sign of the former elsewhere, the
latter seems a more likely explanation.

Despite a name change to stop American audiences thinking it was a
sequel, Alan Bennett's The Madness of King George has broken new ground
Stateside. William Russell talked to Bennett about how his play
weathered the transformation to the big screen
ALAN BENNETT is clear about one thing. The balance of his play, The
Madness of King George III has shifted in the version he wrote for the
screen, which has dropped the III, from the political to the personal.
The constitutional dilemma posed by the King's illness is still clear,
but what gives the film added resonance is the equally clear parallels
drawn between the House of Windsor today and the House of Hanover then.
In both cases there is a discontented Prince of Wales, with an
unacceptable mistress-in-waiting for the throne. It ends with a note
explaining what the King was suffering from, to which audiences react
with delight. It was porphyria, a hereditary disease which causes
irrational behaviour in the afflicted and the present Prince of Wales
leaps instantly to mind.
Not that the play or film are bad history. ''The only thing which is
slightly transposed, but it is true, is the business about Mrs
Fitzherbert,'' Bennett says. ''The crisis occurs slightly earlier in
reality and the Prince did not ditch her at the point he does in the
film -- he did it later and quite brutally -- but I felt it was relevant
to the situation today and it thickened up the plot. It was good to have
a sub plot.''
Bennett believes that the Madness of King George III was not very
topical when he wrote the play, although it had got more topical since.
''When I was doing the screenplay I was aware there was something to
be gained, that you could strike resonances.'' he says. ''On stage it
was more to do with politics than the monarchy.''
''The thing which seems to stand, and is absolutely true, is the
speech where the Prince of Wales says to be Prince of Wales is a
predicament, not a position. Everyone thinks you are waiting to take
over and this makes you a slightly ridiculous figure. It always has
done. It did so for Edward VII and it does with Prince Charles.''
Towards the end of 1992 he and the director, Nicholas Hytner, had
started talking about whether they could do it in a film. ''I did a
draft script.'' he explains. ''We went through three scripts eventually.
It never occurred to me that anybody else should do it than Hytner. The
stage play had been done in a very collective way. I wrote a draft play,
showed it to him, and he made various suggestions. I did another one and
then he showed it to Nigel Hawthorne, who said he would like to play
George III. We did a reading with actors at the National and I did
another draft and we re-wrote a lot during rehearsals.
''I did wonder whether anybody would risk having a first time director
do the film but it cost #5.5m which in film terms is not much. If it had
been a huge budget I think they would not have risked having a first
time director but, because it was relatively modest, they did.''
In fact nobody else was ever proposed as director. Bennett is amused
by the title change since George III is the one English king Americans
do know about because he lost the colonies. But dropping the number was
not a huge compromise, he says. Will he be there on Oscar night?
Hawthorne is up for best actor for his performance as the king, Helen
Mirren, who plays the queen, has been nominated for best supporting
actress, and Bennett has a best screen-play nomination.
If it did well in the Oscars he would be very pleased for everybody,
but he would believe it when he saw it, he says. ''I went to Los Angeles
for the premiere of A Private Function and it was such a comic occasion.
The stretch limo did not arrive and we had to go in the van the hotel
used for delivering fish. We got out and the microphone broke down, and
when they called my name the spotlight could not find me. I stood up and
someone behind me said 'Sit down you jerk.' That was it. I am not
encouraged to go. I do not have any reputation in America so I probably
won't go.''
He said the king's illness was very well documented, the doctors
involved all wrote memoirs, as did the equerry, Greville. A great deal
was known about the king's behaviour, and the only thing altered in the
film was that he had 10 doctors, not three.
''The illness was in 1788/89 and lasted for six to eight months, which
is the proper time span historically,'' Bennett points out. ''I wanted
to explain what happened eventually to George III -- he finally went mad
in 1810 and the Prince of Wales, who had another 20 years to wait,
became Regent -- but I could not see how to do that without a lengthy
story at the finish. I thought by that time the audience will have had
enough.
''What you worry about as a writer is writing. I worry about the fact
I could not get any work done yesterday.''
Writing the screenplay meant he had to lose a lot, because everything
had to be geared to the story. In film one could not hang about. ''But
you find the more you cut, the more you reap benefits,'' he added. ''I
dug my heels in about three times over things I felt we should keep. One
is the speech where George III talks about the loss of America, which I
liked, and, although I say it myself, I liked the writing,'' Bennett
reveals. ''Another was the speech at the end where Fitzroy the equerry
reveals he has been promoted and Greville, the more sympathetic one, is
not.''
He had not seen Hawthorne in Shadowlands and when he was suggested for
the role did not think he was burly enough, or had enough physical
presence to do it. ''As soon as he did the first reading I knew I was
wrong,'' he adds. ''Nigel did live the part.''
He wanted to show how ramshackle the Hanoverian court was because
today we had got used to royal persons as being very stage-minded, says
Bennett. That only started in the last century. The eighteenth century
lot were just a rabble which was why we see the court charging down
passageways headed for levees and receptions, wigs askew and footmen
trailing behind.
''George III was a very cultured man, a good musician, and, like the
royal family today, totally immune to boredom,'' Bennett claims. ''I
suspect this is true. The Queen does not know what boredom is.''

DEAD playwright booed by gallery, ran the Sun's headline when Joe
Orton's farce, What The Butler Saw premiered. His aim in 1967 was to
shock, but although it's extraordinary to think that audiences once tore
up their programmes in disgust it doesn't mean that the play, now being
revived at the National Theatre, is humdrum today.
Its celebration of all things sexual at the expense of all things
conventional is liberating, its structure (Whitehall farce but
considerably naughtier) is ingenious, and its language as barbed and
precise as that of Shaw or Wilde.
Set in a psychiatric clinic, reassuringly bedecked (as Orton would
have wished) with roses and French windows, it opens with a lecherous
shrink attempting to seduce a naive prospective secretary.
The arrival of the shrink's nymphomaniac wife, hotly pursued by a
hotel bellboy, a fiendish Government Inspector and a Dixon of Dock
Green-lookalike PC turn it from bedroom farce to a wild fantasy of
gender-bending and role-swapping ending in bloody mayhem and Euripidean
redemption.
Although Orton's view that society is crazed and that the libido takes
many forms may seem to have been embraced in the 90s, it is worth
reflecting that male homosexual relationships are still illegal until
the age of 18.
Respectable doctors are still seducers, servants still blackmailers,
and boys in frocks still raise more than a frisson of surprise. It's not
the outlandishness of his views, but Orton's subversion of traditional
British reserve into chaos that makes us laugh, and director Phyllida
Lloyd cleverly paces the production from its traditional French window
beginnings to its demented climax.
John Alderton is a marvellously bluff shrink and Nicola Pagett plays
his wife as a maniacal result of inbreeding among the lobelia-growing
classes.
Debra Gillett consumately conveys the confusion of any nice girl who
thought she was going for a job interview and ends up in a straitjacket,
while Richard Wilson's government inspector has all the suppressed
frenzy of a latter-day Dr Strangelove, a crumbling pillar of society
wickedly letting down his defences to leer: ''Boys cannot be put in the
club. That's half their charm.''
* ''FOR Jews there are two ways out: punch your way out or think your
way out.'' New York bartender Eddie in Herb Gardner's latest play,
Conversations With My Father (at the Old Vic) fails to find a way to
follow his own advice -- but his son does, and as narrator, he returns
to the bar to show us his wartime childhood and coming of age.
Gardner tackles huge issues -- the 1905 Odessa pogroms, Roosevelt's
lethargic response to Hitler, world wide anti-Semitism. His achievement
is to blend the personal and political in telling the story of his
father's personal struggle: here is a man who changed his name from
Goldberg to Ross but refused to give in to the Mafia when they demanded
he changed his Jewish jukebox tunes to American hits. Here's a
wheeler-dealer keen to make a quick buck, but handing out free drinks.
Judd Hirsch's performance as Eddie is tough, tender, wise-cracking so
fast you can hardly see his lips move, but tenaciously avoiding
sentimentality, even in his last moments.
He carries the play, for although Gardner writes with great humour and
devotion and is a master of the one-liner, he doesn't know when to stop.
When his 12-year-old stage self has a violent row with Eddie the
narrator comments: ''I was 12, I was just a kid, I didn't mean it.''
This is hitting the nail on the head, twice.
A play bursting with wit and insight, it needs to be cut by a third,
but director Alan Ayckbourn either tried and failed, or disagrees. The
performances he gets out of the supporting cast are somewhat dim next to
Hirsch's, with the exception of Adam Levi's Joey and Jane Bertish's
fleeting mother, for whom no joke is too old to tell.
Another thing: Herb Gardner reveals at the end that he doesn't like
his dad. Yet he had made the audience adore the father and dislike the
son. Unlike Edward Albee, who revealed his dislike for his mother in
Three Tall Women, Gardner must have discovered he loved his father
during the writing of this play.

IT was the night the chef attacked the colonel that I realised I was
in the wrong game. The chef had a cleaver and the colonel had merely
hinted there was too much salt in the soup. A mere dish-washer (student
variety) like myself would be safer in journalism.
The hotel and tourism industry in general has gone on since those days
to create a wealth of jobs up and down the country. Don't be fooled by
the ''too much competition'' moaners. Avoid chefs with cleavers and you
can still create wealth and jobs for others.
But how to recruit and train the right staff? I hear you say. Funnily
enough, I have the answer in a new booklet brought out by those footsore
travellers round the tourism scene, Scottish Enterprise, Highlands and
Islands Enterprise, and the Scottish Tourist Board who help constitute
Tourism Training Scotland.
It is a useful book. Had it been around 30-odd years ago, the colonel
would never have hired a man who reached for a cleaver every time a chap
mentioned salt. Its various sections would have guided him through the
pitfalls, explained how to advertise, to interview, to recruit, to
train, to encourage, and to hang on to.
There is no index on disarming disgruntled staff, calling the police,
giving court evidence, etc. Nothing so unpleasant in an ideal tourist
world, ie one which follows this publication to the letter.
It paints an encouraging picture of an employee whose only desire is
to help the tourist, speak his language, ensure the employer is
satisfied with his performance, and spend his spare time filling in
questionnaires and watching training videos.
He (by which I mean she as well), is allowed to speak his mind at
informal gatherings. An expected reaction to any unpleasantness is: ''I
feel upset and hurt when you shout at me in front of other people.'' I
hope that chef is reading this.
The exemplary employee bears no relation, either, to the uncouth
barman of old whose stretch was a half and a half-pint and who would
bawl: ''Time to ejaculate the bar!'' even in mixed company, as 11
o'clock loomed. In 1995, the bartender will mix a White Lady to
perfection, while imparting helpful details of local tourist attractions
in a language of your choice.
To him, working late will be a pure joy, even though it might prevent
him from watching his training video. Happily, he can fit some of it
into his lunch hour and he can swot up the staff manual on his day off.
Knowledge of the entire history of Mary Queen of Scots is likely to be
an attribute. Such staff are also able to spot under-age drinkers a mile
off, and can recite the licensing laws backwards.
They can drive, have good presentational skills, genuinely like
people, avoid drink on duty, dress according to instructions, vacuum
into the corners if they are cleaning personnel, and think nothing of
disciplinary procedures which might include a right of search.
The booklet, a Guide to Recruitment and Staff Development, is pretty
hot on questionnaires. Guests and visitors should get one, so that the
institution in question can identify faults. One of the guides,
presumably, might not have been fluent in Swahili. Referees for jobs
should get one, with a whole series of queries about the applicant.
New employees should, apparently, receive a list of questions on their
newly-completed Induction Programme. And staff with a bit more
experience shouldn't be surprised if confronted with one on how the
business might be improved and (wait for it) how their own performance
could be better.
Should a member of staff bristle at this, or start fondling a sharp
object, this is what is known as negative body language. Stranger than
fiction, the booklet has something to say about this as well. It is not
keen on the ''tightening of the mouth, a narrowing of the eyes'', or
other expressions which ''give away our true feelings''.
The thought occurs on perusing its pages that body language might be
all that is left for a tourist worker in some situations. While
attending to complaints ''without delay'', making sure telephones are
answered ''within 10 seconds'', clearing tables promptly between
courses, and planning answers to that night's questionnaire, he might
occasionally react with less than enthusiasm to management's latest
overtures.
This would be an ungrateful attitude to strike against people who have
tried to help from the start, even assisting incoming staff to find
accommodation locally on the happy conclusion of the recruitment
process.
The example given in the booklet is for a job paying #120 a week, so
the accommodation will hardly be four-star. But they do say that if you
can't stand the heat you should get out of the kitchen. Especially if
people are going to criticise the soup.

IF, as some in the industry and the Scottish Office fear, Scottish
Nuclear emerges from the Government's current review of the industry's
future as candidate for takeover by its bigger, southern sister, Nuclear
Electric, would there be a popular resistance campaign at the gates of
Hunterston and Torness to match the rammies which attended the rival
bids for the Royal Bank 15 years back or Guinness's successful assault
on the Distillers whisky empire in 1986?
The answer, almost certainly, is No. I barely hesitated at these last
two key strokes. N. O. No. Yet the firmness of that conclusion, as it
pops up starkly on my screen, surprises me. After all, we are talking
here about a major Scottish company, with 1850 employees, responsible
for generating nearly half Scotland's total electricity needs.
We are also talking about an important centre of engineering
excellence. Into the bargain Scottish Nuclear made profits of #72m in
1993/94 on sales of #537m. There are whispers that this year's profits
could top #100m.
Nuclear Electric is lobbying ministers hard to retain, under licence,
management of its own eight ageing Magnox reactors. But its ambitions
are more expansionist than that. NE's is the most vocal voice calling
for early privatisation of the UK nuclear industry.
If what proved indigestible in the sale of the rest of the electricity
industry at the start of the nineties is to be made practical politics
now, NE is apparently arguing, the Government must make the plum on
offer as sweet as possible by lumping in Scotland's nuclear capacity as
well. Carefully placed fliers to that effect appeared in both the FT and
the Telegraph last week.
If Nuclear Electric were to be allowed to absorb Scottish Nuclear on
the pretext of creating one globally-competitive civil nuclear power
contractor in the UK, it would be after just four things. The four
advanced gas-cooled reactors, two each at Hunterston and Torness, some
of the best-performing nuclear plants anywhere in the world.
NE would have no room for Scottish Nuclear's separate corporate
culture or its headquarters at East Kilbride, employing 350 of the 1850
people on the payroll. We would be looking at the loss of yet another
significant Scottish corporate HQ, the kind of threat certain to muster
a defensive tartan ring-fence and a high-decibel cry of ''Enough is
enough'' in years gone by.
So, if I'm right and the answer to my initial question is still No,
what has changed? Has so much corporate independence slipped away from
Scotland already that the troops have grown battle weary? Or is the real
problem the company which finds itself in the firing line this time
around?
Is Scottish Nuclear, because of the nature of its business, still such
a corporate pariah that, if it really does have to fight for its
independence when the review's findings are published after Easter, few
Scots outwith the industry will rally to its defence?
The fact is nuclear power still scares a lot of people. Some of that
fear is irrational, born of the certain knowledge that over-exposure to
stray radiation can cause cancers, but whipped up by the irresponsible
into a tabloid nightmare where every nuclear power station teeters on
the brink of meltdown, covertly irradiating everyone within miles with
its death rays.
At this point, I should place some cards, firmly, face-up, on the
table. I started life as a physicist. As an undergraduate I was used to
handling low-grade radioactive sources on the laboratory bench. On
occasion, I travelled to East Kilbride to carry out experiments on the
university test reactor on the NEL site.
Its a very long time since I did any serious physics but I retain fond
memories of some of the theoretical classes, notably those which
unravelled the awesome forces at work in the atomic nucleus.
I am not blindly pro-nuclear. For years in the early eighties I
consistently criticised the decision to go ahead with Torness, because
the additional generating capacity it created was extravagantly surplus
to Scotland's requirements. I agree that the treatment of spent nuclear
fuel poses major environmental challenges. But I refuse to fall in line
with the more strident green voices which tell us that nuclear power is
bad, bad, bad.
It is a moot point whether burning good old coal -- the focus of so
much cosy, industrial nostalgia among those who have never had to earn
their living down a pit -- or sinister nuclear generation is the more
environmentally deleterious way of keeping the lights on and the
production lines running.
Yes nuclear has a waste problem and a decommissioning problem, the
main reasons why its costs have been uncompetitive with rival fuels.
But, unlike fossil stations, nuclear plants do not pollute the
atmosphere with greenhouse gases. And no-one has yet priced the cost to
humanity of the climate change now flowing from that pollution.
I don't know what the nuclear review will finally decide. Ministers
are reportedly split about the prospects of selling nuclear off before
the next election. But if Nuclear Electric's covert takeover bid were to
gain political credence, I know what side of the argument I will be on.
An alternative scenario has been doing the rounds in which Nuclear
Electric, far from sweeping all before it, loses two of its five AGRs to
Scottish Nuclear, to even up the competitive nuclear forces in the UK.
The likeliest transfer candidates would be the Heysham A and B stations
in Lancashire. Heysham B is identical in engineering design to Torness.
In the past couple of years Scottish Nuclear has garnered even green
support for its proposals to build dry stores for spent fuel at Torness
and Hunterston. It stood firm in that stand-off with British Nuclear
Fuels and eventually BNFL offered a cut-price deal incorporating all the
savings dry store would have brought.
In the resulting U-turn Scottish Nuclear has forfeited some of that
green goodwill. But if, after Easter, Scottish Nuclear finds itself
fighting for its independence, I may not appear at the gates, but I
certainly argue for the Heysham solution. What's good enough for
Scottish banks and whisky companies, in my book, is appropriate for the
people who generate half our electricity too.

Geraldine Abrahams reports on a product design course where the accent
is on the poetic
IN a city that has been renowned for its excellence in both
engineering and design for centuries, it is not surprising that in 1995,
many of Glasgow's educational establishments are still seen as being at
the cutting edge of industrial creativity and innovation.
One institution with its eye on the main chance is Glasgow School of
Art, the only centre in the country to run undergraduate courses in both
Product Design and Product Design Engineering. The latter has been in
existence for 10 years and is organised in conjunction with Glasgow
University.
The B Eng/M Eng programme in Product Design Engineering has
consistently produced highly-qualified students and, being scientific,
deliverable and measurable, it is well-suited to meeting the needs of
the industrial marketplace.
With the engineering course being linked with industry, a new course:
a B A (Hons) in Product Design was created to meet the needs of business
and commerce. It replaced the original course which has run since 1948.
The new course is seen as providing a vital link between technology and
society, developing a bias towards the aesthetic, ergonomic, social and
visionary design factors.
''The inspiration for the Product Design course is: 'Imagination is
more important than Knowledge' (Albert Einstein) and I believe that is
what our college is good at,'' says course leader Norman McNally.
''The course is more poetic, more visual. It is to do with catching
hold of technology and seeing what it will do for society. At the
moment, for example, we are working on a project for the Design Council,
looking at how the world might look in 2045.''
Product designers are traditional art students who want to be creative
and who have a view of society and want to deal with society. While a
technological background may be an advantage, the department is more
anxious to take students who demonstrate a desire to be involved with
the built environment.
The course offers opportunities for one-off, interpretative or limited
designs, but its main focus is on multiple products -- providing
multiple or limited edition products for society that people want to buy
and that create jobs in industry. These products might be in the form of
furniture, electronic equipment, electrical/ mechanical goods or a whole
host of consumer products.
The one-off design opportunity was demonstrated last week when a panel
of judges selected a winning design for a piece of furniture celebrating
the life of Glasgow politician Norman Buchan.
Janey Buchan, herself a former Socialist Member of the European
Parliament, who commissioned the memorial piece, briefed six final-year
Product Design students on the life and work of her late husband. From
that they created designs incorporating and interpreting features of his
life, and presented their concept proposals to the judges.
The winner, Jon Stevenson, designed a table to be used for formally
receiving the many items that are regularly presented to the Peoples'
Palace by the people of Glasgow.
Two other students are major contenders for major Royal Society of Art
awards in two categories to be announced this week.
Sally Barton's brief was to design medical packaging for Third World
needs. Her design concentrated on reducing cost, weight and size of
medical packaging as well as creating a resource with internationally
recognised graphics -- pictograms -- which could be re-used in its
existing form.
Chris Down's project was based on the 1994 International Year of the
Family. For his Family Communication Product, he designed a portable
phone/paperless fax machine, with family cards for automatic insertion.
''We try to foster innovation on the course,'' says Norman McNally.
''We are interested in changing the parameters of everyday objects and
finding different solutions, whether it is a home computer for IBM, or a
deer fence stile for the Countryside Commission. We do a lot of work for
companies, especially advanced work for big, international companies.''
Former student Julie Tierney designed the Dondola bed in her final
year for the Italy-based international furniture company Cassina,
manufacturers of Mackintosh furniture, which has strong links with the
department in terms of student placements and projects.
Julie's bed, a careful if somewhat flamboyant study in copper, wood,
shotblasted angle iron steel and cotton/satin fabrics, seems far removed
from her job today at IBM in Greenock where she is a senior industrial
designer.
Other project designs range from life-saving products like an
electronic thermometer baby alarm for Cot Death Syndrome and a virtual
product for Strathclydes's Emergency Services Unit, to slightly more
bizarre studies like a folding tent on springs, a hot chocolate cow
machine which was a 1994 RSA award winner.
The Product Design courses have won two Royal Society Partnership In
Industry awards, one for innovation in education and the other for
innovation in undergraduate courses in management and as their
credibility has increased, there has been an equal growth in the
students' success rate in finding jobs.
''In the past, the college has always given students a good education,
but has not prepared them to negotiate their value in society'', says
Norman McNally.
''It teaches them that they can't stand on the first step of the
Mackintosh with their folios on their heads waiting for a job. They have
to go out and find something and negotiate what they are going to be
doing.''

ONE of the more amusing examples of the current series of
contradictions in The Herald was gleefully demonstrated in your
editorial, The Tories tax-cut dreams (March 16). Is this the same Herald
that throughout the economic boom of the 80s lamented that it was
entirely consumer driven? The electorate were repeatedly advised not to
be taken in by the fact that they were financially better off and to
vote for an export and manufacturing-led strategy.
Here we are in the 1990s enjoying the benefits of just such a strategy
and is the Herald commending it to the nation? Not a bit. This, once
proud, newspaper prefers instead to participate in the titters of
satisfaction that the Government is deriving no benefit from the
strategy it once espoused, instead of another (still very easily
engineered) consumer-driven and ''feel-good'' stimulus. Surely your
responsibility is to set yourselves against the cosy cult status you
enjoy within Scotland's leftish-leaning political establishment and,
given that the strategy is producing consistent falls in unemployment, a
cause you have long championed and now curiously grudgingly welcome,
commend it to the nation.
A change of tone might, in the established Scottish political
environment, give some credibility to your claim to be Scotland's
Independent Newspaper.

ENTERTAINING Miss Beatrice Clugston was costly to many good men.
Having her in for an evening left them out of pocket. Just getting to
know her took plenty. For how she worked was through their wives and
daughters. Always her cause was good. But whenever Beatrice was about,
whole families went into a tizzy.
Yet nothing about her was fatale. She was short and dumpy. She talked
a lot. She was bossy. Less than alluring were her looks. Often in her
chat she became holy. She could quite wear out a drawing-room party with
her religious energy. If her name was hard to get the tongue around, it
became, once learned, harder to forget.
Although dear to know, she was worth it. She must have been about the
worthiest person around.
Introducing her here has the added pleasure that it does not involve
extra expense. She died in l888.
Now her awkward name is back on lips. Especially around Glasgow,
efforts are being made to revive her spirit. Much of her gusto could be
needed to stop the closing of Lenzie Hospital which she built. Also on
the danger list from being much the worse of this winter's weather is
nearby Bromhill Hospital, another outpost of Beatrice's benign empire.
In Kirkintilloch it can feel as if officialdom's ideas about caring
have become concentrated on undoing what she did.
What could have been a centrepiece of the Lenzie campaign is missing.
Although no oil painting, Miss Clugston had one. Recently it came off
its wall. It is said to have been stolen. But it can more feel like it
has been spirited away. For while her portrait hung at Broomhill, her
presence as a local heroine remained palpable. In Glasgow her name
hardly lingers.
Yet her spectacular enterprise was to organise vast bazaars in the
city. She held them in the best places. Her fancy fairs ran at St
Andrew's Halls and the Kibble Palace.
They lasted for a week and ordinary jumble didn't come into them. Only
the best of stuff went on sale -- imported tableware, exotic furniture,
gourmet food, fashionable pictures.
Local shopkeepers rallied round if only for the sensible reason that
they wanted to keep their best customers. They were aware that Beatrice
Clugston had persuaded the poshest ladies in the land to become sales
assistants at the bazaars.
For patrons she started with duchesses and worked down from them, but
not too far down. Everybody was a bit miffed that Queen Victoria herself
missed the St Andrew's Hall blow-out.
Beatrice Clugston's philanthropy grew out of her misfortune. For all
of her teenage years she was an invalid. When fit for public life, her
first concern was for other convalescent patients. At a rest home she
started at Dunoon she became a Florence Nightingale of the Clyde.
Her seaside visits were like gala days. For her arrival the patients
lined the pier. ''Was there ever an old maid with so many bairns to meet
her at the boat?'' she asked.
After a second home opened at Lenzie she became known in the papers as
the Convalescent Miss Clugston.
Even The Bailie, an often satirical weekly, was on her side. Then as
now do-gooders received their lumps. According to The Bailie, most
philanthropists were phoney. They were in it for themselves. If poor,
they were looking for a cosy living and many free dinners. If rich, they
sought a social standing otherwise beyond them.
Beatrice, though, was different. She was business-like. For instance,
she snapped up the Dunoon house at half its market value. If she had
been a man, the paper opined, she would have been among the richest in
the city.
''She would have made a fortune on 'Change and been the life and soul
of ball and dinner,'' a profile article declared.
So beside itself with admiration was The Bailie that it bent its rule
about treating women as important. A March issue of l20 years ago was
adorned with a full-page drawing of Miss Clugston, although ''adorned''
is not the word.
Plainly, she was destined for more unlikely fame. Success brought even
a change of nickname. Instead of being called the Convalescent Miss
Clugston, she became the Incurable Miss C after she created a hospice
for the chronically ill at Broomhill.
It is hard now to take a stab at how much money she raised. One way
and other it may have been as much as #5m.
Glasgow's new rich were an easy target. They had so readily made such
enormous heaps of lucre that their sense of insecurity made them ready
givers. It may be that the West of Scotland's reputation for spectacular
generosity owes much to Incurable Clugston. She made fund-raising
fashionable.
Her own money (her father had owned a textile works) went the same
way. She found herself forgotten and living alone in Ardrossan. When her
body was found in l888 it was kneeling at her bedside in an attitude of
prayer. She died broke.

TIED to the railway tracks with a puffing, clanking, howling General
Election locomotive rushing towards it, this Government does what this
Government does best; it tightens the knots. There can be no reason
other than perversity for the way in which a fight, which nobody wants,
has been picked with 660,000 nurses, midwives, health visitors, and
therapists over their national pay award of 1% plus discretionary
top-ups negotiated locally. (Actually, there is another reason and it is
called ideology, but it is so closely linked in this case to perversity
that it is difficult to put, as Mr Portillo would say, clear blue water
between them.)
The depths of emotion which this issue has raised is illustrated
perfectly by the actions of that formerly docile group, the Royal
College of Midwives. In its 115-year history the college has never as
much as said boo to a medical consultant, which just goes to show the
quality of its forbearance. The prospect of a 1% pay rise, taken
together with the detested notion of local pay bargaining for what is a
national service and the downgrading and loss of wages of significant
numbers of midwives, has changed everything. A ballot of midwives has
called overwhelmingly for a reversal of their no-strike policy and a
majority has voted for a partial withdrawal of labour.
When the Health Secretary, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, says that there is
no place in the National Health Service for industrial action she is
merely repeating what was an accepted situation and one which most of
the workers in the NHS had hoped to retain. The fact that it looks
likely to be lost forever, with the biggest nursing union, the Royal
College of Nursing, now under extreme pressure to hold a similar ballot,
is entirely due to the actions of the Government in changing the basis
on which pay is agreed. This was done for no other good reason than an
ideological commitment to rid government of more and more duties, which
is in itself a general policy which has failed to gather public support.
The Government now finds itself, not for the first time, trapped by the
radical nature of its own policies. Any Government is, of course,
perfectly entitled to fight hard to push through those policies in which
it believes. But any sensible Government listens to responses and
tailors policies according to the self-evident rule that successful
politics is the art of the possible.
Mrs Bottomley is probably correct when she gives the figures for pay
awards to nurses and midwives over the past six years. These are
respectable awards, but once again Ministers have failed to realise the
impact of their policies. It is probably true that there will always be
pressure for pay rises, and arguments when they are disputed. What the
Government has done in the case of nurses and midwives, and in the case
of many thousands of British workers, is to change the way in which they
are employed and paid. Old and accepted certainties have become new and
uncertain reality. NHS workers find that they will no longer be solely
centrally paid and this has created division, fear, and almost certain
anomalies. Changes in patterns of employment as a direct result of
Government policies, and the frequent deterioration in salary and
conditions which have followed naturally, are the reason why people do
not perceive an improvement in their personal or national prospects. A
Government which listens would have appreciated this fact by now. A
Government which wishes to continue in office could do worse than
acknowledge these truths by graciously avoiding an unnecessary
confrontation with nurses and midwives.

IF ever proof were needed that something is chronically sick with the
National Health Service then one need look no further than the case of
the Cambridge Health Authority's decision to refuse the funding of
treatment for a 10-year-old girl dying from leukemia.
Where a wealthy society possesses the skills and technology to give
even the slimmest chance of life to a desperately sick child, there is a
moral obligation to instigate treatment.
The responsibility must ultimately lie with a morally bankrupt
Government for the inadequate funding of the NHS.
Where is the morality in a society which allows the directors of
recently privatised public utility services to be paid astronomical
salaries which pale into insignificance the #75,000 sum needed to offer
a dying child a last chance of life?
The I'm-all-right Jack syndrome prevails.

I AM writing about the concert by Evelyn Glennie in Paisley Abbey. I
tried to buy tickets at Paisley Town Hall. Two tickets were #8 and I
handed over #20. I was informed I must have the correct money.
Could I write a cheque? No. Give a Visa card number? No.
I was told that BT, which is sponsoring the series of concerts refused
to allow cheques as payment. No telephone bookings could be taken.
In addition the leaflets and posters provided by BT at the Abbey did
not intimate the time of the concert, the price of the tickets, or where
the tickets could be purchased. No tickets were available at the Abbey.
Many people book concert tickets by telephone. This must surely benefit
BT profits. It seems ridiculous that concerts sponsored by BT cannot be
booked in a similar way.

I AM grateful to Frederick J Jenkins for his comments although they
cast little light on my stated paradox of an alleged overwhelming desire
for constitutional change failing to manifest itself in Scotland's
actual voting behaviour (March 15).
I am prepared to take Mr Jenkins's word that the SNP has an
ever-increasing following and I will look for the confirmation in the
next General Election results, but the fact remains that since 1979 SNP
support has increased by only a net 4.2% leaving the Nationalists well
behind the Conservatives and far below their own ephemeral peak of 30.4%
of the vote in 1974.
In the context of the devolution component, Labour is the only party
with any possibility of being in a position to deliver a devolved
Scottish parliament but Labour support in Scotland has been in steady
decline since the mid-1960s and fell by a further 3.4% in 1992, when
devolution was held to be the key Scottish issue, leaving the Labour
Party with only 39% support in Scotland (49.9% in 1966).
If voters in Scotland have an overwhelming desire for a Scottish
parliament an increased majority of 61% voting against the only party
capable of delivering the goods seems a strange way of showing it.
That is not to suggest that there is no level of interest in
devolution. There is when prompted but it does not equate with the
opposition parties' and the Scottish medias' claims of ''overwhelming
desire'' nor is it of sufficient strength to influence Scotland's voting
behaviour.
On one point I agree with Mr Jenkins. The 1979 referendum was a farce
and everything else he says it was.
Nevertheless, the 62.9% turnout achieved by last-minute appeals to
party loyalties, particularly by Labour, was sufficient to have
contained the modest 40% requirement had there been that level of
popular support, and regardless of people no longer on the voters roll
and other considerations.
There was not that level of support. Only 32.4% of registered voters
turned up at polling stations to cast a ''Yes'' vote.
To describe that as ''the Scottish people'' having voted for change
was a glaring example of a semantic blank being used to confuse
perception and conceal electoral reality, a syndrome that has bedevilled
the entire devolution debate.

THE Stability Pact accepted yesterday by the European states whose
diplomatic representatives are meeting in Paris is really designed to
avoid repetitions of the Yugoslav experience in other parts of the
continent. It got off to a good start with the Slovak-Hungarian
agreement to settle their own ethnic problems amicably; and may get more
of the same as the Romanians and Hungarians rush to provide a formula
which will allow them to reconcile their even more acute ethnic tensions
in Transylvania. Each of these cases could be said to contain some of
the elements which set Bosnia alight: in fact the whole Balkan region
from the Adriatic to the Black Sea is beset with ethnic tensions any of
which could easily flare up and prove to be less containable than
Bosnia, simply because they straddle existing international boundaries.
Bosnia has, more or less been contained because it was a separate
republic within Yugoslavia, as were the two other contenders for its
territory.
Apart (arguably) from preventing the conflagration spreading further,
it cannot be said that any of the complex involvements in Bosnia -- the
UN, the EU, and Nato -- has resolved its agony. The fighting goes on, if
now at a reduced intensity, and the prospect of a settlement is unclear.
That is hardly a good omen for the success of the new pact, but at least
it commits its signatories to diplomacy before military exchanges which
is something given, for example, the Greek attitudes to Macedonia and,
to a lesser extent, Albania, not to mention Turkey.
The pact could be the replacement for Nato, although they are two very
different things. Nato was a distinct military alliance focused against
the Soviet Union as it then was and its doppleganger alliance, the
Warsaw Pact. Given the changes in Europe since 1985 but especially the
distintegration of the USSR, it must seem strange that Nato's raison
d'etre has not come into question. Instead its expansion has been
proposed as the central and east European satellites of the former USSR
jockey to join it. It is easy to see why some of the states involved are
anxious to enjoy a greater sense of security than they might were they
to remain on their own -- for reasons of history and geography alike
they remain suspicious of Russia. The countries which founded Nato ought
to consider whether their original aims have not been met and whether
any expansion of that treaty's membership should not lead to a complete
recasting. One thing is certain, an expanded Nato which excludes Russia
must seem to be aimed at Russia. That is certainly an error, and a
possible source of future instability (as Russian soldiers and diplomats
keep saying).
A complete recasting of Nato may have to wait until Russia's
presidential elections. If their outcome is to replace Mr Yeltsin by Mr
Zhirinovsky, doubts and worries about future Russian conduct are likely
to multiply, and not just among the former satellites. Mr Zhirinovsky
longs for the re-establishment of the Russian Empire and has already
identified the West as an enemy (at the same time as proclaiming the
Ayatollah's Iran as a friend). That is hardly a prescription for peace,
but it may not transpire: in that case Nato will look more and more like
an example of diplomatic inertia.

NO area needs economic regeneration quite like ours. We have lost more
heavy industry than any other. A stroll down Main Street, Rutherglen,
reveals poverty and an absence of affluence.
Why then should we allow political nomads the chance to fight their
corner over the M74 extension near our town? Their reason is that
Glasgow has the lowest level of car ownership in EU cities of comparable
size. These tree-dwellers think that our poverty is a soft target. Their
plan is to win success against the motor car here, and spread the word
beyond.
I would wish that my young nieces and nephews have an opportunity of
some real work, not having to tell their children in turn that they
suffered a life of unemployment because of some inane misunderstanding
of the global ecology.
Mount Saint Helens erupted in the US, spilling more pollution than has
been created since the industrial revolution. Activists do not want you

They enjoy making you feel guilty. They want to win a moral victory,

YOUR report on prescription charges highlighted the Government's aim
to reduce fraud and specifically targeted unscrupulous pharmacists -- no
mention of the fact that community pharmacists are not in favour of this
method of taxation and receive no remuneration towards the cost of
collection. Indeed, from April 1 all patients will be required to sign
on the reverse of the revised prescription form whether they are exempt
from the tax or pay it.
This is a very considerable increase in the workload of collection
since very few patients take the trouble to fill in the forms before
presenting at the pharmacy and those with certificates of exemption are
most unlikely to know their certificate number (a requirement of the
revised form).
Are we, as responsible practitioners, to refuse to supply medication
until all the requirements are met in full? This is on top of the
ridiculous situation where certain patients have to choose which items
they can afford.
The new forms are being introduced without consultation with the
profession and without due consideration to the problems this will
create.
On the question of scruples, would your readers care to consider the
revenue lost to the NHS by prescriptions written for periods of
treatment in excess of one month by prescribers courting favour with
patients?  This is particularly true of certain HRT preparations which
the NHS has decided must attract two charges, but are almost never
prescribed in quantities of less than three months supply.

I TRUST whoever thought up the two phone books for Glasgow has not
been paid for his/her services.
Page 1 of the Glasgow South phone book states, ''Your main book,
Glasgow South, lists the residential numbers for Glasgow South (317
pages), as well as all the business numbers for the whole of Glasgow.
Your main book also contains all the extra telephone information you may
need -- such as useful numbers, dialling codes, and phoning abroad.''
What this means is if one wants to find out the telephone number of
anyone who resides in Glasgow North one has to look up the secondary
phone book -- that is, if one has a Glasgow map in hand to determine
where the north and south divides.
The number of pages devoted to business numbers and useful information
available only in the Glasgow North phone book is a mere 67 pages more
than the Glasgow South directory which does not contain such useful
information. It appears that those residing in Glasgow North are
second-rate citizens (which is possible).
Surely if two phone books are required for Glasgow, all residential
numbers should be in one and all business and other useful numbers
should be in the other. Alternately, one phone book could contain phone
numbers of subscribers whose surnames begin with the letters A-M and the
other N-Z.

YOUR article, Troops to quit Northern Ireland (March 15), very clearly
illustrates that once again we, the campaigners to save the Scottish
regiments, were right and the Government was wrong.
Why was the choice made of 5 Regiment, Royal Artillery, as the unit be
withdrawn? The answers are as follows:
By this choice the Government admits it is wrong to have non-infantry
units operating in an infantry role. It is wrong for several reasons --
they have not received the length and depth of specialised infantry
training; they are therefore more liable, in an emergency, to make a
mistake, dangerous to themselves and/or others.
The longer they are misemployed as infantrymen the more they are
losing their own specialised training -- as ''Gunners''. We repeatedly
made these points during our campaign.
Of course, there may be another equally important reason for their
return to the UK: they have a barracks to which they can return.
Although the Government has decimated our troops, it has also sold off
property. Therefore when troops are being withdrawn to the UK from
overseas posts it is increasingly difficult to find them a home.
I can find no comfort whatever in the fact that the Government has
''made it absolutely clear'' that no further Army reductions are planned
and ''that is a matter of public and parliamentary record''. So are many
other matters; increase on taxes? VAT?

I EXPRESS concern at the manner in which both full and part-time
members of the Royal Irish Regiment are being treated. Soldiers, some
with up to 15 years service are suddenly told, ''Your service is no
longer required.'' I find it scandalous that these men, after giving
much loyal service, are thrown on the scrap heap, not by their
commanding officers but by boffins at HQ Lisburn.
Shocked at the treatment they receive they try to find out why, only
to be told that these decisions come from the top. Out on the street
some are left penniless, having to wait up to a month before their final
pay is received. They join the dole queue to beg for income support to
survive on ''until everything is cleared'', when they are then
transferred on to unemployment benefit.
Who wants a 47-year-old UDR/RIR soldier who, after 22 years service,
was told to ''go away''? These were the men, mostly ex-Service, who in
1970 at the formation of the regiment, were coaxed to leave their
civilian occupations to help train the regiment.
When the Ulster Defence Regiment was being disbanded we were assured
that it was to be an amalgamation for the good of the regiment. Ken
Maginnis, MP, fully supported this and was assured by Westminster and
his Army contacts that ''all is well''. Alas, all is not well.
Lately a lot of patrols have been taken off the streets. Soldiers now
die of boredom, doing nothing but repetitive training in barracks.
Perhaps it is hoped that there will be a lot of resignations and there
will be no need for the boffins to think up reasons to dispense with
their services.

Spanish fleet is massive and if allowed to carry on will destroy fishing
stocks.
The sooner nations fish and protect their own country's fishing areas
the better.

THE security nightmare of a nuclear device in terrorist hands has
given way, reports IAN BRUCE, Defence Correspondent, to the much more
likely, and potentially as deadly, threat of chemical-weapon attacks
CHEMICAL weapons are the poor man's atomic bomb. Any country with the
industrial capacity to manufacture insecticide or organo-phosphates for
agriculture is only a high-school formula away from the means of mass
destruction.
Most of the common chemical-warfare toxins are designed to kill by
paralysing the central nervous system. A minute droplet absorbed through
the skin or inhaled in vapour is enough to produce convulsions, vomiting
and death within three to 15 minutes.
It is the ultimate weapon for creating warlords on the cheap. Only
Iraq and the former Soviet Union have ever used it on the battlefield,
but it is the recurring nightmare of every government that terrorist
groups might acquire supplies and use them to create carnage in the
interests of scoring political points.
Initial Japanese analysis yesterday has identified Sarin, a nerve
agent first developed by Germany in the late 1930s, as the cause of
civilian deaths and hundreds of other casualties on the Tokyo subway
system.
But what is surprising is that fatalities have been so few. Apart from
even deadlier VX and Tabun compounds, Sarin, used effectively, is a
surefire killer. Nato units training for a general war in Europe during
the 70s and 80s expected to take up to 50% casualties -- even with
notice of an attack and the use of protective clothing and respirators.
Aerosol spray tanks fastened to the wings of high-flying aircraft are
the most effective way of delivering a chemical attack, on the same
lines as a crop-duster.
By the time even trained troops are aware of its presence, they have
become dying men waiting for an unpleasant end. All Western armies are
now equipped with sensors which give early warning of the presence of
chemicals in the air, in even minute quantities.
The Iraqis used Sarin as the main killing tool when they bombed the
Kurdish town of Halabja in March, 1988. More than 5000 civilians died.
Television footage of the victims curled up in the streets in the final
convulsions shocked the world at the time.
Iraq also used Sarin and mustard gas -- a blistering agent which
attacks the eyes and lungs -- to break up human wave attacks during the
1980-88 war with Iran.
At Halabja, the limitations of using bombs as a means of spreading
chemical agents was shown by the fact that most people who remained
indoors survived. Those who tried to flee the town, and were caught in
the open, perished. Wind conditions and rain can drastically affect the
killing zone.
On the Iranian front, it was the psychological horror of unseen death
which had more impact on the military situation.
One Iranian mass assault on the main Iraqi line outside Basra was met
by a barrage of chemical-tipped shells, but only 15 Iranian bodies were
discovered. The better part of a 10,000-man division had turned tail and
fled before the threat of unclean extermination. The absence of a wind
to spread the agent helped limit the damage.
The Soviets were reported to have used both Sarin and Tabun against
Chinese forces in the remote Far East during their border clashes on the
Ussuri River in the 1960s.
Sarin attacks the nervous system. First symptoms are nausea, tunnel
vision, and a tightening of the chest. This is followed rapidly by
muscle spasms and paralysis. Death occurs from failure of the lungs or
heart.
During the 1991 Gulf war, all coalition forces were equipped and
trained for possible Iraqi use of chemical shells or missiles. A Czech
Army monitoring team still claims to have detected traces of Sarin,
although both the United States and Britain's own Defence Ministry still
deny that chemicals were employed by Baghdad at any stage of the
conflict.
But all allied troops carried Atropine injectors and took prophylactic
tablets at times of possible chemical threat to minimise the effects of
nerve gas.
As witnessed by the growing number of claims for compensation from
thousands of US and British veterans of the war, the side-effects from
taking these life-saving measures may have been only slightly less
damaging than the reason for doing so.
Chemical weapons have been outlawed by Nato nations for more than a
decade. The Americans, the biggest potential user on the Western side,
had 400 tons stockpiled in Germany for use in artillery shells. All has
now been removed and destroyed in a special facility in Tennessee.
The apparent ease with which some terrorist group has laid hands on
nerve gas is a disturbing new development. A hijacked nuclear weapon has
ceased to be the ultimate nightmare. Chemical or biological agents
introduced into the environment of a busy city hold far more horrors and
would be far harder to detect in time.

Special chemical control unit members wearing anti-gas suits, emerge
from the Kasumigaseki subway station in Tokyo after the Sarin attack
yesterday which killed six people and injured more than 1000 others.

Gavin Bell examines the implications for Britain and the rest of the
world of the nerve gas attack on Tokyo. Could it happen here and how
would we cope?
THE nightmare has become a terrifying reality. The vision of hundreds
of Japanese commuters collapsing after a poison gas attack in the Tokyo
subway has finally confirmed the threat posed to civilian populations by
chemical warfare agents. It has also confirmed what experts in the field
have known for years -- that a similar attack could happen in Britain,
that the authorities are virtually powerless to prevent it, and that
hospitals would be likely to be overwhelmed by the casualties.
So far, such scenarios have been confined to the realms of fantasy,
inspired by Ian Fleming when he endowed James Bond with a fountain pen
that puffed poison gas. The reality, in the modern world of
international crime and terrorism, is much more serious.
According to Dr Frank Barnaby, a former nuclear physicist at
Aldermaston and now a defence consultant, the incident in Japan should
set alarm bells ringing in Britain.
''Obviously it could happen here,'' he said yesterday. ''And if the
perpetrators did their homework properly, it could be much, much
worse.''
Dr Barnaby was surprised that the nerve gas that claimed more than
1000 victims in Tokyo had been released from bottles or similar
containers. ''That was very inefficient,'' he said. ''It would have been
much more effective if aerosol cans had been used. The gas would then
have been dispersed in small droplets, many more people would have
inhaled it or absorbed it through their skin, and of course there would
have been many more fatalities.''
The substance used in Tokyo was Sarin, a compound 20 times more deadly
than potassium cyanide, which was developed by German scientists during
the Second World War. Britain and America took this research further and
produced two even more deadly gases -- soman and tabun -- which can be
manufactured from chemicals easily obtained in this country.
Dr Barnaby, a former director of the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute (Sipri), said: ''The kind of incident one fears is
where an aerosol can containing nerve gas is placed in an underground
railway tunnel, and triggered by a timer or a radio signal. The next
train would then push the gas through the tunnel and on to the platform
of the next station. Similar dispersion through the ventilation system
of a large building would be equally effective.''
Preparing such a device is relatively simple. The formula for Tabun,
the easiest to make, has been widely published and is available in
chemical directories in local libraries. No elaborate equipment is
required, and it could be produced in a garage by a handful of people
with some knowledge of chemistry.
''It is a very frightening prospect and the intelligence communities
are well aware of it, but so far the Government has refused to take it
seriously,'' Dr Barnaby said. ''It seems not to believe that terrorists
would ever resort to such tactics. Hopefully it will learn from the
incident in Japan and take steps to reduce the threat.''
In reality, there seems little any government can do to minimise the
risk. However, Dr Barnaby suggests they could start by monitoring the
manufacture and sale of the components of Sarin, Soman, and Tabun.
''In each of these agents, there are one or two key chemicals which
you need a lot of. To produce a given quantity of Tabun, for example,
you need 10 times as much of one of the key chemicals. The least the
Government could do is to demand that chemical companies report to the
police any unusually large order for such chemicals.
''Other than that, I don't think there's much more one can do.
Frankly, I'm very pessimistic.''
The good news is that the Porton Down biological weapons institute has
been at the forefront of research into antidotes to chemical warfare
agents. The bad news is that hospitals in Britain have only limited
quantities of them.
One of the antidotes, atropine, is used extensively in NHS hospitals
and particularly in eye departments as a muscle relaxant. However Dr
Alistair Hay, a chemical pathologist at Leeds University, says: ''There
are not huge stocks. In an emergency of this nature, clearly there would
not be enough in any given region. It would be a matter of how quickly
extra supplies could be brought in to the affected area.''
Dr Hay admits that hospitals would be severely stretched to deal with
the victims of a mass poison-gas attack. ''I think the agent used would
be recognised fairly quickly, as it was in Japan. But if 1200 patients
suddenly descended on hospitals in Leeds or Glasgow, it would be very
difficult to treat all of them as quickly as required. We simply don't
have those kind of resources.''

THE Government is poised to ask the House of Commons to approve the
European Union's budget for the Common Agricultural Policy on Tuesday in
the annual CAP prices debate. This amounts to expenditure in excess of
#30bn a year and costs the average British family more than #20 a week.
The CAP is a political hot potato for John Major. Having just
extricated himself from a row on a single currency and laid the blame at
his neighbour's doorstep, he is about to attempt to defend the almost
indefensible, the Government's record at the Council of Ministers for
the last 15 years where it has accepted successive increases in
agricultural expenditure. Since 1989, UK Ministers have endorsed a 50%
increase in CAP costs.
The average British citizen may wonder what all this is about and how
we got into this mess of wine lakes and butter mountains. Adding to and
runningthe food mountain and wine lakes could cost the EU as much as
#2242m in 1994.
The Treaty of Rome, signed by the European Economic Community of six
in 1957, recognised the need to integrate widely varying national
policies into a single Community policy. The aim was to ensure adequate
availability of food supplies, guarantee prices to provide those
supplies, and intervention buying to maintain market stability, where
necessary. In fact the CAP has been too successful in reaching its aim
of increasing production.
It was almost inevitable that market changes, technological advance
and social factors would together produce an imbalance in the market
despite various reforms. The most recent set, introduced by Commissioner
Ray MacSharry in 1992, was hailed by the then Agriculture Minister John
Gummer, as a great success in the House of Commons. However, this
introduced 'set-aside', or payment for not farming, and was coupled with
the planned increase in expenditure which is now taking place.
It is only because the EU budget has grown as a whole that Ministers
have been able to claim the percentage share taken by the CAP has
declined. Nevertheless Mr Gummer's view was that ''The CAP reform
package I have negotiated is very much in the United Kingdom's
interest.''
It is widely believed, outwith the agricultural sector, that too much
is being spent to artificially prop up prices and production in certain
sectors. Although the GATT Uruguay round resolved the problem of export
subsidy arrangements, at least for the time being, other problems loom
large on the horizon. The CAP has not kept pace with today's
environmental and health agendas.
The environmental impact of the kind of intensive farming it continues
to encourage is under critical scrutiny. Its #2.5m a day subsidy to
tobacco production cannot be squared with any rational health policy.
Its complex legislation is an open invitation to fraud and chicanery.
For example, it suffices to misdescribe a type of cheese to attract a
massive, illegal export subsidy.
But the biggest single challenge, which could blow the whole system
apart, is EU enlargement to Eastern Europe.
Farming in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic is low cost, low
wage and fragmented. CAP subsidies applied to these countries could
double existing costs if the system were applied without reform.
Mr Major's problems here are three-fold. Firstly, Labour might succeed
in exposing the fact that his Government has agreed and continues to
agree to higher rates of CAP expenditure. Secondly, in the UK, this goes
to an essentially Conservative constituency. In 1995, about #2000m will
be spent in Britain on price support to British farmers. Thirdly, the
national veto in the Council of Ministers means that the French and
others can block reform of CAP.
Mr Major cannot both take a Euro-sceptic approach on abolishing this
veto and hold out hope for real change in the CAP.
Finally, he has no proposals. Labour will probably argue for a rural
economic policy with support for rural industries, direct income aid to
small farmers and an environmentally oriented rural fund to aid
sustainable development. The irony is that in the only area where the
Government opposes a free market, the option it has chosen cannot be
sustained.

HEALTH Secretary Virginia Bottomley wants midwives to think again
about their vote to abandon a no-strike policy in pursuit of an increase
on their 1% national pay award. Their anger over the rise is shared by
nurses.
The historic decision by members of the Royal College of Midwives ends
the professional body's 115-year tradition of not taking industrial
action. Midwives will now be balloted on what action to take.
The Government wants nurses and midwives to negotiate pay packages
with their local trusts of up to 3%. But the health workers claim they
should get the rise automatically and not every Trust can afford the
increase.
As MARGARET VAUGHAN discovered, individual trusts are sensitive on the
issue, not at all anxious to allow their midwives or nurses to speak
openly about their grievance. Confidentiality clauses mean individuals
are worried about the repercussions of speaking publicly.
Yesterday was an oridinary day in the life of one senior midwife.
It is two o'clock and Helen is about to begin her shift as sister in
one of our busiest maternity units. This is her own account . . .
'THE sister in charge does the handover, and we get a rundown of the
ladies on the ward. One half of our ward is closed. It's being
renovated, so we're working with the chaos of painting and workmen all
around. We're on the low-risk side, so our four ladies are considered to
be those who'll have normal labours. We're not expecting any major
problems.
We've got five midwives on and two students. Fairly healthy staffing
levels today. Nice change. Two of the ladies are in early labour, the
other two have come in to be induced. Their babies are overdue. They're
nervous, of course, and they need reassurance and soothing. The early
shift started them off this morning, using a prostaglandin gel. We'll
have to repeat that this afternoon.
Before that, they need monitoring. We listen in to the babies'
heartbeats. Check whether our ladies are having contractions. We do a
repeat trace on the cardiotacograph -- CTG for short -- which is a belt
round the mum's bump, doing a trace of the babies' heartbeats for about
20 minutes to check they're not in difficulties. Get the medical staff
to check the traces. We'll do a repeat trace in an hour.
I'm looking after the two ladies who've come in to be induced, helped
by a student. Hurray, one of our inductions goes into labour and the
student stays with her while I go to check on the other lady who's still
waiting for contractions to start. Pop in to see the other two ladies in
labour, make sure they're comfortable. They are. Some reassuring words
and smiles and back to check on the inductions.
Nearly four o'clock and we get a call to say there are several ladies
coming up from admissions and the ante-natal ward in various stages of
labour. We can't take them all. Our delivery rooms are full. Only the
theatre's empty.
It's five o'clock and we take two of the women in labour. The others
are sent over to the main labour ward. I leave the student with one of
the women who's being induced. They're both now in early labour.
I'm dotting from room to room, overseeing the two other ladies whilst
one midwife goes off to deliver one of the ladies who's just come in.
She just made it! I cover her room while she's delivering. So I'm
covering for her, checking blood pressure and contractions and popping
out now and again to keep a check on all the others.
Still doing quarter-hour checks on the ladies who are being induced.
It's going slowly but surely and they're comfortable. Do hourly
heartbeat checks, blood pressures, on all our ladies. Observe and
palpate the contractions. Make sure they're all getting the pain relief
they want and need.
All will have filled in discussion sheets, setting out what they want
in the way of pain relief and assistance, when they arrive, with the
midwife who first sees them.
Spend some time reassuring the women that they're doing well. Take
some time just to talk to them.
It's 6.30. Too busy to go off for a break so send down for a cup of
tea and a turkey sandwich and gulp it down standing up in the duty room
office. That's common now. If we're busy, as we are most of the time,
it's not physically possible to walk away from a woman and say I'm off
for my tea.
But the rest of the staff haven't had a break yet, and the ladies are
all fairly stable so I send one midwife off for some tea for the other
midwives and take over for her.
Get the medical student to cover so the woman won't be on her own when
I'm called away. One lady has a problem. Her epidural, an anaesthetic
round the spinal fluid, doesn't seem to be relieving her pain. She's
distressed. Ring for the anaesthetist. Maybe it needs topped up. Get the
medical staff to examine her, she's got a lot of pain and rectal
pressure and she's 9cm dilated. They top her up.
The two other ladies are on diamorphine, another is walking about. She
doesn't want pain relief and she's doing well.
The student is called away to do a delivery. One of our inductions is
very sore. Thinks she's about to have the baby. Check but she's not
ready to deliver. Have to organise more pain relief to tide her over
until she's ready. It's 7.30 and her official midwife is free to be with
her for the delivery. I hand her back over.
Go back to the two ladies I started off with. One has been walking
about; spend some time with her. She wants a bath to relax. Comes back
and says she's feeling wonderful. Listen in to the baby's heartbeat.
Going great, good strong contractions.
Lady who's just started in first stage is beginning to contract more
frequently, she's coping really well. It's getting on for nine, just an
hour to go then I'm off duty and can sit down.
Urgent call from one of the midwifes. She needs support. Lady has
developed problems. Bit of a crisis. Baby is having big drops in
heartbeat, big decelerations. Try to help midwife get blood samples from
baby's head to see if it's getting enough oxygen. Very difficult. Can't
get a successful sample. She's fully dilated and ready to have baby.
Decide to deliver fast, using a Ventouse, a suction cap. It's a wee
girl. It's after 10 now, about quarter past, and the baby is covered in
meconium, a sticky black-green discharge from the baby's bowel --
there's feotal distress. Call the paediatrician. Try to reassure new mum
and anxious dad.
Clean up the baby, suck out the meconium. All is well, and parents are
thrilled. Everyone's happy. We're all relieved. Dramatic end to the
shift.
Go back to check on my two original ladies. They're coming on nicely.
Hand them over. It's nearly 10.30, should have been off duty ages ago
but you can't walk away from problems . . .
I've been a midwife for 13 years, a sister for eight. We're being
encouraged to take on a greater managerial role, working in a
supervisory capacity to junior midwives, students, directly or
indirectly supervising all levels of staff.
It's changed a lot since I started. I won't say it's not rewarding, it
is. But people should know there are very major difficulties for us --
financially and because of the growing demands that are put on us, by
the public as well as by the managers.
We do try to provide a good service but I wish people understood the
constraints we work under. It's a lot to do with the finances and the
way the trusts are being set up. We try our best. Really. It's not easy.
The greatest satisfaction of all is when we know the mums and dads are
happy with the care they get. We do want things to work out really well.
That means we get some satisfaction from it. We want it to be like that.
Sadly, it's not always like that now. Not any longer.'

Chief Financial Editor R E Dundas surveys the drift of the
Government's tax policies, as pressure mounts on Chancellor Clarke to
reverse the trend
THE tax increases which come into effect in on April 6 are the last of
the delayed measures brought forward by Norman Lamont, the ex-Chancellor
of the Exchequer, and Kenneth Clarke, his successor, to restore order to
the public finances which were ravaged by the protracted recession of
the early nineties.
The two main changes are the restriction of the married couple's
allowance and of mortgage interest tax relief (Miras) from the current
20% to 15%. These measures were announced by Chancellor Clarke in his
November 1993 Budget for implementation in the coming 1995/96 tax year.
They should have been accompanied by an increase in the rate of VAT on
domestic power from 8% to 17.5%, but this was voted down by the House of
Commons in December and replaced by increased excise duties on petrol,
alcohol, and tobacco which came into effect at the start of the calendar
year.
The extra VAT on domestic power would have brought in about #1000m.
The Miras restriction is worth about #900m to the Revenue and the
reduced relief on the married couple's allowance about #800m.
The last two will reduce personal disposable income by 0.4%, according
to calculations by James Capel, the City stockbrokers. Adam Cole,
Capel's UK economist, regards these measures as being ''fairly
trivial''. Counteracting their effect on personal incomes will be a
likely increase in average earnings growth and a further fall in
unemployment.
By contrast the measures which came into effect in the current tax
year took about #8200m out of the economy, and, along with the three
half-point increases in interest rates since last September, have put a
damper on consumer spending and, apparently, slowed the economy down
despite an upsurge in exports.
In the last Budget in November 1994, the Chancellor was able to index
the main personal allowances, except the married couple's, additional
personal, and widow's bereavement allowances, in line with inflation.
This was the first time this had occurred since the March 1992 Budget,
just before the General Election.
In addition the lower rate (20%) band was extended by #200 to #3200
(#100 more than indexation) and the starting point for higher rate (40%)
tax was increased by #600 to #24,300.
The biggest changes affect those who are 65 and over. Their personal
allowances have been increased by #430, but the benefit of this tapers
off if the increased income limit of #14,600 is exceeded. In addition
the married couple's age allowances will be increased by #330 as a
result of a measure announced in the November 1993 Budget which was
designed to compensate for the disproportionate effect on the over 65s
of restricting the relief to 15%.
In all, these tax concessions cost #925m from a non-indexed base, and
#230m from an indexed base. The Budget increases in excise duties did
not fully compensate for these costs to the Revenue.
Tax tables, published by the Inland Revenue on the night of the
Budget, show the limited impact on net incomes, less than #100 a year in
either direction, of the tax changes coming into effect next month.
The figures include the effect of restricting the married couple's
allowance to 15%, but not of reducing the tax relief on Miras, which
will show up in higher monthly payments to building societies. On a loan
of #30,000 or more, the cost will be about #10 a month, depending on the
interest rate in force, and represents more than double the likely
increase in tax bills most people are likely to face.
Among the over 65s those with incomes of #8000 or more will have net
savings of just over #30 a year in their tax bills. In a few cases the
savings will be greater, but those with incomes of #20,000 and more will
pay extra tax of #56.
By contrast the bulk of those under 65 will be paying more tax, mostly
#56 extra a year. However, because of the higher starting point for 40%
tax, those earning over #30,000 will save #46 a year on their tax bills.
This will show up in their pay packets, but the benefit will be
eliminated once the effect of restricting Miras is taken into account.
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown claimed yesterday that a typical family
will be over #1000 a year worse off in April. This is one of these
calculations, beloved of politicians, which throws in everything bar the
kitchen sink.
As well as tax increases, higher mortgage bills are brought into the
reckoning. It is also claimed that mortgage insurance will cost up to
#280 a year for a typical, home owner.
Come the next Budget in November the Chancellor may well be in a more
generous mood. If everything goes according to plan the Public Sector
Borrowing Requirement, which soared during the recession, should have
fallen to around 3% of gross domestic product as a result of tax
increases, tight control of Government spending, and the recoverey in
the economy.
Three percent is the EU's target for public borrowing under the
guidelines of the Maastricht Treaty, and should open the door for tax
cuts to come into effect in as year's time.
However, these will be limited, certainly in relation to the increases
which have been imposed in the last three years. Mr Clarke will not want
to repeat Lord Lawson's mistake of fuelling inflation by giving away too
much at the wrong time.
But he will be under enormous political pressure to start reversing
the tide. It is too early to speculate on what he will do or how much he
will be able to spare from his war chest. Unless he throws fiscal
responsibility out of the window his measures are bound to be seen in
many quarters as too little, too late.

<TEXT>
A BUS driver yesterday described the night three Girl Guides and two
of their leaders died when he crashed into an overhead rail bridge.
Mr Campbell Devlin, 30, was crying as he addressed Glasgow Sheriff
Court. Asked why he was crying, he said: ''What I have done to the
families.''
Miss Elizabeth Munro, prosecuting, then asked him: ''So you accept
some responsibility for the accident?'' He replied: ''Yes, I was driving
the bus.''
Mr Devlin, of Rannoch Street, Cathcart, Glasgow, denies driving
dangerously in West Street in Glasgow's South Side on September 18 last
and failing to observe traffic signs warning of a low bridge.
The charge states that the double-deck bus collided with the bridge
and that Mr Devlin caused the deaths of Guide leaders Mrs Robina
Dougall, 47, of Boon Drive; Mrs Mary McGreskin, 39, of Drummore Road;
and Guides Catherine McKnight, 10, of Pitmilly Road; Margaret Riddick,
11, of Bankglen Road; and Laura Cullen, 10, of Belsyde Avenue; all
Drumchapel, Glasgow.
It is alleged that 15 Guides, aged between 10 and 15, were injured,
six of them seriously.
Earlier, the court heard that Mr Devlin was unsure of the route on the
way back from an outing to Ayr, and was being directed back to
Drumchapel by leader Mrs Mima Dunlop, 44, of Gorsewood, Bishopbriggs.
She drove ahead of the bus and in West Street looked back, saw what
she thought was an open-topped bus, then realised it was the one with
the Guides.
Mr Devlin told Mr David Burns, QC, defending, that he passed his test
to drive a bus in April last year and a few weeks later got a job with
the Clydeside 2000 bus company.
He agreed that the bus company had told him to use the Clyde Tunnel
returning from Ayr but he was led towards the Kingston Bridge. It was
while being questioned by Mr Burns about what happened when the bus
turned into West Street that he began sobbing loudly and sat down.
He agreed he was unaware there were two bridges 12 metres apart or
that the second bridge was lower.
He got safely under the first bridge and saw no signs warning that a
low bridge only 10ft 6in high was ahead.
He did not brake. ''I thought I was all right.''
It was the first time he had been in West Street, he said.
Questioned by Miss Munro, Mr Devlin said he had been driving the 13ft
6in high bus slowly and accepted it was his responsibility to look out
for hazards such as low bridges.
Asked why he did not stop at the bridge, he replied: ''I was following
the car.''
Miss Munro: ''Did you really feel confident you could get under the
bridge?'' Mr Devlin: ''Yes''.
He accepted that it was his responsibility to look out for warning
signs and not to follow the car.
However, he added: ''I was following the car and I thought it was all
right and my mind was on other things.''
He had put the tachograph chart, which records speed, time, and
distance, in the wrong way, and the bus's speedometer was not working.
The trial continues.

THREE judges yesterday expressed concern over the lack of legal
protection for council workers dismissed when their jobs were
privatised, and suggested the Government should reconsider providing
protection for such employees.
Lord Ross, Lord Justice Clerk, Lord Morison, and Lord Morton were
dealing with a case brought by eight men who lost their jobs with
Stirling District Council.
The court agreed with an industrial tribunal that the men, members of
the Transport and General Workers' union, had no remedy against the
district council for unfair dismissal because the local authority's
responsibilities were transferred to the company which took over the
council's direct labour organisation.
A union spokesman described the outcome as disappointing: ''We won the
argument but lost the case.''
The men worked as gardeners, gravediggers, and groundsmen.
Giving the opinion of the court, Lord Morison said that to comply with
the Local Government Act 1988, the council had to submit the work of its
direct services organisation to competitive tender.
On October 8, 1992, the contract was awarded to a company called
Brophy, a UK-wide firm. On the same date, notices of dismissal were
issued to the eight employees although they did not take effect until
December 31.
They asked an industrial tribunal for reinstatement on the ground that
they had been unfairly dismissed by virtue of the Transfer of
Undertakings (Protection of Employment Regulations) 1981, brought in
following an EU Directive.
The tribunal agreed the dismissals had been unfair but ruled against
the workers on the basis that liability to provide redress had been
transferred to Brophy, which released the council from responsibility.
In February last year, the employment appeal tribunal reversed that
finding, ruling that a proper construction of the regulations did not
exclude the liability of the district council.
However, the case continued, with Stirling appealing to the Court of
Session, which yesterday agreed with the first tribunal's decision.
Lord Morison said the court took the view that there was no ambiguity
in the relevant regulation which provided that on completion of a
transfer all the liabilities under it, including contracts of
employment, were transferred.
The judge pointed out that a European Court decision in 1989 had made
it clear that EU countries had the power to provide for joint liability
of a transferor (such as Stirling district) and transferee (such as
Brophy): the UK had chosen not to exercise that power.
The judge said: ''A provision for joint liability after transfer of an
undertaking seems to us to be a sensible and desirable measure for the
protection of employees and, in light of this and perhaps other cases,
it may now be thought that the decision not to make it was unfortunate
and should be reconsidered.''

SCOTTISH Office Minister George Kynoch yesterday attacked the
''hypocrisy'' of the Labour Party and described its manifesto as ''long
on promise and short on performance''.
Mr Kynoch, the MP for Kincardine and Deeside, took the opportunity of
the launch of the Conservative manifesto for Aberdeenshire to attack
Labour's pledge to ''continue to wage war on waste and inefficiency,
setting new high standards for the level and quality of public
services''.
''Does this not fly in the face of Labour's record in local
government,'' he said.
There was no sign of fiscal responsibility, just more promises of
spending and no apparent way of paying for it.
Mr Kynoch claimed that only the Conservatives could deliver improved
services and lower council tax.

VOTING Labour at the local elections on April 6 is a vote for
emasculated councils stripped of their powers by a new Scottish
Parliament, Scottish Secretary Ian Lang claimed yesterday.
Campaigning with Conservative candidates in Fife, Mr Lang said his
party's pledge to deliver lower council taxes and better services was a
powerful and attractive combination to voters.
The contrast between Tory-run councils and those controlled by Labour
and the SNP was ''stark'', he claimed.
Voters do not need to imagine the difference a Conservative-run
council could make. They only need to look at the record of the present
Conservative-held councils to see that pledge being delivered, Mr Lang
said.
At a news conference in Aberdeen, Mr Malcolm Bruce, the Scottish
Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, called for a change in Treasury
rules to allow public bodies the commercial freedom to get access to
private capital.
''The Scottish Secretary's decision to ban investment on the basis of
notional capital receipts and purchase lease-back schemes has massively
dented local government's ability to act as an engine for investment,''
he claimed.
He said councils should be able to finance local projects themselves.

A DIRE warning about the future cost of Scottish water and sewerage
services was issued in Edinburgh yesterday by Welsh Nationalist leader
Dafydd Wigley MP.
The Plaid Cymru chief had come north to lend support to the SNP's
local elections campaign by describing what had happened since Welsh
water was privatised in 1989.
Speaking in Edinburgh, Mr Wigley told how there had been a 75%
increase in water charges in Wales compared to the 25% reductions which
had been promised.
The average Welsh bill is #254 a year compared to #132 in Scotland.
Under Government plans, three Scottish public water authorities are
beingcreated to run the services presently under the wing of local
councils.
SNP councils are pledged to monitor the new quangos and to press for
water to be returned to local democratic control.
Mr Wigley warned that the Tories would seek to privatise Scottish
water by attrition. The new boards would be stuffed with Tory placemen,
with as much work put out to competitive tendering as possible.
SNP vice president Andrew Welsh MP said the creation of three new
unelected water authorities was privatisation ''in two sips instead of
one gulp.''
Later, at the launch of the SNP manifesto for the new Edinburgh
single-tier council, candidates claimed they would form an enlarged
group on the new authority. They are contesting all 58 seats on the
council.

AS senior Conservatives continued to fight over Europe last night,
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang said in Brussels he was still as European as
the day he announced his post-election ''pro-active'' European policy.
Mr Lang was visiting Scotland Europa's offices in central Brussels as
part of a two-day visit to the EU capital. He described Scotland Europa
as Scotland's ''agency'' in the European Union. During his visit, he
will have talks with commissioners and Euro-MPs.
After the 1992 General Election, Mr Lang's first keynote speech was on
Europe when he announced in Edinburgh the creation of Scotland Europa,
which acts as a bridge between Scottish business and the EU.
He said he would continue to be proactive in Scotland's interest in
Europe, where completion of the single market would provide more
opportunities for business.
Mr Lang listed the benefits Scotland would have from improved road
communications and on the rail network under the so-called
Trans-European Network programme.
Scottish exports were at an all-time record, he said, noting that this
was at a time when the EU was still not yet completely out of recession.
He later told a gathering at Scotland Europa that he felt it was
important for Scotland to continue with its own direct access to the EU.
* Meanwhile, Fife is poised to take advantage of the burgeoning
information superhighway, as the result of a #9m development in Dalgety
Bay, opened by Mr Lang.
Mr Lang said he saluted AT &amp; T for its commitment to Scotland.
With 95% of the company's products being exported, it augured well for
Scotland and the UK, he said.

THE Queen Canute of housework, JENNIFER CUNNINGHAM, reflects on life
among the dirty dishes and Mesolithic apple cores
NEWS that housework is a particularly hazardous occupation comes just
in time for spring cleaners to take safety precautions. Elbow and knee
protectors, maybe topped by a skid lid if you've polished the floor,
might help to reduce the growing list of accidents due to
over-enthusiastic dusting, vacuuming and scrubbing.
All the statistics suggest it is unlikely that people will give up
this dangerous sport. Why climb so precariously to the furthest cobweb?
Because it's there.
If some stray surveyor of social mores accosted you with a clipboard
and demanded to know how many hours each week you spent on housework,
would you dare to answer as one London woman did, 55?
Most women in the UK claim to spend between six and seven-and-a-half
hours a week on housework. How they can be so cut and dried about it is
a mystery to us house-spouses who expend our energies as latter-day
Canutes, unsuccessfully stemming the tide.
It depends, of course, on how housework is defined. At around an hour
a day, it cannot include cooking, but presumably involves the clearing
up afterwards. That alone can take an hour after children have been
practising their culinary skills, but perhaps that falls into some other
category, such as childcare or creative play.
Researchers have an unerring instinct for those neat people whose
houses do not require any work, where tidying is not an archaeological
excavation to reach the comics and apple cores of the Mesolithic age,
but a mere wipe and polish to secure necessary hygiene.
Is housework which amounts to more than a whizz round with the vacuum
cleaner and the washing of dishes admissible, or is there a general
conspiracy that houses somehow clean themselves except for a few
ladylike twitchings of furnishings?
According to one survey, Scotswomen spend an hour and ahalf longer on
cleaning each week than Welsh women.
In London and Wales, however, housewives are more likely to hide the
clutter behind the sofa when visitors call unexpectedly, and those least
likely to cut corners are in Scotland. On the other hand, Scotland is
where people do not even attempt to hide the clutter.
Dubbed ''homebodies,'' they are defined as tolerating a fair amount of
confusion and chaos, provided the house is comfortable, probably have
young children and will clear toys or piles of ironing off the kitchen
table when visitors arrive.
What is left to deduction is how much one set of answers depends on
the other. Is it that Scottish husbands are so fed up of wading their
way through the clutter that they have no option but to do their share
of getting rid of it?
Upsetting commonly-held opinion, a survey of housework habits revealed
that new man is a northern species in Britain, commonest in Scotland and
least likely to be spotted in the far West of England or East Anglia.
Men are more likely to help around the house the further north they
live, according to the responses of women in six regions of England and
Scotland. In Glasgow, 14% of men took an equal share of chores with
their partners, compared with 10% in the East and West of England.
In the South of England, 49% of women said they bore all the
responsibility for housework without any help from their partner.

Is macho office politics getting you down? Is your wife's salary too
little to live on? Yes, and no, says Andrew Popple. Here's how a
househusband earned his kitchen cred
WELL, I've just finished my six-month probation as a stay-at-home
husband and father, and I can tell you that I'm not likely to go looking
for another ''real'' job, at least for the time being.
I felt I had cracked it the day my wife walked in from another busy
day at the office to receive the greeting from our seven-year-old:
''Hurry up Mum, dinner's ready.'' No tearful reunion, not even a
''hello''. Just the way I used to be treated . . .
For us, the realisation that it was my wife who enjoyed working in
business, whereas I've always been a square peg in a round hole, made
the decision reasonably easy. It's not a life that would suit every male
-- it doesn't suit some females, either, but they aren't often given the
option.
Some aspects of the job -- and that is what it is, even if the only
pay is two kids still alive to tell the tale each bedtime -- are
undoubtedly more difficult for a man. This is only because the world
does not expect to see a male in the role. But for the most part, any
notion that it is an easy life for a woman, but impossible for a man, is
nonsense, on both counts.
What key differences are there for a man doing the job?
* FIRST, it is lonely. You do not fit into a ''normal'' category, and
there are few people brave enough to relate to an ''abnormal'' person or
situation.
Realistically, I do not believe that many of the mums, nannies or
childminders think I am a menace to society, or a threat to their
marriages (fanciable I am not!) -- but a certain distance is kept. Most
will chat at the school gate, waiting for chuck-out time, but that is
where it ends.
The relationships remain so superficial that I have yet to be invited
to coffee, or had an invitation accepted, although these things must be
kept in perspective: it is not compulsory to like someone. As I am by
nature a loner, this is not a serious problem for me, but it may be for
others.
* SECONDLY, if you take over, as I did, from having been a
12-hours-out-the-house man, the learning curve is quite steep -- like
vertical!
Although I had been Mum and Dad to our daughter some six years ago,
when our son was born very ill and was sent to hospitals far away from
home, the routine had changed out of all recognition in the intervening
period. The more resourceful child can capitalise on this lack of
knowledge to institute some changes of their own -- such as: ''Mummy
gives us sweets when she gets petrol''; not true, but nice try,
sunshine.
* THIRDLY, your perspective must change. You think that your role at
work is complex and important, that you are indispensable? Unless your
name is Leeson, there is little you can do which is more tangibly and
immediately wrong than not having tea ready, or worse, not being there
to meet the kids at the end of the school day. Where would they go?
The first-line responsibility for everything from purchasing and stock
control (food, toilet rolls) through financial management (housekeeping)
to personal development (homework, invites to other children, play,
censorship of children's TV) is awesome when you realise that the
ultimate sanction -- the sack -- and the final gesture -- resigning --
are not available.
Power freaks should just take a moment to consider what difference
they make in their organisation by being there, and then compare that
with my role. But there again, you have status to go with the power, and
we housespouses have none, so maybe you win, after all. If that is what
you want.
Have the children had any problems? Not that I have seen. Nobody has
refused to let their child come and play at our house -- that I know of.
If they have, I'd rather they kept away; their difficulties are no
concern of mine. And we reckon that the children are happier and more
settled with me around than they were with their childminder, despite
her being really great with them. She had to go to make the finances
balance, and is still much missed.
Perhaps surprisingly, the loser, if there is one, is my wife. She now
feels the responsibility for being the breadwinner -- her job and its
importance haven't changed, but her perception has. A real downer can be
that she feels she is losing touch, with guilt creeping in (''I'm not a
good mother . . .'' -- ''No, but I'm doing OK and we only need one . .
.''), and perhaps a bit of envy that I, too, can cobble together eatable
meals, mend knees, sew on name tags.
Perversely, though, she is now more free to work longer hours, and she
soon will be doing the 12-hour days I left behind.
So what else should you consider? If you are hoping to do a bit of
work from home, perhaps a career change, you must be flexible. One
minute I am shopping, loading the washing machine, kicking the
diswasher. The next I am trying to arrange a business meeting (mornings
only, I'm not available after lunch; they must think I'm a wino) or
prepare a report.
Then I'm listening avidly and responding to a 20-minute commentary on
who did what to whom in the playground, and trying to correct homework
with patience, tact and understanding. Half way through this the phone
rings -- have to discuss the outcomes of that meeting and, oh blast, I
haven't prepared the vegetables so dinner will be late, perhaps too late
for the Brownie who is collected at 6.15.
I find this the most difficult aspect -- multi-tasking a broader range
of topics than you would expect to cope with at work, with no common
theme.
I have truly missed doing dinner only once. Having prepared it all, I
got engrossed in a computer game with my son and never turned the oven
on. Tip: when panic sets in, Nutella Pieces (write for recipe).
Another of the difficult decisions: whether to walk the Campsies or
not this morning. Yes, within certain bounds I have freedom, the like of
which I did not know existed. As I sit here typing, I remember that a
few hours ago I was singing to myself while making the first tracks in
the snow in brilliant sunshine.
Perhaps now you can see why I would not wish to give this up -- it
suits me, and us the family. Until society realises that the man will
not always be the main wage earner, and that men do not always have
ulterior motives in talking to women, there will be more difficulties
for men in doing what is already a substantial job, but these are not
insurmountable.
It is all a question of attitude, of everyone concerned. If the
children had not been supportive, they could have sabotaged the attempt
without realising it. As it is, my wife and I each appreciate better
what the other has to put up with, and the children see both parents
more contented in their role.
What more could you ask?

THE UK Independence Party will throw its hat into the Perth and
Kinross by-election ring tonight at a meeting in Glasgow.
The fringe party, which is led by Glaswegian Dr Alan Sked, last night
would say only that the candidate who will be named at the meeting would
be a ''leading Scottish expert in a very important field''.
It will be the first time the party, which was formed in August 1993,
has fought a by-election in Scotland. It is very much at the embryonic
stage north of the Border, with three regional organisers in the throes
of setting up local branches.
Its literature describes it as ''new, moderate, non-sectarian, and
dedicated to giving Britain back to British voters''.
Dr Sked, 47, said last night from party HQ in London: ''We have fought
by-elections in England but this is our first outing in Scotland. At the
Euro elections, we won 157,000 votes after 10 months in existence and
beat the Green Party, which wasn't bad.''
The party, as it name suggests, is in favour of the UK remaining
independent rather than becoming part of a European super state.
Dr Sked, who studied at Glasgow University and who now lectures at the
London School of Economics, stood as a Liberal in Paisley in 1970.
He later founded the Anti-Federalist League which was opposed to moves
towards European integration. It was his success on this ticket, when he
came fourth of 19 candidates at a by-election at Newbury, which gave him
the idea of forming the UK Independent Party.
He was very much looking forward to his party fighting the Perth and
Kinross seat.
He said: ''Our message to the voters in Perth would be that all other
parties wish to break up the UK and make it a province of Europe. This
is not in the interests of Scotland and the UK. We want to regenerate
democracy by getting ourselves out of the system which has cost us #230
billion.''
Tonight's meeting will be held at the Parish Hall in George Street,
off George Square, and starts at 7.30.

A PRICELESS bronze sculpture by Henry Moore, the most famous of all
his works, has been seriously damaged by vandals in Dumfriesshire.
The King and Queen, which has stood unharmed for 40 years in the open
air on 56-year-old Henry Keswick's Glenkiln estate, near Dumfries, has
been beheaded. Yesterday, saw marks were obvious on the narrow necks of
its two figures.
The work, on an outcrop of rock overlooking a loch, can be seen from a
minor public road and, although the vandals would have had to climb over
a fence and up a hill, they could have got there within a few minutes
from the road.
Police say they do not know the motive for the damage. Inspector John
Houston, of Dumfries and Galloway Police, said yesterday: ''The heads of
both figures have been cut off and have not been recovered. The damage
is substantial but we cannot put a value on it at this stage.''
He added: ''We believe the damage was caused towards the end of last
week. We do not know the reason for it. The CID is investigating.''
Mr Houston said there were no plans at this stage to search the loch,
part of Dumfries and Galloway's water supply scheme, for the missing
heads.
The King and Queen is regarded by experts as the ultimate masterpiece
by Moore, who died in 1986.
Originally, four casts of the sculpture were made in 1952. The first
went to Middelheim open-air sculpture park near Antwerp, Belgium.
Another was bought by Mr Curt Valentin's gallery in New York, and was
later sold to Mr Jo Hirshhorn for his museum in Washington.
The third was bought by Mr David Astor, a former editor of the
Observer newspaper, who kept it on his back lawn at St John's Wood,
London, until 1976, when he sold it to the Norton Simon Museum in
Pasenda, California.
The fourth was bought by Mr Keswick's father, the late Mr Tony
Keswick, a director of Jardine Matheson. A fifth cast was made in 1957
for the Tate Gallery in London.
The Glenkiln bronze, looking across the border from Scotland into
England, was bought by Mr Keswick in 1954 and erected on its present
site the following year.
It was destined to become the best known of all the castings. Moore
was offered a huge sum of money to make an extra cast and asked Mr
Keswick, as the only private owner of the first edition, if he had any
objection.
Mr Keswick did object but Moore went ahead. However, to leave the
first edition inviolate, he listed it as 5+1 not 6. In his will, he
stipulated that no casts of his work should be made after his death.
The King and Queen is one of six sculptures on Mr Keswick's 5000-acre
estate. The others are Moore's Standing Figure, Two-Piece Reclining
Figure No 1, and Glenkiln Cross; Visitation by Sir Jacob Epstein, and
John the Baptist by Auguste Rodin.
They can all be seen from the public road and have become a major
tourist attraction in the area. Last year, a book about the sculptures
by Mr John McEwan was published by Canongate Press, with photographs by
Mr John Haddington.
Over the years, the Keswicks have received abusive letters asking how
they dared desecrate the countryside with ''hideous bits of metal and
the like'' but grateful letters, especially from foreign visitors,
predominate.
Mr Keswick was not available yesterday for comment. He is believed to
be abroad.

A QUARTER of Scotland's miners have bought shares in their industry in
a deal which ended at the weekend, it was announced yesterday.
Two hundred and fifty of the 1000 employees of the newly-formed
Scottish Coal Company opted to buy between 1000 and 20,000 shares,
valued at #1 each.
The parent body of the Scottish Coal Company -- Mining (Scotland) Ltd
-- bought over the assets of British Coal in Scotland in a #45m deal at
the end of 1994.
The offer, involving 12% of the shares in the firm, was made to all
employees at the Longannet deep mine, nine open-cast sites, and at the
company's HQ at Corstorphine.

AN act of revenge by a drunken member of a London pornographic cinema
club who was refused admission after a row over entrance charges, last
year caused the deaths of 11 men and left 15 others seriously injured,
an Old Bailey jury was told yesterday.
It is alleged that tailor's cutter David Lauwers, known to his friends
as Deaf Dave, having been butted and thrown out of the New City Cinema
Club, later returned with a can of petrol and set fire to the building
-- knowing that lives would be endangered.
''This is not a case of a man committing a dangerous act which went
tragically wrong,'' the Crown insisted. ''It was a dangerous act where
the intention was to do harm.''
Mr Lauwers, aged 35, denies three ''representative'' charges of murder
and two of arson. A sign-language expert, sitting in the dock with Mr
Lauwers and three prison officers, interpreted the evidence for him.
Yesterday, defence counsel Mr Rock Tansey, QC, concentrated
cross-examination on a crunching noise, heard by a Scottish witness to
the fracas, as Mr Lauwers was ''nutted'' by a stand-in employee at the
club.
The Scottish witness was the first of the club members who will give
evidence and who have unusually being granted anonymity because of the
peculiar circumstances of the murder and arson trial.
Sir Lawrence Verney, the Recorder of London, has accepted the argument
that there is a need for protection of witnesses in view of the
sensitivity of the club and publicity the case had attracted.
The Scot, having written his name down, was thereafter described in
court as Mr Z.
He described how the lights suddenly went out and thick black smoke
belched through the private cinema as he and others watched a porno
movie.
Doors had been locked, he said, and they couldn't get out of the club.
''We couldn't do nothing. We just had to lie down. I went to sleep.''
By that he agreed he went unconscious.
He agreed that he had heard a crunching noise as the sole doorman, an
elderly man, had head-butted a man during an argument over entrance to
the club.
Mr John Nutting, prosecuting, told the jury Mr Lauwers then went to a
nearby petrol station and bought a can of petrol before returning to the
four-storey terraced building in St John Street which housed the cinema
club. The prosecution claims he poured petrol at the entrance, then set
it alight.
The two cinemas in the building, which showed continuous pornographic
films, were engulfed in flames.
''There were about 30 men in the two cinemas. Pandemonium broke out as
they realised the mortal danger they faced,'' Mr Nutting told the jury.
One of those who survived ''managed to preserve his hold on life by
finding a crack in the floor where cleaner air was ventilating'', said
Mr Nutting.
Removal men working nearby manoeuvred their lorry close to a
first-floor ledge where survivors had climbed from windows.
One man died after diving in desperation from a window, the jury was
told.
According to the prosecution, having started the blaze, Mr Lauwers
went to a pub and then visited a friend with six cans of lager.
He told the friend he was in trouble and had set a building on fire.
After watching news bulletins, he told his friend: ''Christ, I did not
know it was as bad as that. I could be in for a murder charge here'', Mr
Nutting told the court.
Two days after the fire, Mr Lauwers turned up at a police station and
allegedly confessed to causing the fire at ''King's Cross''.
The trial continues.

EXPERTS are comparing the bacteria which killed pensioner Gladys
McDonald in Falkirk Royal Infirmary last week with the infection that
left young mother Linda Smith unconscious for 41 days when she
contracted necrotising fasciitis, the flesh-eating disease.
The tests at the Central Reference Laboratory in London will show if
the bacteria were related but, even if they do turn out to come from the
same family, that will not prove a link between the cases, the
hospital's medical director, Mr Douglas Harper said yesterday.
Doctors already know that the strain of bacteria in Mrs Smith's case
was not the type which usually causes necrotising fasciitis. She
survived the disease which she contracted after the caesarian birth of
her fourth daughter.
''If they come up with a similar organism, we'll have to say crikey,
are we overlooking something -- but I don't think we are,'' he said.
Both Mrs McDonald, 69, and Mrs Smith, 27, contracted the disease in
the infirmary but Mr Harper said doctors had treble checked and were
certain there was no infection lurking in the hospital.
Meanwhile, a Fife man is recovering after necrotising fasciitis
infected flesh in his stomach and legs following a routine hernia
operation last December.
Extensive infection meant that flesh had to be removed from his
stomach and legs to save his life.
Although he was at one stage on a life-support machine, it is now
understood the man is off the critical list and is expected to be
allowed home soon.

<HEADLINE>Status of brass band threatened as sponsor pulls out</HEADLINE>

ACCOUNTANTS were last night being blamed for pulling the plug on a
long-running sponsorship deal and threatening the future status of
Scotland's most successful brass band.
An official of the Murray International Whitburn Band -- which in
addition to starring in the UK and on the Continent has been warming up
football international crowds at Ibrox -- claimed Rangers chairman David
Murray, head of the company that had sponsored them for 12 years, had
been keen to continue but was ''over-ruled''.
Mr Archie Simpson, the band's secretary, said the financial people at
Murray International Holdings had decided, after examining the company's
existing sponsorship tie-ups, that the band was ''dispensable''.
He stressed they were ''extremely grateful'' to Mr Murray for the
invaluable support over the years and they felt no malice.
''He was quite keen to continue with it but his financial people said
no. They didn't feel they were getting enough return,'' he said.
The band is celebrating a historic year -- its 125th anniversary. Mr
Simpson said they felt the sponsorship could have been continued for
another year because of that.
''I asked David on a personal basis and he was as disappointed as I
was but the decision had been taken and obviously he could not reverse
it.
''The accountants rule the world. If there's not a plus sign at the
end of the day in the pounds, shillings, and pence column, that's it,''
he said.
Mr Simpson said there had been a six-months' notice agreement for
either side for terminating the deal and they would remain the Murray
International Whitburn band until the end of June.
Mr Simpson, who said the band would be playing at the remaining home
games in the European Football Championships after that, stated they had
asked around 40 top companies for sponsorship but without success.
He said that as most of the top English bands now had support from
building societies and insurance firms they had written to many
operating in Scotland. Around 90% had replied so far saying they were
not interested.
It costs around #30,000 a year to run the band, a third of it
sponsorship. The rest comes from concert fees and contest winnings.
''Unlike many bands, we have never charged players but that must be an
option. It has been one of our proud boasts even before the Murray
sponsorship.''
The band, with 36 players and a committee of five, draws players from
all over Scotland, who travel to Whitburn for rehearsals.
''All the top players want to play with us. If we fall from the top
position it will discourage those people.
''There is no way the band will fold but we would find it difficult to
retain our present status as one of the top bands.''
The band has won an unprecedented 13 Scottish Championship titles
since 1968.
Mr Murray could not be contacted for comment.

POLICY guidelines from the Scottish Office were issued yesterday to
help reduce the risks associated with flooding.
They recommend that planning applications for areas with a high risk
of flood damage should be vetoed.
Mr George Kynoch, Minister with responsibility for planning, believes
the guidelines provide a sensible basis for progress but says primary
responsibility for protecting land or property lies with the owners.
At one point, the document ventures something of a long-range
forecast. It says flooding such as that which affected west central
Scotland three months ago might not recur for 100 years.
Other regions hit badly since the start of the 90s have included
Ayrshire, Tayside, and the Highlands.
Last December, many parts of the country suffered severe flooding.
Worst hit areas included Kirkintilloch and Paisley. Three people died in
the flood waters.
The document says: ''The devastating effects of floods such as these
on individuals and communities are hard to quantify precisely, for while
the financial costs can be immense, people often continue to suffer the
personal effects well after the physical damage has been repaired.''
December's floods were caused by prolonged intense rainfall over two
days -- 170mm or more in some places -- when a ''conveyor belt'' of warm
and moist air associated with a slow-moving front was directly over
Scotland.
''This led to the whole catchments of the principal rivers
contributing to the run-off and, in these rivers, flows well in excess
of any previous floods were recorded.
''It is estimated that the return period of these flows is
considerably more than 100 years.''
The document maintains that Government policy is to avoid placing an
additional burden of responsibility on future generations by increasing
unnecessarily the number of areas that need artifical protection against
flooding.
''It is for planning authorities to consider the information they
receive on the nature of flood risk,'' the document states.
''In accordance with the precautionary principle, planning authorities
should seek to avoid increasing the flood risk by refusing permission
where appropriate.''

THE death yesterday of Teresa Beattie, leader of Cunninghame District
Council, has removed from Scottish local government, Ayrshire, and the
Labour Party a woman of outstanding dignity and integrity.
It is barely a month since she was at Westminster, lobbying with charm
and energy on behalf of her council. Shortly afterwards, cancer was
identified and her decline was then rapid. She was 72 but few who knew
her would have guessed it.
Long active in the Labour Party, she entered local government after
her daughters had grown up. She represented a ward in her native
Stevenston since the inception of Cunninghame District Council.
She was a senior social worker during her professional life, becoming
convener of the council during the 1980s and Labour group leader, and
thus leader of the council, following the 1992 elections.
She was pre-deceased by her husband and is survived by two daughters.

THE remaining seven children in the Ayrshire alleged satanic sex abuse
case are today expected to return home to their parents after five years
in care.
The move comes as lawyers for the Ayrshire parents attacked Mr George
Foulkes, the MP for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley who had called for
a fresh inquiry into the affair.
One of the parents said yesterday: ''We don't need another inquiry
into this. What we need is social workers in the dock facing criminal
charges for what some of them have done.''
Mr Foulkes, whose constituents include social workers and care
assistants criticised for their roles in the case, claimed at the
weekend that the courts had got it wrong over the case and also called
on Scottish Secretary Ian Lang to hold a fresh inquiry as he felt ''deep
anxiety''.
Mr Maurice Smyth, the lawyer who represented the parents of a
15-year-old girl who returned home last month, said: ''It's a great pity
the MPs' deep anxiety didn't trouble him during the long, agonising
years the Ayrshire families battled against every legal obstacle for the
return of their children.
''How can he attack the families, who are also his constituents, and
their lawyers for seeking a remedy through the courts to overturn a
major miscarriage of justice?''
Lord Hope will today hear reports from two experts, appointed by the
Court of Session, who have monitored the children's reaction to the
daily access allowed with their parents during the past fortnight.
Before that, three out of four children from one family, including a
baby of seven months when she was taken from her mother by social
workers, had not seen their parents since June 1990.
The three boys from the second family hadn't seen their parents since
early 1992.

Paris, Monday
FRANCE'S first lady Danielle Mitterrand, receiving a leading Chinese
dissident, urged Western countries today to bring pressure on Beijing to
stop using the organs of executed criminals for transplants.
Mrs Mitterrand, who heads the human rights group France-Libertes, met
visiting dissident Harry Wu, who has exposed China's harsh penal network
with a series of daring visits to labour camps.
''The trafficking in organs is something we cannot accept. Wu's
testimony is something we cannot turn our backs on without taking
action,'' the wife of President Francois Mitterrand told a news
conference held jointly with Wu.
''The Chinese penal system does not respect the norms laid down by
international conventions. What is more, China exploits the products of
the prisoners' work,'' she said.
Mitterrand's husband received Chinese President Jiang Zemin last
September for a high-profile state visit dominated by France's eagerness
for lucrative business contracts.
Wu, who spent 19 years in the Chinese gulag, criticised the welcome
given by Paris to China's head of state: ''China is potentially a very
big market but if you keep your eyes closed you easily become a prisoner
(of Beijing).''
Wu recently helped to produce a video for the BBC which alleged that
Chinese doctors used the organs of executed criminals in transplants.
He visited a hospital in the southwestern town of Chengdu and posed as
a man seeking a kidney transplant operation for his uncle. He was told
the going price was #20,000.
''Organ transplant is a business entirely controlled by the
government. China leads the world in the number of executions of
prisoners and all executions are public,'' Wu said.
Beijing has denounced the BBC programme as a fabrication, saying it
only uses organs from the bodies of criminals in extremely rare cases --
and then only with voluntary signatures from the condemned criminals or
the approval of their families.
In a report earlier this month, Amnesty International estimated that
up to 90% of transplant kidneys in China derived from executed
prisoners. Other organs included corneas and hearts.
* America's First Lady Hillary Clinton said today she would steer
clear of pressing her hosts on any specific human rights cases when she
begins a five-nation tour of South Asia on Friday.
In an interview on Cable News Network, Mrs Clinton said she would
instead speak out for women's and children's rights in general. The trip
will take her to India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal.
The trip to South Asia will be the first lengthy foreign trip by the
wife of a US president since Rosalynn Carter's two-week tour of Latin
America and the Caribbean in June 1977.--AP/Reuter.

St Louis, Monday
FESTUS, Missouri, got a real taste of Ireland two days after St
Patrick's Day when Irish Prime Minister John Bruton paid a visit and
tracked down some some lost relatives.
Mr Bruton's uncle, James Brierton, was one of the founders of Festus
in 1887. About 200 residents were present at City Hall when officials
presented Mr Bruton with a key to the city.
Later, he visited the graves of his uncle and aunts at a cemetery in
nearby DeSoto.
An old wedding notice found buried in a drawer first made Mr Bruton
aware of his ties to Festus, about 30 miles south of St Louis in
Jefferson County. That led Bruton to place an advert in the St Louis
Post-Dispatch in 1986, seeking information about the Brierton clan.
Several townspeople responded with letters, helping Mr Bruton piece
together the story of his family's Missouri ties.
Brierton also was a founder of the Farmer's Market Bank and was a
leader of the community until his death in 1893.
Mr Bruton said Brierton was able to become a wealthy man in the United
States.
''He only did it because the United States is a country that welcomes
strangers and people of different cultures to its shores,'' he said.
''He started out as a common laborer and ended his career by starting a
bank.''
During his visit, Mr Bruton was surprised to find four American
relatives he did not know he had.--Reuter.

From JULIAN BEDFORD Bujumbura, Monday
GUNFIRE and the boom of grenades blasted the Burundi capital,
Bujumbura, as night fell today, 24 hours after three Belgians and two
government soldiers were murdered in an ambush outside the city.
Hundreds of soldiers patrolled the streets shortly before curfew as
the capital of this ethnically-volatile country prepared for another
night of shooting and conflict.
The shooting started after a day of tribal clashes in the city
following the Hutu ambush whose victims included a four-year-old Belgian
girl.
As night fell, witnesses said the Hutu stronghold of Kamenge was
virtually sealed off by troops while southern suburbs where Tutsi gangs
were known to operate were being patrolled by units of Hutu and Tutsi
soldiers.
The normally bustling central market place was dead, closed by Tutsi
hardliners earlier today after four people were killed in stone-throwing
battles between youths of the Tutsi minority and Hutu majority there.
One diplomat told Reuters he expected shooting overnight, which was
becoming the norm, and added: ''But there are more troops about
tonight.''
The city was particularly tense after the ambush in which a convoy of
cars was targeted as it travelled back to Bujumbura from Njenda last
night.
Prime Minister Antoine Nduwayo said he would give no toll for
yesterday's attack to avoid scaring people.
A police officer who refused to be named said 17 people including the
Belgians were killed on a main road seven miles southeast of Bujumbura.
Six people were wounded.
Western diplomats and state-run Burundi radio put the toll at three
Belgians and two Burundians killed. A Belgian doctor who treated the
wounded said he knew of no more than five dead.
He said a total of eight Belgians in a convoy of three cars were
returning late to Bujumbura from a sporting event when they came under
fire at Nyamutenderi.
The driver of the lead vehicle, Etienne Waltzing, was shot in the hand
and lost control of his car. He stepped out to show the gunmen he was
white but was killed by a bullet in the head.
The doctor said Waltzing's girlfriend Corinne Salle was then also
killed by a bullet in the head and her four-year-old daughter Jazmin was
murdered by repeated shots into her chest.
Three other Belgians were wounded including a nine-year-old.
One diplomat said the Belgians were gunned down while standing outside
their vehicle. He commented: ''This is the first attack on foreigners.
Whether they (foreigners) or the army were the original target, the
killers knew what they were doing when they shot the Belgians.

From JONATHAN LYONS, Ankara, Monday
UP to 35,000 Turkish troops backed by tanks and jets today launched a
three-pronged attack a separatist Kurdish rebels.
A government spokesman called it the biggest military operation in the
history of the Turkish republic.
Turkish jets flew 33 sorties, pounding suspected bases of the rebel
Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) east of the Iraqi border city of Zakho.
The PKK has said the targets were completely destroyed. The spokesman
said all jets returned safely to base.
The dawn assault, unleashed on the eve of the Kurdish new year
festival, followed weeks of gradual build-up in the region.
Prime Minister Tansu Ciller told reporters after an emergency cabinet
meeting that the operation was going as planned.
She said she would brief Western leaders, including US President Bill
Clinton, by telephone.
''We want to clear out this area and rip out the roots of the (PKK)
terror operations aimed at our innocent people,'' Ciller said.
The ''utmost effort'' was being made not to harm civilians.
There was no word on casualties but Iraqi Kurdish groups condemned the
assault and said innocent civilians were being targeted.
''The targeted area has no PKK bases and it is strictly populated by
Iraqi Kurds,'' a Kurdish spokesman said.
An Iraqi opposition group, which includes leading Kurdish factions,
said Turkish soldiers had arrested hundreds of refugees as suspected PKK
followers.
Most of northern Iraq is under the control of Iraqi Kurdish guerrillas
who split from Baghdad.
Officials told a news briefing that the troops planned to push 25
miles into Iraq along a 150-mile front to attack more than 2000 rebels.
He said 30,000 to 35,000 soldiers, mostly commandos and some from
mechanised units, were taking part in the attack.
Officials said they would withdraw once PKK camps were destroyed.
Turkish forces killed civilians in a similar cross-border drive
against th the PKK in 1992.
Ankara says it killed about 1800 Kurdish rebels from Turkey in that
operation.
More than 15,000 people have been killed in Turkey since the PKK took
up arms in 1984 in its campaign for a separate state.
The drive against the Kurds took place on the eve of Nowrouz -- a
traditional time of separatist protest.
In 1992, 45 people were killed in Nowrouz clashes in southeast Turkey.
On Saturday, the PKK ambushed a 40-vehicle military convoy carrying
800 troops in eastern Turkey, killing 18 soldiers.--Reuter.

Sarajevo, Monday
THE Bosnian army launched a major offensive today, shattering the
country's ceasefire and prompting a stiff Serb response, the United
Nations said.
The fighting was the heaviest since the two sides began a four-month
truce in January.
A UN official described the developments as alarming but said the
ceasefire was not necessarily dead.
Fighting erupted early in the morning in the Majevica hills east of
the government-held city of Tuzla and around Vlasic mountain, a
Serb-held peak that looms over the town of Travnik in central Bosnia.
''This would appear to have all the hallmarks of a coordinated
offensive action by the BiH (Bosnian army)'' a UN source in Sarajevo
told Reuters.
A UN officer in Tuzla said by telephone there had been over 500
detonations near Majevica up to midday today.
Other UN officials said they had monitored more than 2000 Bosnian
troops moving into the area last night and had confirmed reports of at
least 25 casualties among government soldiers this morning.
Muslim-controlled Sarajevo radio said the Bosnian Serb army responded
with an artillery attack on the UN-protected zone around Tuzla and the
UN said at least one shell had landed in the city's Bosnian army
barracks.
''We can confirm there are now at least 50 casualties in the Tuzla
hospital but we don't know where they're from,'' said UN spokesman
Alexander Ivanko.
Today's fighting follows a gradual build-up of sniping and shelling
incidents in Sarajevo which resulted in a clash yesterday between the
Serbs and UN peacekeepers after a mortar attack on a UN aircraft.
Lack of diplomatic progress towards a peace settlement has prompted UN
fears that Muslims and Serbs are preparing for a return to war in the
spring once the ceasefire ends.
Bosnian Serb shelling of the northern Bosnian city of Tuzla killed 19
people and injured dozens more, Sarajevo radio said.
The United Nations said earlier that the Serbs had shelled the city in
response to a Bosnian government army attack on hills to the east of the
city.--Reuter.

From ROGER ATWOOD, Santiago, Monday
LOADED with tons of plutonium and banned from approaching land, a
British freighter battled today against 30ft waves and gale-force winds
as it crawled past the tip of South America on its way to Japan.
The freighter, facing ''extremely rough and stormy seas,'' entered
Chile's 200-mile territorial waters in defiance of a ban issued by the
government last week, Chile's acting foreign minister said.
Chilean television showed the ship, carrying what ecologists said was
more radioactivity than that released at Chernobyl, heaving in ocean
swells and buffeted by waves as it neared the Drake Passage between
South America and Antarctica.
There was no sign the ship was in serious distress.
But Chile's navy chief said the ship had taken ''the worst route
possible'' on its way from France to Japan.
Chilean naval authorities reported late yesterday that winds were
gusting up to 60 mph and waves were rising to 30ft in the area, feared
for centuries by sea captains for its stormy weather and wild currents.
The Chilean government, warning of the possibility of a ''radioactive
catastrophe,'' banned the ship from entering its 12-mile territorial
waters or exclusive economic zone, which stretches 200 miles from the
coast. Argentina also barred the ship from coming anywhere near its
coast.
The Chilean navy sent a patrol boat to the area to persuade the ship
to leave after it entered Chile's exclusive economic zone early today,
said acting Foreign Minister Mariano Fernandez.
British and Japanese officials defended the ship's right of passage in
contacts with Chilean officials, said Fernandez.--Reuter.

ALGIERS: An Algerian woman journalist working for state-run television
was shot dead yesterday by suspected Muslim guerrillas as she was
heading for work in Algiers, Algerian television said. Rachida Hammadi,
aged 32, was the first female journalist to be killed since Islamic
militants started targeting journalists in 1993. Her sister, Houria, 36,
who accompanied her, was seriously wounded in the attack.

TRIPOLI: Libyan television is to show a recording of the hanging of
several murderers. A programme called Security and Society, which
broadcast taped executions three years ago, said the tapes of hangings
along with the stories behind the murders, would be shown on Wednesday
night. Tripoli, criticised by the US for violation of human rights,
announced this month that it had abolished the country's last prison and
freed 305 inmates.

police said. In his suicide note, the soldier said driving laws were
''too harsh'' and he believed he was being harassed by traffic police.
The soldier blasted the office with several shots, wounding a passer-by,
before turning his gun on himself in the central town of Gweru, 170

From PATRICK BROGAN, Washington, Monday
PRESIDENT Clinton will go to Moscow on May 8 for a summit with
President Yeltsin and to mark the 50th anniversary of VE-Day.
Vice-President Gore will go to London to take part in British ceremonies
on the occasion, and then go on to Paris and Germany for events there.
The White House insisted today that skipping London was no a snub by
the president. He went there and to France last June for the D-Day
anniversary ceremonies, and this year it is Russia's turn.
In fact, the question was never a choice between London and Moscow,
but whether Mr Clinton should show his support for President Yeltsin by
visiting him, despite the Russian attack on Grozny.
Mr Yeltsin promised that there would be no military parade to remind
people of the horrors of Chechnya, however appropriate a parade might be
to commemorate the Red Army's greatest victory.
All the same, the decision to miss London came at a bad moment in
transatlantic relations. The repercussions of Gerry Adams's visit to the
United States continue to roil the waters.
A spokesman insisted that relations between the two countries remain
excellent.
* Patrick Buchanan today declared himself a candidate for the
presidency. He ran against President Bush in 1992, winning 35% of the
vote in the first primary in New Hampshire.

THE deep sense of shock that pervaded the Airdrie community --
patients, reception staff, and doctors alike -- has faded since Dr
MacKay was killed in November but the repercussions of such a violent
attack upon a doctor cannot be forgotten.
As one Airdrie doctor said: ''A doctor is giving his life to caring
for people. He or she gives a lot of time to that single aim. This
attack was at the opposite end of the spectrum in terms of good and
evil. It was one of the most abhorrent things that people could think
of.''
The immediate response among a number of Lanarkshire general practices
was to re-examine security, although there is a general acceptance that
a panic alarm or similar device would not have saved Dr MacKay.
Lanarkshire Health Board had already made 100,000 available last
November to implement a range of security schemes for health centres and
community premises. However, following Dr MacKay's death, the board
agreed to provide more money.
Strathclyde Police's community involvement branch also held a meeting
to inform GPs of sensible precautions.
''It was made clear that any precautions that we took would probably
not have made any difference in this particular case. However, I know
that the meeting with the police was very successful,'' said Dr Mary
Church, who is a GP in Blantyre and secretary of the local medical
committee.
Nowadays, young doctors and reception staff receive training in how to
handle aggressive patients.
Dr Murray Lough, a GP in Airdrie Health Centre, is involved in
training young doctors and specialises in the audit and management side
of general practice.
The attack on Dr MacKay was, he said, the third stabbing of a doctor
in the Monklands area in the past five years.
''There is no doubt that what happened to Dr MacKay made us stop in
our tracks. It was so sudden, so horrific, that it obviously was going
to have a very strong impact on everybody that had the same kind of job.
''It was not just the doctors but reception staff too -- although
doctors are in the front line, the real front line is the reception
staff, and they all felt very vulnerable,'' he said.
''We as GPs, when we discussed it informally after the event, all
agreed there was only a limit to what we could do. The nature of the job
is that you are open and vulnerable physically and emotionally, and if
someone wants you they know where to get you, and if someone bears a
grudge, they know where and how to get you.
''There is no question of barriers or grilles. The fact it does not
happen more often is testament to the fact that we have a very good and
trusting relationship with our patients.
''GPs are in a unique situation -- they see people when they are at
rock bottom emotionally and psychologically, when they are capable of
doing spontaneous things which in happier times they might not
contemplate. Doctors may also see psychiatric or borderline psychiatric
cases,'' he said.
More and more, he and the other Airdrie doctors are seeing patients
with physical ailments which are stress-related, he said. Poverty plays
a significant part in health problems, too, including the fear of
redundancy. Airdrie has one of the highest rates of deprivation in
Scotland.
Increasingly, doctors are being called upon to give their patients
advice about non-medical matters. GPs are now required to understand DSS
regulations and, more difficult, may find themselves torn between
policing the benefits system and acting as a patient's advocate when
asked to provide a ''doctor's line''.
The stresses upon the GP are consequently greater and many now feel
they cannot do a day's work properly if they also take on night calls.
Dr Lough used to do night calls but stopped after some ''particularly
unpleasant incidents'' where he was threatened.
''I believe that this is an issue for the whole community. I am
committed to the idea of a community policing itself.''
The other challenge facing the GP is to stay healthy and on top of the
job, rather than letting the job get on top of the doctor, he said.
Morale in some quarters is very low and some doctors have lost momentum.
However, he added: ''Although it is a stressful job, doctors are also
protected from many of the stresses of life. We have different kinds of
stress -- but we have a quality of life that many would envy.
''We have a job and respect in the community which many would give
their eye teeth for, and we have a job for life, so we don't know what
the threat of redundancy is.''

Iain Wilson reports on how a brother's hate led to the brutal killing
of a well-liked doctor
MURDER and vengeance festered for eight long years in the mind of
Andrew Wylie, the Buckfast-swilling Lanarkshire hardman who was also a
university graduate.
His family was unaware of the morbid, growing obsession for
retribution. Although desolate inside, he kept up appearances and faced
the world defiantly.
Wylie, 33, is an enigma -- soft spoken, often personable, of educated
mind, but with a reputation for mood swings and violence. He had wanted
to be a teacher but was rejected because of his criminal record.
On October 19 last year, he finally snapped -- killing the doctor he
blamed for a wrong diagnosis of his sister in 1986. She had complained
of stomach pains, and died later from cervical cancer.
Despite his paranoia and mood swings, Wylie knew virtually nothing
about his intended victim. He did not stalk his prey, and he did not
even know the GP by sight.
Before heading for 56-year-old Dr Donald MacKay's surgery at Bank
House Medical Centre, Airdrie, Wylie had to look up the address in a
telephone book. He also asked for directions en route. Just one wrong
look from passers-by could have turned them into victims, it was
claimed.
Once inside the centre, Wylie made sure of Dr MacKay's identity before
beginning a frenzied attack. The brutality of it shocked hardened
detectives.
Police do not know what was the catalyst that triggered the stabbing
in the East High Street consulting room. The date was neither an
anniversary nor a birthday, and had no connection whatsoever with
Wylie's beloved sister Ann, who died aged 26.
Three incidents earlier in the day, though, may have tipped his
complex and deeply flawed personality over the edge:
* He had been redecorating his mother's house -- watched by Ann's
daughter, whose resemblance to her mother is said to be uncanny, a
constant reminder of Wylie's loss.
* He had just learned of new developments in a medical compensation
claim over Ann's death. That fanned his rage against perceived
injustices. While he had been dragged to court on ''minor charges,'' the
doctor he blamed for failing to diagnose cancer early enough continued
to work unscathed.
* At 11am, Wylie was to meet a lawyer to discuss charges of breach of
the peace and police assault, and a probation order which included
psychiatric help. The solicitor never showed.
Wylie returned to his newly-occupied council flat and picked up a
kitchen knife with a 10-in blade.
Three stab wounds sliced the doctor's heart, lung, and bowel. There
were multiple wounds to his back, and others damaged his skull.
Wylie told detectives he had killed in revenge for his sister's death.
However, the first psychiatrist to interview him in custody, said he
told her he was not brooding about Ann's death and was not entirely
clear what he was going to do when he left the house. He had set out
with the knife, determined not to take any more ''s...'' from anyone.
There is no doubt that stresses had built up and manifested themselves
in bouts of depression or aggression in which he smashed up his home and
a neighbour's car. He had just lost another job, and four months'
earlier split up with his long-term girlfriend Mary Datillie, 35, of
Coatbridge, who could cope no longer with his bizarre behaviour.
Heavy drinking, and the use of amphetamines, are thought to have
reinforced feelings that he was hated and had nothing to live for.
On losing his girlfriend, he moved in with his father, then into his
own council flat in Rochsoles Drive, Airdrie.
The break with Ms Datillie, after physical and verbal abuse, coincided
with a two-year probation sentence for an assault. It was conditional on
undergoing psychiatric treatment.
That treatment never took place. However, Wylie did attend
''aggression classes'' designed to curb an anger well-known to family,
friends -- and police, often victims of his sudden, violent outbursts.
According to police, Wylie never expressed remorse for the bloody
murder, which was witnessed by colleagues and patients of the popular
doctor, a highly-respected figure who had practised in the community for
30 years.
Dr MacKay's daughter, Laura, 25, a receptionist at the medical centre,
jumped on Wylie's back as he repeatedly stabbed her father. Small, but
stocky and strong, he broke free and calmly left the premises as Laura
went over to her father and said: ''Don't die, dad.''
Not one witness could name Wylie. It was his first visit to the
surgery, and there had been no previous altercations with the GP.
Wylie had asked: ''Are you Dr MacKay? Do you remember Ann Wylie?'' The
GP, who was with a patient, answered in the affirmative, then added:
''Yes, that was a long time,'' before making a gesture as if to wave him
away.
It was a fatal move. A furious Wylie replied: ''Well, I am her f......
brother,'' and the assault began.
Wylie's subsequent actions suggest he wanted to be caught. But,
ironically, the town's closed circuit TV surveillance system, designed
to combat crime, played no part in the arrest. One camera, less than 100
yards from the surgery, was pointed in wrong directions during his
arrival and departure.
A few streets away, after dumping the knife in a garden, Wylie hailed
a taxi. The driver knew him, and later recalled his red-splattered
clothing when news broke of the killing.
Wylie was dropped in Plains, stopping for two bottles of Buckfast and
two cans of beer on the way. At a drinking session at an area called The
Burn, he graphically told numerous people what he had done.
He exulted in the description, laughing and making whooshing noises.
Then he washed his blood-stained hands and face in the burn and burned
his jacket before borrowing another and heading the two miles home on
foot.
After anonymous calls naming Wylie as the killer, police began a race
to reach him driven by the worry that an outraged public was about to
take justice into its own hands.
Wylie was 25 when his sister died. According to his family, he was as
upset as the others about the circumstances, but never fully expressed
his emotions. One recalled: ''He would not discuss things. You could not
sit down and talk with him. He would just lash out.''
He appears to have undergone a behaviour change after her death on
January 23, 1986. His criminal career had begun in 1980 at the age of
18, and he amassed 19 convictions, mainly for assault, robbery, and
breaches of the peace.
Yet he managed to stay out of trouble between 1987 and early 1994 --
perhaps because all energies were concentrated on resolving his inner
turmoil.
Drink played a key role in many offences. He often assaulted police
called to break up fights, some caused by his thinking he heard people
talk about him in disparaging terms. He was jailed twice -- three months
in 1983 for assault and robbery, and 18 months in 1984 on similar
charges.
Wylie was born in Airdrie -- the only son of George and Catherine
Wylie. He had three sisters. His parents are long separated, but remain
in the area.
Educated at St Margaret's High, he went on to Coatbridge further
education college and then into numerous jobs, including fitter, heating
engineer, and labourer, and since 1985 has had long spells of
unemployment.
In 1987, he went to Stirling University, to do a four-year honours
degree course in history. He did not complete it, dropping out of one
15-week semester, but he did gain a BA general degree in economics,
politics, and sociology.
The three-year spell on campus was probably his happiest time but the
turmoil slowly revived on his return to Airdrie in 1990.
He detested ''hanging about street corners with less educated
friends,'' yet he was no loner. A regular at the town's Wayside Tavern,
he met friends who shared his passion for Celtic.
When he was arrested after Dr MacKay's, murder he confessed to police
within 30 minutes.
Although adamant he wanted to kill Dr MacKay, he never told police
what made him finally go through with it. Remanded to Barlinnie, he was
moved to Carstairs seven days later after psychiatrists ruled he was
''very dangerous''. Since then, they have argued about his state of
mind.
Detective Inspector David Johnston, the depute senior investigating
officer, said of Wylie: ''He is an evil person. The ferocity of the
attack on a doctor was shocking. I still remember the horror I felt when
told there had been a murder and it involved a doctor in his own
surgery.''
A lawyer close to Wylie says he remains a cauldron of seething
resentment despite believing he has at last done something for his dead
sister.
Dr MacKay was born in the Highland village of Strathpeffer, and was a
keen sportsman in his youth. He studied medicine at Glasgow University,
and had worked for more than 30 years in Airdrie.
Patients described him as an understanding, caring and sympathetic
person who took time to listen, and colleagues said he was dedicated to
his job and his patients.
Many of the 600 people who crowded into Flowerhill Parish Church for
his funeral wept openly as they heard Dr MacKay's friend, the Rev Robert
Young, speak about his life in which he had ''brought light where there
was darkness, brought smiles where there were tears.''

MORE than #2 billion is spent every year keeping low-paid workers and
their families above the poverty line, according to figures released by
the Labour Party yesterday.
The level of benefits expenditure was due to the Government's
scrapping of wages councils and the failure to stop the downward
pressure on weekly pay, Labour Employment spokesman John McFall said.
In Scotland, 83,000 people were earning less than #2.50 an hour --
well below the European Union ''decency'' threshold of #5.88 an hour, he
said. In most cases, the earnings of low-paid workers were supplemented
by family credit, income support, council tax and housing benefit.
Mr McFall said refusing to implement a minimum wage was folly: ''At
the end of the day, those that are low-paid are supported by expenditure
in terms of benefit. The taxpayer is picking up the bill.'' He pledged
that in government Labour would introduce a minimum wage of at least
#3.50 an hour.
Labour also has promised that the ''scandal of low pay in Scotland''
will be one of the major planks in its campaign for next month's local
elections.
''It is no coincidence that we are highlighting this issue in the
middle of the local council elections,'' Mr McFall said. ''Tory votes at
the ballot box will mean only on thing -- the hiving off of more local
services to the private sector with thousands more Scots plunged into
the vicious trap of low pay and job insecurity.
''The Tories cold-bloodedly dug this trap when they axed the wages
councils that had provided a pay floor for 220,000 Scots.''

TYPICAL FAMILY FACES #1,000 EXTRA TAX BILL -- LABOUR
A TYPICAL family will be more than #1000 a year worse off from next
month, while the ten highest paid utility executives are #1000 a week
better off, Labour claimed yesterday.
''This is staggering evidence of the new divide in Britain between the
tiny privileged minority at the top who are making millions under the
Conservatives, and the vast majority who are worse off,'' Shadow
Chancellor Gordon Brown told a news conference.
Labour's Treasury team seized on Chancellor Kenneth Clarke's remarks
about the absence of a ''feel-good'' factor.
Mr Brown said: ''Falls in living standards show why there is no
feel-good factor, but a feel-insecure and a feel-betrayed factor.
''Mr Clarke must now explain why the vast majority of families will be
#1000 a year worse off as a result of his policies.''
Labour points to the the cut from 25% to 15% in mortgage tax relief
and the cut to 15% in the married couples' allowance for the extra tax
burden.
Shadow Chief Treasury Secretary,Andrew Smith said: ''The reality is a
feel-bad factor for British families.''
Mr Brown emphasised that homeowners faced paying hundreds of pounds in
private unemployment insurance as a result of proposals to cut mortgage
help for the unemployed.
He added: ''The Government's own figures showed mortgage insurance
would cost up to #280 a year for a typical homeowner'' and pledged
Labour would seek to defeat the Government over its proposals in the
Commons.

BRITISH hostages in Sierra Leone are alive and well as efforts to
secure their release continue, junior Foreign Office Minister Tony
Baldry told the Commons yesterday.
During Question Time, he confirmed that radio contact had been
established with all six on Friday.
It had been the first confirmation they were alive and an
''encouraging sign'' he said.
Sixteen foreign hostages are being held -- six of them British.
Contact was made by radio from Freetown on Friday. They are being held
by the Revolutionary United Front.
The six Britons include two Voluntary Service Overseas Workers, Calum
Murray, 25 and Robert D'Cruz, 30, who are road engineers. They were
taken in November.
The four other Britons are James Westwood, Ross Milne, Peter White and
Andrew Young.
Mr Baldry told the Commons: ''Last Friday, we were able to speak to
all the British hostages in Sierra Leone by radio and confirm that they
are alive and well and this is the first confirmed proof of life for all
our hostages and an encouraging sign.
''We hope we can secure their release soon,'' he said.
The hostages are being held by Revolutionary United Front rebels, who
have been fighting the Sierra Leone government for five years.
The Front, which controls no towns but carries out frequent guerrilla
raids on villages and vehicle convoys, scrapped plans to hand over the
captives last weekbecause of attacks by foreign troops fighting with the
government army.
The rebels insist Nigerian and other foreign forces must withdraw from
Sierra Leone before they consider peace talks.
Apart from the six Britons, the hostages include six Italian nuns, one
Brazilian nun, two Swiss and a German. Scores of Sierra Leoneans have
also disappeared in rebel attacks.

THE Government was defeated by eight votes in the Lords last night as
peers backed a move to protect landowners from new controls on pollution
from abandoned mines.
Voting was 108 to 100 for an amendment proposed by Tory Lord Stanley
of Alderley during the third reading debate on the Environment Bill.
The law currently allows pit owners to claim in their defence that
they had permitted rather than caused water from an abandoned mine to
enter controlled waters.
The Government proposes to end this exemption for mines that are
abandoned after the end of the century, but Lord Stanley argued
successfully that the exemption should be ended for mine owners and
operators only, leaving it in place for landowners.
The Bill sets up an Environment Agency for England and Wales to police
pollution of air, water and land and to regulate the disposal of waste.
In Scotland, a similar body, the Scottish Environmental Protection
Agency, is being established.

THE recent world conference on poverty, or ''the multi-million-pound
jamboree in Copenhagen'' as Mr Charles Hendry, Conservative MP for High
Peak, put it, attracted some attention at Overseas Development questions
in the Commons yesterday.
The Tory attitude was concisely summed up by Mr Hendry -- ''the money
would have been better spent tackling poverty, rather than talking about
it''.
Even Mr Tony Baldry, the Minister responsible for Overseas Development
in the Commons and dampish ideologically, was not afraid to agree that
the #20m outlay for bringing poverty experts together -- few of them,
one suspects, kipping in cardboard boxes -- could have been more
effectively used.
This was not good enough for Miss Joan Lestor, one of the few
unreconstructed socialists who still manage to get elected to the Shadow
Cabinet and then is given family issues, children's issues or overseas
development issues as a portfolio, perhaps showing the intense interest
the leadership attaches to these issues, or perhaps not.
She was annoyed that ''we did not send our Prime Minister''. This
sounded like a rare acknowledgement from the Opposition Front Bench that
Mr Major is good for something. However, it it soon became clear that
Miss Lestor was thinking more of the office than the man. Other
countries had sent their Prime Ministers, why didn't we send ours?
Even a Conservative Party less than over the moon about its leader's
current performance might have considered it an act of gratuitous
cruelty to despatch Mr Major to such a gathering of windbags of the
world.
When Miss Lestor, an excellent woman with her heart in the right
place, reflected that the conference had offered ''global perspectives''
of poverty, one got a glimpse of what Mr Major had escaped. It doesn't
take an international conference for us to know that there is a lot of
poverty in a lot of places in the world.
In fact, we had sent Baroness Chalker of Wallesey, our Overseas
Development Minister, and a lady robust enough not only to remain awake
throughout such a conference but to tell it a few home truths to boot.
One was, Mr Baldry passed on, that it was an increase in free trade that
was the key to global prosperity, rather than increased handouts from
the richer to the poorer.
This produced angry snorts from some Labour back benchers not yet
brainwashed by their leader. Trade has unfortunate connotations of
capitalism, while aid sounds like real compassion.
Their dissenting cries increased in volume when Mr Jacques Arnold
(Gravesham -- Con.) suggested that poorer Africans were now suffering
more from wars started by other Africans than from natural disasters
like drought. The politically correct heckles were only silenced when
the Minister called in aid a statement by a senior Oxfam official that
this was, in fact, the case.
Earlier, Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley recorded that the
ruthless cutting of benefits to our own poor, so often the subject of
Opposition attacks over the past 16 years, had resulted in a welfare
budget of #47 bn when the Tories came to power in 1979 doubling to #85bn
at the last count.
The most intriguing statistic to emerge from the statistical welter
which characterises this department's question time was that the bottom
tenth of Britons in terms of wealth, 750,000 of whom reported nil or
negative income, spent more than half as much per head as the population
as a whole.
Realising that economics or even simple mathematics is not one of its
strengths, the Sketch turned to an expert for help. How is this possible
it asked. ''Well, some of the poorest tenth have good accountants,''
said the expert. ''If you want a simple explanation for the rest in a
couple of words try 'black economy'.''
The Sketch retired, its fading respect for statistics further dimmed,
reflecting that while we have good authority for believing the poor are
always with us, they are not always who, at first sight, they appear to
be.

SCOTTISH Tory MPs yesterday stepped up the pressure on Labour leader
Tony Blair after his ''gaffe'' in a television interview over how
Scottish legislation is treated.
In a discussion about the proposals for a Scottish Parliament, Mr
Blair said at the weekend: ''All Bills that affect Scotland now, I mean
a lot of people don't actually know this, go through a Scottish Grand
Committee. There is a separate procedure altogether for it.''
This is wrong, and yesterday the Tories seized on it.
After a scathing attack by Ayr Tory MP Phil Gallie, who accused Mr
Blair of being totally confused about Scottish procedures, Aberdeen
South Tory MP Raymond Robertson sent a series of questions to Shadow
Scottish Secretary George Robertson asking him to explain what Mr Blair
was talking about.
The exact position is that under the ''taking stock'' procedures,
Bills can be given their second reading by the Scottish Grand Committee
and there is provision for evidence to be taken by a Special Standing
Committee.
The Children (Scotland) Bill, for example, is being handled in this
way, but the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill, which began its passage
in the Lords, is not and is being dealt with under normal Commons
procedure.
Any special treatment of Scottish legislation would have to be done
under prior agreement between the party Whips and business managers and
is not, as Mr Blair implied, automatic. Mr Blair's comments are
perceived as a bad mistake to be made by a party leader who has made
devolution one of his key policies for the next General Election.
In his letter to the Shadow Scottish Secretary, Mr Robertson said Mr
Blair had demonstrated his ''alarming ignorance of Scottish matters''
and that his comments had created confusion among the electorate.
The Tory MP calls on Mr George Robertson to accept that Mr Blair was
entirely wrong, and asks: ''Can you confirm that in the light of Mr
Blair's continuing lack of knowledge of Scottish affairs, and of how
Scottish business is dealt with at Westminster, you will be organising
an urgent tutorial for him on these matters?''

LABOUR last night called for a change in Scottish child law in the
wake of publicity surrounding a trainee priest who alleges he was
sexually abused by two senior priests in Aberdeen more than 20 years
ago.
Mr John McFall (Dumbarton) has tabled an amendment to the Children
(Scotland) Bill before Parliament, calling for staff in residential
establishments to report any suspicion of abuse to the police.
Mr McFall, Scottish Home Affairs spokesman, was responding to a
complaint by his constituent, Michael, who reported his allegations to
the police last year.
The MP said: ''It was the church's policy not to report priests
accused of sex offences against children to the police, but to remove
them from their post and place them in a programme of counselling.''
His amendment was designed to remove the discretion of the heads of
residential establishments such as seminaries for the training of
priests by placing an obligation on them to report any reasonable
suspicion of sexual, physical, or psychological abuse.
He said: ''The imbalance of power between a child and an adult renders
them very vulnerable and this is even more so with children in
residential establishments who are often removed from the wider
family.''
He said that those in charge would face a conflict between the
interests of the child and the reputation of the institution.
Michael was subsequently offered compensation by the Roman Catholic
Church in Scotland, which has set up a working party to look into the
whole issue of child abuse.

THE Conservative Party last night was robbed of one of its most loyal
supporters, with the death, aged 66, of the Popular Unionist MP Sir
James Kilfedder.
By anyone's standards, including his own, he was a maverick, but he
was always listened to at Question Time or in debates in the House of
Commons and had a pragmatic approach to the problems of Northern
Ireland.
The Prime Minister said last night: ''Jim Kilfedder was very much his
own man. He always stood by what he believed to be right for his North
Down constituents and right for the people for Northern Ireland.
''He served North Down bravely and independently for a quarter of a
century and also distinguished himself as the Speaker of the Northern
Ireland Assembly in the early 1980s.
''Jim will be sadly missed by his many friends in Government and in
the House of Commons, where he was a popular and respected member.''
Sir James was described in one of the books of parliamentary profiles
as an ''immensely popular, eccentric, Eire-born, Protestant
politician,'' but it quoted him as saying he was ''not a slave to
ideology.
He used Ulster's ''knuckleduster'' language while staying away from
the Protestant extremists, but was a supporter of devolution for
Northern Ireland -- the path down which the Government is going -- and
was clearly against direct rule.
Sir James came up through the hard school of Irish politics. He is a
former Chief Whip and Honorary Secretary of the Ulster Unionist Party,
but resigned from it in 1979, surviving handsomely in the subsequent
General Election despite having an Official Unionist opponent.
In a typically deprecatory but defiant statement some years ago, Sir
James said: ''I have represented my constituency since 1970. The
Official Unionist nomination was taken from me and I was re-elected as
an Independent Unionist
''As you know, I have formed my own party, the Ulster Popular Unionist
Party and, naturally enough, I became the leader. I say naturally enough
-- but it does mean no leadership problems.''
When the North Down MP received a knighthood in 1992, one newspaper
commented that he had received the honour if only for his bravery. It
said that almost alone among Northern Ireland politicians he listed his
address and number in the telephone book. ''It is 451690,'' he said.
''Remember the two rebellions -- the Forty-Five and the 1690.''
Sir James was born in 1928 in the West of Ireland in what he described
as a ''little white-washed cottage on a small farm.'' His father had
served as a young man in the Royal Irish Constabulary, but ''because he
had served in the old RIC, because of the threats he received, we were
forced to leave our home when I was a child and move into Northern
Ireland. So that's how I came into Ulster.''
His greatest ambition was to make Stormont an assembly to unite the
Ulster people and to see people living happily together in Northern
Ireland.
Many years ago he said: ''The high water mark of my political career
came in the last General Election. I was wearing a great big rosette and
a small boy came up to me and said 'Mister, are you from the circus?' I
think that was perhaps the greatest political compliment I was ever
paid.''
In more recent times, Sir James, as part of his role as a member of
the panel of senior MPs who chair the committee stages of Bills, has
been helping to look after the Children (Scotland) Bill, where he has
earned much praise.
Perhaps Mrs Maria Fyfe (Glasgow Maryhill -- Lab.) managed to get it
right when she said the committee had displayed very well how it could
work together on children's legislation, and paid tribute to Sir James.
She thanked Sir James, together with his co-chairman, Glasgow Cathcart
MP John Maxton, for their patience, which had been ''sorely tried.''
At Westminster last night, the feeling was that on many occasions over
the years Sir James' patience had been sorely tried, but that he had
come through it all with great patience and, perhaps more importantly,
great good humour.
Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, said: ''The
news of Jim Kilfedder's death is a savage blow to me as we were the two
political survivors of the Ulster Unionist group within the Conservative
Parliamentary Party.
''Jim entered Parliament for the second time in the year I was elected
and we worked closely in that team until its dissolution in 1974.''
Mr Peter Bottomley, a former Northern Ireland Minister and joint
chairman of New Dialogue, the UK-Irish peace group, said: ''He will be
missed. Many people expected him to be Speaker in a new Northern Ireland
Assembly. He was respected for being non-sectarian and willing to do
anything for his constituents, for Northern Ireland and the UK.''

REGIONAL economic development, a co-ordinated European policy, and
democratic accountability will be at the heart of Labour's strategy to
counter Tory claims that its plans for constitutional reform threaten
the Union, Shadow Environment Secretary Jack Straw said yesterday.
He told a regional government conference in London that desperation
was driving the Government to increasingly ''far-fetched'' claims about
the threat posed by devolution.
It had created an unaccountable bureaucracy in the regions, made up of
civil servants and Government-appointed quangos. ''Unaccountability,
remoteness, and poor co-ordination are its chief characteristics. It is
government of the people, for the people, by the quangocrats,'' he said.
He will publish a consultation document in June on Labour's plans for
devolution in England.

SINN Fein leader Gerry Adams last night threw the Northern Ireland
peace process into confusion by claiming to have come under no pressure
on IRA arms during his visit to the United States.
He insisted that, despite assurances given to the Prime Minister by
President Clinton, the issue was never raised.
Downing Street, apparently anxious not to worsen the rift with the
White House over Northern Ireland, said it accepted the US version of
events.
Mr Adams, arriving back at Dublin airport, dismissed reports that the
IRA was on the point of making a gesture on arms to move towards
face-to-face talks with Ministers.
Sinn Fein claims that talks at ministerial level are imminent and
hardline Unionists now fully expect contacts to start in coming days.
However, both the Prime Minister and Northern Ireland Secretary Sir
Patrick Mayhew again emphasised that Sinn Fein must first make a clear
commitment that talks would lead to ''substantial progress on the
decommissioning of arms''.
President Clinton told the Prime Minister in a 25-minute telephone
conversation on Sunday that the US administration had told Mr Adams it
wanted to see progress on the handover of IRA arms.
It was widely assumed the pressure was applied through a meeting with
US national security adviser Anthony Lake.
However, when asked by reporters if he had agreed in his meetings with
either Mr Clinton or Mr Lake to discuss decommissioning weapons, said:
''The issue wasn't raised.''
The Sinn Fein president added: ''I am not aware of any move by the IRA
on arms. We want a total decommission of arms overall, as well as
developments on other fronts, including the release of prisoners.
''There is a widespread expectation that talks will go ahead soon
between Sinn Fein and the British at ministerial level.
''I am not Superman. We have succeeded in silencing the guns. Now we
need to move forward on the political agenda.''
Downing Street seemed content to accept Mr Clinton's assurances and
made it plain the ball was firmly in Sinn Fein's court.
''Nobody is asking anybody to dance to the British tune. We are asking
people to dance to the tune of peace,'' a senior Government official
said.
In Belfast, Sir Patrick Mayhew insisted that there was now worldwide
pressure on Sinn Fein to move on the decommissioning issue.
''Before Ministers will engage in the exploratory dialogue which has
been going at official level, there has to be assurance of serious and
constructive discussion from Sinn Fein about, in particular, the issue
of decommissioning arms and intended to lead to concrete steps about
decommissioning of arms,'' he said.
The Prime Minister, in a Commons written reply, said Sinn Fein must be
prepared to take part in ''serious and substantive exploration'' of a
wide range of issues.
''Ministers need to be clear that if and when they take part,
constructive discussion, particularly in achieving substantial progress
on the decommissioning of arms, would be facilitated and accelerated by
their joining the dialogue,'' he said.
Democratic Unionist MP Peter Robinson brushed aside the Government
stand and said: ''I have absolutely no doubt that whether it is 10 to 14
days or more, that the Government, without concessions from the IRA,
will sit down and talk to their leaders.''
First of all, the Government had said all weapons had to be handed
over before there could be exploratory talks, then that was fine-tuned
to decommissioning, then substantial progress on decommissioning and
finally a gesture on decommissioning.
''Now it appears they can agree an agenda of what they're going to
talk about when they sit down with the IRA,'' he said.
''What many Unionists fear is if it goes on much longer the Government
is to give them guns in order to get them down to talks.''
He said the Government had moved completely on the issue ''like every
other issue of principle''.
Mr Robinson said people had reached the point where they were torn
between their natural inclinations to support the establishment, law and
order, and the democratic process ''and the realisation that violence
has worked in this society and that the IRA have achieved what they have
through violence''.
He predicted there would be a gesture from the Provisionals -- they
were getting rid of the bits and pieces of their arsenal which were no
longer of any use.
''The rusty guns and weeping Semtex have been taken out and placed in
an arms dump just south of Dundalk. It is very clear that the Government
and the Irish Government know about that and it is to be used as the
gesture as far as the British government is concerned,'' he claimed.
* Mr Adams is expected to visit Australia later this year on a
potentially lucrative fund-raising trip.
About a quarter of Australia's 17 million people are of Irish descent,
and there is widespread support for the republican movement.
A high-profile visit by Mr Adams would strain relations between
Britain and Australia .

SOCIAL Security Secretary Peter Lilley yesterday defended changes the
Government was making to the operation of the Child Support Agency --
after a hard-hitting Commons committee report accused Ministers of being
directly responsible for a series of blunders and bad management in the
agency.
Mr Lilley made clear in a Commons debate that lessons had been learned
from what had gone wrong with the agency in the past and that changes
being introduced would firmly establish the CSA for the future.
The cross-party committee, which examined a report by the Ombudsman,
condemned the CSA in a damning catalogue of incompetence in an
organisation set up to track down absent fathers and make them pay
maintenance.
The agency was accused of wrongly identifying missing parents, poor
procedures, failing to answer letters, giving bad or wrong advice and
subjecting families to lengthy and stressful delays.
The committee demanded that compensation be paid automatically to
wrongly identified fathers and that the CSA should make discretionary
payments for worry and distress to other people with genuine grievances.
''The work of the CSA touches on the most difficult and sensitive
areas of many people's lives,'' the report said. ''The agency should not
add to the individual's distress by sloppy procedures, carelessness,
delay, inattention or incompetence.''
It was clear the committee felt Ministers should be held responsible
-- with Social Security Minister Alistair Burt particularly in the
frame.
Tory MP James Pawsey, the committee's chairman, told the BBC:
''Throughout the CSA's history, there has been a very sad catalogue of
maladministration. It is an appalling story, frankly.''
In the Commons, however, during debate on the second reading of a Bill
which brings in changes to the operation of the agency, Mr Lilley said
that every country which had introduced a Child Support Agency had been
through a similar process to that experienced in Britain, but
improvements now were being brought in.
A number of changes already had been introduced, and the Bill
presently before the House, among a number of other measures, includes
an appeals system to allow departures from the much-criticised financial
formula, gives more recognition to ''clean-break'' settlements and
defers the application of the original, 1991 Act in certain cases.
The Social Security Secretary told the House: ''After a slow start,
the agency now is improving its performance month by month. The amount
of maintenance collected by the agency this year is likely to be five
times last year and is set to double again next year. Next year the
agency expects to collect or arrange a total of #300m.''
He believed that the policy and operational changes the Government was
introducing would firmly establish the CSA for the future.
''Nobody will be able realistically to refuse to pay maintenance. As a
result, more children will receive more maintenance more regularly,'' he
said.
For Labour, Shadow Social Security Secretary Donald Dewar said: ''We
have steadily maintained support for the principle (of the agency) but
we have also maintained there were deficiencies, many of which have
sadly been justified by events.
''We can all agree that the CSA started out with admirable aims and
sensible objectives designed to improve on a court system which was
demonstrably unsatisfactory. But it has been a depressing and bad
experience and, at times, has looked little short of a disaster area.''
He said everyone had been taken aback by the unpopularity of the
system, and there had been many causes. However, one of them was the
''failure of the Government to recognise the scale of the problem and
the depth of personal injustice.''
The Bill represented limited progress but did not go far enough. He
called for action to compensate those who had suffered from the
administrative problems identified by the Select Committee and said:
''It is quite remarkable that by the end of January, 1995, financial
redress had been made in only 34 cases.''
For the Liberal Democrats, Social Security spokesman Liz Lynne
condemned the Bill as only ''tinkering at the edges.'' She said: ''It
does not go far enough. It does not have the support of absent parents
or parents with care. It is about time you decided to repeal the Act and
start from the beginning.''
At the end of the debate, the Government defeated a Labour attack on
its planned changes of the agency by a majority of 32. Voting was 290 to
258 to reject the Opposition's amendment which opposed a second reading
for the Bill, claiming the measure was ''unacceptable'' because it did
not go far enough.

THE long link that her late husband John Smith forged with Monklands
Hospital in Lanarkshire was strengthened yesterday by Baroness Elizabeth
Smith when she opened a CT scanner suite.
The scanner, which cost #450,000, is the first of its kind in Scotland
to have a helical facility which helps speed up the diagnosis of
illnesses such as cancer.
The equipment, which has been funded by Lanarkshire Health Board, will
also help in the diagnosis and treatment of head injuries, chest
infections, blood clots, and other illnesses. It will also help patients
requiring intensive therapy.
The medical director of Monklands and Bellshill Hospitals, Dr Grace
Gray, said that, before the scanner had been installed, emergency
patients had to travel to Glasgow while routine cases had to be referred
to East Kilbride.
Mr Jim Currie, chief executive of the hospital, said: ''The late John
Smith had a long association with Monklands Hospital as our local MP and
I am delighted that Baroness Smith agreed to perform the unveiling
ceremony.''

GOLFER Jock McLean has fired himself into the record books after
bagging a hole-in-one at two consecutive holes in the same round.
Mr McLean, 58, notched up the two aces at the 145-yard par 3 fifth
hole and 230-yard par 4 sixth hole at Dunfermline Golf Club, Fife,
during a bounce game with three friends.
The Guinness Book of Records said it believed it was the first time a
British golfer had ''aced'' two holes -- one after the other -- during a
round.
Mr McLean, who has a handicap of 14, says he plans to have his lucky
ball -- a Titleist 4 -- mounted on a plaque.
Mr McLean, who is retired, was still reeling yesterday from his
amazing feat.
He admitted: ''I thought it must be some sort of record because I've
never heard of it being done before.''
He explained: ''You couldn't see the ball land on the green at the
fifth.
''And at the sixth I knew I'd hit a good shot because I saw it bounce
round the dog-leg towards the green. When I wandered up to the green the
first time I couldn't see the ball and thought I'd lost it.
''Then one of the boys jokingly said he'd ease my pain by looking in
the hole for it.
''You should've seen his face when he told me the ball was in the can
-- it was a picture.
''It was the same when we got to the next green. We could see three
balls but no sign of mine.
''But I was left speechless when one of the lads looked in the hole
for a laugh and there it was again.''
Mr McLean, from Dunfermline, stuck with tradition when he got back to
the clubhouse and gave everyone a drink from a bottle of whisky.
He joked: ''There wasn't enough for two drinks each.''

A FARMER obsessed with murdering his former wife was jailed for seven
years yesterday. He tried to hire two hitmen who turned out to be
undercover policemen, a court heard.
Geoffrey Morgan, 41, a champion cattle breeder, plotted the death of
his ex-wife, now Claire Harcourt, to avoid paying out a #137,000 divorce
settlement which might have forced him to sell the family farm.
His plan was that for #10,000 contract killers should murder the
38-year-old nurse and plant drugs on her, Swansea Crown Court was told.
However, he unsuspectingly hired two detectives, known only as Ronnie
and Joe, who secretly tape-recorded their meetings in a car park.
Morgan, of Pengallt Farm, near Llandyssul, Dyfed, admitted planning
the murder and charges of soliciting the officers in a bid to carry it
out.
Mr Justice Scott Baker said he was satisfied that Morgan had been
fully determined that the ''wicked'' plan went ahead.
''Regrettably there are those in circulation in modern society only
too willing to kill for money.''
In the same case, a self-employed welder, Lester Naylor, 52, of
Ashford, Surrey, was jailed for two-and-a-half years after admitting a
joint conspiracy to murder charge.
The court heard Naylor, a friend of Morgan, had earlier been
approached to find contract killers and had accepted money, pretending
he was in contact with a gang in Liverpool who would be prepared to
murder for money.
The court heard the Morgans married in 1975 but divorced in 1991.
Although Pengallt Farm and its livestock were worth about #1m, Morgan
had business and personal bank overdrafts of more than #200,000.
''He had an obsession that the only way to resolve his difficulties
was to murder his ex-wife,'' the prosecutor said.
He involved Naylor, 52, who had bought land from him, believing he
might have access to underworld figures. He eventually paid him #4300.
Naylor told him he could use a gang from Liverpool but spent most of the
money.
On January 14 last year, the night the ''gang'' were supposed to have
struck, Morgan took his two children and girlfriend to a restaurant, but
Naylor later told Morgan the gang had been arrested for drug dealing.
Morgan then unwittingly alerted police to his plans when he made his
own bungled attempt to recruit hitmen. He gave two officers details of
his ex-wife's daily car journey to her work at a hospital in Carmarthen.
The court heard the officers were concerned not to encourage Morgan
and gave him at least five opportunities to pull out of the plan. But
the farmer told them: ''I am not changing my mind. I am living for this
-- I'm living for it.''
At one stage when he was asked how he wanted his ex-wife murdered, the
farmer replied: ''She could drown, or a bloody bullet. I don't want to
fork out.''
After turning down a last chance to withdraw, he was arrested while
driving his tractor.

A YOUNG doctor yesterday recalled the day an ''exhilarating'' winter
climb in the Torridon mountains of Wester Ross turned to horror as he
and his companions were engulfed by an avalanche.
He told a fatal accident inquiry of how he lay for almost five hours
with a broken back waiting to be rescued.
Dr Robin Dawson, 27, of Wellington Street, Dumfries, was the first
witness at the inquiry at Dingwall Sheriff Court into the death of
28-year-old Dr Katharine Herd, of Slains Crescent, Cruden Bay,
Aberdeenshire.
Dr Herd, who had serious head injuries, died the day after the
avalanche in the Southern General Hospital in Glasgow.
Dr Dawson, now fully recovered and back climbing again, had met Dr
Herd only the day before the accident.
She and another young climber, 17-year-old Marcus Cross were roped
together with him as they underwent climbing instruction on 3458ft
Liathach.
Dr Dawson said they were high up in Trotter's Gully, and past the most
difficult part of the climb, when ''out of the blue'' he was aware of
the snow moving beneath him.
''The first I noticed it seemed to be spindrift but it seemed to get
more and then it came to the stage it knocked me off my feet. I remember
feeling smothered.''
Dr Dawson said he was on his back and was trying to roll over on his
stomach so he could use his ice axe.
''I had a sensation of snow all around me. I had difficulty in
breathing and then I lost consciousness.''
When Dr Dawson came to, he was back at the bottom of the 1000ft gully
and had severe pain in his back. He was aware of Marcus Cross attending
to Dr Herd but the only sound he heard was her groaning.
Mr Cross had then helped him and set off down the mountain for help.
Dr Dawson said he had seen their instructor, Mr Kevin O'Neill, higher
up the gully. He was staggering about and seemed to be heading down the
mountain a different way.
Dr Dawson said the accident happened around mid-day but it was between
4.30 and 5pm before a rescue helicopter arrived.
When the procurator-fiscal, Mr Ray Craig, who has been brought in to
take the inquiry because of his climbing experience, showed Dr Dawson a
shattered helmet, Dr Herd's mother, sitting in the public benches with
her husband, broke down in tears.
Dr Dawson said he had been wearing a similar helmet.
He said that, just before they started the climb proper, Mr O'Neill
had carried out a test for avalanche danger by cutting a slab of snow
away and trying to make it move.
The instructor had told them he estimated the danger to be Grade 2 --
that was low to medium -- but he felt it was safe for them to carry on.
Questioned by Mr Craig, Dr Dawson revealed that Dr Herd was not
supposed to be on his course. He had been the only one ''signed up'' for
the introductory course on snow and she and Mr Cross had agreed to join
him.
The inquiry heard that Dr Herd was supposed to be on a winter walking
course on a different mountain. The course she ended up on was more
difficult.
Marcus Cross, who was 17 at the time of the avalanche in January 1994,
had been living at Strathcarron.
He said he had been leading at the time of the avalanche and had
suddenly felt his feet moving under him.
He stepped to the side and dug in his ice axe. He said: ''I think I
stepped off the edge and I managed to stop myself, but then I was tugged
from the back and pulled down.''
Mr Cross, now of John Street, Aberdeen, said Mr O'Neill had told them
there was a slight risk of avalanche but he was happy to be guided by
him.
After the fall, he had seen Mr O'Neill high above them. He said: ''I
called out to Kevin. He was standing and kneeling down. Then he was just
sitting there. He was just staring into nowhere.''
Mr Cross said that when he got to Dr Herd he saw a hole in her helmet
and blood coming out. There was blood bubbling from her mouth.
At the start of his evidence, Mr O'Neill, 40, from Cumbria, told the
inquiry that, unlike Alpine resorts, no legal qualifications were needed
in Scotland for instructors and mountain guides. He himself was a
qualified mountain guide.
The inquiry continues.

EXCLUSIVE By JAMES ROBERTSON
A RUGBY side's coach, who took to the field in his old position as a
hooker for a friendly match, ended up in a hospital operating theatre
after allegedly being punched on the jaw by an opponent.
Mr Ian Jeffery, who donned his Leith Accies' shirt in an emergency
situation to face a Murrayfield side in a floodlit clash in the shadow
of the national stadium, had two metal plates inserted in his jaw in an
operation at Edinburgh's City Hospital.
A member of the Murrayfield side was ordered off the pitch after the
alleged incident, last Thursday evening, and the match referee is to
file a report with the Scottish Rugby Union disciplinary committee.
The Accies' secretary, Mr David Ritchie, said yesterday that his club
expected to receive a copy of the referee's report and might be in a
position to ''supplement it''. Asked whether the matter was being
reported to the police, he said: ''There has been no decision taken on
that yet by Ian. The club view is that we shall, in the meantime, leave
it up to him to decide.
''No complaint has been made to the police as far as I am aware.''
Both sides fielded mixes of their firsts and seconds regulars for the
friendly, which was originally to have been played last Saturday
morning, before the England-Scotland match, but was brought forward.
Mr Jeffery, who began his rugby career with Accies, then played for
Selkirk for 10 years before returning to his old club as coach, was
rushed to Edinburgh's Royal Infirmary, then transferred to the City for
his operation, which was carried out last Friday.
''The operation was successful and he was discharged on the
Saturday,'' Mr Ritchie said.
''He was punched, I could not tell you the name of the player. He was
ordered off.''
Mr Fred Ainslie, the Murrayfield president, missed the incident, which
took place during the second half. ''From what I have been told, the
referee did not see it. It was the linesman and someone else who drew
his attention to it.
''I'll be getting together with my vice-presidents and then get in
touch with Leith Accies.''
One Murrayfield vice-president, Mr Alan Douglas, said last night: ''I
was actually playing in the game myself. Everyone was running in the
opposite direction when whatever is supposed to have happened happened.
''I was basically running alongside the referee, chasing the ball.''
The friendly ended in a 20-12 win for the Leith side.

THOUSANDS of tonnes of the deadly sarin gas are dumped in corroding
drums off the Scottish coast.
Experts and environmentalists last night warned that it is only a
matter of time before some of the nerve agent, buried in Scottish waters
after the Second World War, could be washed ashore or trawled up by
unsuspecting fishermen.
They also warn that the Japanese attack might encourage people to
recover some of the nerve agent from its underwater repository for
political extortion or terrorist activities.
The Nazis produced at least 300,000 tonnes of the substance during the
war but never used it in battle. After the Third Reich fell, most of it
was buried, burned or dumped in rivers, lakes, and the Baltic Sea.
Until the early 1980s, the US army had about four million litres of
the gas in store in West Germany. It has also been produced in the
Middle East.
Inhalation of just 0.5 milligrams of sarin can kill almost instantly.
The gas reduces the level of a key enzyme needed by the nervous system,
causing difficulty in breathing, a decline in blood pressure, and
contraction of the pupils. Survivors could still suffer nerve, brain,
and liver damage.
German scientists said sarin, 20 times as deadly as potassium cyanide,
ranks as probably the world's second most lethal chemical after a
related gas called soman.
More than 120,000 tonnes of chemical weapons captured from Nazi
Germany were dumped by the British Government at sites in the North
Channel, North Atlantic, the Skagerrak and the deep channel approaches
to the Western Isles between 1945 and 1956.
The deep water repositories contain drums of sarin, also known as GB,
cyanide, the deadly blistering agent phosgene, and large quantities of
mustard gas.
Official documents reveal that many of the dumps used to dispose of
sarin between 1945 and 1947 are considerably shallower than the 1000
fathoms judged to be safe by 1956.
The Government remains adamant that the sites pose no threat to fish
stocks or human life, despite fears raised by Irish politicians in 1986
of a link with an unusual number of birth defects.
Hundreds of dead birds and sea mammals have also been found, some of
which displayed burns similar to those caused by nerve gases.
Two months ago, Greenpeace condemned plans by Highlands and Islands
Enterprise to undertake exploratory fishing trials in deep waters off
the Western Isles close to one of the dump sites.
Dr Rune Eriksen, a Swedish expert who sits on the Helsinki Committee
for Chemical Weapons, said there had been more than 400 cases of
Scandinavian fishermen trawling up pieces of solid mustard gas and other
chemicals in the Baltic, where weapons were dumped by the Russians.
Many fishermen have been hospitalised and there have also been
fatalities.
Dr Paul Johnston of Exeter University said it would only be a matter
of time before Scottish fishermen suffer that same fate.
''These weapons are still active and potentially lethal,'' he said,
''The drums are corroding and some may have punctured.''
He said chemical changes which may have occured make sarin ''even more
corrosive and dangerous.
''It would be a triumph of hope over experience if there was not an
accident before too long.''
However, he said of greater concern was that yesterday's attack could
give people the impetus to search for the drums of gas.
''It would be a highly dangerous enterprise but the gas could be used
on the black market or for terrorist activities,'' he warned.
Western Isles MP, Mr Calum MacDonald, said the Government must remain
fully aware of the potential danger of the dump sites to fishermen and
the general public.
He said he was also extremely concerned that members of the public
might be tempted to search for the dumps. ''After what happened in
Japan, there is quite an alarming prospect for the future lying off our
coast,'' he added.
A Greenpeace spokesman said: ''This tragedy in Japan proves how
dangerous the gases are. We repeat our call made in January for the
Government to conduct an urgent investigation into what exactly has been
dumped and then to do something about cleaning it up or making it
safe.''

A POPULAR and caring doctor, who was stabbed to death in his
Lanarkshire surgery by a man obsessed, could be alive today but for
bureaucratic muddles.
Calls for an inquiry into the circumstances leading up to the murder
of Dr Donald MacKay are being led by the Scottish Association for Mental
Health, which fears that ''some kind of administrative mix-up'' may have
contributed to the tragedy.
The concern centres on the unreliable communications involving court,
health, and social work authorities to ensure that psychiatric treatment
required by a judge is provided.
Andrew Wylie, 33, of Rochsoles Drive, Airdrie, was jailed for life at
the High Court in Glasgow yesterday, after being found guilty of
murdering Dr MacKay in his surgery at the Bank House Medical Centre in
East High Street, Airdrie, last October.
Wylie killed 56-year-old Dr MacKay with a kitchen knife in revenge for
the death of his sister Anne eight years ago, blaming the doctor for
failing to diagnose her cancer.
After listening to evidence during a four-day trial, the jury of 10
men and five women took just 75 minutes to decide that he was not insane
when he carried out the attack on October 19, and was therefore
responsible for his actions and guilty of murder.
Wylie's defence had been that he was a paranoid psychotic suffering
from an alcohol-induced illness called alcoholic hallucinosis.
After the verdict was delivered, Mr Iain Bonomy, QC, prosecuting,
revealed that Wylie had a string of previous convictions for assault and
carrying knives, and received an 18-month sentence for assault and
robbery.
Sentencing Wylie, Lord Murray said there was only one sentence he
could impose and that was life imprisonment.
Dr MacKay's daughter Laura, 25, a receptionist in her father's
practice who grappled with Wylie during the attack, and son said they
were too distraught to comment immediately after sentence was passed.
However, Wylie's sister, Mrs Ellen Rooney, 34, of Rowanlea, Airdrie,
said: ''Nothing will ever persuade the family that, at the time Andrew
did this terrible thing, he could possibly have been sane. He was
needing help.''
Four months before the murder, Wylie was scheduled to begin
psychiatric treatment as a specific condition of a two-year probation
order for an unrelated assault, but the treatment never took place.
When he killed Dr MacKay, his record of violence was ever-escalating.
It is even suspected his state of mind was such that, on route to the
surgery, he would have slain any passerby who may have given him a wrong
look.
In court, Dr Isobel Campbell, the psychiatrist who interviewed him
immediately after the killing, diagnosed Wylie as a paranoid psychotic.
Another expert, Dr John Baird, offered conflicting evidence that he was
not mentally ill, but a man with a short fuse.
Concern that Wylie could have fallen through a safety net is based on
an appearance at Airdrie Sheriff Court in June last year. He was
sentenced to two years' probation -- with the specific condition that he
attend hospital, as and when directed, for psychiatric treatment.
However, it would appear that such a sentence should have been
deferred at least until the court had received guarantees that treatment
was available.
No-one pointed out such doubts in the court, and the confusion which
followed meant Wylie, who should have become an out patient at Hartwood
Hospital in Shotts, never received an appointment to meet a
psychiatrist.
The 1975 Criminal Procedures (Scotland) Act declares that a court
shall not make a probation order containing a requirement for
psychiatric treatment unless satisfied that arrangements have been made
for the offender to receive it.
The Act also suggests that responsibility to notify psychiatrists
dealing with the cases rests with the court, where a condition of
probation involves residential treatment.
However, it is in effect ''silent'' over where the responsibility lies
for notifying psychiatrists to arrange appointments if the offender is
to remain an out patient.
It would appear no appointment was made in Wylie's case because a
psychiatrist employed by Lanarkshire Health Board was awaiting an order
from the court, rather than accept its receipt via the probation
officer.
Strathclyde Regional Council's social work department insisted
yesterday that it wrote to the psychiatrist involved in the original
court proceedings -- and enclosed the condition that psychiatric
treatment was required.
A spokesman added that the social worker assigned for the probationary
period had followed the matter up. Nevertheless, it was conceded that no
appointment was set for Wylie between June and October.
Ms Hilary Patrick, legal adviser to the Scottish Association for
Mental Health, said: ''We are concerned that there seems to have been
some kind of administrative mix-up. We are also concerned that it would
appear that someone who was ill in June did not get the help he
needed.''
The association called for an inquiry by the Mental Welfare Commission
for Scotland into all the circumstances.
A spokesman for Lanarkshire Health Board yesterday declined to comment
specifically on why Wylie received no psychiatric treatment but issued a
statement on behalf of the board's general manager, Professor Frank
Clark.
It stated: ''This case clearly raises issues surrounding the method of
communication between the health board, the regional council, and the
courts, which we will require to give consideration to.''
Labour's social work spokesman, Mrs Maria Fyfe, MP for Maryhill,
Glasgow, said she will ask questions of the authorities because ''the
system failed''.

THE Government is setting up a special unit to combat fraud among
diplomats after a financial scandal which led to two British ambassadors
in succession being forced into early retirement, a committee of MPs was
told last night.
Ambassadors Mark Marshall and Douglas Gordon stepped down from their
posts at the British Embassy at Sana'a in the Yemen because of their
management record after a #41,000 fraud by a senior diplomat was
uncovered. The man involved, Gerald Ryan, 48, later killed himself.
The saga was unfolded by the head of the Diplomatic Service, Sir John
Coles, before astonished members of the Public Accounts Committee.
Sir John made it clear that the ambassadors were made to take early
retirement because of weak management at the embassy and not for any
impropriety.
The case centred on Mr Ryan, a former second secretary at the embassy,
whose illegal profits included a #32,250 ''kickback'' for negotiating
the lease of the embassy building.
A National Audit Office report cited the departure of Mr Marshall, and
Sir John told the MPs: ''There is no doubt at all in my mind that the
ambassador's management record was defective.''
Sir John said to cross-questioning: ''We were not satisfied with the
management record at the post even after Mr Marshall had gone.''
Mr Ryan's illegal activities -- spelled out in the report -- included
alleged theft, deception and corruption involving property and currency
exchange dealings. He also handed out 10 free visas.
Under further questioning, Sir John said Mr Marshall had received a
pension enhancement and had retired on a full ''half pay'' pension, made
up as if he had retired at 60. He retired four years early.
Sir John also disclosed that Mr Ryan had worked for six months in
Whitehall in a joint assistance unit providing help with the ''know-how
fund'' for eastern Europe before he was arrested.
Labour MP Alan Milburn protested: ''Despite the fact that he was under
suspicion . . . the Foreign Office decided to take him in to a Whitehall
department. That seems an extraordinary decision.''
Pressed on what action he would now take, Sir John told the MPs: ''As
a result of this affair, I have decided to set up a new unit in the
Foreign Office.
''I want it to be able to go straight to the post and stay there until
it can tell me there is fraud and they have eliminated it, or there is
no fraud.''
Mr Ryan -- described by Sir John as a ''rather disturbed man'' who had
started at the embassy in January 1989 -- came under suspicion in March
1993 during routine security vetting.
The report says he admitted to police that he had been involved in the
irregularities.
Glasgow Labour MP Mike Watson said there had been ''anarchy'' at the
embassy and committee chairman Robert Sheldon (Lab Ashton-under-Lyne)
said: ''This is a very serious case indeed.
''The number of irregularities are of a kind that we very rarely see,
and that makes it very disturbing to this committee.''

By our Foreign Staff
JAPAN mobilised 10,000 police last night, and assigned 300 special
investigators to hunt down the group which launched the nerve gas attack
on Tokyo subway stations and trains.
Seven people were killed and almost 4700 injured. No-one has claimed
responsibility. Officials called it a deliberate, indiscriminate attempt
at mass murder, and experts said only ''crazies'' would use the gas
sarin.
Many of the injured were released after treatment but 603 remained in
hospital, 76 in critical condition, and 46 serious.
All over central Tokyo, rush-hour passengers on crowded trains and
platforms fainted, vomited or went into convulsions as the fumes spread.
Sixteen stations and five trains were contaminated. Police said at
least five unidentified suspects left various containers filled with
sarin on trains.
Some passengers reported seeing a man in a surgical mask. Others said
they saw a man in sunglasses leaving lunchbox-sized packets in trains or
on platforms.
The containers discovered range from glass and plastic bottles to what
looked like two aluminium lunch boxes.
The highly toxic nerve gas was used by Iraq in its war against Iran in
the 1980s.
Anti-terrorist experts in Germany, where chemists invented it, said
the lethal gas is so unpredictable that only demented terrorists would
use it. A single drop of liquid sarin on the skin can kill.
''This is something for crazies,'' said one expert at the Federal
Criminal Office. ''Only terrorists with a kamikaze mentality would use
it.''
A chemist for IG Farben, the conglomerate that provided gas for the
death chambers at Auschwitz, discovered sarin by chance in 1936 while
experimenting with insecticides.
The planners of the attack must have had advanced knowledge of
chemistry. While it is fairly easy to obtain the ingredients needed to
produce sarin from organic phosphorous, the chemical process is fairly
difficult to perform.
Experts said it would be possible to carry the substance in a
container and plant it in such a way that it would leak out.
However, normal criminals and political radicals would probably not
use sarin because the risk that they themselves would die either while
producing or using it was too high, one expert said.
Authorities refused to discuss suspects, and would not say whether
they included Aum Shinri Kyo, a religious cult that has been accused of
making sarin. The group denied any involvement and threatened in a
statement to sue anyone who suggested there was a link.
Investigators were looking at several unsolved cases of chemical
poisoning for clues. Last June, a cloud of sarin was blamed for seven
deaths at homes in the town of Matsumoto. The source was never
identified and no-one was arrested.
''I can't deplore this act strongly enough,'' said Prime Minister
Tomiichi Murayama after an emergency cabinet meeting yesterday.
''Why did they have to do this?'' said Bunjiro Iwata, whose
32-year-old daughter Takako died. ''Why did they have to kill my
innocent daughter?''
In Japan, terrorism was mainly connected with the Japan Red Army
(JRA), a group of former student radicals which carried out a
spectacular series of deadly attacks and airline hijackings in the
1970s.
In May 1972, three JRA terrorists armed with machine guns and grenades
killed 26 tourists at Tel Aviv's Lod Airport and wounded a further 76.
The JRA is thought now to have dwindled to a small band of guerrillas
exiled in Lebanon.
Police say Japan has around 20,000 ultra-leftists and 980 ultra-right
wing groups with about 120,000 members.
''The mastermind in this case must have confidence in his handling of
this material, because sarin is extremely dangerous in the last phases
of production,'' Shunji Ishikura, chemistry professor at Tokyo Science
University, said.
Last December, the Public Security Investigation Agency, the nation's
security watchdog, warned of a possible rise in terrorism by both left
and right radicals this year, the 50th anniversary of the end of the
Second World War.
It warned that right-wing groups, which see criticism of Japan's
wartime activities as a slur on the nation's heritage, were likely to
attack peace ceremonies marking the anniversary.
Last May, a right-winger tried to shoot former Prime Minister Morihiro
Hosokawa, the first Japanese premier who admitted in parliament that
Japan fought a war of aggression. Left-wing groups were also expected to
intensify anti-war propaganda to mark the anniversary.
* Author Gordon Thomas foretold the attack in a thriller he wrote four
years ago. In Deadly Perfume, he described how terrorists obtained sarin
and tested it in a small town before planning to release it in the
subway system of a major city. ''I said at the time this is a crime
waiting to happen,'' the Dublin-based author said. The book was a
best-seller in Japan.

CHANCELLOR Kenneth Clarke fired a broadside at the Tory Euro-rebels
yesterday accusing them of damaging the pound by encouraging market
uncertainty.
A furious Chancellor, still smarting from the publicity surrounding
his political gaffs last week on industrial closures, rounded on the
Euro-sceptics.
He said that ordinary Tories and the people generally were ''sick and
tired'' of fringe rebels persistently trying to open up debate on the
minutiae of Conservative policy on Europe.
He also appeared to breach the Prime Minister's instruction to Cabinet
colleagues not to indulge in public debate about a European single
currency when he said economic and monetary union (Emu) would remove
trade distortions.
Mr Clarke's defiant remarks came after a day of talks with EU Finance
Ministers, at which the Chancellor's French counterpart, Mr Edouard
Alphandery, backed the idea of speeding up progress towards a single
currency.
Mr Alphandery said: ''In my opinion, the quicker we get to a single
currency the better. This would avoid the currency fluctuations and we
must move to the third stage (of Emu) as fast as possible. This now
seems to be more likely.''
Later, he added that he thought Emu could be a fact for some EU states
in 1997, the first feasible date under Maastricht's timetable. Britain
has dismissed this possibility.
Asked if he agreed with Mr Alphandery's call for a faster route to
Emu, the pro-European Mr Clarke said the process would take years, but
added: ''It is certainly the case that, with economic and monetary
union, the problems of trade being distorted would not be the ones they
are now.''
For the first time, Mr Clarke blamed the problems of the pound on
political issues. He suggested that there was ''disproportionate
attention'' paid to the Liberal-inspired calls for a referendum on a
single currency and the recent resignation of a Junior Minister over
what Mr Clarke called a ''private scandal''.
However, his strongest criticism was directed at the Euro-rebels. He
said: ''Members on the fringe of the party, who try persistently to open
a fresh ideological debate on what might or not happen in the future on
some aspect of European policy, do great harm to the Conservative
Party.''
Of the pound's difficulties, he said: ''I am sure some of it is
undoubtedly political. The markets keep having a look at the political
controversy in Britain. He said that a ''few colleagues'' who sought to
raise the temperature of the European debate to new heights ''do not do
a great deal for market confidence''.
Last night, a meeting by Tory right-wingers to discuss a strategy for
unity for the coming local elections was poorly attended with only 30 of
the 100 members of the 92 Group present and the best idea they came up
with was tax cuts in the autumn Budget.
Tonight, further Tory division appears to be waning on a Commons
motion claiming the Government is not acting sufficiently to reform the
monstrously-expensive Common Agriculture Policy of the European Union.
The 92 Group of right of centre Tories didn't even mention tonight's
vote at last night's meeting and the Tory rebels off the Whip are not
intending to side with Labour to embarrass the Government. However, they
will have their weekly meeting this afternoon.
Tory unity was emerging as a desperate survival factor before the
Scottish local elections on April 6, which are to be followed by the
English local elections in May.

SIR James Kilfedder, former Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly,
died last night on his way to the Commons from Gatwick airport. A
staunch Government supporter, his sudden death of a suspected heart
attack at the age of 66 further reduces Mr Major's majority.
He was the leader and only member of his Ulster Popular Unionist
party, the UPUP.
Sir James, had been MP for Down North since 1970 and was MP for West
Belfast from 1964-66.
The Prime Minister last night paid tribute to him. ''Jim Kilfedder was
very much his own man. He always stood by what he believed to be right
for his North Down constituents and right for the people of Northern
Ireland.''
