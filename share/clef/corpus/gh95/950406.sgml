HOT pants, mini shorts, call them what you like, but when Helena
Christiansen wears them she stops the traffic.
It takes a certain courage, and the right physique, to get away with
wearing shorts that are actually smaller than your knickers.
But if you've got the legs and the brave pills, then hotpants do make
a stunning alternative to a skirt for evenings.
Dress them up with high heels and sheer tights, add a shiny belt in
one of this season's pastel shades and allow a couple of inches of
midriff to remain exposed and you'll not go unnoticed.
Hot pants work well with shirts worn open over uplift bras and they
can also be teamed with a twin set for real sweater girl looks.
If you're planning your holidays then consider packing a pair of
these. You can wear them all day on the beach, dust off the sand and
immediately be dressed to tackle the local nightlife.

Brisbane, Thursday
THOUSANDS of Australians flocked to a small outback town today to
celebrate the centenary of the nation's unofficial anthem Waltzing
Matilda.
It was first publicly performed at a hotel in the central Queensland
town of Winton 100 years ago.
To many Australians, it is better known even than the official anthem,
Advance Australia Fair, adopted in 1974.
Written by bush poet Banjo Paterson, it tells the story of a
''swagman'', or vagrant, walking the outback looking for work.
He is caught stealing a sheep that wanders into his camp site beside a
water hole, or billabong, on a private property north of Winton.
Confronted by police and the property's owner, the swagman jumps into
the water and drowns himself rather than be arrested.
The song was adapted from an old Scottish marching tune. Paterson,
Australia's most popular poet, died in 1941.--AP/Reuter.

CITY Site Estates has sold the Longhaugh Neighbourhood Shopping Centre
in Dundee for #2.4m. The buyer is the rapidly-expanding Kwik Save food
discounter which is already a tenant on an 8.4% yield basis.
Kwik Save bought the ailing Shoprite chain last year and has more than
110 outlets in Scotland.
The sale is part of Glasgow-based City Site's strategy of re-focusing
its portfolio. It is possible that there will be more deals announced
during the next few months.
Last week, the company said that it was paying off part of the arrears
on its Preference dividends. It will bring fully up to date the payout
on the small first Preference issue at a cost of around #36,000 and half
that on the second Preference.
That amounts to #1.67m, covering the period from April 1992 to
September 1993 and it is probable the remainder will be distributed at
the end of September.
Suspension of payments arose because the company had no distributable
reserves as a result of a write-down of its property assets in 1992.
Preference arrears totalled 13p per share.
However, during the last year the company has seen a major
transformation in its fortunes. Gross assets total #120m and the firm is
hungry for deals.

YOUR Essential Guide to the Transport Debate (March 30) seems to
neglect the essential environmental aspect of that debate.
As the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution said in October:
''There is now general recognition that a continuing upward trend in
road traffic would not be environmentally or socially acceptable.
Avoiding serious . . . damage . . . requires a fundamentally different
approach to transport policy and a radical modification of recent
trends.''
While the text accompanying your map says ''opinion favours'' building
the M74 and M77, the RCEP includes a call for #70m to be spend on
raising bridges, etc, on the railway between Mossend and the Channel
Tunnel. This would enable 9% of current UK-Europe HGV trailers to be
carried on rail wagons, and the work need not wait for the West Coast
main line to be upgraded,
As for new motorways, the RCEP comments: ''Those environmental effects
which vary with the volume of traffic will have been underestimated and
those calculations which depend on the speed of traffic will have been
biased.''

MASTER Oats sailed through his final warm-up for Saturday's Martell
Grand National yesterday, virtually banishing any fears that he could
miss the race because of fast ground.
The Gold Cup hero and big race favourite demonstrated that he is in
such good heart that trainer Kim Bailey is committed to running at
Aintree even if the ground dries out further.
Master Oats schooled over three fences in Lambourn, including one
modelled on a Grand National fence, put the finishing touches to his
challenge to emulate Golden Miller's Gold Cup-Aintree double of 1934.
Bailey reported: ''Master Oats is better now than he was before
winning the Cheltenham Gold Cup. He jumped three schooling fences, one
of them a replica of a Grand National fence, and is fit as a fiddle.
''Recent blood tests on the horse have come back 100% okay. I can't
say anything definite about the ground at Aintree until I walk the
course.
''If it is good to firm with good patches he will still run. The thing
that would stop him is if there was jar in it. I've had two reports from
Liverpool, one of them saying that it is good to soft up there and the
other saying it is good. If that is the case, he would be a definite
runner.''
The going on the National course remained 'good' today but, with
little rain forecast, the ground is expected to get faster by Saturday.
Assistant clerk of the course Ian Renton said: ''The going is liable
to change at some stage. We just have to wait on the weather, though it
is very encouraging how little movement there has been in the ground
today.
''On the Grand National course there is really lovely ground from the
start to the Canal Turn. It is a little bit quicker from Valentine's up
to Anchor Bridge.''
Adrian Maguire suffered a pre-Aintree scare when he was taken to
hospital in Swindon for precautionary X-rays to a knee, injured in a
first race fall at Ludlow.
The jockey, due to partner Ebony Jane on Saturday and absent because
of flu yesterday, is expected to resume riding today. His agent Dave
Roberts said: ''I've spoken to Adrian and he is okay.''
Philip Hide, struck down by a mystery bug, will talk to Josh Gifford
about his chances of making the ride on Topsham Bay.
A stable spokeswoman said: ''Philip is not even certain what the
problem is, but he has felt very uncomfortable since the weekend when he
came out in a red, itchy rash.
''He has had his antibiotics changed. He has not ridden out for a
couple of days and it will depend how he is today on whether he is okay
to ride out and has a chance of competing in the Grand National.''

<TEXT>
ROYAL doctor's widow Gida Ratner walked free from court yesterday
after the prosecution in a #2000 Social Security fraud case offered no
evidence.
The 25-year-old former model had been charged with defrauding the DSS
of #2000 in income support.
After she was released from Horseferry Road Magistrates' Court in
London yesterday, she was served with a statutory demand for #47,000 in
back rent.
Mrs Ratner, whose husband Victor, 61, died in August 1993 of a drugs
overdose, said she was pleased with the outcome of the court case and
added: ''It was a success.''
The fraud allegations arose after she had allegedly told the DSS that
no-one was renting rooms in her former Harley Street home, had not
reported receiving rent, and had not declared that she was administrator
of her late husband's estate.
The four charges were dropped after magistrate Mrs Ros Keating queried
whether she may have been collecting the rent on behalf of her late
husband's estate and so did not have to report it to the DSS.
Mr Victor Ratner was a cousin of former High Street jeweller Gerald.
Mrs Ratner, originally from Sierra Leone, has a four-year-old son
Joshua to whom she gave birth hours after marrying her husband in 1990.
She was acquitted last December of defrauding one of his patients of
nearly #17,000.
She was cleared at Knightsbridge Crown Court of all charges relating
to cheques and a credit card, allegedly stolen from Miss Eleanor Berry,
daughter of Lord Hartwell, the former proprietor of the Daily Telegraph.
Mrs Ratner told reporters outside the court that she now hoped to
relaunch her modelling career.
The demand for back rent was served on her by a private detective
acting on behalf of Howard Dewalden Estates. If she fails to pay the
outstanding sum within 21 days, bankruptcy proceedings may then be
initiated.

THE Scottish influence in Bobby Wellins's tenor saxophone playing has
been described in lots of ways he says, ''from the skirl of the bagpipes
to strangling chickens''.
The former is, perhaps, fanciful, while the latter is patently untrue,
but whatever folk music influence is in there has never been deliberate.
Wellins, this year's Glasgow International Jazz Festival
composer-in-residence, believes that folk music -- all folk music -- has
a common denominator and illustrates this, as he does much else, with an
anecdote.
He once shared a festival bill with Dizzy Gillespie and afterwards
Gillespie opined that there was a definite African influence in what
he'd heard Wellins play. ''No, Scottish,'' replied Wellins and the two
of them ultimately agreed to differ. About a year later Wellins was
surprised to get a telephone call from Gillespie in New York.
''He'd just heard a pipe band playing in 42nd Street and said, 'Sorry,
you were right'.''
Wellins was born in Glasgow in 1936 and spent much of his childhood in
Montrose, escaping the blitz, where his mother's family were fisherfolk.
The sea has fascinated him ever since, and he moved to Bognor Regis some
years ago to escape London and the temptations of the jazz life. ''I get
a lot of energy from living by the seaside but when I come back up here
I feel recharged.''
The piece he is working on for his GIJF commission, tentatively titled
Images of Scotland, will reflect this. The commission arrived at an
opportune moment. After a visit home four years ago he began working on
a few sketches, trying to give a flavour of Scotland. He had no real
idea how he was going to bring them to fruition. Then he got a call from
GIJF director, Derek Gorman.
With a definite goal to aim for, he began fleshing out those ideas.
The piece will be premiered on July 7 at the Fruitmarket, sponsored by
McEwans, by a group of Scottish musicians -- some home-based, some
expatriates -- including fellow Glaswegian, guitarist Jim Mullen,
trumpeter Bruce Adams, and New York-based baritone saxophonist Joe
Temperley, although Temperley's involvement depends on the availability
of a suitable flight from Sardinia.
''What I wanted to do was to steer clear of 4/4 time, although there's
one section in slow 4/4, because Scottish music is absolutely diseased
with rhythm, as Bing Crosby once said in one of those Road movies. There
are all sorts of other time signatures which are quite natural to us.
''At the same time I was very aware of the musicians I was writing for
because it's all very well getting all inspired and everything but I see
it as my job to bring the best I can out of them.''
Wellins's writing, like his saxophone playing, has always been notable
for its directness and economy, something which has often been lacking
in previous GIJF commissions. Perhaps this will be the year that the
festival commission turns out to be really memorable.
Director Derek Gorman probably wouldn't hear anyone say any different.
The chap is enthusiasm personified. If he can get the message of his
first festival's accessibility across to the general public the way he
did during his launch speech at the Marriott Hotel yesterday, he will be
off to a flyer indeed.
The programme this year is some way short of last year's banquet but
those looking for the big names might be advised to first consider who
those might be. The truth is, jazz has no big names anymore and as
Gorman says, why spend huge amounts of dollars on the supposed
superstars who attract two or three hundred people to the concert hall?
Last year's disastrous Herbie Hancock concert was no doubt what he had
in mind.
The biggest attractions, Carol Kidd and Stephane Grappelli (Theatre
Royal June 30 and July 1 respectively), have both been here before and
look safe bets. But the McEwans Fruitmarket programme includes
interesting newcomers in Cuban saxophonist David Sanchez (July 8), New
York's Mingus Big Band (July 9), and Broadway Music, a group led by
drummer Paul Motian, featuring alto saxophonist Lee Konitz, guitarist
Bil Frisell, saxophonist Joe Lovano and bassist Marc Johnston, and
playing Gershwin, Porter, Berlin, and Rodgers songs in -- it seems safe
to assume -- an entirely new way.
The festival, which runs from June 30 to July 9, has, says Gorman,
something for everyone -- and beware, he may well stop you in the street
to remind you of this.
I was very aware of the musicians I was writing for because it's all
very well getting all inspired but I see it as my job to bring the best
I can out of them

THE conciliation service Acas may be called on in a bid to avert a
threatened strike by 40 hospital porters, angry at what they see as
''extortion'' by their new employers, a private contractor.
The porters at Hairmyres Hospital, East Kilbride, have voted 97% in
favour of industrial action in a secret ballot. This will take the form
of an indefinite strike, starting next Wednesday.
The staff involved are all employed by Pall Mall, a private company
which took over the contract last June.
The employees' union, Unison, yesterday claimed the company was trying
to force the porters to accept the removal of enhanced payments for
late-shift working and overtime, by withholding a 2.39% pay rise, the
money for which was provided by the Hairmyres and Stonehouse NHS Trust.
Mr Jim Logan, shop steward for the porters -- whose take-home pay is
#103 a week -- said Pall Mall had received this pay rise money from the
public purse last month, but had refused to pay it out. It was also
trying to cut an extra 50p-an-hour allowance for working night shifts.
Two security guards at Uddston Geriatric Hospital, in Hamilton, which
is run by the trust, are also affected and the dispute could disrupt
laundry services which Hairmyres carries out for other hospitals, as
well as the delivery of meals, collection of specimens, and disposal of
clinical waste.
Mr Jim Devine, regional organiser for Unison, will today meet members
of Pall Mall's management to discuss the situation. He said last night
that the staff were ''justifiably angry'' and had given a mandate for
strike action.
He would, however, be happy to explore any avenue to resolve the
conflict, which included calling in Acas.
That option was offered last night by the Hairmyres and Stonehouse
Trust's chief executive, Mr Allan Skirving, who contacted the service to
ask if it would be willing to intervene.
He saw Unison officials yesterday and will today meet representatives
of Pall Mall.
Mr Skirving confirmed that the trust had provided funds to Pall Mall,
which it should have received in February, to pay for a 2.39% rise in
wages.
Pall Mall could not be contacted last night.
Industrial Correspondent ROY ROGERS writes: Unison, Britain's largest
trade union, last night warned of a ''long hot summer'' after
recommending that its 440,000 members employed by the NHS reject pay
offers around 1%, and vote for an industrial action ballot.
The union's 40-strong health group executive voted unanimously to
consult members, who will be asked whether they are prepared to take
industrial action, including strike action, to defend national pay
levels and conditions.
The Government's offer to almost one million NHS staff centres on a 1%
national offer topped up by locally-negotiated rises of up to 2%, in an
unashamed bid to force through local bargaining.
The union's head of health, Mr Bob Abberley, said that anger among
health staff throughout the country had never been higher. Ministers
should be in no doubt about the seriousness of the workers' intent and
unless they came up with fair national offers, Britain's hospitals,
would face a long, hot summer.
Meetings between three rail unions yesterday resulted in agreement to
seek a further meeting with British Rail in order to improve on the 2.5%
opening offer to their combined 81,000 members.
The 12,800 BR-employed members of the train drivers' union Aslef have
already indicated in a referendum that they would be prepared to stage
industrial action in support of a ''substantial increase, over and above
the retail price index'', currently 3.4%.
Meanwhile, British Telecom's 130,000 employees are demanding a 6% rise
from July 1, and the National Union of Civil and Public Servants is
seeking a fully-funded increase of ''not less than 4%'' for 60,000 core
civil servants.

HOW many times have you heard this? ''Business leaders make urgent
plea for new roads.'' Well, what a surprise!
Last Thursday the Scottish Chambers of Commerce held a conference on
transport, and The Herald published a special supplement to accompany
the conference.
This gathering was a rare opportunity for Scotland's business leaders
to develop a new vision of the whole country's transport needs, to start
looking at alternatives to road transport, to get to grips seriously
with the concept of sustainability.
The Herald gave us a foretaste of what was to come. Sure, there would
be discussion of rail, air, and sea transport, but the supplement was
crammed with the highly predictable views of the roads lobby, in
particular its groundless opinion that the M74 northern extension is
vital for Scotland's economic survival, presented as if it were fact.
And the editorial toed the same line.
One article even suggested the need for the M74 extension is so
desperate that there's no time for a public inquiry. Fine. Let's abandon
democracy altogether.
No evidence is ever given about the contribution to the economy made
by new roads. Why not? Because the evidence is thin on the ground. The
Leitch Committee found little in 1978, and there has been no
Government-commissioned report into the subject since then. Meanwhile, a
recent study of British cities commissioned by Greenpeace showed that
building new roads bears little relation to creating new jobs.
If roads were the recipe for economic revival, Manchester, Birmingham,
and Belfast would be booming. How long will transport planners go on
believing that new roads generate economic benefits?
No mention is made of last year's Government-backed reports which draw
alternative conclusions about roads, such as that by SACTRA (Standing
Advisory Committee on Trunk Road Assessment). Its research shows
unequivocally that in circumstances of existing road congestion, such as
we have in Glasgow, new roads do, yes they do, generate additional
traffic, in an ever-worsening cycle of congestion.
No mention is made of the otherwise well-publicised conclusions of the
Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution (RCEP) calling for a
''fundamentally different approach'' to transport policy thinking in the
UK. It asks that a balance be struck ''between the ability of transport
to serve economic development . . . '' (of which we read plenty in the
supplement) '' . . . and the ability to protect the environment and
sustain future quality of life'' (of which we read nothing). How can any
discussion of an integrated transport policy be taken seriously, if it
ignores the principle of sustainability?
Instead The Herald invited us to peruse a map of Scotland under the
title ''Essential Guide to the Transport Debate''. This informs us that
''opinion favours'' the M77. Whose opinion? Debate has raged around both
the M77 and the second Forth Road Bridge, yet no mention is made of the
alternative plans which have been endorsed by the major conservation
bodies in Scotland, such as Glasgow for People's ''Instead of the Ayr
Road Route''.
No mention is made either of the total cost of this roads wish-list.
In Glasgow we are talking about over #300m for new roads, which could
far better be spent on our investment-starved public transport,
education, health, and environmental protection, which most people will
identify as real priorities.
''But the M74 extension will be privately financed,'' I hear you cry.
OK, but this system of finance, known as ''shadow tolling'', will depend
for its success on encouraging as many vehicles as possible to use the
new road, in order to get a return on the investment. Does Glasgow
really need yet another congested inner-city motorway?
Even an article about support for rail freight concludes with the view
that for rail freight to succeed, roads would have to be priced ''to
unacceptable levels''. If road budgets included all the social and
environmental costs of roads -- such as the impact on health, severance
of communities, and global warming, to mention but a few -- the price
would immediately escalate, and who knows, railways might even turn a
profit. For communities that end up bearing these costs, the price is
already unacceptable.
I wonder if the conference delegates even noticed the Government's
decision two days before, to heed all the new evidence and rethink its
plans for the M25? Or is Scotland, and Glasgow in particular, to remain
proudly aloof, forever stumbling on towards the dead end of more roads?
When will the business community stop acting like bullies, using their
immense lobbying power to make unreasonable and unbalanced demands of
politicians? When will they start to behave like responsible members of
the wider community?
Glasgow for People -- along with many other community and
environmental organisations -- supports a people-centred, as opposed to
a profit-centred, transport policy. Unlike the business community, we
cannot rely on corporate advertising to subsidise a 16-page supplement
in a national newspaper. Otherwise we could provide your readers with
details of suggested improvements to road and rail networks, public
transport, traffic-calming, cycling routes, and walkways.
We depend instead on our ability to reach out to people and
communities to get involved in transport decision-making. People
pressure will continue to bear down on politicians until a sustainable,
forward-looking, and truly integrated transport policy is implemented.
Such a policy includes people and their environment in the equation, as
well as economic benefits.

NORMAN Anderson, president of the Scottish Schools Rugby Union, faces
a busy few days before handing over the reins of power to vice-president
Tom Robertson.
Anderson will watch Scottish Schools play against Ireland before
travelling south to see the schools under-16 side meet England A at
Castlecroft, Wolverhampton.
Not that the presidency has afforded Anderson much leisure time during
his two years in office, a period that has clearly been a rewarding
experience for the principal teacher of guidance at Berwickshire High
School, Duns.
''I was fortunate in that I took over the presidency in time to go on
what was a highly successful Scottish Schools tour to Australia -- a
tour that has produced a lot of very good rugby players, among them
Graham Dall, Barry Stewart Cameron Murray, Steve Wands, Ken Baillie, and
Jamie Weston,'' said Anderson.
But what has given him considerable pleasure is watching Scottish
Schools perform so well this season. ''We thought we had a good team
last season,'' he said. ''They certainly played well at home against
France and England, but were disastrous in the away matches with Wales
and Ireland.
''I see a big difference this season,'' added Anderson, who reckons
that one of the reasons for the team's success has been consistency in
selection.
''Apart from tight-head prop, the pack has been unchanged. The
forwards have played particularly well and allowed the backs to spread
the ball wide.
''We've scored some cracking tries this season.''
Anderson rates the Scots' only try against England as top drawer.
''The build up by James Craig was every bit as good as that of Eric
Peters' try against Wales,'' says Anderson. ''Maybe we haven't won many
games but what has pleased me is the manner in which we've played.
''We've managed to worry every team we've played against.'' On the
subject of the Bank of Scotland inter-district championship, the
outgoing president is no less enthusiastic.
''I think that this competition was a lot better than last season's
format. Interest in the under-18 championship was sustained right to the
last match, when Glasgow beat Midlands to tie with Lothian.''

THERE is always a strong sense of injustice when a child is seriously
ill, or dies. Many parents suffer inescapable feelings of guilt,
convinced, no matter how illogically, that they could have avoided any
harm coming to their child.
If a baby is born with an illness or disability such as spina bifida
or Down's syndrome it's common for parents to start examining the entire
pregnancy, trying to pinpoint a particular incident which could have
triggered the relevant condition. During such traumatic times support
organisations are instrumental in offering not just practical advice and
information, but in providing emotional care and counselling.
The services supplied by the different organisations vary enormously,
and are constantly being updated. Similarly, the situations involved can
range in severity from pre-emptive care to terminal illness and
bereavement. Irrespective of diversities, the common cause remains the
same.
Each child, parent or other involved family members, and friends are
going through an experience of paramount importance to them, and being
told that others are worse off is neither helpful nor positive. They
need information and support, which can come either from health experts,
or from people who have gone through similar experiences.
Hazel Brooke, executive director of the Scottish Cot Death Trust,
believes that knowledge goes a long way in helping people come to terms
with bereavement. The death of a child is every parent's worst
nightmare, made more so when there is no preparation, as there is when
caring for the terminally ill.
As with every other sudden death in this country, a baby's death is
automatically reported to the procurator fiscal which necessitates a
post mortem. The immediate reaction to the standard workings of the
legal system is often shock and bewilderment. However, the Scottish Cot
Death Trust reports that the police handle this very sensitively, and
the post-mortem results can, in fact, assuage feelings of guilt to some
extent.
At Yorkhill hospital parents are encouraged to see their baby before
the post mortem to say goodbye quietly. They also meet the pathologist
before and after the post mortem, and are invited to return in six weeks
for the result. At the return visit they are given the opportunity to
meet Hazel Brooke for the first time, and thereafter she operates on an
open-door policy. Ten weeks or 10 years later the parents are given the
same time, consideration, and counselling. Brooke helps them to decide
what form this care will take, and if it should extend to meeting
similarly bereaved parents.
As an extension of this service, Yorkhill hospital is scheduled to
open a bereavement centre after the summer, and so offer help to anyone
affected by the death of a child.
Dr June Ross, consultant community paediatrician at Yorkhill, is a
strong supporter of collaborative care. Hospital policy is changing
radically, and the days of keeping children lying unnecessarily in
hospital beds are long gone. Positive intervention with lifetime
management for children with special needs, and long-term illnesses, is
spearheading a very specialist area. Medical training reflects these
changes and junior doctors are now encouraged to look at a child's
illness or disability in the light of their home and school needs.
Eighteen months ago, Dr Kenneth Robertson was appointed consultant
paediatrician of the Yorkhill Diabetes Service, with the prime aim of
taking diabetes care out of the hospital. The two main reasons for this
scheme were that children are invariably happier at home, and that
hospital is such an artificial environment. Diabetes is a condition for
life, which has potential management difficulties, but sufferers have to
learn how to integrate their treatment into their day-to-day routine.
The hospital hopes that the diabetes service will become a useful
model for the future, bearing in mind that there are some conditions for
which home care would not be suitable. Rheumatology, dermatology and
cystic fibrosis could be considered for similar schemes, although
finance may become a problem.
Although care and support for parents is on the increase, the valuable
service the parents themselves provide has become an intrinsic part of
hospital life, especially as staff shortages become more acute. In every
children's hospital there are staff who believe that if the parents were
banned for a week the place would have to shut down. It will be a
telling indictment on present health services if funding is not made
available to extend such innovative schemes to benefit as many as
possible.

SMALL private contractors have been alarmed by a Government directive
allowing council building departments to bid for all construction work
under #500,000 without competitive tender.
Many fear that the temporary moratorium on compulsory competitive
tendering, which began on April 1 and runs until July 1997, will put
their businesses in jeopardy and lead to job losses in already
job-starved areas like North Lanarkshire.
The moratorium has been introduced by the Scottish Office to give
council direct labour organisations breathing space during the
transitional period of local government reorganisation.
The rationale is that DLOs already have enough problems splitting
themselves up in line with the new single-tier authorities without
having to tender for small contracts.
However, a number of small construction and joinery firms are
extremely apprehensive and wonder how they can bridge the gap between
now and July 1997 without ''going to the wall''.
The head of a Lanarkshire firm of joiners, who did not want to be
named, said: ''This is absolutely shattering news as far as we are
concerned. I don't see how some of us are going to survive this
moratorium. Where else do we get work in this area? I can't believe a
Conservative could do this.''
Another small Lanarkshire contractor, also unwilling to be named, said
he, and many of his colleagues, were extremely concerned that Building
and Works would be able to ''cherry-pick'' the available work.
''There is a real problem with the gap between now and July 1997. We
fear many businesses could go under. We have been given verbal
assurances the moratorium won't hurt us and we'll have to cling to that.
But if our fears are realised, we could be wiped away,'' he added.
A regional council spokesman said the moratorium would not affect
large quantities of construction work and claimed there should be work
still available to the private sector on a sub-contract basis.
The caveat was that there were severe shortfalls in the public purse
which could affect the amount of work available.
Councillor Bill Irvine, vice-chairman of Economic and Industrial
Development for Strathclyde region, endeavoured yesterday to calm the
fears of small contractors.
He explained: ''The suspension of compulsory competitive tendering for
two-and-a-half years is a decision of the Government. This was done for
the good reason that you couldn't expect direct labour organisations to
deal with major disaggregation involved in local government
reorganisation and still bid competitively for work in the interim. That
would have been a recipe for chaos and would have resulted in job losses
in local authorities.''
A Scottish Office spokesman said: ''A balance needed to be struck
between the benefits to be gained from CCT and the impact of
reorganisation on contracting.''

THE refereeing row which is casting a shadow over Saturday's Scottish
Junior Cup final rumbles on with Inverness-based official Donald
MacFadyen having been removed from the match.
A telephone poll of executive members of the referee's committee led
to MacFadyen's withdrawal, after he had indicated that he would consider
his position with regard to the game, having withdrawn from a cup-tie
last Saturday.
But MacFadyen claims that he was never asked whether he would, or
would not, be officiating at Saturday's final. His place will now be
taken by Skye referee Bob Wilson.
The referees' executive is due to meet tonight in Fort William in
emergency session to discuss the outcome of last week's disciplinary
meeting when a dozen players were suspended.
The meeting also is due to consider a complaint by a south referee
that he was verbally abused at a match involving Scottish Cup holders
Kyles last weekend. It is understood that the complaints refer to John
Patterson, of Dunoon, a Kyles official, who also is president of the
referees' association.
He may tender his resignation to the meeting in Fort William, which
will be chaired by the referees' vice-president Hugh MacIntyre, of
Kilmallie. Patterson already has survived one attempt to oust him from
his presidential post earlier this season.
The refereeing row has cast a shadow over the game's junior showpiece
in which Fort William and Kilmallie meet in a local derby at Spean
Bridge, the first time the two have met in a national competition final.
Elsewhere, Fort William's first team try for the second time in the
competition to advance in the Camanachd Cup by means of a replay. They
were lucky to come back from a two-goal deficit against Glenurquhart
last weekend, and may not find the Glen in a mood to roll over and
present them with a semi-final place.
Glen will be without David Stewart, who has broken bones in a hand,
and will be out of the game for the next few weeks. A semi-final place
against Kingussie is the prize.
They meanwhile go to Skye needing a point from their last league match
to complete an unprecedented tenth championship on the trot. Skye are
capable of throwing a spanner in the works though, and the relatively
poor playing surface on Skye will not suit the champions.
Nearest challengers, Fort William, have five league games to play and
with the national league final due in Inverness on May 13, Camanachd
Association officials will be hoping that Kingussie qualify for the
final with a win on Saturday.

THE chemical company at the centre of a dispute with Edinburgh
District Council over alleged pollution and the famous ''Granton smell''
has been told that court action against it has been dropped.
In the Court of Session last December, Lothian Chemical Company proved
with an independent survey that the leaching of chemical products into
the soil beside its premises at Granton happened before it moved in.
After serving a notice of irritancy and interdict on the company, the
council was rebuffed by Lord Johnston.
Yesterday, however, company chairman Mr Preston Rabl accused the
council of blatant campaigning in the run-up to the local elections.
It had served a motion for recall of the interdict, but documents seen
by The Herald yesterday reveal that the court move has been dropped.
A letter to the company from their solicitors, Skene Edwards &amp; Garson
WS of Edinburgh, confirms that the district council has dropped its
motion for recall of the interim interdict, and that it does not intend
to re-enrol it for the start of the next court term on April 24.
The company specialises in recycling, fishmeal processing, and making
formaldehyde.
A Herald investigation last December found that signed statements from
witnesses backed up the fact that there were already unpleasant smells
before the company moved there in 1980.
Edinburgh District Council recently declined to comment on its
position.

DOCTORS are trying to keep road accident victim Karen Battenbough
alive for another 10 weeks -- to give her unborn child the gift of life.
The baby inside her is almost five months old and growing normally.
But Mrs Battenbough, 23, is unconscious with massive head and spine
injuries and only part of her brain is working.
Her husband Mike, 30, said: ''She is just lying there, alive but not
alive.
''Karen desperately wanted this baby. She will always come first with
me but at the end of the day the baby will be the only thing.
''It will be all I have left of Karen except for my memories,'' he
added.
Mrs Battenbough, who lost four previous babies through miscarriages,
had undergone painful treatment to ensure her new baby survived.
Doctors have told Mr Battenbough that if Karen can survive a further
10 weeks, they will deliver the baby.
Mr Battenbough, who is maintaining a bedside vigil at Swansea's
Morriston Hospital, added: ''The odds are against Karen coming out of
this coma. It is breaking my heart. I am hoping against hope that Karen
will stay alive until the baby is born.
''The chances are it will be a healthy baby but I know Karen will
never have a useful life again.''
He was driving the family's Ford Sierra when it collided with a bus on
a sliproad of the M4 as they returned home to Penplas, Swansea, after a
Sunday afternoon with relatives.
Mrs Battenbough, a care assistant, has been taken off a life support
system and is breathing unaided. But only the back of her brain is
working, allowing her body to function at a basic level.
Mr Battenbough, a support worker for adults with learning
difficulties, said his wife had been overjoyed at becoming pregnant.
They planned to move into a new house together with seven-year-old Sarah
Jane, his wife's daughter from a previous marriage.

YOUNG &amp; McMillan Ltd, food suppliers to a major segment of the
Scottish catering trade has celebrated doubling its turnover to more
than #15m in just three years coupled with achieving BS5750 (part two)
and ISO9002 quality accreditation.
''We set out to achieve these quality accreditations to emphasise our
high standards within the rigorous requirements of the modern food
chain,'' said sales director James Stuart at the firm's headquarters in
Balmore industrial estate. ''High quality procedures combined with
service have always been among the main reasons for the strength of our
customer list.''
A private, family owned firm, Young &amp; McMillan is the sole Scottish
member of Countrywide Catering Distributors Group. Its associated
company Young &amp; McMillan (Bacon) Ltd is located at Uddingston. The
company is the first independent food wholesaler in Scotland to achieve
the accreditation awards.
''Obtaining BS5750 has already proved important to us,'' said managing
director Hugh Green. ''Staff and management are proud of what we have
achieved -- particularly as it took almost two years and there were
times we wondered if the required procedures would ever end.
''But now we've got there, everyone in our business is aware of the
importance of quality, the mandatory controls that are now in place, and
the importance of not just maintaining these standards but going
forward.''
Contract catering customers, many among the largest operating in the
United Kingdom, are headed by names such as Gardner Merchant, Compass
Services, Shaws, Commercial Catering, Sodexho Services, Whitbread and
Tennent's.
In the non-contract sector the customers list includes leading hotels
such as the Glasgow Hilton and the Sheraton in Edinburgh, Cameron House,
Crieff Hydro and Seamill Hydro as well as many more private hotels and
pubs.
''We continue to strengthen our customer list,'' said James Stuart.
''It is now satisfactory to be able to answer inquiries by saying that
we have BS5750. Much of the work involved bringing together existing
systems and quality procedures, but now the benefits include the way in
which our procedures and our suppliers' procedures match up to our
mutual benefits.''
The progress towards BS accreditation began with every member of Young
&amp; McMillan's management and staff attending a series of discussion
seminars.
''These were for dayshift and nightshift staff,'' said quality manager
Jim McEleny. At first, some initial cynicism and scepticism had to be
overcome. But as we went along the road towards producing the new
manuals of procedures and the importance of what was going on was more
understood we saw attitudes change. People realised that it was the
firm's long-term future and their own long-term future that was at
stake.''
The procedures, often involving the tuning and formalising of existing
systems, were backed by further regular meetings at which staff were
invited to put forward suggestions they thought might help in the new
processes.
''We still have a programme of regular once-a-month meetings attended
by one delegate from each department,'' said Jim McEleny. ''One of the
main benefits of these meetings is that each department is kept in touch
with exactly what is happening in all other departments.''
''Some changes were small, some were quite involved,'' said James
Stuart. ''In the background, each new order that comes in, whether for a
catering concern, a golf club or a restaurant, has to be brought
together efficiently then despatched by one of our trucks direct to the
customer.
''If that order involves chilled products, it has to be despatched at
the correct temperature. We offer the kind of services where one phone
call can get everything needed by a customer to run a restaurant or a
catering operation from foodstuffs to janitorial supplies.''
''BS5750's procedures mean that we can immediately trace back any
instance of a 'rogue' product if that should happen, then further
tighten procedures in that area to make sure it doesn't happen again.''
Young &amp; McMillan's vehicles are all refrigerated and can handle
ambient, chilled or frozen products. In the background, new systems have
been developed to improve the accuracy of the distribution process from
warehouse shelf against customer order form to its final delivery.
Record sales figures continue to be achieved. The biggest single sales
day in the company's long-established history occurred just a few weeks
ago.
''Although the main area of our growth has been in the contract
sector, we are proud to have developed and maintained an excellent
portfolio of private businesses,'' said James Stuart. ''We plan to
advance further in both of these sectors in the 12 months ahead.''

SO HOW, you are riveted to know, do I while away the lonely hours
while waiting for the polling stations to open? I am glad you asked that
question. For relaxation I dip into an old-favourite tome, Presidential
Campaigns, by Paul Boller, the Emeritus Professor of History at Texas
Christian University.
And I take reassurance from the book that, whatever anyone is shouting
about me, they have yelled a damned sight worse on the American
hustings.
Let's start with Abraham Lincoln. In 1864 he was opposed by a Democrat
named General George B McClellan, former Commander in Chief of the Union
forces whom Abe had dropped for having ''the slows''. It was not a fight
for the squeamish.
The New York World, Democrat-supporting, wrote of Lincoln and his
running-mate Andrew Johnson: ''We are asked to consider the claims of
two ignorant, boorish, third-rate backwoods lawyers for the highest
stations in the Government. Such nominations are an insult to the common
sense of the people.''
Among the terms of endearment applied to the President, in print,
were: ''liar, filthy story-teller, despot, thief, braggart, buffoon,
usurper, monster, swindler, and old ignoramus''. As often, the power of
the press was exaggerated -- Lincoln won by 212 electoral college votes
to 21 and with 55% of the popular vote.
In 1888, shades of a much later dispute, the British were accused of
supporting President Grover Cleveland against Benjamin Harrison. The
challenger used this to his advantage and scaped home by 233 to 168
electoral college votes despite having won 100,000 fewer popular votes
than Cleveland.
Maybe the Conservative Party should have remembered that before
throwing in their lot with George Bush.
There was a rather good riposte in the campaign of 1900. A Democrat
supporter of William Bryan insisted: ''Mrs Bryan will be sleeping in the
White House tonight.'' ''If so,'' cried a Republican, ''she will be in
bed with William McKinley.'' Cherie Blair beware.
Mr Bryan, who sounds a lot of fun, had three unsuccessful goes at the
presidency -- ''I feel a bit like the drunk who tried three times to
enter a private club and was thrown downstairs on each occasion.'' He
finally dusted himself down and said thoughtfully: ''These guys don't
really want me in there.'' The Democratic nomination for Vice-President
in 1912, Governor Thomas Marshall, quipped: ''Once there were two
brothers; one ran away to sea, the other became Vice-President, and
neither was ever heard of again.''
Franklin Delano Roosevelt may have wound up a universally-loved
statesman but 'twas not always so. In 1932 he was a labelled ''a
corkscrew and an amiable man but not much more''.
One of his wife Eleanor's friends confessed she had voted for his
opponent. ''So would I have,'' came the reply, ''if I had not been
married to Franklin.''
FDR had a tip for all aspiring politicians. ''Never mention the name
of your opponent. Many people, thousands of them, just cannot remember
names so you should never help them to identify a rival.'' It is a
dictum worth following.
Harry Truman's victory was the one which shocked everyone, though our
own opinion pollsters can usually be relied upon to be wrong. After his
shock win the Nassau County Republican Women replaced a talk on ''Our
New Republican President'' with one entitled: ''It Pays to be
Ignorant.''
Almost everyone liked Ike and Adlai Stevenson could not shift him.
''Did you get than tan on the golf course?'' a woman demanded of
Stevenson.
''No, I have been making outdoor speeches in Florida,'' he replied.
''If you got that brown you talked too long!'' she responded.
Adlai eventually surrendered the democratic nomination to JFK. Yet he
could still smile when he saw a woman, obviously pregnant, parading down
the street with a sign reading: ''Stevenson is the man.'' Now we know it
would have been much more likely to have been Kennedy.
JFK said of Richard Nixon: ''He is experienced all right, he is
experienced in the politics of retreat, defeat, and weakness.'' What
Nixon said of JFK is largely unprintable.
Barry Goldwater did not make much progress against LBJ despite the
quip: ''Johnson has so much power the Democrats don't know whether to
vote for him or plug him in.''
President Gerald Ford was keen to see off the challenge of Ronald
Reagan for the Republican nomination. ''Governor Reagan and I have one
thing in common -- we both played football. I played for Michigan, he
played for Warner Brothers.''
Reagan was teased by Jimmy Carter about how he managed to look younger
every day and be seen to be riding on horseback. ''Jimmy,'' replied RR,
''I just keep ridin' older horses.''
Another of Reagan's defeated opponents, Walter Mondale, admitted he
could not match the President when it came to making speeches on
television. ''After one speech,'' confessed Mondale, ''a supporter rang
in to say it was better typed than it was read.''
My all-time favourite American tale is of the reporter who confronted
Miz Lillian Carter with the news that her son Jimmy was running for
President. ''President of what?'' she asked.
My own dear Mum was once confronted with a similar situation. ''Is it
your boy who is running for the council?'' she was asked.''Probably,''
she replied carefully.
Right, tapes up, off you go, if you don't vote you have no right to
moan. And as we say in racing circles: ''Go on, my son.''

TWO years ago Fife pensioner Sandy Jack hoped to travel to America on
the Hoover free flights offer. Next month he will fly to Des Moines in
Iowa under his own steam to lobby Hoover's parent company, Maytag, for
the second time about the promotional fiasco.
Yesterday in St Helen's, a preliminary court hearing was held for the
cases of 43 people who are dissatisfied with Hoover's handling of their
claims. It's understood more than 80 court cases have already been dealt
with and campaigners say as many as 10,000 could still be pursued.
Hoover says everyone who was entitled to free tickets has been offered
them.
The free flights affair was one of the biggest sales promotion upsets
in marketing history. Two senior officials lost their jobs, the company
spent #48m trying to clean up the mess, and the newspapers were filled
with stories of people who felt they had missed out.
The deal offered two free flights to Europe or America with the
purchase of #100 worth of Hoover goods. It was aimed at lifting sluggish
company sales after the firm reported a #10.6m deficit in the first nine
months of 1992. It meant a boom time for the company's plant at
Cambuslang, Lanarkshire, which was under threat of closure.
Seven-day-working shifts were started and 75 extra workers taken on.
It's not known exactly how many people pursued the offer, but Hoover
say a total of 200,000 people eventually flew out.
The Hoover Holiday Pressure Group say yesterday's block group of cases
in St Helen's could be the beginning of a whole new series of court
claims unless the company thrashes out some sort of compromise.
Harry Cichy, a 39-year-old businessman who heads the HHPG, said they
have 10,000 members across the UK -- at least 15% of them from Scotland
-- and all of their claims could end up in court. ''Unless we can get a
deal where we can negotiate a settlement they may all go to court. All
we want is what we purchased, the right to free tickets. We need to sit
round the table to talk it out and see if we can come to some sort of
agreement. All of our members feel aggrieved and annoyed that they have
been taken for mugs.''
Cichy will accompany Sandy Jack to Des Moines for Maytag's annual
meeting next month. The pressure group say they bought 500 shares in the
firm so they could attend last year's Maytag meeting. Mr Cichy said they
were well received by the shareholders and allowed to put their points,
but he said he did not believe the Americans appreciated the scale of
the situation in the UK.
Mr Jack, from Methil in Fife, a former commando, lost a court claim
against Hoover in 1993 but has continued to lobby the firm over the free
flights issue.
''I'm not fighting for myself,'' said Mr Jack yesterday. ''I'm
fighting for the many other people who are not as capable as me of
speaking out. We are still just as determined. We are seeking
negotiation of some sort. At the moment they are not prepared to talk,
not prepared to discuss.''
A spokeswoman for Hoover, however, said the company had suggested that
solicitors for both sides meet, after an initial approach by the
campaigners. Judith Lawson said the pressure group had so far not
followed up on this.
She said in the company's opinion everybody who was entitled to
tickets was offered them. ''In Hoover terms, no-one is still waiting.
They may not have taken them up, but they were certainly offered
tickets. We fulfilled our obligations in that area.''
Ms Lawson said Hoover had won the majority of court cases over the
flights promotion so far, and dismissed suggestions that Hoover sales
had slumped by 20% following the publicity about the promotion.
''Hoover sales are doing very well. At the time of the promotion,
sales were very good and sales are still very good.''
''The promotion was obviously seriously misjudged and the calculations
went seriously astray. The demand way outstripped what had been expected
and that was the fatal flaw.''
Despite the publicity surrounding the issue, she said, Hoover had
maintained a good reputation.

BEEF consumption throughout the UK increased last year, despite all
the bad publicity the red meat industry has suffered first through fears
over BSE and then over export of veal calves to the Continent.
The cheering news was delivered in Perth by Don Curry, the chairman of
the Meat and Livestock Commission, when he spoke at a presentation
dinner staged in honour of one of Scotland's best known butchers, Jim
Royan from Elgin, who has stepped down after 17 years as a MLC
commissioner.
A happy Mr Curry, who farms in Northumberland rearing both beef and
sheep, reckoned the extensive and expensive television advertising
campaign undertaken by the MLC based on the theme of Meat -- The Recipe
for Love had been a major factor in beef storming back into consumer
favour.
Mr Curry said: ''We hear far too much about vegetarianism and how meat
is almost a health hazard. Nothing could be further from the truth.''
The precise figures as revealed by the MLC yesterday afternoon show
that to the end of 1994 beef consumption rose from 15.5kgs per head to
15.9kgs. Pork consumption also increased marginally to 13.9kgs, but lamb
fell back yet again to 5.8kgs, largely, said Mr Curry, because of high
prices and increased export trade.
Sadly, however, the traditional family butcher is not sharing in this
increased sales picture. In Scotland there are now little more than 1000
outlets of this type and numbers are still falling as the supermarkets
win a greater market share. Jim Ewing, a former president of the
Scottish Federation of Master Butchers, commented: ''Conditions are
tough for the family butcher unless he really homes in on the quality
end and offers superior service.''
Mr Ewing also conceded that the upsurge in beef sales has largely been
a factor generated by the catering trade, confirming the trend that
increasing numbers of people are now either eating out or buying
take-away meals.
In paying tribute to Jim Royan, Mr Ewing outlined his career: ''In
1973 he was instrumental in establishing the Scotch Quality Beef and
Lamb Association, while in 1978 he became an MLC commissioner. He also
pioneered sales of Scottish meat to Europe, and certainly helped to open
up the French and German markets. No-one has stayed the course longer,
and it's fair to say that he gave the whole retail trade 'a new pair of
specs' through which to view our sector. He has been a true innovator.''
Mr Royan also has the distinction of being the first Scottish retail
butcher to judge cattle at the prestigious Royal Smithfield Show. That
was in 1982, and he was invited back again in 1986. He also became the
first chairman of the Farm Assured Scotch Livestock initiative in 1990.
Mr Curry was also full of praise: ''Jim and his 17 years with MLC are
and will remain unique. It's an amazing accomplishment to see off five
chairmen and three directors general -- and he's still a young man.'' Mr
Curry also pointed out that Mr Royan had been a driving force in
streamlining the MLC: ''In 1978 we had a staff of 1300, now that's been
cut back to just 500. There have been big changes in the industry over
the years and it hasn't always been easy.''
Mr Royan in turn warmly thanked everyone who had worked with him over
the years, saying: ''If we have achieved anything it's been because of
teamwork.''

YESTERDAY'S agreed bid from Charles Schwab for loss-making Sharelink,
the execution-only telephone share-dealing service for private
investors, at a level below the 1993 flotation price of 250p reflects
the difficulties the company has been experiencing in the present
uncertain climate in UK share markets.
The terms, though, are better than might have been expected when the
shares fell to 135p. This was only a few weeks ago and compares with a
high last November of 428p.
Sharelink had announced last week that it was in preliminary
discussions about the possibility of a bid after its share price had
soared.
In the event Schwab, the largest US discount broker, is offering
235p-a-share cash with a full loan note alternative valuing Sharelink at
#39.7m. The news lifted the share price 19p to 232p.
All the directors of Sharelink, whose chief executive David Jones
founded the company in 1987, along with certain related parties have
given an irrevocable undertaking to accept the terms in respect of a
total of 14.64% of the issued share capital.
The apparent alacrity with which the bid has been accepted would
appear to indicate that Sharelink sees little prospect of an improvement
in trading in the short term to attract profits and support the share
price so that shareholders could expect a full return on their
investment.
Indeed, the company believes that the volatility in the market, which
has so deterred investors, will remain for the foreseeable future,
increasing the requirement for long-term investment.
The acquisition will significantly enhance Schwab's presence in the UK
while, from Sharelink's siege point of view, the former's financial
resources and US brokerage expertise are expected to help strengthen its
longer term prospects.
Schwab, whose low-cost brokerage allows private investors to deal in
shares without paying for advice, had been looking for a way of
expanding, not just in the UK, where it already has a limited
stockbroking operation, but also into Continental Europe and Sharelink
could be the ideal vehicle.
Hit by low volumes in its Birmingham dealing room, Sharelink suffered
a pre-tax loss of #468,000 for the half-year to September 30, compared
with profits of #3.68m. This was foreshadowed by a profits warning which
is when the shares began their dramatic slide.
The company's financial year ended on March 31 and, despite a positive
seasonal bias in the fourth quarter, investment activity in the second
half of the year has been lower overall than in previous years.
At a time when investment interest appears to be lacking among private
investors, influenced by a slowdown in privatisations, Sharelink looks
an obviously vulnerable operation. Schwab is not going to be able to
inject a new lease of life into share markets, and the outlook for
further major privatisations is pretty limited and becoming politically
more difficult all the time.
The public's initial enthusiasm, anyway, appears to be waning now that
most of the favourites have been rolled off the stocks. So it will be
interesting to see how Sharelink progresses under the Schwab wing.
David Jones, who stays as chief executive of Sharelink, is naturally
confident that the partnership with Schwab will enable the company to
develop further its market position and take advantage of the
''significant'' opportunities available.
Shareholders, meanwhile, can be thankful that they suffered only
limited damage.

A SAINSBURY store in west Edinburgh is to be linked with a #20m retail
park, writes Stewart McIntosh.
The site is a plant storage yard, owned by the Miller Group, which
adjoins the Sainsbury store at Craigleith. A detailed planning
application, to adjust the existing planning consent for the 11-acre
site, has been lodged with Edinburgh District Council by Retail Parks
(Scotland) Ltd -- a joint venture between Miller Developments and
Stannifer.
Anchor tenant for the new retail park is Homebase, the DIY retail
chain which recently bought Texas Homecare. Homebase has taken a pre-let
of 35,000 sq ft with an adjoining garden centre of 11,500 sq ft beside
its parent company, J Sainsbury.
The proposals are for 122,500 sq ft of non-food retail space, with car
parking. The development will be linked via covered walkways to the
Sainsbury food store which opened in 1993.
The site already has detailed planning consent for a retail park which
was to be developed separately from Sainsbury's. The new proposals join
the schemes together providing an integrated shopping environment with
improved traffic and parking arrangements.
Subject to planning permission, it is planned to start work on site in
the summer of 1995, with completion by Easter 1996.
Joint agents to Retail Parks (Scotland) Ltd are Peter Campbell &amp; Co
and Jones Lang Wootton.
A spokesperson for retail Parks (Scotland) Ltd said: ''This will be a
fully integrated retail development with an attractive mix of retailers,
which we believe will appeal to consumers in the centre and west of
Edinburgh. There is significant interest from major retailers and we
hope to make further, positive announcements shortly.''

AFTER being the first tenant in the building, Independent Insurance
Company has increased its space in Guardian Properties' 163 West George
Street.
Independent has taken a further 6000 sqare-feet on terms co-terminus
with their existing lease, which has a break option in November 2007 and
a review due in November 1999. The stepped rental rises to #14 per sq ft
in the fifth year.
Only one floor, of 6100 sq ft, remains available for let in the
building.
Ian Cody, of Guardian Properties, commented: ''Independent Insurance
are a quality covenant and we are delighted they have chosen to expand
within 163 West George Street. With names like Clydesdale Bank, Scottish
Widows and Chubb Insurance, 163 West George Street has proved that a
quality development attracts quality organisations.''
Hillier Parker and J Trevor &amp; Webster advised Guardian Properties.

THERE was once a time when the UK courts were free to decide disputes
between ordinary private employers and their employees, according to the
plain meaning of Acts of Parliament and judicial decisions.
The system had many attractions, not the least of which was that
everyone knew where they stood. In the event of any dispute, the rules
would be applied literally -- as though they meant what they said.
That, however, is not the way they do things in Luxembourg, home of
the European Court of Justice.
Since European Union Law has supremacy over national law in those
areas to which the Treaty of Rome applies, European Court decisions have
to be followed by courts and tribunals here. The European Court does not
normally decide on the facts of a case. It delivers broad statements of
principle and it does so ''purposively'' not literally.
The buzz word is purposively. It means that if asked to decide what a
particular directive means, they decide, as a matter of policy, what the
result should be and work back from there, bending or stretching the
wording as necessary.
Effectively, they lay down rules retrospectively. Nowhere is this more
actutely illustrated than in their recent interpretations of the
Business Transfers Directive.
The Directive was issued in 1977 to protect the employment rights of
workers in the event of the merger of a business or the transfer of a
business or undertaking from one employer (''the transferor'') to
another (''the transferee'').
It works by automatically transferring the employees to the
transferee. It has been the subject of much ''purposive'' interpretation
in recent years, especially in the wake of the Government's policy of
compulsory competitive tendering in the public sector.
For example, Mrs Schmidt was a lone cleaner in a German bank. The bank
decided to stop employing an in-house cleaner and to use an agency
instead. The agency offered to employ Mrs Schmidt, but she refused
because, although the terms of the employment were broadly the same, she
would have to clean a larger area. She argued that she was a going
concern, so the Directive applied to her.
Amongst others, the UK argued that the fact that an undertaking, in
this case a bank, ceases an activity such as cleaning its own premises
and pays another company to do it instead cannot constitute the transfer
of a business or part of a business. ''Oh yes it does,'' said the
European Court.
According to that purposive interpretation, Mrs Schmidt and her mop
are a going concern. Where does all this lead?
Suppose I decide to change the agency which sends Agnes once a week to
clean my house? Might the new agency then find that they now employ
Agnes by operation of law? On the back of the Schmidt case, the answer
may well be yes.
Politically, it is easy to see why the European Court might have
wanted to achieve this result. The Directive was there to protect the
security of employment of employees so that, for instance, ruthless
contractors would not undercut each other by diminishing employees' pay
and conditions.
That is a laudable objective. The problem is that the Directive was
never framed to cover the sort of situation referred to above.
The purposive interpretation used by the courts in these cases makes
it difficult for anyone other than a specialist employment lawyer to
anticipate what is likely to happen and what sorts of situations are
likely to be deemed ''business transfers''.
Surely it would have been better if the Directive had been amended to
state that it would apply in such circumstances and the words of the
Directive had then been given their ordinary meanings?
At present, businesses make decisions about such deals on the basis of
the law and then discover that they are judged against constantly
changing standards after the event. That is unfair.
In fact, purposive interpretation has now been forced on our own
national courts in a slightly different way.
Whenever national law conflicts with EU law, the UK courts are under a
duty to ''do everything possible'' to interpret the national law so as
to give effect to a relevant EU Directive or European Court decision.
Thus, in the past, the House of Lords has been prepared to imply whole
phrases into British legislative provisions so as to bring them into
line with EU directives when deciding cases.
So a Statue may seem clear but years later one find words and phrases
added to it that give it a wholly different and unanticipated meaning.
Purposive interpretation can best be described as ''moving the goal
posts''.
It is ordinary employers and employees who suffer from not being able
to order their affairs or enter deals and transactions with any degree
of confidence that the rules set out will actually be followed in the
event of a challenge.
Surely it must be possible for directives to say what they mean and be
interpreted in such a way that it is not necessary for ordinary citizens
to try and second guess the European Court or Parliamentary draughtsman?
Mary Kearns, a solicitor specialising in Employment Law with Brodies
WS, was talking to Yvonne Wightman.

STUART Polwart and Patrick Duffy have found themselves in some tight
corners since they launched Scitech Engineering four years ago.
Using hi-tech spark erosion machinery, Stuart and Patrick carry out
repairs to machinery which would normally have to be carried out in a
workshop.
This has meant that they have found themselves on oil rigs not only in
the North Sea but also in the South China Sea off Thailand.
Other cries for help have come from diverse sources from a Royal Navy
submarine to the Waverley paddle steamer.
''You could say that our technology has replaced the sledgehammer and
the gas torch. We go to places with our portable equipment when
companies cannot get the machinery to a workshop, or it would be
extremely costly for them to do so,'' explains Stuart.
The two workmates launched Scitech Engineering in Stirling Enterprise
Park in 1990 after spotting equipment in the United States which no one
was using in this country.
''We had worked together in a Livingston computer company, but had
both left and we were looking around for a business idea which was
different,'' says Stuart.
Normally when Scitech receive a call it is an emergency and in
situations where time costs money.
''It costs #30,000 a day if a rig is not operating, so naturally the
companies want repairs done as quickly as possible,'' Stuart adds.
''The call out to the Waverley steamer on the Clyde was not of the
same nature but,'' explains Stuart, ''the company had tried a number of
things to resolve a problem they were having but could not manage it. We
however managed to get our kit into a very tight space, and fixed it.''
At present Patrick is in the Mediterranean working on board a merchant
ship.

CHARLIE Jackson started off his working life as a PE teacher. Now he
trains your brain rather than the muscles of your body. His Change
Management International consultancy has launched a series of seminars
to teach people the techniques used in accessing different parts of
their minds from the ones they normally use.
''Most people can use their left brain which is analytical and
logical. It is the brain of the past where a person stores experiences
but we want to give people the technique to use the other half of their
brain,'' he says.
The right side of the brain, which uses imagination and creativity
skills, often falls into disuse, says Charlie Jackson. This takes place
after we go to school when we are taught logic and to memorise facts and
figures -- functions which rely on the left side of the brain for
assistance.
This process carries on into our working lives and, Charlie Jackson
says: ''In most companies there are redundant brains which have not been
accessed. Company executives are constantly going into their left brain,
and into the past because of the way they do things.''
Our mind, says the consultant, is ''so much more powerful that we
realise''.
Charlie Jackson has practical proof of this as 18 months ago he
attended a seminar in Birmingham at which, after listening to the main
speaker, Antony Robbins, he walked over 12 ft of hot coals and
experienced no pain or burns.
''If your mind can overcome that,'' he says, ''what else can it do?''
The consultant believes that many companies could benefit by their
employees being trained on how to access the right brain.
He points to a large hotel group he helped in this way, which, after a
series of awareness seminars for their staff, went on to win the Europe
Hotel of the Year award.
In the field of sport Charlie was golfer Brian Marchbank's ''mind
coach'' for two years, during which time the golfer had his best ever
year on the European Tour.
But Charlie Jackson is not just into brain power. He still enjoys
physical sport and runs marathons. He also played rugby and was a stand
off for Ayr and Leith.
After his rugby playing days were over he coached Edinburgh Accies
between 1983-89, and today he is the President of Edinburgh Accies.

A SHERIFF yesterday upheld the reputation of the Tay as a salmon
river.
Sheriff J Irvine Smith at Perth was told that John Boyle, 28, denied
illegally fishing for salmon on the Tay. Boyle maintained that he was
after fish other than salmon.
Defence lawyer Mr John Slavin, who pointed out that his client caught
nothing, submitted that the Crown had failed to prove that the Tay was a
river frequented by salmon.
Sheriff Smith, a visiting judge, said: ''I have never been a full-time
sheriff in Perth but I am familiar with what is paid for the privilege
of owning or leasing fishing rights on the river . . . and you don't pay
money like that to catch minnows.''
The sheriff, himself an angler, added that he was satisfied that the
lure Boyle used was meant for salmon.
Boyle, of Lochaber Crescent, Springhill, Shotts, Lanarkshire, was
found guilty of the main charge and fishing on a Sunday. He was fined
#225 and his equipment confiscated.

BRITISH Petroleum ''bullied and bribed'' its 800-strong workforce at
Grangemouth into accepting union derecognition, STUC general secretary
Campbell Christie claimed yesterday.
Speaking in Glasgow, Mr Christie said: ''There has been a concerted
effort by all of the major oil companies to render the unions
effectively powerless.
''BP conducted two ballots via the Industrial Society between December
1994 and March this year, with apparently poor results. There was
bullying and bribery and then a third ballot, after which the company
declared that it had a majority.
''The workers were sent letters spelling out the terms of their new
personal contracts. These included #1500 lump sum payments and a 6% wage
rise in return for abandoning collective bargaining.
''It is absolutely appalling that a major firm like BP should go to
such underhand lengths to force the issue and carry out a series of
quite illegitimate balloting practices. We are pressing for an immediate
meeting with senior management at the plant.''
A spokesman for BP said last night: ''Management here was challenged
by head office to come up with a plan which would make the refinery a
world-beater. We asked the workforce for ideas and they came up with
hundreds of suggestions.
''We then set up a 60-strong group, which comprised at least 50% trade
union members and no senior management, and asked them to filter the
suggestions and come up with the best.
''There was a consistent wish to get rid of the 'them-and-us'
mentality. People wanted a one-team approach and a levelling of terms
and conditions. That approach was incompatible with collective
bargaining for some.
''We did send out slips to the workers on three occasions, pointing
out advantages, and offering the chance to submit those slips to the
Industrial Society and an independent body which would monitor numbers
and ensure confidentiality.
''When we were assured that we had substantially more than 50% of the
workforce on our side, we sent out letters with the new contracts. There
was no bullying.
''Trade unions still have a vital role to play in safety and pensions.
Nor is there derecognition. We have simply removed collective bargaining
as a union role.''
Meanwhile, the national Certification Office reported that trade union
income fell by #7m in 1993 to #616m, the first recorded drop in
subscriptions since 1979. Union membership in the UK declined by 263,000
between 1992 and 1993.

FOR the first time in ages yesterday, I consulted my horoscope. Not
for the week ahead but for the week past. The week ahead can wait.
A lot of people will be doing it this way from now on, thanks to an
American called Warren Smith. He's suing a palm reader for #2m, claiming
that he paid her to predict the winning numbers in the US lottery. He
didn't win. So he's taking the palm reader to court for the amount of
the jackpot which, by rights, should have been his. Seems fair enough.
Palm readers, crystal ball gazers, astrologers -- they're all part of
the same business and the business is now retrospective litigious
consultation. You read your horoscope predictions for the week or the
month just past, and if the forecast hasn't come true you dial your
lawyer.
So I folded open a Sunday newspaper for March 26, put it in a
half-open desk drawer, placed my pocket calculator on top, and pretended
to be absorbed in a report on why somebody would pay Rangers FC an
estimated #1m to become an ''associate director'' with no voting rights
or boardroom powers. The chairman has found this deeply interesting.
My horoscope said my confidence had not been high but a compliment
would give me a boost. (Wrong on both counts. I was confident that
Scotland wouldn't score in Moscow, and I'm still waiting for the
compliment. I tapped #500 into the calculator.) I'd feel the need for a
fresh start but would have to be careful about a family member's
emotions. (Correct. I always feel the need for a fresh start -- who
doesn't? -- but that's not the same as making one. I'm always wary about
a family member's emotions. I tapped minus-#500 into the calculator. I
was getting nowhere.)
Then I realised The Braces was standing behind me, watching
incredulously. I sighed and explained. The Braces said I was wasting my
time. ''Take me,'' he said. ''According to my stars, I should have
engaged the attention of my superiors during the week ending January 28.
But I was at Klosters and didn't meet a soul from the office, for
once.''
I tapped another #500 into the calculator. It was going to be a long
day.
* This week's MORI survey of the ''middle business'' sector threw up
some expensively-culled facts that anyone could have learned for free if
they joined us at our coffee break in the Nerd House commissariat.
We're told more than half the chief executives of middle-sized
independent companies believed a satisfactory income for their good
selves was ''more than #75,000''. The Braces yawned. ''That leaves
plenty of scope,'' he said. ''For example, #450,000 is 'more than
#75,000', before any bonuses taking you over #1m.
''And what does 'satisfactory' mean? One man's satisfaction is another
man's P45.'' The Braces had a mid-morning hangover.
But the oddest fact from the survey was that chief executives working
more than 70 hours a week don't like to be called workaholics. This was
very puzzling. What was their objection?
Ms Angelica Banana-Skyne, the High Whitecraigs polymath, had a theory.
''Workaholic is now a dictionary word,'' she said. My Chambers
definition is 'addicted to work, coined facetiously in imitation of
alcoholic'. The suffix '-aholic' or '-oholic' can be added to any noun
you choose: clothesoholic, mobile-phonoholic, probably even
anguille-in-umido-al-vino-biancoholic.''
This was OK. People could certainly be addicted to stewed eels in
white wine. But middle-business bosses putting in 70 hours a week didn't
do so because of a craving: they had other reasons. ''Your average
junior hospital doctor does more than 70 hours a week, but nobody
describes her as a workaholic.''
''Or him,'' said The Braces, yawning again.
Ignoring the interruption, Angelica concluded: ''Bosses who work more
than 70 hours do so for one of four reasons: fear, greed, bad
organisation, or to avoid emptying the dishwasher at home.'' She rested
her case.
But that still left us with the problem of what we should call them.
Each of us had a suggestion. ''Hypernuts?'' (The Braces.)
''Angst-riders?'' (Angelica.) ''Twitchmasters?'' (Me.) In the end, we
agreed that the workaholics would be better off learning to live with
the label.
''God!'' said Angelica, looking at her watch. ''Is that the time?'' We
fled in mild terror.

A GLASGOW car dealer has been forced to forfeit #19,800 in the first
successful attempt in Scotland by Customs and Excise to confiscate money
allegedly connected with the drugs trade.
Mr Lachlan Leith, 40, of Derwent Court, North Woodside Road, Glasgow,
was ordered by Sheriff Charles Stoddart on Tuesday to relinquish any
claim to the money.
Customs officials had intercepted a friend of Mr Leith, Mrs Vivienne
Cargill, 39, of Bellwood Street, Shawlands, Glasgow, after she tried to
board a flight to Amsterdam from Glasgow Airport in September 1993.
Mrs Cargill was carrying #21,429 in used notes -- #19,800 said to
belong to Mr Leith -- and 130 Dutch guilders.
Her claim that she was taking the money to meet Mr Leith in Amsterdam
to buy cars was not believed by investigating officers, who held the
cash pending further investigation.
Under the Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Act 1990,
Customs and Excise can confiscate money being taken either in or out of
the country if it is suspected to be generated from drug sales or
intended to fund purchases.
This generally involves amounts over #10,000, and includes travellers'
cheques as well as cash. The individuals involved have the right to
contest seizures, and have to prove that the money was made legitimately
to get it back.
Mr Leith did not contest the civil action. The money goes to the
Treasury, together with any interest accrued. It will then be used to
boost the fight against drug trafficking.
No criminal charges have been brought against Mr Leith or Mrs Cargill.

A NEW marketing consortium of 25 of the best small guest houses in
Scotland has been launched. Scotland Deluxe, which takes its name from
the grading its members have achieved under the Scottish Tourist Board's
classification system, is the brainchild of Christine Ondersma. She is a
Scot who spent many years in the US, and now runs Spottiswoode guest
house at Seamill, near West Kilbride with her husband Jim.
Christine is grateful for the enthusiastic help and support of
Scottish Enterprise and the Scottish Tourist Board. Small is beautiful
as far as Scotland Deluxe is concerned. Membership is restricted to
guest houses with no more than 10 bedrooms. They are spread throughout
the country, from Inverness to Dalbeattie, and charge from #15 to #50
per night per person.
All group members offer such special services. These include arranging
golf and fishing trips, cookery and craft demonstrations, and advising
on places of interest and days out.

THE liquidator of the collapsed Clydesdale electrical retailing chain
yesterday announced a first interim dividend of 10p in the pound, which
will be paid to agreed creditors in May.
With Clydesdale Electrical Stores' four creditor banks, Royal Bank of
Scotland, Bank of Scotland, Barclays and Rothschild, having been paid in
full, the dividend relates to 1000-plus trade creditors. They are owed
about #30m.
The proposed payment was announced at a creditors' meeting in Glasgow
by joint liquidator Roger Powdrill, a partner of accountancy firm Touche
Ross.
With less than one year having passed since his appointment, Mr
Powdrill said: ''Considering the complexity of the liquidation, it is a
major achievement to announce this dividend in such a short period of
time.''
The liquidators ultimately expect to repay creditors a total of 25p
for every pound owed by Clydesdale.
There will probably be another two payments, with Touche Ross unable
to settle matters finally until 1999.
Customers who participated in Clydesdale's money-back promotions in
1990 or 1991 will not become creditors until the schemes mature in 1998
or 1999.
The liquidators have already received #2m worth of potential claims
from such customers, with the total amount owed as a result of
promotional schemes estimated at #6.5m.
Mr Powdrill will seek court approval to put money aside to provide a
dividend for these potential creditors.

For connoisseurs of the humble fish supper Anstruther is Mecca, as
JAMES LAING reports
THE little shop boasts a sparkling clean livery of a light-blue sign
against a white and black background. The interior is tiny, allowing
perhaps a dozen customers to reach, eventually, the shoulder high
counter.
Outside in the street it is a different story. The queue waiting to
approach that counter can stretch for yards and yards along the
pavement.
This is the Anstruther Fish Bar, a focus for fish and chip gourmets
for many miles around.
It has been known for a family to drive 50 miles or more to stand in
the queue for an hour and-a-half for a meal they will consume in 10
minutes.
Almost every day, winter and summer, the harbour car park in the East
Fife fishing town is crammed with cars.
In each an elderly couple or a family will be tucking into the
contents of their cardboard boxes.
In summer the benches and seats are full of tourists and visitors
enjoying probably the best fish supper they have ever eaten.
''Some of the older couples make a real picnic of it,'' said bar owner
Ian Whyte. ''They bring a table cloth, knives and forks, a flask of tea
and make it an occasion.
''We have regulars who come two or three times a week.''
And other tourists come from all over the world to sample the simple
and succulent fare.
A coach operator in Edinburgh regularly buses over parties of
American, Japanese or European holidaymakers to enjoy a traditional
Scottish treat.
''We have had them from Austria, Germany, Spain, Italy --
everyhwere,'' said Ian.
One New Zealand artist, caught with a long time to spare in the queue,
made a sketch of the bar tucked into the ground floor of the ancient
pier-side house.
He made it into an etching and published it as a card which is now
circulating throughout the world.
The popularity of the Anstruther fish bar is phenomenal.
Some people even drive over from Glasgow, forsaking the Ayrshire coast
resorts, with the prospect of an Anstruther fish supper as a special
treat.
One elderly customer who drives 20-odd miles from her Kirkcaldy home
at least once a week to enjoy her outdoor meal with her pensioner
husband was asked if she knew of the shop when she was on holiday in
England.
The owner, Ian Whyte and his wife, Ann, are just back from a short
holiday abroad to face the next seven months when they will be open 12
hours a day and seven days a week.
But the queues may be diminished slightly this year. Ian and Ann are
opening a 52-seat restaurant at the other end of Shore Street
overlooking the harbour where diners will be able to sit in comfort over
their meal.
However, the light blue and white livery remains, as will the quality
of a the food.
And that is the secret.
The quality is guaranteed because the fish is absolutely fresh and
nothing is pre-cooked.
A customer who eventually reaches the inside of the bar after queuing
outside is asked for the order and the meal is cooked there and then.
There is no rack of tired looking battered fishing lining the glass
warming compartment waiting for a customer.
Chips are constantly shovelled from the pans into the serving trays to
meet the immediate demand.
Ian and Ann are helped in the business by their son, Stuart, and
daughter, Allison, plus an enthusiastic and committed staff.
They have built their reputation over the last 14 years since they
moved to Fife and they are now included in some of the best restaurant
guide books vovering Scotland.
And it is a reputation earned without entering any of the formal
''good food'' competitions.
''I don't need to,'' said Ian. ''My customers tell me how popular we
are.''
And it is no accident. Ian is a trained chef who was born in Arbroath
and has worked all over the place, including a spell in the Merchant
Navy. ''But we all love living in Fife and especially Anstruther,'' he
said.
And serving a lovely fish supper.

DAVID ROSS reports on a venture based on messing around in boats
TWENTY-FIVE years ago Jim Hogan and his new wife Elizabeth were busy
preparing a cabin cruiser called the Myra for her new life on Loch Ness
and the Caledonian Canal.
The 21-foot craft cost #1600 and was officially two to four-berth, but
could barely sleep its complement comfortably. She was, however, to be
the foundation stone of a highly successful business, which in turn
pioneered an important development of modern Scottish tourism which now
means #3m annually to the economy of the Great Glen.
Within 10 years of tarting up the Myra, the Hogans had over 50
cruisers plying the waters of Loch Ness, Loch Oich and Loch Lochy linked
by 22 miles of man-made cutting. This was Thomas Telford's Caledonian
Canal, 60 miles long, which had taken 19 long years of construction
before the first ship left Inverness's Muirtown Locks on Oct 23, 1822
headed for Fort William through mainland Scotland.
The canal cost nearly #1m to build at the beginning of last century,
but it would take #3.5m today to set up the business that the Myra
started: Caley Cruisers; Caley Marina and Chandlery; and the workshops
which together employ 20 people full-time.
Jim Hogan, however, wasn't the obvious man to start a boat business:
''I didn't know much about boats. I was a mechanic with the Forestry
Commission, that was my work. But my dad had a filling station at Brodie
near Nairn. When he died I went back to take it over.
''I was working away there and began thinking about Loch Ness and the
canal. Nothing was happening on the leisure front. The Norfolk Broads,
however, was supporting about 2000 boats. But Loch Ness was the most
famous piece of water in the world.''
The first to take the Myra out was Comyn Webster, then editor of
Scottish Field -- ''He left in a thunderstorm and returned with his nose
sunburnt.'' He also subsequently gave the Hogan enterprise vital
publicity.
That was in June 1970. By the end of the season Caley Cruisers had
chartered the Myra 12 times at #25 a week. The Myra, however, was too
small and was sold to a man who had chartered her that first summer and
she is still on the canal. By the next summer they had three boats; four
in 1972; six in 1973; and so on until in 1981 there were 51 cruisers in
the Hogan fleet.
What made this enormous expansion possible was the length of the
charter season. It just grew and grew in the first six years and in 1977
with 32 boats, Caley Cruisers had a 30-week season.
''People would take their holidays when we could fit them in, they
were coming up in October. Our timing was right. There was an explosion
of boating on the hire side. People who were to go on and buy their own
boats, wanted to sample it,'' says Jim.
''What we offered here was a sense of adventure, the Norfolk Broads
can't really be described as adventure, it is a pub crawl. But in the
scenery of the Great Glen and with these lochs we were offering
adventure. If there is good weather we have happy customers, if the
weather is rough we have very happy customers because of the adventure.
''It wasn't long before we had some competition. In 1971 Loch Ness
Marine started to build a boat for hire and in 1972 North Highland
Charter started. By the mid 1970s there were five firms operating, but I
have always managed to hold 50% of the market.''
The 1970s were the great years for charter, a time of expansion on the
canal. But by the end of the decade things began to drop off and carried
on through most of the 1980s when only twice did the length of season
match even 1971.
According to Jim Hogan the explanation is simple: ''We are a barometer
of employment trends. If you look at these years when things were low
for us, unemployment was high but as we start to come out of recession
and people get back to work things pick up for us.''
The Hogans take great pride in their business, determined to maintain
their position as market leaders. Everything is geared to the modern
customer, centrally-heated cruisers with micro-waves cookers and
showers. They even keep a survey vessel equipped with sonar systems for
those who want to go Nessie hunting.
They deserve their success which was won despite the advice of
experts. ''When we were about to start the local tourist board told us
that a study had just be done which showed that the charter business
wouldn't take off on the canal,'' says Jim,
''When we went to the Highlands and Islands Development Board they
said they would back us if we put the garage at Brodie up as part of the
guarantee. So we decided just to do it by ourselves. If we failed then
we would just sell the boat.''
The HIDB's then chairman, Andrew Gilchrist, shortly afterwards
realised the potential and more realistic support was quickly
forthcoming.

Harry Conroy finds aspiring popsters being kept on course for fame.
GORDON Campbell has been combining his interest in music with his
flair for accountancy ever since his student days at university. His
twin-track career began when, as an accountancy student, he played the
bass guitar in a band in his home town of Balloch.
The Upstarts was a teeny punk band and although they made several
television appearances, and signed a record deal, it never made the
break through into the big time.
Despite the band's lack of success, it was Gordon's launch pad into
the music industry. He was the only member of The Upstarts who could
drive, which eventually led him to managing the band's affairs, and his
interest in the business side of the music industry had begun.
Gordon now runs a course in music business administration at West
Lothian College, which he combines with writing pop songs in his spare
time and running his own Honey Records label.
His interest in writing pop songs dates back to when he was signed up
by Rocket Music, Elton John's publishing company.
''A few of my songs have become hits,'' admits Gordon, ''and it is
great to earn money from something you enjoy doing but there have also
been a lot of misses''.
One of Gordon's biggest song writing successes was when he wrote
Because I Love You for Shakin' Stevens in 1986.
''It has become something of a standard in the Far East,'' laughs
Gordon, ''and recently I was in a Chinese restaurant in Glasgow when I
heard it on tape. The owner gave me the CD as a memento.''
His songwriting success has given Gordon a comfortable lifestyle but
the best advice he ever received, says Gordon was from an old hand in
the music business who told him -- ''If you ever make any money from
your song writing consider it a bonus.''
Gordon took this advice to heart and says: ''I am not rich at all but
I am comfortable because I have always been in full-time employment.''
That employment has, for the last eight years, been the course
director of the HNC Music Business Administration course at West Lothian
College.
Providing training in business administration for the music industry
was Gordon's idea, and West Lothian College was the first UK further
educational establishment to offer such a course.
''In the music business you have to get the balance right between
creativity and professionalism. Our students are here to learn about the
business side of the industry, and not the performing side,'' he
explains.
At present there are 17 students on the one-year course, and most of
them can expect to find jobs in the industry, although mainly in the
South.
''We could take on 150 students,'' says Gordon, ''but we want to give
realistic training with a good prospect of a job at the end of it. Once
they successfully complete the course, our students have a 90% chance of
finding a job in the industry. It may be as little more than a tea boy
but the important thing is that they have their foot in the door.''
West Lothian College has gone into the record business to provide
students on the course with realistic training. The college has its own
record label Different Class Records and every year students on the
course have to produce a record.
''The students have to find an artist to record,'' says Gordon, ''then
they have to hire a studio to record the tracks, make the record and
market it''.
Gordon also runs his own label, Honey Records, which he aims to
develop as Scotland's pop label. Towards this end, he has signed up a
singer Julienne Taylor to bring out a single this summer.
Five years ago Gordon prepared a report on the business needs of the
music industry in Scotland and recently, with support from a London West
End firm of chartered accountants, Casson Beckman, he prepared a report
into the future of the UK Music Industry as we approach the next
century.
In his Music 2000 report, Gordon had the music industry moguls agog
when he suggested that the UK singles chart should be compiled
differently.
''There is no reason why, just because a chart is compiled weekly, it
should be based on weekly sales,'' says the report.
Instead of counting weekly sales Gordon suggested that a record's
position in the charts should be determined by its overall ''modern
sales''.
The report stated: ''Modern sales of the record could be a period
deemed by the industry as the average life of a single in the top 40,
which for the purpose of this report is say, 4 weeks. Once a single
exceeds its number of weeks upon which sales are based, it loses the
first week sales and gains the most recent. Hence the term modern
life.''
Gordon believes that a viable music industry could be established in
Scotland but says: ''If we are to be successful, although the industry
could be based here, it would have to look outward at the world
market.''

Chicago, Wednesday -- The Encyclopaedia Britannica, which survived the
American Revolution and the Industrial Revolution, is having trouble
with the electronic revolution.
The publisher of the oldest English-language encyclopaedia said it
needs an infusion of cash for the 226-year-old reference work or it may
have to be sold.
''Technology and the Information Age have radically transformed our
landscape and will require our company to make a significant transition
from our historical past,'' Britannica said. ''To continue to grow and
develop our business, we must reinvest. We need capital and are
confident we can secure it.''
The encyclopaedia is published by the William Benton Foundation, a
trust for which the University of Chicago is beneficiary.
''Our goal is to preserve Encyclopaedia Britannica as an institution
and to continue to develop new products and explore alternative sales
channels,'' the statement said.
''By identifying additional sources of capital, whether in the form of
joint-venture partners, outside investors or even a new owner, we'll
have the resources necessary to reach that goal and remain the world's
premier provider of information,'' it added.
Britannica has not shown a profit since 1990, in part because it
continued to publish sets of leather-bound, gold-edged books selling for
$1500 or more at a time when other encyclopaedias have converted to
cheaper multimedia CD-ROMs for personal computers.
Britannica did begin selling an electronic version recently but at a
price far higher than any of its competitors.
Personal computers with CD-ROM capability are frequently sold with
pre-installed encyclopaedias such as Encarta and Compton's. They and
other reference works can also be accessed through various online
services. -- Reuter.

GLASGOW-based Weir Pumps is mounting an assault on North America,
through the creation of its first sales office in the US.
The Weir Group division, which has a strong sales record in the UK,
Middle East and Far East, hopes to seize upon opportunities in the
power, oil and water and sewerage sectors.
Weir Group's latest move ties in with its decision five years ago to
target the Americas.
Taken together, North and South America, which are major pump and
valve markets, now account for 20% of total business.
The establishment of a US sales base for Weir Pumps follows hard on
the heels of the Cathcart-based group's #136m acquisition, in September,
of Salt Lake City-based EnviroTech Pumpsystems.
Dougie Abbott, who has built up Weir Pumps' North Sea oil business
from Aberdeen during the last seven years, will move to the US sales
office this month.
The facility will be set up at the headquarters of the subsidiary's
sister pump-maker, Weir Floway, in Fresno, California.
Mr Abbott said: ''About 60% of the company's business comes from
overseas. This move should raise that figure, as well as increase our
range of products in the States.''
Although being set up to raise Weir Pumps' profile in the US, the
sales office will work hand-in-hand with the group's two US pump-makers
in attacking new business opportunities.
The addition of EnviroTech has already generated inquiries, which Weir
Pumps now hopes to turn into orders.
Weir Group is also looking to boost its reputation and market share in
China, India and South America, through the development of its sales
network.

THE next meeting between the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth
Clarke, and the Governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George, is to be
held on May 5, the day after the local elections in England and Wales.
This strengthened speculation in the City that interest rates could
rise next month after indications that the two men had apparently
decided to hold their fire at yesterday's meeting.
The Bank of England left established rates unchanged in its money
market operations at midday, but the meeting was a long one, suggesting
to some nervous traders that there might not have been time to signal
the markets that base rates were to rise.
Most City pundits had expected the Governor and the Chancellor to
leave interest rates on hold. In its report to the meeting the Treasury
noted that the monthly indicators were consistent with a modest slowdown
in growth to a more sustainable rate.
But there was also concern about the continued strong growth in input
prices, now being fuelled by sterling's persistent weakness.
Interest rates were last raised in February from 6.25% to 6.75% when
the decision was implemented immediately after the meeting. The previous
rise was in December when the meeting was brought forward so that the
Bank could signal the markets in its morning money market operations.
In September, when rates were increased for the first time since the
recession ended, there was a delay because the Chancellor asked for time
to consider the Governor's advice.
The Chancellor has the final say on rates, but once a change has been
agreed the timing is up to the Governor. The trend both here and in the
US has been to inform the markets as soon as possible after a change in
policy has been decided.
Monetary meetings are usually held in the middle of the first week of
the month. The Bank of England's quarterly inflation report is due to be
published on Thursday May 11, but its conclusions on the outlook for
inflation will be known to the key players the week before.
By then the March figures for retail sales, unemployment, and
inflation will have been published, and on April 25 the Central
Statistical Office will have had its first stab at estimating first
quarter gross domestic product. The CBI's next quarterly trends survey,
which is closely monitored by the Bank of England, is due on the same
day.
All the pieces of the jigsaw will be in place in time for the meeting
on May 5. The decline in the pound since the start of the year is the
equivalent to lopping 1% off interest rates.
It is adding to inflationary pressures by pushing up import prices and
could stimulate activity by boosting the competitiveness of British
industry.
Most economists expect rates to be increased at some point in the
second quarter with May the most widely tipped date. Almost no one
expects 6.75% to be the peak in the interest-rate cycle.
A rate rise on May 5 would have the additional benefit of supporting
sterling, which would be likely to lose ground in the immediate
aftermath of a widely expected disaster for the Conservatives in the
English and Welsh local elections.
Foreign exchange dealers were nervous yesterday ahead of today's
voting in Scotland. There was talk in the City that the Conservatives
would retain control of only one council. Even this might prove an
overestimate.
James Capel's Adam Cole said that the Scottish results would have to
be worse than expected for the pound to suffer.

TIMOTHY Laing has had two high-flying careers. First he was a
helicopter pilot -- he flew for and was a shareholding owner of a
helicopter company which he subsequently merged with the very successful
PLM helicopters. Now he is managing director of The Phone Box Limited,
based in Inverkeithing, which has taken off as dramatically as any
helicopter.
It began modestly enough in 1983, when its parent company, Cairntech
Limited was established. This was originally founded as a business
start-up scheme which, with the backing of the Scottish Development
Agency, manufactured scramblers for North Sea fishermen who wanted to
communicate by radio-telephone without letting their competitors know
the whereabouts of valuable shoals of fish.
But it was in 1992 that the countdown to take-off really began in
earnest. In order to make the most of its expertise in telephony
technology, Cairntech established a subsidiary -- The Phone Box.
Since then the company's fortunes have risen meteorically as it
launched itself into related telecommunications spheres. By last
November, December and January, the turnover was reaching #1.25m a month
-- this figure being greater than the whole total turnover of the last
three years; and the company now supplies some 40,000 combined digital
telephone and answering machines a month to British Telecom.
But this is only the beginning. In April the first consignment of
these compact, tapeless telephone answering machines is shipped to Eire
for Telecom Eireann; thereafter an entirely new product, a state of the
art, top-of-the-range telephone answering machine is being launched for
BT; and meantime the company is actively pursuing the rest of the vast
European telephone market -- it is presently concluding a deal with a
major customer in France; and it is investigating the huge markets of
the US and South Africa.
The explanation for the Phone Box's trailblazing achievement lies in
two main areas: the dedication and skill of the company's team of
electronics and telephone engineers; and the single-minded and
determined efforts of Laing and his company to produce a marketable
product which would be competitive in terms of design, reliability and
price. All the more excellent to know that their success has been
entirely achieved in Scotland.
These digital answerphones are a thoroughly Scottish product, the only
telephone answering machines to be designed and made in Britain.
The Phone Box contracts out their manufacture to Hughes
Microelectronics in Glenrothes -- last year the latter produced 300,000
instruments for The Phone Box, this figure being three times the
originally forecast total demand from British Telecom.
It was about 1988 that the foundations for the company's present
spectacular success were laid. Until then it had been small, producing
point to point radio communcations systems for fishermen, the Ministry
of Defence and the police. But its team of skilled electronic and
telephone engineers wanted to advance their expertise and diversity.
Consequently, in 1992 they had developed a telephone answering machine
using digital, as opposed to analogue, recording methods. Because its
storing memory is digitised, there are no moving parts; and therefore
the machine is more reliable as well as being more compact. In addition,
of course, there is no need for tape re-winding.
The next step was to take the idea to British Telecom. Here Laing's
patience and dedication was crucial: getting into BT was tough.
Certainly The Phone Box was at the right place at the right time;
nonetheless, breaking into this market needed perseverence and hard
work. It took a year to organise all the details of design, components,
materials and price and so on.
Laing was determined that the whole thing should be done in Scotland.
And his insistence that the Phone Box's machine should be competitive as
well as first class in terms of design has meant that the company has a
highly marketable product which is now not only sold through British
Telecom outlets, but also by Dixons, Argos and so on.
As the upward thrust of the company increases its momentum, managing
director Laing thoroughoy enjoys his hot-seat pilot role. The comparison
with his helicopter days is not a mere metaphor: being managing director
of a trail-blazing Scottish company is, he says, just like being a
helicopter pilot. In both cases being able to attend urgently to five
different and demanding matters at the same moment is absolutely vital.

IT is most unusual nowadays, when so many of the food products that
are sold in supermarkets are automatically mass-produced, to come across
a company whose employees make all of its food and food-related goods by
hand.
Such a company is Hawkins Foods, a firm which since its formation in
1986 has been based in the Motherwell Food Park, which has since then
grown to have an annual turnover of some #150,000, and whose business
plans envisage continuing expansion.
The business is owned and run by the Mahomed family, who had come to
this country from their native Zambia some eight years ago, and the
reason for the choice of the corporate name is, said Sophie Mahomed, one
of the company's owners and managers, that her father dealt with
missionaries in that country, the name of one of these missionaries
being Paul Hawkins, and so, in Ms Mahomed's words, ''we just kept the
name''.
''We came here,'' she continues, ''and we were looking for a business
to start up. My sister Rashina is a talented cook and we discovered
that, as far as we were concerned, the food market was the best
market.'' When the business started, it looked at selling to
delicatessens. At first, the Mahomeds thought that people were simply
''being nice to them'' and that repeat orders would be difficult to
achieve. Such was not the case. In the beginning, the Mahomeds had to
knock on the proverbial doors but, says Ms Mahomed, ''we don't need to
knock on doors now''.
Repeat orders have therefore materialised and a further breakthrough
came when the company was featured on the BBC's Good Food Show.
Additional recognition was gained from the company's participation in
the International Food Exhibition at Earls Court.
All of the menus which Hawkins Foods uses are traditional. In all
cases, fresh fruit and vegetables are used. Its products are sold under
the logo of Rudyard -- a throwback to the days of Empire? -- and a
further breakthrough as far as the increase in its sales was concerned
was the fact that the company was sucessful in persuading Sainsburys to
market its goods.
In Ms Mahomed's words, ''a technologist from that company came to see
us and liked what she saw''. And Ms Mahomed herself will be visiting
that supermarket giant early in the New Year to discuss suitable
extensions to the Hawkins range of products.
One matter on which the company lays great stress is the fact that its
production lines are completely non-mechanised. All the chopping, all
the peeling, all the filling is done by hand. This ensures that
everything that is manufactured results in a quality product. No
preservatives or additives are incorporated in the goods.
Spices and herbs are specially shipped in to the Motherwell Food Park
from the traditional growers in India, Pakistan, and Southern Africa.
The resulting products include lime pickle, vegetable pickle, spiced
pickled garlic, peach and raisin chutney, apricot and almond chutney,
orange and date chutney, pineapple chutney, tomato sauce chutney, sweet
tomato chutney, and red pepper chutney.
All these are for use with accompanying meat and poultry, vegetarian
dishes, curries, and popadoms.
Like many of the other companies in the Motherwell Food Park, Hawkins
serves the UK market and, also like many of its geographical neighbours
in the Park, it seems to be set fair for continuing expansion.

GOVAN businessman, John McLaughlin, managing director, and chairman,
of Skylight International has created commemorative chairs by the dozen
-- everything from a seat of learning for Frank Pignatelli,
Strathclyde's director of education, to a maritime throne of Neptune for
the commander of HMS Glasgow.
But what few people know, is that, behind the scenes of Skylight
International, life, for John is one big carve-up.
For he welcomes guests to his factory by asking them to sign his
visitor's book -- and it's no ordinary piece of office stationery.
''It's what I call my 'walk-in' visitor's book,'' smiles John. ''It's
over six-feet tall and folds out to be about six-feet wide. No one can
walk past that!''
It's made, like all John's wooden masterpieces, from nothing more or
less than scrap wood used for boarding up broken windows before his firm
fits one of its patented, vandal-proof skylights.
''I'm working on a new chair for someone very important who will take
up office in Glasgow in the near future,'' confided John, as he drew the
basics of his new design for Look Up To Glasgow on a sheet of wood.
''The theme is very much St Mungo and the fact that we should all look
up to Glagow. But I can't reveal who it's for right now. Let's just say
it's someone whom we'll all be looking up to when we know who that is!''
he smiled.
But where does he actually like to put his feet ups? ''Simple,''
replied the woodsman from Govan. ''I like nothing better than to get
behind my desk.''
Naturally, John carved it himself out of scrap wood, rescued from an
old church in Dunfermline.
''Maybe it's the fact that it all came from a church, or that I relax
from the pressures of business through carving.
''But the desk calms me down. I can only recommend my approach to
anyone who wants to chip away at stress.''

THE imminent retirement of Sir Matthew Goodwin as chairman of Hewden
Stuart will see the departure of the giant of the plant hire industry
which otherwise would have been in a more parlous state than it is but
for the standards he set and which some others have tried to emulate.
Since he joined the company with now non-executive director Ronnie
Stuart, attention to cash and paying down debt have been strict
guidelines. He has been guided by finance director Alastair Deakin in
recent years.
To the City, his style of presentation has always been discursive and
opinionated, almost always with an underlying sense of humour but also
the occasional flash of temper when a silly question is asked.
Yesterday he said he had gained most pleasure from seeing what effect
Hewden has had on so many people -- ''especially young lads coming to
drive a machine and now owning their own house and bringing up their
families.''
Rather surprisingly, he believes his greatest strategic achievement
has been comparatively recent. That was in the summer of 1993 when he
overrode depot managers and insisted they invested when they did not
want to buy new plant because of low demand.
This decision has resulted in ever greater dominance of the quality
end of the UK hire plant industry with the benefits still to come
through in volume.
He will now spend more time on his farm, particularly planting trees,
and with his many grandchildren as well as helping a couple of charities
and as a non-executive director of Crestacare.

BARCLAYS chief executive Martin Taylor received #710,000 in emoluments
last year including a #169,000 bonus for 1994 and #30,000 as a long-term
share scheme payment.
His basic salary of #500,000 exceeds that of chairman Andrew Buxton at
#350,000 who ended the year 19% better off at #523,000.
Overall boardroom costs fell #821,000 to #3,729,000 because of the
pain experienced by David Band, who is executive director of the BZW
securities division. He suffered a pay cut of #639,000 although he still
remained top of the pile with remuneration totalling #776,000.
BZW profits fell in 1994 from #532m to #242m although the Barclays
group overall increased its total from #661m to #1859m.
Barclays is offering the majority of its staff a basic 2.75% which
rises to 5% for most when one-off performance bonuses are included. They
are also getting a 7.5% one-off profit share equivalent to just under
#870 on average.
* SHAREHOLDERS are receiving the biggest and weightiest annual report
ever published by a British company. It runs to 159 pages as it includes
the US Form 20-F which is the American accounts presentation
requirement. That has been introduced at the request of former financial
journalist Martin Taylor ''in the interests of harmonising international
reporting''.
As a preface to the full report, shareholders also have to read the
44-page annual review and financial summary. With almost 135,000
shareholders on the share register, Barclays is sending out some 118
tonnes of paper with each receiving documentation weighing 4lb -- no
wonder paper prices are rising.

FRANK Bruno, Nigel Benn, and Naseem Hamed are to form the centre-piece
of British boxing's biggest-ever television deal.
That top fighting trio and all the boxers under Frank Warren's
promotion have switched from ITV to Sky in a two-year multi-million
pound deal, and Mike Tyson looks almost certain to be a part of it.
Warren is Don King's partner and the structure is there to feature
Tyson's comeback bouts.
Sky chiefs will not divulge the actual figures, but it is believed to
rival the satellite company's contract with FA Premiership football,
which runs at around #50m a year. It seems the actual figure will depend
on Tyson's involvement in the package.
Warren, who had dealt with ITV for 14 years, asked Sky to quote a
price -- it matched up to his valuation and the deal was accepted.
It seems sure to bring closer a third contest between World Boing
Council super-middleweight champion Benn and Chris Eubank, who is also
involved in a Sky package and will have a 10-round comeback against
former World Boxing Association holder Steve Little at the Kings Hall,
Belfast, on May 27.
Sky's coup obviously leaves ITV and BBC with fewer big names to
screen.
Warren said: ''It's very exciting. I had a very good association with
ITV. The deal was done in less than 24 hours. An approach was made, a
meeting was set up, and everything was agreed.
''I believe we have put on some of the classics in British boxing in
recent years and aim to continue that standard.''
With Barry Hearn promoting matches for Sky via Eubank and Herbie Hide,
there will now be competition within the satellite station's boxing
coverage.
One big item on the Sky agenda is set to be Bruno's fourth crack at
the world heavyweight title.
Warren has pledged to deliver the winner of Saturday's WBC title
meeting between Oliver McCall and the veteran Larry Holmes in Las Vegas
-- and Warren is currently negotiating the hire of a London football
ground in July to stage it.
The deal starts with Robbie Regan's challenge against Alberto Jimenez
for the World Boxing Organisation flyweight title in Cardiff on April
22.
Next comes Hamed's WBC international super-bantamweight championship
fight against Enrique Angeles at Shepton Mallett on May 6.
Bruno against Ray Anis in Glasgow on May 13 and Steve Robinson's next
WBO featherweight title defence against Fabrizio Cappai in Cardiff on
June 10 completes the opening quartet of contests.
Sky executives pointed out that they would continue to work with all
boxing promoters, but have given Warren the extra latitude to feature
up-and-coming fighters for the future.
Vic Wakeling, head of Sky TV Sport said: ''With Tyson out, Hamed on
the brink, and Bruno getting ready for another shot at the title,
everything fell into place.''

A CHILLING, worrying situation lurks behind the prediction that
Scotland's unemployment rate will soon be at its lowest level since the
late 1970s, according to the influential Fraser of Allander Institute.
Senior forecaster Jim Stevens warned yesterday that the 7.7% rate
anticipated in 1997 will not present a true picture of economic strength
-- because the labour market will still be ''very weak'' when compared
with growth in the economy at large.
The Strathclyde University-based institute expects total employment to
increase by up to 21,900 jobs a year -- less than 1%, despite annual GDP
growth of around 3.5%. In other words, the recovery from recession will
not be matched by a similar rise in jobs.
Mr Stevens warned that if Scotland is unable to boost employment at a
time of strong economic performance, it never will.
He suspected the likely downturn in unemployment, from 8.3% this year
to 7.7% in 1997, will be due more to population falls -- and significant
shifts toward female, part-time, and low-quality jobs -- rather than any
positive growth in work arising from the recovery.
Mr Stevens described such a scenario as chilling and worrying. He
feared politicians in particular may interpret the ongoing fall in
unemployment as a sign that the Scottish economy is far healthier that
it really was.
He called on all political parties to acknowledge ''the falls in
unemployment do not mean that it does not remain an acute problem.''
In presenting the institute's latest Quarterly Economic Commentary, Mr
Stevens warned Scotland will struggle to obtain Government resources
unless it is accepted that unemployment can fall despite ''positive jobs
growth'' being small.
He was adamant that cuts in jobless figures were due in part to people
who have never worked or been unemployed -- including housewives --
taking jobs that people on the unemployment register did not compete
for.
He also urged the Government to improve methods of analysing job
trends because markedly different pictures are being produced to explain
why unemployment is falling.
The institute was more upbeat on output, claiming that Scotland's
narrow-based manufacturing and production recovery is becoming more
widespread. However, it warned the continued reliance on electronics for
much of the growth remains a cause for concern.
The commentary suggested growth since the recession hit bottom in 1992
is not as favourable as it would appear. If the electronics sector's
contribution was removed, production output has actually fallen by 8%
and manufacturing output has dropped by 6.6%.
However, there are signs of positive growth in sectors such as metals,
food and tobacco, drink, textiles, clothing, and footwear, but the
institute warned: ''The continuing reliance on electronics for much of
Scotland's growth remains a cause for concern.''
Officials are worried that any reliance on electronics only increases
the vulnerability of the economy to a downturn in that sector. Moreover,
they are concerned that electronics growth does not feed through to
domestic consumer demand or increased business for Scottish suppliers.
The commentary noted the continuing strong performance of both UK and
Scottish economies. But it warned there are strong indications that
medium-term job growth in Scotland will be ''considerably below'' growth
rates of output.

SCOTLAND's Paul Weir last night kept the dream alive when he made his
successful first defence of the WBO light-flyweight championship of the
world in his home town of Irvine.
The 27-year-old, a 7st 10lb bundle of energy and class,
comprehensively outpointed Renato ''Ric'' Magramo from the Philippines
-- and he had to box from the third round handicapped by a tendon injury
to the right hand.
''I had trouble with the hand before the fight,'' said the little
champion who now wants to chase the world flyweight crown. ''And when I
caught him with a right hook in the third round I felt it go again. But
he didn't give me any trouble and as I told him when he arrived in this
country, he wasn't going home with my title.''
Weir, who has won world titles at two weights, boxed cautiously at the
start and quickly found out that, for all Magramo's aggression, the
challenger was only hell-bent on making his name with one big punch.
That was never good enough. Weir continually speared Magramo with a
razor-sharp left jab and wore him down with telling rights to the body.
Long before the end of the 12 rounds it was obvious Magramo would have
to knock out the Scot and he just didn't have that kind of shot in his
armoury.
At the end of the contest the judges were unanimous in their decision
and even the challenger looked to have accepted his defeat before the
official announcement.
Said Weir afterwards: ''Before the fight I thought I could stop him
but the hand injury didn't help. However, this is the best time of my
life and I aim to make the most of it. I'll be back in the gym in 10
days' time and I'll leave it up to my manager Tommy Gilmour as to what
happens next.''
In the main supporting bout Willie ''The Mighty'' Quinn scored his
sixteenth win in the professional ranks with an overwhelming points
margin against Burnley's John Duckworth. Other results:
Welter -- Joe Townsley (Cleland) beat Brian Dunn (Hull) rsc third
round.
Light -- Mark Breslin (Barrhead) outpointed T J Smith (Kettering) six
rounds.
Super-feather -- Hugh Collins (Stirling) outpointed Kid McAuley
(Doncaster) six rounds.

ANDY Nicol, the ex-Dundee HS FP scrum half, is on the verge of
inclusion in Scotland's Rugby World Cup squad just 12 months after a
devastating knee injury almost ended his playing career, writes Derek
Douglas.
Nicol has played just two reserve games after an 11-month recuperation
period during which he underwent surgery on the anterior cruciate
ligament of his right knee.
In the squad released last night, the scrum halves are named as Bryan
Redpath and ''A N Other.'' This means that Nicol's fitness will be
monitored by the selectors.
The only other surprise in the World Cup party is the inclusion of
Tony Stanger as one of four designated wing-threequarters. Stanger,who
won 35 caps on the wing before deciding that his future lay at centre,
last played for Scotland against France last year.
However, coach Dougie Morgan said after the surprise release of the
squad, that Stanger was in the party as a centre/wing and that the
player was quite happy.
Morgan added: ''If we were going on a tour then we would be taking 30
players. It is very dificult to choose 26 players for a World Cup. The
selected squad gives us a degree of flexibility. Graham Shiel, for
instance, can play at stand-off or centre.''
The squad format highlights the players who have lost their race to be
fit in time for the tournament which runs from May 25-June 24. Prop Alan
Sharp, who has had recurrent back problems, could not be considered
because of injury, and neither could the Bath lock Andy Reed who, like
Sharp, has suffered from debilitating back trouble.
The inclusion of the Boroughmuir prop, Peter Wright, means that he has
recovered -- not that there was much doubt -- from the collarbone damage
sustained in the Grand Slam match against England. Similarly, Ian
Jardine is well on the mend from the cheek damage inflicted at Parc des
Princes.
Even more significantly, David Hilton, who sustained a sprung rib
cartilage in the Calcutta Cup game, has recovered in double-quick time
and the Northampton flanker Peter Walton is also back in the fray after
a knee injury.

The make-up of Scotland's Rugby World Cup squad made its public
appearance nearly 24 hours early after a clerical blip at the Scottish
Rugby Union's Murrayfield HQ. Details of the squad were faxed to
newspapers and the electronic media after what SRU chief executive, Bill
Hogg, referred to, with considerable restraint, as an unfortunate error.
The World Cup line-up was to have been kept confidential until a press

SCOTLAND'S 1990 Grand Slam coach, Ian McGeechan, now director of rugby
with Northampton, maintains that Rugby Football Union proposals to ban
or limit the number of Scottish, Irish, and Welsh exiles in English
league and cup competitions are a form of racial discrimination.
The RFU, concerned at what they view as a high number of ''non-England
qualified'' players appearing in top club sides south of the Border,
have had the issue under consideration since Christmas, and a decision
will be made by the full RFU committee at the end of the month.
If new regulations are brought in, then non-English players currently
involved with clubs in England -- including five members of Scotland's
Five Nations' Championship squad -- would not be affected.
However, any player who is considering a move to England -- even if he
has already signed provisional registration forms with an English club
for next season -- may find himself caught out if the RFU plans become
reality.
The injured Scotland centre, Gregor Townsend, and his Gala clubmate,
Mike Dods, have signed provisionally with Northampton for next season.
They are just two of a number of Scottish players who are rumoured to be
considering moves south.
From Scotland's Five Nations' squad, David Hilton and Eric Peters,
both with Bath, Derrick Patterson and Rob Wainwright (West Hartlepool),
and Iain Morrison (London Scottish) all play their club rugby south of
the Border. It has long been a source of grievance with Twickenham
administrators that Scots and other home union exiles benefit from the
highly competitive English club scene.
McGeechan said yesterday: ''So far as I understand it, there have been
no decisions taken. The discussion isn't taking place within the clubs,
it is at RFU level.
''I would think that most clubs would be very strongly opposed to it.
Maybe the feeling at Twickenham is that they don't want the English
leagues to benefit the international competition. I don't see how they
could possibly exclude people. I would have thought that it would be
against the law. It is almost racial discrimination, isn't it?''
John Jeavons-Fellows, chairman of the RFU competitions' committee
which has prepared a report for the Twickenham hierarchy, said: ''It has
to go to our executive and then to the full committee at the end of
April. No decisions have yet been reached.
''The issue is one of the increasing number of non-English qualified
players who are appearing in domestic English league and cup
competitions. The possible solution to what we consider to be a problem
is some form of legislation, which could range from a total ban to
limiting the numbers.
''The Irish already have a system such as this in operation. They say
only one non-Irish qualified player per club is allowed in domestic
competitions. We may be looking for a similar ratio in English rugby.
''Please remember that we already have London Scottish, London Welsh,
and London Irish playing in our domestic competitions. There are regular
complaints that we should kick them out of English club competitions,
but we have not yet got to that stage.
''I would not have thought that this was racial discrimination. In
fact, I would have thought that the charge of racial discrimination
could not be upheld.
''There is a divergence of opinion within our committee and so I don't
know what the final decision will be. There are some who would have some
non-English players and some who would have none.
''This is not anti-Scottish, Irish, or Welsh. It is pro-English. At
the moment, the management of the England national side are looking at
club games, but it's often a waste of time, because a quarter of the
players aren't qualified to play for England.
The RFU president, Dennis Easby, added: ''I don't believe that what is
being discussed is a total ban. The discussion document speaks about
limiting the numbers to one, two, or three. The notion that this would
amount to racial discrimination is a novel one. Everything that we do
these days seems to be against some law or other.
''My immediate reaction, and this is a personal view, is that if
Scottish, Welsh, and Irish exiles are excluded from our league
competition, then that could have a down-side.
''We want our England players to be playing at the very top level. If
you exclude the exiles then you would end up with a competition which is
not being played at that kind of level.
''My view is that exiles do a tremendous amount of good for the Rugby
Football Union, and I would be very sad indeed to see them excluded.''
Scottish Rugby Union secretary, Bill Hogg, said last night: ''I would
be most surprised if the RFU took a decision to ban or limit the number
of Scottish, Welsh, and Irish players in the English game.
''It can only benefit English rugby to have all those top-class exiles
playing down there. If someone is a member of an English club then he
should be allowed to play in the English leagues.''

GLASGOW-based Clydeport, which floated on the stock market in
December, yesterday unveiled a 70% hike in 1994 pre-exceptional profits
to #4.17m.
This pre-tax earnings figure, for the year to December 31, beat the
#4.1m forecast which Clydeport made for the benefit of potential
investors back in November.
Shares in the ports operator, which leapt 18p from their 133p placing
price when they made their debut on December 8, have continued to
perform well during the intervening four months.
Yesterday, they put on another 2p to 173p, further boosting the
lucrative shareholdings of chairman John Mather and managing director
David Hunt, which are capped at 6.8% of issued capital.
Clydeport, formed three years ago through the management and employee
buy-out of the activities of the former Clyde Port Authority public
trust, announced a final dividend of 1p.
This was in line with the full-year notional dividend of 3.51p
indicated at the time of flotation.
Mr Mather, who received most of the flak from critics about the
handsome transformation of his original #75,000 investment, picked up a
taxable #1.6m from shares sold on flotation.
His residual 6.8% shareholding, valued at #3.73m at the placing price
of 133p, is now worth #4.86m.
Turnover was up 34% at #15.9m, largely because of a full year's
contribution from its interests at the Hunterston bulk terminal,
acquired from British Steel in October 1993.
Hunterston, which handles imported coal from Russia, Indonesia,
Australia and Columbia, which is subsequently shipped out to
Scandinavia, France, Spain, the Isle of Man, the Thames and Northern
Ireland, accounted for more than 35% of total revenue.
In total, Clydeport handled 3.9 million tonnes of dry bulk during
1994, more than double the 1.7 million tonnes of the previous year.
The profit figure of #4.17m does not include an exceptional gain of
#1.45m on the #11m sale in September of land at Braehead, Glasgow, to
retail giants Marks &amp; Spencer and Sainsbury.
Mr Mather said the current year had started promisingly, with an
increase in customers and tonnages at the company's ports, located at
Hunterston, Greenock, Glasgow and Ardrossan.
He added that the group's strong trading and cash position would
enable it to develop existing assets and consider opportunities relating
to private wharfs or joint ventures, not necessarily in Scotland.
However, Mr Mather also highlighted the volatile and competitive
nature of the business.
He put Clydeport's strong share price performance down to the fact
that the City had received what it was promised in November. The
strength of the sector as a whole has also lent support.

LAIRD has joined the growing number of British industrial companies
with high overseas exposure which are experiencing the ''feel-good''
factor, writes ANDREW WILSON.
After achieving record operating profits last year, up 21% to #54.2m,
chairman John Gardiner said that the current year has started well with
substantial opportunities ahead.
That has been backed up by chief executive Ian Arnott who pointed to
three projects coming onstream in volume in 1995. These are the Draftex
body-seal plant in Spain supplying the VW Polo, seals for Skoda in the
Czech Republic and the expansion of the Fullarton computer component
operations in North Carolina. Together they should make a quite
significant contribution.
Overall group pre-tax profits jumped 44% to #47.7m, after excluding a
#5.1m credit in 1993 on patent litigation, on turnover almost 18% higher
at #734m.
The biggest improvement came in industrial products which includes
automotive components as distinct from body seals because of the
strength of the recovery in the French small car industry and in
specialised building components.
Fullarton in Kilwinning made up for slow IBM demand for PC equipment
through increased sales to Compaq and other manufacturers -- the plant
now employs about 1600 people.
Some 75% of profits were generated overseas with Europe about half the
total business and so should help maintain growth in the current year.
That should allow pre-tax profits to scrape the #60m level with progress
thereafter underpinned by the hefty #160m capital investment programme
of the last five years with #38m alone in 1994.
Thanks to last November's #68m rights issue, there is a net cash
position although the dilutive effect will mean little improvement in
earnings per share this time round.
At 344p, Laird is trading at 13 times likely earnings which is
marginally cheap for a company which should show dynamic growth in 1996.
The dividend total has been raised 5.6% to 11.3p with a 6.9p final for a
4.1% yield.

YOUR report of the situation at present in Barlinnie and Porterfield
prisons reflected justified concern at the shortage of secure
accommodation for 14-year-olds on remand, but conditions in the
Inverness prison these days make your reference to its ''grim
reputation'' irrelevant and misleading (March 30).
As minister of the local parish I know it from the inside as well as
having heard from different sources explanations of its policies and
practices.
The infamous ''cages'' are gone; close attention is given to
prisoners' morale during their sentences and their readiness for life in
future; work, education, and fitness opportunities are emphasised;
pastoral and spiritual help is given by a varied group of chaplains, of
whom I am not one; and fruitful links are being forged between the
prison and surrounding communities -- all this in a serious endeavour to
implement the commitment given in the mission statement of the prison
service to preserve ''humanity.''
It is not right that a 14-year-old boy should have to be in prison,
but the impression you give of his environment in Porterfield today is
wrong.

THE lack of debate on devolution, as you cynically point out in the
editorial of March 28, has been abysmal. I have not seen one article
describing how this miracle will be managed or supported.
The relationship with local government, salaries or representatives,
how many civil servants in addition to the present Scottish Office will
be required; these and a host of other questions need answers and none
are given.
Vague claims of no more than a 3p swing on Income Tax are offered
without any substantive figures.
As for Professor Neil Hood -- a self-confessed SNP member -- in his
short term and blinkered study he did not look at all at what happened
to the financial structures in Montreal in the 1970s.
Quebec suffered a flight of capital out of the province which was
terrifying. Millions of dollars were transferred out, mainly to Toronto
and Vancouver, leaving Montreal a shadow of its former vibrant self,
from which it has never recovered -- all this at the mere threat of
separation from Canada.
Obsessive chauvinism permeates the SNP and much of the thinking of
those who profess that devolution will be a good thing for Scotland.
Well, it wasn't a good thing for Quebec or Montreal.
Taxes are higher in Quebec than in any other province in Canada.
Xenophobia is prevalent even in school playgrounds (they have language
police) and a huge bureaucracy permeates every aspect of life.
Scotland, as portrayed by the SNP and your newspaper, is a whining
group of people, never satisfied with what they have, dreaming of a past
that never was. The Scots forget that they were a go-ahead people who
went all over the world, working hard to develop society wherever they
found themselves and never retreating into ghettos.
At the same time they were also an aggressive collection of clans
which could never agree on anything and I fear that that is what will
happen if we have a so-called devolved assembly.
It will be nothing more than a talk-shop for SNP and Labour members to
boost their egos, collect vast sums from the unsuspecting Scottish
taxpayer, and progress not one step towards making the future better for
Scotland.
It will also make Scotland the most over-governed country in Europe.
What we do need is for local government to be better and more
responsive.
What seems to be ignored completely is that Scotland, as part of the
United Kingdom, works better than it ever did or would as a separate
entity. The number of Scots who have gone to England and who have had
their children there are legion.
Some come back as I did, for I am Scottish, but thank God that does
not blind me to the fact that the English part of the United Kingdom is
as fair and just as Scotland and we Scots can benefit from the tolerance
of the English just as the English benefit from our aggression and from
our education system.

THE letter, Hidden policy (April 5), requires clarification. The
writer may have misunderstood my colleague as the East Dunbartonshire
Conservatives have a very well defined policy on education which, as the
candidate for the adjoining Lenzie ward, I have already passed on to the
school boards.
I have also had correspondence with the local Educational Institute of
Scotland, which incidentally refers to East Dumbartonshire, as in the
town of Dumbarton, not once but seven times in one short letter.
I note that, while criticising the Conservative candidate for stating
the obvious, that the future of education will be a matter for the new
council, the writer of the letter does not tell us if he got any answer
at all from the other parties with regard to their policy.

WEST of Scotland's Jan Woodley saw her reign as women's world indoor
champion come to and end in Cumbernauld yesterday, when she failed to
reach the quarter-finals of the Churchill Insurance-sponsored event
despite winning two of her three section matches.
Woodley struggled in her morning clash with Guernsey's Anne Simon,
losing 7-2, 7-5, but found her form to beat New Zealand's Marlene Castle
7-4, 0-7, 7-4.
However, with Simon beating Ireland's Mary Tosh 7-3, 7-5, that left
Woodley among the also-rans. The Scot, Castle and Simon all finished
with two wins from their three matches, but it was the Kiwi and the
Channel Islander who went through on sets differential.
That defeat left the Scottish challenge squarely on the shoulders of
Tweedbank's Joyce Lindores -- and she qualified for the quarter-finals
without dropping a set. Lindores, who had launched her challenge on
Tuesday by defeating Julie Davies, added a 7-4, 7-4 victory against
Jersey's Susan Noel and then beat English champion Brenda Brown 7-3,
7-4.
Also through to today's quarter-finals are former winners Margaret
Johnston and Mary Price.
Johnston scraped through her morning match 7-6 in the deciding set
against Guernsey's Carol Le Poidevin and then added a 7-2, 7-6 win over
Canada's Margaret Fettes. Johnston now meets Castle this morning.
Mary Price, fresh from last month's win in the British women's indoor
championship, beat Jersey's Val Stead 7-2, 7-6 and English compatriot
Maureen Monkton 3-7, 7-4, 7-1. Price lines up against Wales' Julie
Davies, while Stead, who took second place in the section, faces
Lindores. Ireland's Pat Smyth completes the last eight line-up against
Simon.

ALISON Sheppard, City of Glasgow's double Olympian, was among the
Scots lambasted by meet organiser Wally Lord yesterday for their failure
to enter the Edinburgh World Challenge at the Commonwealth Pool next
Friday.
Fraser Walker, Euan Stewart, and Richard Hope are the only leading
names who have confirmed their presence in an event that has attracted
world-class competitors from 19 nations.
''I can't believe that the Scottish swimmers are not taking the chance
to compete against the best in the world,'' said Lord. ''We have had
trouble in the past getting Scots to take part, but I had hoped the
situation had changed following recent alterations in the set-up of
Scottish swimming.
''I have spoken to Martyn Woodroffe (Scotland's director of swimming)
and the hope is that he can persuade a few more to change their minds.
But it is disappointing if they do turn down this opportunity.''
Angela Pendrich, Nicola Steel, and Katy Burke joined Sheppard on
Lord's list of noted absentees, and he is even more perplexed
considering that they will all be in Edinburgh to compete for Scotland
in the multi-nations tournament the following two days.
''They can't even complain about the number of swims,'' Lord
continued. ''Overall, the challenge plus the multi-nations will still
amount to less than a regular meet.''
While many of the Scots may be ignoring the event, the world-class
names continue to flow in, with Hungary's double world champion, Norbert
Rosza, the latest to join the list.
Having pipped Adrian Moorhouse for the 100 metres breast-stroke title
at the 1991 world championships, Rosza then went on to complete the
breast-stroke double at the same event in Rome last year. The first and
only other swimmer to achieve a similar feat was Scotland's David
Wilkie.

A WORLD Bank conference in Glasgow yesterday attracted double the
number of firms initially expected by the organisers, Scottish Trade
International.
Peter Watson, a division chief from the bank's Washington, DC,
headquarters, and himself a Scot, said this indicated that Scottish
business was interested in grasping new overseas opportunities.
STI staged the one-day conference to show companies how best to
capitalise on important new World Bank funds for projects. More than 80
firms from Scotland and elsewhere in the UK attended the procurement
seminar.
Mr Watson said: ''STI has received such a large turnout here today.
This shows the interest is right, the time seems to be now right and
Scottish business is perhaps taking a more outward look towards what is
available.''
Companies were advised on how to obtain an estimated #10bn annually
through the bank -- the largest global financial provider to what it
describes as developing countries.
David Taylor, STI director, said he was delighted at the turnout and
added: ''Significant export opportunities exist through the World Bank
together with our own World aid programmes.''
STI, the principal export development agency in Scotland, plans to
visit the World Bank soon to consolidate relationships between Scottish
business and the bank.

OIL prices hit a five-month high yesterday as US demand for scarce
cleaner, greener reformulated gasoline (RFG) drove the market up.
Brent crude, the benchmark for most of the world's trade, jumped to a
peak of $18.20 a barrel for May on the London futures market, the
highest since November last year.
US Energy Department data released yesterday showed stocks of RFG fell
by 3.9 million barrels over the week, sparking a rush to buy oil futures
on the London market ahead of the start of trade in New York.

SIR Matthew Goodwin is bringing his era to an end at Hewden-Stuart and
will pass over his role as executive chairman into the extremely capable
hands of Sandy Findlay, his lieutenant since 1969, at the annual
meeting.
This was revealed yesterday as Britain's most successful plant hire
company disclosed pre-tax profits soaring 82% to #34.8m. Encouragingly,
the momentum accelerated as the year progressed, rising from the interim
77% increase to 87% in the six months to end January.
The results were appreciably above most market expectations and the
shares rose 6p to 169p.
There is for the 47th time an increase in the dividend, with a final
of 2.5p to boost the total 14.7% to 3.325p, covered more than three
times by earnings for a 2.5% yield.
There is also a one-for-five scrip issue, the 12th since the company
was floated in 1968. If one had bought #1000 of shares at that time, the
investment would now be worth #38,000, while the annual dividend income
would be around #1000.
Hewden-Stuart is understandably a legend in the construction industry,
partly because of its extremely conservative accounting policies and
refusal to follow fashion trends. This reflects its early history of
having to chase debts, pay close attention to cash flow and have a
policy of holding enough cash now to pay wages in 12 months time. It has
resulted in Hewden having the most modern plant certainly in Britain and
probably in Europe.
Sir Matthew's policy is always to write-off six months depreciation
the moment an item is delivered, and all transactions are for cash which
helps the negotiating position with suppliers.
In August 1993, he prevailed upon the board to reverse its long-time
strategy of approving depot managers' requests for new equipment and
instead ordered them to invest heavily. That was despite the
construction industry being flat, and over the last two years Hewden has
spent a total of more than #110m including #66m last year -- a similar
sum is planned for 1995.
One advantage is that it is now receiving delivery of MAN Wolff tower
cranes bought at a time when the exchange rate was DM2.50 compared with
DM2.20 or so at present which would make them uneconomic to purchase
now.
Sir Matthew complained that industrialists in Britain are not putting
down new capacity, warning: ''If we do not, we will run into problems.''
Hewden's cash flow has been such that debt is below #1m compared with
shareholder funds of #150m.
The benefits of the heavy investment policy are now emerging in
several directions. One is simply that having new plant means higher
rates can be charged -- overall they rose between 2% and 10% -- and it
is also more economical to run. And industries such as petrochemicals
which are beset with ever tighter safety regulations place quality above
cost.
Additionally, the UK plant hire base is being run down as competitors
as well as Hewden export older equipment, particularly to Continental
Europe and the Far East with low sterling an attraction for buyers. This
activity brought in #5.4m profit last year for the company on turnover
of #14m.
Overall turnover rose 30% to #260m with merchanting up 24% to #92m.
That remains a very low margin activity with profits of just #2.9m.
There has been a dramatic increase in the amount of JCB equipment
replacing Japanese and European imports as the British company
substantially increases its range and competitiveness.
Plant hire saw an improvement in the South of England, with both
volume and appreciable rate gains as momentum quickened.
In contrast, the North-east of Scotland was ''lamentably weak''
because of too much competition in the Aberdeen area due to firms from
the south fleeing north in the depths of recession to try take some of
the oil money.
Tower cranes showed the most dramatic rise, but this was from a very
low base. Huts and cabins were a sad story.
Some 17 new depots were opened, increasing the total to 307, while
there was gain of 200 in employee numbers to 3900.
Turnover in the current year has so far shown a healthy increase
reflecting the 15% rise in capacity in 1994. Although there is a note of
caution, particularly in housing related business, the outlook is for
profits to advance to about #41m, for the shares to trade at 13.7 times
likely earnings.
Most encouragingly for the future, Mr Findlay said he sees no need for
any change in strategy.

COLIN Montgomerie has not until now come to terms with the Masters
tournament or the challenge of the Augusta National Club's course. In 10
rounds spread over three appearances his lowest score is 70, two under
par. His first two finishes have been thirty-seventh and fifty-second
and last year he missed the cut, hardly a record to boast about.
Accordingly when, shortly after 2pm today (local time) Europe's No.1
golfer for the past two years sets out on the first round partnering Tom
Watson, he will adopt a new strategy.He said: ''Without being silly or
reckless, I intend to attack whenever I can, although I know the greens
will be as firm and the pin positions as exacting as ever.
''Until now I've given the course too much respect. Every player has
his comfort zone and I just wasn't comfortable being under par. If I
made a birdie I'd throw in a bogey or worse, and feel comfortable again.
Playing defensively, as I did 12 months ago, I missed the weekend by a
stroke.''
Montgomerie, aged 31, insists he is not oppressed at having inherited
the burden carried by the holder, Jose-Maria Olazabal, as ''the best
European player not to have won a major title.'' He maintained: ''If I
retire without one, I'll have no regrets as long as I can say I've done
my best.''
But for several reasons the Glasgow-born Scot's confidence is high. In
practice he has had more birdies than usual -- eight on Tuesday alone --
at least partly the result of having returned home last week to have his
irons re-shafted and new grips fitted which give him a softer feel.
''I can gauge distances more accurately now,'' Montgomerie declared.
''With my coach, Bill Ferguson, here with me for the first time, I've
been learning to draw the ball when I have to and, although that's not
my normal shape of shot I've found I can drive the ball farther,
sometimes even past Ian Woosnam.
''I know my way around this place now and what to expect. Of course,
it's encouraging for me that Europeans have won the Masters in six of
the last seven years, because if I can beat them all on our tour, then
why not here?''
To that end, his playing record so far this year has not been
unhelpful. After having taken second place in Dubai and seventh in
Manila, Montgomerie made the cut in all four Florida tournaments.
Moreover, although an opening 79 in the Players' Championship instantly
removed him from contention, Montgomerie finished equal-fourteenth by
having the lowest total for the remaining 54 holes -- a performance he
surely can build upon.
True, only nine Europeans and the Amateur champion, Lee James, are
competing this year and of the professionals only Montgomerie, David
Gilford, and Miguel Angel Jimenez have not won this title. The last two
may be discounted for lack of experience, and Sandy Lyle for a game in
disarray.
Nick Faldo, the favourite, and Bernhard Langer, recently runner-up in
the Players' Championship, are on form and will not fail for lack of
meticulous preparation, and Woosnam has joyfully rediscovered his draw.
Severiano Ballesteros could celebrate his thirty-eighth birthday on
Sunday with his third victory; he is apparently swinging well but the
baggage he carries of his own expectations may prove too heavy.
Would that the game and the morale of Montgomerie's fellow Scot, Lyle,
gave any grounds for optimism. Since his victory in 1988 Lyle has in six
opportunities missed three cuts and failed to finish higher than
twenty-first. In three tournaments this year, in Europe and America, he
has missed two cuts and fared no better than thirty-second.
Lyle strikes the ball well enough on the practice ground but, on the
course, he is waiting for the bad shot instead of thinking about the
good one. Now 37, Lyle, who has two years to run of his 10-year
exemption on the US tour for having won the 1987 Players' Championship,
might rejoin it next season. ''But if this goes on for another three or
four years,'' Lyle has said, ''I'll have to find something else to do.''
0 Only four players -- one of them Sam Torrance -- out of the top 50
on the Sony world rankings are not in the field of 86. The high
standards of shot-making and the low levels of scoring that are achieved
nowadays suggest another close-run thing, with the usual tumultuous
climax over the last nine water-strewn holes on Sunday.
History is against Olazabal making a successful defence, for instance.
Then there is Nick Price. In poker parlance, can the Open and US PGA
champion extend his straight flush to three titles in a tournament in
which the Zimbabwean established the course record of 63 in 1986, but
has only twice finished in the first 10?
South African Ernie Els achieved that distinction last year in his
baptism of fire, and so might the US Open champion make a clean sweep of
the world's four major championships? Montgomerie believes the alliance
of Els' sweeping power and delicate short game is as potent a force as
Fred Couples has at his disposal.
Couples is one of only six Americans to have won the Masters in the
past 15 years and Paul Azinger, in the 1993 US PGA championship, became
the last American to win any major.
The American contenders are such established players as Corey Pavin,
Tom Lehman, second and third in his only Masters appearances, Loren
Roberts, a late developer and a fine putter, and Lee Janzen, who two
weeks ago added the Players' Championship to his 1993 US Open title. But
that emblematic Green Jacket is seldom easily slipped on to the winner's
shoulders.
Greg Norman will attest to that. In the late 80s the Australian had a
frustrating sequence of second, second, fifth, and third, and
established a reputation, not only in this event, for finding ways of
failing to win more majors than his two Open championships. Recently
turned 40, Norman may have drunk from that well too often.
Tiger Woods, the 19-year-old Amateur champion, cut short his practice
yesterday to receive treatment for back spasms, which have troubled him
in the past.  He later received electrical stimulation treatment and
will keep his date on the tee with defending champion Olazabal.

COLIN Montgomerie holed-in-one at the fourth hole of the par-3
competition.
No-one has ever won the par-3 and then the Masters, but the Scot, four
under after seven of the nine holes, hit into the lake at the eighth,
ran up a 5, and finished on 25. ''I didn't do it deliberately,'' he
said.
Hal Sutton won the par-3 in a play-off with David Edwards after both
had shot 23.

''A LIE repeated often enough will be believed,'' writes Councillor
John Kemp and then repeats the lie peddled by his party's candidate in
the Perth and Kinross by-election, namely that the SNP is ''robbing the
elderly to pay the elderly'' (April 3).
Our proposed charges-on-services formula would have been recognised by
Strathclyde Labour councillors as similar to the one they have adopted
and they would certainly not accept John Kemp's accusation of robbery.
It is true that a promise was made to alleviate the difficulty caused
by the Westminster VAT on fuel. Our ''Warm up for Winter'' campaign has
made good that promise supplying those in need with benefits greatly in
excess of the #10 promised.
If indeed Labour councillors are to be credited with this idea then
perhaps John Kemp's electors might ask why, after eight long winters of
Tayside Labour, this brilliant idea only emerged in the first winter of
an SNP administration.

ANVAR Khan in her article, Battle of the bottles (March 31), has the
common misconception, beloved of politicians and insurance salesmen,
that to multiply a number by three is an increase of 300% and that gross
profit is the same as clear, or net, profit.
To take the examples quoted, and to ignore the fact that cost prices
are usually VAT-exclusive but retail prices are VAT-inclusive, the gross
profit is #2 less 63p which is 137p and equals 217%.
From the gross profit all the costs of the establishment must be met,
including the present rates revaluation.
As a retailer of some 25 years dispensing a different kind of
medication I have been instructing new graduates that what goes in the
till is not our earnings and the cry that ''You must be making a
fortune'' is not necessarily so.

IN the youngest age-groups to race yet in the newly established
British Skiing Championships fortnight, designed to feature competitive
skiing's full spectrum from World Cup to first-time racers, Scots took
four of the top six places in yesterday's Super G.
Blair Aitken, the 14-year-old North of Scotland champion who has been
on the KPMG Scottish Team for two years, shares the boys' under-15 Super
G title with England's Joseph Sharp (14) after the pair skied an
identical time of 51.35sec.
The girls' Super G was declared void after one top seed's time was not
recorded, and the timing equipment was alleged to have faltered for a
number of other racers. It will be re-run after today's Giant Slalom.
Results:
Under-15: Super G -- 1 (equal), J Sharp (Telford), B Aitken (Ormiston)
51.35sec.; 3, B Simpson-Lyons (Sheffield) 51.98; 4, N Baxter (Cairngorm)
52.53; 5, G Trayner (Fife) 52.30; 6, D Murray (St Andrews) 53.12.

I EXPECT many readers of Weekender (April 1) must have thought for a
moment that Jim Hewitson was having us on for a Ma Gowk. Of course the
second historian was not Thomas Macaulay but Thomas Carlyle, a mistake
which makes nonsense of his whole article.
His treatment of this celebrated Victorian incident was frivolous as
well as confused. Mill did not ''chuck'' Carlyle's manuscript in the
fire. It was found in ashes next morning burnt by an over-zealous and
over-tidy servant.
Your writer misses the horror of discovery, the agony of Mill's
confession to his friend, the whole drama of the moment, and Carlyle's
determination to set out patiently to rewrite the manuscript all over
again.
The vividness of Carlyle's finished work on the French Revolution was
the inspiration for an equally vivid and famous novel by Charles
Dickens, A Tale of Two Cities.
Jim Hewitson has now his own agony to suffer. His reputation for
accuracy is in ashes after so staggering a howler.

THE World Doubles Cup, keystone of the Scottish Lawn Tennis
Association's centenary celebrations and gala opening for the revamped
national centre of excellence at Craiglockhart, was crumbling under yet
another blow yesterday.
Hard on the heels of news that neither of last year's final pairings
had entered, comes a statement to the effect that Martina Navratilova is
almost certain to be a non-starter.
The Women's Tennis Association, who originally stated the Edinburgh
event (May 24 to 27) was on Navratilova's programme, backtracked
yesterday after a spokeswoman at the International Management Group, her
New York agency, said they had: ''No record of the Doubles Cup being on
her agenda. She has not played any mainstream matches, only exhibition
events.''
The WTA said that Navratilova, who retired from tournament singles
play last year, was ranked high enough to qualify for the doubles event,
but had not officially entered.
The seven pairings of the cup eight for Edinburgh, revealed by the WTA
on Tuesday, confirmed that neither defending champions Arantxa
Sanchez-Vicario and Jana Novotna, nor the runners-up, Gigi Fernandez and
Natalia Zvereva, had entered.
Both had featured heavily in promotional material.
''The only remaining place will be filled by a wild card,'' said WTA
spokesman Nick Imison, ''and we are actively pursuing a suitable pair.''

TOM and Joanne Baxter, the husband-and-wife team behind Scotland's
oldest working coal-fired bakery, were among those who yesterday
celebrated the second birthday of Business Ventures.
Their company, Strathdevon, is one of the success stories of Business
Ventures, which has Scottish Enterprise and Glasgow Development Agency
as its main sponsors.
Set up last May, the company combines the old and the new, servicing
its fast-food restaurant in Alloa through the nearby Hope Bakery, which
was established in 1810.
Strathdevon, which required a start-up investment of #300,000, now has
an annual turnover of #400,000 and employs 36 people.
It combines the skills of Tom, a 43-year-old accountant (above), and
Joanne, a former home economics teacher.
Business Ventures, which has been instrumental in securing #4m worth
of equity to back the creation of 24 new businesses, held a Bacon Butty
Birthday Bash in its Glasgow offices yesterday to celebrate its
achievements.
The guests included all the companies helped by Business Ventures and
were welcomed by chief executive George Hammersley.

THE Co-operative Bank, which yesterday reported record annual profits,
has offered its 3000-plus clerical staff a two-year promise of no
compulsory redundancies as part of pay negotiations for 1995 and 1996.
They are being offered between 8.5% and 11.5% over two years, with pay
up between 3.5% and 6.5% depending on performance, plus a productivity
bonus of 2.5% and a profit-sharing element of 2.5%.
The ''no sackings'' pledge comes just days after the chief executive
of Lloyds Bank, Sir Brian Pitman, forecast another 75,000 jobs would be
axed in the banking industry over the next few years.
Co-operative Bank managing director Terry Thomas said he thought that
figure could be doubled by the end of the century as banks switched
increasingly to phone-based services and rationalised their paperwork.
His bank is the largest in the telephone banking sector with 2.2
million customers and 5.5 million calls per year to its staff.
While trading profits at the main High Street banks were largely flat
last year, the Manchester-based Co-operative Bank reported a 5% boost in
operating income to #238m.
It also benefited, like it rivals, from lower bad debt provisions,
down #6.5m to #32m.
Pre-tax profits jumped 55% to #27.5m in the year to Janaury 14 from
#17.8m in the previous 12 months.
The bank is paying a record dividend of #3m to its sole shareholder,
the Co-operative Wholesale Society, up from #2.5m a year earlier.
The Banking union, Bifu, said the Co-op's profits rise showed that
banks could do well and still increase their branch network. In the last
10 years it had expanded its High Street branches from 75 to 135.
''This is a lesson that all the major banks can learn from -- 80% more
branches in 10 years means record profits,'' said the union's assistant
secretary Geof Luton.
Mr Thomas said the Co-op's success was based on solid banking
performance and its high-profile ethical stance on business
relationships.
Both personal and corporate customers had been attracted by its policy
and many charities and voluntary organisations had made substantial
deposits with the bank.
Mr Thomas also highlighted the ''free for life'' Visa gold card, which
became the most widely available card of its kind in Europe in 1994, and
its growing network of unmanned banking kiosks.
The automatic outlets have video links to bank staff and give access
to the bank's Armchair Banking telephone-based service.
In 1994, Mr Thomas threw down a challenge to his rivals by offering
customers #10 if the Co-op failed to live up to its pledges on specific
levels of service.
''The early indications are that claims will be minimal,'' he said.
Errors were currently running at one in 270,000 transactions, a success
rate of 99.9996%.
A Mori poll of customers, he added, showed 65% ''very satisfied'' with
the Co-operative, against 42% for its nearest rival among the four High
Street giants.

YOUR Scottish Chambers of Commerce transport supplement which strongly
criticised various bodies for not being able to supply an integrated
transport map is interesting (March 30).
On behalf of Mull and Iona Chamber of Commerce members we strongly
criticise you for the blatantly unreliable transport map which you
published.
Where do you think people go to get to Mull and Iona from Oban? You
completely misguide potential travellers that Mull is only accessible
via Lochaline or Kilhoan. What about the near 5000-ton ferry, MV Isle of
Mull, the jewel in the Caledonian MacBrayne fleet?
This vessel carries about 500,000 passengers per year, yet you seem to
ignore the passage to Craignure. Can we hope for a revised copy? There
may be other errors of which we are not aware.

I was interested to read your supplement on the Scottish Chambers
Transport Conference (March 30). There was one section, however, which
caused me concern because it could mislead your readers and that was in
relation to the comments attributed to Mr M Sandys about the Glasgow
Airport Initiative and the photograph caption referring to ''the
masterplan for the 1500 acres to be developed north of the airport''.
Your readers should be aware the majority of this area lies within the
Greenbelt in both the Renfrew Local Plan and the Strathclyde Structure
Plan. A Greenbelt release on this scale would require a reasoned
justification with evidence of need.
No such information has been forthcoming, no application for planning
permission has been made, and as such no decision has been taken on the
proposal, which is being promoted by Renfrewshire Enterprise on its own
initiative.

THE merry-go-round that whirls the richest prize in sport in seemingly
never ending circles will again slip into motion in Las Vegas on
Saturday when Oliver McCall defends the world heavyweight boxing
championship against Larry Holmes.
To be precise, McCall, the World Boxing Council champion, will defend
one quarter of the crown which was once worn proudly by men such as Joe
Louis, Rocky Marciano, and Muhammad Ali, who, when they stepped into a
ring, knew that, despite the murky world of boxing politics, that they
were, indeed, the best in the world.
With the release from an Indiana jail of former champion Mike Tyson
the complicated system doesn't look like getting any better in the
forseeable future.
McCall wants to fight Tyson, the 46-year-old grandfather, George
Foreman, who holds the International Boxing Federation version of the
title, wants to fight Tyson, and Riddick Bowe, who holds the World
Boxing Organisation's part of the crown, wants to fight Tyson as well.
What about the other quarter of the title, you may ask. That is
complicated, too. Foreman also was holder of the World Boxing
Association version, but was last month stripped of that because,
against the wishes of their championship committee, he has fixed himself
up to box a German, Axel Schulz, and not the No.1 contender, Tony
Tucker. The said committee voted by 5-0 in Atlantic City that he was no
longer world champion.
Tucker will now meet Bruce Seldon for the WBA crown, and when the dust
has settled on that skirmish, there will be four men gunning for Tyson,
or to be more accurate, a slice of the #200m deal it has been suggested
the delinquent is about to sign with Showtime, the American cable TV
network.
It is difficult enough for a sporting hack to keep abreast of what is
happening in the wonderful world of boxing, but the public demands more
and more title fights. Why else would television companies around the
world pour in money to the same extent as a building contracter would
have to pour in concrete to level off the North Sea?
Television has a lot to answer for, and when they tire of of the
mix-and-match boxing as we have it today, the sport will certainly be
financially poorer, but more genuine in terms of quality at the top end
of the scale.
Professional boxing has continued to be handicapped by the lack of a
single authoritative governing body. The WBA stems from the National
Boxing Authority, founded in 1920, and in 1963, when the WBC was founded
in Mexico City, it was widely regarded as the top authority.
Since then, however, the IBF and the WBO have sprung to life and
confusion reigns, if not among the fat cats who benefit from having a
quarter share in the spoils of war, then certainly among the true boxing
fans.
At the last count there were 68 world champions at 17 different
weights among the four organisations.
Still, there will be a huge, world-wide audience witnessing the
trading of blows between McCall and Holmes in Las Vegas on Saturday,
everyone wondering who will become even richer by eventually getting
Tyson into a championship ring.
Personally, I am not convinced that Tyson will again be the awesome
menace he was to the heavyweights before he served his time. People seem
to have got bigger while he has somewhat withered in jail. But the cash
is there, the public will pay to see if Tyson still has it, and those
who hold a slice of the heavyweight championship will do everything
short of begging to cash in.
Tyson will be wheeled around America and Europe in a series of
build-up fights and then presented to the world as the man who should be
king -- albeit probably a monarch with a chance of reclaiming only a
quarter of his kingdom.
The men who currently share the spoils are:
WBC -- Oliver McCall, a 30-year-old American who got lucky by
sucker-punching Britain's Lennox Lewis in the second round in London
last September. A former sparring partner for Frank Bruno, he defends
the title against the ageing former champion Larry Holmes this weekend.
IBF -- George Foreman, 46-year-old grandfather who turned the division
on its head by knocking out Michael Moorer in six rounds in November --
20 years after having lost the title to Ali in Zaire. His next bout is
against the German, Schulz.
WBO -- Riddick Bowe, 28-year-old American who blasted out Britain's
mini-heavy Herbie Hide in Las Vegas last month.
WBA -- title vacant because of Foreman's refusal to fight Tucker, who
will now meet Seldon for the championship.
Mind you, by the time Tyson is ready, if ever, to box for the world
crown, it could all have changed again . . . Lewis, Hide, Frank Bruno,
Moorer, Evander Holyfield, Tommy Morrison, and company are all pushing
in the queue.
Bruno, in fact, has said that if he wins a version of the world title
this summer, he will make his first defence against Tyson. First,
though, the amiable Frank must beat Ray Anis in Glasgow next month,
which should not be too difficult.
Anis has been beaten only once in 20 contests, but I don't recognise
too many of the names on his record.
These are only the lads from the four foremost boxing organisations.
We also have the IBO, IBC, WBF, and WBU to confuse the issue further. No
wonder they call the men who run boxing the alphabet boys.
Of course, it is a nonsense to have so many world champions, so, for
what it is worth, here is my choice of the best men in the world at the
17 recognised weights:
Heavy -- Riddick Bowe (USA). Cruiser -- Alfred Cole (USA). Light-heavy
-- Virgil Hill (USA). Super-middle -- Roy Jones (USA). Middle -- Julian
Jackson (Virgin Islands). Light-middle -- Luis Santana (Dominican

CAN we get this straight once and for all? I lost a point in the local
school PTA quiz night because of this. In 1923 climber George Mallory
was on a lecture tour of the US to raise money for the 1924 Everest
expedition. A reporter, after one of his lectures, asked him the
inevitable ''why'' question that mountaineers have always endured, and
he replied, probably in desperation: ''Because it's there.''
Now Hillary may well have said it (as reported in The Herald:
''Hillary has summit with namesake''), Bonnington may have said it,
Messner may have said it, I've said it myself on the top of Ben Lomond
-- but Mallory was first.
If you don't believe me, try Walt Unworth's mighty and authoritative
book on Everest, all 704 pages of it in paperback. ''Because it's
there'' is on page 100.

ONE of the salient points of my letter was distorted (April 1).
A four-figure grid reference indicates a square with sides of one
kilometre, a six-figure grid indicates a square with sides of 100
metres, while an eight-figure number ties the location down to a square
with 10 metre (32ft) sides.
The description of ''very accurately'' refers to the eight-figure
reference, and not to the four-figure one.

REPORTS that Peter Capaldi's winning film collected Scotland's first
Oscar for over 30 years are not quite fair to Scotland's record. It is
only 15 years since The Dollar Bottom received the award in the same
category, live shorts.
This was filmed in Scotland from a James Kennaway story. That the late
Robert Urquhart led a largely Scottish cast is evidenced by the
predictable complaint in Halliwell's Film Guide about ''impenetrable''
accents.
Technicalities aside (for example, the release was handled by the
American company, Paramount), it was an Oscar for Scotland.

Three months into his new job as chairman of the Press Complaints
Commission, Lord Wakeham -- former Cabinet minister and 'fixer-in-chief'
-- pledged yesterday that he will try to fight off statutory controls on
the press. He told a Press Gallery lunch that he believes while party
leaders are against the idea a majority of backbenchers would be
enthusiastic. Wakeham now finds himself as the man in the middle, just
where he likes to be.
TWO factors about Lord Wakeham's arrival as chairman of the Press
Complaints Commission illuminate the man. The first is that the name of
this former Tory Cabinet Minister was put forward for the job by Labour
peeress Brenda Dean, the former trade union leader. The second is that
the pay for the position at once increased by #10,000 to #75,000.
Both factors remark his talents, which appear ideal for this task.
Wakeham's view of how the world should be run is to identify the problem
and negotiate a solution. No fuss, no bother; a good deal is one that
makes everyone happy.
Throughout his political career he rejoiced in the label ''Mr Fixit''.
If he has his way on the commission there will be more fixing than fame.
He applauds the fact that the vast majority of complaints are settled
amicably without controversy or publicity.
But the intentions of Lord Wakeham, 63 in June, do not stop there. He
wants the Press Complaints Commission to command more respect in the
country. Indeed, it is regarded as essential if the Government is to
avoid imposing discipline by statute.
Wakeham arrives on the 17-strong commission just as nine members are
leaving, having completed their term of duty. He will have a significant
say in their replacement. He wants a strong team, well equipped to
handle the big cases. The first test of his commission's authority are
the complaints against The Guardian on the Jonathan Aitken/Ritz Hotel
Paris allegations and the thorny problem of identifying winners of the
National Lottery.
Lady Dean, former print union general secretary and member of the TUC
General Council, is a political opponent; so she must have been
convinced that his calibre is suitable for a beefed-up Press Complaints
Commission. Wakeham, after all, was in the van of the Thatcher
privatisations. The socialist and the Tory share a love of sailing.
And the salary? Well wages are wages, no matter how much you have in
the bank; and there should be a proper rate for the job that recognises
the man's exceptional experience. ''If that's what you want, I can do
it,'' has been his life's motto. Making things work, not money, is his
driving force. The PCC will keep him in touch with events and in the
public eye.
His father, Major Walter Wakeham, was a civil engineer who ran a
garage business in the South of England. Young John was sent to
Charterhouse, the famous blue-coats school, but not university. He chose
accountancy, and set out in business with #300 capital. His speciality:
doctoring ailing companies back to health. Farming was another line --
Surrey Young Farmer of the Year, 1958. By 1972, he was an inner-London
magistrate, further widening his scope.
As his business career prospered he was able to indulge his other
passion, horse-racing, as an owner. Indeed, it is widely believed that
he still fancies Lord Wyatt's job at the Tote. Apart from the Press
Complaints Commission, he is a director of the merchant banking firm N M
Rothschild. He divides his leisure time between his townhouse in
Victoria, his former farmhouse in Hampshire, and his farm in Wales.
Public affairs and its mechanisms fascinated him. He determined to get
involved one day when he was ready to move on to different challenges.
But, like many other Tories, he decided first to make himself
financially independent; and this he did, travelling the world with his
company doctor expertise. His skills in deal-making became a legend in
that field.
By the early sixties he was ready for serious politics. He was beaten
by the formidable Dick Crossman in Coventry East (1966) and failed in
Putney by only 300 votes (1970). Then in 1974, 10 years after he joined
the Conservative Party, he won Maldon, Essex. Not many newcomers are
able to arrive at the Commons in a chauffeur-driven car, with a
telephone in it -- a novelty in those days. He had 62 directorships as a
fledgling back bencher. There was no Register of Members' Interests
then, so few were aware of his business spread. He shed 51 of them
almost immediately.
Thatcher made him a Whip in her first administration in 1979, the
first step towards his true political fulfilment in becoming Government
Chief Whip in 1983. Four years later he was in Cabinet as Leader in the
Commons, responsible for the Government's legislation and tactics. He
had done his time as a junior minister at the Treasury and at Industry.
In 1989, Thatcher's electricity privatisation plans were in disarray and
he was given the task of sorting it out. Nuclear had to be detached, and
this he persuaded her to do.
This catalogue goes nowhere near revealing his influence and authority
throughout his ministerial career. Wakeham was always close to Thatcher,
who relied heavily on his judgment. The 1984 Brighton bomb, which cost
the life of his first wife Roberta, and which he only just survived with
severely damaged legs, brought them even closer.
He helped her through the damaging resignations of Chancellor Nigel
Lawson and Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe. Too late, she brought
him in to try to rescue her effort to resist Heseltine and remain
leader. His final advice was not to consult the Cabinet collectively,
but to see them individually in her room in the Commons. It may have
been the wrong tactic, although he felt she had to be made aware of the
serious trouble she was in. With few exceptions, they told her she could
not win.
His philosophy: ''You win some, you lose some.'' He retained this view
when, with John Major at No 10 and Heseltine in charge at Trade and
Industry, the Government mishandled pit closures last year. By then
Leader in the Lords, Wakeham was Major's troubleshooter and supposed
co-ordinator of information (propaganda). A Tory revolt humiliated
Heseltine, but Wakeham admits that his eye was off the ball.
Typically, he was too caught up in difficult negotiations with the
Treasury over miners' compensation; there was also the fact that he had
to try to cope with a Tory Party that was dangerously obsessive about
Maastricht and Europe. For once, he overlooked the politics,
concentrating on a business decision about an industry that was losing
#100m a month.
After that, Wakeham's spark seemed to dim. The atmosphere of the Lords
did not suit his style, although he was treated with respect at the
despatch box. The subtle lines of communication between the Government
and its peers suffered, perhaps also because legislation was
ill-prepared. In one session alone, the Government introduced more than
2300 amendments to its own Bills in the Lords.
Wakeham was glad that the Prime Minister accepted his offer to stand
down in the reshuffle last July. He had a sense of an end of an era for
him in politics and his bomb-crushed legs still give pain. At the time,
in addition to his duties in the Lords, he was chairing five Cabinet
committees and serving on three others. He wanted more time with his
second wife Alison, his former secretary, and their three sons.
Any ambitions he might have had for No 10 died during his performance
on a BBC Election Call programme in 1987. A Labour plant called in and
flummoxed him in a way that should not happen to Cabinet Ministers. He
had done all he could in politics, so pastures new beckoned with his
resignation from Cabinet last year.
Fellow members of the PCC, and editors who might appear before him,
should note the opinion of one civil servant who worked closely with
him: ''There's a good deal of very cold hardness.''
An MP friend put it another way: ''He's the most unabrasive chap you
could meet, but with a pretty steely core. One of his strengths is that
he conceals it.''

THE latest events in Burundi are both ugly and familiar. People are
being killed in large numbers because of their membership of a distinct
social group. Those killed so far still total only a few hundreds which
means there may still be time to contain the numbers of victims. The
murders are certainly ugly enough already but the sense of familiarity
is more frightening still for Burundi is next door to Rwanda and has a
somewhat similar social mix (though the proportions of Hutu and Tutsi
are somewhat different) and both groups hate each other. Last year in
Rwanda these hundreds of victims suddenly became hundreds of thousands
(possibly as many as a million on some estimates), and two million other
people fled for their lives to neighbouring states, where they imposed,
and continue to impose, enormous responsibilities on reluctant hosts.
The beginnings of a mass exodus from Burundi may have been halted by the
Tanzanian Government which is trying to prevent any movement across its
borders. It may not be able to do so if the initial murders are
repeated. Such atrocities have a habit of escalating.
Rwanda has not settled down completely, and many of its people linger
still in refugee camps in neighbouring states, where, according to
Amnesty International, they are effectively terrorised by members and
agents of their former Hutu Government. Unfortunately they are not
really safe to go home: stable and civil government has yet to return to
Rwanda. The army of the Rwandan Patriotic Front, which eventually won
the civil war, has taken the law into its own hands. The UN presence
there managed to achieve very little in the way of saving lives.
Possibly more has been done in the refugee camps, where many
international relief agencies are active; but some observers doubt even
that since the camps are bursting and suffering from malnutrition and
disease. The Rwandan story exposed acutely the limits of the UN's
military and humanitarian intervention, especially given the sovereign
rights of the state requiring help.
Should things worsen abruptly in Burundi, demands for UN intervention
will be unavoidable. Two things might usefully be said in the context.
First, planning for such a request should be already advanced, with
various governments being sounded out as to their providing troops, and
the Organisation of African Unity being prompted to address the more
sensitive politics aspects of international intervention. Secondly,
would-be interventionists must be ready from the start to use force to
restore law and order and save lives. There was something pathetic about
the role of those UN forces in Rwanda whose members had to stand by
helplessly and watch mass murder and even worry about their ability to
protect themselves. There should be no repetition of that fiasco. No
international deployments should be made at all if they lack the power
and the mandate to save lives in the face of intended genocide. This is
where the OAU could be vital since it might better enjoy the authority
than the UN itself, to insist that the reality of mass murder should
override the theoretical sovereignty of a state whose Government cannot
prevent it, or is indeed engaged in it. Burundi has been teetering on
the brink of mass murder for two years (having been there before 30
years ago). If the country does go over the brink only armed
intervention is worth contemplating.

Government policy is forcing dentists to take adult treatment back to
basics, reports Alan MacDermid.
ASCALED-DOWN NHS dental service was on the horizon last night after
the Government's latest policy announcement for the profession.
Health Minister Gerald Malone left more questions than answers when he
pronounced more priority for the treatment of children's teeth and
restriction of NHS care for adults to more basic treatments like
fillings, extractions and dentures.
It appears that subsidised crowns and bridgework for those who can't
afford to pay for it themselves will be a thing of the past.
If this is the final shape of the dental ''reforms'' it will be a kick
in the teeth not only for poorer patients but the dwindling band of
dentists, concentrated in inner-city areas, who have been struggling to
carry on NHS work.
As it is more than 2000 out of the UK's 18,000 dentists have quit the
NHS and others are putting a bar on new patients or restricting NHS work
to children. According to MP Alex Carlisle, nearly 900,000 have been
de-registered against their will.
Those who carry on face mounting difficulty maintaining quality at NHS
rates, 80% of which have to be met by the patient in any event.
''There have been more bankruptcies among dentists in the past two
years than over the previous 12 years,'' said Mr Roy McBurnie, a Glasgow
dentist and past president of the local dental committee.
''Younger dentists are particularly prone, because of the huge initial
cost of equipping and setting up in practice.''
Another policy plank announced by Mr Malone -- the introduction of the
purchaser-provider system to dentistry, with health boards purchasing
services from dentists, leaves more questions than answers. There are
pilot areas already being selected for the introduction of this system,
but these have not been chosen yet. There is to be one in Scotland and
seven in England.
There is still a legacy of bitterness over the way the introduction of
patient registration was handled in 1992, when a flood of registrations
led to high work levels -- and consequentially fee levels -- which
severely embarrassed the government.
On the basis that the dental budget was heavily over-subscribed, it
claimed the dentists were being ''overpaid'' and clawed back 7% of the
fees for a reaction which cost dentists some #7000 a year.
''What made it worse is the fact that this extra work naturally
incurred extra expense as well as extra payment, but the Government did
not wait until our expenses were calculated -- the Dental Rates Study
Group reports two years behind -- but took the money back right away,''
said Mr McBurnie.
''Younger dentists were being particualrly badly hit -- they were
being penalised for a benefit they had never had in the first place.''
Because of the limitations of existing NHS funding -- starting at
#3.75 for an extraction or #4.90 for the most basic check-up -- dentists
are convinced that by treating patients privately they will be able to
offer a higher standard of care, particularly in the more complex
services like crowns, which now seem destined to be taken off the NHS
list.
It is not always easy to get across the message. They are forbidden to
decry NHS services, so an aside like ''Of course, if you want a decent
job . . .'' should form no part of the conversation.
But it is quite clear that certain better materials are outwith the
scope of the NHS tariff.
''If you used them you would be on the road to insolvency,'' said Mr
McBurnie. ''It is also increasingly the case that some dental
laboratories have different rates for NHS and private work.
''One significant difference is that the private patient has the
choice of white fillings for their back teeth, whereas under the NHS
they are restricted to mercury amalgam.
''After the recent Panorama programme about mercury toxicity people
are getting more concerned about that. The risk has probably been
overstated, but at the same time patients deserve the choice -- which,
on the NHS, they do not have.''
Other benefits lost to NHS patients include laser treatment; dentists
who have introduced this pain-free substitute for the dreaded drill say
that the costs cannot be met at NHS fee levels.
That is all very well for those who can pay, or can afford the dental
health plans which the Government would clearly like to see take over
from the publicly-funded health service. For the rest ''sans eye, sans
teeth, sans everything . . .'' is creeping another step closer.
In the meantime, the availability of NHS treatment is increasingly
patchy -- it disappeared in the Highlands and the health board had to
hire community dentists.
''Dentists in Glasgow and other big cities have tried to resist this
trend but in some areas it is becoming harder to find a dentist,'' said
Mr McBurnie, whose practice is on the fringe of the city centre.
''We are doing our best to provide an NHS service but it is through a
mixture of NHS and private work.''
Fear of the dentist used to be attributable to his performance with
the drill or pincers -- now it is fear of the bill that is likely to
keep patients away, worries Mr McBurnie.
''We must not frighten them away from getting the care they need
because of exorbitant charges,'' he said.

IN what may transpire to be a very timely arrival, the Government
advisory body on museum policy, the Museums and Galleries Commission,
visited Balnain House, the self-styled ''home of Highland music'', in
Inverness yesterday.
Balnain was due to celebrate its second birthday on the 23rd of this
month. Instead it will be in the throes of crisis management. Despite
gaining a first-class reputation, both for its permanent exhibition of
our musical heritage within the house and for its tuition and travelling
workshops, the ''terrible twos'' may prove injurious, even fatal to the
fledgling initiative.
The MGC arrived at Balnain for a reception and to ''study developments
and discuss current issues''. It must be assumed there will have been
earnest exhortations made to take up the museum's cause with the
Scottish Office.
The house, a one-time hospital for the Hanoverian army after Culloden,
fell into disrepair after the Second World War. Almost 20 years of
fund-raising restored it, but lack of external funding and a hefty
overdraft now means the entire operation runs on a well-worn shoestring.
Though Balnain does receive some support from the Scottish Arts
Council and the local LEC by way of project funding, they don't get any
revenue funding -- and the house is expensive to maintain and staff.
The net result is a dependency on tourists visiting the exhibition to
make ends meet. It has a new business plan this year, part of which
means the entrance price is being halved to #1.50 (free to children) to
encourage more visitors. But as assistant manager Caroline Hewat says:
''We desperately need a really good summer to bring more tourists
through the door. However, in all honesty, we probably won't succeed
without revenue funding.''
The chairman of the board of trustees, Richard Cameron, is well aware
of the scale of the problem but is in no mood to throw in the towel.
''It has been difficult, and poor weather hasn't helped us get
sufficient numbers of tourists. Revenue funding is also a difficult
issue but we are constantly looking at new ways to fund the project.
However, we have confidence in our business plan and new approach. With
a good tourist season we could be in profit by 1996,'' he said.
The exhibition centres on Scottish music, song, dance, and instruments
from the days of banging rocks together right up to Runrig and
Capercaillie. But this is no silent gallery stuffed with totems to the
dead. Instead the rooms, corridors, and cafe ring to the sound of
sessions and classes teaching fiddle, harp, whistle, pipes and dance . .
. the tradition is alive, well, vibrant, and thriving at Balnain.
Sarah Munroe's beginners' fiddle class runs at capacity with around 50
young enthusiasts. Folk luminaries such as guitarist Bert Jansch have
dropped in to provide master classes. Bert was so taken with the place
he waived the fee, to coach a dozen locals in the foibles of the fret
board.
Dougie Pincock, erstwhile Battlefield Band piper and former
musician-in-residence at the house, has no doubts about Balnain's place
in Scottish music.
''Gathering the various strands of traditional music and culture
together under one roof was a fine idea, and the staff are doing a
superb job in providing a fertile forum for performance and tuition of
Highland music in a learning culture which is creating the musicians of
tomorrow, with very limited funds.
''The Balnain House classes held during this year's Celtic Connections
festival in Glasgow were one of the big successes of the event, both in
terms of being very well attended (80 turned up for a Gaelic singing
workshop) and the high quality of tuition on offer.''
There is general agreement that the Irish bands once again stole the
show during Celtic Connections. They, of course, come from a country
where the benefits of an identifiable musical tradition -- witness any
Irish Tourist Board advertisement -- have long been recognised.
Traditional music is a central plank in Irish popular culture and is
actively encouraged and supported by government funding.

AFTER two days in Scotland when she rode five consecutive winners,
Northern Area ladies point-to-point champion Pauline Robson must feel as
though she's walking on air.
She won the prestigious Horse and Hound Hunters' Chase for the
Buccleuch Cup at Kelso on Monday, bringing Ruber with a late run to
snatch victory from the favourite, Wudimp.
At the Dumfriesshire meeting at Roberthill, Lockerbie, the following
day she had four winners on the trot, extending her lead in the
championship to 24 points over nearest rival Kirsty Barnett.
Her victories on Sharp Opinion in the confined, Gunmetal Boy in the
ladies, and Toaster Crumpet in the first division of the maiden were
well deserved, but even she would admit to being fortunate to win the
first division of the restricted on Buck's Delight.
Andrew Parker, on Two for One, had a substantial lead jumping the
last, but when he went for his whip to get his horse going again on the
run-in it dumped him ignominiously on the ground. Robson's mount was
left clear to win by six lengths.
It was not Parker's day, as he came a cropper on Royal Stream in the
men's open. Until this week, Parker has led or shared the lead in the
men's championship, but after the Dumfriesshire he is trailing Kevin
Anderson by 11 points.
Anderson always does well at his local meeting and this was no
exception. He won the members race on Howayman by four lengths and the
open with Jimmy River, who ran a great race to beat Press for Action by
12 lengths.
It was Jimmy River's first success this season. Anderson, the five
times champion, was ''turned over'' on odds-on favourites Springhill
Quay in the restricted and Gived It Laldy in the maiden. Border Folly,
third for him in the confined, looked as if it will win soon.
The Jedforest meeting takes place at Friar's Haugh on Sunday to avoid
clashing with the Grand National. The first Sunday point-to-point
meeting in Scotland, it has attracted a large entry.

GOOD relations have been restored between Britain and America after
the damaging disagreement about their attitude to the IRA. The Irish
vote in America is constantly courted by the two main parties: it used
to be solid for the Democrats but has increasingly been open to
Republican influences these last 30 years as Irish-Americans have
responded to greater affluence by moving rightwards. Whether the Irish
nationalist legacy is generally of great political significance nowadays
is debatable, but in some states, New York and Massachussets, for
example, it certainly is still. Their Democratic establishments were
keen for Mr Clinton to identify with the Irish republican cause and
promote peace in Ulster without condoning terrorism. With one eye on the
next Presidential election, campaigning for which has begun unusually
early, Mr Clinton's motives might be easily explained: he will need to
hold as much of the traditional Irish vote as he can. There are,
however, other factors. The President seems generally ill-disposed
towards this country. It may seem a strange development, given his
Oxford education, but he has not forgiven the (ill-advised ) role some
British Conservative Party officials sought to play in promoting Mr
Bush, his rival, during the last US Presidential race. Perhaps, there is
also his hostility to British policy in Bosnia both in respect of the
arms ban on the Bosnian Muslims, and of this country's refusal to
escalate the fighting in the civil war by using our ground forces in a
more aggressive role. (Paradoxically, the Clinton administration itself
refuses to deploy US ground forces anywhere in former Yugoslavia.)
Mr Clinton may simply have been more willing than Mr Major to take the
IRA at Sinn Fein's word, and use the Gerry Adams visit to exert pressure
designed to promote peace. But, if there is little doubt that the affair
seriously damaged British-American relations, it is hard to believe
these could only be repaired by Mr Major's personal diplomacy. All Prime
Ministers, however, like the odd international jaunt, especially if it
can be given a non-partisan purpose. Harold Macmillan was particularly
adept at this, as were Harold Wilson and Margaret Thatcher. On such
trips, Premiers command more respect, and a little more deference, than
they enjoy at home. They tread the red carpet and enjoy photo
opportunities in settings of grandeur. At a time when he is suffering so
much in the domestic opinion polls, a Prime Minister would be less than
human if he did not seek a temporary escape which might work to his
benefit on return. Yet, just as Mr Clinton's motives cannot be dismissed
with complete cynicism, Mr Major has a more profound dimension to his
journey. He wants to win the peace in Ulster, hence his continued urging
of Mr Clinton to squeeze the IRA on its weapons.
The Irish question has been the intermittent bane of British political
life for a very long time (even its starting date would be a matter for
dispute) but there is a chance that it could be resolved in the near
future. Mr Major is well aware of that and, to his credit, has worked
hard to bring it about. Were he to be successful, any ''fall-out'' would
be to his advantage. When that calculation is added to the humanitarian
improvement which even fragile peace has brought in less than a year, it
is easy to see why he might take a big political risk in trying to
placate Mr Clinton. Both men played their parts rather well without even
mentioning that old spectre, the Special Relationship.

BRITISH rugby league could become part of a #50m European super league
if media magnate Rupert Murdoch has his way with revolutionary
proposals.
It is understood that #300m would be put into the worldwide operation,
with #250m of it already being injected into an Australian super league.
The European set-up, which could be in operation by summer 1996, would
have British bases in London, Cardiff, and Manchester, while the
Continental teams would be based in Paris and Toulouse. The champions of
both the Australian and European leagues would meet in an end-of-season
play-off.
The Rugby League Council's chief executive Maurice Lindsay said last
night: ''We need to talk to Mr Murdoch and his representatives, because
they share our vision of taking rugby league to the world.''

TOWARDS the end of G P Cribari's music theatre piece, Las Escondidas
-- Hide and Seek -- which received its premiere at the Old Fruitmarket
last night, a village and its inhabitants lie stunned by the shock
effect of upheaval that has shattered their lives. A husband and wife,
whose lives have been disrupted by the invasion into their peaceful
ritual, are at opposite ends of the village.
Into this setting, which develops out of a ritual procession, a long,
elegiac cello solo conjures a haunting atmosphere, and a beautiful
scenario arises, where two South American dancers weave a choreographic
spell, instrumentalists of the Chamber Group of Scotland and singers
staged around the Fruitmarket, and in its balconies, slowly climb up the
harmonic series and build a hypnotic wall of sound. It ends, as it
started, in nocturnal stillness.
It is the finest moment in Cribari's new work, which contains a range
of music displaying elements of folk and chant, as well as more
contemporary influences. Las Escondidas is a fascinating piece, not
conventionally dramatic. It is also, in its first production, bold in
its use of the Old Fruitmarket space.
Contrary to expectations, Kate Brown's production plays across, and
not along the length, of the Fruitmarket. The effect -- and this is also
the problem -- is a bit like sitting in the front row of a Cinemascope
screen. Focus for the audience, both visual and aural, is problematical.
Christopher Goldsack as the husband already has the measure of the
space; the others will have to adjust. Fine, fresh (and well-prepared)
singing from the children's chorus. Paul MacAlindin conducts. Till
Saturday.

AJAX Amsterdam moved a step closer to their first European Cup final
for 22 years last night after a goalless draw against Bayern Munich in
their semi-final first leg in Germany.
The Dutch champions outclassed the inexperienced Bayern side and now
look in a perfect position to reach the final for the first time since
they won the trophy for the third consecutive season in 1973.
Despite home advantage three-times winners Bayern only looked
dangerous on the counter attack. Without the services of key players
including injured captain Lothar Matthaeus, the Germans have a major
uphill battle to keep alive their hopes in the second leg in two weeks.
In the night's other Champions Cup match Italy's AC Milan beat Paris
St Germain 1-0, Zvonimir Boban scoring a crucial away goal one minute
into injury time in the second half.
Albion Rovers 3, East Stirlingshire 1
ROVERS produced their best display of the season as they picked up
three points against promotion-seeking 'Shire at Cliftonhill.
Martin Scott was Rovers' hero with two well-taken goals. The first
came after 43 minutes when he showed great awareness to lob Gordon
McDougall from 40 yards.
With 69 minutes on the clock, he latched on to an excellent pass from
Gordon Young before drilling the ball home from the edge of the penalty
box.
Young secured victory five minutes later, heading home a cross from
winger Martin McBride.
Rovers' performance was tarnished, though, eight minutes from time
when substitutes Alex McEwen, who had only been on the pitch for two
minutes, was shown the red card by referee Huett for dissent.
To their credit, 'Shire pushed forward at every opportunity and only
some fine saves from Rovers keeper Jobn Wight and desperate luck in
front of goal kept them off the scoresheet until the final minute, when
Peter Dwyer rifled home a consolation.
The outcome could have been different if earlier efforts from
namesakes Robert and Ian Lee, which both had to be cleared off the line,
and a shot from Mike Geraghty, which hit a post, had managed to find the
net.

Strasbourg
AROUND the European Parliament they are known nowadays as the Unholy
Trinity, otherwise the Troika, and sometimes the Rolling Jim, John, and
Ian Show.
The Rev Ian Paisley, Mr Jim Nicholson, and Mr John Hume are the three
Northern Ireland Euro-MPs who have made a name for themselves as close
colleagues able to put their well-documented differences aside when the
occasion demands.
One of those occasions came yesterday when they shared a platform to
tell the world of their tripartite effort to make sure the European
Commission's #240m of additional aid for Northern Ireland is delivered
speedily and used wisely. They were publicising a conference next week
in Belfast to discuss ''Implementing Europe's Programme for Peace''.
No heartstring went untugged. A stranger would have been blind to any
hint of a disharmony between them. Well, come to think of it there was
just a tiny bit.
It surfaced when a cheeky chap from a Cork paper asked Mr Paisley at a
press conference if, since things were so cosy these days, he would soon
be in the Irish Republic shaking hands with the Taoiseach on the steps
of Government Buildings in Dublin.
''No,'' said the Big Man, employing his favourite word and shaking his
head disapprovingly. ''This is not about politics. It is about
economics.''
Otherwise everything was unaccustomed sweetness and light. The SDLP's
peacemongering Mr Hume, who is these days being feted and showered with
honours to such an extent that he is known around Strasbourg as St John,
remarked: ''We have lived with bad news for 25 years in Northern
Ireland. Let us now put the boot on the other foot.''
The UUP's popular Mr Nicholson, whose Unionism is of the extreme
moderate variety, warmed to the economic if not ecumenical theme:
''There is total unanimity among the three of us Northern Ireland
MEPs.''
Asked if there could be problems dividing the money between
Protestants and Catholics, Mr Nicholson was not tempted to break the new
spirit of unity among the trilogy. ''We have no problem with this,'' he
insisted. ''This is real co-operation.''
Dr Paisley was even moved to say a good word for that foreign, Roman
Catholic, socialist intellectual, Mr Jacques Delors, now departed as
president of the European Commission. (It was Mr Delors who, on his
personal initiative, made the new money available.)
''I was never a fan of Jacques Delors,'' Mr Paisley boomed, ''but I
must pay warm tribute to him. He cut the red tape and he told us that
the EU helped people outside and, therefore, it was now time to help its
own brothers and sisters -- his words -- inside the Union.''
Afterwards the three repaired to the press centre bar (though the
reverend MEP did not imbibe), where the discussions continued amicably.

STEPHEN Hendry made two huge breaks on his way to the last 16 of the
Castella Classic British Open in Plymouth last night.
He compiled a 145 and a 142 in beating Rutherglen's Drew Henry 5-3 in
the second round, missing a maximum 147 in the first frame only when he
had to take the blue after the eighth red. That cost him a #20,000 bonus
for a televised 147.
Hendry's form gives his rivals plenty to think about before he begins
the defence of his world title next week. He said: ''I'm hitting the
ball well, but I'm only just building up to a peak for the world
championship. Unconsciously, I think my body gears itself to play well
for the Crucible.
''I could easily have lost to Drew had I not scored so heavily. All
the other Scots seem to raise their game against me and, with Drew on
the verge of the top 32, he was determined to give me a hard time.''
The world champion, who had a 98 in the fifth frame and then his 142
in the seventh, faces South African Peter Francisco today for a place in
the quarter-finals.
Henry said: ''Only one person can play like Stephen did tonight. If he
produces that form at Sheffield, the rest need not turn up.''
Earlier, world No.7 Ken Doherty crashed 5-3 to Grimsby's Mike Hallett,
who plays in-form Scot John Higgins today for a place in the last eight.
Earlier, slow-coaches Mick Price and Chris Small set an unwanted
record of 72 minutes 16 seconds -- the longest TV frame in a ranking
tournament.
Leith's Small, the world No.86, eventually won that first frame 73-42,
but Nuneaton's Price went on to win 5-2. Sauchie's Billy Snaddon was
edged out 5-4 last night by Martin Clark. Second-round results:
M Hallett (Eng) beat K Doherty (Ire) 5-3; A Robidoux (Can) beat J
Birch (Eng) 5-3;  M Price (Eng) beat C Small (Sco) 5-2; J Parrott (Eng)
beat J Ferguson (Eng) 5-1;  S Hendry (Sco) beat D Henry (Sco) 5-3; M
Clark (Eng) beat B Snaddon (Sco) 5-4; R O'Sullivan (Eng) beat D Taylor

THE depth and extent of the despair which has engulfed Celtic and
their support was emphasised yesterday by long-serving midfield player
Peter Grant, who may return to the side for tomorrow's Scottish Cup
semi-final clash with Hibs at Ibrox.
Grant, whose commitment to the club could never be doubted or
under-estimated, told yesterday just how much the Coca-Cola Cup final
defeat by Raith Rovers had affected both the club and himself.
It was a harrowing 90 minutes at Ibrox the day a dream died, the day
when a cup which should now have been on display in the Parkhead
boardroom was, instead, taken off to Kirkcaldy.
Grant had to sit in the stand that afternoon, injured, unable to help
the cause, sitting beside his wife suffering as he had never suffered
before.
0 He looks as though he will make the team against Hibs after having
seven stitches removed from a knee gash which he picked up in a reserve
game against Partick Thistle 10 days ago.
Yesterday Celtic manager Tommy Burns said: ''Peter is fit again and,
obviously, that is important to us because he has been our most
consistent midfield player this season. He is in the squad because he
gives us something a little bit different in that area.''
Grant would settle for a good result tomorrow before a good
performance, and the bitter disappointments he has endured over the past
five years simply add to his determination to end the famine.
But he does not see the semi-final as an easy passport to a trophy. He
looks at Hibs and points out: ''Pat McGinlay is there and he was top
scorer at this club just last season. Then they have Michael O'Neill who
has had a magnificent spell since signing for the club. Darren Jackson
is now in the Scotland team and Jim Leighton is also back. That tells
you what we are up against.''
As well as Grant, Burns has added Stuart Gray and Brian O'Neil to the
squad which will travel to Seamill today to prepare for the tie.
Meanwhile, Pierre van Hooydonk stands a little aside from his Celtic
team-mates as they prepare for tomorrow's match. And he does so for two
reasons.
The first is that the Dutchman has not shared in the malaise which has
gripped the Parkhead club over the past five years and, therefore, he
dismissed any talk of ''pressure.''
The second is that the Dutchman still has make his first appearance at
Ibrox, having signed for Celtic just after the last Old Firm encounter.
Yesterday van Hooydonk said: ''I don't want to hear about the past. I
wasn't here then and if we listen to that kind of talk it might upset
the team.
''We have to be positivewe have a chance to put Celtic back where they
should be -- in European football next season.''
That is the aim of the Dutchman. He was lured to Scotland by the
thought of playing in Europe and winning trophies. At Breda, van
Hooydonk knew little success. Eventually, he realised he would have to
move to find success. That is why he came to Celtic.
While van Hooydonk dismissed any thoughts of pressure, the man who has
lived with that more than anyone, club captain Paul McStay also insisted
that he would not allow this to affect him.
''No-one will forget the Coca-Cola Cup final and what happened,'' he
said. ''But we now have a chance to make up for that day.
* THE Scottish Football Association confirmed last night that they
have asked their Danish counterparts for further information on the
transfer deal which took goalkeeper Henryk Jorgenson from Viborg to
Dundee United in the summer.
I understand that following an alert from the Tannadice club, the men
at Park Gardens had asked for any other relevant details. These have now
been forwarded and the SFA have sent them on to Copenhagen.
A spokesman for the SFA said last night: ''All we have done is ask the
Danish FA to look into the transfer at their end. We want to have this
affair resolved as soon as possible.
''The information we have had sent to us from Dundee United has been
passed to the Danes.''

ITV network director Marcus Plantin yesterday moved to reassure
Scottish television companies of their role in the independent
television network.
Speaking at the Celtic Film and Television Festival in Fort William,
he identified Scottish Television series Taggart and Doctor Finlay, as
''key brands'' in the ITV schedule.
Fears of Scottish companies about the future of their place in the
network were misplaced, he said. ''Sometimes series need to be rested,
but we don't intend to throw the baby out with the bath water. The
audience likes things to stay around for a long time.''
He identified Scottish Television as one of the network's major drama
providers and claimed Doctor Finlay had now attracted back its loyal
audience in the Friday night slot in competition with the BBC's
Dangerfield.
He also looked forward to a long schedule-life for Taggart with Blythe
Duff and James McPherson in the lead roles -- citing its strong
performance in the ratings.
''Drama from Scottish Television is one of the core strengths of the
network,'' he said. Grampian Television's strong showing was in
documentaries with a number of programmes making the network schedule,
including Selena Scott's forthcoming celebrity interview series Living
Legends, which begins with Donald Trump in June.
Challenged by Scottish Film Council director Maxine Baker that the
network was still unwilling to take risks, he identified both the
Cracker and Band of Gold dramas as examples of risk-taking scheduling.
Earlier, BBC Scotland scored a notable victory in the fiercely
contested documentary category at the festival when Eleanor Yule's Just
Another Sinner -- a profile of Scots psychiatrist R D Laing for the Ex-S
series -- received this year's award.

ZVONIMIR Boban helped AC Milan take a giant step towards the final of
the Champions' Cup when his goal in injury time gave the Italian side a
1-0 victory against Paris St Germain in the French capital.
The Croatian was on the end of a Milan raid with just seconds
remaining in the semi-final, first-leg tie last night, and his shot from
12 metres gave the Paris keeper Bernard Lama little chance.
The teams will meet in two weeks in Milan for the return leg, but the
Italian team now must be firm favourites to again reach the final.
In Germany, Ajax did their chances of a place in the final no harm by
drawing 0-0 with Bayern Munich. The Dutch champions played well against
the inexperienced Germans, with Dutch internationalist Marc Overmars a
constant danger down the left. But the game rarely excited the capacity
60,000 crowd.
There were 59,789 fewer spectators at Cliftonhill, but the ones who
turned up at the Coatbridge ground witnessed more goals, Albion Rovers
beating East Stirlingshire 3-1.
Martin Scott was Rovers' hero with two, well-taken goals. The first
came after 43 minutes when he showed great awareness to lob Gordon
McDougall from 40 yards.
With 69 minutes gone, he latched on to a pass from Gordon Young before
drilling the ball home from the edge of the penalty box. And Young
secured victory five minutes later, heading home a cross from winger
Martin McBride.
Rovers' substitutes Alex McEwen, on the pitch for just two minutes,
was shown the red card by referee Huett for dissent, while 'Shire's
consolation goal came from Peter Dwyer.
THE announcer at Swindon Town was sacked at half-time last night
during the club's Division 1 clash with Bolton.
The dismissal came after Peter Lewis slammed referee Graham Barber. He
said after Swindon player-manager Steve McMahon was send off after 38
minutes: ''I've seen some crap refereeing decisions in my time but ...''
The rest of his comment was drowned out by the crowd.

FORMER double world sprint champion Katrin Krabbe has lost the support
of team-mates Grit Breuer and Manuela Derr in her court battle against a
doping ban. Krabbe is suspended -- along with Derr and former world 400m
silver medallist Breuer -- until late August after admitting to taking
the banned drug clenbuterol following positive tests in July, 1992.
But Breuer and Derr have decided to drop the case, which started in
Munich yesterday, to concentrate on next year's Olympics. Despite the
court battle, Krabbe is unlikely ever to return to sprinting. The case
has been adjourned until May 17.

A STRETCH of land near Irvine will be developed as a golf course and
estate of 700 houses, if planning consent can be secured by the town's
development corporation.
For five years the land at Montgomerie Park has been at the centre of
a wrangle between Irvine Development Corporation (IDC) and local farmers
who own nearby land. They refused to sell, and there have been claims
that they were holding out to maximise profit.
The IDC board authorised its officials to seek compulsory purchase
orders on the land, but because of the Government's decision to wind up
the corporation three years early, there would not have been time to see
the procedures through.
It had originally been envisaged that two golf courses would be built
surrounded by around 1000 houses, but a revised plan for one course and
700 homes has been submitted to the Scottish Office for approval.
The 200-acre site belongs in its entirety to the IDC and, since it was
designated for housing and leisure use in 1990, officials are confident
of a sympathetic hearing from the Scottish Office.
If the Scottish Office supports the plan, the corporation will have no
need to negotiate further with landowners or to pursue any compulsory
purchase orders.
Mr Ian Downs, chief architect and planner for the IDC, said: ''We have
felt all along that the land at Montgomerie Park was ideal for an
associated golf and housing development. There was disappointment all
around when we were unable to see the original plan through, but this
revised proposal is every bit as attractive on a smaller scale.''
If planning consent is forthcoming, tenders will be sought from
developers interested in taking on the whole package, which is expected
to be worth around #50m. Development could begin in the spring of next
year, around nine months before the corporation is finally wound up, and
could be completed within five years.
The plan includes: an 18-hole golf course near Eglinton Country Park;
a driving range; a pitch-and-putt course, and around 70 acres of
housing, much of it looking on to the course.
Mr Downs added: ''We expect that one developer would take the whole
package, and we have a firm interest already from one company, but a
number of housebuilders would be involved in order to provide a range of
house types and prices.''

GAVIN Hastings has dismissed a newspaper report that a bitter cash row
is threatening to overshadow Scotland's build-up for the Rugby World Cup
in South Africa.
The report suggested that some squad members felt they were being
exploited by the Scottish Rugby Union over public appearances, which
justified a sponsorship agreement with the whisky firm, The Famous
Grouse.
Yesterday, Hastings declared: ''These reports quote unnamed players.
You can quote me as saying that, so far as I am concerned, there is not
a problem.''
The Famous Grouse, which is the team sponsor, makes a contribution of
more than #100,000 a season to the Scottish Rugby International Squad
Trust Fund, from which squad members benefit.
The report, in an Edinburgh newspaper, suggested that squad members
had held secret meetings during last weekend's pre-World Cup
get-together in Perth. They were said to be aggrieved that, as part of
the Famous Grouse deal, they were being asked to promote the whisky
brand soon after their arrival in South Africa.
A spokeswomen for the players' Trust, which is administered by the
ex-international prop forward Ian McLauchlan, said that there had been
no rift between the players, the sponsors, or the SRU.
''This report is just untrue,'' she said. ''There were no secret
meetings. Ian held a scheduled meeting with the players on Friday night,
at which various sponsorship arrangements were discussed. Everybody
knows that nothing will be arranged without discussion and agreement.
There is no problem whatsoever.
''Obviously, as major sponsors, there are various things that Famous
Grouse would like the players to be involved in, but nothing is done
which isn't discussed and agreed, and it would be up to the manager to
decide what was and wasn't acceptable.''
Bill Hogg, the Scottish Rugby Union secretary, said: ''I am utterly
astounded by this report. So far as appearances by players are concerned
these are still being discussed. There has been no row and no secret
meetings.''

THE BBC will tonight broadcast an interview with a juror who served in
a controversial Glasgow court case.
The programme Frontline Scotland will consider the recent High Court
trial where allegedly a jury foreman mistakenly returned a verdict of
not proven on three men accused of assault after the jury had agreed
they were guilty.
It is almost unprecedented for a jury member to be interviewed after a
trial. Under the 1981 Contempt of Court Act it is an offence to obtain,
disclose, or solicit any particulars of statements made, opinions
expressed, arguments advanced, and votes cast by members of a jury in
the course of their deliberations.
The juror will be not be named or identified on screen. His comments
are restricted to events outwith the jury room and include his reaction
when he says he realised the wrong verdict had been delivered.
Mr Neil McDonald, the programme's editor, said: ''Before we did the
interview with the juror, we made it quite clear to him that we were
prohibited from going into certain areas.''
Mr McDonald added that the BBC's lawyers had rigorously examined tapes
of the programme. ''They have been involved in this for some time.''
Mr Gerry Brown, a Glasgow solicitor-advocate, said: ''By taking this
unusual step, a departure from previous precedent, the BBC must have
taken very solid legal advice.
''It would strike me that the Contempt of Court Act is a very
dangerous area.''

WITH Haydn's Seven Last Words serving last night as a mere prelude to
next week's performances of the St Matthew Passion, the SCO cannot be
accused of ignoring Easter. Nor, in providing a rare opportunity to hear
Haydn's full orchestral original, was the drama of this extraordinary
work in any way neglected.
This was a performance that etched the Stations of the Cross with
bold, strong, sombre strokes. As in the familiar, softer-edged version
for string quartet, the music was like a series of huge, slow, symphonic
introductions to a short and shattering final presto, though it takes
the sound of an orchestra fully to underline the fact.
Max Pommer, the Leipzig-born guest conductor, found subtle ways of
varying the inevitably trudging pace of the music, contrasting its
starkness with its sudden moments of Viennese sweetness, and making
beautifully graded distinctions between the meanings of adagio, largo,
and lento. A throbbing quartet of horns, plangent oboe tone, and a deep
undertow of cellos and basses all contributed to the cumulative effect
of these powerful tableaux, before the crack of kettledrums announced
the final earthquake.
Earlier, a serious, leisurely account of Bach's B minor flute suite,
featuring David Nicholson, eschewed Galway-like speed and showmanship.
Emma Kirkby was the serene and sunny soloist in Handel's motet, Sileti
Venti, a lovely work, too rarely performed.

One year ago today Rwanda erupted into a bloody ethnic war which left
more than one million people dead. The anniversary comes as neighbouring
Burundi teeters on the brink of anarchy and bloodshed.
THE MYSTERE-FALCON jet was seconds away from landing at Kigali Airport
when the rocket struck, blasting the aircraft off the runway and into a
nearby cane field, where it exploded in a fireball.
Among the charred remains of 10 people pulled from the wreckage were
the bodies of the Rwandan President, Juvenal Habyarimana, and his
counterpart from Burundi, Cyprien Ntaryamira. Both had been returning
from a conference in Dar Es Salaam to discuss ethnic tensions in the
region.
It was the evening of April 6, 1994. Across the developed world news
wires spat out the story then fell quiet. Africa. Crisis. Again.
No-one, not aid agencies, the UN, foreign secretaries, academics or
seasoned Africa observers, was prepared for the disaster which started
to overpower Rwanda just 45 minutes after the plane was brought down --
death and destruction on a scale so vast that even one year on it is
still difficult to grasp fully the enormity of what happened.
More than one million people, overwhelmingly the minority Tutsis, were
killed and countless more maimed and displaced. Mass graves are still
being uncovered; bleached skulls clustered in fields like obscene fungal
growths; rooms choked with skeletal remains.
It is understood that this morning, in Kigali, one man will be led
into a hall to stand trial for genocide. It is a brave but somewhat
empty gesture by Rwanda's new government to try the first person accused
of taking part in the atrocities. In truth, they have no proper judicial
system in place to see the process through. Most of the Hutu extremists
who initiated the tragedy are still at large, and no-one has been able
to prove who fired the rocket which ignited the war.
Tomorrow, Rwanda will hold a national day of mourning and the bodies
of the former Prime Minister, Agathe Uwilingiyamana, and 10 other
government officials, will be buried. Mrs Uwilingiyamana was hacked to
death in the early days of the crisis and her remains thrown into a
metal box and left to rot in a nearby church. Today Rwanda is, on the
surface, holding its own. Refugees continue to trickle back, basic
services are up and running, and the RPF has installed a new
administration headed by a Hutu moderate.
Scrape that surface, however, and the rot is still there. There are
reprisal killings, hundreds of thousands of Rwandans are pinned by fear
in refugee camps in neighbouring countries, conditions in the prisons
housing those accused of genocide are growing increasingly bad, and
there are recurring fears that the former Rwandan army, languishing in
Zaire, will regroup and strike back.
Speaking from his office in Kigali, Robert Maletta, director of
operations for Oxfam in Rwanda, said the country had two distinct faces.
''On the surface we are functioning normally with water supply,
markets full of people, full of traffic. There's occasionally a
roadblock or two for screening arms, but nothing oppressive. Kigali is a
city that is working these days, on the surface. But as with all of
Rwanda, there are underlying tensions.''
The West was quick to express outrage at the events in Rwanda but slow
to respond to pleas for help, and, according to Maletta, has been even
slower to help the country start the tortuous process of rebuilding.
''There's an effective lack of support for structures within the
country which would encourage stabilisation,'' said Maletta. ''There has
been an extreme ambivalence on the part of many of the donors with
regard to this government. There is almost no substantial aid coming in.
The government is very well-organised and sincere in terms of the
welfare of the people. They would like more support to be able to
deliver the goods.''
Maletta acknowledges that today's show trial is a fairly hollow event,
but insists it has special significance. ''I think the government has to
be seen to be doing something. The people are getting very frustrated
that justice is not being done. This increases tension in the country
and the chance of reprisal killings.''
The culture of fear stirred up by the extremists was still widespread,
he said: ''The organisers and perpetrators of the genocide have helped
create a nation of people in fear, a nation of hostages to fear. People
are suspicious of each other. This was a very intimate killing.
Neighbours in many parts of the country are finding it very difficult to
live with neighbours whom they suspect may have been involved in the
killing.''
In the West, the anniversary of the Rwandan crisis will be marked by a
series of marches, speeches and wreath layings, and a concerted effort
by pressure groups to ensure that the tragedy cannot be repeated
elsewhere.
Their pleas have a special urgency given the escalating tensions in
Burundi, which has the same ethnic mix as Rwanda and the same
bloodstained past.
Their key demand is for a major reform of the UN's peacekeeping and
emergency capabilities and the immediate creation of a rapid deployment
force to respond quickly to such crises.
Many observers, however, including Labour MP Tony Worthington, believe
we are now in a worse position to respond to Burundi and other nations
at risk than we were before the Rwandan tragedy.
''I think we are worse off because the impact of Rwanda and Somalia
has been one of American disillusionment, and a lack of commitment to UN
operations. There has to be a UN rapid reaction force which can get
troops on the ground quickly.''
0 Mr Worthington said aid workers had been warning for months about
the ''utter fragility'' of Burundi.
For Kate Horne of Oxfam, that fragility means she and her colleagues
cannot venture outside after 7pm in Bujumbura, the Burundian capital, or
get to grips with much-needed, long-term aid work.
Burundi has been flirting with anarchy since 1993 following a
presidential assassination. It managed to stay calm after Cyprien
Ntaryamira's death last April and during Rwanda's disintegration, but
tensions have been building steadily. In recent days 400 Hutus in the
north of Burundi were slaughtered and Bujumbura is continually rattled
by sporadic shootings and grenade attacks.
''At the moment we seem to be in a calm period; we have had a very
difficult time over the past couple of weeks,'' said Horne, from her
office in the heart of Bujumbura. ''It's a situation which has been
going on for years. Burundi has kind of rolled from crisis to crisis.
However, everyone does feel it's reached a new level of awfulness here.
''I don't think it could be the same as Rwanda, but I think there is a
genuine fear we could trip over the brink. In the past year we have gone
to the brink several times. It feels now as if we are slipping over bit
by bit.''
The Burundian government is calling for peace and security, but Horne
said much more needed to be done. ''The moderate forces in the
government need to distance themselves from the extremists on either
side who are causing the trouble. It's very tense. People are scared to
be open. People are very afraid. There is a real feeling here that we
are waiting, just waiting.''
In Kigali, Robert Maletta is watching events unfold in Burundi with a
sense of foreboding, and with a feeling that the West is no better
equipped to respond this time around.
''Rwanda and Burundi are part of a piece, their destinies are
linked,'' he said. ''This time is a very fragile time within the
region's history. It's on a knife edge. The region could be tossed into
a whole new human disaster.''

THE annual conference of the OILC offshore union yesterday approved a
re-run of last May's election of office bearers, because the original
was not properly carried out.
Last night Mr Ronnie McDonald, the general secretary of the union,
said that all present officer bearers were now open to challenge and he
hoped that all positions, including his own, would be challenged.
Members of the executive committee who were not elected in last May's
election established a rebel organising committee and complained about
the running of the ballot.
Subsequently the certification officer declared that it had not been
properly carried out because no independent scrutineer had been
appointed.
Yesterday Mr McDonald said the election process was now under way and,
it was hoped, would be completed by the middle of next month.
High on yesterday's conference agenda was a proposed link between OILC
and its Norweg-ian counterpart, OFS.
Although the two unions have decided to strengthen their co-operation,
with the ultimate aim of uniting, such a merger is at least a year away.
OFS board member Mr Peter Bonde told delegates that a final decision,
as far as Norway was concerned, lay with his union's annual congress,
which would be held in March next year.
He stressed that the OFS leadership was convinced the only way forward
was through establishing strong international links.
The conference attracted 30 delegates from 11 offshore installations
and from the Norwegian sector.

AS a motorist who covers some 40,000 miles a year with his job, and
regularly leaves home early on winter mornings, I must take issue with W
R M Brown, who complains about his car being chipped by Strathclyde
region gritting lorries (March 31).
As a district councillor I receive occasional complaints that the
gritters have missed certain roads, but never of damage to cars.
A few little chips on a car is a small price to pay for keeping our
roads safer on freezing winter mornings.

THE Edinburgh Tourist Board is on target to achieve an objective set
five years ago -- a significant increase in off-season business between
October and April.
This was revealed yesterday when figures showed the average hotel
occupancy rose by 3% last year compared to 1993.
An average occupancy of 69% was achieved compared to 57.5% for
Scotland as a whole.
Mr Roger Carter, chief executive of the board, welcomed the increase
and said the outlook was very encouraging.
He added improved communications, including the introduction of a new
ferry route between Amsterdam and Newcastle and major events such as the
Cutty Sark Tall Ships Race, would help business, as would the opening of
the Edinburgh International Conference Centre.

Heriot's FP 11,
Stirling County 11
CHAMPIONS Stirling were held to a draw by Heriot's last night in what
was a postponed McEwan's 70/- league match, writes Alan Lorimer.
If anything emerged from this game it was the problem of a break in
the league coupled with the lack of meaning of this particular match.
Yet both sides contrived to play open rugby on the firm pitch at
Goldenacre, but the momentum which took Stirling to the top had clearly
gone out of the Bridgehaugh side.
Stand-off Alistair Logan put Stirling into an early lead with a
penalty goal, but two penalties by veteran Peter Hewitt gave Heriot's
the lead.
Full back Henry Murray then produced a piece of flair to score a fine
try for Heriot's, whose lead was then cut with a penalty goal from
Stirling's young stand-off Alan Sievwright, who had replaced the injured
Logan.
Stirling, who put together some clever moves, finally got their reward
when under-21 cap Matt McGrandles made a telling break to create a try
for flanker Gordon Mackay.
Sievwright had a chance to put Stirling ahead, but his drop goal
attempt was off target, and right on full time Hewitt, with a shot at
goal, was also wide with his final penalty attempt of the game.
Heriot's FP -- H Murray; H Gilmour, A McRobbie, G Lawrie, P Hewitt; C
Aitken, A Watt; J Bryce, C Turnbull, M Livingstone, P Young, A
Macdonald, C Humphries, R Lockhart, G Dall.
Stirling County -- C Sangster; A Turner, J Wright, M McGrandles, D
Senior; A Logan, M Robertson; J Gibson, G Rutherford, B Robertson, M
Norval, S Hamilton, G Mackay, G Flockhart, B Ireland. Replacement: A
Sievwright for Logan (17min).

Jed-Forest 25,
Melrose 17
WITH Melrose clawing back Jed-Forest's 20-0 interval lead at Riverside
Park, the home side kept their Border League hopes alive with the best
try of the night.
Wingers Kevin Amos and Paul Douglas blistered the turf before Amos
raced in at the corner for the deciding score of a hard fought game.
Melrose started cold and it took them into the second half to get any
control in a hard and often niggling forward struggle.
Jed's hunger for points was satisfied through two early penalties by
Chris Richards and tries by the hard working Ronnie Kirkpatrick and
Michael Pringle, both converted by Richards.
Melrose woke up to impending disaster at the interval and used the
wind to neutralise the Jed-Forest aggression.
Derek Bain, full of imaginative touches, pounced on a misjudgment by
Richards and scored at the post, converting, and then adding a penalty
before carving out a hole for Ross Brown to score. Bain again converted.
But Jed recognised the threat and responded with their match-winning
try. They remain on course for the Border League and look much too good
for second division rugby next year.
Jed-Forest -- C J Richards; K A Amos, H G Hogg, A Douglas, P Douglas;
G Scott, G Goodfellow; N A McIlroy, K W Barrie, R J Johnstone, M
Pringle, A Dunnet, K W Liddle, C J Brown, R M Kirkpatrick.
Melrose -- I Leighton; N White, A Purves, R Brown, A Redburn; D Bain,
D Shiel; D Lunn, S Scott, M Browne, E Simpson, R Brown, S Brotherstone,
A Kerr, S Aitken. Replacement -- A Tait for N White (64min).

A FRIEND and I once watched Martin Scorsese's laborious masterpiece
The Last Temptation of Christ. After hours and hours Willem Dafoe's
Christ finally raised his head, cried ''It is accomplished'', and died.
Roll credits. We both jumped to our feet and praised the Lord! The same
effect arrived with the Scottish Youth Theatre's worthy but weary
adaptation of Christ's Passion. It may aspire to be heavenly but at
times it was hellish.
The script, stitched together by Tony Harrison, is a patchwork of
medieval storytelling derived from the mystery plays of ancient Britain.
They get the name because the language is so dense and clogged with
alliteration and puns that you're left shaking your head, thinking;
''It's a mystery to me.'' It's a tribute to the young actors' skills
that they could remember the lines, though many were lost to the
auditorium.
The cast is divided into saints and sinners. The saints include
Victoria Johnston's Jesus, and while two other males play the Son of
Man, hers is the most human. Others who floated were Caroline McKay's
chilling Cayphas and Elsie Shaw's Marcellus. She earned her wings for
fighting through a fire alarm to deliver a final moving monologue.
The guard's were the ones most in need of confession. It's bad enough
to nail God's son to the cross, but playing pantomime villains was to
add insult to injury. A few were so over the top that they looked out of
their trees. Yet with the cringes were corresponding moments of magic,
like Pilate's final scene with the saviour, which proved that The
Passion was not beyond redemption.

SPEAKING as someone who has yet to master the technique involved in
setting a video cassette recorder, all this talk about surfing the
internet has passed me by. It is all right technology being developed
for the sake of it but it makes commercial sense for it to be adapted
for use by the greatest number of people.
One way in which it seems people will be able fairly easily to use
what's become known as the information superhighway is via cable.
Increasingly, the barrier between information, entertainment, and
communications is becoming blurred with the emergence of a package of
integrated services.
Like me you have probably had the path in front of your house dug up,
and possibly the tree roots cut through, as the cable infrastructure is
laid. There are currently around 83 franchises in operation around the
UK including CableTel, which serves much of Glasgow.
The industry is currently spending around #2000m a year on building
the cable network which is expected to cover around one-third of the UK
by the end of the year. The UK cable industry has passed five million
homes and has signed up around 22% of homes passed and marketed.
However, there is still a high dropout or ''churn'' rate, with some
cable companies losing nearly half their subscribers each year.
It is early days yet but already the UK cable industry has developed
into a major business. In the long term up to 25,000 people may need to
be employed, mainly in sales, marketing, and customer services.
If a wider audience is to be won over to the merits of cable in the
short term then the software or products for use on the system will need
to be developed. So far, cable operators have installed over 700,000
lines in over 50 areas, equivalent to a penetration rate of around 30%,
far ahead of earlier expectations.
Cable is giving BT, which effectively still has a monopoly in the
residential telephone market, a run for its money. Typically cable
telephony works out 10-20% cheaper than BT for a service that provides
itemised monthly billing.
Cable telephony switches customers between the existing Mercury and BT
networks, depending on which one is the cheaper for a particular
destination call. As new telephone operators come into the market they
will also technically be able to be accessed by cable. One factor which
would undoubtedly boost the growth rate of cable telecommunications is
number portability. This enables customers to keep their own telephone
numbers when they change operators. BT's slowness to introduce number
portability, despite the request of the regulator, suggests it
recognises the greater attraction of the cable service to customers.
However, many people, particularly businesses, do not want the hassle
or expense of informing everyone of their new phone number and so choose
to stick with BT.
Cable television is currently a less attractive option unless you are
interested in sport or imported soap operas. Relative to the existing
terrestrial channels, cable television appears poor value for money at
around #12 per month for the basic service. However there are signs that
more and hopefully better UK-derived programming will soon be available.
Recent entrants to the market include Associated Newspapers, Mirror
Group, and SelecTV, makers of popular programs such as Birds of a
Feather and Lovejoy. Eventually we could see much more regional
programming from the cable operators.
While it is early days yet, numerous fields have the potential to be
transformed by the ability to offer a range of services over the cable
network, not just entertainment and telephony. The UK cable industry is
unique in being able to offer telephony and television services as a
result of liberalisation of our telecommunications sector.
Applications for cable's interactive ability include home shopping,
computer training from home, a service which will support developments
in tele-commuting, and where cable systems cover university towns, local
education channels and links to the university libraries are planned.
Initiatives with schools are already under way with the possibility of
video-conferencing between schoolchildren in the UK and US.
Interactive television is already installed in some systems to allow
for impulse pay-per-view for films and sporting events and
customer-controlled television where the viewer can actually produce the
programme they are watching by selecting from a range of various camera
angles.
However, it strikes me that, as with all new technologies, as a
consumer it is probably best to wait a few years until the technology
has settled down and better-value, more attractive products are
available.

FIVE elderly patients have died after an outbreak of an unknown virus
at a hospital in the Channel Islands, health officials said yesterday.
Two wards at Castel Hospital, Guernsey, have been closed to new
admissions after 28 other patients and six members of staff also became
ill.
The local health department is monitoring the situation and samples
have been sent to the mainland for analysis.
Doctors believe the virus is a more virulent strain of one which has
been spreading through the island. The virus results in a chest
infection with accompanying fatigue, cough, and raised temperature.
Castel Hospital, which had a similar but smaller outbreak in 1993, is
a psychiatric unit.

A CYCLIST has claimed traffic police banned him from listening to his
personal stereo.
Mr Richard McMichael said he was stopped near the Claypotts junction
in Dundee on Saturday evening.
Mr McMichael, 27, said that he was warned he would be charged with
driving without due care and attention if he was spotted wearing his
headphones again.
He said yesterday: ''I couldn't believe this. I was just cycling along
listening to Roy Orbison when I saw flashing lights and I was pulled
over.
''I thought it was a joke. There are people driving about in
double-glazed BMWs with their stereos blaring. I don't see them being
stopped.
''I'm definitely going to keep on wearing my personal stereo when I'm
riding my bike. I've been passed by loads of police cars before and I've
never been stopped.''
He claimed: ''The policeman even told me he charged a cyclist for the
same thing only the day before.''
Mr McMichael, a waiter, of Strathmartine Road, Dundee, added: ''I was
lectured about this for 10 minutes.''
However, Sergeant Alexander Shand, of Tayside Police traffic
department, said there was nothing illegal about wearing a personal
stereo while cycling.
He added: ''As far as I'm aware there's no specific legislation, but I
personally wouldn't advise loud music even in a car. It could contribute
to an accident if a driver or a cyclist's attention was distracted.''
The AA motoring organisation also spoke out against cyclists wearing
headphones.
A spokesman said: ''It is stated in the Highway Code that you
shouldn't wear a personal stereo. We also recommend that car drivers do
not have their stereos up too loud.''

FARMERS are continuing to win the battle to contain pollution but much
more needs to be done, a senior National Rivers Authority spokesman said
yesterday.
Incidents in England and Wales had fallen from more than 4000 in 1988
to around 3000 a year, although last year saw a rise to 3400 mainly due
to weather conditions, according Geoff Batemen of the NRA's south
western region.
More important, what were described as serious incidents had fallen
from 99 to 36 in the past four years. Scotland has an estimated 500
water pollution incidents from farming a year.
But rules are getting tighter and pressure on the land is expected to
become much greater with the ban on dumping sewage at sea due to come in
by 1998. Many authorities are expected to increase the amount of sludge
recycled to farm land.
The good news is that these waste products have a positive value.
Speaking at the industry's bienniel muck event at the National
Agricultural Centre in Warwickshire, Peter Redman of the Agricultural
Development and Advisory Service estimated that something like 80
million tonnes of farm waste were produced south of the border each
year, with a potential fertiliser value of about #200m.
Mark Aitken, specialist adviser on environmental resources with the
Scottish Agricultural College, reckoned that a typical dairy farm
produced about a million litres of cattle slurry a year. This could be
doubled when parlour washes were added in.
Mr Redman said that most of the major problems attached to storage,
handling and disposal had been overcome, although there was a need for
more work in direct injection into the soil. There was still a tendency
to expect the soil to do too much in absorbing the waste material,
particularly in wet seasons.
Earl Howe, Junior Agriculture Minister, announced the ministry was
continuing to fund a #2m research and development programme to improve
farm waste disposal and reduce pollution. This included a new three-year
research programme with an annual budget of #750,000 to improve
conservation of nitrogen during storage, and develop rapid assessment on
nitrogen content of manures as well as application techniques.
The Scottish Agricultural College is continuing to research methods of
utilising some of the 30 million tonnes of organic waste produced in
Scotland every year. Results so far indicate that correctly managed
sludge has minimal environmental risks and is a good organic fertiliser.
Alternative uses for organic wastes also include soil conditioning, as
compost or as a fuel.

PUBLIC or private? The political debate has travelled beyond the
railways to the big branch line of education with confirmation yesterday
that Scotland's biggest independent school, George Watson's College in
Edinburgh, recently approached three local authority schools in Lothian
region about establishing closer links with the state sector.
The notion of state and private schools getting together for the
benefit of pupils should not come as a surprise. It is not so long since
the Labour monolith of Strathclyde region was approached by independent
schools and Jordanhill school -- funded directly by the Scottish Office
-- about providing them with curriculum and management support through
the authority's advisory service.
Strathclyde councillors saw no reason to turn down the request, as
long as there was slack in the take-up of courses from the region's
schools and the recipients paid for the service. In the event, little
happened because the advisory service was restructured and advisors had
more than enough on their plates to meet demand from the region's
schools.
But the principle had been conceded. Other things have happened to
blur the line between public and private education. The Scottish Office
has invited independent headteachers to take part in the policy-making
process on curriculum developments.
And, since we are talking about principle, politics must come into
play. That is the theory, anyway. Practice is different. Labour leader
Tony Blair has flown in the face of party policy -- at least in Scotland
-- by sending his son to an opted-out school in London. Although
opted-out schools remain under state control, Mr Blair has also
authorised discussions with the independent sector which could result in
some fee-paying schools coming into the state sector in England.
Independent schools are subject to the vagaries of the market. They
must attract pupil fees if they are to survive, and the inference from
Labour's recent approach was that schools which were not pulling in
sufficient numbers would be embraced by the state.
Is this behind George Watson's wooing? In a word, no. The school, with
a roll of more than 2100 pupils, is popular with parents. And
headteacher Frank Gerstenberg says he does not want to join the state
sector.
The independent sector in Scotland caters for the education of 4% of
Scotland's pupils. According to the Independent Schools Information
Service (Isis), 16% of secondary school pupils in the fee-paying sector
are on the assisted places scheme, the Government's initiative which
gives less well off families the opportunity to send their children to
private schools by giving income-related assistance towards the cost of
tuition fees and other expenses.
According to data compiled by Ayrshire Labour MP Brian Donohoe, George
Watson's is one of four big city day schools -- three of which are in
Edinburgh -- to receive more than #500,000 a year under the scheme.
Calling recently for the scrapping of the scheme, he said that, far from
being independent, most private schools were highly dependent on the
public sector for their existence.
Labour is committed to abolishing the scheme and cynics may conclude
that George Watson's is looking to establish academic, sporting, and
social links with state schools as a means of finding alternative
funding to what is undoubtedly a lucrative source of income. Mr
Gerstenberg fears the potential demise of the scheme, but for social
rather than financial reasons. He says he does not want the school to
become more ''snooty''.
''George Watson's and other independent schools want to make certain
that they do not become elitist under a Labour Government,'' Rose Bell,
Isis director in Scotland, said yesterday. ''Schools would not
necessarily lose out enormously in financial terms because they might be
able to fill these places with fee-paying pupils, but they would lose
out in the range of pupil personalities and backgrounds, which they
value.
''We should not minimise the fact that pupils do come with their
Government subsidy, but from the number of enquiries we get I have
little doubt that these places could be filled.''
Dr Brian Boyd, co-director of Strathclyde University's Quality in
Education Centre, believes the independent sector must become more
involved in state education if it is to avoid being isolated on
curricular developments. ''There are many differences between the
sectors, but if pupils can benefit in terms of teaching methods, the
curriculum, and the ethos of achievement, then forming links would seem
to be legitimate.''

THIS week's egg-on-face award goes to BBC Scotland's drama queen
Andrea Calderwood. Introducing a press screening at the Glasgow Film
Theatre for the new series of Queen Margaret Drive's very own
blood-soaked hospital drama Cardiac Arrest she stood in front of a
screen bearing the legend: ''The video facilities in this cinema are
sponsored by Scottish Television.'' Alerted by the resultant sniggers
Calderwood blanched at this advert for the opposition and promptly
called cut.
* MEANWHILE Calderwood's colleagues in the Arts and Music Department
enjoyed a more successful outing at the Celtic Film and Television
Festival in Fort William, picking up a Best Documentary gong yesterday
for the Ex-S programme Just Another Sinner. It was a somewhat ironic
victory. The portrait of Scots psychiatrist R D Laing has had to fight
for a network slot, due to be granted at the end of the month on the
proviso that 10 minutes are cut from Eleanor Yule's 50-minute film --
against metropolitan incomprehension that has found an echo in this
week's Panorama shenanigans.
Yule and her team found telling parallels between Laing's work on
schizophrenia and the split personality of the family he left behind.
Alas, the same division is now detectable in the BBC, where the
Glasgow-based organisation finds itself increasingly at odds with the
BBC in London.
Gift of the
Milk-Snatcher
A TELLING lesson for Marlwood Secondary School in Thornbury, Avon,
which attempted to raise funds with a charity auction. The school wrote
begging letters to 25 authors of recent noted autobiographies, asking
for the donation of a signed copy.
Twenty-four signed tomes were duly despatched but the twenty-fifth
author merely and rather meanly sent a signed photo, with a note
instructing the school board to ''buy your own copy of the book and
stick this photo inside''.
Surprise, surprise the frugal author in question was one Lady
Thatcher, who many deem responsible for the erosion in education budgets
which has forced schools like Marlwood to resort to such charity-raising
stunts.
Short-stay site
SPOTTED in last week's Hamilton Advertiser -- an advertisement for
Sandylands Caravan Park, which gives new depths to the twentieth-century
curse of built-in obsolescence. The Land of Sandy is clearly an
Honest-Joe kind of business for while it boasts about having fully sited
caravan homes for under two grand it also warns, in a guilt-stricken
postscript, that ''they DO NOT last long''. Just in case you thought
that was the retirement home sorted.
Wedded bliss
CURRENTLY suffering from Wedding Fever, the Diary enjoyed the heading
in Dundee's Courier which acccompanied a bridal advertisement spread --
''Important Role of the Male Members''. Yep, pretty crucial to honeymoon
bliss -- but are we being rather old-fashioned in imagining that even
the most modern bride usually contents herself with just the one.
Deepest sympathy
A READER with an admirably black sense of humour informs us that,
subsequent to the death of his father he had to telephone the local
Social Work Area Office to arrange for the uplift of a geriatric chair
and sundry other items. He was duly telephoned by the functionary
employed by Social Work to deliver, pick up, and generally humph things
about.
Humpher: ''This is Social Work. I've had an instruction to phone you
about picking up some things.''
Bereaved Son: ''Yes, there's a geriatric chair, a foot-stool and a
trolley.''
Humpher: ''When can we call to collect them?''
Bereaved Son: ''I'll be there this afternoon. Do you have the
address?''
Humpher: ''Yes. Is Goner the name on the door?''
Bereaved Son: ''What?''
Humpher (impatiently): ''Goner. G-O-N-E-R.''
Bereaved Son (with aforementioned admirable sense of humour): ''I
think you'll find that means recently deceased.''
After a suitably shocked silence, the humpher revealed that this was
the detail on the job card, blaming ''some idiot at the office''.
Loads of dough
FOOD for thought; gremlins in the Helensburgh Advertiser seem to have
made quite a meal of top chef Jeff Bland's recipe for Beef Wellington.
The paper instructs readers to combine 2lbs of beef with a rather
staggering mound of 21lbs of puff pastry, which they reckon would best
be cooked at 200 centimetres. Mind you, we suspect that 21lbs of cooked
puff pastry would probably measure 200 centimetres.
Name game
WE will make scant mention of the fact that Mr David Spittle is the
chairman of Glenrothes Related Fluids Company and that the engineer at
Haden Fire Protection is Mr J Flood, as such is the stuff for seasoned
punsters like Mr Shields, but we were rather tickled to hear that the
BBC reporter who announced the resignation of the Chairman and Deputy
Chairman of Barings on Radio 1FM's news was Tim Swindles.

For more than a decade, research has been going on to find out if
places like Scotland can benefit from the sun's energy -- even though we
do not see much of it! John Linklater examines findings which claim that
we can make use of the star's power, thanks to experiments in muddy
waters.
WHAT is the difference between one of the current generation of solar
power systems and a tiny blob of bacteria at the bottom of a murky pool?
Professor Richard Cogdell has spent 12 years searching for conclusive
evidence to back his hunch. Now his Glasgow University team can confirm
there's no difference, but the bacteria is considerably more efficient.
The research findings are published today in the science journal
Nature, and they are being hailed as one of the most significant
breakthroughs in biology since the discovery of DNA. The team are
presenting the detailed mechanism of the most sophisticated little
energy complex in creation.
It represents the final cracking of a molecular code to discover what
makes the bacteria tick over, powered by the faintest glimmers of light.
Under intense competition in the past six years from a rival team of
former Nobel Prize winners in Munich, the Glasgow researchers have
identified a light-harvesting complex (LH2) which sustains its own
survival and growth on a meagre ration of energising light. It gets on
with the job with much less light energy source than a solar cell
exposed to the most dismal climatic conditions.
The depths of dark pools and muddied streams are treated as veritable
Rivieras by the resourceful bacteria. They offer an exemplary model of
photosynthesis, the process by which virtually all energy enters the
biosphere. It is the means by which all bacteria, algae, and plants
transform the light from the sun into energy.
Since 1988, scientists have known how the chlorophylls in bacteria
carried out the actual conversion of light into electrical energy
through their microscopic reaction centres. This won the Nobel Prize for
Chemistry that year for Michel, Deisenhofer, and Huber at the Max Planck
Institute, Munich. The race has been on to solve the other part of the
equation: how the light was trapped by the antenna system of the
chlorophylls.
The breakthrough came on September 9 last year, and there was
tremendous excitement at the Glasgow University laboratories when they
knew that they had been first to reach the winning line. Their
discovery, supported by the Daresbury Laboratory in Cheshire and funded
by a #500,000 research programme vote of faith by the Biological
Biotechnology Research Council, will provide a blueprint for a superior
breed of solar cells in the future. It could have enormous implications
for global energy conservation.
The Glasgow University team, assembled by Professor Cogdell in the
Institute of Biomedical and Life Sciences and Professor Neil Isaacs in
the Department of Chemistry, was able to establish that the
light-harvesting complex (LH2) in bacteria transfers energy from one
molecule to another with 95% efficiency. Man-made solar cells currently
operate at only 20% efficiency.
Professor Cogdell compares LH2 with the large collecting dish of a
radio telescope. It feeds the waves to the reaction centre, which acts
like a transducer changing incoming radio signals. The range and
sensitivity of this microscopic collecting dish is the difference
between bacteria and solar cells. The man-made item functions if there
is direct sunshine. To increase efficiency it will be a case of
returning to the drawing-board, using the molecular structure as a new
guide for the future.
Professor Cogdell explains: ''If you could put a light-harvesting
complex into your solar cell you'd increase the dynamic range of light
intensities through which the thing would work. So if you look at our
structure, it provides a lot of the clues as to how you would make a
good chemical analogue.
''What we can learn is how to store the light energy that can be used,
how to ensure that the transfer to the reaction centre that transduces
it into electrical energy is an efficient process -- and how you can
broaden the spectrum of light that can drive the device, different
wavelengths, and a broadening of light.
''I think this gives us a chance now to allow solar power to be used
as a source of energy in areas where there has not always been
continuous bright sunshine.''
How little sunshine? Even in climates, such as our own, which have
been encroached by the dreaded SAD (Seasonally Affected Disorder), how
little sunshine are we granted?
''That's almost impossible to say at this stage because it depends on
how clever you are at making a robust chemical analogue which will do
this job. We are still only at the stage of saying this is how the
bacteria does it and here's how the bacteria solves the problems
involved in light-harvesting. Now, can we make a chemical analogue which
will be as efficient?''
It is a challenge that will be taken up immediately, a problem of
chemical synthesis. The vital information is literally hot off the
academic presses this morning, so it represents new shafts of light that
the solar power industry must absorb and see if it can convert into
improvements.
Professor Cogdell continues: ''Currently solar systems work very well
if you live in somewhere like Israel where there's bright sunny weather
for most of the year. On many roofs you will see solar panels. That
works fine, it doesn't need to be improved. What you would like to do is
extend its applicability to countries where you don't have full bright
sunshine all the time.
''So if you could make the whole thing working with, let's say,
tenfold -- a hundredfold -- less light-energy coming in, then you begin
to be quite competitive. Then you have a chance of using it in Britain.
''I don't think it is something you could ever use exclusively. But
you could provide a reasonable amount of input on a regular basis to
supplement the use of fossil fuels. I don't know if it would ever become
quite central, because you still have 12 hours of night, but it
certainly would make a useful contribution to saving on fossil fuels.''
The Glasgow Uniersity team helped establish the efficiency of the
light-harvesting bacteria

AN Army lorry driver who claimed she was discharged after she had told
her commanding officer she was pregnant has been awarded #16,000
compensation.
Mrs Rosemary Gale, 32, told a Glasgow industrial tribunal that she had
been offered the chance of an abortion, which she refused. Two days
later she was out of the Army.
She said that her pregnancy had been entirely unexpected since she had
been taking oral contraceptives.
Mrs Gale, who moved to Grantham, Lincolnshire, from Scotland earlier
this year, said it had been made clear to her that the choice was
between having an abortion and remaining in the Army, or keeping the
baby and leaving.
At the time her partner, a soldier, was in Norway on exercises for
three months.
She complained she had received no help from the Army and when she was
put out she had had nowhere to live.
She married her partner on his return and they both moved into married
quarters. Her daughter was born prematurely in August 1985 and had to
stay in hospital for between eight and nine weeks.
Mrs Gale, of Gonerby Hill Foot, Grantham, said she was very angry at
her discharge and the lack of any offer of help from the Army. She felt
the Army ''just didn't want to know'' after she revealed that she was
pregnant. She said that if she could have returned to the Army she would
have done so.
She moved to Berlin with her husband and obtained a job as a waitress
in an Army officers' mess, but was later made redundant.
The tribunal was told she had hoped to take a staff-car driving course
before she was discharged and had expected to be promoted to
lance-corporal. She had also intended to serve in the Army for 22 years.
She had joined in July 1, 1983 and was discharged in 1985, at which time
she held the rank of private.
The Ministry of Defence conceded that Mrs Gale had been discriminated
against on the grounds of her sex when discharged. Therefore the
tribunal had only to decide the level of compensation payable.
It concluded that Mrs Gale would have returned to the service after
the birth of her daughter had she been allowed to do so.
However the tribunal ruled that it was not realistic to conclude that
she would have remained in the Army for 22 years. While her performance
was satisfactory, there was nothing to suggest she would have achieved
higher rank, and would, in all probability, have resigned in December
1988 when her husband left the service.
The tribunal awarded Mrs Gale compensation of #16,211, including #1500
for injury to her feelings.

THIS column is the last place you will ever hear a word against the
saintly Alf Young. Anyone who earns a living writing about economics --
the journalistic equivalent of home trepanning -- and combines it with
the irritating habit of being right all the time, gets no argument here.
On this occasion, though, we must all pray like incontinent Mormons that
he's dead wrong.
On Monday, Alf reported that there are plans afoot to establish a
Scottish Heritage Park somewhere between Perth and Stirling. The price
tag is said to be #80m and the Millennium Commission, sugar daddy to a
nation, is being asked to pick up most of the tab. If your heart did not
sink to the basement at the thought, I'll have what you're drinking.
Just think of it: a 150-acre theme park featuring such typical
features of wir culture as genuinely fake castles, the clan system, a
distillery, a woollen mill, a Highland village, and (be still my heart)
a wax museum. The Scottish Tourist Board is thrilled to bits (never a
good sign) and various entrepreneurs are enthusiastic. The project is so
entirely appalling it will almost certainly come to pass.
Don't misunderstand: theme parks are all very well. Live in Edinburgh
and you understand that some of them are even habitable. But the idea
that the life and times of this silly wee nation can be compressed into
an exhibition, tied off with a tartan ribbon and flogged off to
foreigners as the real McNaff, surely calls for intervention by the
United Nations.
All sorts of rows are predictable, and we might as well start them
now. Since there is no copyright on nationhood, no-one is in a position
to prevent the project from going ahead. On the other hand, since there
is as yet no statute of limitations on ridicule, we are each entitled to
add our tuppence-worth to the debate in the hope that, as the heritage
industry anthem has it, someone will proceed directly homewards, and
think again.
Mills and stills are all very well. Will there be room, though, for a
working model of a nearly-new housing scheme, complete with decorative
dead junkies and certified damp? Can we hope to see an authentic
shipyard, a successful football team, a model parliament? Will there be
genuine drunken lairds wandering around to tell visitors to get orff the
land they are holding in trust for the nation, and souvenir Trident
missiles for the Americans to take home?
No, let's try, just this once, to be helpful. If the promoters of
Brigadoon 95 are serious, they may find some of the following concepts
worth running up the flagpole just to see who sings Scots Wha Hae and
salutes.
The BBC Scotland Roller-coaster. A unique attraction, this ride will
rise to great heights before plummeting to the depths and staying there.
The novelty of this concept is that no-one on board ever knows where he
is going and everyone is permanently in the dark.
The Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party. Under the terms of the
Sunday Times (Scotland) Act 1995, we are prevented from suggesting that
both of Scotland's endangered sincere Tories be housed in the vermin
enclosure. It may be possible, however, to find room in the wax museum
for Sir Michael Hirst's collection of excuses.
Higher Education. An interactive, multi-media experience through which
visitors will learn to speak perfect English, forget their history
entirely, and sell themselves to the highest bidder. Notes on what the
democratic intellect used to be may be provided.
The White Settler Show. A shoot 'em up video game in which players
will be able to wound innocent strangers with sticks, stones, and
disgusting names. All targets guaranteed easy to hit, but no prizes for
winning.
Religion: the Mystery Tour. Ageing juveniles with exotic psycho-sexual
problems will be on hand to suggest to each visitor that we're all
doomed, the world is sinful, and things aren't what they used to be. God
Himself will be available in the General Assembly virtual reality
exhibit to explain that Scottish churches have nothing whatever to do
with him. Preconceptions provided.
The Kent His Faither Restaurant. Here visitors will be given the
opportunity to disparage every new recipe offered and pull to bits the
best that Scotland can offer, while dining off the reputations of anyone
who ever did anything. Ancestry an advantage.
Monarchists of the Glen. An exhibition of still lives without
parallel, each depicting distinguished Nationalists in various
deferential poses explaining why an independent Scotland would break
from London yet remain a loyal, not to say grovelling, member of the
Commonwealth.
Finally the Devolution Maze, in living Blairvision. A working model of
the Labour Party, responding to every button you press, will tie itself
in knots each hour on the hour, while four dozen lifelike MPs
''strengthen the Union''  with string, sticking plaster, and bits of old
policies.
That ought to do it. What more, this side of self-respect, could
anyone ask for?

A SPLIT from the Scottish Fishermen's Federation by the Scottish White
Fish Producers' Association remains a possibility, despite statements
yesterday from both sides that it was hoped this could be avoided.
The threat of fracture coincided with a move by Canada, which
yesterday urged the European Union to approve an agreement to end their
feud over fishing in the North Atlantic, warning it would otherwise act
on its own to save threatened fish stocks.
Following a meeting of the federation in Edinburgh to discuss Europe's
Common Fishing Policy (CFP), Mr Tom Hay, chairman of the association,
insisted his members wanted to work with the federation.
In a strongly-worded statement, however, he said the SFF had thrown
away the greatest opportunity it had ever had to demonstrate to its
members that it was prepared to stand up and fight for their survival.
It had also, by re-affirming its position in stepping back from the
Save Britain's Fish campaign, landed itself with a grave responsibility,
having divorced itself from the majority of its members, albeit in
accord with its constitution.
Mr Hay said the committee looking at reforming the common fisheries
policy would have advocated getting rid of the equal access and common
resource principles, which were the origins of the present disaster in
the fishing industry, before British fishermen were convinced they had
not been conned once again.
Later, he admitted the threat of a split remained and further
developments would be discussed by the association board next week.
Earlier, Mr Bob Allan, the federation's chief executive, said the
meeting had re-affirmed its position on the campaign because it was
thought to be politically unachievable.
While there was not a great deal of difference in the perceptions of
both sides, it had been decided to look at ways of addressing the CFP,
which he felt was in need of change. However, the question of the
association going on its own had not arisen so far.
Meanwhile, Canada has opted for immediate action to save its
threatened fish stocks, urging the EU to approve a deal to end their
feud over North Atlantic fishing rights.
''We'll wait a number of days, but we're not prepared to wait
forever,'' Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin said. ''After that we do
whatever is required to save the stock.''
Tobin's words have been backed by action. Canadian vessels seized a
Spanish factory trawler on March 9, accusing it of overfishing, and
later cut the nets of another, enraging the EU but gaining its
attention.
The EU and Canada have reached a draft accord that an EU official said
could be presented to EU foreign ministers on Monday.
Spanish boats have meanwhile continued to scoop up Greenland halibut,
or turbot, off the coast of Newfoundland in international waters where
Canada has unilaterally declared a moratorium.
* All lines to the British consulate in Barcelona were jammed for
several hours yesterday after a radio station urged listeners to protest
at Britain's support for Canada in the turbot war. ''We put the
answering machine on. There were hundreds of callers all blowing
raspberries,'' said an official.
* A new licensing scheme is being introduced to limit the number of
fish factory ships in Scottish waters in the wake of concern over the
the activities of the klondikers, mainly from Eastern Europe.
The Scottish Office Fisheries Minister, Sir Hector Monro, said the new
licences would be issued only to factory vessels with a contract to
receive fish. No more than 60 licences will be issued for herring in the
this year's season and 70 for next winter's mackerel fishing.

Dr John Peters looks for a link between arthritis and what we eat
A QUESTION I am often asked is: ''Will changing my diet help may
arthritis, doctor?'' A good question. And one which will exercise the
minds of many top rheumatologists from Britain and the rest of the world
as they converge on the SECC this week.
The British Society for Rheumatology has brought its annual meeting to
Glasgow for the first time since 1976, and tomorrow's early morning
session, chaired by Glasgow's own Professor of Rheumatology, Roger
Sturrock, will address that very issue.
In the past, the whole idea would have been dismissed by any
self-respecting practitioner. Meantime, one-third of his/her patients
would be blaming ''flare-ups'' of their arthritis on last night's supper
drink or one banana too many in their omelette. Surveys show that
one-quarter of arthritic patients manipulate their diet in a quest for
pain relief.
Gradually, however, the stodgy world of medicine is beginning to take
seriously the possibility that diet could play a part in causing
flare-ups of arthritis, or even sparking the disease in the first place.
This seems only reasonable, since we know so little about the triggers
for such diseases as rheumatoid arthritis it would be foolish blindly to
dismiss any possibilities.
Rheumatoid arthritis (often termed RA) is fairly common -- affecting
roughly one person in a hundred -- and is the classical ''inflammatory''
arthritis with which other rarer conditions are often compared. It
differs from the much commoner osteoarthritis -- itself a badly
understood ''wear and tear'' phenomenon -- in having active inflammation
in the joints. There are a number of conditions where the body's immune
system is somehow stimulated so that it attacks the patient's own
tissues. In RA, the tissues attacked are mainly in the joints.
What sets off this ''auto-immune'' process? What makes our defence
mechanisms start treating the body's own tissues like some invading
organism?
One theory is that RA may indeed start with an infection which the
immune system fights off. Perhaps one of the proteins in the
bacterium/virus/whatever ''looks'' like one of the proteins in the
patient's own tissues. The activated immune system thus finds another
apparent invader to repel.
Foodstuffs also contain ''foreign'' proteins, and it is well known
that the body's defences can cause harm by over-reacting to these -- as
seen in various sorts of allergic reactions. Could rheumatoid arthritis
be a long-term allergy? If it is, would withdrawing the ''triggering
antigen'' be too late for help?
Medical writers first suggested back in the 1930s that RA might be a
product of food allergy. Predictably, the medical establishment quickly
decried ''bizarre dietary measures based on doubtful premises''. To be
fair, the past 60 years have failed to make the establishment look
foolish. No-one has proven that food allergy is a serious contender as a
cause for arthritis.
Anecdotes there are aplenty. A Dr Dong, on developing arthritis
himself, decided that modern foodstuffs were to blame, and reverted to
''a traditional Chinese diet'' which excluded dairy products, alcohol,
spices, and additives and included very little meat. A dramatic recovery
prompted him to share his experience with the world, and the ''Dong
Diet'' became a topic of heated conversation in many a GP waiting room.
Some people it seemed to help, others it didn't. Here lies the problem.
Arthritis is a changeable disease -- good one day, bad the next; good
one week, bad the next -- and it is difficult to tell whether any
treatment, be it diet or drug, is really helping.
Medicine's normal answer to this is, of course, the ''controlled
trial''. One group of patients takes the drug while another takes a
placebo but thinks it might be taking the drug. The performances of the
two groups are then compared.
Unfortunately, all of these attempts have just failed to convince, at
least for the time being, that food allergy is at the root of rheumatoid
arthritis.
If we don't know whether food can cause arthritis, do we know if they
can make it better or worse? In this area, modern research may be making
some inroads. Much of this concerns the role of ''Prostaglandins'', sort
of short-acting hormones which, among other things, play a major part in
producing inflammation in joints.
Different prostaglandins cause inflammation to a different extent, and
some even have an anti-flammatory action. Prostaglandins are made in the
body from fatty acids in the food we eat, and different prostaglandins
are made from different fatty acids. We now know that ''inflammatory''
prostaglandins are made from the fatty acids in red meat (eg,
arachidonic acid), while the fatty acids in chicken and fish
(eicosapentanoic acid) go to make the ''nice'' prostaglandins.
Did Dr Dong get this bit right? Many patients feel their joints are
worse if they eat red meat.
Researchers are now taking things a stage further and seeing if
positive benefits can be obtained by supplementing the nice fatty acids
from fish oils.
Other dietary constituents suggested as helpful to arthritis sufferers
include vitamin C and vitamin E. The latter first came to notice in 1969
as a peculiarly effective placebo in Israeli trials of a new
anti-inflammatory. Vitamin E, however, has failed to match this success
story in further studies.
As yet, the question of diet does not play a major part in the
management of significant arthritis, and it would be unwise to follow
dietary anecdotes to the exlcusion of conventional treatment. It is
gratifying, however, to note that the research into some of the above
therapies has taken place in Glasgow. The British Society of
Rheumatology has returned after almost 20 years to a community open to
unconventional ideas both old and new. On our own legal terminology, the
case for a link between diet and arthritis is not yet proven, but has
also yet to be dismissed.

Some may sniff at the use of body odours to combat disease but Ann
Shaw has found out that there could be more to it than meets the nose.
IMAGINE walking into your doctor's surgery and having a computer smell
you. Science fiction? No, says Dr George Dodd, a scientist with a
lifelong interest in smells. His ambition is to help design a computer
to analyse disease.
''Many people give off smells. The challenge of the computer is to be
able to separate and analyse those smells.''
Labelled the Daddy of Electronic Nose Technology, it sometimes leads
to confusion. After Dodd appeared on a recent radio programme he had
people writing in asking for electronic noses because their sense of
smell had gone.
He moved to Inverness last August from Warwick University after a
quarter of a century researching smells. He is regarded as something of
a world olfactory expert, or a professional sniffer to be more blunt,
combining the roles of perfumier and researcher.
His aim is to create a new institute for body odour imaging at the
Highlands Psychiatric Research Group, based at Craig Dunain Hospital in
Inverness.
But first he has to raise #1m capital. So far he has managed to get
#300,000 for Glasgow University's Department of Micro-Electronics,
where, under Professor John Barker, they are looking into the use of an
electronic nose for farm management.
''What we are aiming to do is replicate a sniffer dog,'' says Dr Dodd.
''You've only got to give a dog a few seconds of a sniff and it can find
something. We don't know yet how it's done.''
The aim is to design a computer cleverer than a sniffer dog.
He is reasonably confident that soon we will be able to diagnose at
least one disease fairly soon, probably cirrhosis of the liver. Other
diseases will follow, probably lung cancer, which gives off a pungent
smell, along with diabetes. Schizophrenia is another disease that emits
a distinctive smell.
If Dodd's hypothesis is correct, it does open up the potential for
early detection of disease and, therefore, a better chance of a cure.
Is this not all a bit pie in the sky? Not at all, asserts Dodd.
''You've only to look at sniffer dogs.'' (He is very fond of drawing the
analogy with sniffer dogs). ''If a dog can pick up a scent in a few
seconds why not a computer?'' True.
Sniffing out disease is not new. The Chinese have used the method for
thousands of years. Even today part of the clinical diagnosis should you
visit a Chinese doctor is that he or she will smell you.
But what about perfume, body odour, and foods such as garlic, will not
these disguise the underlying illness? Again, Dodd trots out the sniffer
dog. ''They can tell the difference. All that is needed is a computer
with as sophisticated a brain as a dog. It's all a question of
unravelling the chemistry.''
brain is a complex part of the body that does not give up its secrets
easily. ''That's the challenge of research,'' says Dodd optimistically.
''With enough time and money we can solve them.''
He is certainly a man of ideas: ''Imagine breathing down the telephone
and having your breath analysed for disease by a computer at the other
end.''
Far fetched? Not so, says Dodd, the Daddy of Electronic Nose
Technology, oozing enthusiasm. The EU is already considering a #1m
application from a group of scientists, yes he is among them, based in
Inverness, to look into this very project.
After all, telemedicine is already established in the Highlands where
doctors can call up patients living in remote areas, or off-shore on oil
rigs, on-screen. If this current application is successful it will take
telemedicine a step further.
''We are, of course, talking twenty-first-century technology,'' added
Dodd.
His academic credentials are good. Born in Dublin, he took a degree in
chemistry and followed this up with a PhD in biochemistry at Oxford. For
the past 20 years he has been doing olfactory research at Warwick
University. He fell in love with the Scottish Highlands while on a
walking holiday as a student.
Now he has succeeded in his life's ambition of combining his love of
the outdoors with that of scientific research; all made possible by
computers.
But isn't Inverness a little off the beaten track for setting up a
research centre? Dodd quickly foils the question: ''Look, Dundee
University got a grant for #20m the other day to look into molecular
medicine, snatched from under the noses of other universities. Why?
Because they are lean and hungry. What Dundee can do today Inverness can
do tomorrow.''
Already an electronic nose exists to smell beer. Not only does it
differentiate between different types of beer but also quality.
So, if an electronic nose already exists for drink then one for
disease can't be too far behind . . .

Paris, Wednesday
FRENCH Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, closing the polls gap with
conservative front-runner Jacques Chirac, told his supporters today he
was confident of making it through to the May 7 presidential election
run-off.
The prospect of a bruising clash between the two Gaullists, the
Right's worst nightmare, looked increasing likely and the premier told
campaigners at a Paris hotel they would meet again the day after the
April 23 first-round ballot.
Only the two top-scoring candidates qualify for the run-off.
Mobilising his forces for a last offensive, Balladur accused Chirac of
making glib promises which lacked credibility, and of stoking up
baseless polemics.
As Balladur was speaking, demonstrators burst into his campaign
headquarters on the Left Bank.--Reuter.

<HEADLINE>New deal planned for armed forces.  Defence chiefs urged to introduce performance-related pay and abolish certain ranks.</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>JAMES MCKILLOP</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>11</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979026175</RECORDNO>

SERVICEMEN and women were last night studying a revolutionary report
which calls for the introduction of performance-related pay into the
armed forces and the abolition of various ranks -- including those of
Field Marshal, Admiral of the Fleet, and Air Marshal.
Ministers are being urged to adopt a three-stage career structure for
the armed services -- the so-called ''three ages of man'' -- and to
introduce benefits including a new pension scheme.
The report is a radical overhaul of the military's outdated personnel
management system and is designed to produce a service structure for the
21st century.
It offers the prospect of a more stable lifestyle for those in the
services, with obvious benefits to families. It envisages, for example,
that service people should be able to live in one home for a period of
five years.
However, it also calls for the abolition of long-standing allowances
and perks, including free meals and payments for travel to work.
The lavish lifestyle of some senior officers serving abroad would also
disappear as military life is brought more into line with conditions in
the civilian world.
Mr Michael Bett, a former deputy chairman of British Telecom, led the
four-man team which spent a year consulting ministers and service
personnel before producing their independent review, Managing People in
Tomorrow's Armed Forces.
Yesterday Mr Bett insisted that the proposals had to be treated as a
package. There could be no cherry-picking -- selecting those
recommendations which saved money and ignoring those that would involve
additional expenditure.
''That would mean that there would be some downs as well as ups,'' he
said in a message to servicemen and women.
''Where possible we have recommended a greater element of choice for
the individual and that allowances should be as even-handed as possible
between married and single people.
''All in all, we are confident that the overall effect of our
recommendations would be to enhance the quality of life for servicemen
and women and their families.''
Last night there was unanimity on one thing: the review was both
imaginative and thoughtful. It contains 151 recommendations and covers
the whole field of rank, career structures, pay and allowances,
pensions, housing, and accommodation policies.
While defence chiefs were hoping that the review would be given
greater consideration than that given by police officers to the Sheehy
report, Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind was at pains to point out that
the Government had not yet taken a view on any of the recommendations.
In proposing the merger of certain ranks, Mr Bett and his colleagues
argued that service personnel should not have to rely on promotion for
wage increases. They envisage pay ranges could overlap -- for example a
major could earn more than a colonel.
The pay structure should be more responsive to the needs of the
individual services and to changes in the employment market, they say.
''The pay structure should allow for recognition of individual merit
including skills, experience, and -- especially at the higher level for
both officers and other ranks -- achievement and performance.''
The introduction of a three-stage career structure could encourage
longer-term commitments to the services, resulting in considerable
savings on training.
The first stage would take servicemen and women to the age of about
30, the second to 40, and the third 55.
On completion of each stage it is proposed that a substantial lump sum
bonus would be offered. The greatest would be for those completing the
second stage -- up to #10,000 plus nine months' salary.
Additional pay and incentive schemes should be tightly targeted, they
argue, and discontinued when no longer justified.
The authors recognise that their proposals to slim down the rank
structure is controversial.
Apart from the five-star posts that would disappear, Mr Bett and his
team also propose merging the ranks of major-general and
lieutenant-general and brigadier and colonel, along with equivalents in
the two other services.
Non-commissioned officers would see the ranks of sergeant, staff
sergeant, warrant officer 2, and warrant officer 1 streamlined into two
ranks.
Just like field marshals, lance-corporals would also disappear from
the British Army.

It says a great deal about present-day US society that it has
succumbed to the adulation of the dolt, observes William Russell
STUPIDITY rules. If anyone doubts the existence of a cultural gap
between our film makers and those of Hollywood this week's three main
films -- Dumb and Dumber, Terminal Velocity, and An Awfully Big
Adventure -- illustrate the difference perfectly.
It would be easy to dismiss the way Forrest Gump cleaned up at the
Oscars as simply a tribute to a film, hugely successful financially --
the Oscars are about box office receipts, not talent -- whose hero
Americans find appealing. One cannot quibble with the former. One can
worry about the latter because Gump is a chump. The point about Frank
Capra's little men is they were simple, but not simpletons. Gump has
about as much natural ability as a lottery winner. He has no superior
moral values or capabilities. Good things happen to him because he is
plain dumb and it says a great deal about present-day American society
that it has succumbed to the adulation of the dolt.
The American dream was about making it through a combination of hard
work and good luck. The dream in today's Hollywood is about making it
through stupidity. In Dumb and Dumber, a hit in America, the depths of
inanity are plumbed. By comparison Abbott and Costello are comic
geniuses, Martin and Lewis the ultimate sophisticates.
In Terminal Velocity Charlie Sheen, a sky diver whose brains may be in
his parachute, but are certainly not in his head, gets involved with
some Russian KGB renegades who have left their brains behind in the
Kremlin. Both films, however, do what they are designed to do with
consummate skill.
Dumb and Dumber may have old jokes, their wit level may be low --
schoolboy smut at best -- but they do, as they say, the business and
make people laugh. As for Terminal Velocity, a mindless thriller, like a
roller-coaster ride it sets the adrenalin flowing and contains, to be
fair, an amazing mid-air stunt for its climax which it would be unfair
to describe. It is the only good reason for bothering to see the film.
An Awfully Big Adventure, the British one of the trio, is a complete
contrast and demonstrates just what is wrong -- and right -- with the
films we make. Directed by Mike Newell, it reunites him with Hugh Grant,
the star of his monster hit Four Weddings and a Funeral. Grant became,
it is alleged, ''hot'' in Hollywood because of that film. This one could
put him off the boil straight away, except that his Hollywood future
depends on how his American-made work fares, not little British films
like this, pretty much what one would have expected from the director of
Enchanted April -- a decent television movie.
The production values are fine, and one of those not quite all-star
casts British films seem to field camp up happily as the members of the
company. The film will look much better on Channel Four, which is where
it will probably end up, than it ever will in the cinema where fans of
Grant the glamorous may not like Grant the gay lecher, seducer of
teenage boys.
In Dumb and Dumber Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels are Lloyd Christmas and
Harry Dunne, two slobs for whom, as the publicity says, ''every day is a
no-brainer''. Lloyd, a limousine driver, takes a pretty girl, Lauren
Holly, to the airport. She is delivering an attache case full of ransom
money to the man who kidnapped her husband and leaves it at the pick-up
point on the concourse. Lloyd thinks she has forgotten it, grabs it, but
fails to contact her before she gets her plane, and takes it home. He
and Harry, a dog groomer who drives a van designed to look like a dog,
set about finding her.
Cue for every stupid old joke in the book including the longest,
crassest laxative gag in cinema history. Carrey, whose comic style has
an affinity with that of Jerry Lewis at his worst, is in his element,
Daniels, a capable light comedian slumming, tries too hard.
Charlie Sheen demonstrates in film after film that the saying like
father, like son, is fallible because father Martin is an actor of
resource and power, whereas Charlie would be stretched cast as Dumbo the
elephant. In Terminal Velocity he plays a sky diver hired by Nastassia
Kinski to give her parachute lessons. She jumps, the parachute fails to
open, and Charlie is blamed for her death. As in Drop Zone it is a con.
Nastassia is actually a renegade KGB agent fleeing for her life from
former colleagues.
They are engaged in a complicated illegal transaction hardly worth
explaining because it is only an excuse for Charlie and Nastassia to go
on the run, have one of those sparring love-hate affairs, and end up in
a mid-air rescue that is a tribute to the skill of the stunt men. One of
those films made solely because of the stunts, the stunt men and the
special effects are its true stars. Brains, logic, common sense, and
actors who can act have nothing to do with it.
The credentials of An Awfully Big Adventure are impeccable. The script
by Charles Wood -- The Knack, The Charge of the Light Brigade,
Tumbledown -- is based on a novel by Beryl Bainbridge about her
experiences as a student at the Liverpool Playhouse just after the war.
The young trainee assistant stage manager, Stella (Georgina Cates in an
appealing debut), an innocent abroad in an adult world she
misunderstands, wreaks havoc wherever she goes.
The provincial rep setting is sharply observed, but scene setting
occupies far too much time. Stella's big adventure ends in tragedy, the
seeds of which are sown by her actions.
As a climax for the novel it probably worked to delay disclosing so
much, so long, but Wood and Newell fail to sustain interest while the
adventure is heading to its climax and the posturings of the players
sending up the stock figures of rep, amusing though they are, are not
enough. It all reeks of the smell of greasepaint, cold cabbage, and
post-war austerity, and Grant, looking a wreck, gives Meredith, the
homosexual director of the company, the right bitchy louche edge. Alan
Rickman, the charismatic leading man, who has an affair with the teenage
Stella, smoulders splendidly, but does not appear until midway.
The revelations are genuinely shocking, but the script's structure is
weak, and the literary origins show through. The epitome of a British
film, it has at least been made for an audience in which some signs of
intelligent life will be found.
The school holidays mean the usual releases for tiny tots only. In Far
From Home -- or Laddies Came Back -- a golden labrador, Yellow Dog, and
his master, wee Angus, lost in the wilds of British Columbia, have lots
of big adventures finding their way home. The Little Rascals, a doomed
attempt to revive Our Gang for the nineties, tells how the He-Man Woman
Haters club discover girls can be A Good Thing. Disney's One Hundred and
One Dalmatians, 34 years on, contains one of the studio's best
vilainesses, Cruella de Vil, and remains a joy.

Naples, Wednesday
AN Italian doctor has been ordered to stand trial for fraud after a
couple discovered a test-tube baby conceived at his fertility clinic had
a hereditary disease they could not have passed on.
Preliminary magistrate Nicola Ciccarelli described Dr Raffaele Magli
in his order as ''a sorcerer's apprentice disguised as a doctor'' and
complained about the lack of laws in Italy governing artificial
insemination procedures.
According to the charges, Magli allegedly used the sperm of a donor
who was not the intended father in an in-vitro fertilisation procedure
that led to the birth of a girl in Naples in July 1992.
When the girl was seven months old, she was diagnosed as having
thalassaemia, also known as Cooley's anaemia, a hereditary blood disease
that requires she be given a blood transfusion every 40 days,
prosecutors said.
They said the mother is a healthy carrier of the disease but the only
way she could have passed it on to her child was if the father also was
a carrier. Her husband had been tested and was found to be free of the
disease.
Prosecutors said Magli, described in the Italian media as ''a young
star'' of the country's booming fertility field, allegedly used the
sperm of a donor who was a carrier of thalassaemia and not that of the
man who was supposed to be the father.
Magli, 40, who has denied any wrong-doing, was ordered to stand trial
on charges of fraud and causing bodily harm.
Prosecutors said that Maglia also wrongly told the mother her
Fallopian tubes were completely blocked and she could never become
pregnant naturally.
But after giving birth to the test-tube baby, she and her husband
conceived without any medical help, they said.
Lead prosecutor Osvaldo Maresca also won an order closing Magli's
clinic, arguing it was needed ''to prevent this doctor from continuing
to commit other crimes of this nature''.
The judge said in his order that the lack of laws regulating
artificial insemination in Italy, which has allowed the controversial,
so-called ''granny births'', also meant it was difficult to police
crimes that ''like in this case, are committed by unscrupulous private
gynaecologists''.
Last week, Italy's national association of doctors adopted new rules
that, among other things, banned artificial insemination from being
practised on women over 50 and on single women.--Reuter.

Beijing, Wednesday
A CHINESE scientific expedition is to set off this month on a search
for human-like ape-men in remote mountain areas of central China, the
Xinhua news agency said today.
The scientists hope to capture one of the creatures -- dubbed China's
''Big Foot'' -- or at least find evidence to prove its existence, the
agency said.
''We will never harm it,'' Xinhua quoted expedition leader Wang
Fangchen as saying.
The first group is to leave Beijing on Friday and make preparations
for a massive search that is to begin on April 22 in Shennongjia Valley
in central Hubei province, Wang said. The search is to last until
mid-year.
Like the fabled Himalayan Yeti or ''Big Foot'', China's ''snow man''
is reported to be 6[1/2]ft tall and leave 16-inch footprints.
Rural residents who have glimpsed the creature say it walks upright
and is covered with long hair, Xinhua said.
Some scientists believe the creature may be a kind of unknown primate,
possibly the offspring of a branch of anthropoid ape, or even a group of
ape-men who have not kept up with evolution, it said.
The search may provide ''living fossils'' for the study of the
evolution of human beings, but other scientists are skeptical, Xinhua
said.
The expedition may result in disappointment if the ''wild man is
proven to have become extinct because of encroaching civilisation'',
said Wang, a member of the non-governmental Committee for Research on
Strange and Rare Creatures.
The 30-member expedition will be equipped with luminous compasses,
nightscopes, satellite orientation equipment, cameras, infra-red
detectors and other tools.
Despite backing by the State Environment Protection Agency and Chinese
Academy of Sciences, the team still lacks funds and hopes to obtain
foreign financing, the report said.--Reuter.

Dohuk, Iraq, Wednesday
THREE Turkish aid workers died in northern Iraq today in a clash with
an angry crowd of Kurds going to collect the bodies of seven shepherds
allegedly killed by Turkish soldiers, Kurdish witnesses said.
Five Kurds also died in the shooting near the town of Dohuk but there
was disagreement over their identity.
Turkey's foreign ministry and the Turkish Red Crescent aid society
said at least four of the dead Kurds were guards in the relief van in
which the Turkish aid workers were travelling.
The aid workers were the first Turkish civilians killed since
thousands of Turkish troops poured into northern Iraq on March 20 in an
offensive against separatist Kurdish rebels.
Meanwhile, troops killed at least 24 Kurdish rebels on a fresh thrust
into the mountains of eastern Turkey, military officials said today.
They said a 25,000-strong Turkish military force backed by air power
had launched a drive into two mountainous areas in Tunceli province,
where rain had stalled the push for two days.--Reuter.

From RUBEN ALABASTRO, Ipil, Philippines, Wednesday
MUSLIM rebels who unleashed a devastating assault on a southern
Philippine town are planning further attacks and a security alert is in
force throughout Mindanao island, officials said today.
''There are intelligence reports that they are planning to hit some
other places,'' armed forces chief General Arturo Enrile told reporters.
Enrile and Defence Secretary Renato de Villa earlier toured the town
of Ipil, still in a state of shock after yesterday's attack which killed
45 people and injured 40.
Most of the town centre was totally destroyed in the attack, the worst
single act of violence in 20 years in a long-festering Muslim
insurgency.
The revolt is centred on Mindanao, some 500 miles south of Manila and
home to most of the mainly Christian Philippines' substantial Muslim
minority.
Enrile said five infantry battalions -- about 3000 men -- along with a
Ranger company and special forces' units were involved in the hunt for
the raiders.
In Manila, President Fidel Ramos said he had ordered an all-out
assault.
''I commanded the armed forces . . . to go all out, utilising land,
sea and air assets and to shoot to kill all those deemed to be members
of the Abu Sayyaf wherever they find them,'' Ramos told a news
conference.
He said the attack, involving about 200 heavily armed men wearing
camouflage battledress, was led by a man known to the military as a
leader of the Abu Sayyaf, a Muslim extremist group blamed for a wave of
kidnappings and killings.
The apparent reason for the attack, he said, was to free the leader's
son, arrested earlier for possessing an illegal firearm.
Other officials speculated that the attack may have been in
retaliation for a local businessman's refusal to pay ransom after his
son was kidnapped.
Police and officials said they believed members of two other rebel
groups took part in the attack.
Ipil residents said the attackers stormed the town by land and sea,
attacking police and army headquarters, robbing four banks and setting
the town centre ablaze.--Reuter.

From PETER SMERDON Bujumbura, Wednesday
BURUNDI today reported fresh ethnic killings and fighting and the
government launched an inquiry into reports of a massacre of hundreds of
Hutu civilians last week.
State-run Burundi radio said 20 Hutu villagers were killed at Muhanga
in the northern province of Kayanza yesterday in reprisal for the
killing of six members of a Tutsi family.
The government said it was setting up a commission of inquiry to
establish whether Burundi troops killed more than 450 Hutus at sites in
northeast Muyinga province last week.
US Ambassador Robert Krueger, as well as an aid worker, who declined
to be identified, and villagers, have said troops of the Tutsi-dominated
army and Tutsi gunmen were responsible for the slaughter.
The army has said only some 20 Hutu gunmen and civilian hostages held
by the gunmen were killed in clashes with troops.
Residents of Kizi village said yesterday they had buried 201 bodies
and said many more were still lying in the bush. Foreign journalists
have seen several graves at one site.
Asked earlier about the killings, Krueger, who visited Muyinga
Hospital and saw survivors who had been shot, slashed or stoned, said
most of the victims were women and children.
''It is a horrendous massacre,'' he added. ''These aren't just people
caught up in the crossfire.''
Foreign Affairs and Cooperation Minister Jean-Marie Ngendahayo told a
news conference in the capital that the foreign media had not told the
facts when they said the army killed people in the two northern areas
including Muyinga.
''We want to turn some light on the killed people in the north in
order to establish who was responsible for killing them and we will try
to see if it was the army or not,'' he said.
He said the inquiry by the justice ministry would take as long as
ncessary, depending on the gravity of the matter.
The UN refugee agency said Tanzania had allowed 1500 Burundian
refugees who fled ethnic violence to move to transit points inside
Tanzania today after threatening to expel them.--Reuter.

Bonn, Wednesday
GERMAN Chancellor Helmut Kohl challenged the United States and other
rich countries to commit themselves to cutting air pollution as
delegates struggled to break a deadlock at the United Nations climate
talks in Berlin today.
He said a signal must go out that there will be further limitation and
reduction of greenhouse gases after the year 2000, he told delegates
from 170 nations at the crucial last days of the talks.
''As a first step towards effective climate protection, I urge all
industrial states: follow the example of the European Union. Join in our
commitment to stabilise emissions of carbon dioxide beyond the year
2000,'' Kohl said.
German negotiator Ansgar Vogel said overnight talks had failed to
secure agreement on how to limit CO2 emissions after the year
2000.--Reuter.

Washington, Wednesday
THE US Supreme Court today denied a stay of execution for a
British-born man who is scheduled to be electrocuted tomorrow night in
Georgia, a clerk said.
Nicholas Ingram, who has dual US and British citizenship, is due to
die in Georgia's electric chair for a murder conviction. The court did
not issue an opinion in the case, the clerk said.
Earlier today, a state judge also rejected Ingram's request to halt
the execution.
In Jackson, Georgia, the judge refused to grant Ingram's request to
halt his execution, the latest in a flurry of last-minute legal appeals
to save him from the electric chair.
Butts County Superior Court Judge Hal Craig also rejected a request by
lawyers for Nicholas Ingram that his conviction be set aside because he
was drugged during his 1983 trial.
Ingram, 31, was convicted in 1983 of murdering J C Sawyer, 55, after
forcing his way into the Sawyer home, tying the man and his wife to a
tree behind the house, robbing them of $60 and shooting both in the
head. Mrs Sawyer survived the shooting.
Ingram originally was scheduled to die in 1984 but has been able to
avoid execution three times through appeals.
Yesterday, a federal district judge refused to stop the execution
after Ingram's lawyers argued it was cruel and unusual punishment in
violation of the US constitution.
The State Board of Pardons and Paroles today reviewed a request to
halt the execution but it was not expected to release a decision until
tomorrow morning.
During today's hearing, Thomas Dunn, one of Ingram's lawyers, said
neither the judge nor Ingram's lawyers at his 1983 trial were aware his
client was under the influence of Thorazine -- a psychotropic or
mind-altering drug.
''He was under the influence of the most powerful psychotropic drug
known to man -- Thorazine,'' Dunn said. ''He was present in the
courtroom but he wasn't there. He was so chemically drugged with these
powerful psychotropic drugs that he wasn't there.''
Attorneys for the state argued that Ingram's lawyers had always known
Ingram had been given Thorazine because he had attempted suicide while
in prison.
But his current lawyers said the state had hidden evidence that would
have explained why he failed to take the witness stand and showed no
emotion during his trial.
Ingram's mother Anne, flanked by several members of her family,
arrived at the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles in Atlanta for the
clemency hearing.
The board has the power to commute her son's death sentence on mercy
grounds.
There was a brief delay at the start of the hearing by the four-man
board while camera crews were allowed into the hearing room to take
pictures of the board and family members before the meeting was closed
to the press.
The meeting was expected to last up to an hour and a half.
Among those present with the Ingram group were Nicholas's brothers
Ricky, Jay, and Wayne and his sister, Teri.
The legal team includes Mr Stafford-Smith, Philip Sapsford QC,
barrister David Marshall and a psychologist, Dr Nick DeFillipis, and the
trial counsel Dennis O'Brien.
The 24-page petition being presented to the board argued that at his
1983 trial Ingram was drugged on ''massive doses of anti-psychotic
medicine'' throughout the pre-trial proceedings and the trial.
The petition said: ''In other words Nicky Ingram, unbeknown to the
defence right up until March, 1995 (this year) drifted through the trial
in a drug induced trance, unable to cooperate with his counsel in any
meaningful way and unable to take part in the proceedings against him.''
It went on: ''Counsel did not recognise that the bland face that
stared back at the jury throughout the trial was not the face of a
remorseless killer but the face of a teenager drugged up to the ears to
prevent overt hallucinations.
''Nicky Ingram did not know much of anything as he dozed and doodled
through his trial.''
The petition included a macabre touch, being headed ''Petition for
Clemency on behalf of Nicholas Lee Ingram born November 20, 1963; died
April 6, 1995?''
The judge refused the request to halt his execution in the Georgia's
electric chair and also rejected request that his conviction be set
aside because he said he was drugged during his 1983 trial.--Reuter/PA.

CUSTOMS and Excise officers have recruited the ''professionals'' to
assist them in a bid to stem the flow of drugs being smuggled into
Scotland.
Port and freight staff have agreed to join the fight and will undergo
an education programme to alert them to ways they can help.
Yesterday, a ''memorandum of understanding'' was signed by Aberdeen
Harbour Board, Aberdeen Freight Forwarders' Association, Fraserburgh
Harbour Board, Peterhead Bay Authority, and Peterhead Harbours.
Mr Norman Chambers, East Scotland and Shetland assistant collector of
Customs, said that since the beginning of 1993 -- when the European
Union boundaries had been brought down -- Customs officials were no
longer presented with documentation about imports.
''Sixty per cent of the drugs detected come in from EU countries, and
that means that although we have a free market, the borders of the
European Union are not secure.
''The professionals do see documentation and they can help us when
they spot something which arouses their suspicions,'' said Mr Chambers.
Without question, drugs were being smuggled in along Scotland's remote
coastline and through small harbours, and the help of the professionals
in these areas was vital.
He said he believed the Customs and Excise anti-smuggling force was
more effective than at any time in the past 30 years. However, even if
it doubled the number of its officers, that would not duplicate the
additional assistance this scheme would offer.

DEMAND for ''living wills'' in which people make vital decisions about
the end of their lives, including choosing how and where they want to
die, is growing, it was claimed yesterday by doctors in Scotland.
The British Medical Association in Scotland said the public had become
more and more conscious of what medical science could now do and more
aware of ''tragedies'' involving people existing in vegetative states.
''The days of Dr Finlay and Dr Cameron saying this is what we are
going to do are gone,'' said Dr John Callander, chairman of the BMA
Scottish council.
He was speaking at the launch of a new code of practice in which
guidelines have been drawn up for health professionals about the
drafting and implementation of living wills, or advance statements as
they are also known.
He stressed at the outset they were not talking about euthanasia or
assisted suicide.
It was a patient's right to decide how and when they got treatment and
they could make a living will indicating how they wished to be dealt
with if they were no longer competent to make these decisions.
Dr Callander said a person might want to die at home and not in
hospital. It was also right that people should be allowed to say whether
they wanted all reasonable efforts made to sustain or prolong life if
suffering a terminal illness.
Dr Callander said that, as medicine became more and more scientific,
it was easier to prolong life; but not always the quality of life people
wanted.
Asked about a situation where a doctor did not want to do what a
patient was asking, Dr Callander said: ''I think if a patient said he
wants to refuse treatment and that is written down in the witness
statement, the doctor would almost be guilty of assault if he continued
to do that.''
He said the code, also launched in London, dealt with English law.
''The Scottish Law Commission has not yet reported its views but will do
so in a couple of months and if it is significantly different we will be
amending it.''
Dr Sandy Macara, the Scots-born chairman of the BMA Council (UK), said
more than 10 years ago there were calls for doctors to support action on
the issue.
However they had been very wary, he said, because of some of the
pressure people were advocating.
''They were actively promoting 'euthanasia' and it was an agenda which
we felt we could not support.''

<TEXT>
AN office worker who claimed she was sexually harassed by her
operations manager has had her complaint dismissed by a Dundee
industrial tribunal.
Miss Amanda Farrell, 21, of Clepington Road, Dundee, claimed that her
boss, Mr William Hendry, of Briggs Marine Services Ltd, West Dock,
Burntisland, used to throw pieces of paper at her as if he were trying
to throw them down her blouse.
She also claimed he looked at her ''in a horrible way'' and would try
to see inside her low-cut top.
She alleged that Mr Hendry had asked her what her boyfriend was like
in bed, and had hit her bottom with a ruler as she bent over his desk to
read a document. She claimed this had angered her and she had then
shouted at Mr Hendry and punched him on the arm.
Miss Farrell alleged sexual discrimination by Mr Hendry and her former
employer, Briggs Marine Services Ltd. A claim of unfair dismissal was
abandoned because she did not have the qualifying service.
In reply to the allegations, Mr Hendry told the tribunal that Miss
Farrell used bad language and swore regularly in front of staff.
He admitted he had thrown bits of paper at her but denied trying to
throw anything down her blouse or that he tried to see inside it.
He also admitted discussing his private life with her, but said she
had talked about her boyfriend's performance in bed.
He denied he asked her about her boyfriend but admitted he had once
read out an article on oral sex when Miss Farrell was present. He
claimed he had then remarked: ''What a load of rubbish. Who reads
this.''
He claimed there had been no physical contact between them and said he
had never hit Miss Farrell's bottom with a ruler or bragged to a male
colleague that he had had sexual intercourse with her.
In their findings, the tribunal said they did not find Miss Farrell to
be a convincing witness and in the numerous conflicts of evidence,
preferred Mr Hendry's version.
Towards the end of her employment there was so little administrative
work to be done at the Dundee depot that Mr Hendry was able to do it
himself, the tribunal added.
The reason for her dismissal was redundancy, not because she was being
victimised or discriminated against on the grounds of her sex, the
tribunal ruled. The complaint was dismissed.

A BEAUTIFUL blonde was in bad trouble, surrounded by a crowd howling
for her blood. This being the 1990s, the script did not allow for a hero
to swing into action and carry her to safety. She was on her own.
If the ideal politician produces ideas that unite people, Mrs
Bottomley had done it. She had managed to unite most of the Commons
against her plans for reorganising the NHS in London.
A few tried to come to her aid, including husband Peter. ''I thank my
-- Honourable Friend,'' said Virginia, dimpling prettily. A few Home
Counties Tories dared to suggest that London always has had too much
money spent on its health services compared with, say, the Home
Counties.
The Department of Health case, in summary, is that London has too many
hospitals, many of them the wrong size, provides specialist services
from too many locations, hampering efficiency and, at the same time, has
poor GP and community health provision. The answer had to be
rationalisation and, as every reformer has found, rationalisation hurts.
Sir Rhodes Boyson (Brent North -- Con.) was only the most extreme of
her critics, suggesting that his constituents wanted lots of little
hospitals just around the corner from them and would not feel justice
had been done until they had them.
Sir John Gorst (Hendon North -- Con.) pronounced: ''She is doing the
wrong thing, the wrong way, at the wrong time and in the wrong place.''
If, on consideration, this stricture hardly made sense, it did forcibly
get over the point that Sir John thought that Virginia was wrong.
''Grave mistake'', ''Outrageous'', ''No neuro-surgery unit between
Dover and Lambeth'', ''No response whatsoever to points we have made in
debate'': the criticisms poured out -- and that was just the Tories.
Virginia, not as nimble intellectually as she is lovely, clung to her
basic defence. Hard decisions could be deferred no longer, specialist
services had to be concentrated in centres of excellence, large amounts
are being spent on improvements.
Ever and anon, she prayed in aid eminent academics and clinicians who,
she said, backed what she was doing, driving her critics into ever
greater frenzies.
Democracy, Sir John told her, was delivering what the majority wanted
not telling them what they should have. That settled a matter which has
occupied Plato and others over a lengthy period. Suppose the individual
Londoner does not know much about his city's as opposed to his own
individual needs and Virginia does?
As the storm raged around her exquisitely groomed figure, one could
see why, in the words of one of her few supporters, many of Virginia's
predecessors, faced with these hard decisions, had ''ducked'' them.
One could also see why Virginia had opted to make her original
announcement by way of a written Commons answer the day before, drawing
on her the searing criticism from Mr Peter Brooke (City of London and
Westminster South -- Con.) that she lacked moral courage.
In any case, it had only made things worse. Nor was the Speaker
inclined to shorten the torments of this Minister at the stake. For more
than an hour, she had to listen to most of her questioners tell her she
had got it all horribly wrong.
Her ''Shadow'', Mrs Margaret Beckett, went for ''clinical and
financial vandalism'' and attacked her ''obstinate refusal to have a
fresh assessment.''
That, said Virginia, taking heart, sounded like the voice of reaction,
and hadn't Margaret's leader indicated recently that no more money would
be made available by a Labour Government for the NHS?
The Sketch can make no judgment on the hideously complex plans for NHS
reform in London. On Virginia, it is not perhaps qualified to pronounce
on moral courage but is inclined to at least give Virginia a merit award
for pluck.
However, if Mr Blair has any sense, he will quickly provide an
Opposition day to debate the subject. It is difficult to see many of the
London Tories turning up in the ministerial lobby at the end. The
Government, not for the first time, could be in need of the accident and
emergency service itself.

BANK of England Governor Eddie George yesterday defended his conduct
of the investigation into the Barings bank collapse before MPs, who
pressed him for assurances that the Bank's inquiry will be truly
independent.
He also defended the use of derivatives, the complex financial
instruments that caused the downfall of the bank in February, with
losses of #860m.
Both the Dutch financial services group ING, which took over Barings,
and members of the all-party Commons Treasury and Civil Service Select
Committee yesterday condemned ''delays'' by the Bank in producing a
report on the affair.
Mr George was accused by Labour MPs on the Treasury committee of
allowing the official inquiry by the Board of Banking Supervision into
the merchant bank's collapse to be carried out by employees of the Bank
of England, against all principles of unbiased investigation.
The Governor told the MPs that the investigation would be thorough and
independent, and that it would seek to establish all the facts in the
case. He also sought to reassure the committee that the risks in the
derivatives market were no greater than in other areas of banking.
He told MPs that the sudden collapse of Barings had been the result of
the bank's Singapore subsidiary taking a number of ''huge open
positions'' on Japanese equities and interest rates derivatives
contracts.
When it became apparent that the scale of losses outstripped the
260-year-old bank's capital, the Bank of England and the big London
merchant banks tried to put together a rescue package.
However, it soon became clear that the capital required was too large.
On the equity contracts alone, Mr George said, another #700m would have
been needed on top of losses amounting already to #700m.
Left-wing Labour MP Brian Sedgemore told Mr George the inquiry was
being run by an employee of the Bank of England. ''It's an inquiry into
the actions of his own chums. It's nonsense, absolute nonsense.''
Mr George told the committee he was satisfied that the inquiry --
which, he said, was expected to issue its first report in about four
months -- would be fully independent. He added that he was keen to
dispel concerns that derivatives were far more risky than other forms of
bank activity.
''All banking activity is subject to risk,'' he said. The actual risk
of a derivatives transaction may be as low as two or three per cent of
the actual capital value of the transaction.
Asked by Mr Nicholas Budgen (Unwhipped Conserative -- Wolverhampton
South-West) if he could identify the types of institutions he would
intervene to save, Mr George refused.
''I'm not prepared to say of any institution that there are no
circumstances in which it would be allowed to fail. There are huge
dangers in that.''
Mr George was asked about reported criticism of the Bank by ING for
the time it was taking in carrying out the inquiry. ''I'm holding up
nothing,'' he said. It was not possible to come out and accuse people of
negligence ''or worse'' without ascertaining all the facts.
Mr Barry Legg (Milton Keynes South-West -- Con.) asked Mr George about
the complexity of financial instruments such as derivatives and the
experience required to handle them.
Mr George said there was a danger of people taking on things they did
not understand. ''There clearly is a problem there. If you don't
understand it, don't do it,'' he said.
Earlier, it emerged that Mr Hesel Lindenbergh, a senior director of
ING, is asking for a meeting this week with senior Bank officials to ask
why inquiries are taking so long. He told the Financial Times: ''You
cannot wait for six months to see who is guilty.''
He said ING's attempts to relaunch Barings were being hampered by
uncertainty over which executives would remain. With hindsight, ING
might not have retained all executives had it known the timing of the
inquiry, he added.
Mr George tod MPs: ''ING is not in the same situation as we are. We
have not said to ING you cannot get rid of anybody. We have said that
until we have the facts we are not requiring you to get rid of
anybody.''
Chairman Peter Baring and his deputy Andrew Tuckey resigned on Monday
as a matter of ''honour and principle'', nearly two months after the
bank collapsed after its Singapore trader Nick Leeson lost huge amounts
of money on the Far East derivatives markets.

Stephen MacGregor adds a postscript to the Prime Minister's US visit
THE first thing one has to say is that it did not get off to a good
start.
A young lady interviewed by the BBC referred to him as John Morgan.
There had been a special relationship between Britain and the United
States in the Thatcher era, but who was this new kid on the block?
The New York Times, on the first day of Mr Major's visit to
Washington, gave the story precisely two paragraphs, while the
Washington Post ignored it altogether. TV is dominated -- yes, it really
is -- by the O J Simpson trial.
And yet, at the end of the day, even the most cynical of the White
House or Whitehall watchers would have to concede that in his three-day
visit to Washington Mr Major scored something of a diplomatic triumph.
He probably won more support from President Clinton on Northern
Ireland and the decomissioning of IRA weapons than he could ever have
hoped for -- and there was a bit more, too.
Mr Clinton has been made acutely aware of the sensitivities of the
Northern Ireland situation and, after more than three hours of
discussions, gave his strongest backing so far to Mr Major over his
attempts to find peace in the Province.
Mr Major's courage was praised, the political risks he has taken were
praised, and Mr Clinton made clear that the argument over Gerry Adams's
recent visit to the United States had been put aside. He now understood
why decommissioning of the IRA's weapons was an important next step in
the peace process.
However, a little bit of other significant work was done by Mr Major
this week on what the old hands call The Hill -- Capitol Hill where the
work of government is done.
He spent a good deal of time with the likes of Newt Gingrich and Bob
Dole -- fellow right-wing thinkers -- and the impression left was that
both sides felt they could learn from each other.
Mr Gingrich even went so far as to say it had been a special thrill to
meet the Prime Minister.
What has happened here is that all this stuff about a special
relationship has been ditched in favour of a good, businesslike,
thorough relationship between Britain and the United States.
Mr Major says he is full of ideas for 1997 and beyond, but he is up
against the strength of the Blair-led Labour Party. Mr Clinton is facing
deep unpopularity on the domestic front and is up against the right
wingers now in control of the legislative process.
With a special relationship like this, who needs enemies?

<HEADLINE>Stewart's Lockerbie proposal rejected</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>979026199</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Scottish Office yesterday rejected the proposal by Eastwood Tory
MP Allan Stewart that a Scottish court could sit outside Scotland to try
the two Libyans accused of the Lockerbie bombing.
In a Commons written reply Lord James Douglas-Hamilton said that the
Government had no reason to suppose that Libya would surrender the men
to a Scottish court sitting abroad.
He told Mr Tam Dalyell (Linlithgow -- Lab.) ''The Scottish lawyer
representing the two accused has most recently suggested trial by a
panel of judges headed by a Scottish judge.
''This is simply the latest in a long line of inappropriate and often
contradictory proposals, none of which satisfy the requirement of the
Security Council that the accused be produced for trial in Scotland or
the United States.''
Lord James said there was no need for Scottish courts to operate
outside Scotland. The evidence of witnesses who were abroad could be
taken before a local judge or relayed by direct television link to the
Scottish court.
The reply makes it virtually certain that Mr Stewart's proposal will
be rejected when it is discussed by the Commons committee considering
the Scottish Criminal Justice Bill.
Mr Stewart said ''This is a extremely disappointing reply because it
seems to pre-empt anything that might be said in the Parliament a debate
later this month. I find it very surprising that the Scottish Office has
done this instead of giving a holding answer until the committee debated
the matter.''

THE hidden costs of privatisation have hit taxpayers and deprived
cash-strapped public services of valuable support, Monkland East MP
Helen Liddell claimed in the Commons yesterday.
In an adjournment debate, Mrs Liddell said privatisation had benefited
the financial institutions of the City who had earned huge fees for
preparing the sale of state-owned industries.
The amount spent on advertising alone for the privatisations since the
Tories took office in 1979 ranged from #1.1m on the sale of Northern
Ireland Electricity to the #21.4m ''Tell Sid'' campaign for the sale of
British Gas.
The three-stage sale of British Telecom had involved a #35.6m
advertising campaign, she said. ''That is a sum that beggars belief and
that could be put to better use in the public sector rather than lining
the pockets of the advertising agencies.''
In reply, Treasury Minister Sir George Young said that each
privatisation only cost 2.8% of the proceeds that it raised.
Nationalised industry required #50m a week in subsidy under Labour in
1979, but now produced #50m a week in benefits.
''The Government will continue down this road. We are going to
continue to apply the principles of quality and service in the heart of
government and local services,'' the Minister said.

IT IS by no means certain that statutory controls on the press can be
avoided, Lord Wakeham, chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, said
yesterday, but added: ''I am going to have a good go at it.''
The former Tory Cabinet Minister, who has been in his new job for
three months, said his impression was that the Government and Opposition
Front Benches were not enthusiastic about introducing legislation to
oversee press activity.
By contrast, he thought a majority of back benchers in both main
parties would be ''pretty enthusiastic'' about legal curbs.
Lord Wakeham, a former Leader of the Commons, said he was conscious
that many Acts ended up somewhat different from the Bill originally
introduced, an oblique reference to the widely-held belief that if a
moderate Press Regulation Bill was introduced amendments could be
carried which might make it considerably more draconian.
He said 75% of complaints dealt with by the Commission were about the
lack of accuracy and of these 90% were resolved satisfactorily.
Relatively few (8%) were about intrusion into privacy, although a number
of these involved important issues.
Lord Wakeham said he believed the proposed compensation fund whereby
some newspapers would, in effect, fine other newspapers, would be
completely unacceptable to the industry. Nor was he inclined to revive
the oral hearings the old Press Council had held where, as far as he
could make out, ''everybody lied like troopers.''

<HEADLINE>Britain denies backing Owen for Nato job</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>979026202</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Prime Minister is lobbying for support to put forward EU peace
envoy Lord Owen as the next head of the Nato alliance, it was reported
yesterday.
The New York Times claimed that Mr Major urged President Bill Clinton
to endorse the former Labour Foreign Secretary for the West's top
defence job during their talks in Washington.
However, British officials, who returned aboard Concorde with Mr
Major, last night emphatically denied the report.
''The name of Lord Owen was never raised. The post is not even
vacant,'' one senior official insisted.
It has been claimed that the current Nato Secretary-General, former
Belgian economics Minister Willie Claes, is expected to resign in the
wake of a bribery scandal involving arms manufacturers in his home
country.
The Government does not accept officially that Mr Claes is likely to
depart and certainly would not want to be seen lobbying openly for a
replacement at this stage.
However, US Government sources quoted in the New York Times appeared
to contradict the British line and mentioned the alleged approach as
part of what appeared to be a wider briefing on the discussions.
The newspaper said: ''Officials familiar with the talks today said
that Mr Major also asked President Clinton to back Britain's efforts to
have a former British Foreign Minister, Lord Owen, named Secretary
General of Nato.''
No further details were given but it would be no surprise if the
Government did decide to press forward Lord Owen, should the post fall
vacant.
He has won widespread respect for his tireless efforts to bring peace
to Bosnia and has a depth of knowledge and experience that would make
him ideally suited to the role.
One British official said: ''He has done a fine job in Bosnia. It is
an extremely difficult job and he has done it well.
''Lord Owen has been part of the diplomatic effort dampening down
hostilities.''
However, the British side was insistent that at no stage was Lord Owen
mentioned in any of the meetings between the Prime Minister and the
President.
Meanwhile, Mr Claes yesterday ended weeks of silence on the
allegations surrounding him by insisting on his innocence and rejecting
calls for his resignation.
''I see no reason for me to resign, I am innocent,'' Mr Claes said.
''Resignation would have been taken as a sign of guilt.''
However, Mr Claes continues to be dogged by the so-called ''Agusta
affair'' which has rocked politics in Belgium.
State prosecutors have requested parliamentary authorisation to
further question him and two other former Belgian Government Ministers.

<HEADLINE>Blair calls for end to Britain's Europe 'limbo'</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>6</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979026203</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
LABOUR leader Tony Blair said yesterday that Britain could not remain
''in limbo'' over Europe.
Putting what he called the ''patriotic case for Britain in Europe'',
Mr Blair argued that the only way the country could be a global power
was through Europe.
He warned that anti-Europeans were gaining ground in the Tory Party,
and challenged pro-European Tories to put an end to the drift towards
isolation.
''The Tory Euro-rebels are treated as conquering heroes. Ministers
fall over themselves to say how much of merit they find in what the
sceptics say.
''Yet the logical implications of their manifesto would inexorably
lead to withdrawal from the EU altogether.
''To play with that is to play with fire,'' he said in a speech to the
Royal Institute of International Affairs in London.
Mr Blair argued that Britain must engage fully in Europe.
It must build alliances to secure our national interests and ''start
to play our part in shaping Europe, not following it'', he said.
''We cannot remain in limbo with the worst of both worlds forever,''
he said.
The only way Britain could maintain its historic position as a major
global player was through Europe.
''Forfeit a central role in Europe and we forfeit our opportunity to
play a substantial role in the world.''
The Japanese, Americans and Koreans only invested in Britain because
it was part of the EU, he said.
''If they see us slipping to a second tier, they will put their
investment elsewhere,'' he claimed.
Britain's relationship with the US was multiplied in strength by our
membership of the EU, he said.
Mr Blair conceded that if the rest of Europe wanted to ''rush headlong
into some federalist morass'', that would be an argument against Britain
participating in Europe.
However, he insisted that the Tories were lurching towards disengaging
from Europe even though the rest of Europe was not in favour of
federalism.
He pressed the Government to at least set out the principles on which
it would decide whether to join a single currency.
Mr Blair admitted that the opinion polls would push towards a
sceptical approach to Europe, but warned it would be folly to pander to
them.
TORY former Lord Chancellor Lord Hailsham yesterday entered the
party's debate on Europe by indicating his support for a common
currency.
Lord Hailsham, 87, said in the Lords: ''The earlier part of my life
was spent under a single currency which had lasted for 100 years. It was
called the Gold Standard and it ended with the First World War.'' He
added: ''Nobody suggested it interfered with our independence.''
Lord MacKay of Ardbrecknish, for the Government, said a single
currency ''raises serious economic, political and constitutional
issues''.
He said the Government would decide its attitude at a later date and
added: ''A referendum could not be ruled out.''

However, Councillor Pat Lally and a large number of Labour members

The Labour team handed out leaflets which they claimed provided ''the

WHERE the Scottish Liberal Democrats win in local elections, the
people win too -- SLD leader Jim Wallace MP claimed yesterday in an
eve-of-poll message to candidates.
Mr Wallace stressed that the Liberal Democrats, more than any other
party, had emphasised the need to open up council chambers to the views
of the people they served.
The Liberal Democrats aimed to secure proper decentralisation of power
in the new councils and to make local government more accessible and
responsive to the community.
''We have challenged the Labour Party on the dead hand that they have
laid on local government . . . and they have had to promise to look at
things anew. Only the election of Liberal Democrats in sufficient
numbers can hold them to that and force the issue of openness on to the
agenda of Scotland's new councils'', Mr Wallace said.
His message continued: ''Having travelled extensively throughout
Scotland during this campaign, I am well aware of the hard work and
effort which candidates and supporters have put into these elections,
not just in the weeks running up to polling day, but over a much longer
period.
''That effort, and commitment, deserves to be well rewarded . . . ''
A vote for the Liberal Democrats, he said, was a vote to improve
Scotland's education. Even in the face of Government cutbacks, councils
controlled by the party had safeguarded education budgets where
possible.
He also claimed that where Liberal Democrats were in power they had
acted on their commitment to expand nursery education.

CONSERVATIVES were accused of an eleventh-hour propaganda bid in their
flagship Eastwood constituency yesterday by promoting a forthcoming arts
festival long in advance.
The Eastwood Easter festival, Artsfeast, opens on April 16 for a week
but the appearance of an advertising feature promoting it in The Herald
yesterday prompted a furious reaction from the Labour leader of the
neighbouring Renfrew authority.
Councillor Owen Taylor claimed the supplement clearly breached the
Government's 1988 Code of Recommended Practice on Local Authority
Publicity. He said: ''I know we would never have got this past our legal
people.
''This feature could have waited until the weekend, when it would have
been better received by its target audience. I don't believe it is a
coincidence that it was published the day before local elections.''
Late pages of the supplement clearly carried material about the
achievements of the Eastwood authority, but Provost Leslie Rosin denied
that the publication was designed to help his party. ''It is
non-political,'' he said.
The chief executive of Eastwood District Council, Mr Michael Henry,
rebuffed suggestions that the supplement had been published to coincide
with today's elections.
He said the timing had been decided by arts festival director Mr
Michael Dale rather than the council.
Mr Dale, he said, had been offered a choice of dates by The Herald,
and opted for Wednesday ''for commercial marketing reasons''.

LABOUR front bencher Mr Jack Cunningham was short-changed when he went
canvassing in a shopping centre.
He had just begun to rally support for the party's election hopefuls
in Falkirk when three security guards showed him the door.
The Shadow Trade and Industry spokesman's face was as red as his
rosette as he was escorted from the Howgate complex on Tuesday.
He was later said to be planning to complain to the centre's owner,
the Eagle Star insurance group.
A local Labour insider said: ''Jack was not best pleased. He had just
begun to 'press flesh' when the three security men told him he had to
leave on the orders of the Howgate manager, Mr Andrew Thomson.''
Also ordered out were Mr Tom Martin, Labour's deputy group leader on
Falkirk District Council, and Mrs Esther Fowler, of the party's unitary
council committee.
Mr Dennis Goldie, Falkirk's Labour group leader, said last night: ''We
are disappointed at their treatment. Mr Cunnigham was hardly doing any
harm. He was just meeting the electorate.''
However, Mr Thompson said: ''We must operate a non-political policy
here to be fair to our customers and all parties. Mr Cunningham did not
create a fuss when he was asked to leave.''
Labour leader Tony Blair managed to avoid a similar fate last week in
Edinburgh. After visiting the new conference centre, he was due to go to
the Gyle shopping complex.
The visit was cancelled at the last minute after it was learned that
he would not be welcomed by management, who operated a strict
non-political policy.

THEY may not be elected until tonight, if at all, but the big hitters
at the City Chambers in Glasgow and Strathclyde House are already
embroiled in carving up power in the new single-tier authority.
Overshadowing everything is the long-running battle between the
current Labour leader in Glasgow, Mr Pat Lally, and the lady he deposed,
Mrs Jean McFadden.
Both sides have long since combed the nomination lists to see how the
new councillors will jump.
However, the key to the power game appears to lie with the current
Strathclyde Labour leader, Mr Robert Gould.
Not all of the 18 or so regional councillors expected to be elected
will necessarily be Gould supporters, but he can depend on a significant
number of them -- enough to trade at the power table.
Recently, a supporter of Mrs McFadden produced a list of existing
district and regional councillors likely to be elected, together with
names of potential new councillors, and declared: ''We're winning. We're
three ahead.''
However, the rival faction had also been doing its sums and concluded
that, while on the face of it the McFaddenites were more numerous on the
nomination list, the Lally supporters are fighting more promising seats
and have a greater chance of election.
The dream ticket for Mr Lally would be the Lord Provostship for
himself and Labour group leadership for Mr Gould. However a small number
of supporters with anti-regional bias are not keen to have Mr Gould
foisted on them.
They would rather see the leadership go to Mr Lally's deputy, Bailie
Gordon Macdiarmid. That would be unacceptable to Mr Gould and his
regional faction.
Following tense bargaining meetings between Mr Lally and Mr Gould,
there are now two likely possibilities: that Mr Gould does a deal with
Mrs McFadden; or that he doesn't do a deal with anyone and takes the
leadership on a free vote.
As long as he survives the first round of an exhaustive ballot, it's
difficult to see how he can lose, because one faction will support him
to defeat the other.
Contact between Mrs McFadden's supporters and Mr Gould is difficult to
confirm. According to informed sources she may be asking for too much.
It appears she may not be asking for the leadership but may wish to be
convener of the new authority during the shadow year and then reconsider
her position.
However, there could be dangers in this for Mr Gould. With sufficient
control of the executive, her faction could make him a prisoner and then
get rid of him in a year's time when the authority assumes full powers.
All is to play for. They just need to be elected first . . .

SCOTS go to the local polls throughout the country today and the
moment booths close tonight they will have the chance to so see the
televised interview with the Prime Minister which has boosted interest
in the elections.
Most political players were focusing on the details of today's
hustings, but the SNP was still bridling at the behaviour of the BBC in
broadcasting the programme, as it put it, ''at the first possible legal
moment'' showing contempt for Scotland at the highest level of the BBC
in London.
Ironically, Labour had conceded earlier in the day that the public row
over the Panorama interview with the Premier had played its part in
boosting today's turnout in single-tier elections which might otherwise
have been been met by apathy among electors.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson agreed that the controversy
had ''electrified'' today's poll and brought the campaign to life.
He said the Conservatives had been looking to underplay this election
in the hope that the public would not deliver its full verdict on the
record of the Government.
SNP leader Alex Salmond predicted a strong SNP group in every new
council in Scotland. He also claimed that the Labour Party -- standing
at 53% in this week's System Three poll -- would fail to match that
level of support in today's local elections, describing their poll
rating as ''candy floss.''
Mr Salmond said the SNP would win ''some very substantial victories.''
They had ''excellent prospects'' in places like Moray, Angus, Perth and
Kinross -- where they were almost certain to be the largest party --
West Lothian and in East Ayrshire.
Mr Salmond also believed that the row over the BBC's attempts to
screen the Prime Minister's interview on Panorama on Monday had
galvanised the last few days of the campaign and had focused attention
on the Scottish dimension.
However, Labour were reluctant to over-state their hand, for fear of
giving the Tories the chance of a stated victory if they hang on in any
part of the country where their demise is anticipated.
''It's entirely in the hands of the people,'' said Labour's Scottish
secretary Jack McConnell.
''If they want to send the message strongly enough, the Government
will get the signal they deserve, even in the likes of East
Renfrewshire.
''This is the chance to throw back what was a gerrymandered map of
Scotland straight back in the Government's face.''
Mr Robertson said Labour would win because its experience in running
local government made it the only party people could trust. He pledged
that an incoming Labour government would sack water board employees and
return the resource to local democratic control.
He also claimed local government had nothing to fear from a Scottish
Parliament, which would legislate to entrench and strengthen their
powers.
Predicting success at today's poll, Mr Roberston said: ''Having
visited every corner of Scotland recently, I have found warmth to
Labour's ideas and nothing but hostility to the Government.
''I am confident that we are going to have a resounding vote tomorrow
and send the clearest possible signal to Downing Street that they are on
their way out.''
Mr Salmond concentrated his attack on the Labour Party, claiming they
had failed to clear out the ''deadwood'' among their councillors and
were putting forward ''the same old gang'' at these elections.
Labour attacks on SNP councils over winter assistance for pensioners
had only served to highlight the success of the ''Warm Up for Winter''
packages and the total failure of Labour councils to do anything to
address the problem of fuel poverty.

EASTENDERS star Sid Owen sobbed with relief yesterday when he was
cleared of hitting an estate agent on the head with a beer glass in a
nightclub brawl.
The 23-year-old actor, who plays Ricky Butcher in the BBC1 soap,
gasped as he was cleared and then began wiping tears from his eyes.
Family members and friends, who had packed the public gallery at
Snaresbrook Crown Court, east London, cheered and clapped as the jury
foreman returned the not guilty verdicts.
As supporters and relatives hustled him to a waiting car, Mr Owen said
of Mr Mark Falshaw, also 23, the man who claimed the actor had smashed a
glass over his head: ''I can't believe he has put me through all this.
It was all lies obviously. I don't know why he has done it.''
The jury took just 20 minutes to clear him of wounding Mr Falshaw with
intent to cause him grievous bodily harm at the Epping Forest Country
Club in May last year.
They also found him not guilty of an alternative charge of unlawful
wounding.
The Crown claimed that Mr Owen -- described in court by Mr Ross Kemp
(who plays Queen Vic' landlord Grant Mitchell in the soap) as the
''gentlest'' in the EastEnders' cast -- had launched an unprovoked
''loutish'' and ''savage'' attack on the estate agent, using a half-pint
glass as a weapon.
Mr Falshaw from Loughton, Essex, had claimed the actor, an
acquaintance of several years, had first approached him swearing and
shouting before pushing him in the chest and then hitting him.
He said he was left blinded by blood from a head wound almost an inch
long and later needed to go to hospital.
He told the jury he could offer no explanation for what had happened.
But Mr Owen, of Lonsdale Road, Wanstead, east London, who joined
EastEnders straight from school, said that far from being the instigator
of the early-morning violence, he had been the victim.
He said Mr Falshaw, a ''quite rowdy'' individual, had been ''very
drunk'' and had ''lied'' to the jury and falsely made him out to be a
troublemaker.
Mr Owen said that Mr Falshaw had become abusive and had tried to
head-but him, but as he did so Mr Owen instinctively raised his hands to
protect himself, causing Mr Falshaw to accidentally strike his head on
the glass he was holding.
Judge Andrew Brooks granted the actor his defence costs.
The court heard that Mr Falshaw had been approached by a newspaper
to sell his story during the trial.

LAWYERS acting for a Clydebank minister, the Rev Tom Logan, have
threatened to return to court this week because they claim Dumbarton
Presbytery has reneged on a commitment given at an earlier hearing.
However the Kirk, anxious to assert its right to administer its
affairs free from the jurisdiction of the civil authorities, issued a
strong defence of its conduct.
Following receipt of a letter from Mr Logan's lawyer, which the
presbytery described as ''threatening'', the presbytery took the unusual
step of publicly asserting its independence from the civil courts and of
re-affirming its decision to appoint a minister to act in Mr Logan's
place while he is under suspension.
Mr Logan's lawyer, Mr Colin Cameron, wrote that ''unless the
presbytery withdraws the appointment of an interim moderator . . . we
will proceed to the Court of Session prior to Friday, (because) the
presbytery has not honoured the undertaking given by its counsel''.
However, last night Mr Cameron said he did not intend to return to the
Court of Session as long as the interim moderator did not take an active
role in Abbotsford Parish.
Yesterday the main protagonist for the presbytery, the Rev John
Cairns, said he knew of no undertaking to withdraw the interim
moderator. The presbytery's statement ''reaffirms the exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts of the church in dealing with spiritual
matters, including discipline, and in particular the exclusive
jurisdiction of the presbytery of Dumbarton in the case against the Rev
Tom Logan.''
The prospect of being hauled back to a court which it considers has no
jurisdiction was viewed with anger by leading ministers in Dumbarton
presbytery.
Yesterday's moves follow the granting of an interim interdict by Lord
Osborne in the Court of Session on March 17, against the presbytery,
''freezing'' the suspension of Mr Logan pending trial for his refusal to
obey a presbytery ban on his activities with the networking firm Amway.
On March 23, the Kirk argued before Lord Osborne that the Court of
Session had no jurisdiction over its affairs. He continued the
interdict, promising a written opinion clarifying the relationship
between Church and State.
The latest round in the bitter dispute centres round a meeting of the
kirk session of Mr Logan's church, Abbotsford, Clydebank, called for
tomorrow evening. After the Court of Session hearing, the presbytery did
not enforce its suspension but ordered Mr Logan to read a notice making
it clear they were taking no action for the sake of peace. A kirk
session meeting was requested by office bearers to deal with ordinary
matters to be chaired by interim moderator the Rev Fergus Buchanan, of
St Paul's Milngavie.
The presbytery's statement said that in order to avoid a clash with
the Court of Session, tomorrow's meeting would not now go ahead.
Mr Logan said yesterday he could not comment on the case.

<HEADLINE>University rejects order to give lecturer her job back</HEADLINE>

THE Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen is rejecting an industrial
tribunal's order to give a sacked lecturer her job back.
The university has decided to take the option of returning to the
tribunal to argue that re-engagement is impractical.
In April 1993, after 27 years' service, senior lecturer Sheena
Falconer, of Anderson Drive, Aberdeen, was offered redundancy or an
alternative post which would have meant putting her sister, also a
lecturer, out of work.
Colleagues held a series of one-day strikes in support of Mrs
Falconer, but she was dismissed and her case went before an industrial
tribunal.
Last month, the tribunal declared she had been unfairly dismissed and
ordered that she be given her job back by April 17 and be given back pay
of #40,977.52.
The tribunal concluded Mrs Falconer had not been made redundant,
because when university principal, Dr David Kennedy, made the decision
to dismiss her he did not have all the relevant facts before him.
It also said the university distorted the true picture by
concentrating on what it saw as the primary component of her function to
the exclusion of all else she was employed to do.
The university said yesterday that it had carefully examined the
tribunal's findings and consulted Mrs Falconer in a number of meetings
and letters.
It had now written to Mrs Falconer inviting her to accept that
re-engagement was not practical.
It said that over the last two years the School of Food and Consumer
Studies in which she worked had functioned smoothly and without the need
for additional staff, therefore her re-engagement would place the
university in the position of having to consider the redundancy of some
other person.
It said they could find no suitable academic or non-academic post in
the university and if they created an additional non-self financing
post, funding it would worsen the already serious financial prospects
facing the university.
''Accordingly the university has come to the view that it is not
practicable to re-engage Mrs Falconer since it would exacerbate an
already difficult financial situation and jeopardise the jobs of other
staff members,'' a statement said.
No-one from the university was available for further comment last
night. There was no indication if it was contesting the back-pay award,
but Mrs Falconer said that she had not received any money so far.
She said last night: ''I have just been handed the letter at the door.
I am absolutely staggered, but not entirely surprised.
''I will have to discuss the situation with my lawyer and my union,
the Educational Institute of Scotland, in the morning.''

ONE in three children in Scotland is living in poverty and a quarter
live in households dependent on income support, according to the charity
Save the Children.
The report by its Child Poverty Resource Unit blames growing child
poverty on the increase in long-term unemployment, reductions in the
value of benefits, particularly child benefit, and the spread of
low-paid, part-time work.
A spokesman for the CPRU said: ''The number of children in poverty in
Scotland has trebled in 15 years. Poverty is not simply about lack of
income: it adversely affects health, education, and housing choice, and
damages children's chances for the future.
''There is a gulf between rich and poor, and poverty is growing. The
trend will continue unless drastic action is taken now.''
The report also revealed that 20% of Scottish families are now headed
by a lone parent, 90% of whom are women. The revelation comes on the
second birthday of the Child Support Agency which was marked yesterday
with a demonstration by One Plus, a lobby group for one-parent families.
The director of One Plus, Mr John Findlay, said: ''In January, Peter
Lilley was forced to make changes to the Child Support Act, but the aim
was to silence the CSA's most outspoken critics, not to put the
children's welfare first.
''His proposals do nothing to tackle the poverty faced by the many
mothers who are usually the carers. The CSA is hated by absent parents,
feared by lone mothers, and is fast losing public support. We need a
fairer system. One-parent families are forgotten families.''
A spokesman for the CSA, Mr David Hale, said: ''The agency has traced
over 66,000 absent parents for whom the parent with care could not
provide a current address -- a success rate of 73%.
''More than 26,000 deductions from earnings orders have been made
where the absent parent has failed to make payments, and the average
weekly maintenance assessment of #35-#45 is much higher than the #25-#30
under the former discretionary system.''
Ms Marion Davis of One Plus said: ''Most lone parents and absent
fathers oppose the Act, and the changes in January don't tackle the
criticisms. We want the Government to look at the wider issues of
poverty.''

THE possibility of Scotland's independent and state schools sharing
sporting facilities and combining classes was last night at the centre
of significant debate, as the future of the Government's assisted-place
scheme was put under the microscope.
Discussion on the issue came as it was revealed that fee-paying George
Watson's College in Edinburgh had a plan to share facilities and classes
with three well-respected schools in the public sector.
However, Mrs Elizabeth Maginnis, chair of Lothian education committee,
said she had told the schools approached -- Balerno High School, James
Gillespie's, and Royal High School -- not to take part in any sharing
scheme.
She described George Watson's approach, which she said was made
directly to the schools rather than to the education department, as
''impertinent and puzzling''.
Despite the rejection Mrs Rose Bell, of the Scottish Council for
Independent Schools, said there was a possibility that other independent
schools would come up with similar plans.
Tory regional councillor Ian Hoy said sharing facilities made good
sense and backed the school's plan.
Councillor Hoy said he abhorred the ''them-and-us'' attitude and said
elitism would return if the assisted place scheme, which allows children
from less well-off families to attend independent schools, were
abolished.
The Labour Party has given a commitment to abolish the scheme. Mrs
Maginnis, a Labour councillor, said independent schools were worried
about the future and the numbers attending the school.
Mrs Bell denied that independent schools wanted to share facilities to
help them economically because of the anticipated damage caused by
Labour's plans to stop the assisted place scheme.
At present there are 33,000 pupils at the 75 independent schools in
Scotland. Around 3000 of these pupils at 55 of the schools get #10.56m
of public money from the assisted places scheme.
A league table up to the autumn term of last year from the Scottish
Office shows the highest proportion of pupils on the assisted places
scheme at an independent school is at Kilquhanity House School in Castle
Douglas, where half of the 40 pupils get assistance. Other places round
the country on the list include the High School of Dundee (eighth
highest), where 17% of the 1132 pupils receive help.
In Glasgow, St Aloysius College has 15% of its 1078 pupils on the
assisted place scheme and comes twelfth in the table. Keil School,
Dumbarton; Laurel Bank School, Glasgow; Wellington School, Ayr; and
Glenalmond College, Perth are among the others on the list.
Meanwhile, Mrs Maginnis attacked the initial approach by George
Watson's College to the three schools by letter, asking for discussions
on subjects described as of mutual interest.
''The Labour Party has made it clear that they would abolish the
assisted-place scheme,'' she said.
''It is quite clear that the headmaster of George Watson's is pursuing
a political agenda and must be worried about the future of the private
sector under a future Labour Government.
''Equally I am concerned details of this plan have been released on
the eve of the local election. What must be of worry is that this is
part of a wider strategy to re-introduce selection into the state
system.
''Even if you look at the schools George Watson's have approached, all
three are magnet schools with good facilities. They have not looked at
any other state schools which maybe don't have the name of the three
schools chosen.''
Mr Frank Gerstenberg, headmaster of George Watson's, was on holiday
yesterday and unavailable for comment. However the school's development
officer, Lesley McKean, said the headmaster had spoken of plans to
combine some classes and share sporting facilities with state schools.
She said it was clear George Watson's would retain its independence,
have the right to select children according to ability, and stay
fee-paying.
Ms McKean said: ''We did not want to be elitist and are obviously
concerned about the future of the assisted-places funding.
''As the principal has said, where there is spare capacity and a small
take-up in classes, combining with other schools may be an option.''

<TEXT>
LOYALISTS in Northern Ireland warned last night that a large arms
seizure in the Irish Republic could delay the decommissioning of UDA and
UVF arms.
Mr Garry McMichael, of the fringe Ulster Democratic Party which has
links to the outlawed Ulster Defence Association, said it would be
''grossly unrealistic'' to expect loyalists to engage in decommissioning
their weapons when they might be needed for defence against republican
attack.
The authorities in Eire were reported to be convinced that the arms
seizure from a car and van being driven north on the Dublin-Belfast road
had prevented a fresh onslaught by the Irish National Liberation Army.
The haul was grabbed in a well-planned operation at Balbriggan, north
of Dublin. Police used stun grenades to disorientate the occupants to
stop them fleeing or using any of the guns.
Four men tonight appeared before Dublin's Special Criminal Court and
were remanded in custody until April 25.
Mr Anthony Patrick Gorman, 25, of Dalton Road, Armagh City; Mr Hugh
Torney, Mr Sean Braniff, and Mr Dessie McCleery, all 41 and from
Belfast, were charged with having two FN automatic rifles, two
Kalashnikov rifles, two US M-3 sub-machine guns, 20 Browning
semi-automatic pistols, and 2500 rounds of ammunition with intent to
endanger life and for an unlawful purpose.
Mr Gorman escaped extradition from the Irish Republic to Britain in
March last year. He was wanted for questioning about the murder of
British Army recruiting Sergeant Michael Newman, 34, as he left an
office in Derby on April 14, 1992.
Senior police sources said there was little doubt that the attempt to
move such a large stock of weapons to the north was part of a plan by
the INLA to reactivate its camapign.
They believe members of the security forces would have been the
targets.
A senior detective said: ''This is very worrying. The INLA have never
declared a ceasefire and this shows they are still in business.''
Mr McMichael said the seizure of the weapons was a matter of ''great
concern'' and reinforced the unease within the loyalist community
towards the commitment of elements in the republican movement to the
peace process.
He said the INLA had been engaged in targeting loyalists since the IRA
ceasefire and the arms haul was ''a clear indication of their
indications''.
He added that the IRA was also targeting and ''may be preparing to use
the INLA as a dagger to the throat of the peace process''.
The arms issue, he said, was top of the political agenda. However, he
made it clear the latest events would colour loyalist thinking when it
came to discussing giving up their weapons during talks with Northern
Ireland Minister, Mr Michael Ancram.
Mr McMichael said that, while he wanted to see guns taken out of
politics, ''progress on decommissioning is impossible when there is a
clear intent from the INLA and elements of the IRA to derail the
ceasefires.''
However, the Northern Ireland Security Minister, Sir John Wheeler,
said the arms seizure was ''very good news indeed''.

REFORMS which will insure dentists give children's teeth greater
priority, after concerns that they are being refused NHS treatment
because of the costs involved, were promised yesterday.
Health Ministers made the announcement yesterday, but the Government
is yet to work out details of the changes, which include plans to limit
NHS treatments for adults to those that are considered clinically
essential, and will follow talks with the profession.
The introduction of market style reforms in the longer term is also
planned, with health authorities buying care from dental practices.
The announcement follows Opposition claims that thousands of NHS
patients have been struck off dentists' lists because they are not
prepared to pay private fees.
Health Minister Gerald Malone said: ''I believe these reforms will end
uncertainty in the dental profession by addressing principal concerns
voiced about the existing system and will bring high-quality oral health
care for patients and the professions.
''By targeting need more effectively, we will ensure that the taxpayer
gets better value for the #1000m currently spent annually on NHS
dentistry.''
Other changes include reforms to the flat-rate system of payments
dentists receive for adults on their lists.
The British Dental Association was ''cautiously optimistic'' over the
changes.
A spokeswoman said many of the original ''objectionable'' proposals
had been dropped. But there were still ''considerable reservations'' on
the level of funding.
Mr John Hunt, chief executive of the BDA, said: ''The Government
appears now to understand the problems of dentists. It has finally made
its decision on the way forward for NHS dentistry and the BDA looks
forward to meaningful negotiations with the Department of Health.''
Mr David Dickinson, editor of Which? Way to Health, said: ''Nearly
twice as many people are now getting some or all of their treatment
privately, compared with two years ago.
''Reducing the check-up charge could encourage more people to visit
the dentist, but uncertainty about the final bill might still put them
off.''

THE man acquitted of the Wimbledon Common murder of Ms Rachel Nickell
is to face a jury for the first time, after deciding to sue the police
over his arrest and prosecution.
Last night, Ms Nickell's father Andrew said that the evidence against
Mr Colin Stagg would at last be heard, and the ''integrity, honesty, and
hard work'' of the police could be defended.
Mr Stagg is to sue the Metropolitan Police for malicious prosecution
and wrongful arrest. He has been granted legal aid for the civil action.
He said he had promised on his acquittal, last September, to sue the
police ''for ruining my life and putting me in prison for 13 months for
a crime I did not commit''.
Mr Stagg, 31, of Roehampton, south-west London, was cleared of Ms
Nickell's murder after the police were criticised by an Old Bailey judge
for trying to trap him into a confession.
Mr Nickell, 54, of Ampthill, Bedfordshire, said the collapse of the
trial meant that none of the evidence had been put before a jury.
He hoped that ''all the evidence found by the police against Mr Stagg
will now be heard in a civil court, in front of a judge and jury under
their rules of evidence''.
He added: ''The Commissioner will now have the chance, at last, to
defend the integrity, honesty, and hard work shown by all his officers
during the long and painful investigation.''
The murder of 23-year-old Ms Nickell, who was stabbed to death in
front of her young son on Wimbledon Common, south-west London, in July
1992, shocked the nation.
Police launched a huge inquiry, and a year after the murder arrested
Mr Stagg.
An eight-month under-cover operation to secure a confession involved a
woman officer befriending him and trying to lure him, under the
direction of a police psychologist, into admitting his guilt.
That evidence was thrown out by Mr Justice Ognall at the Old Bailey,
prompting the collapse of the trial.
The judge criticised the police for a ''blatant attempt to incriminate
a suspect by positive and deceptive conduct of the grossest kind''.
Scotland Yard said it had yet to receive a writ from Mr Stagg's
solicitors, but it is understood police will want to defend the action
vigorously.
The case is likely to be heard in the High Court, complete with
witnesses and a battery of leading barristers.
It is estimated that Mr Stagg, an unemployed labourer, could receive
up to #225,000 for his 13 months in prison on remand awaiting trial.
However a leading lawyer, experienced in compensation actions against
the police, warned that such cases ran the risk of producing a ''trial
within a trial''.
Mr Robin Lewis, a partner of Bindman and partners in London, said:
''There is the risk of reopening the wounds.''
Another ruling would have to be made about the admissability of
crucial evidence against Mr Stagg collected by the under-cover
policewoman, he added.
Mr Stagg's solicitor, Mr Ian Ryan, said he was not overly concerned
about the police evidence turning the civil action into a trial of his
client.
''The Crown offered no evidence because it had no case once the
under-cover evidence was ruled out.''
Mr Ryan said the proceedings would be initiated over the next few
months.
Police have reopened their inquiry into Ms Nickell's murder without,
so far, any significant results.
Mr Stagg is facing charges of affray, assault, and possession of an
offensive weapon -- an axe -- after an incident on Wimbledon Common in
January this year.
He and his girlfriend, Ms Diane Beddoes, 26, who is also charged with
the same offences, are due to appear before Wimbledon magistrates today,
for a committal hearing to a higher court.
Both are on bail with a condition that they do not go near the common.
The incident involved an argument between the couple, who were out
walking their dog, and another dog owner.
Mr Nickell said in his statement: ''I understand that Mr Stagg has
announced that he is bringing an action against the Commissioner of the
Metropolitan Police for malicious prosecution and wrongful arrest.
''I am somewhat surprised to hear in the same statement that legal aid
has been granted for what is a civil action, when I believe that Mr
Stagg received in excess of #100,000 from newspapers for his story less
than six months ago.
''I sincerely hope that grounds of financial expediency are not now
used to settle out of court,'' he said.
Mr Ryan said his client had sold his story to the newspapers after his
acquittal, but the figure of #100,000 was ''grossly inflated''.

A COUPLE in their 80s suffered head injuries when their car plunged
60ft over a cliff at a West Country beauty spot yesterday.
The couple and their daughter had parked on the cliff top at St Agnes
in Cornwall to admire the view, but when they returned to the car the
driver apparently became confused with the gears and started to drive
towards the cliff edge.
The daughter managed to jump to safety from the moving car, but it
slipped over the edge with her parents inside.
After falling about 6ft and stopping briefly, it plunged more than
50ft to come to rest on its roof.
A full-scale rescue operation was mounted involving a Royal Navy
helicopter, Cornwall's air ambulance, the police, fire brigade, and
coastguards.
Ropes were secured around the car and linked to vehicles on the
clifftop to stop it sliding further.
The couple were pulled to safety and then winched to the clifftop on
stretchers before being flown to Treliske hospital in Truro. Their
injuries are not life-threatening.
Police Sergeant Alan Weekes said: ''It was an automatic car and it
appears he was not used to it.''

A PRIVATE consortium stands ready to take over the running of the West
Highland sleeper, Tayside North MP Bill Walker said yesterday, after
meeting Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney.
Mr Walker, along with Eastwood MP Allan Stewart and Ayr MP Phil
Gallie, claimed they were encouraged by their meeting, which was
arranged to discuss British Rail's decision to discontinue the sleeper
service from May 28.
They said Dr Mawhinney expressed sympathy for their demands that the
full and formal consultation procedure be followed. However, the
Transport Secretary is not prepared to intervene to stop the closure,
and suggested the MPs take up the matter with BR's new chairman, Mr John
Welsby.
Mr Walker said: ''There is a strong prospect of a consortium coming
forward. But the service can only be considered as a proposition if it
is still running, because you need the staff and the rolling stock.''
He would not identify the prospective investors, but claims they are
serious contenders. The three Scottish Tories will now seek a meeting
with Mr Welsby.

SCOTLAND's youth would rally to a Scottish parliament, a poll
published by the Young Scot project shows.
The results of an annual survey carried out by the Scottish Community
Education Council show that 47% of young Scots surveyed back devolution,
an increase of 6.5% on last year, while support for independence dropped
by 2.5% to 22.3%.
Seventy thousand survey forms were distributed in the 1994 Young Scot
handbook.
The council received 943 replies, with the age profile heavily
weighted towards the 15-16 age bracket.
The findings were immediately welcomed by the Scottish Labour Party's
general secretary, Mr Jack McConnell, who said the party's vision of a
better future for a Scotland with its own parliament was ''a clear
winner with Scotland's young people''.
Questioned on their possible voting intentions, the largest segment
(29.7%) admitted to indecision, while 26% backed Labour and 23.9% the
SNP. The Scottish Liberal Democrats received 10% backing, with the
Tories supported by 5.2%.
The results were, however, interpreted as a warning to Labour by the
Scottish National Party, who pointed out the divergence between these
results and The Herald's last System Three poll, published on Tuesday,
which put Labour 28 points clear.
Sir Michael Hirst, chairman of the Scottish Conservatives, dismissed
the poll's findings and questioned its validity.
Mr Jim Boyle, the Young Scot project co-ordinator, said: ''One thing
this survey demonstrates is that young people are interested in many
aspects of life in Scotland and need information about everything to be
disseminated to them.''
Surprisingly, while only 14% admitted they smoked, 32.1% confessed
they had tried illegal substances.
One encouraging aspect of the snapshot of young Scots' attitudes was
their optimism over their future standard of living, Mr Boyle said.
The Herald was cited as their favourite newspaper by 13.8% of the
respondents, an increase of 4.1% on last year.

SCOTTISH professional football's spokesman Mr Tony Higgins remained
philosophical yesterday on receiving confirmation that his counterpart
south of the Border is Britain's highest-paid trade union official.
English football spokesman Mr Gordon Taylor receives a salary and
benefits package of #286,813, according to the annual report of the
certification officer.
Mr Higgins, while not wishing to comment directly on the issue, said:
''It would take me a lifetime to earn that sum.'' He carries out his
Scottish PFA duties through the GMB union in Glasgow and added that he
works within normal union pay rates.
He has, of course, met his English counterpart in the normal course of
their similar duties. ''We have never discussed salaries,'' Mr Higgins
said.
Although England's Professional Footballers' Association, which has
been considering affiliating to the TUC, has only 3500 members, the
chief executive's salary of #158,084, plus benefits, clearly reflects
the salaries enjoyed by many of them.
In the figures, which relate to 1993, Ms Christine Hancock, general
secretary of the 303,000 member non-TUC Royal College of Nursing --
which is complaining about nurses being offered a mere 1% -- is second
in the union ratings with a salary of #71,428 and benefits totalling
#15,803. However, it could be argued that her salary equates with those
of NHS trust managers.
A close third is Mr Peter Smith, general secretary of the non-TUC
Association of Teachers and Lecturers, who in 1993 was on #71,270 plus
benefits of #14,559.
According to the certification officer, Matthew Wake, the top paid
TUC-affiliated general secretary is Doug McAvoy, of the National Union
of Teachers, who was on #64,680 plus #10,454.
However, that position is almost certainly held by National Union of
Mineworkers president Arthur Scargill who, while understood to be on
about #67,000, has ''challenged the need to provide the information''
required under the 1993 Trades Union Reform and Employment Rights Act.
The certification officer says he is pursuing the NUM and its solicitor.
Hard on the heels of Mr McAvoy is Mr Alan Jinkinson, general secretary
of Unison, whose salary of around #64,000 is not recorded because Unison
did not exist when the survey was conducted.

A SECOND infant has died at the Special Care Baby Unit of Ninewells
Hospital, which was closed to new admissions at the end of February,
following the death of a two-week-old girl after an outbreak of
bacterial infections.
Three other babies were also affected by strains of infection. The
Dundee unit was reopened after a fortnight, and the hospital authorities
said no further infections had occured.
Yesterday, however, Dundee Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust admitted that
a second child had died.
The girl, who was the first baby to become infected at the unit on
January 26, had been ill with a strain of the lung infection klebsiella
for two months, and died on Friday last week.
Of the two other babies infected, one has recovered and been allowed
home, while the other is still receiving treatment for infection by the
E-coli virus.

THE Prime Minister was served a double whammy yesterday when his Home
Secretary's judgment was overturned by the Law Lords and his Health
Secretary was bitterly criticised by senior Tory back benchers over her
hospital re-organisations.
Emergency legislation will be introduced to rescue the Home Secretary
in three weeks' time. Labour will be after the Government on hospitals.
Yesterday the Law Lords ruled that Home Secretary Michael Howard had
acted beyond his powers in attempting to change the compensation scheme
for crime victims last year.
Unless the Government makes these changes legal the Chancellor faces a
bill of about #400m. Last year alone #90m in compensation was at stake.
The problems of these two key Ministers in the Major Government
severely undermine the Prime Minister's prospects of regaining the
political initiative after the bad results expected for the Tories in
today's Scottish local elections.
England and Wales poll on May 4, by which time the Tories may have
lost 1200 local council seats. When the Commons returns on April 18, the
Home Secretary and the Health Secretary will be in dire straits.
Yesterday the Law Lords, with a vote of three to two, ruled that Mr
Howard was acting illegally when he introduced a fixed tariff scheme for
the compensation of victims of crime without reference to Parliament.
His new scheme outraged members of the Lords and the Commons on all
sides because it sought to overturn a system operated by the Criminal
Injuries Compensation Board for 30 years.
It was part of the Government's cost-cutting exercise to enable the
Prime Minister and his Chancellor to reduce direct taxes in the Budget
this November. The Government was looking for savings of about #400m
over the next three years.
However the decision of the Law Lords yesterday means the Home
Secretary will have to introduce a new Bill and fight it through both
Houses if these savings are to be made. Last night it was clear that he
will have severe difficulties in doing this.
Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw claimed the Law Lords' decision was
''profoundly humiliating'' for the Home Secretary. He said: ''He has
acted with arrogant disregard both for the welfare of victims of violent
crime and of the need to obtain proper parliamentary approval for
ministerial action.
''Many victims -- including police officers and firefighters -- would
have had their compensation cut to one-tenth of what they would have
received under the previous scheme. The Government has made victims pay
for its failure to stem the rise of violent crime.''
The Government would dearly like to draw stumps on this issue and
accept the Law Lords' decision because the Prime Minister has just
launched a new attempt to persuade the nation that his Government would
be harder on criminals and softer in its treatment of the victims of
crime.
Now Mr Major cannot win, introducing emergency legislation expected to
be started immediately after the Easter recess to try to reinstate the
Home Secretary's changes.
Without these changes the annual cost of payments to victims would
rise from #224m to #550m within seven years. The new scheme is designed
to take no account of a victim's financial and other circumstances.
Concerned Tory back benchers will be arguing after the Easter recess
that the Government should bite the bullet and find the money for both
compensation payments and hospital reforms from the contingency fund.
This might be a better political prospect for the Prime Minister as he
tries to build up political support in the country in the two years
before the next General Election.
The Law Lords' ruling is a victory for the TUC and 10 unions and staff
associations representing firefighters, teachers, nurses, prison
officers, security guards, bank staff, and others who risk violence at
work.
Yesterday Lord Browne-Wilkinson said the decision to introduce the new
tariff-based system, with payments ranging from #1000 for a chipped
tooth to #250,000 for the seriously crippled, without going back to
Parliament for approval was ''unlawful and an abuse of power''.
Lord Lloyd of Berwick agreed, saying if a Minister had exceeded or
abused his powers the courts were not ''acting in opposition to the
legislature, or treading on parliamentary toes'' if they intervened.
On the contrary, they were ''ensuring that the powers conferred by
Parliament are exercised within the limits, and for the purposes, which
Parliament intended''.
Mr Frank Maguire, of the Glasgow office of Robin Thomson and Partners,
who acted for the unions, said: ''This is major victory for victims of
violent crime and will apply in Scotland.
''The House of Lords has confirmed that the Home Secretary acted
unlawfully. He should now withdraw the tariff scheme without further
delay.''
Meanwhile, Health Secretary Virginia Bottomley was crushed in the
Commons by furious London Tory MPs led by former Cabinet Minister and
party chairman Mr Peter Brooke over her plans to close ancient and
world-renowned teaching hospitals like St Bartholomews, founded in the
twelfth century.
When the Easter recess ends on April 18, the Labour Party is expected
to force a vote in the Commons on this issue with the threat of a large
Tory rebellion.
Senior Tory Sir Rhodes Boyson compared what she was proposing to the
destruction of the grammar schools and Labour MPs cheered on Government
back benchers as one after another they called on Mrs Bottomley to
reconsider.
She stuck to her guns and argued that the case for change in London,
which had over-provision of some types of hospital at the expense of
other areas of the country, was long overdue.
Mr Brooke, who the previous day had accused her of lacking moral
courage in failing to announce the proposals to the Commons in person,
said Barts was a national and international asset which should be
preserved and enhanced.
Shadow Health Secretary Margaret Beckett accused her of ''clinical and
financial vandalism'' and said the whole programme should be reassessed.
Last night the signal from 10 Downing Street was that Mr Major would
support both his Cabinet colleagues in order to deliver the expenditure
plans already accepted by Parliament, the City, and the world money
markets.

SEVEN car ferries run by Clyde and Western Isles ferry operator
Caledonian MacBrayne and two by P&amp;O Scottish were listed yesterday by
the Government among 65 UK vessels which need modifications to comply
with international ''survivability standard'' regulations drawn up in
the light of recent sea disasters.
The list of vessels was published as Transport Secretary Brian
Mawhinney announced that the Government is to press for the fitting of
watertight compartments to the car decks of all roll-on, roll-off
ferries to avoid a repeat of the Estonia disaster.
However, the UK must first convince shipping's world body, the
International Maritime Organisation (IMO), that transverse bulkhead
fitments are vital.
Mr Colin Paterson, chief executive of CalMac, which operates 31
vessels and carries 6.2 million passengers a year in Scotland, stressed
that all the operator's vessels substantially met the regulations of the
Safety Of Lives at Sea (Solas) convention, governing international
maritime safety.
''All except one of our vessels complies with 95% of all safety
requirements to address Solas 90,'' he said. ''Even those that are
slightly short of Solas 90 requirements will be brought up in a phased
programme agreed by the Marine Safety Agency and other regulatory
bodies.''
Mr Paterson said CalMac had spent about #2.5m on required extra safety
measures since the Herald of Free Enterprise and Estonia disasters. He
emphasised that the ferry operator, which undertakes 700 ro-ro voyages
daily during the summer months, ''would never, ever compromise on
safety''.
''We are fortunate that our safety record is second to none, and want
it to remain that way,'' he said.
Dr Mawhinney told the Commons that UK tests had shown fitting the
bulkheads could improve a vessel's survivability.
He also disclosed that the IMO's panel of experts would make a
recommendation next month that ''points to the fitting of transverse
bulkheads''.
The Transport Secretary published, for the first time, a
''survivability standard'' list of ro-ro ferries operating in and out of
UK ports. A total of 27 ships -- 14 of them British -- met the 1990
standards, while 65 needed modifications.
Ship safety has been much discussed since the Zeebrugge disaster in
1987 -- in which more than 190 people died -- and the Estonia tragedy
last September which claimed more than 900 lives.
Dr Mawhinney said that after the Estonia incident he asked the UK's
Marine Safety Agency to conduct computer-modelling research. This showed
''that the fitting of transverse bulkheads can further enhance the
survivablity of a ship with water on its car deck''.
He went on: ''In the light of this research, I believe it is incumbent
on the Government, together with operators and the international
maritime community, to seek to agree further improvements to
survivability standards and to introduce transverse bulkheads to ro-ro
ferries as appropriate.''
The UK Chamber of Shipping said: ''All these vessels are 100% safe --
the public can be assured of that. We keenly await the report from the
IMO panel of experts.''
The Consumers' Assocation, which has fought a long battle to have
ferry safety standards publicised, said it welcomed the Government's
publishing of the list.
Stena Sealink and P&amp;O European Ferries -- the UK's two main ferry
companies -- stressed that all their vessels were safe whether they met
1990 standards or needed modifications.
The Government's ''survivability standard'' list of vessels, which did
-- or did not -- meet standards laid down in 1990 refers to the Safety
of Lives at Sea (Solas) convention governing international maritime
safety. The 1990 amendment to that convention -- Solas 90 -- sought to
improve survivablity in the event of an accident.
Solas 90 was intended for all ro-ros built since April 29, 1990. Those
built before then come into the second list published yesterday and are
vessels which need modifications. However, all ships are deemed safe as
they all meet current stability standards.

DIRECTORS at a home for severely handicapped children are coming under
increasing pressure to clear up the controversy surrounding the sacking
of the former matron for no apparent reason.
The dismissal of Mrs Eleanor ''Lynn'' McCreadie from East Park Home in
Maryhill, Glasgow, happened two weeks ago.
It has now been reported that the new general manager, Mrs May
Henderson, is involved in a relationship with the man who carried out a
staff review at the home -- Dr Kenneth McAlpine, a geriatrician at
Paisley's Royal Alexandra Hospital.
The appointment of Mrs Henderson, the charity-run home's former
administrator, has been criticised because she knew Dr McAlpine and has
no formal medical qualifications.
The home has declined to go into the reasons why Mrs McCreadie was
dismissed and replaced with Mrs Henderson, but it has stated that
professional misconduct was not involved.
However a statement issued by the board of directors yesterday further
clouded the issue by implying that Mrs McCreadie had not been dismissed
as a result of the review headed by Dr McAlpine.
It said that Mrs Henderson was in overall charge and the depute
matron, Miss Isobel Stewart, was in charge of nursing staff, with
children ''receiving the same medical care and attention as before''.
It added: ''The board also confirms that it did set up an internal
review and it is still considering the findings and has not yet reached
any conclusions.''
The Labour MP for Maryhill, Mrs Maria Fyfe, has written to the
chairwoman of the board, Mrs Paddy Burnett. In the letter she expresses
concern that Dr McAlpine is not a specialist in children with severe
learning disabilities.
She adds: ''I would be glad if you could let me know whether any
specialist in children with severe disablities has been called in and
whether you have the services of a professional adviser on staff/patient
ratios.''
She told The Herald she would raise the issues with Greater Glasgow
Health Board and the Strathclyde social work department if the home
refused to provide the information requested.
Dr Matthew Dunnigan, a consultant physician at Stobhill Hospital who
works with the children at East Park, said: ''It is time to clear up the
whole bizarre episode -- they can't keep sticking their heads in the
sand.
''The potential casualties of this furore are the children at the
home.''
Dr McAlpine declined to comment when approached by The Herald. Despite
numerous attempts to contact Mrs Henderson, she was not available
yesterday.
Mrs McCreadie said she had been advised not to comment.

<HEADLINE>Jury clears scientist of manufacturing ecstacy</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>979026239</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A SCIENTIST who accidentally made ecstasy worth #400,000 while working
on a revolutionary air freshener was found not guilty of manufacturing
the drug at Snaresbrook Crown Court yesterday.
Mr James Edgar, 46, who spent nearly 18 months in custody awaiting
trial, said he had no idea one of his experiments had gone wrong until
after police raided his laboratory.
During the ''highly unusual'' case, he told the east London court that
since the early 1980s, he had been working on an anti-pollutant called
Airborne Ten.
His product was designed to combat environmental hazards such as
sewage odours, and even acid rain, he said.
The problem was that ecstasy's chemical formula, MDMA, was very
similar to that of his product, MDMPA.
Mr Edgar said that water boards, which regularly had to cope with
complaints about unpleasant smells from their sewage treatment plants,
had shown an interest in his work.
Mr Edgar, of Cheffins, Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, said his product had
been tried out on a pig farm and had featured on BBC1's Countryfile
programme.
During his research he ran into a few teething problems because
chemicals he had been using ''split'' when subjected to high
temperatures needed in the process, he told the jury.
To try to overcome this, he started experimenting with a chemical
called Safrole. He agreed this had a chemical structure that could be
rendered into a more complex form known as isosafrole, thereby producing
ecstasy.
But, he explained, he felt he had done everything to avoid such an
occurrence. However, it appeared something went wrong and a mysterious
chemical reaction occurred which he could not explain.
The trial was told that detectives discovered the ecstasy when they
raided his laboratory on the St John's industrial estate at Takeley,
Essex, in November 1993.
Sixteen flasks of the drug -- weighing 1.3kg and described by Judge
Richard Haworth as a ''bathtubful'' -- were recovered and analysed as
the scientist protested his innocence.
Mr Jeremy Carter Manning, QC, prosecuting, admitted that the case was
highly unusual. It was accepted the accused had not only known how to
make ecstasy, but produced it. It was the Crown's case, however, that
rather than making it as a result of a fluke, it had been done
deliberately and knowingly.
After the jury's verdict, the judge ruled that a further seven counts
relating to the alleged manufacture of steroids and trade mark offences
against Mr Edgar be dropped.

A RETIRED storeman yesterday toasted the Indian fortune teller who
predicted his #450,000 pools win nearly 50 years ago.
Pensioner Donald Steel, from Juniper Green, Edinburgh, was an RAF
airman on active duty in Asia during the Second World War when he was
told by a local seer: ''You will win two fortunes in your life.''
Three years after the war he won just over #2000 on the pools and he
fulfilled the second part of the prophesy when he hit the pools jackpot
again at the weekend.
An overjoyed Mr Steel said he would like to meet the beggar again to
thank him for his lucky predictions, but has ruled out a return trip to
India.
Mr Steel, who superstitiously chooses different numbers for his coupon
every week, was in a Calcutta street when the beggar stopped and asked
if he could read his palm.
Mr Steel said: ''I gave him my hand and the few pence he had asked for
and just smiled when he said I would be given huge sums of money not
once, but twice, in my lifetime. I didn't believe him, but I was polite
enough and just walked off.''
Five years later, the soothsayer's first prediction came true with his
first win on Littlewoods pools.
''As the years went by, I thought my first win had just been luck and
gave up hope of winning again. You could have knocked me down with a
feather when my numbers came up again on Saturday, exactly 47 years and
one day after my first win.
''Just a few days before, my horoscope had predicted I would be
receiving a cheque some time within the month of April and that morning
it said that by the end of the day I would have a twinkle in my eye.''
Mr Steel and his wife Helen, who are planning a celebratory trip to
Italy, yesterday picked up the winning Littlewoods cheque from
three-times world bowls champion Richard Corsie at an Edinburgh hotel.
The Hearts fan won with an 8 from 10 full-perm, but joked he could
have won much more if rival Edinburgh team Hibs had pulled off a
score-draw.

A HOTEL and marina complex costing #3m is to be built on Bute,
bringing to an end 10 years of speculation over the West Bay site in
Rothesay and creating the potential for economic regeneration of the
Clyde island.
Carluke-based MacDonald Developments (Scotland) Limited has purchased
the prime, one-acre seafront site for the construction of a 40-60
bedroom, three-star hotel, a 150-berth marina, and breakwater.
Announcing the company's plans for West Bay, Mr Ronnie MacDonald,
managing director of MacDonald Developments Ltd, said: ''We have
concluded negotiations to acquire this prime site and now our
development team will be putting plans to the district council.
''We have also had preliminary discussion with the Isle of Bute
Sailing Club which occupies the adjacent land and it is our intention to
include them and their premises in the overall development plans. Their
plans for expanding water sports activities on the island will be
included in this scheme at the West Bay.''
M Ray Dalton, Commodore of the IBSC, said: ''There are major
opportunities for Bute in the professional development of a whole range
of water sports activities, from keel boat racing and cruising and
dinghy sailing to wind surfing and diving.
''Over the past 12 months, we have been formulating our plans for a
new water sports centre located at the club's West Bay site and have
already had detailed discussions with the local enterprise company.
''We now hope to work in conjunction with MacDonald Developments
(Scotland) Ltd in pursuit of these objectives, which will transform the
West Bay area into one of the most attractive sites in the west of
Scotland and one which could be of enormous economic benefit for Bute.''
Mr MacDonald, who confirmed that his company will own the site and the
hotel, said that there could be work for local contractors during
construction.
The site, which contains the ruins of Rothesay's former seafront
bathing station, was originally purchased by local island businessman Mr
Innes Farquhar in 1983.
He had planned a transit marina and eight on-shore houses, each with
their own yacht moorings, overlooking the Cowal peninsula and the
entrance to the Kyles of Bute.
However, Mr Farquhar said that, after a decade of delays and planning
objections from members of Argyll and Bute District Council, he had been
forced to sell the seafront property to an outside developer.
''It may have taken 14 years of battling with those in authority, but
at long last I have succeeded in bringing this development to
fruition,'' he said.
''Everyone involved must now work together quickly to ensure that this
vital project for Bute becomes a reality in the very near future.''
The plans for the West Bay have been welcomed by Argyll and the
Islands Enterprise.
AIE project officer for Bute Mr David Roberts said: ''Although it is
early days, we are fully behind these new proposals and look forward to
seeing the West Bay development advance. The same funding package is
available to this new developer as there was to the previous
applicant.''
Up to #8m has been planned by the local enterprise company for the
regeneration of Bute, which has suffered 25 years of decline in tourism
and investment. The island has one of the highest unemployment figures
in the Western Highlands.

CHILDREN may have to be turned away from a Scottish hospital from
today because of a staffing shortage which precipitated the resignation
of a junior doctor.
Mothers expecting high-risk babies may also be transferred from
Stirling Royal Infirmary to other hospitals if they are not in labour,
according to plans drawn up to cope with the crisis.
Dr Bryan Connor, 26, resigned his post as a senior house officer in
the hospital's paediatric unit and leaves today.
One of three other SHOs has threatened to resign if her own hours are
extended to fill Dr Connor's place, and a third has gone off sick after
catching chickenpox from one of her patients.
South African-born Dr Connor, who gave notice of his resignation a
month ago, accused managers at the NHS Trust of placing intolerable
demands on junior staff, expecting them to work beyond British Medical
Association agreed hours.
He is preparing to take up a locum post at Dunfermline's Queen
Margaret Hospital.
Dr Connor claimed the trust were struggling to fill his position,
leaving three juniors doctors stretched to maintain round-the-clock
cover. He said the staffing crisis was likely to precipitate a planned
amalgamation of paediatric care between Stirling Royal and Falkirk Royal
hospitals.
Dr Jack Beattie, consultant paediatrician and clinical director for
women and children's services, denied that babies already in special
care would be transferred to other hospitals.
''That service is manned by more experienced, middle grade junior
doctors and they will still be here,'' he said.
Dr Beattie said no child would be put at risk. ''I'll not allow that
to happen. I'm not in the risk game.''
However he conceded: ''We may have to restrict admissions and divert
some patients to Falkirk or Yorkhill. We are now struggling to find a
locum, but we do guarantee a safe service. If we can't handle them we
won't admit them in the first place.
''The other doctor who was thinking of resigning was under the
impression she would have to fill the gap, but that will not be the
case.
''Dr Connor is willing to stay as a locum if he gets more money -- we
are carrying out an audit to determine if we are underpaying the juniors
and are signed up to pay more if that is the case, but he does not want
to wait, he wants the money up front.
''When he started we had a seasonal problem due to the bronchial
infection RSV, but last weekend there were only five patients in the
children's ward.''
The Stirling paediatric unit, which has 19 children's beds and 15 beds
in its special care baby unit, provides a joint area service for Forth
Valley with Falkirk Royal Infirmary Trust, with a shared staff. There
are proposals in the health board's acute services strategy to
rationalise some services, including paediatrics, at one or other
hospital.
Dr Connor said: ''Junior doctors are emigrating to Australia and New
Zealand where conditions are more human. There are so many problems
stemming from trust hospitals trying to save money. Hours are being cut
but staffing levels are not being increased. It's outrageous.''
The chief executive of the Stirling Royal NHS Trust, Mr Alan Hunter,
admitted the trust was carrying out an investigation into junior
doctors' hours and that it could affect the way the hospital provides
paediatric care.
The BMA stipulates that junior doctors must work no more than 72 hours
-- a basic 40-hour week plus 32 hours on call of which 16 hours must be
sleep or rest time.
The local BMA representative, Dr Paul Scott, criticised the delay in
advertising for a locum since Dr Connor put in his notice a month ago.
The post is to be advertised in this week's British Medical Journal.
Dr Scott said: ''These doctors are getting nothing like the rest-time
they should -- more like two hours a night rather than eight. They are
up all night every third night in the special care baby unit, which is
very stressful. If they lose one of the four -- whether through
holidays, essential study leave, sickness, or someone going to cover at
Falkirk -- that goes to one night in two.''
He added that the fourth junior may be unavailable, since she was due
to go on holiday this weekend. Dr Beattie said: ''I am not aware of
that. We have a doctor at Falkirk on holiday cover who will be coming
back.''
The BMA Junior Doctors' chairman for Scotland, Dr Peter Bennie, said:
''What is unusual about Dr Connor's case is not the hours he was being
forced to work, which are still all too common, but the fact that
someone has had the courage to take a stand against this treatment.''

THE chairman of Scottish Natural Heritage, Mr Magnus Magnusson, is
taking a #12,000 pay cut in his annual salary to help the public body
save jobs and fund projects.
His lead has been followed by almost all the group's board members,
who have agreed to take less money in their annual remuneration.
With more than 50 people involved in the main board, four regional
boards and a scientific advisory committee, the savings will amount to
over #70,000 a year.
Their public spirit is in contrast to the directors of recently
privatised industries who have seen their salaries double in some cases.
Mr Magnusson, who is also known for his television work, including
Mastermind, said last night that he felt he had to lead by example.
''I stepped forward to the block first, as it were,'' he said.
He was full of praise for his fellow board members, saying: ''I think
it's a marvellous move. Our board members are certainly not greedy.
''They are in it because they are totally committed to the cause of
the natural heritage.''
Mr Magnusson took the biggest cut himself from his #52,000 salary. The
board members will see financial compensation for their part-time work
fall from #6474 to #5179.
Technically, they are paid for two-and-a-half days' work a month,
though Mr Magnusson emphasised that they attend board meetings, go on
site visits, negotiate with other bodies and read up on an enormous
amount of legislation.
This will drop to two paid days, even though no-one will actually do
less work for the organisation.
Most put in far more hours than that for SNH, a public-funded body
which advises the Government on conservation and wildlife issues, as
well as giving millions of pounds in grants to heritage projects.
An SNH spokesman said: ''These savings will enable SNH to devote more
resources to projects aimed at conserving and enhancing the natural
heritage on the ground.
''These projects include managing funds to improve access to the
countryside, and research work into recovery of some of Scotland's
rarest species.
''It will also help fund the extra staff effort needed for Natura
2000, which is ensuring Scotland's contribution to protecting some of
Europe's most vulnerable species.''
The SNH board has been caricatured in the past as simply being a
collection of rich land-owners.
However, Mr Magnusson described such a suggestion as ''poppycock''.
He said: ''We have some people on the local boards who would never be
in the newspapers or be in Debretts, who work extrememly hard. Wise,
sensible, practical people.''
There are titled people amongst the regional board members such as
Lord Strathnaver, Lady Isobel Glasgow, and Sir John Lister-Kaye Bt.
There are also scientists, retired civil servants, solicitors, climbers,
farmers, and conservationists.
The annual budget for SNH is over #40m a year, but with only a one per
cent increase in funding this year, there were fears that jobs would
have to be cut as has happened in the equivalent bodies in England and
Wales.
So far this has been avoided, and the #70,000 saving will make it
easier to keep people on when their contracts come to an end if there is
a job still to be done, said Mr Magnusson.

An appreciation by ANDREW YOUNG.
GEORGE SINGLETON, one of the leading figures in the cultural life of
Glasgow for many decades, has died at the age of 95.
He was mainly known as the founder of the Cosmo Cinema -- the first
specialised picture house outside of London -- and was epitomised by the
little sketch of Mr Cosmo, a man in a bowler hat and bow tie, drawn by
Charles Oakley.
However he was a supporter of the arts across the board in the city.
He had been on the board of the Scottish Orchestra (now the Royal
Scottish National Orchestra), and was chairman of the Citizens' Theatre
when Giles Havergal was appointed as artistic director.
Born in Bridgeton, Glasgow, a few minutes into January 1, 1900, he
never had a problem in knowing exactly what age he was: a man as old as
the century, but always young at heart.
For the past few years he had been living with his daughter Kathryn,
in Edinburgh. He travelled through by train every week for lunch with
the Friday Mob, his old friends at the Glasgow Art Club.
They were also known as the Tuscany Boys, because of their love of
travelling to see works of art in foreign parts.
Mr John C Neil, aged 86, his friend and lawyer since the 1930s, who
helped him start the Cosmo, said: ''The trouble on our holidays was that
I always had difficulty keeping up with George. He was a great walker.
When he came through from Edinburgh he would catch a taxi up to the Art
Club from Queen Street and walk back down the hill.''
He was also known as a dapper dresser, a man of style and elegance. In
this respect, there was great rivalry between him and fellow Art Club
member Emilio Coia. Last year, he had been critical of the artist's
dress sense and sent him to his tailor in Princes Street, Edinburgh. The
next time Emilio appeared in the club he was resplendent in a pair of
tartan trews of the type sported by George.
A fortnight ago, he had acquired a splendid Armani suit to wear at his
granddaughter's wedding.
He got into the cinema right at the beginning because his father, who
ran a printing business, could also play the piano and used to provide
the accompaniment to the early silent films.
His father then began putting on film shows in town halls and rooms
above pubs. The 12-year-old George would go down the aisle with a tray
shouting: ''Sweets, cara-mels, choc-o-latts.''
He left school at 15, and when he was 17 went into the business in his
own right, starting up dozens of cinemas all over Glasgow and beyond.
Although he had a limited knowledge of languages, he admired quality
films from the Continent, and realised a dream when he built the Cosmo
(an abbreviation of Cosmopolitan) which opened in May 1939, with the
French film Un Carnet de Bal.
It was never regarded as an ''arty cinema'' and became a Mecca for
students.
The family ran it until 1972, when it was sold to the Scottish Film
Council and became the GFT.
Last September, he and son Ronald went on a cruise to Russia, where he
had been many times before.
''He got a chance to re-visit the works in the Hermitage Museum in St
Petersburg, which he loved,'' said Ronald.
This year, he had planned a Mediterranean cruise and another jaunt
with three of the Friday Mob, John C Neil, Iain MacPherson, and Angus
McDougall.
His first wife Jean, died in 1964, and his second wife Marjorie, five
years ago.
He was very fit until a week ago, when he was taken to Edinburgh Royal
Infirmary.
His daughter Kathryn said last night: ''He went out in style on
Tuesday night, kissed the nurses, and gave them a wee wave as he was
taken off for an exploratory operation. By that time he was very weak,
and died in the theatre.''
