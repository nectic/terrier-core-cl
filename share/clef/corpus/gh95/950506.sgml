THEY lie east of the Meadow of the Lapwings, below the Hill of the
Rocks. For a thousand years and more, the remains of 60 Celtic and
Nordic kings have lain undisturbed beneath stone tablets in the
graveyard of Orain, lulled by the eternal requiem of waves washing on
the shores of Iona.
The medieval effigies that adorned their tombs were removed to the
adjacent abbey museum 20 years ago to protect their ornate carving from
the elements. Now daisies and delicate blue toadflax carpet the uneven
turf above the long-forgotten kings of Scotland, Ireland and Norway.
There could hardly be a more fitting site for kings and lords of the
isles to contemplate eternity than this remote Hebridean island with its
lyrical Gaelic place-names. Ever since it was sanctified by the
pilgrimage of St Columba in 563AD, it has been a spiritual oasis. It is
a place where people feel close to God.
Even Samuel Johnson, no great admirer of 18th century Scotland, was
moved to observe: ''That man is little to be envied, whose patriotism
would not gain force upon the plain of Marathon, or whose piety would
not grow warmer among the ruins of Iona.''
The tranquillity of the sacred burial ground has been disturbed by a
more recent arrival, however. The burial last year of John Smith, the
Labour Party leader, in a new part of the cemetery has brought tens of
thousands of curious tourists tramping over the adjacent graves of
native islanders.
On the anniversary of his death, there is resentment at the manner in
which Mr Smith's funeral arrangements were made without consulting the
islanders, and indignation at the damage done to the graves of relatives
and friends.
Part of the problem is that there are no fences in the little
graveyard, and only one clear path which skirts the 12th century St
Orain's chapel and ends at the newer section opened in the 1970s.
Thereafter, visitors are left to wander by a row of recent graves to
that of Mr Smith, which is second from the end.
The problem is compounded by an ancient custom, by which islanders are
buried with their feet to the east, and in this case against a low
dry-stone wall; their recumbent headstones of red Ross of Mull granite
face the same way, making them difficult to read without walking over
the graves to the wall.
To prevent such desecration of Mr Smith's grave, the abbey authorities
placed his tombstone against the wall, making it clearly visible from a
few steps away. It is a small stone with a bronze plaque, bearing the
simple legend: John Smith 13.9.38 -- 12.5.94.
This does not prevent day-trippers from walking over the adjacent
graves to the wall, however, to discover who is buried beside him; or
others who do the same to pose for photographs beside his tombstone.
From a nearby hillock last week, I watched dozens of people pause
momentarily before the grave and then tramp over the remains of his
island neighbours.
The most common route is over a patchwork of uneven ground, bearing no
headstone. Beneath it lies Calum ''Cammy'' Cameron, a local crofter, who
died three years ago.
There have been no formal protests, because that is not the Hebridean
way. Islanders are reticent about discussing such grievances with
outsiders, and when they do, it is with sadness rather than anger.
Mr Jimmy Beaton, who came from Mull to work the Cnoc Orain croft on
Iona almost 50 years ago, buried his wife Catherine in 1980. She now
lies close to Mr Smith, and the grass above her grave bears the scars of
careless feet.
''It's a shame the way people tramp over the graves,'' he says in a
soft Highland accent. ''Ye see it's awfy crammed, wi' wee paths, it's
not nicely laid out at all. And Smith should never have been buried
there. He was an outsider who only came here on his holidays. There are
thousands of people who come here every year, good folk, but when their
time comes they're buried in their own places. But I'd better say no
more tae ye.''
Mr Crawford Morison, the island postmaster and a church elder, came to
Iona from Glasgow only seven years ago, and is less reticent. ''The
decision to bury Smith here was taken quickly by people in Argyll in
charge of the cemetery. It isn't designed to cope with so many visitors.
In some ways, maybe it would have been better if a special place had
been found for Smith on the island.''
Mr Morison says the matter has not been formally raised by the island
community council, of which he is a member, but that he favours a simple
solution: a small fence at the entrance to the new section of the
graveyard, politely requesting that it be reserved for friends and
relatives of the deceased.
His wife Moira agrees: ''A few people used to browse around the old
burial ground of the kings. But since John Smith was buried there we've
had thousands trampling the local graves, and people are getting a bit
fed up.''
The graves are particularly vulnerable to damage, due to the ground in
the new part being water-logged. ''The consolation,'' Mrs Morison says
wryly, ''is that if you're not dead when you go in, you'll drown in five
minutes.''
On any other island, it probably would not matter. The vast majority
of visitors to Iona do not come specifically to view Mr Smith's grave.
But its proximity to the abbey and other historical sites means that it
is inundated with tourists, not all of them respectful of hallowed
ground.
The locals have a sympathiser in Mr Tom Heilson from Edinburgh, a
member of the Iona Community, who serves as gateman at the burial
ground. ''I try to encourage people to look at Smith's grave from behind
the boundary wall a few yards away, but they just clamber over the
graves regardless,'' he says. ''We've had workmen in twice levelling the
ground because it was sinking, you could see a noticeable dip.
''I'm a bit sensitive about people walking over graves. Maybe I'm old
fashioned, but I think it's disrespectful.''
Mr Crichton Lang, chief executive of Iona Abbey Ltd, which owns the
site, hopes that interest in Mr Smith's grave will eventually die down
and that he and his neighbours will be left in peace.
''We erected a barricade at first to cope with the rush of visitors,
but then we took it down for a television programme when public interest
began to wane. We would prefer not to put up railings, but rather
preserve the area as a traditional Hebridean burial ground.''
It would be misleading to suggest that the crofters, fishermen, and
the majority of the 100 islanders who earn their living from tourism are
up in arms over the affair. It is a matter for private regret rather
than public anger, and last week they had something more pressing to
worry about. The paddle steamer Waverly dragged her anchor in bad
weather off the island on May Day, damaging a telephone cable and
knocking out half the phones. The residents are now pressing for a
radio-link telephone service.
Despite being inundated by more than 100,000 visitors a year, the
little island off Mull remains a haven of peace. New-born lambs frolic
in spring sunshine by the Bay at the Back of the Ocean, wild flowers are
blooming around the Little Fairy Mound, and the skies above them are
alive with the song of larks.
But the damage to the islanders' graves continues. Argyll and Bute
District Council, which has assumed responsibility for maintaining the
burial ground, says it is considering laying a path to Mr Smith's grave,
avoiding those close to it. This belated gesture may not be sufficient.
Custodians of the site suggest it will not make the slightest difference
to the behaviour of the public.
On the first anniversary of Mr Smith's death on Friday, there will be
eulogies to the man who deserves to be remembered with respect and
affection. It is understood that his family is planning to instal a
larger tombstone. Perhaps it would also be an appropriate time to fence
off the area as Mr Morison suggests, thereby restoring a measure of
dignity and sanctity to Mr Smith's resting place and those of his
neighbours.
It is a modest and timely proposal which one assumes Mr Smith, as a
man of the people who loved the peace and quiet of Iona, would happily
endorse.

Margaret Henderson holidays in the country for a breath of fresh air
THE first time we tried farmhouse B&amp;B, we were greeted with curious
stares and attempts were made to go through our pockets.
No, we hadn't got the local police station by mistake. It was the
right address, Hillhouse Farm, Sandilands, Lanarkshire, where Jeanette
and William Lamb, as well as taking guests, breed Clydesdale horses, and
four of their mares had foaled within a month. When you're a
one-week-old foal, as Vigor was, the world is new and strange and
everything has to be investigated.
When he finally let us go, we peeped into the stable where another new
mother was licking her offspring, born during the night. On our way into
the house we had a cautious look at the Clydesdale stallion, 18 hands
high, and marvelled at the thickness of its neck and the splendid mane.
''Farm holidays are affordable and enjoyable for families,'' Mrs Lamb
pointed out, ''and children are fascinated by all kinds of farm
animals.''
We found Hillhouse Farm in a Farm Holidays Guide to bed and breakfast
and self-catering accommodation on Scottish farms. Offering B&amp;B and
sometimes evening meals, and converting surplus farm buildings into
self-catering cottages provides many a farmer with the extra income
needed to make up for falling profits from agriculture.
In the 1995 FHG, Rockhill Farm, on the south-east shore of Loch Awe,
has views of Priest Island and Cruachan, the hollow mountain. Helen and
Brian Whalley breed sheep and Hanoverian horses and also find time to
produce five-course dinners as well as breakfast for guests. In
contrast, Auchans Farm, near Johnstone, is a working farm only five
minutes from Glasgow Airport. If self-catering is preferred, the guide
has a cluster of converted stables, barns and haylofts on the outskirts
of Ayr with a gymnasium and solarium for the use of residents.
Foodies will be glad to know that farmhouse helpings tend to be
generous. Gourmets need not despair -- a good half-dozen farmhouses
appear in the Taste of Scotland Guide 1995. The farm of Glenmachrie on
Islay has 450 acres of grazing for Scottish blackface sheep and Highland
cattle. Guests can bring their own wine to go with such delicacies as
collops of Glenmachrie lamb in a rowan and rosemary sauce or Dunlossit
Estate venison and prune casserole. Dinner, bed and breakfast will cost
#34 to #38.
A few Scottish farms are mentioned on the pages of the Wolsey Lodges
selection of grand private houses willing to take paying guests. Abbey
Mains farm near Haddington, for example, the ancestral home of David
Playfair, a busy arable farmer whose hobby is carriage-driving. (B&amp;B,
#30; dinner #18).
Research undertaken by the Farm Holiday Bureau has established that
94% of its members welcome children and 62% will baby-sit. Weekend
breaks on a farm, in the early months of the year, are a popular choice
for families with children. Depending on the breed of sheep and the
local climate, lambs are born from January to April. Little girls and
boys who dream of bottle-feeding a rejected lamb should know that by the
Easter holidays, lambs on some farms will be quite big and well able to
fend for themselves. It's best to enquire beforehand.
Boys and girls whose dream of owning a pony has come true might be
interested to know that more than 100 members of the Farm Holiday Bureau
have indicated their willingness to provide bed and breakfast for
ponies, nosebags, straw, grazing -- every comfort.
Larger arable farms with potentially dangerous machinery are busy
places where small children would have to be carefully watched. Perhaps
more suitable for youngsters is the smallholding where land is
cultivated -- usually organically -- by enthusiasts for country living
and rural conservation, where the animals are almost pets and generally
include donkeys, goats or Vietnamese pot-bellied pigs.
Laugh if you like. Scottish farmers whose ancestors did back-breaking
work on their land for centuries are entitled to laugh at what some of
them consider to be playing at farming -- but children love it.
Staying on a croft also offers children the delights of collecting
newly laid eggs and teenagers the fun of helping to bring in the peats.
Guide prices for 1995 are #14 B&amp;B on a small croft in Ross-shire where
the crofter is building up a herd of pedigree Highland cattle while
working as a coach driver. These days full-time crofting doesn't provide
an acceptable standard of living for a family. Bed and breakfast, with
ensuite bathroom costs #18 on a seven-acre croft near Fort William.
Guests who enjoy hillwalking can benefit from the advice of the crofter
who is also a volunteer member of the Glencoe Mountain Rescue Team.
Bed and breakfast on crofts was pioneered in Shetland. In these
prosperous islands, most crofthouses have every modern comfort. Many
have smart extensions and some have been rebuilt as modern bungalows.
The 1995 Holiday Accommodation brochure produced by Shetland Islands
Tourism also lists crofthouses and barns available for self-caterers,
for example, if you really want to get away from it all, take a cottage
on Foula, stone-built and traditional, with its own dry-stane dike and
trout burn.

<TEXT>
THE newly appointed head of Fondiaria, Italy's second largest
insurance firm, committed suicide today by jumping from the 21st floor
of a skyscraper where he lived, police said.
Ludwig Von Hackwitz, 48, took over at the top of the troubled
insurance firm last month with a mandate to restructure the loss-making
company.
Fondiaria SpA, the insurance arm of Italian holding company Ferruzzi
Finanziaria, last month announced losses of 445.9 billion lire ($273m)
for 1993.
Ferruzzi took over direct control of the company in April and analysts
expected the move would herald a thorough overhaul of the debt-laden
insurer.
Shares in the insurance group were suspended late Friday on the Milan
bourse by stock exchange authorities pending a company announcement,
with many dealers expecting the three firms which make up the group to
be merged into a single unit.
Meetings were due to be held at company offices in Florence tomorrow
to decide on a restructuring programme and staff cuts.
This is the second suicide to shake the troubled agro-industrial
Ferruzzi group in two years.
In July 1993, the then head of Ferruzzi, Raul Gardini, shot himself as
he was about to be arrested on suspicion of corruption.--Reuter.

Anne Cowan makes tracks on a southbound train from Seattle to San
Francisco
IT was the most haunting thing I ever saw. One minute we were rolling
along on the Amtrak train, with flat, rich farmland on either side, when
suddenly the sun was blotted out and a forest of battleship-grey masts
rose chillingly from the mist. Abandoned warships floated on a sea of
fog.
''The Mothball Fleet,'' said the man opposite, casually, ''from the
Second World War.'' He and his wife had boarded the train at Sacramento,
bound for a day's shopping in San Francisco. Like blase commuters the
world over, they hardly glanced at the window. Next to me, the highly
varnished septuagenarian from Florida was more interested in finishing
her ''lite'' fare before leaving the train at Martinez, for a trip to
Yosemite. Meanwhile, my pancakes and maple syrup had to wait while I
gazed at the dream-like hulks. I had not realised that San Francisco Bay
came so far inland. And all this was in the middle of the countryside
before breakfast.
Our train, the Coast Starlight, runs between Seattle, near the
Canadian border, and Los Angeles. We were taking the 23-hour stage of
the route from Seattle to San Francisco. We boarded at 9.30am, and
arrived in Oakland at 8.30 the next morning. Travelling to San
Francisco, you leave the train at Oakland and get a shuttle bus across
the Bay Bridge to the city. Be sure to ticket your luggage right through
to SF.
We reserved a deluxe compartment with toilet and shower. Some of the
other private accommodation is a bit cramped. There are also airline
seats. Incidentally, any passenger who smokes ''will be put off at the
next station without compensation''. At dawn I had been the only
non-smoker out for a walk on the platform at Sacramento.
For my husband it was not ghostly ships, but the spectacular volcanoes
of Washington and Oregon which were the most memorable. Even in Seattle,
on the switchback taxi ride from our hotel to King Street Station, we
reached a crest and Mount Rainier was before us -- it was a stunning
sight. Once aboard the train we settled-in. Seven minutes into the trip
we passed Boeing Field, home of Seattle's main employer, then Seatac
Airport. We went along to the viewing car, with its panoramic windows
and swivel-chairs facing out. A fellow-passenger was singing and playing
guitar blues.
After an hour we were still looking out at scenic Puget Sound which,
like San Francisco Bay, is on the grand scale. Soon came rural farmland
where the railroad tracks go through small towns, past backyards and
across level-crossings. By dinner time we were climbing the Cascades
with their conifers, evergreens and gorges. The sun set behind a jagged
skyline. And so to bunk.
This holiday of 18 days depended on an ''open jaw'' ticket. We flew
into Seattle for three nights there, 10 nights in San Francisco and
three in Sausalito. When we had landed at Seatac Airport on Independence
Day, instead of searing heat we met warm air and the smell of pines.
Seattle is a laid-back city famed for coffee and bookshops. It is hilly,
interlaced with water and surrounded by mountains. It has a distinct
North Western feel to it, from Indian influences to walrus heads carved
on the Arctic Building.
The first morning we walked down to the waterfront and decided to
choose a ferry trip at random. It was a beautiful 37-minute sail, to
Bainbridge Island. There we stepped on to a small bus waiting near the
pier. It took us through the pines and past well-off commuters' retreats
to Poulsbo. This Scandinavian community is a gem. It has a seaside
green, views of the 8000ft high mountain of the Olympic Peninsula, a
delightful main street, Viking helmets in the drugstore and relaxed
charm.
Another day we took the bus to suburban Ballard and walked to the
Chittenden Locks. The water was alive with salmon. Down on the fish
ladder the life-force ran raw as they battled upstream against seemingly
overpowering currents.
Into each life a little rain must fall, but Seattle gets nine months
of it a year -- hence the bookshops and coffee shops, they say. It
rarely rains, however, in July and August. The only jarring note was the
two-level highway along the waterfront, but they have the lively,
working Pike Place Market down there to compensate. Three days is not
enough for Seattle, so near to the Olympic peninsula and only four hours
by ferry from Vancouver.
So how much does it cost to put together your own independent trip,
flights, good hotels, Amtrak tickets, a Sonoma wine tour, food and
spending money? Think of paying for, a new kitchen, a conservatory with
all the trimmings or any other expensive goods. It was my husband's 50th
birthday, so we liberated TESSA, the money for a rainy day, and spent it
on some sunny ones. It was worth every last cent.

From BRIAN WILLIAMS, Tokyo, Sunday
BARBED wire went up for the first time today around one of Japan's
most traditional events, the summer sumo wrestling tournament,
symbolising the plight of a nation again under siege after a new poison
gas attack.
With no sign of breakthroughs in either the latest cyanide gas attack
or three other mystery gas attacks over the past seven weeks, Japanese
authorities could only draw a tighter and tighter security blanket over
the capital.
Rubbish bins were taped shut at airports and railway stations and
60,000 police were on duty in Tokyo alone as residents poured back into
the city at the end of a five-day holiday period known as ''Golden
Week.''
The security precautions went into force within hours of Friday
night's foiled cyanide gas attack at Shinjuku, Tokyo's busiest station,
where chemical experts estimate up to 20,000 people could have died,
In the attack, two plastic bags full of chemicals needed to make
lethal cyanide gas were found in a men's toilet.
One bag contained two litres of sodium cyanide powder, which was
already on fire, and beside it was a bag containing 1.5 litres of
diluted sulphuric acid.
Cyanide gas would have been set off if the flames had fully spread to
the other bag and fumes from the chemicals had mixed.
Police said flames were already licking at the second bag when a man
who went to use the toilet alerted subway guards who, luckily, were just
passing the facility at the time.
The four subway guards who dashed into the toilet and doused the bags
with water were overcome by fumes already set off and briefly treated in
hospital.
Police believe the Shinjuku attack was carefully planned and only luck
and a matter of seconds averted a disaster which would have dwarfed the
12 killed and 5000 injured when sarin nerve gas was released into
Tokyo's subway system on March 20.
They said the bags were planted between cleaners routinely visiting
the facility and checks of the toilet made by security guards four times
a day.
The timing of the attack -- 7.30pm -- coincided with a period when the
station is always jammed with shoppers and on this day also when
holidaymakers start returning to the city from Golden Week.
Police said the incident was attempted murder and possibly connected
with March's sarin nerve gas attack which has in turn been linked to the
doomsday cult Aum Shinri Kyo (Supreme Truth).
In a sign that investigations were still focused on the sect, police
at the weekend raided more cult facilities and arrested more of its
followers.
They said all the ingredients to make sarin and cyanide gases have
been found in the raids.
The sect denies involvement and has protested its innocence in
broadcasts from cars touring the city.--Reuter.

From BERNARD EDINGER, Paris, Sunday
TENS, perhaps hundreds, of thousands of people thronged the Champs
Elysees avenue in the heart of Paris tonight to fete Gaullist Jacques
Chirac's presidential election victory over Socialist Lionel Jospin.
Chirac backers raced up and down the tree-lined thoroughfare in their
cars, honking their horns, waving tricolour French flags and chanting
''On a gagne'' (We won). A few splashed in the fountains on the wide
Place de la Concorde on a balmy summer-like evening.
Most of those present, including many enchanted foreign tourists,
appeared drawn more by the festive atmosphere than by political
conviction.
Bemused Japanese visitors walked about with wide smiles on their
faces, some young Spaniards danced in the middle of the avenue waving
their own gold-and-red national flag. A dozen Israeli men belted out a
Hebrew song about peace being near.
The celebrations were ornaised by ''Students for Chirac'', a
little-known youth group which handed out thousands of stickers to
passing motorists.
Their aim was to match the festivities which marked outgoing president
Francois Mitterrand's first election victory in 1981 when tens of
thousands of people danced in the Bastille square.
Those doing most of the shouting on the Champs Elysees, or weaving
between cars on expensive roller-blades, appeared however to be
''Johnny-come-latelies'' to the Gaullist cause.
Their fashionable Bermuda shorts and expensive, American baseball caps
were giveaway signs that they hailed from the nearby trendy 16th
arrondissement of the capital, parish of France's rich.
Shapely young women in form-hugging designer T-shirts sitting atop
expensive cars flashed big smiles for the cameras.
Outside Chirac's campaign headquarters, ecstatic crowds cheered the
former Paris mayor when he appeared on a balcony flanked by top aides
including Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, tipped as the next prime
minister.
Chirac, 62, had driven there in a motorcade from City Hall, his car
window wide open to the cheers of his supporters, pursued by a horde of
reporters on motorcycles.
Earlier at City Hall, about 1000 guests had cheered ''Chirac!
Chirac!'' as the mayor's face appeared on television screens at 8pm when
his victory was announced.
Sensing a Chirac victory, aides had already started serving champagne
but, once the news was official, people jumped up and down hugging each
other and shouting ''We won! We won!'' Then they broke into into singing
the French national anthem.
At Jospin's campaign headquarters, the sting of defeat was quickly
replaced by celebrations looking to a Socialist revival.
''Jospin, don't stop now,'' the crowd cheered as he plunged into a
crowd of supporters. Far from looking a broken man, Jospin smiled after
admitting defeat and congratulating Chirac in a brief speech.
Chirac's victory ended a 14-year Socialist grip on the office, and
immediately declared war on unemployment.
The Gaullist candidate claimed victory in a statement to ecstatic
supporters. Pledging to be ''the president of all the French people'',
he declared: ''Our main battle has a name: the fight against
unemployment. The conventional remedies have failed. We need a new
approach and new methods.''
Earlier, Jospin, 57, went on television to concede defeat and
congratulate the winner, saying his own strong score was a basis for a
renewal of the Left.
The result was a vindication for Chirac, who failed in two previous
presidential bids, losing to Mitterrand in 1981 and 1988.
Like Mitterrand, he won at the third attempt after many of his own
followers had written him off as a loser.
Twice prime minister in 1974--76 and 1986--88, Chirac only narrowly
beat fellow Gaullist Edouard Balladur, the man he sent to the prime
minister's office in 1993, for second place in the first round of voting
two weeks ago.
Chirac is expected to appoint his top cabinet supporter, Foreign
Minister Alain Juppe, 49, as prime minister after taking over in the
next 10 days. The ailing 78-year-old Mitterrand congratulated him in a
telegram wishing him success.
The outgoing president and his successor will stand side by side with
dozens of foreign heads of state and government at ceremonies at the Arc
de Triomphe tomorrow marking the 50th anniversary of the end of the
Second World War in Europe.
Juppe's first comment was: ''We must now get started on change,
profound change but in a calm, determined manner.''
Diagnosing a ''social fracture'', Chirac pledged during his campaign
to give top priority to fighting near-record 12.3% unemployment, as well
as homelessness.
In his acceptance speech, he said all government policies would be
chosen for their impact on employment.
''This also will be the case for the fight against social exclusion.
And when we have gotten rid of these scourges, France will again find
itself the land of liberty, fraternity, equality of opportunity, the
land of solidarity,'' he declared.
French financial markets, open specially tonight for a brief
post-election session, saluted Chirac's victory.
The stock market index rose nearly 2.5%, government bonds were up and
the franc gained 2.5 centimes against the deutschemark to stand at
3.5450 per mark.
Jospin's honourable defeat made the former Socialist party leader and
education minister, a total outsider when he joined the race in January,
the natural leader of a resuscitated Left.
''I felt a profound movement of renewal building up around my
candidacy and my proposals. It was not enough for victory, but it will
not end here because it carries hopes,'' Jospin said.
Chirac has said he sees no reason to dissolve the National Assembly,
where the centre-right has a four-fifths majority.
Among men set for senior cabinet roles are free-marketeer Alain
Madelin, expected to be economics and finance minister, centrist
Education Minister Francois Bayrou, tipped for the foreign ministry, and
Culture Minister Jacques Toubon.
With 31 million out of France's nearly 40 million registered voters
counted, Chirac was ahead with 12,256,789 votes or 51.8%, while Jospin
had 11,370,000 votes or 48.1%.
Exit polls showed a majority of the 4.6 million people who chose
extreme-rightist Jean-Marie Le Pen on the first round, 15% of the
electorate, voted for Chirac this time. One quarter backed Jospin and
the remainder abstained or cast blank ballots as Le Pen did.--Reuter.

Dallas, Sunday
THE death toll in one of Dallas' worst storms ever rose to 16 today
with four people still missing after flash floods raged through the city
on Friday, officials said.
Most of the victims including five members of one family drowned when
flash floods triggered by torrential rains engulfed their vehicles.
Damage estimates climbed to morte than $400m as area residents sought to
repair broken windows, dented cars and collapsed buildings.
Hail, which was as large as grapefruit in some areas, injured over 100
people. Winds gusted over 70 mph, and area residents lost power and
phone lines as the storm hit.
Dallas Fire Department spokeswoman Nanci Williams said today 14 people
were confirmed dead within the city itself. They included two women who
were crushed when the roof of a clothing company collapsed and a
70-year-old woman who died when her house caught fire after being struck
by lightning.
Two more people were killed near Dallas including a teacher who was
swept away by floodwaters and a teenager who was struck by lightning.
* An earthquake measuring 5.0 on the Richter scale rocked the Palm
Springs area of southern California this morning but there were no
reports of damage or injuries, officials said.--Reuter.

From PETER SMERDON, Sendafa, Ethiopia, Sunday
MILLIONS of Ethiopians voted in their first multi-party general
election today, with an opposition boycott almost certainly ensuring a
landslide victory for their former guerrilla ruling coalition.
The stream of voters swelled throughout the day from a first trickle
strolling up the capital's mist-shrouded hills at dawn past joggers and
churchgoers. Officials reported no violence.
In rural areas illiterate voters came by foot, car and on horseback to
polling stations flying the green, yellow and red national flag and
guarded by police to tick off their choices.
The Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) led by
President Meles Zenawi ended four years of transitional rule with the
polls to divide one of Africa's oldest empires into a federation of nine
new ethnic states.
Most opposition parties boycotted the election, making an EPRDF
victory almost inevitable across Ethiopia, twice the land size of France
with 55 million people from 80 ethnic groups.
Western diplomats among more than 280 foreign monitors said polling in
Addis Ababa appeared to go smoothly and noted the EPRDF had even greater
support in most of the countryside.
Officials at three randomly-chosen centres some 25 miles north of the
capital reported turnouts of between 60 and 75% of registered voters
hours before most polls closed.
''It's possible 90% will have voted if there were no problems,'' said
Samson Gethaun, spokesman for the National Electoral Board, adding
results would be announced in two weeks.
Gethaun said voting was ''fine'' compared to the size of the operation
with a total of 49,000 polling stations but ''procedural
technicalities'' such as ballot papers not being first signed by
officials had surfaced throughout the day.
Voting was postponed in three of the nine new regions until May 27
because of what officials said were logistical problems.
The electoral board said 2832 candidates including more than 900
independents stood for a 548-seat national parliament and regional
councils. The EPRDF took 89% of the seats in a constituent assembly
which was elected in June last year.
Boycotting opposition parties dismissed today's election as a farce to
put the EPRDF, dominated by the northern Tigrayan minority, back in
power.
The EPRDF seized power in 1991, ending 17 years of brutal, centralised
Marxist rule under dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam.
Former guerrilla Meles, who as president and EPRDF head celebrates his
42nd birthday tomorrow, is bound to become the federation's new prime
minister with strong executive powers.
In the village of Sendafa in the lush farming heartland of the Oromo,
Ethiopia's largest ethnic group, trader Seyoum Wodajo, 65, said he voted
for the Oromo People's Democratic Organisation (Opdo), a partner in the
EPRDF since 1990.--Reuter.

From ISSAM HAMZA Damascus, Sunday
SYRIA today rejected Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's latest
call for secret talks to break the deadlock in their peace negotiations.
''This call contradicts the formula on which the Arab-Israeli peace
conference was based. It is totally rejected and denounced,'' the
government daily Tishreen said.
''It seems that Israel is still betting on making partial settlements
and separate deals that is why Yitzhak Rabin repeats his call for secret
talks,'' it said.
Rabin is in Washington to discuss the Syrian-Israeli peace process
which has made little headway since talks began in 1991.
On the eve of his US visit, Rabin told Israel Television that he
wanted secret, intimate peace talks with Syria.
With Jordan's King Hussein at his side for the interview recorded in
Jordan, Rabin urged the Syrians to follow the example of Jordan, the
Palestinians and Egypt who met Israelis secretly before signing peace
deals.
The Israeli-Syrian talks are stalled over the scope and timing of an
Israeli withdrawal from the Golan heights, captured by Israel in 1967,
security arrangements, and future ties.
Rabin said in press remarks last week that Syria had agreed to
Israel's key demand for establishment of diplomatic ties and open
borders but said gaps remained on other issues.
''Syria which warned about the . . . Israeli intentions will never
accept anything less than full withdrawal from the Golan and the rest of
the Arab lands especially Jerusalem,'' Tishreen said.
''Syria has nothing to hide. Its position is clear and sincere. It
wants just and comprehensive peace far from darkness, secrecy and
separate deals,'' it said.
Syria has strongly criticised the PLO and Jordan for signing separate
peace deals with Israel, saying they harmed Arab interests.
Meanwhile, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said today that
Israel would not reverse its controversial decision to confiscate land
in East Jerusalem because the Jewish state needed to build housing for
its citizens.

Buenos Aires, Sunday
ARGENTINE President Carlos Menem looks set to score a first-round
victory in elections on May 14 but his nearest rival continues to pick
up support, according an opinion poll published today.
The Peronist Party's Menem would win 45.4% of the vote, according to
the survey to May 5 by pollsters Julio Aurelio published in the La
Nacion newspaper.
Jose Octavio Bordon of the centre-left Frepaso alliance would win
32.3%, up four percentage points since April 21, the date of the last
Julio Aurelio poll.
Support for Menem has fallen by one percentage point in the same
period.
But while Bordon is narrowing the gap, these results if repeated next
Sunday would leave Menem automatically declared winner, after meeting
both conditions to avoid a second round.
Under Argentine rules, the winning candidate must either win at least
45% of the vote or at least 40% plus a 10-point lead over the runner-up.
Taking the poll's margin of error into account, the survey indicated
that Menem would win a maximum 47.1% and a minimum 43.7%. Bordon's range
would be from a minimum 30.7% to at most 33.9%.
Also rans in the poll were Horacio Massaccessi, of the traditionally
powerful Radical Party, with 17.1% of support, and a far-right former
army officer, Aldo Rico, with 3%.
The poll, which apparently included a projection of the likely
behaviour of undecided voters, was based on replies from 3500
respondents in major centres throughout the country.
Only one opinion poll, released on May 2, has shown Menem without the
10-point lead he needs for instant re-election. But the next day two
surveys gave Menem 46% of the vote.
* A man who fired three shots in the air near President Menem was
declared mentally unfit to be charged by a judge, who ordered his
confinement in a psychiatric clinic today.
Jose Luis Paz, a 32-year-old ice cream salesman, has a history of
mental illness, the private DyN newsagency reported.
Paz was detained yesterday after firing three shots into the air with
a revolver while Menem was being driven nearby in an election campaign
visit to the city of Rosario.--Reuter.

Colombo, Sunday
MUSLIMS have taken refuge in mosques in an east Sri Lankan village
following a Tamil rebel attack on an army sentry post and retaliation by
soldiers which left at least nine troops and civilians dead, members of
parliament said today.
The army said five soldiers were killed when Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam rebels (LTTE) attacked an observation post on the outskirts
of Arapath Nagar, near Pulmoddai, about 25 miles north of Trincomalee.
Four civilians were killed in the fighting last night and five others
injured, the army said. Three or four rebels were known to have been
shot.
Najeeb Majeed, a member of parliament for the Trincomalee district,
said the army had shelled the 100% Muslim village and opened fire on
innocent civilians.

Bonn, Sunday
THE leader of Russia's rebel region of Chechnya accused Russian troops
in an interview published today of massacring Chechen women and children
and plundering their villages.
President Dudayev told the German weekly Welt am Sonntag that he was
ready for unconditional talks with the Russian leadership trying to put
down his separatist movement.
Part of the reason, he said, was concern for the civilian population.
''The occupation troops are systematically burning down villages and
settlements and shooting women, children and old people,'' he was quoted
as saying.
''Then the plundering starts. The number of civilian victims goes into
the hundreds of thousands,'' he said.
Dudayev left unclear how his fighters would act on May 9, the day when
more than 50 world leaders will attend celebrations in Moscow marking
the 50th anniversary of Russia's victory over Germany in the Second
World War.
''We know how to honour the victims of the peoples of the former
Soviet Union, for hundreds of Chechens were murdered or fell at the
front,'' he said, adding that many north Caucasians had been sent by
Moscow to serve as ''cannon fodder'' in the Second World War.
The Chechnya fighting has already cast a shadow over the Moscow
celebrations. Some visiting leaders are boycotting all military parades
while others will attend only a veterans' march-past to be held in Red
Square.
Russian military commanders say Chechens plan a major attack on Grozny
on May 9, but the Chechens say they have ordered military action to be
reduced to a minimum on Tuesday.
President Boris Yeltsin, anxious that fighting should not mar the
Moscow celebrations, had declared a two-week unilateral ceasefire from
April 28, but it was rejected by the rebels and has been repeatedly
violated by both sides.
Dudayev said 9000 Chechen fighters were up against a Russian force
which he estimated at 60,000 men.--Reuter.

Fashion is smiling again -- thanks largely to the efforts of the
master of wearable wit, Christian Lacroix. Francesca Fearon reports
CHRISTIAN Lacroix has put the fun back into fashion. He did it in the
eighties when he burst forth on to the fashion scene at the helm of the
old French couture house, Patou. He created a pretty puff ball of a
skirt, called the pouf, and brought colour back into the fashion
vocabulary after dreary minimalist-dominated years. He continued to
inject his collections with wit and vivacity when he opened his own
couture house eight years ago under the aegis of French luxury goods
empire LVMH. His passion for exuberant patterns and hot sensual colours
richly blended into exquisite couture collections, and electrified the
chic, lacquered ladies who warmed to his style.
Now Lacroix is pepping up fashion again with a collection called
Bazar. It is a special complementary range that exists alongside his
couture and ready-to-wear lines, much like Armani's Emporio collection.
It has a looser, free wheeling image yet echoes Lacroix's eclectic taste
for colour, pattern and silhouette, which is why his couture customers
are sometimes seen mixing elements of all three collections together at
once. It is a practice that appeals to the designer, who is far from
precious about his work. ''I don't want a woman to be Lacroix-clad from
head to toe: I would prefer her to appropriate my style, mixing it with
things from the flea market or inexpensive clothes,'' he explains.
Bazar, now in its second season, has a flamboyant way of combining
sportswear and dressy looks. Lacroix is a cultural magpie, inspired by
vibrant memories of the gypsies, the bullfight and the carnival of his
childhood in Arles and street fashion -- he is a serious Anglophile with
an enthusiasm for London street markets and the eccentricities that are
so unlike the ''pretentions'' of Paris. ''I adore this way of mixing
everything without prejudice, it's very inspirational,'' he says. The
funky street element gives a fresh modern twist to the rich cultural
patchwork that characterises his oeuvre.
The collection helped him to channel his creative energy in another
direction. ''My fear is to be stuck to a certain image; I don't want to
be reduced to a southern character using bullfighters, shocking pink and
lime green forever, because fashion and lifestyles are evolving so
quickly that all the old recipes will be obsolete,'' worries Lacroix.
''Each time I bring out a new line gives me a chance to breathe new
oxygen.''
However, he hasn't abandoned his flair for working strong prints with
bold colours. The spring collection, currently available at Moon and
Fraser's in Glasgow and Corniche in Edinburgh, mixes vibrant plaid
weaves and newsprint jackets with chambray shirts, and searing striped
tailoring with flounced gypsy dresses. The shapely body-hugging fit of
his couture is echoed in orange denim, teamed with photo-print stretch
cotton jeans.
The searing colours have had an enthusiastic reception in Scotland,
according to Moon and Corniche. ''I think people are ready for it, it's
fun and it's strong,'' says Nina Grant at Corniche. At Moon, it is
Bazar's funkiness and attention to detail that impresses. This is the
first Lacroix line to be available in Scotland and was a sell-out last
season.

THE talking will have to end some time, leaving the players of
Aberdeen and Dundee United to get on with perhaps the most nerve-racking
game of football they have tackled in their careers.
Anyway, nothing much can be left to say about a match which could
decide the fate of each or both of the north-east's most successful
teams of recent times.
However it turns out, the fact that they kicked off in bottom and
second bottom place respectively in the premier division is more
eloquent than all the lengthy analysis that has gone on.
Something has to give, and as a consequence the chances are that the
game will not be a pretty sight.
Aberdeen will bring back one of their most popular players, goalkeeper
Theo Snelders, for his first game since he broke a foot six weeks ago
and that in itself will give the side a boost, not that Michael Watt has
let them down in the interim.
''He has been a major player for this club and seen and done it all,''
said caretaker manager Roy Aitken. ''He knows what it will take and,
having spoken to him, he is ready for the challenge.
''This is no reflection on Watt, who has probably changed a lot of
people's opinions about him with his recent performances.
''The pupil has done very well but now it is the time for the master
to come back.''
Aitken admits that he has never been invovled in a situation quite
like this one but adds: ''Football is all about big occasions, whether
you are fighting for trophies or your life.
''As far as I'm concerned, I don't regard this as pressure but rather
as another challenge to be met head on. I have been looking forward to
the game for the past week -- as have the players and everyone at the
club.''
Aitken bases his optimism on the fact that the team has responded well
after being virtually written off a few weeks ago.
''We have the chance to take another step nearer safety by beating
Dundee United. If we play with the same consistency and flair as in
recent weeks, I have no doubt whatsoever we will do well.''
The Pittodrie manager believes the sell-out crowd can be a major
factor in his team's peformance. He has been thrilled with the passion
and backing the fans have given the side in the past few weeks and
anticpates it once again. ''It could make all the difference,'' he said.
Defender John Inglis has recovered from a hamstring injury and is
added to the squad but midfielder Ray McKinnon is out because of a knee
injury.
United may be marginally in front of their rivals in the table but
their recent form has been the poorer, which is why their manager, Billy
Kirkwood, has asked his players to prove that they have the courage for
the toughest match of the year.
Kirkwood has seen his team win only once in five games since he took
charge but is convinced that they have the mettle for the task.
''It is not even a year since Dundee United won the Scottish Cup,'' he
said. ''They didn't do that without showing their ability to battle
under difficult circumstances.
''They did it twice before they beat Aberdeen in the semi-final and
they repeated it against the odds when they beat Rangers in the final.
These games proved they have the bottle and all we are asking is that
they produce the same again at Pittodrie.''
Kirkwood sees no great worry over the superiority in numbers of Dons
fans. ''In the part, Dundee United have enjoyed some of the greatest
moments by winning under similar circumstances.''
The United manager believes the one ingredient missing in his few
weeks in charge has been the ability to score goals.
Consequently, he is contemplating bringing back Craig Brewster if he
feels he is fully recovered from injury.
Sergio, the Brazilian striker, also is a candidate but United are
without four senior players, all because of suspension, Dave Bowman,
Billy McKinlay, Gordan Petric, and Brian Welsh.

IT MAY be a bit early for Rangers' annual summer surprise but the
signs were strong yesterday that it will feature England's best-known
footballer, Paul Gascoigne, who is to be permitted to leave Italy's
Lazio at the end of the season.
There was nothing concrete to be gleaned from Ibrox about the
speculation surrounding the former Newcastle and Spurs midfield man but
the indications are that talks have taken place between the clubs with a
view to bringing the international star to Scotland.
The protests of assistant manager Archie Knox were maybe just a little
too much as he talked his way around the reports and rumours, and it is
understood that manager Walter Smith was still in London yesterday on
transfer business.
Lazio chairman Dino Zoff and their major shareholder, Sergio
Cragnotti, flew to London this week to discuss the possibility of
Gascoigne moving on. There are a few English clubs interested,
particularly Queen's Park Rangers, but the Glasgow club is understood to
be well placed in the race for any deal, which could be around #4m.
The 28-year-old considered by many to be the most exciting English
player since Glenn Hoddle has not had much luck in his Italian sojourn.
He joined Lazio three years ago but has been so hampered by injury that
he has played in only 44 games.
Last month he returned to action a year after another broken leg but
it seems clear that Zoff, who wants to release one of his foreign
players to make way for a major incoming transfer, has selected the
Geordie to go.
Rangers chairman David Murray has promised another round of big
signings this summer, although the club would be hard pushed to improve
upon the impact made by last June's star turn, Brian Laudrup.
Assistant manager Knox, bombarded by questions on the subject, would
say only: ''We are not speculating that we are in for Gascoigne or any
other player.''
Life around Gascoigne is never dull. Newcastle director Stan Seymour
was reported to have said: ''He's like George Best without brains.''
What no-one can dispute is that he is a brilliant footballer.
Milestones in a chequered career have been as follows:
1985.
June: Joined Newcastle United as an apprentice.
1988:
June: Transferred to Tottenham for #2m.
1990:
July: Breaks down in tears after being booked in World Cup semi-final
in Italy, a booking that ruled him out of a possible final appearance.
1991:
May: Carried off in FA Cup final against Nottingham Forest at Wembley
with badly injured right knee.
September: Second operation on right knee following an incident at
Newcastle night club. He fell after being punched in apparently
unprovoked attack.
1992.
May: Signs for Lazio in #5.5m deal.
September: Plays first official game since 1991 FA Cup final in a
friendly against Tottenham and scores in 3-0 win.
Later that month he makes his full Italian League debut against Genoa.
October: Returned to the English squad for the first time in 20 months
for the World Cup qualifier against Norway at Wembley.
Has to apologise to a Norwegian television company. He was intercepted
by a visiting television crew after training and was asked if he had a
message for the people of Norway. Without realising the cameras were
rolling, he responded: ''Yes -- **** off!''
1993.
January: Fined #9000 by Lazio for burping into a television microphone
when asked to comment on his being left out of the side.
1994.
April:
Fractured the tibia and fibula of right leg at Lazio's training
ground.
July: Admitted, to an English newspaper, assaults on girlfriend Sheryl
Kyle.
1995.
April: Returns to the Lazio side after a year out because of the leg
break.
June: ?

By DEREK DOUGLAS, in Spain
SCOTLAND need to win with style tonight against Spain if the Rugby
World Cup adventure, for which they embark in 10 days' time, is to
commence with a morale-boosting flourish.
The eight-day RWC warm-up tour in Spain has been an undoubted success
in terms of honing fitness and building team spirit, but Tuesday night's
opening game against a Madrid County Select -- although a win --
indicated that the side lacked the mental toughness to put inferior
opposition to the sword in the manner of, say, the All Blacks.
The Bourges lock Damian Cronin, about whom there was some concern over
a strained left hamstring, has been passed fit to play tonight.
The news of his recovery comes as a huge relief to the management on
account of the fact that he has had no rugby since being sidelined by a
serious elbow injury in the game against France on February 18.
Time was running out for Cronin by virtue of the fact that manager
Duncan Paterson had declared before the squad left for Spain that every
member of the RWC party would have to play or they would not be on the
plane to Pretoria.
Yesterday, as the Scots trained at the picturesque Madrid University
ground, where tonight's game takes place, Paterson said that Cronin had
done all that had been asked of him. The hamstring was still tight but
he would start tonight's game.
''I've said to him that he must not be stupid about it and that if he
feels discomfort then we might bring him off. He might not complete the
game but if that happens then I would not panic.''
Scotland have played Spain on a couple of occasions, winning 39-17 at
Barcelona in 1986 and 25-7 at Murrayfield on the eve of the 1987 World
Cup.
A few of those who played on Tuesday rose above the general
mediocrity. Chief among them was Craig Joiner, the 21-year-old scoring a
hat trick of tries and receiving the man of the match award.
He won praise from the management after the game, Paterson declaring
that, like fellow winger Ken Logan, there was always a buzz of
anticipation whenever he had ball in hand.
Logan and Joiner -- known to all and sundry as Jackie -- are fast
becoming the Glimmer Twins of Scottish rugby. They resume their wing
partnership against Spain tonight, Logan having been on bench duty on
Tuesday.
Logan said: ''I had played nine games for Scotland before I felt
comfortable. I even got to the stage of wondering whether I was good
enough to be doing this, but the encouraging thing is that the selectors
stuck with me.''
Joiner added: ''There is such a huge gap between the club game and
international rugby and, really, I'm still bridging that gap but by the
time the World Cup comes around I'm sure that I'll be closer to being
the finished article.'' Team:
Scotland -- A G Hastings (Watsonians); C A Joiner (Melrose), A G
Stanger (Hawick), A G Shiel (Melrose), K M Logan (Stirling County); C M
Chalmers, B W Redpath (both Melrose); D I W Hilton (Bath), K D McKenzie
(Stirling County), P H Wright (Boroughmuir), D F Cronin (Bourges), G W
Weir (Melrose), R I Wainwright (West Hartlepool), E W Peters (Bath), I R
Morrison (London Scottish). Replacements -- S Hastings (Watsonians), I C
Jardine (Stirling County), D W Patterson (West Hartlepool), S J Campbell
(Dundee HS FP), A P Burnell (London Scottish), M Scott (Orrell).

ENGLAND captain Will Carling has apologised for calling rugby union
chiefs ''57 old farts''. Carling and international team-mate Rob Andrew
criticised the sport's ruling body and its reluctance to embrace
professionalism on Channel 4's ''Fair Game'' programme.
He said last night: ''The comment was not made to camera and was not a
quote I would like to be remembered for. I hope the members of the
committee will not take offence. But, if I have offended any members, I
apologise unreservedly.''

HOCKEY
GRAHAM Joyce inspired Scotland to a winning finale in the European
under-21 men's hockey championship qualifying tournament yesterday at
Genoa, Italy, by scoring both goals in the 2-1 victory over Portugal.
This victory assured Scotland of third place behind England, who
clinched first place by beating Italy 2-0 in their final match.
Danny Hall and Alistair Boyse scored the goals which gave England
their fifth successive victory in the six-nation event and qualification
for next year's finals in Denmark.
Scottish coach Derek Forsyth, while despondent at not securing a place
in the final, will be happy on reflection with the showing of his
depleted side -- nine members of the training squad were unavailable for
selection, in what were demanding circumstances.
Forsyth's opposite number with the women's side, Mike Gilbert, would
have been more than happy if his side had achieved a similar ranking in
their tournament in Poznan, Poland.
Instead, Scotland will play Finland this morning to decide seventh
place after having conceded three simple goals at penalty corners in
their first classification match. Results:
MEN -- Switzerland 1, Gibraltar 2; Scotland 2, Portugal 1; Italy 0,
England 2.

ATLANTA CLASSIC
JOHN Daly, golf's great enigma, produced a typically spectacular
performance to earn the lead after the second round at the US$1.3m
BellSouth Atlanta Classic in Georgia yesterday.
Defending champion Daly continued his love affair with Atlanta Country
Club to plunder eight birdies in a five-under-par 67 on a delightful,
breezy afternoon.
''I know exactly what I'm going to hit off every tee here and that
helps me a lot,'' said Daly, whose 10-under halfway total of 134 gives
him a one-shot cushion over fellow Americans Michael Bradley (65) and
Jim Gallagher (70).
Former British Walker Cup player Stephen Keppler, now a club pro in
Atlanta, bogeyed the final hole to join a group two strokes behind after
a 69.
''It's great to come back here and be leading after two days. It's
awesome to be in this situation again. It's been quite a while,'' Daly
continued.
''All the hard work I've been doing is starting to pay off.''
His huge drives attract the most attention, but his iron shots and
putting were more responsible for his low score yesterday. ''I missed
only two greens and I'm putting really solid, making a lot of
10-footers,'' he explained.
Daly, who emerged from obscurity to win the 1991 US PGA Championship,
has not won since his one-stroke victory here last year, and he missed
the cut in Houston last week, although he was not unhappy with his game.
Swede Jesper Parnevik and Ulsterman David Feherty missed the cut.
Leading scores (US unless stated):
134 -- John Daly 67, 67.
135 -- Michael Bradley 70, 65; Jim Gallagher 65, 70.
136 -- Lennie Clements 70, 66; Davis Love 67, 69; Mark Calcavecchia
67, 69; Stephen Keppler (England) 67, 69.
137 -- John Wilson 69, 68.
138 -- Guy Boros 71, 67; Neal Lancaster 68, 70; Mark Brooks 67, 71;
Brandel Chamblee 68, 70; Bill Porter 65, 73.
Other Europeans: 146 -- Jesper Parnevik (Sweden) 76, 70.
149 -- David Feherty (Northern Ireland) 69, 80.
* A CLOSING 72 gave Hamilton's Alison Hendry a four-stroke victory in
the West of Scotland Ladies championship over her home course yesterday.
Leading scores:
146 -- A Hendry (Hamilton) 74, 72. 150 -- P Hutton (Lanark) 76, 74.
151 -- F McKay (Turnberry) 76, 75 bsr.
Team: 299 -- Lanarkshire (Ruth Rankin, Fiona McKay, Janice Gardner).
* ENGLAND'S Helen Wadsworth was nine off the lead, held by Sweden's
Liselotte Neumann, in the Gunze Cup at Inagi, Japan, after yesterday's
second round. She carded a four-over-par 76 for a three-over total of
147.

LATER today, the little Border town of Jedburgh hosts one of its
favourite days, the Tennents Jed-Forest Sevens, and one of the town's
favourite sons, Gary Armstrong, sidelined for much of the season with a
bad knee injury, reveals, just two weeks before this summer's biggest
sporting event, that he turned down the chance given to him by the
Scottish Rugby Union to get fit, at their expense, for the World Cup
later this month.
''The SRU contacted my surgeon to try to find out if I could have been
fit for the start of the tournament, and he brought the date forward for
me to start to take contact on my knee from late summer to the start of
May,'' said Armstrong.
''I was then offered a trip to Lilleshall in England to help me, but I
felt that it was rushing things too much, and I turned it down. They
were keen for me to go. Obviously, they felt that there was a chance to
get fit in time for the World Cup, but I wasn't for it.''
But that hasn't stopped the man some still call the best all-round
scrum half in the world from doing his best at the non-contact version
of rugby -- touch rugby -- when supposedly coaching his charges at
Riverside. Spies testify that if anyone can make touch rugby look
menacing, then it is a very fit Armstrong.
''Aye,'' said Armstrong, ''I'm running about playing touch alright,
but I've not had any contact work at all. The knee feels good, and,
after the initial stiffness, I'm only bothered by the hard grounds we
are having just now.''
It's not just rugby that places barriers in the way of the great man's
rehabilitation. Border legend has it that his horse has been doing its
best to put the cause of Scottish rugby back yet more.
''She has thrown me, I admit it,'' he said. ''It's just as well I
didnae fall on my knee, that's all I can say.''
Somehow it's hard to decide who would come off worse if that were to
happen, Armstrong, or the horse.
But here's where the Border clubs are different. The Tennents
Jed-Forest Sevens are the last sevens date of the season, and the town
knows that their biggest crowd of the year, coming from all parts of the
country, will spill down to Jedburgh to watch one of the few tournaments
untarnished by the obligatory big-name guests, and where Scottish clubs
battle it out in an even contest.
Unlike many a city club of, perhaps, far greater monetary resources,
the whole town of Jedburgh, or so it would seem, has been out to help.
Armstrong, for instance, has been hard to contact with his wife
patiently telling callers that ''Gary's down at Riverside . . . helping
out for the sevens.''
Jed-Forest, though, always has had the special feel of a club at ease
with itself, with a touch of humour, and no arrogance. A club which has
produced Roy Laidlaw and Armstrong, but still a club that would never
admit to having superstars.
''My gaffer has lent the club my lorry for a while, so I've been
picking up beer and lemonade for the people who are going to arrive,''
said Armstrong.
''All the players have been doing their bit, and the committee, and
the town has a real buzz about it this year.
''We call the event the Family Sevens because that's what it is, and
we like to think that we give people a good welcome, and we want folk to
enjoy themselves. If I can do my bit then that's great.''
Armstrong, one of today's helpers then, will just have to watch as his
old team-mates try to win a Sevens title that he himself has never won,
and for all the nation's willingness to see him back in action, he
appears as laid back as ever, just observing and taking it all in.
''I don't think that anyone should get too upset if Scotland don't
look too impressive in Spain because they will be training really hard
and getting ready for the World Cup,'' he said.
''And I think we have a good team for the dry ground in South Africa.
When you think of the criticism we all gave the team, they were brave
enough to change key players and now they are playing the right type of
game.''
As to his own personal desire to jump back into the fray, well, it's
hard to tell just what goes on in that head at times.
Armstrong is highly intelligent, and can come across as a deep, quiet,
family man, which is an exterior that hides a sparkle that few can ever
have.
''I'm scared to take a knock, but I will when the time is right,'' he
said. ''We'll then see how things work out. It's getting the first bump
that's important.''
Try to go down to Jed today, you'll enjoy it. And if you're there,
walk up to Armstrong and tell him to get better soon.
After all, there are a few of us old codgers that like his town, and
his style of play, and want to see him competing again.

NASEEM Hamed's more recent opponents have come with sturdy chins and
big intentions -- but have ended their brief British appearances needing
a shoulder to lean on.
In the rural setting of the Royal Bath and West Showground today in
Shepton Mallett, exciting, extrovert Hamed will attempt to spoil another
respectable and durable record brought by Mexican Enrique Angeles.
Not only will it make Hamed a millionaire in his 13-month, eight-fight
association with promoter Frank Warren but it could be his last
assignment before he sets his sights higher to a challenge against smart
Puerto Rican WBA super-bantamweight champion Wilfredo Vasquez.
When Hamed, 21, won the WBC international title he defends for the
fourth time against Angeles, his opponent, Freddy Cruz, had never
previously been stopped in his long career. Hamed destroyed Cruz in six
rounds in Sheffield last October.
Five weeks later, previously unbeaten and world-ranked Laureano
Ramirez folded in three rounds at Cardiff Ice Rink in Hamed's first
defence.
In January, Mexican iron-man Armando Castro, who had stood up to the
best punchers around and not been halted for six years, failed to get
past the fourth round and last time Argentina's Sergio Rafael Liendo,
never stopped in 50 fights, was blasted away in the second.
Now comes Angeles, 21, from a family of six just outside Mexico City,
who has never been knocked down in 30 fights and his only stoppage
defeat in four losses came by way of a cut.
So Hamed must turn on the power again to match up to his prediction of
a two or three-round victory and emphasise he is very much a young man
moving quickly to the top of his profession.

THE Scottish Claymores will try to pick themselves up for the second
half of the World League season when they take on the Auld Enemy at
Murrayfield tomorrow.
The much-awaited clash with the London Monarchs was being sold as the
match of the season when Claymores' general manager Sandy Waters first
announced Edinburgh would be hosting a Scottish team in the World League
back in March.
Then, Waters was hoping both teams would be undefeated going into this
week-five meeting, making for a 'winner-take-all' clash, the victors
hosting the World Bowl in June. But how that scenario has changed.
Both have one victory and three losses but the stakes are still high.
The pride of both teams and adopted nations and with it the bragging
rights as to who is best in Britain, not to mention hopes of making it
to the World Bowl by winning the second half of the season, are all up
for grabs.
Moreover, a loss tomorrow would kill off all the marketing and
promotions that have enticed 20,000, more out of curiosity than support,
to Murrayfield so far. It's one thing to turn out once to see a new
sport, but another thing entirely to show up on a regular basis and pay
good money to watch a bunch of losers.
The Claymores have the psychological edge after beating Bobby
Hammond's Monarchs twice in pre-season scrimmage matches.
The kick-off at Murrayfield is at 4pm, with the backfields party
starting at 1pm.
In the other fixtures, league leaders Amsterdam Admirals take on Rhein
Fire with Barcelona Dragons travelling to Frankfurt Galaxy -- both
matches being played today.

<TEXT>
HEARTS' longest-serving player, Gary Mackay, who ought to know a thing
or two about the capital derby, has no doubts that the final meeting of
the Edinburgh clubs this season will be the most important in his 15
years with the club.
Mackay, who has played in around 50 of these tense contests and lost
only four times, said yesterday: ''Every derby has its own pressures
around the city because all the fans want to win, but in this instance
there is so much more as both sides are desperate for the points.''
The devastation which would be felt by Mackay, a Hearts man from head
to toe, if the worst came to the worst and the Tynecastle side were to
go down, is not difficult to envisage, but he is confident his team can
ensure there will be an end to the agonising by beating their old
rivals.
''The good thing is that it is in our own hands and we need no favours
from others, although I wouldn't say no to a draw at Pittodrie.''
Not surprisingly, the midfield player finds the whole scenario a touch
bizarre. ''It is incredible to think that we are fighting to stay up and
Hibs are chasing European points, when 10 years ago the roles were
completely reversed. But our players have a habit of churning out
ressults in this game and we are ready for it.''
Manager Tommy McLean has to decide if he should use striker John
Robertson from the start -- he came on for 18 minutes last week with his
broken arm protected by a strapping.
Robertson, whose scoring record against Hibs is outstanding, had a
reserve outing during the week and it looks likely that he will be
called upon to aid the cause. John Millar is doubtful.
Hibs manager Alex Miller will bring back Steven Tweed, fit after
injury, to replace injured captain Gordon Hunter but Darren Jackson will
be confined to the stand as a result of suspension.
While that tense meeting is going on, Partick Thistle will be trying
to find the one point they require for safety to set the Maryhill
celebrations going ahead of VE Day, but collecting it against Falkirk,
who still have an eye on the runners-up place, will not be
straightforward.
Manager John Lambie has tried hard to keep his players' minds on the
job as they get closer to their goal and, if he can manage it one one
more time, he may well emerge from the dressing room with three cigars
in his mouth.
''We still have a big job to do,'' he said, ''and to be honest I think
Falkirk and Kilmarnock should be the teams people talk about after the
way they have ended up in the table, rather than us. This might go right
to the wire yet.''
He has to check on three players, Kevin McKee, Tommy Turner, and Rod
McDonald, but, as ever with the current Jags, it will be about team
effort rather than individualism.
Falkirk, who have shown a fair amount of that quality themselves, will
have Neil Oliver standing by if Joe McLaughlin is unfit. Forbes Johnston
is already ruled out.

A MAJOR working demonstration of grassland equipment is to be held at
Woodend Farm, Armadale, West Lothian next month. The two-day event -- on
June 14 and 15 --is being organised by the Agricultural Engineers'
Association and the Scottish Agricultural College in association with
the Scottish Farmer. It will be the first collective grassland
demonstration in Scotland for a number of years.
Farmers will be able to compare a wide range of grassland machines and
systems in action, harvesting about 100 acres of grass over the two
days. All of the major UK grassland equipment suppliers are supporting
the event.

* I am due to retire in a few weeks and am somewhat bemused by the
advice so far received. For example, it has been suggested by a building
society that I invest half my lump sum in PEPs and unit trusts for
growth, a quarter in an annuity plan and a quarter in an easy access
account for immediate expenses, which should, along with the annuity,
cover an expected shortfall of #185 per month.
Another suggestion from an assurance company is to invest half the
lump sum in a savings account, a quarter to a third in a Post Office
savings account for easy access and to make up the estimated shortfall,
and the remainder in PEPs.
I noted you advised investment trusts rather than PEPs to one investor
and wonder why no company has made this suggestion. I expect a lump sum
of #40,000 plus a pension of approximately #13,000 per annum and the
state pension. While retaining a quarter of this sum for immediate
expenses and the estimated shortfall, I wish to consider half of the
lump sum for income and the remainder for growth. My wife's part-time
earnings are no more than #2000. We have an outstanding mortgage of
#5000.
* There are many ways of skinning a cat, so it is not surprising you
have received varied advice, especially as the examples you quote are
from institutions presumably offering their own products rather than
independent financial advisers who might take a broader view.
We would make two points concerning your estimated monthly shortfall
of #185. The costs associated with your mortgage would disappear if you
repaid it out of your lump sum and this would reduce your shortfall.
Second, your wife's earnings are well short of her personal allowance
of #3525. This means she could receive an income of around #1500 a year
without being liable to tax. The most obvious way of providing this
would be a substantial investment in a high-income building society
account, perhaps one paying interest monthly. A small portfolio of gilts
could be even more productive, though it might be wisest to have a
combination of the two. Expect this to use up about half your lump sum.
If possible, the balance should be used to provide capital growth for
your future. We would recommend putting the funds in five or six
investment trusts, which could be bought through the managers' savings
schemes to economise on costs. Alternatively, it would do no harm if
some of this was held through PEPs, though it is more important you get
good quality investments.
We would not recommend an annuity at this stage unless there was no
other way of providing you with sufficient income. You may have to
juggle around with the figures yourself, but hopefully our suggestions
will help you.
* My relative, age group 75-80, basic rate taxpayer, is about to go
into a nursing home. He receives about #900 per month from pensions and
dividends from M&amp;S, ICI and Zeneca shares. The #100,000 from his house
sale is invested with Royal Scottish Assurance, divided into two giving
income monthly from one and annually from the other, no tax being
payable. He has in addition about #17,000 in National Savings. Is this a
wise distribution?
He would also like some advice about gilts. A friend has been telling
him they would give a better return.
* The investment that really stands out is the #100,000 in Royal
Scottish and it would be much better, from the investment performance
perspective, to have this money more diversified. You do not say exactly
what product it is invested in, but it would probably be possible to
obtain higher income elsewhere. You could consult an independent
financial adviser over this.
Apart from that, a portfolio of three shares is too narrow, though the
quality of the companies is such that you can safely leave them be if
you choose.
As for gilts, you are right they would generate more income, though
you must remember the capital value will go down if interest rates rise
and vice versa. So they are not entirely risk free, unless held to
maturity, when you know exactly how much will be repaid.
* You have regularly mentioned in answers about inheritance tax that
everyone has an annual entitlement to an exemption of #3000. But is it
not the case that there is a restriction which limits the amount gifted
to each person to #250 a year, after which inheritance tax applies?
* In addition to the annual inheritance tax exemption of #3000 there
is also a separate small gifts exemption of #250. This allows #250 to be
given to any number of individuals each year with no liability to IHT
and without eating into the annual exemption of #3000.
The small gifts exemption cannot, however, be used against part of a
larger gift. For example, a present of #3250 could not be covered by the
annual and small gifts exemptions together. The idea behind the
exemption is really one of administrative convenience and is intended to
remove from taxation birthday, Christmas and similar types of gifts.

TROON Welbeck's Hugh McKibbin tees off in the Lytham Trophy today over
the historic links of Royal Lytham and St Annes in Lancashire intent on
making another stride towards a Walker Cup position in the Great Britain
and Ireland side to face America in September.
A near flawless performance against Sweden for Scotland at Loch Lomond
this week augured well as the biennial confrontation looms ever nearer
-- yet the Scottish Amateur champion recognises that a 72-hole
strokeplay tournament presents a different challenge.
Despite taking three points from a possible four against the
super-serious Swedes, McKibbin admits he is seen as more of a matchplay
golfer and, indeed, missed the cut here by a stroke last year.
''Hopefully I will improve in that respect,'' he said.
All five of McKibbin's defeated Scotland team-mates have made the
journey south to bolster a large Scottish contingent of 19.

AGRICULTURE Minister William Waldegrave stepped back from wholesale
privatisation of the State Veterinary Service yesterday.
Instead the core field veterinary service will remain under the
control of the Ministry of Agriculture with only minor privatisation of
some animal health schemes.
Tuberculin testing will also be opened to suitably qualified lay
personnel working under veterinary direction.
The Oppostion and veterinary authorities have fought a long war
against the feared privatisation in the consulation period over the past
year.
Only hours before Mr Waldegrave's statement in the Commons, Dr Gavin
Strange, Shadow Minister of Agriculture, had condemned the proposal --
now confirmed -- to turn the Veterinary Investigation Service into an
agency as ''dogma''.
But dogma appeared to be largely ditched as Mr Waldegrave spelled out
his priorities. These were that the SVS would be reorganised into fewer
and larger regions with the loss of some administrative but not
veterinary posts.
Some voluntary livestock health schemes -- notably for pigs, deer and
poultry would be retained under Ministry responsibility although charges
would be raised to full commercial rates; for sheep, goats and cattle,
discussions would be held with industry groups interested in taking over
elements of the schemes, subject to some specific disease conditions.
On animal welfare, the aim would be to make farm visits more precisely
targeted than the current system of random calls.
The British Veterinary Association said yesterday it would be making
its views on the statement known to Mr Waldegrave in an open letter in
the next few days.

THIRD DIVISION
CALEY Thistle and Ross County do battle today after a week of high
drama in the Highlands. The derby sees County's promotion dream hanging
in the balance, but pride is now the only prize for their north
neighbours.
Former Caley manager Sergei Baltacha will meet his players for the
first time since he resigned on Wednesday.
But team spirits could soar after a court judgment lifted a cloud of
doubt over the transfer of #400,000 of assets from the merger with
Inverness Thistle.
County know a slip at Telford Street could wreck their promotion
hopes, but they also hope manager Bobby Wilson's former club Cowdenbeath
can do them a favour against rivals Montrose.
County defenders Chris Somerville and Dave Mackay are doubtful, but
striker Jamie MacPherson makes a return after injury.
Wilson is plotting victory with a tactical shuffle. ''We know a lot
about Caley Thistle and we have one or two surprises up our sleeves,''
he said. ''It should be a torrid affair, but my boys can handle the
pressure.''
Honours are even between the sides this season with one win, a draw,
and four goals each in the three matches so far.
Caley's Charlie Christie and Dave Brennan are back after injury, but
full-back Steven MacDonald is suspended.

GOLF: ITALIAN OPEN
RONAN Rafferty, who, from No.1 in Europe in 1989, sank to his
worst-ever position of sixty-fourth last year, is on the way back up the
golfing ladder.
The 31-year-old Irishman, who leads the Italian Open in Milan with a
two-round aggregate of 135, nine under par, still is reluctant to admit
that his game is better than ''fairly average.''
He shot a four-under-par 68 yesterday to lead Italian Costantino
Rocca, Spaniard Jose Rivero, and Englishmen Paul Broadhurst and Mark
Litton, by one shot. Sweden's Jarmo Sandelin and Italians Emanuele
Canonica and Michele Reale are two off the pace.
Rafferty refused to reveal how it felt to be leading a European Tour
event again. Did he play well today? ''Well, everything was fairly
average,'' said the non-committal Irishman. ''The field is very tightly
bunched with everyone within nine shots of the lead.
''I played with Mark James and he has played just as nicely as me yet
he is only one under par.''
Rafferty still managed to shoot five birdies and had only one bogey,
at the 391-yard ninth, where he hit his No.4-wood tee shot into water
and had to take a penalty drop.
Rafferty's poor play in the past year was mainly due to bad driving,
but even he admits that it is on ''an upward spiral.'' Not great, just
getting better.
Broadhurst, who, like Rafferty, has been struggling during the past 18
months, had two eagles in his second round of 67. He sank a 130-yard
wedge shot for a 2 at the 372-yard fourth and then, after hitting the
par-5 eighteenth in two, he sank a 30-foot putt.
Four Scots are well-placed. Stephen McAllister (70) is three behind
Rafferty, Andrew Coltart (71) and Sam Torrance (70) are one more shot
adrift on 139, while on 140 is Gary Orr (71). Leading qualifier (British
or Irish unless stated):
135 -- R Rafferty 67, 68.
136 -- P Broadhurst 69, 67; C Rocca (Italy) 68, 68; M Litton 68, 68; J

DUMFRIES racing driver Allan McNish starts his long-awaited campaign
to win the European Formula 3000 championship and be a contender for
Formula 1 fame next year.
He is racing tomorrow at the famous Silverstone circuit in the opening
round of the F3000 title race in what should be one of the most keenly
contested championships in Europe.
The 24-year-old driver, who has been out of competitive racing for the
past two seasons, is confident that with the backing of the Paul Stewart
racing team he will be in contention at the end of the eight-round title
tilt.
It will be a gruelling start to the season, with Silverstone being
followed next weekend by the Barcelona round of the championship -- a
warm-up race to the big Formula 1 event which will feature McNish's
friend and rival, grand-prix driver David Coulthard, from Twynholm. They
were brought up only 25 miles away from other and have kept in touch
throughout their careers.

FIRST DIVISION
THOSE splendid gentlemen at the heart of Scottish football's frenetic
first division finally have run out of a standard phrase or saying that
has been used ad infinitum at interviews.
''We're taking one game at a time.'' Managers' quotes, page one,
paragraph one.
The facts for those who want premier division football next season are
simple. One game each for Raith Rovers, Dunfermline, Dundee, and
probably to a slightly lesser extent, Scottish Cup finalists Airdrie,
could decide everything by around 4.45pm today.
Derby days are bad enough under normal circumstances, but when leaders
Raith Rovers play hosts -- the word is used with care -- to Fife
neighbours Dunfermline in second place, and Dundee welcome Perth rivals
St Jonnstone the way voters are likely to decide for the Government in a
forthcoming by-election, then anything can, and probably will happen.
Let's take the game that could decide it all at the top. Raith Rovers'
only problem seems to be that manager Jimmy Nicholl cannot play because
of suspension. A trip to a golf course yesterday as part of training
probably helped to relax a Kirkcaldy side who have shown better form
away from home this season. But as Nicholl said: ''We're not thinking
about a draw. We want the three points.''
Bert Paton and his Dunfermline side look back to a 5-2 win the last
time they visited Stark Park, and despite being without the suspended
Stewart Petrie, and the injured Hamish French, Kenny Ward, Gary Higgins,
and Neale Cooper still reckon they can haul back the three-point
difference to take the promotion battle, as they and the managers of
other sides have maintained all season, to the wire.
What Paton does not want is a repeat of last season when a defeat in
the second last game of the season let Falkirk through.
''Obviously, we cannot forget that,'' he said. ''But the difference
this time is that we're coming from behind. It is up to us to win.''
Dunfermline will give Jackie McNamara a late fitness test, but will
welcome back Marc Millar, who is fit again after having been involved in
a car crash.

<HEADLINE>Meconic comes to the market. World leader in pain alleviation set for a capitalisation of #40m</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ONE of Scotland's oldest companies and world leader as the ''gold
standard in pain control'' and whose products are in most kitchens is
coming to the market with a capitalisation of around #40m under the
wings of the Meconic holding company.
Founded in 1780, Macfarlan Smith has always specialised in opiates
which came into their own in Victorian times to acquire a certain
notoriety.
Things have changed somewhat. Today Macfarlan as world leader in pain
alleviation, including the vital ingredient for Nurofen, occupies a
nine-acre site between Murrayfield and Tynecastle in Edinburgh with
around 200 employees.
It emerged as the outcome in 1990 of a management buy-out from Glaxo
at a cost of around #14m after the pharmaceuticals giant realised it had
a winner on its hands with the Zantac anti-ulcer drug and reversed its
active acquisition programme of the 1960s.
Managing director Marshall Smalley led the buy-out with the backing of
3i with 20%, NatWest with 17%, and Noble Grossart and the Bank of
Scotland with 5% each as the leading participants. After the flotation,
perhaps in early June, the management and staff will have between 25%
and 30%.
One thing is certain. No merchant bank will have worked as hard as
Barings for the first flotation since its collapse and rescue -- the
relationship with Meconic stretches back to the MBO -- and desperately
needs a corporate success.
Broker to the issue is Smith New Court which will ensure substantial
institutional interest in the placing.
Pain killers, led by the commodity codeine but also the higher margin
morphine and other controlled drugs, accounted for 77% of the 1994
turnover of #26.4m which generated #3.4m of operating profits. Some
three billion pain killers are sold each year.
Dr Smalley said that Macfarlan looks after people from before the
cradle to the grave with its Pethidine used in childbirth to morphine at
the terminal stage. It also produces methadone to wean addicts off
heroin.
Apart from the controlled drugs, there is a conflict between EU
legislation and international law on their use, Macfarlan manufactures
Apomorphine which is effective in controlling Parkinson's disease.
Contract manufacture accounts for just 2% of turnover at present but
is where the major growth lies. It is collaborating with Shire Chemicals
of Andover to produce Galanthamine which should become a commercial
product in 1999 to control Alzheimer's disease.
The kitchen will almost certainly contain cleaners containing Bitrex
whose taste deters any child from swallowing hazardous liquids. This is
a high-margin product but is so effective that just a few parts in a
million are sufficient.
The history of the company has been of long-term development with a
research and development programme of about #1m a year.
As volume increases, margins will improve substantially from the
current 12% -- since the MBO capacity working has risen from one-third
to one-half and it would cost perhaps less than #500,000 a year by way
of labour costs to double output.
About half the staff participated in the buy-out with Dr Smalley
anxious to encourage involvement. Each #1 invested five years ago could
be worth between #25 and #35 on flotation.
The monies being raised will be used to pay down debt and pay off the
#3m of Preference shares to leave Meconic perhaps 10% geared. It has
been able to make acquisitions since the MBO included Rorer's cocaine
packaging activities.
And unlike the vast proportion of other entrants to the market in the
fine chemicals and bio-sciences sector, it will be paying a dividend
from the first year. Appropiate comparisons are BTP, Holliday, Hicksons
and Yorkshire Chemicals all trading at around 14 times earnings.
It is heartening see a solid, highly-respected Scottish manufacturing
company about to enter the Stock Exchange lists -- the pity is there are
so few.

FRENCHMAN Didier Auriol, driving a Toyota Celica, won the thirty-ninth
Tour de Corse Rally which finished in Ajaccio yesterday. It was his
sixth victory in the last eight years.
The undisputed master of Corsica's narrow, bumpy special stages
delivered his coup de gras during yesterday's third leg, first
displacing Frenchman Francois Delecour (Escort) from second place, then
inheriting the lead from a distraught Bruno Thiry, when a wheelbearing
seized on the Belgian's Escort, 55km from the finish.
Auriol's success was achieved despite a last-minute change of
navigator.
Carlos Sainz (Subaru Impreza) finished fourth and retains his lead in
the World Championship at its mid-point. Team-mate Colin McRae from
Lanark was fifth. Provisional results:
1, D Auriol (F)/D Giraudet (F) Toyota Celica 5-14-49; 2, F Delecour
(F)/C Francois (F) Ford Escort 5-15-04; 3, A Aghini (I)/S Farnocchia (I)

TENNIS
MILES Maclagan, the No.5 seed, took his place in the semi-finals of
the LTA Spring Satellite tournament at Craiglockhart yesterday at the
expense of fellow-Scot Ross Matheson.
The Zambian-born Scottish No.2 won the duel in the sun 7-6 (7-5), 6-2
in the first match between Scotland's big two on a Scottish court.
Maclagan broke serve in the fourth game when Matheson
uncharacteristically served three double faults, but he broke back in
the ninth game, after which Maclagan received a code violation for
throwing his racket to the ground. Matheson then saved four set-points
at 4-5, 0-40 and two more in the tie-break.
The Scottish No.1 admitted later that it was a huge psychological blow
to lose such a tight first set. He received a code violation for ball
abuse in the first game of the second set and, when he lost his chance
with a break point for 2-0, he seemed to lose his concentration.
Maclagan broke him again in the third and the fifth games and his own
serve was under little threat thereafter.
''It wasn't high-quality tennis and was very scrappy, but I'll take
the win whichever way it comes,'' Maclagan said afterwards. ''I've felt
from the beginning that I could win this tournament -- it's just a case
of plyaing tough in every match.''
Matheson echoed: ''I'd be surprised if he lost. He's just back from
the Davis Cup and is a clay-court expert. This is his department and he
should do well here.''
Maclagan now faces Australian Allen Bellobrajdic, who beat compatriot
Grant Doyle after the No.2 seed retired with a groin strain at 6-2, 1-0
down.

ROYAL Bank of Scotland will soon become the first UK bank to offer its
offshore customers a 24-hour telephone banking service 365 days a year.
The service will be launched in July by Royal Bank's Jersey-based
subsidiary Royal Bank of Scotland International (RBSI) and will make
life easier for thousands of clients living outside European time zones.
RBSI chief executive Cameron McPhail said the telephone banking
service will be operated by 25 core staff in Jersey with up to 100 more
on call, and should double the growth rate of new business from 12% to
20%-25% per year.
RBSI's main customers are tens of thousands of retired people living
overseas and expatriates working in low-tax areas who want to keep their
money offshore, while retaining direct access to the UK to make standing
orders and other payments.
Mr McPhail said most live in Spain, Portugal, North America, Hong Kong
and the Middle East.
Until now they have mainly performed transactions with RBSI by letter
or fax and many have virtually no contact with the bank at all.
The introduction of telephone banking will make communications easier
and faster and RBSI hopes it will lead to the development of more
business in areas such as savings and investment accounts and offshore
mortgages.
''They will be able to conduct a lot of routine business by phone,
such as making balance inquiries, credit card inquiries and renewals,
paying routine bills, transferring money between accounts and buying and
selling foreign currency and stocks and shares,'' Mr McPhail said.
''It is pretty much like First Direct (Midland's successful domestic
telephone bank), but the thing is it's multi-currency. If you want a
cheque book in dollars you can have one,'' he said.
Mr McPhail said RBSI had invested more than #1m in updating its
computer systems to launch the new telephone banking service for
offshore clients and should be narrowly ahead of its rivals in launching
the concept.
''We understand others are working on it, but we are the first,'' he
said.

GLASGOW Tigers may fancy their chance of capturing a third successive
league title, but bookmakers are not impressed by their
credentials.Enterprising layers quoted their first odds ever on the
sport this week following the BSPA decision to allow race betting, and
Scotland's clubs get short shrift from the men in the know.
Tigers are virtual no-hopers at 33-1 for the premier crown, while old
rivals Edinburgh Monarchs are a distant 100-1.
Eastbourne Eagles are 2-1 favourites, while last season's division one
winners Poole Pirates are rated 5-1 along with the club that finished 19
points behind Glasgow in 1994, Peterborough Panthers.
Glasgow would upset a few predictions tonight if they overturn 25-1
hopes Cradley Heath at Dudley Wood. Australian Mickie Powell is again
out because of an ankle injury. His place goes to Alan Mogridge, of
Arena Essex.
Last night Eagles edged out Monarchs 49-46 at Powderhall. Edinburgh
saw a six point lead disappear over the final six races.
Monarchs lost Scott Lamb, who was injured in his first race. Only Mike
Faria (12) and Jan Andersen (11) competed successfully.

<HEADLINE>Meat wholesalers warn on the costs of hygiene</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>28</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978534515</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE introduction of the new meat hygiene service earlier this year --
originally promised to reduce costs to abattoirs -- had resulted in
additional costs to the meat industry in Scotland of #700,000, it was
claimed yesterday.
John Scott, president of the Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers,
warned: ''The industry simply cannot afford the level of increase being
imposed.''
Speaking at the association's annual conference in Renfrew, Mr Scott
appealed to Ian Robertson, regional manager of the new service, to look
at hourly charges, manning levels and down-time charges so that costs
could be reduced to affordable levels.
In an address to the conference Mr Robertson accepted that there was
dissatisfaction. ''The new service does seem to be costing more and that
is a continuing puzzle because the official figures show an overall
reduction in costs from #45m to #40m,'' he said.
''Where are those winners? -- if there are winners they are very
silent winners. Everyone says it is costing them more.''
Under the old arrangements some local authorities had been
under-charging but that could not be the total explanation, he said. Mr
Robertson emphasised that his organisation was keen to avoid conflict
and to establish a harmonious relationship with the industry.
Alf Green, managing director of McIntosh Donald of Portlethen,
Aberdeen, claimed, however, that conflict was a distinct possibility
because the new arrangements were anything but cost-effective. His own
plant, he said, was faced with ''horrendous'' increases in costs of meat
inspection.
Mr Robertson assured the conference that the issue was being addressed
urgently. ''I know you want a pay-off now -- but it is coming,'' he
said. ''In the next three months you will see a mammoth change.''
Hopes of a compromise solution in the present disagreement among the
EU member states on journey times for livestock were raised by Andrew
Wilson, head of the veterinary public health section of the European
Commission.
The council of ministers at the end of this month would consider a
two-tier proposal with eight hours' travel followed by 24 hours' rest at
the ''standard'' grade and 12 hours' travel followed by eight hours'
rest at the ''executive'' level which would have lower stocking
densities and higher standards of ventilation. Most stock intended for
slaughter would come into the eight-hour category which was where the
bulk of the welfare problems arose, he said.
He assessed the chances of agreement, however, as being finely
balanced with Germany and Austria still holding out for shorter journeys
and Spain and Italy taking the opposite view. The French presidency was
keen to reach a compromise, he said.
The prospect on an increase in the number of dairy cows being culled
could have serious implications for Scottish specialist beef producers,
Bob Bansback, industry development director of the Meat and Livestock
Commission, warned.
''As wholesalers you might ask why there should be any concern about
additional supplies of beef at lower prices? Surely this means more
throughput for abattoirs, more opportunities to encourage consumption
and a healthier situation all round?
''If prices are allowed to reduce too much at a time when support is
being gradually withdrawn it could have an adverse effect on producer
confidence -- and longer-term supplies of beef to your meat plants could
be in jeopardy.''
That was at the moment a concern and not a major worry, he said, but
it highlighted the need for the Scottish beef industry to find
profitable outlets for all categories of its beef production.

SECOND DIVISION
MEADOWBANK Thistle's final game at their ghostly stadium in Edinburgh,
watched by a crowd of 473, resulted in a 1-0 win which kept alive their
slim hope of retaining second-division status for their move to a new
home at Livingston from next season.
The fortieth-minute strike by Lee Bailey also ended the promotion hope
of Thistle's former manager Terry Christie and his club, Stenhousemuir.
A season in which 'Muir memorably beat Aberdeen in the Scottish Cup has
turned sour with the loss of a prize which at one time seemed assured.
Meadowbank's chances of catching Queen of the South remain slim.
Thistle must beat Morton next week and hope that Queens lose both their
closing games by something like 4-0.
Meanwhile, Dumbarton will have few sympathisers today as they go to
Greenock for what is probably the championship decider.
For certain, victory would give Morton the title but Dumbarton could
still have some work to do even if they take three points today. Their
problem is that next week they must visit the team who currently are
only two points behind them, Stirling Albion.
Morton defender Derek Collins will miss the top-of-the-table clash,
which will feature a battle between the home side's strike force of
Derek Lilley and Finn Marko Rajamaki, and the Dumbarton pairing of
Martin Mooney and Hugh Ward.
At the start of the season, Kevin Drinkell would have settled for the
challenge his Stirling team face -- win your last two games, both at
home, and promotion is assured.
Craig Taggart is likely to return for Albion against Clyde, who have
Martin Clark and Ian Angus out of the reckoning as they attempt to stay
in the promotion hunt with a win. They also need Morton to beat
Dumbarton -- and then Stirling to beat the Sons next week. If so, goal
difference is not a big problem for Clyde.
Berwick Rangers visit lowly Queen of the South and, like the Forthbank
rivals, will be hoping for a Morton victory that could leave Dumbarton
stranded on the 57-point mark.
Steve Archibald's East Fife visit the doomed Brechin City in the
division's solitary meaningless match.

additional #50,000 for his labours above the normal #22,500 paid to
non-executive directors and the #53,500 due to him as deputy chairman.

FOLLOWING Tuesday's huge victory parade through Red Square, which
promises to be more of that old-time religion we used to see each May
Day, the wreath-laying at the tomb of the Unknown Soldier, and the
wining and dining in the Kremlin to mark the 50th anniversary of the end
of the Second World War, Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin will next day
get down to business. Such meetings sometimes achieve results meetings
of officials cannot because politicians, if so inclined, are able to cut
through the red tape which bedevils their subordinates' dealings. The
difficulties arise when the high principles expected of leaders clash
with pork-barrel realities.
Presidents Reagan and Gorbachev once got famously carried away at such
a confrontation in Helsinki, but a similar rapport seems unlikely on
Wednesday. The hope is they will at least smooth the path towards
resolving the current disagreements, particularly over Iran. The fear is
that they could get themselves even more deeply entrenched. Moscow and
Washington have fallen out over a whole batch of other issues -- the
eastward expansion of Nato, the killings in Croatia and Bosnia, and
Russia's military intervention in Chechnya -- and the summit provides a
chance to repair some of the damage. The most troublesome area of
disagreement, however, is Russia's decision to sell nuclear technology
to Iran, ostensibly to help completion of a nuclear power station. That
may be the truth, but the chances of it being the whole truth are remote
since the technology could have other, less pacific, applications. The
US Secretary of State, Mr Warren Christopher, has said Washington will
not be satisfied with anything less than an end to nuclear co-operation
between Russia and Iran and the cancellation of the deal. Russia insists
it is motivated by peaceful aims, has no intention of helping Iran build
up a nuclear arsenal, and denies any agreement to supply a gas
centrifuge system exists. But, as the Supergun showed here, it is almost
impossible for a country to control what is done with material it
supplies another.
Mr Yeltsin's top foreign policy adviser, Mr Dmitry Ryurikov, was in
conciliatory mood yesterday, insisting Mr Yeltsin would listen
''carefully and soberly'' to whatever Mr Clinton had to say. He also
revealed the two men were likely to agree a document on European
security which would touch on the eastward expansion of Nato. Mr Yeltsin
and Mr Clinton must resolve their differences over the Iranian nuclear
deal. Nobody actually expects the summit to founder in a welter of
recriminations. As always, a gloss will be put on things. But it would
be a step in the right direction if Mr Yeltsin did listen soberly and
Moscow agreed to ban supplying equipment to make bomb-grade fuel to
Iran. The trouble is both sides have already spelled out where they
stand rather more clearly than is wise. Never say never is a sound
diplomatic tenet. Cold War II is not in prospect, but the chill in
relations is likely to persist for some time to come. The world deserves
better.

IF there's one topic that sends managers scurrying away to other
meetings, and has employees shifting nervously on their feet, it's
performance appraisals. Most companies and public sector bodies that are
serious about improving performance will have introduced them -- and I'm
willing to bet the majority have messed them up.
Accurately and fairly assessing the performance of individuals in an
organisation is one of the most difficult tricks in the management book.
It's awkward because they know and you know that their livelihood is
ultimately on the line. It's tough because you may have to say
unpleasant things. Worst of all, it is potentially disastrous in that
you run the risk of wrecking a positive working relationship if the
wrong messages are communicated.
So, if the stakes are high on both sides, why bother? The obvious
answer is that as companies and public sector bodies alike strive to
raise their game, the process of management by objectives (another use
for the acronym MBO) raises its head. I know some of the experts deride
MBO, but from my simple perspective it is the most realistic way for a
growing company to improve its performance.
Laying a structured plan with quite specific goals and objectives over
the day-to-day operations of the organisation and its people is a very
effective method of setting overall and individual priorities. Once you
have identified those priorities you inevitably have to measure whether
people achieve them in the given timescales. In other words, you
introduce a performance appraisal system.
But this is often the point at which managements head up the wrong
path, using appraisals as a mechanism to ensure their staff are doing
their jobs effectively. Of course, the true objective should be to
inspire a greater commitment to their work and the organisation.
Naturally, we've been there, done that. After several unconvincing
stabs at creating an appraisal process using borrowed or adopted
documentation, we concluded the only result had been to make people
confused about our true motives. Enter our non-executive adviser who
undertook to track down some good material from the plethora of books
and videos offered by the training and development industry.
As a result we are all currently working our way through an imposing
set of three videos entitled How to Write and Conduct Effective
Performance Appraisals. It is marketed by CareerTrack, the US-based
company that is rapidly attaining market leadership in the UK training
and development field.
These programmes are real thought provokers. For instance, when you
are preparing for an appraisal session with one of your managers, would
it occur to you to ask four or five people who work at different levels
with that individual to provide in writing three reasons why he or she
does the job well -- and three areas where improvement is required?
Would it also occur to you to ask these contributors to copy their notes
to the subject so the process is entirely out in the open?
Would you have considered keeping in each individual's personnel
folder a form headed Key Incidents, on which you briefly record details
of events and situations which offer a useful insight into their
performance, character and personal traits?
Our next move will be to devise a programme under which each employee
will have a full annual appraisal session lasting up to a day, covering
the spectrum from setting personal objectives to establishing an
improvement and development plan. That session will determine to a
substantial degree the individual's promotion prospects as well as small
matters such as pay.
At quarterly intervals during the year progress in achieving agreed
objectives will be reviewed and new objectives laid down.
All of which leaves just one little detail: who appraises the
appraiser? It looks like it is going to be our non-exec adviser. Must
buy him lunch soon.

IN their darkest nights, haunted by memories of swingometers, trailed
by the grey ghosts of sleaze past and present and by the angry faces of
deposed councillors, who among the members of the Tory Cabinet would
dare to think such an impossible thought? Yes, a trip to Glasgow could
be pleasant. Far from the political Chernobyl which is Westminster, a
faithful Tory can find rest and balm for his wounds in the Elysium of
the Scottish Tory conference next week. That is, of course, if they all
last until next week. The reality of the coming days in England will be
unpleasant for those leading the Tory Party. Senior Cabinet members have
been assembled and briefed for their various television appearances in
support of Mr Major, his policies, and all of his remaining men (and
women). Their support will be solid, their voices firm and resonant;
only their glistening brows will betray that they know perfectly well
what is happening at grassroots around the country this weekend. Back
benchers of all Tory persuasions are meeting their constituents (if they
can find them) and their former councillors (if they cannot avoid them).
These meetings will not be pleasant. The national party is being blamed
by the local party for those uniquely bad polls. Back benchers will
return to Westminster on Tuesday in various moods, ranging from deep
depression to blazing anger. If the angry outnumber the depressed, the
old ritual of blood sacrifice will return.
In a sense it does not matter who the victim is, beyond the fact that
it is most unlikely to be Mr Major, whose skin has seemingly acquired a
non-stick surface worthy of the finest frying pan. Indeed, the
sacrificing of the hapless, while psychologically satisfying in the
deepest and most vengeful recesses of the political soul, is really no
answer at all. Nor are the various mantras, whirling over Tory
gatherings like Buddhist prayer wheels. They merely repeat the idiotic,
such as the contention that it is presentation which is wrong rather
than policies, and that two more years (oh weary thought) will bring a
glow of satisfaction to the electorate, and a flash-flood of votes to
the party. Mr Major has confirmed this departure from reality. Wishing
his ex-councillors a nice sabbatical, he insists that policies will not
change and that he is confident that in two years the faithful will come
flooding back. Well, the policies are wrong, and the degree of
disaffection is so great that it must be wondered if any return of
support could equal the haemorrhaging which has already occurred. The
truth is that the British public appears sick to its bones with the Tory
Party. The issues which have contributed to this perception are legion,
but the palpable feelings of unfairness which radiate from so many
Government policies, such as the NHS, social provision, education,
housing, privatisation, and quangos, are such that only those immune to
squeamishness could support them with real conviction. No wonder Mr
Blair trumpets on about fairness; he knows an opportunity when he sees
it.
The Government's response to the electoral biffing administered by
Labour and the Liberal Democrats will be interesting in the extreme. The
first test came yesterday, when the Chancellor was expected to raise
interest rates a little to hold back inflation. Technically the
arguments for and against a rise were fairly balanced. It was possible
to be agnostic without incurring derision. The crucial point is that
expectations in the City had been raised, and when the Chancellor
decided against a rise, he was widely seen as taking risks with the
economy because he was afraid to pile further political agony on the
Government. The pound suffered dreadfully, despite Bank of England
intervention, and the perception now is that the Government can be
deflected from its economic policies by political considerations. This
may be unfair, but it is also unavoidable. Having made this particular
bed, Mr Clarke must now lie on it. The best he can do is to close his
eyes and think of Glasgow.

TELEVISION'S Cook Report described him as ''Britain's number one
terrorist''. It is generally accepted that he commanded the Irish
Republican Army in his native Londonderry, masterminding terrorist
violence in the 1970s, including a ruthless campaign of bombings and
assassinations.
Even at the age of 22 he was flown secretly from Ulster, along with a
young Gerry Adams and other imprisoned IRA leaders, to negotiate with
the then British Secretary of State, William Whitelaw. That was in 1972,
and now history is about to repeat itself for Martin McGuinness. Aside
from Adams, he is the other key Irish Republican figure in the current
Ulster peace negotiations. The talks in 1972 were unreported then but
next Wednesday in Belfast, McGuinness will be in the full glare of
international publicity when he leads a Sinn Fein delegation into a
historic meeting with another British Minister, Michael Ancram.
If the two shake hands, it is likely to be behind the closed doors of
a committee room in the Stormont parliament buildings. Neither the
Government nor Northern Ireland seems quite ready yet to accept a public
display of handshaking. That is all the more so after this week's
violent debacle in McGuinness's home city, when Sinn Fein protesters
clashed embarrassingly with the RUC during the Prime Minister's visit.
Few disbelieve that the man with whom Michael Ancram will speak next
week bears the full confidence of the IRA and carries with him a
knowledge of that organisation's structure and history over the past 25
years, that, perhaps, no other person has managed to achieve.
So who is this spokesman, still in his forties, unstriking in
physique, manner and voice, whom the IRA have trusted to speak for them,
not only now but when he was barely beyond his teenager years.
Martin McGuinness was born in 1950 but he grew up in the dismal
atmosphere of deprivation that pervaded the old walled city of
Londonerry, before its Catholic districts exploded into street violence
in the summer of 1967. Like so many other young Catholics, McGuinness
was a child of that early violence, when the daily and nightly ritual of
life took the form of stone-throwing, petrol-bombing, and
barricade-building in the smokey streets of the Bogside.
His mother came from nearby County Donegal, his father was a foreman
in a foundry. He is the second child in their family of six boys and a
girl. He and his brothers attended the local Christian Brothers school,
which gave them a traditional Irish Catholic education and introduced
them to Gaelic culture and games. When they left school, it was for jobs
in bricklaying and carpentry, and in his case as an assistant in a
butcher's shop.
On October 5, 1968, Martin McGuinness, Londonderry, and Ulster passed
their first milestone of violence. The clash that day between Catholic
civil rights marchers and the RUC sparked off a political revolution and
would carry Ulster to the brink of outright civil war, spawning a
terrorism that neither Britain nor Northern Ireland had ever
experienced.
He was not among the marchers that day, narrowly escaping the batons
and water cannons of the police. Yet it was an experience that provoked
many Ulster Catholics towards militancy. Martin McGuinness, working in
Doherty's, the butchers on Strand Road, was already on a road that led
to the IRA, to prison, and to death and destruction.
As Northern Ireland disintegrated into civil strife, he left his job
and joined the ranks of the ''Ra'', thus committing himself to a young
life of regular street battles in and around the district they called
''Free Derry'', where the RUC, rejected and excluded, had been replaced
by civilian vigilantes from whom would spring the volunteers of the new
IRA, the Provisionals. Though only 20, McGuinness was already making his
mark in the Bogside. He was suspected of being a ringleader and soon to
be the IRA's commander in the city, just as Gerry Adams was achieving
similar notoriety in West Belfast.
The Provos had emerged out of the old ''Official'' IRA, a body which
swiftly lost face with young recruits such as McGuinness and Adams.
They, like many other militants, wanted a more pro-active campaign to
destroy the Unionist dominance of Ulster and to persuade Britain to
leave the province.
The emergence of the new Provos soon led to the bloodiest days of the
entire 25-year Troubles that followed. In 1972, nearly 500 civilians and
security forces were killed, after the British Government introduced
internment without trial in August 1971. That was the year in which
Martin McGuinness claims to have witnessed his first dead victim of the
violence -- a youth shot by troops.
His organisational skills were swiftly recognised within the Provos as
the commander of the IRA's Derry Brigade, at a time when the business
heart of the city was virtually destroyed in a wave of bombings. Even
then his influence was such that along with Adams, he formed part of an
IRA team flown secretly to London on an RAF flight for abortive
negotiations with the British. More than 20 years on, he takes the stage
again, the basic IRA demands of 1972 -- the withdrawal of British
interests and the right of the Irish people to ''self-determine'' their
future -- unchanged.
In the years that followed, McGuinness's militant stature grew
alongside that of Adams. Security sources believe he was commanding
officer of what the IRA calls its Northern Command, director of
operations, and chief of staff from 1978 to 1982. In that period, Lord
Mountbatten was murdered, a bomb at Warrenpoint, on the same day killed
19 soldiers, and there were savage bombing attacks on targets in London.
McGuinness denies IRA involvement, though he also knows that to admit
to any link would leave him open to arrest and imprisonment. He has been
convicted twice in the Irish Republic, but never in Northern Ireland. In
1973 he was arrested in County Donegal, near a car carrying 250lbs of
explosive and 5000 rounds of ammunition, and sent to jail for six
months. He admitted to the court: ''I am a member of the Derry Brigade
of Oglaigh na hEireann (the IRA) and am very, very proud of it.''
A year later, he was in jail again in the Republic, convicted of IRA
membership. He did spend some months in prison in Ulster on a similar
charge which was eventualy dropped. Whatever the truth of his
involvement, there is no doubt that McGuinness has been a dominant
influence among Irish republicans for nearly 25 years now. His
credentials are unquestioned even by hard-liners in border counties who
remain suspicious of the Belfast-based Gerry Adams.
Many observers believe that the IRA insisted on McGuinness leading the
Sinn Fein delegation into talks with, first, British officials, and now,
a Minister of the Crown. He was also trusted to conduct top-secret
soundings with British officials in the early 1990s, approaches which
helped prepare the ground for the IRA's decision to call a ceasefire
last August.
Since the IRA hunger strikes of 1981, when 10 men starved to death in
the Maze Prison, Sinn Fein has emerged as a political force in parallel
with the IRA's campaign. Adams and McGuinness are credited with this
redirection. Their aim lately has been to create a broad-based,
pan-nationalist base in Ireland, encompassing the support of the Irish
Government and of Irish-American interests across the Atlantic. They are
now seeking to achieve by political pressure what the IRA's long terror
campaign failed to do with guns and bombs.
''The old order must fall -- a new day must dawn,'' McGuinness told
the Sinn Fein annual conference in February. ''The tide of history is
flowing with us to journey's end.
''Our opponents stand in awe of our tenacity, ingenuity, and
commitment. The British Government knows it has not defeated us.''
The single-minded and ruthless determination of Martin McGuinness is
self-evident. He has devoted virtually all of his adult years to driving
the British out of Ireland by force and by word. The means do not appear
to matter provided the end is achievable.
From youthful IRA volunteer to chief political negotiator, Martin
McGuinness has dedicated his life to ''the cause''. Many people may
abhor him, but there is no doubting the personal sacrifices of such an
existence.
He exudes little sense of warmth and rarely departs from the set Sinn
Fein script. His steely discipline runs through his private life, too.
He neither drinks nor smokes and away from the current political
limelight, lives a fairly frugal Catholic lifestyle; his home a modest
terraced house in the Bogside, where he and his wife Bernie have reared
a family of five.
''He is a good father, a good husband, a strong churchgoer. I believe
him to be honest and upright in his personal conduct,'' the former
Catholic Bishop of Derry, Dr Edward Daly (an outspoken opponent of IRA
violence), said of McGuinness in a recent interview. But he added: ''No
other living person is a greater threat to the British state.''
As McGuinness leads his small delegation up the steep steps of
Stormont next week, he has the future of the Northern Ireland peace
process weighing on his slight shoulders. How permanent is the IRA
ceasefire? Upon the word of the former butcher's boy from Derry, may
rest the final answer.

THE lobby in favour of changing the 10-club premier-division no doubt
would dismiss the significance, but the fact is that four of the five
games on this penultimate Saturday have serious meaning in terms of the
top end and bottom of the table. Yet, the least important, Celtic v
Rangers, might cause a ripple of interest in its own right.
Even then, strictly speaking, Celtic can still beat Motherwell and
Hibs to second place and the UEFA Cup spot that goes with it, but that
is now an unlikely scenario.
The other games could go a long way towards settling the remaining
issues, that Europe place and, more important, the two teams who will be
heading for either relegation or a play-off to avoid it. The odds, none
the less, are that it will all have to be decided on the very last
afternoon of a very long season.
The state of the art in this country being what it is, however, the
game that will capture most attention, especially as it is on live
television tomorrow afternoon, is the Old Firm confrontation at Hampden.
As Celtic manager Tommy Burns put it: ''If you the put jerseys out
themselves there would be something at stake.''
The Parkhead manager brings in Simon Donnelly for his first taste of
top-team duty since November, although it will probably be as a
substitute. The young man who made such an impact late last season has
had a frustrating time this year, suffering a series of injuries that
have kept him out of the limelight, but he has been in sparkling form
with the reserves where he has scored a handful of goals in recent
weeks.
''Simon has had a hard time of it,'' said Burns, ''but last season it
was a bit unfair that he was looked upon as some kind of saviour after a
few games. He has a long way to go yet but he has worked hard and he has
a good chance of making it.''
Burns reckons the Old Firm meeting is the ideal game to face after the
disappointment of defeat by Partick Thistle at Hampden on Tuesday when
he felt that his team played well in the first half but lost their
discipline in the second period.
Tony Mowbray and Andy Walker look unlikely to pass fitness tests this
morning but there is more optimism about two other doubtful men, Peter
Grant and Phil O'Donnell.
Rangers will have John Brown and Gordon Durie available again after
injury but have decided to leave Andy Goram's return for another day.
''It wouldn't be fair to ask him to come in for a game like this,'' said
assistant manager Archie Knox.
Knox had news of Ally McCoist, who had a minor operation on his
troublesome ankle on Thursday night. ''All being well that should be all
that will be required -- it was a tidying up exercise -- and, like
Richard Gough, who also had a small operation on a foot earlier in the
week, he could be fit to play in a couple of weeks. Both will be able to
go into the close season in a good frame of mind.''
Knox recognises that Celtic will want to go into the Scottish Cup
final on May 27 with a win over their oldest rivals but added: ''We
don't want to go into the close season with a defeat from Celtic a fresh
memory.''
He and manager Walter Smith were not happy with the performance
against Motherwell but they both know that there will be no need to lift
them for this occasion.
Motherwell who are close to securing second place have no injury
worries for their home match against Kilmarnock.

STERLING was the first victim of the decision by the Chancellor of the
Exchequer yesterday to leave interest rates unchanged in the immediate
aftermath of the Conservative Party's worst-ever showing in local
government elections in England and Wales.
Last night the City was awash with speculation that Kenneth Clarke had
ignored the advice of the Governor of the Bank of England, who is
thought to have pressed for a rise.
We shall know for sure in six weeks when the minutes of the meeting
are published. By then rates may have been raised. The two men are due
to meet on the first Wednesday of June, but emergency action cannot be
ruled out if a sterling crisis gathers momentum meantime.
The pound's trade-weighted index posted its lowest-ever level of 83.5
after lunch, despite indications that the Bank had intervened on the
foreign exchanges to smooth its decline.
In the afternoon it rallied a little to 83.6, equal to the previous
record low on April 19, but from Thursday's close it lost a hefty 0.8.
Against the dollar it gave up 2.01 cents to 1.5983 and it fell 2.14
pfennigs to DM2.1933.
So far this year sterling has lost 5.5% of its international value.
This is equivalent to lopping nearly 1.5% off base rates. The rates
rises in September, December and February have been all but negated, and
monetary policy could soon be back to square one.
City economists were dumbfounded by the decision. The publication of
the March 8 minutes, in which the two men had shown themselves to be
worried (to different degrees) about the initial phase of sterling's
relapse, and an unchanged first-quarter growth rate of 0.8% had
signalled the need for another rate hike.
It is difficult to recall a time when there was such unanimity among
the pundits about a change in monetary policy. One theory doing the
rounds last night was that the Chancellor wanted to be master in his own
house and was intent on showing that policy would not be determined by
the markets.
The more obvious explanation is that he lacked the bottle to sanction
a rise in rates within hours of his party being massacred at the polls.
Whatever the reason the decision was all the more surprising because
Clarke had hitherto followed exemplary fiscal and monetary policies.
Undoubtedly his fall from grace puts the Government's inflation target
at risk. Publication of the Bank of England's quarterly inflation report
on Thursday is a major hurdle.
In February the Bank was only able to forecast that underlying
inflation two years later would be 2.5%, the mid-point of the
Government's target range, because rates had been increased the previous
week.
The inflation outlook since then is bound to have deteriorated because
of sterling's decline, which raises the cost of imports and stokes up
inflationary pressures among manufacturing exporters.
It is difficult to see how the Bank can do otherwise than conclude
that the Government will fail in its of objective of pushing underlying
inflation back down into the bottom half of the 1% to 4% target range.
However, such a conclusion would confirm that Clarke had lost his
resolve on inflation and that he would place greater emphasis in future
policy decisions on fostering elusive feel-good factor.
Clarke, of course, denied that his decision, which he claimed was
finely balanced, had been influenced by short-term political concerns,
and took the unusual step of questioning official figures on
first-quarter gross domestic product, which he found puzzling alongside
other evidence suggesting a slowdown in the economy.
He said that the rise of 0.8% in GDP reflected strong service
industries and some special factors. He noted that retail demand and
industrial output were subdued and added that the good weather had
boosted the agriculture and construction components.
This line of argument is less than convincing. The weather was also
responsible for depressing output in the electricity and gas industries.
Consumers' expenditure seems likely to have been stronger than retail
sales and the official manufacturing figures are at odds with strong
survey evidence from the CBI. Destocking could explain the difference.
The Chancellor also played down the significance of sterling's
decline, and he argued that interest rates were near to their peak. The
latter point would have had greater validity had he bitten the bullet
and sanctioned an increase before saying it.
A much more likely outcome is that rates may now have to go up further
than necessary because Clarke chickened out. City stockbroker James
Capel has raised its forecast for the peak in rates from 9% to 9.5% as a
result of this.
* BANK of England figures show that net consumer lending fell from
#582m to #439m. Lending by banks halved to #234m, but specialist lenders
increased their share from #88m to #212m.

BRAVO the students of the RSAMD; after three excellent concerts in the
two-day Academy Now! festival we can justly call them the contemporary
music specialists of the academy. There has been a consistency of style,
confidence, and performance quality in this intensive survey that speaks
volumes for the thought and preparation (blood sweated, perhaps?) that
have gone into the concerts.
A pity so few turned out last night for the finale, which -- as have
the other concerts -- contained musical insights; not least into the two
composers under scrutiny, Luciano Berio and Harrison Birtwistle.
The bristling, pugnacious scores by which the latter is most familiar
have perhaps allowed us to forget the other side of his character. Even
in his very early Refrains and Ensembles, behind the abrasive surfaces
lies a kind of lyricism, brought out by the wind quintet under director
David Davies.
And for lyrical intensity, few could match Birtwistle in the searing
climax of his Dumb Carillon (powerful singing from Nicola-Jane Kemp);
nor for sheer sensuality, the throaty curve of soprano sax phrases that
intertwine in his erotic Love Song.
With Berio, whose hushed and beautiful O King, spellbindingly played
and sung, ended the concert, four students stepped into the spotlight in
the solo Sequenzas.
While perhaps lacking the last ounce of whiplash virtuosity, all four
-- Emma Turnbull (voice), Judith Keaney (piano), Eilis O'Sullivan
(flute) and Heather Nicoll (clarinet) gave finely-characterised
interpretations.
During Heather Nicoll's phenomenally accomplished playing of the
Clarinet Sequenza, it occurred to me that from this Academy of gifted
players there are probably four who could, with advice, put together a
performance of Messiaen's great Quartet for the End of Time. Just a
thought.

Michael Fry ferrets out what's left to interest the visitor in the
otherwise boring Belgian capital.
BRUSSELS could win a prize for the ugliest European capital. But it
has hidden charms, if rather too well hidden. At first sight it is a
dull, modern city of graceless high-rise buildings, cavernous streets,
overpasses and underpasses, rushing traffic, and social contrasts too
stark for comfort, as fat, overdressed Belgians ignore North African
beggars.
To get a better sense of it, the visitor might try to imagine how it
used to be. He can do this by popping into any bookshop for a volume of
photographs of Old Brussels, something Bruxellois love to pore over,
much like Glaswegians who similarly try to warm the memories of a
vanished past.
Look, for example, at a picture of the rue de la Loi. King Leopold II
laid it out in a straight line eastwards form the centre to the
Cinquantenaire, the park with its triumphal arch which he built, out of
his profits from the Congo, to mark the 50th anniversary of Belgian
independence.
In the photo I have it is continental in the way that generations of
British tourists liked to see their Continent, lined by trees and cafes
with awnings. There are few people about, even in those days looking
fat, but a little tram rattles along and a carriage actually raises a
small cloud of dust. In the distance the road climbs to where, lifting
themselves out of a morning mist, chariots and heroic figures posture
preposterously atop the arch.
Find today the spot where the picture was taken and a different scene
appears. The rue de la Loi is a concrete canyon stinking with exhaust
fumes, where nothing grows or could grow, with never a welcoming door,
no place to stand and stare, not unless you want to be mown down by a
honking driver. Halfway along rises on one side the Berlaymont, the old
headquarters of the European Commission, abandoned while the deadly
asbestos is taken out, and on the other the new Council of Ministers'
building, for the architecture of which ''fascist'' would be a kind
description. The roadway bucks into a tunnel, and beyond the black hole,
framed by office blocks, the figures still posture -- to what purpose,
though, when they can scarcely be seen?
Not all of Brussels is that bad, for even modernism takes time to
overwhelm a big city.
Brussels was in fact little damaged during the war, because the
Germans captured it so quickly. But the Belgians have always been a
nation of property speculators, and not much survives from before the
nineteenth century.
Most of what does is in the Grand' Place, at the heart of the original
Flemish city, surrounded by fine merchants' houses with elaborate gilded
decorations. Being unique, it is overrun by hordes of tourists, pursued
by almost as many vendors of tawdry knick-knacks. You should stay for a
few minutes letting your eye wander above the rabble to the serene
allegorical statues on the rooftops. You could meditate for a moment on
the spot where Count Egmont, leader of Flemish resistance, was executed
by the Spaniards; his fate inspired Beethoven's Third Symphony. But
there is little other reason to linger.
At no great distance lie two more old quarters. Ste Catherine and the
Petit Sablon, just as pleasing in a more modest fashion, where the
hostelries are cheaper and better, and a few foreigners are to be seen.
In Ste Catherine you can fortify yourself with lunch, best with a huge
plate of mussels, the Belgian national dish: most restaurants in this
area specialise in wonderful fish. On the way you might have passed
Brussels's most famous curiosity, the Manneken Pis, though it is hardly
worth the detour.
Scots may be more interested in a lesser-known curiosity. Turning
about northwards you can, with diligent searching, find the baroque
church of Notre Dame de Finisterre. It is a sooty little place of no
distinction, easy to miss but recognisable from the faade with a Latin
inscription in gold letters: ''Laus Tua in Fines Terrae.''
The end of the earth referred to is actually Aberdeen. The church was
built in honour of a miracle working statue of the Virgin Mary smuggled
out of the Granite City and brought here by faithful Catholics at the
time of the Reformation for fear that Protestants would desecrate it. To
judge by the plaques and plastic limbs on the walls around, it is still
working miracles. It looks to me like a good piece of late medieval
sculpture, and I have often wondered whether it was originally of
Scottish workmanship, in which case it would be a rare survival indeed.
Nobody seems able to say.
That, for me, exhausts the more venerable sights worth seeing. But
most of Brussels dates from the last century, when it expanded as the
capital of an independent country and was adorned by its rulers
accordingly. Some of this repays attention. Let us return to the
Parliament at the foot of the rue de la Loi. Opposite is a park still
called, with startling Belgian originality, Le Parc, because it was the
first in the city to be laid out. It is actually a very large square,
lined with stately classical terraces, unremarkable by the standards of
Edinburgh but by the standards of Brussels pretty good.
On the south-western corner you can pass into a smaller square, an
attractive composition with more neo-classical buildings, a church
behind an attic portico and a giant equestrian statue of Godfrey de
Bouillon, the first crusader King of Jerusalem, whom the Belgians,
slightly cheating, call one of their own. Off to the left, through the
last of the old city's gates, is the rue de Namur, a winding, amusing,
quaint little street of antique shops.
Off to the right is the remaining chief glory of Brussels, the Musee
des Beaux Arts. It houses, among many other treasures, Breughel's Fall
of Icarus, on which W H Auden wrote his poem: ''About suffering, they
were never wrong, the old masters . . .'' The more affected Anglo-Saxons
can be identified because they stand for hours gazing ecstatically at
it. I prefer some others among this magnificent collection, especially
The Massacre of the Innocents, a sixteenth-century Auschwitz, and
Breughel certainly lets you know it. Needless to say, the Flemish
masters are represented here to an extent that no other museum can
surpass.
After all that you will need dinner. Brussels is ultimately justified
by its food, French quality in Germanic quantity. The restaurants are
countless and, except round the Grand' Place, seldom disappoint. Of many
favourites, I mention one that seems to me the most authentically
Belgian, the Taverne du Passage, in a nineteenth-century shopping
gallery right in the centre. Here you can stuff yourself on hearty,
old-fashioned specialities -- smoked eel for starters, calf's head for
main course, then, if you have room, a dame blanche, a sinful concoction
of ice-cream and chocolate. The wine list is stupefying in its amplitude
and distinction.
For a post-prandial sharpener, I suggest La Mort Subite, a great bar
not far away. It sells the whole range of Belgian beers but also, for
the homesick, bottled Scottish ale. Just ask for ''une Scotch'', which
is to be distinguished from ''un Scotch'' if you prefer whisky. Should
you stay too long you may fancy a poke of chips on the way home, and one
thing that can be said in Belgium's favour is that it has proper
chippers. In fact they are better than ours, with a product altogether
crisper and less greasy. With a daud of mayonnaise on top, your Brussels
experience will be complete.

SUNDAY RACING
NICK Lees, clerk of the course at Newmarket, is bracing himself for
some of the biggest crowds the course has ever seen this weekend.
The course stages the first British classic to run on a Sunday, the
Madagans 1000 Guineas, to mark Britain's first full on and off-course
betting Sunday.
''Advance sales have been the biggest we have had and we are expecting
25,000 people on Saturday and Sunday,'' said Lees.
''I would advise people to come early to be sure of getting into the
enclosure of their choice.''
The crowd at Newmarket yesterday afternoon, the opening day of the
Madagans Festival, was expected to be around 7000.
Salisbury, the other course staging racing tomorrow, also are
anticipating a bumper crowd.
Course manager Ian Renton said: ''We are expecting a crowd in excess
of 6000. This compares with our biggest Saturday and evening racing
crowds of around 5000.
''The large number of runners on Sunday also is good news and, with
such a large crowd expected, we are urging people to arrive early.
''We have plenty to keep them amused, including the Red Devils
dropping in and an eagles and vultures show.''
Bookmakers are hoping to cash in -- both on and off course.
''All of our shops will be open from noon on Sunday,'' said Ian
Wassell, spokesman for Ladbrokes.
''Saturday is currently the busiest day of the week and with Sunday a
day when people have a lot of additional leisure time, we are very
optimistic that they will prove a great success.''
* TOMORROW'S meetings are the first of 24 such fixtures to be held on
the Sabbath throughout the year, on the Flat and over jumps.
National Hunt meetings at Cheltenham and Fontwell end this year's
Sunday programme on November 12.

ELTISH has had just one prep race for tomorrow's Kentucky Derby in the
USA but trainer Henry Cecil is not too concerned.
American trainers trainers claim Cecil is attempting the impossible,
but he is unperturbed. ''I'm not going to argue with them,'' he said.
''I don't see how they can say that.''
Describing Eltish as ''lazy'' and saying he needed his recent
Newmarket run ''to put him right,''Cecil added: ''You'd like to run
another one, but we haven't got the races.''
Cecil is more than satisfied with Eltish's draw for the first leg of
the North American Triple Crown. ''Couldn't be better,'' he said.

HERE we are at the beginning of May. So should we be thinking about
that old piece of stock market advice: ''sell in May and go away?''
The saying adds, of course, that you should return again on Leger Day.
No nonsense about putting the cash on deposit and leaving it there. This
advice was being given by old-time stockbrokers back in the days when
wealthy private investors dominated the market -- and tended to go away
for lengthy holidays in the summer leaving it to drift down through lack
of activity until round about the time of the St Leger, after which they
were a welcome feature once again.
Nowadays, the market's fate is in the hands of professional fund
managers, who not only take more modest holidays but also have deputies
to run things while they are away.
Despite this the market will still drift downwards whenever it feels
like it. So far this year, even though it has managed to creep up
overall, it has been pretty dithery, bobbing up and down in a somewhat
uncertain manner. That sort of thing does not necessarily inspire
confidence, but this may be one time when the ''sell in May'' slogan
gives bad advice.
Company earnings as a whole are forecast to grow by some 15% this year
and dividends by 11%. Earnings are not projected to keep up quite that
sort of pace next year, but they are expected to continue to improve,
with dividends increasing by around another 9%. Some companies will do
better, others will inevitably do worse.
And while nobody much, with the possible exception of Tony Blair, is
feeling very good at the moment, things are not looking too bad on the
economic front. Global strategists at broker Smith New Court are
recommending fund managers to be ''overweight'' in the UK (they have
also switched to giving Japan an ''overweight'' rating), on the grounds
that the long-awaited rally in relative performance seems to be
underway.
The UK market does appear to be accepting that a ''soft land'' for the
economy can be achieved without too much further tightening of the
monetary screw. The firm's economists say: ''Deceleration in the pace of
economic growth is now setting in.''
Peering into the crystal ball, they add that leading indicators
suggest there is ''some danger of a major weakening of demand growth
later this year''. Don't worry too much about that, however, as they
believe any such weakening should be temporary.
Looking ahead to next year, the economists say several factors are
pointing towards ''a distinct upturn in the rate of consumer spending
growth'' as 1996 progresses. We have seen that this year the economy has
been growing under the influence of healthy manufacturing and exports as
a result, at least in part, of the weakness of sterling, while the
consumer and retailing areas have been more subdued. Next year, growth
is expected to be less dependent on manufacturing and net exports
(imports are likely to increase).
They have reassuring views on inflation too. In common with a lot of
other observers, they believe the outlook for the next couple of years
is ''satisfactory''. Labour costs are set to rise, they say, but a
slowdown in the rates of growth of corporate profits and commodity
prices will act as an offset. They predict that the rate of inflation
will be around 2.75% (not including mortgage payments) at the end of
next year.
At the moment, we have the latest figures on house prices and the
April tax increase to stop us, as consumers and spenders, from feeling
good. But look at next year. A lot of us should have more money in our
pockets -- or at least the prospect of it. With the Government clearly
looking to cut taxes in the run up to the general election, Smith New
Court says its best guess is for a 1p or 2p cut in the basic rate of
income tax to be announced in the November Budget, with the prospect of
a further reduction in 1996 left dangling.
Each 1p cut in the basic rate would cost the Exchequer -- that is
leave us with the money instead of the Government taking it -- #2000m in
a full year.
Before that, this autumn in fact, members of the Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester Building Society will get around #1800m between them as a
result of the Lloyds Bank takeover. Then, on a larger scale, there is
the merger of the Halifax and Leeds building societies and the
subsequent flotation of the enlarged Halifax on the stock market. That
will give members windfall gains of nearly #10bn -- equivalent to a cut
of 5p in income tax. And even though the flotation is not likely to
happen before the first half of 1997, the prospect of such gains may
well loosen purse strings next year.
On top of all this, a lot of money in Tessa accounts will mature in
1996. In the first six months more than two million will come to the end
of their five-year term and their maturity value -- cash invested plus
interest and bonuses -- will approach #20bn. Most of that is likely to
be rolled over in Tessas or reinvested elsewhere, but experience of
human nature suggests it is pretty likely some people will use the cash
for big ticket purchases.
And while all that is going on there is also the prospect of
above-inflation increases in wages of something between 1% and 1.75%. In
addition, there is the chance of further building society mergers and/or
floatations to create more money.
But even without them, Smith New Court estimates that real personal
disposable income will show year-on-year increases of around 1.5% this
year and 3% next. So consumer spending, it suggests, could grow 3.5%
next year.
In stock market terms, that could crudely suggest that at some stage
it may be appropriate to move into consumer and retailing stocks and out
of those that are more manufacturing or export oriented.
Just when to do that ''is more questionable'', it admits.
Manufacturers and exporters seem set to continue showing relatively good
growth for at least several months. So it looks more a scene of
continuing corporate prosperity than of market drift this May.
Mark White, investment director at Flemings' Save &amp; Prosper unit trust
subsidiary, takes a positive view of the UK still -- and is even
recommending it as a ''comfortable'' place for Japanese investors to be
while the problem of the worryingly high yen gets sorted out.

Past experience indicates that any Government shareholding to protect
Scottish interests after the nuclear industry merger could prove
worthless, reports Iain Wilson
THE golden shares expected to be held by Government after the sale of
a merged Scottish Nuclear with English counterpart Nuclear Electric
could turn out to be fool's gold. History suggests the shares --
specifically designed by the State to curb company excesses after
privatisation -- are no such deterrent.
The lesson that privatisation means fewer jobs and wholesale
rationalisation, regardless of the Government retaining powers of veto,
has been cruelly underlined in Scotland in recent years.
Today, critics remain suspicious that market forces would eventually
triumph in a privatised nuclear industry -- as happened in other
industries, regardless of pledges, commitments, promises, and guarantees
made at the time of takeover.
They predict that any Scottish Office golden shareholding will prove
as much a sop as the plan to ensure the new holding company's corporate
headquarters are based north of the Border.
They point to British Petroleum's takeover of Britoil in February,
1988 as the classic example of golden shares being worthless.
In September, 1989 BP not only announced the sale of some of its new
Britoil assets but the loss of 1700 jobs, nearly 1000 of them in
Scotland. Some 970 people were to go in Aberdeen and Glasgow under a
reorganisation aimed at saving #50m a year.
By July, 1990 the Government had dispensed with its special, or
golden, share in Britoil -- effectively bringing to an end any control
of the firm. It was satisfied that all assurances at the time of sale
had been met, regardless of the job losses.
Opponents ridiculed the Tories' claim that relinquishing the golden
share and in-built guarantees was ''exceptionally good news for Scotland
for investment, expansion, and the long-term future of the oil
industry''.
They argued the Government, which had swept aside Select Committee
advice to retain the share in the public interest, should have invoked
majority voting rights and blocked commercial decelopments it did not
approve of.
In 1992, another political storm broke when BP confirmed the closure
of its Glasgow headquarters, with the loss of up to 350 jobs. Another
300 were to be transferred to new European headquarters at Dyce, near
Aberdeen.
Critics focused on assurances given at the time of the Britoil
takeover. The then BP chairman Sir Peter Walters wrote to the Permanent
Secretary to the Treasury confirming that Britoil's Glasgow office would
become the business headquarters for the combined BP/Britoil upstream
business in the UK.
Opposition MPs expressed fury at the ''flagrant breaches of
guarantees'', while the Commons Select Committee concluded BP had
complied with the letter, if not the spirit, of assurances on
employment.
One other, arguably more poignant, failure to use the share to ensure
the survival of jobs occurred around the same time: Ravenscraig.
British Steel's famous pre-privatisation pledge on saving the
Lanarkshire steelworks went out the window. There were accusations that
the Government, holding a golden share, had washed its hands of any
responsibility for Ravenscraig -- killed by the break-up of a State
monopoly even after becoming efficient.
More recently, the Government has abandoned Post Office privatisation
plans -- even after considering an option to retain a golden share which
would stop any one shareholder controlling more than 15% of the
business.
With ownership of Scottish water still to be resolved, troubles abound
-- not least, over the railways. The Government stands accused of
rescinding assurances and of exposing Scotland to catastrophic cuts in
rail services in the relentless drive to raise money and reduce public
spending.
Opposition Trade and Industry spokesman Brian Wilson said of reports
that the Government aims to maintain an interest in a sold-off nuclear
industry: ''No-one will be fooled by a golden share -- or a tartan
one.''
Mr Wilson, who asked if anyone can remember a single example of such a
share being used in the public interest, added: ''There is clearly going
to be a major window-dressing operation, but the key question is where
power or ownership will lie.
''If they lie in the public sector, then that would defeat the
Government's end of privatisation which is to raise money for tax cuts.
We will await the window dressing with scepticism.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond, who protested loud and long at the
Government's failure to use its golden share in the Britoil affair, said
last night: ''People do not need a crystal ball to know what will happen
to Scottish Nuclear. All you need to do is look at what happened to
Britoil and all the promises that were broken. Even its Glasgow offices
have been sold.
''No-one has any any confidence in Tory guarantees. They are not worth
the paper they are written on.''
Mr Bill Speirs, STUC depute secretary, said: ''On past experience, any
so-called golden share held by this Government will be made of base
metal.''
However, he suggested the controversy could prove a diversion from the
main argument that ''nuclear power must remain under public ownership
and control''.
A financial expert, involved in flotations, described the golden
shares as meaningful and powerful rights. However, he was not aware of
them ever being used.
The Government still retains these significant rights within
Scotland's electricity companies, privatised in 1991. For example,
ministers could veto takeover bids of Scottish Power and the North of
Scotland Hydro-Electric Board.
Similar controls of English electricity companies were relinquished in
March, bringing an upsurge in takeover rumours and soaring shares.
Insiders suggest the Government will retain its veto rights in the
Scottish companies. They believe the Government, acknowledging the
Scottish dimension, wants them to remain independent. Scottish Nuclear
has just lost that battle.

THIS weekend horseracing takes a historic step with the advent of
Sunday betting. It could not have got off to a better flying start than
a competitive 1000 Guineas with an open market.
More questions have been raised than answered by the appearance this
year of the main contenders reflected in the indecision of Willie Carson
who reportedly changed his mind twice in one day on whether to ride
Aqaarid or Harayir.
The Scot has finally plumped for John Dunlop's entry, but her win at
Newbury was on a modest pace which clocked a slower time than the
following race over the same distance.
Macoumba has run and won the same prep races as Criquette Head's
previous winners of this classic, but the time of her win was poor and
she may need a longer trip for her best.
I will take a sporting gamble that Frankie Dettori's mount Moonshell
can carry off the honours on her re-appearance.
She won her only race in style last year, and comes here fit after
having wintered in Dubai, from where Balanchine returned to get within a
short head of victory in this event last year.
* PRESENTING laid down his claims for the Derby with an immaculate
dismissal of his three rivals at Newmarket yesterday.
The three leading bookmaking firms clipped the colt's price to 20-1
for the Epsom classic after he strolled home 11 lengths clear of Anchor
Clever in the Newmarket Stakes.
The son of Mtoto was hardly tested, stretching away in fine style for
Frankie Dettori to register a time of 2min.2.12sec, just outside the
course record. ''The competition didn't turn out to be much, so we
needed a decent time to reassure us,'' said trainer John Gosden.
''Two furlongs out he was a bit lazy but when Frankie shook his stick
at him he stretched away.'' Presenting will test the water further for
Epsom when he tackles the Dante Stakes at York on May 17.
''He's always been our Derby horse.'' added the trainer. ''He likes
top of the ground and as long as we get that at Epsom, I'm sure he'll
handle the track. He is a big horse but he's got a lovely low action.''
Gosden left 16 horses in the Derby over the winter but may now only
have one other representative, Tamure.
The trainer has a high opinion of the Sadler's Wells colt, who is due
to contest today's Mayer Parry Conditions Stakes. Dettori completed a
notable double when Only Royale showed plenty of spirit to see off
Tikkanen by a neck in the Jockey Club Stakes.
Trainers Roger Charlton and Bill O'Gorman have been experiencing quiet
spells and both enjoyed a welcome change of fortune. O'Gorman scored his
first juvenile success of the season when Foreman came with a late
rattle to collect the NGK Spark Plugs Arlington Stakes, while Charlton
sent out Royal Rebuke to take the March Handicap.

CLYDEPORT'S controversial executive chairman John Mather, who became
an overnight millionaire when the company was floated in December, saw
his basic salary and benefits package rise 25% to #106,000 last year.
Clydeport's 1994 annual report, published yesterday, said no bonus for
1994 would be paid to Mr Mather or any other director of the company
which operates a string of privatised ports on the Clyde estuary.
The chairman's new package comprises basic pay of #98,000 and benefits
worth #8000. In addition, the company contributes #5000 each year to his
pension.
Mr Mather and managing director David Hunt were widely criticised for
making massive profits when 18 million Clydeport shares were floated on
the Stock Exchange in December.
Each director invested #75,000 in Clydeport when the Government sold
the former Clyde Ports Authority to its management and workforce for
#26m in 1992.
But two years later when Clydeport shares shot from 18p to 133p at the
floatation, each man saw his investment soar in value to nearly #5m.
Mr Mather received #1.6m of cash from selling shares at the flotation,
which boosted the value of his residual 6.8% stake to #3.7m.
Clydeport shares have since climbed to 171p, giving Mr Mather's
holding of 2.8 million shares a current market value of #4.8m.
Critics can take slight comfort from the fact that Mr Mather only got
a 25% pay rise last year after receiving a whopping 85% increase in
1993.
Labour has accused the Government of selling off Clydeport too
cheaply, allowing the company and its present directors to make
unjustified windfall profits.
Clydeport came in for further stick last month when publication of its
results for 1994 showed windfall profits on its sale of land at Braehead
to Marks &amp; Spencer and Sainsbury for the building of a shopping centre.
Exceptional profits from the #11m deal added an extra #1.45m to
Clydeport's #4.17m pre-tax profits.

PAUL Blane, 17, had a dream start as an amateur jockey yesterday when
he won on his first ride on the Flat at Hamilton.
Blane got home by a head on 33-1 shot Moonlight Calypso for a
photo-finish victory in the Bollinger Champagne Handicap.
The four-year-old filly took up the running from Daily Sport Girl
approaching the final furlong, and despite a late challenge from
Sedvicta, kept her nose in front.
Born and brought up in Hamilton, Blane moved with his family to
Preston eight years ago and now works for trainer Eric Alston tending
the gallops.
Although he has ridden in 14 point-to-point races this was his first
ride on the Flat.
Scottish Television presenter Jim Delahunt was in front of the
stewards after having finished third on Mentalasanythin.
The officials felt the six-year-old gelding had been tenderly ridden
throughout. Although the stewards accepted Delahunt's explanation they
warned him they expected to see an improvement in ''his standard of
riding.'' It was Delahunt's third ride in public.
Hugh O'Donnell, whose wife Marion owns the horse, and was representing
the trainer, Alan Bailey, told the stewards he was satisfied with
Delahunt's riding.
Tony Ives and Richard Hughes, who ride outsiders in today's 2000
Guineas at Newmarket, were successful.
Ives, who partners Zeb (66-1) this afternoon, won the Loch Striven
Auction race on La Volta (5-1), and Hughes, on Silca Blanka (150-1) in
today's main event, took the Firth of Clyde Handicap on La Suquet 6-1.
A big gamble was landed on the Newmarket-trained Voila Premiere,
backed from 12-1 to 4-1 to win the maiden race, bets of #1000 to #7000
and #700 to #5000 being landed.
Leading jockey Philip Robinson brought him late on the scene to beat
Greenland and complete a 13-1 double for Newmarket trainer Mark
Tompkins, who had earlier won the Loch Stakes with Cool Edge.

THE 2000 Guineas may be run at 3.40 this afternoon but for Celtic
Swing, it is high noon. Today we will learn whether or not he can live
up to the hype or leave the bookmakers with a thumping profit.
His performance in the Greenham Stakes was workmanlike, but when
challenged by Bahri, he did not quicken away like a champion. Lady
Herries's stable has had a disappointing run, with only two other
winners in the past month, and Celtic Swing cannot be supported at
odds-on.
Diffident offers a better value bet. He produced a powerful finish
here to overhaul Harayir, a market leader for the ''1000'' tomorrow.
Most of the attention on Andre Fabre's two entries has focussed on
Pennekamp, but Diffident completed the seven furlongs here in two
seconds faster than his stable companion on the same going in October.
Best each-way shot is Painter's Row, who won over course and distance
in the Craven Stakes, four winners of which have gone on to take the
2000 Guineas in the past decade. On a line through runner-up Montjoy, he
may have a bit in hand with Pennekamp.
Mind Games stormed home as promised at Haydock on his reappearance,
where he had more in hand than the winning margin would suggest. He can
score again in the Dubai Racing Club Stakes, in which Jack Berry has an
excellent track record with a placed entry in nearly all the recent
runnings.
Mistertopogigo is the pick of the older entries, and should have come
on for his run at Thirsk, but may not be able to see off the challenge
of his younger rival.
I like a horse that can fight back and will take Sebastian to land the
opening race from Tamure, who had everything his own way in a slow race
at Newbury.
Florid came on for his first run to come home a convincing winner at
Pontefract. He has a fitness edge over his rivals who appear for the
first time this season and should provide a banker for the last race.
* CELTIC Swing's owner, Peter Savill, was the coolest man in Newmarket
yesterday as temperatures soared into the eighties on the eve of the
''2000.''
While the Rowley Mile baked in the heatwave, Savill wasted not a bead
of sweat on today's eagerly awaited classic.
Undefeated -- and to some invincible -- Celtic Swing faces 10 rivals
in the first leg of his challenge for the Triple Crown, last achieved 25
years ago by the great Nijinsky.
Savill is expecting victory for his odds-on favourite but, with years
of experience of the highs and lows of horse racing, he admitted he has
even considered defeat.
''I've been in racing a long time. I've had a lot of set-backs and
this would be the biggest set-back probably of all time, but I'm ready
for it, if it happens,'' he said.
''My gut feeling is that he will win it but you never know. You've got
several very good horses in a very good Guineas and there are several
unbeaten horses. I learned a long time ago that unbeaten horses are good
horses until they are beaten.''
''The ground is very quick but there is no jar at the moment.''

THEY say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. But our big
insurance companies are probably feeling fearful rather than flattered
just now. On Wednesday the bruised and battered life and pensions
industry will be facing up to yet more competition, this time in the
shape of Marks &amp; Spencer, arguably Britain's best loved retailer.
Life insurers are already fighting off moves by the banks and building
societies to muscle in on their territory. The trouble is that all three
types of business are suffering from the same problem -- a growing
feeling of resentment and distrust from their existing and potential
customers.
How we love to hate our big financial institutions, grumbling about
everything from the small print they use to wriggle out of our insurance
claims to the niggling charges they try to impose for every service we
need.
More seriously, worries that both personal pensions and endowment
policies for house purchase have been over-sold on a grand scale have
led, quite rightly, to detailed investigations and a general feeling
that we may have been misled by organisations we thought we could trust.
So it is perhaps in the field of customer relations that Marks &amp;
Spencer's new life and pensions company starts with the biggest
advantage. Anyone who feels they may be bamboozled by jargon or taken
for a ride on charges is bound to take comfort from dealing with a name
they know well and feel they can trust, regardless of whether it has a
track record of investment expertise to show.
While investment performance may not matter for the basic protection
and illness plans on offer from M&amp;S, it will be vital for the savings
and pension plans it is launching -- and the evidence so far suggests
its investment managers will need to pull their socks up.
The performance of its UK Selection Portfolio unit trust, launched in
1989, has been pretty pedestrian, turning #1000 into just over #1400 in
the last five years against more than #1700 for top performing UK equity
funds. Its international fund, the Investment Portfolio, has done rather
better against other balanced international funds though.
M&amp;S is moving into the insurance battlefield without the frontline
attack of a salesforce. Its first five products are to be sold alongside
stacks of ready-to-microwave meals and oodles of underwear.
Brochures outlining the term and illness policies, 10-year savings
plan, and personal and top-up pension plans which make up the initial
M&amp;S range will be available in stores, coupled with direct mailing to
existing chargecard customers and investors.
And in true M&amp;S style, you can get your money back if you change your
mind. All the new plans include a 30-day cooling off period rather than
the 14 days required by law. Staff will be available to answer technical
questions about the policies over the phone, but they will not give any
financial advice.
''Research showed that customers did not want to be confronted by a
salesperson at all and wanted to make up their own minds,'' says M&amp;S --
which rather begs the question of whether the whole of its retail
operation might be better off going mail order.
Traditional life and pension companies who pay armies of troops to go
out and sell their wares to the public and independent financial
advisers are looking on with a mixture of fear and incredulity.
They can't quite believe that investments such as pensions and
critical illness cover can be sold over the phone. But they have also
seen the dramatic way in which Direct Line and other telephone-based
companies shook up the motor insurance market, forcing traditional
insurers to hit back with ''direct'' operations of their own.
Now some fear that the M&amp;S range, with its emphasis on simplicity and
value for money, could do the same for life insurance and pensions.
But imitation is not just a one-way affair. Earlier this week Scottish
Widows, better known for its pensions and life policies, opened up a new
banking business. ''We may be known as an insurance company, but we like
to see ourselves as an investment house,'' says David Graham, head of
marketing.
The bank has already been running the company's own cash management
and currency transactions. Now it is offering four new deposit accounts
to savers in a move designed to fend off attacks from the banks and
building societies.
''Every year some #300m worth of our policies mature,'' says Graham.
''We're now giving policyholders the chance to leave the proceeds
earning a good rate of interest while they decide what to do next.
''Recent research showed that around 80% of those interviewed felt
that they would take up to a month to decide what to do with the money,
with 20% taking even longer.''
That means another financial organisation, usually a bank or building
society, gets its hands on the money coming out of Scottish Widows'
policies and has an opportunity to sell its own range of investment
products.
The new Scottish Widows accounts can be operated by telephone (details
on 0345 829829 at local call rates) or post, and currently offer very
competitive interest rates of up to 6.9% gross on the instant access
account and 7% on the 60-day notice version. There is also a Tessa
available as well as a fixed-term account with a guaranteed rate of
return.

PENNEKAMP can spoil Celtic Swing's 2000 Guineas party and give Andre
Fabre his second victory in the colts' classic in the last three years,
following the success of Zafonic in 1993.
Celtic Swing has landed the Flat racing headlines through the winter,
and with jusification. After having run away with an Ayr maiden race on
his debut, Lady Herries' Damister colt then took a conditions race at
Ascot with similar ease.
On the strength of those two performances he was installed the
short-priced favourite for the Racing Post Mile at Doncaster, and did
not disappoint.
Always comfortable on the heels of the leaders, he was sent to the
front three furlongs out and powered clear to demolish his rivals by 12
lengths. His return, in the Greenham Stakes at Newbury, promised to
cement his claims for the classics.
However, his victory was met as much by the scratching of heads as the
dropping of jaws.
Meanwhile, Pennekamp also boasts an unbeaten record as a juvenile,
winning four times. In truth, his reappearance effort, when winning the
Prix Djebel at Evry, was also inconclusive.
But in a falsely-run race over an extended six furlongs, we could
expect fireworks and the longer trip of the Guineas is sure to suit.
There is definitely further progress to come from Pennekamp and he is
taken to lower Celtic Swing's colours, maintaining his unbeaten record
in the process.
The top sprinting honours are up for grabs and three of the likely
main protagonists -- Owington, Mistertopogigo, and Mind Games -- do
battle in the Group Three Dubai Racing Club Palace House Stakes, with
prefence going to Mind Games.

NEWMARKET may be the centre of attraction in the racing world this
weekend but there is an excellent day's National Hunt sport expected at
Haydock, even if there are no chases on the card.
Favourite backers should start the day off on the right foot with
Richard Dunwoody's mount Cadougold, trained by Martin Pipe.
He won in a canter last time out, running away from Speaker's House in
a non-handicap event at Chepstow, and could have most to fear from
Serious Danger, who clattered the second last on the way to taking a
novice race at Exeter.
Tom Dyer, the country's most northerly trainer, has a runner in
Haydock's opener, but he may not leave the Lancashire track empty
handed, as Chief Minister could pay for each-way support in the Swinton
Hurdle.
Chief Minister was well fancied to land a race at the Cheltenham
Festival, no less, but had little luck in running and eventually went
out like a light when the pace was increased.
Dangers are in plentiful supply, with Mary Reveley's Sweet Mignonette
a rightful favourite after having won the Aintree Hurdle in fine style
at the Grand National meeting.
Top-weight Home Counties was a winner at Ayr last time out, while
Nemuro, with Lee Aspell claiming 7lbs, should be there or there abouts.
If Sweet Mignonette is turned over, Reveley may not have too long to
wait to gain some recompense because her White Willow looks a cut above
this lot in the New Florida Hurdle.
The figure ''2'' before his name should not put backers off, as he got
his head in front when it mattered most last time out, at Kelso, but the
stewards later found something which displeased them, and White Willow
was disqualified.
Dick Hern runners at jump meetings are in as short supply as Tory MPs
north of the Border, and the trainer's Lankridge, ridden by Scottish
National winning jockey Rod Farrant, should be well worth waiting for in
the last.
Thirty minutes earlier, Fulke Johnson Houghton, also more accustomed
to having runner in flast races, sends Maestroso for the claiming
hurdle, and as the opposition does not add up to much, Maestroso could
strike another note for Flat handlers.
Trainer Nigel Twiston-Davies has been quite of late but that should
end with success for Gospel in the Long Distance Hurdle.

IF all his plans work out this weekend, Allan McGraw will see his
team, Greenock Morton, win the second division title today and on Monday
he will go into hospital for an operation to replace a knee joint.
In that sentence is perhaps summed up the managerial career of one of
Scotland's longest serving and, certainly, most loyal football people.
McGraw has given most of his adult life to Morton, as a player and
manager, and the walking sticks that are parked behind the desk in his
tiny room at Cappielow give testament to a greater sacrifice than any of
his contemporaries can, or would wish to, demonstrate.
Besides his consuming love for Morton and the game in general, McGraw
has a passion for using his painful experience as an example to warn
current players to be careful about subjecting their legs to
pain-killing injections.
He played on too often when he should not, and the result has been a
painful assault on his knee joints that has grown worse.
However, it would be wrong to imagine that McGraw dwells on such
matters. Pressed, he will admit that Monday will be the seventeenth
operation on his legs.
He will only go through it if the team has done him proud by beating
Dumbarton, their title rivals. ''If we don't win, I will hang on 'till
it is settled.''
He has always had strange priorities, has Allan, who has been with
Morton for 35 years, except for a four-year stint away from the
Cappielow womb. He has been 11 years in charge and is as enthusiastic
today as he was when it all began, yet this 54-year-old grandfather has
made very little money out of his remarkable dedication.
It still seems hard to believe but, in spite of all of this
commitment, there was a bunch of Morton supporters who chanted for his
dismissal near the end of last season.
The team was relegated along with four others in the reconstructed
leagues, after having finished second bottom of the first division,
maybe giving some cause for dissatisfaction, but I wonder how the
bellowers are feeling now? McGraw admits that it was a hard time, that
it hurt, but more in the case of his family than himself.
His reaction was similar to the way he took a shoulder charge in his
heyday, picking himself up and smacking the ball into the net. He is not
one to speak in riddles, and when he declared publicly that he would
resign if Morton did not win promotion in one season, you can take it he
was not kidding.
Yet now, even as it looks as if he has been proved right, Allan would
confess: ''I regret saying that now, not because of what it meant for
me, but because of the extra pressure it put on the players. If I had
thought of that at the time I would not have said it.''
If that is a typical McGraw observation, so, too, is his insistence
that the declaration remains in place. ''If we don't go up I will
resign.'' How he, his wife Jean, and the rest of the McGraw clan would
cope with life after Morton is difficult to envisage.
If there had been any manager in the country who could have been
tempted to walk away from the hassle when the troops got restless, Allan
must have been the one but it was not an option that made any appeal.
His mission has been plain in his eyes, especially since the change to
four divisions of 10. He has to get Morton out of the lower leagues
because he is convinced they will become forgotten territory.
His deep desire is to see Morton one of an 18-club top division, a
move he believes will happen soon, despite the five-year commitment to
the current set-up.
''Every year that goes by the lower leagues will be talked about less,
given less attention by the media, until, in my view, they will
disappear altogether.''
These opinions are not based on any serious worry about his own club's
financial standing. Morton, according to him, are in a better state than
most clubs in Scotland.
''We are in very little debt. In the last four years we have been in
the black, and the chairman deserves credit for that. He has tightened
up the purse strings. It means we can't spend money but that is the way
it has to be run.'' He assesses the Morton future with that brutal
honesty which characterises all his views.
''I think we could get into the premier division, stay there a couple
of years, and go down. But we would be back up again in another couple
of years, unless they change to an 18-club league.''
McGraw argues that Scottish clubs have performed poorly in Europe as a
consequence of the 10-club arrangement, apart from the first three
years. ''Since then it has been mostly a disaster in Europe for us.''
For Morton, other than when they can slip in a couple of Finnish
players, as they have done with great success this year, the future has
to be in youth and, in that context, McGraw is filled with optimism,
while acknowledging that the young lads of today are different from
their predecessors.''
To be honest, they are more sensible, more aware of the financial side
of the game. Rarely now will you get a player who will stay with one
club because he knows the money benefits that can be enjoyed by moving.
Good luck to them. It is a short life.
''What is good is that we can compete with clubs like Rangers and
Celtic for the best of the kids, because they are aware that they can
get first-team football and the chance to be seen here.
''Players who come here have always known that if they progress we
will not stand in their way.'' It is the animated McGraw, the cigar
smoke whirling above his head, who gets into full flow in these moments.
Interrupted occasionally by one or two of the very young men he talks
about, all of whom call him respectfully, ''boss,'' he soon sets off on
another football topic which gets his adrenalin flowing again.
It is that fascination with all aspects of the game that motivates
this remarkable man. Football is what makes the heart beat, the blood
flow. He admits to having had ''a bad year'' with his legs, and asks
only that the new knee joint gives him a few more years.
Has he never been tempted to pack it in and leave the hassle, physical
and mental, of running a football club behind? ''Never. It is what keeps
me young. Working with all these kids helps keep me young myself.
''In fact some of the lads think I am as daft as they are. And, right
enough, when I think of some of the antics I get up to, I must seem like
a wean.''
This is supported by one of the finest of all former Morton players,
ex-Aberdeen and Scotland star, Joe Harper, who has called in for a cup
of tea and a chat.
As the blether wears on, the smoke from Harper's fags and McGraw's
cigars in the small office leaves your correspondent able to identify
them by voice only, but it remains interesting.
''One or two of the boys you have seen here,'' said Harper, now a BBC
Scotland radio commentator, ''took him on in a bet. Allan said he would
save one penalty in 10 from each of them for a fiver. He did that and
the miserable old bugger took the money.''
McGraw, who anticipates a good game against Dumbarton, is an admirer
of their manager, Murdo MacLeod. ''He has them playing football and that
is what we want to do here. It will be tense and maybe the nerves will
affect it, but I hope it is an open game.''
In his time as manager, Morton have been in the premier division only
once and that applies also to the second division.
They are very close to fulfilling his prophecy and win promotion. The
corollary does not bear considering.
It is not possible to imagine McGraw on the outside looking in. His
love of the job is extraordinary. ''I can honestly say that never once
have I got up in the morning without looking forward to work. It's a
great job.''
Maybe he does need the game but not half as much as it needs him.

THIS weekend, while we are remembering the end of war in Europe 50
years ago and the demise of Adolf Hitler, let me tell you about a
Scottish-based company which, using technology developed in Edinburgh,
has been surveying potential secrets still buried in the earth below
Berlin's Brandenburg Gate, close to Hitler's wartime bunker.
The same company, using the same radar-inspired techniques, has also
helped the Italian authorities respond to the threat that the Leaning
Tower of Pisa might lean too far and build up such stresses that it
could explode into fragments.
And, in South Africa, Motherwell-based Rocksoil's technology is being
deployed in gold and diamond mines to pinpoint lucrative new seams. Just
after we spoke, partner Alex Boyd was flying out to Bangkok to locate
faulty cables and leaking water pipes under the main streets, without
bringing further chaos to the congested traffic by digging them up to
measure the damage.
There have been many other less exotic assignments -- survey work on
Glasgow's Kingston Bridge, analysis of walkway subsidence on the Crinan
Canal, route scanning for the proposed funicular railway in the
Cairngorms, a safety check on the Perth railway bridge after the floods,
and work on the collapsed new fast-rail link tunnel under Heathrow
Airport.
''We are only at the very beginning with this technology,'' says Boyd.
''In the past it would have taken us weeks to survey that car park out
there, drilling at metre centres, taking out samples and analysing them.
Now we can do the whole area in a day or two and only drill in one place
to confirm we've found what we're looking for. That must be the
future.''
The Brandenburg Gate contract came about because the Berlin
authorities were planning an underpass to ease congestion now that the
wall is down and traffic is flowing freely across from former West
Berlin to the east. ''They knew there were sewers and a couple of rail
lines nearby. And they were worried about unexploded wartime bombs. But
they wanted to know what else they might hit before excavation
started,'' he explains.
They knew the site of Hitler's bunker was just off to one side, but as
the Rocksoil team began radar scanning last year, they detected other,
unexplained structures. ''We found a couple of tunnels and another major
structure -- a bunker I call it -- which no-one knew anything about. We
also found a couple of unexploded bombs which have now been dug out. I
don't know whether they will simply route the underpass away from the
tunnels, or excavate them to see what they hold.''
Rocksoil was also commissioned to move to the east of the gate and
detect clusters of post-war Russian cabling which might foul up the
construction work. That reminded me of a British banker I once met in
Leipzig who, on taking over a new office in the former East Berlin just
after the wall was breached, picked up the phone to discover, to his
astonishment, that he was put straight through to a (KGB?) voice at the
other end, in Moscow.
''It was no problem. We got 26 cables in all on the radar,'' reports
Boyd, recalling that that success encouraged a Bonn government official
to inquire whether Rocksoil could detect bottles buried in a field. Alex
Boyd was told they could not walk the site and would have to do the
radar survey from the air. ''We eventually discovered that the bottles
had been buried by the Russians and contained nerve gas.''
Rocksoil was formed in 1985 by Boyd and his partner David Airlie to do
conventional site surveys, using tried and trusted drilling and core
analysis techniques. Both men had worked for GKN and both are qualified
geotechnical engineers. Boyd is also a chartered mining engineer. Their
love affair with radar which could detect objects below ground started
in the early nineties.
''We read about this company in Edinburgh which had developed a
fantastic system which could see below the ground. I said to David: 'Do
you realise what this means for our industry?' So, the next week, we
checked it out and started to use it,'' recalls Boyd.
The Edinburgh company was Geospace Consulting. Its roots were
academic. The people behind it had two major problems. While they had
developed an exciting technology by expanding the operational horizons
of radar, they were relatively weak on interpreting the data the scans
were producing. And like many academically inspired ventures, they were
short on commercial drive.
''They could fire radar waves into the ground and get all this
gobbledegook back. But what the hell did it all mean? That was the
problem,'' says Boyd. Rivals to Geospace were also developing radar
systems capable of looking under the ground. But Rocksoil's geotechnical
and geophysical engineers had the ability to turn the resulting radar
gobbledegook, through clever software, into multi-coloured computer
pictures which told the story of what was there.
The system's predictive abilities have been tested by the Health and
Safety Executive here, by asking Rocksoil to scan large concrete blocks
in which were hidden a series of reinforcing rods, other objects and
voids. ''We got everything except two rods at the top and bottom, which
were outwith the scanning range,'' Boyd reports. ''That's how we got the
Heathrow contract and from that we're hoping for a full-time contract on
the Jubilee Line.''
In the early stages of the collaboration with Geospace, Boyd remembers
trying out the evolving radar system on a buried quarry near Hamilton.
''The guy produced a drawing with a lot of squiggly lines. We said:
'What's that?' He said: 'I don't know.' So we took a JCB and excavated
the site to see what they were. They turned out to be the individual
strata lines created as each load was tipped, one after another.''
Such painstaking checking of the radar's findings against empirical
evidence helped Rocksoil's engineers and Geospace's scientists to refine
the system. ''Eventually we could tell, with confidence, what we were
seeing in each fingerprint,'' says Boyd. ''The software we've developed
is quite significant. But we've still got a long way to go. One day
we'll be able to process everything on site.''
APART from the ability to detect objects and other potential dangers
like old mineshafts without excavating or drilling, the speed of the
radar significantly reduces costs to the client. A job that might cost
between #30,000 and #50,000 by conventional drilling techniques may be
done for #3000 or #4000 by radar.
But as the collaboration with Geospace progressed it became clear the
Edinburgh group was in financial difficulties. Its main backer had
decided not to put any more money in. It was so cashed strapped, says
Boyd, that jobs were not being completed. ''It got to the stage where we
offered to buy some systems from them and do the whole thing ourselves.
They said: 'Why don't you buy the company.' We did. Last year. For
#80,000.''
Rocksoil has retained an Edinburgh base, in addition to its own HQ
just across Craigneuk Road from the entrance to the now defunct
Ravenscraig steel works. So it is appropriate that the Geospace
acquisition and ongoing radar development should have been part funded
by British Steel (Industry), alongside contributions from Lanarkshire
Development Agency and the Strathclyde Seed Capital Fund. In all this
funding totals #100,000. But that acquisition of Geospace and its radar
technology means Rocksoil will hit a turnover of #800,000 this year and
is now employing 30 people.
Rod McLaren of BS(I) says: ''Rocksoil is at the very cutting edge of
new technology and we were delighted to help them with their expansion
which has created 12 new jobs. I am confident that the company will
continue to lead the field not just in Britain, but at an international
level in the years ahead.''
The latest joint venture with a major South African corporation will
see Rocksoil software incorporated into radar technology deployed in the
gold and diamond mines there. The new software will allow anaylsis on
site, using lap-top computers. Six systems are already under test in
mines. Rocksoil is hoping for the European franchise for the new
technology when it is fully proven.
''This represents another quantum leap for the industry and I am
confident the new radar will be a tremendous success,'' says Alex Boyd.

MARTIN Jones won the six-mile forest trail race at Keilder yesterday
in 29min 11sec, to take the overall lead in the Northumberland Castles
Challenge, the six-race marathon series which carries $52,000 in
prize-money.
Spango Valley clubmates Tom Murray and Chris Robison, the former
Scottish cross country champions, finished fifth and sixth respectively
in 29-33 and 29-39.
* EDINBURGH AC will be without their Commonwealth sprinter, Doug
Walker, today when they travel to Peterborough for the opening round of
the Guardian Insurance British Athletics league match.
As EAC begin their battle to escape from the newly-created division
four -- three teams go up -- Walker will be competing in the three-day
British Universities' championships at Meadowbank. Victory in the 200m
will bring selection for the World Student Games in Japan this summer.
Haringey had hoped to have former European and world indoor 800m
champion Tom McKean in action for the first time as they bid to regain
the division one title from Thames Valley. But the Scot, who recently
became a father for the second time, is warm-weather training, in Spain,
and will not make his season debut until the end of the month.
* ABSENTEES from today's SAF development conference at Stirling
University may pay a heavy price. Only clubs which support such
initiatives will receive future resources, warns development officer
Graham Ross.
Although 30 clubs and 15 local authorities will be represented among
more than 100 delegates, that means 170 Scottish clubs have no presence
at the conference.
* CITY of Glasgow are the host club today (noon) at Crownpoint for the
opening division one match in the UK women's league, but will be without
their star 400m runner, Mel Neef.
* THE appeal hearing against a four-year doping suspension by former
Commonwealth 800m champion Diane Modahl will take place from July 24 to
28, it was confirmed yesterday by the British Athletic Federation. The
federation has apointed a three-strong panel, chaired by Robert Reid QC.
The other members are Beryl Randle (Midland Counties AA) and Gordon
Wright (Northern Counties). Reid was a member of the commission of
inquiry looking into allegations of corruption in English soccer.
* AFTER having taken advice from the Foreign Office, England have
withdrawn from the athletics match scheduled for Zagreb on June 28.

HE is Scottish, and though just 20, has already played in two
Wimbledon semi-finals. Which probably means Miles MacLagan should be
ring-fenced with barbed-wire, kept under 24-hour high-tech surveillance,
and designated a protected species.
Last weekend he realised an ambition by playing in the Davis Cup, the
first Scot to do so since John Clifton, who made a single appearance in
1970. Even if the match ended in a too-familiar story of defeat for
Britain, MacLagan acquitted himself respectably, taking a set off his
singles opponent, Karol Kucera, who was ranked 226 places higher than
him.
MacLagan's feat of reaching singles and doubles finals as a junior at
Wimbledon netted him that poisoned chalice, the accolade of being a
British player of potential.
Since then he has been granted two wild card entries to Wimbledon, and
survived the opening round as a senior, beating the World No.95 (when he
was ranked 492). He lost only to Jeremy Bates in the final of the
British indoor championships last November, having claimed the scalps of
Mark Petchey and Jamie Delgado.
The impossible dream which MacLagan dared, nurtured as a child on the
court of the family's garden in Zimbabwe, has still to be realised, but
it is beginning to take substance.
''I will be disappointed if I don't finish this year by breaking into
the top 200 in the world,'' he says.
''In the long term, if I get my share of the breaks, and don't have
any injury misfortunes, I believe I could play the ATP tour and
ultimately crack the top 50.
''What would that be worth? Possibly $200,000 -- maybe $300,000 a
year. In fact, being British, I suppose it could be quite a bit more.
Top-50 players in the US are a dime a dozen, but a rarity in Britain.''
Despite his relative success there, Wimbledon is not the Holy Grail
for MacLagan. ''I've played a lot more on clay recently, though if I get
the chance to play Wimbledon again this year, I'd concentrate on grass
for a bit.
''Many people in Britain don't realise just how much tennis there is
outside Wimbledon. It is mainly here, in the UK, that there is this
obsession about changing the rules, because of the perception that big
servers destroy the game as a spectacle.
''It is on grass where that is a big factor, and to some extent
indoors. But worldwide, the game is mainly on clay, which is slower,
providing spectacular matches.''
This week MacLagan is contesting the Lawn Tennis Association's spring
satellite tournament on the Craiglockhart clay of the refurbished
national tennis centre. Four Nations international representation for
Scotland apart, it is his first senior appearance in a Scottish event.
MacLagan owes his Scottish allegiance to his father, Ramsay, an
accountant from Paisley, and his mother, Elsie, from Keith.
'They left Scotland just over 20 years ago,'' says Miles. ''I was born
in Zambia, but lived there for just a few months. I was brought up in
Harare, until I was 13.''
He might have remained in Zimbabwe, but for a family friend, Dave
Waite. If MacLagan's career does take off, then it will owe much to
Waite, a BA pilot who tipped off the family about Bisham Abbey, the LTA
residential hothouse for talented young players.
''It would have been very difficult for me to have made it if I'd
remained in Zimbabawe, particularly given the limited access there to
foreign currency.
''My ambition, from the age of about five, was to be a tennis player.
It's maybe not a realistic one at that age, but it became more and more
serious as I got older.
''I first had a racket in my hand when I was three or four, playing on
our court. It had a sort of baked clay surface. My father played club
standard tennis, for Whitecraigs, before he left Scotland, but there is
no big tennis history in the family.
''I was always conscious that my folks were intensely patriotic --
haggis was occasionally on the menu. But in all honesty, I don't feel
particularly Scottish.
''I regard myself as British, though the Scottish LTA gave me some
grants when I first came over, and have always been extremely supportive
and helpful.
''I'd like to play the Four Nations Centenary event in Glasgow later
this year, but that will depend on the rest of my schedule.''
MacLagan has 15-year-old twin sisters, Carolyn and Suzanne, who are
still in Harare, with his parents. They play tennis only socially, and
show no inclination to follow their brother's example.
''When I left for Bisham Abbey at 13, I was overwhelmed by the
excitement and intensity of it. I didn't miss home at all. Now that I'm
home just three weeks a year, I am more aware of missing my family.
''Realistically, I have to be satisfied with my progress so far. The
last few weeks have seen me play the best tennis of my life.
''I'm fortunate that my tennis has not been a great financial burden
to my folks. When I first came to England, the LTA took care of
everything. Now I'm lucky to be staying with Dave Waite's family. All my
gear is sponsored, and I make enough to live on.
''I have no house to keep up, none of those kind of expenses. But I
always have to be careful. I'm staying in a guest house while in
Edinburgh, and I have no extravagances. I'm not into designer clothes,
expensive food, or music. I don't have a girlfriend, so I'm not always
buying presents or running up huge phone bills.
''If I want a big night out, to get away from things for a bit, I'd
reckon #30 to #40 would be splashing out for the night.''
He is convinced having done well as a junior has put no extra pressure
on him. ''Plenty of young stars never make it as seniors, after all.
''I would not say I was obsessive, but my commitment to tennis is
total. Everything in my life is geared to it. Sacrifices? Well, I didn't
have much time to make friends when I was at school. I was always going
home to practice.
''I wouldn't go to parties. I have no girlfriend now because I see it
as a disadvantage, a distraction.
''You need tunnel vision. I never go out before or during tournaments.
I will sit in and watch TV. I can't be bothered with sight-seeing,
despite all the travel. When you know you could be on court the next day
for four hours, it is better to conserve your energy.
''Perhaps when I am 50, I'll look back and regret having missed the
opportunity, but I want to give the game my best shot.
''I can live with the British public's dismissive attitude to our
recent international record, and I would certainly like to change that,
but it is not a crusade.
''The way our leading players are condemned in Britain really only
reflects how little people here know or understand the game in the first
place.''

As HM Inspector of Constabulary for Scotland, R D Kernohan saw the
dilemmas, frustrations, and successes of policing. He describes his time
as a constructive critic and candid friend
MANY of us hope to encounter the police as rarely as possible. It's
not that we have cause to dislike or fear them: far from it. But
encounters often follow what we want to avoid; road accidents, assaults,
housebreakings, car-thefts, bag-snatches, personal tragedies.
We need to know the police are there. We may not expect them to be
wonderful, but to be honest, courteous, helpful, efficient, and subject
to the rule of law they sustain.
We can't expect them to abolish crime. Human nature ensures that
thieves, fraudsters, and more violent offenders will always be with us.
Whether they will be nuisance or nightmare depends less on the police
than on values in any community. That, rather than differences in
policing, explains many differences in crime rates between and within
police-force areas. But we expect police to curb and control crime.
When we grumble about law and order -- meaning crime and disorder --
we're not usually complaining about the police, but about a state of
things to which politicians, social values, personal morality, media
attitudes, court procedures, and penal policies all contribute.
But we need to know that if we complain things will be thoroughly
investigated. We want to know that, within the community's consensus
about fighting crime and maintaining civil liberties, the police give
value for national and local expenditure. We also expect good
relationships between police and public.
That includes Ministers and other politicians, trustees of the public
interest. It includes councillors in eight police authorities. It
includes the media, who have a better relationship with the police in
Scotland than in England, though the ''Fettesgate'' affair showed it is
vital to guard against reckless behaviour or malicious damage.
But the ''public'' is composed of people who grumble one day about
parking tickets, speeding checks, noisy youngsters at the close-mouth,
even the law on Murrayfield hip flasks, but find themselves dialling 999
the next.
For the past two and a half years the police have been helping me with
inquiries.
As HM Inspector of Constabulary for Scotland, I saw the dilemmas,
frustrations, and successes of policing. This involvement of a part-time
''lay inspector'' was no substitute for expert professional inspection,
for I worked with HM Chief Inspectors (first Sir Colin Sampson, then
John Boyd) and their expert staff. It complemented a well-tried and
effective process.
There's some force in the view expressed to me in similar terms by one
of the English full-time lay inspectors subsequently appointed and a
Scottish chief constable. ''You'll be giving up the job just when you're
good at it.'' Or maybe they said: ''As you're beginning to learn it.''
But if a lay inspector is to keep freshness and perspective his time
must run out almost as soon as he's fully run in. The police way of life
creates a distinctive professional community. When the layman begins to
feel one of them he can no longer do his job as one of us. He has to be
a constructive critic and candid friend, but an outsider.
From that perspective I liked most of what I saw. I expected reserve,
even suspicion, in every rank -- and encountered virtually none.
The Scottish police service is well led. Leadership was especially
effective in sustaining morale during the difficult time after the
abrasive Sheehy Report, an object lesson in the wrong way to go about
things. The service is well motivated, recruited, and trained. It has a
wide range of skills, in the smaller forces as well as the large ones.
It has a sound concept of public service, and generally understands
the importance of legal safeguards and civil liberties -- including
vital liberties to live in freedom from fear of robbery, harassment,
vandalism, assault, and disorder.
Whatever the long-term pattern, Scotland now has a national police
service without a national force. There are arguments in favour of such
a force, not surprisingly heard most often in Strathclyde. For
Strathclyde's size, with roughly half Scotland's population and police,
means that in some things -- from internal training to media relations
-- it operates on a scale approaching a national force.
But any move to a national force would provoke distrust and suspicion
in much of Scotland. Relations are good between the present forces and
the regional communities they serve. Such relations, with ordinary
people and elected representatives, are important in efficient policing.
One priority is to sustain good relationships when, although forces
remain unchanged, local government reform involves new joint police
boards and financial structures. A second must be to strengthen the
concept of a national service provided through regional forces.
Separate forces may take over-much pride in self-sufficiency. There
are areas of concern. One is diversity of approach and policy on
information technology and computerised crime reporting systems.
Scottish Office, HM Inspectorate, and chief constables themselves are
now trying to sing in harmony, if not in unison. But it is a pity a
single system was not adopted earlier.
Another area of concern, but where improvement is visible and
continuing, has been the different extent to which ''civilian'' staff
feel themselves part of their force. (The quotes are a recognition that
we have civil police, not a gendarmerie, but the common word must
serve.) Civilian staff have vital roles. They are often the public's
first point of police contact. Local government changes should make them
more obviously part of the police.
I also wish more middle and lower-rank officers had experience of
forces other than the one they joined.
But isolationism is generally held in check. There are institutions
and arrangements which encourage the sense of being a national service
organised in distinctive forces. The most obvious and important is the
Scottish Police College at Tulliallan, not only a recruit initiation
unit but a centre for management and specialised training.
Less obvious but also important is the national perspective of the
police staff associations, including the top-brass band, the Association
of Chief Police Officers. The formal and informal arrangements by which
the chief constables co-operate with each other -- most of the time --
are vital. So too (as I can say now I'm released without charge) is HM
Inspectorate.
The police aren't perfect. Even with the best selection procedures, a
small minority will fall short of the integrity needed. A larger
minority may develop cynicism, or lose the enthusiasm of early years.
The quality of recruits now available will ensure that this remains a
problem, for not all can rise anywhere near the top. In present and
probable employment conditions the police can do much picking and
choosing. But recruit selection and career-planning policies must take
account of the need for a balanced force.
In many ways the balance is good. Modern policing is a career open to
the talents, and one able to deploy these talents in very different
ways. There are many officers with graduate or equivalent
qualifications, sometimes acquired during service.
There are two other questions of balance. One is the continuing
process of ensuring women equal opportunity in what have traditionally
been men's tasks. Women officers now share in all policing, even at its
roughest and toughest. Police middle management shows sensitivity and
common sense in handling any difficulties. But I encountered few women
in senior ranks.
At the time of the inspection I found one force had no woman officer
above sergeant. Another has just appointed a woman as a divisional
commander. The direction of change is clear but progress is uneven.
The other question is ethnic balance. Scotland's relatively small
ethnic communities encounter problems which are necessary police
concerns. Occasionally I heard criticism which seemed unfair (for police
treat crimes with a racial element very seriously), but I was glad
anxieties were expressed and police were there to listen.
It remains a pity that policing does not rate highly among career
preferences of the ablest young men and women in ethnic minorities.
But even if we had a near-perfect police force there would be
complaints, including those formally registered and investigated. A
substantial proportion come from people whose criminal or anti-social
lifestyles make it likely they will clash with the police. They have
their rights like anyone else. However, even law-abiding, peaceable
citizens may find themselves in situations giving rise to complaints.
There is a Police Complaints Authority in England. There have been
calls for something similar in Scotland. I remain unconvinced. I believe
it is unnecessary and would cause friction by overlapping with areas of
Crown Service and procurator-fiscal responsibility in the distinctive
Scottish system. It would be ponderous, expensive, and time-consuming.
But there are pressures. It would take only one or two serious police
errors, publicised in the media and compounded by unsatisfactory
investigations, to build up pressures to a point where Ministers would
come under political attack and have to consider yielding to them.
After two years' study of procedures I see both sides of the problem.
The way complaints are handled by investigating officers is usually more
satisfactory to complainers than the outcome. Complaints often arise
from situations where it's one person's word against another's. In other
cases officers who fall under suspicion and might face charges or
disciplinary proceedings have the protection of safeguards and
procedures which in vastly more numerous cases allow criminals to get
off.
We need to maintain the high standard of investigation, to realise
that bringing in outside forces is no confession of weakness or
inadequacy, and to emphasise that Scotland already has vital independent
factors in the Crown Office and procurators-fiscal when complaints raise
the possibility of criminal behaviour by officers.
It is also important that police command looks at disciplinary
implications even where no grounds for prosecution exist. This usually
happens. But it should also look at complaints procedures not just from
the angle of criminal and disciplinary proceedings but as part of good
management and the task of maximising public support.
There are pockets of hostility to the police and some areas where
active support is limited. This is inevitable in areas with a
disproportionate share of criminal families -- crime is often a family
tradition -- and a larger minority, including young people, who have
been in trouble with the law. In such areas there is distrust,
aggravated by intimidation, which limits active and visible
co-operation.
There are no glib remedies to be offered, though the police must
compare initiatives taken by various forces in operations and community
relations.
I end with warnings against naivety, complacency, and expecting too
much of the police.
It's naive to expect any conceivable amelioration of social conditions
in blighted parts of Scotland will eliminate or itself greatly reduce
crime. Crime isn't confined to these areas. There and elsewhere it is
widely practised and organised by people who prefer stealing and
cheating to work, or regard crime as a profitable hobby. Yet some of
Scotland's most sorely tried people live upright lives as the
law-abiding majority in communities plagued by professional or petty
criminals. A major police task is to provide encouragement and
reassurance as well as protection.
While unemployment and poverty encourage certain forms of crime, its
deeper causes lie in human nature. In so far as social conditions
encourage or discourage crime, they're created by the strength or
weakness of individual and community values and lifestyles.
It would also be naive to think there is a formula for
''legalisation'' of widely abused drugs to eliminate drug-related crime.
Drug habits, not drug-control laws, cause the trouble. There's a demand
and market for drugs whose individual and social ill-effects are beyond
dispute. They must be controlled, even if controls can only minimise the
damage. The drugs problem, also involving abuse of pharmaceutical drugs,
stimulates crime but provides opportunities for criminals who would turn
elsewhere if their market collapsed.
It would be complacent to regard recent falls in the level of crime,
if sustained, as decisive victories. People are rightly concerned about
violence and increased criminal use of guns. So, for obvious reasons, is
every police officer.
The level of crime remains unacceptably high and victims -- not least
of housebreaking -- are more worried about security than impressed by
statistics.
Crime statistics, like road accidents, are about people: experiences,
emotions, heartbreak. Police officers have to approach these situations
with skills and sensitivity, recognising that what they are used to is
devastating and traumatic for the people involved. They do a good job,
at times a superb one.
The final warning is against expecting too much of the police.
Policing depends not only on professionalism but on public support.
Every police officer is a public relations officer. But even adequately
supported policing is only part of the community's bid to control crime
under a rule of law which gives criminals many safeguards and
exploitable loopholes.
Much good work goes into reducing and rationalising the amount of
police time spent in court. But law demands an exacting standard of
proof and allows criminals to hope for procedural difficulties or human
errors to stave off consequences of seemingly overwhelming evidence.
Part of the cost of freedoms and safeguards is paid in diversion of
police time and energy.
Public and media opinion faces both ways. It wants ''enlightened''
policies on sentencing and bail, and realises prisons cost more than
London hotels. But it reacts angrily when prison-graduates resume
criminal careers or thugs turn out to have been on bail. It wants
generous legal aid, yet grumbles not just when an odd lawyer abuses
rules but when the system ensures every procedural opportunity is
exploited and sometimes extended.
The police operate within the framework of wider policy on law and
order, helped or handicapped by public attitudes. Sometimes attitudes
change for the better (as on drinking and driving) and their work is
made more effective. Sometimes public and media attitudes are less
helpful: as when armed robbers are treated as heroes, and shoplifting as
less than stealing.
The police are our agents and representatives. They need to be
supervised. They will get best results if they are also wholeheartedly
supported.

THE board of Wallets Marts has rejected the #1m bid made by James
Craig for the Castle Douglas Auction firm.
The decision comes nearly a fortnight after the offer to buy the
entire share capital of Wallets at #8.50 per share was made by the
Ayr-based Craig.
Wallets directors said the way ahead for was for them to continue to
operate as an independent auction mart.
Talks with Harrison &amp; Hetherington, the Carlisle firm, had been
important but operating Castle Douglas on a joint basis could only be
approved at a general meeting of shareholders.

* You often mention the dangers of having ''too many eggs in one
basket''. However, my wife and I, unlike many of your correspondents,
don't have many eggs. I have #13,000 in senior citizens' income bonds
and my wife has #6000 in these.
For convenience to have access to cash if needed, we have #2500 each
in the Debenture stock of a local firm, which I understand is not
without its risks. It pays 7.5% and we reclaim the tax deducted. My wife
usually has about a couple of hundred pounds in a building society for
access to cash. These are all our savings.
My state pension is #63 a week and my wife's only #46. At the end of
the month it is getting tight meeting all the bills. Fortunately, a few
years ago we took out an income mortgage on our house. We have #91 a
month from this, otherwise we would not manage. I am in my mid-eighties
and my wife is 75 years of age.
Should we withdraw from the Debenture stock, or leave a lesser sum
there for emergencies, as cash is not easy to withdraw from National
Savings bonds? We are back to eggs and baskets. We require the maximum
interest monthly that we can obtain, and have no capital appreciation.
I do not run a car. That is a luxury as far as I am concerned. There
must be many couples like us, just managing. Our income is less than
#8000. Income tax! I have never heard the word.
* ''Too many eggs in one basket'' is an investment nostrum applied in
the main to equity-type investments, where values can rise and fall. A
wide spread of investments reduces the risk of material loss if a bad
choice is made.
Cash investments are a different matter. Indeed, in some cases, it
pays to concentrate savings since certain accounts pay more interest the
greater the sum deposited. The danger lies in picking a duff
deposit-taker such as the failed BCCI.
Your National Savings are as risk-free an investment as it would be
possible to pick, and you are not taking chances by investing the bulk
of your money in them.
Your Debenture stock may be a different matter. You have not given us
much detail about this investment, but presumably it depends upon the
company remaining financially healthy. You should give consideration to
disposing of this investment, which we would not normally expect people
in your circumstances to hold.
There are a couple of other points you should consider. Government
stock offers a higher return than National Savings, and the tax on the
dividends can be reclaimed as you already do with your Debenture. Some
gilts can also be bought through the Post office register and then the
dividends are paid gross.
Another possibility open to you would be to consider an annuity. Given
your respective ages this would increase your income, though at the

* I am thinking of taking early retirement at 58 and moving abroad. If
I remained in the UK I would be able to draw my state pension when I
reach age 65. By leaving the country do I give up my right to this? If
not, is the pension still taxable in the UK?
* If you have made National Insurance contributions throughout your
working life you have paid for your state pension and, therefore, you
will still be entitled to it from age 65 even though you live abroad.
You should, however, check with your local Department of Social
Security office that the contributions you have paid are sufficient to
qualify for the full rate of state pension. If they are not, you may
consider topping them up to the required level by making voluntary
contributions.
With the exception of certain Government stocks which are exempt,
income arising in the UK is liable to UK tax even though you live
abroad, but you will still qualify for the normal personal tax
allowances which can be set against your UK income.
You are required to notify the Inland Revenue of your intended
departure from the UK, at which time you will be asked to complete the
appropriate forms.

THE gravy train carrying massive rewards for Scottish Television
executives who played a key role in securing the Central Scotland
franchise in 1991 ground to a halt last year.
Largely because of the cessation of franchise-related bonuses to top
brass during 1994, STV's total directors' remuneration bill was slashed
by 46%, from #1.79m to #959,000.
STV's profits plunged from #13m to #2m last year, mainly because of
its decision to bite the bullet and sell its loss-making Alternative
International employment consultancy subsidiary. Problems were also
encountered on the advertising side of the business.
Managing director Gus Macdonald received no bonus payment in respect
of 1994, having failed to meet the targets laid down by a
performance-related incentive plan set up specifically for him in
December 1992.
The 1994 accounts reveal that Mr Macdonald was paid #202,231,
excluding pension contributions and bonus payments, during the year. He
also received a bonus of #28,800 in January last year, relating to STV's
1993 performance, and permanent health insurance benefits worth #3721.
Assuming he was also the highest-paid director in 1993, Mr Macdonald
suffered a severe drop in pay last year.
The highest-paid director received a total of #371,587, including
franchise and performance-related bonuses of #175,958, in 1993.
In 1992, the highest-paid director received a franchise bonus of
#131,166, under the arrangements made by STV in 1989 to retain the
services of key personnel in the run-up to and after its bid to renew
its broadcasting licence.
Payments to directors under the scheme totalled #376,000 in 1992. In
1993, total franchise and performance-related bonuses came to #573,000.
With STV's advertising problems now resolved and its profits expected
to leap above #18m in the current year, Mr Macdonald could be set for
another windfall.
The accounts state that performance forecasts indicate that bonus
payments to Mr Macdonald will be resumed in 1995. Any bonus payment to
the managing director is capped at 30% of his annual salary and based on
achievement of annual budget, earnings per share and pre-tax profit as a
percentage of group turnover.
Mr Macdonald is probably best known for his bold gamble in securing
the Central Scotland franchise, for 10 years from January 1993, for a
mere #2000 a year. He joined Scottish Television as director of
programmes in 1985 and was appointed managing director in 1990.
STV's 1994 figures include a #2.4m loss on the disposal of Alternative
to Europe's largest outplacement company, Coutts Counselling, for a
maximium of #13.2m. The sale resulted in a #7.5m goodwill write-off.

AMERICAN biographer Barbara Leaming -- her Orson Welles is the perfect
partner for jack-of-all-arts Simon Callow's Welles bio which is at
present on sale -- can look to bestseller status for her latest book,
Katharine Hepburn.
A writer who is not in the sensation business, she has nevertheless
caused ''outrage'' among Hepburn's family and friends as well as the
offspring of Spencer Tracy and director John Ford. Ms Leaming, using
forgotten letters, describes a romance between Hepburn and the legendary
Western moviemaker Ford. She also draws a psychological conclusion which
has upset the Hepburn camp.
The chief objector is Hepburn's niece Katharine Houghton -- an actress
and playwright, she played Hepburn and Tracy's daughter in 1967's Guess
Who's Coming to Dinner -- who takes ''tremendous exception'' to
Leaming's book. Ms Houghton claims there was no ''treasure trove'' of
love letters -- just six -- between Ford and Hepburn, only two of which
she says could be called romantic.
However, Leaming had access to Hepburn and enjoyed extensive
interviews. Ms Houghton complains she did not quote her aunt enough.
Hepburn, above it all as always, has remained silent. But the book shop
tills are ringing to see what all the fuss is about.
ANNIVERSARY time: Bob Hope, who is 92 this month, will attend VE
celebrations on Monday at Oscar headquarters in Beverly Hills. Forward
planning: George Burns is 100 on January 20, 1996, and plans are on for
a two-hour tribute to be taped several months before the big day. ''You
never know what could happen,'' says Burns adding, deadpan as it were:
''I'm being paid in advance.''
NOT a sleeper: Sandra Bullock, who was well up to Speed with Keanu
Reeve in last summer's box office biggie is doing it again. Her While
You Were Sleeping is wide awake and turning into an early summer hit.
Bullock plays a subway token clerk who saves a man from a runaway train.
He's in a coma and then his brother Bill Pullman arrives. The American
critics have the movie, which is setting box office precedents, as this
year's Sleepless in Seattle.
DOCTOR in the House: the hospital TV series ER is such a sensation
that early episodes of the drama of the Chicago emergency room are being
released on video. It's a first -- the shows are in the stores before
even going to reruns. If successful the American networks may introduce
mass video ''programming''.
MAKING whoopee: Whoopi Goldberg is to star as late civil rights
activist Lori Jackson in Dangerous Evidence. That's after she completes
Bogus with Gerard Depardieu and takes care of two other movies for
Disney. Liv Tyler, 17-year-old daughter of Aerosmith's Steve Tyler, is
to star in Bernardo Bertolucci's comedy about a virgin on holiday in
Tuscany. Patrick Stewart -- Star Trek's Captain Picard -- is Prospero in
The Tempest in New York's Shakespeare-in-the-Park season.
UPWARDLY mobile actor Christian Slater is being sued for ''palimony''
by Nina Huang who claims she has lived with him since 1990.
* THE Lion King -- now the jungle king. Disney are working on an
animated musical version of Tarzan. It will follow The Hunchback of
Notre Dame, set for release next year and Hercules and The Legend of
Mulan planned for 1997. Disney have obtained the Tarzan rights from the
protective Edgar Rice Burroughs' estate.
* IT may have been beaten to the Best Picture Oscar, but Pulp Fiction
has won the Edgar -- the Mystery Writers of America award. Robbie
Coltrane's Cracker won best television show.
* IT'S nervy time for Mel Gibson's William Wallace epic Braveheart.
Studio officials are nervous that the film is at present turning at two
hours and 50 minutes. They're asking producer/director/star McMel for a
trim.
* FRANK Sinatra is having trouble selling his Californian desert ranch
for $4.9m. But now it's being offered furnished. Now included are the
his and her master bedroom suites and Ol Blue Eyes's message table . . .
* AMERICA will dominate the competitor's list at the Cannes Film
Festival (May 17-28) with a string of movies including Tim Burton's Ed
Wood, the wonderful, quirky movie which gained veteran Martin Landau a
Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Bela Lugosi. Title star
Johnny Depp will also be seen in director Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man, a
Western in which he co-stars with Robert Mitchum. No-Yank prize chances
include Britain's The Madness of King George.

GRAMPIAN Television has increased its holding in Scot FM to 95% after
buying Border Television's 37% stake.
The Aberdeen-based television company paid #245,000 to buy Border's
share in Central Scotland Radio, which broadcasts as Scot FM in the
Central Belt from studios in Edinburgh and Glasgow.
The move follows figures last week that showed a 77% rise in Scot FM's
listening figures in the past three months with a weekly audience of
349,000.

YOU can't keep a good salesman down. Gerard Eadie as we all know is
into double glazing, but one of his less well-known pastimes is
falconry.
You might wonder how you can mix double glazing with falconry, but he
has succeeded.
The boss of CR Smith took it up as a hobby two years ago and now owns
Lands of Finderlie, the corporate hospitality company which offers
falconry days out in Scotland.
The company has one of the biggest collections of hunting birds in
Europe including a number of Harris hawks and a young baby owl called
Agro, which like babies of other species makes a lot of noise.
In fact, you could say the fluffy little owl was causing a lot of agro
among the neighbouring Harris hawks, and something had to be done.
Not known for missing a sales opportunity, CR Smith soon sold Adrian
Hallgarth, the head falconer at Lands of Finderlie, a Lorimer double
glazed window -- which is not only draught proof but also sound proof --
for Agro's house.
Mystery of room
with a view
VISITORS to WM Company's headquarters at Crewe Toll on the north side
of Edinburgh should not be surprised if they see staff gazing forlornly
out of the windows.
The employees concerned have probably been admiring the company's new
corporate brochure, which is illustrated with shots of WM staff working
alongside windows through which can be seen the Eiffel Tower or New
York-style skyscrapers.
Oh, if only it were true, they must be thinking as they glance at the
large roundabout outside their window and the busy petrol station across
the road.
To comfort their head office staff, no doubt WM bosses will say the
brochure is designed to illustrate that it is a worldwide company, which
has offices in New York, Toronto, Frankfurt and Amsterdam where the
views are rather different.
However, that does not quite explain the presence of the Eiffel
Tower..
Lone male has
a good lunch
SCOTLAND Today presenter Angus Simpson was a brave man when he ''
attended a lunch at the Moat House International Hotel recently -- 300
women were enjoying a meal to raise funds for the Prince and Princess of
Wales Hospice.
He was the only male, and the other guest speakers at the annual event
were fellow television presenters Kaye Adams and Shereen Nanjiani.
Other top table guests included High Road stars Gwyneth Guthrie,
better known as Mrs Mack, and Mary Riggans, who plays man-mad Effie. The
latter was spotted sidling up to him, but we are assured he managed to
escape unscathed.
He admitted he had been in a state of trepidation beforehand, but his
speech -- which highlighted his twin dislikes of golf and shopping --
was well received.
He told Business Diary: ''At least I didn't have to queue for the loo
and it raised money for a good cause.''
Embarrassing
sip of the tongue
YOU can take a White Horse anywhere, but some Scotch whisky brands run
into unexpected problems with overseas marketing.
The Bennachie single malt, distilled at Inverurie in Aberdeenshire,
has caused a sexual scandal in China, where whisky tipplers tended to
pronounce its name as ''Ben-achee''.
''We found that in Chinese ''ben' means black and ''chee' means a
certain part of the female anatomy,'' Bennachie managing director Euan
Shand explained delicately.
Mr Shand, whose business cards are conveniently printed in both
English and Chinese, is now trying to promote his mouth-watering spirit
in the Far East as ''benner-hee'.
Asked what the Gaelic-sounding name Bennachie really meant, he told
Business Diary candidly: ''I haven't a clue.''
Poised for Scots
war of words
WHO will win the battle for the headlines next Friday when Prime
Minister John Major and Labour leader Tony Blair rise to speak at almost
the same time? Both will be in Scotland, with Major addressing the
Scottish Conservative Party's conference in Glasgow and Blair addressing
the British Chambers of Commerce Towards the Millenium conference in
Aberdeen.
While Major will be talking to the converted, Blair will be trying to
convert his 500 strong audience from business and commerce to Labour's
cause.
The Aberdeen event has an impressive list of speakers with Michael
Portillo addressing the pre-conference dinner. Other speakers include
Eddie George, Governor of the Bank of England, and John Monks, general
secretary of the TUC.
English may be
dumbstruck
THE Tron Theatre's production of Dumbstruck, starring Elaine C Smith,
ends its short run at the King's in Glasgow tonight and heads to the
Lyric in Hammersmith for a month-long stint.
The London production of the farce is being supported by solicitor
McGrigor Donald, which opened an office in London six years ago and is
delighted to encourage some Scottish humour down in the South-east.
Neil Scott, managing partner of McGrigor Donald, told me: ''We will be
taking along a number of our London clients to see the show, and will
help to provide any translation they may require.''
Peddling a
joke too far
IAN Spinney of the Glasgow Cycling Campaign told Business Diary he was
delighted with the response from the Glasgow Development Agency and
Scottish Enterprise who have agreed to raise the issue of a
bike-friendly policy with their staff.
Such policies, according to the campaign, do not only include making
space available to park bikes but also considering offering staff a bike
allowance in much the same way they have car allowances.
Certainly when we approached Denny MacGee, the press manager of
Glasgow Development Agency, we found him in a cycling mode, assuring us
on this occasion we could refer to him as a ''spokesperson''.
He wondered why we were ''saddling'' him with such a query, suggested
perhaps we should put a ''brake'' on this story and advised us not to
''peddle'' to many puns when it came to writing it.
In answer to the howls of protest from our end of the phone, he asked
if we were ''getting tyred of the conversation''.
By this juncture (or should that be puncture?) we had forgotten what
our original query was, thanked him for his ''tyreless'' efforts on
behalf of all cyclists and suggested that he got on his bike.

THE most telling evidence yet of woolly sheep loose in the top pasture
was the choice of France for a holiday while pregnant . . . to the place
where oozy soft cheeses slither off the fromage counter, where pates
rough and smooth and rillettes soggy with animal fats and bursting with
taste sit up and beg to go home with you, where chilled burgundy and
deep dark rich red wines simply hurl themselves into the wire basket as
you browse the bleach shelves in the supermarket . . . at the height of
a listeria scare.
Funny how you always want most that which you can't have.
But, like the good, responsible, deprived, mother-to-be that guilt and
dirty looks induce, the consequences of giving in to the cravings rose
up to shriek listeria in my ear: when errant fingers strayed too near
the leavings on the dinner plates, dire warnings about meningitis and
miscarriage and encephalitis and the fear of leaving the two-year-old
motherless, all for the sake of a nibble of pate de fois canard, forced
them into the sign of the cross that fends off Dracula instead.
(Interesting, I thought, but probably irrelevant to note, that
listeria rhymes with hysteria, a fact which some earnest semiologist
could doubtless decode.)
Strange, as Michael Ball sadly never tires of droning, how Time
Changes Everything. Then, four years back, listeriosis was the big
health risk of the fleeting moment: those dirty froggies importing their
filthy bacteria-ridden cheeses. Shouldn't be allowed. Let them eat
sweaty orange cheddar. So I did. Because I was pregnant. It was not only
my health that might be at risk by a forkful of gooey Camembert. There's
no informed choice for the unborn.
But soon, as with all food-and-drink scare stories, everybody forgot
all about the health warnings. Now, once again, listeria is back in the
news because a fridge full of Lanark Blue is at the centre of a farcical
wrangle that has shaped up as the slapstick version of David and
Goliath.
It is no joke for Humphrey Errington and his condemned consignment of
Lanark Blue, the subject of a recent cheesenapping bid by Clydesdale
District Council's environmental health department. The argument over
what constitutes an acceptable level of listeria will move into a
preposterously ponderous and filthy expensive court of law.
This time, though, the torrents of suspicion have been bursting out of
the troubled faces of civil libertarians. They argue that something as
untouchably precious to human existence as the right to have your
listeria risk induced by a slice of Lanark Blue is a matter of deep
epicurean principle.
The connotations are fascinating: the health fascists are coming to
get you, they hiss. But hang on.
It's easy and cheap to mock, not that this should stop us, but it
seems that environmental health officers can't win. It is, to be sure,
infinitely preferable to have your listeriosis delivered by an exquisite
cheese to having it slung on a mouldy roll by the vendor of a hotdog in
the fairground car park.
But what if the vilified environmental health officers were to pass up
the chance to prosecute the purveyors of hamburgers or chicken nuggets
sizzling with salmonella because they were tasty? They would be rightly
accused of jeopardising public health.
Me, I'm thrawn. Impertinent busybodies skulking in the bureacractic
lobby telling me what I ought to eat or drink to ensure longevity
extends to being holed up in a private nursing home as a dribbling
nonogenarian make me feel it is a civic duty to fill the message bag
with Lanark Blue immediately.
It also strikes me that the middle-classes -- of which I concede I've
become a full paid-up if wobbly member -- is a section of society which
constantly defines liberty as the preservation of its own interests. It
wants to have its soft cheese and eat it because, simply, it weighs the
risk against enjoyment.
What if the same rationale were to be applied to the produce of grimy
restaurant kitchens or grubby sandwich bars? Nope, if this argument were
a carrier bag it would shed all the shopping about two yards beyond
Harrods foodhall.
That said, I wish environmental health officers would set their sights
a bit lower than the cheese board: down, say, to the level of pavements.
There they would find ample evidence of a major social menace with its
attendant health risks perpetrated daily.
Perhaps they should forget the cheesemaker's kitchen and concentrate
on the dogshit instead.

OVER the past 10 years we've had fairly regular jaunts away together
for beer, golf, fried food, beer and banter. A lads' weekend is the
ideal way to escape worries like World Hunger, The Demise and
Resurrection of Spangles, The Downfall of the USSR, and Personal
Hygiene.
Our format is pretty consistent, and the reason it stays the same is
that it works. On the few occasions partners or children were allowed,
it wasn't a total success. Women can't understand the need to watch the
''Biggus Dickus'' sketch from The Life Of Brian four times at 2am.
Children understand the need all too well, but they ruin it by asking
too many questions. ''What does 'Fwow him to the fwow' mean, Daddy?''
Some of my all-time favourite memories involve, for instance, the
weekend in Lendalfoot to celebrate the beginning of the 1990 World Cup.
What a weekend! Admittedly, we would have had as much fun celebrating
the Ayrshire Roller-Lacrosse Championships, but I'll always treasure the
memory none the less. I've known since then that no matter how old I
got, I would always appreciate my short Barbarians' Breaks at the
seaside.
The most recent one had all the ingredients necessary for a classic.
The sun was shining from the start, everyone turned up, and we had
accumulated enough beer to satisfy a diabetic rugby team on a tour of
the tropics.
The stimulus to group together this time was Big Dave's imminent
marriage and emigration to Australia. The area he is moving to is in New
South Wales, which is as big a cultural desert as the original, but with
slightly more sunshine. As has been said, ''Coatbridge doesn't become
Florida just because it's stopped raining!''
For someone like me who views a trip to Edinburgh with concern,
Australia is an impossible destination. For those fair-haired,
milky-white skinned people like Big Davie, who need their Nivea just to
read a Thompson's brochure, it could be construed as a crazy thing to
do. But we were determined to celebrate in the way that we knew best,
and give BD a real man's send off.
In the past few years the average stag ''do'' has evolved
dramatically. For a start, it's now safely removed from the wedding
itself. The phrase ''stag night'' is now a misnomer, as most take up a
weekend, probably because it tends to inhibit the best man's traditional
impulse to pack the stuporous groom naked into the guards' van of
Friday's 2300hrs Bristol express. Our weekend was to most eyes probably
too tame. No-one got soaked in beer, hospitalised, painted with
creosote, or parcelled up and sent to Khartoum.
The stag celebrations began on Friday night with Big Dave cooking a
traditional spaghetti bolognese (or Spag Bol as it was apparently to be
known). It tasted great, but there were more than a few of us who felt a
bit queasy on Saturday morning, so we wondered if the meat had been
properly cooked.
As Stag Night Fever set in, out came the Trivial Pursuits board. The
music quiz CD is the best thing for starting an argument I always find,
so as the dinner was finishing, that was the first thing we wanted.
There are two types of people who play Trivial Pursuits (Triv Pur?),
those who are winning, and those who are losing.
Losing people sit and complain that the winners are taking it too
seriously, while sabotaging the game, and disallowing answers for stupid
reasons. ''No, it's 'T'aint what you do . . .' rather than 'It ain't
what you do . . .' Winning players know that they're on a sticky wicket.
If they keep getting things right, then they're sad, pathetic, anally
retentive gits: getting things wrong deliberately is, however, truly a
sad, pathetic, worthless thing to do.
The rule is ''You can win, but you can't Win''. It says something,
about the power of alcohol, however, that the chart position reached by
Steeleye Span's All Around My Hat reaches the status of a point of
principle after more than three cans of beer.
For those of us with children, sleep beyond eight is, like caviar, a
luxury that's just too rich to stomach. Seven-thirty found me lying wide
awake, not quite feeling 100%. Golf is an essential part of our lads'
weekends. There's no point in having a hangover if you can't be up
unfeasibly early to realise it.
The first six holes were fine, but then I think we all sobered up a
bit. Getting a drive to stay on the fairway is easy for the
professionals. I'd like to see Greg Norman keep a drive on the fairway
when his only sensations are of continuously flashing lights and waves
of nausea crashing down on the shores of his consciousness. That's what
I call a champion.
Admittedly, Girvan isn't the most picturesque or challenging of
courses, but the past 10 years have seen us there so often that the
course is looked on with the same affection that R and A members reserve
for St Andrews. At Girvan, every hole has, for us, an anecdote attached,
and every round produces another story. Anyway, in that state, I don't
want ''challenging'' from a golf course, I'd rather have a bottle of
cold liquid.
Saturday night, remembering the headache that home-made food can
cause, we decided to eat out. We went to a nearby restaurant in
Ballantrae, and had a great meal. It wasn't until the house band started
playing their own covers of 1980s hits that I realised how difficult it
is to sing like Tina Turner when you've got a broad Scots accent.
In their favour, they were a big improvement on the hotel soundtrack,
featuring rock classics like Nobody's Child. As the singer missed the
high note in ''What's love got to do with it, but?'', we made our
excuses and left. Soon we arrived at the Queen's Arms in Colmonell, the
kind of place that, unlike sunshine, does make Coatbridge look like
Florida. We stayed there until the small hours doing macho pub things:
talking football, playing pool, and breaking wind loudly. It was some
night.
As I hurried up the road, I realised how much of an abomination it
would be to have women or children at a stag weekend: they're too much
of a civilising influence, and would only make us realise how empty,
banal, and hackneyed drunken male banter is.

THERE is, according to the mysterious voice which opens The Outer
Limits, nothing wrong with your television set. There is also, according
to the mysterious voice writing this story, nothing new under the sun.
The American networks, in their infinite wisdom, have deemed that
science-fiction is the Next Big Thing. Hence the strange shape of things
to come on a Monday night on BBC2.
There is, however, a strong element of deja vu with The Outer Limits.
This is only to be expected since we have been here before. In another
life. It is a case of what goes around comes around. And it rather begs
the question -- can't they boldly go where no man has gone before? The
answer, sadly, would appear to be a resounding ''no''. Beam me up,
Scotty. And come back Blake Seven, Space 1999, and even Fireball XL5
because all is forgiven.
People of an indeterminate age will recall that in the early sixties,
those faraway days of Wagon Train, Perry Mason, and 77 Sunset Strip, our
TV screens suddenly went a little haywire. We had this desire to adjust
our sets (or switch channels, at least). The first series of The Outer
Limits was breakthrough television. Watch it today and it all looks a
little embarrassing with its monochrome finish and its see-the-join
special effects. But at the time it was out there on the cutting edge
(though, to be honest, the scissors weren't very sharp).
It was odd, it was spooky, and, above all else, it was new. What it
was not was normal. For starters, it broke the mould. In the sixties
American drama, whether it be Westerns or detectives (the two prevailing
genres of the time), were formulaic. The same characters appeared every
week; only the storyline changed.
The Outer Limits was different because it featured a completely new
cast for each episode. The stories too made a refreshing change. One
week it could be aliens from Mars and the next it could be mad
scientists on Earth. But perhaps the most unusual aspect about the
programme was the fact that it broke the golden rule of the day -- it
didn't need to have a feelgood ending. Its conclusion was often
downbeat. Sometimes it even left you guessing.
Until The Outer Limits appeared, science fiction had been an abject
failure on television. The big studios had given it their best shots in
the fifties with a woeful series of obscure Dan Dare-type adventure
serials which, mercifully, never made it to our screens. Then came the
legendary Rod Sterling's Twilight Zone series, essentially macabre tales
of fantasy and the unexpected but which occasionally wandered into
science-fiction territory.
Someone in Hollywood clearly saw the potential of sci-fi and decided
to devote a series to the subject. Pompous early publicity for the first
Outer Limits promised a series in which each episode would ''begin with
a scientific fact. That fact is dramatised, illumined, projected into
the future, and developed into a highly imaginative yet believable
adventure. The swift developments in space, electronics, 'miracle'
medicine, and atomics provide fresh stimuli for the creative
dramatist.'' Hollywood Studio Publicist Swallows Chambers' Dictionary
Horror!
And what we got was a series of the gloriously absurd. A gang of
mystery mushrooms consuming a spaceship; moondust which transformed
itself into a terrifying monster; tumbleweed attacking tourists. H G
Wells eat your heart out.
Apparently, what was true then is even more so today. The son of that
aforementioned ''someone in Hollywood who saw the potential of sci-fi
and decided to devote a series to the subject'' has taken a leaf out of
his old man's book. You could call it Outer Limits II -- The Nightmare
Continues. In glorious colour and with spectacular special effects, we
now have . . . well, a pretty average American import to be honest. If
you missed last week's somewhat disappointing opening episode you can
judge for yourself on Monday Bank Holiday when BBC2 shows a
feature-length episode.
Entitled Sandkings, it's a quite ludicrous tale about mysterious
scorpion-like creatures which a mad scientist nurtures when they're
brought to Earth from Mars. Not even the presence of three generations
of the Bridges family (Lloyd, Beau, and Dylan) can save this one from
the turkey zone.
The sad truth is that the new, improved, Outer Limits is but a pale
shadow of its former self -- and represents a panic attack by BBC2 as it
tries desperately to find a hit cult show to (temporarily) replace The X
Files (Sky One, Tuesday). The big problem is that nothing could ever
replace The X Files.
Unfortunately, those of us who are still dependent upon terrestrial
television must somehow find the patience to wait through a long hot
summer for the new adventures of Mulder and Scully, the best screen
partnership since Astaire and Rogers.
The first series on BBC2 attracted around eight million viewers a week
(making it easily the station's most popular show; ever). Then Sky One
had the presence of mind to grab the second series (which is currently
attracting an audience of less than one million!).
It will be the autumn before BBC2 gets the chance to broadcast it.
Indeed, The X Files is one of the few good reasons a chap could have for
buying a satellite dish.
In America, The Outer Limits was an attempt to capitalise upon the
success of The X Files as the big studios saw a window of opportunity
for sci-fi shows. More (and worse) will inevitably follow. But The X
Files, created by Chris Carter, a former screenwriter for the Disney
Organisation, is different class television. It has become required
viewing for the hip generation in almost 60 countries worldwide. It is
classy. It is stylish. It is good. You don't have to wear an anorak and
subscribe to the Internet to enjoy it. You don't have to have a video
collection of every Star Trek episode, a scale model of the Starship
Enterprise, and a working knowledge of the Klingon language, to
appreciate it. The X Files is sci-fi for normal people. Strange to think
that it comes from the same television industry which has inflicted
Baywatch upon the world. In its own sweet way, it serves to restore your
faith in little Hollywood.
It's up there with Cheers and Hill Street Blues and Twin Peaks as
classic American television. The storylines twist and turn like snakes
on speed but they never lose you in the telling. The whole thing is
quite brilliant to watch. And, what's more, it's not really science
fiction. It is, a bit. But it's beyond that. The beauty is that, thanks
to the format, it can be whatever it wants to be. It can be a
straightforward crime story, a murder mystery, a ghost story, an aliens
story.
For those viewers shortsighted enough to have missed the first series
(and, goodness knows, my reviewer colleague Ian Bell has given you a
step to a hint often enough) The X Files features Mulder and Scully
(David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson, who gel together like aspic), two
thoroughly engaging FBI agents attached to the Violent Crimes Section.
Somehow their investigations always lead them to the eponymous X Files,
weird cases which all have an unexplainable element to them.
It is a programme which -- and this is highly unusual for an American
series -- is not afraid to have a high body count. According to the
makers, no less than 125 people have been bumped off in the short
history of the The X Files to date. It also taps in to America's
paranoia about The Great Conspiracy. Always, lurking in the background,
is the fear and the suspicion that it's all some wicked,
Government-inspired, master plan designed to bury the truth which, as
regular viewers will confirm, is out there.
Next up on the sci-fi front is another American import, VR5, which
BBC2 will be showing later this year. Tapping into the current vogue for
computers and the Internet, it involves telephone lines and virtual
reality. Two things are certain about it. It won't be as good as The X
Files and it can't be as bad as The Outer Limits.
THE late and (until now) unlamented Edward D. Wood was arguably the
worst Hollywood director ever. However, thanks largely to the current
success of the eponymous bio-pic (directed by Tim Burton and starring
Johnny Depp as Wood and an Oscar-winning Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi),
he is the latest target for the revisionist theory. His movies are being
reissued on video, there's a retrospective of his work at the NFT, and
tonight he's the subject of a documentary, Look Back In Angora (BBC2).
Ed Wood's movies -- he made six in all -- truly were awful, laughably
awful. There were two glaringly obvious reasons for this. The first was
the fact that he was utterly devoid of talent; he couldn't direct to
save his life. He was the Ford Edsel of the movie industry. The second
was his innate inability to raise cash to make his films. The result was
a series of bizarre flops, cheap Sellotape jobs, which gave a bad name
to the term ''B-movie''.
But the most interesting thing about the weird Wood was the fact that
he was a raging transvestite with a thing for fluffy Angora jumpers. It
is said that, while serving in the Marine Corps during the war, he
bravely went into battle wearing a bra and panties under his uniform.
Tonight's documentary will be followed by Wood's movie, Glen Or Glenda?,
which, as its name suggests, is about a cross-dresser. It is an absolute
hoot.
FOR a mercifully short period in the mid-seventies, Britain's shiny
happy people wore loon pants, platform shoes, and shirts-and-ties to
match. Looking back, glamrock was a classic case of all that glittered
not being gold (actually, most of it was silver). Pop music reached an
all-time low with chart hits for Slade, Sweet, Mud, Suzi Quatro,
Wizzard, the Bay City Rollers, and Gary Glitter (not to mention Abba and
the Osmonds).
Now, for some inexplicable reason, Channel Four has decided to ''pay
homage'' (sic) to a time which is frankly best forgotten with a series
of programmes on Bank Holiday Monday celebrating the music and the pop
icons of the seventies. If anything is going to drive you to the VE-Day
celebrations on BBC1 then this will.
The glittering array of programmes include Abba the Movie and Abba the
Concert (which suggests GBH of the ear in stereo); The Glam Top Ten
(hosted by Alan Freeman and Tony Blackburn); Glam-O-Rama (a seventies
trivia quiz show hosted by comedian Jack Dee); and Remember Me This Way
(a documentary with concert footage from Gary Glitter).
THOUGH it owes an enormous debt to McCloud (which, in turn, owes an
enormous debt to Coogan's Bluff), the offbeat and slightly whacky comedy
adventure, Due South (BBC1, Tuesday), offers a refreshing variation on
the cop show theme. Benton Fraser (Paul Gross) is a Canadian Mountie,
right down to the crimson tunic and the pokey hat.
On the trail of the American gangsters who murdered his father, the
whiter-than-white Fraser gets himself transferred from a remote outpost
in the Rockies to the Canadian Consulate in Chicago. There he teams up
with street-wise city cop Ray Vecchio (David Marchiano).
The series, which was a big hit in America, has already been shown on
Sky. The opening feature-length episode, which is pretty much a scene
setter, looks promising. Due South could just turn out to be the ''cult
hit'' of the summer.

AS USUAL the politicians, sight-unseen, condemned the film. Although
it is set in the late 1980s when violence at football grounds was a
major problem, Philip Davis' film, i.d., has acquired fresh topicality
as violence has returned to the game.
Set in East London, the film is about how a squad of four policemen go
undercover to try to discover who is behind the thuggery at games played
by the local team, Shadwell, and how one of the coppers, played by Reece
Dinsdale, becomes what he is trying to help eradicate. It is a study in
the moral and psychological decline of a man who discovers his true
nature is as a perpetrator of violence.
Produced by Sally Hibbin, Ken Loach's long-time collaborator, i.d. is
a powerful piece of work. For Hibbin one of the interesting things about
making it had been going from producing Loach's Ladybird, Ladybird, a
film about a victim of violence, to producing one about people who
perpetrated it.
''The film will not encourage violence on the terraces,'' she said.
''I think its moral position is clear and it is very anti-violence. You
cannot accuse it of trying to glorify violence and those politicians who
have criticised it have not seen the film. Until they do anything they
say is worthless.
''The story, set in 1988, before the Taylor Report, is about a man who
becomes the thing he pretends to be, not just about football
hooliganism, although hopefully it will provide a forum for discussion
about how such things happen.''
Although real fans have provided the crowds for the scenes at football
matches -- the film never shows the game, concentrating instead on the
by-play on the terraces -- she made clear none of the fighting between
rival fans was done by the real-life supporters, but by stuntmen. The
fans were drawn from Bradford and Rotherham, clubs whose grounds were
used in the film to represent the fictional Shadwell.
Only one real football crowd is seen in a shot when the undercover
policeman, embroiled in violence at a game -- he and some thugs have
gone in among the rival fans -- is frogmarched along the side of the
pitch by police to be reunited with his cheering chums in their pen.
As to how accurate a picture is presented of how the police tackle
such operations and of the football thugs, she said they had shown it to
some policemen who had recognised the reality. But the film was fiction
and it did represent a situation which no longer existed. Policing
techniques had changed and clubs often relied now on stewards to control
fans.
''The existence of actual cases of police infiltration of football
gangs provided a rather interesting background to the issues we were
interested in exploring, but the film is in no way meant to reflect real
life events,'' she added. ''In many way, although the height of the
football hooligan period is over, i.d. is still relevant because street
gangs still exist and, although they may operate in different ways, the
film has a resonance with what life is like today.''

At 25, French-born Julie Delpy, star of the romantic film Before
Sunrise, has the world of cinema at her feet. But as William Russell
finds, mere romance has not turned a shrewd head
JULIE Delpy is the kind of ice cool blonde whom Hitchock would have
hired on the spot. She is also a lady with a mind of her own who chain
smokes and clearly does not suffer fools gladly. Her latest film, Before
Sunrise, which won the Silver Bear at Berlin, is a charming romantic
fantasy directed by the American, Richard Linklater.
She plays a French girl who meets a young American student (Ethan
Hawke) on a train to Vienna. He enjoys their conversation so much that,
having 24 hours to fill before his flight home, that, on the spur of the
moment he persuades her to break her journey -- she is travelling to
Paris -- and spend the time with him.
They wander round Vienna's tourist sights and talk about this, that
and the meaning of life all night long. Next morning, before they part,
never to meet again, they suddenly decide to meet in six months time and
find out whether their friendship has a future.
The film leaves the question open. The sophisticated Delpy, however,
leaves little doubt that in real life the chances of her breaking a
journey to spend time with a Californian dork like Hawke are remote. But
the resulting ambiguous chemistry between the two stars adds to its
charm and means, when they debate the possibility of having sex and
decide not to risk spoiling the romantic friendship, it rings true.
Why did the girl agree to get off the train with a stranger? ''He is a
kid, he is OK, he does not look very dangerous,'' she said. ''That is
the main thing. Make sure he is not dangerous. If I was attracted to
someone who had some kind of dangerous side I do not think I would get
off the train.''
I remarked on the fact that, unusually for a film today, the
relationship does not lead to sex. Getting one's kit off is a hazard
actors regularly face in the 1990s. She seemed surprised at this
assumption. ''I thought they did have sex,'' she said. ''You don't know
what happens in the park at night. The film skips a lot in the scenes
there. Suddenly they are kissing, then walking around and the sun is
up.''
She reckoned the couple would meet again. The girl would certainly
turn up at the rendezvous since, she pointed out with Gallic
practicality, Vienna was not that far to go from Paris. ''I am sure they
will both come back, get married and have dozens of children -- and
maybe I would do the sequel,'' she added.
Julie Delpy, an actress since she was 14, wants to act in English
language films and has so far clocked up Killing Zoe and The Three
Musketeers. She adores New York, and her command of the American
language is impressive. No female Boyer she. She is 25 and, since she
was 16, has spent half the year in New York, going to live there full
time when she was 19.
She insisted leaving France was not a career move, more a case of
exploring somewhere different.
''I really like to change identity,'' she said. ''You are born with a
family. When you grow up you begin to meet people, you get friends, and
they become your family. It is the same with a country. You are born
with one, then you decide that maybe this is not your country.
Everywhere is my country.
''I could live anywhere -- maybe not in Eastern countries -- but
anywhere between England, France, Spain, or the US.''
The French cinema industry was controlled by a few people with whom
she was not very friendly, and for her that was a kind of a problem, she
added. It was harder to work there, even if one was good enough to work
anywhere else.
''It is a case of whose friend you are in France, more than what kind
of actress you are, or how good you are,'' she said. ''They don't care
about that. When I moved to the America I had more choice. If someone
casts you there it is because you are right for the part, not because
your are friends with everyone.''
She was asked in an earlier interview about the difference between
working for American and European directors, and said firmly she thought
the latter sometimes liked to be a Pygmalion, to take someone and create
a person. ''I notice that when I work in America they take me as a
person and use me more in the film than trying to create me,'' she said.
''There is a little pretentious thing about wanting to possess the
actress in Europe which I don't like.'' I wondered, had she been talking
about Krysztof Kieslowski in whose film, Three Colours White, she had
starred. She was indeed.
''He was like that for me,'' she said briskly. ''But we found a way of
understanding that was not a case of the Big Master and the Object. He
realised I was giving better and better things when he let me be more
than just an object. Usually he likes to control actors.''
After Before Sunrise she directed her first film, a short for French
televison called Blah, Blah, Blah about people talking about nothing.
Maybe she would direct a feature film someday, but she would want to
know whether she was good enough, she said. She was not yet convinced of
this.
''You could know everything about movies, know every single text book
and still not be a good director,'' she added. ''I am obsessed with
movies, but I don't know if I am good enough to direct and I don't want
to rush.''

WHAT a wonderful medium the radio is, though I was thinking that
frequent listening does encourage one's -- no, my -- already present
eccentricity. I was sitting looking out of the window at the spring
world, nodding to passing neighbours and laughing out loud at Dry
Slopes.
If you pass a house and see a person laughing in front of the
television, you understand what's happening; but a figure staring out
and then guffawing is something else. So by way of explanation, Dry
Slopes is a comedy series written and starring Nick Ball -- really a
manic monologue with interruptions.
Angus Dry is an unemployed 29-year-old still living with mother. If
this had been written in the sixties or seventies, the line would be
that the son was mother-pecked: Ronnie Corbett scared to rebel. But this
mamma wants the nest vacated pronto, she's got a life and lives in hope
that Angus will get one too.
But Angus wants to be needed. He is obsessed with proper families like
the Pomeroys, with children and dogs barking a welcome to the
breadwinner.
He imagines being poured a glass of wine on his return at the end of
the day. The sound effects of this colour-supplement nuclear family are
alternated with the sound of Angus's life: a clock ticking. The boy/man
is desperate -- he fantasises about paying for such a set-up, but even
in his fantasy life his lack of confidence militates against fulfilment:
he's hardly got in the dream house when the actors pack up and go home.
Male behaviour, the meaning of masculinity, was the subject of the
Locker Room, with Tom Robinson exploring the macho conditioning -- or
otherwise -- of boys.
What strange turnarounds happen in the discourse of sexual politics.
If I'd listened in my early twenties to a father talking of refusing his
son toy guns, of disallowing ninja turtles or any of the problematic
violent stuff that is constantly paraded in front of children, I think I
would probably have placed myself on his side of the barricades. And I
still do empathise with his unease about the culture on offer to boys.
But part of me listening now, thought he sounded like a hippie
Stalinist.
Angela Phillips, author of The Trouble with Boys, on the other hand
seemed to make much more sense. Her line was that straightforwardly to
forbid the information, films, crazes of your son, is to disadvantage
him; to increase the vulnerability of the child.
Parents, of course, never get it right anyway, but if we refuse to
engage in our children's interests, we can end up placing them in a
state of confusion which is ultimately self-defeating. Phillips quoted
one interview from her book which was chilling.
A boy in his late teens who had been brought up to be rigidly
playground pacifist was infused with such bitterness that his life
policy has become ''Get the bastards before they get you''. The purist
line is dangerous because it is hypocritical.
The programme was impressive in that, through disparate liberal
opinions, the listener was made to consider how you might achieve an
imaginative empathy with your children, without reverting to the
rigidity of gender notions.
And then I listened to Colin Bell. It is such an achievement to be the
kind of interviewer who can juggle articulate summation with intelligent
put down.
Bell was talking firstly about the Glasgow School of art and its
extraordinary place in our culture. Not a forcing place but a conduit
for the eccentric place that crammers and anachronistic notions of
learning cannot reach.
Listening to him reminded me of the conversations I had with friends
when I was preparing myself for the radio critic hat. And the consensus
was that to listen to BBC Radio Scotland is to be treated like an
intelligent being. (Radio 1 is not light listening, it is
deep-structurally irritative.)
The next subject involved this shmuck who was doing a kind of
designer-rabbiting about the Easy Listening Revival. Bell,
professionally, funnily and rudely, did a wonderful dismissal job. Maybe
in another life his name is Angus Dry.

AS Residents Against Bishopbriggs Infill Tipping Action Group, we are
not aware of any misinformation put out by our group, as Mr Ian Weir
alleges in your report (April 26). In fact, given the high level of
access we gave to our complaints, we would have expected some written
response from the golf club should that have been the case.
The point about heavy lorry traffic was confirmed by Luddons at the
public meeting as being up to 50 lorries per day, from 7am to 7.30pm,
every day of every year for at least five years.
Mr Shannahan, a director, stated that Luddons would propose to dump
waste blacktop and tarmacadam on this site. Blacktop has been confirmed
by two independent sources as leaching a number of chemicals into the
water course, including phenol, a known toxin.
As the action of our group contributed directly to the majority of the
objections, we obviously feel that these points of clarification must be
made.

On behalf of the
Action Group,

4), contained some statements reportedly made by the Spar protesters
which cannot go unchallenged.
All facets of offshore oil and gas activity -- from seeking a licence
to explore for hydrocarbons through the many and varied stages to
securing authority to produce oil and gas -- are strictly controlled and
subject to approval by the government of the day and its agencies.
We refute the allegation that the offshore oil and gas industry dumps
vast quantities of chemicals in the North Sea. Most chemicals used are
not discharged into the sea. However, a few are and these are contained
in drilling discharges and in water produced with the oil. There is no
evidence to suggest the chemicals in these discharges damage the
environment.
Nevertheless, all North Sea coastal states have agreed to introduce a
new control system based on environmental risk assessment which will
allow a consistent approach to the regulation of the use and discharge
of chemicals in the North Sea. This has the full support of the UK
Offshore Operators Association.

I SUPPOSE Anne Johnstone's article on the pitfalls of endowment
mortgages was designed to arouse some reaction from the industry (April
27). Sadly, she appears to be just another financial commentator
prepared to turn a blind eye to the positive benefits of this form of
repayment and to the exclusion of genuine comparisons with other methods
on a like for like basis.
With a repayment loan she mentions casually the need to provide life
assurance on top of the monthly repayments. She fails to comment on the
main reason for policies lapsing before they run the full term, such as
marriage, divorce, redundancy, increase/decrease in family commitments,
and the need to acquire capital from surrender values.
Her industry reference points, whose opinions she obviously supports,
should definitely consider career changes if their comments are anything
to go by. For the ''leading Scots IFA'' to suggest that everyone should
have a capital and interest loan irrespective of their circumstance is
frivolous in the extreme.
Most customers, far from being ''dazzled'' by the prospect of a lump
sum after the loan has been repaid, fully understand that the whittling
effects of inflation will have similarly affected the very premiums
which buy it.
Furthermore, the mortgage analyst who suggests that all first-time
buyers should take out a capital and interest loan unless they plan to
make lots of moves apparently does not realise that the average person
moves house seven times throughout his/her lifetime and on that basis
alone would be better off with an endowment mortgage. Since this is
obviously an incorrect method of assessment it shows how foolish the
comment was in the first place.
Notwithstanding the foregoing views, which in any event are largely
subjective, it is the cost which still remains the primary reason for
most first-time buyers choosing the endowment profile of mortgage
repayment, providing interest rates remain below about 10%. The
Financial Services Act makes provision for this requirement if it is
what the borrower really wants since the effects of interest rates in
excess of this figure have to be fully explained.
Anne Johnstone talks about lovely commissions which are supposed to be
paid to financial advisers for endowment policies but she omits some
very vital information which must be taken in the proper context as it
relates to small businesses.
Far from this correspondent receiving all the lovely commission
referred to, about 95% of it is used to pay for rent, rates, heating,
lighting, salaries, telephones, stationery, etc, as well as all those
supposed luxuries which are the perceived trappings of the
self-employed.
I am confused about her explanation of the respective amounts repaid
under the two different methods. The policy, if encashed today, would
realised #4819, whereas she would only have repaid #4400 under the
capital and interest method, less the cost of life assurance which would
reduce the sum even further. On these sort of figures, I would
respectfully say there is absolutely no contest.

MOYRA GARDNER's parent blackbirds, particularly the hen, is telling a
first brood, her mate, herself, and the world: ''Look at the twigs in my
beak which prevent me feeding you titbits and which will frame a newer,
ampler nest which your next brood won't fall out of too soon, but fly
out of in good and proper time. (April 27)
''So, meantime,'' the hen goes on, ''you'll have to look after
yourselves to some extent. We'll do what we can for you, of course, but
watch out for pet dogs and cats, seek cover on hedges and plants and, if
you can, fly up or flutter to a safe height.
''Sorry, chicks, but it's the best we can do in the rather fraught
circumstances of nestling fledglings too soon.''

APT, was it not, that The Outer Limits (BBC2, Monday) should return in
the week of Local Elections 95 (BBC1, Thursday)? Someone had taken
control of John Major's TV set -- ''we control the horizontal, the
vertical, and all of the marginals'' -- and they were playing evil games
with his tortured mind.
The BBC's election effort got off to a bad, if entirely predictable,
start on Newsnight (BBC2) with Peter Kellner ''getting a picture'' of
what was happening ''throughout Britain''. Kellner was crunching
numbers; much of Scotland, as per, was grinding teeth.
For a certain type of broadcaster, election night is party night. Next
up, and in it for the duration, was that cheeky chappie Peter
''Pee-Wee'' Snow &amp; His Magical Machines: ''Right Jeremy! Let's see
what's clocking up on our counter now!'' As it turned out, what was
flashing up for the Tories, even at that early hour, was the
psephological equivalent of ''tilt''.
''Come on!'' demanded Paxman, of a dementedly chirpy John Prescott,
''You could have put up a gerbil with a red rosette on it and got it
elected, couldn't you?'' Actually, this was to misjudge gerbils. As we
switched over to BBC1, hopes were running high. Were we in luck? Could
it be? Praise the Lord, a Gummer! There he was, Gerbil in Chief and
rodent without peer; one of the last to roam free, twitching his little
nose and quivering with the monstrous effort of appearing totally
relaxed.
Election nights these days are as nothing without the slippery little
chap, bless him. ''Some people will have stayed at home'', the Gummer
assured us, while far off in the weird world of Swingometer Snow, ''all
those little blue Tory MPs'' were turning red. No one was available at
Tory headquarters to say a word about anything, meanwhile allowing Tony
Blair the chance to present himself as the born leader of the Natural
Party of Broadcasting.
Spookily, back at The Outer Limits, the evil brother had spoken of a
problem recognisable to all junior demagogues who imagine they can live
for ever: ''Gentlemen, it goes without saying, we don't need an outbreak
of this in the media. They're harder to control than viruses.'' Too
true.
It is fair to say, however, that we probably do not need another
outbreak of rehashed sci-fi either. A tale of murderous sibling rivalry
and a drug that would cure all ills, it was, by the standards of the
genre, lame indeed. The point missed is that SF isn't really about the
future; at its best it mirrors the times and changes with them. Bring
back The X-Files, therefore, as fast as a global governmental conspiracy
can manage.
On Tuesday, the BBC asked itself What Did You Do in the War, Auntie?
and came up with some fascinating answers. The first part of the series
(BBC1) was entitled The Factory of Entertainment, but it might just as
well have been called Oh, What a Lovely Wireless. Part confession, part
self-congratulation, it charted the process that turned an honest
corporation into that most gruesome of things, a National Institution.
Some of it was merely funny, such as the early instruction to BBC
monitoring staff: ''In the event of an air raid being sounded, staff
must run into the woods and lie down, preferably in pairs''. Some of it
managed to be both disturbing and moving.
''We never got defeated in any battles,'' recalled a sound engineer,
''we made strategic withdrawals.'' Thus the reporting of Dunkirk
contrived to be a mixture of deference, censorship and descriptive
brilliance. Churchill was claimed as ''God's gift to radio'' but the
real saint, even after 50 years, was J B Priestley -- later to be bumped
from the schedules for slipping in ''left-wing thoughts''.
The public, it seems, was properly sceptical of much of the
propaganda. A report from Dover describing the Battle of Britain as if
it were a football match (''Oh boy! I've never seen anything as good as
this!'') aroused widespread revulsion. That did not prevent the BBC from
broadcasting false Air Ministry claims of Nazi losses, however, or of
simply lying about the horrors of the Dieppe raid.
The funniest moment in the documentary was a cause for quirky pride.
When Hitler broadcast a peace offer in the dark days of 1940, the
BBC's German Service didn't bother to trouble the Prime Minister and
took it upon itself to spurn the overture on behalf of the nation; or as
the German-speaking Express hack Sefton Delmer put it in his broadcast:
''We fling it back in your evil-smelling teeth.''
The value of the piece was that it exploded the myth of a country
utterly united. There were levels of doubt and dissension in Britain
then, degrees of patriotism and bravery, layers of certainty and
scepticism. The BBC's war-time role, not least when things were going
badly, was never to let on; chins were to be kept up, no matter what.
In its defence, the corporation could recall how it resisted demands
that it be absorbed by the Ministry of Information. It could also claim,
with good reason, that it had a better idea of what was required to
maintain morale than any blimpish bureaucrat, even if that involved
ITMA, a broadcasting legend whose charms are now mysterious.
Yet Churchill, exploiting the medium to the full, still managed to
damn the corporation as ''one of the major neutrals''. This modern
viewer, watching the old men who wore their despatches with a mixture of
pride and shame, couldn't help but remember the BBC's infamous
self-censorship during the Falklands and Gulf wars. A tradition lives
on, lest we forget.
Some distance from the traditions of public-service broadcasting was
Tuesday's Omnibus (BBC1). Dave Stewart -- Greetings From the Gutter was
an interesting title, not least because it also happens to be the title
of Stewart's new album. Consider, too, that Stewart has had some ups and
downs in his career (no hits whatever) since Annie Lennox left him to
his own devices and quit Eurythmics, and you begin to wonder what's
going on.
Stuffed with tedious post-modernist devices and bad songs, this was,
literally, publicity you couldn't buy. Would Omnibus, of all programmes,
have gone for it if Lennox had not agreed to a lengthy interview? Would
anyone have watched? Here Stewart was less unplugged than thoroughly and
shamelessly plugged, by a BBC that seems to have forgotten most of its
own rules. So who really is in control of your TV set?

THE Non-Proliferation Treaty is currently up for renewal at a
conference in New York. If it is accepted, five countries (Britain, the
US, France, Russia, and China) can legitimately have nuclear weapons.
Any other country suspected of developing nuclear weapons will be
threatened with punishment.
From MPs to radical peace campaigners, all are united in supporting
the treaty which they claim will prevent the spread of nuclear weapons
and stop the causes of war.
I disagree. The NPT has nothing to do with peace. It divides up the
world into two camps -- those that can and those that cannot be trusted
with the bomb.
The Third World is presented as irresponsible, untrustworthy, and
ultimately lacking in humanity. It is therefore accepted that Britain
and the US should police the Third World.
The UN can demand to inspect what it suspects to be potential nuclear
weapon sites in the Third World and if these countries don't toe the
line they are threatened with annihilation.
A very dangerous climate is being created. The danger does not come
from the Third World but from the double standards of Western
governments and their radical supporters.

I HAVE criticised John Macleod frequently in the past but I want to
thank him for taking such a positive stand over the Lingerabay quarry. I
visited Lewis and Harris last year and found a great deal of
misinformation abroad in Stornoway among even local people.
I was told, for example, that the beautiful bay at Luskentyre would be
ruined by this dreadful quarry but no-one was able to show me where the
quarry was to be sited. Eventually I went to the local library and there
were all the details, including the safeguards, for all the world to
see. After visiting the area I honestly cannot see that the quarry would
be anything but good for Harris and Lewis, too.
My conclusion has been that the scaremongers of the ''green''
persuasion don't really know what they are talking about and the last
thing they are worried about is the wellbeing of the people who live on
these islands. They want to see more and more depopulation, leaving the
islands to the birds and the waves.
I lived the first 20 years of my life within a mile or so of a quarry.
I don't remember that dust was a problem or even the occasional
explosions heard when blasting was in progress. The church which stands
near the quarry is still standing and work was provided for an area that
badly needed employment.
Let us hope that common sense prevails and the people of Harris and
Lewis and other parts of the Outer Hebrides may benefit from the
business generated by such a long-term project.

IT was with great interest that I read William Hunter's article on the
doll's house which during the war helped raise so much money for Red
Cross (April 18).
However, let us give credit where credit is due. Although much of the
furnishing can be accredited to the skills of Mrs Grace Gavin, the house
itself was constructed by a well-known Dunblane gentleman, namely Mr
Bill Eadie, who was assisted by his brother, Jimmy, and his father, Mr
Hyle Eadie, the latter being a painter and decorator to trade and who
was responsible for the interior/exterior decoration of the house.
I believe the wiring for the electricity was carried out by another
Dunblane gentleman, a Mr Stewart.
For many years, both before and after the war, Mr Bill Eadie was
employed as chauffeur/gardener to Mrs Grace Gavin, and when she moved
south to Berkshire, to further her film career, Bill and his family
accompanied her.
Sadly Bill Eadie died only three months ago, not knowing that his
beloved home would once more be going on tour to raise yet more cash for
charity.
He is survived by his widow, one daughter, and three grandchildren,
all of whom are justifiably proud of his handiwork.
I trust that the house's forthcoming tour will prove to be as
successful as its first, and that the gentlemen who put so much time and
effort into this project will get the recognition they deserve.

LIZ LOCHHEAD, I'd been told, was to be the highlight of this year's
Mayfest in Glasgow. So I went to see her Blood and Ice at the Ramshorn
Theatre. The show was cancelled. No-one had bought a ticket. The large
company which had worked on the show was demoralised. And so was I.
On the opening night of Mayfest I went to the Festival Club at the Old
Fruitmarket. The club was cancelled. There was a private party. The
public were not to be allowed entry to an event open to them in the
Mayfest brochure. More demoralisation.
Is anyone out there organising Mayfest 1995? For 12 years I have been
attending events at this major international arts festival. It was
exciting, outrageous, and unmissable. It breathed new life into the
people of Glasgow. And now?
Now we have a heady mixture of ballroom dancing and disco. The
index-free brochure is a shambles, the lack of events disguised by the
indecipherable folly of a day-by-day guide.
The word ''international'' is dropped from the festival's sub-title, a
return to the parochial and xenophobic buffoonery that Mayfest was set
up to overcome. The number of events in the disadvantaged communities of
Glasgow has been reduced to insignificance. Meanwhile the affluent West
End is super-served by a major new venue, the Cottier Theatre.

YOUR report on the Gallipoli landings of April 1915 is inaccurate in
stating there was only ''one flat-bottomed assault craft, an adapted
Clyde steamer'' (April 25). The vessel used was the freighter, River
Clyde, purchased by the Admiralty from my grandfather for use as an
infantry landing ship.
The River Clyde was a typical tramp ship of her time. She was of 6700
deadweight tons, built by Russell &amp; Co, of Port Glasgow, for the Glasgow
ship-owning firm of Ormond Cook &amp; Co in 1905.
She was re-floated in 1919 and towed to Malta for repairs, following
which she was sold to Spanish owners. She traded until January 1968,
when, under the name of Maruja y Aurora, she was sold to Spanish
shipbreakers at Aviles.

WHILE not disagreeing with the general sentiment of your report on the
Atholl Estates, I must point out that this #5 toll has been levied for a
considerable number of years and has been successful in ensuring
strictly limited vehicle access to Glen Tilt (May 3).
As a keen hillwalker I have no objection to paying the toll as it
provides an easy seven-mile access to the remote hills at the head of
Glen Tilt. The dirt track is a well-maintained estate road -- and not a
public road -- which the Duke could legally close at any time.
If this had been a public road it doubtless would have been destroyed
and drowned in litter years ago. Overall, the toll has prevented the
desecration of, and conserved, a very beautiful glen.
The toll of #5 is certainly more justified than the #6 toll soon to be
levied on the public road to Skye.

FOURTEEN days to go until GA-Day. I still enjoy the pomp and
circumstance, the guns firing in salute, the trumpeters and the buzz of
the big occasion. It's not quite such a big potato as VE-Day but the
General Assembly remains a unique institution in Scottish life. No other
annual event brings together people from every walk of life from very
corner of Scotland to discuss social and moral issues of our time (as
well as fulfilling the role of a shareholders' annual meeting for a
business with an #80m turnover).
This year we will have an ecumenical star-turn, with Cardinal Winning
likely to be invited to speak.
However, the core business of the Assembly is contained in the reports
which still command a significant amount of coverage in this and other
newspapers. These reports are released in dribs and drabs (or, in the
case of committees, given to prolixity and verbosity, read dribbles and
gushes). Together they form the Blue Book, which this year dribs out at
676 pages.
There is plenty of quality (a thoughtful and balanced report on gene
research from Social Responsibility, a thought-provoking and
non-divisive dialogue on sexual morals from the Panel on Doctrine) and
those who prefer quantity can dredge through 110 pages from National
Mission or 58 from Parish Education.
The former may have gone to great lengths in vain over one item, for I
hear that after it has reached agreement to lease Carberry Tower, the
idyllically situated but costly-to-run conference centre, to a Kirk
group to develop, the group has now been advised it needs a buy-out of
the property to secure its future and is about to make an offer for the
property which it hopes will not be refused. Since neither lease nor
offer is apparently at ''market value'', the financially challenged Kirk
will have an awkward choice to make. Stand by for another Battle of
Carberry Tower at the Assembly.
By far the most significant item in the Blue Book has so far received
no publicity at all and is on page one. It is an apparently innocuous
request from the Board of Practice and Procedure that the Board of
Ministry be instructed to consider ''whether all ministerial tenure
should be terminable''. If you take it in conjunction with the report
this year on professional standards and conduct, it represents a highly
significant move towards greater control over its ministers by the Kirk.
Until now, the parish minister was highly autonomous in the way he did
his job and, unless he erred morally or doctrinally, could not be
dislodged if he wished to stay until age 70 (it used to be for life).
Such job security is now unheard of elsewhere, and when a square peg
ended up in a round hole, the only way to dislodge him was to use the
mighty mallet of legislation which talked about ''congregations in an
unsatisfactory state''. It was cumbersome, lengthy, and few gained
thereby.
One major problem with this was that if it was the congregation (or a
few troublemakers among them), not the minister, who was to blame, then
it was still the minister who had to move, and because there is no
authority in the Kirk to place ministers in vacant congregations (until
they are called via the vacancy committee system) such people could
languish without a parish. Whether they merited it or not, they carried
a stigma. To be redundant in industry is bad enough but a ''stickit
minister'' often found it difficult to get another parish.
One way of tackling the problem is to create more terminable tenure
parishes (short-term contracts such as are now common in business and
industry). However, congregations are reluctant to adopt such solutions
(viz the appeals which will be coming to the Assembly from St Mungo's
Alloa and Holy Rude, Stirling, both of whom want a traditional ministry
for their historic kirks). This solution has been used increasingly and
soon another tool will be available to those who want to make the hiring
and firing and deployment of ministers more flexible.
The tool in question is a proposed Act which would come into effect
next year to enable presbyteries and the central Parish Reappraisal
committee to exert pressure on debtor congregations who are not paying
as much as the presbytery thinks they could. The Act will enable them to
be closed or united with another church without the long drawn-out
debilitating fights which have accompanied Kirk unions in recent years.
However, it still leaves a situation in which ministers or
congregations can be erased, but not prescribed. It is a negative power,
rather than a directive one. What the ministry men must surely introduce
-- as a logical consequence of job descriptions, short-term contracts,
and powers of closure -- is the right to take ministers from one
situation where they are no longer needed (or sometimes wanted) or want
to be and place them in a new situation where they will minister more
fruitfully.
To those readers unfamiliar with Kirk ways, this may seem
uncontroversial. In many ways it ought to be. But it takes away the
right of call from the congregation, one of the sacred cows of Kirk
practice, and will be resisted by traditionalists.
Anyone who knows anything about the Kirk knows that these small,
apparently obscure changes will be controversial. But anyone who cares
about the Kirk knows that the needs of next century must be planned now
or it will be too late. Fighting battles of a past century will absorb
energy from that task and embalm the Kirk for burial rather than staunch
the flow of lifeblood which is ebbing away.

of World War Two saw the beginning of the cold war. It was, of course,
cold only in the sense that the USA and the USSR never directly
confronted each other in a hot war, only through their surrogates in
Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Korea, Vietnam, Angol, Mozambique, Nicaragua,
Egypt.
For the peoples of these countries, the period was very hot.
The cold war ended, symbolically, with the tearing down of the Berlin
Wall in 1991. The major plus was that the temperature was never nuclear.
How did it all begin? The Soviets and the Western Allies had just
defeated the Axis powers and yet within months they were on opposite
sides in a cold war which lasted through five decades.
Put simply, both sides suspected the other of seeking world
domination: ideologically, economically, politically, militarily, or in
some combination. For Hugh Thomas, the USSR was a ''nation which aspired
to world influence if not hegemony''. For Louis Halle, ''in the cold war
various historical circumstances put Russia in the role of challenger --
superficially, at least, in the role of aggressor''.
Those ''historical circumstances'' were the Russian memory of repeated
invasions through Poland by Swedes, French, Germans; in the seventeenth
century the Poles had reached the Kremlin.
The Soviet drive west in 1944 gave it the opportunity to ring itself
with friendly states as protection. The deals done by Stalin, Roosevelt,
and Churchill at Yalta led to communist control in Poland, Romania,
Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Hungary, and ultimately East
Germany. Finland, Austria, and Greece eventually avoided communist
control.
From one angle we can see the cold war in the West as the process by
which these communist-controlled countries gained their independence
from the USSR. In turn, old identities and regions surfaced and the
communist bloc fragmented.
This process began after Stalin's death in 1953. In 1955, the USSR
under Kruschev withdrew troops from Austria; West Germany was granted
sovereignty and the right to re-arm; and the release began of the
millions held in the Gulag. Kruschev's words spoke even louder when he
denounced the barbaric methods of Stalin; rejected Lenin's doctrine that
war was inevitable between the communists and the capitalists; and said
that there might even be a parliamentary road to socialism.
Such principles were not automatically accepted in practice in Hungary
in 1956, and Czechoslovakia in 1968, when strikes and demonstrations
calling for change were ended by Soviet tanks.
Poland had more success through such actions: Cardinal Wyszynski was
released in 1956; strikes in 1970 had US trade-union support and raised
the issues of Jewish freedom to emigrate; in 1980 Solidarity was formed
and negotiated on prices, the right to strike, and state radio broadcast
of Sunday mass.
In 1956, it was the British and French attack on Egypt, after Nasser
took control of the Suez Canal, which deflected attention from the
Soviet suppression of the Hungarian uprising. There were many other
times when the term ''cold war'' tells of the perspective from which the
period was viewed.
The action was very hot in Korea when the US supported South Korea to
prevent the North bringing communist power closer to Japan. Long wars
saw France and the US expelled from Vietnam, and the USSR from
Afghanistan.
Even worse threats and plans were frequently made during the cold war,
the most famous being Kruschev's promise to bury the capitalist West.
The US threatened to use force to stop Soviet ships bringing missiles
to Cuba. To return to the question of origin, perhaps the Soviet fears
in 1945 had some justification. Martin Walker asks us to think of the
effect on the USSR of knowing that the US Joint Chiefs of Staff paper of
October 1945 was entitled ''Strategic vulnerability of Russia to a
limited air attack''.
This was a plan to use the atomic bomb on 20 Soviet cities. Walker
points out that ''just 10 weeks after the end of World War Two, US
military planners were contemplating the targets of World War Three''.
For Walker, ''the end of the cold war was just as much a Soviet decision
to redirect their frustrated energies to a new challenge, a decisive and
still unresolved confrontation with their own internal problems and
structures''.
Some such challenges to a lesser extent face all the old Allies of
World War Two.

Almost 60,000 men faced conscientious objectors' tribunals in Britain
in he Second World War. Glasgow journalist Gavin Bell Sen was one of
them. Here he explains why and gives an account of his own wartime
experiences.
HEALING, not killing, is the business of anyone who claims to be a
follower of the man of Nazareth: a truth not to be denied because
nations go to war. But the Conscientious Objectors' Tribunal in Glasgow
turned down my request for the Royal Army Medical Corps. They considered
the whole idea so absurd they struck me off the Objectors' Register
altogether. Killing, they decided, was to be my business, or else . . .
prison or a military ''glasshouse'' loomed.
Fortunately, the Appeals Tribunal in Edinburgh met me halfway by
recommending a non-combatant company attached to the Pioneer Corps.
When I reported to the Pioneers' HQ at Dinglevale School, Liverpool,
it was clear they were not unused to conscientious objectors causing
problems. Would I wear a uniform? Yes, if I got a transfer to the
Medical Corps.
The Pioneer Sergeant issuing the uniforms came from Bridgeton. As he
handed over the shoulder flashes with the letters NCC, he looked at me
in disbelief. ''Ye come frae Glesca, and ye'll no' fight?'' With other
blokes waiting in the queue for uniforms it didn't seem the time or
place to tell him that objectors were fighting the massive punitive
power of the state being used to force them into killing. Finally, we
were all given a palliasse to sleep the night on the floor of former
classrooms.
Next morning, as the others signed their enlistment papers, I refused
''unless it was for the Medical Corps''. I was marched off, and locked
up in the guardroom where other objectors were instantly recognisable --
their heads had been shaven.
They told me they had been forcibly given a ''convict cut'', they were
being beaten up by NCOs, and they wanted to smuggle out a letter to an
MP asking for action to stop the abuse. A bizarre turn of events gave me
the chance to help.
We were all marched out to stand in line outside the Commanding
Officer's room, and one by one taken in to be dealt with, then marched
out again to stand in line waiting to be taken back to the guardroom.
The escort sergeant was about to give the order, when the Regimental
Sergeant Major came out of the CO's office, where he had heard all our
cases, and indicated he wanted a word with me. ''Carry on, Sergeant,''
he told the escort, who took all the others back into custody.
The RSM then had what I can only call a friendly chat with me about
service in the Medical Corps. This seemed to have struck a sympathetic
chord in his soldier's mind; here was a bloke prepared to take the same
risks as a soldier, but to heal, not to wound, to save lives, not to
take them.
The chat over, instead of ordering me back to the guardroom, he said:
''Right then, off you go, back to your classroom billet.''
Now, looking back, I am certain he was aware that his subordinates
were giving all the objectors in the guardroom a hard time, and decided
I was not a suitable case for that kind of treatment. This totally
unexpected turn of events gave me the chance to smuggle out the
objectors' letter.
After meals in the dining-room, everybody carried their plates outside
to wash up in a metal bath of hot water on the ground. I followed the
prisoners out, and as their escort sergeant chatted with friends, I bent
over the bath close beside the objector who had the letter, which he
slipped to me under the cover of our two plates.
If this had been detected I was in big trouble, but I was lucky and
got away with it. The letter was posted, the MP took action, and the
offenders were court-martialled.
Although many objectors were court-martialled -- some more than once
-- and suffered the harshest treatment in army glasshouses, none of us
had to face the systematic, callous cruelty of the military against
objectors in he First World War.
The figures make chilling reading: 5739 refused to obey army orders;
all were court-martialled, 655 of them twice, 521 three times, 319 four
times, 50 five times, and three six times; 39 were driven insane, 71
died as a result of their punishment, 34 were sentenced to death at the
front in France, where they had been shipped by the army who had no
power to execute them in Britain. The death sentences were later
commuted to 10 years' penal servitude. For them, no badges of courage.
We were fortunate that between the wars the various peace movements
had attracted wide support. The Peace Pledge Union received almost
113,000 pledges: ''I renounce war and will never support or sanction
another.'' Public opinion, although still strongly against, was less
hostile to the 60,000 men who went before the tribunals. And we were
fortunate to have the political support of some Labour MPs, which
brought effective action from our smuggled letter.
For some weeks after it was posted, I was left in limbo. Wearing a
uniform, I was no longer a civilian, but I was not in the army because I
had not signed on. When it became clear no action was being taken for a
transfer, I agreed to join No 6 Company of the Non-Combatant Corps in
the hope -- which proved unfounded -- of still negotiating a transfer.
German bombers were blasting London and we were sent down to help the
rescue workers recover victims, some dead or dying, from the wreckage,
and to help clear up the debris. Later, back in Liverpool which was
being bombed, we were trained in fire-fighting, and went on night
fire-watch in food warehouses in dockland Bootle.
There were certain ''tales of the unexpected''. On this second visit
to Merseyside, I saw a series of fist fights between objectors and
Pioneer Corps soldiers; but it was a sign of better relations, not
worse. All the fighters had been in boxing clubs in civvy street and,
after each bout in an arranged boxing tournament, shook hands in a
friendly gesture of mutual respect.
Than, a few of us were given a course in aircraft-spotting and
seconded to the HQ of Southern Command. There was a slit trench in the
grounds with a push button which rang alarm bells inside the building.
Our duty, if there were signs of danger from the air, was to don our
steel helmets, get into the trench, and scan the sky for German bombers.
We never saw any, but if the engine noise of approaching aircraft seemed
like the distinctive hesitant beat of German bombers, we played it safe
and pressed the button, which sent the army top brass hurrying to the
safety of the cellars inside, leaving the khaki-clad, steel-helmeted
''conchies'' to brave possible bombs outside; tales can't come any more
unexpected.
Our ''heroic'' stint over, we rejoined our company, a decent bunch of
blokes who got on well together despite their different labels:
Stalinists, Trotskyists, humanists, ''intellectuals'', and a number of
the smaller Christian sects. There were not so many from the mainstream
churches. I was in a minority of one when the war issue was debated by
members of my own Church of Scotland in Glasgow.
The leaders of the established national churches, of all
denominations, on both sides of the conflict, saw no contradiction in
praying for peace while sending out their young men to kill and maim
each other and, if bomb crew, women and children.
This counterfeit ''Christianity'' is only possible because the
churches, over the centuries, have buried the man of Nazareth and his
clear-cut peaceful revolutionary message under a mountain of myths.
One of the most deadly is that he can be quoted to justify the
indiscriminate mass slaughter of war. Many more civilians, at least 30
million,* were killed than combatants in the Second World War.
Every cenotaph bears the words: ''Greater love has no man than this,
that a man lay down his life for his friends.'' It is right that the
many brave men who risked and lost their lives should be remembered
today with respect, and their womenfolk who suffered a lifetime of their
loss remembered with compassion, to remind us similar sacrifices should
never happen again.
But a man at war does not ''lay down'' his life. He is trained to
protect it, and kill as many other men, the ''enemy'', as he can. The
words on the cenotaphs have been taken out of context to give precisely
the opposite meaning Jesus intended. The missing words are: ''You are my
friends if you do what I command you. This is my commandment that you
love one another as I have loved you. By this shall all men know you are
my followers.''
This can only mean they must refuse the right of their conflicting
nation states to force them into murdering and maiming each other, or
any other man.
Jesus, knowing that the religious/political establishment of his own
day was plotting his judicial murder, because his revolutionary message
was gaining too much popular support and threatening their power and
privileges, immediately warned his friends: ''If they have persecuted me
they will also persecute you.'' He added: ''If the world hates you, you
know that it hated me before it hated you.'' At his trial they spat on
him.
Conscientious objectors, widely held in contempt, included those who
laid down their lives in the First World War for refusing to renounce
their belief that the only way for followers of the man of Nazareth is
to heal, not to wound, to save lives, not destroy them; a truth which
cannot be denied because nations go to war.
*Chronicle of the Second World War: Longman, 1990.
A VOICE FROM GERMANY
HERMANN Hesse, the German writer whose books were burned by the Nazis,
said after the First World War: ''During the war the theologians buried
their Christianity. They 'proved' with guile and many words that war and
Christianity were perfectly compatible, that a man could be the best of
Christians and yet shoot and stab to perfection. This is not true.''
On receiving Nobel and Goethe Prizes after the Second World War, he
said: ''The megalomania of technology, and the megalomania of
nationalism, have been responsible for two world wars and their
consequences. Resistance to these is the most important task and
justification of the human spirit. The elimination of war remains our
noblest aim and the ultimate consequence of the Christian ethic.
''I am an individualist, and I regard the Christian veneration for
every human soul as what is best and most holy in Christianity.
''It may be that we are witnessing the emergence of a collective man
without individual soul, who will do away with the entire religious and
individualistic tradition of mankind.
''But if anything can cure the world and make mankind whole and pure
again, it is the actions and suffering of those who refuse to be bent or
bought, and were more willing to lose their lives than their humanity.''

VE-DAY is a complete blank in the mind of Stanley Baxter. He now
thinks this was because he was doing his basic training for the army and
there was still that unfinished business with Japan to be dealt with.
''We were confined to Pinefield Camp, Elgin, and bromide and the
prospect of a drafting to Burma deflated our spirits and everything
else,'' he says.
''Any rejoicing I might have felt was modified by the possible horror
to come. And I think my folks must have thought: 'Don't make too much of
this. We've still got the Japanese to cope with and Sonny Boy might be
sent there.' So I think it would have been a low profile in the Baxter
household.''
There are those who say they had a good war, meaning they were posted
to some quiet backwater. Stanley actually had two wars -- a good one and
a bad one. And the good one was when he was in the forces.
He was called up twice. In 1944, at the age of 17[3/4], he was
enlisted as a Bevin Boy (so called after Ernest Bevin, then Minister of
Labour and National Service) to be a coal-miner. ''It was like the
lottery. If your number came out of the hat you had no choice.''
First he was drafted to Dunfermline, then Shotts. ''I was put in an
open shed at five o'clock in the morning in midwinter to pick the dirt
out of the coal as it came past on a conveyor belt while all the stour
went up your nostrils and covered your face in black. It was a
completely different existence from the world of North Kelvinside and
Hillhead High School.''
He had begun broadcasting at the age of 14 and occasionally dashed
back from the pits to do a broadcast for Aunt Kathleen's Children's
Hour. His escape from the pits was made possible through something that
had happened in his acting career. He had been evacuated to Millport and
on the journey from Wemyss Bay to play David Balfour in a radio
adaptation of Kidnapped for Moultrie Kelsall the train broke down in a
snowstorm. There was no heating and he developed a middle-ear condition.
Working in the open shed, it flared up again and he was downgraded. You
had to be A1 to be a miner.
While waiting to be called up to the forces he joined Unity Theatre,
Glasgow, got the lead in one play, as an old man. He then went into
rehearsals for another play about a Clydeside worker who was blinded in
the war. ''And I thought: 'Oh, what a wonderful part.' Because I had to
come in and say: 'Is that you, Jean?' to the fiancee. And I thought:
'Oh, I'll get such sympathy and everything'.''
Halfway through rehearsals his call-up came. As it happened, his part
in the downfall of Japan was also written out -- by history. When VJ-Day
came he was at Woking, training as a supply clerk in the Royal Army
Service Corps.
''Thereafter, a posting to the Far East led to dreams of a Somerset
Maugham scenario rather than a spell in a Japanese POW camp. In the
event, neither ensued. Just Privates on Parade, It Ain't Half Hot, Mum,
and a determination to embrace a theatrical future,'' he says.
In Burma, at Rangoon Race Course, which had been taken over, he did
his bit as a supply clerk for nine months. Also took part in
entertainments and his war was getting better all the time.
''By this time they had decided to abandon ENSA (informally known as
Every Night Something Awful) and use whatever talent might be in the
army instead of shipping out civilian artists from the UK. So they
formed the CSE (Combined Services Entertainments).''
The kind of shows in which he took part were exactly like the
television series It Ain't Half Hot, Mum. Sketches, songs, bits of drag.
The first person he met at the unit was Kenneth Williams. Then Peter
Nichols, who was to write Privates on Parade, and later the
award-winning play A Day in the Death of Joe Egg, premiered at the
Citizens' Theatre, which was also to loom large in Stanley's life. They
were also joined by John Schlesinger, the movie director, and Stanley
wrote material for him. They toured the Far East, appearing in Garrison
theatres in At Your Service.
''We were allowed to wear civvy clothes. It was called a cushy billet.
In fact the one terrible threat they could make to us was RTU -- return
to unit if you don't behave.
''That was the most fun time I ever had because you had all the fun of
show business and none of the responsibility.''

JACK MILROY knows exactly where he was on V E night. He was getting
lit up as the lights came on in London, singing, dancing, and cheering
with thousands of others round Piccadilly Circus.
After five-and-a-half years serving with the Black Watch in the Middle
East, India, and Burma, Private Milroy had been brought back to
Stewarton, Ayrshire, with his battalion before being transferred to the
Airborne Division at Woodall Spa to await a secret posting.
''News of the end of the war came through while we were there. We
managed to hitch a lift to London. It was absolutely marvellous. All the
lights were back on. Everyone kissing and hugging complete strangers. We
were in uniform, too, so we couldn't lose. People kept buying us drinks.
''I vividly recall us waking up in the lounge of the Regent Palace
Hotel, Piccadilly. It was 5am and I knew we had to get back to camp. We
could have been arrested for being AWOL.''
As they were huddling in a doorway on the outskirts of London, a
civilian came up and handed them a #5 note, saying simply: ''Thanks very
much for the end of the war, lads. You did a great job.''
''We couldn't believe it,'' says Jack. ''A fiver was a fortune in
those days. My first instinct was to say: 'Right, we're going back into
London for a week'.''
Instead they were taken back to the camp by civilian police. ''As soon
as we walked in we were put straight into jail, the guardhouse. And the
following night we were all flown to Norway on special assignment as
part of the Army of Occupation.
''We were looking for Vidkun Quisling, the puppet Prime Minister for
the Nazis. We never found him but we found a lot of good wine. It was a
great time for drinking . . .''
Jack's stage career began to blossom in the army. The seeds had been
planted before the war as a member of an amateur concert party, the
Sunny Favourites, who appeared on the open-air stages in the Glasgow
parks.
His most magical show-business memory of the war is of seeing Noel
Coward entertain the forces at Chittagong on the Burmese border. ''He
volunteered to come out when Lord Mountbatten told him there were no
professional entertainers. So Mountbatten flew him out, complete with a
little white piano. They set up a stage on a vacant piece of ground and
he appeared before an audience of about 20,000. He was absolutely
brilliant.''
Coward was on stage for the whole of the second half of the concert.
The first half of the bill had been topped by comedian Reg Dixon, who
was to get to No 1 in the hit parade after the war with his song
Confidentially.
Jack organised a few concert parties for the battalion. Found somebody
who could do monologues, a guy from Aberdeen with a little ukulele. And
he got a group of West Indians who had formed a choir.
He linked the shows. ''That's how I started to find the comedy ideas.
You just took the mickey out of the officers and everybody roared their
heads off. It wasn't so easy when I came back to civvy street and tried
it out. There were no officers to take the mickey out of.''
He went round doing one-night shows in the little halls in Leven,
Kirkcaldy, and Arbroath, acting as the utility man, feed to the comics.
Then he got into the Queen's Theatre, Glasgow, with Frank and Doris
Droy, and Sammy Murray. It was from Sammy Murray that he picked up the
expression ''Hullawrerr, china''. He says: ''I didn't realise it was
really cockney slang: china plate -- mate. Then of course Rikki and I
used it all the time with Francie and Josie.''
Jack's wife, Mary Lee, had been British vocalist of the year just
before the war when she sang with the Roy Fox orchestra. During the war
she entertained the Desert Rats with the Jack Payne big band. But
although he had been in Egypt he did not meet her until 1947 when Nellie
Sutherland, of Glasgow's Gault's Agency, sent him over to the Empire,
Belfast, where she was acting as feed to the Second Bananas, the No 2
comedians on the bill.
The following year Jack was to top the bill at the Tivoli, Aberdeen,
changing the show every week for a record 22 weeks. Then years of Ayr
Gaiety summer shows, Five Past Eights and Francie and Josie with Rikki
Fulton.
As he polishes his medals, including the Burma Star and African Star,
his memories of V E night come flooding back.

ROSELLE FROMAGE was a 16-year-old schoolgirl when a group of
foreigners appeared at her father's farm in the St Saviour parish of
Guernsey in 1942. She recalls that they were a pitiful sight.
''They were in a terrible state. They looked half-starved, and they
had cement sacks tied around their waists and their feet to keep warm.''
The gaunt men were Spanish, imported by German occupation forces as
slave labour to construct fortifications on the Channel Islands as part
of Hitler's Atlantic Wall of defences against the Allies. This
particular group were building a massive coastal artillery battery
nearby, and they were desperate for food.
The Fromage family promptly adopted them, providing them with meals in
exchange for firewood for cooking. Among them was 23-year-old Juan
Alarcon, who had fled from one war against fascism only to be ensnared
by another.
As a member of the defeated Republican army in the Spanish Civil War,
he crossed the Pyrenees into France in 1939. There the Vichy authorities
apprehended him and handed him over to the Germans, who set him to work
building a submarine base near La Rochelle.
When that project was completed he was shipped to Guernsey, which is
how fate drew him and Roselle together. After the war Juan could not
return to Spain, which was still ruled by Franco, and so he remained on
Guernsey and worked for Roselle's parents. Romance blossomed, and they
were married in 1947.
They now own the farm where Juan came begging for food, and lease
their land to a tenant farmer. The prospect from their house on a
winding country lane is idyllic, with lush pastures sweeping down to a
reservoir overlooking the sea.
But little more than a mile away, the concrete turrets and bunkers of
the Miras battery still stand as a grim reminder of the three years of
hell Juan endured at the hands of brutal guards. He never goes there,
because he cannot bear the memories they recall.
Juan and Roselle were among those who objected when they learned that
a Liberation Day memorial in Guernsey would not identify the Germans as
the occupying forces. It was a protest roused by an abiding anger at
their treatment of Juan and his friends, many of whom did not survive.
''All my comrades who died,'' he says. ''How many died? And for what?
For nothing.''
The Spaniards died mainly of illness and starvation as a result of
working 20-hour days on a diet of watery soup and mouldy bread.
The Austrian guards rarely assaulted Juan and his friends; they simply
worked them beyond exhaustion. ''They were bloody cruel,'' he says.
''They worked us day and night, never stopping. It was terrible for
everyone. If it had not been for the local people, many more of us would
have died.''
Fifty years on, it is hard for anyone who did not live through the
occupation to imagine such horrors in this pastoral landscape. But even
in the spring sunshine, with wildflowers blooming in the hedgerows, Juan
remembers.
A local television station recently persuaded him to pose for pictures
by the Miras battery and he suffered a panic attack. ''I was shaking,
and I could feel my heart running fast, and my tears coming down. It was
too much.''

IN the days before war broke out, radio broacasting from Scotland
moved at a genteel gait. It started late and finished early. There was
no rush to be up, and talking, with the birds. About the middle of the
morning was soon enough. Proceedings opened with a religious service.
By way of a benediction followed a half-hour of a cinema organ. At
several other times of day the chances were still good that the airwaves
would be in the hands of another, though similar, picture-theatre
performer.
Symphony orchestras also went on, so it seemed, endlessly. Perhaps in
the early evening would be allowed a lightening of the atmosphere to let
in a blast of music-hall. Then, as now, gramophone records ate up most
of the permitted hours.
By the day the war ended, BBC radio had been through a revolution.
From as early as 7am, the Home service (as it had come to be called)
was briskly about its business. It kicked off, no messing, with a news
bulletin. Not pausing for breath, it followed with a quarter-hour of
exercises.
Wartime innovations included Music While You Work. Here was half an
hour of seamless and upbeat tunes. They were lightly to occupy the ears,
while the hands kept busy. Timed at 4.30pm, they called for a renewal of
effort and a straining of sinew for the last hour or so of the working
day. Factory managers sprayed the shop-floor with the music through
loudspeakers.
When licence-holders wearied of the Home, they had the choice of a
whole other network called Forces. For its livelier pace, they were
indebted to Hitler.
Music While You Work was also on Forces, but twice. A mid-morning
burst of songs to toil to was capped by a late (very late: l0.30pm) show
for night workers. And there were picture-house organs, of course.
Forces blazed much with military bands. It had more comedy.
Strangely -- perhaps not strangely at all -- the programmes which most
stick in the mind were earnest little beat-the-Hun shows.
There was Kitchen Front, a short essay of home hints for adversity
housekeeping and how to eat patriotically. ''Have you tried cabbage
tops?'' an enthusiast of plain fare would inquire of the lieges in an
eager voice that sounded well-fed. He once memorably insisted that
bracken leaves tasted like asparagus.
Dr Charles Hill, the Radio Doctor, who later, and less famously, was a
Cabinet Minister and a Governor of the BBC, became notorious for how
fondly he recommended prunes to an unbelieving nation.
Nobody interrupted with the thought that food rationing had produced a
Britain that was better nourished than for a generation.
For the tonnage of good it added to morale, the BBC was as a
battleship and worth a convoy of Liberty cargo boats. Day by day,
however, it became taken for granted. By the war's end, The Glasgow
Herald, down to eight pages, displayed the wireless programmes in hardly
more than two cramped inches of type.
There was no hiding wireless sets. Compared with modern radios, they
were lumpy pieces of furniture. They needed a daily dusting. Not lightly
could they be moved around. In living-rooms they had their established
place. They were like household icons, although not every family could
afford one. They became treated as oracles.
If, like those of oracles, the messages were often hard to interpret,
and sometimes false, everybody listened devotionally, especially at 9pm
for the news.
Announcers were instructed first to give their names for fear the
enemy might have captured the station and were putting out phoney
information. Although it hardly suited their lofty, detached manners,
the men who gave the news had to learn to be as familar as pals next
door. So it became: ''This is the BBC Home Service. Here is the News and
this is Joseph MacLeod (or Alvar Lidell or Wilfred Pickles) reading
it.'' It was said, probably accurately, that the evening newsreaders
wore evening dress.
Bruce Belfrage was quietly treated as a hero for how he never stumbled
on the night a landmine fell outside Broadcasting House, London,
impertinently interrupting The News.
Despite the Blitz, national news kept coming from London. In the early
panicky days, other departments were dispersed. Variety programmes
fetched up in Bristol.
The laughter show most fondly remembered from the unfunny years of war
was ITMA -- short for It's That Man Again. It gripped the country in a
way now hard to understand or even describe.
It was a quickfire, zany show of dire puns and awful whimsies that
starred Tommy Handley, an established vaudevillian. For a taste here are
his first words from the first show in mid-September, l939.
''Hello, folks (he chirruped). It's Mein Kampf again. Sorry, I should
say, Hello, folks, it's that man again. That was a Goebbled version, a
bit doctored. I usually go all goosey when I can't follow my proper
gander . . . ''
ITMA's strength lay in the same eccentric characters who uttered the
same magically inane catchphrases. There was Mrs Mopp, still resurrected
by newspaper headline writers for stories about office cleaners. ''Can I
do you now, sir?'' was her invariable cry. There was the inebriate
Colonel (''I don't mind if I do'') Chinstrap. With their aid, Tommy
Handley netted audience figures of l6 million.
A kind of egghead programme called The Brains Trust attained the upper
reaches of ITMA's peak popularity with ll million or so. Sundry
scholars, university chaps, and orchestra conductors answered listeners'
philosophical inquries and daft teasers.
The Brains Trust made unlikely national figures out of some of its
members, notably Professor C E M Joad, who appeared to know everything
and could talk about it in a squeaky voice.
Next to Churchill's, the  most respected radio voice belonged to the
left-wing dramatist and novelist, J B Priestley. In relaxed, warm tones,
Jack Priestley talked about everyday subjects in a matey way. He lifted
hearts. He reminded listeners about why the war had to be won.
Without fuss, his voice was silenced. His Postscript after the Nine
O'Clock News on Sundays was no more. Presumably, he was sometimes too
socialist for some tastes. Priestley believed the BBC had kneeled to
Downing Street's command.
As with most people and organisations, the war brought out the best
and worst of the BBC. About halfway through the war, it had a nervy fit
of jitters. Censorship was applied with a clumsy hand. Jokes were made
taboo about Yankee soldiers, women in uniform, the police, and officers
of the armed forces.
Even Sincerely Yours, a request programme by songstress Vera Lynn, was
found guilty of a sentimentality that weakened the fighting resolve of
the troops and made them dreamy-eyed for home.
But the BBC had what was called ''a good war''. Like other
bureaucracies, it thrived. By VE Day, its output had increased by three
times and its personnel by nearly as much.
Sometimes its dogged patriotism was hard to take. For long enough on
Sunday nights after Postscript musical listeners suffered much because
some corporation bigwig, presumably tone-deaf, thought what a spiffing
idea it would be to play the national anthems of all the Allies one
after another. It was a heavy penalty to pay for victory.
But radio's most serious casualty was William Joyce, otherwise Lord
Haw Haw. A pre-war fascist in Britain, he made propaganda broadcasts in
English on behalf of the Nazis. His aim was to spread alarm and
despondency. By using a crass, aristocratic accent, he sought to divide
the nation. He planted seeds of doubt by mentioning spivs and the black
market, and harped on about profiteering by industrial bandits and
Jewish financiers.
Most listeners found him funny, if less so than Tommy Handley.
Sometimes, though, Haw Haw did seem to know a lot of painful detail
about how much damage the previous night's Luftwaffe bomber raids had
done. Officially, William Joyce was not forgiven. In l946, for treachery
more than for his disservice to broadcasting, he was hanged.

WHEN I was a little boy you had to stand up in the class and stand up
for two minutes in total silence and it was a very serious silence at
that. Everywhere in Britain it was the same. In factories and pits, in
offices, in the streets. Motor cars and trams, and trains, everything
stopped. Housewives doing their shopping, net-bags stuffed with onions
and tins of pineapple, stopped and stood. Old men took their bunnets off
and bowed their heads for two minutes, in total silence. Eleven o'clock
it was. Throughout the entire kingdom little children and old men and
women and everything in between stood in silent homage on the 11th of
November for it was Armistice Day. The anniversary of the time and the
date when the Great War ended.
Every town in Britain has the memorials to that war, especially the
wee towns when entire generations were wiped out. My grandfather, from
Mull, contrived to get wiped out himself along with his two brothers on
the same day, on the same beach, in the same regiment -- The Scottish
Rifles -- in the same war, leaving three bereaved families. So that was
why we bowed our heads on Armistice Day.
As it happens it was somewhat unofficial when I was a little boy
because the 11th November was changed to the second Sunday in that month
and renamed Remembrance Day, in honour of the end of the Second World
War. But for the older generation there was still Armistice Day, and
they observed it and made us all do the same. In the classroom it was
rather poignant because many of the rather feathery old ladies had lost
their sweethearts in the First War. We were standing up and silent for
another generation and a very lost one indeed.
Back then the Second World War wasn't really very far away either.
People of my age group remember the sirens being exercised several times
a year, just to make sure they were still working, just in case. People
born a few years later on don't: but I remember all right. For I was
born during the War, before the War, after the War. The War was never
away from us, my generation. Every conversation seemed to be about it.
Before, During, After: the only word used more often than those three
was War. And no wonder at that.
My father was a professional soldier and a regular. He fought in
France and escaped from Dunkirk. Being a regular he also saw service in
North Africa, Italy, back again in France at D-Day, later at the
crossing of the Rhine (one of the few memories he gave us of his war was
that. He was convinced he would die at the Rhine, said the Germans would
fight to the finish, worried it would be his finish).
Earlier he had been at Dunkirk and though an old soldier, still
thought he would survive. Crossing the the Rhine he had two little boys
by then and a wife and he didn't want to die at all. In Germany he saw
more death then he spoke about. Once only he told me about when he and
his pals liberated Buchenwald. He was a sentimental man but never told
us anything about the war. He wept about Buchenwald and said so little.
My father came back in 1946: I was three. In Germany he had been
billeted with an upper-middle-class German family and the young daughter
played the piano for him and sang lieder. She gave him a silver ring
which my brother still wears. My father was an opera buff, a bit unusual
for a sergeant of a British regiment. The girl's younger brother came
back from the Russian Front, aged 21 and weighing six stones and he
survived, partly through food from my father. The girl who sang lieder
had an elder sister who went on to the world opera stage and my brother
yet wears her little sister's ring. Her sister's name was Elisabeth
Schwarzkopf.
By chance almost the only NCO in the Royal Corps of Signals who was an
opera buff was my father. As he was on the staff of Lord Tedder he was
lucky and so were the Schwarzkopfs but not entirely: Elena died of
consumption shortly before my father was demobbed. I am one of the War
generation.
Buchenwald and young girls dying of tuberculosis is destruction and
dads not telling you anything: I grew up with that. I grew up as part of
a generation really which knew nothing at all about War, always thinking
about it. Standing silent and what's more knowing why we were, on
Armistice Day. In 1946 they changed it to Remembrance Sunday. America
and Canada changed it in 1954 to Veterans' Day. But we are talking now
of V E Day; Victory in Europe. When, after all, the British won.
Lots of Allies were there, but we were there from the start, fighting
against the Nazis and the evil forces. The later years never made so
much of a difference, Labour and the NHS and Mr Attlee and, oh all the
things of the last near 50 years. For we were there and I was there too
on V E Day, hardly aware but still alive because of it all. Entirely
because of it all. Two minutes' silence as child. A dark victory but
needed. A dark silence too. But not as silent as those who fought for
me.

''WE were taken from Glasgow's Govan by bus to a ferry terminal
somewhere down the Clyde coast, where in a rare old state of excitement,
we boarded a boat for the next stage of our journey... Nobody thought to
tell us where we were going - it was wartime after all, and it had
already been instilled into us that 'careless talk costs lives', so we
knew better than to ask any questions... As is so often the way in such
situations, rumour was rife. And no doubt aided by the vivid
imaginations of some of the big girls and 'Qualy boys', we younger weans
were soon in a panic -- totally convinced that we were being kidnapped
by 'thae durty Germans' and never would we see Mammy, Daddy or Glasgow
again.''
Thus Jenny Chaplin recalled her wartime experience of being evacuated
''doon the watter''. It is one of the poignant war memories quoted by
Bob Holman in his new book The Evacuation: A Very British Revolution
(Lion, #14.99).
There is of course no shortage of reminiscences about the mass
dispersal of children from Britain's cities during the Second World War.
Apprehensive youngsters clutching gas masks and being herded on to steam
trains for unknown destinations, are one of the abiding images of the
war years. But Bob Holman's book has a somewhat different focus. It goes
beyond personal recollection and evocation of that fraught period to
argue that the evacuation was a powerful influence on the postwar social
settlement; on the creation, in fact, of the Welfare State. It is not
really a controversial issue, but he makes a compelling case.
Dr Holman is ideally qualified to write this book. A Londoner by
birth, he was evacuated frequently from the age of three. He has also an
academic background in social administration, having been a lecturer at
Glasgow University and professor in the subject at Bath University.
After 11 years in academic life, he felt ''I ought to be practising
what I was preaching'', and left for a community project in a council
estate in Bath. After 11 years this ''was running itself'' and he
decided to move again. Hence his return to Glasgow.
Bob Holman and his Glaswegian wife bought a renovated flat in
Easterhouse and he ''gradually got involved in youth work'', partly
through his contacts with the Salvation Army. ''I had to take it very
slowly, being English,'' he says with a laugh. ''I remember one local
person saying, 'We don't like English people here but it's better than
coming from Edinburgh'.'' Gradually over the weeks and months he thinks
he was accepted. ''We raised money for our project here which is called
FARE.''
FARE has been mainly involved in youth work and at its height had
three workers, seeing some ''300 kids a week''. Last year, lack of
finance led to its staff being cut to one. ''I couldn't be the one,''
explains Dr Holman. So he has been working on a child-care research
project in Manchester during the week and returning to Easterhouse at
the weekends.
With this background in community concern, both academic and
practical, and his particular interest in child-care, it's no surprise
that Bob Holman decided to write his book. He draws on primary as well
as published sources. One point he makes may not be generally known --
that there were distinct waves of evacuation, the first large-scale one
taking place in the phoney war, the later ones reflecting the Blitz and
the hazards of doodle-bugs and V1 and V2 rockets.
The first evacuation dealt with incredibly large numbers. Within three
days of war being declared, 1,473,391 children, mothers, and teachers
left Britain's cities, while between June and September, 1939, two
million other people, many adult, evacuated themselves privately. No
wonder there were often inadequate arrangements, both at the travelling
stage (lack of lavatories on trains) and on arrival, and a build-up of
resentments on the part of those who had to accommodate the evacuees.
There were specific problems -- including an apparent tidal wave of
bedwetting. In Cambridge such was the uproar against enuresis that a
researcher noted the evacuation appeared to have ''produced a Niagara
all over English and Scottish country beds.''
This was fortunately a problem that eventually cleared up. ''It was
perfectly natural; you're taken away from your mum and dad in wartime;
it's going to have some emotional effect on you,'' says Dr Holman. He
also points out that the evacuees were mainly working-class children who
tended to go either to middle-class homes in the country or at least to
people not used to city conditions. Hence some foster parents complained
initially about nits, lice, children's manners and aggressive behaviour,
as well as bed-wetting.
''As time went on,'' Dr Holman continues in happier vein, ''that faded
and foster parents began to look very positively towards evacuees.''
Some indeed ''became the kind of lobby for improved conditions which
partly led to the Welfare State legislation straight after the war.''
There were some tragically ironic features of the evacuation: children
were torpedoed on their way to supposed safety in Canada; Clydebank
children had returned from their initial evacuation when the savage
bombing of the town took place. Does Dr Holman consider evacuation was a
responsible, indeed inevitable, policy on the part of the Government?
He ponders his reply. It was not inevitable. Germany did not have a
similar policy. He thinks it was a responsible policy ''and undoubtedly
saved lives.'' The loss of life - 6000-7000 - was comparatively small
compared with the killing power of the V1s and V2s and the tens of
thousands lost in Germany.
But it was the changes in social attitudes and expectations
accompanying evacuation that were so significant. And the powerful
factor of much greater acceptance of collective provision.
Dr Holman points out, fairly, that some at least of the provisions of
the Welfare State (for example family allowances) and the Butler
Education Act of 1944 were initiated by the wartime Coalition Government
before the Labour landslide of 1945.
Beveridge had reported as far back as 1942. Thanks in large measure to
the evacuation experience, the mechanism for the National Health Service
had already come into being. Child-care social workers were ready for a
new service by the end of the war. Seven hundred residential children's
homes had been created. And, most importantly, children were on the
national agenda in a way not conceivable in 1939.
The evacuation tale told, Dr Holman - still the realistic idealist and
still revealing traces of his Ilford accent - returns to present-day
Easterhouse. He commends the many stable families and the hundreds of
voluntary groups in what he describes as ''a place of strength'' but one
lacking employment.

SHANKS' PONY
Memories of the Scottish mountains were a source of solace during the
war years recalls Peter Evans.
THE high, wild places of Scotland, the beauty of strath and glen, have
long been an attraction to city dwellers hemmed in by an urban
environment. The desire for escape -- freedom to wander in the open air
-- is a powerful one.
It was never more so than in the thirties, before the outbreak of the
Second World War, when city folk took to the countryside in their
hundreds.
The experiences of climbing, walking, and adventure, laid down in
their memories then, were to provide great comfort and solace through
the six years of conflict that followed from 1939. On the battlefield
and in prisoner of war camps, in pain and anguish, images of the
mountains helped soothe troubled minds and aching bodies.
Those with the talent for it wrote, providing us with some of our most
endearing and enduring mountaineering literature: books that have become
classics with the passage of years.
Mountaineering in Scotland is such a book. It's author, W H Murray,
was one of a small group of climbers who led the renaissance of severe
Scottish winter climbing in the period 1935-49. He wrote the first draft
in prison camps after being captured by the Germans during the Africa
campaign in 1942, but it was seized by the Gestapo, who thought it
contained a form of coded propoganda. Fortunately, Murray's memories
were vivid enough to go through the exercise all over again, and his
seminal work, published in 1947, has been an inspiration to thousands of
mountaineers since.
Capturing perfectly the mood and feeling of the mountaineer, Murray
writes: ''Life is seen detachedly and in proper perspective from the
mountain-tops. Whoever climbs cliffs to the summit cairn will find that
the joys and sorrows of his everyday life have been left deep below in
the valleys; they have shed off like a husk; and he, the new man, may
survey as from afar his daily round of thoughts, errors, resolves and
behaviour with the inward calm of a critic inspecting a stranger.
''And it is wonderful what a different complexion is then put upon
affairs that he thought of consequence. In the quiet of his inner
detachment his higher self is awakened; it rises above fatigue and
discomfort to enjoy beauty, breaks the fetters that enslave it to bodily
desires and environment, rules inwardly.
''Were a man to achieve little else in life he would, nonetheless, in
achieving this, possess a pearl of great price -- an undivided mind and
the peace that is true freedom.''
That freedom was to be snatched from Murray on the battlefields of the
African desert and then in three years of degradation in the overcrowded
prison camps of Italy and Germany.
His battalion had been whittled down to 50 men and they were waiting,
with the rest of their brigade, for an attack at dusk by the 15th Panzer
division. ''By tonight you'll be either dead meat or a prisoner,'' he
was told by a brutally frank battalion commander.
The tanks rolled in and Murray fortunately fell prey to the second of
his commander's predictions. The German tank commander who took charge
of him waved a pistol and asked, in good English, if he didn't feel the
cold in the desert night air.
''It's as cold as a mountain top,'' replied Murray, prompting the
response: ''Good God! do you climb?'' The German was a mountaineer and,
after an exchange about mountains both men knew and liked in Scotland
and the Alps, gave Murray his overcoat and food. Then they shared a
bottle of British beer to the German's toast: ''Here's to mountains and
to mountaineers -- to all of them, everywhere.'' The fellowship of
mountaineers is universal.
Another classic piece of literature to come out of the war, this time
written by a very well kent face, is Highland Days, by Tom Weir. Most of
it was written during active service in the Royal Artillery, between
1940-46.
Born in Springburn, Glasgow, in 1914, Weir belonged to the first
generation of working class outdoor men who sought the freedom of the
hills around the city and further afield. ''The smoke of Glasgow and the
city's prison of drab tenements are themselves a driving force to
escape, though we had never heard of escapism when, as youngsters in
torn and patched breeks, we went out to find the green places that are
everywhere on the outskirts of our city,'' writes Weir.
From the Campsies, the Kilpatricks, the Trossachs, and the ''Arrochar
Alps,'' Weir and dozens of like-minded compatriots ventured further
afield to the Highlands, their modes of transport the bicycle, the tram,
the bus and the train.
An edition of The Glasgow Herald of November, 1932, reported on an
annual meeting of the National Council of the Scottish Ramblers'
Federation in Edinburgh -- the first of its kind.
Elected president William Power deplored the system of private estate
ownership which, he said, had resulted in areas of wild scenery in the
Highlands being made inaccessible to travellers, with large numbers of
peaks over 3000 feet being out of bounds.
But the precedent had been set, and although the Second World War
largely stopped the outdoor movement in its tracks, it resumed after
1945. The issue of The Glasgow Herald of February 5 that year, records
plans by the Scottish Ramblers' Federation ''to facilitate enjoyment of
the countryside around Glasgow.
''It is proposed to have 12 sites around Glasgow, all within walking
distance of tram termini, in which young people would be invited to camp
out and would be taught by experts the arts of living in the open air.''
Fifty years later, it is intriguing to note that Scottish Natural
Heritage, the Government quango set up in 1992 to facilitate enjoyment
of the Scottish countryside, last October proposed a ''Paths for All''
initiative, designed to improve path networks close to conurbations.
As their own personal means of celebrating VE Day, some people will no
doubt decide to walk up a hill somewhere in Scotland. In doing so, they
may well be rekindling memories which helped sustain them through days
of conflict.

Paul Young champions a confidence shared among anglers with the
arrival of top-quality selections of flies.
I'M sure we have all been on an unfamiliar trout or salmon water and
wished we had the guiding touch of an invisible expert with us to give
that most important of all fishing commodities . . . confidence.
Many people have, over the years, given the angler something on which
to rely. Canon Greenwell's glorious little concoction has often
bolstered a trout fisherman's day and Mr Kynoch's version of a diving
plug has brought the tyro a first Tay salmon. Though I have never met
either gentlemen, I am always happy to have the legacies of their
inventive minds with me on the water.
So, it gives me double pleasure to have equal faith in the products of
the talents of a couple of people I do know. My latter day
confidence-boosting versions of Greenwell and Kynoch are Headley and
Bryson. Both are innovative in the matter of tackle and both are keen
fishers.
Trout first, Stan Headley lives in Orkney, was the winner of the 1990
Scottish National Trout Fly Fishing Competition at Loch Leven and is an
intuitive fisher and inventive tier of flies. His many articles on trout
fishing and fly-tying are informative and widely read, so he naturally
receives many requests to tie old favourites and his new inventions.
Time has precluded this in the past, but there is good news for those
who would like to try the Claret Bumble, Doobry, Fleeuck, or Aberdeen
Angus.
Stan has trained seven local girls to tie flies to his specifications
and in his own style. These are all tied on the best hand-crafted
British hooks, using genuine materials and are now available in boxed
sets. There are three wet-fly selections, a mini-Muddler, and a
stillwater dry-fly selection, and come in a spread of the most useful
sizes, 10, 12 and 14.
They are beautifully presented in mahogany boxes with a waterproof
laminated insert showing a photograph of each pattern and giving advice
on how, where and when to fish them. The sets have been designed to
produce a balanced selection which should provide the answer to almost
any question asked of the stillwater angler. As Stan says, ''It's a bit
like having a ghillie in your pocket.''
Of the 15 wet flies, seven are Stan's originals, as are all the
mini-Muddlers and half of the dries. The boxed selections sell for
#29.50 plus p &amp; p and individual flies are also available at #1 each,
plus p &amp; p. Stan also fishes for salmon and a salmon selection, all
Shrimp patterns, is also available. You'll find the incredibly
successful Ally, plus black, claret and yellow variations, in sizes six,
eight and 10. These cost #39.50 with single flies costing #2, again plus
p &amp; p.
Talking of salmon, Alan Bryson knows a thing or two about how to
produce fish-catching lures. His Salmo Devons are well proven on all
Scottish rivers. They come in both floating and sinking varieties from
four to 37 gms in weight and myriad hue. Both the wooden floaters and
the copper-lined sinkers are hand finished and with primer, paint and
lacquer, may have as many as 11 coats. Pick from an inch and a half to
four inches and, depending on water and time of year, you are well
covered with beautifully crafted lures for every occasion.
Alan's ''Seeka'' lures, deep-diving trolling and harling versions of
the American ''Lucky Louie,'' are again hand finished and the boat
fisher will feel confident with one digging deep at any time of the
season.
But the latest invention, Alan's ''Tadpole'' lure is perhaps the most
exciting. This gives the angler a combination of the characteristics of
the Devon and the Flying-C . . . the best of both worlds. The Tadpole
has taken fish all over, the Tay, the Tyne and the Slaney, to mention a
few.
Alan's design is registered through the Patent Office, number 2042709,
and consists of an acorn-shaped, finned Devon head with a latex-covered
metal tube tail, which splays out on retrieve to offset the effect of
the weighted head and makes the bait swim on an even keel. Again these
come in a variety of weights: nine, 11, 14, 20 and 27 gms at around
#3.00, and the floating versions will soon be on the market for
approximately the same price.
These flies and lures catch fish. That has been proved all over
Scotland and further afield. So, we anglers can now have these invisible
experts with us whenever we fish with Stan or Alan's inventions. A
modest price to pay for that all important confidence in our tackle and,
I'd suggest, if you buy a few, or many, of each, as well as catching
fish, you'll have the extra pleasure of knowing that you are supporting
Scottish cottage industries. You are thereby returning to them the
confidence they gave you.
* Headley Gamefishing Ltd., is at Glebe Mill, Evied, Orkney, KW17 2PH,
01856 751435 and Alan Bryson's Salmo Lures can be ordered from 01738
553506.

The French capital is a very different city from the one Hitler
strolled through in 1940, reports Nicholas Powell, yet it still
qualifies as T S Eliot's 'strong stimulus' despite the transformation.
THE chief danger about Paris, T S Eliot said back in 1921, ''is that
it is such a strong stimulus and like most stimulants incites to rushing
about''. When I quoted that puritan consideration some years back to the
writer Philippe Sollers, he replied: ''I don't see why Eliot was
bothered about there being distractions -- one pays attention to them or
one doesn't.''
With high unemployment, growing problems of poverty and homelessness,
and a muted anxiety and sourness visible on so many faces in this city,
Paris still qualifies as ''a strong stimulus''. Albeit one that has been
transformed over the years.
People who knew Paris 50 years ago have mixed feelings about that
development. My mother-in-law, who came down from her Picardy farm to
get clothes tailored, says keeping chic during the occupation was a
vital way of keeping going: couturiers and milliners made do with all
sorts of scraps and the result was a sort of impudent, shortage-defying
elegance. But that smartness of the Parisienne, she says, has
disappeared. Annie, a friend who survived in Paris during the war and
remembers platform soles made from car tyres, the absence of buses,
getting home by the last Metro before the Nazi curfew, and the gaiety of
the Liberation, agrees: Parisian women no longer have that extra flair.
Fifty years ago, alcohol suddenly became freely available again. An
acquaintance who returned from fighting in Germany remembers hard
drinking going on in the bars and cabarets of the Left Bank district of
Saint-Germain-des-Pres. It is there, now that nightlife has migrated
elsewhere, that many of France's major publishers set up. And it was in
the Cafe des Deux Magots at Saint-German-des-Pres that Philippe Sollers
explained to me how much editorial business in Paris is in fact carried
out in cafes.
Annie did not frequent Saint Germain but, with other middle-class
youngsters, went late on Saturday nights to rue de Lappe near La
Bastille, a street famed for its working-class dives and its
prostitution. There she and her girlfriends danced with the ''marlous'',
the pimps, while their boyfriends sat out the early hours as
wallflowers, too intimidated to move.
''The marlous invited us to dance with a flick of the finger -- they
never spoke. They kept their cloth caps on, squeezed us tight, reeked of
Gauloises cigarettes and were ill-shaven. It was just marvellous,'' she
recollected.
Nightclubs nowadays are all over town, although a decade of marriage
has blunted my vision of things. There are the chic, expensive clubs for
the moneyed and the fashionable -- Castel, founded in Saint-Germain in
1957, Regine's, and the Arc, a new boite near the Arc de Triomphe, for
example. For the seriously with-it, but not necessarily rich, there are
the truly hip bars: Les Bains, a bar-restaurant and discotheque, on the
rue du Bourg l'Abbe, the recently renovated Bataclan, on boulevard
Voltaire, and the mainly gay Queen on the Champs-Elysees. Music is
techno, rap, jungle, and ragamuffin, with ''revival evenings''
charitably organised for older people like me who can remember the
Rolling Stones and the Supremes.
Half a century ago, Paris was much dirtier: major monuments were
cleaned for the first time in the 1960s, thanks to France's first-ever
Culture Minister, General de Gaulle's Andre Malraux. And it was only
after the war that property owners became obliged to clean the faades of
apartment blocks -- a costly obligation -- every 10 years.
The population has declined and become more prosperous. Many
working-class people have been forced out of the east end of the city
into the suburbs by property redevelopment and rising rents. Nowadays
the rue de Lappe is full of tapas bars and art galleries. The Belleville
district up in the north-east, the birthplace of music-hall singer
Maurice Chevalier, famed before the war for its cafes and cabarets, has
been almost entirely rebuilt. As a result you rarely hear ''parigot'',
the Parisian accent and Parisian slang, in the city any more: a whole
linguistic and cultural dimension of the city's life has been eradicated
over the past half-century more surely than the slums. I got my first,
informal lessons in Paris slang 20 years ago from a restaurant
dishwasher and reformed Montparnasse streetwalker nicknamed Bonheur,
''Happiness''. The language she taught me can only be picked up nowadays
on 1930s' films and on pre-war records of music-hall songs.
After the Vietnam war, immigrants from France's former colony gave
Paris a huge number of Vietnamese restaurants. By concentrating in the
13th arrondissement, the immigrants gave the city its first Chinatown.
Some pockets in Parisian working-class districts, meanwhile, have been
taken over by immigrant North African workers, invited over as unskilled
labour to help in the postwar reconstruction of France, poorly housed
and then left to their own devices. Barbes, just to the east of Pigalle,
is such a place -- almost exclusively North African and seriously
run-down, despite City Hall efforts to rebuild and relodge.
It was in Barbes, in the infamous rue de la Goutte d'Or (''street of
the drop of gold'', such a poetic name for a slum), before President
Giscard d'Estaing in the 1970s clamped down on hotel prostitution, that
you had to zigzag along the street through queues of workers who were
waiting their turns in the hotels. A few years later, for The Herald, I
interviewed Pigalle prostitutes who had worked there: 70 clients a day
was routine and the women, although underworld ''loi du silence''
stopped them saying so, were sent there by their pimps as a punishment.
It was during the 1970s that the city's traditional pissotieres for
men (Parisian women were never catered for) were demolished. Elaborate
nineteenth-century cast-iron constructions, painted dark green and
plastered with posters, they reeked and were a popular haunt of
homosexuals, who called them ''tasses'', from the verb meaning ''to
squeeze''. Older gays often have sentimental recollections about how
exciting they were. I only know one surviving pissotiere, next to the
Sante prison in the south of Paris.
For the past 10 years we have had two-franc-a-go ''superloos'' which
wash and scrub themselves clean after each visit but which many people
are frightened of using for fear of getting locked in.
When brothels in France were closed down by law in 1946, Paris lost
more than a thousand establishments which had catered for men from all
walks of life. Edward VII, while Prince of Wales, had his favourite, le
Chabanais, frequented by the very rich and titled. Brothels were a
fixture of masculine life, an initiation for young men, the inevitable
temptation for the provincial in town, and in many cases a sort of
gentleman's club used for socialising as well as whoring. It is one of
my great regrets that I have never been in one.
Nowadays Pigalle is a dismal accumulation of sex shops and sex
theatres, their posters barely changed over the past decade since I had
a flat there. Most prostitutes work in squalid little bed-sits along the
rue Saint Denis, the centre of Paris prostitution since the Middle Ages,
when city regulations obliged them to dye their hair red and be real
scarlet women.
In 50 years, Paris has lost most of its other famous womenfolk, the
legendary and ferocious concierges, made redundant by efficient refuse
collection and the invention of the coded ground-floor door. It has
acquired a huge number of dogs, as half of all the flats in Paris are
occupied by single people and dogs outnumber children. Turds underfoot
are a constant hazard and City Hall, rather than lose voters by imposing
dog licences or, even better, banning the creatures altogether, has
spent millions on men in green uniforms on motorbikes who rev their
engines madly to scoop up poops through plastic tubes, replacing one
form of pollution with another. They gather near our house to wash their
equipment at a water main, like gazelles round an oasis.
Other, broader political considerations have altered the face of Paris
over the years. President Pompidou, otherwise a genuinely cultivated
man, wanted to make the capital more accessible to the motor car and
favoured high-rise building. During his stay in office (1969-74)
building began on the Montparnasse tower of offices. For many years the
tallest building in Europe, this hideous pile dominates the entire
Montparnasse area. Under Pompidou, high-rise apartment blocks also shot
up downstream from Montparnasse, just past the Eiffel Tower in the 15th
arrondissement. And to open Paris up to the motor car, express roads
were carved along the right bank of the Seine and part of the Left Bank,
which is fortunately now preserved from further mutilation by its Unesco
classification on the list of world heritage.
Economic development has changed the face of Paris, too. The creation
of the Orly and Charles de Gaulle airports has vastly increased
international air traffic. High-rise offices have been built in La
Defense, which was connected to the west of Paris by motorway. Bercy, in
the east of Paris, once the wine-trading centre of the country, closed
down. In the north-east of the city, the abattoirs of La Villette, once
the heart of France's meat industry, were shut and abandoned until the
1980s. A spanking new science museum was built on the site, which the
Queen was taken to see during her state visit in June, 1992.
''How strange to begin one's visit with an abattoir . . . . ,'' she
confided to me the next morning, during a meeting with the press.
In addition to inefficient and short-sighted redevelopment, Paris has
suffered from major acts of urban delinquency. In the late 1960s, Les
Halles, ''the belly of Paris'', the overcrowded fruit and vegetable
markets housed in superb cast-iron pavilions designed by the
nineteenth-century architect Baltard, were moved out to Rungis, south of
the city. In 1970, the pavilions were occupied by theatres, cafes, and
improvised shops and the surrounding district was lively with all-night
bars.
The pavilions were simply demolished, leaving a hole in the ground
which for years simply grew larger and larger -- ''le trou des Halles'',
the Halles hole, it was called. Inside, they built a station for the new
high-speed suburban train, the RER. On top, in 1977, they finally built
a ghastly sunken shopping centre, le Forum des Halles. The belly of
Paris is now occupied by underground boutiques.
The opening of the Georges Pompidou arts centre in 1976, in what had
been a quaint, somewhat faded district near Les Halles, had already
started attracting visitors and encouraging a gentrification of the
area. Renovation of the superb seventeenth-century townhouses in the
nearby Marais district began in earnest about the same time.
Thanks to the RER station in the former hole, Paris was linked to its
outlying suburbs by a cheap, fast, and frequent train service. Les
Halles on Saturdays is now one vast churning mass of people, many of
them heading underground to Le Forum des Halles, incidentally a major
centre for the city's trade in hard drugs.
The Champs-Elysees has changed for similar reasons. The RER brings in
crowds from the western suburbs straight to the Arc de Triomphe. The
most famous avenue in the world, recently renovated at great expense by
City Hall, is packed with fast-food restaurants, cinemas, and pricey
cafes. The last smart restaurant, Fouquet's, only escaped a fate worse
than conversion into a hamburger joint a few years ago thanks to a
preservation order slapped on it by Socialist minister Jack Lang.
One political change which has had a massive effect on Paris was the
creation of the post of Mayor of the City in 1976. Jacques Chirac has
held the job ever since, using it and its perks -- reception of
important foreign visitors, for example -- to build up his own influence
and cock a snook at political enemies in the Elysee, first President
Valery Giscard d'Estaing and then President Franois Mitterrand.
Apart from introducing those infuriating and noisy motorcycle
dog-dropping scoopers, Mr Chirac has been responsible for major cosmetic
change in Paris. The city is endowed with less greenery than most, but
its gardens and squares are extremely well tended. Its streets and
pavements are regularly cleaned, the city is well lit at night, and
refuse collection is highly efficient. Paris as a bohemian city of
yawning dustbins slumped against lampposts and open refuse vans is a
thing of the past.
Mr Chirac has frequently warred with President Mitterrand over the
latter's ''grands travaux'', the ambitious building projects costing
some #3000m undertaken in Paris during his 14 years of Socialist
presidency. The Mayor of Paris has only won in one case, scuppering an
international conference centre due to be built near the Eiffel Tower.
But thanks to the Socialist Government, and despite fierce political
opposition, we now have the Bastille Opera, built on the site of a
disused railway station, the immense new national library, due to open
to the public in two years' time and which so shames Britain's
stop-start equivalent at St Pancras, the Science Museum, and the Cite de
la Musique admired by the Queen at La Villette.
President Mitterrand will also leave Paris with the Orsay Museum
(started by his predecessor President Giscard d'Estaing) devoted to
nineteenth-century art, the Institut du Monde Arabe, a renovated Natural
History Museum, a new Ministry of Finances and, of course, the Louvre:
not only the glass pyramid entrance but the splendid new hall underneath
and the entirely refashioned Richelieu wing, making it the biggest and
best museum there is in the world.
Those projects, which have done more to change Paris since Napoleon
III's architect Baron Haussmann drove through the existing boulevard
network in the middle of last century, will never be equalled by any
other European government and have conferred on Paris an undisputed
architectural and intellectual chic. They draw millions of tourists from
throughout the world to a city whose inhabitants are reputedly rude, but
who are in reality brusque and quick-talking. They must be forgiven, for
few of us were actually born in this city, which, to complete the T S
Eliot quote with which I started, ''like most stimulants, incites to
rushing about and produces a pleasant illusion of great mental activity
rather than the results of hard work''.

General Sir Michael Gow remembers clearly how he heard the momentous
news 50 years ago. He told Christopher Reekie of the celebrations.
GENERAL Sir Michael Gow was fighting with the Scots Guards in Germany
when he heard that the war in Europe was over. Sir Michael, then a
lieutenant, was with the regiment's 3rd (tank) battalion in the village
of Siebeneichen, in the Hamburg-Lubeck area, when a radio broadcast at
9pm on May 4, 1945, gave the momentous news.
''Within 10 minutes,'' he recalls, ''there was a fusillade. Every
machine gun, sten gun, smoke bomb, and Very pistol was loosed off,
making all the noises of battle. Everybody was absolutely thrilled.
''Then, I remember, we moved into a little hollow just outside the
village where there was a vast bonfire. How it started I don't know, but
it contained furniture, farm carts, and even an old lorry. We all
thought this was absolutely fantastic. We sang and clapped and cheered.
''Then the commanding officer called for silence. He spoke very
movingly, and told us to remember always our fallen comrades. That is
how I remember the actual moment. It was a great relief, because the
Germans, although they knew defeat was imminent, fought practically to
the end with amazing ferocity.''
Sir Michael remembers ''happiness, relief that it was over, sadness
for friends who had been killed, and also, I suppose, an awareness of
the responsibilities ahead''.
The Scots Guards had advanced from Normandy through Belgium and
Holland and into Germany across the Rhine. After capturing Munster and
Minden in April, they approached Celle with 227th brigade of the 15th
Scottish division.
The country on the approach to the Elbe was difficult and densely
wooded, with craters, mines, plus bazooka parties hiding among the
trees. ''It was jolly tough going,'' Sir Michael said, laconically now.
By April 21, the whole division had reached the Elbe, and the
battalion was withdrawn temporarily to a village called Bevenson. It was
learned that Belsen had been liberated and was not far away. Sir Michael
and the battalion's second-in-command, Major William Whitelaw, later
Lord Whitelaw, visited the concentration camp -- ''something I shall
never ever forget''.
As the Scots Guards advanced, all the houses in the villages through
which they passed had white sheets of surrender hanging out of the
windows. The soldiers found a mixture of confusion and centres of
civilisation untouched by war.
An important requirement was to get Allied troops into place to
prevent the Russians entering Denmark. The Scots Guards crossed the Elbe
and moved into Schleswig-Holstein, not far from Kiel. ''Some of the
people were absolutely terrified that we were going and the Russians
were coming in. They were far more frightened of the Russians than they
were of us.''
When Sir Michael was escorting German prisoners of war, he met an
officer who had been a Rhodes scholar at Oxford at the same time as Sir
Michael's brother, killed at Arnhem the year before. The officer asked:
''How soon do you think it will be before you and I are standing
shoulder to shoulder against the Russians?'', a question Sir Michael
greeted incredulously.
The German said: ''You're not nearly as intelligent as your brother
was.''
Sir Michael went to Berlin in November, 1945, to take part in meetings
with the Russians, when the idea was that the four Great Powers would
work together. But it soon became clear to him that ''it wasn't to be
like that at all''. The Russians were very suspicious of the Western
Allies' intentions.
Looking back to the war, Sir Michael says: ''I think the funny thing
about those days is that, logically, we hadn't a hope. The army had lost
all its weapons at Dunkirk. But it never, ever occurred to any of us
that we weren't going to win. I think that was because we were inspired
by Churchill.''
Sir Michael enlisted as an ordinary guardsman in 1942, and was made an
officer in 1943. He was a Scots Guardsman for 44 years, longer than
anyone since the regiment was formed in 1642, and achieved the unique
distinction of serving in its five battalions. When he retired in 1986,
he was the last member of the armed forces still on duty who had served
in the war.
Now living in Edinburgh, Sir Michael is president of the Royal British
Legion (Scotland) and of the Earl Haig Fund. He is concentrating on the
commemorations of VE and VJ Days. This weekend he is in London for the
gathering in Hyde Park attended by Heads of State from many countries
and the service of thanksgiving in St Paul's. On Monday, he will be in
Edinburgh at the service of thanksgiving in St Giles'.
When VJ Day is commemorated, Sir Michael will lead a contingent of
veterans from Scotland in London on August 19, and will be back in
Edinburgh the next day for a service at St Giles and a sunset ceremony
on the esplanade of the castle.

After being ordered to take an early bath, wartime football came back
on to be an unofficial morale-booster. Jim Reynolds looks at the state
of play.
WHEN war broke out, Clyde were in possession of the Scottish Cup,
having beaten Motherwell 4-0 at Hampden some months before, and they
were to hold the old trophy for eight years.
Yes, folks, it's a record -- no other club has kept the precious metal
that long!
Accrington Stanley were leaders in the English League Division Three
(North) . . . and Rangers led the Scottish League Division A by a point
from Falkirk.
Clubs such as King's Park, St Bernard's, Edinburgh City, and Leith
Athletic were still in existence. Rutherglen Glencairn were holders of
the Scottish Junior Cup, and Blackpool were leaders in the English First
Division.
In accordance with a Government regulation, a total ban on football
followed the declaration of war.
The ban, however, didn't last long, for the Government appreciated the
need for recreation to continue as normally as possible. As well as
helping maintain physical fitness, it was seen as a stimulus to morale
among the people.
The SFA had ruled that all players' registrations be cancelled when
the league programme was terminated after just five matches -- which led
to great freedom of movement for those footballers who were not on
active service.
For football was to continue throughout the war years, albeit in an
unofficial capacity, and when the go-ahead was given, things quickly
fell into place.
The Scottish League met on October 11 and the new set-up kicked off 10
days later with the country divided into East and West regional leagues
of 16 clubs each.
At first it was agreed to limit the number of fans in every part of
Britain to avoid large crowds travelling. For the first six months,
crowds in evacuation areas were limited to 15,000. This was eased when
the expected blitzkrieg failed to materialise.
The Scottish set-up for the first season was: East Region -- Aberdeen,
Alloa, Arbroath, Cowdenbeath, Dundee, Dundee United, Dunfermline, East
Fife, Falkirk, Hearts, Hibernian, King's Park, St Bernard's, St
Johnstone, Stenhousemuir, Raith Rovers.
West Region -- Airdrie, Albion Rovers, Ayr United, Celtic, Clyde,
Dumbarton, Hamilton, Kilmarnock, Morton, Motherwell, Partick Thistle,
Queen of the South, Queen's Park, Rangers, St Mirren, Third Lanark.
Rangers won the West section, while Falkirk took the East group, and
in the deciding play-off, the Glasgow side won 2-1 at Ibrox.
An Emergency War Cup was also played for during that first season and
the finalists were Rangers and Dundee United.
By this time players were making guest appearances for clubs and there
was a shock move by Airdrie, who played Dundee United in the semi-final
of the War Cup.
After a 0-0 draw at Easter Road, Airdrie announced that they had
persuaded Stanley Matthews -- who was later to ''guest'' for other
Scottish clubs, including Rangers and Hibs -- to travel north to play
for them in the replay.
The move, however, backfired, with United winning 3-1, and the
People's Journal reporter wrote:''The task of stopping Matthews was
given to an almost unknown laddie, Tommy Dunsmore, who had taken over
from Jerry Kerr, who was injured. Airdrie might have saved the expense
of bringing the maestro north. He did give us some brilliant touches,
but he found his match in young Tommy. And this boy accomplished what
Scottish international backs could not.''
Young Tommy, as it turned out, was never to play for Scotland.
The final took place at Hampden on May 4, 1940, with Rangers winning
1-0 by virtue of a Jimmy Smith goal. The crowd had officially been
restricted to 75,000, but, when the gates had to be closed, there were
those who reckoned that more than 90,000 were in the old ground.
For the rest of the war, a Southern League of 16 teams (including
Hibernian and Hearts) was in operation and a Northern League of just
eight clubs, with Rangers reserves competing. Rangers dominated in the
south, and their supremacy was down to the great Bill Struth, who saw
his duty as producing entertainment and winning sides.
In the six seasons of ''unofficial'' football, Rangers' trophy haul
was: War Cups -- two. West League -- one. Southern League -- five.
Summer Cup -- one. League Cup -- three.
Other Summer Cup winners were Hibernian, St Mirren, Motherwell, and
Partick Thistle, while Hibernian also won a League Cup.
Struth's forward thinking was the base on which Rangers built their
domination of Scottish football in the years after the war.
Guest players, such as Torry Gillick and Jimmy Caskie, of Everton,
were happy to join the club on a full-time basis, joining Shaw,
Woodburn, Waddell, Thornton, and company.
International matches were also organised as part of the war effort,
and although Scotland suffered some severe lessons from the English,
probably the most memorable of the wartime internationals was staged at
Hampden on April 18, 1942, when 91,000 saw Scotland beat England 5-4.
The Scottish line-up was: Dawson, Carabine, Beattie, Shankly, Smith,
Busby, Waddell, Herd, Dodds, Bremner, Liddell.
It was Billy Liddell's debut for Scotland and he celebrated by
scoring, adding to one by Bill Shankly and a hat-trick from Jock Dodds.
Tommy Lawton scored a hat-trick for the English, whose other goal came
from Jimmy Hagan.
The Scots were not given such cause to celebrate again until they won
the home international championship in the first season of normal
football after the war.
It was all unofficial, of course, but whenever the history books are
rewritten, they will tell you that football, and other sports, did their
part for the war effort between 1939 and 1945.

Ian Bruce records that, though the global slaughter stopped,
individual countries continued with a will.
IF World War One was supposed to be the ''war to end wars'', then
World War Two was its second house, and a bloodier affair by far. The
slaughter of the trenches on a single, continuous front gave way to
higher-tech killing on a worldwide stage.
And this time around, it was civilian populations which took the brunt
of the casualties in what proved to be a radical alteration to the very
nature of warfare. This time it was total. Entire populations were
propelled, effectively, into the front line.
About 20,000,000 people died in the first conflict. Most of them were
active participants -- soldiers, sailors and airmen. Military losses in
the second were a mere 15,000,000 by comparison, but an estimated
34,000,000 civilians paid the ultimate penalty of being caught up in
global war.
Disease, starvation and ill-treatment accounted for most of those,
although the new phenomenon of strategic bombing and the targeting of
key industries as a means of prosecuting political aims cost millions of
innocent lives.
Stalin's brutal repression of his own people killed almost as many
civilians as the German invasion of the Soviet Union. More than
10,000,000 Russians -- including the cream of the Red Army's officer
corps -- were ''liquidated'' by the NKVD, the Soviet Gestapo, or
perished in Siberian labour camps.
Even when it was supposedly all over, the world had again divided
itself into armed camps. The new superpowers, America and the Soviet
Union, now began a series of proxy wars which killed an estimated
20,000,000 people in just over four decades of remote-control
confrontation.
When nuclear weapons reduced the probable outcome of a direct clash in
Europe to a ''no-win'' scenario for both sides, they armed allies and
erstwhile enemies from the Horn of Africa to Nicaragua and let battle
commence anew. It was prime-time for the testing of new weapons systems
and the arms trade boomed.
If the death tolls for the scores of ethnic conflicts, civil wars and
terrorist outrages are added on, the tally to 1995 cannot be far short
of 30,000,000 dead.
Britain alone has sent armed forces to 70 major and minor league
conflicts since the end of World War Two. British squaddies have fallen
in battle in everything from the Mau Mau tribal uprising in Kenya in
1952 to the friendly-fire incident of the Gulf War in 1991 and the
perils of peacekeeping in war-torn Yugoslavia in 1994. In between,
Korea, Cyprus, Malaya, the Falklands and Northern Ireland have kept the
UK's military establishment occupied worldwide.
For the West, Korea and Vietnam were turning points in the fight
against what was perceived as the spread of international Communism. The
slogging match on the Korean peninsula cost the United Nations 100,000
dead, of which 34,000 were American. The North Koreans and their Chinese
''volunteer'' allies lost 1,500,000 men.
But it was Vietnam which had a more profound influence on direct US
military involvement elsewhere and brought the ''bodybag factor'' into
play in national politics for the first time.
'Nam was a 10,000-day war which defied logic and gave heart and
comfort to guerrilla movements everywhere. Mainly lightly-armed peasant
armies harassed the Japanese, made the British decide to leave with
unseemly haste, humiliated the French in open battle and finally forced
a US withdrawal through a combination of attrition and astutely applied
propaganda.
The debacle claimed 47,000 American lives. More than 1,000,000 North
Vietnamese and 400,000 of their southern brethren also died. Militarily,
it was a sound and costly defeat for Hanoi. Politically, it was a
stunning victory.
It was the war which brought the helicopter gunship and heli-borne air
cavalry into play for the first time. It was also the first television
war which beamed what became known as the ''watch-'em-die, watch-'em
fry'' show into millions of US homes on the nightly news.
An essentially gullible American public finally wearied of of its sons
dying for a spurious cause in a country ruled by an even more spurious
regime. The fall-out from the decision to abandon Vietnam to its fate
gave the US military an inferiority complex which took almost 20 years
and the defeat of Iraq in 1991 to live down.
But the West escaped relatively lightly in these years. The Chinese
civil war in 1946 which eventually brought Mao Tse Tung to power killed
2,000,000. A further 1,500,000 to 2,000,000 died in the savage
suppression of Biafra's attempted succession from Nigeria. Genocide in
Cambodia's killing fields wiped out another 2,000,000 and deprived the
country of a generation of its brightest and best.
Iran and Iraq hacked at each other for eight, long, bloody years. The
basic military tactic of both sides was frontal attack against
artillery, poison gas and air strikes. Close to 1,000,000 mainly teenage
soldiers paid the price for their commanders' incompetence before
economic and physical exhaustion brought a halt to the proceedings.
By contrast, the bitter, many-sided civil war in Lebanon claimed a
comparatively light tally of 150,000. But it was a conflict accessible
to television and pictorially effective amid the ruins of
once-fashionable Beirut, the Paris of the Middle East.
Even the horrors of the Hutu-Tutsi tribal feud in Rwanda and Burundi
are not new. More than 250,000 civilians were massacred in tit-for-tat
slaughter there between 1959 and 1988.
The Arab-Israeli wars chalked up more than 100,000 deaths and a string
of straight Israeli victories since 1956, and Bosnia is now competing
for a league place with 200,000 dead in 18 months and 50,000 more
missing in that time-honoured and favourite game of the Balkan peoples,
ethnic cleansing.
With the former Soviet Union fragmenting into hostile states, and
pressure from Islamic fundamentalist regimes building along Europe's
southern frontiers, perhaps the only saving grace of the half century
since the surrender of Germany and Japan is that mankind has not yet
gone the whole hog and indulged in a bit of nuclear extermination.

GERMANY is calling it the Day of Liberation, but this official Federal
Government designation is causing dissent. Chancellor Helmut Kohl has
stood firm, insisting that the commemoration of May 8, 1945, has nothing
to do with a defeat but with a day when the German people were released
from 12 years of Nazism.
The solemn ceremony in Berlin on Monday night will be staged as a
diplomatic demonstration of Germany confronting its difficult past and
emerging as a stable democracy. It will be given a statesmanly gloss
with the presence of senior representatives of the wartime Allies:
British Prime Minister John Major, President Franois Mitterrand of
France, US Vice-President Al Gore, and Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin.
This determination to align the German people with the Allied
''liberators'' has created its own diplomatic tension. President Lech
Walesa of Poland tried to gatecrash the top table of the commemorations,
forcing Germany into the embarrassment of stating there would be no
invitation, the guest list was full. The Polish overture had raised the
prospect of Germany having to host a ceremony involving representatives
of every one of the Nazi-occupied territories in Europe. They would have
needed more than the Berlin Opera House as a venue.
A compromise was reached with Poland through the invitation to its
Foreign Minister, Wladyslaw Bartoszewski, a concentration-camp survivor,
to address the German Parliament. This incident, however, disturbed the
composure of the German Federal Government's painful anxiety to be seen
to be taking a politically correct line on May 8. The official slogan
will be ''It's Freedom's Birthday''. Not everyone is ready to celebrate.
This has been further inflamed by an open letter by 300 public figures
and conservative intellectuals led by Alfred Dregger, honorary chairman
of the Christian Democratic Union. The letter, published in several
German newspapers, argued against forgetting, and insisted that May 8,
1945, was a date Germans should treat with grief and regret.
The point is not to lament the passing of the Nazi rule of terror, but
to acknowledge the beginning of a new oppression with the division of
Germany into East and West. Germany's full liberation was delayed until
the fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9, 1989.
It has become a debate about whose suffering should be commemorated.
The Kohl line is to face up to the Holocaust as a persecution that
overshadows all other obstacles to German reunification and democracy.
His opponents argue that it is wrong for Germany to forget the German
dead in the war, the homelessness experienced in the rubble after the
war, the millions of Germans who died in East Germany or Soviet camps,
or suffered deportation.
Tomorrow night President Kohl will sound another of the notes of
reconciliation which have been a feature of German responses, notably
over Auschwitz and Dresden, in this year of 50th anniversaries, as the
calendar has moved onwards toward May 8 and the end of the war. He will
be opening the New Jewish Synagogue in Oranienburg, Berlin, a
replacement for that burned down by the Nazis.
On the same night in Munich, the birthplace of Nazism, there will be
an alternative anniversary event to counter the Day of Liberation
ceremonies in Berlin and most German cities.
The mood, therefore, is not universally reconciled to German guilt,
German suffering, and German identity. This is the real liberation which
some conservative intellectuals believe the German people are still
awaiting.

In putting the Nazis on trial at Nuremberg the Allies were applying
retroactive legal standards to actions performed in the chaos of war.
They soon found this was a double-edged sword. JOHN LINKLATER looks at
how accurate Goering's famous phrase 'The victor will always be the
judge and the vanquished the accused' proved to be.
CHURCHILL wanted them put up against a wall and shot. Summary
executions of the Nazi leaders would have avoided the danger of
providing a final platform for the vitriol, militarism, and racial
hatred that had sustained the Third Reich for 12years. The Nuremberg
Trial ran that risk, confident it would demonstrate unequivocally the
moral ascendancy of the victors and the unmitigated depravity of the
losers.
History judges the exercise strictly because, in a sense, it was as
much the Allies who put themselves on trial by attempting to
simultaneously invent and establish a new code of international justice.
It was a difficult precedent. There had been aggressive wars for 2000
years, but never had there been an attempt to convict, employing a term
like ''accumulated evil'', on the basis of ''crimes against peace'',
''war crimes'' and ''crimes against humanity''. These represented counts
two, three, and four of the 1945 Charter of the International Tribunal,
and the first count charged defendants with conspiracy with Hitler to
make war.
A cruder form of justice would have avoided some of the pitfalls which
this lofty, even idealistic, approach exposed. The German defence of the
20 defendants at Nuremberg consistently exploited the ''victors' law''
scenario, whereby criminal offences where created retroactively.
Goering's phrase, ''The victor will always be the judge and the
vanquished the accused'', was repeated as a running theme, and with some
accuracy.
The international commissioners, representing America, Britain, the
Soviet Union, and France, of the Nuremberg Trial might argue that
retroactive laws were necessary to deal with crimes beyond previous
conception, but only ''crimes against humanity'', where they applied
specifically to the genocidal attempt to wipe out the Jewish race, could
be justified on this basis.
Churchill's impulse to round up the Nazi leaders as a group of vicious
gangsters, to be subjected to gangster law, would have spared the
embarrassment of legal complexities. But a flurry of swift firing-squad
executions would inevitably have led to serious miscarriages of justice
and assisted the future rekindling of neo-nazism by creating martyrs and
shrines.
This was the objection of Stalin and Roosevelt when they overruled
Churchill. The trial would portray the Allies as above righteous
vengeance. The Nazis would receive a fairer hearing than they had ever
allowed any of their victims. Article 16 of the Charter, providing for a
''fair trial'', provoked German cynicism. That was a concept for which
there had been no vocabulary in German for over a decade.
The intention of Nuremberg, of course, was to put Nazism itself on
trial, which it did with categorical success. The 12 months of laborious
hearings, scrupulously fair in terms of actual process in front of eight
Allied judges, produced an uncontestable indictment and confession of
the Nazi evil on the record. There are 38 volumes to refute every
revisionist lie attempted today and for perpetuity.
The problem was that the major architects of Nazism had cheated
Nuremberg. Hitler had committed suicide (or was murdered by the SS,
according to the latest theory) in the final week of the war. Goebbels
and Himmler committed suicide. Bormann was on the run, and was convicted
and sentenced to hanging in absentia. Hess was physically present (if
that was Hess in the dock, and not a doppelganger), but mentally
deranged. He amazed the court by asserting he was fit to stand trial,
his amnesia had cleared, and he spent most of the proceedings reading
Grimm's fairy-tales.
Only Goering was there to represent the former Nazi leadership. The
other defendants were a dismal bunch of beaten generals and admirals,
like Keitel, Jodl, Donitz and Raeder; diplomatic, bureaucratic, and
administrative mediocraties, like Fritzsche, Funk, Rosenberg, and
Sauckel; and three subhuman psychopaths, Frank, Streicher, and
Kaltenbrunner.
It was like a trial after a Greek tragedy: the final catharsis would
have to be enacted without the main protagonists. Exeunt: they fall on
their cyanide capsules.
The wretched assembly of defendants might have been indicted on the
basis of their unflattering appearance, a combination of the bestial and
the hangdog. Witnesses kept remarking on this impression they identified
in a group stripped of their uniforms, insignia, and dignity.
IF there was an attempt to prosecute a symbolic humiliation, this was
consistent with the selection of the city of Nuremberg for the trial.
If Berlin was the charnel house of Nazism, and Munich was its nursery,
then Nuremberg had been its academy. This had been the city of the
rallies, the great strutting parades, and the bombastic speeches. It had
also given its name to the infamous 1935 Laws which prohibited marriage
between Germans and Jews, prophetic of what lay in store.
The Allies might insist that Nuremberg had been chosen because it was
one of the few German cities that still possessed a prison intact, but
this admission was a tactical blunder. It emphasised the irony of the
victors drawing up a new international law of war criminality in a city
they had bombed to complete rubble, with the implication that other
cities had fared worse. Which was manifestly the case.
Nuremberg still had its prison, its patched-up Palace of Justice to
host the trial, and its renovated Grand Hotel to accommodate the circus.
The rest was rubble, the smell of disinfectant everywhere and an
estimated 6000 civilian bodies still buried in the debris.
The irony was hardly lost on anyone, even the most vengeful seeker of
justice, and it supported the ''victors' justice'' theme. In a show
trial intended to demonstrate the moral standings of accuser and
accused, where an international precedent for ''criminal'' warfare was
going to be set, it was too bad if the devastation of Nuremberg might
suggest a reference to the firebombing of Dresden, or the nuking of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
Or if the question of ''aggressive warfare'' might raise questions
about Soviet Russia's invasion of Finland and division of Poland in
1939. Or if ''war crimes'' might lead to a closer investigation of the
murder of 15,000 Polish officers at Katyn Forest, an atrocity initially
levelled at the Nazis during the trial, but for which ample evidence was
already emerging at Nuremberg to implicate the Soviets.
If there was discomfort among the eight judges (two from each of the
four Allies) it surfaced over sentencing, rather than over any of the
double standards. The Soviets were intransigently against the
possibility of acquittals, but British interests were active in lobbying
for clemency towards former Reich Economics Minister Hjalmar Schacht and
Reich Armament and War Production Minister Albert Speer.
When it came down to the vote of the judges for Schacht, France sided
with Britain for not guilty, and America went along with this, purely to
avoid being aligned with the Soviets on a split. Schacht was acquitted,
as was former Vice Chancellor Von Papen and the head of the broadcasting
division in the Nazi Propaganda Ministry, Hans Fritzsche.
The position with Speer was more complicated. There was adequate
evidence of his presiding over the criminal use of slave labour, which
went beyond acceptability. There is more than a suspicion of the astute
Speer turning King's Evidence to save his neck, and his efforts to
ingratiate himself with information and co-operation throughout the
course of the 12-month trial.
He was found guilty on two of the counts, and escaped with a 20-year
sentence, when his deputy, the uneloquent Fritz Sauckel, got life.
Soviet fury over Speer and the life sentence for Hess, instead of death,
partially explains the vindictiveness that denied their Spandau prisoner
any humanitarian clemency, even in the last years of his long and
miserable life.
Churchill's darkest forebodings were being realised, but nowhere more
starkly than in the performance at the trial of Goering. His physical
domination of the proceedings was proving dangerous, to the extent that
correspondents were beginning to write approvingly of his ''charisma''
and evident ''leadership'' qualities. Rebecca West compared his
presiding presence with a fat woman with a sleek cat in the late morning
in a Marseilles doorway.
Goering wiped the floor with his American prosecutor, Justice Robert H
Jackson, and the Allied case was suffering a disaster until he was
cross-examined by the Scottish counsel, Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe, who
snared him over the execution of 50 RAF officers, recaptured after
tunnelling out of their camp at Sagan, south-east of Berlin. Goering was
sentenced to be hanged.
The executions were bungled. An American Master Sergeant, John Wood,
volunteered for the job, and became an immediate celebrity in the press
camp at the Grand Hotel. A ''John Wood'', marked in red, went on to the
bar's cocktail list.
Eleven of the original 22 were due to hang on the night of October 16,
1946. Dr Robert Ley had committed suicide in his cell at the start of
the trial. Bormann never re-emerged to face his sentence, and it is now
virtually established that he died in Paraguay. It was Goering who
cheated the rope at the last minute. A cyanide capsule was smuggled into
his cell, rumoured to be passed from the lips of his wife when she was
granted a final kiss to her husband.
Photographs of the other 10 condemned men caused disquiet. There was
considerable blood on the heads of several of the corpses. Sergeant Wood
claimed the heads of the convicted men hit the sides of the trap door as
they dropped, but witnesses described slow, choking deaths. Ribbentrop
and Keitel struggled at the ends of their ropes for 20 minutes.
Sections of the ropes were being sold as souvenirs in Nuremberg, a
bizarre medieval coda to an enterprise to establish international
justice against aggressive warfare for the remainder of the twentieth
century.

The industry may be much reduced but then, as now, Clyde-built meant
quality. And, as Ian Bruce explains, shipbuilding was more than just a
job.
IN the six years of the Second World War more than 30,000 ships were
made, repaired, or overhauled on the Clyde by a work-force which by 1945
numbered 50,000 in yards scattered the length of the river.
They built everything from heavy cruisers to landing craft, and the
vessels they built served in every theatre of conflict. If Aldershot was
the spiritual home of the Army, then the Royal Navy's equivalent ran
from the Broomielaw to the Tail o' the Bank.
Clyde-built, then as now, meant quality. And quality counted for
everything when the ships were designed to take men into harm's way.
Most of the names of the famous firms are history themselves.
Fairfields, Stephen's, Harland and Wolff, Scotts, and John Brown's are
all gone, casualties of recession and falling demand.
Empty slipways and weed-encrusted jetties are about all that remain of
the metal-bashing kingdoms that dominated shipbuilding world-wide for a
generation. The final nail in their coffin was rigged national subsidies
in the West and cheap Far Eastern alternatives for shipping magnates in
search of new vessels.
But even as late as the early 1960s, the UK was still the world's
second-biggest shipbuilder. The QE2 and its luxury liner predecessors
Queen Elizabeth and Queen Mary bore testament to pride of workmanship.
Three decades ago, apprentices were paid 12s 5d for a basic 48-hour
week. But there were always more candidates than places, even at almost
slave-labour rates. Working in the yards was more than a job. It was a
tradition and a way of life.
Fewer than 7000 men now labour at creating ships, and a mere 4000 of
them work for companies that are still British-owned. But the backbone
of the R N's surface fleet, the multi-purpose Type 23 frigates designed
at Yarrow's Scotstoun yard, remain a major contender for orders, even in
hard times and in small numbers.
The Clyde had a proud war record. More than 80% of all landing ships
and landing craft and 90% of the two million American GIs who took part
in the invasion of Europe passed through Glasgow and Greenock en route
for war on foreign fields.
Convoys assembled in the river to bring relief and supplies to Malta,
and to Murmansk, and reinforcements to the embattled Eighth Army in
North Africa.
Yards like Scotts at Greenock built 52 major warships in six years.
Many were rushed out to meet the early threat of economic strangulation
by U-boat and surface raiders between 1939 and 1942.
At that time the odds were stacked in Germany's favour and the toll
proved high in lives and ships.
Of the vessels that went down the slipways at Scotts alone, a few
brief lines record that casualty rate. The destroyer Ardent was sunk in
action against the German cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau off Norway.
The destroyers Hostile, mined in the Mediterranean in 1940, and
Galatea, torpedoed off the Libyan coast in 1942, are two more of the
many losses. The submarine Traveller left Malta in November, 1942, to
patrol off the Italian port of Taranto. She was never heard of again.
All were mourned by a work-force who came to think of them as ''their''
ships.
But there was much revenge. Clyde-built ships helped sink 500 U-boats
during the Battle of the Atlantic, and were there when the Bismarck, the
most dangerous and powerful of all the surface raiders, was sent to the
bottom of the Denmark Strait in 1941 and Scharnhorst met her end in
Arctic darkness two years later.
If, however, tribute is paid to the Clyde and its contribution to the
war effort, it should be to the people who worked there that most should
go. On VE-Day it is the thousands who laboured round the clock,
sometimes under air attack, to deliver warships and transports who
should be remembered.

With all her wartime deprivations, the forties woman was as
style-conscious as any, says Anne Simpson, and took her cues first from
Hollywood and later from Dior's New Look.
THEY used to say that, after the war, people went to the cinema to
learn how they should live. Certainly during the war the movies taught
them how to dress. While men noted the drape of Cary Grant's jackets and
the tilt of Clark Gable's brims, women copied the width of Joan
Crawford's shoulders and the cantilevered wonder of Jane Russell's bust.
And if stringency meant they couldn't possess Betty Grable's nylons at
least they could pretend by painting a black ''seam'' down the back of
each leg. All that was required was indelible ink and an obliging
girlfriend with a steady hand. But when the ink ran dry, what then?
Forced to forget Grable's graceful shanks, women would emulate her
cherry lips, or become a bottle blonde, bleaching the hair to such
blazing whiteness it almost required a blackout curtain after dark.
But of all the starry fashion influences -- from Greta Garbo's slouchy
coats to Barbara Stanwyck's sausage-roll fringe -- that of Dietrich was
supreme. She taught women how to pluck their eyebrows. She taught them
how to wear trousers. In fact no other Hollywood goddess took to pants
with quite the same sophistication and ironic self-mockery as Marlene.
And, in top hat, black tie and tails, she stood on stage, dazzling but
remote, daring all possibilities.
For most European women, though, trousers in time of strife did not
represent the svelte ensembles of dramatic costume. Instead they were
the emergency wear of ammunition factories and hardship. Or else they
were those silky culottes belonging to the smart house-party set, for
fashion in those days flew an elitist flag. It operated for the benefit
of the rich, leaving the masses to run up remnant imitations for
themselves. So, pre-war and post-war, a woman on a tight budget could
become as stylishly correct as her skill with a needle would allow. If
possessed by imagination, the home dressmaker or the fireside knitter
counted for something. In style terms she was the street-cred hotshot of
her time.
Nevertheless it was celluloid rather than pages of Vogue which really
governed the way women of the forties dressed, and something of that
power lingers today for the sartorial influence of a good film can still
mean rags or riches to the fashion trade. Underwear, for instance,
became sexy precisely because of Hollywood: when audiences saw Ginger
Rogers tripping about in camiknickers the message went out that here was
the satin talisman of glamour. It mattered not that, given rationing,
the commercial copies were of inferior silkiness and came in an
offputting pink best described as tinned salmon. That said, tinned
salmon itself was rarely there to be sniffed at. On the day of victory
it was rustled up from somewhere to become the food of kings. But
Hollywood's clout in underwear could render dangerous blows, too.
Shortly before the war, when Clark Gable stripped before Claudette
Colbert in the daring comedy It Happened One Night, he revealed that
beneath his shirt he didn't wear a vest. As a result the sales of vests
plummeted in all countries colonised by American movies, and a lot of
men in underwear for a living took to jumping out of windows.
By the middle of the war Veronica Lake's peek-a-boo hairstyle, a
blonde swathe dipping coquettishly over one eye, was being re-created in
hair salons all over the Western world. Yet its story represents the
sudden rise and fall of fame in any age. Lake became a casualty of an
unexpected collision between cinema hype and wartime propaganda. Two
weeks before Pearl Harbor Life magazine celebrated her tresses as a
national treasure, divulging the approximate number of hairs on her head
(150,000) and reporting that the length was 17in in front, 24in at the
back, falling to eight inches below her shoulders. But by 1943 Lake's
fortunes had change, her precious cascade deemed a war menace as
increasing numbers of defence-plant workers became entangled in machines
because of their ''Veronica Lake wave''. The star was asked to abandon
her trademark ''for the duration'', and she obliged. Yet in doing her
bit for the war effort Lake's career was also shorn of influence and
never really revived.
Using movies as a means to dictate dress grew into something greater
than having the right gloves to match your hat -- and in a forties movie
a hat for a woman was as important as a man. Indeed a film's style
became a subtle instrument for several purposes: it taught the need for
conformity; it stressed a woman's role as a sex object or love partner,
and it showed the audience consumer items they yearned to possess. And
for any woman who wished to look like Bette Davis, Dietrich, Crawford,
and the rest, the business of assembling that image was pretty much a
full-time job. Aside from money it required hours of shopping, mixing
and matching to unite a suit with shoes and jewellery. To shellac the
hair, to apply that rich sheen of make-up, often needed help and potions
by the potful.
So, anyone who rose in the morning to construct such an ensemble and
then trot out into the world with ankle straps cutting deep into her
legs was taking the business of being a 1940s woman seriously. Thus
tricked out, clutching a hat like a wavy halo to her head, her high
heels clicking over bomb-scarred pavements, she rushed into the streets
to welcome peace. And if the get-up slowed her down at least it seemed
glamorous. Uncomfortable, but glamorous. But two years later, as peace
was still struggling to bind up the wounds of ravaged Europe, Christian
Dior dropped a bomb. Or, rather he dropped the hemline, and from that
resounding moment the erratic but erotic battle of the skirt length
began.
Seen against the square-shouldered narrowness which had dominated
dress for 13 years, Dior's New Look, with its tiny, constricting bodice,
its pinched waist and voluptuous skirt, was intoxicating, an orgy of all
things feminine and sinful. Today here it comes traipsing back with all
the other fashion phantoms of the forties as the world's leading
designers, in their latest collections, pay their own homage to those
brave, defiant years. And what these evocations give us are fashion's
medals of honour, reminding us of all those women, famous and unknown,
who, against the odds, still nourished style within their wartime valour
and endurance.

James Laing recalls how life began to return to normal as the troops
adjusted to Civvy Street.
IN the summer of 1945 Scots began to return to their summer holiday
resorts like Rothesay, Ayr, Largs, and the Fife coast with a huge
feeling of relief. Bed and breakfast in a superior boarding house was 7s
6d (38p) but a whole family could have a wonderful time for less than a
fiver.
More exotic destinations were on offer after May. Scottish Aviation
announced the resumption of flights to New York, London, Paris, and even
Moscow.
Fares were fixed at #47 for a night flight to America. Moscow could be
visited for #17 return and the fare to London was #3 9s 6d (#3.48p) On
VE Day, in The Glasgow Herald, shipping companies like Cunard-White
Star, the Anchor Line, and the Orient Line were advertising passages to
America, Canada, and Australia.
Scots loved their live entertainment and Glasgow and Edinburgh were
full of theatres. Scots comedienne Renee Houston was appearing at the
Pavilion with her husband Donald Stewart Murray. Webster Booth and Anne
Ziegler, a top-range singing duo, were at the Alhambra, and Ivy Benson
with her all-girl band was sharing top billing at the Empire with Nat
Mills and Bobbie.
In Edinburgh the famous piano duo Rawizc and Landauer were taking a
break from the BBC to appear at the Usher Hall and the Aberdeen comedian
Harry Gordon was at the King's. The price of seats ranged from 1s in the
back balcony to 6s for the front stalls (5p-30p.) There were new
sadnesses as well. Alongside the ''safe and well'' notices appearing in
newspapers inserted by returning prisoners of war were lists of men who
were reported ''missing'' only to be confirmed as having died in action.
The death of the Scottish sprint hero, Eric Liddell, in a Japanese POW
camp was announced. He had been a missionary in China.
King Farouk of Egypt, later to become notorious for his excesses, was
touched by a newspaper of a blinded ex-soldier opening a new tobacconist
shop in Edinburgh and sent him a gift of 25,000 Egyptian cigarettes.
Dance halls in Glasgow were doing a roaring trade with the young women
and the returning Servicemen adjusting to Civvy Street. The Locarno was
open every afternoon and evening. Entry to the afternoon session was 1s
6d (8p), double that at night.
A sumptuous night out at the Ca'Doro restaurant in Union Street,
Glasgow cost 15p for supper and a full four-course dinner was offered
for 25p.
Part of the celebrations included a star-studded exhibition golf match
at West Kilbride featuring the professionals Henry Cotton and Jack
McLean partnered by two distinguished amateurs, Hector Thomson and
Donald Cameron.
Sombre statistics also started to emerge. The Scottish town that
suffered the most air raids during the war was Aberdeen, which was
bombed 34 times.
None of the raids matched the savagery of the blitz on Clydebank but
178 civilians were killed in the northern town. More than 330 houses
were totally destroyed and another 13,000 badly damaged. Total British
casualties during the war amounted to 367,116 killed, including 60,595
civilians. By comparison, Russian casualties amounted to seven million
dead.
Women played a vital part in the war effort. By the end 215,000 women
were serving in the ATS, the Auxiliary Territoral Service, working as
radar operators, on anti-aircraft batteries, and as cooks, clerks, and
drivers. Four of their officers and 73 other ranks were killed in
action.

Clarinettist Peanuts Hucko will repeat his original V E Day concert on
Monday. Ken Gallacher meets a living legend.
ON Monday night in London, clarinettist Peanuts Hucko will play at the
Palladium in a special V E Day concert -- 50 years to the day after he
played a similar concert with the Glenn Miller AAF Orchestra in the
Palais de Chaillot in Paris.
Hucko was one of the stars of that wartime band and today, at 77, his
talents are undimmed. He was in Glasgow recently with the Miller
remembrance package now led by the late leader's nephew, John.
Mission to Moscow, the Mel Powell chart which featured Hucko as the
main soloist, was a highlight of that show, just as it was throughout
the time spent by the AAF Band in Europe.
That band was the most celebrated of the groups which crossed the
Atlantic to entertain the troops. That was partly down to the enormous
popularity of Miller's peacetime band, and partly to the outstanding
musicians studded through the various sections -- Bernie Privin and Zeke
Zarchy among the trumpets; Mel Powell, Carmen Mastren, Trigger Alpert,
and Ray McKinley in the rhythm section and the aforementioned Hucko
among the saxes.
Hucko recalls: ''It was a very disciplined band. Glenn always had that
thing about any band he led. You had to be on the stand on time, you had
to be able to lick those parts, and you had to look at your best too.''
However, while all of that was happening as the war finished, the
musicians returned home to find that their time of stardom, the Big Band
Era, was coming to an end.
The musicians found that the singers were taking over and within a
couple of years most of the name bands had vanished. The sidemen sought
refuge in the studios, first on radio and then on television. They also
played jazz in small group settings.
It was the route Hucko took, concentrating his work on the clarinet,
with his eloquent tenor sax being heard less frequently.
Apart from the studio work, he played and recorded with Jack
Teagarden, Eddie Condon, the Lawson-Haggart Jazz Band, Louis Armstrong,
and his own groups.
The marvellous thing about Peanuts is how he retains his enthusiasm.
Midway through this current tour, he cancelled several dates to fly to
Florida and play at an 80th birthday party for tenor saxophonist Flip
Phillips.
He said: ''I was a little upset that I missed out on Bob Haggart's
party last year because Hag and I did so many things together around new
York in the fifties and sixties.
''So I was determined that I would not miss Flip's party. I flew
there, played the three days and then returned to the tour. I saw a lot
of old friends and Flip was magnificent.
''When I hit 80 I reckon I'll hold one, too, and have all my friends
there. All my favourite musicians will play and I'll just try to be as
good as Flip was.''

The all-clear seems to have signalled a great clean-out in many of
Britain's post-war homes. But, as Liz Taylor finds, many of these
throwaways are now collectibles.
WHEN the war ended, the entire British nation must have launched a
massive clean-out campaign, throwing away things that might later remind
them of six years of fighting, rationing, bombing, and separation from
loved ones.
A dearth of Second World War memorabilia was revealed when Fiona
Colton, curator of Wilton House Museum in Hawick, decided to stage a
''Home Front'' exhibition to coincide with V E Day. She thought there
would be little trouble in gathering material from people in the town.
However, a letter in the local newspaper, appealing for the loan of
1939-45 clothing, gas-masks, uniforms, household equipment, domestic
tools, furniture, school memorabilia, and material pertaining to
prisoners of war, both in this country and abroad, met with a
disappointing lack of response -- only one phone call.
Hawick is not alone. Surprisingly, considering the historical
significance of the last war, there is little interest as yet in
collecting things connected with it.
None of the London auction houses has put on a V E Day sale, but
Bonhams, which is the most trend-setting of the big four, was alive
early on to the collectible possibilities of Second World War
memorabilia, for in June 1991 they staged an auction of commemorative
china and glass which included such hitherto-unregarded treasures as
Royal Worcester figures and a miniature chamber-pot with a portrait of
Hitler inside it.
On the whole, prices were low, however, and the Hitler chamber-pot was
estimated at around only #50.
As serious collectibles, the Royal Worcester figures were the most
interesting items on offer, because they were modelled by a highly-
skilled sculptor called Eileen Soper, who worked for the company during
the war years. She deserved official recognition for the propaganda
power of her work, especially the figural groups called Salvage, Take
Cover, The Rescue, and Stowaways, which portrayed heroic scenes of war.
When they came up for sale in 1991, they varied in price from #800 to
#2000. Today they should fetch quite a bit more.
Other morale-boosting pieces were issued during the war by the Paragon
Pottery company, which ran a range of tableware, called the Patriotic
Series, that included things like cups and saucers printed with a map of
Britain and the slogan: ''There Will Always be an England'' (sic!).
So what else did people buy to decorate their homes in those hazardous
days? Wall plaques in the shape of Spitfires instead of flying ducks.
Toby jugs modelled on Churchill, Wavell, Eisenhower, and Montgomery. A
Clarice Cliff jug of Churchill fetched around #500 four years ago but
that price would probably double today.
Other memorabilia of the Second World War worth collecting are the
colourful posters put out by the Ministry of Information to educate and
encourage the population.
In March this year, Onslow Auctions, who specialise in posters, sold a
remarkable collection which were brought together as a record of his
work by Edwin Embleton, MBE. He is now 87, and during the war he was Art
Director at the Ministry of Information, responsible for all their
printed productions.
The most valuable of the examples he kept were eight large Careless
Talk Costs Lives posters by the artist who signed himself Fougasse,
though his real name was Kenneth Bird. Fougasse used humour to get
across a serious message and one of the posters in Onslow's sale showed
two housewives gossiping in a bus unaware that Hitler and Goering were
sharing the seat behind them. The poster sold for #780.
Edwin Embleton also commissioned the artist H M Bateman to do eight
Coughs and Sneezes Spread Diseases posters, which also kept the
beleaguered nation smiling.
Among the more serious posters was one entitled Women of Britain Come
Into the Factories, which was drawn by the artist Zec, and a
photo-montage poster showing Winston Churchill against a background of
tanks and Hurricane aircraft and inscribed with the rallying message,
''Let Us Go Forward Together''. Both of these sold for around #300.

Glasgow was the perfect place for a celebration, says Andrew Young, --
in streets, theatres, and dance halls.
THEY were dancing in Glasgow on V E night. In the streets and in the
ballrooms. More so than anywhere else, for Glasgow was then the dancing
capital of Britain. At Green's Playhouse, it was to the music of Harry
Parry and his Radio Dance Orchestra, with vocalists Gail Paige and
Frances Dee.
And for the Barrowland Ballroom, the Evening Times advert said: ''Come
on and Hear, Come on and Hear, the Gay-Birds with Billy MacGregor.'' The
front page of the paper declared: ''Premier Gives Nation Signal to
Rejoice.''
The entertainment scene was buoyant. Television was non-existent, the
single-channel BBC outlet, such as it was, having been switched off for
the duration. People listened to the wireless, but mainly they went out
to enjoy themselves.
Those were healthy days for the theatre, the cinema, and the dance
halls. At the Victory Theatre, Paisley, Jimmy Logan's dad, Jack Short,
was producing Boys Home on Leave -- ''a stirring tribute to our overseas
forces''.
Webster Booth and Anne Ziegler were singing at the Alhambra, Glasgow,
in Sweet Yesterdays. Renee Houston, one of the best entertainers
Scotland has produced, was topping the bill twice nightly at the
Pavilion, Glasgow, with her husband, Donald Stewart. At the Empire,
still Britain's No 2 variety venue, which shared the stars with the
London Palladium, the twice-nightly show was Frolics, with Nat Mills and
Bobbie, regulars on the circuit.
At the Theatre Royal, Glasgow, there was the Carl Rosa Opera company
with La Tosca, featuring Joan Hammond and Frank Titterton. And at the
King's, The Lilac Domino, with Marjory Sandford and Leo Franklyn. The
old Metropole in Stockwell Street was into the last week of its
long-running (19 weeks) winter show, A Nicht at the Clachan, with Pete
Martin and Duncan's Collies (yes, they used to have theatre bills like
that then).
Retired civil servant Pat Johnson, 72, still an inveterate
first-nighter, worked in London during the war but got back to Glasgow
to see as many pantos as he could. He has special memories of the Ross
Parker/Hughie Charles song, We'll Meet Again. He first heard it on the
radio in the early war years, sung by panto star Dorothy Ward, who had
also sung it for the troops in France.
''I then saw Vera Lynn making her West End debut at the Palladium with
it, and, of course the song has been associated with her ever since,''
he says. ''In my opinion the Alhambra pantos were the greatest, with the
wonderful partnership of Will Fyffe and Harry Gordon.''
Glasgow was also the most cinema-going city in Europe. In addition to
the main halls, like the Picture House, the Paramount, the New Savoy,
and the Regal, there were dozens of little fleapits all over the place,
as the three evenings -- Times, News, Citizen -- were to reflect with
three pages of cinema ads when newsprint became more plentiful.
Films being shown during victory week included The Impatient Years
with Jean Arthur, Lee Bowman, and Charles Coburn; Madonna of the Seven
Moons with Phyllis Calvert, Stewart Granger, Patricia Roc; and George
Formby in He Snoops to Conquer.
Many of the wartime movies were morale boosters -- Tales of Manhattan,
Casablanca, Stage Door Canteen, and 49th Parallel. An important part of
every cinema show was the newsreel -- the Gaumont British News with the
distinctive patriotic tones of E V H Emmett.
Radio was undoubtedly the greatest source of communication and
entertainment. It was the means by which Churchill made all his stirring
speeches to the world.
On the Home Service and the General Forces programme, there were
hugely popular shows like Tommy Handley's ITMA, Monday Night at Eight,
Navy Mixture (often featuring Ted and Barbara Andrews, singing parents
of Julie Andrews). There was Music While You Work, Workers' Playtime,
and stars like Jack Buchanan, Bebe Daniels, and Ben Lyon.
Coming home from the forces were all sorts of entertainers about to
make names for themselves. I got an Aarmy posting in London shortly
after the war and was a regular at the Nuffield Centre, next to
Trafalgar Square, watching the young hopefuls trying out their material.
Spike Milligan, Michael Bentine, Peter Sellers, Harry Secombe, Frankie
Howerd, Tony Hancock, Bob Monkhouse -- they all appeared there.

Piece together the war with a jigsaw or view it on video. Lesley
Duncan reviews some V E Day souvenirs.
IS the nation wallowing in a tidal-wave of nostalgia for V E Day? If
not, it's through no want of encouragement by the souvenir industry.
From mugs to medals, jigsaw puzzles to videos and CDs, recipe books to
playing cards, reminders of our finest hours are seeping into the shops.
First, those mugs. ''Dig for Victory Now'' is the admonition on one.
Its companion, showing a fresh-faced landgirl, says, ''Lend a Hand on
the Land'' (#9.95, the pair). Another, sporting a blue victory V, costs
#8.95.
Waddington's 1000-piece jigsaw, showing a V E Day street party
complete with bunneted man at a piano, would delight those of patient
disposition (#12.99). There's lots of period detail, too, in the playing
cards featuring 54 classic wartime images from London Transport Museum,
the Imperial War Museum, and the Public Record Office (#6.50). A quick
taste of austerity can be had with the recipes on a dishtowel. The
''victory sponge'' proposes as its first ingredient one large raw
potato.
There is an endless supply of videos, records, and CDs to mark V E
Day. Videos include two devoted to Britain's great wartime leader.
Churchill: the Finest Hours was made with his full co-operation and
blessing.'' Orson Welles tells his story (Jack le Vien, #12.95).
Churchill's War (#10.99, Castle Hendring) features newly-discovered
footage and, wherever possible, original recordings of Churchill's great
speeches.
W H Smith offers the MoD-approved D-Day to V E Day video. The official
story is introduced by Brigadier T Longland, OBE, and narrated by
Michael Aspel. Other titles stocked by W H Smith include D-Day, The
Battle for Arnhem, and The Official Story of the British Army (Glasgow
stockist, Playhouse, St Enoch Centre).
An ambitious taped History of World War II is narrated by Ludovic
Kennedy and Anthony Farrar-Hockley with portrayals by the actor Martin
Jarvis. At #39.99 this is for listeners with a serious interest in the
subject and long car journeys.
The BBC's Radio Collection includes recordings of four forties shows
of the legendary ITMA (It's That Man Again -- not Hitler but Tommy
Handley). Handley and his gang kept the nation chuckling through the
darkest days of the war, simultaneously cocking a snook at the Nazis and
poking fun at British officialdom. What did the Nazis make of the
sherry-swilling Colonel Chinstrap (''I don't mind if I do'')? They were
probably baffled by the British sense of humour under duress but thought
Handley a dangerous enough fellow to put him on a death list (#7.99).
Dad's Army deals with the same period, though in affectionate
retrospect. Four typical episodes are among other titles available from
the BBC Radio Collection.
What can be more evocative of the era than its popular music? Get ''In
the Mood'' with 36 classic numbers in Glenn Miller: the Lost Recordings
(two tapes, #11.95) or the two volumes of the VE Day Music Collection
(#10.95 CDs, #6.50 tapes).
British Legion commemorative medals, a silver coin issued by the Dutch
mint, Swiss watches bearing the insignia of the three services on their
dials, stamps from Guernsey marking the island's liberation from Nazi
occupation, and special silk ties and scarves from the Tie Rack are
among other varied mementoes for VE Day.
Perhaps, though, you'd like something a bit more immediate in its
impact. The V E Day Party Box, complete with four card gas-masks, could
help create an austerely carnival atmosphere.
Wartime radios feature in a sequence of paintings by Strathyre-based
artist Rod McCance. His work is one man's very personal tribute to the
war effort.
* Past Times stock several of the items mentioned. Their stores are at
70 Buchanan Street, Glasgow; 7a Frederick Street, Edinburgh and 175
Union Sgreet, Aberdeen.

Zagreb, Friday
CROATIA'S rival armies are massing across the country in the wake of
this week's lightning offensive by government troops, the United Nations
warned today.
Croatian soldiers and rebel Krajina Serbs exchanged mortar and small
arms fire around Serb-held Glina and peacekeepers saw Serb
reinforcements moving towards the area, a UN spokesman said.
Croatian units also entered a UN-controlled zone to seize a key access
road to Glina and warned peacekeepers not to interfere.
Both sides, but especially the government army, were massing men and
big guns in eastern Croatia and encroaching on UN zones drawn up to keep
the two sides apart after a 1992 ceasefire in Croatia's civil war.
Across the border in Bosnia UN officials said more than 2,000 shells
rained down on sliver of Croat-controlled territory bordering Croatia in
less than three hours.
Asked if this was the Bosnian Serbs' promised retaliation for the
Croatian capture of Serb-held Western Slavonia in this week's two-day
offensive, UN military spokesman Lt-Col Gary Coward said: ''A reasonable
man might assume so.''
Meanwhile EU monitors today cleared the Croatian army of claims that
it mistreated defeated Serb soldiers.
They dismissed earlier UN reports that the triumphant Croatian army
abused a handfull of Serbs who fought on after a ceasefire was agreed on
Thursday until finally surrendering.
''The Croatian operation was excellent, professional, competent and
correct,'' a German EU monitor insisted in the town of Pakrac, where the
abuses were alleged to have happened.
UN sources had said earlier that the Croatian army rounded up and
forcibly bussed away hundreds of Serbs, including women and children,
from the Western Slavonia region.
A furious Croatian Interior Minister Ivan Jarnjak called the reports
an ''absolute lie''.
He told reporters: ''You can visit the Serbs and talk to them. You
will be able to see for yourself that it's not true.''
Red Cross officials interviewed some of the captured men in Bjelovar,
a town to the north, and a spokesman said their officials had also
gained access to 1,500 Serb civilians, mainly women and children, in
Pakrac.
European Union and United Nations reports differed wildly today on
whether Croatian troops who captured rebel Serb-held territory east of
Zagreb had harassed surrendering Serb soldiers and civilians.
A UN spokesman insisted Serbs had been subjected to inhuman treatment
in some cases and that looting had taken place.
But EU monitors -- as well as the United States ambassador to Croatia,
Serb civilians in one recaptured town and some Serb prisoners --
reported no violations of Serbs' rights.
''According to what we saw they were treated correctly,'' the European
Community Monitoring Mission (ECMM) ambassador to Croatia, Albert Turot,
told a news conference.
He denied that allegations of abuses by the Croat forces, which had
appeared in a strongly worded United Nations' Security Council report on
Thursday, had been based on EU information.
''There is no report yet,'' Turot said.
EU monitors in the recaptured town of Pakrac, where some of the abuses
were alleged to have taken place, told Reuters earlier that the Croat
military and police behaved professionally and correctly.
But in Zagreb, UN spokesman Chris Gunness said: ''The EU assessment
hasn't changed. The roundup of people in the streets was degrading and
inhuman.--Reuter.

<TEXT>
THE arrest of an alleged drug-dealer triggered an investigation into
the activities of a number of drug squad detectives.
Within hours of being taken into custody Mr Ronald Cormack was being
interviewed by high ranking officers from another force, a High Court
trial in Aberdeen heard yesterday.
Mr Cormack, 39, is denying charges of supplying drugs including heroin
and cocaine and being in possession of firearms.
Described as a prisoner in Aberdeen, Mr Cormack is also pleading not
guilty to placing a gun in a builder's mouth and threatening to shoot
him.
In an unusual move the procurator-fiscal of Aberdeen was also called
as a witness yesterday morning when the defence presented its case.
Mr Alf Vannet told the court the investigations into four former drugs
squad officers in Grampian began last December following the detention
of Mr Cormack.
He added that he had understood there had been concerns within the
Grampian force about certain matters for over a year.
Three policemen appeared at Aberdeen Sheriff Court in January facing a
number of corruption and drug charges. No charges have been brought
against the fourth officer, Mr Colin Clark, although he is still
suspended.
Mr Vannet was asked by defence counsel Edgar Prais, QC, whether Mr
Cormack's name had been connected with the internal police inquiry.
''The investigation which commenced in mid-December with Strathclyde
police followed the interviewing of Ronald Cormack,'' he replied.
Mr Prais asked: ''As far as the three policemen who appeared in court,
were there any allegations concerning links between them and Ronald
Cormack?''
''There was an alleged association between two of them and Ronald
Cormack,'' added Mr Vannet.
The procurator-fiscal explained that initially Mr Cormack was
questioned about the police inquiry by two senior officers with the
Scottish Crime Squad from Strathclyde.
Following that a team of officers from Strathclyde police had taken
over the inquiry.
Under questioning from Advocate Depute Andrew Lamb, Mr Vannet said
there had been no investigation into the Grampian police officers until
after Mr Cormack had been detained.
The trial continues on Tuesday when Lord Marnoch will address the
jury.

Nicholas Powell reports how Jacques Chirac, the early favourite in the
French presidential race, is getting a run for his money
THE FRENCH PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS
NOTHING is sure about the outcome of the French presidential election.
Despite a humiliatingly low score in the first round of voting on April
23, second-round victory did seem a mathematical certainty for the
Gaullist candidate, Jacques Chirac, given the division between left and
right-wing votes. Since then, however, Mr Chirac has had to negotiate a
painstaking and, to many, unconvincing patching-up with his former
Gaullist rival Edouard Balladur.
National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, who polled 15% in the first
round, has discouraged his supporters from voting for Mr Chirac, whom he
considers his party's worst enemy. Most surprisingly, Mr Chirac's
socialist opponent, Lionel Jospin, has gained both ground and
presidential stature, thanks to his unexpectedly high score on April 23,
ahead of the two Gaullist candidates, and an energetic second-round
campaign.
Opinion polls are banned during the week leading up to tomorrow's
final vote, but unofficial surveys record an ever-narrowing lead between
the two candidates -- as little as 5% according to a survey commissioned
by the RPR now separates Mr Chirac and Mr Jospin, compared with 10% in
exit polls carried out on April 23. Just as importantly, some 20% of
voters are thought to be still undecided.
Despite the increasing uncertainty of the outcome, British diplomats
have been faithfully informing the Foreign Office of which politicians
are most likely to fill most posts in a Chirac government. They have
done nothing for a hypothetical Jospin government, they say, because the
British Embassy (which earlier this year thought Mr Balladur would be
elected President), is short of information about the socialist side.
Mr Chirac and Mr Jospin met on Tuesday evening in a two-hour televised
debate, a traditional sparring match which should have been the high
point in the lengthy presidential contest. In previous years, when
ideological differences between the second-round candidates were more
pronounced, the debate has produced memorable sparks and influenced
voting. There was no such excitement this time and there will probably
be little effect.
The programme was, nevertheless, prepared with maniacal precision:
advisers from both camps negotiated details including the shape of the
debating table (a circular one was rejected in favour of a rectangular
model) and the colour of the carpet. No audience was allowed into the
television studio for fear of putting the candidates off their stroke.
Party faithful watched the debate in neighbouring studios, on video
screens.
Even if both men were visibly in the grip of stage fright, not a word
was spoken in anger. Mr Chirac and Mr Jospin indulged, instead, in a
very academic and frequently technocratic exchange of views over their
respective policies. Far from being a lively clash between left and
right, this over-courteous debate proved an almost consensual
conversation between two men so firmly in the centre of politics that
they frequently needed to prove differences existed between them.
''I hope this debate will show that our visions of society are
different, not totally opposed,'' Mr Jospin said.
Audience ratings reflected the dullness of the debate, which was
watched by fewer than 17,000,000 people compared with 20,000,000 in 1988
and 1981. Both camps afterwards claimed victory, but public opinion
seemed to conclude the result was a draw. Doubtlessly suffering from the
fatigue of a long campaign, Mr Chirac appeared tired and tense. Some
found Mr Jospin, a less familiar figure -- elected as candidate by his
party only last February -- surprisingly confident, intellectually
convincing, and well able to match Mr Chirac.
With the transcript of Tuesday's debate published in almost every
national paper as a sort of ultimate and lengthy election prospectus,
the differences and similarities between the two candidates are now, in
theory, clear to all of France's 40,000,000 voters.
Mr Chirac and Mr Jospin agree that France, while the fourth industrial
power in the world, faces a fundamental problem of division -- a
''fracture'' according to Mr Chirac -- between the haves and have-nots.
Both agree that government has become dangerously divorced from the
people.
Mr Chirac and Mr Jospin both think that France's political
institutions, as devised in 1958 by General de Gaulle when he founded
the Fifth Republic, require adjustment. Mr Chirac, who thinks
presidential power has become too ''monarchical'' wants parliament to
have a greater control over government while believing that the
presidential mandate should remain at seven years. Mr Jospin favours a
five-year mandate, has promised a referendum on the subject and quipped
on television that five years of Jospin would be better than seven years
of Chirac.
On unemployment, officially running at 3,300,000 and a declared
priority for both candidates and a subject far closer to the vast
majority of voters than modest consitutional reform, left and right-wing
differences do appear between Mr Chirac and Mr Jospin. The former
accuses his socialist opponent of wanting to set up a system which will
''drag French society down'' by merely ''sharing out shortages''. He
favours reducing social service charges on wages to encourage employers
to hire more staff and sees private companies as the motor of economic
recovery. Mr Jospin has undertaken to reduce unemployment by an
optimistic 300,000 a year. He proposes encouraging spending to increase
industrial demand by a ''controlled increase'' in salaries and a
progressive reduction of the working week from 39 to 37 hours, along
with a decrease in social service charges.
Mr Chirac and Mr Jospin differ also in their approach to France's
housing shortage, the former favouring private initiative and the second
an increase in public funding. But they differ little in their approach
to Europe, a subject barely covered in Tuesday's debate despite Mr
Chirac's declared attachment to the rights of French farmers, or
immigration -- the great obsession of the National Front and many of the
people who voted for Mr Le Pen.
JACQUES
CHIRAC
* CHIRAC, who stepped down last autumn as leader of the RPR Gaullist
Party to concentrate on his presidential campaign, is making his third
bid for the Elysee. Aged 62, Chirac was born in Paris. The only son of
an aeronautical company executive, he was raised in Correze, central
France, which he has represented in the National Assembly since 1967.
Chirac has always felt uncomfortable with the upper-middle-class
Parisian circles which dominate right-wing politics and affects a
down-to-earth and resolutely provincial image which is popular with
voters. Educated at Sciences Politiques and Ecole Nationale de
l'Administration in Paris, he volunteered for military service in
Algeria during the war of independence against France. Still in his
early thirties, he was appointed adviser to Georges Pompidou, then Prime
Minister and a man who greatly influenced his career.
Prime Minister himself to President Valery Giscard d'Estaing after the
latter's election in 1974, Chirac resigned in 1976 to found the RPR. He
was elected at the same time to the newly created and powerful post of
Mayor of Paris, which he still holds. Prime Minister again from 1986 to
1988, Chirac managed to switch from anti to timidly pro-Maastricht
during the referendum campaign on the treaty in 1992 while preserving
the unity of the RPR.
Traditionally a man of the right, he has expressed great concern for
France's 3.3 million unemployed.
LIONEL
JOSPIN
* AGED 57, Lionel Jospin was one of four children brought up in Paris
in a Protestant and left-wing family: his mother was a midwife, his
father a primary school teacher, Freemason and pacifist. Educated, like
Chirac, at Sciences Politiques Ecole Nationale de l'Administration,
Jospin received his first posting as diplomat to the economic
organisations of the United Nations. He went on to work inside the
French Foreign Office.
Drawn to the newly formed Socialist Party, Jospin met Francois
Mitterrand in 1971 and became a close adviser, climbing the party's
hierarchy to become first secretary from 1981, when Mitterrand was
elected President, to 1988, MP for a Paris constituency, Jospin's
ambitions were seriously blighted in 1984 when Mitterrand appointed
Laurent Fabius Prime Minister -- he and Jospin have remained enemies
ever since. Appointed Minister for Education in 1988, Jospin embarked on
ambitious policies.
Elected by socialists as their candidate for the presidency in
February this year, Jospin launched a vigorous campaign which was
largely ignored by his right-wing opponents, Prime Minister Edouard
Balladur and Jacques Chirac, who were too busy sniping at each other.

Christopher Dobson reports how Algeria is floundering in an ocean of
blood which could spill into Europe
THE murder of Alan Wilson of Edinburgh and four other foreign workers
by Islamic fanatics in Algeria yesterday brings the total of such
killings to 86. Horrific though this may be it, is a drop in the ocean
of blood which is being spilt in Algeria, where 40,000 people are
estimated to have been slaughtered in the past three years. The truth is
that Algeria is descending into barbarism.
It is a place where schoolgirls are dragged from their classrooms to
have their throats slit, ''le grand sourire'', simply for attending
school. It is a place where two sisters are shot down in the street
because they work for television. It is a place where Chep Hasni, a
popular singer, is murdered because his earthy lyrics affront the
Islamics. It is a place where 12 Croatian hydro-electric engineers --
all Catholics -- have their throats cut and then another slash made down
their bodies to form the sign of the cross.
It is also the place where, last Christmas, the militants hijacked an
Air France airliner, killed three hostages and planned to dive the plane
into the centre of Paris and would surely have done so if they had not
been stormed and killed by French commandos.
This sad country has been here before, during the revolt against the
French colonists when both sides inflicted unspeakable horrors on their
victims. With the coming of independence, it was thought that this
oil-rich country could look forward to peace and prosperity. Instead,
Algerians are now talking in Cambodian terms of the killing-fields of
the ''Khmer Vert''.
The roots of the present conflict lie in the complacency and
corruption of the original fighters of the National Independent Front,
grown fat in government, and the fire of fundamentalism which is
sweeping the Arab world, led by young men who fought the Russians in
Afghanistan and tasted victory against the ''infidel''.
At first the fundamentalism preached in the mosques throughout Algeria
went unregarded by the rest of the world, but the bearded young men, the
''barbus'', who took to the streets fired up with the preachings of the
mullahs, caused such trouble that the secular, socialist government was
forced to call elections in December 1991.
It was then that the world realised there was a well-organised
political-religious party, the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), behind the
wild men. Not only was it well organised, it won the first round of
voting and it became obvious that the fundamentalists would form the
next government after the second round. So, on January 11, 1992,
President Chadli Benjedid resigned and the army took over, cancelling
the election.
The bloodshed began almost immediately, with bombings and shootings in
Algiers' back streets. In July, President Muhammed Boudiaf, a
73-year-old veteran of the war of independence, was assassinated.
Brought in by the army, he had been hailed as a North African General de
Gaulle who was going to bring peace to the country. He did not stand a
chance.
The government struck back ferociously, using the same methods of
torture on the FIS that the French had used against the freedom fighters
30 years before. Both sides developed their killer groups. In 1993 the
FIS split with the ''Afghani'' extremists forming the Armed Islamic
Group (GIA). It is this group which is responsible for slitting
schoolgirls' throats, killing foreigners, setting off a car bomb which
killed 38 and carrying out the Algiers hijacking.
In retaliation, the government formed special units of black-clad
elite troops, their faces hidden behind ski-masks to prevent recognition
-- which would lead to death for their families. They rejoice in the
name of ''ninjas'', ancient Japanese warriors. And they are every bit as
cruel and as feared as the GIA in their attempts to stamp out the
Islamic rebellion.
The GIA made its first move against foreigners at the end of 1993 when
it warned that it would kill those remaining in Algeria after December
1. Some left, many did not and a month later 16 Europeans were dead,
among them, Malcolm Vincent, a 41-year-old oil worker from London.
Seven Italian seamen had their throats cut as they slept aboard their
ship in the port of Djendjen. A French priest and a nun who ran a
library in the Algiers casbah were shot dead by the GIA which boasted it
had killed ''two crusaders who had passed long years propagating evil in
Algeria''.
One of the group's leaders, who calls himself Said Allah Djaafer,
''The Sword of God'', proclaimed: ''Intellectuals are apostates and
deserve the same fate as Jews, Christians and foreigners who are part of
a colonial plot to commit profanities in our country''.
Once the killings of expatriates started so an exodus began. France,
Italy and Britain warned their nationals to leave. Something like
100,000 fled to safety, causing great harm to the country's economic
structure. Keith Bloomfield, first secretary at the British Embassy,
said: ''To some extent the Islamic terrorists are winning. Their aim is
to get foreigners to leave the country as a way to destabilise the
regime.''
The diplomats themselves came under threat at the beginning of this
year when the GIA warned several European embassies to close down or
face ''fatal consequences''. The British embassy has been reduced to a
staff of four guarded by their ''gunslingers'', a close-protection team
from the Royal Military Police.
The gunslingers are highly proficient -- the RMP served with
distinction in Beirut -- but they can only look after the diplomats.
There are an estimated 250 British citizens still in Algeria, scattered
in remote country areas on various projects, mainly of benefit to the
Algerian people. They have to rely for their protection on the
Algerians. Certainly, if the GIA mounts a full-scale attack on their
encampments they stand little chance.
The latest twist in Algeria's cruel story is the statement made on
Wednesday by GIA in the London-based Arab newspaper al-Hayat in which it
pronounces the death sentence on the wives, mothers and daughters of the
soldiers, police and government servants fighting the Islamic
extremists.
The GIA has used the Saudi-owned newspaper on several occasions to
carry its death threats. And on each occasion it has carried them out.
What next? The countries of the northern Mediterranean -- France, with
its large Algerian population, Spain and Italy, along with Germany which
has many Algerian refugees -- fear that the killings will spread with
Algerians fighting in their streets.

DELIAL, leading experts in suncare in Germany and Spain, are
introducing a new fake tan called MaxiBraun Self-Tanning Lotion. The
lotion has a soft floral fragrance and is creamy enough to glide on for
streak-free application. It is skin-friendly with its preservative-free,
dermatologically-tested formula and contains the optimum amount of DHA
which gently penetrates the skin's upper layer to produce a naturally
golden tan. It is non-drying and is not affected by other skin products
such as perfumes or deodorants. The tan takes 3 to 4 hours to develop.
For a darker finish reapply. Top up every three or four days. Delial is
in branches of Boots, Asda, Sainsburys and Lloyds priced #7.69 for the
200ml lotion and #5.99 for the 100ml cream.
* CANDLES now available in all outlets of The Body Shop are helping to
provide for two communities in need -- the homeless in the UK and a
beekeeping co-operative in East Africa. The Beeswax Candles are the
first successful product from a new initiative developed by The Big
Issue Ltd, the non-profit making concern that publishes a weekly
newspaper sold by and for the benefit of homeless people. Those involved
with the project receive a weekly wage for producing the hand-rolled
candles, which are made from beeswax from East Africa. The project will
also help vendors gain or re-gain skills in product design, marketing
and manufacture.
* IN THE UK today 91% of women and 85% of men aged 45-64 require
spectacles or contact lenses. This high figure is mainly due to a
condition called ''presbyopia'' which means that the eye cannot focus
clearly on objects in the near distance. Boots Opticians have a
selection of frames which aim to flatter the more mature customer. A
Boots eye examination costs #16.95.
* GLASGOW School of Art will be exhibiting Miao Costumes and Related
Textiles from May 11 to 26 at the Mackintosh Building. It will show a
range of clothing from the seven million Miao people located in the
remote Guizhou province of South-west China. They have a heritge of
sophisticated weaving and exquisite embroidery. Cotton, wool, hemp and
silk hand-woven fabrics are used alongside modern materials. Each
community has its own motifs and styles which vary in stitch, colour and
design. For further information, contact Kathy Chambers, Monday-Thursday
9.30am-8.30pm.
* TESCO hae added two new hairsprays to their Salon Professional
haircare system. These are Salon Professional Firm Hold Hairspray --
styling strength 15 -- and Salon Professional Supreme Hold Hairspray --
styling strength 25. Both are formulated with Panthenol. Each can
retails at #2.59 for a 175ml aerosol. Tesco have also launched a new
range of spray colognes. Called Tesco Eaux la Fraiche Body Spritzers,
they have been made in France by a leading perfumier and come in three
different fragrances. Only #3.99 for a 250ml bottle. No products have
been tested on animals.
* REVLON revolutionises the look for spring with glamour. The company
is showcasing two ''faces''. The Classic Face -- a sheer nude look with
understated eyes and extrovert lips; and the Dramatic Face --
smouldering eyes and a bold mouth. The new products include Revlon Age
Defying Makeup at #13.50, Revlon New Complexion Blush at #12, Revlon
Living Lipstick at #8.95 and Revlon Innerlash Mascara at #9.95.
* THE recent Herald/Armani fashion show and party held at The Tramway,
Glasgow, has realised #8000 for charity. This sum will be divided
equally between The Herald Foundation for Women's Health which is
raising money for a special gynaecological treatment clinic at the Royal
Infirmary, Glasgow, and Scottish European Aid which works among victims
in Bosnia and Romania. We would like to thank all readers who
participated in this memorable event.

DEEDEE CUDDIHY on a tenement testament that pulls no punches
IT'S often claimed that kids these days are out of control and have no
respect for their elders, but according to a new exhibition at
Springburn Museum in Glasgow, it has always been that way.
The Tenement Folk examines a boy's life in Springburn during the
period 1911-1926 when youngsters were expected to make their own
entertainment.
This was a challenge that Andrew Lillie and his pals apparently rose
to with gusto. Now aged 84, Mr Lillie spent the first 15 years of his
life in Springburn and had such happy memories of the place that on his
retirement from Glasgow Corporation, where he worked as an architect, he
decided to make a meticulous record, in words and highly detailed
watercolour paintings, of his Springburn youth.
The paintings and manuscript along with lists of what had been sold in
local paper, toy and sweetie shops, lay undisturbed in his south-side
home until Eileen Gordon of Springburn Museum heard about them and
decided to investigate.
''I was stunned when Mr Lillie showed me his work,'' she recalls.
''There, in a corner of the sitting room, were the makings of an entire
exhibition -- including the title, The Tenement Folk, which is what he
had called the project.''
A year later, Andrew Lillie's childhood has come to life in the museum
in Atlas Square, where a selection of his watercolours plus accompanying
descriptions has been complemented by a tenement kitchen (including an
aspidistra plant ordered specially for the show), a ''cludgie'' and a
classroom, re-created from the museum's own collection of period
objects.
In The Tenement Folk, Mr Lillie doesn't gloss over the fact that while
he may have been willing to go a message for his pipe-smoking old
granny, he was no angel when it came to the rough and tumble of everyday
Springburn life.
The exhibition recalls schoolbag bashing; the chucking of stones,
clods of earth and snowballs at a variety of targets including girls,
rival gangs and the school;attacking ''the enemy'' using a battery of
weapons fashioned from lumps of wood and metal umbrella spokes; the
constant lighting of bonfires; spitting water at adults; kicking muddy
footballs into clean washing and what Mr Lillie fondly refers to as his
first ''jellie-nosed, black-eyed'' fight.
And you thought your kids were badly behaved.
A series of workshops where people of all ages can have a go at making
their own wally close tile -- as once found in superior Springburn
tenements -- is being held at the museum this month. Contact Eileen
Gordon on 0141-557 1405 for details.

A VERY sick old man got out of a chauffeur driven Renault 25 at 4pm
last Wednesday near to the Carrousel bridge over the Seine, walked down
to the bank and threw a bunch of lily of the valley into the water.
It is the flower traditionally sold throughout France on May 1, Labour
Day, and President Mitterrand had chosen the riverside spot where two
days earlier a gang of skinheads had split off from the National Front
march through the capital to throw 29-year-old Moroccan Brahim Bouarram
into the river and drown him.
''We must seize every occasion to explain, explain and explain again
that the French are not racists. But there are lunatics, there are
criminals, and they do not deserve pity,'' the president said, before
slipping back to Elysee Palace, leaving the bridge to be taken over by
thousands of protesters who demonstrated against the murder of Bouarram
and against the National Front.
Police have launched a massive investigation into what NF leader
Jean-Marie Le Pen described as ''an incident'' but with no results.
Thirty skinheads, 11 of whom had taken part in the extreme right-wing
rally and 18 of whom have police files, were taken in for questioning
and put on ID parades behind a one-way mirror for three people who
witnessed the drowning.
Officers say their action was largely aimed at placating public
opinion. Only when the fuss has died down, they say, will they be able
to settle down to serious in-depth inquiries.
For President Mitterrand, savouring the last days of his 14-year stint
in the Elysee, Wednesday's informal riverside ceremony was the last in a
series of gestures performed over the years to arouse public opinion
against racism.
Such behaviour may seem paradoxical -- or indeed penetential -- on the
part of a man who worked in the wartime Vichy government and then
pursued a long friendship with Rene Bousquet, the Vichy police chief who
deported thousands of Jews to death camps.
But five years ago, after Jewish tombs were profaned in the cemetery
of Carpentras in the south of France (another unsolved mystery),
Mitterrand took part in a huge protest demonstration in the streets of
Paris.
In December 1986, he visited the family of Malik Oussekine, a North
African student killed by police during a demonstration. And before
that, he had helped to set up the anti-racist association, SOS Racisme,
which is still active.
Socialist candidate Lionel Jospin said yesterday that if he were
elected it may prove necessary to provide far tougher policing of NF
demonstrations. But he ruled out banning the organisation.
He naturally refrained from saying Le Pen's party was partly a
political monster of Mitterrand's making. It was the president who
introduced proportional representation (later scrapped by Jacques Chirac
as Prime Minister) which got the NF into the National Assembly.
The aim of the president, who also pushed for Le Pen to get time on
television, was to weaken and divide traditional right-wing parties, and
he succeeded.
Judging by his occasional public statements, Mitterrand will leave
office this weekend with no nagging doubts as to the wisdom or indeed
the social cost of such political manoeuvres.
Illness in the form of prostate cancer he has been fighting for two
years is his main concern. He has said on several occasions that he
knows his life will be short. Just a few weeks ago, he said he simply
hoped he would make it to May 7 and the second round of the presidential
poll.
The next few days offer a sort of apotheosis for a man whose one
consistent commitment during a very varied career has been to Europe.
Monday will see Mitterrand putting the aftermath of Sunday's election
aside to host VE Day celebrations in Paris, which culminate in
wreath-laying ceremonies at the Arc de Triomphe. Then, as Mitterrand has
decided the war in Chechnya should not interfere with remembering the
victory over Nazism, he will travel to Moscow to attend celebrations
there.
No date has been settled but Elysee officials said yesterday the
formal ceremony of passing on power to Mitterrand's successor will take
place around May 20, by which time a new government will have been
formed.
Former President Mitterrand will then share his time between his home
on the Left Bank in Paris and his retreat at Latche in southwest France.

Jim Hewitson finds lessons for VE Day in the Auld Alliance
HOW, I wonder, will the centenary, or indeed the 700th anniversary, of
VE Day be marked in a world unimaginably different from the one we
inhabit today? Will it be celebrated at all with the principal actors
long gone, with new political and cultural structures, on a planet
radically altered by environmental and scientific changes, the scale of
which we can hardly begin to imagine?
My hunch is that it will be. We may get a few pointers to the future
from the current celebrations of the Auld Alliance, formalised by a
treaty between France and Scotland in 1295.
The fact is that although we like to think there is still a special
relationship between France and Scotland the festivities are lopsided;
it's basically a Scottish bash. We are a small nation reminding
ourselves of times distant when we played an interesting, if peripheral,
role in European politics but more importantly of the fact that we are a
nation still -- not a region, district, canton, province, department,
county, or bailiwick, but a nation with our own history which makes us
no greater, or lesser, than others but most assuredly makes us
different.
The lesson is that as long as the United Kingdom remains an
identifiable unit, the sacrifice of millions, the comradeship of VE Day,
will be cherished. But will the UK last the course or will it be
swallowed by the vast European state? Your guess is as good as mine.
What the Auld Alliance does show is that as long as national identity
remains intact, anniversaries can survive all sorts of political and
military turmoil. In fact, even in the most taxing of circumstances a
bit if humour can cement age-old ties.
Let's consider a period when La Vieille Alliance was well and truly on
the back-burner -- the Napoleonic wars. During this conflict of the
early 1800s, in which Scots regiments of the British Army performed with
valour against the forces of France, there was a little-known French
''invasion'' of Scotland. Up to 14,000 French PoWs were quartered all
over Scotland from 1811 onwards.
Main camps for the rank and file were at Greenlaw in the Borders, at
Perth, Fort George (Inverness), and at Valleyfield and Esk papermills in
the Lothians. Officers were paroled to Lanark, Hawick, Lauder, Kelso,
Jedburgh, Selkirk, Cupar, Melrose, Peebles, Biggar, Lockerbie,
Lochmaben, Sanquhar, and Dumfries, where folk tales of French officers
twirling their 'taches, gesticulating madly, duelling beside the Nith,
and organising frog and hedgehog hunts in the countryside to supplement
larders, were still being told at the start of this century.
In 1812, a group of French officers was lodged at the town's Old Buck
Inn. One town worthy called George Hair is reported to have earned his
first ''siller'' as a boy ''gathering paddocks for the Frenchmen''.
HOWEVER, the classic story of these frog hunts and their repercussions
concerns a Mr Renwick who, as principal in a St Crispin's Day procession
in the town, was invited to dine with the French officers, Crispin of
course being patron saint of shoemakers -- and French.
An impressive spread was provided including a pie which ''Maister
Renwick thocht was made o' rabbits, toshed up in some newfangled way an'
didna' miss to lay in a good stock''. The story's magnificent conclusion
can only be told in the original Dumfries patois. ''Syne they lauched
and speered him if he kent whit the pie wis made of . . . but he wisna'
sure. When they tell't him it was paddocks, it was as if they had gied
him a dose o' pizzen. He just banged up and breenged aboot the hoose . .
. oor bit winnock looked oot in the French man's backyard, an' saw
Maister Renwick sair, sair forfochen, but after a dainty bit warsle, he
an' the paddocks pairted company.'' A bientot.

FOR less than the best of reasons, L S Lowry's depiction of the
celebrations of VE-Day has become one of the best known of the pictures
in the collection of Glasgow Museums and Art Galleries.
Apart from being an instantly recognisable example of the artist's
celebrated ''matchstick people'' style, the picture had probably caused
few second glances at a charity ball in Kelvingrove in March, 1992,
which is why nobody noticed it had gone until an hour after the function
had finished.
It was recovered six months later in the back of a car in Edinburgh
and a man was subsequently jailed for 18 months for being in possession
of it. But in the interim it had been folded up ''like a map'', as
deputy director of the galleries, Stewart Coulter, told the High Court
in Edinburgh.
The damage caused to the canvas by the folds cost some #800 to repair,
and the work was in the hands of the conservators for many months before
being rehung at Kelvingrove on Christmas Eve, 1993.
All the attention has, however, probably done the Lowry no lasting
harm in terms of its popularity. Bought during the Honeyman era at
Glasgow Art Gallery, it could hardly compete with the more controversial
acquisition of Dali's Christ of St John on the Cross, but it remains one
of Lowry's finest works.
Painted in 1945 and set in an unidentified town still clearly in the
industrial North of England that was Lowry's stamping ground, it was
purchased through Glasgow agents T &amp; R Allan for #135. It is now thought
to be worth #200,000.
Lowry was born in Rusholme, Manchester, on November 1, 1887, and died,
aged 88, in 1976. He began studying painting while working a clerk and
his work was recognised locally before being taken up by London. His
continued popularity in the North of England was reflected in honorary
doctorates from Manchester, Salford, and Liverpool universities and --
in 1965 -- in the freedom of the city of Salford. An only child who
never married, he lived a very reclusive life after the death of his
mother in 1939.
VE-Day had been exhibited in 1945 at Lowry's second one-man show at
London's Lefevre Gallery, which championed him. A review of that show in
the Manchester Guardian summed up the appeal of his work to succeeding
generations: ''Here is a completely independent artist with a subject
matter of his own and a style which has nothing to do with current
fashion.'' It is only more recently that other commentators, including
the current director of Glasgow Galleries, Julian Spalding, have argued
that the obsession with Lowry's distinctiveness has blinded critics to
the range of his work.
In 1985 a smaller version of the picture came up at a sale at
Christies, confusingly entitled VJ-Day. However, there is no doubt that
the artist was depicting the celebrations of May, 1945, since he refers
to the picture as VE-Day in a typewritten note on file at Kelvingrove
which transfers copyright from the artist to the Glasgow collection.

Lesley Duncan meets a straight-talking painter whose compositions are
on the curve
ROD McCance describes himself as ''the bendy artist''. This is no
reflection on his person (upright, bearded, and pipe-smoking) nor on his
probity. The bendiness refers merely to one of the characteristics of
his paintings -- a tendency to put compositional curves on what are, in
real life, straight objects such as walls, furnishings, and books. The
joke is typical of his genial self-mockery. We are not dealing here with
an artist with a capital A and an outsize ego to match.
Much about Rod McCance is unexpected -- down to his location in the
village of Strathyre in Rob Roy country. The drive past Ben Ledi (still
spattered in snow) and up Loch Lubnaig side is at its prettiest these
days with daffodils still out and larches showing green on the
surrounding hillsides.
The McCance menage is up an outside stair where the household cats and
fuchsias were sunning themselves when I visited. Perhaps it was the
large floppy bow tie atop checked shirt and corduroys, but Rod McCance
was instantly reminiscent of Charles Rennie Mackintosh. The similarity
doesn't extend to their pictures. The first impression of the McCance
canvases, lining the walls and stacked in various corners of the neat
1930s-style rooms, is of being socked in the eye by violent colour and
aggressive abstract form. The second impression is much the same.
This -- one might instantly decide -- is painting in Picasso (of the
cubist period) style with a dash of Braque and Leger thrown in. But it
would be unfair to dismiss McCance's work as derivative. He is an
original spirit. His compulsion to paint is absolute. He has no idea, he
says, whether his work will be critically viewed as ''good, bad, or just
rubbish,'' but ''it's not going to stop me painting''.
He takes an equally robust view of other people's artistic endeavours.
''To put it bluntly when I go out and see some of the work produced it
makes me wonder . . . '' References to esoteric nonsense ensue. ''I wish
I'd sprayed dustbin lids with flock 20 years ago!''
His path to full-time artist was an unusual one. He was born in
Hamilton in 1950, into a family with a background in coalmining,
engineering, and art. His father was a vet. In spite of having the
distinguished artist and critic William McCance (1894-1970) as a great
uncle, the young Roderick was ''rapped across the fingers'' if he
displayed any artistic tendencies at all.
Brought up in the East End of Glasgow, he studied textiles at
Clydesdale College after leaving school and then went into the retail
trade for many years, buying and selling cloth.
His career took an upward turn when he became a professional
stiltwalker with a ''proper troupe''. Then he joined the engineering
firm of Glynwed International, working as ''a trouble-shooter on the
heating and cooker side''. Made redundant in the recession of the
mid-eighties, he started painting -- though the seed had been sown
perhaps a quarter of a century earlier in conversations with his
great-uncle Willie.
After a distinguished career in England and Wales, the older man had
returned to Scotland to live in Girvan. In school holidays and student
days the young Rod would visit the old artist and they would discuss
''putting the world to rights''.
If there is one seminal influence on Rod McCance it must be this
friend and collaborator of Hugh MacDiarmid and art critic of The
Spectator in the 1920s. A monograph in the Scottish Masters series gives
some idea of William McCance's many-sided talents. Even without the
benefit of colour, the black-and-white reproductions show a flair for
composition in strong, cubist, semi-abstract forms as well as a taste
for moralistic symbolism, for example in his Hiroshima (Atom Horizon),
of 1947.
There is a similar didactic element in much of Rod McCance's work,
whether he is lamenting the decline of the Scottish steel and
shipbuilding industries or pointing out the fatal consequences of
drunken or careless driving. His Machine Men and the Clouds of War, for
example, shows robot men in Beardmore's making shells in wartime.
The workers' reduced humanity is highlighted by their round, grey
balls of heads, from one of which a fag is hanging. Threatening steel
forms and a stylised Glasgow tree curve in characteristically to frame
the scene. A similar canvas shows the last trickle of steel being made
at Ravenscraig by a robotic operative surrounded by a jumble of
machinery, cooling tower, and furnace.
Ghosts of the Clyde is a similar comment on the demise of
shipbuilding. The three great queen liners are shown ''pedestalised'',
stranded, within modern Glasgow while trees in tubs threaten to grow
60ft high and ''fall over and hit punters''. ''Punters'' loom large in
the McCance vocabulary; toppling trees in pedestrian precincts seem to
be a minor obsession.
Death of a Joy Rider was made into a poster by Central Scotland
Police. A pile of mangled machinery makes its point graphically without
recourse to gore. A child's blanket and pram ram home the message.
Missing on Exercise commemorates the crash of a low-flying RAF jet near
Loch Earn and also the ending of the Second World War. Perhaps this
preoccupation with distorted machinery can be traced back to McCance's
engineering years.
He has, of course, other themes. His ''Chesterfield'' series with
''bendy'' sofas is on such a grand scale that the best way to exit with
a canvas, suggests McCance's partner Annie, would be to hang-glide with
it. There are still lifes with a certain erotic content. The ''willy
pears'' are self-explanatory. The ''Bendy Hooses'' series shows Scots
baronial edifices hemmed in by curved walls (''Perhaps it's the Scottish
nation walling itself up from outside forces,'' says McCance).
Rod McCance has had exhibitions at the MacRobert Centre, Stirling
University, and in Perth. Though buyers of his work range from
''20-year-olds to 80-year-olds'', recognition through purchase by public
galleries has so far eluded him. ''I'd hang my stuff in a gents' lavvie
and let people see it,'' says the unabashed artist.

AND then it was over, and the festivities were joyful. We were a
country hiding our heartbreak in a tide of celebration and triumph. But
relief was the main emotion.
For many the pain lingered, the sorrow went deep. But it was time to
begin a new era and to recover from the exhaustion of the previous
years. It was not to be easy. Everything was rationed and was to stay
rationed -- sometimes for years.
After a small relaxation of the stringent rules and regulations to
celebrate VE-Day, a whole range of food and other consumables went back
on the ration and some, particularly confections, stayed that way until
1953.
Clothes, shoes, food, vegetables, bread, petrol, soap, sugar, even
men's socks or ladies' lisle thread stockings, were strictly rationed.
A real egg was a rarity in towns and cities and the substitute, yellow
powdered egg, which could be conjured into a heavy lump to resemble an
omelette, was one little packet a month per ration book. And it cost 1s
3d (7p), which was not cheap in 1945.
Rationing was a fact of life, the normal routine of day-to-day living
for families in 1945. Housewives, mothers did not ''go shopping'' in
those days. They went for the rations. And they had to be armed with the
family ration books to buy anything.
0 There were three kinds of ration books -- a khaki one for adults, a
blue one for children up to 16, and a green one for babies. The green
one was the most prized because it entitled mothers to extra rations of
the scarce commodities, like bottled orange juice or even real fruit if
any became available.
Rumours ran through every tenement or housing scheme about which
grocer had extra tea or sugar or what butcher had an allocation of
unrationed pork or liver. But having a ration book was no guarantee the
food would be available.
There was a flourishing black market, but money was very tight. A
working man putting in long hours of overtime might just make #6 a week.
A job was advertised in a Woolworth restaurant washing dishes. The wage
was #2.5s a week (#2.25).
To get these kind of wages into perspective a pair of boys' school
trousers in a Glasgow draper's shop were advertised at 15s (75p)
providing you had the clothing coupons. A lady's navy coat, a luxury
item, was #7, again only if you had the coupons. But like every other
commodity coupons could be bought.
And for the well-off there was the chance to put the family car back
on the road. There had been a total ban on motoring from 1942. Petrol
was too precious for the war effort. Now that Germany was defeated the
Government allowed a ration of four gallons of petrol a month for a
small car and up to six gallons for a limousine. That concession began a
brisk trade in old pre-war cars. A 1939 Standard 10 could be bought for
#125.
One of the controversies raging in May, 1945, and which caused a huge
row in Parliament, was the price of domestic coal. This was before
nationalisation. The price of a ton of coal at the pit-head was 34s 6d
(#1.73p) but it soared to #5 a ton to the consumer.
Whisky distillers were still advertising their wares but the scarcity
was enormous, even if the price of a bottle was 25s 9d (about #1.29p).
In today's terms that would make the price of a bottle of whisky more
than #70.
Elsewhere little luxuries began to creep back into the economy.
Peaches went on sale in street markets in London at the enormous price
of 3s 6d each (18p).
Austerity was still the watchword. The clothes ration was just 66
coupons per adult per year. Copelands, the big Glasgow store, was
offering Harris and Lewis tweed lengths at 13s 10d a yard (69p).
There was a huge shortage of labour with much of the manpower still in
the armed forces. Many women stayed on in heavy industries and families
were encouraged to take late holidays so they could go into the country
to help with the harvests. Thousands of people did.
In the building trade the working week was cut from 60 to 54 hours a
week and the shipyard workers won an extra 4s 6d (23p) a week on their
basic rate.
Property prices were, by today's standards, laughably low but ordinary
Scots in those days had never contemplated buying a house. In Glasgow a
tenement in Windsor Street with 12 houses was offered for sale at #2700
for the lot. In Broomhill a four-bedroom bungalow with a maid's room
could be had for #700 and in Milngavie a pub, three shops, and various
dwelling houses was for sale at #2000.
In Edinburgh a house in Castle Place with eight rooms and two basement
rooms was on the market for #1800 and a posh Corstorphine bungalow could
be yours for #850.
And if you were seriously rich the Catrine Estate in Ayrshire with a
mansion house, three farms, two steadings, and 330 acres was on offer at
an upset price of #12,500.
Today, 50 years on, it all seems bizarre. But older people who lived
through it still retain bitter-sweet memories of that time of sadness
and hope.

Reflections on the great changes effected by the hostilities, the jet
age begins and jazz entertainer sings outside Buckingham PalaceVE-DAY
began with violent thunderstorms lashing the country. For many it was
known as VQ-Day because of the endless queues for food and everything
was rationed -- even bathwater was restricted to five inches. But the
outlook was already less bleak. The Daily Mirror succumbed to the
demands of the troops and printed a picture of the popular comic strip
heroine Jane -- in the nude.
It had been a hard few years. By June, 1944, almost one in three men,
and half a million women, were in the armed forces. Six and a half per
cent of homes had been destroyed in air raids.
A million tons of iron railings had been collected from parks and
gardens to be melted down for armaments. In the first few days of the
war 400,000 pets were put down.
There were more than 60 million changes of addresses in the war years,
some due to bombing but many the result of mass evacuation. Often city
people moved anyway, out of fear, to live with more rural friends or
relatives. Millions more, known as ''trekkers'', worked in London but
fled to the relative safety of the surrounding countryside each night.
In the countryside, 90,000 women worked in the Women's Land Army.
Seven-and-a-half million women were conscripted for other war work. The
two-million-strong Home Guard, trained to guard against invasion, was
finally disbanded at the end of 1944.
Staple foods like butter, cheese, and jam, which we now take for
granted, were in short supply, and food rationing was to last for
another 10 years.
A modern legacy of the time is white lines on the road. As car
headlights could not be used, the lines were intended to guide drivers
during black-out.
The end of the black-out did not, however, mean a return to normality.
The curtains came down and car headlights could be used again, but joy
was soon tempered by the reality of power cuts, and demands by the
Government for energy saving.
Some of the more unusual wartime restrictions meant it was illegal to
buy Ordnance Survey maps or have a radio in your car. Nor could you
sleep in a non-camouflaged tent or sound a factory siren.
The Second World War saw the beginning of the jet age. A Gloster
Meteor from the RAF's 616 Squadron shot down a flying bomb, in the first
ever allied jet aircraft success.
On VE-Day ships signalled morse code ''V'' for victory across the
airwaves. Statues and public buildings were floodlit for the first time
in five years, reportedly terrifying some young children. Spontaneous
street parties were held and jubilant crowds pushed Winston Churchill,
in his car, from 10 Downing Street to the House of Commons.
Humphrey Lyttelton, then a Guards officer, gave an impromptu concert
from a handcart being pulled along the Mall, St James's Street, and
Trafalgar Square before ending up outside Buckingham Palace with a
rendition of He's a Jolly Good Fellow delivered in the direction of the
King. Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret broke with royal tradition and
joined the throng outside the palace.
Despite the festivities of VE-Day there was continued hardship and it
was a long time before normality was restored. Petrol became scarce, and
clothes rationing continued for another five years. The hostilities had
left many without shelter. In the year following the end of the war,
46,000 homeless people moved into newly emptied military camps. Sixty
thousand British women abandoned the UK for the relative prosperity of
the US and Canada to become GI brides.
The United Nations was formed in 1945.
Since 1945 there have been at least 160 wars, resulting in 13.5
million deaths.

CELEBRATING Mr Purcell is a clever idea from the Scottish Early Music
Consort. Two actors, four singers, musicians, and the chorus play and
sing excerpts from those hybrid music dramas for which Purcell wrote so
many pieces. Linking the scenes is an imaginary chance meeting between
the famous Restoration actor-manager, Thomas Betterton, and leading
actress of her day Mrs Bracegirdle as they lay tributes to their
recently deceased composer friend and theatrical collaborator. John Bett
and Juliet Cadzow breathe life into these pivotal roles with just the
right degree of campness to disguise the less convincing acting skills
of the vocalists.
Bett and Cadzow were given first-half dialogue that tended to the
heavy handed when filling in on details of Purcell's career, but they
sparkled when handed some witty, bitchy exchanges of gossip about their
characters' rival thespians.
Devised, scripted, and staged by Kate Brown, she used a minimal
setting and black costumes as a backdrop to accent flashes of rich
materials, a plumed hat, feathery pink angels' wings, a bowl of blue
light. Much use was also made of entries down the centre aisle of this
venue which added to a real sense of contact between players and
audience.
Of the singers, Lorna Anderson and Henry Herford impressed greatly,
both totally in command of their material and its presentation.
The chorus may not have had much to do but what they did was
superlative, from their opening Funeral Lament to a highly effective
realisation, with floating white masks, of a scene of The Indian Queen.
Altogether an entertaining dip into Purcell's theatrical world.

EVENTS are being held throughout Scotland to commemorate the fiftieth
anniversary of VE Day. People in cities, towns, villages, and hamlets
are remembering the end of the war in Europe with services, parades, and
many other activities.
The Army, the Scottish Office, and the Royal British Legion (Scotland)
are co-operating in the programme. RAF units in Scotland will support
many of the events.
More than 600 veterans have been invited to a commemoration service in
St Giles' in Edinburgh on Monday. It will be attended by the Princess
Royal and followed by a reception for veterans in Parliament Hall.
Tomorrow will see events in a wide variety of places, including
Hawick, Kirkcaldy, Glasgow, Roslin, Elgin, Keith, Buckie, Stornoway, St
Andrews, Wick, Forfar, Longniddry, the Shetland Islands, Peterhead,
Dumbarton, St Andrews, and Biggar.
On Monday, ships at Aberdeen will be decorated and sound their horns.
There will be events at Fort William, Beauly, Nairn, Ayr, Dumfries,
Dingwall, Dundee, and several places in Fife including Glenrothes,
Kirkcaldy, Ladybank, and Anstruther.
Music recalling the war years will be played at a charity concert
organised by Braids Rotary Club in the Usher Hall, Edinburgh, on Monday.
It will be provided by the Highland Band of the Scottish Division, the
Jubilo Choir, and the Flora Stevenson primary school choir, with Alison
MacDonald as soloist. Actress Eileen McCallum will be compere.
The biggest United Kingdom military parade outside London will be in
Perth tomorrow, when more than 300 massed pipes and drums, troops,
cadets, and veterans will march from Bell's Sports Centre through the
city.
The Provost of Perth and Kinross District, Mrs Jean McCormack, will
unveil a memorial to the 51st (Highland) Division on the North Inch. The
memorial, a life-size bronze of a Highland piper being presented with a
posy by a young girl, represents the empathy forged between the division
and the people of Europe whom it liberated. It is a replica of one
unveiled on October 22 last year in the village of Veghel, Holland, by
the British Ambassador to the Hague, when 200 veterans attended.
The ceremony will be attended by Lieutenant General Sir Derek Lang,
who escaped after the surrender of the original 51st Highland Division
at St Valery in 1940. The survivors joined the 9th (Highland) Infantry
Division, redesignated the 51st (Highland) Division.
Sir Derek returned to France as commanding officer of the 5th
battalion the Cameron Highlanders in July, 1944, and led it to Germany.
In Glasgow, in association with Mayfest, the Barras Enterprise Trust
will promote a two-day event tomorrow and on Sunday, called A Trip down
Memory Lane.

Addis Ababa, Friday
AT least 15 people were killed and 10 wounded when a bomb exploded at
a busy market in the eastern Ethiopian town of Dire Dawa, witnesses said
today.
They said the blast last night -- three days before Ethiopia's first
multi-party general elections -- hit crowds in the main Chat Tera
market, where the mild stimulant qat is sold.
One witness reached by telephone from Addis Ababa told Reuters that an
unidentified attacker tossed a hand grenade into the market, mainly used
by ethnic Somalis. The witness said he saw eight bodies at the scene.
He and other witnesses said at least 15 people were killed and 10
wounded. There was no immediate official comment.
It was the worst reported violence in the run-up to the polls, which
are expected to result in a landslide victory for the ruling Ethiopian
People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF).
Dire Dawa, which was founded in 1900 on the main railway line to
Djibouti, is a special administrative area and like the rest of Ethiopia
holds elections for a national parliament on Sunday.
But polls for regional assemblies were delayed until May 27 because of
a dispute over some areas just outside the town which are contested
between the Oromo and Somali ethnic groups.
The main opposition groups including the Oromo Liberation Front are
boycotting the elections, arguing they were organised to serve only the
EPRDF so it will dominate the new government.--Reuter.

Tokyo, Friday
INGREDIENTS to release poisonous cyanide gas were found today in a
crowded Tokyo underground station toilet.
Police sent to a fire in the men's toilet at Shinjuku station found
two bags, one containing sodium cyanide and another containing diluted
sulphuric acid.
Combined they can produce poisonous gas.
One of the bags had caught fire, but both were removed without
incident.
Police were investigating the incident as an attempted murder.
More than one million people pass daily through the station, one of
Japan's busiest.
A March 20 poison gas attack on the Tokyo underground killed 12 people
and injured more than 5500. Three suspected copycat crimes have occurred
since then, causing minor injuries.--AP

THE studio is almost pitch dark. A tall figure in all-white rises from
a chair, picks something up -- and the air is suddenly filled with these
cracking, swooshing sounds. It's like a flock of birds. Or sails in a
stiff breeze. And then it changes, into something softer. Slithering
sounds. Then lighter. Fluttering, like curtains at an open window.
When the light comes up, Peter McRae repeats this sequence. This time
we can see, as well as hear, the flags he uses. We can watch the flow of
different materials through air, appreciate the effects of material
weight, the particular sounds and movement of fine cotton as opposed to
heavy canvas or slippery thin silk.
The third time he makes the moves, there's music -- a cunning collage
of snatches from national anthems, tunes that one is automatically
tempted to match to his flag-waving actions. By the end of the short
piece, Air in Three Movements, McRae has made us use our senses just
that little bit more intensely, made us think about something
commonplace -- like a flag -- from pleasingly fresh angles.
As his programme notes show, Sarbjit Samra is passionately engaged in
discerning those hidden mechanisms within popular culture that so
influence our cultural attitudes and desires. These complex notes
probably leave audiences unprepared for what they get. For Samra --
having accumulated his intricate subtext -- then compresses it into a
central image which blends visual iconography with carefully selected
music. Having done his thinking, he now intends that we should do ours.
In Breastfeeding, a CCA commision, his head bobs amidst a huge froth
of white balloons, occasionally dribbling milk, or crying, while a
succession of sudsy pop songs reinforces cliched images of
happy-ever-after romance, togetherness, mutual cosy dependency. His
targets here include soap operas and pre-digested pap entertainment --
but in order to arrive at his conclusions for yourself, you have to ask
yourself a lot of questions: you have to look well beyond the balloons
to burst the illusions he wants you to explode.

STEPHEN McGINTY hears how the French have paid their own tribute to a
Scots hero
IN 1986 three young Frenchmen went off to war. Battling through paper
stacks and bureaucracy, Francois Cadic, Claude Helias, and Nicolas
Guiffant founded the Histoire Et Collections.
A decade later it has now preserved in print the military events of
Finistere, on Brittany's western tip. For Douglas Welch, 63, these three
Frenchmen have paid the final tribute to a story which was not his own,
yet began 51 years ago as he mowed the grass in his parents' garden in
Greenock.
The year was 1944, and when his mother called him in he knew there had
been a telegram. His brother, Roy Welch, a navigator in RAF squadron
617, the heirs of the dambusters, was missing after a daring noon raid
on the U-boat pens off Brest.
On Saturday, August 5, 16 Lancaster bombers took off from Britain,
each carrying a single 12,000lb ''tall boy'' bomb. Only a direct hit on
the roof of the reinforced concrete pens would destroy the boats with
debris.
But daylight brought flak from anti-aircraft guns and so the squadron
flew at 16,000 ft in a bid to avoid it. Roy Welch was flying his 35th
operation, his luck could not last, and the plane, Dark Victor, was hit.
The bottom of the plane was struck by flak which badly injured Roy,
gunner Noel Wait, and wireless operator Reg Pool. The bomb was quickly
ditched in Brest harbour. The pilot, Canadian Don Cheney, flew a further
25 miles before flames forced the crew to bale out over the fishing port
of Douarnenez.
All three injured men drowned. Bomb-aimer Len Curtis was captured,
while Ken Porter, Jim Rosher, and Don Cheney were rescued by the
Resistance who were fighting pitched battles throughout the town.
Ironically Douarnenez was liberated by the French Resistance two days
later.
To this day the RAF have never confirmed the death of Roy Welch, whose
body was washed ashore 10 days later and buried with honours by the
townsfolk. Over the past 40 years Douglas Welch has returned to the town
to visit the grave and Madame Leshout, who made sure that the graves
were never without blooms.
In 1993 he was invited by Histoire Et Collections to attend a memorial
service and exhibition to the heroes of the town, both Resistance and
Allied airmen.
The details of the flight of Dark Victor are reported in a book, Le
Pays De Douarnenez, and last year the organisation held a remembrance
ceremony for the 50th anniversary of the crash.
''I was very pleased that people with no connection to the crew and
who were not even born at the time would be so interested and do so
much. It was touching that the people of Douarnenez were so grateful for
what the RAF did,'' said Mr Welch, a retired English teacher, living in
Dundee.
A survivor of Dark Victor's last flight, flight engineer Jim Rosher,
who was smuggled by the Resistance back to Britain after the crash, has
twice returned for remembrance ceremonies.
Mr Rosher, 72, who now lives in Troon, was delighted at the reception.
He said: ''They took us out by ship to the lighthouse near the bay and
we rested over the spot where the plane went down. It was very moving.
It's so nice that our work has not been forgotten.''
To continue its mission to preserve the memory of Allied airmen who
were shot down in the area, the organisation is trying to contact
relatives of Flying Officer Robert Wylie Thomson, DFC, 138057, RAF (VR).
He is buried in the cemetery at Benodet, Finistere.
Flying Officer Thomson, 21, was the son of Archibald Thomson and
Catherine Thomson, formerly Wylie, of Rutherglen, Lanarkshire. He was a
navigator on one of three Mosquitos in 248 Squadron. His aircraft,
Mosquito LN 339, was hit by flak and crashed in Benodet. The pilot, Wing
Commander Anthony Dolkray Phillips, was also killed.
Flying Officer Thomson received the Distinquished Flying Cross for his
many previous operational sorties. ''We want to preserve the memory of
the Allied airmen who were shot down in our area,'' said Claude Helias.
''We have been involved in the ceremony which took place in Benodet to
pay tribute to Wing Commander A D Phillips and Flying Officer R W
Thomson on July 14, 1994.''
Though the organisation has mounted exhibitions in the past it plans
to culminate its work with the creation of a permanent World War Two
museum. To Mr Welch and the remaining survivors of Dark Victor it will
be a deserving tribute.
Relatives of Flying Officer R.W. Thomson can contact the Histoire Et
Collections through: Claude Helias, Ty-Ar-Groas, 29700 Plomelin, France.

Oklahoma City, Friday
THE gaping shell of a bombed federal building in Oklahoma City stood
silent at last today after search crews gave up their grim 15-day quest
for bodies.
But the hunt continued for America's most wanted man, a suspect in the
bombing who has eluded one of the most intense investigations in US
history for more than two weeks.
Firefighters said 164 people were known to have died in the building,
not including nurse Rebecca Anderson, 37, who was killed by falling
debris during the rescue operation. Two women were still missing.
The suspect at large, described as tanned and muscular with a tattoo
on one arm, is believed to have rented the truck used for the bomb with
Timothy McVeigh, 27, the only person charged with the attack so far.
Officials said they were confident the bodies of the two missing women
would eventually be recovered when the building is demolished. The
corpses are believed buried in rubble near a column that searchers do
not dare touch for fear of triggering a collapse of that part of the
building.
''I think we will find them there, there is really no doubt in my
mind,'' said Ray Blakeney, a spokesman for the coroner's office. ''We
have done everything that can be done without endangering lives.''
In a final flurry of activity, searchers recovered 18 victims
yesterday, including three babies who were in cribs in the building's
day care nursery when the bomb exploded. They were the last children
still missing.
A total of 19 children died in the blast, the worst attack against
civilians on US soil.
Searchers planned to hold a memorial service at the building today and
another service for the families of the victims later.
The marathon search effort, which has involved hundreds of emergency
workers from across the country, finally came to an end in an emotional
moment just before midnight yesterday.
Searchers put down their tools, gathered around the building and
observed a moment of silence before a chaplain offered a
prayer.--Reuter.

THERE was a kind of elemental quality to the music played in the
second concert of the Academy Now! Festival, which featured students of
the RSAMD yesterday lunchtime in a series of works conducted by James
MacMillan.
Edward Rushton, in his prizewinning composition, Hommage a Charles W
Post, plunged in at the deep end. Literally. Favouring filthy sounds
with an almost primeval character down in the depths of an instrumental
ensemble, Rushton stirs up an intense field of acceleration, animation
and tension in his piece, which pushes to a nice, boiling and clangorous
climax. (Young Mr Rushton is, incidentally, one of two pianists
currently playing graceful piano for Opera on a Shoestring's La Traviata
at the Cottier Theatre.)
Even in Harrison Birtwistle's La Plage, an unusually static piece from
such a fiery man, there is an otherworldly feeling to the music,
seductively and sensitively controlled by singer and instrumentalists in
this quietly spellbinding performance. MacMillan's own Three Dawn
Rituals -- an earlyish piece, whose driving middle movement contains the
seeds of his future rhythmic development -- seems to take music right
outside time itself.
Arguably, Berio's classic Folk Songs, sung with a fresh, bright
quality by mezzo Emma Turnbull, wouldn't fit into the elemental
category, but the composer's tellingly-placed accompaniments -- from the
raw, rhapsodic viola of the first song to the freewheeling finale --
somehow preclude the songs from becoming what we might term
''sophisticated'' in their cast.
Throughout this festival, the quality of performance by the students
-- and their confident sense of style is at least as important as their
technical expertise -- is consistently assured. It's a pity we don't
hear them more often.

In the early days of World War Two Winston Churchill ordered a new
breed of soldier who went into battle from the sky, the Paratroopers.
The new Parachute Regiment attracted the toughest and most adventurous
soldiers from every unit in the British Army. The toughest of them all
was Lt-Col Alastair Pearson, a 27-year-old Glaswegian. James Murray
tells his story
Men froze and listened to the roar . . . then all over the battlefield
soldiers smiled in their sleep. Somebody had annoyed Mad Jock
Pearson refused to be intimidated by the deadly rockets. He ate
breakfast under the trees and sat in state reading his newspaper
One man was wounded as he approached the ground. He pulled out a
grenade and killed three Germans who were firing at him from below
IN THE silent night thousands of straining ears listened tensely for
the twig-snapping approach of death. Thousands of bloodshot eyes blinked
tearfully in the moonlit gloom, peering for unseen dangers.
It was D-Day plus one. On the Normandy battlefields two vast armies
fitfully tried to rest. Lying in the ditch and forest, field and
hedgerow, each soldier hugged his rifle protectively to his side as he
hovered drowsily between sleep and action. Death was omnipresent, and it
could come at any time, from any direction. Only the alert escaped.
Suddenly the restless silence in one sector was broken by a bellow of
rage. Men froze and listened. ''You hooligan,'' the voice roared. ''You
are not fit to clean the latrines. Call yourself a soldier. Give me a
wee lassie from Gallowgate any time.''
All over the battlefield soldiers smiled in their sleep. Somebody had
annoyed Lt-Col Alastair Pearson, the wild Scot known affectionately to
his men as ''Mad Jock''. After his legendary exploits in North Africa
and Sicily, which had won him three Distinguished Service Orders and a
Military Cross, Pearson was now in command of the 8th Battalion of the
Parachute Regiment.
He was leading a patrol on a mission on the edge of enemy territory
when his temper exploded. The soldier who had annoyed him had been
ordered into an inflatable rubber boat, bobbing on the surface of the
River Dives, which had to be crossed before the patrol could reach their
objective.
The man had jumped into the dinghy and stuck his bayonet through the
rubber bottom. The dinghy sank, carrying the man with it. After his
tongue-lashing, Pearson completed the punishment by kicking the man in
the rear, whereupon he splashed into the river again. As he emerged
dripping for the second time he spluttered: ''You can't do that, sir.
It's against the King's regulations. I'll complain to the brigadier.''
''You can complain to General Montgomery, himself,'' raged Pearson.
''For your stupidity you can stay here until we come back. I'm making
you our guide mark. If the Germans turn out to find what this row is
about, serves you right.''
The patrol finally scrambled across the river over a wrecked bridge
and made for a sleeping village some distance away. Pearson split his
men: one group to protect the rear, while he led the other party to a
farm where 12 injured airmen and paras were being sheltered.
They were met by a wizened old Frenchwoman who had been caring for the
injured men in her barn. Only a few were fit to walk. One RAF warrant
officer had a very serious head wound. As his men gave morphia
injections, Pearson tackled the problem of moving the men through enemy
lines back to safety. He pointed to a large farm cart which stood at one
of the barn.
It was a medieval-looking contraption with greet wooden wheels with
iron rims and huge shafts for a large workhorse. ''We'll take that,'' he
said, but the old woman indicated that there were no animals left on the
farm to pull the cart.
''We'll have to haul it ourselves,'' said Pearson. He pulled the
harness straps over his shoulders and ordered his men to buckle him into
the shafts. The injured men were loaded on to the cart and the strangest
ambulance of the war trundled out of the farm gates and on to the road,
pulled by a grunting Pearson and pushed by a dozen of his men.
The cart creaked and groaned noisily as the road led them through the
silent village. They were in dire danger of being surprised by a German
patrol. Pearson was even more worried about being ambushed by his own
men in the other half of the patrol he had left behind to guard the
rear. Although he trusted them completely, it was not inconceivable they
might think they were being approached by a German column in the dark.
Suddenly inspiration came to Pearson. ''All right lads,'' he cried,
''let's have a song.'' The paras straining to shove the cart were at
first mystified. But Pearson was not a man to be disobeyed. Anyway he
was already leading them in a rowdy chorus: ''Roll out the barrel, roll
out a barrel of fun. Roll out the barrel, we'll have the Hun on the run
. . .''
The trick worked. As they left the village a corporal from the rear
patrol stepped out from the darkness of a church wall to halt them.
''Thank God you let us know it was you, Colonel,'' he told Pearson. ''We
thought you were a German half-track and we were all set to knock hell
out of you.''
A few hours later the wounded men were delivered to the safety of
Pearson's headquarters, deep in the Forest of Bavent.
The story of Pearson's rescue patrol was a great morale booster along
the front lines for men who knew only too well that at any time it might
be their turn to lie injured and despairing in some lonely barn.
The paras had dropped into Normandy two days earlier with the famed
Red Devils 6th Airborne Division, 12 hours in advance of the vast armada
of seaborne forces which blasted ashore on Omaha, Gold, Juno, and Sword
beaches on the historic morning of D-Day, June 6, 1944.
Parachuting into the heart of enemy territory just after midnight on
D-Day, the paras' vital task was to capture or destroy a series of
bridges over a network of rivers and canals which led to the coast. They
were to stop the Germans rushing up reserves of tanks and troops when
the Allies hit the beaches.
Pearson's 8th Battalion was made up almost entirely of young, raw
conscripts who had never seen a shot fired in anger. The original paras
had been decimated in the North African and Sicilian campaigns, and
Pearson had driven the youngsters hard to prepare them for D-Day. ''You
young men are going to spearhead the liberation of Europe,'' he told
them. ''It is a great honour.''
When D-Day came they were ready. ''This is the only way to go into
battle,'' Pearson told them. ''You step into an aircraft and an hour
later you're in action.'' The last instruction they got before they flew
was: ''Expect chaos.''
And chaos there was. It was the first time in history that an air
invasion had been attempted on such a scale. Nearly 10,000 men in 266
aircraft and 344 gliders were launched at the enemy in the darkness
before the dawn of D-Day. Everything they needed had to be dropped with
them -- from light artillery to medical supplies; ammunition to motor
bikes; food to mortar and machine guns.
Inevitably there were accidents. Aircraft crashed; gliders fell into
rivers; many men landed miles from their objectives. Those who reached
the drop zones faced terrifying hazards. Lifeless bodies swung from
trees on their parachute lines, shot by German troops as they fell.
Others dropped in swamps and rivers and drowned. Many were taken
prisoner the moment they hit the ground.
But the paras hit back, too. One man was wounded as he approached the
ground: he pulled out a grenade and killed three Germans who were firing
at him from below. Corporal Albert Price, from Birmingham, landed on top
of a low building and broke his ankle. As he climbed painfully over the
roof he heard German voices. Peering in an attic window he saw a
conference of German staff officers and lobbed a grenade into the group.
They died instantly.
A certain Sergeant Jones snatched a sub-machine gun from one of his
German captors and killed eight of them before escaping. Another para
was knocked out when he fell and woke to find a beautiful French girl
bending over him. She put him on the back of her tandem bike and rode
him to his unit.
All over the battlefield the paras fought their way to their
rendezvous and gathered to attack their targets. A fierce battle raged
at the bridge over the Caen Canal, later to be immortalised as the
Pegasus Bridge. A heroic struggle was being fought to silence a huge gun
battery at Merville, which menaced the Allied landing beaches.
Pearson's battalion dropped over a wide farmland area west of the town
of Troarn, a few miles from Caen, 12 miles inland and the deepest
penetration of all. Pearson was shot in the hand as he landed by one of
his own men, whose sten gun went off accidentally. It was nearly 24
hours before he got around to finding a medic to extract the bullet.
His orders were to blow up three bridges over the River Dives at
Troarn and another village caled Bures. Afterwards he was to hide his
men in the Forest of Bavent, from which he would harass the enemy and
sabotage road movements. There were thousands of German troops in the
area. Of 600 men in Pearson's 8th battalion, he found only 180 of them.
He split the party into two groups and sent one to deal with the bridge
at Troarn, while he led the other to the bridges at Bures. In the
meantime, another squad of paras with explosives had recovered a
parachuted Jeep and were speeding towards Troarn.
There were eight men hanging on to the Jeep, driven by Major J C A
Roseveare, all armed to the teeth. Troarn was the headquarters of the
German 21st Panzer Division and it was thick with troops. The bridge was
at the other side of town.
Major Roseveare put his foot down on the accelerator and screeched
along the main street, all guns blazing. The Jeep emerged on the other
side of town and plunged down a steep hill to the bridge, with a hail of
machine-gun bullets whistling round the paras' ears.
A squad of Germans guarding the bridge evaporated at the sight of the
furious Jeep, thundering towards them. Brakes smoking, the Jeep pulled
up, the paras leapt out, placed their explosives, blew a 20ft gap in the
bridge and were on their way again within minutes.
The Germans were still reeling under the impression that they were
being attacked by a regiment when another squad of paras, led by Lt
Colin Brown from Edinburgh, arrived at the bridge on foot and blew an
even larger hole in it.
At Bures, Pearson's group was enjoying incredible success. His men
crossed country without meeting any Germans, blew their bridges, and
retired to the woods as if they had just completed a training exercise.
By dawn on D-Day Pearson's strength had risen to 250 men and he
proceeded to establish a base from which he sent out swift punches which
left the Germans bewildered, like a lumbering heavyweight baffled by a
dancing bantam.
Using classic tactics, the paras slept during the day and left the
forest at night, dark-faced and deadly, to strike at the enemy where he
least expected it. Their impudence became so daring that many of them
were able to pay social calls in Troarn at night, where they were
entertained by the jubilant French citizens under the noses of the
Germans.
On more serious business, they roamed the streets, shooting up German
patrols, hurling grenades through barrack windows and creating alarm and
despondency in the enemy ranks. Pearson led strong patrols blowing
craters in roads and knocking out German communication centres.
The Germans constantly tried to root out the paras from the forest.
Once they sent in a column of tanks, armoured cars, and troop-carrying
trucks. Pearson's men ambushed them and destroyed the lot. Like a great,
defiant stag, Pearson defied the Germans to invade his territory. Every
day the forest was blasted by German field guns, mortars, and a new,
frightening weapon called a Nebelwerfer -- a deadly rocket which
shrieked as it crashed through the trees into the paras' base.
Pearson refused to be intimidated. In the early summer sunshine he
insisted on eating breakfast each day under the trees, served by his
batman, and sat in state reading his army newspaper with a cloud of
mosquitoes round his head.
Later in the morning men were brought before him on breaches of
discipline frequently ducking as officers rapped out their evidence of
minor misdeeds while the ground trembled under the German barrage. The
men quickly learned that it was safer to behave themselves than to risk
running the gauntlet of Pearson's dangerous court.
One morning before dawn Pearson alerted his troops. ''I think the
Germans will attack in strength this morning,'' he said. ''I feel it in
my bones.''
The German attack came at first light. They pounded the paras'
trenches and then sent a horde of troops yelling across the fields into
the forest. Pearson was everywhere at once. He roamed the trenches
dodging explosions and urging his men to hold their ground. But the
overwhelming German force began to win the day. Gaps appeared in the
paras' company lines and they were in danger of being overrun.
The Germans were being supported by huge, self-propelled guns, which
fired 17-pounder shells. Pearson gathered a platoon of men. ''Follow
me,'' he commanded. They leapt forward at the enemy, Pearson leading
with his sten gun blasting a path in front of him. They charged one of
the guns, annihilated the crew, and took it over; then they turned it on
the Germans. At point-blank range they sent a stream of shells tearing
through the close ranks of the German infantry and silenced the
17-pounders.
In a few minutes the tide of battle completely turned. Bloodied and
terrified, the Germans ran. The paras held out for another week, defying
every German assault to destroy them. Slowly but surely the Allied
armies fought their way off the beaches until they linked up with the
paras.
Pearson's 8th battalion was finally joined by units from the 51st
Highland division and the German counter-attacks grew weaker. The front
became static and the two armies faced each other across a battered
strip of no-man's-land. For two months the Germans grimly held back the
straining Allied armies. For the paras the war became a deadly game of
quick raids behind enemy lines by opportunist patrols.
The weeks of waiting ended on August 17. So many men and weapons had
flowed across the English Channel that the allied Armies either had to
burst out or choke the ports. They burst out. In a nine-day romp they
sent the Germans staggering back to the River Seine and liberated 400
square miles of France. The tireless paras were in every advance,
leap-frogging across canals and rivers with Monty's infantry units.
The paras fought for crossroads, railway bridges, and from house to
house in towns and villages which the Germans had set on fire. They
tackled tanks; they cleaned out snipers' nests; and Pearson was always
up front like some heroic knight from the Crusades.
He was awarded a fourth DSO which, along with his MC, was an
incredible medal count for one man, and made him one of the most
decorated officers in history. The citation for his fourth DSO said:
''By his brilliant handling of the battalion during the first week of
the operation he was able to hold off a superior enemy from the vital
high ground at the south end of the Bois de Bavent.'' It listed the
battles in which his personal bravery had inspired his men . . . Bures
and Troarn . . . Roucheville . . . Le Mesnil. All names which live in
the history of Normandy.
At the end of August the exhausted paras were withdrawn to Britain for
a short rest before they resumed training for their next big assignment
at Arnhem. But for Pearson the fighting was over. After four years of
superhuman effort his health broke. He was not yet 30 but he was wracked
with malaria and spent weeks in hospital recovering his strength. He
would suffer from asthma for the rest of his life.
He spent the rest of the war training paratroopers in Britain. But the
day he returned to England from Normandy he had some personal unfinished
business to complete. He was met by fellow officers who put him on a
train immediately and took him to Marden in Wiltshire. Earlier in the
year Pearson had somehow found time to woo and win a young war widow,
Joan Morgan Weld-Smith, whose husband, a wing-commander in the RAF, had
been killed.
Joan had set the wedding for June 8 and Pearson, sworn to keep the
date of D-Day a secret, had been unable to tell her that he would not be
able to keep the date. They were finally married on September 9, 1944.
At night, a piper in full Highland dress marched up and down the village
street playing Pearson's favourite tunes.
Pearson bought a farm on the shores of Loch Lomond where he and Joan
raised three daughters and a herd of dairy cows. Now 80, he lives there
to this day.
More honours were heaped on him after the war and he became a
brigadier in the TA. He was Lord Lieutenant of Dunbartonshire, an ADC to
the Queen, Keeper of Dumbarton Castle, and an honorary sheriff of
Dumbarton.
For many years he went back to Normandy for the paratroopers' reunion
at Pegasus Bridge, and to lecture young officers on his unorthodox
battle tactics.
At one regimental reunion after the war, when the top brass were being
dined in the officers' mess at Aldershot, someone called on Pearson to
respond to the toast. It was a little late in the evening and many
toasts had already been drunk.
Pearson rose a little unsteadily to make his speech. ''As you may
know,'' he began, ''I commanded the 1st Battalion in North Africa.'' He
got no further. The young officers rushed the top table, raised him on
to their shoulders and carried him round the room until the party was
reduced to a shambles.
A group of subalterns formed a pyramid and the man at the top wrote
Pearson's name on the ceiling. It is there to this day.

THE notion that poetry readings are dull, indulgent affairs is one
that has remained with me since my university days. On Wednesday evening
however, in a hot and sticky CCA studio, I had my unhappy memories
dissed by London's Urban Poets Society.
This was no behind-a-lectern gig. Instead, a good-sized, youngish
audience was treated to a spectacular barrage of recited verse and
improvisation in freestyle stylee. It was not poetry in the Scottish
tradition you understand, it's a black thing, a black voice, the black
urban perspective, but one which speaks to us all.
These guys perform their work, they use the space, it was in yer face.
Cosmic/urban, holocaustic nightmares stood side by side with mellow,
meltdown verses as poets Roger Robinson, Akure Wall, Jonzi D and Madd
Mallissa, accompanied by bassist Owen Uwardie, took us on an odyssey of
love, high-rise living, cricket and cultural imperialism. Most of it was
spoken, some of it half-sung, while taped music and lights heightened
the drama.
Everyone who was there will remember the way the beautiful Akure Wall
won us over with her moving account of a return ''home'' to Nigeria,
with its ''poverty children with millionaire smiles''. Her dismay at the
antics of her fellow, but native, women revealed that Western culture
has much to answer for. She found them at once beautiful and natural,
but her politically correct Western conditioning was at odds with this
view. The piece had a wholly mesmeric quality.
Haunting, illuminating and thought-provoking stuff, with respect paid
to contemporary icons like Miles Davis, George Clinton, and those of the
Mothership Connection. But respect is due to Urban Poets Society. Thank
you, and haste ye back.

Grozny, Friday
SEPARATIST rebels in Chechnya today shot down a Russian plane and
denied allegations they were planning major attacks to coincide with
Victory in Europe celebrations next week.
A statement from the Chechen general staff, read out over the
telephone, said rebels would keep fighting to a minimum when around 50
world leaders attended ceremonies in Moscow to mark the anniversary.
''The general staff states officially that no special combat
operations have been planned or are being planned . . . for May 9,''
said the statement, read out by chief Chechen spokesman Movladi Udugov
from the rebellious region.
''Chechen armed forces understand perfectly well the importance of the
victory over fascism for the world community. Out of humanitarian
considerations, the general staff has ordered its forces to cut military
activities to a minimum.''
The Chechen document accused Russian troops of violating a unilateral
moratorium which the Kremlin had declared until May 12 and said
''wide-scale'' combat was continuing in Chechnya.
A senior Russian commander told Interfax news agency that Kremlin
troops were themselves planning ''many surprises'' for the rebels, who
have infiltrated the shattered capital Grozny since it fell in February.
Rebels shot down a Russian plane today near the eastern village of
Serzhen-Yurt while it was on a reconnaisance flight, Itar-Tass news
agency quoted military sources as saying.
Udugov confirmed a plane had been downed and said the pilot, who was
carrying two sets of documents with his picture but with different
names, was killed.
Russian helicopter gunships raided the rebel-held village of Bamut in
western Chechnya today and artillery pounded it during the night,
witnesses said.
Russia's military command in the Chechen capital Grozny declined
comment on the reports.--Reuter.

Dakar, Friday
AN Africa-American ''roots'' summit ended today with a call for black
Americans to take a stake in their ancestral home by applying for dual
citizenship in an African country.
''We want to involve people at a people-to-people level,'' summit
organiser the Rev Leon Sullivan told a closing news conference. ''This
is a new mobilisation effort. It has never been done in America
before.''
Sullivan, an American preacher and campaigner for black rights who
says he also holds citizenship in Gabon, Gambia and Ivory Coast, said he
wanted African Americans to own land in Africa, put money in African
banks and make their skills available to the world's poorest continent.
''We are initiating out of this summit a dual citizenship movement
whereby countries are asked to welcome us as dual citizens,'' he said.
''This is not a return to Africa movement but it is a return of African
Americans to come back to help Africa as dual citizens.''
''In time, it is my dream that millions of African Americans will
become dual citizens of African countries so that they can have a tie to
their homeland,'' said Sullivan, a longtime member of the board of
directors of General Motors and author of guidelines for treatment of
South African workers by US companies doing business there before
apartheid was scrapped.
''The question of dual nationality, as far as blacks in America, are
concerned is new. I have known of my friends who have had dual
citizenshsips from England and France and Israel and every part of the
world for years and years,'' he said.--Reuter.

AN EVENING of dinner and the theatre takes on a whole new meaning when
The Red Road Young 'Uns entertain their local Springburn community.
Dinner comes during the interval in Mississippi Fried Chicken boxes with
baked potatoes and coleslaw. And though the packed centre doesn't have a
bar, the guys on the door will happily pop out for your carry-out. Last
night the Mayfest spirit escaped from the big budget venues and
intoxicated each member of the audience who had arrived to see the show.
Even when the suspended scenery of storm clouds and love hearts
crashed to the floor during the first act's final number, we all just
smiled. On with the show and all that, though The Red Road Young 'Uns In
Love -- old age pensioners, or recyled teenagers as they wish to be
known -- could have had a heart attack. But through renditions of Love &amp;
Marriage and I Just Called To Say I Love You they displayed their
sterner stuff.
Tonight, and for their following four dates, they were joined by The
Red Road Kids, a slick and energetic band of pre-teens who sang and
danced to When I'm 64, among others. They crashed on stage to The
Beatles' She Loves Me, the boys strumming cut-out guitars and looking
like Lemmy from Motorhead while straining to reach the mike.
Mothers clapped, fathers roared, while the slightly tipsy in a
sing-a-long mood were shushed into silence. Mayfest was at the Red Road
and on the right track.

Bonn, Saturday
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl told Germans today that only respect for human
rights and the law could stop the horrors of the Second World War
recurring in their children's and grandchildren's lifetime.
''This is the decisive lesson from the experiences of the 20th century
as it draws to a close,'' he said in a statement to mark the 50th
anniversary of the surrender of Nazi Germany on May 8 1945.
''There can be no doubt that the liberation from Hitler's barbarity
was necessary to allow Germany to become a free state pledged to the
rule of law, and to allow peace and reconciliation between the peoples
of Europe,'' he said.
Kohl steered carefully around rightwing claims that not enough
attention was being paid to the suffering of millions of Germans in the
war by saying each and every memory of hardship should be respected.
''Anyone who has not come through the hell of the concentration camps
will never be able to feel what still moves the survivors of the horror
in their deepest being,'' he said.
''Anyone who did not have to live through the suffering and death on
the battlefields can have only a vague notion of the nightmares that
today still haunt the soldiers who returned.
''Anyone who was lucky enough not to lose his or her homeland cannot
really understand the still-present sorrow of those who were driven from
the land of their childhood and ancestors.''
He also noted that, for eastern Germany at least, liberation had been
swiftly followed by a new bondage under a communist dictatorship which
was to last more than four decades.
But he said today's Germans still had cause to be grateful.
''On May 8, 1945, no-one in Germany would have dreamt that we stood at
the beginning of the longest period of peace in recent German history
and that, at the end of this century, our country would be respected and
liked worldwide.''--Reuter.

LAST night's concert by the SCO should have witnessed the premiere of
Maxwell-Davies's tenth Strathclyde Concerto. Unfortunately, the work has
been put on hold until next autumn but there was still much to celebrate
in the replacement programme, conducted by Maxwell-Davies himself.
Although not a premiere, we heard the first public performance of
Max's Carolisima, composed last year at the request of the Danish consul
in Edinburgh, in honour of his wife's fiftieth birthday. A quirky little
piece, full of Max idiosyncrasies such as shifting tonalities, delicate
folk tunes, and bold brass writing, this music is instantly
communicative.
Traces of Wagner's Siegfried Idyll and Schoenberg's Pierrot Lunaire
are easily recognisable in the central Adagio, yet somehow appear fresh
rather than derivative. The Rondo-Finale transforms a formerly evocative
serenade into a lively party through buoyant dance rhythms. An
unexpected return to the eloquent Adagio brings this pretty miniature to
a blissful close.
Max's Sinfonietta Academia creates a very different atmosphere.
Inspired by a visit to the ruined church of Hoy in his adopted Orcadian
home, Max paints a musical portrait of the lives of the many islanders
who are buried in the ancient churchyard. An instantly evocative score,
rich in orchestral texture, the SCO brought every detail to life.
In recent years, Max has fashioned some wonderfully innovative use of
the timpani in his output. It was particularly apt then that the
symphony chosen was Haydn's Drum Roll, named after the opening tremor of
this brilliant piece. Under Max's light touch, the SCO produced a fresh
and exuberant interpretation, as was the case in the opening Mozart's
Sinfonietta Academia.

IN the words of the Duke of Wellington after Waterloo, it was ''a
damned close-run thing''. Yet the effective end of the war in Europe
came with more of a whimper than a bang, on the windswept approaches to
the Baltic port of Wismar.
A handful of paratroopers from the British Sixth Airborne Division
were dug-in along the road beyond the town. They were men who had fought
in Normandy, through the bloody shambles of the Ardennes, and taken part
in the immense parachute drop that preceded the crossing of the Rhine,
the Reich's final natural barrier. Some of its battalions had sustained
up to 40% casualties.
This particular group had just advanced 60 miles in eight hours,
clinging to the sides of light tanks as they barrelled through the
broken remnants of a German army that had lost the will to fight on.
The road was strewn with burning vehicles, discarded equipment, dead
horses and men. It was graphic testimony to the fury with which
marauding British Typhoon fighter-bombers continued to harry the
retreating Wehrmacht in its last hours.
Bill Mackintosh, originally from Glasgow but now living in Canada,
recalls: ''Suddenly a small convoy of motorcycles and armoured personnel
carriers appeared from the east, moving cautiously towards us. As our
fingers tightened on triggers, somebody luckily identified their
occupants as Russians.
''The advance scouting party of Marshal Rokossovsky's 2nd Byelorussian
Front had arrived -- just seven ragged soldiers and a female commissar
with a tommy-gun. With relief on both sides, greetings and vodka were
exchanged instead of gunfire.''
Then the Russians turned as one, drove back the way they had come, and
began to set up a roadblock. Although few of the participants realised
it at the time, the Iron Curtain predicted by Churchill had just begun
its first, unspectacular descent across Europe.
For the Paras had won a strategic race by a mere half-hour. Wismar
held the key to the Baltic. It was also the gateway to Denmark and the
rest of Scandinavia. If the Soviets had arrived first, the history of
the next five decades might have been irretrievably different.
At the same time, the Seventh Armoured Division, the famed Desert Rats
of Montgomery's Eighth Army, were pushing through the streets of Hamburg
to the west to secure the Baltic's other major port.
It was led by the only two tanks of the unit's original complement of
more than 150 which had survived the campaign since landing on
Normandy's beaches in June of the previous year. All of the others had
been knocked out in action and replaced. At least half of their crews
were dead or wounded.
Sam McCormick, then a sergeant, from Uddingston, remembers: ''We'd
been through heavy fighting in North Africa and all the way from
Normandy. But Hamburg was a mess. It was a mass of charred rubble from
bombing, and the heart had gone out of the enemy.
''Then it was all over, just like that, with hardly a shot fired at
the end. After all we'd been through, there was a mixture of emotions.
There was relief that we were still alive, but there was disappointment
too, in a funny sort of a way. Being at war had become a way of life. It
was hard to believe it was finished.''
General Sir Brian Horrocks, the popular, veteran commander of Monty's
XXX Corps, heard the news that the war in Europe was over in
embarrassing circumstances. He was seated on the military equivalent of
the smallest room in the house -- a field latrine -- when a voice on the
radio announced that all hostilities would cease ''at 0800 hours
tomorrow morning, May 5''.
Others were sceptical. Horrocks also overheard the commander of one of
his infantry divisions rebuking a staff officer with the words: ''I take
my orders from the corps commander, not from the BBC.''
But not everyone was on the spot at the time. However, everyone tends
to remember where he or she was when the ceasefire was declared.
One such Kirkintilloch man, a paratrooper and a survivor of Arnhem,
the gallant but disastrous attempt to shorten the war by seizing a key
bridge over the Rhine eight months before, tells his story. He was
preparing his kit to fly out to Norway with the rest of British 1st
Airborne Division when the news came through.
''We eventually flew out to supervise the surrender of German forces
in Norway. We were known as the British Army of Liberation, the BLA. But
with the war against Japan still on the go, that quickly got converted
by some wag to Burma Looms Ahead. In the event, we were sent to
Palestine instead.''
Able-Seaman Jockie Mosson, a Glaswegian who had seen action in the
Mediterranean and off the D-Day beaches, had just received orders for a
new posting to what he describes as ''a rustbucket of a ship'' berthed
on Scotland's North-east coast.
''I'd already lost my elder brother in Italy, and I'd seen more
fighting than I cared to remember. I used the travel warrant to get me
back to Glasgow as soon as possible. I went home to see my mother and
decided to face the music later,'' he said.
''It turned out nobody was particularly bothered. It was technically
desertion, even if it was only a temporary absence.
Thousands of servicemen all over the country were doing the same. I
think everybody thought that if they now had to prepare for war against
Japan, they were going back to their nearest and dearest first.''

ALMOST 9000 jobs could be created in Scotland if the Government would
agree to lowering the rate of VAT on tourism services, particularly
accommodation, from 17.5% to 8%, the chairman of the Scottish Tourist
Board (STB), Mr Ian Grant, claimed yesterday.
He was speaking after the first board meeting in the STB's new
Inverness headquarters. He said that the UK's tourism industry was
burdened with the highest VAT rate on accommodation in Europe, with the
sole exception of Denmark.
A report for the British Tourist Authority (BTA) by Touche Ross
Management Consultants had argued that substantial economic benefits
would be produced within four years of a VAT cut.
According to Mr Grant it would create 87,000 new jobs in the UK and
8700 in Scotland; and tourism expenditure would increase by #4000m in
the UK and #400m north of the Border. Even if the reduction in VAT was
applied to accommodation alone it would mean 38,000 jobs in the UK, 3800
in Scotland.
Mr Grant pointed to the comparatively low levels of VAT charged on
accommodation in the rest of Europe: Belgium 6%; Spain 6%; Portugal 5%;
Greece 8%; Luxembourg 3%; and Denmark at 25% was now reviewing its
position. It was because of these figures that the STB was throwing its
weight into the BTA's campaign to reduce VAT.
Mr Grant said: ''If we don't try we won't get anything.
''I would like to think that this is a serious and determined effort
to rid this industry of an uncompetitive and unfair advantage that the
rest of Europe has.
''We keep speaking of a free Europe, a united Europe, everything on a
par, but here is a clear disadvantage that the British industry suffers
and I maintain the farther north you move, the greater the disadvantage
is. I would hope we would get a sympathetic hearing.''
Mr Grant said that the prospects for this season were good,
particularly in the Highlands and Islands in areas like Skye and the
Western Isles. Inquiries about holidays in the Outer Isles had risen by
300% and 30% in Skye.
But Mr Grant appealed for increased private sector investment in
visitor and activity centres to try to increase the number of people
coming north out of season.
He said: ''There are already many fine examples of quality visitor
attractions in the north which cover a wide spectrum of natural,
historical, and industrial themes.
''The Highlands may be synonymous with whisky and picture-postcard
castles, but our museums and heritage attractions; marine and historical
centres; community, commercial and industrial tourism initiatives all
play an integral part in creating the quality visitor experience.''

Kigali, Friday
BRITAIN is to open an embassy in Rwanda, breaking a pattern of cutting
down its diplomatic presence in Africa.
Lillian Wong, the senior British official in Kigali, said the decision
was announced to the Rwandan government this week but it would be
several months before the embassy opened.
Britain has emerged as one of the strongest allies of the government
that took power last July after the defeat of the former Hutu-led
government by the mainly Tutsi rebel army called the Rwanda Patriotic
Front (RPF).--Reuter.

* Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed al-Sahaf will visit New York next
week before a May 12 Security Council review of Gulf War sanctions
against Baghdad, a spokesman at Iraq's UN mission said today.
Council sources expect no change in the sanctions imposed shortly
after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990. The measures include a ban on
Iraqi oil sales.
Al-Sahaf has come to the United Nations on several previous occasions,
but Iraq has usually dispatched deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz before
sanctions reviews, which the council conducts every 60 days.--Reuter.

THE chairman of the Scottish prison union is to seek a ballot of its
4600 members for industrial action over what he claims is the blatant
disregard by Scottish Prison Service chiefs for the agreed dispute
procedure in a staffing row at Shotts Prison.
Mr Edward Hunter, chairman of the Scottish Prison Officers'
Association, told The Herald yesterday that prisons management had
ridden roughshod over the local union branch at Shotts Prison by
imposing a disputed shift system on staff at the new National Induction
Unit.
The first three prisoners were moved into the unit yesterday to help
with landscaping and preparatory work. Eventually the innovative
facility will hold up to 50 men, all starting lengthy sentences, with
the aim of helping them into the prison mainstream.
Because of the special nature of the work, prisons management want
officers to begin shifts later in the day and operate different
patterns. The local union branch is unhappy about the changes.
''They are opening this unit without any negotiated agreement between
ourselves and management,'' Mr Hunter said, ''and in blatant disregard
for the agreed disputes procedure. This is the only vehicle left to us
to hammer out grievances but they are simply saying to us: 'You are
powerless so we will do whatever we see fit'.''
SPS spokesman Mr John Gerrie said that the local branch of the SPOA
had raised a number of concerns about the ''staffing attendance system''
which the governor-in-charge at the new unit, Mrs Sue Brookes, hoped to
resolve quickly to the benefit of both prisoners and staff.

Moscow, Friday
A TOP Russian ecologist today accused Iran of planning to develop a
military nuclear programme and said Moscow had promised to sell Tehran a
key component -- a sophisticated gas centrifuge system.
Alexei Yablokov, who heads an ecology commission for President Boris
Yeltsin's powerful Security Council, told a Moscow radio station that
under a deal agreed between Russia and Iran the centrifuges should be
passed to Tehran in six months.
The United States has said that a centrifuge formed part of a
Russian-Iranian agreement to sell nuclear reactors to Iran and help it
to finish building a nuclear power station.
But Dmitry Ryurikov, Yeltsin's top foreign policy adviser, and Russian
Atomic Energy Ministry spokesman Georgy Kaurov both denied that any
centrifuge sale was on the cards.
Yablokov said that under the deal Russia agreed to provide tuition for
20 Iranian nuclear experts every year.
''Why does Iran need so many experts for one single power station?,''
he asked.
''All this raises a number of questions which have only one answer:
Iran wants to develop the military atom,'' he said.

Buenos Aires, Friday
AN Argentine bishop said today he had forbidden priests in his diocese
to give holy communion to leaders of the military's ''dirty war''
campaign of kidnapping, torture and murder in the late 1970s.
The bishop of the southern city of Viedma said ''dirty war'' leaders
could not take the sacraments of bread and wine because, unlike current
military leaders who have repented on behalf of their forces, the old
guard has not sought forgiveness.
''I have prohibited communion in my diocese for the jailed and
pardoned commanders because to violate a person is to violate God
himself,'' said Monsignor Miguel Hesayne.
Army chief General Martin Balza offered a historic mea culpa last week
for the systematic repression of the 1976-83 military regime when 10,000
were killed and at least 10,000 more ''disappeared.'' Balza himself was
not involved.
The present-day navy and air force -- and with reservations the
guerrillas they fought -- have followed suit, but former leaders still
say there is no need to apologise.
President Carlos Menem in 1990 pardoned all ''dirty war'' chiefs,
tried and jailed in the 1980s, but many do not forgive them for their
crimes.
''There are certain sectors who will never forgive the armed forces
for Argentina having been the only country in history to win a war on
subversion,'' said General Jorge Arguindeguy, army chief during the
first years of democracy's return.
The bishop of Viedma and other church leaders want the Roman Catholic
Church to beg forgiveness for its own complicity during the military
rule.-Reuter.

WE pass them by without a thought and might scarcely believe the tales
they have to tell -- real-life dramas of epic proportion which turned
ordinary young men into the victims of extraordinary happenings. On this
50th anniversary weekend of Victory in Europe, those tales are spilling
out, as proof of what the human spirit can produce when faced with the
horrors of a global war.
Take Robert Fergus Smith from the one-time village of East Kilbride,
for example, a promising young footballer and golfer of the 1930s,
looking forward to a career in sport but realising that all ambition
would have to be shelved until the threat of Nazi Germany was sorted
out.
Off went Fergie Smith to war in 1939, a Royal Engineer laying mines in
France when he was captured by the Germans at Boulogne and marched the
300 miles to Luxembourg. From there it was destination Poland, conveyed
in cattle trucks which raised a shiver only later when it was realised
that they were the same containers which would carry Jews to the
finality of their cremation.
That destination near Danzig was also close by the horrifying
concentration camp of Treblinka. ''I saw Jews working until they
dropped,'' Fergie recalls. ''Then they were either shot or taken off to
the gas chambers.''
The worst of his own ordeals, however, were reserved for those final
weeks leading up to the surrender which was taken by Montgomery on
Luneberg Heath this May weekend of 50 years ago.
''As the Russians closed in, the Germans marched us off from Poland,
back into Germany -- a nightmare which took us nine weeks to cover 1000
miles, eating nothing but raw turnips,'' says Fergie Smith. ''I had been
a man of 10st 8lb. By the time that march was over I was down to 6st.''
Weak and exhausted and ill though he was, he can still count his
blessings in the context of what happened to a friend from East
Kilbride. Jim Clarkin had been at school with Fergie before joining the
Black Watch. At least there was a touch of home for the two lads as they
met up in the prisoner-of-war camp in Poland.
Now, with the Second World War running into its final days, they were
at last on the march towards Luneberg Heath and, hopefully before long,
the safety of East Kilbride. On that harrowing march of 1000 miles,
Fergie Smith was plodding along at a distance of 30 yards behind Jim
Clarkin. Suddenly a German vehicle came thundering up from behind. As it
overtook Fergie, he realised that a fanatical Nazi on board was cocking
his gun for action.
Of all the horrors he had seen in the past five years, nothing
surpassed what happened next. This gun-crazed Nazi began shooting those
exhausted British troops. And among those who now lay dead was Jim
Clarkin from East Kilbride.
Devastated by this ultimate atrocity, Fergie Smith used what strength
was left to bury his comrade from that Scottish village which was then a
community of only 1500 people.
Onward with heavy hearts, those surviving soldiers, liberated by the
Americans on May 2, finally reached Luneberg, which was about to take
its own special place in the history of the Second World War. Fergie
Smith was there as Montgomery arrived for that historic moment: ''He
came across to speak to us. 'You will be happy to know, boys, that I am
about to go in to sign the peace pact.' And off he went.''
From Germany, Fergie Smith was flown home to a hospital in Essex, in
time to see a nurse coming apprehensively in his direction. ''I'm afraid
I have bad news for you,'' she said. ''Your father is dead.''
Fergie Smith controlled his grief and considered the irony of the
moment. After five years as a prisoner-of-war -- and just before that
emotional reunion in East Kilbride -- his father had died on the very
day of his son's liberation. Fergie arrived home four days after the
funeral.
But his ordeals were not yet over. With the War Office taking some
time to sort out the mayhem of those final days in Germany, there was a
knock on the door of the Smith home. ''It was Mrs Clarkin, wanting to
know when her son would be home. I had to tell her that Jim would not be
coming back.''
This story of Fergie Smith is not untypical of the burdens which had
to be borne by the young of that wartime generation. Miraculously, it
seems, they were sustained by the nobility of the human spirit.
With the horrors of a world war behind him, Fergie settled to a career
with the electronics firm of Philips at Hamilton. At the age of 77, he
plays golf to a handicap of 10, still living in his native East
Kilbride, though now in the Calderwood district of what became
Scotland's first New Town of post-war development.
Indifferent health has dogged his advancing years but, like many
another veteran, he reflects on the good fortune of still being alive to
tell the tale. It is a tale he can relate, with pride, to respectful
grandchildren who will have every cause this weekend to thank him -- and
millions more -- for at least securing the freedom we know today.
It could have been a very different story.

THE decision by the Cabinet to go ahead with the merger of Scottish
Nuclear and its English counterpart came as a further body-blow to the
Tory by-election campaign in Perth and Kinross yesterday.
Candidate John Godfrey, struggling to hold the marginal seat, is
believed to have hoped that if the Government was going to proceed with
a move which is deeply unpopular in Scotland, it might postpone the
decision until after the poll on May 25.
His discomfort on the issue was highlighted during an at times
ill-tempered grilling by the media, as he refused four times to answer
whether or not he personally favoured the retention of Scottish Nuclear
as an operation in its own right.
He said each time that he was ''in favour of the best deal that can be
obtained'' for the nuclear industry for its workforce and management.
There was a similar sticking to the party line by Labour, where
candidate Douglas Alexander rebuffed several attempts to draw him into a
commitment by a future Labour government to take the nuclear industry
back into public hands.
He was supported by Shadow Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who said:
''If I was a private investor I would be thinking long and hard about
investing in something as contentious as that.''
Liberal Democrat candidate Veronica Linklater said she supported
bringing Scottish Nuclear back into public ownership and said it was
outrageous to syphon off a Scottish company that had been a roaring
success.
Campaign manager Archy Kirkwood MP said: ''This is the fag-end of a
Government that has run out of ideas and has no mandate. This sort of
thing rubs people's noses in it and is completely offensive.''
SNP candidate Roseanna Cunningham said the nuclear industry should
remain in public hands while it was run down over a lengthy period and
replaced by sustainable energy sources.

Our musical correspondents consider the entertainments currently
available
Shostakovich: Symphony No 7, The Leningrad, Jarvi/RSNO (Chandos)
* SHOSTAKOVICH'S colossal Leningrad Symphony remains the most potent
symbol of wartime Russia, with its graphic portrayal of the inexorable
march of fascism and the resistance and eventual triumph of the spirit.
As the Nazis settled into their 17-month siege of Leningrad in 1941,
Shostakovich began composition of the symphony. By the time he was
evacuated to the temporary capital, Kuibyshev, three of the four
movements were finished. The first performance of the completed symphony
took place there in March 1942. Within the month it was being played in
Moscow.
By June the score -- on 900 slides of microfilm -- had reached London,
where it was performed by Sir Henry Wood and the London Symphony
Orchestra on the first anniversary of the invasion of the Soviet Union.
Six weeks later, the symphony received its US premiere at Tanglewood.
The day before that American premiere, the first -- and the most
extraordinary -- performance of the symphony in Leningrad itself had
taken place. The Leningrad Phil had been evacuated to Novosibirsk. The
only musical resources in the besieged city, for a symphony that
requires an immensely augmented orchestra, were 14 players of the radio
orchestra.
The Soviet authorities pulled out the stops, recruiting retired
musicians, releasing soldier-musicians from siege duty, and laying on
extra rations literally to feed up the exhausted and starving conductor
and orchestra so they would be fit for tackling the 70-minute epic.
The performance, on August 13, 1942, during the siege, has passed into
legend, and was at once an emotional catharsis and a powerful political
symbol. The playwright Alexander Kron, present at that performance,
wrote: ''People who no longer knew how to shed tears of sorrow and
misery now cried from sheer joy.''
Of the available recordings, for sheer graphic depiction and ferocious
intensity, few can match the incandescent performance by Neeme Jarvi and
the Royal SNO.
The Music of Terezin (BBC2, Monday, 12.40pm)
* THE flowering of creativity under extreme conditions is not unique
-- Messiaen wrote his transcendent Quartet for the End of Time in a
prisoner of war camp. But the story of the Terezin operas is among the
most striking. Terezin, a transit camp for Jews -- many en route to
Auschwitz -- was close to Prague, and full of musicians, actors, singers
and composers. In appalling conditions, operas were produced. The
documentary on BBC2 tells the story of Terezin, followed at 1.50 by a
film of Mecklenburgh Opera's production of Hans Krasa's Brundibar,
written in the camp. Mecklenburgh Opera -- who are at Edinburgh's
Festival Theatre on Friday -- bring Brundibar and another Terezin opera,
Viktor Ullman's The Emperor of Atlantis, to Stirling's MacRobert Arts
Centre in October
MICHAEL TUMELTY
Convoy 1945 Volume One, Sam Donahue directing The Band of the US Navy
Liberation Forces (Hep)
* LESS an exercise in nostalgia than a lesson in the timelessness of a
roaring, swinging, disciplined big band, these tracks, recorded in the
final months of the Second World War, are brimful of great musicianship,
fearless soloing, and meticulous arranging. Between two different takes
of Donahue's marauding, ebullient Convoy come originals and big band
staples of every hue, including Just You Just Me, C Jam Blues, and Benny
Carter's Lonesome Nights featuring Donahue's lovely Lester Young-styled
tenor saxophone.
There's Something In The Air, The Squadronaires (Hep)
* DESPITE inexplicably omitting the ''It's OK, chaps, it's one of
ours'' subtitle, this 26-track, mid-1940s selection does have its
magical moments, such as featured trombonist George Chisholm's crisp
arrangement of Runnin' Wild, among some more hammy ploys (a Cherokee
intro that's straight out of Tom Mix) and bandleader Jimmy Miller's
smooth crooning with its occasional lapses into near-slapstick.
Unmistakably of its time, but faultlessly played and still enjoyable big
band music. (In case of difficulty, write to Hep Records, PO BOX 50,
Edinburgh.)
ROB ADAMS
40s Kings of Swing (Double Play)
* NOSTALGIA on a pension (sorry, shoestring). This is a low-budget,
slightly eclectic, compilation of 24 tracks from groups led by five of
the bandleaders of the 1940s: Woody Herman, Johnny Hodges, Artie Shaw,
Benny Goodman, and John Kirby. Hodges seems a bit of an odd choice --
his inclusion shows up Duke Ellington's absence -- but his orchestra's
two tracks, Junior Hop and the evocative Daydream, are personal
favourites. As are familiar recordings like Shaw's Moonglow and My Blue
Heaven (complete with harpsichord) and Goodman's The Smo-o-o-oth One.
Glenn Miller and the Army Air Force Band (Jazz Tribune)
* MILLER's military band recorded the 28 tracks on this double CD
between June 1943 and June 1944, six months before the bandleader went
missing en route to France. Some of his most famous numbers are included
(Tuxedo Junction and Saint Louis Blues March, for example), but if
you're looking for tracks familiar from The Glenn Miller Story, look
elsewhere: there's no Pennsylvannia 6500, no Moonlight Serenade, no
String of Pearls . . . Probably best left for Miller aficionados.

HAVING opened its by-election campaign by claiming its opponents would
tell lies, Labour was accused yesterday of being guilty of the first
whopper of the hustings.
SNP chief executive Michael Russell wrote to Labour calling on it to
withdraw the figures it had been publishing about the results in last
month's unitary elections in the 20 wards that make up the parliamentary
constituency, claiming that they falsely bolster Labour's standing.
He said: ''Labour started off on an extremely negative note by
claiming the SNP would lie throughout the campaign. It is ironic
therefore that they started with a gross distortion.''
His concern is shared by the Scottish Liberal Democrats, whose
statistics are the same as the SNP analysis. Their campaign manager, Mr
Archy Kirkwood, said: ''Labour's promise to tell the truth has fallen at
the first hurdle. To the phrase 'Lies, damned lies, and statistics' one
can now add another category, Labour statistics.''
Both parties said that the actual number of votes cast last month gave
the SNP 36.6%; Tories 22.6%; Labour 19.9%; Lib-Dem 13.8%, and others
7.1%.
Labour, however, has been suggesting figures of SNP 32.9%, Tories
21.3%, Labour 20.6%, Lib-Dem 14.1%, and others 11.2%. The effect was to
narrow the gap between Labour and SNP and suggest that the latter had
slipped back from its 1992 General Election performance of 36%.
However, Mr Jack McConnell, general secretary of the Scottish Labour
Party, said the SNP was running scared. ''Our figures are an in-depth
and weighted analysis. We stand by them solidly.
''We strongly suspect the SNP's methodology and that of the Liberal
Democrats is not as rigorous as ours in producing a fair reflection
across the constituency. We have a consistently adjusted set of figures
and they tell the true story.''
Mr Russell said: ''Call me old-fashioned, but I believe in a system
where people cast their vote in the ballot box and then we count them
up. It is interesting that Labour consider this a suspect methodology.
They have effectively admitted fiddling the results.''
Mr Kirkwood said: ''This is just nonsense. If Labour think that basic
arithmetic is less rigorous than hocus-pocus maths, then their
statisticians should go back to primary school.''

IT wasn't only figuratively to escape from the war that people in
Glasgow went to the pictures so much in 1939-1945: for a lot of people,
enemy action was less dangerous there too. When the slide would go up
announcing that tons of high explosive were about to fall in the
vicinity of the Partick Tivoli -- all this is according to Couch
Potato's old mum, Maris Pink, by the way -- the film fans of Partick
stayed where they were, knowing that the Tivoli was better built for
battle than the eggshell surface shelters outside, or the rickety
tenement slums that they were also escaping.
And anyway: if you had to go, how better than while watching Cary
Grant in Arsenic And Old Lace through a reeking fug of Empire tobacco
and (this does not go for the mammy, of course) warning an American
sailor to keep his hands above the Plimsoll line?
What with VE Day coming up on Monday, Couch Potato thinks it might be
fun to re-create the last picture shows of the war, so we've checked up
on what was showing in Glasgow that week 50 years ago. There were a lot
of cinemas in Glasgow in those days, and sadly many of their more
intriguing-sounding attractions (eg Night Club Girl, Boris Karloff in
something called The Climax, and a choice between a Dangerous Journey
and a Perilous Journey) have since slipped into obscurity.
The following, however, should be available to rent or buy from the
more adventurous class of video dealer, and two or three of these plus a
compilation of old cartoons and a couple of American sailors (optional)
should take you right back to May 1945.
Humphrey Bogart was at the State, King's Park in the Free French
adventure Passage to Marseilles, his third or fourth remake of
Casablanca. Basil Rathbone was wowing them at the New Cinerama as
Sherlock Holmes in The Pearl of Death, while over in sophisticated
Shettleston a premature wave of post-war decadence was lapping over the
stalls from Otto Preminger's superbly seedy film noir Laura, with Gene
Tierney and Dana Andrews.
By way of serious entertainment, La Scala was showing the poignant
American family drama Dodsworth, with Walter Huston and Mary Astor, and
at the Bathgate Bedford there was the Spanish Civil War drama For Whom
the Bell Tolls with Gary Cooper and Ingrid Bergman. Romantics were
catered for with the Regency bodice-ripper Madonna of the Seven Moons
and by the oriental fantasy Kismet (Marlene Dietrich dances in gold
paint) at the upmarket Cranston's Deluxe.
All that showing in just one week . . . we should be so lucky. But
then, that's what videos are for.
If you want to learn something about the war as well as celebrate the
end of it, Couch Potato can recommend the new Reader's Digest set,
Britain Stands Alone, three 45-minute tapes edited down from Frank
Capra's brilliant 1942 documentary Why We Fight.
Prelude To War (retail, #10.99) traces the pre-war growth of fascist
militarism and oppression in Germany, Italy, and Japan; The Nazi Advance
(retail, #10.99) deals with the invasion of France, Norway, and Holland
and the British retreat from Dunkirk; and The Battle Of Britain (retail,
#10.99) celebrates Britain's fierce resistance, in the air and in the
factories, to the softening-up process for the German invasion planned
for 1940.

There was no getting away from it all during the war, but innovative
holiday makers usually managed a short break, finds Kirsty Scott
IN THE DAYS before Torremolinos, when tourism was still travel, my
grandmother took a trip round parts of Europe with a friend. It was in
the early 1920s and the two of them, both single, were considered quite
scandalous, setting off in their long leather coats and button-bar shoes
for Bruges and other cosmopolitan destinations.
That trip and a subsequent jaunt overseas provided fuel for numerous
adventure stories when the Second World War closed in around the family
and holidays were reduced to sporadic day trips, extended picnics, or
simple daydreaming.
Before the war and after, Scots holidayed at home, creating domestic
tourism statistics which would give the Scottish Tourist Board
palpitations today. Many went to stay with relatives, drifting out of
the city for smaller towns and villages, clearer air, and a sense of
change. Others ''took a house'', moving lock, stock, and barrel out of
the metropolis to Dornoch, Helensburgh, or Arran.
Childhood memories from this time include brightly coloured metal
pails, real wooden spades, new sandals with shapes cut in the toe, and
warm, warm weather.
The war itself and the ensuing blackouts, bombs, bereavements, and
scarcity of food or petrol still did not manage to stifle Scotland's
innovative holidaymakers. One man, a child during the war, remembers a
brief vacation in Port Appin after the family left Kilmarnock bound for
Glasgow in the back of a friend's van which was heading to the city that
morning.
By early 1946, holidays were starting to creep back into people's
thoughts and officials were already figuring out how to rebuild the
tourist trade, such as it had been before the war.
In May of 1946, employers were already noting the need for staggered
holidays after a survey found that 2[1/4]% of Scots took their holidays
in May, 8[1/2]% in June, 54[1/2]% in July, 28[1/2]% in August and
6[1/4]% in September.
One official from the North West Engineering Trades Employers'
Association told The Glasgow Herald at the time that vacation fever was
understandable, with the war over and life starting to take on some
semblance of normality. ''The burden of worry had been partly removed
and there was a natural inclination to have a really good holiday
together this year,'' he said.
In June of 1946 the Association of Health and Pleasure Resorts held
its first post-war conference at Eastbourne and called on the Government
to ''undertake propaganda overseas'' particularly in North America to
attract visitors to Britain. They also sent a deputation to the Fuel
Ministry to beg for a more generous petrol allowance for taxis during
the summer months, so that visitors could get around a little more
easily.
Later that year, the Foreign Secretary, Ernest Bevin, pledged to try
and do away with ''all the hindrances which stopped people moving about
the world''. He was speaking at the opening of an exhibition in London
on designs for holiday centres. He said at least 20 million people would
be getting holidays ''with pay'' in the following four or five years.
At around the same time there was a furious row north of the Border
over cheap railway fares and extra petrol allowances being made
available only after the main Scottish holidays were over.
Outside Britain, most of the top travel destinations ravaged by the
war, such as Paris, were starting the rebuilding process and the
visitors began to trickle back -- and the world took its first faltering
steps towards mass tourism.
As the years progressed it became easier to move around, privations
were replaced by higher disposable income and less straitened societies,
and travellers turned into tourists.
It was in the 1960s that the travel boom really took off. In the past
30 years the growth in leisure time and the flooding of the market with
cheap travel led to a world-wide rush for vacations. In the years after
the war and until fairly recently tourism was almost wholly confined to
developed countries. Even as recently as 1992 some 80% of all
international travel was undertaken by people from just 20 nations.
Now it is the world's fastest growing industry. By the year 2000 it
will be the world's largest and it has brought with it attendant
problems of environmental damage and pollution, destruction of cultures,
and unfettered development. Some people say that by the end of the
century tourism may have had a worse impact on many nations than any war
ever had.
The war itself has created its own tourist culture. One organisation,
Holts Battlefield Tours, specialises in military-history holidays and
has been extremely busy in the run-up to the VE Day 50th anniversary
celebrations.
Some of the places worst affected by the war are now major tourism
draws in their own right -- like Malta, where British and Maltese troops
were barraged by German and Italian planes and ships. Near to the Grand
Harbour entrance is the Siege Bell monument to 7000 who were killed
during the siege of Malta, many of them civilians. At Fort St Elmo a war
museum has been set up displaying an example of the E-boats used to
attack Malta and an old Gloster Gladiator aircraft which was one of only
three on the island when the war reached its shores.
In France, many resistance strongholds, now peopled by cyclists,
walkers, amblers, artists, and plain sightseers, have plaques placed
strategically in squares and streets remembering the dead.
Many soldiers also made notes of memorable places during overseas
postings and created their own mini-tourist boom after the war. One
woman recalls being taken to Cap Ferrat by her father after he had
passed through it during the war and promised himself that he would
bring his family back once the conflict was over and he made it home.

Malcolm Dickson, lecturer in politics at Strathclyde University,
assesses the biggest rejection of a party of government in British
electoral history
THIS weekend, several senior Cabinet Ministers will have the
unenviable job of trying to explain Thursday's disastrous results in the
local elections in England and Wales.
Conservative Central Office had been bracing itself for the bad news
for some time but party workers were hoping that some ray of hope might
emerge. This hope was misplaced, with the voters of England and Wales
rejecting the party of government in a way never previously witnessed in
British electoral history.
About the only chance of comfort rested with the projected share of
the national vote. Last year saw the two worst national results in local
and European elections on record for the Tories, with a low of 27%. If
their share did not fall below this level, then there would be evidence
that support might have bottomed out.
However, last month's Scottish elections showed that the Conservative
vote could slip further and that has now been repeated in England and
Wales, with an unprecedented low, in any widespread electoral test, of
25%.
In terms of councils won and lost, the Conservatives have lost control
of 59 out of the 67 districts that they were defending. Wales has now
become, like Scotland, a Tory-free zone in local government. The Tories
lost their last Welsh foothold in Monmouthshire. For both Labour and the
Liberal Democrats, the night proved to be one celebration after another.
Labour gained 39 councils, including tough fights in areas with new
boundaries such as the new extended York unitary authority. Labour's
national vote share of 48% is below the most recent Mori and ICM
surveys, but it was sufficiently close to the 50% level to suggest Tony
Blair can deliver good national results. This, of course, was the first
test of the English voters' verdict on new Labour under Blair.
The Liberal Democrats' projected national vote share reached within
one point of the Tories at 24%, allowing them to pick up 14 councils,
including the new Isle of Wight unitary authority and previous Tory
citadels such as Horsham in Sussex and Salisbury.
However, overall, can it be argued that this is simply just another
case, albeit chronic, of mid-term blues? One fact is extremely telling
in assessing this question.
In the vast majority of cases, an incumbent Government which suffers
bad mid-term results begins to see a recovery in vote share in the last
18 months to two years of a parliamentary term.
What spells danger for John Major's Government is the fact that we are
now into that last two years of his possible five-year term and his
party's vote share is going down.
What makes this position even worse is that the Tories are now losing
heavily to Labour in a way they have not done so for a generation.
In Dartford in Kent, for example, ward after ward fell directly to
Labour from the Conservatives. This is deeply worrying for the Tories'
prospects at a General Election. The crucial aspect of turnout does not
seem to wholly explain the depth of anti-Government voting.
In other words, it is not simply the case that Tory voters stayed away
from the polls -- although the lower-than-average turnout of about 38%
does indicate many did. What results like those in Dartford, the
councils in Essex and in South-east coastal towns such as Dover clearly
show is that many voters did switch from the Conservatives directly to
Labour.
A key question is whether that pattern of switching is likely to be
repeated in a General Election. The Conservatives have to hold out hope
that many disillusioned traditionally loyal Tory voters will indeed come
back to the fold.
Up until Thursday, analysis of voters' intentions on a regular basis
had suggested that bedrock Tory support was staying at home in droves in
the previous mid-term elections back to 1993, and that the number of
Conservative voters switching to Labour was very small indeed.
On the evidence of Thursday's test, Tony Blair's new Labour Party
appears to have passed a crucial first electoral hurdle by showing it
can win votes from the Tories.
However, this in itself is not necessarily evidence of new Labour
converts in the long term. What is abundantly clear from Thursday's
results is that voters in England and Wales have learned to vote
tactically in a far more sophisticated and widespread way than before.
Of course, voters in Scotland have used tactical voting on a
consistent basis for many years, but in England and Wales the phenomenon
had always been more localised and sporadic. Now we have a situation
where both Labour and the Liberal Democrats have scored successes where
they were the closest challengers to the Conservatives.
In detailed terms, this means that concentrated support, particularly
by the Liberal Democrats, has pushed the Tories back into second place
in many areas. This, allied to the first past-the-post voting system,
means that Tories in second place get no credit for even a moderately
high vote share.
Ironically, it is this feature of elections that has consistently
penalised the Liberal Democrats in England and Wales and, of course, the
SNP in Scotland. Now the Tories are suffering in the same way.
Again, this spells trouble for the next General Election. If Labour
can now seriously challenge the Conservatives in the parliamentary seats
covered by Thursday's gains and the Liberal Democrats continue to push
hard in those areas of the country where they are now strong in local
government, then the Conservatives' prospects for a fifth General
Election win are significantly reduced.
Thursday's elections have now reduced the Conservative presence in
British local government to a rump. The Tories now hold only about 20
out of the 450 or so councils in Scotland, England and Wales. For a
governing party to be reduced to such a level of representation presents
a serious political problem.
Central government holds the purse strings of local government
spending. Only 15% of local government spending is raised through the
council tax, and even here the Government has capping powers. The
potential for even more conflict between essential local government
functions and central government control is greater than ever.
One area of conflict that has held centre-stage in the campaign run-up
to these elections has been education. Thursday, therefore, saw protest
not only about how Mr Major's Government is performing on a national
level, but also crucially about its controlling influence in local
affairs. For the Conservatives to have any hope of resurrecting their
fortunes, there must surely be serious consideration of its policy
platform.
The clear message of all recent opinion poll figures is that voters
are not happy about what Government does. Only 10% of people on average
in the recent Mori polls are satisfied with Government performance.
It is here that the Tories most need to address their attentions.
Interestingly, more than 20% of people think John Major is doing a good
job -- over twice the satisfaction for his entire Government. While
there is no doubt that John Major is not popular, it is the whole range
of Government activities that produces the largest discontent.
If Mr Major was replaced tomorrow, it would do very little, if
anything, about the unpopularity of government policies.
What then can the Tories do to save themselves? If the reaction of
mainstream Tory opinion is anything to go by in the last 24 hours, then
it seems they don't want to do anything. The stiff-upper-lip approach of
sticking to policies that will win out in the end seems to dominate.
However, if these elections tell us anything, then it is that this
Government is more out of step with ordinary people than it has ever
been during the height of the poll tax fiasco.
Within the Tory Party itself, the belief that tax cuts are the means
of turning fortunes around is still strong. However, this could only
ever be a part solution. The Government must surely bite the bullet and
realise that using any surplus to satisfy demand over class sizes,
decaying school buildings and nurses' pay is likely to be as popular as
tax cuts if not more so.
It appears that any form of pragmatism has been lost by this
Government in relation to the public sector. It has made so many enemies
in recent years through NHS reform, privatisation of local services and
changes in education that it is now firmly barricaded behind closed
doors with an apparent inability to listen anymore.
The further confusion and argument being generated by rail
privatisation is also a deeply damaging policy approach for the
government. Gone are the relatively easy privatisations such as BT or
British Gas and the fiscal benefits they achieved for the Treasury. What
is left is a Government still pursuing an ideological approach to
policy- making at all costs against majority opinion.
Policy U-turns are not popular amongst politicians. However, it seems
that now is the time when they would never be more popular amongst
voters from Dingwall to Dover. Unfortunately for John Major, the
Conservatives' problems may run a lot deeper than a little local
difficulty.
Margaret Thatcher heralded a new market led Britain during the 1980s.
However, the market is a fragile and unstable mechanism. That
instability is now emerging to haunt Mr Major's Government even in the
face of strong economic recovery. The mid-term electoral blues may have
turned into a terminal illness.

SCOTTISH Cup finalists Airdrie are likely to start next season still
uncertain about their immediate future after the Scottish Office decided
that a planning application for a new stadium should be determined by
Strathclyde Regional Council and not Monklands District Council.
The Scottish Office has confirmed that it rejected the district's
appeal against the calling-in by the region of the application to build
a 10,000-capacity, all-seater stadium on 30 acres of green-belt land at
Raebog Road, Airdrie.
The decision means that the application will be determined by the
larger authority, which would prefer a stadium to be built in an
existing built-up area and might reject the plans. The matter is to be
decided by the region's planning and development committee, but probably
not until August 2.
Airdrie, who sold their former ground, Broomfield, to the supermarket
chain Safeway, are seeking to build a #7m stadium to meet the safety
requirements of the Taylor report, set up after the Hillsborough
disaster.
The stadium would be financed partly from the #5m the club made by
selling Broomfield and from a Football Trust grant, which is likely to
exceed #1m.
Airdrie chairman George Peat said: ''As every day passes this is
costing the club money, but it has not got to the stage where refusal
would put us out of business.
''This whole thing has come about because the Government brought out a
report which football clubs had to comply with. We didn't in our wildest
dreams envisage such difficulties in procuring a site.''
Monklands district had granted Airdrie planning permission for the
Raebog Road site and stated that it believed it was the only viable
opportunity following an appraisal of several sites in the area.
However, the region recommended that it should be allowed to determine
the application in view of the conflict with established structure plan
policy and because the size and location of the proposed stadium meant
the plan was of more than local significance.
In deciding to dismiss the district's appeal, the Secretary of State
supported the region's view by concluding that the proposed development
was ''significantly out of accord'' with approved green-belt policies in
the structure plan.

Belfast
SCENES of Protestant violence in east Belfast were yesterday described
as ''disgraceful'' by the Northern Ireland Secretary, Sir Patrick
Mayhew.
Seventeen police officers were injured when loyalist rioters set fire
to vehicles, hurled petrol bombs and stones, and looted businesses.
The trouble on Thursday night, which followed a VE commemoration
parade by Orangemen in Belfast, has led to fears of further violence
during the forthcoming season of Orange marches across Northern Ireland.
Sir Patrick, in a statement, condemned the rioting, which followed
disturbances in Londonderry on Wednesday during a visit by Prime
Minister John Major.
Sir Patrick appealed to community leaders to help defuse tension in
the interests of the peace process, which enters a crucial phase next
week. The Northern Ireland Minister, Mr Michael Ancram, is expected to
have a first meeting at Stormont with a Sinn Fein delegation led by Mr
Martin McGuinness.
Thursday night's street disorder began after an Orange march,
returning from central Belfast, passed the fringe of the small Roman
Catholic enclave at Short Strand, in the east of the city. As is so
often the case, there are conflicting accounts of what happened.
Marchers claimed they were taunted by a small Catholic crowd and
missiles were thrown. But other witnesses claim the provocation came
from people connected with the march.
Whatever the truth, there followed hours of street rioting and
familiar scenes from the past were re-enacted as RUC vehicles attempted
to storm through a burning barricade and looters went on the rampage.
Three people appeared in court yesterday and at least seven others are
expected to face charges. Twelve men and one woman have also been
charged in connection with the Londonderry trouble on Wednesday.
The trouble is a blow to the RUC's attempts to adopt more normal
policing methods in Northern Ireland. They have now dispensed with
wearing flak jackets and this weekend will be patrolling the many VE-Day
celebrations dressed more casually in shirt sleeves. However, on
Thursday night the police, who had not been expecting trouble, had to
revert swiftly to donning full riot gear.
One of the problems facing the authorities is the forthcoming marching
season. Supporters of Sinn Fein have also been engaged in an increasing
number of street protests, such as that which led to the riot during Mr
Major's visit.
Sinn Fein is campaigning to have some Orange parades rerouted away
from Catholic areas and the RUC is facing several awkward situations in
which they have to decide whether to allow marches to go ahead as
planned or reroute them in the weeks ahead.
* Five men and a woman were charged with firearms and ammunition
offences at Dublin's anti-terrorist Special Criminal Court yesterday.
They were remanded in custody until June 20 after being arrested by
Special Branch detectives in Tallaght village, Dublin, on Thursday.
The court remanded the five men to Portlaoise Prison and Ms Hayden to
Mountjoy Prison.

TWO sisters yesterday made an emotional appeal for help in catching
their brother's killer.
Mrs Brenda Walker and Mrs Catherine Pearson sat huddled together as
they told how they could not understand why anyone would want to kill
their brother, Mr Robert Higgins, 34, from Dalmeny, West Lothian.
His body was found in a field by a man out shooting with his two sons
on Monday.
Detectives have revealed that Mr Higgins, who lived with his mother,
Agnes, was stabbed to death in a savage attack.
Yesterday Mrs Walker, 33, said: ''He was just a friendly guy. He
wouldn't do anybody any harm. He loved going out at the weekend and
enjoying himself.
''In the pub he would buy anyone a drink and talk to anyone. He didn't
drink during the week. He was like most single guys and liked to go out
for a drink at the weekend.''
Mrs Walker, from Kirkliston, West Lothian, said she thought his killer
might be a stranger he had met.
''I can only think it was a stranger he must've spoken to in a pub.
Whoever did this does not have a mind.''
She added: ''This has left us all totally devastated. We're just numb.
''We'll never come to terms with his death. We keep thinking he's
going to jump out of a taxi and say, 'I'm here'.''
Detectives are trying to piece together Mr Higgins's last movements.
He was last seen in the High Street, South Queensferry, on the
outskirts of Edinburgh, last Saturday between 11.30am and noon. He had a
plaster across the bridge of his nose.
Detectives are now ruling out suggestions that Mr Higgins had lived
rough since he was last seen near his home.
He failed to come home after being out drinking on Thursday night last
week.
They now believe that the chicken factory worker had been staying with
someone.
Mrs Walker said: ''He has stayed somewhere before he was murdered, but
we don't know where. He wouldn't have slept rough outside.''
Detectives are now ruling out robbery as a motive for the murder.

THE new North Ayrshire Council has appointed Mr Bernard Devine,
currently the chief executive of Cunninghame District Council, as its
senior official.
Mr Devine, 48, has been in charge at Cunninghame, on whose boundaries
the new authority will be based, for eight years.
He began work with Airdrie Burgh and later became director of
administration at Monklands District Council.
Married with two sons and two daughters, he lives in West Kilbride.
Earlier this week the new South Ayrshire Council appointed Mr George
Thorley, 47, to be its chief executive. He is expected to start with the
shadow authority at once to prepare for government in April 1996.
Mr Thorley, who is married with two daughters and lives in Carluke,
has been with Strathclyde region since 1975 and is currently assistant
chief executive of the region.
South Ayrshire, which will be under Labour control, will take over
from Strathclyde and Kyle and Carrick District Council next year.
Mr Thorley was lead officer during Glasgow's year of culture in 1990
and played a lead role in the city's successful bid for the title of
City of Architecture and Design 1999.
The new #89,000 a year chief executive of the unitary Fife council is
to be the current regional council's top official Dr John Markland, 47.
A graduate of Dundee University, Dr Markland worked with Somerset
County Council and Tayside Regional Council before joining Fife Regional
Council as assistant chief executive until his appointment to the top
post in 1986.
Currently chairman of the Scottish branch of the Society of Local
Authority Chief Executives, Dr Markland, a father of four, is also an
adviser to the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities' executive and
finance committees and a director of both UK2000 (Scotland) and Fife
Enterprise.
The #68,000 a year chief executive of the new Inverclyde council is to
be Mr Graeme Bettison, 40, senior deputy director of administration with
Grampian Regional Council.
Mr Bettison graduated in law from Edinburgh University and started his
local government career in 1978 with West Lothian District Council. He
moved to Dumfries and Galloway Regional Council in 1981 as personal
assistant to the chief executive and two years ago took up his present
post in Grampian.

ROBBIE DINWOODIE reports on a fresh controversy in the Perth and
Kinross by-election campaign.
THE Tories attempted to brand their SNP by-election opponent at Perth
and Kinross as a ''closet republican'' yesterday, only for her to come
out openly and oppose the monarchy as the ''pinnacle of the class
system''.
Conservative candidate John Godfrey again refused to apologise for his
election leaflet statement linking Scottish nationalism with Nazism, in
spite of a barrage of criticism.
Although his support speaker, Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, said VE Day
''embraced all the people who participated in that victory,'' he seemed
again to seek political gain for the Tories by contrasting the
celebration to the republican beliefs of Ms Roseanna Cunningham.
He claimed that she was now ''coyly'' concealing these beliefs and
urged her to come clean. ''We will respect her for her courage, but
passionately oppose her anti-monarchy sentiments,'' he said.
''And today of all days. Today the Queen is addressing a special joint
session of Parliament in recognition of the 50th anniversary of VE-Day.
It is a significant occasion, not just for Parliament but for all the
nations of the United Kingdom.
''Throughout the Second World War and every subsequent war, it was her
father and now our Queen who have acted as the focal point of the
nation, the touchstone of our efforts, the comforter in times of woe.''
Ms Cunningham, who has made no secret of her personal views said:
''This is hardly a stunning revelation, is it?''
However, she emphasised: ''I am standing here as an SNP candidate and
the SNP is not a republican party. Making a personal U-turn at this
stage would not be credible.
''I was brought up in Australia, and my views there were
uncontroversial, but it is not the majority view of the Scottish people
or a majority in the party. I accept that, but my personal views haven't
changed.''
Facing her first rough treatment at the hands of the media since the
hustings started, she was pushed repeatedly to explain why she opposed
the monarchy, and finally said: ''I think it is the pinnacle of the
class system.''
No such words were forthcoming from New Labour candidate Douglas
Alexander. Pressed for some of the republican fire for which some in his
party used to be famous, he would only repeat that he accepted the Queen
as the Head of State. Asked for his view on the class system in Britain,
he would say only that inequality existed.
Was there a class system in Britain? Inequality exists, he repeated.
The ''c'' word, it seemed, had become too shocking to use in polite
Labour circles.
Mr Alexander said that the SNP was fighting a phoney war -- publicly
aiming its fire at the Tories, while targeting Labour on the streets and
at doors.
Shadow Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said that winning Perth and
Kinross was a realistic aim, explaining: ''Yesterday, Labour had its
best election results since Keir Hardie looked out over a Lanarkshire
pit and dreamed of a united Labour movement.''
He said that the Tories had been buried in a landslide, as a result of
an overwhelming thumbs-up from the electorate for Tony Blair's approach.
''Labour has won middle England,'' he said. ''We can also win Perth and
Kinross, which is middle Scotland.''
However, claiming that the constituency was natural Liberal Democrat
territory, their parliamentary spokeswoman Ray Michie -- speaking in
support of candidate Veronica Linklater -- predicted the break-up of the
UK within five to 10 years if Tory intransigence did not permit
Scotland's legitimate desire for a parliament.
She said ''It is this intransigent English nationalism which the SNP
needs to survive. What Scotland needs is home rule within the UK.''
The SNP said the local election results in the south, combined with
last month's Scottish elections showed that people were turning away
from a discredited Government in record numbers.
''Only the SNP can knock them out in Perth and Kinross, just as we
defeated them last month to take control of the new council here,'' said
Ms Cunningham. ''A vote for any other party would be to throw the Tories
a lifeline.''

SCOTLAND could have its first specialist sports school by the summer
of 1996.
Proposals for the #3m unit, for up to fifty 11 to 18-year-olds, are
with planners, but if the project is given the green light, work could
begin at the Edinburgh site as early as next February.
Welcoming the move, Scottish Sports Council chairman Graeme Simmers
said he hoped the project would lead to similar centres being set up in
Glasgow, Aberdeen and Inverness.
''The economics of creating it out of existing or established sporting
facilities is beneficial,'' he said.
The chairman of Lothian region's education committee, Councillor
Elizabeth Maginnis, said the Meggetland playing fields had been
earmarked for the new unit, with Royal High and Leith Academy providing
alternative homes should the proposal be rejected.
The authority wants permission to sell part of the playing fields to
developers, with the proceeds of the sale being used to create a hi-tech
base for the unit on the remainder of the site, including all-year-round
playing fields and changing facilities.
Talented youngsters would receive mainstream lessons at one of the
three secondary schools which use the playing grounds -- Boroughmuir,
James Gillespie's or St Thomas of Aquin's.
The unit, which will initially specialise in football, rugby and
hockey, would operate in a similar way to the capital's music school at
Broughton High in Stockbridge -- the only one of its kind in Scotland.
''We recognise that a few kids are really talented and need a bit
extra help to allow them to contribute to our national sporting life,''
she said.
Mrs Maginnis, who is also chairman of Cosla's education committee,
said she hoped organisations like the Scottish Football Association and
Scottish Rugby Union would offer expert training to youngsters.
Earlier, she told a conference organised by Scottish School Sports
that local authorities should not ignore opportunities encouraging
excellence in sport.
Facilities for able youngsters were vital to enable them to pursue
their sporting goals, she said.
''The Government must also recognise its responsibilities in these
matters and support local authorities in their endeavour to provide
top-class facilities. Until we can actually get these top class
facilities, providing for example a complex for team sports, it is
difficult to see how we will be able to take forward our idea of a
specialist facility for talented sporting youngsters,'' she said.
Mrs Maginnis said she was hopeful the project would be supported by
the four new unitary authorities which will replace Lothian region in
1996.

GEOFFREY PARKHOUSE,Political Editor, considers which Ministers could
become the targets of the Conservatives' frustration.
If Major is to stay, who will
pay the price of defeat?
IF the Prime Minister is to be ring-fenced in No 10, despite the Tory
polling disasters, who will have to go? And what can be done about the
couthy Mr Tony Blair who has shown himself, and his new model Labour
Party, to be acceptable?
One ex-Tory councillor, Mr Hugh Godfrey, of the formally rock-solid
Bury St Edmunds, said yesterday: ''We have men at the top of an academic
nature who are protected by their aides. They don't get to find out what
real people are thinking and wanting. They don't know what's going on.''
Mr Godfrey's council is now to be led by a 22-year-old unemployed
Liverpool University graduate, Mr David Stamp, who said: ''I was
surprised to win. It is the fault of central government, but it was a
vote for Labour as well.'' This exchange must have been replicated
throughout England and Wales yesterday.
Strangely, nobody so far has pointed the gun at Mr Major (who can
hardly be accused of an academic nature) personally. His Cabinet
colleagues, fearing for their own jobs instead, are vying with each
other to declare their utter loyalty for the Prime Minister.
There was already a sense of urgency about the Tories' situation
before the Scottish elections last month, and those south of the Border
on Thursday. The Tories have never been so low for so long in public
esteem. The arrival of Mr Blair as Labour leader disappointed them.
They thought he would founder on his own inexperience and that this
would give them a breather. Instead they find he has a cool, sensible
head, courage and a devastating ability to investigate the day-to-day
minutiae of ministerial muddle. The problems of what to do about
themselves and what to do about him are closely linked.
As you might expect, Tory Central Office cast about for ways to
denigrate him, for some ''killer facts,'' as deputy chairman John Maples
put it. They failed. He is too darn nice and middle class and churchy.
Their hopes rose when he unashamedly acknowledged that he is sending his
son to a grant-aided school in the face of Labour political correctness.
Alas for the Tories, this internal Labour row blew over quickly. The
incident only reinforced the public's view that Mr Blair is a fresh,
independent mind who acts as he believes -- and in the matter of
educating one's own children, just as any Tory middle class voter would
act.
There was a short spell when some of the Tory bother-boys (as they
like to think of themselves; they should have seen Norman Tebbit) tried
to rough him up in the Commons. The Speaker wasn't having that, and
anyway it failed because he kept his cool and mocked them. You might say
that Mr Blair has passed with flying colours the first basic tests
imposed by enemies on a new political leader.
What next? The problem is for the Tories is that there is not a what
next? that they can provide. Over the past few weeks a selection of back
benchers -- left, right, and centre -- have spent a great deal of time
talking about Mr Blair.
I quote from their observations: ''He is running away with it fast.''
''He is genuinely gifted on his feet.'' ''His party needs him more than
he needs it. He requires no shoring-up like our man and they know it.''
''He can do what he likes with policy.''
This gets to the point. The Tories have to wait until nearer the
General Election before Mr Blair allows them glimpses of what he intends
to do to get to government.
There is little sign so far that he is going to indulge them now by
revealing his plans so that they discredit them long before the
electorate are given a taste. This could change, if his party insists at
the next Labour conference this autumn on more precipitate revelations.
So as far as Mr Blair, whom the Prime Minister unconvincingly labels
''silly'' as often as he can, is concerned, the Tories are going to have
to sweat. It is difficult for them -- and in particular, Cabinet
Ministers -- to attack him or his Front Bench when there is no substance
to attack.
Make no mistake about it, after the Tories were made to feel like the
1945-defeated German armies on the eve of the VE-Day 50th anniversary,
they are susceptible to panic and incautious action.
Over the weekend, there will be many Mr Godfreys of Bury St Edmunds
bending the ears of their sitting MPs.
If Mr Major cannot be dumped immediately and he indicated that he
would resist any such attempt, and if such an attempt cannot be made
until November when the rules allow it, what can be the target of the
Tories' frustration?
Economic policy belongs to the Prime Minister and his Chancellor
Kenneth Clarke. I know of no Tory who does not support their policy of
maintaining the recovery with inflation, while seeking tax cuts as soon
as possible.
I suppose that Mr Jonathan Aitken, the Treasury Chief Secretary, who
has a propensity for getting himself into personal hot water, could be
sacrificed. I have heard his name mentioned for the chop. His recent
attempts to rate-cap Strathclyde has not enlarged his fan club. But
aside from him, changes at the Treasury might not cut the problem.
Heritage Secretary Stephen Dorrell has made a fool of himself in the
past few months, advocating that people should cease to look at their
homes as an investment -- absolute anathema to the kind of Tories who
abandoned their party on Thursday. Something of a philistine in his job
(compared to David Mellor), he could be dumped. The National Lottery,
Winston Churchill and all, would not miss him.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley the Health Secretary, worthy as she is and a
willing workhorse, has probably killed off the Tory vote in London with
her hospital closures. Happily for the Tories, there were no London
elections on Thursday. But she has no political following at Westminster
and could be moved in favour of a quieter, less zealous soul.
Mr John Gummer at Environment (and local authorities in England) has
been around a long time and could be put out to graze loyally on the
back benches. But like the others, his going would not strike a fresh
new chord with the electorate. The sacrifice of Mr Portillo, champion of
the right would, but, then, he is the champion of the right and for that
reason is inviolate.
Sack Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd -- why? He gives a bit of
intellectual clout and he may be needed around when we have to get our
troops out of Bosnia. Ditto Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick
Mayhew, whose retention of his job is probably essential to the peace
process.
The closest I can get to a target for sacking is Home Secretary
Michael Howard, in charge of law and order and, in terms of the voting
on Thursday, found to have been inadequate. Last month the Prime
Minister went out of his way to praise him at the Birmingham Central
Council meeting of the all-important voluntary wing of the Tory Party.
Cynics believe that this is a sure sign of his departure.
It would also provide a scapegoat for the polling disaster that is
required. Law and order under his hands has been allowed to become a
Blair plus point. With his sacking, Mr Major could demonstrate that
those who don't succeed depart in favour of someone who can in the next
two years.
But Mr Howard is a personal ally of the Prime Minister's. The Tories
have so many problems now that it is hard to see how they can dig
themselves out of this hole. Perhaps this is why a senior back-bencher
Mr Peter Temple-Morris said yesterday: ''I feel very depressed. I feel a
sense of hopelessness that, ironically, we've won many of the political
arguments of the day yet the party seems to be on its knees.''
By next Tuesday, he may be speaking for a majority.
THIS IS A WOB
Views of a rout
''I am very pleased with the results. I hope and believe they are a
turning- point in British politics, because I think the vote was not
just a vote against the Conservatives, it was a vote for today's Labour
Party, for new Labour.''
Labour leader Tony Blair
''It was not a meltdown. It was a very disappointing result indeed.
The Government has acted in the national interest and the national
interest does not always immediately translate into instant popularity .
. . you can't tackle the nation's problems with a soundbite.''
Conservative chairman Jeremy Hanley
''The fact that these results were expected does not mitigate the
message to the Conservative Party nationally, which is to shape up or
ship out. We ignore that advice at our peril. There needs now to be a
long, cool assessment of where we go from here. Simply relying on Labour
gaffes and an improving economy will not be enough.''
Mid-Staffordshire Tory MP Michael Fabricant
''John Major has . . . the courage to take tough decisions which do
bring temporary unpopularity. But he has the vision to take the
long-term initiatives which are transforming people's lives for the
better.''
Home Secretary Michael Howard.
''If the opinion polls do not markedly improve during the summer then
many Conservative MPs will start to ask openly what they have wondered
privately for the last year -- whether being nice is enough and whether
John Major is up to the job.''
Anonymous Tory backbencher
''I have never run away from a difficulty in my life and I don't
intend to do so now. I don't make excuses. We have thus far failed to
persuade people that the long-term policies I am following are right for
the country.''
John Major
''I feel very depressed. I feel a sense of hopelessness that,
ironically, we've won many of the political arguments of the day yet the
party seems to be on its knees.''
Peter Temple-Morris, Tory MP for Leominster
''The position of the Prime Minister is absolutely safe. We are lucky
to have such a straight, honest, intelligent, and enormously resilient
leader. I don't think there will be any call whatsoever for John to be
removed -- and if there were it would receive little or no support.''
Dame Jill Knight, vice-chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 Committee
''The Tories aren't in a hole. They are in a bomb crater.''
Professor Anthony King, election pundit
''Wales has given the Tories a massive rebuff and sent them packing.
They should take the future in their hands and offer their
resignations.''
Labour's Welsh spokesman Ron Davies
''Any party, when it has the opportunity to be fashionable for a
moment, can produce a year's surge. But the Liberal Democrats over four
years now have produced continuous growth, not just over the
Conservatives, but establishing ourselves as the opposition to Labour in
the cities it governs in the north.''
Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown
''Conservative councillors who failed to win last night . . . can take
a sabbatical from local government with pride. The defeat they had last
night was not their defeat. They were the victims of a national
sentiment.''
John Major
''We are well placed in the battle to oust this Government. But there
is much more work to do and we do not stop to celebrate. We carry on
with the task in hand.''
Tony Blair
''The Conservatives are effectively wiped out as a force in local
government.''
Liberal Democrat President Robert Maclennan
''I apologise to all the Conservative councillors who have lost their
seats because of the failure of the Government. I've been warning the
Government for months now, and lost the Whip for my pains to some
extent, that they were losing touch with the people.''
Michael Carttiss, Tory MP for Great Yarmouth and Euro-rebel
''We have some problems and we have no doubts about that, but the
broad thrust of the policies is absolutely right and we have to stick to
our guns on those issues. I just wish some members of the Cabinet were
better at explaining them and saying the same things on the same day and
not contradicting each other.''
Former Minister Edwina Currie

HOUSING association workers yesterday staged a one-hour lunchtime
demonstration outside the offices of Scottish Homes in Glasgow in
protest at proposed cuts in Government funding.
The protest marked the opening shot in a campaign by the housing
association branch of the TGWU to halt the cuts and prevent further
privatisation of services that are currently provided by associations
and co-ops.
The TGWU branch represents about 700 staff working for more than 80
community-based housing associations and co-operatives in Strathclyde.
Mr David Sherry, TGWU secretary, said yesterday: ''Housing
associations house some of the poorest and most vulnerable sections of
society. These cuts mean that rents will be increased and housing
provision in many deprived areas will suffer.
''Jobs and services are under attack and the future of many small
community-based housing organisations is now in doubt. We are demanding
that Scottish Homes increases the public resources available for housing
and halts these cuts now.''
Mr Sherry was supported by Mr Chris Cunningham, of the Scottish
Federation of Housing Associations.
He told the 60 protesters: ''When Scottish Homes announced last year
it was going to carry out an internal review of acquisition and
development allowances and management and maintenance allowances, we on
the SFHA made it clear that was unacceptable and predicted a furious
row.
''Well, we were right. Both sets of proposals bear the hallmarks of
pre-determined outcomes. Both will have far reaching effects on
associations and I have yet to meet anyone who can point to any
association which will gain or benefit from them.''
He added: ''What we as a movement must do is to make clear to Scottish
Homes that what it is proposing is unacceptable.''
A Scottish Homes spokesman said last night it was now five months
since the policy review was published. ''It is surprising that the TGWU
has chosen now to raise its concerns with us.
''Scottish Homes has a responsibility to the Government and the
taxpayer to ensure that housing associations and co-ops are performing
as well as possible at all times and that they become highly efficient
and effective businesses.
''This is essential if the movement is to continue to attract public
and private financial investment and remain major players in shaping the
future of Scotland's housing.''

A SCOTTISH-based climber is poised to become the first woman to scale
the world's highest mountain on her own.
Ms Alison Hargreaves has neither oxygen cylinders nor Sherpa porters
as she makes her second bid in a year to conquer Mount Everest.
The feat has been achieved by only one climber, Reinold Messner, from
Italy, a man regarded by many experts as the best in the world.
Britain's only professional woman climber, Ms Hargreaves is currently
high on the rocky slopes of the 29,028ft mountain in the Himalayas.
She has twice been at an advance camp, at 23,000ft, since she
separated from a companion at base-camp over a week ago.
She has had to suffer super-chilled winds driving blizzards in
sub-zero temperatures as she acclimatises to the altitude.
More settled weather is expected in the middle of the month, and it is
then that she plans her final push to the ''roof of the world''.
Ms Hargreaves comes from Belper, in Derbyshire. She started climbing
on rock-faces in the local Peak District when she was just 14.
Before she left school she had graduated to winter climbing in the
Highlands, regarded as one of the world's top training-grounds for
budding mountaineers.
Ms Hargreaves, 32, who uses her maiden name for climbing purposes, has
been married seven years, and has two children.
Her husband Jim Ballard is remaining behind at Spean Bridge, near Fort
William, looking after the children, Tom, five, and Katie, three.
He spoke yesterday of his confidence that she would be safe: ''I am
not worried by her climb. It makes no difference if she is climbing
Everest or the Eiger or Ben Nevis, she is very capable.'' He added:
''The most dangerous part of any climb is getting to the airport in your
car.''
She has already completed the classic north faces of the Alps,
including the Eiger and Matterhorn.
This time on Everest she is making her solo bid from the Tibet side of
mountain, the tough route up North Ridge and Face of Everest. It was
only first conquered in 1980.
She has been keeping in contact with her colleague at base camp by
walkie-talkie radio messages.
Some of these have been relayed to the Nevis Range Ski Centre on
Aonach Mor.
Yesterday Cally Fleming at the centre said: ''The last we heard from
her she was in good spirits. She said the climb was high but her sleep
was low.''
Her effort is regarded by mountain experts as among the most
significant climbs ever undertaken by a woman.
Last autumn she made an attempt on Everest from Nepal, when she got to
within 1500ft of the summit before being forced back by blizzards.
She is planning a unique double this summer, with the world's
second-highest peak also in her sights.
She aims to scale K2, the 28,253ft mountain in the Karakorum range, in
Pakistan's Western Himalayas and starts her expedition there in Mid-June
whether or not she has tamed Mount Everest by then.
However, she expects to spend at least a fortnight at home in the
Highlands before embarking on her second challenge.
She trained on 3999ft Aonach Mor before departing to Lhasa, Tibet, for
the start of her present Mount Everest bid.
She ran, skied, climbed and mountain-biked there this spring, to build
up her stamina, strength, and fitness.
Her present position is within sight of the spot where George Mallory
and Andrew Irvine disappeared during their 1924 expedition.

MANAGEMENT and unions at Scottish Nuclear have gone their separate
ways as the campaign against merger and privatisation is stepped up.
As union officials held a series of meetings at the East Kilbride
headquarters the management maintained its external and internal silence
on the future of the company.
The union side made it clear, however, that the campaign would gather
pace in the days leading up to Tuesday's White Paper publication and
that their focus was clearly set on Scottish Nuclear remaining a
separate entity under public ownership.
Cracks began to appear in the common cause approach of managers and
workers which had characterised the campaign as soon as media reports
had made it clear that the Government wished to merge Scottish Nuclear
and Nuclear Electric under a single For Sale sign.
As members of the Scottish Nuclear Workers Campaign emerged from
meetings yesterday they made it clear that the fight against
privatisation was to be moved on to the national stage.
Mr Frank Alexander, of the GMB union based at the Hunterston nuclear
power station, said: ''The fight goes on but it is clear that we are
fighting privatisation on our own now that details of the merger have
been made public.
''Because the chairman and chief executive appear to have been gagged
until next Tuesday it is not certain what their exact position is, but
we have been left in no doubt that we will not be joined in the campaign
against privatisation by senior managers.''
He added: ''We will be taking the campaign on to the national stage
and plan to meet the energy sub-committee of the STUC on Tuesday two
hours before the announcement to outline the campaign and seek their
support.
''We will also be hearing from national officials of all the trades
unions involved and will be contacting workers representatives in
Nuclear Electric to find out if there is common ground on which the
campaign can be fought.''
The only message from Scottish Nuclear chairman James Hann yesterday
came in the form of a communication to workers detailing a meeting he
had had with the Scottish Industry Minister, Mr George Kynoch.
He gave an upbeat and optimistic message saying that he had been given
assurances on the future of Scottish Nuclear and of the jobs of its
workers at headquarters and the power stations at Hunterston and
Torness.
Mr Alexander said: ''It was a very upbeat message from the chairman,
but I am afraid we are not convinced. There must be doubt cast on any
assurances as we have heard them before, not only from the Government,
but from major companies who have said that jobs will be created and
headquarters maintained in Scotland.
''We find it difficult to be so upbeat and must step up the campaign
to ensure that Scottish Nuclear remains a separate public company. It is
disappointing that the company is not in a position to stay with us in
the campaign but we are not entirely surprised.''
Company sources indicated that the Government, as sole shareholder,
was insisting that no comment should be made until Tuesday but that
their position would be outlined then. It is widely expected that they
will be working towards making the best of the unpopular merger
proposals and endeavouring to safeguard the identity of the company and
the security of the workforce.
Mr Brian Wilson, Shadow Trade and Industry spokesman and constituency
MP for the Hunterston area, said: ''It is now clearer than ever that the
only way to ensure a healthy future for Scottish Nuclear and its workers
is to bring an end to the privatisation plans.
''While the merger proposals are an important aspect of the argument,
and are disgraceful, it is self-evident that the real issue is the
Government's blind loyalty to privatisation.
''I find it sad that Scottish Nuclear should choose to abandon the
workers with whom they appeared to have common cause just a few days
ago. I will be giving every possible support to the union campaign in
the coming weeks and beyond.''
Councillor Colin Robb, leader of East Kilbride District Council, last
night called on the Government to reverse its decision to press ahead
with the ''unpopular and offensive'' merger plans.
He said: ''It is a fallacy to pretend that Scottish Nuclear will be
anything but submerged by the privatisation plans.
''Despite the reassurances that the East Kilbride headquarters of
Scottish Nuclear will remain after the 'sub merger', Scotland has had
promises before and they have fallen through. Why should the Scottish
people believe them this time?
''The dumping of Scottish Nuclear gives little regard for the
recognised efficiency of the workforce and the recent profit
announcements. The Government has ignored this and is clearly bent on
maximising the proceeds from the sale to deliver tax cuts before the
next General Election.''
He added: ''This country needs strong Scottish companies and over the
past several years of recession there have been few industries with high
profit, high efficiency, and high quality. There will be less if this
Government insists on flogging Scottish industry to the highest
bidder.''

IN the wake of the English council election results, Britain's biggest
bookmaker Ladbrokes has slashed the odds on a Labour General Election
victory from one to three to one to four.
So those looking for a certainty slightly better than the National
Lottery will now have to put up #4 in the expectation of winning #1,
rather than just #3 on Thursday morning -- ignoring the niggling 10% tax
on the stake.
There is a bet of a #1 win for #2 staked on there being a leadership
contest this year with Michael Heseltine the front runner at 5/4 and
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke at 3/1, as is Employment Secretary Michael
Portillo.
Dark horse Gillian Shephard is 6/1 and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd
at 10/1, At 16/1 comes Scottish Secretary Ian Lang along with Welsh
Secretary John Redwood and Heritage Secretary Stephen Dorrell.
The most intriguing is Chris Patten, Governor of Hong Kong, who may
want another post before China annexes the Crown Colony in 1997 and has
been insulated from the internal problems of the Tory party. He is at
20/1 along with David Hunt. But Lady Thatcher at 100/1 is probably only
for Tory diehards.
* LABOUR yesterday declared Wales a ''Tory-free'' zone as the
Conservatives failed to take a single council in the 22 new unitary
authorities.
The Tories also suffered an embarrassing rout in its last Welsh Tory
strongholds of Monmouthshire and the Vale of Glamorgan, leaving Labour
to claim that Welsh Secretary John Redwood and his ministerial team no
longer had any credibility in the Principality.
''They should take the future in their hands and offer their
resignations,'' said Labour's Welsh spokesman Ron Davies. ''Wales has
given the Tories a huge rebuff and sent them packing.''
* TORY Stuart Andrew was celebrating yesterday despite his party's
mauling, as he bucked the trend to win a seat from a sitting Labour
councillor.
Mr Andrew, 23, won the Maes Y Dre seat on the new Wrexham unitary
authority in North Wales by just four votes, beating Labour's Ray Floyd.
Mr Andrew, a former Welsh Young Conservatives chairman and current
chairman of the North Wales Conservative Association, said: ''Basically
I think people wanted a good effective voice to stand up for them in
Maes Y Dre, and they haven't had that in the last four years.

L S Lowry's ''VE-Day'' stole the show at Kelvingrove Art Gallery and
Museum in Glasgow yesterday, restored to its former glory after its much
publicised theft in March 1992 during a function at the gallery.
The painting -- signed by the artist and dated 1945 -- was returned
slightly damaged six months after it was stolen.
It portrays celebrations in an unnamed British town to mark the end of
the Second World War in Europe.
Glasgow Corporation first acquired it in 1946, when the artist,
Lawrence Stephen Lowry -- born in Manchester in 1887 -- was working as a
clerk with the Pall Mall Property Company in Manchester.
Lowry continued to work as a clerk until 1952, even after he became
famous for his matchstick working-class streetscapes which often
incorporated scenes and buildings from the Salford area of Manchester.
He died in Glossop in 1972.

LABOUR'S attempt to take the pulse of Britain's small businessmen and
women wound up in Glasgow yesterday with promises of tough action
against slow payers and more money for start-ups.
After more than a month on the road meeting members of Britain's
business community the party's Euro MPs said they had been left in no
doubt about the main fears and problems.
Throughout a series of five conferences, held in different cities,
Euro MPs said the same concerns over late payments and lack of financial
support had been voiced over and over again.
Mr Wayne David, leader of Labour's 62 MEPs, pledged the party would
consider legislation to force companies and consumers to pay bills on
time.
'' ''Europe-wide legislation to curtail this practice is needed,'' he
said.
''We would argue that there should be a statutory period during which
payments must be made. If not then compensation should be paid.''
Yesterday's meeting at Strathclyde region's headquarters in Glasgow,
the last in the series, was chaired by Glasgow MEP Mr Bill Miller. Guest
speakers included Marilyn Orcharton, director of the Glasgow Chamber of
Commerce, and Nicholas Goulding, head of policy at the Forum for Private
Business.
Mr Miller said another key issue to arise was the difficulty many
small companies had in raising venture capital. He said steps would be
taken to make European resources more accessible to Scottish businesses.
He added that the small business could be the key to tackling many of
Europe's unemployment problems. ''There are 20 million people unemployed
in the European Union. If every small business was to employ one person
we would slash unemployment by 15 million.
''That is a simplistic solution but it gives an idea of the importance
of small businesses within Europe.''
''What Labour Euro MPs are trying to do is help build a constructive
dialogue between Labour, Europe and the business community.''

THERE were early signs last night of a shift by Scottish trust
managers towards paying nurses the full 3% pay rise on the eve of a mass
rally in Glasgow.
Grampian Healthcare, has joined North Ayrshire in offering the full
amount with no strings. Others in Glasgow and Edinburgh are believed to
be preparing the same terms for meetings next week.
RCN Scottish Secretary Ms June Andrews said yesterday the second offer
was welcome, and there were indications than a number of trusts were
going to follow suit. ''This shows that trusts have got the money and
they can pay it.''
''What some have been doing is playing stupid games by holding back or
making silly conditions when they know what we want is a general
announcement.
''What we are saying to trusts is don't mess us about, because we can
give you a hard time locally. But we recognise that many Scottish
managers value their staff and want to pay the 3% and we expect the
offers will now start to flow in,'' Ms Andrews added.
Scottish trusts have been much slower than those in England and Wales
in making local offers. The two pledging 3% so far in Scotland compare
with more than 100 south of the Border.
This was originally attributed to simple inertia or a wait-and-see
attitude by the Scottish Office. However, The Herald understands there
was a much more deliberate policy of containment by the Scottish NHS
management executive in meetings with trust managers.
It was only last week, when the RCN UK Council agreed to review its
policy on industrial action that formal guidance was issued to trusts.
In his letter, Mr Mike Sibbald, NHS director of human resources, said
trusts were not prevented from making local offers.
The RCN is waiting for a critical mass of trust offers to ensure the
3% becomes universal before considering formal negotiations with trusts.
Today's rally in George Square will be addressed by Shadow Social
Security Secretary Donald Dewar.
Ms Anne Thomson, RCN officer for Glasgow and the Western Isles, said:
''We have had a good response. There is no way nurses are going to sign
away their terms and conditions for 1% or 1.5% of what is not a good
wage.''

Face to face with the cream of the German Navy . . .
a victory parade in George Square . . . a bonfire bigger
than Gracie Field's aspidistra . . . we asked readers for
their memories of this momentous day in history
TUESDAY the eighth of May, 1945, turned out to be a memorable day for
me, a 21-year-old Royal Naval telegraphist aboard a minesweeper at the
top of the Minches in the Atlantic near the Butt of Lewis in the Outer
Hebrides.
Our flotilla was on its second day out from Stornoway, with the ships
stretched out on a routine sweep in full look out for mines, but the
ship's crews and officers were trying to come to terms with the fact
that the war in Europe had ended, when in the late afternoon ''action
stations'' were sounded aboard our ship.
To our shock and surprise a German U-boat rose menacingly to the
surface, and slowly at the masthead she hoisted a black flag. The German
High Command had ordered all U-boats to surrender unconditionally to the
nearest Allied naval ships, and the hoisting of the black flag was the
surrender signal.
After the panic had subsided messages were rapidly exchanged with our
flotilla leader and the naval base at Loch Ewe and finally we were
instructed to order the German U-boat to follow in our wake into Loch
Ewe. Hours later we steamed into this great loch where in the past few
years convoys to Russia and the United States had gathered and left with
naval escorts.
Formal surrender was undertaken by senior British naval officers who
boarded the U-boat and interrogated her captain and officers. Apparently
other U-boats were also expected there.
Our crew was ultimately allowed to board this U-boat and inspect what
had been the hated scourge of all Allied shipping. Ironically we had
formally to salute the U-boat's officers before boarding their boat but
grudgingly we all knew this was the creme de la creme of the German
navy.
As a postscript to the U-boat's surrender in Loch Ewe, it was
established that several weeks before VE Day a U-boat operating in the
Irish Sea had laid magnetic mines in the Firth of Clyde. Our flotilla
was sent posthaste from Loch Ewe to the Clyde where we swept from dawn
to dusk from Ardrossan to Stranraer for nearly three months.
Mines were found and destroyed in the area around Ailsa Craig.

* I WAS born, on January 1, 1938, and brought up in Partick, at 18
Byres Road. I lived there through the bombing of the flour mills at
Kelvin Hall, the land mine in Kelvin Hall, and the Clydebank Blitz.
I remember being taken by my parents to see the V2 rockets and the
Lancaster bomber in, and at the back of, the Kelvingrove Art Galleries.
I also remember the Lancaster/Wellington bomber all in black in George
Square and being a pilot for a short time.
My most vivid memory was standing in George Square on VE Day and
watching the parade, covering all the Services vehicles, auxiliary force
units in the fire service (the old grey units and portable two-wheel
pumps), ambulance, police, Salvation Armyand many others, with a sense
of proudness that we had won the war.
As I grew up and followed my chosen profession as a marine engineer, I
sailed to Thailand, South Korea, and I also visited Japan, covering
Hiroshima and Nagasaki. That visit was in 1960, and though it was 15
years since the bombs had been dropped, the devastation was still there
to be viewed by one and all.
Some other memories I have, again once I had joined the Navy, was when
I docked in Hamburg, Germany. The port chaplain organised a trip up to
Belsen -- that visit left me with an everlasting memory of no noise, no
birds, and no trees. Just large mounds as you went through the stone
pillars with ''Belsen'' chipped out of the stone.

VE DayALL who have been in the Royal Navy will know that HMS Drake was
the Sunday name for Devonport barracks. In the spring of 1945 I was the
assistant Church of Scotland and Five Churches chaplain there.
At the beginning of May, we were daily expecting the announcement of
the German surrender. This, of course, would mean the end of the war in
Europe, but the war with Japan would not end. There was the risk that
the Japanese might attempt some naval activity in the Atlantic, and
there was the prospect that the Royal Navy would be engaged with
Japanese forces in the Pacific and would be needed to transport men and
materials to the Far East.
So we sailors were quite prepared to celebrate, but many among us
wondered how long we might be required to serve until VJ-Day.
Central to our celebrations was a bonfire in the middle of the parade
ground. The parade ground was slightly smaller than Bellahouston Park,
and in it there had been assembled a bonfire bigger than Miss Gracie
Field's aspidistra, flotsam from the Channel, lumber from the dockyard,
debris from enemy bombing, together like a pit bing, as dry as a
Sabbath, as combustible as Cantona. It was going to light up the whole
county of Devon and would be visible as far as Berlin. We had lived in
darkness for six years and now we would revel in light. The whole base
would be lit, the blackout ended.
In the middle of VE Day, somebody at the Admiralty decided that the
blackout at all naval establishments was to be maintained. Poor Drake
had to stay dark, and our commander said: ''No bonfire''. After all,
Pearl Harbor had been a disaster for the US Pacific fleet, and the
tricky, deceitful Japs might do the same to Devonport, Portsmouth,
Chatham, and Scapa Flow, and an observant MP might ask a question in the
House.
So the naval base maintained its blackout. But the blackout did not
apply to ships. Being a naval base, HMS Drake had dozens of ships. Some
were in dry dock, some were berthed at the many quays, some were
anchored in the river Tamar, many were anchored in the sound. All were
lit. Not just the odd light either, but every possible lighting print
was put into use. It was marvellous, and it reminded many of Blackpool,
only Blackpool wasn't so bright.
We were in darkness, admiring the ships.
Then there emerged a mass of sailors from the Beer Bar, when last
orders had been regretfully served. This was not a drunken horde, but
few were entirely sober, and not one of them cared what might happen
before he slung his hammock.
They made their noisy way to the parade ground, singing songs which
every sailor knew better than he knew the Lord's Prayer and the National
Anthem which he recited every Sunday at divisions.
The bonfire was composed indeed of combustible materials, mostly wood.
It burned magnificently.
The officer of the day was informed that the blackout had been broken
and the poor sod ordered the fire brigade to put the fire out. The
brigade quickly plugged in its hoses to the various plugs, which were of
course a long way away from the blaze, as the authorities had never
considered the likelihood of a conflagration in the middle of a parade
ground with no building near it.
Now the various lengths of hose had to be connected to one another.
When the firemen had connected two or three sections, the hilarious
sailors disconnected the sections further back, passed them along to
shipmates and these pieces of hose finished in the middle of the inferno
which was now of hellish proportions. It was little wonder that
fireproof hoses burned, but nobody cared all that much. When there were
no more sections of hose left, the decision was made to allow the fire
to burn itself out.
Ships' property had been destroyed. Reports would have to be made. The
loss, like most other losses, could neither be attributable to enemy
action, nor to sea damage.
So the Naval patrol was summoned. Names were taken. Charges were
outlined. Eventually peace prevailed. We put our heads down.
Naval justice could give the Law Society of Scotland a lesson in the
speed with which it is dispensed. The next morning the commander had a
crowd of defaulters outside his office, a crowd bigger than any which
has watched St Mirren for many a year, and there was a list of names and
charges.
The commander had spent several years on corvettes in western
approaches. He knew all about the events of the previous evening. He
thought it was a great way to celebrate the occasion. He picked up the
charge sheets. He didn't read a word of them. He tore them into pieces,
put them in the waste paper basket, and said something like: ''That's
that. Tell all these chaps to go away to their work.''
So began VE Day plus one at HMS Drake.

* ON May 8, 1945, I had been a Prisoner of War of the Japanese for
over three years and, at that time, I was in a fairly small camp in a
place called Nuching Sornou.
My day started at 6am with the camp bugler (actually it was a trumpet)
blowing Reveille; I was reluctant to get out of bed -- not because it
was comfortable, being a door balanced on two bits of wood -- but I
dreaded another day spent in these terrible surroundings. Dressing was
no problem as my only clothing consisted of a loin cloth; likewise my
footwear, because again I had none.
After a breakfast of thin, watery rice masquerading as porridge (no
salt, no sugar, no milk) and tea (no sugar, no milk) we paraded for the
Korean guards, who marched us (most in bare feet) over a very rough
road. If you did not keep in step, a rifle butt would make contact with
your bare shoulders. At a small railway halt we were handed over to a
guard of regular Japanese soldiers, one of whom always, quite at random,
picked out one of the prisoners and, for no reason at all, administered
a severe beating.
A small train with open carriages transported us to our workplace,
where we were constructing a fighter landing strip in the jungle
(totally against the Geneva Convention). After a few more kicks and
slaps we were put to work clearing the jungle on both sides of a small
track which was to be the basis of the fighter strip.
In the fierce heat of the Equator, the nearly naked and shoeless
prisoners struggled with sharp thorns and spikey undergrowth until the
guards called ''Yasume'' which meant dinner. A party of the less fit men
had brought four gallon drums of rice and sweet potato-tops soup which
was our midday meal; some of the men had found giant snails in the
jungle and took advantage of the cooking fire to roast these as a
supplement to their rice and soup.
The afternoon was a repeat of the morning and we once again took the
road back to camp, where a meal of dry rice and soup made from the
leaves of the sweet potato plant was waiting. There was a communal bath
and after the darkness descended we went to bed.
Later on, while were were working, the fighter strip would be strafed
by American P38 Lockheed Lightnings and it would eventually be destroyed
by a squadron of B29 -- luckily we had no casualties. We were oblivious
to the momentous events in Europe, although we had a secret homemade
wireless set which, most of the time, had to be buried.
The reader must be saying, ''What a good memory!'', but I have no
recollection of this day at all, which was the same as hundreds of days
before and hundreds of days to come. When we eventually reached home the
world was a very strange place and we had to start trying to assimilate
all the amazing things that had happened in the past four years. There
was no counselling, no psychiatry for us.

Bellshill.
DURING the war I was called up to the Gordon Highlanders in Aberdeen
and remained a Gordon throughout the war, though serving with a Regiment
called GHQ Liaison Regiment (Phantom). We were a secret organisation
responsible for direct communication from the battle zones directed to
Allied HQ. These duties took us to all fronts except the Far East.
We were in Africa, Italy, and then Europe. The Americans had no
formation like ours so we were loaned to them. We were with units of the
3rd US Army under General Patton which had reached Pilzen,
Czechoslovakia, on the day and were still facing hostile Germans holed
up in Prague. The Russians were dealing with them but we were subjected
to sporadic attacks from the air by pilots anxious to go down fighting.
I can remember our officer remarking that all over Europe people were
celebrating the end of the war and we were still more or less on active
service. Anyway, one of the patrols was approached by a GI who wanted to
borrow our Jeep. We thought it unwise and, after some explanation, went
with him to a large warehouse. We were a bit concerned as it was obvious
the place was guarded by US Infantry at every entry point. However, the
GI with us assumed he knew one area which was unguarded. I wasn't too
keen to risk being shot inside and waited for the GI's pals to bring out
whatever it was they were liberating.
It transpired the building was a supply depot for the Germans engaging
in the Russian Front and the loot was large packing cases filled with
bottles of all kinds of spirits plus pink and ordinary champagne. I
can't remember how many were taken, but there was sufficient to render a
large number of Americans incapable for quite some time. My mates and I
poured our share into a large basin which we kept topped up, offering
mug-fulls to all.
Later the civilians in Pilzen celebrated with a band in the street and
it was comical watching the GIs trying to jitterbug to the strains of
the makeshift brass band playing Czech tunes. Later, two of my pals and
I were invited to a flat in a large apartment building and spent the
night drinking and trying to converse. We could not make sense of their
language, having been there only a very short time.
One thing I do remember was that they were very much under the
influence of the Communist Party.
A day or so later we rejoined our regiment in Muenchen-Gladbach.
The patrol consisted of one officer, Captain Stileman; a corporal,
Bill Joss; a radio operator (me); armoured-car driver Pat Paige; Jeep
driver Paddy Watson; and two despatch riders, Alistair Clark and Taffy
Evans.
I have tried to make contact via Teletext on Channel Four but have had
no response.

The voice of the BBC gives
a Victory Report and other
personalities recall their day
JOHN SNAGGE is 91 on VE Day, May 8. He was the BBC manVE Day who made
the announcement that the war in Europe was over, although he says that
in fact it was Winston Churchill who broadcast the news -- he just did
the introduction.
''Churchill made it from the balcony of the Home Office,'' he said.
''There was a huge cheering crowd in Whitehall and he kept saying --
'This is your victory. Don't thank me. It is your victory.' He announced
he had just received a signal from the Western Front that Germany had
formally capitulated. It was a tremendous thing.
''The King spoke to the nation at 9pm and there were people like the
American President, the French President, Queen Wilhelmina, and King
Haakon and the chiefs of staff to introduce -- a whole lot of people.
Once the programme had started -- it was called Victory Report -- and
while it was going on, the producer suddenly had this idea and he rang
up the engineers at Buckingham Palace and said get the King on the
balcony at 9.30. He gave the order. The King went on the balcony.
''VE Day was my birthday, but I could not celebrate it as I wanted to.
It was not an occasion when you wanted to drink. I had to keep sober. I
was at it all the time. I went home the next day, turned up at the BBC
the day after that and got on with my normal job. I was presentation
director, the chief announcer, which meant I made all the arrangements.
''I lent the exhibition at the Imperial War Museum my official diary
of the day and my personal one, and they are in sharp contrast. Nothing
that had been previously arranged happened. They wanted world coverage
and I had to tell other organisations and fix the times.''
BARBARA CASTLE, who served as an air-raid warden in St Pancras, said
it was funny but she could not remember VE Day. ''It is odd, because I
remember the wartime very clearly. I recall we had a great celebration
with an enormous fireworks display and that it poured with rain. But why
do I not remember more? I don't know.
What was I doing in 1945? I was fighting an election. I was more
concerned about that. It was so exciting being an MP that I cannot
remember VE Day. I was probably addressing a meeting or something.
''I had also just got married -- my dowry was a lemon and a tea-towel.
I was too busy trying to make an omelette from powdered eggs. I can
remember the incendiary bomb attacks and being sent out with a bucket of
sand to scoop them up and stop the fires from gaining control.
''The worst thing was that after a long night you would go back to an
empty flat and you could not even sit down because everything was
covered in bomb dust. Normally when you come out of an emergency you
celebrate, but you could not celebrate in the war. There was nothing to
celebrate with.''
CHRISTOPHER FRY, the poet and playwright who wrote The Lady's Not for
Burning for the actress Pamela Brown, said he remembered the excitement
in the streets at the news. ''I was staying with her and her husband in
Soho Square and we walked down to Trafalgar Square and everyone was
going totally mad. People were dancing and wearing funny hats. But I
don't remember much more than that.
''I remember mostly the time during the war when I was in civil
defence and we were working in bombed houses and taking sewer mud from
Islington down to the East India docks and loading it on to barges. We
were down at Honduras Wharf trying to get this stuff loaded and a
colonel came by and said 'You have to have influence to get a job like
that'. I turned it into a poem.
''I met Pamela in 1940 when I was doing some productions at the Oxford
Playhouse and wrote the part in The Lady's Not for Burning when the war
was finished.''

WHEN the war in Europe ended, I was a 13-year-old second-year pupil at
Dalkeith High School in Midlothian. On Monday, May 7, 1945, our class
was told before we went home that if it were announced that night that
the fighting was over, we didn't need to go to school next day.
That is what happened. Word came on the wireless, and Tuesday, May 8,
was a holiday. It was named as VE Day, but a formal statement that
Germany had surrendered was not made until 3pm by Winston Churchill,
because it had to be synchronised with statements from Truman and
Stalin.
This kept people waiting before celebrations broke out in the
afternoon and evening of VE Day. I remember seeing wild revelry in the
centre of Dalkeith, with men and women capering by the light of
street-lamps.
May 9 was a national holiday, and I recall it as the first full day of
peace. We didn't return to school until Thursday. It was the end of an
ordeal, but I was not elated. The mood of my father and mother
communicated itself, and the over-riding emotion was relief. My parents
had lived through two World Wars and the coming of the second, only 20
years after the first, had dismayed them immensely.
Our war was on the home front. We were removed from the ferocity of
battle, but we all knew there was a war on. We put up with the blackout,
fear of air raids, gas masks, shortages of food and clothing, and
restrictions on movement. Our Sunday breakfast was dried egg from
America. My mother ran a small general merchant's shop, and we
experienced the perplexities of rationing and ration books from two
sides.
The wireless was our lifeline. I heard Churchill and remain grateful
to him for saving my life. Tommy Handley, with his uproarious show,
ITMA, was an irrepressible companion from 1939 all through the war.
(It's That Man Again originally meant Hitler.) Other voices that made an
impression were King George VI, J B Priestley, and American commentators
such as Quentin Reynolds and Raymond Gram Swing.
The news at 6pm and 9pm was essential listening, and programmes lifted
morale. One called Marching On brought encouraging reports, telling of
bravery by our men on different fronts, the dangers on convoys in the
Atlantic and north to Russia, the courage of resistance fighters in
occupied Europe, and the tenacity of our Soviet allies in the heroic
defence of Stalingrad.
It continues to amaze me how picture houses remained open all through
the war and provided memorable entertainment. Dalkeith had two in
Buccleuch Street, the Playhouse and the Pavilion, one considered
luxurious and the other ordinary. Both were much patronised. I was a
regular at the Saturday matinee and sometimes went twice a week at
night.
Hollywood created another world for us, and British films made a
notable contribution, too. George Formby starred in many comedies,
always providing a hilarious night. The East Side Kids, Abbott and
Costello, and Tim Holt and Gene Autry in cowboy pictures were popular,
and there were inspiring war films about the struggle in which we were
all engaged.
Although I was only a boy, I knew in 1940 that Britain was in danger
of being invaded. With my parents, I was encouraged when Hitler
blundered by invading Russia and Japan's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor
brought America in on our side.
The years 1940 and 1941 were gloomy. From late 1942, when the tide
turned at Alamein, our darkness was lightened and brightened
progressively as the Eighth Army advanced across North Africa, chasing
the Germans out.
It is strange to look back. On this anniversary, I am profoundly
thankful that those who risked their lives in the war ensured my freedom
for half a century.

In 1945, the beer drinker had to suffer for his art. Andrew MacKay
recreates the era with a specific lack of gravity
THE news has just come through that Germany has surrendered. A visit
to the pub to join friends, whose companionship has been so precious
throughout the war, is a must. Furthermore, it is with royal assent.
His Majesty's Government has taken a bold step by encouraging local
authorities to grant extension of the permitted hours for the sale of
alcoholic liquors. That the temperance movement will have something to
say about the king's commendation, there is no doubt. Their pious
warnings seem to proclaim spiritual death in every glass of light beer.
It seems reasonable to Cellarman that if some people, freed from the
stresses of the past few years, wish to express their feelings, they
should be allowed to do so in their own way, within reason. After all,
it is still an offence to supply alcohol to a drunk person. Of course,
many will not wish to celebrate to any great extent until their sons
have arrived safely home.
Apart from an air of euphoria at the pub, little has changed. The
blackout blinds and tape that sealed in the cheerless light from
Hitler's Luftwaffe have been removed, as has the blue bulb that simmered
at the door. There has been no increased delivery of beer supplies, and
whisky and wine remain absent.
Lack of supplies has been a feature of these past five years and the
scramble for beer when the draymen arrives is just as intense as the
childhood race for pennies from the bridegroom's wedding car. The
drinker who has not made acquaintance with the barman could easily
become part of a vicious circle.
To find himself unknown at the bar may well invite the comment that
beer is for regulars only, but that his luck might be better placed
along the road. After reaching that alehouse and eventually struggling
to the bar through a crowd swollen by a recent delivery, he may be faced
with the response that there are no glasses and, if he wants a drink, he
will have to supply his own. On entering the next pub, a table of empty
glasses just at the door raises his expectations. He grabs one and makes
for the bar, to be told that, due to limited supplies, one pint per
person is the limit.
Glasses, labels and bottles have all been in short supply but there is
no reprieve from regulations, even in wartime. Calder's of Alloa, whose
milk stout is made from ''nourishing ingredients'' and promises to be
''wholesome and invigorating'', have found themselves in court. Labels
used were part of an old supply and, because of shortages of
ingredients, the contents could no longer boast such qualities. The
company was fined #5 under the Food and Drugs Act.
At the outbreak of war the feared food shortage caused the brewers to
go to great lengths to applaud the food value of beer. Fears that vital
barley required in brewing would be directed towards feeding cattle
caused a clash between the temperance movement and the brewers.
It was claimed that a barrel of beer contained food value equal to
10lbs beef, 8lbs mutton, 4lbs cheese, 20lbs potatoes, 1lb rump steak,
3lbs rabbit, 3lbs plaice, 8lbs bread, 3lbs butter, 6lbs chicken and 19
eggs, all verified as accurate by a chartered accountant. Beer became
not only a refreshing drink but also a nourishing foodstuff.
The beer drinker was not, however, only being good to himself when his
desire was for a glass of ale. His contribution to the war effort was
quite substantial. It was bad enough in 1931 when Snowden's Budget
raised duty on beer to such a degree that company in the pub became
scarce. But during these war years beer has gone up to almost a shilling
a glass, the tax being 22 times that of 1914. Swallowing a glass of ale
has been like toasting our country and putting another spoke in the Nazi
war machine.
Breweries have done their best to keep supplies flowing and despite
the lack of materials their talents flourished to provide tasty,
although weak, beer. When Mr MacKay, the head brewer at Tennent's, had
his salary reviewed a few months ago, the only grumble came from the
draymen. But his #1000 per annum seems a fair wage for a man whose
weekly work is to provide a tonic for mankind.
At the pub, victory has provoked merriment and moderation has been
sweetly dismissed. But what have been missing more than anything are
young faces and to have the pleasure of their company again will truly
be worth celebrating.

BIRD thou never wert, indeed! You could fill a fat collection with
poems about the Skylark. But there would still be more birds than poems,
for it is a tough, successful species, the most widely distributed bird
in Britain, bar none. You can't get more than 10 kilometres from a
skylark -- anywhere. There are 25 million of them in the winter, and in
summer their song flights make an acoustic canopy over the whole island.
They are even agricultural pests, making expensive inroads into fields
of seedling sugar beet. Nothing ethereal about that.
Burns called it the ''sober laverock'' for its plain brown plumage.
The bird simply disappears when it lands. Such cryptic colouration makes
observation of its terrestial behaviour difficult on the sheepwalks or
the dunes. A few years ago an albino skylark wintered on our local
saltmarsh. Anywhere near us, it ran, flickered, stood tiptoe, peered,
flighted round -- an impression of nervous vitality which looked the way
it sounded in summer -- or would have, for white is conspicuous to
merlins too.
''Hail to thee, white spirit . . . '' doesn't have a ring to it, so my
own poem about the skylark remains unwritten. But even sober scientific
ornithologists are moved to lyricism by its song: ''The explosion of
sound, as dozens begin to sing at dawn, drowns the voices of other
species,'' enthuses the Atlas of Breeding Birds. Conversely, most poetic
descriptions are accurate, for every poet would have walked beneath one.
My own favourite is an anonymous seventeenth century poem which
describes the song as a stair the bird climbs step by step until ''she
streams away in rapture, turned clear into a soft piece of harmonious
air, all sung into a jelly''. Look and listen this spring, if you can
find somewhere far enough from the neurotic pollution of traffic noise.

I HAD a good war, as wars go, but at first found it all rather
confusing. I had arrived in Glasgow from Latvia only a few months
earlier and had already acquired a school uniform with a crest on my
blazer pocket, which more or less made me a native. I was just beginning
to get used to big city life when the war broke out and our school was
evacuated to Annan, Dumfries-shire.
We were accompanied by Old Ike, the headmaster of our Hebrew classes
(he could only have been in his forties, but anyone who devotes his life
to Jewish education becomes old before his time), who came bearing a
small version of the Ark of the Covenant on his shoulders, to make sure
that in leaving Glasgow we would not be leaving our faith.
He set up a kosher canteen in the church hall, where we ate on Shabbat
and at lunchtime on weekdays, opened a synagogue in a disused furniture
shop, and appointed me as verger.
I had two duties -- one difficult, the other impossible. The first was
to guard the precious bottle of sacramental wine, and as I was fond of
wine even then, it was a little like appointing a cat to look after the
cream; the second was to assemble a quorum for mincha, the Saturday
afternoon service.
More than 100 boys would come to synagogue in the morning, so it
should not have been impossible to bring together 10 in the afternoon,
but everyone was at the pictures or playing football in the park, and I
could never get more than five or six to turn up, all of them small fry
-- the sort of solitary little figures who tend to haunt religious
gatherings because nobody asks them to play.
Ike would tell us stories about the martyrdom of Rabbi Akiva and Rav
Tarfon, which did not add much to our merriment, and we would then sing
hymns in tuneless voices in the gathering dusk, while the shrill sounds
of sinners having fun wafted in with the evening mists.
I didn't have much fun on Sunday, either, for I was billeted with a
farmer and his two elderly sisters -- all of them strict Presbyterians.
They would spend much of the day reading and discussing the Bible and
would sometimes consult me on the more arcane parts of Ezekiel, in the
hope that with my connections I might know something they didn't.
They didn't like to play ball games ''on the Sabbath'', or even switch
on the wireless, except for the nine o'clock news (which in the course
of the war acquired a religious standing in its own right), so that it
was almost like having two Sabbaths per week.
In spite of the restrictions I came to love the farmer and his
sisters, the farm life, the cows, the sheep, the fields and woods, the
nearby river, the great, open skies.
Then one afternoon I was attacked by two older boys on the way home
from school, knocked to the ground, kicked and had my face rubbed in the
mud. My whole world fell in. I was back among the pogromchicks of
eastern Europe. Even Scotland wasn't safe.
The following morning, however, I discovered that there had been a
concerted attack by local boys on the evacuees. I had suffered not as a
Jew, but as a Glaswegian. I felt redeemed.

Our policy was based on acceptance of a situation we all deplored, but
were powerless to prevent
Gavin Bell reports on how the Germans operated an 'iron hand in velvet
glove' policy in the only part of Britain to feel the stamp of the
jackboot
WHILE much of Europe is celebrating VE-Day on Monday, the people of a
small outpost of the British Isles are reserving their main festivities
for a day later.
The delay is due to a quirk of history. On May 8, 1945, while German
forces throughout Europe were surrendering, a half-starved garrison
under the command of Vizeadmiral Friedrich Huffmeier, a loyal Nazi, was
still effectively in control of the Channel Islands.
Thus while crowds in Jersey and Guernsey were gathering to hear
Churchill announcing on the BBC that ''our dear Channel Islands are also
to be freed today'', they were watched by armed German soldiers and
swastikas were still flying from German fortifications.
It was only in the early hours of the following morning, when HMS
Bulldog arrived off Guernsey with a small landing party, that the formal
surrender was signed on the quarterdeck of the destroyer by Huffmeier's
chief of staff. Ever since, annual celebrations on the islands have
focused on May 9 as Liberation Day, the day on which the only part of
Britain to be seized by German forces emerged from a five-year nightmare
of occupation.
It was heralded by a hail of bombs and machine-gun fire on June 28,
1940, when German aircraft raided St Helier on Jersey and St Peter Port
on Guernsey, leaving 44 civilians dead and 30 injured. The carnage was
all the more shocking as the islanders were defenceless. The War Cabinet
had decided two weeks before that the islands were not worth defending,
and all military personnel had been withdrawn. Unlike the French
Government, which had declared Paris an open city to avoid bombing
raids, London had omitted to inform the enemy.
Amid scenes of panic some 28,000 islanders had already been evacuated
to the mainland, but more than 60,000 were left to an uncertain fate.
They feared the worst. British propaganda had portrayed the Germans as
Nazi monsters, bayoneting children as they stormed through the Low
Countries and France. In the event, the German infantry soldiers who
took possession of the oldest and most loyal possession of the Crown
were scrupulously polite.
A German professor who visited the islands on behalf of his Government
advocated an ''iron hand in a velvet glove'' policy. It was to be a
''model occupation'', at once a massive propaganda coup for Germany and
a social laboratory for the future invasion of mainland Britain.
The leader of Guernsey's governing council set the tone in an address
to its first meeting attended by the German Kommandant. ''May this
occupation be a model to the world,'' he said. ''On the one hand,
tolerance on the part of the military authority, and courtesy and
correctness on the part of the occupying forces, and on the other,
dignity and courtesy and exemplary behaviour on the part of the civilian
population.'' After the war, his successor said: ''Our policy was based
on a realistic acceptance of a situation which we all deplored, but
which we were powerless to prevent.''
Some 10,000 islanders served in the British forces, but for the next
five years their relatives and friends left hostage on the islands faced
daily lives riddled with moral dilemmas. Where did patriotism end and
self-preservation begin? The lines between tolerance and collaboration
were inevitably blurred when German soldiers billeted in private homes
exchanged precious supplies of food for having their clothing washed;
when friendships and romances developed; and when thousands of islanders
were eventually compelled to work for the Germans.
In her recent book, The Model Occupation, Madeleine Bunting writes:
''The occupation compromised almost everybody who lived through it; each
individual faced moral choices, and only a few could claim a calm
conscience by 1945.''
A local electrician recruited to work on a German construction site
recalls: ''You were as defiant as you could be. But what kind of
resistance could you put up?'' He had a point. By 1942 there were 37,000
German military personnel in the Channel Islands, or more than one for
every two islanders. Any acts of serious sabotage would have incurred
reprisals, and in any case London offered no support or supplies for
resistance activities. The islanders felt they had been abandoned and
forgotten.
As it was, more than 2000 British-born islanders were deported to
internment camps in southern Germany for the duration of the war. They
included the husband of Sibyl Hathaway, the Dame of Sark, whose
detention at Laufen Camp ruined his failing health and precipitated his
death in 1954.
But on the islands there were few casualties. A young Frenchman was
executed for cutting telephone wires at Guernsey Airport, and a local
farmer was shot dead while attempting to drive off German soldiers
stealing potatoes from his fields.
However, minor infringements of German regulations quickly filled the
small local prisons, to the point where offenders were ordered to go
home after being sentenced and await notification of when a cell was
available.
One of the unwitting victims of German justice was Rex Vaudin, a
haulier on Guernsey, who kept a loft of racing pigeons. One day he found
a stray bird in the loft carrying a message written in French. He asked
a French girlfriend to translate it, and she informed him it was an RAF
carrier pigeon bearing the co-ordinates of a bridge in France.
Unfortunately, she also informed the Germans, for whom she was working,
and Mr Vaudin was jailed for 15 days.
As the war progressed, the Germans' iron grip tightened. Step by step,
the Guernsey Government in particular was drawn into a compromising
position in return for peace, jobs, and food. The identification of a
handful of Jews on the islands, some of whom later died in Auschwitz,
remains a source of shame.
The islanders were also painfully aware of the presence of 16,000
foreign workers, most of them slave labour, imported by the Germans to
construct a vast network of coastal artillery and anti-aircraft
batteries, anti-tank bunkers, and command posts. Some 2000 of them died
of starvation and disease in what is regarded as the biggest mass murder
to have taken place on British soil.
Some islanders also starved to death after the D-Day landings cut off
supplies from France, reducing their rations to the bare minimum
necessary to support life. By May, 1945, there were no cats or dogs left
on the islands -- they had all been eaten.
The little island of Sark was liberated in a rather casual manner on
May 10, when three British officers arrived and asked Dame Sybil if she
would mind being left in charge of the 275 Germans there until some
troops could be spared. She remained in command of this dying ember of
the Third Reich for a week.
Fifty years on, the massive remains of the German fortifications and
impressive museums provide haunting images of what life could have been
like in Britain under German occupation. Photographs of German soldiers
marching past Lloyds Bank, flirting with island girls outside Boots the
Chemists, and getting directions from a British bobby, evoke disturbing
but curiously unreal cameos of a phantom war for those who did not
experience it.
Rex Vaudin, the pigeon-fancier whose unexpected guest got him into a
tangle with the Germans, died peacefully in 1991. His son Gary, a
student nurse, harbours no resentment towards the nation that persecuted
him. ''As far as I'm concerned, that was all in the past and our
endeavours now should be towards forging better relations with the
Germans.''
Michael Paul, a retired civil servant, was evacuated from Guernsey to
Oldham shortly before the occupation. ''I have come to realise that
people caught in that kind of situation will try to find a modus
vivendi,'' he says. ''This is a small island. There are no mountains and
no maquis to shelter a resistance movement. If they had not done what
they were told, there would have been terrible reprisals.''
In the run-up to Liberation Day, the Guernsey Evening Press has been
featuring reminiscences of islanders of the day their ordeal ended. Kaye
Le Cheminant recalled feeling a pang of pity for the German soldiers in
their shabby and thin green uniforms, in sharp contrast with the smart
khaki of the British.
''I am pleased to think that we youngsters could spare a thought for
these men who were, officially, the defeated enemy but, in all other
respects, were ordinary people who had homes and families like us and
must have been wondering then if they had either.''
But enduring resentment among some islanders surfaced recently when it
was learned that a liberation monument in St Peter Port, to be unveiled
by the Prince of Wales on Tuesday, made no reference to the nationality
of the occupation forces. The inscription on granite seating around a
15ft obelisk has been amended to read: ''To commemorate the fiftieth
anniversary of the liberation of Guernsey from the German occupying
forces.''
The visit of Prince Charles will be a highlight of several days of
celebrations on the islands, featuring street parties, military band
parades, fireworks displays, and a Battle of Britain memorial flight.
Pat Mellor, head of the Guernsey Liberation Day Committee, hopes that
young people will join in the solemnities and festivities of the
occasion. ''It is important that we involve the youngsters,'' she says,
''because if we don't continue to be aware of the importance of freedom,
how can we appreciate its worth?'' It is a sentiment that is widely
shared on these islands that trembled for five long years beneath the
jackboot.

The conflict was global, the memories are intensely
personal. Three veterans who experienced the horror
of battle and its aftermath talk to Vivian Rhodes
BILL'S STORY
WITH a glint in his eye, Bill MacMillan, ex-Black Watch, says: ''I
can't remember VE Day . . . I was drunk! I was in hospital in Cyprus,
wounded. I was only 23, but was there for six months. Once you were past
the depression stage, you just made the best of it. Both legs and my
right arm were damaged in action in North Africa.
''There was lots of dysentery in the desert. It was a filthy place.
Flies everywhere, especially if you were ill. It wasn't so bad for us,
further on in the campaign we could see an end to it.
''But there were minefields everywhere. So many of the injured were
the result of mines. When I was hit, it was two in the morning. I didn't
even realise I'd been hit. It felt like someone had just thrown a bucket
of ice at me. Then I realised.
''I really thought: 'This is it'. Luckily, a patrol of Seaforths were
out. It took two of them to carry me back.
''In the desert it is so quiet you can hear a pin drop, but funnily
enough that night I had an idea someone was out there. I thought I could
hear whispering . . . then, bang.
''I've often thought of writing a book, but it's too upsetting to
think about. We lost a lot of friends. The waiting was the worst part of
the fighting.
''Things go through your mind -- will I get through it? Then the sound
of maybe 800 guns at once. It's a terrifying experience.
''I often wonder how the war would have gone if El Alamein had gone
the other way.''
JIM'S STORY
AT 86, Jim Shields's memory is as sharp as ever. He served with 15th
Scottish Infantry Division, and his was a European war. He took part in
the Normandy landings before fighting through to north Germany.
He recalls that, after VE Day, only selected officers met in a marquee
and had ''a bit of a party''. But the notice to cease hostilities had
taken two days to get through and the retreat back to the demarcation
line and handing over to the Russians took two weeks.
There was great fear of the Russians, Jim says, and for good reason.
The Germans all wanted to be in the British zone. As British soldiers
withdrew through the villages to the demarcation line, parents were
begging them to take their children to safety.
''So we had no VE Day,'' says Jim.
''I was relieved. It had been a rough time. Ours was a breakthrough
division: we went in after the Paratroops and Commandos, with the 11th
Armoured. That was a fierce role.
''From D-Day to VE Day, 1600 were killed, 2000 missing, and 9000
wounded. The war films don't show the real war. Not the death; not
people being buried with just their dog-tags. The people back home
weren't well informed, really.''
How does he feel about the war now? ''We liberated a concentration
camp at Celle, on the way to Hanover. They were French Jews. We were
ordered to see this camp. Every officer. Our colonel was so angry at the
conditions. You see, they were starving. Maybe a thousand Jews. And this
was a small camp.
''The colonel ordered the nearby hospital to be emptied of all
moderately sick Germans, and as many of the Jews as possible were
treated.
''Local people said they hadn't known. I don't understand that. They
lined the street to watch as the sick were carried up to hospital by
stretcher. It was horrible.''
What about reconciliation?
''The German civilians were OK, the women and the children. They
hadn't done us any wrong. We used to give chocolate to the kids.''
When Jim got back to Glasgow, he was disillusioned. He had missed his
daughter's early childhood, and lost out on promotion at work.
''But it was worthwhile to stop what the Nazis were doing,'' he says
now.
SANDY'S STORY
ON VE Day, Sandy Hay from Aberdeen was in Calcutta, in the Navy. He
was painting the side of his ship when he heard the news. ''It was such
a release of tension that I threw my paintbrush in the water,'' he says.
''But they made me jump into Calcutta docks to get it back.''
They had all seen the end of the war coming, and now all talk turned
to going home. The worst part of Sandy's war was when he was on the
Middle East-Malta convoys. Italian torpedo bombers struck in the dark.
They hit the front magazines and 31 of Sandy's shipmates were killed. It
was New Year 1942-43.
The ship, an Avondale Hunt-class destroyer, came home stern-first to
prevent flooding. Sandy didn't come home right away: he was in hospital
with burns to both legs and was to be in plaster for four months --
under canvas, on the edge of the desert, billeted in Algiers then Iran,
then Stonehouse hospital in Lanarkshire. Then back to barracks to wait
for demob in 1946.
Sandy says now that he didn't feel brave. ''Your friends were
everything. You became very attached to them. You were a team. They were
your family,'' he says. ''I was a gunner, but it was just a job to be
done. You were just part of the ship.
''Fear? Yes, I felt fear. We were in the middle of the Mediterranean,
with Stukas dive-bombing us. We always seemed to be in action, but it
was part of our job to keep the German fleet in Taranto.''
Sandy returned to trawling in one of the biggest boats from Aberdeen,
the Star of Freedom. He also skippered an inter-island ferry in
Polynesia, and proudly wears a valuable tiki, a greenstone ancestral
charm presented to him by the Queen of Tonga in Auckland, New Zealand,
in 1950.
''My real regret about the war,'' he says, ''is the loss of time at
home. You miss so much when you are away.''

Weeds: These can be effectively tackled on a lawn with the excellent
range of weedkillers around.
Some, such as yarrow and daisies, may seem hard to control, and you
may need to use weedkiller several times to remove the more resistant
types.
Generally, you will have a lot fewer if you let mowings lie, provided
you don't have so many weeds you simply spread them around every time
you cut the grass.
This month, when it gets warmer, is an ideal time to use hormone-type
weedkillers. Beware of them drifting on to adjacent plants or into open
ventilators in greenhouses, as they can wreak havoc with tomatoes.
I like the idea of using combined feed-and-weed materials, as they
kill two birds with one stone. Little can be done about coarse grass
except slicing with a knife or complete removal.
Diseases: We are quite lucky in this part of the world that we don't
suffer too much from lawn diseases. Grass rotting is a typical trouble,
caused by overhanging shrubs, trees or excess wear.
The answer is to remove the overhang and reduce wear if practicable.
In some instances, inserting slabs into the lawn surface may be the
answer for a much-used path. Make sure that the slabbing is flush with
the surface.
There is the inevitable rust disease, which turns a proportion of the
plants yellow or rusty-looking. If you keep the grass growing
vigorously, rust should not be too much of a problem.
Drainage: Bad drainage can be due to a variety of reasons, such as
catchment of water from higher land, or heavy soil which has become hard
packed.
Some of the more vigorous grass plants do grow well in wet conditions,
but poor drainage will limit the use of the lawn. The answer is to get
some specialist advice. If the surface is greasy, it can be slippery and
dangerous. Algae can be controlled reasonably well with coarse sand on
the surface. At the same time, use some Armillatox according to
directions to kill it off.
Edges: You can get various edging materials, but regular trimming with
an edging iron, sharp spade or sharp edging shears should do the trick.
Flush-set paving alleviates this problem, but you will still have to
trim the grass that grows over the slabbing.
Finally, treat your lawn with a bit of respect. Give it adequate care
and attention and in most cases it will pay dividends. If you are really
stumped, don't be afraid to ask for advice.
Conditions may be so bad you could be advised to start again. This is
not so terrible a job as it sounds, as sowing or re-turfing can do it.

Wendy Jack reports on a Sterling chance to recall the style of our
yesterdays . . .
ONE look at the furniture on this page might prompt some readers to
feel that that the best thing to come out of the war years was not its
furniture but its true community spirit of neighbourliness and concern
which, sadly, has largely disappeared.
And yet there is no denying that beauty is in the beholder's eye and
that this kind of furniture was much loved by its own generation of
owners. Sometimes, therefore, it carries more meaning than the simple
appreciation (or not) of its lines.
In that spirit, at the gigantic Sterling Furniture Showrooms in
Tillicoultry, a poignant little display of history will be shown to
commemorate VE Day. A walnut bedroom suite, which was sold by the
chairman George Knowles senior's father at his Stirling furniture shop
just before the war, has come back into the possession of the Knowles
family. And it is in superb condition.
Sterling's sales manager John McGirr explains: ''The bedroom suite and
a dining suite had been bought by the parents of a former policeman in
this area. After his mother died last year, he and his sister were
clearing the house and selling the furniture. They noticed the word
'Knowles' chalked and varnished over the backs of the pieces, so he came
and asked if the family would be interested in acquiring the suites.
''They are in remarkable condition, and I think we may well use the
dining sideboard in the future as one of our display pieces. It wouldn't
surprise me if customers ask if the bedroom suite can be ordered -- it
looks great.''
Sterling will also create an air-raid shelter for its exhibition.

A drinks cabinet hints at the beginning of modern luxury, says PHILIP
STIRLING
DESPITE the relatively modern style of furniture, the austerity of the
war years is still much in evidence in the rooms of this 1944 house
(lounge far left; bathroom near left; and bedroom right).
Heat loss, draughts, and damp meant less-than-ideal conditions but in
some ways -- a drinks cabinet sits tucked in against the wall -- things
were looking up.
Casement windows with wooden sashes, standard lamp, tiled fireplace,
chunky sofa, and mirror hanging on the wall, all fix the house in time
-- before the advent of American-influenced plastic and vinyl products
which would sweep the home market in the sixties.
In the bathroom the simple but bold black and white tiled splashback
round the bath is in stark contrast to the many shapes, sizes and
colours of tile on offer today.
The heavy porcelain wash-hand basin, bath and toilet are also of their
time, with steel taps carrying only a limited supply of hot water. But
these products were built to last and can still be found in homes today.
* This house was featured as part of this year's Ideal Homes
Exhibition. Yesterday's Houses, Tomorrow's Homes was a taste of past and
present housing demonstrated in five homes representative of different
eras of the twentieth century.

IT IS all go at the moment. There is grass urgently needing to be cut,
edges needing a trim, hardy annuals needing sowing out to flower in
reasonable time. There are tomatoes to be planted in mildly heated
greenhouses, and ground to get ready for half-hardy bedding plants.
Then there are vegetables to sow, and plant out if you sowed brassicas
early, under protection.
The problem is knowing where to start. Whatever you do, don't panic.
Take things logically and sensibly. One job well done at a time, should
be the rule.
Otherwise, things can run away with you. Thankfully, the nights are
longer and the days are brighter. You can find time for some work at
night instead of slouching in front of the telly.
Back to tomatoes. Remember that they are tender plants and like a bit
of coddling to begin with.
Don't expect them to put up with near-frost at night. They greatly
resent cold, particularly if they have been brought up in a nice,
comfortable, warm atmosphere.
One of the problems in planting out tomatoes is support for plants
inclined to topple. The answer is to use bits of stick or split canes.
One or two per tomato plant will do, to keep them steady until they are
more robust, and prevent them from toppling over when watered.
It is also weed-killing time. Clean up paths with a contact
weed-killer, getting at all the odd corners where weeds can take over if
you let them.
Finally, remember that greenhouse watering and ventilation is a
priority. The sun can get very hot in May. All your efforts could come
to naught if things are allowed to dry out and scorch.
Leave the door open as you go off to work, if you are worried about
high temperatures. You may need to put up some kind of barrier, to keep
out rabbits, cats or other wandering animals.

SOMETHING I learned in 28 years as a horticultural adviser is that
overfeeding can be as bad as underfeeding plants.
Plants absorb nutrient requirements in dissolved form, through their
root hair system. This is because the stronger solution of nutrients in
the plant cell is capable of sucking in the weaker solution from the
soil or growing medium.
Plants can also absorb through their leaves, although there seems to
be a difference of opinion between botanists and physiologists on how
effective this is.
The whole process of absorption is dependent on concentration. Get
this wrong, and instead of the plant absorbing nutrient, the reverse
process takes place.
Commercial growers of crops such as tomatoes exploit this situation as
a means of controlling vigour. They have facilities for accurate
checking of nutrient concentration and they make sure things don't go
wrong.
In my experience, what happens with gardeners is that they think that
doubling up on fertiliser applications rates will double up on plant
growth.
You may get away with it on some occasions. In the main, you end up
burning or scorching the roots, with an immediate effect on leaves,
flowers and fruit.
A typical example is blossom end rot in tomatoes. While the
availability of calcium has a vital role to play in this malady, it
generally happens because plants, in growing bags in particular, are
intermittently short of moisture.
The bags are allowed to dry out, increasing the concentration of
available nutrients.
Instead of helping the plant, you are hindering it. If roots are badly
burned or damaged, their protective layer is no longer effective, and in
can come diseases.
I have examined countless cases of this, with tomatoes in particular.
The well-meaning gardener has dosed an ailing plant with extra
fertiliser. In fact, it does more harm than good.
Impatience is the main reason for overfeeding plants. The rule is to
feed little and often. This applies especially to liquid fertilisers.

. . . when brave spirits under headscarves made simple chairs and 'a
great atmosphere'
BLACK-OUT curtains, windows taped to protect families from splintered
glass, paper and gum for sealing cracks in floors and walls in case of
poison gas . . . the aesthetics of the home were the least of anyone's
worries in wartime Britain.
With resources at a premium, plain, functional utility furniture was
all that was manufactured. Most of the machines were manned by women,
their hair covered in forties-fashion headscarves worn like turbans.
At the original Milton Street factory of H Morris of Glasgow -- now
Morris Furniture -- the war years saw a very different expertise
develop. A handful of years before, the workforce had designed,
manufactured and installed all the furniture, fittings and fixtures for
the First Class lounges and accommodation for the Queen Mary and the
Queen Elizabeth.
Neil Morris, son of the founder, Harris Morris, swiftly changed the
direction of his company from cabinet-making to the production of rifle
butts and components for the Enfield Rifle (British forces' standard
issue).
In addition, there were stabiliser fins for barrage balloons,
assembled in the Kelvin Hall, and endless cordite trays and ammunition
boxes; many components and parts for the De Havilland Mosquito and a
range of utility furniture for the Ministry of Supply.
Thanks to Morris's skills and knowledge in lamination, the company won
the contract for the production of 25 ft helicopter blades with a
maximum width of two feet, with a finished accuracy of a quarter of an
ounce in weight. It was all a long way from furniture manufacture, but
quite invaluable.
Mrs Mary Trotter joined Morris in the summer of 1945, and still works
with the company at their new factory in Castlemilk. ''They were busy
making utility chairs when I joined, it was all women then. There was a
great atmosphere,'' she recalls, ''but there was no resentment when the
men came back and the women got moved about.
''A few men had stayed behind during the war. They set up the machines
and worked them. Just after the war, when the Queen married in 1947,
Morris's made a 14-piece bedroom suite as Glasgow's wedding present. It
was on display in the factory, and we all got two tickets to bring
family and friends along to see it, then you got your tea. It was
something to behold.''

Price wars?
What about
war prices?
Beverley
Brown
looks back
BRIGHTENING up your home for VE Day celebrations might have meant a
trip to the paint shop where gloss paint in seven shades cost 3/6d (18p)
a quart tin.
Oilbound distemper was the only alternative to wallpaper, in 16
shades, at 4/9d (24p) a tin. Larger projects might have included a new
fireplace; modern tiled fireplaces were selling in a Glasgow store for
#6.15s (#6.75) -- which was 10/- (50p) more than the average man's
weekly wage *. And an oak pipe rack to sit beside the fireplace cost
8/6d (43p).
If you were buying bedlinen, strong cotton pillowcases were 4/- (20p)
each, coloured rayon sheets 45/- (#2.25) per pair, bleached Union sheets
which were a rayon/cotton mix, at 65/6d (#3.27) a pair, feather pillows
cost 12/4d (62p) each and polished oak or mahogany bedside tables,
31/11d (#1.60) each.
Furniture came under the control of the Board of Trade and you
couldn't buy anything without a permit. Even if you did manage to
justify a permit, it was Utility . . . or nothing.
But if you were starting from scratch to furnish a home with Utility
furniture, here's what you would have paid for some essentials: a divan
bed #6.3s.9d (#6.18), bedsteads from #2.19s.6d (#2.98), dressing chest
#4.3s.9d (#4.19), with a mirror, #9.5s.3d (#9.26), kitchen table from
#2.14s (#2.70), dining chairs from #1.5s.6d (#1.28), baby's cot #2.9s.9d
(#2.49) and a bed settee, #13.4s (#13.20).
There were also very strict rules regarding rubbish, or more
specifically, what could not be put in the household bin. Nothing made
of glass was ever thrown out -- even lightbulbs were recycled. Paper was
recycled and manufactured into rifle cases and all food waste was
collected twice a week and used as animal feed.
Metal items were recycled, clothing and rags were uplifted. Esther
Turner of Partick remembers those years: ''Wallpaper was often in short
supply so we redecorated with distemper, but you had to be careful not
to rub against it because it came off on your clothes,'' she says.
''There were no fitted carpets either.
''If you were well off you had inlaid linoleum and some carpet squares
or rugs. But our most precious possessions were the birth certificates
and insurance policies -- kept in a case under the bed. When the
air-raid siren sounded, the case was the first thing you reached for and
everyone in the shelters used to say: 'Have you got the policies?' ''
Esther remembers washing days in the back-court wash-house, where you
had to light the boiler first. ''And the queues at the shops every
day,'' she adds. ''There were no fridges and some people kept food in a
metal meat safe on the window ledge but most, like me, just shopped
every day.''
Esther survived the Clydebank blitz but after two nights of continual
bombing, she and a friend took some blankets and slept out in the open
countryside (nowadays known as Drumchapel). ''It's funny now to think I
actually took my alarm clock to the fields that night so I wouldn't
sleep in for work.''
Some forties home-decorating ideas are back in vogue. Distemper looks
set for a revival, according to top interior designers, and sponging is
a current technique that many will remember from the war years -- when
it was used to create a pattern on distemper if wallpaper wasn't
available. Let's hope the latest distempers will adhere to the walls.

Ian Walls recalls what a lot it meant to grow your own veg.
WHEN war was declared, I was a lad working in Dobbie's seed shop in
George Square, Glasgow. At that time, it was one of the foremost seed
companies in Britain, with a warehouse and trial grounds at Portobello
Road, Edinburgh, its Dalkeith nurseries and its seed farm in Essex.
Like a lot of companies, when war was declared Dobbie's panicked and
most of the staff were made redundant. The company had not realised that
a war meant a boom in home production of food.
Within a few weeks, we were taken back on to the staff again. War
executive committees were urgently formed. This included agriculture and
horticulture under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture and
Fisheries for Scotland.
A major Dig for Victory campaign was launched, with posters everywhere
to encourage the nation to be as self-sufficient in food as possible.
Playing fields were ploughed up. Agriculture land under pasture was
ploughed for potatoes and other crops. Indeed, spare land everywhere,
including fringes of aerodromes, were brought into the scheme of things
for food production.
There were no ifs and buts about the campaign. If an area was to be
ploughed up, that was it. Machinery pools were formed.
Caught up in the need to grow food, I felt it was essential that I get
in on things and after inquiring about all the allotment areas that were
to be made available, I settled on a 300sq yd plot on what had been a
football pitch opposite the luxury flats at Anniesland.
Attending classes at the Agricultural College, I had had the basics of
vegetable growing instilled in me. Part and parcel of this was the
double digging technique, where you had to turn over the top spit of
soil and loosen up the lower spit.
This sounded fine in theory, but in practice it was a nightmare with
the plot I had been allocated. The ground was brick hard, compressed by
years of running feet.
Nevertheless, I persevered and the plot was eventually dug over. It is
amazing how soil expands when loosened.
With all the other allotments holders in the area busy digging, what
had been a relatively flat area was now a collection of raised beds.
During the process of digging, farmyard manure had been added in,
delivered by local farmers and barrowed laboriously to each plot.
My mother was a staunch ally in all this allotment activity. As we
were living in Hillhead at the time, the plot was reasonably convenient
by tram, although it meant a lot of humping.
What we were doing in Anniesland was happening everywhere, and the
country was literally a nation of gardeners. By the spring of 1940, all
the land ploughed or dug was ready for cropping.
Sales of vegetable seeds, seed potatoes and fertilisers to sustain the
crops were astronomical.
It would be wrong to say that flowers were forgotten but they
certainly were pushed into second place. A balanced fertiliser with a
7:7:7N:P:K analysis was launched, called National Growmore.
It was so popular that it has survived to the present day. Other
memories are Homeguard potatoes, selected because of their large
cropping ability, and still asked for a lot today.
Accurate statistics for the increase in food production are hard to
come by, but it was of a very high order. One reason was the fact that a
lot of new soil was broken in for vegetable production, and this
invariably gives a boost to yields.
My own plot proved to be very productive and the returns which started
to come in during the early summer of 1940 certainly kept our household
going well into the winter months.
There were potatoes, that were pitted, and winter brassicas including
swede turnips and sprouts, which were the mainstay.
From the outset of war, there were countless classes giving
information about vegetable production and how to do it. Without doubt,
many gardeners of the older school learned most of the ABCs of vegetable
production during the war years, provided they were at home.
I was called up to the Army in 1941 and my mother continued to operate
the plot during the years I was away, and gained the admiration of all
the plotholders still around.
She used to carry the vegetables back by tram, and often walked to the
Whittinghame Drive fare station to get the cheaper fare. When she got
home, it was up three stairs to a top flat in Kersland Street.
When I got back from the Forces, I found the allotment in excellent
condition and continued to crop it, in a rather desultory fashion, until
being up in horticultural education on a full-time basis.
Since then, I have grown vegetables in a variety of places while
flat-dwelling. This came to an end when I had half an acre in a garden
at my present home in Milngavie to keep me happy.
Vegetable growing is on the decline. Flower growing is on the
increase. Gardeners are looking for flowers and beauty, rather than food
for the stomach, which they can so readily get in great variety in
supermarkets. It would take a major emergency to bring gardeners back en
masse into vegetable growing.
However, allotment gardening is still very popular, albeit in many
instances under great pressure for land. Its value in suburban
situations is rising.
There is still a pretty healthy vegetable growing activity going on.
Long may it be so.

Although mowing lawns was not necessarily top priority in the war
years, gardeners still liked to keep things tidy and help to relieve the
worry of wartime events.
The Qualcast Panther 12in mower was launched in January 1939 and went
on to become Britain's most popular lawnmower.
Wartime gardeners also had to consider the cost. The Qualcast came in
at a heady #2 12s 3d.
Beside it is a more modern example, the 17in petrol-drive Atco
lawnmower of 1990.

IF you are looking for a horticultural treat, get down to Finlaystone
Estate, Langbank. You can't miss it, if you take the M8/A8 at Langbank,
by-pass the village, and go under the railway bridge. Look for the
entrance sign on your left.
This is an old-established estate, which was run on private garden
lines for many years and was for a while a garden centre.
The walled garden has been completely redesigned and its piece de
resistance is known as Judy's winter border, on the left as you go into
the walled garden. It hosts a wide range of shrubs and plants with
beautifully merging colours.
Look out also for the superb rhododendrons in full flower. There is a
shop where you can buy various mementoes, and a superb new tearoom where
you can sit outside and enjoy the sun in the walled garden.
Don't forget to take your notebook with you to jot down the names of
lots of interesting plants.

Could elegance mix with
austerity? Times were hard
in post-war Civvy Street,
but that didn't stop some
people making an art form
out of necessity, writes
Charles McKean
THE NUMBER of people returning from the war looking for things to
continue where they had left off in 1939 was roughly equal to the number
seeking radical change.
Which is probably why so many of the buildings put up before 1950 were
so similar to those of 1938. Although there were few of them. The
country had been well-nigh exhausted by the costs of war. Food
rationing, and the licensing of every building product, continued into
the early fifties. A special case had to be made for any building -- and
there was bomb damage to be dealt with, most significantly in Clydebank
and Paisley.
The first impulse was to return home and make do. But it was not an
easy time. Ex-soldiers and their families, with no houses to go to, took
to squatting.
What was happening was that the consensus that had bound the nation
together during the war began to crumble once it became obvious that
everyone was no longer in the same boat. There were quite a number of
different boats of different quality and different fittings. There were
those who relished the aesthetic of austerity. Others -- the countless
inhabitants of prefabs -- had no choice.
Taking its cue from wartime austerity, from prefabrication, timber,
metal and new types of laminates etc, there emerged Utility furniture,
which made an art form out of necessity. Bentwood, plywood, tubular
steel and later coverings of vinyl, laminates and fablon were what
people used to demonstrate that they were being contemporary, without
appearing too self-indulgent.
These items were almost invariably useful, but slightly on the edge of
utility: watch out, for example, for a Bentwood magazine rack,
spindly-legged chairs, trolleys, radios or the occasional television
set, as the principal items of decoration in a forties interior.
The forties house interiors show an increasing emphasis upon light.
Windows, particularly in the lounge, were moving towards picture windows
and, where possible, opened directly into the garden. Glass block was
often used to bring light into rooms or places which needed privacy. The
interior had to appear as uncluttered as possible, an elegant austerity
brushed by a certain self-indulgence.
The staircase sometimes rising out of the lounge would be both
open-tread and open-banister so that light could penetrate between.
There was a fondness for large square floor tiles or, if you were more
self-indulgent, smooth new carpets in light grey with a broad,
thin-lined check in red.
The (almost invariably wooden) furniture, with its spindly angled legs
would be placed firmly against the wall. Room dividers, which became so
fashionable in the late sixties and early seventies, took their bow: the
dining area divided from the living by open shelves with ornaments,
table lamps or plants.
Although central heating was becoming more common, most principal
rooms had their own fireplaces; generally long, low and horizontal,
quite frequently in brick or tiled concrete. Wealthier houses could have
parquet or sometimes cork-tiled floors.
There was a certain coldness in the house; partly a consequence of the
new materials -- plasterboard, fibreboard, linoleum, tiles, Vitrolite,
and some of the new paints: none of the cosiness we associate with
wall-to-wall carpeting and central heating of the seventies and
eighties.
The image of cool but stylish efficiency was conveyed by a plain floor
with the occasional rug, the open-tread staircase, the light, if
spartan, interior, and the integration with fresh air implied by the
spindly balconies, picture windows and minimalist portico.
The modern kitchen addressed the problem of middle-class kitchens
without maids. What we take for granted now was then thought pioneering:
a continuous draining board leading into a shallower metal sink,
cupboards below, wall cupboards above, spaces for the fridge, an ironing
board, appropriate places for storing food, crockery and pans.
In the somewhat straitened circumstances of the post-war period,
convenient small fridges and integrated cooking grills and ovens were
becoming available to Mr Average, and the kitchen became condensed into
a galley-kitchen adjacent to a dining area. That dining area led into
the lounge, perhaps only separated by a room divider.
Houses that could not rise to central heating tended to have hot water
supplied by geysers. Bathrooms were becoming simpler, more streamlined,
with less clutter, and were also becoming smaller and more square.
Basins on metal legs were giving way to those on pedestals, and coloured
sanitaryware was making its blushing debut.
It was still not highly recommended because: ''If you decide to have
coloured fittings, if you break one of the fittings, the chances are you
will not be able to get a new one which will be an exact match and
colour; and you may have difficulty in getting wall tiling to match.''
What a difference between the period of austerity and now.
Suburban gardens were much influenced by America, none of the lush
trisky colour fed by garden centres that we now have, with plenty of
clambering aubretia. Instead, easily maintainable greensward with a
strategically placed bush or tree. It was nature's spartan equivalent of
the austere interior.
Most people spent the 40s redecorating, making do as they could within
the limitations of building licensing. The style matched the times, the
times matched the dress, and the dress matched the attitude.
A brittle, quite hard and shiny period, with a tentative growth of
pastel colour, and an explosion of the new artificial materials. The
poor economy, however, kept the lid on things: until, at least, after
the Festival of Britain. Thereafter, everything was different.

THE Irish High Court yesterday permitted a family to let their
daughter die after lying in a coma for 20 years.
The woman has been in a close to ''permanent vegative state'' since
sustaining brain damage and suffering three heart attacks when
undergoing a minor operation at the age of 22.
Mr Justice Kevin Lynch ruled that artificial means of nourishment
should be withdrawn for the woman. He said it would then take her about
two weeks to die.
The judge added that withdrawal of the life support and the
termination were lawful, but put a three-week stay on his order to allow
time for consideration of an appeal.
The institution caring for the woman objected to any order terminating
her life as it would be contrary to its philosophy and code of ethics.
The judge authorised the woman's family to make arrangements for her
admission to an alternative institution.

THE policy-making body of the Association of University Teachers will
be asked this month to ratify a 2.7% pay rise negotiated by union
officials and university employers.
The AUT's general secretary, Mr David Treisman, described the deal,
which will add about 3.8% to the total pay bill after annual increments
are taken into account, as ''wholly justifiable''.
But he called for the establishment of a pay review body to free
university staff from the ''professional low-pay ghetto'' in which they
were trapped.
''The demand for a pay review body must be answered if our system is
to attract and keep the best staff and to boost their depressed
morale,'' he said.
The AUT, which represents about 30,000 lecturers, researchers, and
professional staff in the traditional universities and research
institutions, had lodged a 5% pay claim for 1995/6.
Mr Treisman said the claim had been realistic and modest, but he
accepted that some universities had received very small increases in
their grants from the Government.
It had been essential to ensure that academic and related staff did
not fall further behind the award made to English and Welsh teachers by
their independent pay review body.
The AUT deal was at a level awarded to these teachers, said Mr
Treisman.

A SCOTS heart surgeon said last night he had acted ''by the book'' in
an affair which has brought him under pressure from colleagues to quit
his post.
Mr Duncan Walker, credited with saving the lives of thousands of
children at Killingbeck Hospital in Leeds, has been told that patient
care is at risk because of the atmosphere he has created.
The alienation of Mr Walker's fellow doctors and surgeons followed an
investigation earlier this year into allegations that another heart
surgeon, Mr Unni Nair, had been bribed to move NHS patients up the
waiting list.
This was based on telephone conversations which Mr Walker had taped
and passed to the local health authority. Mr Nair was immediately
suspended and the police were called in, but after a three-month
investigation he was exonerated.
Mr Walker, 52, whose fund-raising for the hospital earned him the
title Yorkshireman of the Year in 1990, has been on sick leave since
February with septicaemia caused by a rose thorn which pricked his
finger.
''It was quite serious -- I nearly lost my hand -- but I have
scheduled my next clinic for the first week in June,'' he said.
Mr Walker alleges that a GP in Bradford offered Mr Nair #2500 over the
phone to admit a patient, in effect moving him up the waiting list.
''What he was asking was highly illegal. I taped the conversation and
my secretary took a shorthand note of a conversation he had with her. I
immediately took the advice of my legal advisers, the Medical and Dental
Defence Union of Scotland, and they advised me to hand the tape over to
the regional health authority's legal department, which I did.
Remarks in the tape about Mr Nair brought him into the frame, but he
was cleared after the investigation.
Mr Walker said: ''This matter isn't really about Unni Nair or Duncan
Walker -- Mr Nair is a good friend of mine and attended my birthday
party last year. It's about the fact that the health authority think
that, by shooting the messenger, they can sweep the message under the
carpet.''
Mr Walker attended a meeting last month of the Killingbeck Consultant
Staff Committee; his colleagues claimed his return would create
considerable tension in the hospital, which would make the running of
the operating theatre department particularly difficult.
As evidence of their loss of confidence, they cited the decline of
referrals of new patients to Mr Walker, once one of the busiest heart
surgeons in the country doing 20 operations a week. Now his waiting list
is 29 compared to Mr Nair's 174 and two other colleagues' 291 and 114.
The committee have asked the chief executive of the United Leeds
Teaching Hospital Trust to meet Mr Walker to consider his position, but
a spokesman for the trust said there would be no action until Mr Walker
returned from sick-leave. In the meantime, it had no comment.
Born in Uddingston, near Glasgow, Mr Walker has had a remarkable
career. He left school at 15 and served his apprenticeship as an
engineer in the shipyards. But on his uncle's advice he left heavy
engineering and went to study medicine at Glasgow University, where he
was on the students' union board with, among others, the late John
Smith.
He worked at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, Great Ormond Street in London,
and in Alabama before joining Killingbeck as a children's heart surgeon.
His pioneering surgery included reconstruction of a six-month-old
boy's heart using a pig heart and human donor tissue, and other
transplant firsts on young patients and on adults. He was credited with
phenomenal work sometimes running at 20 operations a week.
Mr Walker also became a celebrity because of his fund-raising work. He
mounted a campaign in the 1980s to raise #1m for the hospital's
paediatric intensive care unit.
''I have been here 20 years and worked my backside off,'' he said. ''I
have acted according to the instructions of the defence union -- I made
no accusations, I simply handed the tape over. It was the health
authority, not I, who called in the police. I am really disgusted at
what is happening now.''

THE driver of a 32-ton lorry was put in the frame for dangerous
driving at Haddington Sheriff Court yesterday -- by a photograph.
He was snapped overtaking a car at 71mph in a 60mph zone while his
vehicle was restricted to travelling at 40mph.
Shown in the opposite side of the carriageway is another car closing
head on.
David Culshaw, 40, was caught after police traced the woman car driver
snapped on a roadside speedwatch camera on the A1 near Dunbar, East
Lothian, last year.
She told them: ''I was very alarmed. It was lucky there was not a
serious accident.''
The manoeuvre cost Culshaw a #300 fine and a driving ban for a year.
He was also ordered to resit his test.
Culshaw, of Carcroft, Doncaster, Yorkshire, admitted driving
dangerously on the A1 Edinburgh-Newcastle Road, at Spott Burn on August
19, last year.
He admitted overtaking a car driven by Mrs Heather Joyce, of Findlay
Place, Mayfield, Dalkeith, Midlothian, at 71mph and when it was not safe
to do so, and causing her to brake to let him back to the right side of
the road.
Culshaw also admitted driving his lorry beyond its restricted speed of
40mph.
Depute procurator-fiscal Joan Arnott said the lorry had been detected
by the speedwatch camera.
Sheriff Jock Smith was shown two colour photographs taken half a
second apart just after 3pm on August 19.
Mrs Arnott said that after scanning the photographs police considered
that the lorry had been driving dangerously. They noted the registration
number of the car being overtaken and contacted Mrs Joyce.
She told police that she had been very alarmed at the way the lorry
overtook her car and had to brake hard to allow it back into its own
side of the road.
Mrs Joyce told police the lorry had cut right in and for several
moments its tail had been swinging back and forth across the road and on
to the grass verge, said the fiscal.
Defence solicitor, Mr Matt Rigg said his client, who travelled some
3000 miles a week, could not recall the incident.
Culshaw denied that the woman driver had been forced to make any
emergency stop or brake hard.
Mr Rigg said Culshaw had since given up as an HGV driver and hoped to
continue in work as a fork lift driver.
On the first charge Sheriff Scott fined Culshaw #300, banned him from
driving for one year, and ordered him to resit his test.
Culshaw was admonished for driving in excess of the speed restriction
on the lorry.

A PILOT accused of flying an aircraft wrecklessly yesterday denied
that he had endangered life.
Captain Robert Swainston, of Paisley, told a trial at Dumbarton
Sheriff Court that ''there was no chance of danger to anyone'' during an
incident in Rhu Narrows last year.
But three earlier witnesses agreed that Mr Swainston's Cessna 206 was
on collision course with a 28ft cabin cruiser.
Mr Robert McKenzie, 32, of Wemyss Bay, described how he saw flashing
lights some distance away from his vessel. He said he later realised
that it was a sea-plane and that it was heading straight for him.
He said: ''The plane was coming directly towards us at speed. I
immediately pulled back the throttle to stop the boat and veered to the
left.
''If I hadn't taken that action I wouldn't be here today. We would
have collided and there would have been a massive explosion.''
Mr Paul Edgar, of Gourock, who was also on the cruiser, said: ''I got
a real fright when I saw the plane coming towards us. It passed so close
overhead that I could have thrown a stone and hit it.''
Captain Swainston, a commercial pilot, had dropped a photographer at
Silver's Marine Yard on the Gairloch on the evening of May 20 last year.
He was accompanied by freelance pilot James McTaggart who was due to
take control of the sea-plane on take off from the loch.
However, Mr McTaggart saw the vessel in their path and became
concerned. He told the court: ''I had a doubt in my mind if we would
clear the boat or if we were on collision course.''
Captain Swainston, 43, denied that there had been a problem. He
insisted: ''Jim wasn't aware of the capability of the plane. It's able
to take off in a very short distance.''
He added: ''It's down to his inexperience. I've taken that plane on
over 2000 take-offs and landings and knew there was never any danger to
anyone.
''As for the guys on the boat, they were only shaken because of their
lack of knowledge of sea-planes. There was certainly no intent on my
part to alarm anyone.
''It's not in the interests of my business to do that.''
A police launch attended the the scene shortly after the incident, and
Captain Swainston was charged two days later at Cumbernauld Airfield.
The trial, before Sheriff Neil Douglas, was adjourned until Friday.

NURSING a troublesome verruca in the doctor's waiting room, I picked
up a copy of The Queen magazine of August, 1957. We all know that
doctors' and dentists' waiting rooms are great archives of the printed
word, but 1957 was a bit extreme. Or perhaps not, in view of the fact
that we all seem to be living in the forties this week.
On page 44 I read that ''great interest is being taken in Scottish
clan tartan carpets, and very attractive they can look in, say, entrance
halls, stairs or corridors. Those available today are the Ancient
Hunting Stewart, the Cameron, the Buchanan, the Royal Stewart and the
McPherson. Tartan carpets seem well suited to the simple lines of modern
furniture.''
I snorted in contempt. ''Trouble with the old hooter?'' asked the chap
next to me. No, I said: a snort of contempt differed from a snort
occasioned by inflammation of the mucous membrane. ''Tartan carpets?''
he offered, looking at my magazine. ''We had one fitted the other week.
This was after a TV programme saying that the interior patterns should
now be bolder, brighter, just like in the old days.''
I was about to say that tartan carpets were suitable only for rural
Highland hotels that couldn't find a buyer when the receptionist shouted
the name of the patient: ''Dress-Stewart.'' My neighbour got up.
''That's me,'' he said. As he limped out, I tried to imagine what his
entrance hall, stairs and corridors looked like, but my eyes glazed over
in the attempt.
Incredibly, the next magazine I picked up was My Home of June 1950,
price ninepence, and I turned to the queries pages of Our Furnishing
Expert. ''I have always wanted to have a room completely decorated in
blue,'' wrote a correspondent, name not given but a Rangers supporter
suspected, ''though I am told it would look chilly except in sunny
weather.'' The advice was to have light-blue walls with paintwork
enamelled to match, and to use glossy hydrangea-coloured curtains as a
warming contrast.
''Amazing,'' said the lady who'd taken the vacant seat next to me.
''That's exactly what we've done for the spring makeover. There's a
touch of hydrangea in the Rangers away strip and . . .''
''Mrs Ibrox!'' roared the receptionist. The lady said that was her,
and flounced away.
Here was a terrible lesson. The latest good taste is simply the old
taste reheated, after being bad taste on a 40-year cycle. I was about to
pick up another magazine -- Woman and Beauty of October, 1954 -- when
another patient hirpled in and took the seat next to me. So I hesitated.
''What's your name?'' I asked her bluntly. She looked at me as if I
were mad, which was possibly becoming true. ''Anne T Macassar,'' she
said. ''Why?''
''Nothing,'' I said, making an excuse and leaving. The Verruca would
have to wait. I'd learned enough for one day.

THE first version of today's much-coveted Aga cooker (see early ad,
left) first appeared on the market in 1924 and Britain's long, intense
affair with it did not take long to ignite. By the war years it had
become extremely popular and, after the war, its desirability just
seemed to grow among increasingly sophisticated kitchen-owners.
Developed in Sweden (?) by Gustav Dalen, it was based on a very simple
idea -- a massive metal solid fuel fire unit completely insulated by a
thick layer of heat retaining material, which could store heat and
radiate it.
Its economical running costs were one of the main reasons for its
popularity, though its early pledge to burn only one-and-a-half tons of
coal a year would not cut much ice these days.
A double-oven solid fuel stove like this one costs #4150 at today's
prices. In 1945 it would have cost just over #47.

BEFORE the war, refrigerators were viewed as an unnecessary luxury in
a Britain which appreciated warm beer and regarded ice as something to
be immediately thawed. Cool drinks were regarded as ''an American
mistake'' but, after the war, the US influence came on strong and the
sale of fridges -- like the Electrolux above -- suddenly took off and
never looked back.

How would today's pampered cooks cope with wartime food rationing,
wonders George Hume, when housewives performed miracles with a few basic
ingredients.
SPAM saved our bacon while we dug for victory, did brilliant things
with dried egg, and discovered the close-to-starvation wartime reality
of today's trendy call to be leaner and fitter. Then VE Day dawned and
it was time to hang out the flags. Which we did. And to celebrate . . .
which we wanted to. But with what? After five years of rationing the
cupboard was bare, the national stomach had long thought its throat was
cut, and excess was a word not widely recognised.
It was still the ''Phoney War'' when rationing was introduced on
January 8, 1940, but the curb on eating more than one's fair share was
very real. The ration per person per week varied from month to month and
items not originally restricted were added as the war progressed.
Groceries not on ration were put on a points system which varied
according to availability -- tinned fish and fruit, beans, and macaroni
became the very stuff of dreams. But we survived.
In addition to the basic ration pregnant women were given first choice
of oranges and bananas, a daily pint of milk, and the right to jump the
queue. Children up to five received the same ration as their pregnant
mums while the five-to-16s, although allowed extra fruit, were cut back
to just half a pint of milk daily. Vegetarians, heavy manual and
agricultural workers were allowed extra cheese.
The ration and no more was what you got and by the time victory was
ours there was very little -- apart from seasonal fruit, and for some
time bread -- that was not rationed. Four years after rationing began 11
shillings out of every pound spent on food went on rationed items. These
are the minima and maxima you would have been allowed to carry home each
week during the war years:
Meat: rationed by price rather than weight -- one shilling to
two-and-a-pennyworth; bacon: 4oz to 8oz; cheese: 1oz to 8oz; fat: 1oz to
8oz; eggs: half to two; tea: 2oz to 4oz; sugar: 8oz to 16oz; sweets: 3oz
to 4oz (including chocolate); dried milk: a quarter tin; dried eggs:
eighth of a packet.
Ah, the dried eggs -- a life-saver from our cousins across the
Atlantic. Over here for the duration -- albeit late arrivals --
overpaid, and allegedly oversexed, their waxed packets of dried egg came
with them. Small, rectangular, and hard as a brick, the packets of
powder laid as eggs in Maine and Minnesota, Tuscaloosa and Tucumcari
were khaki coloured: the stars and stripes of largesse and excess in
glorious colour. No matter that it was food with a difference -- first
and foremost it was food.
Dandelion leaves turned up on the table as salad and Potato Pete
became the country's propaganda tuber. Potatoes, unrationed, had the
ability -- surprise, surprise -- to fill every culinary need there was.
The delights of whalemeat attracted only small queues of hard-pressed
housewives and when it came to the hit parade a ubiquitous abomination
known as Woolton pie -- more guessing game than epicurean delight, given
that anything could be thrown in with the stern exception of meat --
never made it to number one. Hard times and empty shelves.
But how would we fare today with no more than two lamb chops a week to
fantasise about and cakes in which the cream filling owed more to the
root vegetable patch than the dairy meadow? Cooking and food
presentation have travelled light years since VE Day, set meals and
mealtimes have slipped, the youth of the nation now ''grazes'' through
the high street and shopping mall and money, or the lack thereof, is
today the only rationing factor. Time is of the essence and stocks --
fish, meat, or veg -- are as uncommon in the kitchen as the wooden
variety on the village green. If we tried to get by on the rations of VE
Day would we cope as well as, or better than, those veteran survivors
who tightened their belts to ensure that Hitler's Thousand-Year Reich
scarce made it past its first decade?
Brunton Smith, senior lecturer at Napier University Department of
Hospitality and Tourism, is too young at 47 to have suffered a working
knowledge of Woolton pie, but toasts the VE Day housewives for their
knowledge of how to wring the best from a few basic ingredients. Their
technique in spreading the flavour from a meat ration that would fit in
a gnat's eye would lead any late-twentieth-century fight for survival on
short commons, he says. But their skills would certainly have to be
relearned by a generation of household cooks whose familiarity with the
microwave has wooed them from the stock pot. ''Even chefs are losing the
art of reductions and stocks . . . Now it all comes out of a tub,'' he
says.
''Every time I boil vegetables I am amazed when I think of how many
folk throw away that lovely liquid from carrots and cabbage. In the war
years they knew about vegetable stocks and we have lost that. What the
wartime rationing and recipes smack of is moderation -- a more balanced
diet, in fact, than we have today,'' says Brunton Smith, chairman of the
Federation of Chefs Scotland, which is at present selecting and grooming
Scotland's team of chefs for the culinary Olympics in Berlin next year.
''Within 20 years diet and nutrition has turned full circle. Up to the
1980s the challenge was to make sure that everyone had adequate
nutrition. Now we are too affluent, too well off. It is not so much that
we are eating the wrong food but that we are eating too much of it. The
wartime diet was neither particularly healthy nor unhealthy, just
moderate -- and that was its strength.''
Brunton Smith also points out that 50 years ago -- before supermarkets
arrived with tomatoes, strawberries, and other short-season produce on
their shelves 365 days a year -- those who cooked had a knowledge of the
seasons of the year. ''They were not date-stamp controlled. They knew
what was in season and what was not. Now options have been brought in by
affluence -- even though they may be largely tasteless. Nowadays people
would not be dictated to by government as to what they might and might
not eat. In the war years there was just the diet on offer. It was a
question of conform or go without.''
According to Brunton Smith most people cooking nowadays find it easier
and simpler to join with the food producers and manufacturers in their
pursuit of the near-instant convenience food. ''Education is what is
needed to help people to steer themselves back to healthy eating'' . . .
a task not made easy, he claims, by virtue of the fact that Britain's
cooks are now ''clinically sterile in imagination thanks to the European
Union over-protecting the public''.
WOOLTON PIE
Described in wartime as an
''adaptable recipe''
METHOD: Dice and cook about one pound of each of the following in
salted water . . . potatoes, parsnips, cauliflower, swedes, carrots, and
turnips. Strain but keep three-quarters of a pint of the vegetable
water.
Arrange the vegetables in a large pie dish. Add a little vegetable
extract and about one ounce of rolled oats or oatmeal to the vegetable
liquid. Cook until thickened and pour over the vegetables. Add three to
four chopped spring onions.
Top with potato pastry or with mashed potatoes and a very little
grated cheese and heat in the centre of a moderately hot oven until
golden brown.

ALL 3000 of Aberdeen District Council staff will be invited to a giant
picnic in the Chris Anderson stadium later this summer. Families are
included in the #15,000 ''bash'', which will include games, music and
food, but no alcohol. Councillor David Clyne, chairman of the
contracting board, said the idea of an evening party for the contract
services division's 1900 staff had been scrapped in favour of a fun day
picnic for everyone.

Anne Forsyth remembers that, despite austerity rationing, there was a
wartime spirit of sharing, and that it was a red-letter day when she had
half a boiled egg.
HALF a boiled egg, a trifle topped with mock cream, a sponge cake made
with dried eggs, and ''a dumpling from Mother'' -- they were all special
treats during the years of the Second World War.
Recently I was looking through a collection of childhood letters my
sister and I sent to our father in the army during the war -- and there
are many references to food and special treats. I also found a scrapbook
of recipes cut from The Bulletin. Ask anyone over 60 if they remember
The Bulletin recipes and eyes will mist over in happy nostalgia.
''Remember Melting Moments? Or vanilla biscuits . . . ?''
The Bulletin, a pictorial daily paper published in Glasgow, was widely
read. Its cookery column, by Charlotte Cairns, was deservedly popular.
During the war and after, in years of austerity, The Bulletin helped its
readers to make the most of rationed and scarce ingredients.
In wartime Britain most people were quite well nourished. Careful
planning of the food-rationing scheme saw to that. But although everyone
had enough to eat, food was plain and dull, and mothers were hard put to
it to produce variety, let alone treats for celebration meals.
Butter, bacon, meat, eggs were among the basic foods rationed. Sweets
too -- we missed sweet things most of all. Jam was for special
occasions, and we weren't allowed margarine and jam on our bread.
Instead of jam we had rose-hip syrup, very runny and sticky, or malt,
ladled from large brown jars -- it had a quite revolting flavour.
Sweet shops showed appealing cardboard boxes of chocolates -- but
everyone knew they were empty.
''Points'' were coupons you saved for food extras such as biscuits. If
you went to a party and the hostess offered chocolate biscuits you felt
this was true hospitality, as she must have saved precious ''points''
for many weeks.
Our childhood letters to our father record some red-letter days when
special foods arrived.  ''We had a great treat today. Boiled eggs!!! We
had a half-egg each!'' No wonder such important pieces of news merited
exclamation marks.
In 1943 one letter records: ''Today the street is littered with
oranges.'' (I think the writer was carried away by the excitement.)
''Eighty-four million have been brought into the country (could this
really be true?) and children under 16 and over five get one pound so we
will get two pounds.''
Generally there was a great spirit of sharing, and those who had any
extras were generous about entertaining friends. We spent one memorable
Christmas Day with a family on a farm and the menu was recorded in a
letter to our father: ''We had chicken soup, chicken, potatoes, sprouts,
sausages. Dumpling (I got a button). Trifle with cream and sponge and
apple. Jelly (purple). Lemonade.''
Sometimes we would take the train to Glasgow to go to the pantomime at
the Alhambra, or to spend precious clothing coupons at Pettigrew and
Stephen or Copeland and Lye.
A favourite place for lunch or tea was Wendy's of West George Street,
one of the famous Glasgow tearooms, as popular with its patrons as Miss
Cranston's was. Wendy's was designed to look as if you were eating
outdoors. It had mock stone walls and mock gates, and there was a small
thatched cottage at the head of the stairs. There were nearly always
queues -- the tearoom was central, its food was fresh and as imaginative
as possible, and the waitresses in their flowered prints were cheerful
and pleasant.
''We went to Wendy's,'' says one letter. ''I had fish and chips and
jelly with a dollop of cream. There were two cats, a black and white,
who occupied the best armchairs in the place where you wait.''
But at home there were still special treats. The Bulletin was always
encouraging and optimistic.  ''Even after close on six wartime years we
have not lost our Scots domestic tradition of good baking,'' it told its
readers. ''Throughout this difficult period housewives have contrived to
keep up an attractive and appetising tea table.''
Ingredients were hard to find and there were many substitutes -- dried
eggs, dried milk, National flour, soya flour.
Many recipes include the words ''if available'' -- a special sponge
cake recipe uses dried eggs and is sandwiched with jam or mock cream,
and iced (''if sugar is available'').
The word ''mock'' crops up quite a lot in these recipes. ''Mock almond
fingers'', ''mock cream''. Mock cream was made with margarine, sugar,
and dried milk powder, and a little vanilla essence, and beaten ''till
thick and fluffy''. I remember it really was quite good, and well worth
the effort.
Marzipan had to be made from soya flour, margarine, sugar, and almond
essence, but The Bulletin still managed to produce imaginative recipes
for marzipan apples and potatoes and Easter eggs.
No wartime celebration would be complete without a dumpling. The
Bulletin gives a recipe for ''Mother's dumpling'' -- ''for a mother who
wishes to send a special birthday dumpling to her soldier son''.
The writer comments that ''there is unfortunately a strict veto
against enclosing foodstuffs in parcels dispatched to members of the
forces serving abroad. But nearer home, where the prohibition does not
apply, such 'dumpling from mother' would be a great treat for other lads
and their comrades.''
Most homes had something saved for special occasions -- maybe
carefully stored dried fruit, or biscuits bought with ''points''. And
most people tried to produce something extra to celebrate VE-Day.
In our house VE-Day was celebrated with a steamed chocolate pudding --
made with dried eggs, of course. It was a real treat and there was
plenty to allow for second helpings on this special day.
After dinner, happily replete, we children went with a group to the
town hall, where they were ringing the bells -- bells that had been
silent for six years of war. Under adult supervision, we were each
allowed to hold the rope for a second or two, to say we had helped to
ring the bells for peace.
A moment of history, and for me forever linked with steamed chocolate
pudding (doubtless made from a Bulletin recipe).

The demands of war seriously slowed down the building, buying and
selling of houses, writes Beverley Brown, but the market
still managed to limp along by selling safety features like
well-constructed garages
PRE-WAR homes may not have changed significantly over the past 50
years or so, but their value and the way that sales are transacted
certainly have.
At the start of the war in 1939, more than 6000 permanent homes were
built in Scotland by private builders. By 1945, this figure had slumped
to just over 100, as house-building was deliberately squeezed by the
Government to increase resources for war production.
Mactaggart &amp; Mickel Ltd was a prolific housebuilder in the years
preceding the war. Its advertising archives illustrate the rapidly
rising demand for estates in suburban areas such as Clarkston, Newton
Mearns and Orchard Park in Glasgow, and Davidson's Mains in Edinburgh,
as well as in Largs and Stevenston in Ayrshire.
The Silverknowes estate at Davidson's Mains consisted of bungalows and
villas of four and five apartments, with tiled kitchenette and bathroom,
at prices ranging from #775 to #830. Loans could be arranged for #50
down and weekly payments of 26s2d (#1.30).
Eye-catching advertising for Carolside Park in Clarkston said: ''There
isn't one good reason why you should pay rent . . . but here's a very
good reason why you shouldn't.'' These five-apartment semi-detached
villas boasted four coal fires, ample and spacious press accommodation
and brick porches, for #50 down and 28s10d per week (#1.44).
By 1940, some new homes were advertised at special pre-war prices. At
Orchard Park estate in Thornliebank, five-apartment semi-villas were a
snip at #725. But subtle changes had crept into the sales pitch.
Mactaggart &amp; Mickel's art deco flats in Sandringham Court, Whitecraigs,
switched from being ''the most luxurious flats in Scotland'' to flats
that allowed you to ''live in a safe area''.
This referred to the development's garages, which were ''so
constructed and in such a position that they form excellent ARP shelters
on the premises''.
Each flat contained three public rooms, three bedrooms, two bathrooms,
kitchen and maid's accommodation. Rents ranged from #200 to #225 a year
but were inclusive of central heating, hot water, window cleaning,
chimney sweeping and a uniformed porter.
''Going into the forties, Mactaggart &amp; Mickel was diverted from
house-building into the war effort, building air raid shelters and
strengthenings for oil tankers for example,'' says Iain Drysdale, the
company's developments manager.
''Colonel Andrew Mickel, the company founder, was in the Home Guard.
His son Douglas, who is now in his eighties, joined the Royal Engineers
and spent VE-Day repairing lines of communication in Italy. Immediately
after the war, when the company reformed, there was a timber shortage
and for a while our only option was to build steel houses,'' adds Iain.
There were no estate agents as we know them today, and only one
present company, Walker Fraser &amp; Steele, precedes the war years. Its
archives hold copies of a hardback Property Index for Glasgow and the
West of Scotland, which list house sales during the war years, giving
both the upset price and the price realised.
Actual or similar homes are on the market today, but at somewhat
different prices. A red sandstone terraced house in King's Park Road was
sold in 1944 for #800. Slater Hogg &amp; Howison currently have one for sale
at offers over #74,500. A bungalow in Thorn Road, Bearsden, sold in 1944
for #2000, and an identical home was recently marketed by Clyde Property
for offers over #225,000.
As the Property Index gave house names where they existed, it's
possible to match some homes from these records if the name has not been
changed. One recorded in 1944 was the sale of Greendykes, in Bridge of
Weir. A six-bedroomed Edwardian home, it sold for #5150 from an upset
price of #3500, and has only had one other owner since then. According
to Slater Hogg &amp; Howison, this home in the present market would achieve
in the region of #400,000.
Houses that were not sold by private bargain could be auctioned and
often achieved considerably over the upset price. Auctions were also
known as public roup and details were advertised in newspapers. One such
advertisement which appeared on 30 April, 1945, was for Eden Cottage in
Balfron, which sold by public roup for #860 from an upset price of #750.
In its resume of the property market in 1945, the Property Index says:
''The house shortage in Glasgow has reached alarming proportions and it
would appear that there is little or no chance of homes being provided
within a reasonable period for the thousands of men who are now
returning from the services.
''The problem is so acute that, if it is to be solved at all, it is
essential that the services and support of every possible agency be
invoked. In these circumstances, it is to be regretted that the policy
of the Government appears to rest upon the efforts of local authorities
alone, for informed opinion is that this task of building the 500,000
houses required in Scotland is too big a one for them by themselves.
''Returning men who have no homes and little chance of getting them,
can only hope that pressure of events will compel the Government to
create conditions under which private enterprise will be able to play a
part in building the homes so urgently required.''
House-building was back in business . . .

THE Rev Donald F M Macdonald, principal clerk to the General Assembly
of the Church of Scotland from 1972 to 1985, has died. He was 79.
The Kirk's press office said yesterday in a statement that Mr
Macdonald had brought a wealth of experience to his office. He was a
wise counsellor. There were those who had reason to be grateful to him
for his sound advice, humanity, and common sense in pastoral matters.
Mr Macdonald is remembered for editing the sixth edition of Practice
and Procedure in the Church of Scotland, the Kirk's guide book known
simply as ''Cox'' after a former principal clerk.
In 1981, he was appointed editor of volume 10 of Fasti Ecclesiae
Scoticanea (the succession of ministers in the Church of Scotland from
the Reformation).
Mr Macdonald was ordained and inducted to his first and only charge,
Glasford, in Hamilton presbytery, in 1948 and demitted his charge when
he became principal clerk.
He became presbytery clerk in 1964 and was appointed depute clerk to
the General Assembly in 1955.
Born in Glasgow, he was educated at Glasgow University and Trinity
College. His war service with the Scots Guards was cut short when he was
severely wounded in September 1940.
From 1945 to 1947 he served with the Allied Control Commission in
Germany and was involved with the rehabilitation of the prisoners from
the Belsen concentration camp.
In 1980, his services were recognised by the Queen when he received
the CBE.
Mr Macdonald is survived by his wife Anne, one son, and two daughters.

SCOTLAND's poor will receive their first benefit from the national
lottery in October when around #3m is distributed to charities.
The payout will be the initial tranche allocated by the National
Lottery Charities Board. It represents one quarter of the grant paid for
the Churchill archive, and 1% of the Government's estimated lottery
rake-off this year through the Treasury levy.
The charities board is the last of the five causes to get under way.
Mr Graham Bowie, who chairs its Scottish committee, defended the
delay: ''We could have come on faster and have been under pressure to do
so. However, we decided to consult extensively with the charitable and
voluntary sectors on our draft guidelines.''
He said the priority in the first #3m tranche of grants would be
towards projects alleviating poverty. Applications have to be in by
August. When fully operational the board will be disbursing #15m a year
in Scotland.
He added: ''We will concentrate on initiatives based on low income
communities, those working with low income families or individuals, and
other projects which will improve the social or physical environment of
poorer communities in Scotland.''
Mr Martin Sime, director of the Scottish Council for Voluntary
Organisations, said: ''The charities board has done a good job so far
and we are pleased that they have consulted and taken time to get it
right.
''We remain deeply unhappy with the lottery and its impact on
charities, but the board is not responsible for that.''
He questioned the distribution of lottery proceeds which gave 12p in
the pound to the Government, realising #300m this year, but less than
half of that to good causes. Charities were classed with sport, arts,
heritage, and the Millennium fund but were the only group whose income
had been hit.
''I think the Government should put some of its share back to the
charities,'' Mr Sime added.
* The Glasgow Central MP, Mr Mike Watson, called on the board to back
the Big Issue in the #300,000 expansion of its Glasgow headquarters.
''Helping the homeless and other needy groups is surely what the
national lottery should be about. What it shouldn't be about is lining
the pockets of well-off people like Tory MP Winston Churchill,'' he
said.
Meanwhile, Oxfam launched a programme to combat poverty in Britain but
denied that its new campaign would hit its work in the third world. The
rethink reflects growing unease among the charity's managers at what
they see as a widening gap between rich and poor in the UK.

IT was a day when everyone from the most senior members of the royal
family to the most humble members of the House of Commons staff bowed
their heads and remembered those who sacrificed their lives for the
freedom we now enjoy.
The Queen's appearance in Westminster Hall to commemorate the 50th
anniversary of the end of the Second World War in Europe marked the
start of what have been described as VE-Day celebrations, but inevitably
the event was tinged with sadness as the suffering and tragedy of the
war years were recalled.
As the band of the Scots Guards struck up the evocative tones of
Nimrod from Elgar's Enigma Variations, it was perceptible in the hall
that war veterans, their families, and those who had lost loved ones
were remembering the dark days.
Old men wept, elderly couples held hands, and children were held aloft
by grandparents anxious to make sure they knew the significance of the
ceremony taking place before them and did not forget. Passing on those
memories to future generations is an important task.
Politicians who could be described in more ways than one as old
soldiers -- Ted Heath, Jim Callaghan, Denis Healey, Tony Benn -- all
wore their medals with pride as the often petty squabbling of
Parliamentary warfare was exchanged for memories of what the real thing
is about. The national anthem was sung with gusto.
The commemorative programme for the occasion, at which both Houses of
Parliament presented addresses to the Queen, contained a vivid account
and pictures of how Parliament had suffered in time of war.
But there was a wider audience for yesterday's event, and that was not
forgotten. Pomp and circumstance is a distinctly British phenomenon and
it was laid on in spades yesterday, with the Queen, the Duke of
Edinburgh, Prince Charles, Princess Margaret, the Lord Chancellor,
Commons Speaker Betty Boothroyd, and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr
George Carey.
The supporting cast included the Prime Minister, Labour leader Tony
Blair, the Liberal Democrats' leader Paddy Ashdown, the Yeomen of the
Guard, and a host of senior clerks and attendants.
The chief guest, however, was memory, and all the members of the royal
family looked solemn as the Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay of Clashfern,
read the address from the House of Lords. Equal solemnity greeted the
Commons address from Ms Boothroyd.
The Lord Chancellor said: ''We recall with gratitude six years of
heroic effort and united steadfastness by the armed forces of the Crown,
by the Merchant Navy and by unarmed civilians, by the inhabitants of
these islands, by the Commonwealth and Empire, and by our allies.
''We recall those who fought with courage and endurance for the causes
of justice and freedom. We remember with sorrow and admiration those who
gave their lives.
''Since 1945 we have been blessed with a great measure of peace and
spared the horrors of world war. We have seen the collapse of
totalitarian regimes which for decades posed a threat to our continuing
freedom and the peace of the world.''
Ms Boothroyd expressed ''joy in commemorating the 50th anniversary of
the end of the Second World War and of the defeat of the forces of evil
which it brought'', but coupled this with thanks for the fortitude of
the men and women who served with the armed forces and a recognition of
the sacrifice made on behalf of future generations by those who died or
were disabled in their country's service.
The Queen told the hushed assembly of her own war experience, in which
she joined the ATS towards the end of the war where, she said, she had
''learned a little about driving and the workings of the combustion
engine, and much about the strength and happiness of comradeship''.
On more serious ground, she said: ''Together we thank God for the
victorious end to that titanic struggle of 50 years ago.
''In making these national acts of thanksgiving this weekend, and
again in August when we commemorate the end of the war in the Far East,
we must remember especially those who did not come back. It is to their
courage and heroic sacrifice that we owe our celebrations today. Let us
therefore offer a prayer for them and for the countless victims of Nazi
persecution.
''We salute with pride the valour of our armed forces who brought us
to victory. We remember the dark days of the Battle of Britain, when the
pilots of the Royal Air Force fought in our skies to protect us from
invasion. We remember when we stood alone in Europe -- saved from
starvation by the valour of the Royal Navy and of the merchant service
in the Battle of the Atlantic.
''And we remember the better and brighter days later in the war when
our armies, re-invigorated and re-armed after the retreat from Dunkirk,
were able to go on the offensive, first in North Africa, later in the
Far East, and finally in the triumphant invasion of Europe.''
Looking to the future, the Queen said that although there had been
armed conflict, we had been blessed with 50 years without the scourge of
a world war. ''Today, the development of the European Union has rendered
the possibility of a major war in Europe even more remote, but in spite
of these mercies there are, in our world, troubles and challenges to
daunt even the bravest spirit,'' she said.
''We must not falter, hard though the going may sometimes be. Let us
pledge that the sacrifices made in the war which ended 50 years ago
should, under the providence of Almighty God, achieve all they deserved
-- a lasting peace founded on justice, freedom, and parliamentary
government.''
Before a one minute's silence, the Speaker's Chaplain, the Rev Canon D
C Gray, said: ''Let us remember those who were wounded in the fight.
Those who perished in air raids at home, those who fell in battle and
are buried at sea or in some corner of a foreign field, and especially
those whom we have known and loved, whose place is forever in our
hearts.''
After the silence, the Archbishop of Canterbury said: ''Bless those in
authority in every land, and give them wisdom to know, and courage to
do, what is right. Encourage those who work for peace, who strive to
improve international relations, who seek new ways of reconciling people
of different race, colour, and creed.''
On with the street parties, but Amen to that.

A NORTH-EAST farmer yesterday admitted allowing dead sheep to remain
unburied on his farm. Charles Anderson, 48, of Cuslachie, Towie, Gordon,
appeared at Aberdeen Sheriff Court and admitted contravening the 1906
Dogs Act at Upperton, Glenbucket, last July by permitting the carcasses
of sheep belonging to him to remain unburied. The Crown accepted his not
guilty plea to a separate charge alleging he contravened the
Agricultural Act, being the owner of a flock of sheep, by failing to
provide an adequate water supply, causing sheep unnecessary suffering.
Depute Fiscal Mrs Sandra McRobert told the court the offence came to
light last July when persons using a nearby Heritage Trust saw several
sheep carcasses in various states of decomposition. Police called to the
scene found the carcasses of seven ewes and lambs lying unburied.
Defence Agent Mr Peter Littlejohn said his client ''was a diligent
hard working farmer.'' Mr Littlejohn also said ''there was no question
of cruelty or lack of care.''
Defence agent Mr Peter Littlejohn said the time of the incident was a
busy month for Anderson who had a lot to attend to and had not got round
to burying the sheep, whose deaths were outwith his control. Noting that
there had been ''substantial mitigating circumstances'' in the case,
Sheriff Peter Hamilton granted Anderson an absolute discharge.

A TELEVISION producer last night denied an allegation that a Celtic
supporters' club had been dropped from a documentary because its
comments had not been as provocative as those made by Rangers fans for
the same film.
Mr Alan Clements, a Glasgow-based independent producer, described the
claim by the Manchester-based Anti-Fascist Action group before
tomorrow's Old Firm match as ''a deliberate attempt to stir up trouble
to meet the group's own political ends''.
Wark and Clements, run by Mr Clements and his wife, BBC presenter
Kirsty Wark, invited supporters' clubs from Celtic and Rangers to take
part in a 15-minute pilot earlier this year with a view to securing a
commission from Channel 4 for an hour-long documentary on the religious
beliefs of people in the West of Scotland.
The action group, which claims to represent Celtic Anti-Fascists, has
urged Celtic supporters not to talk to production crews who will also be
filming before and after tomorrow's game.
The pilot went ahead after agreement was reached with the Sons of
Donegal Celtic Supporters' Club, based in the Queens Park Bar, Glasgow,
and the Jimmy Clark Rangers Supporters' Club, based in the Louden
Tavern, in Dennistoun.
However, a fax released yesterday by the anti-fascist group said:
''The views of the Celtic fans, in particular, completely transcended
the irrational bigotry and intolerance of the Rangers supporters who
were interviewed.
''Unfortunately the Wark/Clements team decided that the views
expressed by the Celtic fans were not provocative enough and attempted
to get a similarly balanced response in order to provide some sort of
'balance' to the film. When these were not forthcoming they asked to be
introduced to other fans.''
The group claimed one Rangers supporter interviewed, who had KKK
tattoos, said: ''I don't like Roman Catholics because they are disloyal
to Queen and country.''
Mr Clements confirmed the Celtic supporters' club in question would
not be used in the main documentary. However, he strongly rejected
allegations that the club had been dropped because they were ''not
provocative enough'' in order to secure a ''more bigoted response'' from
another set of fans.
He said: ''We told them we were looking for a pub that was more visual
than the Queens Park Bar -- one which had sporting memorabilia and
iconography.''
He said they were now working with another group of Celtic fans.
No-one was available for comment at the group's Manchester
headquarters last night.
However, Mr Paddy Kelly, 24, a member of the Sons of Donegal Celtic
Supporters' Club, said last night that many of his club members agreed
with the sentiments expressed in the fax.
Mr Robert Marshall, manager of the Louden Tavern, said it was ''a
nonsense to suggest that we have hard-line fascists drinking here. The
Rangers supporter referred to who had the KKK tatoos is not a regular''.
The documentary is to be shown in the autumn as part of a series of
religious programmes for the Witness series on Channel 4.

BUYING a big house in the country can be a daunting prospect, even for
the wealthy, writes STEWART McINTOSH. However, if the house comes with
the chance of developing some sort of business from the premises, then
it can come within the scope of a much wider range of purchaser.
Contin House in Ross-shire is a good example of the type. The
impressive restored country house dates back to 1794 and was used until
1986 as an important manse in the area.
The agent says the rooms are all of good proportions and in good
decorative order. Accommodation includes drawing room, sitting room, and
five bedrooms -- all with en-suite bathrooms. The second-floor attic
provides a great deal of storage space.
The property comes with a separate modernised stone and slate
three-room cottage, which has direct access to the walled garden.
Traditionally, Scottish rural manses came with their own glebe -- a
parcel of land on which the minister could grow food for himself and his
family. Contin House comes with traditional U-plan glebe steading, which
Paul Jackson (of agents Langley-Taylor) says has ''tremendous scope''
for alteration, possibly for use as a letting business -- subject to
planning consent.
The garden and grounds surrounding Contin House extend to around 1.65
acres.
Contin lies within easy driving distance of both the east and west
coasts, amid some of the most spectacular and beautiful scenery in the
country.
Sporting activities include fishing, shooting, stalking, walking and
ski-ing as well as golf. The famous Royal Dornoch links are within easy
reach. There are also several distilleries and magnificent castles close
by.
The local villages of Contin and Strathpeffer provide for most daily
needs, while Inverness offers a wider range of shops, recreational
facilities and amenities.
Langley-Taylor is seeking offers over #290,000 for Contin House.

THE needs of people with learning difficulties must be addressed in
community care policies drawn up by the new unitary authorities,
campaigners for the mentally handicapped warned yesterday.
The director of ENABLE (formerly the Scottish Society for the Mentally
Handicapped), Mr Norman Dunning, said the charity was anxious that the
new councils were aware of the implications, for service provision, of
moving people out of hospitals.
Community services must be in place before people moved out of
hospital he stressed.
ENABLE members had very real fears that people with learning
disabilities would lose out on services because of changes to council
boundaries. At present many services on which they relied were offered
by regional councils.
For example in Helensburgh, which is to become part of Argyll and
Bute, people have been receiving services in Dunbartonshire, which will
become part of Dumbarton and Clydebank.
His concern was whether, in future, they would have to travel miles to
an adult training centre in Lochgilphead.
''Councillors will be making decisions which will have far reaching
effects on the lives of people with learning disabilities. ENABLE wants
to ensure that they have all the information they need to make such
decisions,''said Mr Dunning.
As a result the organisation is sending out information leaflets to
all 1161 councillors elected to the new single-tier councils outlining
the importance of council services to people with learning disabilities
and their families.

MARGARET HUGHES VISITS A SEASIDE CAFE WHICH REMAINED OPEN THROUGHOUT
THE HOSTILITIES AND CONTINUED TO MAKE ICE CREAM.
THE rationing which hit homes throughout Britain also caused chaos in
commercial kitchens. Yet, despite the difficulties, there were cafes,
restaurants, and tea-rooms that continued to operate during these
difficult times.
The Nardini family opened its stylish ice-cream emporium on the
waterfront at Largs in 1934 -- and proudly states that it stayed open
during the war years, albeit with a limited menu.
Pete Nardini, a director of the company, was only a child during the
war, but remembers that, as far as possible, it was business as usual.
''Much of the complex was taken over by the War Office and used as a
commando billet, but we were still able to continue running a limited
operation.
''However, what we sold very much depended on what was available.
Mostly it was corned-beef sandwiches, condensed milk for tea, digestive
biscuits and margarine instead of the butter.
''We were fortunate enough to receive supplies from local farms. This
was because some of the girls who worked as waitresses became land-girls
and were able to bring in fresh produce.''
Nowadays, a trip to Largs is not complete without a visit to Nardini's.
During the war years customers rarely got the opportunity to sample the
family's famed ice-creams. Nardini explains: ''The basic constituents of
ice-cream are milk, butter, sugar, and eggs. Unfortunately these were in
short supply. However, we did occasionally get the opportunity to make
ice-cream.''
Nardini is too young to remember exactly how VE Day was celebrated in
1945, but he believes it is worth commemorating 50 years on. ''We still
have customers today who were customers 50 years ago, and we have had
several people inquire how we we are going to celebrate the V E Day
anniversary,'' he comments.
Some wartime favourites will be included on the menu. Nardini says:
''We will be running a series of special menus over the V E Day
celebration weekend. While they will be nostalgic in as much as they
will include corned beef and Spam, they will be served in a much more
modern way.''
Fifty years on from VE Day, corned beef and Spam do not regularly
appear on Nardini's menu, but the restaurant does offer a wide range of
pasta, fish, steaks, and vegetarian meals.
A visit to Nardini's is a trip back in time. The 1930s decor, the
leatherette booths and lily-shaped lamp shades all conspire to make you
feel sentimental for the days when life was simpler.
The restaurant is more ordered than the cafe. Light floods in through
the large windows. Uniform rows of tables with starched, white linen
cloths are set with silverware. Waiters in white coats show you to your
table. A menu board details the local catch -- lobster, crayfish, lemon
sole, and monkfish.
No sooner had I sat down and ordered, than I was served my starter of
chicken broth. Serving it with a small silver ladle, the waiter deftly
poured the soup into a plate. The soup had a good chicken flavour,
teamed up with the vegetables, carrots, peas, and potatoes. The rice and
barley gave it a crunchy texture. On a cold day it was a good way to
start the meal.
The main-course choice is very large. The more commonplace dishes such
as sirloin steak and lasagne al forno sit alongside the restaurant's
specialities. These have wonderfully appetising names, including
''fracosta al pizzaiola'', which is sirloin steak cooked in a tomato,
oregano, and red-wine sauce, while ''petto di tacchino alla Nardini'' is
turkey breast rolled with cream cheese and boiled ham, and cooked in
butter and cream.
I decided to go for something simple, and save the butter and cream
for dessert. I chose penne served in a napolitaine sauce. The chunky
tomato and basil sauce was sprinkled with fresh basil and had a hint of
garlic. It was a huge portion and was filling, fresh, and very tasty.
To accompany it, I was served a basket of fresh garlic bread. This was
outstanding, as much for the quality as for the price -- only #1.60 for
five huge slices. In most restaurants you can expect to pay this for one
slice.
Dessert had to include ice-cream. This is available in a variety of
guises. There are sundaes, knickerbocker glories, and ice-cream
accompaniments to all manner of cream cakes and gateaux. Choosing one
flavour from a myriad that includes everything from vanilla to Turkish
delight is difficult. To make your decision easier, and your journey to
Nardini's really worthwhile, ''Misto'' is the dessert to choose.
Literally meaning ''mix'', this is five scoops of home-made Italian
dairy ice-cream served in a waffle cone. The choice of flavours depends
on what is available. I ended up with strawberry, pistachio, coconut,
peach, and chocolate. It was tremendous. Despite being crammed into the
cone, each of the flavours came across well. The peach was probably my
favourite. It contained small pieces of fruit, which added to the
flavour. The most vibrant was the green pistachio. By far the sweetest
was the strawberry, while the chocolate had a rich smoothness.
Again this was very good value for money. At only #2.50 it was very
cheap. Bearing in mind that a single-scoop ice-cream cone costs 65p in
the small takeway cafe, I felt the treat was also a bargain.
The service was inconsistent. I was served my soup immediately, yet
had to wait a long time for my main course. I took comfort from
believing this meant the food was being freshly prepared.
Of course, eating at Nardini's does not need to be as formal as dinner
in the restaurant. An ice-cream float in the cafe overlooking the beach
is just as enjoyable.
The real appeal of Nardini's is not just its ice-cream, it is the
whole package. The nostalgic atmosphere created by the decor. The view
from the windows as you take shelter from another west of Scotland
downpour. It is both the memories of good times gone past, and the
promise of brighter times, and more flavours, ahead.
* Nardini's is open seven days. Breakfast is served from 8.30am, lunch
from 12 noon, high tea from 3pm, and dinner from 8pm. A three-course
business lunch in the restaurant is #5.50. Dinner from the a la carte
menu costs around #15 for three courses. The cafe operates a separate
menu which includes sandwiches, salads, pizza, and a variety of
ice-cream desserts and drinks. The cafe is also open from 8.30am until
around 10pm. For further information contact, Nardini's, Esplanade,

LADY CLAIRE MACDONALD, A HOTELIER FROM THE ISLAND OF SKYE, COMMENDS
THE INVENTIVENESS SHOWN DESPITE SHORTAGES OF THE MOST BASIC SUPPLIES,
AND OFFERS A TEMPTING RECIPE USING THOSE AVAILABLE.
I WAS lucky enough not to be born until three years after the end of
the Second World War but I had read about rationing, of course, and
imagined I knew and understood what it had been like. It was only when I
saw, laid out on plates at the Imperial War Museum in London, what each
person's weekly rations looked like that I began to wonder how on earth
women managed to feed their families for the long war years. In these
days of such lavish plenty it is almost impossible for us to understand
how people lived when their weekly butter ration was less than what some
people eat on their toast in one breakfast.
We eat such vast amounts these days. The comparison between now and
the years of rationing is almost embarrassing. Most difficult perhaps
was the lack of variety in food. People who lived in the country were so
much better off for food than city dwellers. They had gardens and could
grow their own fruit and vegetables. They could keep hens, and have a
greater supply of eggs than rationing permitted -- one shell egg per
person per week was the ration; even dried eggs were rationed.
My mother, who was a Wren during the war, tells me that when she was
home on leave (I come from the depths of what was then rural
Westmoreland) she always went to stay with friends, taking a couple of
onions and a dead rabbit as a present. Onions used to be scarce. Yet I
can't think of a single thing I use with greater effect to make savoury
food more interesting than onions. For country dwellers there was game,
fish, rabbits, and hares, all to add variety to the meagre weekly
rations.
My mother told me how my grandmother belonged to an organisation whose
members offered a place in their homes to servicemen from overseas
during their leaves -- those, that is, who didn't seek the bright lights
of cities. One of these visitors shot a swan. This was and still is
illegal -- all swans belong to the reigning monarch -- but it was cooked
and eaten and, as you might imagine, it fed quite a number.
One meat item which wasn't rationed, except very occasionally, was
offal. As a family we would have been fine on a weekly diet of liver and
kidneys. But one day last year I was interested to read a letter from a
doctor in the Times. Its content contradicted the popular belief that
the wartime diet was healthy, and that people thrived on it. There is no
doubt that its lack of fat and sugar was much healthier than the amounts
of both we consume these days, but the writer remembered people looking
grey and tired (not surprising with nights disturbed by the Blitz, quite
apart from the lack of food), had a feeling of perpetual emptiness, not
exactly hunger, he said, but that of never having had sufficient to eat.
He said it was lack of protein in the diet which was the cause. When you
think that the weekly rations per person for butter and cheese were just
2oz of each per person, it's not hard to believe.
On that visit to the Imperial War Museum I bought We'll Eat Again by
Margeurite Patten. It is fascinating to read all the hints and tips
about how to eke out the rations to get the maximum nutritional value
from the food available. I constantly marvel at how the housewives
coped. There are so many recipes with the word ''mock'' as a prefix --
mock crab, mock duck, mock apricot, mock marzipan, mock cream.
There is a chapter on preserving foods. In this day and age for most
of us preserving means putting brambles, raspberries, currants, and
gooseberries into polythene bags, sealing them and putting them into the
freezer. To read of the more lengthy process of sterilising jars and so
on necessary for bottling fruits and vegetables is very humbling.
The following recipe is supposed to feed four. I would advise you to
use an extra half-pound of corned beef. It is very good, but even better
if you saute an onion, skinned and chopped, with the sliced leek before
adding them to the corned beef and beans in the ovenproof dish. This is
cheating but it makes a wartime recipe into a very good present-day
dish.
HARICOT BEEF
Serves 4
8 oz haricot beans, soaked for 24 hours then simmered gently for 1
hour
1 lb corned beef
1 small cabbage, finely shredded
1 leek, washed and chopped
pepper
salt
2 teaspoons mustard powder
[1/2] pint vegetable stock and 1 tablespoon gravy thickener (I think
this must mean Bisto. These days we could use gravy granules or similar)
Drain the cooked beans. Put the beans, chopped corned beef, cabbage,
and chopped leek in layers in an ovenproof dish. Season with salt and
pepper. Stir together the mustard and  gravy thickening stock, and pour
into the dish. Cover, and cook in a slow oven (I would say 300[DEG]F,
gas mark 315[DEG]C) for 1 hour.

DOUNREAY will reprocess more nuclear fuel in the five years from 1994
to 1999 than it did in the first 33 years of its existence, an Atomic
Energy Authority spokesman said yesterday.
The confirmation came as it was admitted that a worker involved in
reprocessing was contaminated by highly radioactive plutonium dust at
the Caithness plant last Saturday.
Between 1958 and 1991 the total was 28.8 tonnes of irradiated fuel
reprocessed, but between 1994 and 1999 30 tonnes will go through the
process.
The spokesman stressed, however, that the greatly increased activity
would not prejudice safety at the plant.
The dramatic increase has been due to the closure of Dounreay's
prototype fast reactor and the removal of 30 tonnes of core and breeder
fuel for reprocessing. In addition there are 1000 fuel elements from the
earlier fast reactor.
The news is bound to raise questions over the controversial
reprocessing activity at the plant and whether it is necessary.
Dounreay's director Mr John Baxter defended reprocessing at the recent
meeting of the local liaison committee: ''Our response is that this is
the best way to get the radioactive waste in the fuel into a standard
form which can be replaced in a repository.''
Anti-nuclear campaigner Mrs Lorraine Mann does not accept this: ''I
don't think there is anybody outwith the nuclear industry who believes
that. Reprocessing is entirely unnecessary.
''What is particularly worrying is that now we have an aged plant
running at full tilt reprocessing when in the past it only ever ran at
10% capacity. When a plant is as old as Dounreay there are bound to be
incidents, as we have seen over the past few weeks.''
The Dounreay spokesman admitted yesterday that one of two workers was
contaminated by an escape of highly radioactive plutonium dust.
Both the affected man and his colleague are now undergoing an
extensive monitoring programme by health specialists at the plant.
The spokesman confirmed that one male worker was contaminated on the
hand by the dust of the man-made metal.
The alarms went off last Saturday when the dust escaped from a
''glove-box'' in a neighbouring building to the main reprocessing hall,
codenamed D 1206.
It has been shut down pending the results of three separate inquiries
following a serious plutonium-release incident in February, when three
reprocessing workers were contaminated.

IT will be the least spontaneous party on record and the largest
gathering of heads of state in the UK since the Coronation.
The logistics might suggest security headaches, but Prime Minister
John Major insists the three-day VE-Day celebrations, centred on London
and which get under way this morning, are going to be a huge success.
Veterans of the Second World War and families are invited to the party
in Hyde Park this weekend as the nation celebrates the fiftieth
anniversary of the end of hostilities in Europe.
The Prime Minister is looking forward to a strong family theme to the
events.
However, it was obvious last night that the official VE-Day events
focused on London were being heavily orchestrated in favour of
television companies, who have got the best seats, and politicians who
hope to bask in the glory.
Scotland will play little part in the VE-Day party in London. There
will be pipers and Scottish country dancers on stage in Hyde Park and a
ceremony surrounding a flame of peace carried from Edinburgh to London.
The Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland will
also take part in the national service in St Paul's. Otherwise there
will be no great presence from north of the Border.
For security forces it will be a busy weekend. At the last count 54
countries were sending leaders -- 39 of them heads of state.

A PET dog was yesterday under suspicion of unwittingly killing its
mistress in a freak accident.
Fifty-year-old farmer's wife Bridget MacGillivray died when her
stationary all-terrain vehicle, left with the engine running, suddenly
slammed back as she unloaded sheep feed from the rear. She was pinned
against the interior wall of a barn at Davochfin Farm, Dornoch in
Sutherland.
Police think her collie, Duke, may have leapt into the vehicle and
accidentally touched one of the control levers, throwing the ATV into
reverse.
The discovery of the mother-of-two, dead from head injuries, was made
by a part-time female worker on the farm. She summoned help from Mr Don
Greenberg, an American golfer working at the Carnegie club at Peter de
Savary's Skibo Castle, but nothing could be done.
Police have been seeking the cause of the accident all week.
The dog was used to travelling with his mistress in the cab of the
golf-buggy-style ''Mule'' ATV.
A police spokesman at Dornoch said yesterday: ''We are investigating
the possibility the dog caused the accident but we'll never know for
sure.''
If so, the accident would be a carbon copy of one a few years ago near
Spean Bridge which was the subject of a fatal accident inquiry at Fort
William.
Then a digger driver died after being crushed by the bucket of his JCB
as he worked outside the cab on a trailer puncture. His lively dog left
in the cab is thought to have knocked against one of the operating
levers.
Mrs MacGillivray also ran the Dornoch Lochans angling ponds with her
husband Malcolm. Her son Angus, 25, a Black Watch officer serving in
Northern Ireland, and daughter Claire, 28, who works in London, have
returned home for the funeral on Monday.

THE terms of the continuing debate about Europe's descent into
self-destruction in 1939 were largely set by A J P Taylor, The Origins
of the Second World War; he saw it all as a chapter of accidents rather
than the outcome of fiendish calculation by Adolf Hitler. Every
subsequent author has had to grapple with this thesis, notably Keith
Robbins, Munich 1938, and Richard Overy, The Road to War. Martin
Gilbert, The Roots of Appeasement, thoroughly examines the context of
contemporary British politics.
The official history of the Second World War, published by HMSO, has
recently been completed. The most outstanding contributions come in
parts three, four, and five of Grand Strategy, respectively by J R M
Butler and M A Gwyer, Michael Howard, and John Ehrman, as well as in L F
Ellis, Victory in the West, two volumes. The conclusion of the series, F
H Hinsley, British Intelligence in the Second World War, three volumes,
proved especially fascinating, being based entirely on hitherto secret
documents. Several major reinterpretations of the whole conflict have
been possible now that everything of value from the British archives is
in the public domain: John Keegan, The Second World War; Martin Gilbert,
The Second World War; Philip Warner, World War Two, the Untold Story;
and H P Willmott, The Great Crusade.
Britain's home front has been superlatively served, first by Angus
Calder's evocative The People's War, which he followed up with The Myth
of the Blitz. Paul Addison, The Road to 1945, traces in the conditions
of war the origins of the post-war world. Kevin Jefferys, The Churchill
Coalition and Wartime Politics, shows how shaky the Government was at
Westminster, for all its success in calling forth the sacrifices of the
nation at large. Allan Milward, War, Economy and Society 1939-1945,
offers a masterly survey.
Of the works available in English from or about the German side, the
best biography is Joachim Fest, Hitler, but there are profound insights
also in Sebastian Haffner, The Meaning of Hitler. J P Stern, Hitler, the
Fuhrer and the People, examines that extraordinary relationship, so
different from the ferocious conflicts within the Nazi hierarchy, for
which there is no better source than Albert Speer, Inside the Third
Reich.

THE 21-year-old pilot of a ''kit'' Fox Speedster aircraft was killed
yesterday when his machine crashed into a field at Dolphinton, near
Biggar, narrowly missing a farmhouse.
It is understood that the man, from Edinburgh, had helped to construct
the aircraft. It plunged to the ground at Newmill Farm as a member of
his family and a friend looked on. Air accident investigators from
Farnborough are expected to travel to the crash scene today.
Farmer's wife Mrs Ellie Gilchrist, 72, told last night how she had
earlier gone on a pleasure flight in the light aircraft which came down
about half-a-mile from her farmhouse.
She said: ''We were in the house when it happened. We just heard a
tremendous roar. We ran out to the field but by that time it was too
late. Where the plane crashed was just an inferno. There was no way the
young man could have got out alive.''
The pilot, believed to be an amateur flier, had asked Mrs Gilchrist's
husband David, 78, for permission to carry out a series of take-offs and
landings in the remote field.
Mrs Gilchrist agreed to go up on one of the earlier flights. She said:
''There were absolutely no problems. I can't think what could have
caused the crash.'' Strathclyde Police helicopter went to the scene
along with the emergency services after the crash which happened just
before 4pm yesterday.

His choice of the novels of 1945 leads ALAN BOLD to consider an
unusual combination of titles -- a political fable, a personal quest,
and a historical polemic.
CHOOSING my novels of the year for 1945 convinces me this year will be
remembered for some fiction as well as many facts. We have all
experienced the defeats of Germany and Japan, the deaths of Hitler and
Mussolini and Roosevelt, and the dropping of the atom bomb. Some of us
have read some fine novels during this year to remember.
Novels of 1945 such as Eleanor Dark's The Little Company, involving
the impact of war on Australia. And F L Green's Odd Man Out, set in a
Belfast battling with its sectarian problems. Henry Green's Loving, set
in a country house in neutral Ireland during the war. Nancy Mitford's
The Pursuit of Love, a darkly comic look at a romantic lady confronting
the ruins of war. Elizabeth Smart's By Grand Central Station I Sat Down
and Wept, an account of an amorous encounter that gives the narrator an
insight into the inhuman nature of war. Denton Welch's In Youth is
Pleasure, a psychologically disturbing narrative of a neurotic
adolescent.
A good year, then, and I could gladly go to examine any of the novels
named above. However, as I have been asked to concentrate on three new
novels of 1945, I will honour an unusual trinity of titles. George
Orwell's Animal Farm, a political fable. Evelyn Waugh's Brideshead
Revisited, a personal quest. Fionn MacColla's And the Cock Crew, a
historical polemic.
Animal Farm, subtitled A Fairy Story, shows how an ideological idyll
is transformed into a sorry state of affairs by the mentality of
creatures conditioned to abuse power. An old boar, old Major (standing
for Marx on four legs), has a dream of a brave new world in which the
animals of Manor Farm are no longer subject to the injustice of Mr
Jones, their lord and master from the bad old world of capitalism.
Major summons the farm animals to listen to him speak about his dream
and the animals come out of respect for the ancient revolutionary. The
pigs come as creatures fighting fit for communism. The cart-horse Boxer
comes as the animal equivalent of the poor exploited proletarian.
Thus speaks old Major: ''What then must we do? Why, work night and
day, body and soul, for the overthrow of the human race! That is my
message to you, comrades: Rebellion! . . . All men are enemies. All
animals are comrades. All animals are equal.'' Three days after
delivering his communist manifesto, old Major dies and leaves his
disciples to revolutionise their lives.
This they do on a day that Jones forgets to feed them. It is the last
straw for the animals. Hunger turns to anger. The capitalists are kicked
out and Manor Farm is renamed Animal Farm by pigs who have taught
themselves to write. Snowball (Trotsky), Napoleon (Stalin), and Squealer
(any old party hack) are prominent pigs who have reduced the principles
of old Major to the simple system of Animalism which comes complete with
Seven Commandments concluding: All animals are equal. Old Major's dream
looks like becoming a revolutionary reality.
Inspired by the military strategy of Snowball and the muscular
strength of Boxer, Animal Farm is able to resist attack by Jones and his
reactionary gang at the Battle of the Cowshed. However Snowball's plans
for permanent revolution are anathema to Napoleon, an increasingly
reactionary pig. Exit Snowball, pursued by Napoleon's savage dogs. Enter
the era of Napoleon and Squealer and it's one law for the leaders and
another for the beasts who have to bear them a burden.
After being attacked by Napoleon's dogs, pigs mildly sympathetic to
Snowball confess to crimes they never committed: ''Without any further
prompting they confessed that they had been secretly in touch with
Snowball ever since his expulsion . . . and that they had entered into
an agreement with him to hand over Animal Farm to Mr Frederick.
''They added that Snowball had privately admitted to them that he had
been Jones's secret agent for years past.'' They are slaughtered and
Napoleon is at liberty to rewrite history by attributing to Snowball his
own crimes against the ideals of Animalism: doing in any who oppose him,
doing a deal with the Hitlerian figure of farmer Frederick, doing what
came naturally to farmer Jones.
All the ideals of Animalism are abandoned by Napoleon. Boxer is sent
to the knacker's yard and the Seventh Commandment becomes: All animals
are equal but some animals are more equal than others. Napoleon, seen
''strolling in the farmhouse garden with a pipe in his mouth'', is more
equal than all the other animals put together and acts the part of an
old-fashioned farmer as he announces that Animal Farm will once again be
known as Manor Farm. Revolution promises to turn the world around, but
provides no escape for the creatures trapped in the vicious circle of
political violence described by Orwell in his Swiftian satire on
Stalinism.
I have summarised the plot at some length as Orwell wants us to ponder
on the plot and not on the aesthetic attractions of his style. He
attempted Joycean experimentation in his second novel, A Clergyman's
Daughter (1935), but Animal Farm is a simply told tale with a serious
message: principles are a threat to beastly politicians who therefore
plot against the principled. This is Orwell's war effort in defence of
democracy.
It reads, for all its imaginative ingenuity, as a straightforwardly
savage attack on Stalin and the show trials and shocking traumas of the
Soviet Union at the mercy of a menace of a man who makes his politics
with the mannerisms of a pig of the worst persuasion. With so many
Stalinists around it may take 50 years to confirm Orwell's allegory as a
classic.
The prose of Animal Farm has the polish and clarity of a well-washed
working-class window, Old Etonian Orwell being an expert on the pain of
the proletariat as an author who was Down and Out in Paris and London
(1933) and who took The Road to Wigan Pier (1937).
The prose of Brideshead Revisited is as ostentatious as the pattern on
a stained-glass window in a Roman Catholic cathedral. Waugh -- educated
at Lancing and Hertford College, Oxford -- was received into the Roman
Catholic Church in 1930 and his conversion explains why the character
who narrates his novel forgets the war when he finally finds peace in
the Brideshead family chapel.
Brideshead Revisited, subtitled The Sacred and the Profane Memories of
Captain Charles Ryder, is a soldier's lyrical tale of love lost and
faith found. During the war Charles's company is billeted at the stately
home of Brideshead Castle.
Charles's companions are excited by the novelty of it all, but he has
seen it all before and says so in his purple prose: ''I had been there
before; first with Sebastian more than 20 years ago on a cloudless day
in June, when the ditches were creamy with meadowsweet and the air heavy
with all the scents of summer; it was a day of peculiar splendour, and
though I had been there so often, in so many moods, it was to that first
visit that my heart returned on this, my latest.'' We are taken into the
world as it was for Charles and Sebastian Flyte at their first meeting
in 1923 and for many mornings after at Oxford and at Brideshead,
courtesy of the Marchmains, a rich Roman Catholic family.
SEBASTIAN, younger son of Lord Marchmain who lives away from the
family with his Italian mistress in Venice, comes across as an eccentric
character as he makes his first appearance in the novel to warn Charles
to beware of women and come away with him to drink wine.
Flamboyant Sebastian boasts: ''I've got a motorcar and a basket of
strawberries and a bottle of Chateau Peyraguey -- which isn't a wine
you've ever tasted, so don't pretend. It's heaven with strawberries.'' A
cradle Catholic who wants his heaven on earth, Sebastian is a perpetual
child spoiling for a battle with the bottle when he is not taking
comfort from his teddy-bear.
Sebastian drives Charles to Brideshead, pays his respects to his old
nannie in the nursery and shows Charles the family chapel but not the
family on this occasion. Gradually, Charles becomes familiar with the
family at Brideshead: Lady Marchmain, a long-suffering Catholic; Lord
Brideshead, heir to the family fortunes and misfortunes; Julia Flyte, a
Catholic who finds her soul in her beautiful body; Cordelia Flyte, a
plain Catholic who spoils her brother Sebastian.
Charles loves Sebastian -- ''Sebastian supine on the sunny seat in the
colonnade'' -- for all his faults, but falls in love with Julia as the
story develops into a spiritual family saga. Sebastian loses his battle
with the bottle and tries to find salvation by taking care of a wounded
and seemingly worthless German soldier in Tangier when working as a
menial in a monastery.
Julia has a hellish time when she marries Rex Mottram, a crude
Canadian non-Catholic. Charles has a hellish time when he marries Celia,
a superficial society woman. Julia and Charles plan to marry after their
divorces but he is not yet ready for Catholic ritual, so she decides on
a religious destiny of her own.
She makes sure her father, once a Catholic, dies in the faith he had
almost forgotten. She goes to Palestine to do good works with her sister
Cordelia. And Charles revisits Brideshead to find the ''small red
flame'' of a faith that now makes his life meaningful.
Though there are satirical touches in the novel -- Charles is an
architectual painter who produces a violent verbal portrait of the
outrageous Oxford aesthete Anthony Blanche -- Waugh has written nothing
like Brideshead Revisited before. The author of Vile Bodies (1930) and
Scoop (1938) ridiculed all around him. In his new novel, Waugh reveals
himself as a deeply religious writer. Sinners are forgiven, wretches
find redemption. In his own way, Waugh is as didactic as Orwell but
whereas Animal Farm is cynical, Brideshead Revisited is sentimental.
Brideshead Revisited is a good book by a believer who worships wealth
and sucks up to snobs, yet we can forgive Waugh his social sins so long
as he writes like an angel.
FIONN MacColla's second novel, And the Cock Crew, is an account of a
community ruined by the grim religion of Calvin and the gruesome reality
of the Highland Clearances of the nineteenth century. Maighstir Sachairi
Wiseman, the minister of Gleann Luachrach, betrays his flock as he
accommodates those who want to replace the people with sheep.
At first Maighstir Sachairi tries to protect the people when he
succumbs to the Calvinist concept of sin: ''And as the natural man is in
Sin, and the natural mind seeks what is contrary to God, he had been
sinning. All those years.'' Sinners are meant to suffer, so the
Highlanders, guilty of innocence, must suffer at the hands of English
enemies and their Scottish allies. Master Byars, the Factor, is free to
do his worst.
First Culloden killed the bodies of Highlanders, then Calvinism
crushed the spirits that remained after the military defeat of the
clans. Maighstir Sachairi came to Gleann Luachrach and launched his
theological assault on the grace of the Gaelic people: ''In the end he
had them on their knees weeping and crying to God to avert the
visitation of His wrath. The Holy Ghost swept through Gleann Luachrach
with the sough of the whirlwind, so that any that were without the
changed heart hid their faces and kept peace. Even Fearchar the Poet had
been confounded and silenced.''
The minister has made the people more miserable than they were before
he came among them with his life-denying dogma. Before he came they were
poor folk who enjoyed poetry and some simple pleasures. After his coming
they were poor souls with nothing to pray for except someone to protect
them. And the cock crew.
MacColla's evocation of the naysaying theology he thinks meant
spiritual death to much of Scotland is itself negative, and rather naive
in demonising the Kirk of Knox as the source of evil in Scotland, for
Knox was not responsible for the deeds of his disciples. Nowhere in the
novel does MacColla offer any hope of a Gaelic spiritual-cum-cultural
revival. There is only the prospect of more Reformation, more Knox on
the head, more Calvinist blows to the body and soul. MacColla is
imposing on his readers the idea of a cultural tragedy created by the
Kirk.
And the Cock Crew ends, inevitably, in catastrophe. The Highlanders,
aware of a plan to burn them out of their homes, go to Maighstir
Sachairi for help but he denies them because he thinks they deserve what
he interprets as divine judgment on their sins. For his sins he is
fatally injured when he attempts to save the Factor from being trampled
to death by cattle. There is no salvation in that direction.
And the Cock Crew is a fiercely argumentative novel that includes an
extended and impressive debate between Fearchar the Poet, representing
Gaelic culture in decline, and Maighstir Sachairi, representing
Calvinism on the offensive. Clearly, MacColla feels passionately that
the Gaelic past has no future in a country conditioned by Calvinism.
Gaelic culture was the great glory of Scotland's story, according to
MacColla, and he is bitter about its betrayal. MacColla writes of the
past with understandable tension and he could have a future as one of
the most telling Scottish novelists of the century.
A war comes to a close but writers of fiction fight on for the command
of the human consciousness. Writers as combative as the creators of
Animal Farm, Brideshead Revisited, and And the Cock Crew.

BRITISH Rail yesterday laid the blame for the decision to close the
West Highland sleeper service squarely on the shoulders of the
Government.
It candidly admitted that the plan to run ghost or remnant services
over six miles of track in Strathclyde currently used only by the Fort
William to London service was a device to avoid the need for public
consultation on the closure.
It argued, however, that the admittedly unpopular decision to withdraw
the Deerstalker Express was dictated by Government financial restraints
and was the least painful option available. BR claims that withdrawing
the sleepers could save #2.5m.
Its counsel, Mr Christopher Haddow, QC, told Lord Kirkwood at the
Court of Session in Edinburgh: ''Those who run the railways find
themselves squeezed between the scorn of the general public and
financial requirements imposed by the Government.''
Some hope for the future of the service was given when BR pledged to
retain the sleeper rolling stock so that if the franchising director
decides to re-establish the sleeper, this could be done with the minimum
of delay.
British Rail's frank admissions were contained in its response to a
petition for judicial review by Highland region which claims that the
decision to close the sleeper service is unlawful, irrational, and
unreasonable.
Mr Andrew Hajducki, QC for the region, argued that section 37 of the
1993 Railways Act provided that where there was a proposal to
discontinue all railway passenger services on any line, three-months'
notice must be given to the director of passenger rail franchising.
This safeguard meant that the public and other interested bodies could
make their views known.
What was envisaged by BR was the closure of the sleeper service in its
entirety without any comparable replacement.
What was proposed in place of the service was three trains in the
Glasgow area which, argued Mr Hajducki, were a sham of no conceivable
benefit to the public.
One of the three trains was to run between Maryhill and Bishopbriggs,
departing at two minutes to midnight.
A ''frank admission'' had been made by BR that there was no proven
need for such a service, and that the timing, 23.58, was ''unlikely to
benefit the travelling public''.
Mr Hajducki said it was difficult to judge which of the new Glasgow
services was the most absurd but perhaps it was the proposal to run a
service from Cumbernauld to Glasgow Queen Street at 23.48, 25 minutes
after the last existing train.
This would travel to Cowlairs West where it would reverse and run to
Queen Street.
He said: ''What BR are doing is attempting to get round the statutory
safeguards by providing the sham services. It cannot be argued that
proposed sham services are a genuine replacement for the West Highland
sleeper service.''
The sleeper service is due to be axed on May 28 and Highland region
wants the closure halted until full consultation procedures have taken
place.
Mr Haddow told the court: ''It is quite easy to provoke mirth about
the railways in this country and how they are run. Sometimes
consideration of any decision of the board starts from the proposition
that it will have been absurd or irrational.''
He explained that the background to the decision to axe the sleeper
service was that BR had to make the least painful cut and if the court
ruled that the decision was irrational a more painful cut would have to
be made elsewhere.
He described BR's decision as rational although he accepted it was not
popular and not one which railway enthusiasts, untramelled by financial
considerations, would accept as reasonable.
He added, however: ''The decision is not an absurd one. There is no
outrageous defiance of logic and reason. It is a measured response to
the requirement to cut expenditure.''
Mr Haddow described the decision to put on the substitute services as
the cheapest option and insisted that they amounted to continued
passenger services over the sections of track in Glasgow.
There was no closure of the lines and therefore no need to invoke the
closure procedure. He added that BR also had a duty to balance the books
despite cuts in central government grant and the Government's refusal to
allow it to increase fares to make up the shortfall in revenue.
Lord Kirkwood will issue his decision next Tuesday.

CLYDESDALE District Council is to appeal against the decision by Lord
Weir in the Court of Session last week that the Lanark Blue cheesemaker
Mr Humphrey Errington had been denied natural justice when a district
court justice of the peace condemned 44 batches of his unpasteurised
cheese, worth around #27,000.
The council took action against Mr Errington because its environmental
health department had found the food bacteria, listeria monocytogenes in
samples of the cheese, and claimed it was unfit for human consumption.
At a private hearing of the district court in February, JP Mrs
Elizabeth Wilson refused to allow Mr Errington's lawyers to
cross-examine witnesses on controversial scientific evidence.
Last week, however, Lord Weir set aside the JP's decision and said
that because of the complex issues involved in the case, it would be
desirable for any future legal proccedings over the cheese to be heard
by an experienced sheriff.
Lord Weir was also critical of the attitude adopted by Clydesdale
District Council in opposing cross-examination of expert witnesses.
Yesterday, environmental health director Mr Bob Russell said that
following meetings with its legal advisers, the council had decided to
go ahead with an appeal against Lord Weir's decision.
0 He said that he would be discussing the matter with the chair of the
environmental health committee and the leader of the council before
presenting the background to the decision to the environmental health
committee at its meeting on Wednesday.
The disputed cheese is being kept frozen at Mr Errington's premises at
Dunsyre.

UNSUNG HEROES
WELL WENT THE DAY
ed Derek Tangye.
Michael Joseph, #14.99
TRIBUTE: A Salute to the British Armed Forces of the Second World War
Alwyn W Turner
Publishing, #14.99
WAR, by definition, is a cruel business. Its victims are often the
innocent, and its heroes are mostly unsung.
In Well Went the Day, Derek Tangye has gathered a collection of
tributes to ordinary men and women who gave their lives during the first
two years of the Second World War, a time when Britain stood alone and
on the brink of defeat.
All the tributes, originally published in 1942 and now reissued, are
written by close friends, among them distinguished authors such as
Howard Spring, James Agate, and Peter Quennell, but they also include
simple, moving stories such as that written by the mother of the three
MacRobert brothers from Aberdeen.
After all had been killed in action, she donated money to the RAF to
buy another bomber so that their work could be carried on, and their
sacrifice would not be in vain.
Men like Jack Maynard, a London auxiliary fireman who saved thousands
of lives during the Blitz and spent two months on nightly call-outs at
the height of the air assault on the capital.
His luck ran out when a bomb landed directly on his crew, killing
three and riddling Maynard with shrapnel. He died in hospital seven
months later. More than 20 of his mates from the Beckenham fire station
had been killed in the interim.
Not all were front-line fighters. Joseph Skalda was condemned and shot
by firing squad for publishing an underground newspaper in occupied
Czechoslovakia. Violet Cruickshank, a volunteer ambulance driver who had
lost her father, brother, and fiance in the First World War, was waiting
to load casualties from a blazing London tenement when a bomb scored a
direct hit on her vehicle.
Billy Fiske, a young American who volunteered for the RAF three days
before war was declared, shot down six German aircraft during the Battle
of Britain before his fighter was hit during a major raid. He crashed in
flames on his home airfield at Tangmere.
Acting Captain Stephen Fegen, an Irishman, won the Victoria Cross for
his selfless action in sacrificing the lightly-armed merchant ship
Jervis Bay in action against the German battlecruiser Admiral Scheer.
He and most of his crew went down with the ship after holding off the
enemy for more than three hours. The unequal fight enabled 33
defenceless merchant vessels and thousands of men to escape unscathed.
What perhaps sets the anthology apart more than the tales of courage
and duty is the flavour of that dangerous time. Most of the
pen-portraits were written within weeks of the victims' deaths, and the
raw feeling of the authors' loss is fresh and apparent.
Tribute is a comprehensive guide to the contribution made by all three
Services throughout the war. It paints a vivid picture of the fact that
most sailors', soldiers', and airmen's experience of conflict was not
that of epoch-making battles, but the many small, largely unrecorded
actions which are the fabric of war itself.

SECRET WARS
OUR GAME
John le Carre
Hodder and Stoughton, #16.99.
HEART'S JOURNEY IN WINTER
James Buchan
Harvill #14.99/paperback #9.99
THE official ending of the Second World War gave no country peace of
mind. James Buchan reminds us that war ended with fighting continuing in
''battlefields of the imagination''. Buchan's verbal declaration of war
against peace is nothing new, as his grandfather, the great John, could
have told him.
War, hot or cold, is good news for novelists. John Buchan, an obvious
influence on John le Carre and James Buchan, looked forward to the First
World War when, in 1914, he created Richard Hannay in the image of
Edmund Ironside, an old warrior still going strong when he was made
field-marshal in 1940. Ian Fleming looked back to the Second World War
when he created cold-warrior James Bond in the image of Dusko Popov, a
British agent who infiltrated the Nazi secret service.
War is something authors love to spy on, and spying, if you'll forgive
the Plathian pun, is an art like anything else. Some do it exceptionally
well, winning their war by making their peace with words. Le Carre is a
crafty master of his art but has never been happy with his status as the
great spy-novelist, the literary genius of a strictly limited genre.
When I met le Carre at his spacious Hampstead home on the day
(November 20, 1990) the cold war officially ended, he admitted he had
done a bit of spying but insisted his fiction was an inventive affair.
In fact, his fiction uses espionage as a metaphor for human betrayal, a
subject that has haunted le Carre since his boyhood. He was five when
his mother Olive walked out on the family, 18 when he discovered his
father Ronnie had served a term in prison when the author was a boy.
In le Carre's books, loyalty is associated with a feeling for some
kind of family. George Smiley, his most famous character, is a maternal
father-figure who, betrayed by his wife, keeps faith with the family he
controls and comforts at the Circus at the heart of the British
intelligence community.
I believe le Carre to be a romantic rather than a realist. The Spy Who
Came in From the Cold (1963), praised by Graham Greene as an exceptional
spy story, exposed the apparatus of espionage, but the heart of the
matter was Leamas's love for Liz. Le Carre stopped spying in The Native
and Sentimental Lover (1971), a lyrical love story, but was murdered by
critics for doing so, and did his best to bring more spies in from the
cold to please a public conditioned to read him as a realist.
Smiley embarked on his Quest for Karla -- Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy
(1974), The Honourable Schoolboy (1977), Smiley's People (1979) -- and
embraced his extended family, yet le Carre longed to return to more
intimate romances. Hence The Russia House (1989), sans Smiley, and the
similarly Smiley-less The Night Manager (1993).
The latest le Carre, Our Game, narrated by recently retired secret
servant Tim Cranmer, opens with a typically combative le Carrean list of
questions. Larry Pettifer, lecturer at Bath University, has gone
missing, prompting questions that help define his character.
His students ask after Larry's drinking and his love-life. Tim thinks
of Larry lurching at him with a command and a question: ''Come on,
Timbo, fix us a bloody big Scotch, and who gives a damn about women
anyway?''
Larry gives a damn about one woman, Emma. So does Tim.
When the Bath police come to ask after Larry, Tim, a past master at
asking questions, is anxious about answering them. I am reminded of le
Carre's reply to an awkward question I asked him in London: ''Feel free
to ask any questions. Only the answers are dangerous.''
So it proves, as this book unfolds in the familiar le Carrean fashion
with the future seen as a thing of the past. Tim has been an operational
Man in the Office, Larry has been his double-agent, Emma has calculated
how to appeal to both of them. Larry and Emma can wander off to Russia
with love but cannot escape from the deceitful ways of the supposedly
Free World they have done their worst to leave behind.
All le Carre's questions are in aid of a quest -- in Our Game, one
man's quest for compassion in a warring world. Tim is betrayed by the
woman he loves, by the man he befriended, by the cause that brings him
in from the Cold War and out into a hot war still raging in Russia.
I am not giving the game away when I say Our Game is no conventional
spy novel, but a Conradian journey into the heart of darkness. A
romantic tale of torment.
Now, back to the Buchans. Musing on what made his thrillers so
thrilling, John Buchan invoked the notion of the urgent journey, and
James Buchan's new novel honours the family tradition of hitting the
road.
Richard Fisher, the narrator, recalls the urgent journey he made to
Germany in 1983 to test the time of his life: ''I suppose that's why I
made this journey east, which is the direction you take in Germany if
you have business with death . . . ''
That could be John Buchan speaking through Richard Hannay, who says in
The Thirty-nine Steps: ''I had no clear purpose in my journey, but I
steered east (and) could scarcely believe that somewhere behind me were
those who sought my life.''
But James, being a child of our time, has to talk tougher than John as
he analyses Fisher's sexual and ideological adventures with Polina Mertz
in a Germany dying for the Berlin Wall to come tumbling down. Fisher is
supposedly some kind of killer, but for all his rough tradecraft he
turns out to be a tender soul who tells Polina: ''Only love lasts.''
Like le Carre, James Buchan is a romantic cunningly disguised as a
realist. Like le Carre, Buchan uses tradecraft to get to the art of the
matter.
Our Game, read by John le Carre is available from Hodder Audiobooks

THE BLITZ: THE HOME FRONT.
Andrew Langley.
Hamlyn, #7.99 and #3.99
THE 50th anniversary of the Allies' victory in Europe means an extra
day off school for today's children and possibly a re-creation of the
street parties and fireworks jollifications which signalled the end of
bombing raids and the prospect of peace.
Two generations on, the smallest school children will relate how their
grandparents hid from bombs in their garden air-raid shelters. The
realisation that this may be the last generation to be able to gather
first-hand accounts has spurred publishers to produce easily-assimilated
histories of the war years for the eight to 13-year-olds.
Some are surprisingly expert on Second World War aircraft and appear
to accept fighting and bomb attacks with equanimity. Even the most
protected of this generation have seen images of war in Bosnia, Rwanda,
or the Gulf, and know that when nation falls out with nation, men,
women, and children can be killed at random.
Yet we are still presenting them with a largely sanitised version of
the Second World War, when what we owe to their grandparents and
great-grandparents who were there is to ensure future generations do not
have to do what they did. That demands that we cut down the glory and
the flag-waving and take stock of the suffering, despite the instinct
which urges us to protect children from unpalatable truth.
In time for VE Day, Hamlyn has just added The Blitz and The Home Front
to its History of Britain series which has been progressing from the
Saxons and the Vikings to the present day. Both written by Andrew
Langley and illustrated by John James, they are a rich, stylish, and
informative collage of historical narrative, archive photographs,
reproductions of documents such as ration books, posters, and identity
cards and illustration.
Unless other volumes on the Second World war are envisaged, they
present only a domestic and social view of one of the major upheavals of
the world. Circumscribed, presumably deliberately, by the titles of the
volumes, they present a picture of 1939-45 without a mention of the
Holocaust or the atomic bomb.
From Chamberlain's momentous broadcast on September 3, 1939, to May 8,
1945, they are child-friendly guides to the war which provide
information in layers which can be tackled according to ability.
For adults of the immediate post-war generation, it is the
faithfully-reproduced ephemera rather than the black and white news
photographs of people in odd-looking clothes, which bring home how
relatively recent this conflict was.
There is a yellowing leaflet on the why and how of evacuation, a happy
families variety of card game in which all the characters are evacuees,
and a record sleeve with the title: Goodnight Children Everywhere, with
a tender thought to all evacuated children.
Presumably on the premise that history comes alive when we can
identify to some extent with those involved, both books are strong on
how the war affected children. The section on evacuees in The Blitz has
photographs of smiling youngsters setting off for their new homes, but
the text favours neutral reportage over sentiment: ''Many evacuees were
welcomed by their hosts, but others were treated as a nuisance.''
Beneath a Ministry of Health poster showing a boy with a tin helmet
collecting scrap metal from a bomb site being warned off by an Air Raid
Precautions warden and bearing the legend ''Leave this to us sonny --
YOU ought to be out of London,'' Andrew Langley recounts: ''Many
evacuees quickly became bored or homesick in the country. They missed
the bustle of the streets, cinemas, and chip shops. By early 1940, a
million mothers and children had returned to the towns.''
The illustrations draw on familiar images and are typified by the
family gathered round the radio: pipe-smoking father, mother in twinset,
short-trousered boy playing with toy soldiers, girl examining a gas
mask, but they contain sufficient detail to arouse youthful curiosity.
Both contain more than the usual ration of pictures of girls and
women, for example a child injured in a bomb blast is shown being
carried to safety by a female rescue worker among a group of male
colleagues. It suggests a deliberate trawl of the archives, in which
case it has succeeded in making the subject of war as relevant to girls
as to boys.
A section on women at war in The Home Front manages to make the point
that an enormous variety of tasks was undertaken by women, often for the
first time, but that although they could join the armed forces, there
were restrictions on what they could do. There are photographs of land
girls, women in an engineering factory and, tellingly, of a woman
''ferry pilot'' ready to fly a fighter plane from factory to airfield.
Yet one of the final images on the domestic front is of a young woman
examining a gift of nylons from an American GI to the wonderment of
young brothers and sisters each with a Hershey bar and under the
suspicious gaze of her mother. Even social history has its complexities.
There is a great deal of excellent material in both books. All the
more disappointing, therefore, is the failure, despite a brief
explanation of the invasion of Poland and the declaration of war in The
Blitz, to step back from the tourist trail approach and address the
vital (and admittedly difficult) task of explaining what it was all
about. Maybe old soldiers have to do that.

It was just another adventure, until the distance from family and
friends hit home. Andrew Young remembers being one of the thousands of
children shipped to the other side of the globe.
I CELEBRATED V E Day parading with dozens of other children on a dusty
road in the countryside not far from Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.
We banged tin lids, waved makeshift flags, and made as much noise as we
could.
Just how I came to be on that parade on the other side of the great
big world is a long story which I will condense. I had been evacuated to
Australia shortly after the outbreak of war, in the first consignment
under the auspices of a body known as the Children's Overseas Reception
Board.
Why Australia? It was something I never quite understood. Probably it
had seemed like a good idea at the time. There were all sorts of ideas
for coping with the German threat and one of them had been to get the
children to safe areas.
I had already been evacuated once as a pupil at Jordanhill College
School. Some of us ended up near Aberfoyle on Blairhoyle Estate, owned
by the Crabbie family of whisky and green ginger fame. That had been a
lot of fun.
We attended the tiny Ruskie village school where Miss MacPherson, the
kindly teacher, bought us all a bar of toffee from the van that visited
each week.
As a nine-year-old, the idea of going to Australia seemed like another
part of the great adventure of life. Like going on holiday or a camping
trip with the cubs. We would be back soon. In the event, it was more
than five years before I saw my parents again.
The first slight awareness that this was something different was when
I saw Mrs McDougall, our neighbour in Ivanhoe Road, Knightswood, crying
as I set out.
Then, as we were anchored off Freetown on the west coast of Africa,
watching the natives diving for coins, the real pangs of home-sickness
set in. There was to be no turning back. It was to be a long, long
journey. Two months, two weeks, and two days during which we crossed the
Equator three times.
The fact that a voyage in wartime might be dangerous had never entered
our minds. We sailed from Liverpool on the MS Batory, a Polish luxury
liner that still had its first-class cabins and was partially converted
as a troop carrier. Initially we were accompanied by a heavy escort of
navy vessels.
Another ship taking children to Canada was torpedoed with the loss of
many lives shortly after it left the convoy.
We anchored at Cape Town for two weeks, then up to Bombay where I
celebrated my tenth birthday and the captain organised a cake. Next
Ceylon. Then Singapore, where the hundreds of soldiers who had been on
board disembarked, a great many never to return. Then Fremantle in
Western Australia, Melbourne, and Sydney.
Because we were the first lot of evacuees to make the journey, the
newsreel cameras were out at every port. Subsequently I was to keep
cropping up on All Our Yesterdays, the television series presented by
Brian Inglis.
At Carlingford District Rural School, where I was the only evacuee, I
was a novelty at first. The headmaster, Mr Giovanelli, would bring
visiting parties into the classroom to hear me read. I also escaped the
brutal discipline -- he used to rule that school with a rod of cane.
In the playground I would be surrounded by kids asking endless
questions like ''Do you play the bagpipes?'' Eventually I was retorting
with ''No. Do you throw the boomerang?''
When I went on to the secondary part of the school they were
presenting the J M Barrie play The Old Lady Shows her Medals. Inevitably
I got cast as the Scots soldier, making the most of the slightly rude
line: ''Oh hell, give me a cup of tea.''
Carlingford was a very sparsely populated area. Just a cluster of
shops and a telephone box where you turned a handle to get the operator.
The feeling was of being completely cut off from the rest of the
world, even more so when Japan came into the war. It was a joy when
entertainers such as Bob Hope reached those shores and were heard on the
radio.
There were radio link-ups with the BBC and the Australian Broadcasting
Commission for the evacuees and their folks at home. I recorded a
message that was broadcast here and my parents one to me there. Then
there was a two-way link when we were able to talk live. Aunt Kathleen
Garscadden did the introductions from Glasgow and in Sydney it was
Wilfrid Thomas, later to make a reputation as a BBC disc jockey.
Many years later I was to meet Wilfrid Thomas again, when we were
members of a party of travel journalists and broadcasters visiting the
caves of Petra in Jordan. The world was then a smaller place.

BETTING shops are lining up for the start of a new event this weekend
-- Sunday opening. Sunday racing began in Britain earlier this year, but
tomorrow will be the first time High Street bookmakers will be allowed
to open on the Sabbath.
The move has dismayed Scottish churches which regard it as the latest
in a series of attacks on the status of the day of rest.
For the betting fraternity, tomorrow's big racing attractions include
the 1000 Guineas at Newmarket. For Scots punters, there will the extra
treat of the Celtic-Rangers match.
Sunday opening was welcomed as ''marvellous opportunity'' by the
British Horse Racing Board's marketing director, Lee Richardson.
All the big bookmaking firms said their shops would open at noon to
take advantage of the new law. Many of the small, independent bookmakers
will also be opening.
A spokesman at the Great Western Road branch of David McAllister in
Glasgow said: ''We expect there will a good demand to begin with,
because of the novelty. But we will have to wait and see whether that is
sustained.''
The Government's decision to allow betting shops to open on the
Sabbath was described as ''a very bad piece of legislation'' by Mrs Ann
Allen, a former vice-convener of the Church of Scotland's board of
social responsibility.
She said: ''The Kirk's view is that betting is not a pastime which
should be encouraged. The fact that it will be available on a Sunday
will interfere even more with the family and Christian values of the
Sabbath.''

THE 21-year-old pilot of a ''kit'' Fox Speedster aircraft was killed
yesterday when his machine crashed into a field at Dolphinton, near
Biggar, narrowly missing a farmhouse.
It is understood that the man, from Edinburgh, had helped to construct
the aircraft. It plunged to the ground at Newmill Farm as a member of
his family and a friend looked on.
Farmer's wife Mrs Ellie Gilchrist, 72, told how she had earlier gone
on a pleasure flight in the light aircraft which came down about
half-a-mile from her house.
She said: ''We were in the house when it happened. We just heard a
tremendous roar. We ran out to the field but by that time it was too
late. Where the plane crashed was just an inferno.''
The pilot, believed to be an amateur flier, had asked Mrs Gilchrist's
husband David, 78, for permission to carry out a series of take-offs and
landings in the remote field.
*A helicopter pilot died last night when his aircraft crashed near
Lochgilphead.
The man has not yet been named, but it is believed he comes from
Yorkshire. He was employed to fly supplies to a number of fish farms in
the West of Scotland.
Unconfirmed reports suggest that the helicopter went into a nose-dive
just before the crash. The accident happened on land close to the shore
at Lingerton dump.

DESPITE the latest electoral hammering suffered by the Tories,
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang has said the party will stick to its
fundamental principles and priorities.
He has also defended the Government's review of the nuclear power
industry, which will result in Scottish Nuclear being merged with its
English neighbour when the industry is privatised next year, as ''a very
good outcome for Scotland''.
In an interview to be broadcast on BBC2's Scottish Lobby tomorrow, Mr
Lang described the local election results in England and Wales as ''very
disappointing'', but said they showed that the Conservatives'
performance in last month's council polls north of the Border was not an
exclusively Scottish experience.
Mr Lang said: ''It puts the Scottish results in context and
demonstrates that the Government has a problem, but it is a UK problem.
''Our message is not getting across, it is not understood, the pain is
still being felt by the electorate as a result of the decisions that
we've had to take to get the economy in good shape for long-term growth,
and the benefits have not yet come through.
''So we have some thinking to do, some listening to do, and a lot of
further work to do.''
While a setback for the party ''across the whole nation'' was
something to be concerned about, it was not without precedent, he said.
Opinion had swung in a very volatile way over successive Parliaments in
the past few decades. He added: ''It is more marked in this Parliament
than I've known it before; that makes it more challenging for us.
''We have a mandate for a Parliament and we shall go on working,
sticking to the fundamental principles and priorities that we have.''
The decision on the future of Scottish Nuclear was taken in Cabinet on
Thursday but the details will not be announced until the publication of
a White Paper on Tuesday.
It was put to Mr Lang in the interview that if selling off Scottish
Nuclear as part of Nuclear Electric was in fact the final decision, this
was not an outcome supported by people in Scotland.
Mr Lang told the interviewer he would have to wait for the
announcement, but added: ''I'm confident we've got a very good deal for
Scotland.
''I think most people in Scotland want us to have that industry
continuing in existence. It is a quality industry, it employs very able
people, and it is an important part of the Scottish infrastructure.''

SURRENDER
Determined to go down fighting, many German troops, chose death before
surrender. James Laing tells how the war ended with many bangs and few
whimpers.
THE official announcement that Germany had surrendered unconditionally
came on May 8, 1945, a day to be commemorated as VE-Day. But no-one had
told all the German units still fighting desperate battles deep within
the borders of their Fatherland. And no-one had told the fanatic and
ruthless commanders of the remnants of the U-boat fleet.
As the German High Command was forced to accept the terms dictated by
the Allies, two merchant ships were sunk in the Firth of Forth. It was
May 7, only hours before the final ceasefire.
Just a mile south of the Isle of May the U-boat U-2336, commanded by
Captain Emil Klusmeier, attacked the Norwegian ship Sneland I and the
British merchantman the Avondale Park and sank them both. They were
helpless against the torpedoes.
People building the celebration bonfires on the coasts of Fife and in
East Lothian near North Berwick heard the explosions and saw the flames.
They were shocked and horrified at such a savage and wanton attack.
Seven Norwegian seamen died and two British men were killed.
Other U-boat commanders in the first week of May had been ordered to
surrender to allied warships by surfacing and raising a black flag. Many
did but some commanders chose to scuttle their U-boats rather than
suffer the dishonour of surrender.
Two U-boats chose to surface in the remote and beautiful waters of
Loch Eriboll on the far northern coast of Scotland near Durness and Cape
Wrath. Another arrogantly surfaced in the middle of Dundee harbour.
In the land battles in Europe Scots were heavily involved until the
last minutes and more as the fighting slowly abated.
In Germany, near Bremerhaven, the 51st Highland Division had been
fighting fierce battles against crack German troops who had refused to
give in as millions of their comrades had done in the other war
theatres.
Even on May 8, the day the war was supposed to be over, the 5th
Battalion, the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders, were sheltering in a
village called Glinde, a few miles from the German port.
They were the last British infantry to be in contact with the enemy.
And right up until the last moment the Jocks were still being bombarded
by Germans armed with deadly, self-propelled guns.
The Camerons were moving forward in ''kangaroos'', armoured troop
carriers, and the German guns found them easy targets.
Every Scottish soldier knew the end of the war was imminent. So did
the Germans. But still the heavy fighting continued around Bremerhaven
and Cuxhaven.
The 51st had SS troops on each flank and a Panzer division of heavily
armed tanks in front. The Panzers stopped fighting on May 7 but it was
not until well into VE-Day that 200 German SS troops eventually
surrendered to the Camerons in Glinde, weary, dirty, but still resenting
their orders.
A contemporary report described them as hard, well-trained soldiers
still disciplined as they walked into captivity.
All weekend of May 5 and 6 German units had been surrendering to
allied troops.
The British and American command had refused a request from the German
commander, General Jodl, that his troops facing the Russian advance
should be allowed to surrender to the allied armies. They were terrified
of Russian retaliation -- and with reason.
A few days earlier the Gordon Highlanders, leading the drive of the
51st Highland Division towards the prize port of Hamburg, had captured a
battalion of German ''Jugend''.
The battalion, commanded by a seasoned Wermacht major, was composed of
children recruited and brainwashed by the Reichsfuhrer's speeches to
fight for the Fatherland.
The youngest were just turned 13 years old and the oldest were 16. But
they were heavily armed and many had to be killed by the allied forces
before they surrendered. British troops were pictured in tears as they
examined the bodies and rounded up the survivors.
The death of Hitler had been announced to the German people and their
armies. On April 30, with Russian armies in the outskirts of Berlin,
Hitler had shot himself in his bomb-proof bunker. His mistress, Eva
Braun, had taken poison. The announcement said he had died with honour,
the last lie in a decade of tyranny.
A few days later Goebbels poisoned his four young children and, with
his wife, committed suicide.
But still the Germans, now ruled by Admiral Doenitz, fought to try to
salvage some remnants of dignity for their defeated nation. It was a
useless gesture. Doenitz flew to Stockholm to try to negotiate terms. He
was sent back. The terms were unconditional.
On VE-Day the official military command was still sending out
communiques detailing the actions leading to the last battle.
One even recorded the last artillery round fired by British troops in
the European theatre -- and it was fired by a Scot.
The terse message read: ''At 8.45pm on Thursday, May 3, Gunner Gordon
Bruce of Arbroath fired the last 25lb shell at retreating Germans.''
Later Gunner Bruce was to recall that his unit, the 127 Royal
Artillery regiment, had been called forward to support the 1st Gordon
Highlanders who were under heavy attack.
He remembered being under heavy machine-gun and mortar fire. A forward
observer with the infantry set up the co-ordinate and the salvo was
fired. Gunner Bruce was the last to let go.
He was not aware of the significance until a war correspondent
approached the regiment to write it up for British newspapers.
Gunner Bruce dug out the empty shell case and took it back to Arbroath
as a souvenir. Years later he was to lend it out to an exhibition and
never saw it again.
The Arbroath gunner, like millions of other men, returned to Britain
to return to work. Sadly he died in his home town two years ago at the
age of 75.

There were many who kept the home fires burning during the war. But,
James Laing finds, there was one special child who helped set the town
on fire.
FIFTY years ago, on V E-Day, she was running about in a grassy park in
her bare feet, a happy, laughing child. It was her sixth birthday and,
for Trudi Danks, it was a day to make a memory. On that day in May,
Trudi, because it was her birthday, was the child chosen to light the
official Glasgow bonfire to celebrate the end of hostilities.
The bonfire had been building for days, a huge pile of everything that
would burn. The site was known locally as ''Cuddie's Park'', which was
little more than a piece of waste ground just above Cowcaddens.
''It was chosen because it was the highest point in the centre of the
city,'' remembers Trudi. ''You can still see the crater where the
bonfire burned itself into the ground but the waste ground has all been
tidied up now.''
Trudi Danks, back in 1945, was Margaret Dinsmore. Her father was a
bridge and lock-keeper on the Forth and Clyde Canal, which was still a
busy waterway in those days.
Today, she is a 56-year-old grandmother, an ex-chorus girl, who lives
in Clydebank. ''I have vivid memories of that night back in 1945,'' she
said. ''At six, I was old enough to know what it was all about, I think.
I can remember men and women in their uniforms dancing and singing
around that huge fire.
''I lit it with a paraffin rag wrapped around a big stick. My dad had
to help me push it into the bottom of the fire. And I was terrified at
the flames. I still don't like fire.
''Another memory is the feel of running about with bare feet. People
nowadays hardly believe that, but there were no sandals and it was
nearly summer so it was bare feet for almost all the kids.''
There were wonderful surprises as well for children in those heady
days of the end of the war. Trudi remembers an uncle coming home after
being demobbed.
''And he had his demob money. That made him a rich man because we had
nothing. He gave us kids a present of some money. It might have been as
much as five bob (25p), which was a fortune to us.
''The Government had also relaxed the sweet rationing to celebrate the
end of the war and you know what Glaswegians are like when it comes to
sweeties. When we got to the shop there were only mint imperials and
Turkish delight left.''
But for children deprived of these small pleasures it was a sweetie
paradise.

ONE of the top salmon fishing rivers in Scotland is up for sale for
just under #2m.
The River Halladale, in north Sutherland, is currently owned by
Jonathan Bulmer, of the famous cider-making family, and his wife Lady
Marcia.
The 12-mile stretch averages 312 salmon a year and is regarded by
anglers as one of the finest fishing rivers in the country.
Included in the sale is the six-bedroomed Forsinard Lodge and 4300
acres of hill ground which can be leased for grouse shooting and deer
stalking.
The Halladale rises near Forsinard, 125 miles north of Inverness and
enters the sea at Melvich Bay on Sutherland's north coast.
[+/-] spokesman for selling agents Knight, Frank and Rutley said:
''The river flows through a delightful mixture of heather moorland,
native hardwoods, traditional farmland, and the occasional rocky gorge.
''There are spectacular sandy beaches at Melvich and Strathy and a
number of golf courses within easy reach.''
He said the Halladale enjoyed a long fishing season, with spring
salmon available from March.
There are prolific runs of grilse and summer salmon throughout the
season and fishing is by fly only.
The largest salmon ever recorded on the river was caught in 1929 and
weighed just over 30lbs.
During a six-day spell in July 1991, a total of 119 fish were caught,
and 51 were caught in three days in August 1993.
A recent programme of improvements has been carried out, new pools
have been created, and the catch has doubled over the past five years.
The Bulmers, who also own the 50,000-acre Amhuinnsuidhe Estate, on
Harris, are asking for over #1.85m for the Halladale.

A chance discovery at work coupled with family memories of the war in
Germany have given Douglas Watson an insight into what V E Day means.
TO most of the thirtysomething generation, the 50th anniversary of VE
Day means little. Just another holiday. But to older generations it is a
remembrance of a time when people lived in fear for their lives on a
daily basis. A fear that all the hopes and dreams that had been built
could come crashing down at any moment. A fear that loved ones gone to
fight for King and Country would never return, and even if they did, the
fear they would never be the same again.
My generation has known nothing of such fear. Our real fear had been
the possibility that someone might press the button and start a nuclear
war that would not only be the war to end wars but would wipe out the
world as we know it.
These are not generally the thoughts that pervade my mind but they
were sparked off by a discovery in the building in which I am the
caretaker.
Below street level in Glasgow's Argyle Street I discovered two
air-raid shelters and began to contemplate the great freedom we now
enjoy without the fears of our fore-fathers. Now these shelters sit
desolate, unused, and unseen. Shelter A held 120 and Shelter B 80
people. Some of our mothers and fathers crowded into them at the sound
of the air-raid siren. While bombs fell across the city of Glasgow,
these shelters preserved that which was more precious than buildings of
stone -- life itself.
I have often sat down in the shelters, trying to imagine what it must
have been like. My own imagination can never fully comprehend the fear
that gripped the hearts of the men, women, and children who huddled for
safety in the bowels of the city.
Rainer Schutte, my father-in-law, has a greater understanding. He knew
that something had happened when he was no longer allowed to play with
the toys that bore the mark of the swastika. He was six years old then
and had already suffered the cruelties of war, losing his father at the
age of four.
For Rainer and many Germans, it was a good day when the war ended. He
believes that it is right to celebrate this great day. He is convinced
that ''such a day is of immense importance for the future''.
But has he ever felt guilty about being German? ''Personally, I'm not
guilty. Maybe I would have been if the end had come later. But I am
feeling ashamed and sad that such a system existed with a German name.''
He also feels that he and other Germans have a responsibility to be
active against injustice lest such injustices reach the terrible
extremes of Nazism again.
Asked whether we should remember VE Day or should it be buried and
forgotten, Rainer answers confidently that there should be ''remembrance
of liberation, remembering because of the responsibility. Yes, such
remembrance has to be. Even if there is no camparison with regard to the
brutal Nazi regime, it should remind us of the things people are capable
of doing''.
Today in Germany, there is a small minority content to live in the
past. They are actively involved in racial attacks upon those who, they
say, do not belong to Germany and have no place within the Fatherland.
Rainer believes that the ''lies which they spread have to be fought with
any legal means possible''.
The German Government is doing just that. Neo-Nazi propaganda has been
seized and those who distribute it have been charged. Some of the
material that the police had confiscated was music produced by
right-wing skinhead bands from the United Kingdom.
In Germany on May 8, Vice-President Gore, Prime Minister Major,
President Yeltsin, and President Weizacker will stand together and
remember the day of Germany's capitulation. The saddest part of all is
that there are those who are so blind and deaf to the new day that they
assume the war continues and still they play with the toys that bear the
mark of the forbidden swastika.

ALLIED TACTICS CONCERNING PROSECUTION OF FINAL STAGES ARE REMARKED
UPON. THE NEED FOR BOLD, DECISIVE STROKES ARE DISCUSSED.
TEN weeks after the first waves of British, Canadian, and American
infantry stormed ashore across the fire-swept beaches of Normandy on
June 6, 1944, German military strength in the West had been reduced to
fragments of shattered units.
The Wehrmacht had bled itself dry in Caen, the Falaise Gap, and the
disastrous counter-attack at Mortain. By insisting that his troops fight
for every hedgerow, Hitler had condemned two complete armies to
piecemeal destruction. His order of the day that no German soldier was
to take a single step back became a death sentence for tens of
thousands.
No coherent defensive line stood between the triumphant Allied forces
and the borders of the Reich itself. The industrial powerhouse of the
Ruhr lay ripe and open for the picking.
The moment for a bold, decisive stroke had arrived. If If it had been
seized, the war might easily have finished six months early. It could,
in the cynical and time-honoured phrase, have been well and truly over
by Christmas, 1944.
The potential of a rapid thrust at Germany's heart was filled with
geopolitical implications. If the Allies reached Berlin first, Soviet
ambitions for domination of much of Eastern Europe might have been
seriously curtailed.
It would have entailed the risk of direct confrontation with the
advancing Soviets and a new war at a time when Britain was drained and
infinitely war-weary. But it would, too, have offered possibilities for
immense diplomatic leverage when the shooting stopped.
There was also the question of saving Allied lives at a time when
Britain was running short of manpower for frontline units. Five years of
war -- two of them standing alone -- had seen the bottom of the barrel
scraped clean as far as fresh reserves were concerned.
The Americans were now the main provider of men and material on a
ratio approaching three-to-one. With justification, they used that
provision to hijack overall command of the war effort in the West.
The Ruhr was still producing 51% of Germany's hard coal and 50% of her
crude steel. Without these resources, the output of arms and ammunition
would have been crippled beyond redemption.
And if the Ruhr and the Rhineland fell to a coup de main, it would
matter little what forces the Wehrmacht could scrape together and put
into the field. Without the basic sinews of war, they would have been
propelled into a hopeless military situation where surrender or
annihilation were the only options.
Paris fell on August 25. US General George Patton crossed the Meuse
six days later and was at Metz on the Moselle a day after that. The
Guards Armoured Division made a slashing, 75-mile advance in a single
day and motored into a jubliant Brussels on September 3. Their
colleagues in 11th Armoured took Antwerp on the 4th. All port facilities
were intact and ready to begin unloading supplies.
Contrary to public perception, then and now, the German armies which
carried out the blitzkrieg conquest of Poland and Western Europe were
not equipped with lavish numbers of tanks or personnel carriers.
Two-thirds of their transport was horse-drawn. Their infantry was a
marching force.
Wehrmacht divisions had lost 34,000 tracked and wheeled vehicles in
the Normandy fighting. Fewer than half had been replaced from overworked
factories struggling to supply both the West and the Eastern Front.
What remained of the army in the West was scattered and relatively
immobile. With its internal rail system smashed by continuous air
attack, it did not possess the ability to concentrate rapidly to meet a
sudden threat. To add to its troubles, the Luftwaffe was a spent force.
All of these factors combined to force the Wehrmacht to spread its
resources thinly along the line from the North Sea to the Swiss border.
There could be no certainty as to where the Allied blow or blows would
fall.
Montgomery, Britain's leading general, had already foreseen the
potential advantage. Even before Allied units closed the noose on the
Falaise Gap, he was arguing strongly that a mass of 40 divisions
belonging to 12th and 21st Army groups should be held together and
concentrated in a single, unstoppable punch to the north.
Given German weakness, such a hammer blow could have only one outcome.
Post-war records have revealed that the sole formed fighting unit
between Montgomery and his thrust to the heart of the Ruhr at that time
was an understrength, 8000-man German parachute division, spread thinly
over a 100-mile front.
Monty, normally a plodding, methodical commander whose greatest
victories were achieved by the slow build-up of overwhelming resources
and firepower, had for once grasped the need for a swift decision
followed by swift action.
When he met General Dwight D Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander,
on August 23, he put a powerful case for the single-punch approach. He
also argued that logistical lines stretching back to the UK could not
maintain the impetus of two army groups and four armies spread across a
broad front.
However, Eisenhower, a soldier who had never held a combat command
before D-Day, had other priorities. He wanted Patton, the flamboyant
commander of the US Third Army, to sweep east to link up with forces
advancing from southern France, while the US 1st Army closed to the
German frontier at Cologne.
On September 1, Eisenhower, always more of a statesman than a fighting
soldier, assumed overall operational command of all Allied armies.
Montgomery chafed at the bit as the supply problems he had predicted
began to mount.
At that stage, there were fewer than 100 German Panzers along the
entire front. The Allied spearheads fielded more than 2000. The
Luftwaffe had 570 aircraft against 14,000. There were chasms rather than
gaps in the Wehrmacht's order-of-battle.
But the Germans were never slow to respond to a challenge. While
Eisenhower dithered and fuel and ammunition for his spreading forces had
to be trucked over ever-greater distances, they scraped up every man,
gun, and vehicle they could salvage from the wreckage of the retreat
from Normandy.
The two American armies to Montgomery's south now required 10,500 tons
of supplies a day. Even with the usual American gift for improvisation,
and the start of the Red Ball Express -- a unique convoy system which
ignored conventional rules and drove round the clock with lights on --
only 7000 tons could be delivered.
British problems were also growing acute. Most of Montgomery's heavy
guns were stranded west of the Seine, and the daily supply was cut from
16,000 tons to just 7000. The advance was grinding to a halt.
In just two weeks, the Germans threw together a coherent and dogged
defence line to buy even more time. Back inside the Reich, a Herculean
effort began to raise, train, and arm a new army for counter-attack.
Depleted and exhausted units were pulled back from the Eastern Front to
rest and regroup.
By mid-September, the chance for a lightning stroke to rival those of
the Germans in the early years of the war had gone, and Allied troops
were committed to another nine months of bitter fighting.
Yet Montgomery had not abandoned the concept of a bold advance to
shorten the war. With only two instead of four armies under his command,
he still planned to push luck and his troops to the limit.
He and his staff came up with Operation Market Garden, a risky project
aimed at launching 35,000 lightly-armed paratroopers in a concerted drop
to seize key bridges over the Rhine as a conduit for rapid armoured
follow-up.
The catch was that the armour and artillery essential if they were to
be relieved before the Germans counter-attacked to destroy them were
confined to a single, raised, and narrow road, with flooded polder on
either side.
The plan also ignored reports from the Dutch resistance that German
armoured formations had been moved into the area of the bridge at
Arnhem, the target furthest from the Allied lines and the one which
would be relieved last.
On September 17, the men of the British 1st Airborne Division and the
US 82nd and 101st divisions began to drop over Eindhoven, Nijmegen, and
Arnhem. The main British drop zone was eight miles from Arnhem itself,
and 64 miles behind enemy lines.
After heavy fighting, the US troops took both of their objectives. Sir
Brian Horrocks's 30th British Corps began its push north, spearheaded by
the tanks of the Irish Guards. The timetable called for a link-up at
Arnhem in two days.
Meanwhile, only one depleted battalion of British Paras made it to the
Arnhem Bridge. It hung on there for nine desperate days and nights,
waiting for relief that never came and fighting off elements of two
Panzer divisions before being forced to surrender.
To their rear, 30th Corps was stalled on the road, a trail of blazing
Sherman tanks and dead British infantry in its wake. Outside of Arnhem,
the rest of the British airborne soldiers were slowly pushed back into a
tiny perimeter.
A handful of survivors finally broke out, swimming the river to
escape. A Polish brigade parachuted in to reinforce them at the last
minute landed on a drop zone occupied by the Germans. Its men were
slaughtered as they came down. The zone was littered with Paras lying
dead in their harness or draped from trees.
More men died in Market Garden than in the D-Day landings. More than
7500 of the 10,000 men who landed at Arnhem became casualties. Total
Allied losses in dead, wounded, and missing amounted to 17,000.
Horrocks's troops, striving to push forward to rescue the Paras,
sustained another 7000.
It was a desperate gamble, the last gambit for a quick end-game. The
war dragged on until May 1945, and the Wehrmacht had its own last hour
of glory when it hurled a newly-formed Panzer army at the Americans in
the Ardennes during Christmas 1944. More than 80,000 US servicemen were
captured, killed, or wounded.
And yet, it could all have gone so differently.

A FIVE-YEAR-OLD girl was sexually assaulted by a man who dragged her
into a car, then dumped her 40 miles away, police said last night.
The girl, wearing only a lilac anorak, was found at midnight by a taxi
driver at Darlington, County Durham, as police searched at Newcastle
upon Tyne.
Police are now hunting the man who bundled her into his battered white
car as she played with friends in the Moulton Court shopping area of
Blakelaw, Newcastle.
Blakelaw is just off the southbound carriageway of the A1 western
bypass of Newcastle which leads on to the A1(M).
The girl was found more than three hours after disappearing at a
stretch of the A68 which branches from the motorway as it bypasses
Darlington. She was reunited with her mother, who has five other
children, and was examined at a Newcastle hospital.
Detective Chief Inspector Chris Symonds told a news conference last
night that police believe the child was sexually assaulted.
''At the time she was found by the taxi driver she was in an undressed
state. We are now looking for her red and black T-shirt and white lycra
cycling shorts.'' He appealed for anyone finding them and her white
socks and black boots to contact his team immediately.
Police did not immediately confirm the girl had been a sex attack
victim but as a result of medical tests and an interview with her they
were now certain she was.
Mr Symonds could not rule out the possibility that the pervert might
strike again, and urged all parents to make sure they know who their
children are with and where they are.
Mr Symonds said: ''We have reason to believe she was approached by a
male person who pushed her into a car which was parked nearby in Moulton
Place.'' The car was described as white and oldish looking. It may have
had a scrape mark or scratches on one or other of the front doors.
Police are anxious to hear from anyone who might have seen this car in
Moulton Place or surrounding streets between 8pm and midnight or in the
area where the girl was found at Darlington.
The man the police are seeking is described as tall and slim with
short dark hair and wearing a watch.
Taxi driver Darren Lambert, 27, said he was driving along the road
when he spotted the girl and realised something was wrong because it was
so late and she was alone.
''Anyone would have been concerned about a youngster walking alone at
that time of night. I asked her where her mum and dad were and she said
they were at home,'' he said.
''Immediately alarm bells started ringing in my head. I knew from her
accent she was not local. When I asked where she lived she said
somewhere near Newcastle.
''She said she was waiting for a friend who was looking for a dog. I
just said 'Come on, you are coming with me'. It was only when I picked
her up I noticed she had nothing on under her coat.
''I have a five-year-old daughter myself and it makes me sick to think
what someone had done to this poor girl. I was almost in tears as I
drove her to the police station.''

THE Queen yesterday expressed her hope for peace as she paid tribute
to the heroes who had given their lives for freedom.
At a ceremony in Westminster Hall to mark the 50th anniversary of the
end of the Second World War, senior representatives from both the
Commons and the Lords were present to help set the tone for the Victory
in Europe celebrations.
Joy was mixed with sadness as tunes from the war, played by the Band
of the Scots Guards, were mixed with glowing tributes, a one-minute
silence, and speeches.
The Queen inserted a note of humour when she recalled her own
experience as a member of the ATS. She said: ''There, I learned a little
about driving and the workings of the internal combustion engine, and
much about the strength and happiness of comradeship. I have never
forgotten either lesson -- even the former still stands me in good stead
from time to time.''
In her more serious comments, however, the Queen said she was
delighted to join with both Houses of Parliament in giving heartfelt
thanks. ''Together,'' she said, ''we thank God for the victorious end to
that titanic struggle of 50 years ago.''

AS THE devastated Tories began a long weekend of soul-searching last
night, the Chancellor's decision not to raise interest rates provoked
another storm for the party.
Mr Kenneth Clarke confounded City expectations of a 0.5% rate rise,
and was accused of taking a short-term political decision in the wake of
the local elections massacre.
There was widespread speculation in the City the move was at odds with
the advice he had received from the Governor of the Bank of England, Mr
Eddie George. Sterling fell sharply in the wake of the decision.
Despite these setbacks to party and sterling, there was a clear
message to disgruntled Tory MPs that there should be no challenge to Mr
Major.
Trade President Michael Heseltine declared: ''I don't think it's the
Prime Minister's fault. I personally share responsibility as does the
rest of the Cabinet.'' He was backed in his statement by other leading
Ministers.
More than half (2027) the 4000 disputed seats were lost, demolishing
their heartlands and their political powerbase, the worst-ever local
election results for the Tories.
England and Wales followed Scotland as a virtual wipe-out for the
Tories who now face an almost hopeless task in retaining power in two
years' time.
However, there was no move to gainsay the defiant Prime Minister who
said he was staying on at No 10. ''I have never run away from a
difficulty in my life and I don't intend to do so now.''
'''I don't make excuses,'' he said in Downing Street after staying up
until 1am watching as the results of a Labour and Liberal Democrat
pincer-movement developed into the Tory catastrophe. ''We have thus far
failed to persuade people that the long-term policies I am following are
right for the country. I believe that we will be able to persuade them
they are right and I shall seek to continue to do so.''
The results mean that, from April 1 next year, the Tories will control
none of the 51 councils in Scotland and Wales, and only 13 of the 381 in
England, including one county council (Buckinghamshire).
Home Secretary Michael Howard and other Ministers made it clear that,
despite this disaster, the Tory plight would be worse if MPs tried to
ditch Mr Major like they did Margaret Thatcher.
The general Cabinet line is to forge on with present economic policies
and to get taxes down in the autumn. Stay-at-home Tories might then
start to come out and vote again.
However, yesterday's economic move continued to puzzle the City.
Neither Mr Clarke nor the Bank of England would throw any light on the
Governor's attitude. Suspicions of a rift between Steady Eddie and Canny
Ken, as the two men have been dubbed, will have to wait confirmation in
six weeks when the official minutes of yesterday's meeting are
published.
The foreign exchange markets feared the worst. The pound dropped by
more than two cents and two pfennigs.
The Chancellor and the Governor are next due to meet on June 7, but
there are fears in the City that a sterling crisis could force their
hand on rates before then.
Mr Clarke said that the decision had been based on the fact that the
economy, the ''puzzlingly'' strong GDP figures aside, appeared to be
slowing down to a more sustainable rate of growth following previous
rate rises and tax increases.
Whatever moves are made on the economy, many Tory MPs remain fearful
of losing their seats next time round now that their heartlands in the
South-east and elsewhere have proved to be susceptible to Labour.
Although a challenge to Mr Major is unlikely, they will want him to make
Ministerial changes, and all fingers are pointing at party chairman
Jeremy Hanley as one of the scapegoats.
Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the back-bench 1922 Committee, insisted
there was no mechanism for a leadership election before November. But he
was less dogmatic about the prospects for a reshuffle. ''There is no
doubt that there is anxiety about a number of issues that have perhaps
not been presented as expertly as they should have been.''
While nobody believes that local election results are fully reflected
in General Elections, it gives the Tories a queasy feeling that if they
did, Mr Tony Blair would be forming a 250-seat Commons overall majority
on a swing to Labour of about 15.5%. Mr Major has to produce something
dramatic. He has never so much needed a fresh start.
Labour leader Mr Blair senses this and insisted yesterday that he
would not allow his party to become complacent.
The results ''unlocked the door'' to government, he told a Westminster
news conference, but added: ''We are well placed to do battle with this
Government, but there is much more work to do and we do not stop to
celebrate. We carry on with the task in hand.''
Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown claimed a ''high new watermark''
from the elections. ''We have beaten the Tories into being the third
party of local government in Britain. ''The Government should now listen
or go.''

HITLER'S deputy Martin Bormann was smuggled into Britain at the end of
the war, it was claimed yesterday.
According to the report, he lived in the Highgate area of north London
and was later moved to an English village before his death in the 1960s.
The secret involved James Bond author Ian Fleming, and the Nazi hoards
of hundreds of millions of pounds.
The allegation is in a book, yet to be published but whose contents
are known to a former senior intelligence officer, Mr Milton Shulman.
Mr Shulman, a theatre critic, said: ''I am as convinced by it as
anybody can be convinced at anything involving Martin Bormann.''
The book claims that Bormann, whose fate at the end of the war has
remained a mystery, was brought to Britain to authorise the release of
the Nazi money.
Mr Shulman, who refused to name the author, said two or three
publishers had paid money for the book, then dropped it. ''I don't know
whether it's going to come out or why there's been this delay: perhaps
the publishers are frightened,'' he said.
''The book says that Bormann was brought here just before the end of
the war in an operation involving James Bond author Ian Fleming, who
served in naval intelligence, and 400 other people, of whom five or six
were killed.
''The reason was that, as Hitler's heir, Bormann had the sole right to
authorise Swiss banks to hand over hundreds of millions of pounds that
had come into German hands. Nobody knows what happened to the money.''
''He started off in Highgate, north London then moved to an English
village, and died in 1963 or 1964.
''It's a sensational story because it would mean the British were
harbouring a war criminal at the same time as he was being convicted of
war crimes at Nuremberg.''
Bormann's fate has remained one of the enduring mysteries of the war.
He was variously reported to have killed himself in the rubble of
Berlin, or to have escaped to Argentina or Paraguay.
Mr Shulman, whose book Defeat in the West has just been re-published,
came to wartime Britain as an officer in the Canadian Armoured Corps.
In 1943, he was posted to the arm of the British intelligence dealing
with the German Order of Battle. Before D-Day, he was the Canadian
army's expert on the strength and tactics of German divisions the
British and Canadian forces could meet when they invaded.
From D-Day to the end of the war, he wrote a daily report on
Intelligence matters which earned a mention in dispatches. In the months
after the war, he interviewed 28 of the most senior German generals,
including Sepp Dietrich, Hitler's most powerful SS commander.

TWO workers from Edinburgh were among five people killed yesterday in
a terrorist attack by Islamic fundamentalists in Algeria.
Gunmen burst into Anibib pipe mill at Ghardaia, 300 miles south of
Algiers, and started shooting at random. Two French nationals and a
Tunisian were also killed as were three soldiers brought in to guard
them.
The men employed by Leith-based British Pipe Coaters were later named
as Mr Alan Wilson, originally from Newcastle, and Mr Jim McGarry, a
Canadian national. Both lived in Edinburgh and had worked on many
overseas projects. They had been in Algeria for around six weeks.
Mr Wilson, 44, of Northfield, Edinburgh, and his Scots-born wife,
Diane, have four children, aged between four and 16.
Last night, a relative said: ''We're all so upset. We don't know how
Alan died, only that he and his friends were ambushed.
''There is so much red tape involved in getting any information
through from Algeria.''
Mr McGarry, 46, from Edmonton, was married with three teenage
children. He lived with his family in the Barnton area.
The men were among a party of 10 expatriates working at the site
around 300 miles south of Algiers. Five of their colleagues, including
another Briton, escaped unhurt.
British Pipe Coaters, which is jointly owned by British Gas and
Bredero Price, was carrying out sub-contracted work for Bechtel, the
US-based engineering company. It immediately evacuated the five
survivors in the same team to a base camp at Mecheria.
The British charge d'affaires in Algiers, Mr Peter Marshall, yesterday
protested to the Algerian Interior Minister over the failure of military
protection at the heavily-guarded site.
Around 280 British nationals, mostly oil and gas workers, are still in
Algeria, which has been ravaged by civil war for the last two years. An
estimated 40,000 people have died including 82 foreign nationals.
Islamic extremists have targeted foreigners, particularly the French,
in their battle to overthrow the military-backed Government since the
authorities cancelled elections in 1992 which the fundamentalists were
poised to win.
The Foreign Office has long advised Britons not to travel to Algeria
and for those staying to quit unless they felt they had sufficient
personal protection. The British Ambassador was recalled in February and
his return is under review.
An official statement from the Algerian news agency APS said the five
were killed by ''armed terrorists'' in the early-morning attack.
The killings resembled a December 1993 raid in which assailants slit
the throats of 12 Croats at their work site near Blida, south of
Algiers.
