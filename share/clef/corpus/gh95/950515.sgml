WHERE has Michael Forsyth been for the last 16 years? The Scots have
experienced his ''open'' society at work and expressed their opinion of
it at the polls some six weeks ago.
Society was given by the Conservatives to the businessmen and
entrepreneurs and they lined their own pockets or went bankrupt. The
truth is that businessmen can only run their own businesses, they cannot
run the country. We need statesmen for that and, unfortunately, the
Conservatives no longer have any.
The present Winston Churchill is hardly of the calibre of his
grandfather and there is no Macmillan who collected his old age pension
with pride and upbraided Margaret Thatcher for ''selling the family
silver'' when she began the privatisation of Britain.
Open is a good word for Michael Forsyth's plans. The Scots people can
see right through him.
We have seen what his education policies do to schools. Teachers are
being sacked and class sizes increased to save money. But those with
plenty of money ensure that their children are taught in small classes.
The ''open'' society of Michael Forsyth means that democratic control
is destroyed and Government dictators appoint quangos full of placemen
to run public affairs despite voters' protests.
Michael Forsyth calls for the end of ''sixties'' education. By this he
means the end of comprehensive education which allows all children at
least the chance of equal opportunity. He states that we must not
''impose a false equality upon people of unequal abilities''. In other
words he wants to bring back the discredited 11+ if not exams at even
earlier stages.
The fact that poverty, brought back by his, and the Adam Smith
Institute's, policies over the past 15 years has already destroyed
equality of education for many people does not matter to him. He ignores
this and advocates more of the same.
He talks of unleashing a creative storm of money to provide a
privatised infrastructure. How many years are we talking about now?
Sixteen years would have seemed a reasonable time for any capable
Government to have brought about worthwhile changes in the lives of the
citizens of a country but I have not seen any storms of money, creative
or otherwise, generated by the Conservative Government.
All the voters hear from them is their smug ''cut, cut and cut
again''. If they cannot get teachers and nurses to subsidise pupils and
patients by taking less than the going rate for their work then they
change the conditions of service to such an extent that experienced
people cannot wait to take early retirement.
Strathclyde did more for us than the Conservative Government so they
destroyed it at huge and wasteful expense to the voter. They suffered
some retribution at the polls as a result and the Scots will not forget
them at the General Election.
We know the Tories cost us more. Scottish electricity customers had to
pay extra on their bills to pay for Torness but now that is to be stolen
from us to reduce taxes to buy middle England votes. These voters may be
taken in by short-term advantage, but the Scots have had enough of the
Con-men.
Even during and in the aftermath of the last war we did not have
destitute people lying about our streets. The fact that we have them now
after 16 years of Tory rule tells us all we need to know about the
present Conservative politicians.

FROM the remarks made by Ian Lang at the recent Tory Conference in
Glasgow, it's pretty apparent that even yet the penny hasn't dropped on
the reasons for his party's disastrous local election results.
If a diner in a restaurant is served up an unpalatable meal, he is not
likely to go back there again, but will go somewhere else in future.
To rubbish the views of other political parties seems a peculiar way
to try to endear yourself to potential voters. Policies that may suit
the south-east of England are very different from the poliices more in
tune for Scotland with its harsher climate and differing needs.
It may well be that Ian Lang is seeking historical martyrdom as the
English-orientated unionist politician who galvanised the Scots into
reclaiming their nationhood, and finally throwing off the shackles of
colonialism which have stifled us for so long.

I DOUBT if anyone attending the European Foundation's fringe meeting,
with Bill Cash, MP, as the speaker, would have recognised your report of
events (May 12).
First, your article emphasised Mr Cash's supposed support for
increasing delegated powers to Scotland. In actual fact one of the
biggest cheers of the evening came when he made clear he opposed
Scottish devolution.
Secondly, I find it disappointing that you emphasise his alleged views
on Scotland. The fringe meeting's message was to warn of the dangers to
Scotland, and Britain, of following a route towards a Federal Europe.
Mr Cash pinpointed the undemocratic nature of European institutions,
the increasing mesh of regulatory diktat, and the grave economic and
social risks of a single currency.
Finally, the emphatic message of the meeting was that in this TV age
Bill Cash was able to attract an audience of nearly 200, the vast
majority of whom made it quite clear they felt great unease about the
direction of the European Union.
The size of the attendance amply demonstrates that public opinion in
Scotland is swinging in the direction of the sceptics.

ONE disturbing aspect of Saturday night's marathon at the Kelvin Hall
was that the young Scottish boxers on the bill were given a back seat,
writes Jim Reynolds.
With the exception of Glasgow lightweight Tanver Ahmed, the Scots, who
have been promised exposure in Sky Television's lucrative deal with
promoter Frank Warren, were left to perform late into the night and on
into Sunday morning when most of the fans had left for home.
Boxing began at around 6.45 and Ahmed stretched his record to 11 wins
in a dozen contests when he knocked out Nottingham's Joe O'Johnson after
1min.34sec. of the third round with a beautiful left cross.
It was not until after 11pm that the next Scots were seen,
light-welters James Clamp and Craig Lynch, who boxed a draw over six
rounds.
Featherweight Brian Carr, from Moodiesburn, was most impressive in
stopping Paul Wynn, from Gateshead, who retired at the end of the second
round. The official verdict was that he had damaged a hand, but Carr had
inflicted heavy punishment. It was the Scot's fourth straight win as a
professional.
Scottish bantamweight champion James Murray, from Cleland, clearly
outpointed Bournemouth's Danny Ruegg over six rounds. And Glasgow welter
Gordon Blair forced Hartlepool's Kevin McKenie to retire at the end of
the fourth round with bad cuts around both eyes. Other results:
Heavyweight -- Scott Welch (Great Yarmouth) beat Eduardo Carranza
(Argentina) k.o. 1st rd.
Light-heavy -- Darren Ashton (Stoke) beat Stefan Wright (Peterborough)
6rds.
Middle -- Chris Pyatt (Islington) beat Anthony Ivory (U.S.) 8rds;
Cornelius Carr (Middlesbrough) beat Chris Richards (Nottingham) ret.
3rd.
Light-welter -- Paul Ryan (Hackney) beat Jorge Ramirez Aqiuno
(Dominican Republic) rsc 4th rd.
Super feather -- Justin Juuko (Uganda) beat Peter Till (Walsall) ret.

DUNDEE is recruiting neighbourhood referees to act as peacemakers in
noisy stair-head rows.
The Community Mediation Scheme, the first of its type in Scotland,
will be funded by the Scottish Office.
Volunteers will be trained to bring peace to feuding families and
neighbours. They will be brought in only where both warring parties
agree, and will visit disputes in pairs as a safety precaution.
The scheme, intended to cut down on police involvement in local
disputes, is already operating successfully in England.
The project is backed by Dundee District Council and Tayside police,
who have appointed a liaison officer to work with the group's management
committee.
Kathy Wiles, assistant co-ordinator of the project, said: ''We are
looking for good listeners and communicators. They don't have to be
highly educated or experienced.''
Tayside police have also appointed the region's first Domestic
Violence Liaison Officer, WPC Kathleen McIrvine.
She will follow up incidents with a telephone call or further visit to
victims to ensure that they are aware of help available from other
support agencies, such as Women's Aid.

I CAN reveal that in response to the potential player drain south of
the Border, the Scottish Rugby Union has approached its sponsors to help
find jobs for some of this country's top young rugby players -- one of
whom is Gregor Townsend -- and the SRU's director of rugby is to look at
setting up more rugby scholarships at universities.
Some have argued for a long time that the most sensible way of
approaching the whole question of professionalism is to generate a
partnership between employers and rugby that keeps the reality of a
proper career alongside a rugby one as a core of the sport, and that is
how the SRU are proceeding. Top players will become full-time pros, but
this is great news.
All of the players who went on Scotland's short tour to Spain filled
in a questionnaire asking for details of their work habits and career
aspirations. The answers proved revealing.
''The biggest problem players seem to come across in their work
environment is asking their bosses for time off work,'' says SRU
director of rugby, Jim Telfer.
''We have to make sure that we keep our best players playing in this
country by finding them jobs. Then we have to create an environment --
especially when you consider that as a country we tour a lot -- that
means that the players can forget about pressures of work when they are
with the team.''
Gregor Townsend is, perhaps, the biggest name to have threatened to
depart for England next season chasing a career in corporate finance,
but he told me yesterday that he is one player being helped by the SRU.
''I am about to sit my exams in two weeks, but after that an interview
has been set up with a major bank, and we will see how things go,'' says
Townsend.
Telfer says that he hopes for more rugby scholarships that last longer
than normal degree courses. ''Some Universities have four-year courses
for sports scholarships, like St Andrews for golf,'' says the Director
of Rugby. ''We ourselves have a few rugby scholarships at Stirling
University. These courses last longer to let students take part in their
sport, and I am keen we expand this avenue.''
Like all of you, I suppose, I acknowledge that the best players in all
sports deserve to get as much money as they can for playing that sport,
and I want it that way. But the words that come back to haunt me are
those of some of the Scottish Claymores who told me the average career
of a top-level American footballer was ''two point two years''. Rugby,
one day, might be the same.
If there ever was to be an ideal way to go about getting Scottish
rugby as good as it can be, recognising that with all the will in the
world the majority of players who think they can have a career in rugby
or rugby related activity for life will end up one day in 9 to 5
employment, then this is it. I'm swallowing hard now, but here it comes
... well done SRU.

PETER O'Malley took a somewhat scenic route to his victory in the
Benson and Hedges International Open yesterday at St Mellion.
Having led by five strokes after 36 holes, he had an advantage of six
with four to play in the third round, reduced by error to two, and
actually fell a stroke behind after four holes of the final round.
But as Mark James, Costantino Rocca, and Carl Mason faltered at some
stage over the last three holes, the stocky 29-year-old Australian,
whose only previous European success came in the 1992 Scottish Open,
more successfully limited any damage to take the #108,330 first prize.
O'Malley's closing round of 73 gave him a total of 280 eight under
par, a stroke ahead of James and Rocca. Mason tied for fourth place on
282 with a revitalised Andrew Oldcorn, who shared with Sandy Lyle the
distinction of returning the day's lowest score, a 65, seven under the
par of the exacting 7054-yard course, and Colin Montgomerie.
Although O'Malley bogeyed two of the first four holes he played
contained golf from then on. He followed seven successive par figures
with birdies at the long twelfth and the thirteenth, which restored him
to a lead he never surrendered, although Rocca drew level with birdies
at the short fourteenth and the fifteenth.
But the Italian, third in Milan last week and second in two other
tournaments, had to be content with consolidating his place on the Ryder
Cup points table. Unburdened by that concern O'Malley, unexpectedly
granted the dispensation of a two-stroke lead playing the last, could
afford to bogey the hole and still win.
In seven previous events Oldcorn's best finish was forty-second and
the 35-year-old Bolton-born professional attributed this transformation
to two factors -- the premier division survival of Hearts, the team of
his adoption, and a two-hour consultation with Richard Cox, a sports
psychologist recommended to him by Scotland's rugby captain Gavin
Hastings.
''I needed to speak to a stranger who knew what he was talking
about,'' said Oldcorn. ''So he should be pleased with me when I see him
again before the Scottish Professional Championship starts on Thursday.
Until I spotted a leaderboard at the eleventh I didn't realise I had a
chance to win but I didn't back off.''
Indeed, having had seven birdies in the first 11 holes and turned in
31, five under, Oldcorn was disappointed not to have had more gains over
the last seven holes. ''But the point was,'' he added, ''I did play well
and I had all the good luck I needed which had been missing so far this
year.''
Lyle's most recent finish in the first 10 was 12 months ago in the PGA
Championship and his re-entry coincided with his being reunited with an
Australian caddie, Roger Morgan. His last association with the
37-year-old former Open and Masters Champion was in the Volvo Masters in
1992, when Lyle beat Montgomerie in a play-off.
Unresentful over subsequent adverse publicity, Lyle acknowledged: ''I
deserved to be criticised and at least it showed that people were still
interested in me. Being in the doldrums has added a few extra grey hairs
but this was something like the old Lyle and moving my hands forward at
the putting address got the ball rolling on awkward greens.''
So effectively, in fact, that in halves of 31-34 Lyle had 24 putts
including nine singles, ranging from inches to 40 feet, and a 30 foot
chip-in at the short fourth for the third of his eight birdies. Lyle
added: ''It's been a long time since I walked up the seventy-second hole
making a score and I've proved to myself I can do it again on a tough
course.''
For some reason Montgomerie has been regularly frustrated by one
damaging score here over the years, not difficult on a course as
treacherous as this. After having made 11 birdies in his first 34 holes
he had to wait for 32 more holes until he was able to extract the next
advance.
At which point the supply quickly turned into a flood. Montgomerie
made birdies at five of the last seven holes to be home in 31, jointly
the lowest inward half of the week with the South African Wayne Westner,
whose 66 was second only to the scores of Oldcorn and Lyle.
Leading scores (British or Irish unless stated):
280 -- P O'Malley (Australia) 68, 65, 74, 73 (#108,330).
281 -- M James 71, 68, 71, 71; C Rocca (Italy) 72, 73, 64, 72 (#56,450

West Ham 1, Manchester United 1
IF bitter disappointment and deep satisfaction can be fellow
travellers they were on the Manchester United bus along with Alex
Ferguson as it made its way up the M6 last night.
His team's outrageous attempt to steal the Premiership title from
Kenny Dalglish's Blackburn had failed, but only in a photo finish.
Ferguson, at heart, never really thought his team was a serious bet
after having been eight points behind a few weeks ago, but he brought
his side to the east end of London in the kind of confident mood that
sometimes achieves remarkable results in football. And it nearly came
off.
Ferguson said: ''I have to say our players were marvellous. We had a
few chances especially in the last 15 minutes, but it was not for us. I
don't think we could have done any more.
''We came from a long way behind and almost grabbed the championship
at the last gasp, but all credit to Blackburn. Any team that gets 89
points deserves to win the title. Most leagues are won in the mid-80s.
They've gone well beyond that which is because of us.
''Fate's like that. It was a marvellous, fantastic performance -- you
get your money's worth watching us.
''We had a few chances over the last 15 minutes and the players were
convinced there was a definite penalty when Breacker played the ball
away with his hands. But that's the way it goes sometimes.
''What makes it more disappointing was Liverpool winning. But we could
not have done more. I'm proud of my players. Over the past four years
we've contested four championships and lost only 22 games out of 168.
That's absolutely magnificent and they can be proud of themselves.''
United came so close to scoring the goal that would have given them
their third successive premiership that they will look back for a long
time in disbelief that they failed.
The happenings up the motorway at Anfield had immense influence on
what was going on at Upton Park. In the first half, news of Blackburn's
opening goal deflated the entire Manchester party, players and fans, but
the word of John Barnes' equaliser in the second half galvanised them
just as powerfully.
Rarely has there been such a dramatic, draining afternoon endured by
any team's fans and, as I was sat in the midst of them, I can vouch for
that with every certainty.
Optimism was followed by dejection then by elation and then, well,
just exhaustion.
If Manchester United had cleared their final hurdle it might have been
rough on Dalglish and Blackburn, but there is no question they would
have warranted a victory at Upton Park.
Had they made use of their early superiority maybe it would have all
turned out differently.
For about 20 minutes it looked as if they would take West Ham apart
and send waves of apprehension down the wires to Anfield. Instead, the
opposite happened and when the Hammers' fans, on hearing of the
Blackburn goal, goaded their opposite numbers in the centenary stand,
the visitors, maybe on the field as well as off it, sensed the game was
up. If only they had known what was to come.
Whatever the case, a telepathy that transmits from stands to pitch
also inspired West Ham who had scarcely been in the contest until that
point, even if they had hit the bar.
Within a few minutes, they had taken the lead, a splendidly executed
goal by Michael Hughes, and the Old Trafford side seemed to descend into
a dwam.
It took them a few minutes to appreciate that there was still a match
to be won and they gradually worked their way back into the game.
They had dominated earlier on with confident and thoughtful football,
but created only a few chances and, after that goal by Hughes, Andy Cole
produced the best effort of the first half with a tremendous shot which
hit a post.
They came out with Mark Hughes on for Nicky Butt in the second half
and went at West Ham with a vigour and purpose that once again
threatened to leave the Londoners in their wake.
When Brian McClair, who had a fine game, headed in the equaliser
within six minutes of restart, an away victory seemed certain,
especially after news of the Barnes equaliser for Liverpool lifted the
entire travelling circus from Manchester.
Chances came and went, great saves by the West Ham keeper were mixed
with missed opportunities and a loud claim for hand ball in the penalty
area which was ignored until in the end, United had to accept it was not
to be their day.
By the time the Liverpool winner reached the Upton Park stands there
was no time left to mount an even more determined siege.
Now they move on to next week's FA Cup final. They can't miss out
again, can they?

RAITH Rovers manager Jimmy Nicholl has scooped Scotland's Manager of
the Year award. And Rangers' Brian Laudrup has completed a double as the
Scottish Professional Footballers Association Players' Player of the
Year.
Nicholl has been voted Bell's League Championship Manager of the Year
after having steered Raith to a remarkable Coca-Cola Cup and first
division championship double.
The 38-year-old player-manager was nominated by the Press while Danish
player Laudrup was named top man by his fellow professionals after
already winning the Scottish Football Writers' Player of the Year title.
His Rangers team-mate Charlie Miller was named as Young Player of the
Year by the SPFA, with Raith striker Stephen Crawford the top man in the
first division.
Morton captain Derek McInnes took the second-division award and
Forfar's David Bingham earned the third-division trophy.
The awards were presented last night at a special dinner in Glasgow by
Lord Macfarlane, chairman of United Distillers, although Laudrup was
unable to attend.
Falkirk manager Jim Jefferies took the premier-division managerial
award, while Morton's Allan McGraw and Forfar's Tommy Campbell took the
managers' honours in divisions two and three respectively.

GEORGE Fulston will discover today whether or not he has succeeded in
his attempt to oust former Celtic director Jack McGinn as vice-president
of the SFA, whose members will gather in Glasgow for their annual
meeting, and if he wins the vote, the Falkirk chairman will waste no
time in making his presence known.
Fulston is running for office on a point of principle believing, as
many others within football do, that McGinn should not be in line to
become next president of the association because he no longer holds a
directorship with a club.
McGinn, of course, was removed from the board at Celtic Park when
managing director Fergus McCann started to move the company forward, but
McGinn remains the club's appointed representative to the SFA.
Celtic's former chairman Kevin Kelly also was removed, but the
Scottish League felt they could no longer accommodate him without a
directorship, and some on that same body have been unhappy about
McGinn's continued presence as an office-bearer of the SFA.
It was indicated to Fulston that he stand against McGinn, who was
elected two years ago, at today's annual meeting in an attempt to
prevent the former director from eventually taking over the influential
post of president.
''I can't really say if I'll be successful,'' Fulston said. ''I have
nothing against Jack McGinn but his position has been discussed within
clubs.
''People in Scottish football know me and, even though I'm not
everyone's cup of tea, I'm happy enough to be judged on an honest and
open track record.
''If I am elected, you can be sure I'll have plenty to say about
various matters. I'll ask questions and I think I'll bring a freshness
to the position.''
That, of course, might have some in the association trembling already.

IT was grandly billed as ''One Step Beyond,'' and Saturday night's
promotion at the Kelvin Hall certainly proved that the hulking figure of
Mike Evans had taken one step beyond where he should have gone when he
was pummelled to defeat inside two rounds by Frank Bruno.
It is no fault of promoter Frank Warren, or Bruno, that once again the
big man, who is aiming for a fourth shot at the world title, had another
easy pay night. Other world-title aspirants don't want to fight the
Londoner. He has to find work somewhere and Evans was portrayed as a
''worthy, creditable opponent.''
The 19st 4[1/2]lb American certainly tried to do some work, which is
more than can be said for Bruno's last two opponents, Jesse Ferguson and
Rodolfo Marin.
He tried to survive, he got up off the canvas after having been decked
with a right hand, and in the first round he did, briefly, hit back.
But, as was earlier pointed out in these columns, Bruno will always
quickly knock out middle-of-the-road fighters because of his sheer
power. Evans was no more than that and we are no nearer to knowing
whether Bruno has improved sufficiently to win a world title.
What we do know is that in more than a year, Bruno has tasted only
around nine minutes of boxing in three contests -- something which has
most Americans squealing when he is mentioned as a world-title
contender.
But it is almost certain Bruno will now challenge WBC champion Oliver
McCall, the man who took the crown from Lennox Lewis. Frank Warren said:
''There are just a few little things we've got to fine tune, but it's
going to be, I hope, July 22 in London.''
Ibrox was well in the running to stage the bout -- Warren had looked
over the venue and was impressed -- but Saturday night's poor response
from the Scottish boxing public looks to have put paid to that option.
''Bruno is going to win the world title for Britain,'' said Warren.
''I really believe in my heart that he's going to beat Oliver McCall.''
Bruno, too, feels he will never have a better chance of winning the
richest prize in sport. ''I'm getting much more experience and I'm much
older,'' he said. ''I'm a little bit heavier and more positive. Evans
was a slippery old guy -- on the ropes and ducking and diving all over
the place. Oliver McCall won't do that -- he'll come straight at me.
''McCall is 16st 7lb and I think that's a bit too heavy for him, a
stone and a half heavy. I can't wait for it to happen. I know he has no
respect for me in the ring and I hope he keeps that up.''
Another dream came true for Bruno when he heard of Lennox Lewis's
victory over Lionel Butler in California. ''I lost to Lewis in Cardiff
for the title, but I would like very much to go in with him again,''
Bruno said.
He was at his heaviest ever (17st 10lb) for Saturday night and
immediately stamped his authority on the fight, ramming out a
piston-like left jab. He had Evans on the floor with a hook, but referee
Dave Parris ruled that it was a push and not a clean knock-down.
The lumbering American held on at every opportunity, but suddenly,
towards the end of the round, he landed with a left-right combination,
and Bruno had to backwards step. It was to be the only time Evans looked
anything like the part.
Bruno put him down for seven with a right hand early in the second,
and from then on it was just a matter of time. The end came with a left
hook which left Evans crumpled in the corner and this time he was
counted out.
Should Bruno beat McCall his next fight could be a rematch with Lennox
Lewis, who has been assured by World Boxing Council president Jose
Sulaiman that he will fight the winner of that encounter even though
Mike Tyson has been reinstalled as No.1 challenger without as much as a
warm-up fight.
Lewis eased himself back into action quietly against the crude Butler,
finishing him off with seconds left of the fifth round. The flabby
American had been decked for the second time in the round and when he
slumped down the ropes Californian referee Martin Denkin called it off.
Lewis is being lined-up to have a 10-round bout in Dublin on Sunday,
July 2, possibly against Ray Anis, who was in training and ready to step
in if there had been a late problem with Butler.
Former IBF and WBA champion Michael Moorer was a big disappointment in
outscoring late substitute Melvin Foster in his first bout since losing
his crowns to George Foreman last November.
In the chief supporting bout to the Bruno contest at Kelvin Hall,
Dennis Andries lost his British cruiserweight title to fellow-Londoner
Terry Dunstan on points, and although the 41-year-old protested
bitterly, 26-year-old Dunstan, in only his ninth professional contest,
was a clear winner.
He looks a real prospect, but is certainly not yet good enough to
showboat as much as he did on Saturday. Apart from it being
disrespectful to a man who has been a three-time world champion,
dropping his hands and sticking out his chin could also cause him
serious grief against a quick puncher.

KINGUSSIE'S relentless drive to re-write the record book continues
with their 5-0 national league triumph against Oban Camanachd at
Inverness on Saturday, their ninth consecutive success in this
competition.
The holders scored after less than a minute, Ally Dallas on the mark
with a long-range effort. Ronald Ross netted his sixty-first goal of the
season in eight minutes.
A Michael Clark double before half-time sealed Oban's fate, and Dave
Anderson made it five in 72 minutes.
Too many Oban players failed to deliver on the day, particularly in
midfield and attack.
At Drumnadrochit, Glenurquhart clinched the final north place in the
new premier league with a 4-2 victory over Fort William, their fourth
victory in a row.
In north Division 2, Kilmallie's 3-0 defeat of Caberfeidh ensured that
Strathglass were crowned champions.

PETER Blake's Team New Zealand completed a 5-0 sweep against Dennis
Conner's Stars &amp; Stripes team to claim the America's Cup for the first
time in their country's history.
The Kiwis, who were ahead throughout the five-race series, grabbed a
convincing one minute 50 second victory in San Diego yesterday.
Blake said: ''Little old New Zealand, that no-one thought would get
anywhere, has won the America's Cup. It's the second time in history
that it's left America -- I think that's pretty damn good.''
Blake's success adds to his triumph in the the Jules Verne trophy last
year for setting a non-stop round-the-world record, while Connor looks
set to be remembered as the only American to have lost the Cup twice.
After having become the first person to lose the America's Cup in
1983, he won it back from Australia in 1987 -- only to miss out again
this year.

TOP-RANKED Andre Agassi may face a fine for a swearing outburst after
having lost in the German Open.
ATP officials viewed a tape of Agassi's angry exchange with a
spectator in Hamburg and were sending the tape and a report to David
Cooper, administrator of regulations, who will then decide whether to
take any action.
After having lost against Sergi Bruguera in the quarter-finals, Agassi
was involved in an ugly exchange with a spectator who complained about
the quality of the match. As he picked up his bag to leave the court,
Agassi swore at him and said: ''Are you gonna get a knife and chase me
now?''
He was alluding to the April 1993 stabbing of Monica Seles at the same
court.
Meanwhile, defending champion Andrei Medvedev destroyed fourth seed
Goran Ivanisevic 6-3, 6-2, 6-1 in yesterday's final.

their CIS Insurance Counties championship campaign when they travelled
to Buckhaven on Saturday and went down 110-113 to Fife.

ABERDEEN University beat Aberdeen Boat Club for the overall
championship of the Dee by just one point at the North East Regatta. In
third place overall, just another two points behind, came George Heriots
school from Edinburgh.
Yesterday's racing produced several close results. In the Men's
Restricted Skulls Final, Bob Gibson, of Robert Gordon's University, and
Alistair Ritchie, of Strathclyde University, fought out a dead heat, but
a better start by Gibson in the re-row eventually gave him the title.
Another dead heat came in the final of Men's Restricted Fours when at
the second attempt, Aberdeen Boat Club managed to keep ahead of an
Aberdeen Schools-Aberdeen University composite crew which included
Scottish internationalists Richard Harris and Drew Hendry.

then notched the equaliser from the penalty spot five minutes later as
Porto keeper Vitor Bahia let in his first goals in eight league games.
Porto, however, took control after the break. In the first minute

THE Scottish Claymores gave up a 20-3 lead to fall to a crushing 33-27
defeat in overtime to Dusseldorf's Rhein Fire.
After having scored 17 points in the first half, the Scots crumbled in
the third-quarter, allowing the Germans to score twice in four minutes
to level at 20-20.
Touchdowns by both teams in the fourth quarter brought up the
overtime, but Claymores gave the ball back to Rhein when new kicker
Shawn Conley fumbled a punt attempt, and Fire recovered at the Scots
15-yard line.
On Rhein Fire's next play, running back Shambe Wright-Fair blasted
into the Scots endzone for the decisive score.
Claymores were impressive at the start. Middle linebacker Brian
Johnson stripped the ball from Rhein running back Ronald Williams on the
German's first possession and then set up Conley to boot through a
45-yard field goal.
At the start of the second quarter, tight end Dwayne Chandler dived
into the endzone on an eight-yard reverse play. Conley converted the
point-after to bring the score to 10-0.
Then Stacy bulldozed into the endzone from five yards on a power sweep
and Conley converted for a 17-0 half-time lead.
German kicker Andreas Schroder confidently booted two field goals,
both from 36 yards to keep Rhein Fire in touch at the start of the
second half.
Then Fire's replacement quarterback Andy Kelly passed to receiver Rod
Moore in the endzone to bring it back to 20-13 with the PAT good.
Claymores quarterback Matt Blundin kept his finger on the
self-destruct button when, on the Scots' next possession, he attempted
to pass to wide receiver Lee Harris. Rhein cornerback Vaughn Thomas
intercepted and ran the ball into the endzone. Schroder's extra point
tied the game at 20-20.
The Claymores were dealt a sucker punch at the start of the third
quarter. Their defense looked to have stopped Rhein at midfield, but
Kelly faked his kick, instead passing to running back Shambe Wright-Fire
for a first down.
Before the Scots could recover Kelly launched a 40-yard bomb pass,
again to Deron Pointer, who again beat Williams to run in the go-ahead
score. Schroder stayed perfect in PATs to make it 27-20.
Less than two minutes remained in regular time when Siran Stacy swept
into the endzone.Conley made good on the extra point to tie the scores
at 27.
Claymores won the vital coin toss to receive the overtime kick-off
but stuttered at their own 42-yard line when quarterback Blundin threw
incomplete to Allen DeGraffenreid. That forced the Scots to punt, but
Conley dropped the snap, recovered it and then tried to throw. His
attempt was grabbed by Andrea Motzkus and downed at the Claymores 15
setting up Wright-Fair to win the game on the next play.

THERE was contrasting fortunes for Scots in the Newcastle Breweries
Top of the North Novices Hurdle final at Newcastle on Saturday night.
Goldie, the Uplawmoor trainer, fresh from is maiden strike on the
Flat, saw last week's Ayr hero Keep Battling fail in his jumps follow-up
when brought down at the first.
Keep Battling, along with jockey Fraser Perratt, was unscathed and
happily continued to jump several steeplechase fences before pulling up.
However in the topsy turvy National Hunt game its an ill wind that
blows nobody any good and, with the main danger out of the race, it left
the door open for Tayside jockey Niven to swoop on 2-1 favourite
Jalcanto.
Niven, moving to within two of this third century of winners, booted
home the Mary Reveley trained gelding by six lengths. ''We thought we'd
be second or third because we couldn't see our horse giving two stone to
Keep Battling,'' Niven admitted.
''He seemed in great form when winning at Ayr on the Flat and it was a
lot of weight to concede to a horse in such good form.''
Niven, a jockey that faces a constant battle against the scales, will
be content to reach a three-figure total this season rather than trying
to beat his best score of 108, and plans to take a well-earned break
towards the beginning of June.
''Mrs Reveley hasn't a lot of horses left to run and races are harder
to win at this time of year,'' added the rider. ''But I'll be trying to
get the 100 up again at Perth on Wednesday or Thursday this week.''

THE French 1000 Guineas turned into a family affair at Longchamp
yesterday when Matiara compensated trainer Criquette Head and her jockey
brother Freddie for the defeat of Macoumba in the recent British
equivalent.
Matiara was all out to hold the late challenge of Carling, but the
Heads had to wait a little longer for their success when a steward's
enquiry was called for after a rough race.
The winner was involved in some barging four furlongs out with Cash
Asmussen's mount Piquetnol, but after having checked a film of the race,
Matiara was confirmed as the winner.
Criquette Head said: ''My filly really did not seem to quite last
home, so there must be a question mark about her running in next months
Prix De Diane.

DOMINANT Serenade can take advantage of a light weight to win the Tees
Handicap at Redcar today. Micky Hammond's runner will be having his
first run on the Flat since 1993, but comes here in good heart after an
extensive jumping campaign.
He ran well over hurdles but Hammond felt he was harshly handicapped
in that sphere and it was over fences that he opened his seasonal
account at Hexham two weeks ago, beating Quiet MIstress.
The one thing Dominant Serenade does is stay and he is sure to
appreciate the receipt of weight all round when the chips are down in
the closing stages.
Tovarich is the logical choice in the Kiss and Cuddle women's
handicap. It took David Nicholls a while to get to the bottom of
Tovarich after he bought the four-year-old out of Dick Hern's yard.
But he looks to have found the key judged on his gutsy win at Ripon
last month when he beat Mr Cube by threequarters of a length. He was
given a forceful ride by Alex Greaves that day and looks sure to benefit
from her handling again here.
Best bet at Southwell is Rolling The Bones, who makes a quick
reappearance in the Italy Handicap. The six-year-old always has worked
well at home for trainer Paul Felgate but only now is he beginning to
find consistency on the track.
He won his second race in succession at Beverley on Friday, doggedly
seeing off Vain Prince by a length.
Although Rolling The Bones picks up a 4lb penalty he will run off a
6lb lower mark here because he reverts to his all-weather rating.
He is unlikely to be so well-handicapped again for a long time and
although Saturday's Wolverhampton winner, Jaraab, is a big threat,
Rolling The Bones is napped to make the most of the 24lb he receives
from that rival.
With huge fields at Windsor, punters should concentrate on Towcester
for the evening's entertainment.
Mischievous Girl and Mr Geneology have the look of bankers, while Lady
Confess could not have found a much weaker race to make her debut in
than the SSAFA Selling Hurdle.

FORMER international winger Gianluigi Lentini pressed his claim for a
place in the European Cup final in 10 days by scoring the winner as AC
Milan beat Roma 1-0 yesterday.
The $16m signing from Torino in 1992, who has struggled to recapture
his best form following a serious car crash almost two years ago, netted
a cross shot in 34 minutes.
Milan rested Montenegrin attacker Dejan Savicevic, who has a
leg-muscle strain but is expected to face Ajax Amsterdam in Vienna on
May 24.
Lazio, who left out England midfielder Paul Gascoigne, moved into
fourth place ahead of city rivals Roma after coming from behind to a
Nicola Berti goal to thump Inter-Milan 4-1. Lazio took their tally to 49
goals in 15 home league matches this season and it was one-way traffic
from the half-hour mark.
Giuseppe Signori levelled from the spot in 35 minutes and defender
Paolo Negro made it 2-1 three minutes later. Midfielder Roberto Rambaudi
increased the lead and Dutch midfielder Aron Winter completed the
scoring.
League leaders Juventus, still seven points clear, now need just a
draw with second-placed Parma in Turin next Sunday to clinch their
twenty-third league title and their first since 1986. Juventus thrashed
Genoa 4-0 on Saturday while Parma beat Bari 1-0.
Roberto Baggio, Fabrizio Ravanelli, Robert Jarni, and Gianluca Vialli
scored for Juventus while midfielder Stefano Fiore scored his first
Serie A goal for Parma.
0 A second-half double from captain Roberto Mancini kept alive
Sampdoria's hopes of a place in the UEFA Cup next season as they won 2-0
at Cagliari, who had Uruguayan Jose Herrera and Brazilian-born Oliveira
sent off.
Foggia remain in the fourth relegation spot despite a 2-1 win over
Fiorentina. Foggia are two points behind Cremonese, who drew 1-1 at
Torino.

GLEN Stewart retained two titles and smashed the West District
championship 1500 metres record, but was almost denied his two days of
glory at Wishaw due to confusion over his entry.
Stewart runs for Edinburgh Southern on the track, but for another
club, Leslie Deans, on the road. Because the latter have no track
competition, Stewart's entry for the TSB event was amended by officials,
who, strictly speaking, should have returned it to him to be correctly
completed. The national champion was threatened with disqualification,
and there was a heated exchange involving one of his clubmates before
sanity prevailed and the result was allowed to stand.
Stewart clocked 3min 45.49sec, running completely alone and trimming
five seconds from the championship-best performance. Several of those
who might have been expected to challenge him were resting for a British
Milers' Club meeting in Manchester on Wednesday.
The 24-year-old Stewart also plans to race there. ''But I felt I
needed a fast run before that,'' he said. ''It is a pity there was not
more competition.''
He certainly was under more pressure in the 800m yesterday, where
17-year-old Andrew Young, the World Schools' champion from Victoria
Park, was not the least bit overawed. He pursued Stewart all the way to
the line, and was rewarded with a personal best of 1-51.92 as Stewart
won in 1-51.67 -- as fast as he managed all last season.
Another 17-year-old prodigy to opt out of the junior age group was
Young's clubmate, Ross Baillie, who ignored the under-20 division and
was rewarded with two senior titles and championship bests. Running into
the breeze, and over 3ft 6in hurdles for only the third time in his
life, Baillie clocked 14.77, going to ninth on the senior all-time list.
With Brian Whittle absent, he then won the 200m in 21.75.
The field all took a share of the work, helping Chris Robison break
the championship mark at 5000m (13-59.45), while Robert Quinn, runner-up
in 14-00.91, set his first track best for 10 years.
City of Glasgow maintained a near-monopoly of the West women's titles,
including a championship best in the triple jump by Fiona Watt.
In the East championships at Grangemouth, Ian Mackie won the 100m in a
legal 10.70, but the Pitreavie world junior medallist opted out of the
200m to protect a painful hamstring, while Andrew Lees had an
outstanding double at under-17, taking the 100/200m in 11.11/21.94.
World indoor internationalist Aileen McGillivray had a predictable
women's sprint double, but there was a shock upset for senior
internationalist Sinead Dudgeon, who protested that her blocks had
slipped after she was edged out by Natalie Hynd in the under-20 100m,
12.14 to 12.20.
Dave Barnetson produced his best performance for two years to claim
the North District high jump title at Inverness, clearing 2.16m, then
narrowly failing to beat his Scottish native record of 2.20. He also won
the 400m, in 51.00.
Police officer Mel Fowler continued his arresting annual habit of
locking up a hatful of titles, successfully defending the 100m and 200m,
and long and triple jump crowns.
A little bit of athletics history was made when, for the first time, a
Scottish veteran broke two minutes for 800m. Robert Dunlop travelled
from Stornoway and was rewarded with a national age-group record as he
clocked 1-59.5, finishing runner-up to Alan Murchison (1-59.1).

AROUND the 1900s, the moneyed Europeans who went off to the warmer
winter climes in the South of France, suddenly became interested in
Sicily, probably inspired by the German writer Goethe, who went on about
it excessively in his book, Italian Journey.
Goethe reckoned one of the best views in the world could be seen from
high-up in Taormina. It's hard to agree unless you've seen the rest, but
standing at the old Greek theatre, it does seem like that, so
spectacular is this view of the Italian landscape at sunrise and sunset.
DH Lawrence was smitted and stayed there from 1920 to 1923, further
encouraging the British. A plaque in the Via Fontana Vecchia honours his
memory and there's usually a local nearby who says their grandmother
knew him.
Superbly sited on terraced hills about 1000ft above sea level.
Taormina is a resort made for romantics, ideal for honeymooners,
dreamers and artists.
It's also a place where the air is good and you can breathe deeply,
except over summer weekends when the local traffic and holidaymakers
pour in with their cars.
Mighty Mount Etna, is still very active, 25 miles to the south-west.
Climatically, the town enjoys year-round warmth, with mists and rain
during the short winter.
It's a very green place with masses of flowers everywhere and
balconies overloaded with flower pots. Bourgainvillea seems draped by
the ton, trees hang heavily with blossom, the light is a constant golden
glow and the biggest decision of the day, is not where to go, because
you don't go anywhere. But, where to sit for your coffee and pastries
and admire the view.
Smaller piazzas lead off bigger ones, the next cafe looks good to try
out after you've left the one you're in, so why not?
Architectural sights aren't numerous in Taormina, but there are some
fine medieval buildings off the traffic-free main street, the Corso
Umberto.
Old Villas have been converted into hotels, retaining their former
grandeur and style and, there is a thirteenth-century cathedral with a
rose window, old paintings and carved ceiling. A favourite for
sightseers is the Shrine to our Lady of the Fortress, on top of Mount
Tauro, and the Santuario Madonna della Rocca looks out on one of the
most beautiful panoramas of the town. Built in 1640, the shrine takes
advantage of the rock formation which forms a grotto.
The wide central Belvedere Piazza is surrounded by good restaurants
and a fine point for people and fashion watching. Nearby is the San
Domenico convent, once a monastery, later the army headquarters of
German Field-Marshall Kesselring, and now a luxury hotel with superb
cloisters and gardens. While not open casually to non-residents, you can
book a meal (check the price first) for a good look round.
Taormina's Greek theatre is its masterpiece and dates from the third
century. The vista is so dazzling, it distracts from what's going on in
the arena. In high season it's used for film festivals and classical
plays.
Huge and imposing, parts of the area still consist of crumbling rocks
beneath the feet, to make it feel authentic, but it's all part of the
fun. Just be sure you wear sturdy boots under the evening gown.
Taormina also has a good beach area with plenty of facilities,
overlooking the tiny island called Isola Bella, only recommended for
strong swimmers. The choice of hotels by the beach -- known as the
Mazzaro area is connected to the upper town by regular cable car. With a
rich, cultural legacy the area is worth exploring and some fine mosaics,
centuries old, still exist in villas.
Offshore trips take you to the Aeolian Islands, Vulcano and Lipari --
the latter being the largest with a fashionable yacht club and harbour
full of splendid yachts. Both have a dramatic volcanic beauty with lunar
landscapes.
Vulcano is the nearest, the steam fuming out of the soil in places and
the smell of sulphur in the air. You can take sulphur baths here to ease
pains.
Since Taormina is Sicily's most exclusive resort, its enchantment
doesn't come cheaply, but it is highly memorable.

IN Wales, they call their hills mountains, while we in Scotland call
our mountains hills, but looking at the pointed peaks of North Wales
they really do appear like little mountains. Then, as you tackle a
particularly steep face, they feel like it, too. Most of all they are
mountains early in the day before the joints get into gear and the
muscles warm up.
''Wouldn't it be good to still be in bed?'' was uppermost in my mind
on that first morning as we left Bryn Corach, just above Conwy, and
headed up for the top of the Sychant Pass. The rain stuttered against my
anorak and we were grateful for good boots on the wet, rough moorland.
Then, it all changed. The mist began to lift, the rain to peter out, and
the sun to emerge as we turned up Allt-Wen (White Hill) and found the
site of a Stone Age fort. What must life have been like up here for
those ancient people?
By the time we stopped to open our packed lunches and thermos flasks,
we were almost dry. Out came binoculars as somebody noticed the white
rumps of a wheatear family flying in and out along the stone dikes.
Later, it was cameras that were in action to catch the view from Conwy
Mountain, spreading much wider than a half circle over the Conwy Estuary
and right round to the Menai Straits and Anglesey.
At the end of the day, we were back at Bryn Corach in good time for a
bath and a pre-dinner drink, left with a marvellous sense of achievement
and well-being that would be hard to beat. Each evening, this was the
pattern, returning on foot if we were near enough to Conwy, driving back
in our mini-bus from further away.
Bryn Corach is a lovely small mansion above the ancient walled city of
Conwy, and it is a rare experience in itself to walk round the top of
the old battlements, looking down at the life of the town. Conwy Castle
was built by Edward I, in conquering mood, and there are two National
Trust houses. Aberconwy House is the oldest in the town, and Plas Mawr,
an attractive Elizabethan town house, has a sheltered courtyard. Here,
one evening, we watched a play based on the story of Robert Wynne, a
merchant adventurer who built Plas Mawr in 1585. Conwy also has a couple
of congenial pubs.
The bar at Bryn Corach is inviting, too, and there is a variety of
evening entertainment. Two dancing nights were more traditional country
dancing than disco, and one finished with a hectic strip the willow,
with a handful of Scots successfully steering the English, French and
German dancers. We had already taught them the eightsome reel.
Each day took us somewhere different. The Nantile Ridge was a real
test and I was worried that I was keeping faster walkers back, for this
was the upper level route (there are always upper, medium and lower
routes). But speed did not really matter, just lifting one foot after
the other. Once at the top, I was glad they had refused to let me opt
out. Nantile Ridge is all exciting sudden peaks and drops, with nothing
but air on each side and a view to Snowdon and, it seemed, the rest of
the world.
Another day at the medium level, we stopped for lunch in a wonderful
water meadow, filled with the colours of wildflowers pushing through the
long grass. It was warm enough to take off our sweaters and lie back,
looking up at a blue sky with a couple of watchful buzzards hovering
over the river.
That day started and finished in Betws-y-coed, a centre where several
valley roads lead down from different hills. There are always walkers,
easily distinguishable in the tearooms and pubs by their garments
designed to meet all weathers, their boots and packs. This was the first
place I heard Welsh spoken this week, the waitress in the small cafe
where we stopped, switching effortlessly from Welsh to English and back.
Later we walked over one of the tireless Roman roads that bisect the
hills with all the determination of a new motorway through a favourite
wood.
The week's highlight, however, was not Snowdon, where you can reach
the top without effort by its century-old railway, but Tryfan, a lovely
mountain rising right out of the valley floor. It was a perfect day of
sun and wind as we toiled to the Heather Terrace, a rocky switchback
path between clumps of heather, looking down on two lakes, looking from
this height like tiny jewels. Then, there was an exciting final push
over huge boulders to the top. The summit is superb, with a sheer drop
on one side, splendid all-round views and, to my surprise, quite a
crowd. Coming down, the two jewel lakes became cooling footbaths.
It had been a splendid week and, turning north again for Scotland, my
wind-burned face was Mediterranean brown, that first-day glow of
satisfaction warmly in place. I had not felt as fit for years.

Dunfermline 2, Clydebank 1.
DUNFERMLINE manager Bert Paton acknowledged after Saturday's
anxiety-ridden encounter with Clydebank that, for virtually the entire
second half, his attention was directed largely from the game being
played in front of him, to the packed East End Park crowd in the hope
that their reaction might signal news of a defeat for championship
rivals Raith Rovers at Firhill.
Sadly for Paton, and for the bulk of the 7700 crowd, such news failed
to materialise and Dunfermline now must look ahead to an intriguing
two-leg play-off against Aberdeen, while their Fife neighbours clear a
space on the Stark's Park sideboard to enable the first division trophy
to sit alongside the Coca-Cola Cup.
''I thought Hamilton might have done us a turn,'' said Paton, ''but
I'm happy enough with the runners-up spot.
''I felt earlier in the season that we were capable of winning the
title but injuries to key players like Hamish French, Neale Cooper, and
Stewart Petrie haven't helped our chances.
''Having said that, the team has finished the league season with a
15-game, unbeaten run and I couldn't have asked for any more from the
players.''
As Saturday's game drew to a close, even the possibility of
Dunfermline taking the runners-up position slipped into doubt as
Clydebank finished the match in adventurous fashion.
Trailing 2-0 to first-half goals from Craig Robertson and Norrie
McCathie, Bankies sent on veteran striker Ken Eadie with 14 minutes
remaining and, within 60 seconds of crossing the touchline, Eadie had
driven home a superb goal to ensure an enhanced level of perspiration in
the Pars dugout for the remainder of the game.
''We decided to put four men up front towards the end, just to give
them a fright,'' said Bankies' coach Brian Wright, adding with a grin:
''I think we succeeded.''
Paton conceded: ''It was a bit of a sweat, but we held on and now
we're looking forward to our two games with Aberdeen. There will be no
problem in motivating the players for this one -- they love the big
occasion and they'll definitely be up for it.''
Robertson's ninth minute goal, a close-range flick after forceful play
from Petrie, marked his 401st Scottish league appearance in a career
which has also seen him play in the colours of Raith and Aberdeen.
Club captain Norrie McCathie made it 2-0 seven minutes from half-time
and although Dunfermline appeared to be coasting, Eadie's late strike
ensured that no one would relax until the final whistle.

CAIRO: In a race against time, a team of Egyptian and French divers
returned to the waters of the Mediterranean today in search of one of
the wonders of the ancient world. Their goal is to find the
2200-year-old Pharos lighthouse. But first they must map a 24,000
square-yard area off the coast of Alexandria, Egypt's second-largest
city which was founded by Alexander the Great.

TWO teams from the North East will replace Angus neighbours Brechin in
the Division 2 next season and each of them will be hoping that their
strikers can keep up the good work at a higher level.
Early strikes for Montrose and the Third Divisions champions Forfar
ensured that each set of home fans could enjoy the afternoon without any
minor irritations such as a defeat.
Alan Kennedy and Colin McGlashan have been the Montrose double act all
season and they found the net twice in a 4-1 win over wooden-spoonists
Albion Rovers that gave the home side the satisfaction of finishing as
Scotland's highest scorers.
Kennedy opened with two in the first half. McGlashan got on the score
sheet just before the break, and completed things 20 minutes from time.
David Bingham opened for Forfar against Alloa in 16 minutes and only a
minute later he was involved as Alan Morgan was brought down in the box.
Morgan picked himself up to convert the penalty and Forfar duly
finished the season with a grand total of 80 points.
Ross County and East Stirlingshire managed to forget the fact that
both had just missed promotion and they served up a five-goal encounter
for a thousand fans at Dingwall.
Jamie McPherson nodded in a first minute opener for County and
although Mike Geraghty equalised near the interval, a shot by Andy
Macleod quickly restored the lead. Iain Lee drilled in a second
equaliser and with 17 minutes left substitute Murray Hunter punished a
mistake by the home side's replacement keeper.
The other four teams in the bottom half shared the points in their own
little dogfight. Steve McCormick put Queen's Park ahead at Inverness but
a strike by Alan Hercher was enough to ensure that Caley Thistle
finished sixth.
Cowdenbeath's Graeme Soutar scored with a chip after ten minutes,
Craig Farnan heading Arbroath's equaliser just before the half hour.

THERE have been doubts this season about Dumbarton's commitment to
attack away from home but they answered their critics on Saturday with a
2-0 victory in the head-to-head confrontation with Stirling Albion which
booked their promotion.
Dumbarton needed a win to overtake their hosts and there would have
been times when they must have wondered if disappointment was again to
be their reward.
That had been the case the previous weekend when the Boghead army had
retreated from Greenock as Morton won the title.
On Saturday there were early hints that the Albion defence could be
troubled, the home cause not helped by the loss of central defender Gary
Paterson with a hamstring injury.
Nine minutes into the second half a long throw-in from former Albion
fullback Jim Hamilton reached Hugh Ward, who drove in from six yards --
although referee Bill Crombie ludicrously booked him for allegedly
over-celebrating.
The Boghead army were cheering again nine minutes later when Ward's
run and cross allowed Charlie Gibson a simple task to score.
Albion's slim hope disappeared altogether 20 minutes from time when
fullback Andy Paterson was sent off for dissent.
It was clear after the game that delighted Dumbarton player-manager
Murdo MacLeod had been confident before the match even although Stirling
had home advantage and needed only a draw. Albion manager Kevin Drinkell
was left to consider the position of their fulltime players.
It was party time too at Greenock for Morton's 1-0 home win over
Meadowbank, courtesy of an early Derek Lilley penalty.
Andy McFarlane hit the winner for Queen of the South against Clyde
while Tommy Graham and Alan Bank gave Berwick the points against
Brechin. Goals by Jimmy Fisher and Miller Mathieson sandwiched Steve
Hutcheon's strike in Stenhousemuir's 2-1 win over East Fife.

Stranraer 0, Dundee 5
THE road and the miles home to Dundee must have been long and hard for
the Taysiders as they pondered on the fact they had beaten Stranraer but
had lost the big prize, promotion.
Manager Jim Duffy admitted after the game that it was not until other
results filtered through to Stair Park, where a delayed kick-off meant
they were still playing, that they realised they were still in with a
chance and a last gasp blitz on Stranraer's tiring part-timers almost
took the visitors to a play-off spot.
''We knew we had to get another five,'' said Duffy. ''We pulled back
three and if we had had another 10 minutes we could have got there, but
really we lost it over three games this season.''
Dundee went to Stranraer knowing what was needed and after a late
start to let their good travelling support make the kick-off, they were
handed a dream beginning. Iain Anderson was clearly obstructed in the
box in nine minutes by Jim Hughes but Mr McCurry's award of a penalty
was harsh. Jim Hamilton scored from the spot.
The score encouraged Dundee -- now clearly in the driving seat -- and
Hamilton and George Shaw shortly afterwards created a great opening only
to for Barney Duffy to save at Shaw's feet.
Duffy then dealt well with efforts from Hamilton Morten Wieghorst, and
on the stroke of half-time the Dane had two thundering shots from close
range blocked, one by Gallagher and the other by Duffy.
Wieghorst proved to be Dundee's second half inspiration and after two
good chances, he ran unchallenged from the half-way line in 62 minutes
before netting with a low lethal drive.
It was backs-to-the-wall stuff for Stranraer but the part-timers hung
on until the eightieth minute before their wearied defence started to
leak seriously.
It was then Wieghorst struck again, another low one from a difficult
angle, and with the Dundee fans in a frenzy, they saw George Shaw take
his tally for the season to 20 before Paul Tosh grabbed the final score
with a minute to go.

St Mirren 2, Ayr United 1
THERE are two ways to win a game -- lose fewer goals or score more
goals than the opposition. Ferenc Puskas, the gifted forward of
yesteryear with Hungary and Real Madrid, clearly favoured the latter
approach.
After his marvellous Magyars had thrashed England 6-3 at Wembley,
Puskas was asked why his team was not more defensively minded. With
stunning simplicity he replied: ''If they score three goals we will
score six.''
At Love Street on Saturday, St Mirren and Ayr United wanted to do it
the Puskas way.
Maybe it was a diet of Hungarian goulash, perhaps simply a fling on
the last day of the season. Or maybe it was the presence on the pitch of
so many youngsters, more into the joy of winning rather than the fear of
losing. Whatever the cause, the effect was one of the best games of the
season.
Where does Jimmy Bone find so many gifted young players? Particularly
impressive was Brian Hetherston, younger brother of Aberdeen's Peter.
Saints opened in seven minutes when Hetherston spotted keeper Stuart
McIntosh out of position and crossed to the far post, young Ricky
Gillies firing home on the volley.
Ayr replied six minutes later, Simon Stainrod's free kick from the
left being headed firmly home by Brian Bisland.
Ten minutes from time Saints' young substitute Gary McGrotty scored
the winner with his first goal for the club, heading home a Hetherston
cross.

IF England still used the same system of play-offs as Scotland --
pitting a club from the Premier Division against a challenger from
Division 1 -- there would still be one more chance for Crystal Palace.
Alas, it was decreed long ago that four teams would descend from the
Premiership this season and even after Norwich City's fall into the
abyss, it was always likely that Palace would be among them.
Duly beaten at Elland Road in midweek, where one manager described
their performance as the worst he had ever seen from a Premiership side,
Palace yesterday conceded three goals in the first half hour at
Newcastle before rallying too late to 3-2.
It is now expected that relegation after one season will be followed
by either the resignation or sacking of manager Alan Smith. Too honest
for his own good, the likeable Smith has been drawn into public
criticism of his chairman, Ron Noades, and of leading players that would
have been best kept behind closed doors.
Everton, Coventry, Sheffield Wednesday, and Aston Villa now can look
forward to another season at the highest level.
There will, of course, definitely be fresh fields for Jurgen
Klinsmann, who played but did not score in Tottenham's 1-1 draw at home
to Leeds. Teddy Sheringham's excellent goal was a reminder to Spurs fans
that there will be life after Jurgen.
It might even be life with Les Ferdinand who scored twice in QPR's 3-2
win at Manchester City to remind Gerry Francis what a good move it would
be to renew acquaintances with his former striker.
The English game will, of course, be poorer for the absence of
Klinsmann and of Glenn Hoddle, bowing out as a player after Chelsea's
2-1 win over Arsenal. There are few enough talents of that magnitude
anywhere.
Who will accompany Bryan Robson's Middlesbrough into the Premiership?
Bolton Wanderers, generally agreed to be a better footballing side than
Boro, slipped alarmingly in the last few weeks of the season and their
prospects are in the balance following a 2-1 defeat by Wolves yesterday
in the play-off first leg.
Whoever comes through the second leg on Wednesday will almost
certainly face Reading, 3-1 winners away to Tranmere and the most
unlikely of Premier League contenders.
In the division two play-offs, Bristol Rovers and Crewe Alexandra both
failed to score, while Huddersfield and Brentford finished 1-1. There
was a similar scoreline at Mansfield where near-neighbours Mansfield
were the visitors in the third division play-offs, Preston going down
1-0 at home to Bury in the other semi.

Hamilton 0, Raith Rovers 0
WHEN the party's over, Gordon Dalziel will almost certainly call it a
day with Raith Rovers, manager Jimmy Nicholl will not be available for
first-team selection, and the remainder, veterans and the like, must now
contemplate the future.
In short, first division champions Raith Rovers have cleared base camp
again. Now the hard work really begins after they secured the point
needed in a nervy draw at Firhill.
Dalziel and Nicholl have, in their own diverse ways, become legends at
Stark's Park. And as often happens with two characters who are outwardly
practical jokers, but inwardly fiercely proud men, they have not always
seen eye to eye.
Dalziel is now 33, and still fit. In his eight years at Stark's Park,
he has set a goal-scoring record which will take some passing -- 185 in
all. As he said after Saturday's game: ''When I went to Kirkcaldy, we
were part-time, in the second division, and going nowwhere. But it has
been tremendous to see and be part of the club growing from that.
''Two championships, the Coca Cola Cup, premier division football for
the second time, and a place in Europe has been quite an achievement for
everyone.''
Yet while Dalziel remains the diplomat, it is becoming increasingly
less than a secret that his ambition is to move into player-management
while he still has a couple of years or so still to contribute on the
field. He has the necessary coaching certificates, would happily start
in the lower divisions, and there's little doubt that he has both the
personality and ability to work with young and veteran players alike --
as he already has proved at Kirkcaldy.
But all Dalziel would admit officially is: ''I have my own ideas about
what I want to do.'' Then the joker emerged: ''I will have a talk with
Jimmy Nicholl when I sober up -- probably round about Friday.''
Nicholl, who referred to his fellow veterans as having ''made a happy
man very old'' has a job on his hands, starting with negotiations with
the half-dozen players out of contract. He said: ''Once I know where we
are with them, I'll look around to see who is available to bring the
right type of player to this club.''
As for his own future, Nicholl has all but ruled himself out of
first-team football. But the Irish humour wasn't far away when he said:
''If the likes of Gordon Smith and Terry Butcher can kick a ball for
Rangers' reserves, I'm not hanging up my boots yet.''
And what about having one more night in a European game? ''I suppose
if we had to draw an Irish team, I might go on an ego trip.''
Hamilton Accies, of course, could do no more than provide stiff
opposition on the day, as expected, and then take a back seat as Rovers
and their 4500 travelling supporters celebrated. Manager Iain Munro,
despite the players' efforts on the day, was unhappy at a section of the
home support booing his side.
But back to Rovers, and with two major achievements this season all
taking place in the big city -- one in the south, Saturday's in the
north -- renditions of ''Glasgow Belongs To Us'' may even replace the
dancing in the streets of Raith.

Rangers 1, Partick Thistle 1
HE wasn't there on Saturday. Gazza, not at Ibrox on their big day. You
would have thought he would have made the effort, so close to signing
for Rangers as we are led to believe is the case.
But no, Paul Gascoigne's chubby little cheeks and silly haircut were
elsewhere, but to be honest few who wear the red, white, and blue around
their necks in Govan of a weekend seemed to be too fussed where the
Lazio player was, and quite right. After all, big Richard and the lads
again had the premier division trophy in their grasp, and it soon would
be time to toast and toast the seven-in-a-row Scottish champions.
But to a neutral there was almost a feeling around the old ground
that, OK, the title was again in Rangers' safe keeping but it wasn't
enough. More had been expected.
Call it greed, call it, well whatever you like really, but the people
who roll up to witness Rangers' finest at work week in, week out, have
been brought up on a diet of rich living, and although they cheered
their lot when the title silverware was presented, for a club like
Rangers, daft though it may sound, the title was one thing but that was
it. Just one thing, one trophy.
Still, there is always next year and if Gascoigne eventually puts pen
to paper for the Glasgow side, not to mention the other world-class
players supposedly in the #10m Ibrox pipeline, heaven help the rest of
the clubs in Scotland because it will be a case of ''who's gonna be
second'' from now until the bad place freezes over.
Did Rangers end the season in style, turn on the old razzmatazz and
send the customers off home satisfied? Well, the sight of Gough and his
pals with the league trophy sure had the locals smiling as evening
approached, but before that, against a team which probably cost what
Gazza is expected to earn in a month wherever he ends up, the Teddy
Bears had no picnic.
Yes, yes, title won, little at stake and all that, but Rangers' fans
are asked for plenty and expect a good return, like watching the
opposition net being filled at regular intervals.
They tried, of course, at the weekend but found Partick Thistle's
resistance to be a real pain in the neck, and when the Firhill side's
outer defences were breached there was always Nicky Walker.
If there is a better keeper in the land than Walker, this
correspondent has yet to witness him at work. Time and again at Ibrox he
thrust out a hand or leg to thwart Rangers' attackers.
However, with many Rangers' supporters making for the refreshment
kiosks near the break, Walker was beaten when Craig Moore, who looked
really at home in the centre of his team's defence, nipped in to beat
the Thistle keeper with a header from close range.
That was it then, the south side of Glasgow heard that ''Walter
Smith's blue-and-white army'' were in good voice and looking forward to
more goals, and then the presentation knees-up could begin.
But Thistle didn't play ball, or rather they continued to stroke the
ball over the grass, looking dangerous on several occasions, and Alex
Taylor, who earlier had struck the base of Ally Maxwell's left-hand post
with a fine drive, completed some good work by young Stuart Ayton by
belting the ball past substitute keeper Andy Goram for the equaliser.
As, no doubt, many Rangers' fans headed for their favourite hostelry
to carry on the toasting, Walter Smith announced that although Gascoigne
still was dithering, two of the current Rangers staff will sign new
contracts this morning, Ian Durrant, for three years, and Alexei
Mikhailichenko, for 12 months.
Smith is keen for the Gascoigne situation to be cleared up toute de
suite as the domestic bliss which exists in the Smith household is being
strained.
''I've said everything I can about this subject,'' said the manager.
''The situation is still the same as it was last Saturday, and people
keep phoning me at all hours of the morning, afternoon, and night. The
Mrs is getting annoyed, which is even worse, because she starts moaning
at me.''
But while Smith combs Europe in search of the creme de la creme for
Ibrox, Gerry Collins, the Thistle assistant manager, and his superior,
John Lambie, will be sifting through other teams' cast-offs. ''We will
look at the free transfer lists and take it from there,'' said Collins.
But if anyone can produce a team for next to nothing it is the
management lot at Firhill.
Ayton was discarded by Rangers two years ago and in the short time he
had on the grass on Saturday after having come on as a substitute,
showed that he could well be one for the future.
Meanwhile, for goodness sake sort yourself out, Gazza, and allow
tranquility to return to the Smith household. Oh, the joys of football
management, eh Walter?

Hearts 2, Motherwell 0
RELIEF spilled over at Tynecastle on Saturday. Hearts supporters
jumped the walls and ran on to the pitch at the end of their team's
final match of a difficult season. Hearts were not broken after all and
remain a premier division club.
However, there was something incongruous about the manner in which
these fans cavorted on the grass. Their joy suggested their team had won
something when, in fact, they had done nothing of the kind.
Hearts had been straddling the abyss but managed to avoid plunging to
the depths of despair like Dundee United and perhaps even Aberdeen, yet
that the Edinburgh side found themselves in such a perilous position was
no cause for celebration. These fans should have gone home relieved and
happy, but unbridled delirium? Please.
At least one or two of the players seemed to be embarrassed by the
singing and dancing and John Robertson, who scored the second of Hearts'
two goals, put a proper perspective on the afternoon when he said:
''That was one of the most tense matches in which I've played, but we
shouldn't be celebrating staying up.
''We shouldn't see people running on to the pitch because we managed
to stay in the premier division. We are a bigger club than that and have
to do much better. We should be back here next season trying to qualify
for Europe, because that's the kind of target a club like ours should
always have.''
The crisp football which Robertson says Hearts played after Brian
Hamilton had given them the lead is what the Tynecastle supporters
should be celebrating, and the fool who sat at the back of the main
stand urging the players to ''kill'' and ''maim'' the opposition would
be better staying away altogether. The premier division needs Hearts and
their fans, but no-one needs morons behind them.
Proper backing can be a powerful force, of course, and Alex McLeish,
the Motherwell manager, admitted he had leaned on various people
throughout his first season as a manager, a season in which he emerged
as one of the most promising young men in his field.
Under his guidance Motherwell finished second to Rangers and claimed
the one UEFA Cup place available through league performances and said:
''I found myself leaning on and listening to people like Alex Ferguson
and Alex Smith who have a great depth of experience.
''Billy McNeill also phoned up from time to time offering advice, and
I hope I'm a good listener. When I feel it is necessary I will heed the
advice of people like them and try to learn from the mistakes they have
made.''
McLeish made some mistakes of his own this season, but not too many
and his players also were usually correct in their actions which is why
they will be playing in European football again next season. It also is
the reason McLeish was unwilling to be hard on them after this defeat at
Tynecastle.
''Hearts treated this match like a cup final and I don't think it
would be fair at this stage if I were to criticise my players,'' he
said. ''They didn't want to be but they were a bit flat. They got the
club into Europe and that says more for them.''
Neither McLeish nor his players said a great deal about the incident
in 65 minutes when Alex Burns' cross appeared to fool Craig Nelson. It
seemed the Hearts keeper caught the ball when it was over the goal-line,
but only Burns was upset when the referee allowed play to continue.
''This sort of thing can decide games as we all know,'' McLeish said.
Had the goal been given Motherwell would have been on level terms and
Hearts' anxiety would have become intense especially with Aberdeen
winning at Brockville. A point would not have been good enough to avoid
the play-off and it was only in the final minute Robertson swept away
all tension by scoring the second goal.
Brian Martin had tracked Gary Mackay's run from a deep position and
tackled the Hearts defender, who had a good match, inside the box. The
penalty was given, Robertson scored, and Hearts were safe.
They had lived dangerously with their goal surviving one or two other
difficult moments apart from Burns' cross after Hamilton had scored the
opening with a splendid header. The former Hibernian midfield player
arrived just inside Motherwell's box in 51 minutes to connect with a
precise John Colquhoun cross from the right and Steve Woods was beaten.
''I'm not the most prolific scorer, but by the law of averages if you
keep making runs into the box you know that a goal will come,'' he said.
''I'd say that was about the most important one I've ever scored.''
Hearts' manager Tommy McLean said he had to rely heavily on his more
experienced players yesterday, but one of them, Craig Levein, will not
travel with the Scotland party when they leave for a tournament in Japan
on Wednesday. ''He had three injections because of an ankle injury
before the game, but he won't be fit to travel to Japan,'' McLean said.
''David Hagen also had a foot injury, but he played without the
injection. He doesn't like them.''
It was the kind of dedication to duty which can make the difference
between success and failure, and next season Hearts will have to see
more demonstrations of this devotion.

Kilmarnock 1, Hibernian 2
RUGBY Park had a crowd of 11,676 on Saturday. For young followers of
both teams, admission was free at the gate. Added attractions included
fairground hats, party squeakers, and balloons. The meeting ended even
on the terraces, with three kids lost and three found.
On the pitch, a home win in the main event would have been nice.
Like many good picnics, however, this one ended with most people
tired, close to tears, and ready to go home.
Yet it had all the stuff of a fairytale at the start. The setting was
perfect. Kilmarnock's renewed stadium has the feel of a magic castle. It
seems to have appeared overnight. Killie played as if clad in shining
armour. They looked capable of slaying any foes, even dragons.
As the onlookers hissed or hoorayed every ball, the real world
suddenly went wonky. Everything was turned upside down.
Exactly why, it was hard to see.
But there occurred some kind of transformation scene, otherwise known
as the interval.
In their dressing room Hibernian picked up the script for another play
altogether.
Suddenly, the black knights (Hibs had three bookings to Kilmarnock's
one) were putting everything in front of them to the sword. Small faces
painted blue and white turned sad.
Alex Miller, the manager of Hibs, told afterwards about the potion he
had mixed at half-time. He had served it swiftly like a spoonful of
castor oil.
Administered to his players was the warning that the school bell had
not yet gone for their summer holidays.
His medicine had been prescribed in one sharp sentence. ''And it
wasn't tactical,'' he explained.
So grimness was added to the fairytale of the kids of Kilmarnock.
In a cruel way, though, they won the day. All of the action happened
at their end of the park.
In the first half they viewed their own smacker of a goal when Paul
Wright headed a beauty -- his first for the club -- from an exquisitely
flighted corner by Steve Maskrey.
Unfortunately for them, they were stuck in the same ringside seats for
the massacre that ensued.
Although the two goals that Hibs scored were less than crushers -- one
was fortunate and the second daft -- there might have been several more.
Pat McGinlay walloped in the first and Keith Wright took the second
after two Killie defenders fluffed a clearance.
But under the children's gallery was also the close sight of a hero in
action.
Goalkeeper Colin Meldrum, bravely wearing a scarlet tunic, had two
red-hot saves with one hand.
Top marks on the way to school this morning will go to the inventive
Wright, the irrepressible Tom Thumb (sorry, Brown), and the hard working
John Henry.
To be fair (unlikely in the circumstances), it might be recorded in
jotters that Michael O'Neill and Kevin McAllister also did well. Boo!
One little mystery was why Kilmarnock did not use Ally Mitchell until
only five minutes remained. He might have been the very boy to be dux.
* BERWICK Rangers midfield player Martin Neil, who has had trials
already this season with Newcastle United and Bolton Wanderers, is to
appear for recently-relegated Ipswich Town tonight during Colin
O'Neill's testimonial at Motherwell's Fir Park.
Neil had a spell with Dundee United before joining the second division
side two years ago.

NEWSVIEW: the unacceptable face of Charlotte Square
It is supposed to be one of the finest urban compositions in Europe.
Acknowledged as the jewel of Edinburgh's New Town, the architectural
climax of James Craig's 1766 plan, with a unified frontage design which
represents Robert Adam at his absolute peak just before his death,
Charlotte Square is the status showpiece that any city would be proud to
flaunt. That makes its current condition of cynical neglect so much more
difficult to explain.
There are layers to this civic scandal, and you must begin with what
confronts you first. It is literally in front of your nose and under
your feet. Approach the south side of the square from South Charlotte
Street, turning the corner which marks the birthplace of Alexander
Graham Bell. Here history and architectural heritage meet a decay as
shocking as it is incongruous. The first seven three-storey houses are
untenanted. To Let signs are displayed, signalling a distress in the
property speculation market that is echoed around the square, but
nowhere in as ugly a concentration as here.
Working westwards, the decline is startling. Number 32, held in trust
by the Crown Commissioners, stands empty. The basement door is boarded
over, as is half a window. Wiring is all that remains of the bell beside
the door, all brass mountings either removed or pilfered. Their guts are
left exposed.
Number 31, advertised as a refurbished office of 4000sq ft, is the
first of three buildings vacated for Saltire Court by fund managers
Martin Currie, and renovation work at Numbers 30 and 29, testifies to
the problem of making Georgian houses attractive to the needs of modern
businesses.
Smaller office tenants are now sought, and scaffolding might create
temporary scarring to the facade, but at least it signifies an attempt
to restore original features to encourage new leases.
The real degradation begins from Number 28, the first of the three
most controversial buildings in the square, currently the subject of a
development project by the London property firm of Helical Bar.
The four years it took to negotiate planning permission from Edinburgh
District Council, and the decline of the condition of the buildings
since the departure of law firm Dundas and Wilson, illustrate the
damaging effects of speculative development.
There has to be a better way of solving the problem of buildings and
use, of market lulls and the profit motive. An A-listed and
A-group-listed architectural jewel is meanwhile held to ransom.
The squalor is evident from the first glance at the graffiti etched
and scratched into the Georgian doors of 26, 27, and 28. Paint peels on
the frames of the once elegant fanlights. Grey stone has acquired a
sickly pallor from moss and lichen. Weeds erupt from a crack beneath a
mighty Corinthean pillar, and contemplate splitting it like saxifrage.
A pigeon surveys all of this complacently from the balustrade of which
he is proud tenant and if he cares to follow the trajectory of his
droppings past white-spattered ledges he can watch them mix in the
basement with hamburger boxes, milkshake cartons, waste, ubiquitous
parking cones, and detritus.
Basement doors have been broken, compounding the desolation by
taunting homelessness with the manifest misuse of some of the finest
buildings in Europe.
Lord Cockburn, who lived at Number 14 on the west side, might turn in
his grave at this abuse of his beloved Charlotte Square. His 1849 letter
to the Lord Provost of Edinburgh was a satirical guide on ''ways of
spoiling the beauty of Edinburgh . . . this place is not exempt from the
doom that makes everything spoilable'', he predicted.
His house is yet another in the square that stands empty. Next door,
above blacked out windows and doors, the current owner, Scottish Widows,
has placed a sign which reads: ''All Fireplaces Have Been Removed From
This Building''.
This is presumably intended to discourage vandalism and plundering.
The square is otherwise painful testimony to other forms of the same.
What happened? And how could the decline be allowed to go unchallenged
and unlegislated?
After all, Scottish Secretary Ian Lang has his Bute House residence on
the still unmolested north side of the square, as does the National
Trust For Scotland. As model occupiers, they cannot be unaware of the
mess on their doorsteps. The fact that Charlotte Square has been
permitted to become one of Edinburgh's biggest roundabouts, if not
busiest in terms of traffic volume, amplifies the conspicuous eyesore.
Neither is there any excuse for neglect among those who may pretend
that they do not see what is going on. This is the first week of a major
exhibition in Edinburgh on James Craig, whose plan envisaged Charlotte
Square (though he named it St George's Square) as the crowning glory of
his entire conception.
The exhibition is, ironically, entitled Dream City: The Past, Present,
And Future of James Craig's New Town, and it marks the bi-centenary of
his death.
If that were not enough, the authoritative Buildings of Scotland
series volume on Edinburgh, by John Gifford, Colin McWilliam, and David
Walker, claims that it was exactly 200 years ago to the month that the
first house on Charlotte Square was roofed, earning the builder, David
Hay, the prize premium of 10 guineas.
This date is disputed in other sources and the current embarrassment
over Charlotte Square's condition does not appear to have encouraged
much further investigation. It is a specific bicentenary that Edinburgh
might prefer to ignore for the moment.
''Charlotte Square has gone through a period of transition,'' says
Hugh Rutherford, a partner at Kenneth Ryden, agent for a substantial
porton of the unleased square.
His euphemism describes a general exodus from what was the most
prestigious business centre in Edinburgh until the recession. Suddenly,
major occupiers discovered the ''inefficiency'' of knocking through the
walls of up to four blocks to attempt to maintain modern office
conditions in period town houses built for residential use.
A ''stigma'' was created by empty offices. Planning restrictions would
not permit expansion. The area began to ''fester'' but Mr Rutherford
believes there will be a revival with a return to smaller office use in
individual blocks.
The fear is that the trend will be quite the reverse, with the
business community demonstrating that unless restrictions are relaxed
over the creation of much bigger office space at Charlotte Square,
abandoning it as an area of strict architectural conservation, it will
sink into deeper malaise.
Current property prices in the square are too prohibitive for the
residential market, so the future continues to rely on office leasing.
It is the Helical Bar project, after the #4m acquisition of Numbers
26-8, that focuses alarm.
There was incredulity last November when planning permission was
granted for a 35,000sq ft office development which links the three
renovated Charlotte Square town houses, with reinstatement of interiors,
to a new open-plan office extension to the rear through a glass atrium.
The objections of Edinburgh's Civic Trust, the Cockburn Association,
Edinburgh New Town Conservation Committee (taking an unprecendented
stand beyond its advisory function), and the Architectural Heritage
Society of Scotland were over-ruled.
A plea by Lord Cameron of Lochbroom, then chairman of the Edinburgh
New Town Conservation Committee, for the Scottish Secretary to use his
statutory call-in powers, was also ignored.
Having lost the battle, the conservationists dread that a new
precedent for future developments in Charlotte Square will be
established by the Helical Bar project, which is planned to start in
September with a completion 12 months later.
The decision continues to confound Terrence Levinthal, secretary of
the Cockburn Association. He argues that a responsible response to the
apparent commercial unsuitability of the Charlotte Square properties
should have prompted an application to the Millenium Fund to secure them
for more sensitive management, with leases to smaller businesses, or to
return them to residential use. Appropriate, he considers, would be
embassy use, small firms seeking prestigious offices, and housing.
''The importance of the New Town is lost to parochial ideas, profit
making, lack of vision, and ideological conflicts,'' he argues. ''Some
would be perfectly willing to see Charlotte Square demolished and
completely rebuilt.''
The final irony is that Edinburgh is the subject of an application for
its historic city centre to be given the status of world heritage site.
An inspector for Unesco has already considered the proposal, made by
Historic Scotland, and a decision is expected in July, subject to
ratification before the end of the year.
The planning consent to Helical Bar, and Mr Lang's refusal to call it
in, are not considered likely to advance the case, which requires
evidence of good management of a valuable amenity. With the Festival of
the Environment due to be staged in Edinburgh from Thursday, it will be
interesting to see if the continuing decline of Charlotte Square escapes
comment or censure.

Storehouse
GOLDMAN Sachs' retail analysts recommend buying Storehouse shares at
247p (now 243[1/2]p).
They continue to believe that the market is underestimating the
opportunity to build BhS and Mothercare into significantly larger and
more profitable businesses. Goldman believes that Storehouse is well
placed to take this opportunity given its strong cashflows.
The shares currently trade on a 10% premium to the market which is in
line with the average for the stores sector. With earnings expected to
compound at 20% per annum, Goldman's analysts believe that the shares
are undervalued.
A final leg to the current re-rating and superior earnings growth is
thought capable of delivering a 15% outperformance over the next 12
months.
Court Cavendish
THIS operator of nursing and residential homes for the elderly gets
the thumbs-up from Smith New Court in its smaller companies research,
rated a buy at 247p (now 246p).
Higher death rates and local authority cash shortages slowing
referrals have brought occupancy down by 1%, reducing the profit
forecast by #200,000 to #4.7m. But high private fee growth, extensions
of existing facilities, and dual registered beds will continue to
improve margins and provide organic growth.
Organic growth remains impressive, says the sector analyst, and
without raising further equity the company can grow by development and
acquisition at 13% per annum, gearing up to a maximum of 60% in 1999.
Costain
WHETHER Costain's latest restructuring has cured its ills is now
largely immaterial, says broker Smith New Court, advocating selling the
shares at 12[1/2]p. They have since dropped to 11[1/4]p.
Even without the excess baggage of loss-making contracts and myriad
mining problems, the broker notes that Costain is facing difficult
markets over the medium term and looks to have a structurally high level
of debt.
Contracting profits were unexpectedly low in 1994 at just #1m at the
operating level after a #5m TML write-back.
Recovery from this point will be slow, says the broker, given that the
UK remains moribund and overseas contracts are not without risk.
Bid speculation aside, Costain remains a weak link in a weak sector
concludes Smith New Court.
BAT Industries
THE attractions of smoking are such that Smith New Court recommends
the shares as a buy at 477p (now 494p).
The spotlight on the company has firmly switched to its tobacco
interests. Exports are growing and there has been a good recovery at the
Souza Cruz subsidiary in Brazil.
BAT has said that the integration of the American Tobacco acquisition
is progressing well after depressing group profits by #191m in 1994 to
account for the rationalisation costs. Also, for the moment, fears of
the impact of litigation over nicotine addiction have receded.
Insurance profits are likely to be a little higher this year. In all,
the brokers expect pre-tax profits to increase in 1995 from #1993m to
#2322m, while the dividend total will rise 9% to 23.9p and recommend
that investors should be overweight in the stock.
W Canning
HAVING divested itself of the electronics division, Canning can now
place all its management and investment resources in the speciality
chemicals business where good opportunities have been identified.
It is now beginning to develop chemicals on a more international
basis. Particular emphasis is being placed on environmentally-friendly
formulations.
Bell Lawrie White says the shares are a buy at 203p, with profits of
#6.88m in 1994 having exceeded their expectations and look to a total of
#7.40m in 1995 and to #8.25m next year, while the dividend will rise
from 1994's 7.5p through 8p to an expected 8.5p.
Division Group
THIS virtual reality (VR) and high-performance graphics company is
regarded as a strong buy at 100p by the sector analyst at Albert E
Sharp.
It has established a world position at the technological forefront of
VR and has close or formal links with key universities here and in the
US, and joint application projects with ''blue-chip'' companies and
governments.
Profits are not projected until 1996, but the combination of
Division's world-leading software and hardware together with its
Hewlett-Packard alliance leaves Sharp's analyst convinced that the group
will become a large and successful company and should be a core holding
in technology portfolios.
Bett Brothers
BELL Lawrie White accepts that the housebuilding sector is dull but
finds that the rating afforded to Bett Brothers is unduly cautious, with
the shares at 180p.
The broker points out that Bett's recent half-year results show that
its housebuilding operation did well against a difficult national
background. Profits came in a good deal stronger than expected, being
almost maintained at #3m, and the interim dividend was raised 40%.
Bell Lawrie forecasts #5.5m for the full year, down from #5.9m, which
would leave the shares selling at seven times earnings and yielding
5.3%.
Debt has risen due to investment in land, work in progress and
property development, though the broker considers year-end gearing will
be little different from the previous year-end.

Frankfurt, Sunday -- The European Union will not be able to launch a
single currency in 1997 -- the first possible date under the terms of
the Maastricht Treaty, Germany's top finance officials said at the
weekend.
Finance Minister Theo Waigel told the Berlin newspaper B.Z. am Sonntag
it was unlikely that a majority of European Union countries would have
fulfilled the economic convergence criteria laid out in the Maastricht
Treaty by 1997.
Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer told the Italian magazine Il Mondo
that a move to a single currency would not be possible before 1999 and
even then may not involve all the EU nations. -- Reuter

COURIER services are expanding rapidly in Scotland, where more and
more companies are eager to send light goods as well as documents
rapidly to their customers.
DHL, which specialises in international deliveries, said its revenue
from Scotland increased 21% last year, while the number of packages
delivered rose 18% and the total weight of goods carried jumped 31%.
DHL manager for Scotland, Tommy Withers, said business was expanding
strongly this year, with traffic during the first four months 18% up on
the same period of 1994.
''We are now carrying more finished products from the manufacturing
companies, whereas previously DHL was perceived mainly as a documents
company,'' he said.
''We get a lot from the electronics industry, oil-related items from
Aberdeen and financial stuff from Edinburgh. There is a lot of repair
and return traffic,'' said Mr Withers, whose firm mainly delivers items
from Scotland to Continental Europe and North America.
TNT, another major courier service, which specialises in deliveries
within the UK, reported a 20% growth in Scottish revenue and volume last
year.
This was in line with its expansion in the UK as a whole.
''People want things more quickly, the pace of business has speeded
up,'' said TNT managing director Alan Jones.
TNT is moving increasingly from overnight to same-day delivery, he
added.
TNT, which has 20 depots in Scotland, distributes everything from
computer spares to human organs for transplant operations.
''Companies are so dependent on technology that they cannot afford any
down time,'' Mr Jones said. The economic recovery was putting extra
pressure on firms to expand output while maintaining tight delivery
schedules, he noted.
''There has been some growth in the economy and there is more demand
for goods to be sent out,'' he said.
Besides delivering individual packages, courier firms are increasingly
doing regular bulk deliveries, replacing the in-house distribution
networks of large firms that formerly operated their own fleet of vans.
TNT, for instance, distributes newspapers such as the Financial Times
and Daily Telegraph and has a contract to ensure that Rover car
factories throughout the UK are kept supplied with vital components.
Mr Jones estimated the total value of domestic and international
courier services in the UK at #2000m per year. His company has #320m
slice of that.
Federal Express, which specialises in deliveries to North America,
reported considerable growth in business in Scotland last year, but gave
no figures.
David Mullin, the Federal Express senior station manager at Prestwick
airport, said Scotland's move toward hi-tech industries producing
low-weight high-value products was partly responsible for the growth in
traffic.
Another major factor was the increasing use of ''just-in-time''
stocking techniques by industry and a trend toward direct sales by many
computer manufacturers, he added.
Companies using ''just-in-time'' manufacturing techniques improve
their cash flow by keeping stocks of components at the assembly point to
an absolute minimum, but this requires an extremely fast and reliable
distribution network that can rush in vital items quickly to avoid a
production hiccup.
''I think the just-in-time principle has extended itself to the
consumer,'' Mr Mullin said. ''People don't want to order something and
wait two weeks for it to be delivered.''
Mr Jones at TNT agreed. ''By providing a very fast overnight service,
our customers find they are winning sales,'' he said.
A crucial factor behind the rapid growth of courier services is the
reliability as well as the increased speed of delivery.
''Each item is computer checked and tracked,'' Mr Mullin said. ''There
is no point in shipping fast if you can't control where your packages
are.''

A NATIONALIST who once vowed to kill 150 liberals, the wife of
controversial investment fund head Sergei Mavrodi and a famous cosmonaut
fought it out today in one of Russia's most bizarre by-election battles.
The poll in Kolomna, 60 miles southeast of Moscow, was called after
sitting deputy Sergei Skorochkin was kidnapped, handcuffed and shot
through the head in February. He said he had been threatened by the
local mafia for refusing to pay bribes.
Ultra-nationalist Alexei Vedenkin and his besuited entourage swooped
into town to press home the point that the State Duma (lower house of
parliament) should make a top priority of protecting the rights of
Russians.
Yet the baby-faced extremist's real motives for seeking election
seemed to lie elsewhere.
Russian deputies are immune to prosecution and Vedenkin faces a
criminal charge for telling a television interviewer that he would shoot
150 liberals, including members of parliament, if his Russian National
Unity Party came to power.
''Only my enemies call me a fascist. Our politics are the struggle for
power,'' Vedenkin said outside Kolomna's police station, where he handed
in what he said were libellous leaflets distributed by Yelena Mavrodi.
Her husband is himself a parliamentary deputy and only just escaped
prosecution for his part in the MMM affair in April when his colleagues
voted against the prosecutor-general's request to lift his immunity.
Yelena Mavrodi, whose stunning face and skinny frame adorn dozens of
posters around Kolomna, is the wife of the head of the MMM investment
fund which collapsed dramatically in early 1994.
A representative of veteran cosmonaut German Titov, the second Russian
to walk in space, was also unhappy about the leaflets.
Alla Zaikina said Mavrodi had promised in one leaflet to represent
local people's interests, while the second made outrageous claims about
the other candidates. ''We don't know who distributed that one,'' she
said darkly.
Vedenkin's flash convoy of cars and sharp suits contrasted with rusty
Soviet-era Ladas and decades-old raincoats symbolic of life in the
Russian provinces.
Yet correspondents found only one voter who said she backed Vedenkin
-- the cosmonaut and the model seemed to be winning more support. ''She
(Mavrodi) is beautiful,'' one man sighed.
Others were less impressed. ''I know what her husband's like. She
doesn't stand a chance of winning my sympathy,'' said one middle-aged
woman.
Other candidates included hardline army officer Stanislav Terekhov,
who served time in jail for his part in a 1993 coup against President
Boris Yeltsin.
Some prospective deputies resorted to blatant bribery. Businessman
Nikolai Lopukhov promised a car and a television to two voters chosen by
a lottery.
An independent radio, Ekho Moskvy, quoted a sociologist as saying
Titov was in the lead, followed by Mavrodi.
Whoever wins the election will have to go through the same rigmarole
all over again in December, when full elections to the 450-seat State
Duma are due.--Reuter.

Grevena, Greece, Sunday
STRONG aftershocks rocked northern Greece today after a powerful
earthquake wrecked at least 900 homes and forced thousands of people to
move into tent cities and cars.
Yesterday's tremor, registering 6.6 on the Richter scale, devastated
the Kozani farming region, 80 miles west of Salonika and injured 25
people.
Aftershocks, some registering as high as five on the Richter scale,
rattled the region following the quake, causing further panic. They
persisted at regular intervals today.
The earthquake's epicentre was between the farm towns of Kozani and
Grevena and dozens of villages in the region were badly hit.
Officials said at least 700 homes or buildings were severely damaged
in the Grevena area and 200 others around Kozani.
Officials said a major disaster was averted only because the
earthquake struck at noon, when schools and churches were empty and most
people were in the fields tending their crops.
Tents have been erected to provide
temporary quaters.

Novi Atagi, Sunday
RUSSIAN forces bombarded villages in the foothills of southern
Chechnya today in a bid to break through into the mountains where rebels
have set up guerrilla bases.
Interfax news agency said the rebels had themselves shelled the
capital Grozny 18 times today, one of the heaviest such attacks since
Kremlin forces captured the city at the end of February. The report
could not immediately be confirmed.
Russia has managed to take control over most of the lowland regions of
Chechnya in a bloody five-month assault, but it has yet to penetrate the
rebels' highland strongholds.
The road running south from Grozny was blocked today as Russian tanks
pounded two villages en route to the rebel-held town of Shatoi.
One of the villages, Chiri-Yurt, was partly obscured by thick black
smoke which rose high in the air from a cement factory targetted by
Russian tank fire for a second day.
People have been fleeing Chiri-Yurt and Duba-Yurt, two miles further
south, after shelling from nearby Russian tanks destroyed their homes.
Russian colonel Ilya Dukov, based in the southeastern town of Shali,
said the rebels were coming down from the mountains in small groups of
15 or 20 and infiltrating villages.
A group of separatist fighters roaming western Chechnya's dense birch
forests on horseback were defiant and promised a long, hot summer of
guerrilla war.
''We've been fighting in the mountains for five months now. We've been
watching the Russians from mountaintops as they try to get us,'' said
Movli, a fighter from the rebel base of Bamut on the foothills of the
snow-capped Caucasus mountains.
''It'll be a long, hot summer for the Russians,'' he said. ''The
weather is great now in the mountains. There's clean water from mountain
springs and soon we'll start growing vegetables. We can fight the
Russians from the mountains all our lives.''--Reuter.

Srinagar, Sunday
KASHMIRIS protesting over the destruction of a Muslim shrine defied a
strict curfew and clashed with police today as two visiting senior
government ministers were assured the situation was well under control.
Police sources said stone-throwing crowds attacked paramilitary troops
on 14 occasions today in Srinagar, hurling rocks at police headquarters
and ignoring the curfew that has kept almost a million people indoors in
the city for four days.
The demonstrations coincided with a visit by Home (Interior) Minister
Shankarrao Chavan and Finance Minister Manmohan Singh to Srinagar, the
summer capital of the state of Jammu and Kashmir, to assess the
situation following destruction of the 15th century shrine to Kashmir's
patron saint, Sheikh Nooruddin Wali, and much of the surrounding town of
Charar-e-Sharief.
The protesters accuse the Indian army, trying to put down a
five-year-old insurgency by Muslim separatists, of burning the shrine.
The army says the guerrillas did it.
A government statement said the two ministers and three top civil
servants met the state governor, retired army chief K V Krishna Rao, for
2[1/2] hours to discuss last week's events in Kashmir. They later
returned to New Delhi.
''The governor said the situation was well under control,'' the
statement said, adding that the ministers, who also flew over
Charar-e-Sharief and held talks with some local politicians, had offered
help in rebuilding the shrine and town and discussed how it should be
done.
The All Party Hurriyat (Freedom) Conference, an umbrella group
representing 30 Kashmiri political, social and religious organisations,
has rejected any Indian government involvement in the reconstruction,
saying it would add salt to the wounds, and a local fund has been set up
to pay for the work.
The government statement said the ministers also discussed the issue
of assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir, India's only Muslim-majority
state, which Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao had been planning to hold
next month.
The razing of the shrine has seriously jeopardised the possibility of
elections, raising the prospect of a widespread boycott if they go
ahead.
The government said the two ministers were briefed on how about 40
Muslim separatists, who moved into Charar-e-Sharief in January, burned
down the shrine and several hundred houses ''at the behest of their
mentors across the border (in Pakistan)''.
India insists Pakistan arms and controls the guerrillas, charges that
Pakistan denies. The two countries have fought two of their three wars
since independence in 1947 over Kashmir.
''It was explained that the main approach of the security forces was
to prevent civilian casualties in any operation to free the shrine from
the militants,'' the government said.
The army says two of its own men and 29 guerrillas were killed in the
fighting.
Police said nine more guerrillas were killed in clashes with security
forces in various parts of the region yesterday.
The sources said a civilian was killed and nine were injured today in
the northern town of Baramulla when a grenade thrown at a Border
Security Force patrol exploded on the street during a relaxation of the
curfew,

Abbey National is expected to lodge its widely expected bid for
National &amp; Provincial building society by the end of this week.
Analysts forecast that the bank, once a building society itself, might
pay more than #1000m for N&amp;P, implying average payments to the society's
1.7 million qualifying members of about #650 to #700.
Abbey confirmed its interest in N&amp;P at the end of last month, but the
N&amp;P board is believed to favour a merger with another society followed
by a flotation.

SPECULATION is increasing that Scottish &amp; Newcastle will make a rights
issue this week to help finance the proposed acquisition of Courage from
Foster's Brewing Group of Australia for around #500m. That may require
asking shareholders for about #325m with the rest to come from S&amp;N's own
bank facilities.
A merger between the Edinburgh-based brewer and Courage has been on
the stocks for at least the last 25 years. It is believed that there
were discussions as long ago as 1968 when Courage was still a
family-dominated traditional brewer. That was before its acquisition by
Imperial Tobacco in the early 1970s which in turn was swallowed up by
Hanson before being sold on to Foster's.
The rationale has never changed in that the two are geographically
highly complementary. Courage provides a major presence in the south of
England where S&amp;N is lighly represented even after last year's #700m
acquisition of the Chef &amp; Brewer pub chain from Grand Metropolitan.
It would be a fitting triumph for chairman Sir Alick Rankin, who
stands down as chairman in 1997, although giving chief executive Brian
Stewart plenty to do in integrating the two companies.
Talks between the two companies have been complicated by several
issues. One is that there are potential problems in terms of market
share with a combined 13% of S&amp;N being augmented by the 19% of Courage
to create a industry giant with about 31% of the total and 8% higher
than that of the traditional leader Bass.
More difficult matters to agree are believed to be the postion of the
various brands licensed to both brewers. S&amp;N has traditionally lacked a
mainstream lager in England with sufficient firepower to compete with
Bass's Carling.
Scottish &amp; Newcastle is doing reasonably well with Beck's in the
premium market but that is still probably well below 400,000 barrels a
year. It added Coors to its portfolio, which has raised a potential
conflict of interest because Anheuser Busch, which owns the Budweiser
brand, has signed a 10-year agreement with Courage to produce Bud at the
Mortlake brewery.
Acquisition of Courage could mean S&amp;N having to sell the Coors
franchise.
Courage owns the UK rights to both Holsten and Kronenbourg and the
brand owners are concerned that there would be too many premium lagers
in the enlarged S&amp;N portfolio.
Any rights issue, on the appropriate terms, would almost certainly
receive a good reception in the City.
In recent years, S&amp;N has led an almost charmed life ever since it was
able to fight off a bid by the Australian Elders IXL group in 1989
thanks to the intervention of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
It sold Thistle Hotels at the top of the the market for #645m, despite
much criticism in Scotland, and reinvested most of the proceeds in the
Center Parcs holiday centres which have proved highly successful and
more rewarding than any possible returns from hotels. That was followed
up by the Chef &amp; Brewer deal which seems to be doing better than was
expected at the time of completion.

A FRENCH court will hand down its verdict tomorrow on maverick former
Marseille soccer boss Bernard Tapie who faces a possible six months in
prison for match-rigging and interfering with witnesses.
Tapie, a bankrupt businessman turned politician, said at his trial in
March the case had ''finished'' him.
Pleading for clemency, he said: ''This affair has finished me, ruined
me, left me in a financial and professional situation that is called
oblivion.''
The public prosecutor has demanded a six-month prison term, with
another 12 months suspended, against the former left-wing cabinet
minister, who admitted to lying in court.
It was not clear if Tapie, who was recently in hospital for a gall
bladder problem, would be in court for the verdict.
Tapie and five others are accused of rigging a league game between
Marseille and Valenciennes six days before his club won the 1993
European Cup against AC Milan. Marseille won 1-0.
Tapie, who was accused by former right-hand man Jean-Pierre Bernes of
instigating the scam, denied any involvement in the bribery of
Valenciennes players to throw the match.
Bernes, who was general secretary of Marseille at the time, said Tapie
instructed him to arrange the deal through Marseille midfielder
Jean-Jacques Eydelie.
Tapie's lawyer, Francis Debacker, tried to convince the court there
was no concrete proof of his client guilt. ''We are in the realm of
fantasy. You built a beautiful intellectual construction but you do not
have a shred of evidence.''
However, Tapie's alibi on the charge of tampering with witnesses
collapsed when former Socialist cabinet colleague Jacques Mellick
admitted he lied in court and had not been in the businessman's office
on June 17, 1993.
Mellick has since been sentenced to a six-month suspended jail term
for interfering with witness.
Tapie had used the purported meeting to argue he could not have been
meeting former Valenciennes trainer Boro Primorac, who testified the
Marseille chairman had offered him cash and a job if he accepted
responsiblity in the match-fixing affair.
Prosecutor Eric de Montgolfier's request at the trial in the northern
mining town of Valenciennes was the first formal call for Tapie, who
faces a string of legal actions over his collapsed business empire, to
be sent to prison.
A self-made millionaire, Tapie was declared bankrupt and ineligible to
hold public office for five years in December.
He has appealed against that ruling and remains a member of the French
and European parliaments pending the outcome.
* Former cabinet minister Alain Carignon goes on trial tomorrow in the
most serious of a wave of corruption cases that have jolted French
politics.
The appearance in court of the former communications minister in
outgoing Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's government takes place in the
central city of Lyon 12 days after Carignon was released from seven
months of pre-trial custody.
The conservative Gaullist faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted
on charges of corruption, fraud and interfering with witnesses.
Unlike other politicians accused of graft, Carignon is alleged by an
investigating magistrate to have solicited favours for himself as well
as his party.

Kinshasa, Sunday
THE governor of Kinshasa reinforced roadblocks on the main highway
from Zaire's Ebola virus zone today and designated hospitals to isolate
anyone falling sick, as the deadly disease moved closer to the city.
Troops detained foreign journalists and TV crews on the tarmac at
Kinshasa airport for over an hour after they visited the town of Kikwit
at the heart of the outbreak. They were then allowed to return to their
hotels without going into quarantine.
With the death toll standing at 64 since the virus surfaced in March,
Zaire's top virologist said he was confident foreign experts would soon
have the epidemic under control.
''As of now we have a total 76 cases of which 64 are confirmed dead,''
Professor Jean-Jacques Muyembe of Kinshasa University, told the visiting
journalists in Kikwit.
''Of the deaths, six were between yesterday and today. ''
In Geneva, the World Health Organisation put the death toll at 59.
Muyembe said 21 people from around Kikwit, some 300 miles from
Kinshasa, were in isolation. Nine of them had been brought in yesterday.
None had been diagnosed positive.
The virus, for which there is no known vaccine or cure, is spread
through close contact with blood or bodily fluids and kills by causing
uncontrollable bleeding.
But Muyembe said he was confident the outbreak would soon be under
control. ''We are beginning to get the epidemic under control because
there is a very strong team working on it,'' he said.
Bandundu governor Payanzo Nsomo, the man in charge of the province at
the heart of the epidemic, said yesterday the virus had reached the town
of Kenge, less than 125 miles east of Kinshasa and its five million
people.
''There have been three cases of the disease in Kenge, of which one
person died,'' he told Reuters in Kinshasa.
Kinshasa Governor Bernadin Mungul Diaka, who held an emergency meeting
with health workers in the capital today, ordered fresh troops to
roadblocks some 50 miles down the main A1 highway from the east and
designated isolation hospitals.
''There have been infringements. Soldiers have been taking bribes to
let people into the capital,'' he told Reuters.
Mungul closed the road last week to keep out carriers of the virus.
River traffic and planes are also being monitored.

<HEADLINE>Fighting rages along Serb corridor Zagreb, Sunday</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
HEAVY fighting raged today for the fifth day running around the
Croat-held Orasje pocket bordering a vital Serb corridor in northern
Bosnia, local and United Nations sources reported.
UN military observers in the area recorded some 2000 detonations and
said Bosnian Croats had fired 60 rockets on the Bosnian Serb territory
since the morning.
Iljo Dominkovic, spokesman for the Bosnian Croat forces in Orasje,
told Reuters in a telephone interview that the pocket ''has seen one of
the worst days of fighting.''
He said some 5000 shells and two Russian-made Luna-type
ground-to-ground missiles hit Croat defence lines. The fiercest battle
was for control of the village of Vidovice, on the eastern part of the
pocket.
Dominkovic said Bosnian Serbs attempted a combined tank and infantry
attack from three directions, using 10 tanks, several APCs (Armoured
Personnel Carriers), and several hundred soldiers, but the attack was
repelled.
''There have also been hand-to-hand fighting, but our troops managed
to keep the defence lines, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy,'' he
said.
Dominkovic said four Serb tanks and an armoured personnel carrier were
destroyed while more than 50 Serb soldiers have been killed.
Two Bosnian Croat soldiers were killed and another five wounded in the
fighting. There was no independent confirmation of Dominkovic's report.
The Croatian news agency Hina said Bosnian Serb forces shelled the
town of Zupanja and the village of Bosnjaci in eastern Croatia, causing
much damage. It said there were no reports of casualties.
The Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA said that Croatian forces had been
shelling the Bosnian Serb port town of Brcko from their positions in
Rajevo Selo and Podgajci Posavski in Croatia. It said Orasje Croats
fired six rockets on the town.
SRNA said Brcko sustained ''substantial damage'' but reported no
casualties.
The Bosnian Croat news agency, quoting local military sources, said
Bosnian Serbs were shelling civilian targets in Orasje and were
attempting to pierce the Croat defence lines on the western edge of the
pocket.
The Orasje pocket forms a troublesome Croat bridgehead south of the
river Sava, close to a vital Serb corridor linking separatist Serb
enclaves in Croatia and Bosnia with Serbia, their only supply source.
Bosnian Serbs apparently want to widen the corridor in preparation for
decisive battles elsewhere in Bosnia and Croatia, local Croat and UN
sources said.
The corridor, reported closed for a brief period yesterday because of
fighting, reopened today, SRNA said.
* More than 200 Muslims were expelled from territory by Serbs in
northern Bosnia yesterday, government television reported today.
The nightly television news broadcast said 208 civilians were bussed
across the front line into government territory at Turbe, west of
Travnik.
Another 40 Muslim men reportedly had been removed from the buses by
Bosnian Serb army authorities in nearby Donji Vakuf.
These men were said to have paid Serb authorities 500 German marks
($350) for the right to leave their homes, suggesting that at least some
of the refugees may have requested to leave Serb-held territory.

ARGENTINE President Carlos Menem claimed victory in his bid for
reelection today just minutes after early exit polls gave him a
resounding margin over his centre-left challenger, Jose Bordon.
''I never had any doubts,'' said the 64-year-old Peronist leader in a
television interview. ''At no stage was I afraid.''
Early exit polls on television and radio gave Menem 46 to 47.7% of the
vote against 32 to 34% for Bordon, while the Peronists' traditional
rivals, the Radicals, were way behind with between nine and 15%.
Menem needs either 45% or at least 40% with a 10-point lead to avoid a
second-round run-off against Bordon -- a possibility raised by the
latest opinion polls today.
With official results due to start pouring in, Menem said he was sure
of getting at least 45% and confirmed that he would not make any changes
to his cabinet.
When asked by an interviewer why he did not appear overly excited,
Menem replied: ''The years don't go by in vain.''
Virtually all opinion polls predicted a clean one-round win for Menem
as a reward for curing two persistent rogue elements of Argentine
history: inflation and the armed forces.
Menem took office in 1989 and has changed the constitution to allow
him to seek a second term.
His term has transformed Argentina from a country shaken by coups and
ravaged by hyperinflation to one of Latin America's most stable and
fastest growing countries.
''There's still a lot to do but we all could see that Menem was going
to win because he has shown his effectiveness in very difficult times,''
said a beaming Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo entering the
presidential palace to congratulate him.
Cavallo has probably done more than anyone to ensure Menem's
re-election and win him votes even from people who dislike his populist
style, by bringing in stability and taming inflation to under 5% from
5000.
The opposition has put the emphasis on Argentina's record 12.2%
unemployment, twice the level in 1989, and made allusions to Menem's
eternal Achilles' heel: the corruption scandals surrounding his personal
entourage.
After voting in his native La Rioja, Menem celebrated the fact that
for the first time in seven decades, Argentina has held three democratic
elections in a row.
''We Argentines have managed to hold onto democracy since 1983. Now
no-one can take away from us the pleasure of living in liberty, peace
and harmony,'' he said.
Menem's pragmatism enabled Argentines to vote for the first time in
living memory with no threat from a military that has staged six coups
this century. He pacified them by pardoning ''dirty war'' crimes of
their brutal 1976--83 regime.
Bordon, voting in the western Mendoza province where he was once a
Peronist governor, celebrated the fact the country is holding a third
democratic election in a row for the first time in seven decades by
predicting the vote's outcome.
The Peronists' traditional rivals, the century-old Radical Party, are
way behind in third place.
Radical hopeful Horacio Massaccesi, voting in the Patagonian province
of Rio Negro, where he is governor, told reporters: ''If Argentines want
to change direction, they have got to force the vote to a second
round.''--Reuter.

Bonn, Sunday
GERMANY'S beleaguered Free Democrats, junior partners in Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's government, crashed to embarrassing defeat in two state
elections today, exit polls indicated.
In a result that could reverberate in Bonn, the liberals failed to win
the minimum 5% of the vote needed for a presence in the legislatures of
the large western state of North Rhine-Westphalia and the small northern
city-state of Bremen.
The big winners appeared to be the Greens, who boosted their showing
in both states and confirmed their status as the rising third force in
German politics.
The miserable FDP performance seemed set to unleash fresh criticism of
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel as FDP chairman and raised the question of
how reliable a partner it can remain for Kohl's government, which rules
with a slim 10-seat majority.
FDP politicians quizzed about the national implications of today's
votes declined to say whether Kinkel would face any leadership challenge
at an FDP annual congress next month.
ARD and ZDF television said the incumbent Social Democrats (SPD)
slipped to around 47% in North Rhine-Westphalia from 50% in the 1990
poll there but might still end up with a majority of seats in the
Dusseldorf legislature.
Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU) stayed almost unchanged at around
36.5% in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state.
In Bremen, Germany's smallest state, the SPD was running neck-and-neck
with the CDU, leaving it open what kind of coalition might emerge there.
FDP officials were desolate as exit poll results came in, bemoaning
the fact their goals of cutting taxes and championing civil liberties
had failed to translate into votes.
The party, which crashed out of nine state assemblies and the European
Parliament before finally clearing the minimum vote hurdle in last
October's general election, won only around 4% in North Rhine-Westphalia
and in Bremen.--Reuter.

Tokyo, Monday
POLICE today arrested a man who they believe commanded the Tokyo
subway gas attack in March, Japanese media reported.
Kyodo news agency said the man arrested was Yoshihiro Inoue, so-called
''Intelligence Minister'' of the Aum Shinri Kyo (Supreme Truth)
religious sect.
Inoue's arrest was the latest major breakthrough for police in
rounding up Aum followers believed responsible for the March 20 attack,
which killed 12 people and injured more than 5000.
His arrest was expected to clear the way for police to move swiftly
against the cult's headquarters in a village near Mt Fuji west of Tokyo,
where cult founder Shoko Asahara was believed to be hiding.
While Inoue was at large, police had feared revenge attacks if they
arrested Asahara, who also has been directly linked to the subway
horror.
Police sources said weekend confessions by several key players in the
drama had allowed them at last to get a clear picture of how the attack
was carried out.
Piecing together evidence and details from confessions made by some of
the 200 cult members arrested over the past two months, police believe
10 people carried out the actual attack and another 10 were directly
involved in producing the gas.
Police believe two-person teams were involved, with one person
releasing the gas from plastic bags wrapped in newspapers while the
other kept a lookout.--Reuter

ADULT Learners' Week starts May 15, and runs until May 21. Its aim is
to encourage more adults to consider taking advantage of the wide
variety of learning opportunities for adults, available through local
further education colleges.
Some people are unsure of exactly what they offer, so it's worth
briefly outlining their role.
Further education colleges offer a wide range of courses in general
education and vocational training in a welcoming, friendly environment.
Colleges run full and part-time and open learning courses, enabling
people to continue to add to their qualifications at their own time and
pace, a flexibility which even enables those who are working to
participate in courses.
Recent years have seen the number of adults enrolling on college
course increase significantly. Between 1989 and 1994, women in further
education increased by 185%, while the figure for men showed an increase
of 35%. Clearly then, although adults have always found the colleges
welcoming, the numbers of participating adults has substantially grown.
But, you may say, how will going to college help you? And what courses
can be done there?
A college education can boost confidence and help with career
prospects, as well as enhancing self-respect. The skills learned are
directly related to the workplace, so improving job opportunities. A
further bonus is that new people will be met, who share similar
interests, and this can be stimulating as well as fun.
A wide range of options is available at further education colleges to
suit those with no or few qualifications -- up to degree level. They are
structured to help students progress easily from one qualification to
the next.
Many of the qualifications awarded for college courses are Scottish
Council for Vocational Education and Training (SCOTVEC) certificates.
These are nationally recognised by industry and other education
providers. A wide range of National Certificate (NC) non-advanced
courses, and all 1100 advanced SCOTVEC qualifications, Higher National
Certificate (HNC) and Higher National Diploma (HND) courses are
available at colleges throughout Scotland. They also offer the new
Scottish qualification -- Scottish Vocational Qualification (SVQ) and
general SVQs (GSVs) which have been designed by education and industry
collaborating together.
Most courses are built of individual units or modules. These are
blocks of study on a particular subject, which last for 40 hours.
Qualification is built up with a group of relevant units or modules.
As far as courses are concerned, the spectrum covers the skill and
knowledge required by key Scottish industries, including electronics,
tourism, fish farming, banking, business studies and catering, plus many
others. A lot of the colleges also offer a range of leisure classes
designed to help people find out about subjects which interest them, and
they can also encourage new hobbies to be pursued.
So what is college life like?To begin with forget school. It's not
like that. It is an adult environment, and there will be a wide range of
different age groups in your class. As well as an interesting range of
subjects to chose from, most courses include some kind of work
experience.
A great deal of responsibility for your own learning comes down to the
individual -- much of the classwork is project or skills development
based. While you are at college there is access to guidance services
which will help students plan the future.
SWAP stands for the Scottish Wider Access Programme. Through it,
colleges offer a one-year full-time course designed for those over 21,
wishing to go into higher education, but who lack the necessary
qualifications. SWAP courses are run in a wide range of subjects, and
the successful completion of a course guarantees entry to an appropriate
HNC, HND, or degree course.
As far as funding is concerned, individuals may be eligible for a
bursary or grant to cover course fees, and help with living and
travelling expenses. Those considering applying for a National
Certificate course, should contact their local regional education
department for a bursary -- the number can be found in your area
telephone directory.
For those applying for an HND or HNC course, information on student
grants and an application form, can be obtained from the Scottish Office
Education Department's Award Branch on telephone number 0131 244 5823.
Finally, most colleges have trained guidance staff who will review
previous qualifications, experience and interests, and help applicants
select a course suitable to them.

organisation, Scottish Further Education Unit, Jordanhill Campus,

AT 44, Linda Crawford of Largs is currently a full-time student on the
HND Tourism Management course at the very convenient, James Watt
College, Greenock. The younger of her two children, Iona aged two, is
looked after in the college nursery while her mum studies.
Prior to her present course, Linda gained an HNC in Business
Administration with Travel and Tourism, which she enjoyed so much that
she decided to enrol for the higher qualification.
As a former businesswoman who had run her own hairdressing business in
Largs, Linda Crawford had moved to New York with her husband for two
years in 1989. There, she had worked in the New York Metropolitan
Museum, selling museum reproductions, which involved her in a
considerable amount of training as well as learning the history behind
what she was selling.
''The HND course has given me confidence in my abilities, and working
on exports and presentations has helped me with public speaking which I
used to find daunting,'' she comments. Her ambition when the course
ends, is to work in the Scottish tourism industry -- preferably in
customer care training and/or promotion of Scotland as a tourist
destination.
''I feel the subjects covered on my two courses have prepared me well
for such employment,'' she says. Linda Crawford considers that although
balancing home and family life with studying, has not always been easy,
the benefits she has gained have made it worthwhile.
Elizabeth and David Grant of Bishopton are in their thirties, and have
two children aged 12 and 10. They are currently in consecutive years of
an HND Business Administration course, at James Watt College.
Before becoming a student, Elizabeth was a part-time clerical
assistant. She chose this particular course, believing that it offered
the widest range of subjects consistent with her intention of running
her own business.
David, influenced by his wife's positive experience, decided to follow
in her footsteps, and is now in his first year with his aim being to
switch careers, from technical sales in the manufacturing sector, to
marketing.
On completion of her diploma, Elizabeth's intention is to develop YD
Sports -- a logo development and logo application business for
sportswear, dealing with individual or group orders, for any type of
sports club or activity.
The most challenging aspects of becoming a student for her, has been
the stress of trying to cope with family responsibilities, running her
business, assessments, finding the time to study, and the lack of
finance and income.
Elizabeth's advice to others considering a return to education is:
''Be prepared to deal with the workload and demands made of you, and
consider carefully how to survive financially during your course.''

WITH Scotland rounding off the Victory-in-Europe celebrations at Perth
on Saturday, I suppose we more or less laid the Second World War to
rest. The magic milestone of 50 years, raised in 1989 to mark the
outbreak of Hitler's war, has since re-appeared at appropriate
anniversaries, through the D-Day events of last year to the final
Victory in Europe which, for most of us on this side of the world,
spelled the end of the war.
That war, with all its triumphs and tragedies and mixture of strangely
haunting memories, will now recede into a settled place in the panorama
of history, re-emerging with the maturity of time to take prominence on
a distant horizon as the most awful human conflict the world has known.
The numbers who actually remember it will inevitably diminish till
there is not a living witness left. Yet how well I recall from my
childhood that there were still those who remembered Crimea and large
numbers who saw the Boer War.
Survivors from 1914-18 -- it was then commonly known as the Great War
-- were still in the prime of life as we faced the prospect of something
even more ghastly.
Now it is all behind us, by half a century of as much world peace as
we can expect, and what a cause for rejoicing that is. As a passing
thought, however -- and considering how thoroughly history used to be
taught -- I'm surprised to find how little the younger generation knows
about the Second World War.
''Oh, that was before my time'' is the modern way of flippantly
excusing ignorance. But we need to know the context of events because
conflict will lurk for as long as we enjoy the freedom of two points of
view.
It is in the very nature of things, to be found in the simplicity of a
nest with two hens. Remove one straw and there's trouble. So we are
strange creatures but at least we have the choice.
For my part, one choice I'm glad I made was to be in London for the
VE-Day celebrations. It was a truly memorable Monday. As planned, it
started at the Langham Hilton, directly opposite Broadcasting House,
that wartime hub of all information.
Crossing Oxford Circus, I hoofed it down Regent Street, skirted
Berkeley Square, where the nightingales sang, and descended on the Mall,
with its magnificent sweep towards Buckingham Palace. For that was the
focal point of the day, large crowds already converging on the Victoria
Memorial and stretching back towards Admiralty Arch.
It was still mid-morning, with two hours of waiting, but
quarter-of-a-million of us stood patiently for the chance to re-create
those scenes outside the palace of 50 years ago.
There was time to look around, to study the sea of faces, gauge the
generations and to wonder what this could mean to different people. In
the buzz of anticipation we were suddenly talking to one another,
strangers all but breaking down the barriers in the manner of wartime.
There was matiness and good humour as we exchanged tales of this day
50 years ago, making allowances for the fact that even the grey-haired
in their mid-fifties (the Beatles generation) were just too young to
remember!
The military band played in the palace forecourt, then one old chap
bedecked in medals broke into Tipperary and suddenly we were all in
song. Eastenders led us in Maybe It's Because I'm a Londoner and a tide
of warmth broke over the crowd.
It was a British crowd, waiting to be patriotic and conjuring memories
of an age of innocence, recognisable families as they used to be before
the social revolution put that unit out of fashion.
With not a yob in sight, the Union Jack was restored to a place of
decency, instead of being the hijacked tool of modern fascism, an irony
if ever there was one for a flag which symbolised the demolition of
Hitler.
Then the balcony windows opened and out came the Queen Mother with her
daughters, the three survivors of that same scene of 50 years ago. It
was not too hard mentally to sketch in the missing members -- King
George VI, who survived the war by seven years, and Winston Churchill,
who managed 20.
The only jarring note of the day was the incongruous presence of Cliff
Richard. Pop stars have their place but this was not one of them.
Mercifully, Vera Lynn restored the mood and led us all the way from
those other Cliffs (of Dover) to that Land of Hope and Glory.
But it was mainly the Queen Mother's day, smiling and serene at 94,
withdrawing but returning for yet another encore. And you knew she was
taking one last look at a scene she would never know again.
So we wrapped up history and turned to a very different future. As the
sun went down on that 50th anniversary I dined on the rooftop of the
Park Lane Hilton, with its bird's eye view of the closing ceremonial in
Hyde Park. We rose for the two-minute silence, saw the Queen light the
beacon and watched the fireworks break upon the evening sky.
The laser beams might as well have been searchlights. Except that
there was not an enemy bomber in sight.

Police in Sussex are hunting for a man who abducted and raped a
21-year-old student as she was walking home from a party in Brighton
early yesterday.
The rapist, who drove a ''noisy'' two-door beige car, possibly an
Allegro, was white, in his late 20s, about 5ft 10in, of medium to
muscular build, and had very short hair.

MORAG MONRO'S letter refers to the evidence of Professor Peter Wood,
an economic consultant for Redland Aggregates, appearing at the coastal
quarry public inquiry (May 5).
In fact Professor Wood made clear that 223 jobs would be created in
the Western Isles and of these over 100 would be based on Harris.
Of course there would also be benefits to Lewis because Stornoway is a
dominant centre of business activity in the Western Isles and that is an
economic fact of life. This will not dissuade Redland from maintaining
its stance that wherever possible employment will be given to local
people.
The company fully undertstands the concerns of sections of the
community who fear that existing employment in, for example, fishing and
tourism could be threatened by the proposed quarry. It is hardly
surprising that the community needs to be reassured on these and other
crucial points.
However, Redland Aggregates would not be pursuing the proposal if we
did not believe that we had properly addressed these concerns and that
expert consultants had taken them into account with the careful design
of the coastal quarry scheme.
Redland Aggregates has been consistent in its view that we can all
benefit from such a scheme eventually proceeding. Not only will the
quarry provide Redland with a reliable source of aggregate to help meet
society's need for construction materials, but it will also provide new
opportunities for the people of Harris.
It would give confidence and construct an economic springboard which
would arrest the visible decline in the South Harris economy.

LITTLE did Arthur Miller know when he wrote that phrase back in 1949
that it would haunt him for the rest of his life. The fellow in
question, Willy Loman, may have been a man who has become a universal
symbol of failure but, in a neat ironic twist, actors, writers, critics
and interviewers consistently invoke it in tribute to Miller himself, a
man who has unquestionably achieved great success.
Small wonder, for while the statement pops up with near-cliched
regularity, its simple gravitas seems singularly appropriate when
applied to Miller. Through his ongoing efforts, whether in the
playwriting or political arenas -- such as his work on behalf of
International PEN -- Miller's work demands, and more importantly
deserves, continual attention.
Last year London sat up and paid notice afresh when the National
Theatre produced Miller's stunning new play Broken Glass. Written last
year, it proved that, even at 79, the man oft-dubbed ''America's
Greatest Living Playwright'' still packs a powerful punch.
It concerns Sylvia Gellburg, a Brooklyn Jew, who is stricken with
hysterical paralysis after reading newspaper reports about Kristallnacht
-- the night in 1938 when, prompted by Goebbels's implicit endorsement,
German citizens attacked and looted 7000 Jewish shops, littering the
pavements of Berlin with the broken glass of Miller's title.
In a quest to uncover the triggers of Sylvia's condition, her local
physician, the larger-than-life, wisecracking Dr Harry Hyman, begins a
hesitant psychological enquiry, tweaking emotional revelations from both
the panic-ridden yet rational Sylvia and her repressed husband Philip.
The only Jew working for a WASPish property company, albeit in the
unenviable position of foreclosure man, Philip cannot acknowledge the
anti-Semitism which his wife feels so forcefully that it has literally
crippled her, although his daily humiliations at the hands of a
patronising employer cripple him in other ways.
Miller movingly elides private pain with public consciousness in a
beautifully crafted play which evokes dreadful contemporary resonances,
pinpointing as it does the individual inclination to shrug off
collective responsibility.
Directed by David Thacker and featuring superb performances, including
Ken Stott as the charmingly eccentric Hyman, Henry Goodman as Philip,
and Margot Leicester as Sylvia, the production was critically acclaimed
and showered with Olivier Award nominations. Having just completed a run
at the Duke of York theatre, after a successful British debut at the
National's Lyttleton Theatre last year, Broken Glass is now touring
around the country and will visit Glasgow's Theatre Royal from May 30 to
June 3.
The setting, Brooklyn in the thirties, is an autobiographical one for
Miller, and the ambiguous reactions to anti-Semitism are his own. He
didn't address the issue directly until the mid-1960s, with the plays
After the Fall and Incident at Vichy and has claimed that he had
previously felt that the enormity of the Holocaust was simply too great
to deal with.
Marriage to his third wife, the Magnum photographer Inge Morath -- 30
years on they still share an active life together in Connecticut --
changed that. She had been in Germany, working as forced labour,
throughout the war and her experiences gave him a wider view which
allowed the tragedy to seep in.
In his autobiography Timebends Miller writes: ''If ever any Jews
should have melted into the proverbial pot it was our family in the
twenties; indeed, I would soon be dreaming of entering West Point.'' He
goes on to reflect: ''As it turned out we were building a fortress of
denial that would take two massive onslaughts to crack -- the Depression
and Hitler's war.''
Kristallnacht was a significant splinter in that fortress of denial.
Now in his eightieth year -- he becomes an octogenarian in October --
Miller describes it as an unbelievable event. ''We all believed or hoped
that the cultivated Germans would do something. It seemed unthinkable
that this kind of thing could be let loose by the Government,'' he tells
me, adding thoughtfully: ''I think it had a very profound effect on not
only the Jewish people but on everybody.''
It may have had a profound effect but this victimisation of the Jews
certainly didn't produce a profound response from either America or the
rest of Europe.
''Well, yes, I think that event taught the world how to turn away from
such things. And we're still doing it,'' says Miller. ''There is the
sense that we feel helpless to affect anything in Bosnia or Africa now
and we learned how to do that then. Now, of course, the horrors that had
been going on before then, such as the Turkish massacre of the Albanians
before the First World War, well, I didn't detect any great emotion
about that; at least I was never aware of it. It was only in later years
that I realised the enormity of that event. But all I can say, I
suppose, is that we should keep on struggling with this tendency to curl
up and go to sleep.''
He has said that Sylvia's paralysis was inspired by the memory of a
similar incident from his youth and he agrees that it was the
inexplicable elements of the paralysis, the psychological puzzle, which
attracted him as a dramatist.
''This woman, who was absolutely not political, caught some wave of
truth so powerfully that it struck her down. There was really something
magical in that and that was what made me turn to writing this play,''
he explains.
''Basically, this woman carried out a kind of miraculous receptivity,
and it was always a mystery as to what had caused it. But I suppose
there are a lot of mysteries that we don't feel comfortable with.''
In an age when people seem to need and demand rational explanations
for everything does he feel comfortable with the notion of mysteries?
''I don't know that I feel comfortable with it,'' he decides, after some
consideration, ''but I feel that it is an inevitable part of my
existence. I know that I can't explain a number of important things;
there are things I can't rationalise. We are surrounded by mysteries.''
He finds an example. ''Fifty years ago, if anyone had said that
without a war the Soviet Union would collapse,'' he laughs aloud at the
very idea, ''they would have been regarded as quite crazy. We have all
kinds of experts but I don't know of any that predicted that. We have
all kinds of 'evidence' but . . . there it is. And look at the
developments in my own country, all kinds of things are happening; on
the one hand we are getting wealthier and wealthier and on the other
hand poorer and poorer, and people seem to be paralysed by that too.
They look at it and think that all we have got to do is build more
prisons! There are all kinds of mysteries.''
So, as a dramatist is he interested in explaining or exploring these
mysteries? ''Well, I try to explain it, as far as one can explain these
things, but sometimes you are forced to turn away and think, well, maybe
someday it will occur to me but the point of this is why we are what we
are. I think all this is why people continue to write. Basically, it is
to confront, or try to confront, the inexplicable.''
He muses on the current preoccupation with chaos theory, seeing it as
an admission by scientists that everything cannot be rationalised in a
conventional way. ''That opens a way for art,'' he announces, ''which is
done by people who rely on their instinct more than on their brain. I'm
not one to say that we should set aside our rational capacity but there
is a lot more out there than we can understand. Before you confront
history you've got to confront what is inexplicable.''
The paralysis and indeed impotence dramatised in Broken Glass is
clearly symbolic of the moral inertia in America and elsewhere. Miller,
the archetypal liberal, recently mused that ''the left doesn't mean
anything anymore'' and I ask if he finds contemporary politics, with
opposing parties taking on similar hues, increasingly bland?
''I wouldn't say it was bland,'' he considers. ''I would say that
people seem to have given up a lot of the energy which went into social
thought. Now all we've got is a lot of simplistic and even violent
debate. I don't know where a real discussion of events is taking place.
It's not quite bland but there is no idealism, no fire,'' he says,
adding in a concerned tone ''apart from the far right. It's as if we're
in the trough of a wave. It's what this play is about. That whole
paralysis.''
The revelation that Philip is sexually paralysed, impotent for more
than 20 years, brings new implications to Sylvia's paralysis. Is it as
much a reaction to an arid marriage as to the political trauma? Or, has
she discerned, through Philip's unease about his cultural identity, a
loathing of Jewishness as tangible as that rippling towards her from
across the ocean?
Miller plots their brittle relationship with heartbreaking exactitude.
Sylvia and Philip -- and Hyman with his optimistic faith in the German
people -- are never ciphers for political positions but fully fleshed
characters whose pains are all too poignant.
Despite the wider context, it is an intensely personal work, dotted
with echoes of Miller's own life. Tellingly, the Gellburg's son is the
first Jewish officer at West Point, and Sylvia's frustration about
motherhood stopping her career in its tracks has its parallel in a
remark Miller once made of his own highly literate mother: ''They
married her off and that was the end of her.''
Of course, it doesn't do to look for too many autobiographical
references. Miller is mildly amused at the response which a flippant
precis Hyman makes of opera -- ''Nothing to understand . . . Either she
wants to and he doesn't or he wants to and she doesn't. Either way one
of them gets killed and the other one jumps off a building'' -- provoked
in Britain. Various critics positively prickled over it, with the Sunday
Express's Clive Hirschhorn sniffing that it represented a ''Philistine
put-down'' by Miller.
''Well, I don't go to the opera a lot but the few that I have seen I
loved . . . but it's not me but the character who is saying that. I
don't know why people can't accept that,'' he says ruefully. ''I don't
necessarily believe everything any character says in my plays, or share
their viewpoint.''
I venture that this is a drawback of his fame, that people believe
everything he writes is written in stone and he laughs uproariously.
''Yeah, I think that's right, but it's terrible.''
So, what is it like to be compared to Mount Rushmore by Peter Ustinov
and to be nominated as President by Kurt Vonnegut? Is it something he
can feel humorous about or is it just a pain in the neck? He sighs
heavily, but not all that seriously. ''You know, the longer you live the
less attention you pay to all of this. I can't really take all of that
too seriously. All that I'm interested in is that work is produced well
and that people come and see it. The rest of it is really nothing I can
do anything about. Having said that,'' he adds slyly, ''I'm perfectly
happy to be in that position.''
At the moment, after a lengthy break, he is about to have a fresh
dalliance with the movies, having just completed the screenplay for The
Crucible, which is to be filmed by British director Nicholas Hynter of
The Madness of King George fame. ''Daniel Day-Lewis will be John
Proctor, which I am very happy with, and I'm really looking forward to
it; they start shooting in August not far from where I live.''
A novella, The Homely Girl, will be published in the summer, which
will appear as The Plain Girl in the UK. (''Do you like that title?'' he
quizzes me). ''And I'm hoping to write another play one of these days,''
he says airily, as if discussing a part-time hobby.
''Do you have time?'' I ask.
''I guess, but not right now. For one thing I'm digging up my garden
and I've got to repair some machinery around here.''
He mentions in passing that he is taking a trip into New York the
following day to drop in on rehearsals of one of his plays. ''It's The
Ryan Interview, '' he tells me. ''It's the story of a 100-year-old man
out in the country being interviewed by a very young modern reporter in
her twenties and they have a little conversation about the state of the
country.''
Having begun this interview feeling humbled by his stature, prefixing
questions with a respectful ''Mr Miller'', his warmth and humour
throughout has eased us into a more relaxed conversation. ''So, that
will be you in 20 years' time, Arthur?'' I tease.
''Yip,'' says America's Greatest Living Playwright.

GO veggie for Vegetarian Week? No problem. I'm not a great meat eater,
anyway. In fact, if I lived on my own, I'd hardly touch the stuff.
Mind you, a quarter of mince does come in very useful from time to
time, as does the odd slice of chopped up, streaky bacon and the
occasional tin of tuna. And I do like my pepper salami.
But, seriously, I could give that lot up for ever, if necessary, and
not feel too deprived
As for the rest of the family -- because the challenge was for the
four of us to ''go veggie'' -- I didn't foresee any major problems. In
fact, we'd just completed a week of non-meat meals (give or take the odd
slice of that handy, streaky bacon) without even realising it -- when
we'd dined on macaroni and cheese; baked potatoes, grilled veg and salad
(twice); egg sandwiches; lentil soup (also twice) and a carryout pizza.
This week's Go Veggie Week is being promoted by the animal rights
pressure group, Animal Aid, which publishes a bi-monthly magazine,
Outrage, and whose members have been at the forefront of the recent
demonstrations against the export of live veal calves.
As part of their long-term campaign to ''convert at least 10 per cent
of the population to a vegetarian diet by the year 2000'', the
organisation has devised ''a special series of main meal recipes created
with ingredients readily available from high street supermarkets,
proving that you can provide tasty and nutritious vegetarian main meals
for a family of four, for seven days, and still have change from #20.''
They hope that their Go Veggie Week recipes will dispel myths that a
vegetarian diet is expensive and complicated and show how a vegetarian
diet can ''help to save both money and lives''.
The organisation says it is particularly keen to get young people to
do a sponsored non-meat week as an encouragement to go veggie and, at
the same time, raise funds for the campaign.
Now, in all the info about Go Veggie Week, the word ''vegetarian'' has
been stressed over and over again: ''vegetarians'' are less likely to
die from cancer and heart disease than meat eaters; ''vegetarian'' meals
are simple and cheap to produce So, it was with some surprise that
having sent away for and received my copy of Animal Aid's special series
of seven, main meal ''vegetarian'' recipes, I found that they were not
vegetarian recipes but vegan recipes.
As most of us are aware, vegetarians don't eat meat, fish or fowl.
Vegans take things a giant step further and give up on eggs and all
dairy products as well.
I felt considerably put out by Animal Aid's underhand tactics, not
just because the promised recipes were not what most of us would
consider to be vegetarian, but also because the meals sounded neither
pleasant to eat nor particularly easy to prepare (three of the seven
involve considerable chopping, boiling and frying before being put in
the oven to bake for between 45 minutes and an hour).
What a waste to offer up dreary dishes like Vegetable Pie, Shepherds
Pie (strictly for shepherds with access to soya mince), and veggie
sausages with chips when normal cookbooks these days are filled with any
number of mouth watering, non-meat recipes. Who needs chilli non carne,
spaghetti soyannaise and risotto with tinned butter beans when spicy
lentil dhal, French onion soup and pasta with oil, garlic and pepper
taste so much nicer? (
''We're trying to reach everyone with this campaign which is why the
recipes are as like a normal meat eater's diet as possible,'' said Mark
Gold, director of Animal Aid. He added that the inclusion of dairy foods
and eggs would have made it ''impossible'' to feed a family of four for
under #20, and explained: ''There is a direct link between the dairy
trade and animal cruelty,'' describing veal calves as the ''trash of the
dairy industry''.
However, Dr Annie Anderson, a nutritionist based at the Royal
Infirmary in Glasgow, was concerned that families were being encouraged
to try a vegan diet.
''Even vegetarian diets require much more thought than many people
imagine,'' she pointed out.
''I'm all for meat-free days on a regular basis,'' Dr Anderson said.
''But you've got to get the balance right or the health benefits are
nil.''

HARRIS is one of the most beautiful and unspoilt places in Britain.
The ancient St Clement's Church at the natural harbour of Rodel is so
peaceful it could make a lager lout write poetry. It is overlooked by
Roineabhal, a hill on Death Row.
In the English National Parks the landscape has been well preserved.
In the Lake District you need planning permission to wear a loud tie.
Further north, near Glasgow, walkers complain about ruts left by
mountain bikes. In Harris we are considering a gigantic quarry. It is
difficult to imagine a greater threat to the landscape.
Harris men need jobs. But does this justify the means? We don't have
much sympathy for out-of-work gravediggers, whale fishermen, or
Brazilian lumberjacks.
The isolation of Harris has preserved its beauty but has also
prevented tourism. However, it is a small and shrinking world and Harris
is now moving closer to the mainland. A bridge is being built to Skye,
halfway to Harris, and the recently launched Stornoway ferry will knock
almost an hour off its sailing time.
The Americans who previously only made it to Skye may now do Harris in
a day. The quarry will stifle new jobs in this embryonic industry.
John Macleod should be welcoming tourists who may well be ''cranks,
weirdos and Sassenaich'' with open arms (May 2). With the dwindling old
guard and a superquarry, he may be more likely to find himself on a
''last out, put off the light'' empty island.
In the future more jobs will also come from people working from home
with electronic help. Harris communities will surely benefit from lots
of John Macleods.

CONGRATULATIONS to Gerry McSherry for having the courage to speak out
against the present enforcement of the 1918 Education Act.
Apart from the sectarianism it engenders it has cost education
authorities unnecessary expense and made school provision more
difficult.
Some time ago one primary school provided adequate education for all
the children in a village till the Roman Catholic hierarchy forced the
authority to build another school to provide separate education for
Catholic children.
Perhaps the new unitary authorities will be forced to take a strong
stance in the future to the benefit of all.
Secondary pupils have a longer day because they are bused past the
local non-denominational school to reach their denominational one.
With ecumenism in the air and the Roman Catholics being part of ACTS
(Action of Churches Together in Scotland) for the past five years, the
time is now ripe for them to take another great step forward in faith
and trust and give up their right to separate Roman Catholic education.

IN the Declaration of Cathcart we are seeking to pinpoint 10 areas of
concern which, in our opinion, if seen to be addressed between now and
the General Election, will convince the Conservative electorate that
their views are listened to and action taken. Isolation of these areas
from the list of ''doorstep'' complaints was not easy but the
recommendations put forward are, in our collective opinion, capable of
resolution in the short term.
On the Constitution, all five signatories are dedicated Unionists but
we are presently uncertain if our view still predominates, and now is
the time to establish how the Scottish people feel on an issue which
occupies centre stage in all the political parties. A referendum would
seem to be the answer.
Large numbers of the electorate, encouraged to buy their own homes,
are still smarting from the tax concession changes and are concerned
that further changes will increase their financial burden. Some
assurances about the future are required and the present position needs
to be reviewed.
The high media profile of the Cabinet members has focused public
attention on this body. Here are the leaders of today and the potential
leaders of tomorrow. This close scrutiny for emerging, fresh talents by
the public must now be catered for in the Prime Minister's consideration
of the frequency of reshuffles.
Most people are aware of the advantages of the European Union but the
same people are apprehensive of the changes from their original
perception, and we are emphasising that concern is now apparent at the
speed and number of changes affecting everyday life and we suggest the
views of the electorate must be carefully listened to, otherwise an
anti-European groundswell of opinion might develop.
The reduction in income tax continues as a noble goal in Conservative
thinking but many are not averse to occasional minor increases
specifically to cater for cash crises in any of the major areas of
concern and we are suggesting this view be considered ''when
applicable'' to ensure that policy on income tax is not totally
blinkered.
Crime and punishment is a constant ''doorstep'' issue and covers a
wide area of debate from a ''life sentence'' meaning a life sentence to
the number of policemen on the beat, and our experience forces us to
suggest this area of concern is, by far, the most important and merits
top priority in policy thinking.
On race relations policy, there are those who think legislation has
gone too far and those who think it has not gone far enough. We suggest
this be brought back into public debate and the whole issue be reviewed
and updated.
In spite of considerable improvement in the NHS there is still a great
deal of unease both within the service and among the public. The control
and administration have been much criticised, and these general
criticisms must be seriously considered and catered for, otherwise
isolated and specific problems will continue to be highlighted by the
media and to cloud people's judgment.
Quango positions are here to stay but there is a need for more
openness in the selection of such personnel and free access should be
made to information regarding tenure of office and salary structure. We
are surprised at the number of people who feel strongly on this subject.
As a separate country within the UK we seek to encourage a separate
Scottish identity within the Conservative Party producing some form of
Scottish manifesto to outline the Scottish Conservative Party's policy
on matters solely Scottish.
These are the main points covered. The list is not exhaustive but it
is a start. Simplistic the document may be, fundamental it most
certainly is. It deserves debate.

MURRAY RITCHIE in his Euroview column hopes for an SNP victory in the
Perth and Kinross by-election (May 8). He goes on about another Labour
Party drone or a space-invading Tory alien. I am sure that some of the
inhabitants of that constituency will agree with his preferred choice.
However, many thousands won't and will vote for other candidates -- that
is called democracy.
Murray Ritchie goes on to explain that the European Union is one thing
going for the SNP. He goes through a number of different scenarios about
an independent Scotland operating within the European Union. The points
he makes are either wrong or at best misleading, which I find amusing
coming from an ''experienced journalist''.
The fundamental point that he does not address is that if Scotland
were independent within the European Union what power would it have? If
all eight MEPs from Scotland were nationalist would we suddenly see a
strong dynamic force emerging in European politics?
Less than six months ago the two Nationalist MEPs held a press
conference in Brussels to complain that they had no power as the
Socialists and the Christian Democrats held all the power between them.
Murray Ritchie conveniently seems to forget this.
The reality of European Parliamentary politics is that the decisions
are made by the three main parties -- the Socialists, Christian
Democrats, and to some extent the Liberals. The rest are fringe players,
including the ''sacred cow'' of the SNP.
Scotland currently holds two of the top positions within the
Parliament in David Martin and Ken Collins. We therefore have more
influence than most and the six Scottish Labour MEPs, being part of the
62-strong British group which in turn is part of the 223-strong
Socialist group, are clearly influential.

THE HERALD aspires to be a national broadsheet. There was wonderful
news about Scottish exports (May 9), even Alf Young could find no way of
making it seem like a disaster, and yet it was given a miserable couple
of column inches at the very bottom edge of the front page and less
importance than the ridiculous reinstatement of the English rugby
captain or the punishment of a snooker player.
In the same edition John Macleod complains that the Government treats
Scotland with contempt. I would suggest that The Herald has clearly
demonstrated its contempt for Scottish industry and its desire to find
as little good Scottish news as possible on the off chance that it might
just favour the Government.

Germany's Chancellor hopes to retire by 1998 but, as Steffen Grimberg
reports, there is no successor in the wings
IS there life after Kohl? At 65, the German Chancellor will celebrate
his 13th anniversary in office later this year. And although he doesn't
seem actually tired of it, recently he has increasingly been hinting at
the post-Kohl era. His only trouble: nobody is listening.
When Helmut Kohl announced in 1994 that this four-year term would be
his last, nobody paid attention. When he specified that he wouldn't rule
out stepping down even before 1998, very few stirred.
Kohl has achieved more than he could ever have dreamt of in 1982 when
he took over from Helmut Schmidt. He can be content as a man who got
everything -- political success, a safe place in history as the
mastermind behind German reunification and a healthy family life which
has survived more than a decade of world politics.
Everything, that is, except an heir apparent.
Like his larger-than-life idol Adenauer, Germany's first and
longest-serving Chancellor, Kohl has always made sure the bright lights
of his party either trod his line or were left out in the cold.
Back-bench rebellion is unheard of, and original thinking has been
largely confined to the fringes of the party. Nobody can get near Kohl,
let alone into a position to overtake.
Now the Chancellor finds that he has fortified his power base to such
an extent that there is no-one waiting in the wings.
If this dilemma isn't already bad enough, public opinion in Germany is
longing for change that goes well beyond Kohl. Trust in a political
system and party landscape, that were set up 46 years ago, is rapidly
dwindling. Hopes that reunification would result in more direct
political participation failed. Party membership is down. A new group
suddenly appeared on a political scene where election turnouts had
always topped 70% -- the non-voters.
Frustrated students see themselves as Kohl's children, and political
analysts point out that those below the 25-year threshold have been
living through the Kohl era only, experiencing a political system that
has become more and more self-content and arcane.
With an entire Christian Democratic Party at a loss for a successor,
the only man widely tipped as a potential heir is Wolfgang Schauble,
parliamentary leader of Kohl's Christian Democrats and a loyal supporter
of his master.
But Schauble, already described in the influential weekly Die Zeit as
Kohl's sub-chancellor, seems more like the lesser evil than a first-rate
successor.
He earned his spurs as arch-conservative minister of domestic affairs.
Confined to a wheelchair since an assassination attempt during a 1990
campaign on behalf of Kohl, the 52-year-old lawyer is too much a man of
the Chancellor's own breed. His exceptional vigour and stubbornness have
earned him huge sympathy across the country but the support comes for
his refusal to give up, and his insistence on carrying on with official
duties even during his rehabilitation period. It has little to do with
Schauble's political ideas.
On top of that, it has become harder to find out what he actually
stands for. Earlier last year, he published a book calling for a
nationalistic angle on future German politics and openly opposing Kohl's
view on Europe. After a fierce public debate, and an even fiercer one
behind closed doors at CDU headquarters, he now follows the party line.
Even with his newly adopted attitude towards Europe, he increasingly
sounds like the chief himself.
But other contenders for the job are lacking. Defence secretary Volker
Ruhe was too ambitious in the early 1990s, costing him his status as
deputy party chairman three years ago. He never recovered fully from
this snub, but enjoys strong support among NATO allies and is tipped for
high office in Brussels.
Theo Waigel, the powerful finance minister and head of the CSU at
Bonn, is at odds with Schauble while most of the CDU MPs are cross with
him because of internal CDU-CSU bickering.
Even more than new leaders, new visions are lacking in the CDU camp.
Heiner Geissler, like Ruhe a former deputy who fell foul of Kohl
because he had too many ideas of his own, is one of the few remaining
thinkers within party ranks. In a recent debate with Green Party
politicians, he said he wouldn't rule out CDU-Green co-operation that
goes well beyond the toleration policy practised in various town halls
already.
''Social Democrats find it harder and harder to meet questions of a
modern society with modern answers'', Geissler said in a recent
interview. ''In a coalition with the Green Party, progress in certain
areas would be much easier than in a grand coalition with the Social
Democrats.
''Of course, we are not talking about next week, but about reform and
change in a democratic society.
Although his view earned warm praise from young Germans, Geissler's
popularity within his party suffered another blow.
So if Kohl really decides to step down before 1998, there will be no
heirs -- only Wolfgang Schauble, the sub-chancellor.

TILT your head, like a bird listening for a worm. Behind the din of
justifiable outrage over the share-options rackets being operated in the
privatised utilities, another sound can be heard. It is the soft, moist,
sucking sound of hands being washed. These are the hands of the leaders
of this country; the governmental hands charged with the task of holding
safe all that we believe to be of importance; our values, our integrity,
and the decency which used to characterise the conduct of public life
and of business in this country. Certainly, the hands (or to be more
accurate, their owners) deplore what is going on. The Prime Minister
expresses his disappointment at the recent greed of some corporate
officers. and says that the remedy is in the hands of shareholders. This
is rubbish, as any Standard Grade student would know. Individual
shareholders may be outraged but can do nothing in the face of the
massed force of institutional shareholders, who have a vested interest
themselves in keeping up boardroom wages and perks. (The current
euphemism for this is ''remuneration'', but beware of anyone using this
term; they are the seriously acquisitive.)
Worse, far worse, than the excessive self-regard in some gilded and
private boardrooms in this land is the greed of some leaders of newly
privatised industries, and particularly the utilities such as gas,
electricity, and water. Here we have a case of, not just snouts in the
trough, but trotters, bellies, and curly tails as well. The latest
revelations make grim reading. Most centre on the share options which
officers of utilities have extended to themselves with thoughtful
generosity and a wary eye on exercising them before the next General
Election brings the possibility of richly-deserved comeuppance. The
theory runs thus: share options are awarded to executives as an
incentive and to reward success. This may be relevant in private
companies where there is genuine competition. In the utilities such as
gas and electricity provision they are a grotesque parody of reward, for
quantifiable competition does not exist. The height of abuse has now
been reached if the details of the National Grid chairman receiving a
#350,000 profit from share options sold to his own company before
trading in company shares had started are true.
Scandals have happened because of the enactment of ideological
fixations by the Government. They should properly, therefore, be within
the remit of the continuing Nolan Committee's inquiries into standards
in public life. They will not be, rest assured. The President of the
Board of Trade will assure us that Government intervention would be
wrong, and as Government intervention is all that Lord Nolan could
advise, what would be the point? The sound of hand-washing stops at this
point, for the next issue of public concern is not for washing away, it
is for outright denial. Fists clenched, hands-in-pockets, the Prime
Minister and his colleagues insist that the funding of political parties
is no part of the Nolan Committee's remit. It loooks as if Lord Nolan
may agree with this, although regretfully. While the current method of
funding political parties allows individuals or organisations to
potentially buy influence, and while the Nolan Committee has already
examined the sponsorship of Labour MPs by trade unions, a widening of
the examination would require clarification or amendment of the
committee's terms of reference. This the Prime Minister will not allow.
He is wrong, of course, and brings all the more suspicion on his party
because of it.

YOU know the boy Nolan could be coming on to a good game. In his first
outing, checking up on MPs' outside interests, additional incomes, and
relationship with lobbying groups, some of the commentators thought his
tackles a bit on the soft side. But from what we've seen since, he seems
to have developed a real appetite for getting in there behind the
stuffiest defences.
And now the good Lord is demanding the right to alter the terms of his
contract to include peering into the murky world of party finances. In
fact by his way of it the original remit wouldn't really need much in
the way of stretching since money provided in return for favours could
cover not just cash for questions, but cash for political honours.
There has always been the most stout resistance to any suggestions
that the donations to the Conservative Party coffers be scrutinised.
From a Tory point of view there are very good reasons for this. One is
that some of its benefactors are people or organisations in other climes
whose reputations are somewhat less than savoury.
What they get out of pumping money into the party often has to do with
the tax status of any British subsidiary, not to mention ridding
themselves of any minor inconvenience such as a limit on the amount of
time they may spend here as non contributors to the Inland Revenue. You
will recall that the only minority community assured that they had
nothing to fear from the zealotry of the immigration officials were rich
businessmen for whom a unique welcome mat was to be laid down.
Closer to home there are a range of devices through which
British-based companies and industrialists may keep the Tory kitty
afloat. Some of these are organisations such as British United
Industrialists and a network of industrialists councils, all of which
are used to channel money into organisations promoting free enterprise .
. . aka the Tory party. This methodology handily circumnavigates the law
requiring companies to declare donations of more than #250 to any
political organisation.
However the interesting corollary of all this, and the main reason
that Nolan's bid to widen his investigation will be fiercely resisted,
is that there will be an embarrassing number of donors whose largesse
was followed, with somewhat indecent haste, by the award of an honour.
In modern times the Baroness Thatcher was the undisputed champ in any
cash-for-gongs contest. In her first five years in office she handed out
11 peerages to private-sector industrialists, some of whom didn't have
to go through the tedious stage of mere knighthood. Between them, their
companies had coughed up some #1.9m to the cause. At no extra charge she
turned another 64 chaps into knights, some 44 of whom had popped another
#4.4m into the right till.
So, by the time she was into her second term the going rate for gongs
was pretty well established on the political black market. This, of
course, was hardly a practice invented by the blessed lady; she just
proved more adept, not even to mention more brass necked, than most at
exploiting it.
But the problem for Nolan is not just getting a green light to proceed
. . . and the fact that Tom King for one is threatening to leave his
committee if he does, underlines the case for a wholly independent
membership . . . but in effecting any real change.
A brief glance backwards indicates that this is a pretty-well-trodden
path, yet nobody who has tried to clean up the system has yet succeeded.
When Lloyd George started handing out honours like sweeties it was
largely to bolster a personal political war chest since he couldn't rely
on the party he'd split to come up with secure backing. In his first
term Lloyd George contrived to distribute some three-and-a-half-thousand
baubles . . . at a price.
So shirty did their pre-existing Lordships become about the arrival of
so many shiny new peers that a couple of dozen of them wrote to the
Times. Their letter concluded that it would be a very grave evil that
the money obtained by the disgraceful traffic in honours has gone to
swell and, if rumour is true, has mainly constituted, the large party
funds which are at the service of party leaders and are used for party
purposes. Plus ca change and all that.
It was all these shenanigans which finally led to the 1925 Honours
(Prevention of Abuses) Act which specifically outlaws the practice of
using honours as an inducement for donations. Two years as a guest of
Her Majesty or a fine up to #500 were the penalties for misdemeanours
under the Act, though the court records haven't exactly been littered
with prosecutions since.
It's easier for opposition parties to make political capital out of
these malpractices of course, because, by definition they are less
likely to have been wooed by the more influential end of the pinstriped
market. (Though the Libs, in various guises, don't do badly out of the
Sainsbury connection.) But the more electable Mr Blair looks, the more
he will suddenly find City doors and country drawing-rooms open at his
footfall. And it's interesting to note that the Labour Party is
currently displaying the same coyness about the identity of those
involved with the Industrial Research Trust first set up to support John
Smith's office, and now benefiting several of Labour's top spokespeople.
One answer of course would be to dump the whole honours system on the
grounds that it is now terminally discredited. Yet that would also
penalise those whose efforts for their country have been both heroic and
uncalculating.  But the minimum requirement is a radical overhaul
stripping out the class consciousness and rooting out the endemic
corruption.  Putting party funds under the microscope is not a bad
starting place.

A REASONED and well-informed debate on the 1918 Education Act would be
valid in any West of Scotland publication, but a diatribe such as that
in your Open Forum is an insult to your readers (May 9).
I am surprised that The Herald should allow space to Gerry McSherry to
vent his spleen on its readership, even under an Open Forum heading.
The whole piece was couched in such ridiculously rabid and intemperate
language that it was not clear to me, at first reading, whether it was a
spoof or a genuine article.
Mr McSherry's description of a Rab C Nesbitt world where ''the dark
forces of Rome are abroad'', and where innocent children are dragged off
to ''St Papes'' or ''Prod Street'' schools would be laughable were it
not in such poor taste.
His claim that Roman Catholic parents send their children to Catholic
schools, not through choice, but because of ''a highly irrational fear''
of the clergy (or ''those who have no children'') and ''the threat of
eternal damnation'' I find to be gratuitously offensive.
His absurd rantings can surely achieve nothing other than the feeding
of the very sectarianism he claims to deplore.

I READ with interest the article by Gerry McSherry (May 9). I cannot
quarrel with his plea for an end to the sectarian divide in our
educational system in particular and Scottish society in general.
What I would query is whether ''religion'' in Scotland as represented
by Roman Catholics and Protestants is in any way relevant to or remotely
representative of the Scottish people.
Is it not time that the theological faculty of our many fine
universities commissioned a poll into the religious persuasion of Scots.
There are many Scots who are atheists or agnostics, so we can rule
them out. Of the remainder some Scots are not Christians but adhere to
Judaism, Islam, Buddism, Hinduism, or a hundred and one other beliefs.
Then there are the thousands of New Age people who just do their own
thing, and where would you place the Jehovah's Witnesses and Seventh Day
Adventists?
What's left is Christian, which in turn subdivides into hundreds of
sects and subsects. This makes a nonsense of special educational
provision for any particular group.
Education should be secular, educating our young people in tolerance
and understanding. What religious education parents or church provide
outwith school hours is entirely a matter for themselves.

Richard Giullanotti is an Aberdeen fan and a lecturer in sociology at
Aberdeen Unversity. His love for the Dons has taken him to most grounds
in Scotland, providing a background that has led to the publication of
two books on fan behaviour. On Saturday he was at Brockville for
Aberdeen's relegation match against Falkirk. Here are his observations
FOR Aberdeen supporters at least, the relegation dogfight seems to
offer a grim distraction from Scottish football's terminal boredom.
While Ibrox's ritual of triumphalism completes another league season,
Dons fans face another week of football vertigo, as the side peers into
the first division abyss.
Yet, however the home and away play-off goes against Dunfermline, this
season might just have more impact on the club and its followers than
any of the past six ''runners-up'' seasons.
After the heretical sacking of manager Willie Miller in February, the
directors, players, managers (former and current), and supporters groups
haved cobbled together an alliance, formidable though not entirely
stable, of a kind unseen since Fergie's reign at the club, without the
adhesive quality of silverware.
The fraternity provides real grounds for optimism -- from meetings
between directors and agroup of fanzine editors, and free supporters'
buses to away fixtures. And there's the atmosphere at matches. Anyone at
the past three can only marvel at the difference. Quite simply, dissent
voiced from the stands at the players (even McKimmie) is no longer
tolerated (though MacKinnon may be drinking in the last chance saloon
next season).
Saturday's match at Falkirk was a case in point. After easily selling
out for Dundee United at Pittodrie, there was a desperate scramble for
an allocation of fewer than 7000 Brockville tickets. While middle-aged
men slept overnight in car queues at Pittodrie, some younger fans were
trying to buy 50 tickets at a time for friends. Others adopted the Old
Firm tactic of buying dozens direct from the host club.
Before departure for the match we were treated to conflicting police
''intelligence'' on the likelihood of trouble. While the media reported
Falkirk police as being on full alert for an Aberdeen casuals invasion,
local CID strangely revealed they had information about the casuals'
intended rendezvous in Stirling. Predictably, the casuals changed their
intinerary, effectively leaving the CID to do their job all over again.
For Aberdeen fans, travelling to fixtures beyond Dundee (always, next
season) means making the game a ''day out'', and drink is a vital
ingredient. Three ''dry'' buses from the core supporters' club left at
8am, eager to arrive for opening time in Falkirk. By 9.30am in Aberdeen,
pubs along the city's shore were busy with the early trade. Travelling
in a convoy of buses and Transit vans, the bevvy caused inevitable
delays: regular stops to irrigate the roadside, and close encounters
with the police patrol cars.
This exodus of fans recaptured the carnival atmosphere of the old
Hampden sojourns: good spring weather, passing and being passed by buses
and cars full of fellow fans; an increasingly bleary-eyed look on all
but the driver; intensified noise and optimism about an easy win over a
poor team playing in blue.
Arriving in Falkirk by 1.15pm, the central bars were already packed
with inebriated visiting fans. Doors were policed by publicans: ''Sorry
lads, full up in here.''
A line of about 60 Aberdeen casuals sauntered towards a bar sheltering
the local crew. A few defensive whips of a pool cue were offered at the
door before the police intervened.
A couple of officers monitored the visitors as they took the liberty
of strolling around the city centre, before another brief attack on the
bar was mounted an hour later. Several lads were nicked in the course of
the day. According to rumour, one boy ''misjudged his distance'' from a
plain-clothes officer's head, and he was promptly transferred to the
police station.
By 2.30pm most bars were clearing as Aberdeen fans shuffled on to
virtually all sections of Brockville's terracing.
Dare we admit it; dumps like Brockville can be a source of nostalgia;
for an era when you'd find yourself swaying among a good social mix of
unknown fellow supporters; where you would find your own vantage point
within a raucous gathering, without a steward shepherding you to a
lonely seat beside an impassive family of anoraks.
Must supporters really choose between these extremes of ground:
traditional and modern?
At the game itself there was little doubt about the result even before
kick-off. Around two-thirds of the ground was crammed with boisterous
visitors, which had a galvanising impact on their team. Only at 2-0 in
the second half did the abuse focus on Falkirk players and tempt them
into playing.
While the usual wired-up idiots were transmitting lies about
Motherwell scoring against Hearts, pies were being returned with speed.
The expected post-match celebratory pitch invasion was counteracted by
police ringing the perimeter, but the occasion went slightly flat on
realising only a play-off place had been secured. The team trooped back
on to the field to acknowledge the fans' support, as Falkirk fans opined
dissenting views on the Reds' chances.

I WAS one of many who lodged capital sums with both Scottish Gas and
Scottish Power in an effort to avoid paying the VAT on relevant
household bills.
Recently I moved house, incurring the necessity of having to change
both gas and electricity area offices.
It may interest your readers to know that in such circumstances
Scottish Gas will transfer the balance of any outstanding credit to
their respective office, for its continued use as originally intended,
whereas Scottish Power return the outstanding credit balance on their
account by cheque to the customer, and thereafter all future electricity
bills are subject to VAT.
Is there a logical or legal explanation for this deviation in policy
between two private companies providing similar services to the general
public?

THE threat of electoral extinction, at least as foreshadowed in
numerous opinion polls (and the local election results), is forcing
Scottish Tories to re-examine their attitudes to devolution. This should
not be suprising for political parties have to be flexible, able and
willing to respond to moves in public opinion; and devolution is itself
a remarkably elastic word. Its political implications range from new and
distinct Scottish political institutions with (in the proposed Labour
model) or without fiscal powers to the sort of transfer of
administrative powers which created the Scottish Office in the last
century. The contemporary implications all concern new institutions and
the degree to which these can maintain the United Kingdom with its
advantages for all the partners, while meeting the aspirations of Scots
for a bigger and more direct say in our own governance. Scots Tories
have been reluctant to enter debate about these matters: their
leadership has preferred to present a near-monolithic refusal to
contemplate any change in the existing constitutional arrangements
within the United Kingdom. The Prime Minister in particular has been
admamant in his hostility to change, believing that it was this stance
which helped his Scottish colleagues to improve both their share of the
vote and their Parliamentary representation at the last General
Election.
Few Scots Tories believe that a repeat performance is likely whenever
the next General Election is called, and significant cracks have now
appeared in the monolith. Mr Rifkind made his already celebrated remarks
about being able to live with devolutionary proposals within hours of Mr
Major's re-statement of his own inflexible opposition. Mr Stewart, who
was himself a junior Scottish minister until recently, has neatly sought
to make public reconsideration of the matter palatable by talking about
evolution rather than use the D-word, but the effect would be the same,
to make Tories discuss the issue without laying themselves open to
charges of treachery. This fate befell those Cathcart Tories who tried
to open up this issue last week, and was an ill-considered reponse to
their brave effort. Major political parties have to function as broad
churches for they have little future as sects (the lesson Labour learned
in the last decade). The Tories' need to escape from the narrow
confinement to which they have committed themselves on devolution seems
to have been grasped at the top apart from Mr Rifkind, for Mr Michael
Forsyth is also aware of the attractions of internal party debate about
an issue which has to be addressed. That is a departure of some
significance, not least because Mr Forsyth might reappear as a major
player of the Scottish scene were Mr Lang to be made Chairman of the
Tory party in succession to Mr Hanley.
There is nothing improbable about open debate on devolution (however
defined) in Tory ranks. Indeed, in the 1970s the party was not opposed
on principle to devolutionary proposals -- only to the particular
proposals embodied in the late John Smith's Scotland Bill. Many Scots
Tories, particularly in the business sector, are indeed hostile to the
notion now, but that is not the same as denying all debate within the
party, which is the effect of the Lang-Major line which gives the
impression that the Government is simply insensitive to Scottish
sentiment. Open debate need not lead to new splits -- for Scots Tories
are really divided on devolution already -- but it might produce a
formula which would retain that support which wants some change though
not separation. Scots Tories ought to be wondering why their grip on
Perth and Kinross is so uncertain and that the party most likely to
dislodge them there is committed to taking Scotland out of the United
Kingdom.

Pensions may not figure in the great scheme of things for many women,
but they should, discovers Grace Franklin.
MARK MORPURGO is a modern knight in shining armour. He is fighting the
cause of poor widows. And now that a vital Act has been pushed through
Parliament to protect war widows in particular, his battle is
highlighted. For he has pledged to do his best to protect all widows and
other women who get a raw deal from pension schemes.
This widows' champion has become so angry at the inequalities suffered
by women throughout the entire pension business, that he has written a
book to help women plan a better future for themselves.
As a married man and a financial expert, Mark, is especially keen to
see wives and widows better provided for.
''Only 17 per cent of women have enough National Insurance
contributions to get a full basic state pension in their own right. That
figure gets worse and worse each year. Most women have a career break --
seven years on average. They spend time raising their children or
looking after some sick or elderly relative. During those non-earning
years they are not building enough contributions to get their own state
pension,'' explained the man who was a barrister in England before
plunging into the world of insurance broking.
Women who are at a particular disadvantage, are those on low pay or
working part time. ''They often assume they are OK because their husband
is working. They could be in serious financial difficulty if they get
divorced.''
The complex subject of pensions for women no matter their marital
status, is a minefield.
Glasgow based Mark explained: ''The vast majority of women will become
widows. But they have not worked out what widowhood means. When you know
that the average man only has #49,000 insurance coverage -- including
his mortgage -- you begin to see how little his widow will have left to
live on.''
According to the Equal Opportunities Commission, half the women due to
retire in 2003 (only eight years away) will have income below the
poverty line.
Among present day pensioners, four times as many women as men, claim
income support. And the UK spends the least per head on state pensions,
than any developed country.
Mark unearthed these and other facts when he was asked to do a
research paper on women and pensions for the Engender Audit 95. The
Engender Audit is an annual update of information on gender issues in
Scotland. It is due to be published soon.
''Having been in the insurance business for 20 years, I was always
aware of the disadvantages women suffered when it came to pensions. They
seemed logical -- women had career breaks, they retired earlier than
men, therefore, they would have less pension to call on when they
retired.'' But Mark became increasingly incensed as he researched the
subject.
''There was no one place a woman could go to get impartial advice on
her pension. There were tomes of information available only to insurance
advisors and mostly written in heavy, technical language. Apart from
that, the only information available for individuals was the highly
selective material produced by individual companies to promote their own
products.'' He knew from his 20 years as a marketing sales executive in
insurance, that women lean heavily on their husband, partner or employer
for guidance on pension matters.
''Yet, most occupational pension schemes pay only half the husband's
pension to his widow. That simply means that when the husband dies, the
wife's income is halved, overnight.
A couple who had put away a reasonable pension through the husband's
company scheme believed they would have two thirds of his salary to
retire on. He died two years after he retired. His pension had only been
one quarter of his salary. And on his death, his widow received only one
eighth of his salary as her widow's pension. ''She had to sell her home.
And that is not uncommon,' said Mark.
But his research made him realise how many widows were in poverty
because of lack of planning for their own financial future, as distinct
from planning for the couple's retiral years.
''Pension schemes often stipulate that if a widow remarries she loses
the pension her late husband contributed to. I see that as legalised
theft. It comes from the Victorian attitude that a woman is dependent on
a man.'' But he believes the state pension scheme is just as Victorian.
''I'm very angry at a government which hides behind the statutory state
pension scheme. It is laughable as income. If you run a car you have to
make the choice between eating and heating or your transport. That is no
choice.
''Unless women take ownership of their own financial future and make
personal arrangements to top up their own company pension scheme or have
a private scheme, they will continue to be poverty-stricken in
retirement,'' said Mark who is 46 and has been saving for his pension
since he was 22.
''Every woman -- earning for herself or not -- should do something
early in her life to build a pension for her later years.''
On average, women live six years longer than men. In addition 37% of
married women aged 25 at present, will be divorced. And 70% those who
are married will become widows.
''People need to get away from the idea that the state will look after
them. It won't. It is particularly hard on widows, for most of them will
not have a pension in their own right. They will be dependent on
contributions to the state scheme from their husband to provide their
pension.' The one thing that is sure -- there are a lot of very poor
women when they reach retirement age.''

Morpurgo, price #12.95, TWM Publishers, is due out on June 12.

EUROPE'S largest semiconductor facility, at Greenock, is to benefit
from hefty new investment as the US parent bids to exploit an
anticipated explosion in demand.
However, the as yet unquantified share of a #2230m five-year global
investment programme beginning next month is not expected to mean
additional jobs.
The workforce at National Semiconductor's wafer fabrication plant has
recently been increased by around 500, taking the total to 2100, as a
result of a previous #57m investment package now drawing to an end.
Greenock is now not only the Californian-based group's biggest
operation, it is also its ''centre of excellence'' for analogue products
which represent about 30% of the group's output, almost all of it
sourced from Greenock.
These include around 1500 different items, mainly for use in
communications, personal computers, and in the automotive sector, where
anti-locking braking systems and airbags are seen as growth areas.
Two of Greenock's three fabrication lines are being upgraded. The
plans demonstrate the growing use of analogue technology, even though in
many ways it is now seen as fairly old technology.
National Semiconductor is concentrating the emerging new technologies
at its South Portland plant in Maine. The president and chief executive,
Dr Gilbert Amelio, said there were no plans to introduce them to
Greenock -- ''certainly not for the next 18 months''.
Dr Amelio, speaking at the opening of National Semiconductor's new
European headquarters in Bavaria last week, said the corporation was
focusing its operations in order to benefit from the ''explosive''
growth expected in all aspects of semiconductor use.

A MEMORIAL is to be erected to the three Girl Guides and two pack
leaders who died when their bus hit a low bridge in Glasgow last year.
More than #25,000 has already been pledged to the #40,000 project to
build a shelter at the Glasgow Guide Association outdoor centre at
Achachardeis, near Gartocharn on Loch Lomondside.
Glasgow Guide Commissioner Alison Spurway said the memorial was
suggested by the Guides of Drumchapel as ''the most appropriate way to
remember their friends killed in the tragedy last September''.
She added: ''This proposal to build something positive for the future
will do much to contribute to the healing process and provide
encouragement to the women who are carrying on the work of the Guide
Association in Drumchapel.''
The Guides who died in the West Street tragedy were Margaret-Ann
Riddick, 11, Catherine McKnight, 10, and Laura Cullen, 10. Adult helpers
Mrs Mary McGreskin, 39, and Mrs Robina Dougall, 47, also died.
Drumchapel people were told of the memorial fund on Friday, which
would have been Margaret-Ann Riddick's 12th birthday.
Friends at Pinewood Primary School, some of whom were injured in the
crash, remembered her in their prayers.
Last Tuesday, the driver of the bus involved in the accident, Mr
Campbell Devlin, 30, was sacked by his employers for gross misconduct.
Mr Devlin, of Pollokshaws, Glasgow, was earlier found not guilty at
Glasgow Sheriff Court of causing the deaths, but was fined #750 for
careless driving.

SCOTTISH secondary school teachers are being advised to take a tougher
line on Government proposals for more ''on the job'' training for
postgraduate students.
More than #2m is to be spent on the scheme, which involves secondary
school teachers acting as mentors who will supervise, train, and assess
postgraduate trainee teachers in the classroom.
The scheme, to be introduced in August, will involve students on the
one-year course spending more time in the classroom and less at college
-- 22 and 14 weeks respectively.
However, delegates attending the annual conference of the Scottish
Secondary Teachers' Association (SSTA) were told by the general
secretary, Mr Alan Lamont, that additional teachers were needed if the
scheme was to succeed.
Mr Lamont said there was nothing in teachers' contracts to make
participation in mentoring compulsory. They had a duty to contribute to
the professional development of student teachers but that did not extend
to taking responsibility for their time in school or for assessing their
performance.
Delegates overwhelmingly backed an emergency motion calling on local
authorities ''to tell the colleges of education and the Scottish Office
that they will not implement schemes until greater and adequate
resources are made available.''
It advised members not to volunteer to be mentors unless they were
satisfied that all necessary support was in place.
Some delegates expressed concern about the advice being woolly and
ineffective.
Mr Peter Wright, who teaches at Broxburn Academy, West Lothian, said:
''All we are saying to our members is 'we do not like it but if people
promise you the earth you could maybe go along with it'. We should
simply say 'mentoring: do not do it until we tell you otherwise'.''
However, Mr Lamont said that such action would be unlawful because it
could be taken only after a ballot on industrial action had been held.
However, he said the union might come back with a proposal for
industrial action on the issue.
One of the teachers who wanted to take a firmer stance on mentoring,
Mr Bob McGarill, said yesterday that the initiative could affect the
quality of pupils' education.
Under the proposals, schools will be given money to buy in supply
teachers to cover for those acting as mentors for part of the week.
Mr McGarill, an assistant head at St Thomas Aquinas secondary in
Glasgow, said he expected heads of department to be involved as mentors.
''If we are to be involved, which principal teachers do we need to
find time for? If we have to allocate time for them, they cannot be
taking their classes. That will fracture continuity within
departments.''
St Thomas Aquinas, which is near the Jordanhill teacher training
campus of Strathclyde University, regularly takes part in teacher
training.
Mr McGarill, who is responsible for drawing up the school's timetable,
said: ''I do not think mentoring has been thought through at school
level. There are implications for timetable and workload. Until we get
these thrashed out, we will be walking into a dark room come August.''
Under the scheme, colleges would continue to be mainly responsible for
preparing students and validating their courses but mentors would be
closely involved in all aspects of their performance.

FOUR homosexuals dismissed by the Armed Forces today go to the High
Court to challenge the Government's ban on gays serving in the military.
At the hearing, seen as a test case, the four will claim their rights
under European equal treatment laws have been violated.
Lieutenant Commander Duncan Lustig-Prean, the most senior of the four
to challenge the policy, said: ''The time has come to say enough is
enough and to put an end to this injustice.''
Mr Lustig-Prean, 36, from London, was commended by his commanding
officer last June as one of his best officers. Within a few days, he was
suspended and, by the end of the year, he was dismissed as unsuitable.
The others going to court are former RAF Sergeant Graeme Grady, 32,
from London, former RAF nurse Jeanette Smith, 28, from Edinburgh, and
former Royal Navy weapons engineer John Beckett, 25, from Sheffield.
''All I have ever wanted was to do the job I loved and am good at,''
said Miss Smith. ''Hopefully, the judicial review will reveal the
stupidity and unfairness of the ban and we can return to our lives.''
Mr Grady said it was time people were judged on their records rather
than the ''outdated prejudices'' of the Ministry of Defence.
''Britain has to fall in line with the majority of our allies and
repeal the ban,'' he said.
Mr Beckett added: ''The MoD ban is institutionalised discrimination.
All I want is to have my job back and to carry on with my life.''
Homosexuality in the Armed Forces was decriminalised last year but
gays still face automatic dismissal, known as administrative discharge.

<HEADLINE>Holy row over 'cathedral' office.  Firm threatens to scrap 1000-job plan for building with 70ft tower near Stirling Castle.</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<GRAPHIC>ILLUS</GRAPHIC>

<TEXT>
A ROW has blown up over a scheme by a drugs company to build what has
been described as a mock cathedral with a 70ft tower in the foreground
of one of Scotland's most famous views below Stirling Castle.
However, if planning permission is refused, Surrey-based Scotia
Pharmaceuticals is threatening to pull the plug on proposals which could
create up to 1000 jobs.
Work is almost complete on a two-storey office building for Scotia on
the prestigious but controversial Castle Business Park, described by the
developers, Central Regional Council, as ''lying in the shadow of one of
Scotland's foremost landmarks''.
However, Scotia has now applied for permission to build a two and
three-story extension, more than trebling its office space from 3000 to
more than 9200sq m. The plan, which includes a 70ft hexagonal tower, has
attracted a barrage of criticism from conservation groups.
The most scathing has come from the Royal Fine Arts Commission for
Scotland, which warned when the business park was first proposed that
nothing should be done to upset the centuries-old relationship between
castle and carse.
It said: ''The tired and inappropriate concept of repeated mock
cathedrals with cruciform plans are deficiencies which very seriously
threaten one of the most important settings in Scotland.''
The commission said it was appalled both by the office blocks already
completed and by what was planned. It also complained of a lack of
landscaping.
Historic Scotland criticised the scale of the office block and tower,
which would lie in the sightlines both to and from the currently least
spoilt side of the castle.
The convener of Stirling Civic Trust, Mr Brian Parnell, a chartered
planner, claimed the complex and tower would be a monstrosity. ''It's
been described as a cathedral to industry which would dominate the
castle, but that's perhaps too praiseworthy,'' he said.
''People are already complaining about the views of the castle being
spoiled from the west and this seems quite unnecessary because if Scotia
want to develop they'd be welcome to do it on the ground.
''Whether they want to do this to make more of a mark we don't know
but it would be a great mistake. It would be the kind of thing that
would be talked about in the future as a blunder of planning.''
Both the regional and district councils in their statutory plans say
the site is a very sensitive one and should be treated carefully.
Members of Stirling District Council's planning committee will vote on
the proposal on Thursday, with officials recommending refusal but
councillors deeply divided.
Local member, Councillor John Hendry, said Scotia should be welcomed
but he was not convinced about the need for an extra storey.
In a report to the committee, chief planning officer Mrs Sheila Terry
said Scotia, which already has facilities in Dundee and Callanish in the
Western Isles, wanted to base its group headquarters in Stirling if it
could obtain a building of the right size and form.
The firm intended to occupy its existing new building in the autumn,
creating around 130 jobs. The extensions would allow them to increase
staff to 500 over five years.
Scotia is also considering commissioning a manufacturing plant
locally, creating a further 350 to 500 jobs over three to five years.
Mrs Terry said Scotia considered the three-storey building essential
to its plans and had strongly resisted what she described as ''the
simple answer'' -- a bigger, lower building.
She warned: ''Scotia have indicated that refusal of this application
will force them to locate away from Stirling and thus these jobs will be
lost to the town.''
Neither the chief executive of Scotia Pharmaceuticals, Dr David
Horrobin, nor the managing director of Scotia (Stirling), Sherri
Clarkson, was available for comment.

A HIGH, wide, and handsome Highland western, Michael Caton-Jones's Rob
Roy is the sort of period epic the studios once churned out for their
resident stars. It has been splendidly photographed (Karl Walter), has
scenery to delight the hearts of the Scottish Tourist Board, an
evocative score (Carter Burwell), and lavishly staged fights.
But it is a good half hour too long. What starts off as a rumbustious
adventure ends up the sort of plodding hill trek of nightmares. We are
given Hollywood's view of what Scotland was like in 1715 -- far too spic
and span -- and, in spite of the fine castles and glens, there is little
feeling for the period, let alone any suggestion of what might make
Scots different from other races.
Caton-Jones, a highly efficient director, has a leaden touch but
little individuality and appears to follow the rule that if something
worked before it will do so again. Admittedly originality often butters
no parsnips, but it is needed here.
Such high hopes were held out for this film that, for all its
superficial slickness, one would be lying in one's teeth not to say they
have been dashed. With the same cast, the same script, but a change of
period and location, Caton-Jones could make one of those Montana
range-war films with wicked cattle barons doing down a poor, but honest,
rancher forced to take his herd to market across hostile territory. Alan
Sharp's turgid script has some colourful language but his plot is older
than the hills it is set in.
Rob Roy O'Gregor (Liam Neeson, albeit big is no Big Mac, but one of
those Ulster Scots) is found settling the hash of some cattle thieves
down in the glen, after which he lopes off over the heather to his
little turf-covered bothy by the loch. There he finds wee wifie, Mary
(Jessica Lange, rather good), in bed wearing a fetching off-the-shoulder
nightie which must have been the talk of the steamie.
Rob decides to make their fortune by borrowing some money from the
Marquis of Montrose (John Hurt) to buy cattle which he will sell at a
profit. But he does not reckon with Montrose's factor, Killearn (Brian
Cox) or his catamite, Archibald Cunningham (Tim Roth), who steal the
money. Rob's was surety and he is hunted down by Sinclair. To persuade
him to break cover and become an outlaw, Sinclair rapes Mary on the
bothy kitchen table, a familiar spot for Ms Lange to perform upon.
Caton-Jones treats the material as if it were a cowboy film, which is
merely recognising the nature of the script. He also does things one had
thought never to see again. Ms Lange wears low-cut gowns which owe more
to Maureen O'Hara's wardrobe than that of an eighteenth-century
MacGregor, and is made to bend forward to camera to allow a good view of
her jiggling mammaries.
He also indulges Tim Roth. His evil schemer, with a little restraint,
could have been a stunning piece of high camp evil, but he has been
allowed to chew the scenery. Instead of wanting more, one longs for much
less.
Caton-Jones also muffs a potentially great moment. At the start of the
immaculately choreographed climactic duel with Rob, Sinclair whips off
his insanely becurled Restoration wig to reveal the bullet-headed little
nasty beneath. But we have seen him without it before when bedding and
getting with child Montrose's silly maid. This film has more cliches
than there were midges on location.
Neeson is a latter-day Charlton Heston. Given a decent script and
director he is a formidable screen performer. If not, then he too is a
cigar-store Indian -- handsome, but wooden. There is good support from
Hurt as a reptilian Montrose, Cox as an obese lecher, and Andrew Keir as
a dignified Duke of Atholl, but everybody else is awful, not just the
Hollywood imports either. It is the best film so far about Rob Roy, but
the real film about him has yet to be made.

YARROW Shipbuilders should know this week whether it has won a #200m
contract to build corvettes for the South African navy, which would help
maintain jobs on the Clyde over the next three years.
Sources in Pretoria say the South African Cabinet has now weighed the
options from the two contenders for the deal -- Yarrow and the
state-owned Spanish Bazan yard -- and is fine tuning the terms on offer
before making an announcement.
Both yards are understood to have presented 100% offset packages to
try to sway the decision. These take the form of guarantees of trade and
technical help to South African firms to the total value of the warship
contract.
Yarrow, owned by GEC, is offering direct investment and technology
transfer as the heart of its package, with emphasis on funding South
African electronics industry ventures through GEC's Marconi subsidiary.
The Scottish yard is also believed to be prepared to transfer advanced
ship construction techniques to Dorbyl Marine to enable two patrol
corvettes to be built under licence in South Africa.
A further part of the counter-trade proposals involves significant
expansion of power-generation operations in the country by another GEC
affiliate, GEC-Alsthom, which already has major commitments there.
Strathclyde Regional Council and other Scottish local authorities are
prepared to underwrite a ''skills enhancement programme'' which would
mean technical training for several hundred South Africans in Scotland.
In addition, GEC is committed to setting up a new company to market
prefabricated houses using local labour and materials. Providing
adequate housing for the former black townships has proved to be one of
President Nelson Mandela's major headaches in his first year in office.
A decision in Yarrow's favour would also open opportunities for
exchange training between the South African and Royal navies. The RN
would also offer range facilities and exercise co-operation in exchange
for the right to use key strategic bases such as Simonstown.
The entire package is being heavily underwritten by the UK
Government's export credit guarantee scheme. Assurances on the
availability of the cash were made last month during a visit to South
Africa by British Defence Secretary Mr Malcolm Rifkind.
Bazan, with the full backing of the Spanish Government, has authorised
a deal which would involve the Spanish defence ministry buying South
Africa's combat-proven G6 155mm artillery guns, naval electronics, and
air-force equipment.
Spain also proposes making a concessional loan of about #90m to SA's
smaller fishing communities to allow them to buy Spanish-designed
fishing vessels to be built locally. Pretoria would also have the right
to sell the vessels for export.
In addition, 300 skills courses designed to provide a basis for
industrial expansion, the raising of coal imports, and major grants for
the tourist industry are part of the package.

THE Church of Scotland's Church and Nation Committee has today voiced
its concern over what it sees as a lack of commitment to religious
broadcasting in the Government's White Paper on the future of the BBC.
In its report to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, the
committee says it is disappointing to find religious broadcasting
referred to in a list of specialist programmes, along with scientific
issues and programmes for children.
The Government says only that it ''expects the BBC to maintain all
these strands in its services after 1996''.
The committee says: ''Our religious heritage and diversity throughout
and particularly within Scotland are vital to the life of the whole
community and do not deserve to be relegated to a specialist interest.''
It adds that a strong BBC which reflects the culture of the whole of
the UK is vital in discussing regional and national issues, and that
this obligation, reiterated in the White Paper, is particularly
important in Scotland.
However, the committee is concerned that the proposals to implement
regional diversity are inadequately defined, with no commitment to a
financial or structural base.
Without such a commitment, it says, it is unlikely that a strong base
for the production of quality programmes could be sustained.
It is implied that production bases in Scotland, Wales, Northern
Ireland, and the main English regions will reflect the various interests
and cultural traditions within the UK, but this worthy view should not
be restrictive.
''Local interests need not be parochial in outlook. There is much
scope within Scotland for producing high-quality general interest
programmes as elsewhere.''
The committee regrets that the Government's commitment to increase the
BBC's accountability and transparency does not extend to the appointment
of the BBC governors and the appointment of the National Broadcasting
Councils for Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
The new BBC charter will provide for the appointment of the board of
governors and the establishment of the national councils.
''The committee would wish to see a system of appointments provided
that is more open than at present and subject to public scrutiny,'' it
states.
The committee asks the Assembly to urge the Government to take account
of these concerns when it frames the new charter.
The committee is to report to next year's Assembly on ''Faith and the
Arts''. In an interim report, it says the Church of Scotland, in common
with other churches, continues to be a patron of the arts, but there are
no grounds for complacency.
Among concerns expressed by artists, they are sceptical about the
Church when it sits on the fence about difficult social issues addressed
in their work. Artists sometimes see the Church as an authoritarian and
repressive force.

<HEADLINE>Memorial to Britain's worst train crash</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>

<TEXT>
A MEMORIAL has been erected to the 227 people who died in Britain's
worst rail disaster, 80 years after it took place.
Despite calls over the years for some kind of memorial for the
victims, mainly soldiers, of the crash on May 22, l915, at Quintinshill,
near Gretna, nothing was done.
However, a memorial complete with plaques will be unveiled at the
Border village to mark the 80th anniversary of the accident.
The Scottish area of the Western Front Association started a fund to
help commission a memorial at the Gretna Tourist Centre and museum,
half-a-mile from the scene of the accident.
It looks north over the site where a troop train carrying the 1/7
Royal Scots smashed into a local train. Minutes later, the northbound
London to Glasgow express ploughed into the wreckage.
Fire swept the scene and 214 soldiers, who had just started the
journey to Gallipoli, and 13 other passengers and railwaymen died.
A service was held to mark the 75th anniversary of the disaster but no
memorial was erected. When Mr John Cameron, of Stranraer, took over as
Scottish area chairman of the Western Front Association, he found there
had been moves to build one but they were never carried through.
''It was then my hope that we would have a plaque commissioned and
erected at Gretna in time for the 80th anniversary of the tragedy,''
said Mr Cameron. ''We want to rectify the position and give families
somewhere they can visit. We have achieved our goal and it will be a
memorable day when it is officially unveiled next Sunday.
''We asked for donations and, although it started slowly more than a
year ago, the money has come in. We had a couple of big donations but
much of it has come from our members and relatives of the victims.
''It appears the Caledonian Railway Company refused to erect any
memorial at the time and things just slipped by.''
Mr Adair Houston, the museum managing director, said that, although
the memorial was nearly half a mile south of the crash scene, it was
readily accessible for visitors.
''If it had been at the spot, it could have been vandalised and people
might not have found it easily. It is away from the main road,'' he
said.
Badges of the regiment will be fixed to the monument this week in
readiness for the ceremony.

AS the world winds down its VE Day celebrations, a family has finally
been able to thank personally the heroine who saved their father from
certain death -- 55 years later.
The selfless bravery of Daphne Pearson has never been forgotten by the
Bond family. As a young WAAF officer in 1940, she became the first woman
in Britain to be awarded the George Cross when she risked her own life
to drag a pilot from his crashed aircraft.
The young airman was Pilot Officer David Bond who at the end of
hostilities went on to found what was to become the world's largest
civilian helicopter group, Bond Helicopters, now run by four brothers,
Stephen and Geoffrey in Aberdeen, and Michael and Peter in Australia.
Mr Bond died 18 years ago, aged 59. His son, Stephen, the company's
managing director, said: ''We always maintain that had it not been for
Daphne's actions that day, none of this could have been achieved.
''This is a family business involving us all and it would just not be
here if Daphne had not saved Dad.''
It was only by chance that the family discovered that Mrs Pearson, 83,
who moved to Australia in 1959, was in the UK for the VE Day
celebrations.
She was one on the nine holders of the George and Victoria Crosses who
were saluted by the Queen Mother last week and the Bond family made
contact after reading about her in a paper.
''I just wanted to cry when they got in touch with me. I have found a
whole new family,'' she said.
''At the time it was very difficult to keep track of people and I
never saw him again after we sent him off to hospital. But I did get a
lovely letter from an aunt of his,'' said Mrs Pearson.
She intends to return to the UK later in the year and meet David
Bond's widow, Billie, who lives in Cornwall.
Mr Stephen Bond said: ''Dad took some time to recover from his
injuries and then he was flying in other areas and he never got a chance
to see Daphne again. This is such a marvellous opportunity.''
The Bond family arranged for Mrs Pearson and her travelling companion,
Mrs Audrey Jarvis, to visit Aberdeen yesterday, where the international
helicopter firm has its headquarters.
They took Mrs Pearson on her first helicopter flight and whisked her
off for lunch on Royal Deeside.
''We cannot thank her enough and are so pleased to have been able to
meet her. She is quite fantastic,'' said Stephen.
His father progressed to become a squadron leader flying Lancaster
bombers while Daphne had attained the rank of flight officer by the time
she was demobbed.

A CLIMBER yesterday told of the moments before his wife plunged 450ft
to her death in Glencoe.
''I cannot understand what happened,'' said Mr Andrew James, whose
wife Norma, 46, lost her balance and fell from a part of the Aonach
Eagach ridge known as The Chancellor on Saturday.
''We were hill-walking rather than climbing but that part of the path
on the ridge was quite difficult,'' said Mr James, of Newark,
Nottinghamshire. ''I had stopped to take a photograph and the next thing
I knew was that Norma had gone.''
The couple were in a party of 14 climbers from a Sheffield-based club.
Mr James had spoken to his wife moments before the accident but did not
see her fall.
Glencoe mountain rescue team and an RAF helicopter from Lossiemouth
attended but Mrs James, a sales assistant and the mother of two grown-up
children, was dead on arrival at Belford hospital, Fort William. Her
death brings this year's toll on Scotland's mountains to 26.
The helicopter was also called to the Ring of Steall near Glen Nevis
on Saturday at 10.30pm after two climbers got into difficulties. Ms
Sarah Smith, 25, of Newton Le Willows, Merseyside, was flown to Belford
hospital, where she was treated for an ankle injury. Her companion was
not hurt.
Meanwhile, a land and sea search has failed to find any trace of the
body of a woman who fell to her death with a friend while walking on a
snow-covered coastal path near Thurso.
Ms Annabel Rowe, 34, a craftworker and daughter of the Deputy Lord
Lieutenant of Caithness, was with Ms Anne King, 34, on Friday, when they
fell. Ms King's body was recovered late on Friday by coastguards at the
foot of 100ft cliffs. Thurso lifeboat crew reported seeing Ms Rowe's
body in the sea shortly afterwards but were unable to recover it.
Yesterday, coastguards searched the coastline and the lifeboat
continued the search for Ms Rowe's body but the operation was called off
yesterday afternoon.
A coastguard spokesman said a formal search would not be carried out
again, although local crews and volunteers would be asked to make
regular checks of the area.
Ms Rowe, an Edinburgh University graduate, had arrived with her friend
early on Friday at the Scrabster home of her parents for a short break.

<HEADLINE>Weapons put Sinn Fein talks 'in doubt'</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>978387160</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE next round of exploratory discussions between the Government and
Sinn Fein was still in doubt last night.
Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew's refusal to agree to
talk with Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams ahead of any moves by the IRA
to get rid of some of its weapons has delayed Sinn Fein's agreement to a
new date.
Stormont Minister, Mr Michael Ancram, had offered Sinn Fein
vice-president Martin McGuinness three days this week but Sinn Fein has
still to announce a decision and a further meeting may have to wait.
The Northern Ireland Office confirmed yesterday that Mr Ancram had
faxed a letter to Mr McGuinness setting out the arms decommissioning
terms which, the Government says, would have to be met before the talks
could be upgraded.
The Government has indicated that there had to be:
* A willingness by the IRA to disarm.
* Agreement on the way this was done and verified.
* ''actual decommissioning of some arms as a tangible
confidence-building measure''.
The letter is the clearest signal yet from the Government that the IRA
needs to dispose of guns in some way before serious dialogue between the
two sides can start.
Sinn Fein is already studying a Northern Ireland Office paper handed
over when the two sides met at Stormont last Wednesday, which outlined
the Government's views on how they might go about the decommissioning
process.
Sinn Fein has warned of serious problems ahead unless the Government
agrees to the party's immediate entry to substantive dialogue on the
same level as other political leaders.
Once the Northern Ireland Office confirms Sir Patrick's refusal to
meet Mr Adams, there must be considerable doubt over the next
Ancram-McGuinness talks taking place before an Irish-American economic
conference in Washington at the end of the month which will be attended
by President Clinton.
Apart from Ministers, senior civil servants, industrialists, and
economists on both sides of the Irish border, all the Northern Ireland
parties will be heavily represented.
Mr Adams said yesterday that he looked ahead to possible contact with
Sir Patrick at the Washington conference.
Speaking from Los Angeles, where he is continuing a US tour ahead of
the conference, he told Irish radio: ''All of the main players will be
there at the same time. Are we going to go about ignoring each other?
''It appears to me commonsense and logical that we should at least
have some informal exchanges.''

<TEXT>
THE British Museum has turned down a request for the world's most
valuable chessmen, found on Lewis, to be used in a tournament there in
case the players rub off the paint.
The Isle of Lewis Chess Club wanted British grand master Nigel Short
and Norwegian Simon Adgestein to use the 850-year-old walrus ivory
pieces.
This summer, the pieces will be returned to Lewis for the first time
since their discovery for an exhibition to run in conjunction with the
tournament.
Organisers had offered to play the match wearing gloves to protect the
94 hand-carved Norse pieces, which were found on a beach on the island
in 1831 and sold for only #84 to the British Museum.
However museum director Dr Robert Anderson blocked the request to use
the set, saying only museum staff can handle the pieces ''because of the
fragility, rarity, and importance of the chessmen''. He added that
handling could rub off faint traces of colour.
Dr Alasdair Macleod, chairman of the Isle of Lewis Chess Club which is
organising the #35,000 championship, claimed the museum had let the
pieces deteriorate.
''This is Scotland's heritage,'' he said. ''They should be on
permanent display here -- not in London. These are Scotland's Elgin
Marbles -- and look where those are too.
''They robbed us of the world's most famous chess set and now won't
even allow us to play with them.
''We will not let the matter rest. If the British Museum cannot look
after the pieces to the level where they can't be used for what they
were intended, they should accept #84 for their return to people who do
and can care for them properly.''

AN elderly woman was recovering in hospital in Glasgow last night
after being viciously attacked and robbed on her way to meet friends.
Mrs Norah Nugent, 66, suffered a fractured kneecap and wrist as well
as extensive bruising to her face. Her handbag, containing some cash and
personal papers, was snatched.
She had been on her way up the stairs leading to the Polish Club in
Glenfarg Street in Maryhill when the attack happened on Friday
afternoon. According to Strathclyde Police, she was grabbed from behind
and pulled down the stairs.
Mrs Nugent, who speaks with an artificial aid, was unable to cry for
help and lay on the ground until she was discovered by someone leaving
the club.
Last night, Mrs Nugent's son Peter said his mother would be in the
Western Infirmary for some time but was in relatively good spirits. He
said she regularly went to meet friends at the club.
He added that his mother had been unable to see her attackers as they
had come up from behind but she thought there had been two people.
Detective Constable David Elliott described the attack as a brutal
assault on a particularly vulnerable woman. He appealed to anyone who
may have witnessed the incident to come forward.

A NEW generation of commissions, a celebration of the 70th birthday of
Sir Charles Mackerras, and a host of big names are the features of the
new Scottish Chamber Orchestra winter concert season, announced today.
Following hard on the heels of the Strathclyde Concertos project, the
SCO next season launches a two-year series called the Glasgow
Commissions, designed to bring what SCO managing director Roy McEwan
called ''fresh blood'' into the orchestra's concert schedules.
Four composers -- Alasdair Nicolson, Haflidi Hallgrimmson, Sally
Beamish, and James MacMillan -- will work with artists from other art
forms. Nicolson will work with choreographer Laurie Booth, Hallgrimmson
with painter Craigie Aitchison, Beamish with novelist Janice Galloway,
and MacMillan with sculptor Sue Jane Taylor.
The project, said McEwan, was intended to bring into the concert hall
the sort of collaborative, cross-artform work that had been going on for
some years within the SCO's development programme.
Chief guest conductor Sir Charles Mackerras has elected to celebrate
his 70th birthday in the style he and the orchestra have brought to the
Edinburgh International Festival in recent years, with a concert
performance of Mozart's Il Seraglio, for which the SCO has assembled a
star-studded cast, including Anthony Rolfe Johnson as Belmonte and
Stafford Dean as Osmin.
There are more great names among the other guest artists this season:
pianist Alfred Brendel playing Beethoven's Third Concerto; the best
viola player in the world, Yuri Bashmet, playing Schnittke and
Hindemith; violinist Cho-Liang Lin playing the Beethoven Concerto;
pianist Mikhail Pletnev playing Mozart; and the superb Russian bass
Dmitri Hvorostovsky, who will sing Mussorgsky's Songs and Dances of
Death.

A SHOCK showman will start his tour in Glasgow tonight brandishing
machetes instead of loaded shotguns, after police intervened.
Mr Jim Rose had planned a Wild West act in which he would trust his
bulletproof vest for protection while 21 people in the audience fired
simultaneously at him.
However, the police shot down his idea as too dangerous because the
pellets could ricochet -- so now Mr Rose has substituted it with a Ninja
(martial art) exhibition.
Pieces of fruit will be placed on a woman and chopped in half in quick
succession with a machete.
''Jim thinks that's even more dangerous than the pistols act but the
police are happy with it because it's not a fire hazard,'' said a
spokesman for the daredevil circus star.
''At least people will be just as shocked by the new act -- it's all
down to sleight of hand and the ability to control the knife.''
Seattle-born Mr Rose was warned by a number of police forces on his
tour trail -- he goes all around the country including Leeds,
Birmingham, Bristol, and Hull -- they would press for the show to be
banned if he featured the Wild West act.
''There was just so much adverse publicity, the backers were getting
worried,'' said the spokesman.
''But it should be a good show anyway -- and it may be the last time
Jim tours because he has been getting a lot of offers for TV work in the
US and he plans to concentrate on this area.''
Other highlights of the circus include rugby being played with
chainsaws and a Flymo Man balancing a lawnmower on his upper lip.
The tour, which begins in the Pavilion, ends in London on June 20.

* A woman diver whose air supply ran out was feared dead last night
after an air and sea search was called off.
The 35-year-old woman got into difficulties as she dived above a
shipwreck 10 miles off Swanage, near Poole, Dorset, with another woman
diver.
More than 20 local boat owners joined police and coastguards as they
swept across the 35-metre deep water. Two helicopters joined the search,
lifeboats, a police launch, and a dredger combed the area, while divers
hunted for the woman in nearby waters.
The other diver was taken to a decompression unit at Poole as a
precautionary measure but was released later.
The search was suspended last night but is expected to continue today.

RUMOURS were spreading last night that former Pakistan cricket captain
Imran Khan and heiress Jemima Goldsmith, whose engagement was announced
on Friday, in fact married two months ago.
The forthcoming union between Khan and the daughter of Anglo-French
tycoon and MEP Sir James Goldsmith is expected to take place in July.
However, after it emerged on Saturday that 21-year-old Miss Goldsmith
was converting to Islam, word spread from Pakistan that the couple were
already married.
The Sunday Times quoted Khan's father, Ikramullah Khan Niazi, as
saying: ''Imran got married two months ago in London.''
Reuter reports that newspapers in Pakistan are quoting Khan's close
friends and relatives in his home town of Lahore, saying that a Muslim
marriage ceremony had taken place in secret in London in the presence of
some members of both families.
The Nikah rite, by which a couple are formally joined as man and wife
under Muslim law, took place two months ago, the Nation newspaper said.
Another daily quoted Khan's father as saying he had approved the
wedding, though he had previously wanted his son to marry a Pakistani
girl.
''After this engagement, my belief became stronger that these
decisions are made in the heavens,'' he is reported as saying.
Imran Khan, who at 42 is twice Jemima Goldsmith's age, retired from
cricket in 1992 after leading Pakistan to victory in that year's World
Cup. He has since devoted himself to a cancer hospital project.
He is tipped to become the next Pakistani leader -- a rumour he
denies, saying he has no interest in politics, though he is openly
critical of the present Prime Minister, Mrs Benazir Bhutto.
Khan has been romantically linked to a number of society women in the
past, including Susanna Constantine and the painter Emma Sargeant.
A spokesman for the Goldsmith family last night refused to comment on
the latest allegations and said he knew nothing about the Pakistani
newspaper reports.
Miss Goldsmith left her parents' home in Surrey last night without
speaking to waiting reporters.
She was driven away from Ormeley Lodge, in Richmond, by her mother,
Lady Annabel, in a green BMW.

Despite the obstacles, Carole Cuthbertson has built up an impressive

move in to traditionally male trades. Particularly, as she tells Anvar
Khan, because things like brickwork are just like cake decorating -- but
on a bigger scale
IN ALL the times she's been on a building site, Carole Cuthbertson has
never seen a woman plumber or a woman bricklayer. Cuthbertson is one of
the few British women to work on building sites, and is currently
overseeing a #12 million office development in Hamilton. ''I can't help
but feel that women would have a great deal to offer. An electrician may
put a socket in a certain place, and I think I would have put it nearer
the unit for a kettle. I look at the quality of brickwork that a man has
laid and I think, well, that's just cake decorating but on a bigger
scale, why aren't the women here?''
There is an argument, that the unequal distribution of physical
strength between men and women should automatically mean an unequal
distribution of labour.
''Okay,'' says Carole, ''you may not be able to carry a whole hod of
bricks, but a skilled bricklayer doesn't often carry them either. A
labourer does that. The argument that a woman isn't strong enough
doesn't wash.''
It is hard to gauge just how much impact feminism has made in the real
world. And it matters. If there is no result, there is obviously no
practice. The equal representation of women in the workplace can be a
matter of political policy, such as within the Labour Party and their
desire for more female MPs, or it can be a highbrow debate, defined by
The Late Show and its inflated, politically correct ideas on the
importance of female perspective. All in all, the spotlight is on
feminist theory rather than practice. Far, far removed from the everyday
lives of working women, just where it is needed most.
The present career of Carole Cuthbertson reflects, in microcosm, what
a determined woman can expect in the male-dominated workplace.
An employee of Construction Management Consultants Ltd, Carole
oversees the building of any property on behalf of her client.
''In the past, if you wanted to build a factory you would employ an
architect, a structural engineer, a mechanical and electrical engineer,
a landscape architect and a builder. A lot of people now opt for the
more simple route. They employ the builder who then employes all the
different professional people. This means the client is paying one
person. If the builder realises he's over budget, he might ask the
architect to reduce the specifications of materials. But the client
might not spot that they've changed the width of the door or the size of
the windows. If you use someone like us, we can say 'Hang on, why did
you do that?' We protect the client's interests.''
Carole is the product of a one-sex private school. The Church of
England establishment, while it aimed to promote the interests of women,
complied with the rules of gender in a duplicitous attempt to
shortchange its pupils.
''I'll never forget being utterly shocked at the age of 12 near the
end of our exams. There were 90 girls altogether and they creamed the
top ten girls from each class and told us we had to do Latin the next
year. The other 60 had to do needlework and cookery. They made this leap
-- if you make the top ten you might end up being a doctor or a lawyer
therefore you might need Latin but the rest would get married and have
kids and that would be the end of them. I felt sorry for the girls who
had to do needlework and cookery, it was like they were second class
citizens. Crazy.''
Carole Cuthbertson B A (Hons) Arch, Dip. Arch. eventually became one
of three women in a class of 60 men studying architecture at Manchester
Polytechnic. The other girls left.
''They failed the other two at the end of the first year, and neither
of them were any worse than a lot of the men who were on the course. One
of them went on to do History of Art and got a first class honours, the
other, a teacher. Another girl came in on the second year. They failed
her too. And she went on to get a first class honours in interior
design. I don't know if they were easy targets but it gave me the
impression that I was hanging on by the skin of my teeth. I felt that
there were men on the course who were less capable than the women who
failed.''
This project manager is blue-eyed, fully made-up and immaculately
dressed. She's wee in stature. What clothes manufacturers describe as
petite. Psychologically, however, she's a bison.
''The funny thing is, the closer you get to the building site, where
you'd imagine the worst discrimination would be, the better the people
are,'' mulls Cuthbertson. ''Maybe they have to be nice, because I've
jumped the fence and work for the client and could make their lives a
misery if I wanted to, but they are so pleasant to me. I love it. I walk
round the site in Hamilton and the guys who are labouring remember your
name.
''There was a brilliant article in the paper the other week where men
on a site working for the council were told to stop wolf-whistling at
women who walked past. Men always work their way round things. In
retaliation they sat at the edge of the pavement and held up placards,
like in Come Dancing, with marks out of ten.''
Carole is familiar with the whole gamut of male prejudice. It becomes
imperative to survival to recognise some qualities as being worse than
others. On the scale of chauvinist atrocities, her first boss was a pig
from hell.
''The first job I had, the boss didn't believe that I could do
anything. It was a local authority position. I knew I was on to a loser
when I was talking to him in my office, and I wish I'd had one of these
(points at my tape recorder) at the time, because NALGO were supposed to
be supporting you with their rules on sexual discrimination. He said to
me 'Oh I don't like women in the office I think they distract the
oversexed young technicians' and I thought, I've got no chance here.
''Even if I was no good at my job, if I was a man he wouldn't have
said that to me. By being a woman you are giving them ammunition, a
reason to find you less than brilliant and it is really distressing.
When I came out of college I thought I'm an architect and no-one can
take that from me, and they can't, but some people don't half try.''
It has to be said that Carole's career is not a feminist gesture. More
of a result of her grandfather's influence. When she was only 13 she
announced that she wanted to be an architect just like him.
''My grandfather died when I was 17 and he never even saw me start
college which I was very upset about. He was always very supportive of
me, and he was a man who was an architect in an era where there were
virtually no women architects at all. He said to me by all means go
ahead and do it, but you'll have to be twice as good as the man sitting
next to you to be thought of equally. Twenty years on it's still true.''
Carole once responded to her workmates using girlie calendars by
placing a calendar of male nudes beside her desk. They didn't like it.
She remembers being at a meeting where there were full, frontal shots of
nude women on each wall to cater for every flick of the eye.
''There are two ways of dealing with things as a minority of one. You
can outswear men and be very masculine, or you can flutter your
eyelashes and gush ''Oh I can't possibly manage'' -- I've seen women do
this. All I've ever wanted is to be able to get on with my job. Drawing
attention to female pornography is drawing attention to the fact that
you're different and you don't want to be different.
''I am a feminist in so much that I deserve an equal right to any job
as any man. I can't stand positive discrimination because if I have got
on in this world then it's because of my own efforts. I want a job on
the basis that I am the best person for that job not because I'm a
woman.''
Carole continues: ''You don't hear of career men. So the difference
between a woman is whether she works or she doesn't. Economic pressure
brings about change rather than anything social. If you look at what
women do in the house; dressmaking, painting and decorating, these
skills could be used publicly. I don't think it's necessarily better to
be a bricklayer than a secretary, but good careers advice should be
available, and women should know that they can do what they want. If you
meet a woman who is no good at her job you feel as if she's letting the
side down. I think that of men too but it hurts more when it's a
woman.''

DESERT WARRIOR
By HRH General Khaled Bin Sultan with Patrick Seale
HarperCollins: #20
THE 1991 Gulf war was the first of its kind and perhaps also the last.
It applied overwhelming force against an enemy reluctant to fight, and
it ended with a spectacular, 100-hour ground offensive after 40 days and
nights of intensive aerial bombardment.
The new credo of modern conflict is that it should be fast and
one-sided. Public opinion and the bodybag factor will brook no less in
the era of instant battlefield television.
More than 500,000 Americans and 45,000 Britons took part in Desert
Storm. They were the main participants, and the architects of victory.
Their intervention undoubtedly prevented the Iraqi invasion of Saudi
Arabia and the very real threat of a crippling oil embargo against the
West.
Most of the leading commanders such as the US commander Norman
Schwartzkopf and the UK's General Sir Peter de la Billiere have already
penned their memoirs, fleshing out the bones of a remarkable logistical
and diplomatic effort which saw contingents from 24 countries take the
field against Saddam Hussein.
Now a new perspective of the war is published. It gives the personal
views of the senior Saudi general, Prince Khaled bin Sultan. It is not a
volume calculated to add appreciably to a deeper understanding of the
conflict, nor to the sum of military knowledge.
In Desert Warrior, Prince Khaled intersperses a rambling account of
his own privileged life as a member of the Saudi ruling family with
repetitious concern for the continued survival of that most feudal of
regimes as a linchpin of Gulf stability.
The biography-cum-war-story amounts largely to a combination of
carping over Western dominance of the military coalition,
self-aggrandizement, and obvious fear that Western influence and the
growing movement for democracy among more enlightened Arabs will lead to
the toppling of a society dominated by nepotism and repression.
The very title of the book is misleading. In the build-up to the war
itself, US and other allied commanders expressed privately their
constant frustration with the lack of Saudi military training and
competence. When the Storm eventually broke, Saudi and other local Gulf
forces were relegated to sideshow actions which would not test their
mettle or expose their many weaknesses.
Current Saudi martial prowess bears about as much relation to the
achievements of the Arab conquerors of Spain in the Middle Ages as
Mussolini's armies did to the legions of Rome. Oil wealth has made the
Saudis lazy, dependent on the labour of others, and intolerant of
change. It is an attitude which may well sweep them from power in the
not-too-distant future.
General ''Stormin' Norman'' Schwartzkopf once applauded Khaled's
appointment as Arab Joint Forces Commander as a significant breakthrough
in US-Saudi relations in the early days of the coalition. He was, in the
American's practical viewpoint, ''a guy who could sign cheques to get
things moving'' and not a lot more.
Schwartzkopf, not a man suited by nature or background to diplomacy or
the time-consuming and circuitous route to solutions demanded by Saudi
rules of etiquette, often had to stifle his frustration and his
ferocious temper when being lectured on grand strategy by a man who had
never held a combat command or been in charge of anything more
impressive than a bottomless bank account.
The Americans were always reluctant to share the full range of
intelligence sources with their Saudi hosts. Some Arab loyalties went
deeper than the necessary reliance on US firepower.
The Syrian detachment to the coalition refused to fight under US
command, and would not serve in the line alongside the Egyptians. They
also declared that they would fight their Iraqi brethren only in defence
of Saudi Arabia, but not on the offensive.
Khaled describes Schwartzkopf's attitude to the Syrian command as
''insensitive to the point of bordering on hostility''.
The Saudis set stringent codes of conduct from the start. About one in
three American vehicles were driven by servicewomen. The kingdom does
not allow women to drive. A compromise was reached by insistence that
any US female drivers must be in uniform at all times.
Prince Khaled demanded an equal number of bodyguards to Schwartzkopf.
He then demanded a seat in the war room of equal dimensions to that
needed for the ''Bear's'' ample backside.
He refused to allow alcohol for US and other Western forces, and
refused visas for singers or any female entertainers in case they
offended strict Islamic codes of conduct. Bob Hope almost cancelled a
morale-boosting trip to US troops because of Saudi intransigence.
The basic reason for most of the stiff-necked approach is that the
Saudi royal family's only real grip on power apart from oil wealth is
the fact that they happen to control a country which houses Mecca and
Medina, Islam's two holiest centres. They are terrified of offending
lunatic fringe fundamentalists who might become a focus for discontent.
Their petty restrictions caused several minor cultural skirmishes
before the start of the war itself. The first was a dispute over
T-shirts. One US-produced shirt showed a map of Saudi Arabia, complete
with principal cities. The Saudis said the location of their cities was
''classified''.
The second was a T-shirt which showed a map of the kingdom with the
Stars 'n' Stripes as its centrepiece. Both had to be withdrawn after
protests that they would lower the dignity of the Saudi royals and make
the kingdom look like an occupied country.
When battle was finally joined, the Saudis refused to hand over Iraqi
prisoners for interrogation because it would be unseemly for
fellow-Muslims to be questioned by infidels.
The only time the Saudis were called upon to fight, they attacked the
border town of Khafji in overpowering strength to oust a handful of
invading Iraqi troops. It took three days to achieve that aim.
For reasons of co-operation, the US portrayed it as a Saudi victory.
In reality, US air power broke the back of the Iraqi assault, and a few
platoons of US Marines were forced to keep retaking the same ground
because the Saudis retreated when fired upon by even a few snipers.
Khaled describes it as a personal feat of arms and ''the pivotal battle
of the war''.
It is apt that the Prince, now retired from his military career, did
not even write the book himself. In best Saudi tradition, he hired
Patrick Seale, a former newspaper correspondent in the Middle East, to
''help'' him.

IT'S the little things that go wrong in the new Europe. Ask President
of the European Parliament Klaus Hansch. Mr Hansch, in his capacity as a
Very Important Europerson, did the rounds last week of VE Day
celebrations and commemorations. Everything went precisely to plan as Mr
Hansch, a dignified and earnest German, would expect. Until, that is, he
arrived in Poland.
Protocol required Mr Hansch to lay a wreath at the tomb of the Unknown
Soldier. The troops marched smartly into place and stood at attention.
The veterans were there, sagging under the weight of campaign medals.
Polish VIPs lined up in due solemnity as visiting politicians arrived to
pay their respects in hushed silence.
Mr Hansch's turn came to lay the wreath on behalf of the new Europe.
With outstretched hand he turned to one of his underlings for the
wreath. The horror dawned. No-one had remembered to order it.
What followed was straight from an old Monty Python sketch like the
one where Cabinet ministers arrive at No 10, smiling for the cameras as
they wait for the door to open in welcome. But, of course, the door
remains shut as their dignity melts.
In Mr Hansch's case a Eurocrat was despatched in a limo at high speed
into central Warsaw with instructions to buy the first wreath he could
lay his hands on. The poor chap careered around town in desperation but
wreath was there none. He bought the next best thing in a local flower
shop.
Which is how the President of the European Parliament came to be seen
in Poland last week performing a posy-laying ceremony.
So much for the European Parliament's organisational powers. The
European Commission also had its bureaucratic failings last week. Mr
Jacques Santer, the president, produced the commission's considered
views on what should happen when the leaders of the 15 EU member states
gather next year for the much-hyped Maastricht Review. He spent an hour
or so on Wednesday giving his thoughts to reporters while he explained
that detailed and formal conclusions would shortly be available in
written form in French and English.
The French text arrived quickly enough. By Friday the English version
was still non-existent despite the fact that the European Union employs
1150 translators costing roughly 1% of the EU budget and 401
interpreters costing 0.6% of the budget which amounts, if my sums are
correct, to something like #1.2bn a year.
The commission is like that. Its bureaucrats will bore you stiff with
hideously recondite subjects -- my favourite is still a review of
''procedures governing the spreading of manure by third parties'' -- but
when it comes to something which will affect all of our lives they are
suddenly at a loss. (Not as much of a loss as the puzzled British and
Irish hacks trying to decipher technical French.)
Tomorrow we are off to Strasbourg again for the plenary of the
European Parliament. Until recently it was a pleasant duty, easily
fulfilled because Air France provided a subsidised scheduled flight from
Brussels. This happy arrangement is now buried. Call me an old cynic but
could there be a connection between the cancellation of this lifeline
and the fact that Strasbourg has been secured by France as the permanent
seat of the parliament and that subsidising people to use it no longer
matters?
At the same time the commission is busy putting the boot into airline
subsidies. Having won their way as usual on the diplomatic front, the
French have felt free to pull out of the Brussels-Strasbourg deal,
leaving it to Sabena of Belgium. The trouble is that Sabena's planes go
at the wrong times and are always full because the parliament and
commission pinch all the seats on a block-booking basis. Could this
possibly be because Belgium wants the parliament permanently in its
plush new building in Brussels and that making it difficult to get to
Strasbourg helps the Belgian cause?
Euro-MPs, who are always whingeing about the complications of getting
to Strasbourg, are now enjoying the miseries of the press corps as we
scramble for trains. By rail the journey is five hours and often much
longer despite what they say about efficient continental trains. By road
the journey is cruel in the summer heat and deadly in the fog which
often lies over the road in the Belgian stretch.
Never mind, things should soon be looking up in the Council of
Ministers. We were given a tour of the new neo-Stalinist marbled
monolith -- or series of monoliths -- which is the new home of the
council in Brussels. (The council has just helpfully cancelled the
hacks' charter flight to the summit in Cannes, inviting us to make our
own way, but that is a girn for another time.)
The new building would make the Lubianka look welcoming. The Belgians
sold the ground to the EU for one Ecu (about 80p) -- they know a
big-spending inward investment when they see one -- and the EU duly
spent #272m on a twenty-first-century office full of the latest
space-age communications technology -- except that some bureaucrat found
it necessary to provide only 150 places for the Euro-press corps which
numbers almost 1000.
Life just gets so complicated, my dears. When -- if ever -- we get
back from Strasbourg we shall have to drag ourselves off to Messina in
Sicily for the formal launch of the 1996 Maastricht Review. Marco Polo
would have found that one a challenge.
No sooner are we back in Brussels than we must plan our trip to Cannes
for the summit. I hear I have been offloaded to a hotel out of town and
must rough it in Juan les Pins.
And now the word is that the Spanish are calling an informal summit
when they take over running the EU in July. That means a few days in
Majorca in September. Ah, well. Someone's got to do it, I suppose.
A parting thought: now that there is talk of a European-wide
referendum on the outcome of the Maastricht review, wouldn't it be fun
if the Scots voted Yes along with the majority of Europeans but the rest
of the UK voted No?
In those circumstances our Government might find out what it feels
like to have a referendum on the constitution in which the result is
simply ignored because it is inconvenient.

THE Prime Minister's idea that the Tory rank-and-file should have a
say in his next election manifesto was bound to cause alarm in some
party quarters. After all, for most of its 300-year history, the Tory
party didn't much bother with ''manifestoes'' at all.
The concept of giving every party member a contribution is, as Major
told his Scottish Conference, ''unprecedented''. His use of the phrase
''a People's Policy'' will make some wince. Who does he think he is,
Tony Blair? It may sort out the toffs from the populists.
John Patten, sacked by Major last year as Education Secretary, is the
first to react. He calls for a ''little blue book, a mid-term
manifesto'' to show that Tories have not run out of steam after 16 years
in government.
He wants it by the summer, by October at the latest. He warns that
without a little blue book (note the analogy with China's former
revolutionary Red Guards and their infamous Red Book) ''we are not going
to have a hymn sheet with which to sing collectively''. Hmm.
Is this the voice of Tories who have been accustomed, more or less, to
deciding policy within the parliamentary party, with nominal
consultation, and then handing it down to the voters and those who are
expected to knock on the voters' doors? Patten's timescale is entirely
different to that of Major who intends to take a year over his
grassroots consultation.
A quick ''little blue book'' would preclude such an expanded
consultation with ordinary party members. It would be in danger of
relegating the ''unprecedented'' exercise in grassroots democracy to
mere flummery. It may well turn out to be so, anyway.
Major's motives may be far more pragmatic than democratic.
It made for a nice piece of conference oratory indicating that Major
is preparing a position which he can use to outflank his Tory critics --
left or right -- at Westminster. It may empower him to say: ''The party
wants A and not B or C, so that is what we are going to do.'' The test
will come if the party grassroots, Essex Man and all, state a preference
that would cause the Prime Minister to stand on his head to accept.
There is a risk for him in this.
Supposing Tory members of the Scottish party declare that they are fed
up with fighting about devolution and want to draw stumps and accept a
Scottish Assembly? Malcolm Rifkind, wittingly or otherwise, reopened
that debate last week. And other ministers are prepared to re-engage. It
is hard to see how Major could swallow desertion of what he sees as the
Union cause.
Supposing the Tory rank-and-file demand a manifesto that includes the
return of capital punishment? This would be a matter of extreme distaste
for most Tory parliamentarians who, broadly speaking, do not like the
idea of getting involved again with such life-or-death decisions. Would
Major promise the re-introduction of the death penalty?
It may be that, when asked, the Tory grassroots will declare that they
would rather be out of the European Union than forego more sovereignty
to Brussels. And none of this ''wait a while, we're winning the argument
in Europe, it's coming our way''.
What would this do to the unity of Major's Cabinet? There are many
other issues about which the rank-and-file Tory might have very firm
views. What about a tax-voucher scheme for private education? What about
digging supporters out of the hole of property negative equity? What
about a crash programme of house building financed by releasing to local
authorities the proceeds of council-house sales?
Major says that every constituency party is to be consulted. Some may
want no tax cuts and even more spent on health; some may want tax cuts
and increases in state spending.
The constituencies may speak with 651 different voices. Or with one
voice. Either way, once given to them, the democratisation of manifesto
making cannot be taken away with impunity. Nor, if Major is acting in
good faith, can he be permitted carte blanche to pick and chose from the
policies proffered.
Of course he hopes to guide the rank and file in their discussions. He
declared in Glasgow on Friday that he intends to be ''out and about''.
He is to take his soap box to the Tories as he took it to the nation in
the 1992 election. It is lodged deep in his brain that this tactic
produced the highest Tory vote ever achieved in a General Election.
The obvious benefit to him in this consultation process is that if it
comes off, he will be very difficult to shift as leader, before or after
a General Election. Westminster Tories are at last waking up to the fact
that their constituency parties would be exceedingly displeased if they
took it on themselves again to dump a leader.
There is already a consensus in the grassroots that ministerial and
backbench disloyalty to Major is a main cause of disastrous election
results and the Government's low estimation in the country. Be sure that
Major will build on this consensus, ''out and about'' on his
consultations. In this respect, he carries no risk.
If he really means to trust the people he calls the ''bedrock'' of the
party, he will surely build on their loyalty, particularly when the
opinion polls are telling them that he is more popular personally than
the Tory party. At the very least, he could not then be accused of being
out of touch with his party.
The Tories hate the comparison with Blair's Clause 4 campaign, but
there is a lesson to be learned from it. Because he trusted the Labour
grassroots he is the stronger for it, not only within the movement, but
in the nation at large.
Those Tories who wince at Major's idea have their own remedy. They
too, poor dears, must be out and about over the next year listening to
and talking to their grassroots, establishing their own individual
mandates -- if such, in these desperate Tory times, are still to be had.

MID-afternoon, Saturday. Hushed darkness. Suddenly, words start to
skate across the ice -- glowing headlines, swirling and dissolving in
flashes of clever lighting. The music offers echoes of Ravel's Bolero. A
spotlight picks out a couple in familiar mauve costumes . . . and then
another, and another. Four pairs, all going through the now-celebrated
motions of that winning routine. The crowd, half-tricked for a moment,
are now tensed and utterly silent. Waiting for their beloved idols . . .
When Torvill and Dean do appear, skating the piece that so altered the
medium of ice dance and brought them Olympic gold in 1984, the silence
actually intensifies. You can feel the hunger and adulation in the
massed gaze that follows every gliding turn and cradling lift. Ravel's
music blares towards a climax, the lighting fleers into a brooding red,
the pair dash themselves against the ice -- and the whole place erupts
in hectic cheerings and stampings.
Now there are some very fine, other skaters in this show -- many of
them champions and medallists from across the world -- and the show
itself is conceived as a varied, highly polished spectacular and not
just a convenient vehicle for Torvill and Dean.
But really, it's them we want and them we'll remember. Partly because
of those much-televised competition programmes -- they give obligatory
samples of their greatest hits -- but also, as the new numbers prove,
because they are such consummate artists.
Their duet to music from Carmina Burana was achingly lovely as was the
interpretation of The Beatles' song, In My Life (I Love You More) --
both pieces full of that wistful tenderness they characterise so well.
In a show crammed with neat technical tricks, acrobatic skating and
showy solos, Torvill and Dean still had the magical edge, a classic
glamour and a kind of youthful esprit that left everyone else standing,
especially the audience.

SATURDAY evening. The joint is jumping. And that's before the show has
even started. This is Mayfest's cover event, the much-talked about focal
point of a broadly ballroom dance programme. Donnie Burns and Gaynor
Fairweather are Coming Home to show Glasgow just why the world of Latin
Dance has been at their feet for so many years.
The Shed has not gone overboard in the plush and glitter-ball
department. Seating is raked scaffolding and cushionless plastic chairs.
It ranges round three sides of a high stage -- again, no frills, just a
front area for the dancers and behind that, the serried ranks of the
Andy Ross Orchestra and the Mayfest Chorus. It's the very antithesis of
all that one associates with the sequin-glam of Come Dancing.
The very starkness, the rawness of the venue, however, seemed
absolutely to Burns's taste. He breenged on stage in a loose, patterned
shirt thrown over plain black trousers and vest, looking as if he had
just stepped off a cafe-pavement in downtown Havana.
Gaynor was a tad more flamboyant, in a twenties-style shift tiered
with silky, shimmying fringes that waved ecstatically at every pelvic
thrust and languid roll of the hip. Together they cracked through a
series of ultra sharp Latin dances where both their bodies rippled and
then hardened like molten toffee hitting sudden ice.
The opening burst of Carmina Burana was the (brief) overture to a
spurt of flamenco flowing into a paso doble of almost brutal
forcefulness. Brilliant.
In and around these high points, local rock'n'roll champions strutted
their stuff, with the youngest stealing all the marches. Watch out for
10-year-old Iain Delarge who took on Burns in a backchat match and gave
as good as he got -- no mean feat, since Burns in hyper-performance mode
is as fast and slick a talker as he is a dancer.
In all, a curious event -- we all wanted more of the stars, wanted the
energy to continue, wanted, even, to join in. The wise Andy Ross sensed
this and played on after the end, allowing Glasgow to get to its feet
and celebrate not just the champions but that champion form of
entertainment: ra dancin'.

Brussels
EMBARRASSING new divisions over Europe are expected to widen for both
the Conservative and Labour parties when the European Parliament meets
today in Strasbourg. A fundamental realignment of several political
groups in the Parliament could be the outcome.
British Tory Euro-MPs are reported to be considering abandoning the
European People's Party, the centre-right umbrella group in the
Parliament, whose pro-federalist agenda is a source of continuing
embarrassment to the party at home. ''Nothing is agreed so far,'' a Tory
activist said yesterday.
However, a new ''understanding'' with the French Gaullists --
celebrating the victory last week of Mr Jacques Chirac in the French
presidential election -- and the Tories could result, according to EP
sources. This could mean the Tories and Gaullists joining forces with Mr
Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Europa.
''We are witnessing the fragmentation of the right in Europe,'' a
socialist group spokesman said gleefully.
Irish Fianna Fail Euro-MPs already sit with the Gaullists and would
also be part of the new group. If the new group does come into
existence, it would have 55 Euro-MPs, making it stronger by three than
the EP's third most powerful voting bloc, the Liberals, whose number
includes two British members.
The idea of British and Irish Euro-MPs sitting with a party which
includes the extreme right in Italy -- but not in the EP -- was quickly
condemned by Mrs Pauline Green, the London Labour Euro-MP who is also
socialist group leader.
She condemned Mr Berlusconi's group yesterday, remarking: ''We must
not forget that this is the first party that brought fascists into
government in the European Union since the end of the Second World
War.''
However, the 62-strong Labour Party is also struggling to contain
growing worry within its ranks now that its approach to next year's
Maastricht review conference appears to be less integrationist than the
EPP's. Labour's ultra-cautious approach to the Maastricht revision --
said to be the result of pressure from Mr Tony Blair's office -- could
cause trouble within the 221-strong socialist group which has already
voted for critical changes to a policy document on the Maastricht
review.
The socialists' view of what should happen at the Maastricht
inter-governmental conference has already brought strain between British
and French Euro-MPs. Some French members believe their British
colleagues are putting too strong a brake on integration.
The socialist element in a proposed parliamentary cross-party policy
on more integration was drawn up by Mr David Martin, Labour Euro-MP for
Lothians, the party's leading constitutional strategist on EU affairs
and a noted federalist.
The Martin report and an accompanying policy statement from the EPP
have now been distilled into one document and will be debated by the
Parliament tomorrow with a vote likely on Wednesday.

TEACHERS have attacked Government funding policies, pointing out that
schools are in danger of falling down, writes Barclay McBain, Education
Correspondent.
Delegates attending the annual conference of the Scottish Secondary
Teachers' Association heard how teachers and pupils suffered injuries
caused by poor building maintenance.
Mr Joe McKelvie, a business studies teacher at Arbroath High, said:
''If education spending is up, it is not obvious at the sharp end, in
the classroom.
''We have schools operating in buildings which would be condemned if
anyone were made to use them for any other purpose.''
He said education budget cuts were endangering children's education
and could result in a two-class society -- those for whom education was
available, and those for whom it was not.
''We will create a substantial underclass which will rightly ask why
we stood by and did nothing against it. If we do not speak out against
this scandal our silence will be taken as condoning current policies,''
he said.
Mr McKelvie laid the blame firmly on the Government's shoulders.He
said the crisis was not as severe as it was south of the Border, where
there were instances of parents holding car book sales to pay teachers'
wages.
He warned, however: ''We do not have pupils sharing books, but schools
are in danger of collapse.''

<RECORDNO>978387187</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE EU Habitats Directive threatens to stop major job-creating
developments in the Highlands, according to the Scottish Council
Development and Industry.
The Highland area committee of the SCDI also criticises the Scottish
Office and Scottish Natural Heritage for the way in which the
implementation of the directive has been handled.
Its submission also questions the grounds on which grey seals are
being awarded special protection, without carrying out an economic
assessment of what is described as ''an explosion'' in their numbers.
The shortage of time allowed for consultation has also been raised by
the SCDI. ''The list of Special Protection Areas(SPA), and Special Areas
of Conservation(SAC) should have been revealed last autumn. They were
revealed in April and we have only had five weeks in which to respond,''
said SCDI Highland area manager Ewen Gabriel.
The SCDI is also uneasy about the lack of information about management
agreements for these sites, once the list has been accepted. ''The SCDI
is keen to safeguard the environment, because it is fundamental to the
health of the Highlands and Islands economy, but there are acute
reservations about the possibility of severe constraints being imposed
on business growth as a result of the directive,'' said Mr Gabriel.
The SCDI submission notes rather pointedly, that while ''successful
implementation requires positive partnership between Government, the
nature conservation agencies, and owners, occupiers, and users, to date,
the consultation process has not shown the level of communication to
inspire partnership but does indicate a worrying lack of understanding
of the needs of industrial and social communities.''
Two areas in particular are identified as being under threat from the
implementation of the directive. The first of these is the Moray Firth,
where the SCDI acknowledges the importance of the resident population of
bottlenose dolphins. However, it balances this with the comment: ''The
Moray Firth is the dynamo of the Highland economy, where the coastal
fringe contains the most productive land, and the majority of industrial
and commercial activities.''
''It is particularly important that the development proposals for its
strategic harbours and opportunities in oil-related and other
developments are not impeded by SAC or SPA designations.''
It also looks ahead to planned ski developments, at Drumochter, the
improvement of existing facilities on Cairngorm, Ben Wyvis, and an
expansion at Aonach Mor. These are forecast to produce hundreds of jobs,
and to increase tourism, but they are located in proposed SACs, and this
could threaten the developments.

OUR Mr MacAulay is possessed of a cute and admirably blank face, which
is a formidable weapon in the armoury of the better class of comedian.
Eyes like raisins in custard; an imperceptible nose; limited lippage.
And by employing enormous subtlety, Fred wrings big laughs from small
realignments of his minimalist fizzog.
Indeed, some of Friday night's funniest bits were provided when Fred
merely stood on stage and looked at us without blinking, in emulation of
the sort of brain-free American who'd go on TV with Oprah Winfrey and
claim to have been abducted by aliens. And you should see and hear Fred
exhaling -- whether nasally or orally -- in deft delineation of the
differing stages of alcoholic self-delusion to which men can subject
themselves.
Plainly, Fred has an abundance of brains, all of them sharply honed.
For as well as male inadequacy, Fred cast fresh light on such staples as
the National Lottery; Scottish weather, and English mountaineering
fatalities on Scottish peaks.
Death as a no-go area for comedy? Not when Fred confronts it. He
boldly took his audience where they didn't think they wanted to go, ie
on a philosophical voyage through the killing-fields of Yugoslavia and
Rwanda, before leading them out enlightened on the other side.
Even more bravely, Fred has decided on a venomous, hilarious assault
on Scottish comedy's sole remaining taboo: Gaelic, Gaelic TV, Gaels . .
. doncha just hate 'em? On Friday a speechlessly-angry Gael could be
heard -- just -- blowing raspberries. Gales of laughter, though, are
Fred's habitual reward.

ARIEL Dorfman's tersely plotted play is a minutely observed study of
three people whose interaction represents the exploration of universal
themes, such as the validity of the tenets of democracy, the need to
ascribe guilt in the face of evil and the self-destructive force of
revenge.
This revenge is activated when a Chilean civil rights lawyer Gerardo
brings a doctor, Roberto, to his home. Gerardo's wife, Paulina,
recognises the doctor's voice as that of Miranda, the man who
orchestrated her torture at the hands of fascists 15 years before. She
promptly holds him prisoner, despite the protests of Gerardo, who once
swore revenge and now swears by the procedures of justice.
The fluctuating relationships of the trio -- the uncertain bond
between Gerardo and Roberto, the wavering trust between Paulina and her
husband -- are symbolic of the ambiguity of the themes examined; Dorfman
plots no easy answers but consistently probes the motivation of each
character, a rigorous questioning which creates a potent dynamism.
Unfortunately, a technical calamity which forced the cast to act out
the stark, brooding drama under the glare of the house lights inevitably
drained much of the tension from this production by Gut Reactionry, but
it still emerged as an absorbing piece with director Mariela Stevenson
pacing it well, with heavy but appropriate pauses.
The stark design of a white muslin-clad stage was somewhat offset by
the heavy-handed symbolism of a table composed of papier-mache figures
of writhing bodies, but the musical interludes by Carlos Amedondo were a
welcome touch, not only providing a thrilling and increasingly frenetic
accompaniment which heightened the tension, but also proving a
distraction from the visible scene changes.

A PLAINTIVE and joyous kick-off featuring Why Walk When You Can Fly?
brought tears to my eyes on Saturday night. How so? Because Mary-Chapin
surely wrote her ode to the all-conquering power of senseless optimism
-- ''In this world there's a whole lot of trouble but/ A whole lot of
ground to gain'' -- as a theme song for us supporters of Partick
Thistle.
And hadn't the song's sentiments been vindicated by events earlier on
Saturday afternoon, to wit by the jolly Jags having attained parity with
the allegedly-mighty Rangers in the Sulphurous Pit of Wickedness, or
Ibrox as it is known to some. I sat back and shook my red, yellow and
black PTFC scarf in time, admiring the many emotional hues of
Mary-Chapin's vocals. She can keen grittily, or sound strangled and
heart-broken, or simply encourage you to wallow inside her voice's
dark-brown undertow.
And she has an incisive way with a narrative, whether she's
elaborating on the true tale of poor, lost John Doe No 24 or wittily
imagining Lyle Lovett's hand upon her thigh in I Feel Lucky Today.
Sadly, however, it's not long before Mary-Chapin's musical
accomplishment can assume a relentless and self-regarding air, breeding
resentment at the sameness of Mary-Chapin's songs; Mary-Chapin's
determined bounciness; Mary-Chapin's tastefully-plodding drummer; the
refried Southern boogie all-too-often doled out by her band.
Of course, the bulk of the crowd roared triumphantly at Mary-Chapin's
every move. Supporting Rangers must be like this. Too easy to be any
real fun.

THE One Voice ensemble is a new contemporary chamber music group,
based in Edinburgh. To date, including the concert they gave to a sparse
audience on Saturday night, they have given three public concerts.
Comprised mostly of young, unfamiliar faces and names, the group seems
to want to take a slightly independent stance on the Scottish music
scene.
I'm not sure about the wisdom of that, on a scene where contemporary
chamber music has at last achieved a high profile of its own, and where
different voices and ensembles, with little trace of mutual exclusivity,
all contribute to a fairly rich mix. I'd have thought it advisable for
any new group to associate itself with the movement (for want of a
better word) rather than risk an isolationist stance. We'll see how they
develop.
On Saturday they featured music by three of the group's directors and
composers. None of it was without interest, though there was a slightly
self-conscious feel to the proceedings, and the performances, mostly
directed by Jeremy Cull, lacked zing and panache.
Ornette D Clennon's Why?, a reflection on the Rwandan tragedy, is a
gentle, sad rhapsody (becoming rather indulgent) which featured the
composer on clarinet. Jeremy Cull's Piano Trio, a gestural piece of
rhetoric, seemed a bit characterless. Geraint Wigg ins's Elements
contained a graceful first movement with a fine, lilting quality, and a
nice, rocking lullaby as finale, with some arid, systems-generated music
in between.

LYELL Cresswell's new accordion concerto, a BBC SSO commission, will
have its premiere this summer at the London Proms. But since the talents
of Edinburgh's resident New Zealander seem invariably to spread beyond
the job in hand, a recent holiday in Greece prompted the composition of
the O Satyros, a triptych of airs and dances depicting the cavortings of
the goatlike followers of Dionysus, god of wine.
First performed by the Meadows Chamber Orchestra on Saturday, this was
clearly one of Creswell's ''entertainments'', whereby the sound of a
Sousa march or, in this case, a Greek stampita (characterised by two
stamping beats in every second bar) divert his inspiration from serious
matter into more cheerful channels.
Cheerful, perhaps, but not trivial. Lasting about quarter of an hour,
O Satyros was a response to the atmosphere of Greece in springtime, a
kind of musical notebook in which indigenous rhythms and tunes had been
jotted then transformed into a pungent three-piece suite with a romantic
central interlude.
From his lively part-time Edinburgh-based chamber orchestra, Peter
Evans drew an enjoyable performance before proceeding to a couple of
concertos featuring bright young soloists.
So-Ock Kim, a 12-year-old Korean, bestowed promisingly warm tone on
Max Bruch's G minor violin concerto, but it was the more mature Alex
Taylor, a pupil of Evan's himself, who revealed the more arresting
personality in Beethoven's Emperor, culminating in a rhythmically racy
but precisely articulated account of the finale.

CONTINUING the tercentenary celebrations for Henry Purcell, Paul
McCreesh brought his highly acclaimed ensemble to Edinburgh on Saturday
night in a programme of some of the composer's lesser-known works.
The Festival Theatre space was arranged accordingly with the pit
raised to stage level, thus allowing the players to sit well forward.
The singers stood in one line in front of the curtain, coming forward
for solo passages, resulting in a warm sound and lending a rare intimacy
to this huge performance space.
Purcell composed four odes in honour of St Cecilia's Day, the most
famous being the 1692 Hail Bright Cecilia. Rather than going for the
obvious, the Gabrielli team chose the earlier ode Welcome to all the
pleasures, composed in 1683.
Accompanied by a highly original string ritornelli, the piece
demonstrates Purcell's multi-faceted musical personality. In choral
sections, bold passages of homophony sit alongside the most intricate of
polyphonic passages while solo ariosos juggle affecting melodic lines
with elaborate ornamentation.
Another ode, Celebrate this festival, composed for the Queen's
birthday in 1693 further enhanced Purcell's imaginative genius. Scored
for strings, a pair of oboes and recorders, a trumpet and continuo, this
is a substantial piece, Italianate in style and full of Purcellian
idiosyncrasies such as chromatic harmonies and cheeky word-painting.
Two anthems, In thee, O Lord, do I put my trust and Blessed are they
that fear the Lord brought home the expertise of this dedicated
ensemble. All of the voices rose to the challenges presented in
Purcell's style with ease and panache, accompanied throughout by
polished instrumental performances.

Clare Henry reports that the Tramway is moving in mysterious ways.
TRAMWAY's Mayfest exhibition is called Trust. There are 21 works by 18
international artists, including eight videos and nine sculptures. The
organisers say: ''Our intention is to establish an atmosphere of trust
between artists and audiences. We hope to encourage a thoughtful
response to contemporary art from a wide, new and often unfamiliar
audience. Make Trust your first visit to Tramway. It may surprise,
excite or annoy, but the effort will be well worthwhile.''
Last week I decided to test this out with a poll of my own. What did
Joe Public, especially Tramway's neighbours, think of the place and the
show? Would they visit, never mind trust Tramway? The idea was sparked
off by a Trust exhibit: The People's Choice, a questionnaire which is
part of an international poll being conducted by artists Komar &amp; Melamid
to determine ''The Most Wanted Painting'': ie the type of painting
preferred by the public.
I began my opinion poll in Albert Drive and Pollokshaws Road. The TSB
and Clydesdale Bank are next door. No, they never went to Tramway. No,
they wouldn't be going. Neither would nearby electricians, bookshop,
McDonald's staff nor the vacuum sales folk. Definite Noes included
Wylies car showroom and Haddows.
Blacks the opticians were better. One girl assistant promised to go.
The Asian community was more receptive and open-minded than the rest.
The video shop was helpful, so too the pharmacy and jewellers. I tried
the church, the newsagents, the pub. Tramway folk regularly drink there.
Pub regulars don't frequent Tramway.
Altogether I saw or phoned about 50 people, some locals, some art
people. The overall response was negative. The Tramway cleaners put it
in a nutshell: ''Stupid, that's what. We don't understand it.''
They elaborated: ''See that pile of sweets over there. At first we
thought it was rubbish to be cleared up -- that polystyrene stuff used
for packing -- but they're sweets from America.'' Had they read the
label? No. It says Gonzalez-Torres, Untitled (Portrait of Dad) 1991; 175
lbs of mints.
We looked at the small heap and decided it was a lot less than 12 and
a half stone. The exhibition leaflet was no help. A gallery guide
appeared at my shoulder. ''It's supposed to represent his dad's weight
in sweets,'' he explained, agreeing that Torres had either gone easy on
the sweets (shipped specially from America), or his dad had shrunk. I
ate a sweet. It tasted much the same as a British mint.
The cleaners recommended Van Warmerdam's noisy video of aircraft
landing and Tony Oursler's Little Beast, (a cloth doll transformed by
video into a screaming pig or baby) but were dismissive of his ''woman
with no clothes on'' and Tate Turner artist Willie Doherty's video:
''It's just grass, all grass.'' They were right too.
Tramway is inaccessible, both physically and artistically. Even
artists don't go, and local people find it ''unfriendly looking'' and
the exhibitions incomprehensible. Conceptual art is difficult and yet
Trust's catalogue will not appear until after the event. So who is it
for? Certainly not the public.
In fact I rate Tramway highly and applaud the idea of Trust, but once
more its presentation ignores the punters in favour of an inner circle.
The worst examples of simplistic, misleading and irresponsible
exploitation are Karen Eslea's video, Get Used To Being Stared At and
Rosemarie Trockel's Schizopullover. There's a current morbid fascination
with severe illness among artists who merely resort to archive footage.
Here Eslea edits documentary film of thalidomide victims going
shopping so that we see hastily averted glances but no victims. Yet
nowhere is this explained. There are no clues. Unless you happen on a
friendly guide, you'll be at a loss. The Schizopullover is, said my
guide, ''a simple visual joke on the idea of schizophrenia.'' One-liners
like this are unworthy of Tramway.
Trust concludes with Lawrence Weiner's wall text, When in Doubt Play
Tic Tac Toc &amp; Hope for the Best. ''Hoping for the best'' is in danger of
becoming Tramway's motto. Few, it seems, trusts Tramway, and Trust is
certainly not ''The Most Wanted Show.''
* Trust is open Wednesday to Sunday from noon to 6pm until June 18.
Next week Clare Henry reviews William Crozier, 1893-1930, at the
Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art.

AT a Mayfest/TAG Theatre Company discussion less than a fortnight ago,
writers Stuart Paterson and Liz Lochhead were agreed that separating
children's theatre and work for adults was a mistake. Paterson put it
succinctly: ''There is no distinction except that children's theatre at
its best is better.''
The new show from Visible Fictions, which begins a run of Mayfest
performances today, is a whole lot better than much of the theatre to be
seen elsewhere in the festival. It deals with big subjects -- life,
death, growing up, truth, lies, and sex -- in a direct,
non-condescending way and falls into none of the traps that bedevil
children's theatre.
It moves at an easy, unforced pace, with none of the zap, bang,
wallop, that grown-ups now think computer game-generation youngsters
can't live without, and it doesn't overuse the vernacular or childish
language. It is an antidote to MTV, a story that is as much about
storytelling as it is about anything else, a piece which could as easily
have taken the company's name as its title.
At the centre of the story Steven Leech is utterly compelling as our
hero Ben, a young man with a fervid imagination and a secret literary
bent. Leech is spot-on with Ben's use of a fantasy world as a way of
escaping his quarrelling parents and the jealousies and divided
loyalties that attend school friendships.
But the whole cast, writer Stephen Greenhorn and facilitator (rather
than director) Gillian Robertson deserve huge credit for a piece of work
that will be appreciated, and should be seen, by all ages. Pinter for
primaries.

THERE can be few more pleasant things to do of a Sunday lunchtime than
enjoy an hour of polished chamber music performance. In the last of
three highly successful Mayfest concerts, the RSNO Allander Ensemble
went for the jugular in Schubert's monumental Octet in F, a chamber epic
if ever there was one.
The Octet presents Schubert at his most eloquent, penning melodic
lines of the utmost lyricism but balancing them throughout the six
movements with tempestuous undertones both in structure and harmony.
Much of the melodic content falls to the voice of the clarinet, on
this occasion that of John Cushing. His poise in the opening Adagio set
the scene for an atmospheric interpretation, slowly transforming into a
sympathetic Allegero in which the principal melodic motifs were spun out
in sumptuous solo passages from clarinet, violin, horn and cello.
In the central Scherzo-Allegro Vivace, the mood changed to one of
rhythmic vitality, tight and animated in projection and creating a
gutsy, full-blooded sound.
Passion brewed in subsequent Andante and Minuetto-Allegretto
movements, eventually reaching boiling point in the Andante-Molto
Allegro finale. Here the opening eerie tremolando strings were used to
full dramatic effect building up tension before the jubilant flowering
of the conclusive Allegro melody.

AN ANCHOR believed to have belonged to the Second World War battleship
HMS Hood has been found off Bute. Mr Ivan Cowie, skipper of the Level
Morr, snagged his nets on it when he was half a mile off Craigmore
Point, on the east coast of the island.
Mr Cowie brought the anchor partly to the surface but had to let go
because of its size and weight. Two local boats then dragged the huge
four-five ton anchor into 15ft of water in Rothesay Bay.
Local diver Ian Woolcott, who went down to inspect the anchor, said it
measured 16ft by 14ft and was still in excellent condition.
Mr Cowie previously has snagged two nets in the area on what he
thought was the remains of a wreck.
HMS Hood, the then flagship of the British Navy, was sunk, with the
loss of 1419 lives, by a single shot from Germany's battleship Bismarck
in a battle off the north of Scotland in 1941.
She had been anchored in Rothesay Bay when she had to ''slip'' her two
giant anchors to set off in pursuit of the Bismarck and the Prinz Eugen
in the Baltic.
One of her anchors was located by former fishing skipper Mr Jim
Campbell, more than 10 years ago, in the same area off Bute. It was
removed by the Admiralty but the second anchor has never been found.
Mr and Mrs Cowie, who now own a hotel in Rothesay, are hoping to have
the anchor formally identified.
Mrs Cowie said: ''We only hope that we can persuade the Admiralty to
let it stay here on Bute. It would do the island so much good to have it
here for visitors to see rather than stuck in some museum.

Edinburgh Festival Theatre is teetering on the brink of bankruptcy.Rob
Robertson reports on the rescue attempts
IT was to be one of the jewels in the crown of the new Scottish
cultural scene -- a glass palace that would stage the best shows from
across the world.
Built from the shell of a building used for bingo, the Edinburgh
Festival Theatre, which opened 10 months ago, is the latest addition to
arts venues in the capital.
It was a project Edinburgh had talked about for 50 years but had
failed to deliver. When it finally pulled its act together, it was
claimed as Europe's best theatre.
Funded by the private and public sector and run with no public
subsidy, it was hailed as an example of what could be achieved if people
worked together.
But The Herald can today reveal details of how close the #20m theatre
came to bankruptcy, fall-outs over funding, over-budget problems in its
building and a controversial option drawn up to save it.
That option, outlined in a private letter from the chairman of the
theatre trust, Lord Younger of Prestwick, to the district council
created shockwaves because it suggested allowing the trust which runs
the theatre -- opened with about #10m of public money -- to go into
liquidation. The theatre would then fall under control of the district
council, which could sell it on to a private theatre operator.
Such a move would have created political uproar. Indeed, Lord Younger
described the option as one which would ''cause pain and embarrassment
for the city of Edinburgh''.
The threat of such a scenario was one of the main reasons Edinburgh
District Council decided last Thursday to put #1m into a rescue package
designed to reduce the theatre's #3.1m deficit.
One council source said: ''The letter from George Younger pushed the
district council into action. Many people believe it was a serious,
well-thought-out solution put forward by Lord Younger. Others see it as
a wonderful piece of gamesmanship by a shrewd politician designed to
shake people up. Whatever was in his mind, it certainly worked.''
Despite council suggestions that the theatre is financially safe, the
rows over what went wrong and concerns about its future aren't finished.
There are still dissenters within the district council Labour group
ranks who voted against giving a #1m grant to the theatre. Part of their
fear is that the council may have to sell off a piece of land behind the
theatre to a private developer for #500,000 to help balance their books.
That land, they believe, would be better left under public ownership if
the theatre ever needs to extend.
The district council's #1m contribution will only go ahead if Lothian
Regional Council or Lothian Enterprise Limited put in a similar sum.
It is believed some Lothian Regional Council members are against
bailing out the theatre, and council leader Eric Milligan will have to
convince them otherwise.
Business groups in the Lothians have praised local enterprise company
LEL for its work and believe it's unfair to ask it to contribute more
than it already has.
So far it has put #4.3m into the project, double its original
commitment, and helped raise #4.5m from the private sector.
Top business names such as Colin Liddell of ScottishPower, George
Borthwick, managing director of Ethicon Limited, and Eric Davidson of
design company, Tayburn, have all helped out. Privately, however,
fundraisers admit concern.
One said: ''The big sponsors have been fine but smaller businesses
have been saying what's the point in contributing to a theatre that
could go bust.''
A thorough look at the theatre's debts of #3.1m shows that about #2.1m
was incurred during building. One theatre source said: ''Things proved
more expensive than we thought. We had to bring in specialised building
equipment from abroad just after Norman Lamont had devalued the pound.''
Problems faced included an underground well found in the foundations
and seeping oil.
Four of the companies involved, including one of the main players,
Lilley's, went into receivership. Theatre equipment had to be upgraded
and costs rocketed for things such as electrical work.
Also included in the debts at a cost of #991,000 is cash for a cooling
system and mechanised orchestra pit. Those within the Edinburgh
theatrical world are astonished that plans for a world-class theatre did
not budget for a mechanised orchestra pit. A theatre source said: ''We
wanted this included in the first place but they thought they could get
by with a make-shift operation.''
There has also been criticism of the district council. Leading
businessmen believed the council, which owns the site and the theatre,
could give the freehold of the site to the theatre trust which would
have allowed it to borrow against its assets. It would not cost the
district, or any of the other partners, a penny and would have ended its
financial problems immediately.
Despite the difficulties, defenders of the project believe it has to
be seen in context. One leading Edinburgh business source said: ''In
view of the time constraints and the complexity of the project, working
with a listed building, and with a relatively small over-run in costs it
is extraordinary. If we had been building the facility from scratch it
would have cost up to #60m. We believe we have been given a quality
facility at a bargain-basement price.''
Lord Younger made it clear that once the capital funding crisis is
over the theatre will go from strength to strength.
Figures for the theatre's first 41 weeks show 300,000 seats were sold
for 319 performances, the value of the tickets bought being #3,846,431.
Everything from the Krankies to grand opera has been staged.
Lord Younger added: ''Our original business plan suggested it should
be possible to break even financially by the third year of trading. We
recognised this would be a considerable challenge.
''In fact, the theatre broke even at the end of its first 29 weeks of
full trading. Although seasonal patterns of activity mean that the trust
expects to have incurred a modest deficit of #11,000 to the end of March
compared with a budgeted first-year loss of #250,000 in our business
plan. The directors are very pleased so far.''
District council leader Lesley Hinds said the importance of the
Festival Theatre was recognised by all groups. ''It would be plain daft
to let it go bust.''

Norman Stone argues that Conservatives should see the merits of
devolution instead of dismissing it as an extravagance and the thin end
of a wedge which will split the United Kingdom.
A POLISH count said to a German ambassador in 1918: ''If Poland could
be free and independent I'd give half my worldly goods. With the other
half, I'd emigrate.'' It is the best line on nationalism -- at least for
those of us who are rather schizoid on the subject.
The Scots have been very good internationalists, probably the best
that modern Europe has produced. It is not a provincial culture, and it
is not given, most of the time, to self-pity. So an English politician,
and especially a Conservative, is bound to be rather perlexed by the
demand for ''devolution''.
To see things from John Major's viewpoint -- and not his alone, by a
very long way -- ''devolution'' is an unnecessary bore. It is very, very
complicated. All of the clauses and sub-clauses would take up an
inordinate amount of parliamentary time. And devolution could all too
easily be the thin end of the wedge. Wrangles over tedious details
between Westminster and an Edinburgh assembly could just mean that the
demand for independence emerges without any need or enthusiasm.
And all for what? No-one's life would be any the better, except maybe
for the sort of small-town politico puffing him, or herself, up at the
tables of the great in Brussels. So, from the viewpoint of John Major,
you can see the objections to ''devolution''. However, I do not think
that he is right.
It is very curious, but the British managed to get out of their vast
imperial problem quite well, but they read the facts of their own
country incorrectly. This was especially true of Ireland, but it is true
of local government in general.
All large and well-off countries need to have some kind of
regionalism, provided that regions are significantly different. However,
the Westminster Government set itself, though not its colonies, rigidly
on a centralising pattern, and it still does. The likely arrival of an
Ulster assembly make shake this.
The centralisation at Westminster has, or had, some very good
arguments. It was remarkably efficient. Great Britain, with a population
not 10 million, became a world power in the eighteenth century. The
centralisation then guaranteed cheap government as well: there was
little duplication.
Then again, there was always the argument that if you broke the
country up, the fragments would start quarrels likely to be far more
murderous than those already existing. This was true of Ireland, but it
could be true of North and South Wales, or the Scottish east and west
coasts. Why subject the prudent and well-preserved Edinburgh of the
sixties to the ways of the Glasgow council of that same decade, with its
idiotic rates and its hideous architecture?
British parliaments set their face against Irish Home Rule in the
1880s, and did not introduce Scottish Home Rule in the 1920s, although,
following Irish semi-independence, that had been promised. But they also
failed to look into local government at the same time. It is this
country's most obvious weakness: the architecture, public and private,
of England's cities, the chaos on their roads, the sheer awfulness of
the schools (I know quite a number of Englishmen who have gone north
just to avoid them) are a disgrace. Even now, the Conservatives are in a
muddle about local government.
The heart of the problem is that Westminster is trying to do too much.
In the old days, given the state of communications, that kind of
centralisation made sense. It protected defenceless locals from the Bad
Barons who made the running everywhere else in Europe, and it imposed
enlightened standards. Now it heaps endless problems on the desks of
central government, rewards the kind of committee-drones who produce
wrong answers in contorted language, and fails to note the truly
important differences.
Scotland and England are different countries. The Scots, being
historically much poorer, had to do things by a collective effort that,
in richer England, could be done locally and privately. Edinburgh's New
Town, for example, was the act of an almost totalitarian state: London
developed as a disparate collection of New Towns, built up by dukes.
There is a much healthier attitude towards public service in Scotland:
it is more competent and self-confident than in the South. The people
are less resentful of high taxation if they can see something for it,
and they have voted Labour in greater and greater numbers as a result.
Even now, where an Englishman's response is wider home-ownership,
there is a widespread, common-sense view in Scotland that renting
property is easier, keeps you mobile, and lets you invest your money in
something else. One obvious outcome of this is that Glasgow, just about
alone among the nineteenth-century industrial cities of this country,
has recovered, whereas the Sheffields and Newcastles are still
struggling.
Of course, extending ''regionalisation'' for its own sake in England
is nonsense, or mainly so. But Scotland's is a quite different case. To
the Conservatives, I would put another argument. Yes, de-centralisation
can be expensive -- and if you get it wrong, as the Spaniards and
Belgians seem to have done, you just get a vast public deficit and high
unemployment -- but you also get something for it.
Germany seems to me to be a model. The federal system there is
expensive, but Germans have something to show for it. The Ruhr area, for
example, might just have degenerated into a seventies North of England,
but heads were deployed, and the Ruhr, today, has received hi-tech
formula that we failed, mainly, to apply.
But we have local government, beginning with the universally admitted
mess of London, as an endless ball-and-chain. It is a problem that
successive governments have addressed, usually leaving messes all
around. They have failed, mainly because they have not seen the problem
in the round.
Therefore, provided we can be sure to avoid the kind of silliness that
so often accompanies small-town nationalism, I do not believe that a
Conservative Government should be quite so dismissive of Scottish
devolution as it is.

SCOTLAND'S chattering classes can prepare themselves for an extended
use of their tongues if John Major confirms the rumour that Michael
Forsyth, banished from the Scottish Office three years ago, will make a
startling comeback as Secretary of State for Scotland.
The 40-year-old Stirling MP was never off the discussion list when the
opinion formers of Scotland endlessly debated in the early 90s why
Thatcherism went against the grain in Scotland.
Forsyth became the hate figure who managed the feat of allowing
left-wing union activists in Scotland and the grandees of the Scottish
Conservative Party to agree on at least one thing -- that Michael
Forsyth had to go.
His rise in politics had been impressive. A student activist at St
Andrews University, he became chairman of the now-disgraced Federation
of Conservative Students, then a councillor in Westminster before taking
the Stirling seat in 1983 while only 29.
Only four years later he was a junior minister in the Scottish Office,
known, and in some quarters warily watched, as someone who had become a
personal favourite of the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, herself.
Not, as is often the case, because he was some young acolyte who made
up for a lack of talent by slavishly currying favour with the boss. No,
Michael Forsyth believed with every bone in his body that Margaret
Thatcher's free-market libertarianism was exactly the right way to take
the country forward.
Like her, he was a conviction politician. He worked out in his own
mind what was right, and then tried to put the policies into practice,
without thinking about the toes he would have to tread on to do so.
And in the parochial world of Scottish politics, he trod on more toes
than a chiropodist would gingerly handle in a year.
At workers' demonstrations, he was constantly denounced because of his
robust defence of disliked policies such as the poll tax, school boards,
hospital trusts, primary school testing, and GP contracts. What made the
protestors even angrier was the arrogant way he argued his case.
Unlike many politicians, he could not hide the fact that he did not
suffer whom he regarded as fools lightly. And unlike almost all
polticians, it did not even appear to bother him that public opinion of
him appeared so low.
To Margaret Thatcher though, he could do no wrong, and she took the
step which could have proven disastrous to his political future. Despite
reservations from well-placed party figures in Scotland, she made him
chairman of the Scottish Conservative Party in 1989, and there followed
two years of serious in-fighting and back-biting which threatened to
split the party asunder.
The more patrician, old-style Tories did not like him. Too abrasive by
half, they would say. Unable to unite the party, they would add.
Although the suspicion was always there that what they really meant was
that as the son of a Montrose garage mechanic who went to the local high
school rather than one of the Edinburgh private schools, he simply was
not one of them.
He gave scant regard to their views, setting about putting like-minded
right-wing thinkers into key posts within the party's administrative
hierarchy. The divisions deepened. Fear suffused Central Office
corridors as his shake-up appeared to threaten those who did not
identify themselves as his supporters.
The monied business-class began to make murmurings that he was not the
right man for the job, and Margaret Thatcher was convinced, with a great
deal of reluctance, that Forsyth had to go as Scottish chairman.
But protective mothers do not sacrifice their favoured children so
easily. Thatcher's revenge was to make Forsyth Minister of State at the
Scottish Office, giving him more power to try to force through a
right-wing stance on a Scottish party which was beginning to exasperate
her with its demands for special favours for Scotland while delivering
her an indifferent number of seats.
Then came John Major as Prime Minister who moved Michael Forsyth to be
Minister of State at the Department of Employment, and then at the Home
Office. Suddenly the chattering classes in Scotland had a lot less to
talk about. Irrespective of the talent of his successors at the Scottish
Office, they could not match his ability at stirring controversy.
Many people in Scottish politics thought that was the end of Michael
Forsyth. But of course that was too insular a view. Freed from the small
world of Scottish politics, Forsyth could allow his ability to surface
without the constant attention of the Scottish media. Within a few
months The Spectator magazine had named him as the politician to watch
in the future.
He could even joke about it, recounting that he was on his way to a
family holiday by car when the Prime Minister phoned him on the mobile
to offer him the job in the Employment Department.
After showing due deference to the PM, he hung up, only to be met with
a chorus of ''crawler'' from his children in the back seat.
Freed from trying to win over a watchful and distrustful party in
Scotland, Forsyth buckled down to his new job, and impressed many with
his grasp of the brief and his ability to handle civil servants.
Employment Minister David Hunt expressed the view to a Scottish MP that
Forsyth was the finest Minister of State that had worked for him.
Other MPs in England wondered why someone with such obvious talent was
not in the Cabinet at a time when talent was not exactly swilling around
in the Cabinet by the bucketful.
But will his possible return to Scotland not simply stir up the old
divisions between left and right? Fellow Scots Tory MP Bill Walker
thinks not. As he puts it: ''The point has long since past in the party
in Scotland when we can talk of left-wing this, or right-wing that. We
are at the stage where we have to talk about the survival of the party,
and that needs talent and ability, which Michael Forsyth has.
''He has substantial intellect, a very good brain, and the courage and
determination to do what's right for Scotland.''
What he will not do, if given the job, is appease the wetter strand of
the party, by courting some form of devolution. ''We are a unionist
party, and we will not countenance any change which will result in the
break-up of the Union,'' he once stated.
But what he would bring to the job after the refreshing change of a
few years out of the intense media spotlight in Scotland, is a bit more
maturity, and a less-hectoring style.
He may even surprise the chattering classes by showing that he is at
least willing to listen to other points of view rather than
steamrollering over all dissent as he did in the past. And that really
would set the tongues wagging.
Employment Minister David Hunt expressed the view that Forsyth was the
finest Minister of State that had worked for him

A LEADING Scottish obstetrician yesterday rejected claims that doctors
were giving women unnecessary injections of heroin during childbirth and
said the drug was widely regarded as the most effective anaesthetic for
pregnant women.
Dr Burnett Lunan, of Glasgow Royal maternity hospital -- the city's
biggest maternity unit with 5000 deliveries per year, said:
''Paediatricians, anaesthetists, and midwifery staff in the hospital
have all been involved in evaluating the use of heroin with pregnant
women and we believe nothing is as effective as the opiate analgesics
for pain relief.''
Reports based on a study to be presented to the Scottish Office in
August claimed that doctors were administering diamorphine, the clinical
name for heroin, despite evidence that it affects the breathing of
new-born babies and increases the risk of drug addiction in later life.
It was also claimed that women are often given heroin without being
informed.
Dr Arthur Davis, a consultant anaesthetist at Glasgow's Southern
General Hospital, who compiled the report on pain relief in labour, said
the most effective and safest painkiller during childbirth was the
epidural local anaesthetic, adding that it was ''outstandingly better in
preventing harm to children but resources make its use limited''.
Dr Davis conceded there was no firm evidence that babies could become
addicted to heroin after their mothers were given the injections but
reports stated that a Swedish research team had linked the administering
of heroin during childbirth to drug addiction in later life.
Dr Lunan, who described the reports as ''scaremongering'', said
pregnant women were fully informed about the choice of analgesia
available to them and about the advantages and disadvantages of
different options.
He said: ''Heroin will give good pain relief without abolishing it
completely so that the patient will continue to be aware of the
contractions and can therefore co-operate, when the time comes, to push
the baby out.
''She can participate in the delivery whereas, with the epidural, you
are more likely to get total pain relief.
''Some patients complain that they feel that this is detaching them
from the experience and they don't have the awareness of the
contractions and so can't co-operate so readily with the delivery.''
Dr Lunan added that, while the epidural does not affect the baby
because it is like a local anaesthetic, heroin has a potential sedative
effect.
''But, if the baby is sleeping when it is born then we can give a
simple injection which will counter the effects of the heroin.''
He said medical staff preferred not to administer heroin within three
hours of delivery, adding that ''if we have timed the injections well
enough then the effect of it has worn off by the time the baby is born
and there is no additional problem.''

LORD GOODMAN, the lawyer and political fixer who worked for both
Labour and Conservative governments, has died after a long illness.
The legal and political worlds united at the weekend in praise of his
lengthy career after the news that he had died, aged 81, at a nursing
home in Highgate, north London, on Friday night.
A former chairman of the Arts Council, Lord Goodman received his
peerage while Mr Harold Wilson was Prime Minister, but sat on the
crossbenches.
Sir Edward Heath, during whose premiership he became a Companion of
Honour, was among a host of people who paid tributes to him and
described him as a remarkable man who played ''an extremely prominent
part in public life, although sometimes behind the scenes, for many
years''.
Former Labour Prime Minister Lord Callaghan said he was a great
lawyer, adding: ''His advice was valued because it always seemed
independent and therefore became acceptable to both sides when there was
a dispute.''
A negotiator and problem solver in high places, Lord Goodman claimed
that ''only foolish people'' thought he had real power but it was always
acknowledged that he was more than a conciliator and had real influence
among the powerful.
He remained active in his role as adviser to the establishment until
late in life. In 1992, he was consulted by the Prince of Wales following
his marriage break-up.
He was involved in mediation between the royal couple, telling the
Prince that divorce was no barrier to him becoming King -- although a
second marriage would make it impossible.
A year later, he intervened in the row over magazine accusations about
Mr John Major's relationship with Downing Street cook Clare Latimer,
warning the Prime Minister of the problems of bringing a double libel
action. The dispute was settled out of court.
The son of an export dealer and shipper who came from South Africa,
Arnold Abraham Goodman was born in London in 1913. He achieved a double
first in law at Cambridge, and joined a firm of solicitors specialising
in literary libels.
Returning to law after the Second World War, he set up his own law
firm in 1954 and later acted on behalf of trade unions, newspapers,
editors, and TV companies -- and was probably the only solicitor in
history to have advised the leaders of Conservative, Labour, and Liberal
parties.
A teetotaller and non-smoker, Lord Goodman was a lifelong bachelor.

IN an ironic twist of fate, a yacht crew whose defective radio
frustrated coastguards by blocking the emergency radio channel were
themselves rescued by a lifeboat.
The incident, which has led coastguards to a call for stricter checks
on marine radio equipment, took place over the weekend.
A crew of seven -- led by skipper Graham Thoms, 44, of Partick,
Glasgow -- hired the 30ft bermudian sloop, Corvi, from the Largs charter
company Sun Sail on Wednesday.
They headed down the Ayrshire coast towards Campbeltown. The radio was
checked but nevertheless appears to have developed problems on Friday.
Due to what is believed to have been a wiring fault, the VHF channel
starting opening intermittently.
When open, a radio is able to transmit, but not receive, messages and
distress calls. An open radio transmitter can also create a hazard for
nearby vessels because strong signals block out messages from other
boats.
Searchers knew the area the yacht was in but could not pin down its
position further -- until the boat ran aground at Brigurd Spit, near
Hunterston, on its way back to Largs.
A security guard at the power station noticed the stricken yacht and
alerted the same coastguards who had been searching for the vessel.
A lifeboat rescued the crew, who were from the Glasgow and Edinburgh
areas. It was not a serious incident and no-one was injured.
Mr Roger Clarke, district staff officer at the Clyde Marine Rescue
Co-ordination Centre, said: ''It was unfortunate and ironic for the
Corvi that the problem ended up with her rather embarrassingly going
ashore.
''There was no malice involved in this but it is against the law to
have defective equipment.
Mr Thoms said he was qualified to use VHF equipment and had been
sailing for 25 years. He said there was no way the crew could have known
the radio was faulty because they could hear it intermittently receiving
messages.
''I am very careful about the use of VHF and extremely annoyed it
turned out to be our machine that was causing problems.''
No-one from Sun Sail was available for comment yesterday.

PLANS to withdraw the support received by handicapped and dyslexic
youngsters during some Standard Grade examinations were condemned by
delegates at the Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association conference in
Aviemore at the weekend.
The Scottish Examination Board has decided that, from next year, the
readers and scribes who support candidates with physical or visual
impairments or who are dyslexic will be withdrawn.
Teacher, Mrs Lee McCombie, said the board had taken the decision
because of concerns that employers and other users of Standard Grade
certificates assume those who held them could decipher or write texts
when, in fact, these tasks had been done by a reader or scribe.
However, Mrs McCombie said the certificates made it clear that the
students had been given support in courses such as English and foreign
languages, where communication skills were an assessable part of their
courses.
She said removing such support would put another barrier in the way of
handicapped youngsters. It would be akin to asking an exam candidate to
sit a paper in a language of which they had only sketchy knowledge, or
read questions in a dimly-lit room.
Mrs McCombie's condemnation of the plans was supported by fellow
teacher, Mrs Kaye Mackaskill, who said she had a profoundly physically
handicapped nephew due to sit his Standard Grade exams next year.
Life was stacked against him, she said, and added: ''He cannot write
or read himself. He is a bright, intelligent child. Life is incredibly
difficult for him.
''He has been trained with scribes to do English and modern languages
exams and without that support he will not be able to do them.''
She said she was speaking from the heart when she called on delegates
at the conference to support a motion condemning the proposals and
calling for urgent talks with the board. The conference agreed to her
proposals.

THE DIRECTOR of the National Galleries of Scotland, Mr Timothy
Clifford, was keeping a low profile yesterday after being tipped as a
front runner to become director of London's Victoria and Albert Museum.
As Sunday newspapers named him among contenders for the #70,000-a-year
post, Mr Clifford declined to be drawn on what he thought of his
prospects.
''I don't want to discuss the matter. I don't want to be
interviewed,'' he said on the telephone from his home at Tyninghame,
East Lothian. He said he was spending ''a nice quiet day'' and added:
''I'm a little shrinking violet.''
One report said Mr Clifford was one of two front-runners, the other
being Mr Alan Borg, director of the Imperial War Museum.
Mr Timothy Stevens, assistant director of the V&amp;A, was placed third
and Mr Edmund Capon, director of the New South Wales Gallery in
Australia, fourth.
Mr Julian Spalding, the director of Glasgow Museums and Art Galleries,
was reported by Scotland on Sunday as having been dropped from the short
list. Mr Spalding told The Herald that he had never applied for the
post.
The trustees of the Victoria and Albert, whose chairman is Lord
Armstrong, are to announce on Thursday who will succeed Ms Elizabeth
Esteve-Coll as its director.
Mr Clifford has been director of the National Galleries of Scotland
since 1984. He was assistant keeper of the department of ceramics at the
V&amp;A from 1972-76 and assistant keeper of the department of prints and
drawings at the British Museum from 1976-78.
Mr Clifford got into bother last year when he alleged that Mr John
Paul Getty II had donated #1m to help save Canova's Three Graces from
being exported to the Getty Museum in California because he had a grudge
against his late father. He had to make a public apology.

ALLEGATIONS against the procurement manager of Edinburgh Royal
Infirmary's NHS Trust are being considered by its senior managers.
It was claimed in a Sunday newspaper yesterday that Mr Alistair
Douglas had been planning a supplies scheme of his own while he carried
out his job of purchasing equipment for seven hospitals in Edinburgh.
Mr Douglas, 42, was alleged to be in the process of setting up two
private companies to supply health-care products.
A trust spokeswoman said Mr Douglas had been seen by managers about
the allegations. The trust had no evidence of any misconduct.
The spokeswoman said, however, that that situation was being kept
under review and it was likely there would be further discussions.
Mr Jim Devine, senior regional officer with Unison, called for Mr
Douglas to be suspended pending a full investigation.
Mr Douglas was not available yesterday.

THE privatisation of Scotland's railways faces a fresh setback this
week, after a decision by the Government's franchising director to
exclude rail services in Strathclyde from proposals for the ScotRail
network.
Mr Roger Salmon, appointed by the Government to oversee privatisation,
has dropped Strathclyde -- the largest commuter network outside London
-- from ScotRail's minimum Passenger Service Requirement. His decision
follows his refusal to compromise in the face of tough demands from
Strathclyde Regional Council.
The region has accused Mr Salmon and the Government of ignoring
promises made by Ministers which gave the region full control over rail
services under privatisation.
The Passenger Service Requirement (PSR), to be published by Mr Salmon
this week, sets the minimum level of service a private operator must
provide. These documents are vital to the success of the Government's
sell-off plans.
Labour said the decision to withhold Strathclyde from the PSR would
prove to be ''the final nail in the coffin'' for privatisation in
Scotland, while others warned that it amounted to setting up Strathclyde
as a separate franchise.
The region is demanding that promises made in 1993 by the then
Transport Minister, Mr Roger Freeman, be upheld. He guaranteed
Strathclyde a say in the levels of service and fares under
privatisation.
Mr Salmon believes a flexibility should be enshrined in the PSRs,
allowing the operator to exercise commercial judgment -- and maximise
profits -- by varying services and fares. Opponents claim any service
not specified in the PSR risks being cut.
Sources have told The Herald that Mr Salmon will proceed with the
publication of the ScotRail PSR, minus Strathclyde. Meanwhile, he will
continue to attempt to negotiate a solution with the region.
However, Mr Charles Gordon, chairman of Strathclyde's transport
committee, said: ''We are insisting on total control over the timetable
and absolute control over the fares.
''I stress that our position is non-negotiable. We are not going to
commit millions of pounds of council tax payer's money when we don't
have control over timetable and fares and instead are only being used as
a source of subsidy.''
He added: ''As it stands at the moment, in legal terms, Strathclyde is
a franchise within a franchise.'' The region is considering legal action
to ensure its rights are upheld.
Strathclyde pays more than #30m a year to ScotRail to run its services
and receives a further #80m a year in Government subsidy to cover the
additional costs imposed by railway reorganisation.
Labour's transport spokesman, Mr Henry McLeish, said: ''Strathclyde's
action will completely scupper the ScotRail PSR. It's another nail in
the coffin for privatisation in Scotland.''
The ScotRail PSR will be published in conjunction with those of three
other franchises that are first in line for privatisation. The PSRs for
another three franchises were published earlier this year and Mr Salmon
is expected to announce that they are ready to be put out to tender.
Railway sources suggest that the PSR details for the rest of ScotRail
will not introduce any controversial cuts in services in rural areas,
largely because services on highly subsidised lines are already at
minimal levels.
Yesterday, Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney said the PSR provided
guarantees of service that did not exist before privatisation. He told
BBC TV's On the Record: ''For the first time ever, you are going to have
guarantees of levels of service on lines which are commercially
non-viable.''
A ScotRail spokesman said: ''The PSR provides an opportunity to allay
fears that have been expressed to us about the future of rural routes.
I'm confident that these fears will be completely allayed when we see
the PSR.
''These will give financial stability and guarantee the routes.
ScotRail will have scope to develop services. We are determined to grow
the business.''
However, BR insiders concede that in the long term, by exposing the
level of subsidy required to run ScotRail, the network will be
vulnerable to political demands for cuts.

<HEADLINE>Inspectors file list of shame on Bayble as teachers warn other schools are at risk of falling down. Island school condemned as dangerous</HEADLINE>

SHOCKED inspectors found pupils in a draughty, rotten island school
using stinking toilets in full view of classmates.
In a damning report published today, they will brand defects at Bayble
School in Point, Lewis, as ''dangerous'' and ''primitive''.
Councillors in the Western Isles last night told of their sadness that
many schools in the islands were in poorer condition than 50 years ago,
and growing worse.
Western Isles council chiefs responded by blaming the Scottish Office
for cutting back on schools repairs cash.
Director of education Neil Galbraith said: ''Bayble is one of two
schools that have already been guaranteed #100,000 a year for repairs.
''The inspectors' report was compiled last year. Some of the defects
they found in the primary department have already been put right.
''Their report, and a further report from myself, will go before the
education committee in a couple of weeks' time.''
The inspectors, from the Scottish Office, compiled what everyone
agrees is a list of shame.
It highlights lethal electrical sockets, poor heating, dismal
classroom lighting, rotten windows, sodden walls, broken stair treads,
and ''noxious'' toilet smells wafting through classrooms.
Almost 160 pupils attend the crumbling 118-year-old primary and junior
secondary school. Some of its walls are shored up and polythene sheets
are the hopeless defences against the islands' notorious weather.
Foul-smelling open drains were dangerously close to the canteen
serving area, said the inspectors, but that area has now been
refurbished.
Fungal growths, which one former teacher yesterday said would ''not be
out of place in a science fiction thriller'', keep appearing out of
sodden walls.
One paragraph in the report reads: ''The fabric of the hutted
accommodation where P1 and P2 were located was neither wind nor
watertight, and the teaching area was subject to noxious fumes from the
adjacent unscreened toilets.''
The inspectors urged these worst health and safety aspects ''should be
addressed with urgency''.
They also said pupils' education was handicapped by a shortage of
standard materials. Inspectors found too few reference books, musical
instruments, and other apparatus.
Even pupils' religious and moral education was at risk because of
shortage of the appropriate books. Pupils' knowledge of other world
religions apart from Christianity was graded ''poor''.
Head teacher George Moody said yesterday he was unable to discuss the
inspectors' findings with the media.
It is understood, however, that he and the other four teaching staff
at Bayble School are pleased that their pleas for help have been backed
by the inspectors.
A Scottish Office spokesman commented: ''The Western Isles Islands
Council has substantial resources for school building and maintenance
work.''
Mr Galbraith responded: ''It depends what is meant by 'substantial'.
We have just under #1m available for school repairs but we need #6m to
catch up properly.''
He refused to accept that Bayble school had become a rotten slum.
''But this report will make our case to the Scottish Office for added
resources very much stronger,'' he said.
''The years of neglect because of lack of money are coming to a head.
That is the view of their own inspectors.''
Point councillors Callum Ian Macmillan and Iain Macsween, both Labour,
said they were sad that 15 years of Tory penny-pinching had resulted in
island schools rotting to the extent they were worse than 50 years ago.
They said: ''We will campaign to impress on the Government the sorry
state of our schools.
''We will also campaign to bring forward plans for a new community
school to replace the current three in Point.''
Bayble school board chairwoman Gillian Corden said parents were very
unhappy about the state of the school. ''This is all down to years of
neglect,'' she said.
* Angry parents last week forced island councillors to place another
school, at Laxdale near Stornoway, at the top of the priority repair
list. After a long campaign, Back school is now having #100,000-worth of
repairs each year.

<HEADLINE>Keep talking, Fraser urges nurses    Trusts have the means to meet full 3% guideline on pay rise, says Health Minister</HEADLINE>

SCOTTISH Health Minister Lord Fraser of Carmyllie last night
intervened in the nursing pay dispute, and urged nurses to negotiate
with trusts.
In an interview with The Herald, he insisted that all trusts had the
funds to pay the full 3% rise and warned of the dangers of targeting
industrial action against NHS administration.
Lord Fraser said he did not accept that Glasgow's Victoria Infirmary,
which is offering the basic national award of 1% -- the lowest in the
country -- had insufficient funds. He said this could be a bargaining
ploy by the trust managers who have told nurses they simply did not have
the money.
''Our increases are such that they should be able to meet the 3%, if
that is what they want to do'', the Minister claimed.
The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) is poised to break a 79-year
principle by removing the no-strike clause 12 from its constitution.
This is likely to lead to a ballot of its 300,000 members and action in
the summer aimed at causing administrative chaos for NHS trusts and
managers.
Much of the anger at the RCN congress in Harrogate has been fuelled by
Government claims that most trusts were offering 3% without strings,
which the college says is simply untrue.
Lord Fraser insisted it was up to trusts alone, and not the
Government, to negotiate pay.
''I am not pulling any strings behind the scenes nor setting out a
dictatorial line. I am not advising them to settle. That would be to
contradict the local pay bargaining approach,'' he said.
''What I am saying to the trusts is that if the figure they wish to
settle on is 3%, no-one is going to be called in front of me and be
carpeted.
''I would also require some persuasion that you can take
'administrative' action and that would not harm patients or would not
disrupt services in the long term to the disadvantage of patients.''
In a hint that the Government's line might soften in the future, he
urged unions to negotiate locally. ''If, having negotiated with every
trust, it proves to be completely unsatisfactory, that might be a
different story,'' he added.
However, Ms June Andrews, Scottish Secretary of the Royal College of
Nursing, described the Minister's intervention as ''unhelpful.''
She declared: ''This is going to do nothing to stem the rising mood of
anger and determination among nurses. There is no way we would ever harm
patients. We cannot do it and we would not do it. Nurses are the best
judges of patient care, not Government Ministers, and the public knows
that.''
Ms Andrews said only nine out of 47 Scottish trusts had made 3% offers
ostensibly without strings. She described the Victoria Infirmary's 1%
offer as ''absolutely outrageous.''
''We have sympathy with some trust managers, but it is crazy to cut
back nurses wages as a way of making the books balance. The result will
be demoralised nurses and nurses who leave for jobs elsewhere,'' she
added.
Mrs Patricia Dawson, director of the Scottish Association of Local
Health Councils, said different settlements would have a divisive effect
on nursing staff within the same area.
''We do not want to see patients harmed but we do want proper rates of
pay for nurses and other health workers.
''Different pay rates could lead to recruitment problems in some of
the specialist nursing areas in Scotland where there are already
shortages of experienced staff,'' she said.

THE Scottish National Party took heart yesterday from a second opinion
poll which showed it comfortably ahead in the Perth and Kinross
by-election.
However the Nationalists, while pleased to have a seemingly
''commanding lead'' in the contest so far, declared that there was no
place for complacency in their campaign and that it would be fought down
to the wire with great intensity.
Labour was also buoyed by the results of the latest opinion poll for
GMTV's The Sunday Programme which showed it running a clear second to
the SNP with the Conservative Party, the sitting tenant, in third place.
The principal parties, with the exception of Labour, did urge some
caution over the latest figures, based on a phone poll of 500 voters,
which puts the SNP at 41.4%; Labour at 29.8%; Conservatives at 20.1% and
Liberal Democrats at 6.6%. About 33% of those polled were unsure about
how they would vote or would not confirm their voting intentions.
A telephone poll conducted for the Daily Record last week showed the
SNP had extended its lead to represent more than 50% of the electorate.
After extracting 33% of ''don't knows'', the poll showed the SNP with
52%; Labour 22%; Conservatives 19%; and the Liberal Democrats 6%.
Commenting on the latest poll, Mr Michael Russell, the SNP's chief
executive, said: ''We are very happy with our position. Polls are
volatile but one thing that they all agree on is that the SNP has a
commanding lead.
Labour candidate Mr Douglas Alexander said the latest poll clearly
demonstrated the Tories could not win.
He added: ''The GMTV poll confirms what we have been finding on the
streets of Perth and Kinross. The voters are demanding that the
Government listens to their concerns. They know that the best way to
make that happen is to give them a real shock by returning a Labour
MP.''
A spokesman for the Conservatives described the poll as
''statistically insignificant'' and declared that Tory candidate Mr John
Godfrey was ''fighting to win the seat'', vacated by the death of Sir
Nicholas Fairbairn, and could still triumph.
He said: ''In a large, diverse constituency like Perth and Kinross it
is impossible to draw conclusions from any opinion poll.''
Liberal Democrat chief whip Mr Archy Kirkwood said: ''Friday's Daily
Record poll was Mickey Mouse and this one is Donald Duck. Telephone
polls are notoriously unreliable and this one is more so than usual.''
Meanwhile, the group behind the rogue Scottish Conservatory and
Unionist candidate who lodged nomination papers for the by-election last
week has threatened to field candidates against every Conservative MP in
Scotland.
Mr Ian Thomson, the group's election agent for Perth and Kinross, said
yesterday: ''The Tories were happy to benefit when a 'Literal Democrat'
stood in a Euro contest in the south of England and took 6000 votes
allowing the Conservative candidate to scrape home. But now they are
whingeing in Perth and Kinross. They cannot have it both ways.''
Mr Thomson, a Perth businessman, argued that the Government had had
plenty of time to change the electoral law to ban ''look-a-like
parties''.

AN ABERDEEN school for teenagers with social, emotional, and
behavioural difficulties has been given time to resolve a catalogue of
serious failings highlighted in a report by HM Inspectors of Schools.
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang has decided not to take the extremely rare
step of issuing a Notice of Complaint against Oakbank School, which
would compel changes within a given period. The situation will be
re-assessed after an inspection next year.
Oakbank School came under scrutiny in 1993 when a number of
allegations about the way it was run were made by former staff. As the
registration body, Grampian Regional Council asked a sub-committee of
its social work committee to investigate.
The report and the response of the independent school's board of
governors was sent to Mr Lang and he in turn asked HM Inspectors of
Schools to carry out an investigation, which they did from October 1994
until January this year.
Their report is published today. Although they identify some positive
features, they indicated that the school was failing to meet the needs
of the pupils, whose average age is 14, in several important regards.
In the school's education unit, for example, they found many pupils
did very little work, often absented themselves from classes, and
demonstrated scant respect for most of their teachers.
''They wandered around the classrooms at will or left to interrupt
other classes.
''They used abusive language, including the frequent use of sexual
swearwords to each other and to their teachers.
''They issued veiled threats to their teachers and on some occasions
were physically aggressive.''
One of the problems highlighted in the report was the fact that staff
were confused by the guidance given to them on exercising control and
restraint and they believed their hesitation was exploited by some
pupils.
At the time of the inspection, the school had 51 residential pupils,
five of them girls, and seven day pupils. There were four members of
senior promoted staff, 10 teachers, four vocational instructors, 34.8
full-time equivalent (FTE) care staff, and 5.5 FTE ancillary staff.
''There were sufficient teaching staff to deliver the existing
curriculum and the recruitment policy had enabled their range of
specialisms to be broadened in recent years but there was still none
qualified to teach social subjects, drama, music, or religious or moral
education.
''Most teaching staff had arrived at the school with no experience of
special needs provision and had received limited relevant training.''
In the report summary, the inspectors say that, on the positive side,
education and care staff were generally committed to their work and
tried to support the pupils, many of whom had a history of difficult
behaviour and had shown severe disturbance. The inspectors saw examples
of very good teaching and a promising framework for assessing and
planning support for individual pupil needs had been developed.
''The school, however, was failing to meet the needs of the children
in several important regards.
''The behaviour of many pupils in the education unit was unacceptable.
Very little learning was taking place. The morale of staff, particularly
of teachers, was very low.
''The identification of, and response to, individual pupils'
particular needs was generally poor. The strategies to develop care
provision were not sufficiently clear. Care and education were not well
integrated.
''A number of key management tasks were not being tackled effectively.
There were no systematic means of evaluating the school's strengths and
weaknesses or of planning necessary development work.
''The school lacked a clear sense of purpose.
''With notable exceptions the school concentrated on attempting to
cope with the children rather than on developing their potential.''
Mr Ron McKail, the head teacher, and his senior staff said in a
statement last night: ''We welcome the work of HMI in conducting their
inspection between October 1994 and January 1995. We appreciate their
advice and recommendations for improvement.''
In the intervening five months, the great majority of the
recommendations have been implemented. The remainder will be implemented
by the time of the follow-up inspection.
Grampian Regional Councillor Robert Hunter, vice-chairman of the
Oakbank board of governors, said much of the inspectors' criticism
referred to unacceptable behaviour by some pupils in the education
department.
''The behavioural problem arose due to the school accepting a higher
than normal percentage of pupils who had been excluded or expelled from
their mainstream schools.''

A SPENDING cap as used in the NHS would threaten the existence of the
civil legal aid which provides access to justice for poorer members of
society, a leading lawyer has warned.
Such an exercise is one of the options being considered by the
Government as it tries to rein in legal aid spending, running at #125m a
year in Scotland.
The warning was delivered at the weekend at a seminar in Glasgow by
Professor Alan Paterson, head of Strathclyde University's Law School.
He pointed out that Scotland spent significantly more per head on
criminal legal aid than any other country in the world.
Criminal legal aid also accounted for 70% of the total legal aid
budget in Scotland.
He went on: ''I think it is very likely that the Treasury will get its
way and that there will be capping.''
A capping system would work in a similar way to the NHS so that if
funds run out by, say, October, no more would be available until the
following year.
Professor Paterson said: ''With our 110-day rule in criminal cases
(the time within which accused people in custody must be brought to
trial) cash limits can't easily be applied to the criminal legal aid
service.
''So which legal aid budget is going to be hit with capping? It's the
30% that goes to civil legal aid.
''I have a real fear that, in 10 years' time, there won't be much left
of civil legal aid unless that problem is addressed.''
He said the real problem was how to devise a system in which civil
legal aid was protected by being ''ring fenced''.
A Government green paper on legal aid in England is due to be
published this week and lawyers in Scotland think ideas such as capping
are an English solution to a problem which does not exist in Scotland.
Changes in eligibility rules and huge increases in court dues have
already hit hard in Scotland.
Mr Stephen Wright, chairman of the Family Law Association in Scotland,
who spoke at the seminar, pointed out that a man who stabbed his wife
would get criminal legal aid without having to make a contribution. His
victim might have to contribute #500-#1000 to get her remedy in the
courts.
He said the cost of legal aid was 44p per person a week, less than a
chocolate bar and a soft drink.
Dr Richard Scott, the Scottish Legal Aid Board's chief executive, told
the seminar he had not been appointed as a ''hit man'' to bring legal
aid spending under control.
Policy on legal aid was a matter for the Government and Slab's job was
to deliver good-quality services as efficiently and cost effectively as
possible.
He said total spending on legal aid in Scotland had risen from #63.6m
in 1991 to #124.8m in 1994/95 -- an increase of almost 100%.
It had to be recognised that the overall cost of legal aid was fast
approaching, if it had not already done so, the level which the
Government was likely to accept as affordable.
He thought it likely that the Government would seek to limit the legal
aid budget or at least control it more tightly.
However, it would be ''wholly wrong'' automatically to apply English
solutions, such as franchising certain law firms to carry out legal aid
work, to Scotland.

A SCHOOL secretary died yesterday on a trip with a party of primary
school pupils after falling from a canal boat and getting caught in its
propeller.
A male teacher dived in to the canal in a desperate bid to save her.
Police named the dead woman as Mrs Joan Whitehall, 47. She fell in to
the water while trying to steer the narrowboat round a bend, during a
three-week school field-trip on the Grand Union Canal in Birmingham.
She was with a party of 20 pupils using two narrowboats travelling to
Northampton. The male teacher, on a following boat, dived into the water
and tried to rescue her, helped by two workmen from the nearby M6
motorway.
A police spokeswoman said: ''The woman was at the rear of the boat
trying to steer round a bend when she apparently slipped and fell into
the water. She was sucked into the propeller and trapped.
''A male teacher on another boat tried to rescue her along with two
workmen but they failed and she was recovered by the fire brigade. The
children, 10 boys and 10 girls, are from a Nottingham Primary school.''
They were returned home later yesterday.
There were three teachers with the party.
Eyewitnesses said the accident happened at 8.30am when most of the
pupils were eating breakfast.
One said: ''They heard a splash and saw the woman in the water. They
were very shocked and distressed.''
West Midlands Police are trying to trace the dead woman's husband who
is believed to be on a walking trip.
The children were looked after at Queen's Road police station until a
coach arrived to take them home.
A West Midlands Police spokeswoman said that as Mrs Whitehall tumbled
into the water the barge had reversed over her, and she was sucked
beneath it.
Rescuers wearing breathing apparatus pulled her body from the water.
A workman, who witnessed the accident but did not wish to give his
name, said: ''I think she was at the back of the boat and was trying to
reverse it back a bit when she must have slipped.
''It looked like she was being pulled under. She was struggling and
screaming.
''Some of the children were looking through the windows and down the
aisle of the barge when she fell overboard and they were crying.
''One of the workmen working further down jumped in and I think
another teacher jumped in as well but it was too late.''
Yesterday, police officers were on board the boats, unloading bags
containing the pupils' belongings.
A West Midlands Police spokeswoman said: ''It was a lovely school trip
and it is tragic that something so horrific could happen.''
Two other canal trippers, Mr Tim Jenner and Ms Cheryl Larkin told how
they travelled behind the school party for three days before the
tragedy.
Ms Larkin said: ''They all seemed pretty well behaved and they were
having a wonderful time, laughing with each other.''
A spokeswoman from Union Canal Carriers of Rugby from which the barges
were hired for the three-part trip, said: ''We are aware of the accident
but it is being dealt with by the police. We have no further comment to
make at this time.''
A Nottinghamshire County Council spokesman said Mrs Whitehall had been
secretary at the 380-pupil Walter Halls primary school in Querneby Road,
Mappeley, Nottingham, for 10 years.
''Staff and pupils are very shocked. They are still trying to come to
terms with this tragic loss to the school,'' he said.
''Joan Whitehall was a much loved and respected member of staff.''
Sixty children were on the second leg of a three-part educational trip
along the canal when the tragedy happened. They had set off from
Braunston, Leicestershire, on May 6.

DEFEATED American boxer Mike Evans, floored by Frank Bruno in Glasgow
at the weekend, last night was stranded in a city hotel after confusion
surrounding payment for the five-minute fight.
The giant boxer was defeated inside two rounds at the Kelvin Hall on
Saturday night in a fight described by commentators as a farce.
His trainer claimed in an interview with The Herald that his man was
supposed to get a purse of around #30,000 after the fight but had not
received any money.
However, within an hour of making the claim, head trainer, Mr George
Hermandez, said Evans had received a telephone call summoning him to
London on an early morning flight today, where he would be able to
collect his cash.
Earlier, an agitated Mr Hermandez claimed he, and fellow trainer Kraig
Johnson, as well as Evans and his wife Frankie, were stranded in the not
unpleasant surroundings of the Hospitality Inn in Glasgow's city centre
and were unable to fly home to Chicago.
Mr Hermandez said after the fight that the British Boxing Board of
Control had asked to see a video of the fight, which lasted five minutes
and five seconds, but later said Evans should be given his purse.
He said he had not been given any explanation as to why the 19st 4lb
fighter had not been paid immediately after the board had seen the
video.
Mr Hermandez said he had left Chicago without his credit cards and all
four were unable to fly home. He added that each minute spent in Glasgow
meant the costs were adding up.
''We have to stay here another night and pay the hotel. We have also
had to pay an extra #90 each to update the plane tickets.''
He said the fighter had been particularly anxious to get back to the
United States because it was Mother's Day there and he wanted to see his
mother.
Last night, no-one was available to comment on the allegation that the
money had not been handed over immediately after the fight.

A MAN who died in a house fire which killed four children was last
night being viewed as a hero for his attempts to save them.
The body of Alan Lovegrove, 23, was found by Hampshire firefighters
six inches from the bodies of the four trapped children after he had
repeatedly struggled through the flames to reach them.
Neighbours said Mr Lovegrove managed to rescue one child from the fire
but died when he returned to try to save the others.
Mr John Rose, 29, a family friend, said the former postman, who had
been living with mother-of-five Julie Cole, should be praised for his
heroic efforts to save the children.
''He was doing what he could to rescue them, apparently, but was
beaten back by the flames,'' Mr Rose said. ''It seems he went in four
times and the fourth he did not come out.
''He was prepared to die for those children. He should get a medal.''
Mr Rose was speaking outside the burned three-bedroom council house in
Farnborough.
He added that Mr Malcolm Cole, who had left the family home at
Christmas after breaking up with his wife, had ''lost everything'' in
the fire.
''Malcolm saw the kids about a week ago and took a video of them,'' Mr
Rose said. ''That will have to be his lasting memory.''
The children who died in the fire were Christopher Cole, three, and
his brother Dominic, five, and two children who had been visiting
overnight, Jamie Cavanagh, four, and his sister Hayley, six.

LORD Nolan backed away from a confrontation with the Government
yesterday despite renewed demands from Labour for an investigation into
the funding of political parties.
Faced with strong Government opposition to any inquiry into party
fundraising, Lord Nolan, the judge examining standards in public life,
contradicted reports that he was prepared to seek public support for
widening his inquiry and said instead he would not seek to challenge the
Prime Minister on the issue.
However, in interviews yesterday, he made it clear he would not oppose
such a move, while a number of committee members indicated they want to
expand the committee's brief as widely as possible.
Last week, the committee published its first report, which recommended
a number of wide-ranging reforms in the rules governing MPs, Ministers,
and quango appointments.
Since then, Lord Nolan has been under pressure to go further in his
efforts to eradicate sleaze from public life. Party funding is
considered an area ripe for investigation, largely because it is ruled
by secrecy.
Yesterday, Lord Nolan confirmed the issue would be discussed by the
10-member committee at a meeting tomorrow, but stressed it would require
all-party agreement to change its terms of reference.
The Government claims the Nolan committee's brief does not extend to
party funding but supporters of greater openness claim it would be
impossible for the Prime Minister to resist such an inquiry if Lord
Nolan were to demand it.
Interviewed on BBC television, National Heritage Secretary Stephen
Dorrell said: ''I don't think that is in the mainstream of what Lord
Nolan was set up to do. I do think that if people are paid out of public
funds to do a job, they should stick to the job they have been given.''
However, Labour MP Peter Shore, a committee member, disagreed: ''Given
that we are looking at the possible improper impact of money on politics
and politicians, I think it is very difficult to exclude the financing
of political parties.''
Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw said Labour would press the
Government ''extremely hard'' for an extension of the committee's terms
of reference. He added: ''There will be public outrage if Mr Major were
to block the work of the committee in this area.''
Meanwhile, revelations of further examples of boardroom pay excesses
in the privatised utilities brought renewed claims from Labour that the
Government is tolerating financial abuses by its friends.
According to a report in an English Sunday newspaper, National Grid
chairman, Mr David Jefferies, earned more than #350,000 from the sale of
share options before public trading in the shares had begun.
Last September, Mr Jefferies allegedly sold his options in the Grid,
which is being floated on the stock market, to a company trust at a
price set by stockbrokers rather than the open market.
He bought the 60,000 options at either #2.32 or #3.27 each and sold
them to the trust at just over #9 an option.
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown described the alleged sale as ''the
biggest outrage of all'' and added: ''This is a new scandal. Far from
the abuses and excesses abating, they are worsening.
''The Government should step in and say this practice is unacceptable.
It is clambering on the gravy train even before it has left the
station.''
A survey of the privatised utilities by the newspaper found directors
in the electricity, water, and gas industries had awarded themselves
more than #40m in share options.
Four directors in the electricity industry each received options worth
more than #1m and another eight had combined pay and share packages
worth over #1m.
The newspaper also claimed that more than 40 directors avoided paying
tax by switching their options, worth hundreds of thousands of pounds,
into the names of their wives.
His comments prompted Tory demands that Mr Brown appear before the
Commons Select Committee on employment to explain how he would deal with
the issue.

A POWER struggle for the heart of the Scottish Conservative Party has
begun with senior Scottish Tories opening up debate on devolution and
the failure of the party to present a positive self image.
A major shift to libertarian Thatcherite policies is now being offered
as the only option to the electoral failure of Mr John Major's
no-compromise Toryism.
At the centre of the struggle are former party chairman Michael
Forsyth, Secretary of State Ian Lang, Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind,
and ex-Scottish Office Minister Allan Stewart.
In a series of coded messages, open letters, and hard-hitting
speeches, each is using Mr Major's exercise in public consultation as a
platform for their own vision of the future of Scottish Conservatism.
It all began in the week the Prime Minister hoped a Scottish
conference would unite the party after the political humiliation of the
local elections last month.
Only two hours after Mr Major addressed the Scottish party conference
on Friday with a promise of widespread consultation on policy and no
compromise on the issue of a ''strong Union'', former Scottish Secretary
Mr Rifkind reopened the devolution debate.
Mr Rifkind told Channel 4 News he had ''no problems'' about the
principle of devolution or constitutional change if there were similar
proposals which also could be applied throughout the United Kingdom.
''The vast majority of Scots would like to have Scottish parliaments
or assemblies or whatever, if opinion polls are to be believed,'' he
said. ''But they also want to remain part of the United Kingdom and it
is how you reconcile both these aspirations. That is when it starts
getting difficult.''
However, yesterday afternoon, an embarrassed and clearly miffed Mr
Rifkind lambasted The Herald for what he called ''shoddy journalism'' in
reporting his comments.
''It's appalling. This was something I have said dozens of times, yet
you took half a sentence and used it as the most important thing that
has happened this century,'' he said.
Nevertheless, whether he likes it or not, Mr Rifkind will be regarded
by historians as the Conservative Minister who reopened the potentially
damaging devolution debate.
Five minutes after his outburst, Mr Forsyth praised The Herald for its
part in opening up the discussion on the future of Scottish
Conservatism.
In a keynote address to a fringe meeting at the party conference --
which The Herald reported almost in full -- Mr Forsyth called for a
classless and open society, ''flexible and adaptable'' to need.
He said the new society should be ''planned at the periphery by its
citizens and not from the centre by its leaders'' and called for the
removal of the ''minutiae of regulation and red tape which binds and
strangles the enthusiasm and drive of those building the businesses of
tomorrow''.
The speech, which broke three years of almost silence by the former
Scottish party chairman on Scottish issues, has been regarded by most
commentators as his clearest play yet to succeed Mr Lang when he is
promoted in a reshuffle later this year.
However, a month ago, a source close to Mr Forsyth said he privately
did not want to go back to New St Andrew's House.
Yesterday, Mr Forsyth denied he was now making a play for Mr Lang's
job, saying his only ambition was to be ''Secretary of State for
Stirling''.
Mr Forsyth said it was now important to open up a vigorous debate on
the future of Conservatism and Scotland.
He said there was a need for the party to represent itself with a
positive self image. ''As for the constitutional question, we clearly
have a political problem there.''
He claimed the Conservative Party had lost out to a concerted campaign
by the opposition for a Scottish parliament and as a result was not
getting the ''patriotic vote''.
''We must get across how dangerous the Labour Party's proposals would
be,'' he said, ''not just the threat to the Union and the rough road to
separation but the impact that a tartan tax of an extra 3p in the pound
will have on jobs and the family.
''It would be a tax simply for the privilege of working in Scotland --
the absurdity of this notion is a message we are not getting across.
''A lot of people in Scotland believe they have been sidelined and are
losing out by a Government not taking sufficient account of Scottish
circumstances.
''We have now got to open ourselves to more ideas on how we can make
that change in Scotland without doing anything which may be at the
expense of people's jobs,'' he urged.
He dismissed the concept of a non-tax raising assembly for Scotland as
something which ''even the Labour Party admit wouldn't work'' and called
for an evolution of the Union.
The evolutionary view is shared by Mr Stewart who added more pressure
to Mr Major via an open letter published in yesterday's Sunday Times.
Tying his colours firmly to Mr Forsyth's mast, Mr Stewart said:
''Scottish Toryism needs to be pragmatic . . . taking some policy risks
and trusting the ordinary Scots with more responsibility for their own
futures.
''We should be in favour of evolution, not devolution. Otherwise the
party's views could be portrayed as unthinking defence of the status quo
and therefore unpatriotic.''
His words have added weight to suggestions at last week's conference
by Lord Mackay and Lord Fraser that the party should be open to ideas on
a new Tory approach to home rule.
However, Mr Lang is maintaining a tight rein on the status quo and was
quick to distance himself from further proposals propagated by sources
close to Mr Forsyth which are seen to give too much power to a Scottish
Secretary, making him akin to a Scottish Prime Minister.
''My own view is we have done most of what can be done within the
constraints we have set ourselves. I draw the line at ideas that would
undermine the integrity of the parliamentary system,'' said Mr Lang.

A BRITISH climber has become the first woman to conquer Mount Everest
without Sherpa porters or oxygen.
Alison Hargreaves, 33, of Spean Bridge, Inverness-shire, reached the
29,028ft summit just after noon on Saturday and radioed her base camp to
send a message to her children, Tom, six, and Kate, four. It said: ''I
am on top of the world and I love you dearly.''
Last night, her achievement was hailed as the most important climb
ever undertaken by a woman. Hargreaves, born in Belper, Derbyshire,
approached the summit from the Tibetan side and scaled the North Col and
North Face, where George Mallory and Andrew Irvine disappeared during
their 1924 attempt.
She had established her third camp at 27,200ft late on Friday
afternoon and set out for the summit at 4.40am. She reached the North
Ridge between the First and Second Steps at around 7am and, two hours
later, the bottom of the Second Step, where it is thought Mallory and
Irvine were last seen.
She climbed it, ascending into sunlight where climbers on the South
Col watched her reach the summit.
After sending the message to her children, she planted a silk flower
on the roof of the world. On the way down, she lost her radio while
descending the Second Step but safely reached her advance camp at
21,000ft, 12 miles up the Rongbuk glacier from the 17,000ft base camp.
Her feat has been achieved by only one man -- Italian Reinhold Messner
who is known as the world's top climber.
Hargreaves, who uses her maiden name for professional climbing, left
her husband, Jim Ballard, 48, a climbing photographer, at their home in
the West Highlands to look after the children.
He said: ''I am very proud of Alison. I always had confidence in her
ability to get to the roof of the world, although I was the first to
acknowledge that she had set herself a formidable target on Mount
Everest.
''But the important thing is that she has actually achieved her
ambition which she had nurtured since she first became hooked on
climbing when she started on rock faces in the Peak District near her
home as a 14-year-old schoolgirl.''
This is her fourth Himalayan expedition and the ascent adds to her
place in climbing history as the first person to scale the six classic
north faces of the Alps -- the Eiger, Matterhorn, Grandes Jorasses, Dru,
Badille, and Cima Grande.
Last year, Hargreaves made her first ''unmasked alone'' attempt to
climb Everest and was 1500ft from the summit when she was driven back by
blizzards. She had reached the highest point attained by an unaided
woman.
After a short break in Scotland, she leaves in mid-June on an
expedition to the 28,253ft K2, the world's second-highest mountain in
the Karakorum range in Pakistan's eastern Himalayas.
Hargeaves, who had graduated to winter rock-climbing in the Highlands
before she left school, ran, skied, climbed, and mountain-biked at Nevis
Range ski centre on Aonach Mor, near Fort William, this spring to build
up her stamina, strength, and fitness before flying to Tibet last month.
The first woman to stand on the summit of Everest was Juno Tabei in
1975 but she was part of a large expedition using Sherpas and oxygen.

A CROWD of around 2000 star gazers gathered last night to glimpse Liam
Neeson and Jessica Lange arrive for the European gala premiere of their
new movie Rob Roy.
Edinburgh's Clerk Street is not quite Sunset Boulevard and the weather
refused to be caught up in the night of Hollywood glamour . . . it
rained.
However, the crowd's enthusiasm was as undiminished as the optimism of
Scottish tourism officials, who hope the current wave of
made-in-Scotland movies will bring visitors galore.
Bystanders lining the streets behind crowd barriers cheered as a
steady procession of limousines pulled up, with lesser celebrities
arriving by coach, and on foot. A police pipe band played and saltires
flew from windows.
Early arrivals among the 700 VIPs and celebrities included Selina
Scott with an unidentified escort.
Other TV celebrities included John Leslie, Tania Bryer, and Blythe
Duff from Taggart.
Sporting celebrities included Scotland's rugby captain Gaving
Hastings, winner of this year's Herald Player of the Year award, who got
one of the warmest receptions from the crowd.
Stars from Rob Roy itself included Eric Stoltz, John Hurt, Brian Cox,
Andrew Keir, and Brian McCardie.
However, the biggest cheer of the night went to the two stars of the
film, Neeson in a dark tuxedo and Lange wearing a cream trouser outfit.
The #20m feature film opens in London and Dublin on May 19, and
nationwide on May 26.
Hollywood's version of Rob Roy comes 250 years after the Jacobite
rising of 1745, where the cattle thief turned folk hero fought on the
Jacobite side.
After the premiere, a lavish VIP party was staged in Princes Street
Gardens, against the backdrop of Edinburgh Castle.
Other big productions attracted to Scotland include Braveheart,
starring Mel Gibson, and Loch Ness starring Ted Danson.
