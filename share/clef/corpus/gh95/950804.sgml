JIM Jefferies' spell in limbo could last for months after talks about
his future between the leaders of Hearts and Falkirk broke down last
night.
Chris Robinson and George Fulston met at Tynecastle to try to thrash
out a compensation deal, but Fulston left admitting that the two clubs
were ''poles apart.''
Hearts offered as recompense a year of Jefferies' existing salary,
believed to be around #70,000, in the less than amicable talks for the
man Fulston claims was induced to break his contract.
But that sum was dismissed as totally unacceptable by the Falkirk
chairman, who, two days ago, gave Jefferies leave of absence, under
suspension, on full salary.
''They are looking for 10 times what we consider adequate, and we will
now consult with the Scottish League to see what our next step will
be,'' commented Robinson.
In the meantime, Jefferies has not set foot in Tynecastle, and Hearts
have not yet formally named him as the man to replace the sacked Tommy
McLean.
The trouble started on Saturday, when Jefferies announced jointly with
Fulston that he was staying at Brockville for another seven years after
five successful seasons.
However, during Sunday, he changed his mind, and it was then Falkirk
claimed he was persuaded to breach his contract, the Friday lunchtime
deadline for talks with Hearts having passed.
Earlier this season, when Celtic were found to have broken League and
SFA rules when recruiting Tommy Burns and Billy Stark from Kilmarnock,
it cost them #300,000.
And now Jefferies' assistant, Billy Brown, has added a further note of
complication into a business already surrounded by confusion, when
leaving Falkirk.
He has said his farewells to the Brockville players in order to start
his new job at Hearts, but there has been no contact between the clubs
over his position.
Meanwhile, Hearts travel to meet Derby County at the Baseball Ground
tomorrow when it seems certain that Jefferies will stay at home, leaving
Eamonn Bannon to continue in his uneasy caretaker post.

Gothenburg,
BRITAIN, inspired by Churchillian oratory from senior athletics
official Peter Radford, struck a resounding blow against drug cheats
yesterday, forcing a world-wide climb-down on plans to relax penalties
against convicted offenders.
But International Amateur Athletic Federation officials are furious.
They wanted to cut the existing suspension for steroid and hormone abuse
from four years to two. They said the Radford-inspired victory could
cost them millions of dollars in legal fees.
Radford, formerly professor of sports science at Glasgow University
but now executive chairman of the British Athletic Federation, made an
impassioned speech at the IAAF congress in Sweden on the eve of the
World Athletics Championships, which open today.
A former head of the Sports Council's anti-doping unit and an Olympic
sprint medallist, Radford's unique perspective of the issues caused a
surprise 137-49 vote, overturning the IAAF proposal, which had look
certain to win.
German delegates Otto Klappert and Helmut Digel, who had proposed the
reduction to two years, stormed from the hall.
''Radford has just made an emotional speech,'' said German Athletics
Association president Digel. ''It was unbelievable. He has got people
standing up and saying we must be hard on drug-takers -- and many of
them (i.e. their countries) don't drug test.''
Klappert said: ''It was like listening to Churchill -- ''we'll fight
on and fight on. And if we lose, we will fight again.' ''
However, the potential repercussions of the vote could be costly.
Within hours, the IAAF had received a protest letter, signed by 15
countries. Many of these countries, including Germany, have restraint of
trade employment legislation which limits penalties to two years.
In the past four years, the legal bill for athletics anti-doping
litigation in the civil courts in the USA, France, Germany, and Italy
alone has topped #39m, according to Arne Ljuogqvisd, the Swedish
professor who heads the IAAF medical commission.
Primo Nebiolo, the Italian president of the IAAF, was furious. ''We
don't have the money to pay out millions of dollars a year,'' he said.
He added that if forced to indemnify member countries, athletes' prize
money and funds for competitions could be threatened.
BAF spokesman Ward insisted that it would have been wrong to change
the rules as a matter of expediency. ''It's up to the Germans to sort
out their own problems. It's essential for the sport to keep stiff
penalties for drug- taking.''
The council also agreed in principal to bar from future championships,
any athlete in the world's top 20 who has not undergone at least two
out-of-season dope tests in the previous 12 months. A workable method of
applying the proposal is now being investigated.

PATRICIA Meunier spearheaded a rewarding day for the French when she
gathered an impressive haul of eight birdies in a course record
seven-under-par 65 to lead the field after the opening round of the
Payne &amp; Gunter Scottish Open golf championship at Dalmahoy yesterday.
It left the former French amateur champion from Dijon one stroke ahead
of her compatriot Marie-Laure de Lorenzi, who shared second place with
Britain's Alison Nicholas, who is searching for a first European victory
in four years.
Janice Moodie, the Curtis Cup player from Glasgow and playing in her
first professional tournament, was the best of the Scots after a 70 but
Laura Davies, the holder, had to settle for a 72.
Meunier came to prominence when she won the English Open last season
in her first year as a professional. She put that success down to
working with her Aunt Nicole who specialises in neurolinguistic
programming which gives people the confidence to make their own
decisions.
She still works with her aunt, but after a slow start to the season,
Meunier re-discovered her rhythm in Ireland last week during a session
with her coach, Corinne Soules, another French professional who also
looks after the French national team.
Meunier, one of the late starters when the wind had strengthened,
moved into the picture when she reached the ninth in 33, then birdied
the tenth and twelfth holes as she turned for home.
She dropped her only shot of the day at the fourteenth where she
missed the green, but then holed from 12ft and 4ft for birdies at the
next two before a sand wedge to 6ft earned a birdie at the eighteenth to
be home in 32.
Nicholas, winner of the LPGA Corning Classic in New York last May, was
also a late starter, and had needed encouragement after having taken 6
at the par-5 opening hole.
That encouragement arrived with three birdies in four holes from the
third followed by an eagle 3 at the ninth where a No 5-iron pulled up
15ft from the hole.
Two more birdies followed at the twelfth and fifteenth, but the
Yorkshire player narrowly missed putts which would have lifted her into
a share of the lead.
''Beware the injured golfer'' is an old adage, and de Lorenzi proved
the point with her 66.
The elegant Barcelona-based French golfer missed the Irish Open last
week with a shoulder injury, but showed no signs of discomfort
yesterday.
She was not too happy when her playing partners, Trish Johnson and
Evelyn Orley, each birdied the first four holes but de Lorenzi opened
her own account with three birdies in five holes from the third then
struck a No 3-iron on to the green for a birdie 4 at the ninth.
Out in 32, de Lorenzi birdied the twelfth before dropping her only
shot of the day at the fourteenth, where she pulled her drive into the
rough. Undaunted, she then holed from fully 40ft for a 2 at the short
fifteenth.
At the eighteenth, de Lorenzi played a master stroke from the left
rough when she pushed a low No 8-iron run-up on to the green then holed
a putt of 15ft for a seventh birdie of the day.
Moodie startled herself when suddenly she found herself on top of the
leaderboard after a spectacular run of four birdies in a row from the
short seventh where she struck a superb No.6-iron to within a yard of
the hole.
The spell was broken when Moodie underclubbed to finish in sand at the
fourteenth then dropped another stroke at the next hole where she took
three putts.
Davies had a mixed round containing four birdies and four bogeys. It
could have been worse. She drove behind a tree at the eighteenth, and
played a left handed sand-iron recovery, with her ball rebounding
narrowly into play from a spectator barrier behind the green.
A bogey 5 was the result, after which Davies admitted: ''I could so
easily have been out of bounds, but I got lucky. I am disappointed. I
really played well but took four bogeys from nowhere.''

CELTIC midfield man Peter Grant praised his Ibrox opposite number Paul
Gascoigne yesterday -- and then warned he would not have things his own
way this season.
Grant is ready to recognise the quality Rangers have brought in this
summer but, as always, he is ready to challenge that.
Yesterday as he looked forward to tomorrow's clash with Newcastle
United, and the coming premier-division programme, Grant stressed:
''Paul Gascoigne is a world class player. And Brian Laudrup is another
man who is among the top players in Europe.
''We know that Rangers have great players, we don't need to be told
that. As well as the new players they still have the likes of Ally
McCoist and Mark Hateley and so we know that there is a huge challenge
lying in front of us.
''But we have won the Scottish Cup, and we know that our support want
us to win the league title. That is the yardstick upon which we will
always be judged. We know that. We accept that.''
Celtic insisted last night that there will be no public sale of
tickets for the Newcastle game. They have warned fans not to approach
the ground on the day of the game unless they have a ticket.
Club chief executive Fergus McCann explained: ''The response for
season tickets has been superb. The processing procedure has been
considerable and we are grateful for the supporters' patience as our
team of some 30 staff have worked round the clock to process requests,
while a new #120,000 computerised ticket system has been installed along
with a new #30,000 international telephone network.''
Season ticket holders bringing Voucher 33 can still purchase tickets
at the ground today between 9am and 9pm, at a cost of #8.
* EXPERIENCED defender Tommy McQueen last night signed a two-year deal
with Dundee and helped to convince Dens Park manager Jim Duffy that he
did not have to join the summer's big spenders in the transfer market in
order to strengthen the club's challenge.
McQueen, freed by Falkirk, is Duffy's second signing of the week. He
will join up with another former Brockville player, Roddy Manley, who
has just returned from a spell in Hong Kong.

RANGERS could be in the market place again by the weekend -- but this
time as sellers. Two French clubs, Nancy and Strasbourg, are reported to
be interested in taking defender Basile Boli back home.
The powerful Boli joined up at Ibrox from Marseille just over a year
ago, but he has found it difficult to settle into the hectic demands of
Scottish football.
The player cost close to #2m when he arrived at Rangers along with
Brian Laudrup last close season. However, while the Dane prospered Boli
found himself under increasing pressure.
It is obvious now that he is out of the Rangers' first-team plans,
particularly with the signing of Gordan Petric from Dundee United, and a
transfer is the only obvious solution.
Meanwhile, Rangers will go to Tannadice tonight for the last match in
their pre-season build-up. Again Smith will field a powerful team,
allowing his players the chance to be fully match fit for their European
Cup preliminary round clash with Anorthosis of Cyprus at Ibrox next
week.
Dundee United manager Billy Kirkwood wants a quartet of strikers to
convince him the Tannadice challenge will be strong in the new season.
''I am in the market for a front player,'' he said, ''but I want players
at the club to help me make up my mind about our forward partnership.''

FROM kick boxer to world's fastest man -- that is the form of sprinter
Donovan Bailey. The Canadian, ranked No.1 in the world this year with
9.91secs, has emerged as the most potent threat to Linford Christie's
defence of the 100 metres title when the World Athletics Championships
open here tomorrow.
Bailey spent six years as a competitive kick boxer, the last two doing
the full-contact version. But he cannot have taken too many blows to the
head, on the evidence of his articulate delivery in Sweden yesterday.
''I don't subscribe to the view that the man who beats Christie is the
one who will win the title,'' said Bailey, a serious athlete for less
than two years. ''There are a lot of good guys -- the Nigerians, and you
can't write off Marsh and Mitchell.''
When Christie and he contested the 100m in Oslo, they did not even get
to meet. Bailey, in a different heat, false started, then failed to
reach the final.
''It was right after my 9.91, and my coach had warned me I would be a
bit flat. I was too busy thinking about the final, and about racing
Christie, and I blew it.
''But he does not have any psychological edge on me. I'm not some kid
just out of college, like he is used to.'' He conceded, however:
''Christie does have a psychological advantage over the Americans. He is
mentally very, very, tough -- the master of four rounds, which is the
true test of a champion.''
While Bailey accords Christie his coveted respect, he is a totally
different type of character. Soft spoken, gentle, despite his martial
arts background, he is in stark contrast to Christie's aggression,
exemplified once again when he marched off the plane in Gothenburg last
night and immediately struck an intimidating pose towards local
photographers attempting to catch his arrival.
The 27-year-old Bailey has an economics degree, and is a stockbroker
by profession. He runs a real-estate business with his brother, but
takes little to do with the day-to-day working. ''International
athletics is too demanding.''
What gets to Bailey most is the drugs issue. He admits that: ''the
first man to have any faith in me was Charlie Francis.''
It is not politically correct to align with the disgraced coach of the
infamous Ben Johnson, deposed 100m winner in Seoul. But Bailey admits
further: ''Ben was my idol when I was a kid. When he was done for drugs,
it hit me hard. I was terribly disappointed.
''Obviously since Johnson, every sprinter is under very close
scrutiny. I've been tested six times in the three weeks since my 9.91. I
feel I should carry a cup around with me ready to give a urine sample.
I know Linford says he has been tested 17 times in the past year, but
I have been done even more than that. I don't like it, but how can I
complain after Johnson, particularly as I am a Canadian.
''After Ben, the Canadian public turned off athletics, and
particularly sprinting, but I would love to win a gold, and have someone
call me, like the Prime Minister called Ben in Seoul.''
* IVAN Pedroso's long jump of 8.96m in Sestriere last Saturday will
not be ratified, it was confirmed yesterday.
Enrico Jacomini, spokesman for the Italian Athletics Federation, under
whose jurisdiction the event was staged, said that though they have
passed the data to the world body, they have recommended that the mark
should not count.
Three video tapes show former pole vaulter Luciano Gemello standing
within 20 centimetres of the wind guage for all six of the Cuban's
jumps.
Pedroso, on learning of the decision, said: ''I will get the record
anyway. I believe I can go over nine metres.''
* WOMEN'S hammer and pole vault will be included in all senior major
championships from the 1998 Europeans onwards. The first pole vault will
be in the 1997 world indoor, and the first hammer at the 1996 world
junior event.
* CURTIS Robb, who lines up with Scotland's David Strang in the first
round of the 800m tomorrow, used to be a good-looking fellow. But he has
shaved his head, and only needs the spectacles to resemble Ben Kingsley
in the role of Ghandi.
''It is to remind myself, when I look in the mirror each day, what my
life is about -- a wake-up call if you like, to keep me focussed on
training.''
Robb, medical studies out of the way, has run only four races all
season, the same as Strang. Now, if they reach the final on Tuesday,
they face three in four days.

FORMER Scotland and British Lions' winger Roger Baird has quit the
playing side to concentrate on building up Watsonians. He has been
appointed to take charge of the Myreside club's newly formed under-21
squad.
Baird, who spent most of his career with Kelso, has already fixed up
17 games, including some south of the Border. He added: ''I decided to
call it a day after breaking my arm for a second time near the end of
last season. Now I hope I can pass on some of my experience.''
* STIRLING County, Scottish rugby's national champions, have landed
lucrative five-figure sponsorship with the multi-national beer giants,
Carlsberg Tetley Alloa.
* DAVID Johnston, Watsonians' former international centre, is expected
to take over from Douglas Morgan as coach of Scotland's international
XV. Morgan confirmed his retirement after the World Cup in South Africa
in June.
It is understood that Johnston has been nominated as coach by a
Scottish Rugby Union sub-committee. The appointment will be discussed by
the SRU's full committee in Edinburgh this evening.

WHEN it came to the crunch, Britain's crews overcame all their illness
difficulties on repechage day in Posnam at the World Junior Rowing
Championships with all crews qualifying for either the semi-finals or
main finals stages.
Included among the finalists are the women's four with George Watson's
College members, Katrina Hastings and Isabel Walker aboard. They won
their race ahead of Canada, New Zealand and Australia, and in doing so
showed that they have a real chance of taking a medal in Saturday's
final.
Walker was restored to this crew yesterday after having succumbed to
the salmonella outbreak which has still not been satsifactorily
explained by the organising committee.
Yesterday's racing was peppered with withdrawals because of illness,
and the number of affected athletes, which peaked at over 70 on
Wednesday, has still not subsided.
The Germans have decided to pick up their food by way of daily
collections back across the border, rather than risk the official food,
which was the original source of the outbreak. Other teams, including
Ireland and the United States, are using local hotels and restaurants.

RICHARD Corsie took a step closer to his dream of a first win in the
Scottish Power national singles championship at Northfield yesterday
when wins against Alex Arbuckle and Duncan Gray took him through to this
morning's quarter-final stage.
Corsie was joined in the last eight by his Commonwealth Games
team-mate Willie Hay, former world championship gold medallist Doug
Lambert, and Grant Knox, who claimed a Commonwealth pairs gold at
Edinburgh in 1986.
Corsie always was in command in his opening match with Arbuckle, and
despite a tricky, bumpy green won 21-10. His second-round opponent,
Gray, started well in their last-16 clash and restricted Corsie to just
a single-shot lead at 4-3 after four ends.
However, the 28-year-old Edinburgh man stepped up a gear and over the
next eight ends forged into a 16-5 lead, before Gray narrowed the gap
with a maximum four on the thirteenth end.
However, it was all over three ends later with a double completing a
21-11 win for Corsie.
Oban-based Hay had to work hard for his morning, 21-14 win over George
Leslie, but got things a lot easier in his second-round 21-9 win against
Alex Cathie.
Doug Lambert, who has dropped out of the international scene since his
world team gold at Aberdeen in 1984, began with a 21-18 win over George
Ferrier before defeating Ian Beattie 21-7. Earlier Beattie had romped to
a 21-3 win against John Weir.
Grant Knox got off the mark with a 21-10 win against Victor Hunter,
and then went on to edge out Robbie Robison 21-20. Stonehouse's George
Whitelaw, winner two years ago, beat George Kincaid 21-15, and then
recovered from 13-19 down to tie indoor internationalist Graham Archer
20-20. But Archer got the vital match-winning shot on the twenty-eighth
end. Results:
Singles: First round -- B Anderson (Gala) 21, D Peacock (Danderhall)

* MERCURY announced yesterday it is investing #235m expanding its
mobile phone operation.
The Mercury One-2-One service is currently in the South-east and West
Midlands regions, but by the end of the year will have extended along
the south coast, throughout the Midlands and into North-west England.
The company plans to extend the service into Wales and along the east
coast and into Scotland by December 1997.
''With Mercury One-2-One's service successfully established within two
regions, we're now rapidly expanding the network to offer our best-value
brand of mobile phone service right across the country, reaching
national coverage in a little over two years from now,'' said One-2-One
managing director Richard Goswell.
By the end of March the service had 260,000 customers and has taken
6.5% of the national mobile phone market since its launch nearly two
years ago.

SCANDINAVIAN MASTERS in Malmo
IAN Woosnam shot a five-under-par 67 in the first round of the Volvo
Scandinavian Masters in Malmo yesterday and then expressed doubts about
winning a Ryder Cup place in September.
Woosnam is currently eleventh in the cup points table and only the
first 10 are selected automatically. Normally he could expect one of the
two wild card places along with Nick Faldo, who is playing on the US
Tour, but there are complications.
Jose Maria Olazabal, another must for the European team, is suffering
from an injured foot and is tenth in the points at present. But unless
Woosnam or Olazabal start collecting more points they could both be out
of the top 10 as well as Faldo -- and captain Bernard Gallacher would
have to leave out one of three key players.
After this week there are still three more tournaments before the team
is announced, but Woosnam's major problem is that he is only playing in
the USPGA Championship in Los Angeles next week and then having two
weeks off.
''I have made all sorts of arrangement in those two weeks, including
corporate days, and I also need a rest,'' said Woosnam. ''A lot of
players can leapfrog each other in the next two or three weeks, but I
suppose I might put in an entry for the German Open.'' That is the last
event before Gallacher announces his team, but victory this week could
seal a place for Woosnam.
Woosnam finished the day one stroke behind four players, Ross
McFarlane, Mike McLean, Paul Broadhurst and New Zealander Frank Nobilo.
Open champion John Daly shot 71, one under par, and refused to wear a
hat after having his head shaved earlier in the week. ''I played pretty
well, except I three-putted three times, including missing a putt of
just one foot at the seventeenth, where I pulled it a little bit,'' he
said.
Colin Montgomerie shot 70 on another hot and humid day with only a
slight breeze. The burly Scot is never really happy when he is not right
in contention, but he is only four shots back and could easily make up
the leeway with three rounds to come.
Leading scores (British and Irish unless otherwise stated. * denotes
amateur):
66 -- R McFarlane, F Nobilo (New Zealand), P Broadhurst, M McLean.
67 -- I Woosnam, M-A Jimenez (Spain), J Parnevik (Sweden), R Allenby
(Australia), S Cage.
68 -- R Goosen (S Africa), S Bottomley, A Forsbrand (Sweden), B Lane.

Claydon, M Campbell (New Zealand), F Lindgren (Sweden), C Mason, R

70 -- G Emerson, M Jonzon (Sweden), D Carter, P Eales, O Nordberg
(Sweden), A Bossert (Switzerland), S McAllister, D Robertson, L
Westwood, C Montgomerie, P Affleck, M Litton, J Spence.
Other scores included:
71 -- J Daly (USA), A Coltart, A Hunter.
72 -- V Singh (Fiji), M James.
74 -- G Brand Jr, P Walton, P-U Johansson (Sweden), I Pyman.
75 -- R Drummond, M Miller.

FRASER Mann returned a 68 in difficult conditions yesterday to take a
share of the lead alongside Nick Job after the third round of the
Glenmuir Club Professionals' championship at West Hill, Surrey.
Colin Gillies, who had led the event, did not play well and dropped
two shots behind the leaders on the 204 mark.
Mann, who now plies his trade at Musselburgh, moved alongside Job with
a gritty round as a blustery wind swept across the sun-baked course.
His run of pars was broken only at the 297-yard twelfth, where he
drove the green and two-putted from six feet, finishing tied on 202,
five under par, for the #63,000 event.
''It was tricky out there today,'' said Mann. ''There was no way to
tell which direction the wind was coming from. I was just trying to hit
the fairways and greens.''
Gillies failed to repeat the good form with which he had equalled the
old course record in the third round. ''The wind was stronger out there
and it was difficult to judge which direction it was coming from,'' he
said.
''I suppose it has taken a little pressure off me but I would rather
be two shots in front than two behind. But I will go out and give it my
best shot tomorrow, that's for sure.'' Leading third-round aggregates:
202 -- N Job (Richmond) 65, 69, 68; F Mann (Musselburgh) 68, 66, 68.
203 -- W Grant (West Berkshire) 68, 66, 69; J Higgins (Patshull) 69,
65, 69; P Carman (Huddersfield) 66, 69, 68.
204 -- H Stott (Laleham) 70, 65, 69; C Gillies (Falkirk) 69, 64, 71.
205 -- N Brown (Mid-Herts) 72, 67, 66; G Brown (Ganton) 72, 62, 71.
206 -- T Rastall (Mottram Hall) 69, 70, 67; D Scott (Letham Grange)
66, 72, 68; G Smith (Camberley Heath) 65, 71, 70; B McGovern (Headford)
69, 67, 70.
207 -- R Weir (Cowal) 68, 72, 67; R Tinworth (Nizels) 68, 71, 68; K
Stables (Montrose) 70, 69, 68; L Fickling (Enfield) 71, 67, 69; A
MacKenzie (Calcot Park) 67, 68, 72; R Blackie (Chelsfield) 71, 68, 68.
* COLIN Mitchell (Blairgowrie) ended the challenge of the only
remaining local hope when he defeated Ryan Lumsden by 2 and 1 in a
semi-final yesterday of the St Andrews Boys' Open over the Old Course.
Mitchell now will meet Tommy McInally (Loudoun) in the 18-hole final.
The 17-year-old Scottish schoolboy internationalist scored a 3 and 2
victory over Steven Horne (Tulliallan).
In the junior women's event, Vikki Laing (Musselburgh) staged a
dramatic fightback to earn a place in the final. The 14-year-old was two
down at the turn playing against leading qualifier Natalee Evans
(Pleasington), but stormed back to win by two holes.
Laing now will play Linzi Morton (Tulliallan), the 15-year-old who
scored a 5 and 4 victory over Sally Tait (North Berwick).
* GARY Lister and Douglas Nicol shared the leading qualifiers spot for
Monday's SPGA Masters at Downfield yesterday when they carded
four-under-par 69s. Leading scores:
69 -- G Lister (Inverness), D Nicol (Letham Grange).
70 -- J Wither (Paisley), D Thomson (Kings Links), S Craig
(Dunfermline), I Bratton (Cruden Bay).
* RESULTS from the Aberdeen Ladies' Meeting at Ellon:

HUNDREDS of professionals competing in the ranking event qualifiers at
Blackpool's Norbreck Castle Hotel have broken with tradition -- by
discarding their waistcoats and bow-ties.
But the players are not rebelling against the sport's strict dress
code. The move has been sanctioned by the World Professional Billiards
and Snooker Association because of the current heatwave, which has seen
temperatures hit 90 degrees in the arena.
It was not only the players who were allowed to dress down yesterday,
the referees, who have been experiencing problems with sweating hands
when polishing and replacing the balls, were excused from wearing their
blazers.
WPBSA spokesman Stewart Weir said the majority of players had welcomed
the new fashion. ''But one player, who preferred not to be named,
thought the idea had not gone far enough,'' said Weir. ''He reckoned
they should all be allowed to play in shorts!''
* TICKETS for the Regal Masters at Motherwell Civic Centre from
September 19 to 24, which went on sale on Monday, are already up by a
quarter on the same stage last year.

TOMMY Horton posted a four-under-par 67 yesterday to grab a share of
the lead at the Lawrence Batley Seniors tournament at Fixby,
Huddersfield.
Horton is on 141, one under par, along with Italy's Alberto Croce (72)
going into the final round.
They are the only two sub-par totals after a day which provided the
golfers with tough conditions on the fast-running, undulating course in
the Pennines. Horton, made two eagle 3s and three birdies in a charge
reminiscent of his late challenge in last week's Senior British Open at
Portrush.
Meanwhile, Senior British Open champion Brian Barnes is likely to
resume playing at Sunningdale next Friday. The big Scot will line up for
the Forte PGA Seniors championship if the phlebitis in his right leg
continues to improve.
''I have been on antibiotics and a specialist has prescribed further
treatment and advised plenty of rest,'' said Barnes. ''If the leg
continues to improve, I have a good chance of playing at Sunningdale.''
Leading aggregates (British and Irish unless otherwise stated):
141 -- T Horton 74, 67; A Croce (Italy) 69, 72.
142 -- N Coles 70, 72; M Gregson 73, 69.
143 -- B Hunt 71, 72; D Creamer 73, 70.
144 -- B Huggett 70, 74; L Higgins 71, 73; J Morgan 71, 73.

146 -- M Bembridge 74, 72; B Verwey (S Africa) 76, 70; P Butler 76,

147 -- D Simon (USA) 68, 79.
ULSTERMAN David Feherty made a flying start when the rain-delayed
Buick Open finally started yesterday at Grand Blanc, Michigan.
Earlier, just 45 minutes of play was possible before heavy rain
rendered the course unplayable, and the scores of the three.

MICHAEL Brooks, 23-year-old son of Andrew, the former Walker Cup
player, contrived the first notable upset of the J &amp; B Scottish Amateur
Golf Championship at Southerness yesterday when, in sweltering heat, he
beat Graham Rankin, the strongest emergent force in the game this
season, on the home green in the fifth round.
Brooks will this morning meet Barclay Howard, the other seed in the
second quarter and also a member of the Walker Cup side. In the first
game in the top half of the draw, Simon Mackenzie, who eliminated the
seeded Alan Reid, last year's runner up, will play Henry Thompson, a
36-year-old scratch golfer from Irvine.
The holder, Hugh McKibbin, who is attempting to become the first
player since Charlie Green in 1983 to retain the title, will play Gavin
Paterson, another scratch player, and in the last quarter-final Alan
Turnbull, who defeated David Robertson, will play Euan Little, the
Scottish youth champion.
Howard regretted that he would not be facing Rankin, for they are
close friends off the course and rivals on it. But he looked forward to
playing the younger man, who has been a home international team reserve
for the past two years.
There was never more than a hole in it, but in the end, Rankin's
holing out, usually so assured, betrayed him over the closing holes.
Brooks took the lead by pitching to six feet for a birdie 3 at the
sixteenth, and Rankin, after he had thrashed a No.3 iron out of heather
at the last, missed a four-foot birdie putt to take the match on.
Against Wilson Bryson, Howard was out in 33, three under par, and four
up. That was more than enough of a cushion to take Howard through to
meet Brooks, his junior by 19 years, and whose father was almost a
contemporary of Howard's at the start of his career.
Mackenzie had two creditable wins, over the East of Scotland champion,
Graham Davidson and then Reid. Like Reid he had made rather heavy
weather of finishing off his third-round game, but after Mackenzie had
taken the first two holes in par Reid, whom he also beat two years ago,
was struggling.
Mackenzie, four up after 13, did not relax his grip and he went on to
face Thompson who was on the ropes at two down with four to play against
a host club member, Colin McMinn. But a No.5 iron to four feet for a 2
won him the short fifteenth, and par the last two holes.
McKibbin let the pars do the winning by 5 and 4 over Graham Fox and,
with the seeds being scattered in the English championship, he has kept
his Walker Cup ambitions alive.
Paterson, who beat his Hayston namesake James, took a very different
route, making five birdies. An economics and marketing graduate,
Paterson, 23, finished his man off with a No.4-iron shot to within six
inches at the fourteenth and a pitch to 10 feet at the sixteenth.

SCOTTISH Radio Holdings' chief executive James Gordon outlined plans
for a move into Ireland in Dublin yesterday.
The publicly quoted company is considering a bid for the Irish licence
which will be advertised by Eire's Independent Radio and Television
Commission at the end of this month.
Scottish Radio Holdings dominates its home market, owning four
stations and with a stake in two others.
Last week it was unsuccessful in a #100m bid for Newcastle's Metro
Radio. Now, according to Mr Gordon, it is interested in expanding into
the Irish market.
''We are now looking at Ireland,'' he told the media in Dublin
yesterday, ''and this new licence is the most likely option.
The closing date for licence applications is November and the
commission hopes to have the station on the air ''as soon as possible
next year''.
Scottish Radio Holdings, which has a market value of #77m, has already
expanded into the north of England with a 40% share holding in Radio
Carlisle.

WEST Indies Test batsman Jimmy Adams yesterday suffered a cracked
cheekbone and may need surgery to repair the damage.
He was taken to hospital after having been struck by a short-pitched
ball from Somerset pace-bowler Andre van Troost during the tourists'
game at Taunton.
In the county championship, Middlesex stepped up their bid to put
pressure on pacesetters Warwickshire with a fine batting display on the
opening day of their clash with Nottinghamshire at Lord's -- and then
saw Northamptonshire beat them to top spot.
Northamptonshire controlled their home match against Durham, with Anil
Kumble taking five for 26 as the home side claimed four bowling bonus
points by skittling Durham for 148. Scores:

HIGHLAND Distilleries surprised the whisky industry yesterday when it
bought the Black Bottle brand and stocks from Allied Domecq for #12.8m
cash. But the deal seemed sensible because it gives Highland a second
premium Scotch to back up the core Famous Grouse brand. Black Bottle has
a strong presence in the Scottish market, ranking number three to the
Famous Grouse's number one.
It was first blended by Aberdeen tea merchant Gordon Graham in 1879
and still retains the local connection. It also does well in Caithness
and Sutherland and in the South-west of Scotland.
It has annual sales of 70,000 cases of 12 bottles and it is Highland's
strategy to continue building the brand in Britain and overseas where
the Remy Cointreau associate has expressed interest, partly attracted by
the unique packaging, which offers something different to the usual
international Scotch bottle. Black Bottle retails at about 25p below
Famous Grouse.
Highland's chief executive Brian Ivory said the deal would be earnings
neutral this year and was being financed out of cash flow.
The market perception is the Famous Grouse is ''more up-market
Scottish rural'' while Black Bottle is '' more unconventional, slightly
irreverent and younger.'' Its marketing last year was a tattoo on a
girl's back and the caption ''Edinburgh Tattoo.''
The brand was once part of the Seager Evans stable which dates back to
1805 and which included Long John, the Islay-produced Laphroaig and
Speyside's Tormore. These were sold by Whitbread in 1989 as part of a
package.
Allied Domecq is in the middle of a major reorganisation to focus on
its core activities.

THE Tennents West Highland Yachting Week armada made a speedy return
from Tobermory to Oban yesterday, spurred on by a modest westerly breeze
which faded just enough at the finish to make it far from plain sailing.
The race committee recognised that the dying wind would have made the
final hop from Lismore Island to Oban just too much, and the finish was
laid about a mile after the island.
It was a race in which the alert crews spent as much time looking
astern as ahead, for in the following wind there were gains to be made
chasing the stronger gusts as they swept down either shore on the Sound
of Mull.
Douglas Watson, steering his family's Sigma 33, Rupert, made a perfect
start and had not only yesterday's race but the Sigma 33 class overall
in the bag until they stayed too far towards the Lismore point where the
breeze was more gentle.
Trying to protect the lead from John and Hilary Connelly's Phoenix,
they let Donald McLaren, in Sigmatic, outflank them on the opposite
Duart shore. Sigmatic won with Phoenix second. Results:
Class 1 -- 1, Mr Green (S Goodlet) 2hr 26min.13sec; 2, Mr Pink (N
Kirk) 2-27.52; 3, Tunnock's Teacake (C Owen) 2-31.07. Overall leader --
Teacake.
Class 2 -- 1, Vigil (A Harvey) 2-32.6; 2, Starlet (A Murray) 2-36.36;
3, Chameleon (J Mactaggart) 2-37.24. Overall -- Vigil.
Class 3 -- 1, Sigmatic (D McLaren) 2-36.52; 2, Phoenix (J and H
Connelly) 2-36.56; 3, Rupert (D Watson) 2-37.20. Overall -- Phoenix.
Class 4 -- 1, Revolver (R Perry) 2-30.59; 2, Cavalier (B Cochrane)
2-31.36; 3, Itch (M Maiden) 2-37.15. Overall -- Cavalier.
Class 5 -- 1, Scintilla (M Austin) 2-34.59; 2, Diana (J and F Hunt)
2-35.39; 3, Good Krack (D Marshall) 2-36.51. Overall -- Diana.
Class 6 -- 1, Rowan (A Ure) 2-31.44; 2, Egret (P Cheyne) 2-33.19; 3,
Phendra (F Campbell) 2-33.21. Overall -- Phendra.
Class 7 -- 1, Mezzanine of Down (R Clegg) 3-02.53; 2, Kelana of
Clynder (H Arbuthnott) 3-07.11; 3, Rebel (D Smith) 3-07.17. Overall --
Mezzanine.
Class 8 -- 1, Crunluath (W Marshall) 2-48.57; 2, Mist of Malin (K
Beaumont) 2-56.40; 3, Diva (C Greenstead) 3.05.29. Overall -- Crunluath.

INDUSTRY action to reduce fraud is contributing to lower claims on
insurers, Guardian Royal Exchange said yesterday when it reported higher
UK trading profits despite a 12% fall in premium income.
John Sinclair, who heads the UK side, said that motor and household
theft claims frequency and cost had declined in the first half of 1995.
This he attributed partly to the success of the industry's initiative to
maintain a database on claims, so that frequent and possibly fraudulent
claimants could be identified.
In addition, databases on stolen MoT certificates and information on
car write-offs had helped on the motor side.
The ending of the recession had also helped reduce theft and arson,
reflected in lower fire claims. Motor accident claims frequency was also
some 10% lower, though the reasons for this are unclear. The reductions
enabled UK trading profits to rise 7% despite lower premiums.
Group first-half profits were 37% ahead at #179m before investment
gains, with most growth coming from overseas operations, with all
regions except Asia moving profits ahead
Mr Sinclair reckons the decline in UK premiums may be bottoming out,
though competition remains strong. Motor rates may slip a further 1% to
2% but should be rising again by the fourth quarter. Household policies
could fall by a further 5% before recovering.
Guardian is the first of the composite insurers to report first half
results, and its experience is an encouraging pointer to the others. Its
shares gained 6p to 224p, helped by the 9% increase in the interim
dividend to 3.1p.
The group maintains that its direct selling operation, Guardian, is
meeting its targets, with 68,000 policies at present -- more than double
the figure a year ago. Losses in what is still the start-up phase came
to #8m.
The group's new health insurance operation is not receiving as many
calls as hoped, but more initial calls are turning into definite sales
than expected.
In common with the industry, the UK life business was depressed, with
new annual premiums down 37%, though single premiums for pensions were
ahead. Worldwide life operating profits were down #3m at #10m.

EDINBURGH'S Steve Paulding won the open 1000 metres sprint title when
he beat England's Neil Potter in two straight rides in the final at the
British Cycling Federation national track championships in Manchester
last night.
Craig Percival, who had been fastest of the qualifiers, beat
Paulding's team-mate Anthony Stirrat for the bronze, also 2-0.
Jon Clay won the open 40km points race when he defeated Bryan Steel.
The pair were tied on points at the end of the 160-lap race but Clay
took the title by having won three sprints to Steel's two. Edinburgh's
Anthony Stirrat was just one point behind in third place.
These three were among six riders who lapped the field, leaving Simon
Littlestone, the winner for the past six years, trailing.

JENNIFER Duncan opened her bid for a first women's singles title at
the Bank of Scotland Scottish Hard Court Tennis Championships in Dundee
with a 6-3, 7-5 victory over Nicola Burns at Games Club yesterday, then
announced her full-time tennis career was at a crossroads, writes Judy
Murray.
The 19-year-old from Dundee reached the last 16 at the British
National championships last November and her efforts bore fruit three
months ago when she earned her first world ranking after a successful
Satellite Circuit in South America.
Duncan's aggressive base-line game is best suited to clay courts and
would benefit from an intensive competitive season on the European
circuit. But according to the Scottish No.4, that is financially out of
the question.
She said: ''The costs of travelling and competing in Europe would be
enormous. What I really need now is a sponsor for a place in one of the
LTA's national squads.''
Duncan now awaits the winner between former internationalists Allison
Wood and Heather Lockhart.
Fifteen-year-old Gary Smith continued his giant-killing run in the
men's singles when he claimed the scalp of Scottish No.10 Ronnie Terras.

THE harsh remedial action taken earlier this year when it sold off the
loss-making Alternative International employment consultancy has left
Scottish Television free to concentrate on what it does best and better
than many of its peer group.
As a result, half-time pre-tax profits jumped from a depressed #1.67m
to #7.41m and with the full-year total likely to emerge at perhaps a
touch over #18m (#2m). But next year should be much better.
The interim dividend has been raised 77% to 4p.
Part of the improvement has come from the continuing benefits from
cost reduction which has resulted in a core staff of just 350 people
with short-term contracts for additional staff to cover the production
peaks in programme making.
Chief executive Gus Macdonald said that this process had been helped
by the increasing usage of lightweight equipment. He added that in
recent years, the company had spent about #15m on redundancy.
Although there is increasing co-operation with David Montgomery's
Mirror Group, such as cable coverage of the Edinburgh Festival from the
Gateway Theatre through Live TV, the question of the 20% shareholder
having board representation is on the back burner until later in the
year.
The holding was acquired at 520p compared with the current 464p, up
11p on the day.
Turnover from the continuing broadcasting, programme-making and now
sponsorship declined 12% to #47.3m partly reflecting reduced sales by
Scottish Television Enterprises (STE) to the UK national network. But
this tends to be lumpy business with programmes such as Doctor Finlay
which are being made at present running up production costs but not
generating revenue until transmission next year.
STE made minimal profits in the half-year but prospects for later this
year and 1996 are good with revenue benefiting from October from the new
series of Taggart, while the children's television is good
bread-and-butter income in a sector were STV has established a
significant market position.
However, the company faces a problem in that while its market share in
audience figures continues to outperform the ITV network, there has been
a decline since the calendar year-end from 40.6% to 38.4% with viewers
turning to Channel 4 and the BBC channels.
Encouragingly, the Central Scotland franchise area has the
second-lowest penetration of cable and satellite viewing in the UK at
just 18.3% compared with the UK average of 24.2%. But the ITV network
does face a problem in raising figures with companies such as Carlton
not pulling their weight.
Happily, GMTV is now turning into profit and will start re-paying
shareholder loans this autumn with Scottish to receive an initial
#800,000 out of #4m originally lent.
STV advertising revenue has been fairly flat because of the
combination of the absence from the screens of the Scottish Office and
the Royal Bank. Local sales overall are down 13% offset by better UK
derived revenue including that from Unilever.
However, margins are being helped by sponsorship which amounted to #1m
and which drops completely through to the bottom line as there are no
production costs. The programmes involved include The Home Show which is
sponsored by the Herald with other participants, including Scottish
Enterprise, Unilever and Bell's whisky.
* THE 20%-owned Coutts Consulting Group which bought Alternative
International in exchange for a 20% equity stake given to Scottish
Television increased half-time profits from #341,000 to #716,000. Its
interim dividend was raised 50% to 0.6p.

Ross Finlay takes Citroen's ZX Aura on a journey to Geneva
CITROEN has a tendency to swop around its individual model names and
specifications, because its marketing people either keep right on their
toes when reacting to changing customer preferences, or like to cause a
bit of mischief by working a kind of find-the-lady trick in the
catalogues. When I took over a Citroen ZX recently, it was a 1.4-litre
five-door Aura model, which promptly slipped off the availability list.
However, the Aura still comes as a 1.8-litre petrol model, and with
1.9-litre diesel or turbo diesel option, while the 1.4-litre engine is
still fitted to all the other ZX model ranges. So the essential details
of the test car remain current.
Although this number may change from month to month, there are
something like 30 different ZX models on sale -- three-door and
five-door hatchbacks, and also a range of estates. As far as five-doors
like the test car are concerned, the main models are the Reflex and the
better-specified Avantage. But there are also two special edition
models, subject to availability, called the Elation and the Dimension.
Prices for the 1.4-litre five-door ZX start at #9995 for the
limited-edition Elation, rise to #10,030 for the Reflex model which is
available all year round, and top out at #11,380 for the Avantage. The
engine, actually of 1360cc, pushes out 75bhp, which is enough to take
the car to 60mph in 11 seconds and on to a test track maximum around
107mph. In steady-speed fuel consumption tests, this smallest-engined ZX
will manage around 52mpg at 56mph, and 39 at 75, compared with 33mpg on
the urban cycle.
Starting off on a 1200-mile round trip from London to Geneva, I
thought the ZX offered passenger and luggage space which was fine for
its class, had a rather gloomily coloured but well laid out fascia,
complete with the open picnic tray which is so cluttered up in the
Xantia, and the usual Citroen mix of switchgear styles. There was plenty
of storage space for the odds, ends, maps and paperwork needed on a
journey through foreign territory.
Most of the early mileage was on motorways, where the ZX cruised
easily, showing 3400rpm at an indicated 70mph, although stepping up the
pace on the higher-limit French autoroutes. At first I thought the
steering wheel, which had no height adjustment, was too high for my
taste. However, with the driver's seat set as I like it, the rim of the
wheel came just under the windscreen bottom line, which turned out to be
fine. The front seats do not look very supportive, but this was one of
the few recent long journeys I have made in this size of car where no
back twinges made themselves felt.
A turn to the east at Dijon, along a motorway past Dole which did not
appear on any of my maps, not only opened up the lip-smacking
possibility of going to a map shop and stocking up with current
editions, but also led, after a while, into much more sporting roads
through the Jura mountains. Driving to Geneva, you have the choice of
two sides of a triangle on autoroutes, or one side on ordinary, fairly
quiet but eventually twisty main roads, and I do not think there is much
to choose, in time taken, between the two possibilities.
As any ordinary 1400 would, the ZX tended to fade a bit in high gears
on the longer climbs, but it kept charging along when I went down the
box, via a quick but not very sporting change. During one heavy rain
shower, I revived my dislike, especially on the fast setting, of the
ZX's single front wiper.
Wet or dry, the mountain roads showed the car at its best. It handles
remarkably well by the standards of its class, precise and unexpectedly
sporting, with a certain amount of built-in rear wheel steer to help it
sweep through corners without upsetting its balance. As well as having
the supple suspension which helps most French cars to deal confidently
with lumpy surfaces, the ZX is generally nimble and agile. I was
particularly aware of this during a chase across the mountains in
company with a couple of other cars, as the one immediately ahead of me
found that when the French put up a 45kph maximum speed sign in advance
of an individual corner, they -- unlike the American authorities in
similar circumstances -- really mean it.

ENGINEERING and aerospace group TI saw increasing worldwide demand for
products with aerospace outperforming a generally flat market for
original equipment while sales of spares maintained the more positive
trend seen late last year.
The group, based at Abingdon in Oxfordshire, revealed 25% higher
pre-tax profits for the six months to June of #87.4m.
Shareholders are to receive a 7% higher interim dividend payout of
4.35p.
Its aerospace business outperformed a generally flat market for
original equipment, while sales of spares maintained the more positive
trend seen late last year.
In other areas, Continental Europe was a particularly good market in
terms of demand for its engineering products.
The group said Messier-Dowty, TI's leading landing gear joint venture
with Snecma, sprung into life in January, since when it has lived up to
expectations.
Chairman Sir Christopher Lewinton expressed his confidence of the
months ahead. He said that order books are up, which, coupled with a
balanced geographic and industry spread and an experienced management
team, continues to give confidence in the group's ability to sustain
growth and increase shareholder value.

* DESPITE cold water poured on extended warranties by consumer
watchdogs, many people sleep better knowing they've got one. Certainly,
the five-year ultimate package offered at a Scots Sony Centre seemed
cast-iron to a reader, with its assurance of complete cover and total
peace of mind for his new video recorder.
A couple of months after stumping up the #132 premium came a policy
document. Surprisingly, it contained ''exceptions''. One was about the
new-for-old commitment which had influenced the decision to insure:
Sony's leaflet promised ''If your product is found to be beyond economic
repair . . . we will simply pay the replacement cost.''
But, in plain English, their insurers were saying that if a spare part
couldn't be obtained they would not be liable and there would only be a
refund on the premium.
Check-out asked Sony if this conferred the complete peace of mind the
customer understood he had bought. They denied the leaflet was
misleading, but did say it is being revised. The exception clause was
one commonly used by insurers. But as Sony guarantees five years' supply
of spares -- and can even go back 20 years -- their 20,000 purchasers of
extended cover shouldn't worry.
Other manufacturers may not be willing to give such a firm
undertaking, and it's sensible to check for small print exceptions if
you're offered extended warranties.
* TOP marks to Citroen for warning anyone who takes up its weekend
breaks offer to check the terms and conditions carefully. It's sound
advice.
Free hotel accommodation in the UK and Europe doesn't mean free meals
and a furtive trip to the cafe round the corner won't do: under the
offer, you and your partner must buy breakfast and dinner -- some hotels
even stipulate a minimum quantity of drinks, as well.
While there are some good bargains, those skimping over the conditions
could get more than they bargained for -- like a #261 bill for three
days' obligatory meals at a Scots hotel.
* YOU may be able to read a number plate at the required distance, but
does the small print on a car contract present too great a challenge? If
you're changing to an N-reg car, but won't take delivery until after
September 1, better get your magnifying glass out, warns Which?
magazine.
They cite the case of a motorist who last year ordered a new car in
July, but on collecting it, as agreed two months later, was asked for
another #500 because of a price rise. When he complained, the dealer
flourished the small print.
It's common practice for garages to pass on increases that come into
force before the actual date of delivery. Advice: strike out any clause
in the contract that allows for this, but make sure the dealer agrees.
* I SAY, you chaps . . . these weight-watcher types have latched on to
a potentially huge market by identifying fat owls as targets for
playground bullies -- and now they want to remove our sticky buns and
chocolate bars.
The Bunter brigade face a sad, overweight childhood, developing into a
fat miserable adulthood, according to Slimmer Magazine. But it warns
parents not to put children on a diet, or cook separate meals.
Instead, aim to moderate and vary portions, while discouraging friends
from making politically incorrect comments like ''How are you, fatso?''
Walking or cycling to school should also be encouraged instead of
squeezing into the back of the car.
Slimming Magazine has launched a special hotline offering tailor-made
advice. It's open for calls between 9am and 1pm on Mondays till
September 25, on 01923 245514.
* IN THE metric version, Shylock will have to demand a shade under 500
grams of flesh. But while grams and kilograms may make sense to
merchants, they're set to baffle the many used to calling a pound a
pound.
Recognising this, Somerfield have made metrication easy (they claim)
with a quick-conversion leaflet. And, they promise, the pound in your
pocket won't be worth less with the incoming EU regulations for
labelling pre-packed goods.
As a rule of thumb the price per kg is just more than double that per
pound (1kg = 2.2 pounds). Leaflets detailing the changes are free at
Somerfield check-outs.

WHAT is the connection between Solihull, Reigate, Grantham, and Perth?
The unlikely answer is revolution in the supermarket. They are the only
places in Britain where customers can by-pass the check-out queue by
scanning the bar codes as they put each item into the trolley.
It is a mid-week morning and the housewives and retired people have
been augmented by children on holiday. Here, though, there is no casual
tossing of packets into trolleys. The concentration is tangible, broken
only by a discreet bleep as the laser hits the bar code.
Safeway, third player in the UK supermarket stakes behind Tesco and
Sainsbury, started the self-scanning experiment in Solihull six months
ago as an offensive against the chief grudge of the supermarket shopper,
queuing at the check-out.
The theory is that equipped with a handset shaped like a small
telephone, the customer whizzes round, clicking individual items into a
computerised tally, and then sails through the check-out, stopping only
to pay the amount totalled by the machine.
While self-scan gives self-service a whole new meaning, it is not,
insists Perth store manager Iain Dodds, in the sense of help yourself.
The first hurdle for would-be thieves is that the sanners are available
only to loyal Safeway customers who have given the Argyll Group their
names, addresses, and access to their supermarket spending habits in
exchange for a #1 discount for every 100 points they accumulate.
The official line from Dodds and the Safeway head office is: ''These
are our regular customers and we trust them.'' In effect there is a
sophisticated system of random checks.
For the first three times they use the self-scan system, everyone's
trolley-load is re-scanned at the check-out. If their ''accuracy
record'' is good, after that they will probably be able to pay the
self-scan tally without having to unload their trolley. The crunch is
that there are no guarantees and anyone, however regularly accurate, can
be stopped at the behest of the central computer when their card number
is punched into the till.
When the system is fully operational it is likely to be one in 10
visits or fewer.
Obvious to everyone who limits supermarket visits to as few as
possible -- and therefore has megaloads -- is that unloading a trolley
and repacking it with carrier bags is more time-consuming than the
price-scanning. The most attractive feature of Safeway's new scheme is
that everything is put into rigid plastic boxes -- specially-designed
trolleys hold three -- and shoppers transfer the boxes to their cars
without the need for intermediary plastic bags.
The idea is that customers buy the boxes (99p each) and reuse them on
every supermarket visit. It is an environmental plus. But, like the
card, it also helps to boost customer loyalty which is what the sharp
end of marketing is all about.
After a week the shop-floor reaction in Perth was mixed. Anne Dodds,
using the scanner for the third time, was enthusiastic, but admitted to
a constant fear of absent-mindedly popping something straight into her
trolley without scanning it.
Ian Carswell, also a regular Safeway shopper, said he had found
himself with five items on his scanner but only three in his trolley.
''I had clicked them twice, which is very easy to do,'' he said.
Nevertheless, he was gamely trying it out again: ''I don't know that it
will make shopping any faster. What it does is let you know how much you
are spending as you go round, instead of getting a shock when you reach
the till.
''Most of the people who will use it will not worry too much about the
price. The little old lady it was probably designed for, will never use
it at all.''
Older people, however, were giving it a go. Lilian Greig, scanning her
way round the shop for the second time, pronounced the system much
slower than normal. ''Last time I had my 18-year-old grandson to help
me, but I suppose I'll get used to it,'' she said.
Lady Sarah Walter also hoped that practice would make perfect. With 12
identical bottles of tonic water, she had lost count halfway through of
how many she had zapped and was rather sceptical of the system's
time-saving properties.
Kids love it, of course. Mine put it to the test with enthusiasm,
battling over whose turn it was to scan rather than push the trolley,
but none of us was able to record a price for a bag of onions. Clearly
we were not alone. First question when we got to the check-out was:
''Have you got any problem items?''
Safeway's spokeswoman, Wendy Gerbert, said: ''It is intended for busy
people: workers shopping on their way home or at lunch-time and mothers
with small children who don't want to stand in queues. It is just an
extra option for people who want to go in and out quickly.''
She says that in Solihull it is used by a cross-section of customers
and the success of that trial had led to further experimentation in
Perth, Reigate, and Grantham -- stores chosen to give a geographical
spread.
For those who prefer someone else to hunt for the bar codes, or who
don't want to give their personal details to a supermarket chain, or
just want to chat up the girl at the check-out, there will always be
another queue.
The company insists that check-out operators need not fear being made
redundant by new technology. ''It will allow us to use more staff on the
floor to help customers and answer their questions,'' she added.
Now a self-scanner which could be run over employment statistics, give
the cost of each employee, and provide a running total, would be a very
useful and popular bit of technology.

TARMAC'S decision to sell its housebuilding business is the most
dramatic move in its long retrenchment from the heady days when the
company appeared to be carrying all before it in the boom years of the
Thatcher era.
In those distant days it was the nation's largest housebuilder,
selling 12,000 units a year, and appeared to enjoy a close relationship
with the Tory Government. Indeed it was tagged the Government's
favourite builder owing to the number of contracts it seemed to win for
roads and other state projects.
One commentator described Tarmac in its heyday as ''very big, very
rich and a pillar of the British establishment,'' a description which
its then head Sir Eric Pountain would heartily have agreed.
The subsequent decline was caused not only by the 1990s recession but
the management's failure to see the recession coming and underestimating
its depth. This might have been difficult to predict but even when the
writing was on the wall Tarmac was still in its 1980s mindset of rapid
expansion.
The financial reckoning came in 1990 when profits crashed from #377m
to #191m. It was confirmed as the slide continued the following year,
when profits amounted to just #21m after provisions to cover a fall in
land values and the cost of the inevitable rationalisation which was by
then under way. The final dividend was slashed, with reducing borrowings
the priority.
However, Tarmac's support for the Tories did not falter even though
Government mistakes had exacerbated the depth of the housing recession.
The annual contribution to the Tory party rose steadily, reaching a peak
of #55,000 in 1991 but was later cut to #25,000. By last year it had
dropped to #15,000.
Changes at the top were inevitable and Neville Simms, who headed the
construction division, was promoted to group chief executive at the
beginning of 1992. Sir Eric, who had been chairman and chief executive
through the 1980s expansion, hung on as executive chairman until early
last year.
By that time the empire he had built up had been considerably slimmed
down, with thousands of jobs gone, bitumen, brick and concrete block
factories closed, five Scottish quarries sold and housebuilding
operations reduced in size. Some #400m was eventually realised through
disposals.
Tarmac's nadir came in its 1992 results which showed losses of #350m,
as rationalisation costs struck home. This meant that the group had
climbed from profits of #26m to almost #400m in the 1980s only to swing
back to report the largest ever loss from a UK building firm, though
profits were back over #100m last year.
The construction division managed to maintain its workload, helped by
continuing road contracts, but at very low margins. Also in 1992, Tarmac
ran into controversy when it was paid #55m to take over the projects
division of the state-owned Property Services Agency in a deal which the
then Environment Minister John Redwood said was the best the Government
could get.
As the latest decision shows, the restructuring of the group is not
yet over. The proposed wholesale withdrawal from what was the core
business surprised commentators who wondered how Tarmac would replace
the lost income.
Mr Simms intends to concentrate on aggregates and concrete products,
international contracting services, and participation in private
sector-funded infrastructure projects in the UK. But given the mistakes
of the past there is some scepticism over whether Tarmac will spend the
proceeds of its housing sale wisely.

ZENECA is confident that it can continue to prosper as an independent
pharmaceutical company despite the takeover activity occurring
throughout the industry worldwide.
The drugs industry has been consolidating for two years, with deals
worth more than #38bn in Europe and the US. Zeneca itself completed the
acquisition in April of 50% of the US company Salick Health Care, which
specialises in cancer treatment and kidney dialysis.
The key to future profitable growth for all drugs companies lies in
the research and development of novel compounds that address currently
unmet medical needs. More than two-thirds of the world's diseases remain
incurable and new disorders continue to emerge.
That is why, if you look into the R&amp;D pipeline of most of the major
drug companies, you will find prospective treatments for various forms
of mental illness such as schizophrenia, cancer, AIDS and diabetes.
However, on average, only one in every 10,000 compounds screened by
pharmaceutical companies will ever reach the market as a new medicine.
Most are discarded because they fail to meet stringent safety testing or
because they do not combat the target illness effectively.
Zeneca's confidence in its own prospects rests largely on its
extensive R&amp;D pipeline, which is focused on six therapeutic areas:
cancer, cardiovascular, infection, arthritis, respiratory and the
central nervous system.
Compounds which are currently in regulatory development include an
antibiotic, therapies for breast and prostate cancer, an anti-asthma
compound and a treatment for schizophrenia.
Zeneca's chief executive, David Barnes, said the group now had the
exciting challenge ''of transforming new product progress into
outstanding commercial success''.
Some of its newer products on the market are already making their
presence felt. Zestril, an inhibitor of an enzyme associated with high
blood pressure and heart disease, saw its sales grow by 12% worldwide in
the first half of the current financial year.
The cancer treatment Zoladex showed sales growth in excess of 30%,
whilst Diprivan, the world's biggest selling intravenous anaesthetic,
recorded a 20% sales increase in the first half. The strong growth in
Zoladex helped to offset the 12% decline in its older heart drug,
Tenormin.
These helped to keep pharmaceuticals as the main profit earner in the
group, contributing profits of #343m on 7% higher sales. The group's
interim profits rose by 44% to #506m pre-tax, in line with City
expectations. Overall group sales were 6% ahead at #2530m.
The interim dividend was raised by 4.6% to 11.25p. Gearing at the end
of the half-year was just 12.5%.
Zeneca's non-pharmaceutical businesses account for 59% of sales but
only 34% of trading profits. Within the agrochemicals business, sales
increased by 13% and profits, which were depressed by a poor Seeds
performance, rose by 13%. On a like-for-like basis at constant exchange
rates, operating profit grew by 17%.
The division took advantage of buoyant European markets to launch new
products and new applications of existing products. On the downside,
seed sales were disappointing, down 3%, with acreage in US corn down 9%
as a result of prolonged rainfall in the mid-West.
The specialities business reported unchanged profits, although at
constant exchange rates profits were 10% higher. Sales were up 2%.
Within the division, the Coatings business continued to grow but Textile
Colours continued to suffer in difficult markets. Quorn sales doubled,
reflecting the continued success of the advertising campaign and the
launch of the Quorn burger.
Zeneca's shares have been buoyed in recent months by intense bid
speculation, with Swiss group Roche mentioned as a possible suitor. Such
takeover rumours have helped Zeneca to be the fifth best performer in
the FT-SE 100 Index this year.
Zeneca says it has not been in merger talks with anybody, but this has
failed to dampen speculation entirely that something is afoot. However,
with a market capitalisation of around #11bn, higher than the peak
reached by ICI before it demerged the drugs business from the chemicals
side in 1993, any predator would need to have deep pockets.
Yesterday, Zeneca shares were down 22p to 1098p.

THE squeals of pain from the packaging industry as polymer prices soar
are accompanied by throaty grunts of delight from Shell, which saw its
chemicals division turn in profits of #313m in the June quarter to raise
the divisional half-year total from #53m to #551m, writes ANDREW WILSON.
The oil giant did warn yesterday that there were some signs of demand
easing in the second three months, which may result in weaker markets in
the current half.
However, overall group net income jumped 90% to #1281m to bring the
half year figure up from #1610m to #2554m.
Shell was saying little about the consumer reaction in Germany to the
Brent Spar oil rig public relations fiasco, where it failed to put
across the point that there are more contaminants released into the
Rhine by the German chemical industry than were involved in the oil rig.
There was a substantial currency impact this time, accruing from the
weakening of the pound against the Deutschmark in the second quarter,
bringing in a #77m benefit compared with a #78m loss a year earlier
thanks to a depressed dollar.
There was also a #89m profit arising from the sale of the stake in a
Chilean copper mine.
Oil exploration and production was helped by rising crude prices
averaging $18.10m a barrel in the June quarter, up $1.20 over the
preceding three months, and a realised price of $16.05 in 1994.
Shell expects that Brent crude will trade at around $16 for most of
the third quarter.
However, overall refining margins were under pressure in Europe and
the Far East, with Russian supplies a significant factor. Not
surprisingly, gas sales fell because of the warmer weather, and that has
continued.
As usual, the quarterly dividend will be announced on September 14.
The shares fell back 15p to 759p.

THE European Common Agricultural Policy cannot be preserved in aspic
for ever and a day, the Earl of Lindsay, the new Scottish Office
Agriculture Minister, said yesterday.
Speaking at the Black Isle Show, Muir of Ord, Ross-shire, he claimed
that the Scottish Office had a good record in defending Scottish
farmers' interests in the face of change.
The CAP was under pressure from various quarters, including
environmental interests and consumer groups, he said. ''There are also
those who claim the taxpayer is having to put too much into one industry
-- so I do not want any farmer to think the CAP will go on gloriously
into the sunset.
''It is bound to change and we have a role to play to try to steer
that change to the benefit of the Scottish farmer.
''We have to prove you can reform the CAP and still protect the
Scottish farmer, who I believe is better off after the last reform than
he was before it.''
Lord Lindsay emphasised the importance of reminding the wider
community of the role the farmer could play in caring for the
environment. Environment subsidies were likely to be expanded, he
forecast. Farmers should ensure that they were the recipients.
For decades farmers had been allowed to run the countryside, he said,
but in the last 10 years they had gone from being unsung heroes to
villains.
They had to reassert their claim to be the right people to act as
stewards of the land. ''There are a lot of agencies out there who want
to clip the farmers' wings and say: 'You must stop doing certain things
and we will tell you what you can do and what you cannot do'.
''Broadly speaking, the farmer has produced the landscape worth saving
because he knows how to do it. I believe he should be left to continue
doing it. One of the great challenges for the agriculture industry is to
convince people that it should be left in charge of the countryside.''
On the economic front Lord Lindsay said that currently prices and
subsidies were good. However, farmers had to tolerate bad decades.
''Like many other farmers I am still paying off debts from the seventies
and eighties,'' he added.
The show, Scotland's biggest one-day event, attracted a good turnout
in all sections. The main prizewinners were:

Despite her manufactured pop history, David Belcher predicts a warm
Glasgow welcome for singer Kylie Minogue this weekend when the Aussie
'girl-next-door' takes to the stage
WHEN you ponder wee Kylie's forthcoming appearance on the main stage
at this weekend's T In The Park extravaganza, you can't help but think
of wee Sheena's disastrous showing during the Big Day in 1990 on Glasgow
Green. The similarities are inescapable.
Kylie Minogue and Sheena Easton are both glossy, perky papsters formed
by the lens of the camera rather than the slog of the live-rock circuit.
They are manufactured pop confections unused to sharing a bill with
critically-acclaimed musos to whom artistic validity is almost
everything (not that you'd get many of the contrary monkeys to admit
it). Furthermore, after dalliances with musical heavyweights, both Kylie
and Sheena have tried to attain legitimacy through raunchiness.
Stepping off the conveyor-belt of mindless hits written by Messrs
Stock, Aitken, and Waterman, Kylie spent some time as head snoggee to
INXS rocker Michael Hutchence, shortly thereafter abandoning cutie-pie
dresses for more grown-up leather bustiers and artful semi-nude
photo-sessions. Similarly, Prince oozed lubriciously into Sheena's life
for a brief spell, leaving her with a taste for videos in which
smouldering stares and legs-akimbo dance routines loom large.
Five years ago Sheena Easton condescended to return hame to lil' ol'
Scotland from luxurious exile in Los Angeles only to be greeted by
100,000 punters booing, jeering, and aiming the odd bottle stage-wards.
So when Kylie steps out tomorrow in front of a predicted 40,000
music-lovers in Strathclyde Park, is there a danger she'll face a repeat
of the Sheena shocker?
Almost certainly not. Because hey, we post-modern hep-cats can shake a
leg to Kylie's vibe even as we're sneering at it.
Step forward, Duglas Stewart, pop camp-commandant, and explain the
Kylie conundrum. Duglas should know, you see. For Duglas sang Kylie's
Got A Crush On Us when his band, the BMX Bandits, covered the
Clydesmen's ironic near-miss last year. Is it OK to like Kylie and not
like Kylie at the same time?
Duglas raises a thumb aloft. Why? Because, feels Duglas, you can't
help it, which is one of the pop process's neatest tricks.
''Initially, compared to most female pop stars, Kylie was attractive
because she seemed more attainable, more like that old cliche, the
girl-next-door,'' says Duglas. ''It might sound corny in the light of us
all having seen her so often on TV in Neighbours, but you felt as though
you did know her . . . as though you could have gone to school with her.
She did look like an ordinary girl who'd simply stood up to do a karaoke
version of The Locomotion at a church fete.
''Then, when Kylie got more glamorous and sophisticated and overtly
sexual, that was an extra thrill because she'd appeared to be a real
person in a way that someone like Madonna never has been. That's why
Kylie's a much more interesting pop icon than Madonna. You could never
imagine Madonna being a regular woman and making herself a bit of toast
at home . . . her pointy bras are something that have always kept you at
a distance.
''So when Kylie suddenly started hopping about in sassy, skimpy
outfits, it was like seeing the girl you've seen every morning for years
at the bus stop . . . like discovering your tomboy pal wearing lipstick
for the first time. Our Charlene, the aspirant mechanic, half undressed!
It was very arousing . . . in the most innocent way possible in my own
case, I must stress.
''That's partly why Kylie's lasted for a long time in chart-pop terms.
That and the fact that her records have always been better than those of
her erstwhile contemporary, Jason Donovan.
''Speaking personally, though, I have a terrible fear that the more
sophisticated Kylie gets, the more she wants to be viewed as A Serious
Artist, the less valid her music becomes. What do I mean by that? Well,
I feel that most of the charm of the records by groups like the
Shangri-Las emanates from their dumbness.
''So I've a message for Kylie, and it's 'Stay Kylie, Kylie'.''
Or to put it another way, keep shopping at What Every Kylie Wants,
Kylie, rather than at Madame Madonna's Maison de Pervy.
Actually, instead of actively embracing Kylie, most folk seem not to
mind her. Yet there are those whose devotion runs deep. In common with
another female product of the Stock-Aitken-Waterman hit factory,
Bananarama, Kylie Minogue has a substantial gay male following.
Yet is Kylie a fully-fledged gay icon? Not strictly speaking,
according to Dominic D'Angelo, editor of Gay Scotland monthly magazine.
''She's not a gay icon in the old-style sense of being a tragic
survivor and sobbing drama queen in the way that Judy Garland is. It's
simply that the style of her music appeals to a lot of young gay men.
Just like the rest of the housey-garage dance music that gay men enjoy
in clubs, Kylie's records are happy, boppy, flaunty, and carefree with a
certain amount of campery going on within them.
''But equally, a lot of gay men see Kylie as A Good Thing, with
capital letters, because she has happily continued appearing at gay
events like Gay Pride as well as at Aids benefits. She has no worries
about being seen to be openly supportive of gay issues. At the same
time, it's not something she has exploited.''
D'Angelo contrasts Kylie's matter-of-fact pro-gay approach with that
of East 17 and Take That. ''Take That were happy to play in gay clubs
when they were unknowns, but now they're famous, they don't. East 17 did
Pride, but then in interviews afterwards they recanted on all the gay
political issues which are raised by Pride . . . 'Oh no, we're not sure
that we do actually support the lowering of the age of consent . . .'
''And in the wake of that they became involved in writing a long
series of letters of apology to the gay press: 'When we said what we
said, we didn't really know what we thought.'
''Kylie and her sister, Dannii, support gay events without worrying
about how some people, or the press, might interpret that support with
regard to Kylie and Dannii's own sexuality. Indeed, I'm sure that there
could be people in the Minogues's management camps who view the pair's
involvement in gay events as bad for their careers . . . as though it
might make Dannii and Kylie less appealing to 15-year-old heterosexual
males, which I don't think has been the case at all.''
In other words, whatever else we might want our pop stars to be, we
want them to be true to themselves. Hoity-toity Sheena? Naw.
Extraordinarily ordinary Kylie? Aye, awright.
Or maybe the tone of Kylie's musical career was set right at the
start, with her first big hit, I Should Be So Lucky. In the course of
the song's three minutes, one word is repeated 54 times.
What's the word for Kylie? Lucky.

TIME WAS you knew Christmas was over when you spotted the first of the
anorak and sleeping-bag brigade camped outside the local department
store -- you knew the January sales were upon us. And they came but once
a year.
But now such sights are not as common as they were -- for sales are
much more frequent than they used to be. And working on the assumption
that a bargain's only a bargain when it says so, millions of happy and
harassed shoppers will be digging deep into bedazzling but bottomless
credit cards this year.
Lured into the mecca of a seductive shop foyer, their spending isn't
seasonal. It happens all year round with a perpetual whirlwind of
wayside pulpits, neon boards, and slogan-spattered signs shouting buy
today, before tomorrow, before the end is nigh.
As a trend, the growth of the sales is official, acknowledged by
retailers, shoppers, and marketing staff alike. According to Eleanor
Shaw, 25, avid shopper and lecturer in marketing at the University of
Glasgow Business School, the bargaining can be traced to our American
cousins.
She says: ''One of the first shops in Glasgow to have continuous sales
was the Gap clothing store, largely due to the US influence -- they are
so far ahead of us in terms of consumer society with tempting discounts
and sales promotions everywhere.''
Insiders from the clothing chain explain the all-year-round sales
tactic as a by-product of stocking transitional collections. One
spokesperson said: ''Like an increasing number of retailers, we change
collections every six to eight weeks instead of every season, something
which enables us to reduce our goods all year round.''
While it is clear that the sudden rise in discounting is influenced by
overseas markets, the curious are forced to ask for the reasons behind
this developing trend. Why, then, have retailers been forced into a
ceremonious dropping of prices?
Until now, most traders blamed bad weather predictions as having a
dramatically damning effect on sales shopping. With the beginning of
each new season, the retailer hopes to have appropriate changes in
climate to act as a catalyst for sales. When this doesn't happen, sales
suffer, and stores are forced to slash prices.
Although she admits that the climate plays an active role in selling,
Shaw believes retailers are becoming increasingly competitive as
customers become extra competitive.
''Customers have more money, education and awareness of what to buy
than ever before. Stores have put increased effort into shop designs,
displays, and sales promotion to meet these requirements.''
Hugh Clark, trading policy director of the British Retail Consortium
in London, agrees but perceives the elevation in consumer's price
awareness has its roots in the recession.
Recent figures from London's Verdict Research show a trend down in the
growth rate of retail sales this year. Sales retail figures for clothing
and footwear during April, May, and June were 3-4% up on last year's
figures while the household goods sector experienced a mere 1% increase.
With a 3% inflation rate, that only accounts for a 1% increase and 2%
decrease in volume respectively.
''The element of bargain-hunting is a recessionary effect which came
with restocking goods in 1991 and 1992,'' said verdict retail analyst
Richard Perks.
If Perks's figures mirror consumer spending as a whole, they dictate
that consumer caution has led to an increase in credit business.''While
consumers are borrowing less than they did in the late eighties, their
desire of value-for-money goods doesn't necessarily mean they want cheap
products. Stores like Marks &amp; Spencer and Next managed to sustain
profits by offering quality at the right price, unlike Burtons which was
so desperate to get sales,'' said Perks.
M &amp; S corporate press officer Della Critchley has strong sentiments
that the current sales onslaught will lead to lack of customer
commitment long term. ''We do not buy inventory at a higher price in
order to reduce it during sales time. We've always expected customers to
be discerning and our good quality and value policy all year round has
stood the test of time. Customer loyalty means we only reduce lines to
make space for new seasonal merchandise.''
For other less traditional traders the sales go on, but Perks and his
followers look upwards and onwards to the heavens praying for a change
in retail practice. ''We will have to wait until the budget honeymoon
period after the elections in 1996-97 before we see a real change in
consumer spending.''

SHANKS &amp; McEwan Group's plans to renew its executive share option
scheme have been thrown into confusion by the tax debacle which followed
the publication of the Greenbury report on directors' pay.
Although Chancellor Kenneth Clarke has now done a U-turn on plans to
tax gains from existing schemes as income instead of capital, at the
point of exercise rather than when the shares are sold, there is some
confusion regarding the position of new schemes.
The Greenbury report timing has been unfortunate for the
Glasgow-registered and Buckinghamshire-based waste management group,
whose previous executive option scheme has just come to the end of its
10-year life.
With some doubt as to whether the new scheme will be approved by the
Inland Revenue, Shanks &amp; McEwan had to amend a motion put to
shareholders at yesterday's annual meeting in Glasgow.
It had originally proposed that implementation of the new scheme would
be ''subject to the approval of the Board of Inland Revenue''.
However, Shanks &amp; McEwan yesterday gained the consent of shareholders
to adopt the scheme, if the board thinks it sensible, as an unapproved
one. Alternatively, it could look at a different way of rewarding
executives.
After the meeting, chairman Gordon Waddell said: ''The advice is that
the Inland Revenue might still approve the scheme, but we don't know, to
be honest.
''What is clear is that, unless the chancellor changes his mind, we
will then be taxed at the date of exercise.''
This would encourage executives to sell the shares they obtain through
the exercise of options immediately, to raise cash to pay the resultant
tax bill.
The position regarding new schemes will probably not become clear
until the 1996 Finance Bill is published. This could also be amended on
its way through Parliament.
Mr Waddell, who does not believe Sir Richard Greenbury is totally
against options, said of the issue: ''It has got confused with a number
of high-profile businessmen, particularly in utilities, making a lot of
money out of stock options.''
Shanks &amp; McEwan's proposed scheme would initially cover 34 people,
rewarding middle and senior management as well as the company's three
senior executives. It has the full support of the Association of British
Insurers.
At yesterday's meeting, retired shareholder Douglas Reid, who worked
in the industrial relations and personnel management field, questioned
the need to have both an executive share option scheme and a bonus
scheme which rewards performance on an annual basis.
He said: ''I think there should be one scheme or the other, not
both.''

THE building industry remains depressed despite signs of economic
growth elsewhere, writes NICOLA REEVES.
On Wednesday, Tarmac announced it was pulling out of housebuilding and
yesterday Wickes, the DIY chain, announced that it, too, was considering
withdrawing from the merchanting side of its business.
This may lead to the sale of most of its Builders Mate business, which
includes 100 general merchant outlets in the UK. Wickes is also looking
at alternative strategies for its remaining Hunter Timber division. This
would leave the group free to concentrate on growing the retail side of
the business.
Wickes continues to prosper in DIY retailing, despite the sluggish
level of activity in the housing market. Wickes and Sainsbury's Homebase
-- two of the smaller DIY chains -- are doing much better than their
larger rivals B &amp; Q and Do-It-All. This is because they have a distinct
selling proposition which sets them apart in the market.
In the six months to June, Wickes increased its pre-tax profit by 3%
to #9m. The interim dividend is raised by 20% to 0.6p. Strong growth in
retail profitability was offset by a #5.5m loss from Hunter Timber, with
its merchanting division, Builders Mate, trading well below
expectations.
Wickes' share of the DIY market in the UK grew by 30% in the period
and by the year-end Wickes predicts that it will be the third largest
DIY retailer. In the first half, its like-for-like sales in the UK grew
by 14% and profits increased by 35%.
The expansion plan continued, with eight stores opened in the first
half and a further nine planned for the second six months.
The prospect of the sale of Builders Mate, which would enhance
earnings per share, could see the shares move up towards 135p compared
with their current price in the market of 120p, up 5p.

BOOKMAKERS Surrey Group has swung from losses of #292,000 into a
profit of #195,000, helped in part by an increase in the number of
betting shops to 58 and increased telephone betting.
Chairman John McNair said the company had, like other bookmakers, been
hit by the National Lottery scratch cards, but like-for-like sales were
ahead 4.4%.
Although Surrey is looking to extend its shop franchise, it is
probable it will try to move into other gambling or leisure sectors.
Again there is no dividend. The shares closed unchanged at 1[3/4]p.
In 1993, it sold its 28 shops in Scotland to Stanley Leisure which is
frequently mentioned as a likely bidder.

* AS far as it is possible to ascertain from the survivors' frontline
memoirs, the original Woodstock festival did not boast a Royal Bank of
Scotland cheque-cashing facility. Neither was it sponsored by a brewery
company. Making no pretence to counter-cultural status, this weekend's
two-day T In The Park is none the worse for having both these features.
Despite T In The Park's corporate links, veteran punk-rock
revolutionary Joe Strummer is reported to be coming along to Strathclyde
Park anyway as a punter. The event's organisers having noted his name on
an application for a tent-pitch, along with that of Chrissie Hynde.
Other big names may well be joining the fray, augmenting the music
created by 67 bands on four stages.
But at least T In The Park shares something in common with Woodstock.
The Royal Bank of Scotland's on-site facility this weekend don't
dispense no dosh via no auto-cash-card magic money machine, man.
Old-time cheque books only. As in 1969.

MOST of the bands at this weekend's T In The Park fall into the
emergent-contender category. So for them, T In The Park is simply one
date on a summer-long series of trans-European festival engagements
designed to alert the wider record-buying public to the existence of
acts who are newer than, say, the Rolling Stones, as well as
considerably better.
For dance-popsters the Shamen, however, T In The Park will act as an
all-important first stage in their comeback following a near three-year
absence from the charts. And if, as Harold Wilson once famously alleged,
a week is a long time in politics, three years is the equivalent of
several decades in popular music.
So after all these aeons, is anyone out there still looking back
fondly upon the Shamen's 1992 chart-topper Ebeneezer Goode? Why has it
taken the Shamen, led by Aberdonian studio-boffin Colin Angus, a
dangerously long time to return to the marketplace?
According to a recent interview in music trade paper Music Week, the
release of the Shamen's forthcoming album, Axis Mutatis, scheduled to
reach the shops on September 11, was delayed for more than a year by
major tensions between the band and Derek Birkett, who runs the Shamen's
label, One Little Indian.
''I wanted to push the pop side, and the band wanted to push the other
side,'' Birkett was quoted as saying, the ''other side'' being what the
Shamen view as their music's more credible, but perhaps less commercial,
underground dance aspect.
Birkett added: ''It's been a compromise. As a band, the Shamen aren't
interested in the commercial exploitation of their work, but to compete
at the level of their last album, Boss Drum, which sold 800,000 copies
in the UK, you have to play the game.'' As a result, Axis Mutatis will
be accompanied by a second underground dance album, Arbor Bona, Arbor
Mala.
''We agreed to do the double album at single cost till Christmas, then
split it up after,'' revealed Birkett. ''The Shamen would have liked it
to have been a double album going out for little more than normal album
cost, but we can't afford to do that on the volume of sales that we
anticipate.''
But how do the band feel a year on from having handed the LP over to
One Little Indian? What's it like being seen by your paymasters as
purveyors of rave-pop to the kiddies when you perceive yourself to be
hip and committed to your art?
The Shamen aren't entirely happy, as was revealed to Music Week. ''We
thought that because this is our third album with this label, they
understood our music,'' said rapper Mr C, otherwise known as Richard
West, or more commonly as The Superior-Looking One With A Wheedling
Voice.
Why the glumness? Well, instead of being greeted by the label with
open arms, Destination Eschaton, the album's first single, which is now
due for release on Monday, earned purse-lipped dismay from One Little
Indian high-ups. They were not convinced about the track's
radio-unfriendly 10-minute length and by what Mr C described as its
experimental feel.
''We presented them with the album, and they didn't give us a chance
to say we had the pop mixes coming. They said it was too underground.
We've had to go and get all these formulaic pop mixes done.
''We had to show them 'Here's the pop mix, here's the seven-inch,
here's the handbag mix, the track for the video, the Beatmasters'
mix'.''
Not that Birkett is unhappy with the Shamen or with their relationship
to his label. ''The deal I did with the Shamen, and most of the other
bands on the label, is that they're completely autonomous. They make
their own records, they deliver the recordings, they do their own
artwork and commission their own videos. I'll tell them what I think,
but 99% of the time they won't listen to me.
''But it's the artists who make record labels, not the record label
that makes the artists. Our job is to make the resources available to
the band. It's tough but it works.''
On this point Mr C concurs. Both the Shamen and Birkett are mightily
pleased with the end-product of their respective hard labours. Mr C felt
certain that Axis Mutatis is ''a big album. The label reckons we've got
three obvious pop songs, and I think we've got five. The pop songs are
more adult contemporary than the last lot which the kiddies could get
into.''
Meanwhile Birkett views the forthcoming LP as two outstanding
entities, one being a techno landmark, the other a solid piece of pop.
''The first album covers the ground of people like the Orb, Future Sound
of London and Orbital, but better. The pop side is significantly better
than acts like the Pet Shop Boys, Erasure and PM Dawn.''
Bold words. They will be under close examination when the Shamen take
to the stage in Strathclyde Park on Sunday afternoon.

DAVID R YULE'S letter requires clarification (July 27). I base my
comments upon police matters entirely upon contemporary information
contained in responsible press reports freely available to every reader.
Each statement has a reliable source and is carefully made within the
restrictions of the law of defamation and copyright.
No statement is deliberately made in vilification of individual police
officers as such but has been raised in the interests of constructive
debate upon a matter of public interest and not one geographically
restricted to Scotland or indeed one particular force.
Such observations that are personally made upon those press reports
can reasonably be dismissed as fair comment.
I write, as is my prerogative, purely as a tax-paying member of the
general public. It would be helpful to learn from Mr Yule his informal
source of information that I have ever served as a police officer or, as
he categorically states, am in receipt of a police pension.
I have never personally met or had contact with Mr Yule.

THIS week every newspaper in the country, broadsheet and tabloid,
serious and tragi-comic, has posed the question: what parent will now
risk letting their children sleep in a tent in the back garden? In the
Guardian, Heather Welford predicted: ''Parents everywhere, and
especially in North Wales, will say a fat 'no' this summer and next.''
In the Daily Telegraph, Elizabeth Grice inquired: ''What sort of fears
will the simple request to pitch a tent in the back garden raise . . .''
In The Herald columnar colleague Ruth Wishart advised: ''Up and down the
country thousands of mothers will take yet another childhood treat off
the menu.''
And so on, in a fever of comment on the weekend deaths of three
children. The enormity of the murders and the media response left me
with two trivial personal problems: would I get any sleep on Tuesday
night when my 11-year-old daughter and her two friends pitched their
tent in our back garden, and would the neighbours think I was either
callously careless of the children's safety or brutally insensitive to
the public mood?
The timing couldn't have been worse. But the sleep-out was planned in
advance of the weekend's events and my husband, who was out of town,
agreed on the phone that ''it would be idiotic'' to cancel it.
Did it matter what the neighbours thought? A little local
embarrassment was a small price to pay for three hours of muffled
giggles and three morning faces bright with delight. As for my
interrupted sleep (yes, it was fitful and yes, I did get up five or six
times to check that all was well) . . . interrupted sleep is the natural
condition of being a parent. Children, like Macbeth, do murder sleep
from their cradle to your grave.
I hope I don't sound either smug or defiant about our decision not to
strike the garden camp. The negative experience of having children is
the unremitting struggle to contain the terrors of the imagination
within the controls of the intellect, but struggle we must; nor am I
unsympathetic to the task of journalists required react to monstrous
events on the backwash of their emotional impact. I've had most of the
week to digest the debate on the ''lost childhood'' of ''an entire
generation'', which makes me less impulsive.
In the Daily Mail, a characteristically agitated column from Mary
Kenny proposed that Britain's population is falling because people are
reluctant to bring children into a ''sinister and immoral'' society. The
strap headline over her piece read: ''Once youngsters played outside and
walked to school. Now, is anywhere safe?''
What a redundant question. Of course nowhere is safe. Parks,
playgrounds, riverbanks, woods, gardens and family kitchens have always
held dangers to harrow the parental imagination. Water drowns, boughs
break, fire burns, berries poison, swings collapse, bikes crash, power
points electrocute, skipping ropes strangle. From the moment they're
born our children die a thousand deaths, but the vast majority of them
live to tell the tale.
When we become parents we launch ourselves on a journey of nightmares
besides which the voyage of Odysseus is but a Disney adventure. If we're
mature, we know we've taken life's greatest risk and exposed ourselves
to the possibility of life's cruellest pain. If we're less prepared we
soon find out that the euphoric advent of ''new life'' brings with it
the fear of death.
The grief of the parents whose children have drowned this week in the
summer heat will be no less than the grief of the parents whose children
were murdered. But it's possible to speculate (I hesitate to read their
emotions) that the concomitant torment of rage and guilt will be less
severe, and less prolonged. There is a universe of dark imaginings
between the devastation of the fatal accident or the terminal illness
and the barbarity of the child murder.
When the Daily Mail asks, ''Is anywhere safe?'' what it means, of
course, is anywhere safe from the prowling psychopath, and the answer to
that must also be no. The prowling psychopath can enter even the
fortified bedroom, and much more commonly does, as a legitimate member
of the family circle. Most newspaper comment has tempered its pessimism
with dutiful reminders that perceptions of stranger-danger are wildly
incompatible with the statistics on child murders, which have remained
more or less constant for 30 years. Less dutifully, they haven't owned
up to their part in inflaming these peceptions.
I'm struck by these two differences between now and then, between the
nineties and the golden fifties, which everyone (everyone being
middle-aged journalists) identifies as the last decade of ''lost
innocence'' and childhood freedom: we didn't have tabloid newspapers,
and we didn't have television, or television as we know it now with the
mixed blessing of the murder hunt press conference and the Crimewatch
appeal. If our parents were less fearful of the prowling psychopath
perhaps it was because they knew less about him.
Yet they knew he existed. As a child in the fifties I remember
warnings about never accepting lifts from strangers in cars.
Stranger-danger seemed to be associated with the motor car, and that has
its own irony: today, children are 30 times more likely to be killed in
road accidents than they are to be murdered by strangers, yet parents
persist in denying them street wisdom by driving them everywhere in
these self-same killers.
I had planned to touch on the parochial nature of our paranoia, which
may have something to do with a sense that we're failing our children in
other ways, and to remind all those who beat their breasts over their
remembered age of innocence that Britain's child of the fifties was
Europe's child of the refugee camps; of the Holocaust survivor.
But these are other ballgames, although they prompt an anecdote. For
all the sunny memories of my own childhood I was born into the middle of
the most hideous war in human history. Years later my mother told me of
her Slough of Despond. When Hitler started bombing London by remote
control she gave way to despair. She had two infant daughters and a
husband overseas in the Eighth Army and she could see no light at the
end of the tunnel. ''Why don't we just surrender?'' she asked her
father, weeping.
''He gave me a terrible row,'' she recalled. ''He said he never wanted
to hear me talking like that again.''
I feel like giving Mary Kenny a terrible row. If people stop having
children because they're frightened to bring them into the world then we
might as well all surrender. ''Did you feel at all scared in the garden
last night?'' I asked my daughter, who has been so preoccupied with her
summer escapades that she seems not to know about Sophie Hook. ''A wee
bit,'' she replied. ''We were telling ghost stories.''
Fortunately, children haven't yet lost the ability to write their own
childhood memoirs.

WE have in front of us a message from the chief constable of Grampian
polis on the subject of crime prevention. It reads: ''The fight against
crime is a vicissitudinous vocation. Like the yo-yo, it has its ups and
downs.
''Housebreaking is certainly a prime example of this. A spate of
break-ins occurring in a particular area. Police inquiries are getting
nowhere fast. No clues left behind. House-to-house inquiries reveal
nothing.
''All of which can be very frustrating when, out of the blue,
information is received which leads to the capture of the thief. A
number of unsolved crimes are suddenly cleared up, and a prison sentence
means a respite for the time being.
''A simplistic story with a happy ending but unfortunately not true to
life. If someone's property, in particular their house, is violated,
amends are not made in full even if the thief is caught or stolen goods
recovered. The victim's trauma remains and can never be fully appeased.
''Grampian Police firmly believe in the axiom that crime prevention is
better than cure. As part of their continuing campaign to curb the
number of break-ins in the region, officers from the community
involvement department have come up with a novel idea to help get the
message across.
''Chubb alarms have donated 400 yo-yos which will be handed out free .
. .''
We do not have space for the rest of the detail of his message but you
must agree that the Grampian top cop Dr Ian Oliver (in fact, he has two
PhDs so he should be doctor, doctor) certainly has a way with words.
Memory loss
THE Diary's old chums at the Collective Gallery, Edinburgh, have come
up with another belter of an exhibition.
It is called Trying to Remember the Colour of Jackie Kennedy's Pillbox
Hat and is, we are told, an investigation by New York artist Spencer
Finch into specific information lost in memory. It says here: ''Finch's
work deals with notions of colour, memory, and perception. His
conceptually based, minimal, seemingly cool presentations are concerned
with seeing and remembering site-specific information.
''His interest in capturing sensations like darkness and his own
vision, reveal a spirit of subtle, poetic romanticism. Although his work
is conceptual, it retains a visual appeal and physical presence.''
Jackie's hat, before you ask, was pink. But, says Mr Finch, was it
''the pink that is on the tip of one's tongue'' or ''the pink of a face
possessed by a sneeze that does not -- or may never -- exist''?
* Yet mair ert: Street Level, the Glasgow photo gallery, has an
exhibition by an American snapper called David Levinthal. It says here:
''Levinthal's pictures reject the idea of capturing reality and instead
construct and reinvent the world in the studio. His photographs are
vivid tableaux, in which toy figures re-enact scenes that draw heavily
on Hollywood's images of mythic America.''
His ''miniature narratives . . . both mimic and dramatise reality''
and take us into a ''haunting fiction combining childhood reverie with
adult nightmare''. Or, judging by the photie on the catalogue cover, he
takes blurry snaps of wee plastic cowboys.
Still hooked
DUE to public demand, we present a postcript to our caption
competition -- the one with Gazza (TM) and the smiling fish. Andy Ewan
has the fish saying: ''One minute I was in Ally Maxwell's hands, the
next I was in the net.'' Gary Grant of Wemyss Bay suggests that if the
fish grabbed Gazza's tackle, it must be called Vinny. Trust you football
fans out there will explain all this to those of a non-soccer
persuasion.
Fingered
OVERHEARD within the portals of Renfrew District Council after Ally
McCoist had been ordered to tear down a garden wall for which he had no
planning permission and the workmanship of which was of a low standard:
''That's what he gets for using a Freemason instead of a stonemason.''
Next stage
IT'S good to see a fellow journalistic hack achieve success in the
world of books and theatre. The man in question is James Barclay who in
a previous incarnation was Pat Roller. (Pat Roller, for the benefit of
our younger readers, was the by-line on the Daily Record's nightly
round-up of road accidents, scraped knees, and other bumps and bruises
in an altogether more gentle age of journalism.)
Mr Barclay is author of Paras over the Barras, a tome about wartime
exploits in the East End of Glasgow which was a best-seller in these
parts. At the same time as Paras is about to become a stage play at the
Pavilion Theatre in Glasgow, a new book by Mr Barclay hits the shelves.
It is called The Bigot and, in a neat piece of symmetry, it is a
novelisation of Mr Barclay's play of the same name which was first
produced at the Pavilion Theatre in 1977. The Bigot is set in Glasgow
just about the time Derek Johnstone played for Rangers. The main
protagonist (we cannot use the word hero to describe an unreconstructed
bluenose) is one Andra Thomson.
Andra is a true son of William who has a few problems: he is married
to Annie, a Catholic, but he has never told his pals; his son Peter
wants to be a priest; his daughter Jean is engaged to a Jewish boy from
Newton Mearns; and his wife Annie has been keeping a photograph of the
Pope under the bed, the very bed he has been snoring in all these years.
Oor Andra says of the Old Firm match: ''When we take the field it's
the Boyne a' ower again. That ba' is a cannon ba'. It's ammunition
because we arra people.'' We were going to suggest to Mr Barclay that
this sort of thing was of the past. Then Gazza (TM) played his flute.

THE Government cannot have it both ways. While Deputy Prime Minister
Michael Heseltine claims the dream target of sustained growth, rising
living standards and record exports is now within our national grasp,
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke continues to resist the entreaties of the Bank
of England for a further rise in interest rates to kill off inflationary
pressures.
If Heseltine's dream were the truth, the whole truth and nothing but
the truth, Clarke wouldn't have to keep saying no to Eddie George. But
all the Chancellor's political antennae tell him that, while Britain's
exporting economy is having a golden run, another interest rate rise
would snuff out what fragile domestic consumer confidence there is and
alienate even more voters from the Tory cause.
Judging by his performance on the BBC Radio 4 late news on Wednesday
evening, the new Tory Party chairman Dr Brian Mawhinney subscribes to
the convenient conspiracy theory that only a media bent on accentuating
the negative is preventing dispirited consumers, workers and homeowners
from realising that the Heseltine dream is for them too.
Why are you asking about policy differences between the Chancellor and
the Governor? a spikey Mawhinney demanded of his interviewer, Isobel
Hilton. Why dwell on issues like negative equity in the housing market
and job insecurity, when there's so much good economic news to talk
about? the irked doctor went on. I expected more of Mawhinney. As
analysis, his, frankly, is complete tosh.
The City speculates endlessly about the Clarke/George differences --
amicable differences, perhaps, but recorded in cold official print in
the minutes of their meetings -- and how these will eventually be
resolved. The issue is important, not just in terms of where interest
rates and inflation are heading, but also in the ongoing debate about
how much autonomy our central bank should enjoy in deciding such
matters.
So, despite Mawhinney's intemperate BBC bashing, Ms Hilton would have
been neglecting her duty if she had not pressed the point, especially on
the day when the Chancellor again ignored the Bank's advice and kept
rates on hold. If the best the new Tory chairman can come up with is an
attack on the media for suppressing the feel-good factor, then the Major
Government is in direr straits than I thought previously.
In his new role as chief Government cheer leader, Michael Heseltine is
in the business of peddling dreams. The trouble with the Heseltine dream
target for the economy is that it does not yet touch even the
subconscious of enough of the people who will decide the Government's
fate at the next election.
Negative equity is daily reality for more than 1,000,000 homeowners
brought up to believe that investing in bricks and mortar was the way to
get on in the world, not the way to land yourself with more debt than
just your mortgage.
Job stress and insecurity, born of inexorable competitive pressure to
produce more and more from less and less, is daily reality for millions
more workers. Failure to find any work at all is daily reality for,
officially, more than 2,000,000 unemployed. Unofficially, at least
1,000,000 more than that.
These are not myths gotten up by a few malevolent scribes and
commentators in the media. That is the kind of experience which fuels
the downbeat public mood, the mood Clarke dare not exacerbate further,
by raising the cost of money before he absolutely has to.
But even if Doubly indebted of Devizes, Jobless of Jarrow, and
Insecure of Inchinnan could shake off their personal worries for a
moment and focus on the wider economic picture, it is by no means
certain that they would conclude, as Mr Deputy Heseltine does, that all
the numbers point to the golden scenario he holds before us.
Certainly there are good signs. The OECD's annual survey of the
British economy, published this week, was upbeat on growth, outbidding
the Treasury with its 3.4% and 3% predictions for this year and next,
and on inflation, provided the Government does not give in to pressure
for unfunded tax cuts in November.
But the OECD's analysis was based on data up till May this year,
before signs of a renewed slow-down in the UK economy began to emerge.
The preliminary GDP figures for the April-June quarter, published last
month, show growth slowing. Industrial production fell in April and
again in May. And last week, the CBI quarterly industrial trends survey
confirmed the official evidence, reporting the first fall in business
confidence for nearly three years.
The CBI in Scotland tried to put a brighter gloss on the evidence,
with director Lex Gold claiming that both domestic and export demand
were ''set to improve''. But, within 24 hours of that prediction,
Cambridge Econometrics, in its latest half-yearly review of regional
economic prospects, was taking an altogether contrary line, predicting
that Scotland would bump along the bottom of the UK growth league, both
this year and next.
The Cambridge team, less bullish than the OECD, has pencilled in UK
GDP growth of 2.9% in 1995 and 3% in 1996. But Scotland, its forecasters
predict, will manage growth of just 2.3% and 2.4% this year and next
respectively, compared with growth in Wales of 3.4% and 3.5%. The
Cambridge forecasters also believe that Scotland will see a marginal
fall in employment this year, one of only two regions to experience job
shrinkage.
These are, of course, only forecasts. But taken together with the
signs, in the official statistics, of some slow-down in the economy
since April, they do raise questions about the substance of the
Heseltine dream. They also raise questions about how, precisely,
confidence in our collective economic future is to be restored by the
time of the next election.
As Kenneth Clarke juggles his commitment to bear down on inflation and
his party's desire for substantial tax cuts this November, the tide of
economic arithmetic is not going to make it any easier for him to find a
way through, without allowing some commitment or other to crash to the
stage floor.

I CONGRATULATE Graham Ogilvy on the article about selling (not
stealing or misappropriating?) old folks' houses to pay for their
long-term care (August 1).
Tory councillor Daphne Sleigh is quoted as saying that ''taking away
people's houses is not Conservatism'', but that is precisely what it is,
and I wonder just how long it will be before the tawdry political
sleight-of-hand practised by a clique of crypto-fascists masquerading as
Conservatives can go on before the British voters rise and put an end to
them.
I concede my personal bias; I was one of the many who started work
just before the Second World War, saw service with the Admiralty Salvage
Department saving bombed and torpedoed ships, etc, and thereafter in the
Royal Navy with great mediocrity.
That service, and the subsequent 40-plus years of paying national
insurance and income tax, etc, are now set at nought, in spite of all
the promises and statements of politicians of every party.
Today we are told that ''Great'' Britain simply cannot afford the
burden of honouring that debt to its aged population -- this from
politicians who have the audacity to stand at the Cenotaph, and make
speeches about VE and VJ Days.
A question for any Conservative to answer. Would you be prepared to
put one single penny on income tax if that would cover the cost of
looking after the generation, the fruits of whose efforts, you now
enjoy?
In a recent television forum, that is the cost to the taxpayer which
David Mellor quoted, and he quoted it in a tone of near horror!
Of course it could be afforded, but we have been brainwashed into
thinking that the cost is an impossible burden, one miserable single
penny!
Before the next General Election, the Government will manage to find
two pennies or more to bribe the electorate with, and do you know, I
wouldn't be at all surprised if it worked, down south at any rate.

THE term ''residual respect'' brought a wry smile to the mouth as your
editorial contemplated the ''Tory thinking on tax'' (July 31)
Here we have a Government who approve of taxing old-people and the
needy (VAT on fuel) and then propose measures to introduce the abolition
of inheritance tax and capital gains tax, not to mention the cock up on
share options, and their defence of ''fat-cat'' salaries.
To say that they are not particularly well-endowed with either
intellectual or political energy is to seriously overstate the position.
For too long this country has been subjected to the pseudo intellects
of the right and their misguided criteria.
For those who are curious as to the definition of the term
''intellectual'' and its loose application, perhaps an editorial on the
subject would enlighten us all, not least the Cabinet and Mr Redwood.

THE prosperity generated by North Sea oil and gas is disguising the
problems of Grampian's traditional industries, problems which could have
been avoided, according to a report published today.
Mackay Consultants of Inverness, in an economic report on Grampian
region during July, say it has been the worst month of the year, with
two Buckie boat building yards in receivership, the Glen Garioch
Distillery closing, Span Construction in receivership, a record loss for
Buchan Meat, redundancies at Elf Enterprise and Elgin City Sawmills, and
a fall in the oil and gas price.
The unemployment level in Grampian as a whole is currently 4.3%, as
opposed to Scotland's 7.7%, and is the lowest in the country apart from
Shetland and Orkney, but the consultants point to areas such as Forres,
where it is 13.8%, and Buckie, at 8.6%.
''As the North Sea industry declines in the second half of the 1990s,
however, some of the traditional industries will become much more
important again,'' they say.
''We believe many problems could have been avoided. The boat building
industry in Scotland has undoubtedly suffered from the over-capacity in
the fishing fleet and the consequent falling orders for new boats but
there have been diversification opportunities which the Buckie yards and
others have largely ignored.''
The consultants say the Scotch whisky industry, in spite of advice to
cut production, has produced too much whisky over the past five years
and the closure of Glen Garioch Distillery in Oldmeldrum and other local
distilleries earlier in the year was an inevitable consequence.
They are also critical of the effort to save the closure threatened
Torry Laboratory in Aberdeen, which they say had a well deserved
reputation in the 1980s but steadily let it slip.
They say Grampian is not about to experience the economic recessions
that have hit areas like Lanarkshire or Easter Ross, but believe
traditional industries like boat building, fish processing, and whisky
distilling have been neglected in the past decade.
The highlights in Grampian during July, according to Mackay, were
economic output rising by 2.4%; a drop in unemployment; an award of #7m
from the European Commission under the Pesca fund to help areas
adversely affected by the restructuring of the fishing industry; the
merging of Glenshee and Glencoe ski centres; and the announced expansion
of the St Fergus gas terminal.
Dr Howard Fisher, Grampian region's director of economic development
and planning, said yesterday that he shared many of the concerns and
that they were being addressed by the council and Grampian Enterprise.
''Will we be an international player 20 years from now? Places like
Barcelona, Lyons, and Glasgow have a clear vision of what they are going
to be about and so should Aberdeen.''

THE heading in the Express magazine read: ''God bless you Ma'am''.
Subtitled ''Celebrating Britain's Woman of the Century'' it was
salivating and sycophantic drivel concerning a cosseted wee girl who
grew in stature to be a harridan to a damned-near illiterate king. As
everybody else I have a sort of respect for this frail little man, but
none whatsoever for the woman who became his wife and who was eulogised
by all in the blatts the other day.
But then women are given a jolly from the blatts each day and
elswehere in the media. Each day I am assaulted by how deeply dreadful
it is to be a woman. Women's Hour does it to me as mere male listener.
The fact that more men die of testicular and prostrate cancer than women
do of breast cancer doesn't matter a damn. The fact that men die earlier
doesn't matter at all. It is men's fault.
Women can stab their husbands at will and the law is suborned because
the murderesses claim their hubbies were violent or drunken or dished
out mental cruelty. Easiest mitigation plea in the world. Get off with
it. All you have to say is you were beaten into submission. Nae danger
of just getting to buggery out of it, take the weans away, go to your
friends or relations, speak to the polis. Just go off into the kitchen
and stab the slob. Good defence and every advocate will lead it.
Celebrating Britain's woman of the Century. Well Lady Elizabeth
Bowes-Lyon was hardly a normal woman. Nor are most of the women who have
pled special pleading for over 20 years. Normal women are normal and get
on perfectly well with men: we are not a separate species really. You
would think we were sometimes. A headline in our sister paper read ''Men
Behaving Very Badly''. It was written by a bloke, one of those New Men
idjits.
Concerned a programme called Scottish Men and presented by Kaye Adams.
I was one of the Scottish Men she filmed and interviewed. Kaye is very
nice and the article by the Evening Times chap showed her up in a good
light indeed, but dear heavens, wasn't the boy apologetic for having a
sticky-out bit.
While he was writing great gobs of sensitive apologia there were court
rulings concerning how shocking it was that women were disciminated
against because of the ruling that an employee has to work at least two
years, continuously, before he or she can claim unfair dismissal. As it
happens it is always unlikely that anybody at all will win anything at
all out of an unfair dismissal for, though many such claims are valid,
neither employee or employer generally wins out.
But it is now said that thousands of women may win compensation after
a landmark judgment last Monday which at least implies that women than
men were likely to work for periods shorter than two years. Thus women
were discriminated against as a result.
The time has come to decide that women are cheeky bastards, or at
least those who constantly campaign for the female cause are. For the
truth is that if one agrees that unfair dismissal is unfair regardless
of the length of time an employee has worked then the unfairness has the
right to redress to law.
But the unrelenting press and the very Odd Women who incessantly argue
than they have been hard-done by and that men should be hanged for all
they have done in the past have made arguments which no normal person of
whatever gender can accept. Virtually every divorce action or separation
involves women getting all the poppy and none of the guilt, custody of
the children until they decide to abandon them, every bloody opportunity
for greed and venality.
Thank heavens I am a bachelor. I am glad too that my national service
in the Air Training Corps does not oblige me to demand hundreds of
thousands of pounds for getting up the stick because I would be
embarrassed by the notion that I can deny a contract.
This needs an explanation. Many an ex-serviceman in Erskine Hospital
could have done with the money for themselves and families. The women in
the services who have received thousands because they were with child
should have given their compensation away.
When I was a boy, women who married had to give up their jobs because
they were taking up incomes which families needed. It has gone round all
the way. Most men and women know something is crazy. Crazy. The Idolatry
for this old lady, the Queen Mum. Britain's ''Woman of the Century''.
Wrong. I know who that was. It was my mother. And yours too, no doubt.
It was, it was.

Robin Cook spells out the details of Labour's plan to fight for a
better deal for Britain as a team player in Europe and underlines the
particular benefits to Scotland
THE big problem with the European debate is its tendency to disappear
into orbit in a remote stratosphere inhabited by complex constitutions
and impenetrable jargon.
On my first visit as Foreign spokesman to Brussels, I was solemnly
told that the greatest challenge facing Europe was ''the need to
transform the three pillars of the European Union into a single tree
with three branches''. I have repeatedly tested this choice piece of
jargon at home without discovering anyone who can comprehend it, far
less believe that it expresses the greatest challenge in their life.
In Strasbourg I was treated to a full presentation of the six
different procedures by which the European Parliament can participate in
European law-making, depending on which subject is under debate. I still
do not understand the half of them and doubt whether anybody outside the
European Parliament can do any better.
The tragedy is that the European Union ought to bring together the
peoples of Europe and not provide a platform for an endless argument
between them over the design of its institutions. It is in order to
reconnect the European debate with the people on the ground that Labour
has launched its campaign for a people's Europe.
It is a campaign designed to address why British membership of the
European Union matters to every family and why their children's future
is more secure if Britain is a leading member of the European Union than
an isolated off-shore island.
It also sets out how those interests of our people are undermined by a
Conservative Parliament that increasingly approaches Europe with a
strategy of destructive obstruction. The author of a recent CBI report
concluded that the Tory splits on Europe ''make it harder to do
business, and harm our economic interests''. Their own civil servants
complain that they are marginalised in negotiations because of the
negative attitude of the Government. We cannot make a success of
Britain's membership of the EU under a Conservative Party that
constantly sounds as if it hopes the European Union will be a failure.
Labour believes Britain should be a constructive partner in Europe,
because that way we will get a better deal for British families. We can
only win in Europe if we are playing in the team rather than standing on
the sidelines.
This does not mean that Labour will sign up for a federal European
superstate. The Europe we seek is an association of free member states,
sharing common interests, not surrendering sovereignty. But we
understand that in today's world we cannot deliver the benefits we want
for our people unless we co-operate with other nations.
The first priority for the next Labour government will be jobs. Our
success in providing jobs in Britain will in part depend on the success
of the European Union to which Scotland sends 60% of its exports.
Yesterday I released a survey of over 100 top exporting firms in
Scotland which revealed that nine out of 10 hoped to expand exports to
Europe, but that half of them believed that these exports would be less
secure if there was doubt over Britain's commitment to Europe. Sixteen
of these companies are foreign-owned, and just over half of them
confirmed that future investment in Scotland would depend on our full
membership of the EU. Europe is vital to exports, investment, and jobs
in Scotland.
What our young people need are high-quality, high-skill jobs, in the
technologies of the future. That is the only path that offers them a
secure career and offers our country a competitive industry. We will,
though, only obtain a highly skilled workforce if we first build a
stable, committed workforce, which is why Europe seeks to establish a
social partnership between management and workforce.
Labour will sign up to the Social Chapter because we cannot accept
that working people in Britain should have less rights of consultation
and information at their place of work than their counterparts on the
Continent, some of whom actually work for the same British companies,
who honour the Social Chapter abroad but not at home.
Three companies in Britain have already broken Britain's opt-out on
the Social Chapter by introducing works councils. Revealingly, one of
them justified their decision as making their company more competitive
because a workforce that participates in the future strategy of the
company is one that would be more committed to it.
The opportunity of jobs and the right to consultation at the workplace
are only two of the real benefits that Europe offers our people.
Protection of our people as consumers also needs European rules to
maintain the same high standards for goods produced anywhere in the
single market.
Action by the European Union has ensured that shoppers can enter any
supermarket throughout Europe, confident that the goods they buy will
carry full labelling, and that the food they take home to eat will be of
high quality. The recent directive on time-share properties is a good
example of the need for European-wide legislation to protect consumers
in one country from being exploited in property contracts they make in
another member state.
Europe has a crucial role to play in protecting and improving the
environment of its people. Pollution respects no national boundaries,
and no state can preserve its environment by a strategy of isolationism.
We need common standards at a European level to improve the quality of
the seas and the air which we share.
Europe can also be an ally for the aspirations of the Scottish people
for a Scottish parliament. Increasingly debate in Europe focuses on
constructing a Europe of the Regions, in which the development of common
policies at a European level is matched by the devolution of more
decision-making to the regions of Europe. The German Lander offer us
successful lessons in both local political initiative and direct
communication with Brussels. Labour will put subsidiarity into practice,
not just between Britain and Brussels, but within Britain, starting with
our unequivocal and undiluted commitment to a Scottish parliament.
Yet Europe's greatest contribution to the quality of life of the
people throughout its borders is to guarantee that they can live in
peace. European integration has brought decades of peace and stability
to a continent accustomed to centuries of conflict. We must now apply
the lessons of that experience to a wider Europe.
The tragic conflict in the Balkans demonstrates the potential
instability of the former communist world as the old command structures
collapse. There are many other places in central and Eastern Europe
where borders imposed by the wars of this century divide the same ethnic
communities and throw different ethnic communities together. The best,
perhaps the only, way of resolving the tensions that such borders can
create is to pursue the strategy of the European Union in promoting the
free movement of people, trade, and investment between its member
countries, so that old frontiers no longer divide ethnic communities.
We live in a world in which the old boundaries of states are
increasingly breaking down through the pressures of the global economy,
the revolution in telecommunications and the explosion in international
trade. In the new world prosperity and security will go to those nations
who can build successful alliances and trading partnerships.
Labour understands the need for an international and a European
strategy and is therefore equipped to take Britain into the world of the
next century. By contrast, the Conservatives are vainly struggling to
turn back the hands of history to an eighteenth-century model of
self-contained nation states. Labour knows in which century Britain must
live if it is to thrive, and we are confident which century the people
will choose when they are invited to vote on it.

THE title of a Government booklet offering advice to older workers on
the subject of age discrimination in employment is Too old . . . Who
says?
It therefore should follow that the Government should implement its
own rules when dealing with its own staff. However, it doesn't work out
that way in the real world as a group of House of Commons security
guards will testify. They were all thrown out of their jobs because they
were over 60 despite being told when they joined that there was no age
discrimination.
About 40 guards were sacked because of age and were replaced by
younger persons employed to work on lower wages, thus proving that
ageism is alive and well in Westminster as well as everywhere else.
How two-faced can a Government get? On the one hand it admits that age
discrimination exists and it appears to be opposed to it but on the
other hand it shows its true colours by implementing rampant ageism
against its own staff.
The Government is not alone in this crusade against older workers. The
financial sector of Industry has been trying to wipe out the over-50s
(and younger) for the last 10 years. The disease has spread like a
cancer to other industries and none of us know if we will have a job
past aged 35 these days, never mind 50!
In the not too distant future there will be an insufficient number of
people working to support state benefits, the NHS, etc and we, quite
literally, face the meltdown of society as we know it. A daunting
prospect for all of us, especially our children.
People need to work for a variety of reasons. Work provides money for
survival purposes and dignity for each one of us. It benefits
individuals, families, and the state and it is the right of each one of
us to work, regardless of colour, race, sex, or age.
However, the Government does not appear to be interested in human
rights, especially in employment, and more especially in age
discrimination in the workplace.
What we need now is legislation to make illegal all forms of age
discrimination in employment. These laws exist in the US, Canada,
Australia, France, Germany, Spain, and a large number of other countries
in the EU and elsewhere. The Labour Party has recognised the need to
have this legislation and is committed to providing it if it is elected
at the next General Election. It is supported by the Liberal Democrats
and the SNP.
Why are the Conservatives so against legislation in this field? They
would do well to consider the implications of failing to provide their
voters with the protection provided by such laws. By the year 2000 over
50% of the working population will be aged 45 and above, and very
vulnerable to age discrimination by employers.

AS Kenya's information adviser in London I hope you will allow me to
reply both to your leading article (July 29) as well as to Sir David
Steel (July 28).
Two things concern me about Sir David's comments. First, as a
self-proclaimed friend of Kenya, he has absolutely nothing positive to
say about the undoubted progress being made by the country. He knows as
well as I do that Kenya has managed two transitions -- political and
economic -- at the same time.
Yet he cannot even give Kenya credit for the economic advances which
the World Bank publicly acknowledged at the recent Paris Club meeting --
complimenting the Kenya Government ''on the sustained implementation of
efforts to stabilise the economy, as a precondition for progress towards
the longer-term goal of poverty reduction''.
The second point is that Sir David puts together a number of unrelated
arguments to come up with misleading conclusions. But then, of course,
he is a politician!
He seems to ignore the fact that the Commonwealth Secretariat (among
other impartial observers) described the multi-party elections of
December 1992 as a major step forward on the road to democracy and
certainly did not conclude that the ruling Kenya Africa National Union
had been ''rigged'' into power.
Perhaps Sir David's frustration is that Kenya's main opposition party
-- Ford-Kenya -- is a member of the Liberal International, of which he
is President.
Sir David tries to link the present value of the Kenya shilling with
''corruption''. If he was in touch with day-to-day events he would know
that, over the past few months, Kenya's exporters have been crying out
for the Kenya shilling to depreciate in value against international
currencies.
Its value has been left correctly to market forces and, over the last
few weeks, has indeed depreciated, to the relief of exporters and the
benefit of the tourist trade.
Sir David also claims that ''corruption and rich pickings for the few
have led to mass unemployment and housing squalor for the young''. This
really is simplistic nonsense. Mass unemployment and poverty are endemic
in all of Africa, including South Africa.
Kenya has embarked upon a major drive for foreign investment to create
business and employment opportunities -- and recently hosted the first
all-British trade fair to be held since independence. It was an enormous
success and the 41 British companies participating will confirm an
encouraging upturn in the overall business climate -- a climate that
will only be undermined by Sir David's remarks.
Certainly politics is a highly-charged business in Kenya, but if Sir
David believes that it is all one-way traffic for the Government he
should read the outspoken comments and criticisms of the Kenya press,
presumably more often than he does.
I looked in vain, too, for mention in his article of the successful
rehabilitation of the victims of ethnic violence in the Rift Valley by
the Kenya Government and the United Nations Development Programme, but,
of course, this was good news, rather than bad.
Finally, the statement in your leading article that British bilateral
aid has been frozen is incorrect. A press release issued on July 28 by
the Overseas Development Administration has made it clear that this is
not the case.
You write that President Moi runs ''an unpleasant regime''. I believe
that this is an unfair judgment. The issues are highly complex and
worthy of more serious and balanced consideration that the one-eyed
version given by Sir David Steel.

AN axe attacker who took part in a ''trial by combat'' in a Highland
village was jailed for five years yesterday.
Lord Dawson said at the High Court in Edinburgh that Darryl McAlpine,
23, had accepted a challenge to a fight and armed himself with ''a
potentially lethal weapon'' which he used during the conflict.
His victim was flown by air ambulance to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary for
neurosurgical treatment to a wound which fractured his skull and tore
the brain lining.
Doctors feared that if the axe had gone deeper into Mr David McPhee's
head it could have resulted in paralysis.
''Such behaviour can only be regarded as barbaric and cannot be
tolerated in a civilised society,'' the judge said
Lord Dawson said he was prepared to limit the sentence to five years'
imprisonment as the offence appeared to be out of character for
McAlpine.
McAlpine, of Mackay Street, Castletown, in Caithness, when he appeared
earlier at Wick Sheriff Court, had admitted assaulting Mr McPhee, 33, in
Castletown in August last year by striking him on the head with an axe
to his severe injury .
Sheriff Donald Booker-Milburn decided his maximum power of sentence,
three years, was inadequate and sent him to the High Court.
Advocate-depute James Campbell told the High Court that there was some
doubt about what led up to the axe attack, but the night before there
had been a fracas and a challenge was thrown down.
He said: ''As a result of that challenge two men on one side and two
on the other were to meet at a specific place to have it out by trial by
combat.''
McAlpine had gone to the scene of the fight at the harbour in the
Caithness village with an axe. He claimed he had been struck on the
shoulder with a broom handle before he used his weapon on Mr McPhee, of
Thura Mains Cottages, Bower, in Caithness.
Mr McPhee was initially felled by the blow to his head, but managed to
get back to his feet. He drove from the scene before visiting a
relative. But by this stage he was becoming dizzy because of blood loss
and was taken to hospital in Caithness.
His wound was stitched but it was discovered he had a depressed
fracture and he was transferred by air ambulance to hospital in
Aberdeen.
A scan revealed that Mr McPhee was bleeding into his brain and he was
taken to the operating theatre.
Mr Campbell said the victim had made a very good recovery but there
was still a risk he could develop epilepsy.

your reporters.
We are nearer to Befast than Dumfries but nobody ever puts us in

sea off Burrow Head, just across Luce Bay from here -- ''a small bay in
Dumfriesshire''. Your travel pages have an excellent article on the
attractions of Dumfries and Galloway -- but it stops dead at Creetown,
well into Kirkcudbrightshire. A tragic accident at Innermessan,
''Dumfriesshire'' -- you could hardly get further west than Innermessan.
Bad enough that under this clumsy ''Dumfries and Galloway'' region we
have become ''Wigtown District'', so that the streets of Stranraer are
full of rubbish bins saying ''Keep Wigtown Tidy'' -- Wigtown is a small
town about 30 miles from Stranraer, and as far as I know it is in a
reasonably well-kept state.
Fortunately the Post office lets us use the old county names -- long
may it continue. I have been to Dumfriesshire -- it's quite a pleasant
place (for a foreign country), but don't put me there when I'm here.

IT was with interest and a liberal dose of cynical scepticism that I
learned of the appointment of William Nimmo-Smith, QC, as head of the
inquiry into allegations of nepotism with Monklands District Council.
In 1992 I was interviewed on a number of occasions by Mr Nimmo-Smith
during the inquiry into the so called ''Magic Circle'' affair and in his
concluding report was grossly misrepresented and much maligned by him
under the protection of parliamentary privilege.
Councillors of Monklands, beware!

I HAVE never read such a farrago of emotional nonsense as that in
which Mr Bashir Maan bewails the fate of fellow Muslims in Bosnia
Herzegovina (July 25).
What angers me is that Mr Maan, having quite literally moved in and
set up shop among us like the good bania (shopkeeper) he is, albeit an
uninvited guest in his chosen host country, then sets about abusing the
hospitality, the haven, he has found here when for most Muslims, as well
as most people, if not Mr Maan, the abuse by guest of host is a cardinal
sin.
Mr Maan's wild assumptions anent the rights and wrongs of the
situation in former Yugoslavia are not to be dwelt upon here. My own
sympathies lie with the Muslims, not because they are Muslims but simply
because they are a minority standing in the way of an aggressor bent on
aggrandisement and following Hitler's Third Reich as a role model.
Mr Maan bewails Serbs' brutal treatment of Muslims for which ethnic
cleansing is the ''in'' word. Yet instead of helping to douse the
flickering flames of all-out war, he would create a blaze, a new killing
field embroiling not only the youth of the Balkans already dying but the
youth of Europe as well.
Are two world wars this century not enough for Mr Maan? If he is
serious in his concern for Bosnia's Muslims he could go to Bosnia to
help out. His undoubted organising ability would be invaluable. Others,
even from this tiny community here, have done just that.
I suggest Mr Maan counts his blessings -- one being that he has chosen
to live in a country where turning the other cheek is one of the basic
tenets of the prevalent faith.
I do not join Mr Maan in abusing my country's somewhat maladroit
conduct of affairs in the Balkans -- it is in the British tradition to
''muddle through''. Mr Maan can return whence he came, or he can go help
his fellow Muslims, or he can just hold his peace, respecting the ethos
and traditions of the country that he has chosen to adopt.

F GILLINGHAM'S statement that socialism does not succeed the demise of
competition is a sobering thought though quite a realistic one.
If the idealistic world of ''socialism'' is unattainable, then perhaps
we should be considering the modification of capitalism itself by
removing the stifling bureaucracy and narrowing the salary scales.
Some hopeful signs can be found in the experience of the Scandinavian
so-called socialist regimes and also in the success story of the
Mondragon Co-op venture in Spain.
Perhaps the most powerful influence in modifying capitalism is the
imposition of a single energy excise tax (Unitax) to replace all other
central taxes in a phased strategy over 10 to 20 years. This would be
accomplished by a basic income as of right to replace social security
payments.
These measures are simple, fair, and efficient, removing a vast layer
of bureaucracy and simultaneously meeting current environmental demands.
The emphasis on labour at the expense of energy is also a factor in
countering unemployment.

After almost 200 years the United States may close its consulate in
Scotland. Raymond Duncan examines the reasons for change in the consular
service
MORE than two centuries ago the French Government took the decision to
put a diplomatic presence into Scotland, choosing Glasgow as the
location for its first consulate.
Matters, however, literally came to a head some 12 months later. Louis
XVI was guillotined, France and Britain engaged in open hostilities, and
the consul was later expelled. When it reopened in the first quarter of
the nineteenth century, Edinburgh was chosen as the site and, despite a
return to the west, the consulate was later to find a permanent home
back in the capital.
About 10 years ago this valuable link between the Auld Alliance
countries came under threat when the Edinburgh establishment, along with
others in the UK, was earmarked for closure.
However it survived -- Manchester, Liverpool and Cardiff closed -- and
four years ago its jurisdiction was extended to Northern Ireland and the
Isle of Man.
Now another 200-year link between Scotland and a major international
power is under threat.
The United States Consulate, first established in Leith in 1798 but
for the past 44 years located in Regent Terrace, one of Edinburgh's most
prestigious thoroughfares, is reported to be closing. The move is said
to be part of a cost-cutting exercise which would see a number of
consular casualties world-wide.
A major part of the problem has been the need to open up diplomatic
presences in the new countries that emerged from the collapse of the
former Soviet Union and that has been an expensive operation.
The closure proposal, it is understood, has to be ratified by Congress
in around a month's time, yet, according to one senior source within
Edinburgh's consular community, the identity of the successor to the
present Consul-General, Mrs Bobette Orr, was passed to him two months
ago.
Chicago-born Mrs Orr, a popular figure in Edinburgh since she took up
the post in 1992 and who is said to be very sad about the proposal, has
not been available at the US Consulate to clear up the confusion.
The situation surrounding the future of the Regent Terrace
establishment comes in the wake of a number of changes in the consular
service, both in Edinburgh and Glasgow. According to Jens Hogel, the
62-year-old Consul-General of Denmark and the Dean of the Consular Corps
in Edinburgh and Leith, there has been a ''dramatic'' rise in recent
years in the number of consuls.
There are 34 in his area, a figure he considers extraordinary for its
size. Some are career diplomats -- they tend to be in their salaried
posts and their official residences for three years or so -- while
others are unpaid honorary consuls invited, possibly because of business
links, by countries to represent their interests.
At his office in Royal Terrace -- the oldest consulate in Edinburgh --
the Danish Consul-General, diplomatically of course, would not comment
about the possible closure of the US offices. Mr Hogel said that since
he took up his post in 1987, there had been a remarkable rise in the
Corps. Representatives of a number of countries including Japan, Russia,
Poland -- it previously was located in Glasgow -- Romania, Venezuela and
Mexico had joined the ranks of the Corps.
Some countries, however, including Finland and Australia had
downgraded their representation from career diplomats to honorary
consuls.
The possible closure of the US Consulate is puzzling Scotland's new
Consul-General of France, M. Jean-Claude Moreau, who is settling in at
his offices in Randolph Crescent. He said, however, he could understand
a closure of some consulates around the world on expense grounds.
Glasgow has only one ''career consul'' left -- Mr Rab Khan, of
Pakistan. The last one to leave was the South African Consulate-General
Miss Annette de K Joubert. She departed when the Department of Foreign
Affairs in Pretoria closed it down in response to its country's policy
of enlarging its presence in Africa and Eastern Europe.

THERE are many politicians who can be mocked with impunity but Mr
Robin Cook is not one of them. To that extent the Secretary of State for
Scotland's scathing dismissal of Mr Cook's travels around Britain in the
cause of Labour's European policy is unwise. It is also particularly
unwelcome coming, as it does, from a Minister in a Conservative
Government which has avoided a proper discussion of the issues because
it appears to prefer adolescent cat-calling and a level of debate which
would disgrace a kindergarten. That said, Mr Cook should not be allowed
to have it all his own way. He is not an obvious emissary for strongly
pro-European policies and he is unlikely to be as natural a European as
his leader. For those reasons Mr Cook appears to be concentrating on
leaning on open doors, at least thus far in his travels. His survey of
more than 100 Scottish exporters is a case in point. It shows clearly
the importance of the European market for Scottish and British exports.
After all, 53% of British exports (and 60% of Scottish exports) go to
the European Union compared with 14% to North America and 4% to other
leading industrial countries. Other evidence gathered in recent months
suggests that exports would be less successful if there were doubts
about Britain's commitment to Europe and that inward investment of any
significant kind depends heavily on our position within the EU.
That said, Mr Cook would be foolish to imagine that the boardrooms of
Scotland are solidly behind Labour policies simply because they
understand that their best sales prospects are in Europe. Scottish
businessmen will want to hear what Mr Cook has to say about putting in
place a regime and infrastructure which will facilitate the creation and
expansion of business opportunities. This means that there is much more
to the European argument than just specifically European policies; nor
should he rely on finding too many socialist notions lurking in the
nooks and crannies of Scottish business. Nevertheless, in extolling the
many benefits Britain has drawn from EU membership, Mr Cook is following
in the footsteps of the Chancellor, Mr Clarke. In his article for us
this morning Mr Cook has side-stepped the issue of a single currency.
This is unfortunate. The Chancellor likes to skirt around it by trying
to emphasise the economic aspects of the issue while downplaying,
thereby, the inevitable political implications. This attempts to narrow
the Emu debate to a purely economic affair, which it is not and never
will be. By ignoring it this morning Mr Cook has taken this approach an
improbable step further but it is not a realistic strategy and sooner or
later the problem must be addressed.
Wisely, perhaps, Mr Cook's approach concentrates more on the social
aspects of European policy. His argument for cooperation is compellingly
logical and it is interesting, if not novel, to follow his comparison
between the German Lander and a devolved Scotland with a European
Minister reporting to a future Scottish parliament. The proposals being
made on his tour for reforming the Common Agricultural Policy are yet
another example of preaching to the converted. Of all the EU internal
issues this is the one most pressingly in need of attention. Nobody
disputes this, though we will have to be told much more about a policy
which proposes targeting spending on rural income and paying farmers to
manage the countryside rather than maximise output. This may be common
sense but we need to know how it can be achieved without dislocation of
industries which we must preserve. A tour with Mr Cook is clearly an
interesting affair. He seems to be enjoying himself and he is a
stimulating speaker. However, his policy itinerary is not yet detailed
enough and as a tour guide he must pay more attention to detail.

THE cost of a medical prescription is high if you have to pay for it.
Not everyone does, of course, and that is one of the surviving blessings
of our mangled National Health Service. Yet the issue is not as cut and
dried as the Government would have us believe. By its way of thinking,
those who can afford to pay do so, and those who cannot afford to pay
are spared. This simplistic analysis completely ignores the many people
who are required to pay the full price for medicine but who find the
cost of two prescriptions or so every month a serious drain on their
income.
Two contrasting problems may arise from this unsatisfactory state of
affairs. On the one hand it is possible to slide into the situation
prevalent in the US where doctors take account of the wealth of their
patients when prescribing. Those who can afford to pay are offered a
wide range of drugs, which is of particular importance when an
intractable medical problem may yield to a subtle or combined approach.
The poor go to medical practices where they are offered medicines which
are cheaper but which lack the range and subtlety offered to their
richer neighbours. In a civilised society the provision of medical care
is either egalitarian or it is nothing. There is no half-way house
between the ideals of the National Health Service as we struggle to
remember it, and the system common in the US.
Another problem arises through the efforts of the well-meaning to
circumvent the pain of paying for prescriptions. This is exemplified at
the moment by the courageous, if misled, Gwent pharmacist, Mr Allan
Sharpe. He has angered a competitor and the local health services
authority by giving customers the opportunity to buy drugs prescribed by
GPs at costs below that of the prescription charge. Mr Sharpe insists
that he is doing nothing wrong because the Government makes sizeable
profits on prescription charges. Unfortunately, Mr Sharpe is doing
something wrong. He has a contract with the National Health Service
which says that pharmacists must dispense medicines through the NHS
system if their patients have been given NHS prescriptions by family
doctors.
Mr Sharpe is correct in claiming that the price of many of the
medicines which the NHS requires him to dole out at #5.25 per item is
frequently well below that sum. Elsewhere in our newspaper this morning
we give details of cost of some popular drugs which may startle many
patients. Mr Sharpe would be justified in his actions if the patients
came to him with private prescriptions written by their GPs, but in his
case the prescriptions are intended for the NHS by the doctors who write
them. In many parts of the country doctors are writing private
prescriptions, but though this would resolve Mr Sharpe's dilemma it is
not clear that it would help the wider problem. Prescription charges are
as high as they are because they are part of the greater system of
financial provision for the entire National Health Service. They could
be lower, but this would require a different division of the way in
which funds are gathered and allocated, or it would need a complete
rethink on the position of drugs provision within the NHS. Repeated
rises in the cost of a prescription is the simple way to deal with the
problem: some would say that it is also simple-minded. The Government
prides itself on applying radical thinking to NHS problems. In respect
of prescription charges, this claim is bogus. Genuinely radical
appraisal is needed and if the Government cannot or will not do it, we
deserve to hear in detail what the opposition parties propose.

Anne Johnstone reports on how the French decision to restart nuclear
testing in the Pacific has boomeranged on their export trade to
Australia
AUSTRALIAN baker Peter Emmanuel has hit on a novel way of protesting
against the resuming of French nuclear testing in the Pacific. The
enterprising entrepreneur from Perth quadrupled sales of French sticks
by reshaping them and rechristening them. Out went baguettes. In came
Boomerang Bread!
In the same spirit a group of prostitutes in Canberra have stopped
using the term ''French letter'' after discovering to their cost that in
the current climate, anything with the vaguest Gallic connection is
likely to be boycotted by an Australian public angered by the French
decision. In a desperate move to beat the boycott, restaurateurs have
been photographed ostentatiously pouring their stocks of French wines
down the drain and urging their clients to stick to Antipodean tipples.
Typically, the initial French response to this outburst of Ozzie
outrage was to shrug it off. French Trade Minister Christine Chauvet, as
recently as last week, claimed that the protests were having little
impact on French exports. The only serious problem had been action taken
by Australian dockers refusing to unload French cargoes, she said.
But by Wednesday it was clear that the Chirac Government had seriously
underestimated the political fall-out of their decision to resume
underground nuclear testing at Mururoa atoll in the south Pacific in
September. Last year France exported more than #800m of goods to
Australia. The biggest items were chemicals (#63m), followed by perfume
and cosmetics (#46m), electrical circuits (#46m), and alcohol (#33m). By
contrast the French imported just #381m of goods from Australia, about a
third of it wool (#124m) and another #75m in coal. A small but
significant item on the French shopping list is uranium.
The incident which seems to have disturbed the French sang froid was
the exclusion of the French aerospace company Dassault from bidding for
a #370m contract to provide trainer jets for the Australian military.
This led to the decision on Tuesday to recall for urgent consultations
the French ambassador to Australia and a tetchy statement the next day
accusing the protesters of trying to undermine France's position in the
Pacific.
Meanwhile, those involved in French trade with Australia are starting
to cry out. The Melbourne wine merchants, Dan Murphy Cellars, note ''a
marked decrease in purchases of French wine'', though sales of champagne
are so far unaffected.
Graeme Adam, manager of public affairs for Volvo Car Australia, which
also imports Renaults, said his company shouldn't be held accountable
for the policy decisions of the country where the cars are made. The
boycott could inflict great damage on his company (and its largely
Australian workforce) but in terms of the Renault company it would be
''like a flea bite on an elephant's backside''.
French restaurateurs have also attempted to distance themselves from
the Chirac Government by circulating petitions against the testing
decision among their clients. Protests came to a head on Bastille Day
(July 14). The French ambassador's party went ahead amidst tight
security but many politicians and diplomats stayed away. Trade unions
staged a 24-hour ban on servicing all French commercial flights,
resulting in the cancellation of Air France flights. And angry
placard-waving dockers prevented a French Government-owned ship from
leaving Sydney harbour.
In Brisbane the mayor publicly ripped up the city's twinning agreement
with Nice. Even before the end of June it was clear that both the French
and Australian governments had radically underestimated the public
reaction to the testing decision. A public opinion poll revealed that
95% of Australians opposed the tests and 34% would boycott all French
produce. More recent polls show that figure is growing. Brian Donaghy,
an Adelaide-based business journalist, says: ''The spontaneous anger
about this is absolutely universal. I've never known anything like it.
There's no doubt at all that businesses dealing with French goods are
being hit very hard.''
As with the Brent Spar protest in Europe, this public anger is now
setting the political agenda. The Labour Government of Paul Keating (a
Francophile who collects French Empire period clocks) has been badly
wrong-footed on the issue. Seeking at first to adopt a ''reasonable,
statesmanlike'' approach, Keating and Foreign Minister Gareth Evans
found themselves accused of caving in to the French. Meanwhile, the
Australian Democrats who hold the balance of power in the Senate have
been making handsome political capital out of their demand that
Australia stop the export of uranium to France.
In the meantime, at both local and national level, those in power have
the tricky problem of how to handle bids from French companies for
Australian utilities which are in the process of being privatised. In
Victoria, for example, the French utility Electricite de France (EDF) is
bidding for United Energy. The state government has said it can't
''dump'' the EDF bid because the French company has already spent around
#4m on it and such an action could open the Government to legal action.
But it opens them to the opposition charge that they are appeasing the
French.
If anything, feelings are running even higher in New Zealand where
many shops have cleared French wine and mineral water from their
shelves. Defence officials have delayed a decision on a major contract
for a surface-to-air missile system, for which a French company is the
front-runner.
Consumer boycotts are almost unknown in Japan, but peace groups are
urging the public to show their anger at the French decision by spurning
French goods. They have won the support of the Japanese Non-Governmental
Organisations Centre which represents around 70 voluntary groups.
Right around the Pacific rim, the 50th anniversary of the bombing of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki is now focusing attention on the horrors of
nuclear war and stoking anti-French feeling. Chirac and his Government
clearly hoped the protest would fizzle out after a few weeks. Instead
they are facing an explosion of outrage of nuclear proportions which
looks set to hit them where it hurts most -- dans la poche.

DEFENCE diversification has, with honourable exceptions, tended to be
an afterthought for politicians who wanted to see military expenditure
cut. It gave them something -- not always very convincing -- to say to
sceptical constituents who realised that it was their jobs which were on
the line.
The exceptions included the Rosyth shop stewards who saw at least some
of the writing on the wall in the early eighties and tried to chart an
alternative future for themselves. But in general, the admirable
principle of turning swords into ploughshares didn't get much further
than being just that -- an admirable principle.
However the end of the cold war changed all that. It is no longer
left-wing peaceniks who are calling for cuts in military spending but
right-wing defence secretaries who are cutting with a ferocity that
would have provoked cries of Bolshevist treachery if implemented by a
Labour Government.
Attempt to escape from reliance on the arms industry is no longer a
high moral option, but an urgent necessity for hundreds of firms, large
and small who must now diversify or die. And, according to the
Government's own figures, in 1992 there were some 75,000 Scottish jobs
directly dependent on defence spending.
The other day, I took part in a seminar run by the Edinburgh and
Lothian Defence Diversification Initiative which was set up in response
to the loss of 3000 jobs at GEC-Marconi during the eighties. That was a
time when diversification was still a fringe issue, dismissed by those
who assumed that the militarist balloon would never burst.
The initiative is admirable in both concept and practice, as well as
an example of imaginative local government at its best. A small team has
established excellent contacts with defence-related companies in Lothian
and a modest investment -- the whole initiative has cost #400,000 so far
-- has produced impressive results.
Diversification still tends to have the image of adapting production
lines so that tractors roll off instead of tanks. In fact, it is in the
adaptation of sophisticated technology from military to civil uses that
the best hopes and examples of success lie.
The British economy has been distorted and handicapped by the huge
proportion of research and development which, throughout the postwar
years, had military application as its first priority. This is in marked
contrast with Japan which is precluded by internationally-imposed law
from developing its military technology.
As a result its resources and brainpower went into civil products and
the consequences are around us in every home, garage and workplace. We
were doubtless equally good at making rockets and bombs. A tremendous
opportunity now exists to concentrate on applying science and technology
in this country to the improvement of humanity, rather than to the means
of its destruction.
One of the points which the Lothian seminar brought to me was that
diversification is not just about the big names in the defence field.
Eighty-five per cent of firms which rely on defence orders employ fewer
than 100 people. For them, it is even more important to have external
assistance in converting to other products and markets if they are not
simply to close their doors as victims of the ''peace dividend''.
One of the first diversification projects successfully completed with
help from the initiative involves an Edinburgh optoelectronics company.
They helped identify industrial uses for adaptations of its solid-state
lasers. Interest has been shown in the prototype by several research and
development institutes.
A long-established engineering company suffered an 80% drop in
business, directly due to defence cuts. With help from the initiative's
product development fund they identified a market for a new pushchair
for disabled children and have now moved from prototype to successful
production.
Whether it's penny numbers of jobs which are being retained or larger
firms -- Malcolm McSwan, managing director of one of the Racal group
companies, gave a most enlightening presentation on the experience of
adjusting to the civil market and culture -- it seems to be crystal
clear that this is a responsible and enlightened form of interventionism
by responsible public agencies.
Where, however, does the present Government stand? They declined to
send a Minister to last week's seminar and a sniffy letter from Malcolm
Rifkind's private secretary intimated that they did not see it as their
job to ''interfere'' in decisions by companies about their future
strategy.
The only advice which they seem interested in offering is that firms
should try to export more military-related equipment to fill the gap
left by our own MoD's down-turn in demand. The assumption that there
will always be wars and governments which require British-made hardware
for fighting them is probably as shortsighted as it is distasteful.
In 1991, there was some ballyhoo about Scottish Enterprise being asked
to identify the scale of threat to Scottish jobs and to recommend
alternatives. A unit of SE was briefly established and it was they who
told the Scottish Office that 75,000 jobs in Scotland were at stake.
Then, as soon as the General Election was out the way, they were closed
down.
In contrast, I believe there will be a serious ongoing job to be done
by the Defence Diversification Agency to which Labour is committed. The
work of Edinburgh, Lothian and other Scottish local authorities provides
excellent small-scale models of what can be achieved.

GREEN-fingered neighbours who live in the same street in a Fife
fishing village have come out on top with their exhibits in a floral
display competition.
The three neighbours in Gourlay Crescent in St Monans have shared the
major awards.
Yesterday, however, outright winner Peter Hunter, who lives at number
25, said: ''I am delighted to have won but I would be the first to
compliment the losers on their displays.
''Like me, they are very keen gardeners.''
Mr Hunter, a former hospital charge nurse before becoming a nurseryman
with a former company of rose growers in Dunfermline, has more than 300
varieties of plants and hanging baskets in his garden.
Judges had toured the village throughout the summer looking for the
best displays.
His neighbour, Mrs Jean Allan, at number 23, and Mrs Celia Smith, who
lives at number 5 in the crescent, were the runners-up.

A PHARMACIST has brought the ethics of National Health prescription
charges into question by defending his right to offer patients cheaper
medicines against claims that he was acting illegally.
Yesterday Mr Allan Sharpe, of Newbridge, Gwent, appeared before his
local family health services authority after complaints by another
chemist that he had breached the terms of his NHS contract.
Mr Sharpe will have to wait six weeks before he learns if any action
is to be taken against him. However, clearly unrepentant after the
hearing in Cardiff, the 55-year-old chemist said: ''Whatever happens, I
am not going to stop saving my patients money.
''It was a very difficult meeting, and the health authority showed me
little sympathy. But I am still hopeful I will win this -- I certainly
hope I do for the sake of my patients.
''I hope this will prompt the Government and the NHS to sort out the
problems with the prescription system and make it fair. I am not
prepared to play at being a tax collector for the Government.''
He added: ''If a medicine can be bought at a cheaper price than the
NHS presciption, then that's the price I will sell it at. I do not
believe the National Health Service or chemists have the right to
deprive patients of that right to cheaper drugs.
''I'm not really concerned about the people who are well off and can
afford to pay the presciption charge. I'm trying to help those who are
struggling to get by and fall outside Government exemptions for
prescription charges.''
One of Mr Sharpe's long-standing customers, former miner Keith Jones,
57, said: ''That man has saved me hundreds and hundreds of pounds --
he's a saint.
If the case is proved, Mr Sharpe faces a financial penalty and
reprimand, or could lose his NHS contract, but he has been supported by
the National Pharmaceutical Association, which claims prescription
charges are a tax on the sick.
The dispute is regarded as a test case of the NHS contract which binds
both pharmacists and GPs and occurred on the same day it was announced
that British doctors last year wrote up more than 520 million
prescriptions, while medicine costs fell by 2% in real terms.
The recent increase in prescription charges by 50p to #5.25 has been
condemned by doctors, pharmacists and opposition political parties.
The BMA in Scotland called for a review of anomalies in the system
while Shadow Health Secretary, Mrs Margaret Beckett said that, if the
1979 prescription charge of 20p had kept pace with inflation, it would
now be 52p.
However, Health Minister Mr Gerry Malone claimed the charge was still
''significantly less than the average total cost of a single
prescription item to the NHS''.
Mr Sharpe's case strikes at the deeper ethical core of the charges
afforded by NHS prescriptions.
As a pharmacist for 30 years, he says the majority of commonly
prescribed drugs can now be bought privately for less than #5.
As prescription charges have steadily increased over the years, he has
been advising patients with NHS prescriptions that the drugs they need
can often be bought cheaper privately.
But according to NHS regulations, all pharmacists must dispense
medicines through the NHS if patients have been given prescriptions by
family doctors. Few patients, however, are aware that they can ask their
family doctor not to put their medicine on prescription.
The Annual Review by the Association of the British Pharmaceutical
Industry (ABPI) showed the total NHS medicines bill for 1994 topped
#4bn, but claimed the rise in the bill was slowed by a fall in medicine
prices.
A Department of Health spokesman refused to be drawn on whether the
fall in prices would lead to a cut in the #5.25 prescription charge.

AN enraged father killed his baby daughter in a fit of temper. Samuel
Reid grabbed five-month-old Natalie, shoved her against a settee, then
shook her violently, the High Court in Airdrie heard yesterday.
Minutes later he walked to a neighbour's house holding the unmoving
body and said: ''Do something with her, she's not breathing.''
Natalie was taken to Law Hospital, Carluke, and later transferred to
Yorkhill Sick Children's Hospital, Glasgow, where she died from her
injuries four days later on February 8, this year. She had suffered
severe cerebral bruising.
Reid, 25, from Wishaw, Lanarkshire, admitted carrying out the attack
at the family home in Linghope Place while Natalie's mother, Ms Marilyn
Allardice, 24, was at the dentist.
He will be sentenced today.
Yesterday Reid, who wept openly in the dock, pled guilty to a reduced
charge of culpable homicide.
As the details of Natalie's death were read out, Ms Allardice sat in
the public benches with her head in her hands.
Reid snapped because Natalie had been crying continually. He lifted
the baby to try to get her to stop, but this only made her cry more, the
court heard.
It was then that he shoved her against the settee. Her head hit a
wooden frame causing a hairline fracture of the skull.
Mr Donald Findlay, QC, defending said: ''The fracture would have
healed after a couple of days.''
Mr Findlay said Reid shook the baby in an effort to revive her.
He said: ''At that point he shook her. He thought he had caused her
considerable damage. He shook her and in doing that Reid now knows that
he killed his daughter.
''It was done in ignorance, lack of knowledge and panic.''
Mr Findlay added that the death of Natalie had left Reid ''utterly
distraught'' and he said: ''It is not uncommon for cases to be described
as tragic. This phrase is used too often, but I have no hesitation in
applying it in this case.''
He said Reid had suffered head injuries in a road accident when he was
five and this had left him with a mental handicap. Reid's IQ was only
71, added Mr Findlay.
Following the hour-long court hearing Ms Allardice said: ''He deserves
to suffer for what he did to my daughter.
''When I left her she was playing in her baby walker. I said to her:
'Mummy's going now, I'll see you later,' but the next time I saw her she
was in hospital dying.''

<HEADLINE>Social work chief denies claims of race-based plot</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A SENIOR social work official from Strathclyde Regional Council has
condemned claims that a victimisation plot fuelled by racism lay behind
the closure of a Renfrewshire residential home for the elderly.
Hitting out at allegations made during an appeal by Dr Sohail Chaudhry
against the withdrawal of registration for his Caldwell House care
establishment at Uplawmoor amid claims of neglect last December, Mr
Alistair Sinclair, the district officer responsible for care for the
elderly, claimed instead that he and his staff went out of their way to
support the proprietors as they stumbled from one crisis to another.
Giving evidence at the tribunal in Paisley Sheriff Court, Mr Sinclair,
praised one of the team -- senior social worker Davina Young -- who had
earlier been singled out for criticism and was accused of waging a
racist-inspired, one-woman campaign against Dr Chaudhry and his staff.
Mr Sinclair was speaking out following accusations heard earlier by
the tribunal and claims that the Renfrewshire area social work
department was in the grip of a Masonic-based mafia which was
anti-Pakistani in nature.
The witness, who was Mrs Young's direct senior, denied he had ever
received any complaints from Dr Chaudhry or allegations that he was
being subjected to victimisation or racial discrimination.
He said he and his registration officers had done everything possible
to assist Dr Chaudhry and his wife to make the venture a success, but
felt the scheme had been doomed from day one.
Dr Chaudhry had been warned on numerous occasions about improper
levels of supervision, said Mr Sinclair, and the volume of complaints
brought to his attention concerning haphazard record keeping and the
condition of the buildings left him with the impression that the
proprietors were finding it financially difficult to meet the conditions
required.
He said social work staff were continually requesting the Chaudhrys to
keep proper detailed records of staffing arrangements and expressing
dis-satisfaction with the conditions of the buildings which seemed
''very basic'.
By 1992, the interior of the home was beginning to show signs of wear
and tear which concerned his department, and around that time he learned
that environmental health officials had served an order on the owners
requiring them to rectify hygeine breaches in the kitchen.
Around this time, Dr Chaudhry admitted to him that he was under
financial pressure and was running the venture at a loss, so he decided
to intensify support and supervision.
''I cannot recall any other establishment where that level of visits
was sustained,'' he said.
Mr Sinclair said that by early in 1993, he decided to launch one final
attempt to try to rescue the situation when Dr Chaudhry revealed he was
facing bankruptcy.
The tribunal was adjourned until September.

THE Scottish Landowners' Federation has claimed it has been rebuffed
by the UK Round Table on Sustainable Development, a body chaired by
Environment Secretary John Gummer, which aims to promote economic
development and protect the environment.
Not only was there no representative of Scottish land-management or
farming interests invited to take part in the body's initial meeting of
100 organisations but the core ''round table'' of 25 representatives
contains no UK land-management or agricultural organisations either.
Mr Simon Fraser, director of the federation which has 4000 members in
Scotland, said: ''The land is the very basis of our environment. I find
it astounding that there is no representative of land management
involved and no representation for Scottish land which is so different
from that south of the Border.''
Scotland's interests on the round table are represented by the former
chairman of Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise Ltd (Leel), Sir Charles
Fraser, who is the ex-officio chairman of the Scottish advisory group;
Councillor Irene Gilgallon, of Renfrew District Council; and Mr James
Miller of the Miller Group, representing industry.
When the round table was being set up last year at the instigation of
the Department of the Environment, Mr Fraser wrote expressing his
''surprise and disappointment'' that the SLF was not to be involved.
In a letter to a DoE representative, he said: ''Your officials have
explained to me the need to keep numbers to a reasonable minimum and I
can understand that but, given the priority the Government has placed on
participation by 'agriculture and other landowning interests', I find it
difficult to understand how Scottish land interests should have been
totally excluded.
''Added emphasis must be given to my concern when you take into
account the proportion of the UK land mass formed by Scotland and the
undisputed national and international importance of much of its natural
heritage. Furthermore, the environment in Scotland is very different
from other parts of the UK and it is administered and supervised as you
know by a separate Government department and country agency.''
Mr John Stevens, of the DoE, responded by saying he was sorry that the
department had not been able to invite the SLF or anyone specifically
representing agriculture and landowning interests in Scotland.
''The seminar was limited to about 100 people -- which may sound large
but it had to accommodate people from England, Scotland, Wales, and
Northern Ireland, all the main sectors of the economy, the different
campaign groups for both environmental and other interests, and a
variety of academic institutions and research institutes, together with
a wide variety of public sector bodies including central and local
government and other agencies,'' said Mr Stevens.
Yesterday, it was confirmed that the core group contained no
representatives of land-management or farming interests in the UK.
A DoE spokesman said: ''It is a UK Round Table and is intended to
represent UK interests generally. As it happens, there are three members
who come down from Scotland.''
A Scottish Office spokesman said: ''It is not possible to have
everyone represented round the table when numbers are restricted. When
the round table sets up sub-groups to look into specific areas, it can
co-opt if looking for expertise.''
Mr Fraser said the SLF felt that a fundamental platform for
sustainable development was business and agriculture, and said he would
be writing to Sir Charles Fraser, representing the Scottish Advisory
Group, to express his views.
''Had the federation been invited to participate it would have wanted
to see that these issues were addressed in a sustainable way. That means
environmental sustainability but also sustainability in terms of human
activity. The federation has always been very concerned to see that the
needs of humans and therefore economic activity are borne in mind,
rather along the lines of Scottish Natural Heritage's balancing
duties,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>New guide for child case interviews</HEADLINE>

NEW guidelines were published yesterday aimed at helping to avoid the
mistakes made in interviewing children which were heavily criticised in
the Orkney and South Ayrshire inquiries.
The guidelines, When Children Speak, are aimed at giving police and
social workers detailed guidance on how to set up, conduct and evaluate
interviews in child protection cases.
They were drawn up by a working party set up, by the Scottish
Secretary and the Lord Advocate, in the wake of Lord Clyde's inquiry
into the removal of children in Orkney in 1991.
The working party, chaired by Mr Jim Sinclair, head of the child care
division of the Scottish Office social work services group, included
police, social work and Crown Office representatives and other child
policy experts.
It claims to offer a more comprehensive approach than Home Office
guidelines, which have have been widely criticised.
It draws on the Convention on the Rights of Child, placing the child's
interest at the centre, but not excluding the public interest by
hampering investigation into criminal acts.
For that reason interviewers are told not to make promises of
confidentiality. As well as seeking to avoid further distress for the
child, they should avoid leading questions, coaching and pre-judging.
The whole aim is to elicit as much information as possible and avoid
un-necessary duplication of interviews.
A key recommendation is for more training and development of existing
joint courses for police and social workers.
The working party said it was not intended to set down rules in stone.
Although it is confident the guidelines would avoid another Orkney, it
says they should be updated at least every three years.
The Scottish Office is now inviting interested parties for their
comments on the guidelines.
The initial response from social work leaders was to welcome the
guidance but caution on the overall direction child protection was
taking.

<HEADLINE>Immunity ruled out in Lockerbie row. Plea to Lord Advocate fails over former US intelligence agent</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>WILLIAM TINNING</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>977059908</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
* A New York jury yesterday awarded #1.6m in damages to the parents of
Kenneth Bisset, a US college student killed in the Lockerbie bombing. It
was the second such verdict since courts decided three years ago that
PanAm was liable for damages on the grounds that its security procedures
had failed to prevent a suitcase containing the bomb from being placed
on Flight 103.
THE Lord Advocate yesterday effectively rejected the possibility of a
disgraced former American intelligence agent being granted diplomatic
immunity to allow him to give evidence on the Lockerbie bombing.
Mr Lester Coleman, a former US intelligence agent, has said he is
willing to come to Scotland to give evidence on the outrage provided he
was offered immunity from extradition to the United States.
However, Scotland's senior law officer said yesterday that neither the
Crown Office nor the Scottish Office had any role or authority in
relation to the extradition of Mr Coleman to the US, where warrants have
been issued for his arrest. That was a matter for the Home Office and
the English courts.
The comments by the Lord Advocate, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, made in
a reply to Mr Tam Dalyell, Labour MP for Linlithgow, came on the same
day that former Scottish Office Minister Allan Stewart called for the
former American intelligence agent to be granted immunity from
extradition to allow him to give evidence on the PanAm bombing to a
Scottish court.
Mr Stewart, Conservative MP for Eastwood, speaking on Radio Scotland's
Newsdrive programme yesterday, said: ''I think unquestionably he (Lester
Coleman) should be granted immunity from extradition.
''There are very many questions about the Lockerbie tragedy. He says
he has got very substantial evidence to offer. I cannot see why we in
Britain have anything at all to lose by giving Lester Coleman the
opportunity to put forward that evidence.''
He added: ''The Crown Prosecution Service appears to have decided who
is guilty. I cannot understand why they seem to have this single-track
approach and to be ruling out any other.''
Asked if he believed that the Lockerbie investigation was being
hampered by a cover-up, Mr Stewart said: ''I think it is extremely odd .
. . that other possible avenues of exploration to get at the truth about
Lockerbie simply appear not to be being explored. That cannot be
right.''
Mr Stewart's plea came just a few days after Mr Dalyell urged the Lord
Advocate to give diplomatic immunity to Mr Coleman to uncover the part
he claimed the US played in the Lockerbie tragedy.
Mr Dalyell said Mr Coleman was willing to speak to Scottish police
about an alleged security loophole set up by the US which resulted in a
bomb being placed on PanAm flight 103 at Frankfurt airport.
Mr Coleman's theory of a link with a drugs run from Lebanon through
Cyprus and Germany was the conclusion of a book about him by Mr Donald
Goddard, called The Trail of the Octopus. The book is now the subject of
a libel action by another US agent.
Mr Coleman believes the bomb got on to the jet because US intelligence
agents in Beirut in 1988 agreed with Lebanese terrorists to facilitate a
route for drugs from Lebanon to the US in exchange for information about
Western hostages.
Luggage containing drugs was protected by US intelligence, with normal
security restrictions on baggage at airports removed. However, he
alleges, the terrorists exploited the loophole by exchanging a bag of
drugs with a bag containing a bomb at Frankfurt airport.
Mr Coleman was based in Beirut at the time and often travelled to
Cyprus, where he had dealings with the American Drug Enforcement Agency.
Shortly after the book was published in 1993, Mr Coleman was indicted
on charges of perjury and travelling on a false passport. He fled the US
and is now in hiding.
The Lord Advocate, in his written reply to Mr Dalyell, the contents of
which were published yesterday, explained that the Crown's position was
based on evidence, and that careful consideration was given to any
information received and appropriate investigations carried out.
In reply to Mr Dalyell's request that Mr Coleman be allowed to enter
the UK with the promise of immunity from extradition to talk with the
police, the Lord Advocate, says: ''Neither the Crown Office nor Scottish
Office has any role or authority in relation to extradition to the
United States.
''The procedures for extradition as between the United Kingdom and the
United States are the responsibility of the Home Office and the English
courts.''
Mr Dalyell said he found it ''extraordinarily odd'' that
responsibility for extradition in Scotland was a matter for the Home
Office and the English courts.
The MP said: ''Two Scottish lawyers have told me that they thought
extradition and immunity from extradition north of the Border would be
the responsibility of the Crown Office or the Scottish Office.
''The Lord Advocate's statement has certainly raised eyebrows in
Scottish legal circles.''

SCOTLAND'S best known criminal defence lawyer, Joe Beltrami, has
retired as the senior partner of the Glasgow legal firm he founded 38
years ago.
However, last night the 63-year-old solicitor advocate said that he
would continue to work for Beltrami &amp; Co. as a full-time consultant.
The lawyer, whose name has been synonymous with every major criminal
case for decades and has become a Scottish legal institution, said the
move was merely to allow him to spend more time on court work rather
than on the day to day running of the firm he founded, two years after
qualifying, in 1958.
Speaking from his home in Bothwell, Mr Beltrami stressed he was not
stepping out of the limelight.
''It is not as if I am disappearing from the scene, I am as busy as
ever. It is just that I have retired from the partnership, in that I am
now working full-time as a consultant with the same firm.
''At my age, I think having run the firm for 38 years is long enough.
I think it is time for my younger partners to take over. I am not
throwing in the towel. I don't think I ever will. I am enjoying it as
much as I have always done.''
Famous as the hard man's choice, Mr Beltrami's career in criminal law
began more by accident than design when, after graduating from Glasgow
University, the Roman Catholic law student was unable to find a practice
to take him on as an apprentice. He qualified in 1956 and two years
later set up on his own in an office in Buchanan Street. Reportedly his
first fee was #5, the amount of cash his client could afford.
Since then he has instructed in more than 500 murder trials, the names
of his clients reading like a roll call of Scotland's underworld. His
clients have ranged from loyalist and republican terrorists to infamous
Glasgow criminals such as the late Arthur Thompson.
Asked to recall some of the more outstanding cases, Mr Beltrami said
there had been too many to single out one. However, he said the toughest
had been winning a Royal pardon in 1976 for Paddy Meehan, who had been
jailed for life in 1969 for the murder of pensioner Rachel Ross during a
break-in at her home in Ayr.
Mr Beltrami's decision to retire as a partner surprised the legal
profession.
Mr Donald Findlay, QC, said: ''I always imagined that, someday,
someone would have to take him outside and shoot him, but since he is
going to be carrying on as full-time consultant no doubt he will still
be around the courts as large as life and as full of being Joe as ever.
''His track record is second to none in terms of criminal cases.
''I think it is also worth noting that, in all the years he has been
in practice, Joe has never opened branch offices. Clients always came to
him, he didn't have to go looking for clients.''
Lawyer Ross Harper, who started his own practice two years after Mr
Beltrami, added: ''Joe Beltrami is an institution, not only in Glasgow,
but in Scotland.''

Alexandra MacRae highlights the difficulties Scotland's ethnic
minorities face in trying to be reunited, even for short periods, with
relatives from abroad
SUMMERTIME is here, the sun shines and the birds sing; Scotland's
tourist traps are thronging with visitors from Europe and beyond.
Many may be returning expatriates or the children or grandchildren of
emigres coming to be reunited with family and friends in the ''old
country''. A happy time -- except perhaps for many of the New Scots,
Scotland's ethnic minority communities numbering more than 45,000 souls
and whose family reunions are fraught with difficulty.
The source of their problem is all too often the interpretation of the
Immigration Rules by our zealous Home Office officials, and in
particular the crucial Rule 41, which reads as follows:
''The requirements to be met by a person seeking leave to enter the
United Kingdom as a visitor are that he:
(i) is genuinely seeking entry as a visitor for a limited period as
stated by him, not exceeding six months; and
(ii) intends to leave the United Kingdom at the end of the period of
the visit as stated by him; and
(iii) does not intend to take employment in the United Kingdom; and
(iv) does not intend to produce goods or provide services within the
United Kingdom, including the selling of goods and services direct to
members of the public; and
(v) does not intend to study at a maintained school; and
(vi) will maintain and accommodate himself and any dependants
adequately out of resources available to him without recourse to public
funds or taking employment; or will, with any dependants, be maintained
and accommodated adequately by relatives and friends; and
(vii) can meet the cost of the return and onward journey.''
Let us look at some cases.
* Thirty-five years ago Mr Gul Shah left the Indian subcontinent as a
young man and, like many before him, went to work in a factory in a
large town in central Scotland. He worked hard all his life but never
made the fortune he dreamed about. Now, however, he is retired and a
respected senior member of the Asian community. His family did him proud
and his two older children run successful businesses, his two younger
children going to university and entering the professions.
In early 1994 Mr Shah fell seriously ill with a heart complaint and
underwent surgery. His family had often heard him talk about his
favourite younger brother Wazir, who had stayed behind in Pakistan and
whom Mr Shah rarely saw. To cheer their father up during his
convalescence, Gul Shah's sons conceived a plan to reunite the two
brothers by arranging a visit to Scotland for Wazir.
But Wazir, by our standards, is a poor man. With another brother he
runs a small business in the Punjab, through which he supports his wife
and several children. So, while on holiday in Pakistan, one of Mr Shah's
sons helped Wazir to fill in an application form for a visa, and rang
the visa section of the UK High Commission in Islamabad to try to sort
out the formalities.
The procedure for obtaining a visa (or more properly ''Entrance
Clearance'') entails, for some people in Pakistan, a journey of hundreds
of miles from the applicant's home to Islamabad or Karachi, where
applicants queue from 7am to be interviewed.
Each Entry Clearance Officer (ECO) is expected to conduct 11
interviews per day and is accompanied by an interpreter who may (or may
not) render an accurate account of the questions into the applicant's
own language and an accurate translation of the replies back to the ECO.
In Wazir's case, some time after his long, exhaustive and expensive
journey to Islamabad and back, he received a communication from the ECO
refusing his application.
The letter tartly stated that: '' . . . I do not consider that the
financial outlay and length of time you plan to be away are commensurate
with the benefits which your visit to the UK might bring. Furthermore,
you state that you are very close to your brother in the UK, but have
seen him only two or three times in the last 35 years and know
relatively little about his circumstances. I am not satisfied,
therefore, that you are genuinely seeking entry for the period stated by
you.''
When an appeal was lodged against this decision to the Second
Secretary (Immigration) at the High Commission, among other prim
observations Wazir was told: ''Furthermore there is the point that . . .
Wazir is 'impoverished'. He helps his brother in a general store'' (a
tailor's shop, actually) ''and has a wife and several children to
support. Surely it is strange that he is prepared to go off on a
three-month visit abroad and even more strange that his wealthy nephews
should facilitate this, when the money spent on the air fare alone could
ameliorate that families (sic) circumstances for months to come.''
In fact, Wazir's ''wealthy nephews'' have often, in accordance with
the Pakistani custom of sharing resources with the extended family,
offered to help Wazir and his brother, but the offers have been politely
rejected as Wazir considers that his earnings are sufficient for his
family's modest needs. His fault in the eyes of the Home Office is, it
seems, that he is a poor man.
* Fatima Bibi lives in Sialkot in the Punjab. This 81-year-old lady
lives adjacent to her daughter who is married to Shaikh Mohammed, a
librarian at the local technical college. Fatima Bibi had a son who
died, leaving a widow and two children who now live with Shaikh Mohammed
and his family. Her other son is a cheerful extrovert who works in
Dundee on the buses, and she also has a nephew in Perth.
In the past, her bus driver son successfully sponsored two visits by
his mother to Dundee. But in August 1992, when she applied to visit her
son along with her two Pakistani grandchildren, she was refused a visa.
Early in 1994 she applied again, this time leaving out the two
grandchildren because she considered that they were, perhaps, a
complication. Again she was refused entry clearance by the ECO in
Islamabad who stated, among other censorious observations: ''I believe
your credibility to be seriously flawed. You live alone in Pakistan.''
The inference is that Fatima Bibi's motive in seeking entry clearance
is to stay in the UK permanently, becoming a burden on public funds
because she lives alone in Pakistan -- a statement which flies in the
face of her circumstances in Sialkot, which were surely already on the
High Commission's file.
In the autumn of 1994 she applied for entry clearance again, and was
refused once more. This time, the ECO concluded: ''In the light of
this'' (referring to a catalogue of misconceptions) ''I have to conclude
that your family are prepared to go to extreme lengths to secure the
admission of a family member to the UK. In conclusion I am not satisfied
that you have discharged the onus incumbent upon you to satisfy me that
you are a genuine visitor seeking entry for a limited period.''
After this interview the octogenarian collapsed and was seriously ill.
As Fatima Bibi had visited the United Kingdom twice already and returned
home both times, it is difficult to understand why an elderly, frail
woman who had spent her entire life in Pakistan, living in reasonably
comfortable circumstances in the bosom of her family, should suddenly
decide to spend her declining years in a tenement flat in a cold
northern city.
* Mrs Nasreen Hussein also lives in rural Punjab. She has twice
visited her in-laws in Dundee and has twice returned, as one might
expect, to husband, children and large extended family in Pakistan. She
has neither the motive nor the desire to abandon her secure if modest
surroundings in Pakistan in order to try her luck among the ranks of the
four million unemployed in Britain.
Invited by her family, in November 1994 she submitted an application
on behalf of her two younger sons and herself for entry clearance to the
UK for another visit. Her sponsor on this occasion was her husband's
sister-in-law, Mrs Fatima Akhtar, who owns several substantial
commercial properties in Tayside from which she derives rent income.
Mrs Akhtar signed an affidavit on behalf of her sister-in-law stating
that she would be entirely responsible for Mrs Hussein's accommodation
and maintenance during the visit, and (if necessary) would pay her
repatriation expenses.
To support this, Mrs Akhtar submitted evidence of her financial
resources in the form of bank statements and copies of the valuation
roll showing that she was the registered owner of several properties. On
this occasion, however, her application for entry clearance was turned
down because ''you claim that you will stay with your husband's brother
and that he will support you while you are there. However, I have seen
no evidence that he is in a position to support and accommodate you . .
.''
This came despite the fact that the High Commission had evidence of Mr
Akhtar's substance on file from her previous successful applications.
Consequently I wrote on behalf of Mrs Hussein to the ECO, pointing out
that perhaps he had misread the application; the sponsor of the visitor
on this occasion was not Mr but Mrs Akhtar, which is why a considerable
amount of documentation relative to Mrs Akhtar's resources had been sent
to him.
This produced a reiteration of the ECO's other argument: ''She claimed
that her husband (Mr Hussein) would be paying for the visit himself . .
. Her husband only earned Rs 5000 (#100) per year . . . there appeared
to be no compelling reason to undertake this visit at such a vast
expense and I therefore refuse the application.''
The problem lies with Immigration Rule 41, quoted earlier, which is
couched in terms that make it impossible for anyone to underwrite a
visitor's travel and accommodation expenses -- which creates
difficulties when Pakistani custom obliges the host to defray all the
vistor's costs.
Fatima Bibi was asked at one of her three unsuccessful interviews if
she was ''supported by her son'', the questioner wanting to know if her
bus driver son from Dundee sent her money. She replied in the
affirmative. At a subsequent interview she was asked if she was
supported by her son. She said that she was not; that she was entirely
supported by her son-in-law, the librarian from Sialkot. On this
occasion the nervous and confused old lady meant that he was
''supporting'' her as he was at her side at the interview. The ECO
pounced on this apparent inconsistency.
At another interview a client was asked: ''Have you been here
before?'' ''No,'' she replied -- thinking that they meant had she been
in the upstairs room of a the annexe in which she was being interviewed,
as opposed to the cubicle where she had been interviewed before a
previous visit to the UK. The ECO then produced evidence of that visit
with a flourish.
If you examine the standard refusal form issued by the Home Office,
there is a box for the ECO to write the reason for his refusal.
Underneath the box is printed the words: ''I am not satisfied,
therefore, that you are genuinely seeking entry for the period as stated
by you.''
One is drawn to the inescapable conclusion from the format of the
refusal form that every interview is structured to produce the desired
result from the Home Office's point of view. If by intense and loaded
questioning you can make nervous applicants slip up or contradict
themselves, you can then throw doubt on all their answers, and their
honesty.
What caps this injustice is that there is now no right of appeal
against the decision of an immigration officer. Until 1994 the aggrieved
applicant, through his or her sponsor in the UK, could appeal to an
adjudicator who would consider the decision of ECO and scrutinise the
notes of the interview, and further representations would take place.
But even this potential remedy was swept away by the Asylum and
Immigration Appeals Act 1993, and now all the aggrieved party can do is
try for a judicial review of the ECO's decision in the Court of Session
at prohibitive expense -- with no guarantee of a successful outcome.
Several years of practice of immigration law convinces me that the
practice of immigration officials in British Diplomatic Missions in most
Asian and African countries with a tradition of inward migration to the
UK is no different to the High Commission in Islamabad.
It is noteworthy that I receive no requests for assistance from
clients who have had difficulty with officialdom when bringing over
relatives from Canada, Australia, New Zealand or other countries where
the Caucasian races predominate.
So, this holiday season when you go to the airport to greet your
cousins from abroad, if they have black or brown faces you should be
prepared for a long wait.

Jennifer Cunningham explains how moves to curb immigration by the back
door are affecting many genuine would-be visitors to this country
SINCE May last year, it has not been possible to appeal against
decisions to refuse visas for visitors to the UK. While immigration to
the UK has become increasingly difficult over the past 25 years, that
change more than any has incensed British citizens with relatives in the
Indian subcontinent, Africa and the Caribbean.
There are several requirements for people who want permission to come
to the UK as visitors. They have to state that the visit will be for a
limited period not exceeding six months and that they do not intend to
take up employment or go into business or study at a maintained school.
They have to maintain and accommodate themselves and any dependants from
their own resources or be maintained and accommodated by relatives or
friends, and must show they can fund the cost of the return journey.
The decisions are made by entry clearance officers employed by the UK
Government to vet applications in the countries concerned. Since the
right of appeal was removed, lawyers and advisory services in the UK
have been inundated with requests for help from people furious that
their relatives have been refused permission to visit, despite being
able to meet the conditions.
Syed Masood Nabi, senior immigration counsellor for Scotland with the
Immigration Advisory Service, a Government-funded but independent body,
believes hundreds of families in the UK have been deprived of visits
from relatives since appeals were scrapped.
''Decisions are now being made on suspicions rather than facts,'' says
Mr Nabi. ''If someone is over 55 years old and has four or five children
in their own country, why would they not want to go back after visiting
one child here? Very often, the reason given for refusal by the entry
clearance officer is that the person does not have adequate resources,
but arguments against such decisions cannot be heard, even when it is
obvious that the relative in the UK is well able to provide for their
visitors.''
The intention of the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act 1993 was to
prevent immigration by the back door of people who would become a burden
on the public, but the provision for monitoring its working amounts to
little more than a tally of statistics. Kathleen Bolt, solicitor with
the Ethnic Minority Law Centre in Glasgow, said: ''There is no scrutiny
of individual decisions -- all realtives can do is write a letter.''
Allowing appeals would not solve the problem, however, according to
Alexandra MacRae, the Dundee solicitor who has taken up a number of
recent cases. ''The appeals were heard in Glasgow and were based on an
interview which had usually taken place in Islamabad. Very often the
adjudicator had to say he was very sympathetic but since he was not at
the interview was loth to overturn the judgments made there. The rules
themselves need to be changed.
''A number of Asian families have suggested to me that they would be
willing to lodge a caution as guarantee of their relatives' good
behaviour. There is also the possibility of attaching more
responsibility to the people in this country rather than those
visiting,'' she said.

PATIENT care will inevitably suffer as a result of cuts being mooted
by Aberdeen Royal Hospitals Trust, health union Unison claimed
yesterday.
However, the claim was rejected by the trust which, along with its
main purchasers Grampian Health Board and local GP fundholders,
emphatically denied there is any cashflow crisis because of a delay in
negotiating contracts.
The contracts between the board, the trust, and the GP fundholders run
over the financial year and as yet have not been agreed.
Yesterday a trust spokesman said it expected the contracts to be
concluded within a fortnight.
Mr Gordon Paterson, director of public health for Grampian Health
Board, said that it had been allocated #386m by the Scottish Office for
health care services and had numerous contracts to agree with the trust.
Mr Paterson added that he was concerned that the ''rather alarmist
stories about bankruptcy'' might lead patients awaiting treatment to
fear that they might not now be called, or that their treatment would be
inferior.
A leaked document suggests that the Government is seeking a 1% cut in
the trust's spending but a trust spokesman said this was not the case.
Every trust was asked annually to look for efficiency savings and it was
the trust which had asked all departments to put forward proposals for a
1% cut in costs. Some of the proposals would be accepted, some rejected,
but patient care would not be affected.
An NHS Executive spokesman said that no offers of money had been made
by the executive to the trust. He stressed it was the health board which
paid the trust and it would have to sort out its own contracts through
negotiations.
Mr Ken Macmillan, Unison's Grampian full-time officer, said there were
references in the document to ''good housekeeping'' as if patients were
''commodities like tins of beans,'' claiming that pressure for
efficiency measures had increased administration cost from 6% to 10%
under the Tories.
Last night Labour's Scottish health spokesman Mr John McAllion
demanded an urgent meeting with Mr Geoff Scaife, the chief executive of
the NHS in Scotland, for a full briefing on the situation in Aberdeen
and to ask what steps are being taken to protect patient care and
prevent bed and ward closures and ensure operations are not delayed for
financial reasons.

A SENIOR police officer from Minsk in Belarus who is investigating the
deaths of two of Aberdeen District Council's most senior officials is
planning to fly to the city to interview those who were at the scene.
His inquiries are to enable the Belarus authorities to decide whether
any criminal proceedings should be initiated.
The officer was understood to have been due to arrive in Aberdeen
today but he has been delayed.
Last night Ms Anne Mearns, the council's chief executive, said she was
aware that there had been a preliminary approach with a view to the
officer coming to Aberdeen but she was not aware of any final
arrangements having been made.
Grampian police, although not involved in the inquiry, are understood
to have been assisting the police in Minsk. Initially, the visiting
officer was expected today and that was changed to Sunday. That arrival
time also has been postponed and it is not clear when he will arrive.
It was anticipated that the city's twinning officer, Alison Cameron,
would assist with translation during the officer's interviews.
Ms Mearns said that those at the scene of the tragedy had been
interviewed in Belarus as part of the preliminary inquiry by police.
The officer was now investigating on behalf of the Belarus equivalent
of the Scottish Crown Office to decide whether any criminal charges
should be brought as a result of the deaths.
Ms Ann Hughes, the council's deputy chief executive, and Mr Iain
McDonald, the principal environmental health officer, died while
swimming in a river near Gomel at the end of a leisure day on a business
trip to Aberdeen's twin city.
The two were part of a council team looking at ways of helping Gomel,
which is in the area worst affected by the Chernobyl disaster.

A CITY dealer for a Japanese finance firm, who is claiming
constructive dismissal on the grounds of sex discrimination, broke down
in tears yesterday as she spoke of her experiences at the company.
Ms Helen Bamber, 32, earned #17,000 less than a male colleague at Fuji
International Finance, and claims she suffered constant discrimination.
Miss Bamber, of Hampstead, north London, joined the firm in the City
of London as a graduate trainee in 1986 but resigned in April 1994 after
three salesmen were appointed to take over her responsibilities.
The industrial tribunal in Croydon, south London, heard she earned
#43,000 a year while a male colleague earned #60,000. She also did not
have a performance-related bonus in her contract like many male members
of staff did.
Miss Bamber told the tribunal yesterday that she had discovered a memo
concerning her performance at work.
Her voice broke as she read out the memo and she started to cry.
The memo read: ''I believe she is already looking for another job and
may have already been offered one, and she is trying to get some easy
money from FIF.''
Miss Bamber then looked directly across the room at FIF deputy
managing director Michael Cole and demanded: ''How dare you! How dare
you!''
She said she had gone to see Mr Cole when she was very upset after
hearing another salesman had been made ''an offer he couldn't refuse'',
as well as bonuses and a company car, to stay on at the firm.
The tribunal has heard that FIF deputy managing director Kazuo Matsuda
pretended to fall asleep when Miss Bamber asked for a pay rise.
She also claimed company director Tak Yoshida told her to resign after
she rejected his sexual advances during a business trip.
Miss Bamber told the tribunal that, between 1988 and 1994, only one
woman had been recruited and she had stayed only one year. Five men had
joined the company in that period.
''Despite a fairly lengthy time at the company, the promotion history
of women seems remarkably slow, particularly relative to some of the
promotions of the men.''
Miss Bamber said that, in 1990, she sold #173,100 worth of business,
had a salary of #40,000, and was awarded a #3250 bonus, 6% of her annual
pay.
A male colleague of the same age and experience sold a similar amount
of business in 1993, #170,990, but earned #52,000 and received a #15,000
bonus -- 29% of his pay.
Miss Bamber said that, in 1991, she earned 68% of the company's
average salary but by 1993 this had dropped sharply to 54%.
She went on to accuse Mr Matsuda, the former deputy managing director,
of being blatantly sexist, keeping a calendar showing topless European
women on his desk, and seeming to prefer Japanese women because they
were more deferential towards him.
The hearing continues.

<HEADLINE>Ian Lang accused of abdicating his responsibility by approving plan. Appeal judges quash housing blueprint for Strathclyde</HEADLINE>

STRATHCLYDE Regional Council's housing blueprint has been torpedoed by
a legal ruling, despite warnings the decision could lead to chaos.
Judges have quashed the Strathclyde Structure Plan Update 1992 and
accused former Scottish Secretary Ian Lang of abdicating his
responsibility in the way he approved the plan.
They also stated the ruling means anyone who had an appeal decided
against them on the basis of the 1992 update could reapply in the light
of a change of circumstances, namely that the 1992 update had now been
quashed.
In June 1993, the region submitted to the Secretary of State the 1992
update, which revised housing policies for the area.
There were objections by the Scottish House-Builders Association and
others but Mr Lang approved the update without alterations and it came
into force in May last year.
Since then, it has been used as the basis for decisions on planning
applications, appeals, and decisions on local plan inquiries.
The SHBA challenged Mr Lang's approval of the update at the Court of
Session, where the case was heard by Lords Allanbridge, Sutherland, and
Mayfield.
Issuing the court's decision yesterday, Lord Sutherland said that in
the update the region had calculated land supply for housebuilding at
60,822 dwellings, which meant a surplus of supply over demand for
private housing.
The SHBA produced a figure of 44,218 dwellings, which amounted to a
shortage of supply over demand.
Strathclyde had used its own criteria to calculate its figures, while
the SHBA figures were based on guidelines issued by the Secretary of
State.
The house builders complained that, in approving the 1992 update, the
Secretary of State appeared not to have paid any regard to his own
guidelines. If he did pay attention to them, he had failed to explain
why Strathclyde's criteria should be preferred.
The Scottish Secretary argued that it was premature to become involved
in a dispute about the proper way to calculate land supply because a
more comprehensive review than the 1992 update was currently under way.
That review would be presented to him this autumn and that would be
the proper time to decide on criteria to be used.
However, the judges ruled that Mr Lang's decision to delay
consideration of the matter was fatally flawed.
Lord Sutherland said: ''When national policy guidelines have been
produced which directly conflict with the criteria adopted by
Strathclyde region and which confirm the methodology adopted by the
SHBA, there appears to be no valid reason as to why a decision on this
matter should be deferred.
''To do so simply constitutes an abdication of responsibility in an
area where the Secretary of State must take a decision.
''By approving these figures without modification, the Secretary of
State has, in effect, approved a regime which will last for at least two
years, assuming the 1994 review is eventually brought forward and
approved by 1996.
''All planning decisions by Strathclyde region will be based on the
figures contained in that document and it may well be, therefore, that
these decisions will be reached on a basis which may be unjustified.
This is plainly a matter of considerable importance to the SHBA.''
The judges said it had been unreasonable for the Scottish Secretary to
abdicate his responsibility and they were satisfied that his approval of
the 1992 update could not stand.
It was argued by the region that quashing the update would result in
chaos but the judges stated: ''Developers are entitled to rely upon the
integrity of the structure plan and should not be expected to operate in
an environment where the plan has been held to have been wrongly
approved but still remains in force for the purpose of planning
applications and appeals.
''Whether the update is quashed or not, it is inevitable that there
will be some adverse effect on some parties. The balance, however, in
our view, lies clearly in favour of saying that an update, which has not
properly received approval by the Secretary of State, should not be
permitted to remain in force for any period longer than is necessary.''
Mr Alastair Landells, land and planning officer at the Scottish
House-Builders Association, said it was delighted with the ruling --
which it believed was the first Structure Plan to be quashed in Scotland
in 20 years -- but would not have taken the matter to the Court of
Session if it did not think it had a strong case.
''We are delighted because our approach to land supply was much more
realistic than that of Strathclyde Regional Council's. In theory, this
means that 16,000 more houses could be required, based on March 1992
figures,'' he said.
It is understood that green-belt land will not be affected by the
ruling because it is protected by national policy guidelines.
A Scottish Office spokesman said: ''The full terms of the judgment
will have to be examined carefully to assess its possible implications.
No comment can be offered until such time as this has been completed.''
A spokeswoman for Strathclyde Regional Council said: ''Not having seen
a copy of the judgment, we can't comment in any detail but, when we have
seen it, we will see what effect it is likely to have.''
He added that the ruling could mean there would have to be changes in
the allocation of land for house building but stressed this was only
speculation.

HUNDREDS of school pupils throughout Scotland yesterday swamped a
student helpline organisation for advice after receiving their exam
results.
Student Choice, now in its third year of operation, was inundated with
calls, said senior official Ms Rose McKendry, who added that they
expected more calls as results arrive.
It took 1400 calls from pupils either asking for advice on appealing,
or for information of alternative courses.
The Scottish Examination Board announced yesterday that 124,274
candidates sat their exams, 64,130 at standard grade.
Almost 60,000 passed standard grade examinations after taking four
subjects. Two pupils managed success in 12 subjects.
In the Higher grade range, those sitting four subjects totalled 9994.
Two brighter than average Scottish pupils achieved seven Higher grade
subject passes, which is exactly the same as last year.
Besides the Student Choice helpline (free phone number 0800 100900),
the Royal Mail has set up its own for queries over possible non-delivery
of results. It is 0131-458-8648/8650.
The student helpline is funded by the Scottish Education Department,
with assistance from Scottish Enterprise.
Last night, Ms McKendry said: ''By the end of the week, we expect to
have a clearer picture of students who are either unhappy about their
results, wish to appeal, or have information on alternative courses.
''The response has been overwhelming, but we are here to offer
advice.''
This year, she said, 1800 university places were available, along with
1000 places at HND standard.

A HUSBAND who claimed he was henpecked into a hold-up walked free from
court yesterday.
Phillip Wardle, 28, faced a jail sentence for attempting to rob a
postmistress with a toy gun, but Judge Lord Prosser at the High Court in
Glasgow ordered him to do 200 hours community service instead.
Wardle, of High Street, New Pitsligo, Aberdeenshire, appeared before
the judge in Inverness three weeks ago when he admitted attempting to
raid a post office in Ballindalloch, Speyside.
He claimed in court that he had been driven to the crime after
constant abuse from his wife, Pamela, who repeatedly nagged him about
not bringing enough cash into the house.
Lord Prosser heard allegations that during Wardle's stormy six- year
marriage Wardle's wife had hit him with a frying pan.
The couple had run up debts of #10,000 and she warned him she would
walk out if he didn't get a better paid job, it was claimed.
Wardle, the court heard, finally snapped while going home from his job
in a fish processing factory.
He changed into his work gear, a boiler suit, hat, and hair-net,
pulled the hair-net over his face as a mask, and went into the post
office with a toy pistol he had bought for his two sons.
However, when he pointed the gun at the postmistress and demanded
money, she simply waved him off. Three hours later, he telephoned police
in Aberdeen and confessed.
Lord Prosser said he was not forming any view about the rights and
wrongs of the matter but acknowledged there was stress on both sides.

HIGHLAND region's education committee members are being advised
against installing condom vending machines in its secondary schools for
use by senior pupils, despite clear support for the move from many
parents.
A report from the region's depute director of education, Mr Jack
Findlay, which will be considered by the committee next week, tells
councillors, however, that they should support any plans Highland Health
Board might bring forward to improve availability of condoms outwith
school.
Mr Findlay's paper recalls research done by the education authority
for the health board two years ago which found that 39% of young people
in their fourth year at secondary school had had sexual intercourse.
This had raised the issues of condom availability in view of the
concerns about the spread of HIV/Aids and the incidence of teenage
pregnancy/abortion.
Further research had examined parental attitudes with a sample of 1200
households.
This established that more than 90% of parents believed schools should
tell their young people all the ways HIV is transmitted and all the ways
of reducing risk of infection including the use of condoms.
Only one in five parents believed that young people should be told not
to have sex until they are married; while more than 90% believed they
should be told where contraception is available.
According to Mr Findlay's paper: ''Over half the parents believed that
condom machines should be sited in the senior toilets in secondary
schools, and in community centre or village hall toilets; over half
believed that school pupils should be able to obtain condoms from the
school doctor or nurse; almost nine in 10 believed it would be
worthwhile making condoms available to young people if it stopped one
girl getting pregnant; and only one in 20 believed that if it is
difficult for young people to get condoms it will put them off having
sex.''
The paper concludes: ''Parents would appear to feel strongly that
either the health board or the education authority, or both, should take
action to ensure that young people have easier access to condoms.
''This is an issue that would appear to have particular force in more
rural areas.''
However, there would be difficulties in introducing the machines into
secondary schools.
''Firstly, few secondary schools have designated senior toilets. Even
where they do, it would be difficult to prevent condoms from these
machines being widely available to the whole school population, bringing
with it the implication that the authority is condoning, if not
encouraging, under-age sex.
''Secondary heads who have been consulted are strongly opposed to any
such move, foreseeing the practical problems as well as the moral
issue.''

THE chairman of the National Lottery Charities Board is facing calls
for his resignation after saying he was ''extremely impatient'' with
deaf people.
Mr David Sieff came under fire after telling an interviewer the deaf
did not have the same ''emotive appeal'' as the blind.
Labour MP George Foulkes said Mr Sieff, 56, a director of Marks &amp;
Spencer, should ''consider his position'' at the NLCB.
Lord Ashley, the deaf former Labour MP and president of the Royal
National Institute for Deaf People, condemned the remarks as
''deplorable'', ''unacceptable'', and ''astonishing''.
Mr Sieff said he was wary of suggestions that the public should be
allowed to decide which charities benefited from the lottery.
''If that happened, the grants might all end up going to four
favourite charities,'' he said. ''Personally, I'm terribly kind to the
blind but I'm extremely impatient with the deaf. The deaf don't have the
same emotive appeal.''
A spokeswoman for the NLCB said Mr Sieff's remarks had been taken out
of context.
However, Mr Foulkes, MP for Carrick, Cumnock, and Doon Valley, was
unimpressed.
''He certainly should be considering his position in view of the
reaction to what he has said -- it's an amazing thing to say,'' said Mr
Foulkes.
''This is just the latest in a series of gaffes for the lottery.
Certainly, I think a lot of people in my constituency are starting to
think that it is going off the rails.''
Lord Ashley said he had asked Mr Sieff for an explanation, and added:
''I wouldn't go as far as to call for his resignation but the comments
are deplorable and unacceptable.
''I've written to him asking for an explanation of his comments and
also asking him for a categorical assurance that funds will be allocated
fairly between deaf and blind people. It was an astonishing thing to
say.''
Mr Doug Alker, chief executive of the institute, added: ''The National
Lottery Charities Board has responsibility for the impartial and
objective allocation of funds.
''It is therefore a cause for grave concern that the chair of the
board should express potentially damaging and biased remarks in such a
public manner.''
The NLCB spokeswoman said: ''The aim of (Mr Sieff's) comment was to
illustrate that the more emotive causes can sometimes engender greater
public support.''
She added that every application would be considered on its merits.

UNITED NATIONS: Libya, citing what it called its friendship with

Security Council starting next year.
The appeal was contained in a note sent recently to almost all UN
members. Britain, the US, and France have been campaigning to prevent
Libya from winning a seat on the Security Council because it is the
target of UN sanctions imposed over Tripoli's failure to surrender two
suspects in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing.

Pensacola
HURRICANE Erin roared through America's southern coast today, pounding
Florida for a second time with winds gusting at over 100mph and sheets
of rain.
Thousands of residents and tourists fled inland as the storm got its
second wind.
''We know there are roofs that have blown off houses. We have trees
down everywhere,'' said Santa Rosa County emergency management chief Tom
Roche. ''Major power cuts, boats sunk, things like that.''
Transformers exploded, hundreds of trees were uprooted for miles,
street signs were toppled, and emergency officials received some reports
of serious building damage as the eye moved inland.
It caught by surprise many who had expected it to go further west.
''This is a storm that could really hurt people,'' warned Governor
Lawton Chiles.
People who defied an evacuation order of coastal areas near Pensacola,
Florida, were asked to sign a statement releasing Escambia County from
liability, said Ric Ruminski, Pensacola Beach fire battalion chief.
''It's a scare tactic,'' he said. ''I suggested they be forced to wear
a tag on their toe.''
The Gulf Power Company said 63% of its customers -- about 480,000
people -- had no electricity.
By this afternoon, Erin's wide eye was centred about 20 miles east of
Mobile, Alabama, after sliding over Pensacola, Florida, the National
Hurricane Centre said. Thousands of people had been evacuated from the
narrow Alabama coast.
The storm's route past Mobile aimed it through largely rural territory
of farms, swamps and small communities, some of which held people who
had fled the coast.
Erin was moving north-west at about 14mph, which would take it through
southern Alabama, southern Mississippi and into central Louisiana
tonight.
On its earlier charge from the Atlantic across the Florida Peninsula,
Erin sank two ships, left five people missing at sea, and cut off
electricity to one million people. Two people died during preparations
for the hurricane.
The storm weakened during its passage across land and was downgraded
to a tropical storm, but regained strength after sliding out to the warm
Gulf of Mexico yesterday. It then headed north-west to sections of
Florida along the northern Gulf coast.
In Alabama, Lee Helms, director of the state Emergency Management
Agency, estimated at least 100,000 people had been evacuated.
In south-eastern Louisiana, site of a once-in-a-century flood three
months ago, more than 9000 residents had been ordered to evacuate.
A 44-year-old Georgia man and his nine-year-old daughter disappeared
in the Gulf after leaving Florida's Port San Blas in an inflatable
rubber raft with oars. Gulf County Sheriff Frank McKeithen said neither
of the rafters was wearing a life jacket.
A gambling ship captain and two crew members went down with their
vessel yesterday in high seas off Cape Canaveral on the Atlantic Coast.
A tugboat sank off Georgia during the storm but all five aboard were
rescued.--AP.

Colombo
SRI Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga said today that her
government was ready to ''shun the lust for power'' and offer devolution
to minority Tamils, who have been neglected since the end of British
rule.
In a televised address to the nation formally announcing her peace
plan, she promised all communities equal rights and said Sri Lanka's
unity was assured by long-awaited devolution of powers to the Tamils to
try to end a protracted separatist war.
''During the 50 years since the end of the colonial era, the
aspirations of the Tamil people were not adequately fulfilled within the
parameters of the political process,'' she said.
Sri Lankans were now ready to cast off the burden of previous failed
efforts to settle Tamil grievances, she added.
''We who have been entrusted with the governance of this country are
equally ready to shun the lust for power, the instrumentality of
state-sponsored violence, and the pursuit of narrow, short-term
political gain,'' she said.
Kumaratunga earlier said that her People's Alliance government and
minority parties had accepted the proposals and she hoped the opposition
United National Party would also support it.
Kumaratunga was swept to power in elections last year largely on her
promise to end the 12-year-old war against the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE), who are fighting for a separate state in the north
and east of the island.
Kumaratunga has already won international support for her efforts to
end the war in which more than 50,000 people have been killed since
1983.--Reuter.

Jerusalem
JEWISH settlers fighting running battles with Israeli soldiers over
control of hilltops in the West Bank declared a three-day truce at one
of the sites today.
The truce, which settlers said was called at the request of President
Ezer Weizman, came minutes after Israeli soldiers began dragging away
the settlers, who are campaigning against a planned expansion of
Palestinian self-rule in the occupied territory.
''We will leave here for three days during which we'll talk among
ourselves . . . President Weizman in the middle of everything asked to
stop everything for three days and to think,'' settler spokeswoman
Michal Shrut told reporters.
For four days, Israeli security forces have dragged away hundreds of
settlers from barren hilltops in the West Bank. They have made hundreds
of arrests, but most detainees have been freed.
Settlers have vowed to carry on their fight to keep the West Bank,
which they see as given by God to the Jews, and to thwart negotiations
now taking place between Israel's government and the PLO to expand
Palestinian self-rule into the area.
A PLO negotiator at talks with Israel in Eilat today said that PLO
head Yasser Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres would meet
next week to try to bridge gaps blocking a deal.
''President Arafat and Mr Peres will meet on Sunday night or Monday.
They will discuss peace talks and obstacles impeding an agreement,''
said the negotiator.
The meeting venue had yet to be set. Israeli officials were not
immediately available to comment.--Reuter.

BRITISH troops in the besieged Bosnian enclave of Gorazde were on
alert yesterday after a massive flare-up between the warring factions.
The 200 men from the Royal Welch Fusiliers watched as a ''very fierce
firefight'' erupted between Muslim and Bosnian Serb forces.
''Fighting has died down, but we are watching closely to see whether
this was just a one-off or whether we are seeing the start of a new
round of fighting,'' said Army spokesman in the former Yugoslavia,
Lieutenant Colonel Barry Hawgood.
''It was a very fierce firefight to the east of the enclave but it did
not affect the British force,'' he added.
The West has issued a firm warning to the Bosnian Serbs that an
assault on Gorazde or the other enclaves of Bihac, Tuzla, and Sarajevo
will lead to extensive airstrikes, including direct bombing of troop
formations.
Since the Gorazde ultimatum was issued last month, the situation in
and around the enclave has remained relatively calm. Five UN convoys
successfully reached the town and the British force received urgent
supplies.
Meanwhile, the multi-national brigade, made up primarily of British
and French battle groups, has been placed under the command of French
General Andre Soubirou.
The second element of the rapid reaction force -- the 4000-strong 24
Airmobile Brigade -- is now expected to be fully operational in two
weeks.
The first infantry soldiers from the 1st Battalion The Royal Anglian
Regiment will fly out to the Croatian port of Split today.
A force of 150 men primarily from the RAF Regiment left their bases in
Germany for the former Yugoslavia yesterday.
They will be responsible for the security and protection of the
brigade's Chinook and Puma helicopters.
A total of 39 RAF and Army helicopters -- Lynx, Pumas, Gazelles, and
Chinooks -- will fly to the region once firm bases are constructed for
them at Ploce, where the brigade is to be based.
British Warrior armoured fighting vehicles, 105mm artillery guns, and
other equipment are being painted in camouflage green and black as they
are prepared for action.
Highly visible UN white is unsuitable for the brigade's new role to
boost protection of allied forces and the enclaves, as it could involve
intensive fighting.

New York
A COSMETICS manufacturer agreed today to pay a record $1.2m (#750,000)
to 15 female employees who said they were humiliated, hounded, and
sexually harassed by the company's chief executive.
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said the agreement by the
New York-based Del Laboratories was the largest settlement it had
reached in a sexual harassment suit.
Seven of the women complainants told a news conference of the obscene
and abusive behaviour they said Del's CEO, Dan Wassong, had adopted with
them. Two said they still had nightmares about it.
''He speaks to women as if they were nothing more than an ant crawling
over the floor,'' said former executive assistant Lisa Spohr. ''He made
you feel dirty and cheap.''
The complaint alleged Wassong grabbed one woman's left breast, touched
two women on their buttocks, and often addressed female employees with
his fly open.
Another former employee, Robin Cohen, said she was sacked after only
nine days because she complained about Wassong to the company's
personnel director.
''The man thinks he's better than God Almighty,'' said Christine
Aitta. ''I don't believe he thinks he's done anything wrong.''
A lawyer for Del, Mark Dichder, said the company maintained that the
charges were baseless.
Asked if Wassong would keep his job, Dichder said: ''That is up to the
board of directors. I have no reason to believe he won't.'' Wassong, 64,
who last year earned $1.1m, declined comment.--Reuter.

PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin, back on the political stage after a mild
heart attack last month, said he believed peace would soon return to
Chechnya but insisted that the breakaway region would remain part of
Russia.
Yeltsin, looking fit and confident, hailed the signing this week of a
military accord to end more than seven months of fighting in Chechnya,
but said further talks must be held.
He also cautioned in a televised speech today that there were forces
inside and outside Chechnya who wanted the conflict to continue and
stressed that they must be curbed.
''The progress of further talks and processes of revival of the
Chechen republic within the Russian Federation will largely depend on
this,'' he said. Solutions had to be found based on the Russian
constitution, he said.
Yeltsin claimed the military deal was the first success of peace
negotiations, which began in earnest after a Chechen rebel raid on the
Russian town of Budennovsk in June.
He called on both sides to implement immediately all its provisions,
which include an immediate end to fighting, military disengagement,
gradual disarmament of the rebels, and the withdrawal of most Russian
troops.
''At present it is necessary to organise the disarmament of all
illegal formations . . . This will become the basis for the withdrawal
of Russian troops who have fulfilled their duties,'' Yeltsin said.
Russian military officials fear that some irreconcilable rebels will
fight on regardless and Interfax news agency today reported two Russian
soldiers killed and three wounded in clashes with Chechen fighters.
Yeltsin said he would appoint a representative to Chechnya to push
forward the peace process. He said the region should have its own
political bodies and elect representatives to the Russian Parliament.
The military accord did not cover left the most difficult issue in the
peace talks -- Chechnya's constitutional status -- and Yeltsin's stance
falls far short of rebel demands for independence.
The Russian president looked in good health and showed no obvious
after-effects of his heart attack as he delivered his speech, recorded
in the sanatorium where he is recovering.
His reputation at home and abroad has been dented by the war which
began in December when he ordered troops and tanks into Chechnya to
crush its bid for independence. Many thousands of people have been
killed in the Muslim north Caucasus region.
Yeltsin said the decision to use force, which the Constitutional Court
backed on Monday as in accord with the constitution, had not been taken
easily.
''I bow my head before the memory of those who sacrificed their lives
defending the basic values without which the existence of any state is
unthinkable,'' he said, adding that the families of the dead and
orphaned children had to be helped.--Reuter.

SUZANNE Shepherd celebrates her fourth birthday today and will be able
to have some birthday cake for the first time.
Before her transplant two months ago Suzanne, of Lomond Crescent,
Beith in Ayrshire had no kidneys and was wired to a dialysis machine 16
hours a day. She ate mostly liquidised foods and chocolate was an
occasional treat.
Her parents Malcolm and Verna Shepherd were told when she was born
that she might not have long to live.
Yesterday Mrs Shepherd, 33, said: ''We can't get her to sit still at
the moment -- but we're not complaining.
''It's wonderful to watch her running around and even rummaging in the
cupboards.
''She ate a whole McDonald's ham burger last week, which was unheard
of for her.''
Suzanne is one of a handful of Scottish children born with a rare
kidney condition called congenital nephrotic syndrome, which until
recently doctors had no cure for.
Her first kidney was removed at the age of nine months, her second in
February this year.
A crucial transplant at Glasgow's Yorkhill Hospital in April failed,
leading to an agonising wait for her parents as doctors tried to find a
sec ond kidney for transplant.
''We couldn't believe it when they told us they had found a perfect
match'', said Mrs Shepherd.
''For us it really does seem like a miracle. And for Suzanne it's the
best birthday present she could ever have.''
Now her parents find it almost impossible to prise a boisterous
Suzanne from her seesaw in the garden.

* Eight-month-old Christopher Sykes yesterday saw the second mummy in
his life at the British Museum -- a 3000-year-old Egyptian high
priestess, known as Jeni who could help save the lives of thousands of
babies like him.
Senior physicist at St Thomas's Hospital, London, Dr Stephen Hughes
developed a 3-D scan for unborn babies after building an ultrasound
system to unwrap the mummy electronically. The system is being used to
detect abnormal growth in babies' organs, and was used on Christopher's
mother, Mrs Yolanda Sykes, 24, from Surrey Docks, London, because she
had lost a previous baby which had failed to develop normally.

THE overall substantial fall in crime figures in Strathclyde has
continued, Chief Constable Leslie Sharp revealed yesterday, although
violent crime is bucking the trend and rising.
Figures for the first six months of this year show a decrease of 8.8%
in reported crime against the first six months of 1994, with
housebreaking, thefts of and from vehicles, and petty thefts down
significantly. There was evidence also that the closed-circuit
television system in Glasgow city centre is having a telling effect.
However, Mr Sharp said, violent crimes with or without weapons
increased by 814, or nearly 13%, in the six-month period, and he added:
''The detection rate for violent crime stands at 73% and, since January,
we have arrested more than 2000 people for illegally carrying weapons.
''Violent crimes always attract sensational publicity which causes
unnecessary fear in the minds of the public. What the statistics show is
that the vast majority of people can go about their business undisturbed
and unthreatened.''
Mr Sharp said crime and lawlessness in Strathclyde were still too
high, although 11,288 fewer crimes had been reported over the period.
More than 50% of that reduction had come in the seven Glasgow police
divisions, with 5797 fewer crimes in the city in the year's first six
months.
The public was greatly affected by crimes of dishonesty, Mr Sharp
said, and these had fallen by 13% -- 12,122 fewer reported throughout
Strathclyde.
Another crime which had a major effect on people's lives,
housebreaking, was down by 21% -- 5468 fewer reported cases throughout
the region and within that figure reported housebreakings in Glasgow
city centre were down 30%. Theft from motor vehicles, notoriously
difficult to tackle, was down by 9% throughout the region.
Mr Sharp dealt separately with Paisley and East Renfrewshire, a
reflection of the recent outbreaks of drugs-related violence there and
where the figures have been clearly affected by the high-profile
policing operations in the area. Reported housebreaking there was down
18%, theft from vehicles down 9% and theft of vehicles down 4%.
Turning to crimes of violence, including murder, attempted murder,
serious assault, and carrying offensive weapons, Mr Sharp reported a 21%
increase across the region, 780 more reported crimes compared with the
same six-month period last year. Glasgow had not escaped, with an
increase of 336 violent crimes -- 10% up -- reported. This included
increases of 10 murders and 42 attempted murders and an increase of 15%
in serious assault cases.
Offensive weapons cases had risen by 26%. Mr Sharp said violence
touched the lives of very few people and very often the individuals
concerned were known to each other.
He emphasised the dangers of misinterpretation of statistics, pointing
out that, over the period, there had been 61% fewer crimes committed
with firearms.
Many of these crimes, an unquantifiable number, had been committed
using replicas but no-one threatened could tell the difference.
''It looks like the Clyde Tunnel when you are looking down the barrel
of any firearm,'' Mr Sharp said.
Referring to the current anti-drugs purge -- Operation Eagle -- he
said significant numbers of arrests had already been made in the
education period of the operation and the intelligence which had come
from the public via special telephone hotlines would provide an
invaluable base when the enforcement period began in a month.
Of the 1500 people who had been reported for drugs offences since June
1, nearly 500 had been dealers.

<TEXT>
A DRUG company with a production plant in the Hebrides is preparing to
market an extract of fish oil which can help dyslexia sufferers.
Scotia Pharmaceuticals, which is planning to move its Surrey
headquarters to Stirling, has signed the rights to the treatment from a
scientist who discovered that dyslexics' eyes can't adjust well to the
dark.
The fish oil extract she gave them in a clinical trial restored their
night vision to normal levels. Now Dr Jaqueline Stordy wants to recruit
more sufferers to find out if other aspects of their condition can be
helped.
Dr Stordy, who works at Surrey University's School of Biological
Sciences, extracted docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the main constituent of
fish oil which is also an important component of the retina and the
brain.
Ten adults with dyslexia and 10 unaffected controls were all fed with
the extract and subjected to a dark adaptation test.
She reports in the Lancet today that all 10 dyslexics showed a marked
improvement in dark adaptation. Longer-term feeding with DHA also
produced benefits.
Dr Stordy is now preparing trials to see whether DHA helps the more
familiar effects of dyslexia, like reading difficulties and the
behaviourial problems which can result.
* Volunteers can contact Dr Stordy at the University of Surrey,
Guildford, GU2 5XH.

PRESSURE for more Government support for chiropractic therapy is
likely to increase following an endorsement of the treatment published
today by the Medical Research Council.
A three-year trial of chiropractic therapy for patients with lower
back pain has found it to be more effective than conventional hospital
treatment.
The independent study will be a powerful counter to critics who claim
that such alternative or complementary treatments lack scientific
evidence of their efficacy.
Chiropractors work by manipulating the spine in order to relieve
pressure on nerves as they branch off from the spinal cord.
The MRC's Epidemiology and Medical Care Unit at St Bartholomew's
Hospital in London, led by Professor Tom Meade, looked at the outcomes
for 741 men and women, aged 18-64, who were allocated randomly to a
chiropractic centre or a conventional hospital for treatment.
The results, based on questionnaires and published today in the
British Medical Journal, showed that, after three years, improvement
overall was 29% greater in those treated by chiropractors.
''The beneficial effect on pain was particularly clear and more
patients treated by chiropractors went back for more treatment after the
completion of trial treatment,'' says the report.
Significant improvements were also shown in the patients' ability to
sit for more than a short time and in their sleeping patterns.
Other scores -- personal care, lifting, walking, standing, sex life,
social life, and travelling -- nearly all showed higher improvements
with the use of chiropractic therapy, if only marginally.
''These findings do not mean that hospital treatment is ineffective,''
said Professor Meade.
''Part of the difference between the two groups could be that pressure
on NHS resources means that hospital therapists cannot always give what
they regard as the ideal treatment.
''However, it seems likely that some feature of chiropractic --
perhaps the type of manipulation used -- is particularly beneficial.''
He added: ''We need further trials to identify the effective
components of chiropractic, which could then be included in hospital
practice.''
The precise treatment used was not specified and was left up to the
doctors concerned; however, treatment often involves physiotherapy and
prescribing anti-inflammatory drugs.

COOK'S tour of the UK began in earnest yesterday in Glasgow, with the
Shadow Foreign Secretary giving his recipe for ''A Europe for the People
of Scotland''.
Over the summer, Mr Robin Cook, the MP for Livingston, will visit 10
cities in Scotland, England, and Wales to proclaim Labour's vision for
Europe.
Mr Cook told a news conference in Govan that Labour's constructive
approach to Europe offered a better prospect of success than the Tory
approach of ''destructive obstruction''.
Govan itself was a symbol of the practical benefits that ''come from
properly exploiting the opportunities provided by the European Union''.
One of the most important areas of Labour's vision for Europe
concerned jobs. A survey by Labour had revealed that the European Union
was vital to the success of Scotland's industrial economy, Mr Cook said.
The survey of 109 leading Scottish exporters showed that more than
half of the managing directors said their companies had benefited from
membership of the European Union.
There were 94 firms which exported to other EU countries, while nearly
all said they planned to expand exports over the next five years.
Of the 94 exporters, 46 said their exports would be less secure if
there were doubts about the UK's commitment to Europe.
Mr Cook said: ''What these answers demonstrate is just how important
the EU is and how important it is to export jobs in Scotland.''
Other areas where Labour's approach to Europe would have an immediate
impact on the lives of Scottish families and communities included a
Scottish parliament, workers' rights, consumer protection, and the
environment.
Mr Cook emphasised that a Scottish parliament, to which Labour was
committed, would put Scotland at the heart of Europe and would have a
key role in strengthening Scottish links with the rest of the EU.
He said a future Scottish parliament should have a European Minister,
like many other countries in Europe, while Labour would establish a
Scottish European Office in Brussels.
He added: ''The rights of our working people rest on common standards
set by the EU. Labour will sign up to the Social Chapter and give
working people in Scotland the same right to consultation as employees
on the Continent.''
Labour would also press for reform of the Common Agricultural Policy
to give consumers a fairer deal and a cheaper food basket.
To tackle the problems of pollution, Labour would support a European
environmental charter.
Mr Cook later met business leaders, trade unionists, and local
authorities in the city to discuss party policies on Europe.

SCOTTISH Constitutional Convention leaders insisted yesterday that
their unity of purpose had not been shattered by recent claims that the
Labour Party under Tony Blair was toning down its commitment to create a
strong Scottish parliament.
Speaking after a convention working party meeting in Edinburgh, Labour
and Scottish Liberal Democrat officials said they were still on course
to present the final blueprint for a parliament for discussion at a
meeting of the full convention on September 26.
The thorny problem of how to entrench a parliament's powers, however,
clearly remains to be solved.
Meanwhile, on the sidelines, SNP leader Alex Salmond kept up the
pressure over the earlier reports that Labour would allow Westminster to
veto or amend laws passed by a Scottish parliament.
He said the ''Claim of Right'', which proclaims the sovereignity of
the Scottish people over their own government, had been undermined by
Tony Blair.
''If new Labour wants to allay fears that they are watering down their
position then Tony Blair himself should endorse the claim of right,''
said Mr Salmond.
Liberal Democrats' chief executive Andy Myles said he had come to the
working party meeting with ''some trepidation'' after the recent reports
but the indications from Labour's Scottish Secretary Jack McConnell had
reassured him there was no backtracking on entrenching the powers of a
Scottish parliament.
He added: ''This morning's meeting has given me every confidence that
we are on schedule to have the substance of an agreement ready for the
meeting on September 26 and that, come St Andrew's Day, the convention
will launch a superb scheme for a Scottish parliament to which all the
members at the launch will be firmly committed.''
On entrenchment, Mr McConnell insisted Labour remained committed to
''the strongest possible parliament for Scotland''. They also wanted to
ensure it could not be wiped away by the sweep of a pen from Michael
Forsyth or anybody else. The discussions were about the best way to
achieve that.
Canon Kenyon Wright, who chairs the convention's executive committee,
said he did not believe anyone was going to let the convention fail at
the last hurdles.
No-one was going back on the principle of the claim of right, which
was the sovereignty of the Scottish people, or on the principle that
they had to secure the maximum feasible entrenchment of that, in the
sense that it could not be unilaterally altered by any future
Westminster Government.
Mr McConnell said both Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth and SNP
leader Alex Salmond, who had been criticising Labour and the Convention,
had spent their political lives trying to stop a devolved Scottish
parliament being created.
''These are people who cannot be trusted by anybody on this particular
issue and they will say anything to hurt and damage our case. That is
what they have been doing. They will keep doing it and nobody should be
fooled by them,'' he said.

<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday urged Home Secretary Michael Howard to take tougher
action against child abuse in the UK and abroad.
In a letter to Mr Howard, Labour said: ''We are writing to express our
deep concern at the Government's failure adequately to protect children
from sexual abuse and exploitation.''
The letter, from Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw, Shadow Overseas
Development Minister Joan Lestor, and spokeswoman on children and the
family Ms Llin Golding, said that, by signing up in 1991 to the UN
Convention on the Rights of the Child, Britain committed itself to
acting against child exploitation.
Last month, Mr Howard announced a review of the law to see if people
in Britain who helped or encouraged men to have sex with children
overseas could be prosecuted.
Campaigners want the prosecution in Britain of the actual offenders.
Labour's letter said Mr Howard's review was ''a smokescreen to disguise
the absence of a comprehensive children protection strategy''.
Its letter called for:
* Laws to enable prosecution in the UK of UK citizens committing
sexual offences against children overseas;
* The establishment of an effective nationwide database, ''with
appropriate checks and balances'', of known and suspected paedophiles;
* Closer vetting of people seeking to work with children;
* Tougher action against child pornography, including that available
on the Internet computer system;
* New approaches to the investigation of paedophile activities.
Labour's call was backed by Mr Michael Hames, former head of the
Obscene Publications Squad, who now runs a private company vetting those
seeking to work with vulnerable people, including children.
A Home Office spokeswoman said the department would consider the
letter and respond to the MPs.

<HEADLINE>Boundary changes study leads to 'virtual politics' as computers pinpoint marginals. Forsyth seat is Labour's top target</HEADLINE>

SECRETARY of State Michael Forsyth's Stirling seat is now the
second-most marginal Tory seat in Britain, according to the latest
research by the Labour Party.
The computer-aided survey by Labour has taken into account the new
boundaries of all the 659 seats which will make up Britain's next
Parliament. It has then weighted them with local government voting
trends in the wards that have moved from one constituency to another
where there are boundary changes, to try to predict who would have won
the seats if the new boundaries had been in place at the last election.
Such a theoretical move does have its difficulties, but nonetheless
Labour believes it gives it a more accurate picture of which are the
more winnable seats when the next election is fought on the new
boundaries.
The exercise is particularly poor reading for Ayr Conservative MP Phil
Gallie. Labour says the boundary changes there already mean that Ayr
would be a Labour seat, and that there is no requirement of a swing from
Conservative to Labour for the party to win it.
According to the Labour research, boundary changes alone would take Mr
Forsyth's majority in Stirling, currently 703, down to 423, leaving
Labour only a target of a 0.03% swing from Conservative to win it.
The only other Scottish seat in the top 60 Tory marginals which could
fall to Labour is Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind's Edinburgh
Pentlands seat, where Labour requires a 2.23% swing to win it, making it
29th on the list.
Such figures have to be treated with caution, however. Mr Forsyth,
after all, after numerous predictions that he would lose Stirling at the
last election, actually increased his majority, while Labour was winning
seats from the Conservatives elsewhere in Britain.
Even Mr Tommy Sheppard, assistant general secretary of the Scottish
Labour Party, stressed that raw figures like these should not have too
much interpretation placed upon them.
''That's playing virtual politics. We play real politics here,'' he
said. ''We have to combine hard psephological data with common sense to
make a proper judgment.
''The strength of the parties on the ground, the extent of our success
there before, and other factors all have to be taken into account before
drawing up a proper list of target seats.''
Labour in Scotland does indeed have its target list, although, like
any other party official, Mr Sheppard was too coy to go into it in
detail, stating only that: ''I am quite happy to confirm that Michael
Forsyth is our number one target.''
As Mr Forsyth proved at the last election, having a small majority
does not automatically mean you lose your seat. Labour activists are
believed to be targeting seats other than Mr Rifkind's as being more
likely to fall to Labour.
In Dumfries, for example, the Conservative majority is the second
largest of the party in Scotland. But with long-standing MP Sir Hector
Monro standing down, some Labour activists say it is a better target
than others, as much of the majority could be put down to the high
regard Sir Hector is held in locally, and it may not transfer to the new
Conservative candidate.
In Aberdeen, three seats are being created out of two. Aberdeen
Central is likely to begin favourite as a Labour seat, and the new
Aberdeen North and Aberdeen South seats may well be a three-way scrap,
involving not only the Conservatives and Labour, but the Liberal
Democrats as well.
In Aberdeen South, Labour is hoping that Liberal Democrat voters
transferred from Kincardine and Deeside may switch to Labour in order to
unseat Conservative MP Raymond Robertson.
So far, Labour computers at party headquarters are unable to take into
account tactical voting, which is even more complex in Scotland because
of the four-way vote split when the Scottish National Party is taken
into account as well.
Labour nationally does say that the analysis shows the boundary
changes were not as harmful to Labour as was first suspected.
The Conservatives had been confident the review of borders would
result in significant net gains to them, but Labour managed to stave off
the worst of the proposals through tightly argued submissions to the
boundary commissioners.
Labour claims that, under the new boundaries, it will have to take 55
seats from the Conservatives to win an overall majority -- and that
requires only a swing from Tory to Labour of 4.5%.

<TEXT>
THE Ministry of Defence has taken out a court injunction banning
publication of a book which disclosed details about the work of the top
secret SAS.
An MoD spokeswoman confirmed the injunction had been obtained from the
High Court stopping the book, Immediate Action, from going on sale.
It is thought the book by Andy McNab, author of bestselling novel
Bravo Two Zero, contained confidential top secret details about the
operations of the SAS during the Gulf War in 1991.
''There is no question about it. The work of special forces is
something we do not discuss,'' the spokeswoman said.
The decision was taken by the MoD's legal section in the absence of
Defence Secretary Michael Portillo, who is on holiday.
The spokeswoman emphasised that the injunction was essential to
protect national security and the members of the SAS, whose identity is
never disclosed.
The book contained ''confidential information'' about the SAS ''which
we never discuss'', she said.
The injunction was granted by the Chancery division of the High Court
in London on Wednesday, after an application by MoD legal
representatives.
The spokeswoman added: ''It is a policy of the Ministry of Defence
that we do not talk about the work of special forces.
''This book was judged to contain information which was essential to
operational effectiveness and the personal security of personnel
involved.''
She added that most books about military operations or regiments were
checked by the MoD. It was the first time the MoD had taken this action
''for some years''.
Bravo Two Zero, the bestselling novel about the work of the SAS in the
Gulf war, was cited in a recent court case involving two students. They
murdered a man in London as the ''ultimate dare'' after reading the
book.

THE Sinn Fein leader, Mr Gerry Adams, warned yesterday that the
Northern Ireland peace process would be ''in a crisis'' if all-party
talks were not under way in time for November's trip to Ireland by
President Bill Clinton.
He also called on Mr Major to ''take a leadership role -- do his duty
and move the entire situation towards a peace settlement''.
Speaking in Dublin, Mr Adams praised work done for the peace process
by Mr Clinton, who told the Irish Times yesterday that recent meetings
between the Northern Ireland Secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, and Mr Adams
had marked an important step in advancing the peace process.
Mr Clinton had said: ''Naturally I would be pleased if all-party talks
were under way by the time I visit Northern Ireland.''
He also said he would welcome movement on the issue of relocating
para-military prisoners as ''a way of helping the process of healing and
reconcilation''.
Mr Adams felt Mr Clinton's approach was even-handed and balanced.
He said he had no immediate plans for further meetings with Sir
Patrick but he expected there would be more talks.
The US ambassador to Ireland, Mrs Jean Kennedy Smith, later stressed
the importance of all-party talks getting under way ahead of Mr
Clinton's visit.
Speaking in Galway, she said she expected movement by the British
Government ''in the very near future'' on para-military prisoners.
* Convicted IRA man Jimmy Smyth, 41, fighting extradition to Britain
from San Francisco, yesterday appealed to President Clinton to release
so-called Irish political prisoners jailed in the US.
Smyth -- one of 38 IRA men who broke out of the Maze prison in 1983 --
also accused US prosecutors of creating an obstacle to peace efforts in
Northern Ireland by trying to have his bail revoked while he fights
extradition.

OVERPOWERING farmyard
smells have forced householders in Dundee to shut their windows and
swelter in the heatwave.
Residents have re-named their city ''Dung-dee'' as they reach for
air-fresheners and close their windows in the stifling heat.
The city's environmental health department is investigating complaints
and, at the moment, the finger of blame is pointed at farmers across the
Tay in Fife.
Yesterday, however, a farmer's spokesman suggested the blame could lie
with Danish pig farmers.
Ms Janice Meach, a beauty consultant, of Blackness Road, said: ''This
has gone on for two days. The stench is totally disgusting -- it made me
physically sick.
''We have had to close all the windows on the hottest days of the
year. At first, I thought it was my customers and they thought it was
me. I just can't put up with it any more.''
Ms Dorothy Oudney, a secretary at Nethergate, added: ''It was
absolutely disgusting. There is no doubt that it was the smell of manure
or slurry from the fields which are miles away. The stink is
overpowering.''
A spokesman for Dundee District Council's environmental health
department confirmed that complaints received over the last two days are
under investigation.
At the National Farmer's Union offices in Cupar, even the secretary
admitted: ''The smell has been unbearable.''
However, NFU spokesman Jim Quigley said: ''Some of these smells can
travel a fair distance, it could even be coming from across the North
Sea. I was in Ireland recently and they were suffering from this kind of
smell as well.''

SIX canoeists, three fathers and their three sons, who were reported
missing after they failed to return to Skye on Wednesday night, were
found safe and well yesterday. The coastguard helicopter from Stornoway,
a coastguard team from Skye, and the Portree lifeboat took part in the
search.
The party had set off from Skye on Monday to circumnavigate Raasay. A
spokesman for Oban coastguard said: ''They were found at Manish Point on
the north-west of the island. They had done the right thing in taking
shelter for an extra night. There had been a force six blowing from the
north-east and they were well advised to stop and camp last night. They
had camping gear with them.
''The three boys have now been taken back to Portree, where they have
joined their mothers, but the three fathers are staying another night on
Raasay. Everybody is safe and well.''

THE mother of Glasgow district councillor Tommy Sheridan last night
began a 14-day jail sentence after refusing to pay a #250 fine for her
part in a warrant sale protest.
The Scottish Militant Labour councillor, who campaigned against the
poll tax, was jailed along with his 55-year-old mother Alice for his
part in the protest but was released on bail pending appeal.
Mr Sheridan, 31, was sentenced to 30 days' imprisonment at Greenock
Sheriff Court when he refused to accept a community service order. His
mother, Alice, was sentenced to 14 days when she declined to pay a #250
fine.
The pair later were granted interim freedom but although her son
walked free from court, Mrs Sheridan was remanded in Corntonvale Prison,
Stirling, last night after withdrawing her bail application. She is
expected to serve seven days.
The Sheridans were found guilty of breach of the peace along with two
other protesters during a demonstration which disrupted a poll-tax
warrant sale against a single mother in Greenock last December.
Fellow protester Keith Baldasarra, who received a 30-day sentence for
breach of the peace after refusing community service, also was granted
bail, while Tam Dymond accepted a 120-hour community service order.
More than 30 supporters of the accused jeered and shouted from the
gallery as the sentences were imposed.
In a statement issued yesterday, Mr Sheridan said to have accepted
community service would have ''legitimised'' the charges, and added:
''We refused to be branded criminals for defending the poor.
''The poll tax is universally hated. It has always been unjust and
immoral. Warrant sales are simply barbaric.
''The Anti-Poll Tax Federation and Scottish Militant will continue to
fight this medieval obscenity, not just with words but with action.''
Scottish Militant party secretary Ronnie Stevenson said his group
would campaign for the sentences against the ''Greenock three'' to be
dropped and added: ''We do not consider warrant sales to be a crime and
we will not stop our action.''
However, a spokesman for Strathclyde regional council said: ''The
local authority has a statutory duty to pursue all poll-tax debts and
will continue to do so.''
Mrs Sheridan served a seven-day sentence in January for refusing to
pay a fine imposed for obstructing a sheriff officer during a separate
warrant sale protest in Greenock.

<HEADLINE>'Weather rage' scorches Transport Minister in an arid Britain dreaming of glaciers. Hazy, crazy days of summer</HEADLINE>

THE heatwave is stretching police to their limit as they contend with
so-called ''weather rage'' -- people losing their tempers.
Police officers have been called out to deal with hundreds more cases
-- most of which involve rows, drunkenness and ''road rage'' -- drivers
fighting with each other in the traffic.
The West Midlands force received a record 2000 calls in one day last
week against a normal average of 1200.
The heat was the most likely cause for the increase in trouble, said
Dr Simon Smith, a senior registrar in psychiatry at Hereford Community
Health.
The 90F-plus temperatures had ''secondary effects'' stripping away
normal inhibitions, he claimed.
''During long sunny periods people get out and about more and become
less inhibited. People are also more likely to go to the pub and drink
more.''
The heatwave has also heightened the problem of smog, and put
Transport Minister Steven Norris on the spot for using his car during
the hot spell.
Yesterday morning -- from a BBC Radio 4 car -- Mr Norris told the
Today programme of the need to coax people out of their cars. But
sometimes, he said, the car was the only sensible option for a journey.
As if to prove his point he then headed off to Kent in his official
Rover for a series of official visits, and meetings with local MPs.
Mr Tim Brown, of the National Society for Clean Air, said: ''This
would have been a good day for Mr Norris to set an example, show a bit
of leadership.''
Mr Norris who earlier this year told the Commons environment committee
that people used private cars to avoid ''dreadful human beings'' on
public transport, denied he was telling drivers to ''do as I say, not as
I do''.
He added he had ''made a real habit'' over the past three or four
years of using public transport.
Mr Brown added: ''I don't think simply exhorting peole to leave their
cars at home will have much of an impact on air pollution.
''Putting the onus on individual members of the public is preying on
the small proportion who really care about the environment and making
them feel guilty.''
The Department of Transport is backing a #1m pilot project to cut a
city's air pollution by curbing car travel, it was disclosed yesterday.
It has awarded Avon County Council #562,000 towards the two-year
scheme on the A4 Bath Road, a busy commuter route into the heart of
Bristol. The European Commission is giving a further #370,000.
Starting in the autumn, the project on a two-mile stretch from the
Brislington Park-and-Ride site to the city centre will include message
signs informing drivers of air pollution levels and urging them to
consider travelling by bus.
The weather is having its inevitable effect on water supplies.
Highland households are being warned they face a hosepipe ban if they
don't stop using too much water.
Highland Regional Council says there is a particular problem in
Caithness, Easter Ross and the Dornoch area, while consumption is up 15%
in the Inverness area. The main culprits are gardeners who have been
told to stop watering their gardens -- or the council will ban
hosepipes.
Already a Highland raft race has hit the rocks because of low water
levels on the River Ness.
Mr Alastair Duff, a committee member for the Great Ness River Race
conceded defeat yesterday -- and postponed tomorrow's event for one
month. It is hoped the 15th annual race, involving some 30-40 rafts,
will now take place on September 2.
Britain's landscape meanwhile is being ravaged by grass fires. Fields
and woodland are so dry that fire brigades are struggling to keep up
with the number of outbreaks.
In the past two days Kent Fire Brigade has received more than 500
emergency calls, mostly grass and corn fires.
A brigade spokesman said: ''People have got to be more careful when
the weather is like this. Just one carelessly discarded cigarette can
cause a major fire.''
Elsewhere Railtrack is pouring thousands of gallons of water overa
road and rail bridge to prevent it from buckling in the heatwave.
The Kingsferry Bridge, which spans the River Swale, links the Isle of
Sheppey with the rest of Kent.
Meanwhile in a desperate attempt to cool off, and as water shortages
threaten, travel agents have reported a boom in skiing holidays.
Summer-skiiing on a Norwegian glacier is among the most favoured cool
breaks.
A Norwegian airways spokesman said: ''People are getting desperate.
When they hear that there is still plenty of snow in Norway they just
have to head out of the heat.''

THE Serious Fraud Office has accepted an unconditional offer to
interview former Barings trader Nick Leeson over the bank's failure.
In a statement, the SFO said it had no reason to think that the
Singapore authorities would fail in their attempt to extradite Mr Leeson
from Germany, but if their application was not granted, an interview
with Mr Leeson would ''put the SFO in a position to make an application
for his extradition''.
However, the statement made it clear that although the SFO wants to
keep its options open, at this stage it still does not plan to try to
bring Mr Leeson back to Britain to stand trial.
The statement said: ''The SFO's view is that the events which led to
the collapse of Barings primarily occurred in Singapore. Accordingly,
Singapore is the most appropriate jurisdiction, notwithstanding Mr
Leeson's stated wish to be tried in the UK.
''We have made it known that we do not intend to put in an extradition
request in competition with Singapore's. This continues to be our
position.
''It is also the case that the SFO does not currently have the
evidence to warrant an extradition application being made.''
The offer of an unconditional interview was made in a letter from Mr
Leeson's solicitors, Kingsley Napley, on July 24.
Mr Leeson's lawyer, Stephen Pollard of Kingsley Napley, said last
night: ''Despite the fact that they appear to have prejudged the matter,
I believe that this interview will advance the case for his extradition
to Britain.''
Mr Leeson's lawyers have protested that he would not receive a fair
trial in Singapore.

A BOY of 13 was found murdered yesterday on a golf course on the
shores of Lough Neagh. The body of Darren Fawns, of Antrim, was
discovered in bushes close to the 11th tee at Massereene. It is
understood he had a head injury and was naked.
Darren was last seen in the centre of Antrim last Friday night and
detectives believe his body had been lying on the golf course for up to
three days.
The course is close to a caravan park and police have interviewed
tourists.
In England, an inquest heard yesterday that one of the schoolboys
murdered last weekend while out on a fishing trip was strangled and the
other was stabbed to death.
A post-mortem examination of 13-year-old Paul Barker found the
youngster had been strangled with a ligature, and only after he died
were multiple stab wounds inflicted on his chest, Wirral Coroner's Court
was told.
His friend, Robert Gee, 12, died from stab wounds to the chest, but
there were also marks of asphyxiation.
Details were given during formal evidence of identification at the
hearing at Wallasey Town Hall, which heard that the boys' bodies were
removed from scrubland at Eastham, Merseyside, on Sunday.
Robert's father, Leonard, identified his son's body, and Paul's body
was identified by his uncle, Mr Ray Williams.
The inquest was adjourned until after the conclusion of criminal
proceedings.
Wirral coroner Christopher Johnson said: ''I would like to express my
deepest and heartfelt sympathies to both sets of parents and families on
their loss of Robert and Paul in the evil and wicked circumstances which
occurred.''
No members of the victims' families attended the 14-minute hearing.

OSPREY, the world's first ocean-based wave power electricity
generator, was last night left perched at the UIE shipyard in Clydebank
for a second day after another tugboat fault delayed its departure until
tomorrow.
The journey of the #4m generator to its operational site off Douneray
was postponed after the Cavendish Sea developed clutch failure while
beginning the tow.
On Wednesday, the originally scheduled departure of Osprey (Ocean
Swell Powered Renewable Energy) was abandoned when an electrical fault
in the tugboat's pressure reading instruments rendered sailing unsafe.
Applied Research and Technology, the Inverness company who developing
the generator, is to charter an alternative tug from Aberdeen.
The Herald has been asked to point out that the Ministry of Defence
Marine Services tug Impetus, based at Greenock, which was pictured with
Osprey in yesterday's paper, was not responsible for delaying the
generator's departure from the Clyde.

A LAWYER has accused immigration officials of prejudice against Asians
wishing to visit Scotland to see their relatives.
Among the cases being handled by immigration law specialist Ms
Alexandra MacRae is that of Mr Safdar Hussain, a waiter living and
working in Germany who has been denied permission to visit Glasgow for a
family wedding which takes place tomorrow.
That decision means Mr Hussain's wife, Nasim, who is a British
citizen, and their sons Mohsan, three, and Ahsan, two, have had to leave
him behind and will attend the celebrations without him.
Ms MacRae, who is based in Dundee and runs a weekly clinic in Glasgow,
said yesterday: ''This is an example of the sort of thing that is
happening all the time now. It seems to me that if you have a white
face, your word is never doubted but if you are Asian, the authorities
think there is some conspiracy to come and stay here.''
Mr Hussain, 51, lives near Dusseldorf and applied to the British
Consulate there for a visa, or ''entry clearance'', to visit the UK for
a fortnight. His brother-in-law, Mr Mohammed Ashraf, who lives in
Pollokshields in Glasgow, acted as his ''sponsor'' for the application.
In the official form denying Mr Hussain permission, an entry clearance
officer at Dusseldorf noted that he originally entered Germany in 1988
with a transit visa, that four years later he was granted exceptional
leave to remain, and that it was only after his marriage to a British
citizen in 1994 that he was granted a German residence permit.
He pointed out that Mr Hussain's wife still owned property in the UK
and her immediate relatives were resident here, while Mr Hussain had no
relatives in Germany. He also noted that the waiter had a modest income
which was supplemented by state benefits.
The official concluded: ''I am not satisfied that you have ties and
assets in Germany such as to encourage you to return. In these
circumstances, I am not satisfied that you intend making a visit to the
UK of the period stated.''
Ms MacRae said neither Mr Hussain nor his wife wished to live in the
UK. Mrs Hussain owned a house in Huddersfield but this was let out as an
investment and was occupied by a tenant.
''Mr Hussain is hardly likely to come here and swell the ranks of the
unemployed when he has got a job in Germany. He would be at risk of
losing his job if he did not return after a couple of weeks.
Mr Ashraf, whose cousin's daughter is the bride at tomorrow's wedding,
said: ''I feel sorry for my sister. Her husband has got a good job in
Germany and he just wants to visit here.'' He added that his
brother-in-law had been refused entry clearance on three previous
occasions when he wished to visit Britain.
Mrs Hussain said: ''We were all meant to come here together for the
wedding. The children are missing their father.''
A Home Office spokeswoman last night rejected any suggestion that
immigration officials were prejudiced or over-zealous. ''We would refute
that very strongly,'' she said.

<HEADLINE>Hatred carried no warning. Early life laid foundations for brutal school bully who terrorised women</HEADLINE>

TEENAGE rapist Calum McLeod was seen by a psychologist before the
rampage of sexual terror which he unleashed on Glasgow women, and he was
referred by the police to the Children's Panel for earlier unruly
behaviour.
In both instances, nothing was flagged up by those in the system to
indicate that some form of intervention was needed.
The clear indications were yesterday that McLeod's behaviour was seen
as the fairly normal rebellion of a child who had been damaged since an
early age, and not as the first signs of a twisted and deformed
personality which would lead to unbridled brutality against women
culminating in rape.
However, the performance of the agencies concerned with the case may
yet come under further scrutiny.
McLeod was released on bail from Glasgow Sheriff Court after appearing
first on the rape charges straight back to the wide-open conditions of
the childrens' home where he had been living.
Strathclyde Regional Council social workers had taken him straight to
secure accommodation, only for McLeod's lawyer to succeed in having the
social workers' decision reversed.
An inquiry by the Scottish Office was set in motion last month by Lord
Fraser, then Scottish Office Home Affairs Minister, and concern was also
expressed by Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth. They appeared last
night to have been satisfied that the Strathclyde social work department
had acted properly in relation to McLeod.
McLeod was a brutal bully when he attended mainstream school, and even
in his short period of residential care, he terrified other children.
There is also a clear indication that he had developed the cunning
necessary to play the system.
One social work source pointed out yesterday that on the nights when
he terrorised the South Side he had been allowed by care workers to stay
out late with his girlfriend, but that the assaults and rape took place
after he had dropped his girlfriend off.
A closer examination of the case yesterday more or less absolves the
the residential care services. The author of months of terror for
thousands of Glasgow women was in local authority care for a mere six
months. The damage was done long before he came into care, experts were
saying yesterday.
The hard fact was that, an only child, his parents separated when he
was only four and the subsequent and greater part of his life thereafter
became a shuttle between various relatives.
It was during this period that the patterns of his behaviour clearly
hinting at a severely disturbed personality became evident. In the light
of that, the quoted reaction of some of McLeod's family members, who
clearly laid the blame on the social work department for ''allowing him
to roam the streets at night'', was richly ironic, carrying as it did
the suggestion that going into care was the trigger for his criminality.
The ethos of the home where he lived is one of trying to get as close
as possible to a stable home life. McLeod was taken into care when
members of his own family said they no longer wanted to look after him.
Strathclyde Regional Council's child care staff checked when the youth
was going out in the evening, asking where he was going, with whom, and
when he intended to come back. But, again attempting to achieve
normality, there would be no effort made to interfere or to enforce
strict supervision.
The key to the care of young people like McLeod, people who have often
been badly let down by adults throughout their early lives, is the
formation of relationships. But they are invariably the hardest
youngsters of all for even skilled care staff to reach, and McLeod was a
classic case.
He formed no relationships, either with the staff or the other young
people. The care staff member has to strike the right balances. If a
youngster such as McLeod says he is not coming back at 10.30pm, the
carer has to decide whether to be flexible or to challenge the
behaviour.
It is not an excuse for what happened, a leading social work figure
said, but teenage rebellion happens in the very best and best-managed
families. With someone like McLeod, the problems are compounded to a
nearly impossible degree.
One senior social work figure also pointed out that residential homes
are not part of the criminal justice system and are emphatically not
mini-prisons. The young people are never under lock and key, nor locked
in their rooms at night.
Although there were earlier problems of vandalism, unruly behaviour in
public and abusive language, there had been nothing in McLeod's
behaviour to suggest real physical violence or sexual deviancy. There
was not a hint, the carers say, in their admittedly short experience of
him, to suggest he was a potential rapist.
These earlier criminal episodes were reported by the police to the
Children's Panel system, but the cases were not proceeded with.
It might be a reasonable assumption that a psychologist might have
picked up the escalating pattern of disturbed behaviour which would have
indicated a potential rapist in the making. To suggest that social work
department child care staff should have done so is patently absurd.
The fact is that the Strathclyde Social Work Department, which has a
statutory duty to undertake care reviews within six months of a young
person coming on to their system, did review McLeod's behaviour after
only a few weeks. He was seen by doctors from the education unit at the
Glasgow clinic, but nothing indicated that he was dangerous and that
some form of intervention should happen.
A psychiatrist familiar with the case said that McLeod had obviously
developed a hatred of women and needed to dominate them with terror. Why
this had happened was anyone's guess and would remain inside McLeod
until he opened up the recesses of his psyche to the doctors.
McLeod is currently detained in St Mary's, a secure home near
Bishopbriggs which is run by the Archdiocese of Glasgow. He is likely to
remain there until his sixteenth birthday, when he will be transferred
out of the juvenile justice system and into the care of the Scottish
prison service.
Psychiatric counselling will be available to him along the way, but as
yet no intervention programme is available in the Scottish system for
juvenile sex offenders.

AN investigation was launched last night to find out for how long a
waste pipe has been discharging potentially dangerous chemicals into the
River Forth at Leith.
Environmental group Friends of The Earth Scotland has demanded an
inquiry to find out what damage has been inflicted by the pollution
poured into Leith Docks.
Experts from the Forth River Purification Board visited the scene
yesterday morning after being given laboratory results of chemicals in
the water.
Included in the samples were dichloromethane and napthalene, both of
which are irritants. Napthalene can cause eyes, nose, and throat
irritation. Very high levels can cause headaches and nausea.
The samples from the pipe were taken in a monitoring operation carried
out by Friends of The Earth Scotland. Using canoes, they secured samples
of the outflow which were then submitted for analysis to Lothian
Regional Council's public analyst and the Forth River Purification
Board.
Dr David Holloway, chief pollution expert of the purification board,
confirmed the type of chemicals found in the sample and said an
investigation had been launched.
The main substances found were not at a high level and would have been
diluted by sea water. What concerns environmentalists, however, is
whether higher levels had been discharged at other times.
Dr Holloway said the pipe, at the back of the British Pipe Coaters
Limited factory in Western Harbour had been closed immediately the
problem was brought to the attention of the company.
He said BPCL, which coats pipes to prevent corrosion for the oil and
gas industries, did not have permission to discharge waste from that
pipe.
Dr Holloway added: ''Following our talks with the company yesterday it
seems they are flabbergasted at just how the chemicals came to be coming
out of the pipes. The chemicals identified are not used in their work
process as far as they are aware.''
He said the problem was the first they had dealt with involving the
company, which had been on the site for around 20 years.

THE slow, soporific, style of life on the Western Isles has led more
than one observer to note that they are light years behind the 1990s.
Islanders would say it was a subjective view but, yesterday, objective
proof of the theory was provided when council chiefs ordered the lights
at Stornoway's first traffic junction to be altered to a special slow
''Hebridean'' setting after a morning of traffic trouble.
Mr George Simmons, the council's assistant technical services manager,
said the engineers who installed the lights at the junction of Matheson
Road and Macaulay Road would have to fly back to Lewis next week to make
changes to the controlling equipment.
New road lanes painted this week could also have to be scrubbed out
and repainted to help direct drivers the right way.
Yesterday morning's traffic snarl-ups -- something of a novelty for
Stornoway -- saw cars and lorries queued for up to half-a-mile on
Macaulay Road and Matheson Road as baffled drivers tried to cope with
the new lights.
An assistant at a nearby shop said: ''It's been absolute chaos out
there.
''No-one was expecting these new lights because there were no
announcements anywhere. There have been quite a few near-misses in just
a few hours.''
Police were eventually called in to relieve the traffic jams.
Mr Simmons said: ''This all happened because of a combination of
things. We don't really think the sensors were set right to start with
when they were switched on on Wednesday afternoon.
''They didn't seem to detect vehicles in queues which were stationary.
We have spoken to the firm that installed the lights but, unfortunately,
their engineers had already left the island.
''But they're coming back next week and we are looking at maybe
repainting the white lines to make things easier.''
Mr Simmons said another problem appeared to be that island drivers
were too laid-back and unhurried, which made them slow to respond to the
green signal.
''If the sensors do not detect any movement quickly enough, they will
switch the lights to red and give priority to traffic from another
direction,'' he said.
''We may have to set the timing to a slower rate in Stornoway than
perhaps the rest of the country.''
Although there have been two pelican crossings in Stornoway for years,
the new junction, at Mitchell's Garage, is the first one to be
controlled by traffic lights.

A BOY of 15 responsible for a reign of terror on the South Side of
Glasgow, including a double rape on the same woman, was yesterday
ordered to be detained for 10 years.
Lord McCluskey told Calum McLeod that he had given ''very careful''
consideration to the possibility of a life sentence but believed the
public interest could be served by a fixed term of detention.
The judge decided on the 10-year sentence after a plea at the High
Court in Edinburgh by Mr Donald Findlay, QC, defending, to leave his
client with some hope for the future.
He will serve the first few months of his sentence in a secure unit at
a residential home. In October, when he is 16, he will be transferred to
a Young Offenders Institution and be sent to a prison when he is 21.
He will be eligible for parole after serving two thirds of his
sentence.
In the public interest, Lord McCluskey lifted reporting restrictions
which until yesterday barred the media from using McLeod's name in
reports of the case.
The judge told the stockily built 15-year-old that he had been
convicted of five offences involving several horrific attacks on women.
''One of them took the form of a double rape and other sexual abuse
accompanied by sickening violence and terrifying threats.
''The women were strangers to you and were seized in the public
streets or nearby before being dragged into back courts or closes to be
assaulted and humiliated.''
In psychiatric and psychological interviews, McLeod had shown no clear
evidence of remorse or any clear understanding of why he had behaved in
the way he did.
The judge added: ''The most important factor of all is the
need to protect the public and women in particular against a person
such as you convicted of such rapes and other sexual behaviour involving
serious sexual violence.''
He also had to take into account the fact that, apart from a few brief
spells, McLeod's behaviour had been out of control since a very early
age.
Earlier, Mr Findlay described his client as ''clearly retarded
emotionally''. He might look like a big 15-year-old but emotionally and
educationally he had the mind of an 11-year-old and was still a child in
many respects.
All the attacks took place at night last year, two on July 2 and three
on December 2, in the Govanhill area of Glasgow.
Each of the victims was a young woman walking home alone. They were
dragged, some by the hair, into tenement closes.
In one of the attacks, he screamed ''bitch'' as he lashed out.
He told the rape victim, a 31-year-old secretary, he was going to have
sex with her and kill her afterwards. She was terrified into submission,
believing he had a knife.
She was raped in the close then dragged by the hair, barefoot and
bleeding, through back courts to be raped again.
McLeod claimed he had been in prison for two murders and was respected
by other inmates. He asked her: ''Do you respect me?'' She could only
whisper: ''Yes.''
Her ordeal continued as he dragged her through more back courts,
saying he was taking her to his flat. Even when help came to hand, he
still tried to drag her away.
She went limp and he was forced to drop her. However, after running a
few yards away, he returned to kick her twice on the head.
Later the same night, December 2, he pounced on two other victims,
assaulting a 35-year-old social worker in her close then trying to drag
an 18-year-old schoolgirl into a close.
On December 14, a 15-year-old girl came home in terror after being
twice followed by the youth. She told her stepfather, who phoned the
police after seeing him go into a lane. Two officers used their patrol
car's headlamps to illuminate the lane and seconds later McLeod emerged
from a bush and was taken into custody.
Police and the victims had thought the prowler was a young man in his
20s but instead he turned out to be 15, a resident of a nearby
children's home.
Inquiries linked him to two other violent sex attacks in the same area
six months before.
Mr Findlay conceded that the rape was one of the worst he had ever
encountered. He spoke of his client's ''deep-seated aggressive attitude
towards women'' and the level of violence involved in the attacks.
McLeod's parents separated when he was four. For years, he was shunted
from pillar to post, sometimes living with his mother, sometimes with
his father. He had an anti-authoritarian attitude and was put into care
in a residential home at the age of 13.

A MAN was charged last night with murdering seven-year-old Sophie
Hook, whose naked body was found on a north Wales beach on Sunday.
Police said the man was a 30-year-old from Colwyn Bay, who they had
been questioning for four days.
However, they refused to disclose his identity.
He will appear at Llandudno Magistrates Court at 10am today.
Police have staged a huge hunt for clues, carrying out a painstaking
finger-tip search of the fields behind the garden where Sophie was last
seen alive.
Her body was found on a beach at Llandudno, Gwynedd, by a walker at
7.15am on Sunday. She had been sexually assaulted and strangled.
Shortly before the charge was announced, police taped off an area
three-quarters of a mile from the garden where Sophie was last seen
alive.
Detective Inspector Eric Jones refused to confirm or deny reports that
Sophie's Pooh Bear nightdress had been found at this area, off Ferm Bach
Road, near Craig-Y-Don.
Speaking on the steps of Llandudno police station at 10.05pm, he said:
''A few minutes ago a 30-year-old Colwyn Bay man has been charged with
the murder of little Sophie Hook.
''He has also been charged with a further criminal offence which is
unrelated and he will appear at Llandudno magistrates court tomorrow
morning at 10am.''
Sophie, from Great Budworth, near Winsford, Cheshire, was at her uncle
and aunt's house in Llandudno when she disappeared.
She had stayed out the night in the tent with older sister Jemma and
cousin Luke, both nine.

STAGECOACH, the bus firm, was accused yesterday of ''predatory and
deplorable'' actions by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
The MMC report, which blamed the Perth-based firm for the final
collapse of a municipal bus company in Darlington, was arguably the
Government's most searing indictment of Stagecoach. The firm has been
hit by a salvo of unfavourable competition rulings in recent months.
Mr Jonathan Evans, Competition and Consumer Affairs Minister, has
asked the Director General of Fair Trading to seek undertakings from
Stagecoach.
These are aimed at preventing predatory behaviour against competitors
and apply only to the North-east of England, the area covered by the
monopolies investigation.
The move prompted calls for re-regulation of the bus industry in
Scotland from both Labour and the SNP.
Stagecoach is being asked to give assurances that, if a competitor
withdraws after Stagecoach undercuts its fares or increases service
frequencies, it will maintain these new frequencies and fares for at
least three years after the rival's departure.
Undertakings are also being sought that Stagecoach will not operate
services which do not at least cover its variable and semi-variable
costs.
The monopolies inquiry focused on events in Darlington in the latter
part of last year, when Stagecoach lost out in the local council's
planned sale of Darlington Transport Company.
Stagecoach's Newcastle-based Busways subsidiary moved into Darlington,
rapidly recruiting most of DTC's drivers, registering services on all of
its routes, and running free services.
Successful bidder Yorkshire Traction pulled out of the sale and the
council bus company was wound up days later.
The MMC, while acknowledging that DTC was already in a weak and
declining financial position, believes Stagecoach's actions caused the
company's ultimate demise.
It described the company's actions as ''predatory, deplorable, and
against the public interest'', an interpretation rejected by Stagecoach.
Mr John Conroy, managing director of Busways, said last night: ''The
actions taken by Busways in establishing the Stagecoach Darlington
operations were entirely legitimate and proper, reflecting a genuine
desire on the part of the former Darlington Transport employees to work
for Stagecoach.''
He pointed out that another bus company, United, had been taken to
task by the Office of Fair Trading for its behaviour in Darlington
before Stagecoach's arrival.
In spite of yesterday's setback, Stagecoach still sees room to
increase its current UK market share of about 13%.
However, Mr Conroy acknowledged that the requirement that services
should cover costs could inhibit Busways in developing new services.
He conceded there was a possibility that regulations along the lines
of the undertakings sought of Stagecoach could be extended to the UK bus
market in general, although Stagecoach's company secretary, Mr Keith
Cochrane, saw no implication of this sort in yesterday's report.
The company is still considering whether to bow to the undertakings,
some aspects of which it considers unreasonable.
Mr Cochrane said: ''We are very disappointed. We do not think we have
had a fair run with the MMC at all in this particular report.''
Labour's transport spokesman, Mr Henry McLeish, said the MMC and the
Office of Fair Trading had clearly needed to toughen up its regulations
to curb the operations of companies like Stagecoach. ''This report
refers to the worst aspect of Stagecoach activity where good operators
are pushed off the road by powerful companies.
''Stagecoach are now bidding to run large slices of Britain's
railways. But the DTI today proved the Government are not prepared to
act to protect passengers from their anti-competitive behaviour.''
The SNP's transport spokesman, Mr Keith Brown, said the MMC had
confirmed the experience of bus travellers across the UK. ''The real
scandal here is that the Government appears surprised by the activities
of what are, after all, private companies acting in an unregulated
market.
''Instead of concluding that an effective regulatory framework is the
best way forward, Jonathan Evans decides to plead meekly with the
companies involved to provide some minor 'undertakings'.''
Stagecoach also came under fire from the Scottish Consumer Council,
which said consumers welcomed competition only if the benefits were real
and not sweeteners. The organisation's director, Ms Ann Foster, said
that, generally speaking, bus deregulation had not worked in the
consumers' favour.
In April, the Government ordered Stagecoach to sell its 20% stake in
Glasgow-based Strathclyde Buses, on public interest grounds.
The previous month, the Department of Trade and Industry instructed
the company to sell its 20% stake in the South Yorkshire-based Mainline
Partnership bus group. The DTI, in this instance, took even tougher
action than that recommended by the MMC.
Stagecoach is still awaiting the outcome of an MMC inquiry into its
#4.25m purchase in January of Ayrshire Bus Owners (A1 Buses) in North
Ayrshire.
Like Western Scottish, which was acquired by Stagecoach for about #6m
last July, A1 is based in Kilmarnock.
Yesterday's MMC report also addressed complaints by Hylton Castle
Motors, a small operator in South Shields, that Busways had threatened
to force it out of the market if it would not sell out to Stagecoach.
The MMC concluded Busways had threatened Hylton and that the
Stagecoach subsidiary's price reductions were predatory and against the
public interest.
Mr Evans was concerned by the MMC's general observation that there
appeared to be little competition between the larger bus operators and
indicated this could have a bearing on legislation.
In spite of its run-ins with the Government, Stagecoach's business is
booming.
Only last week, the company reported a 72% increase in annual pre-tax
profits to a record #32.6m.
Industry analysts consider Stagecoach strong enough to ride out the
regulatory storm in the UK bus industry.
The company has pre-qualified as a potential bidder for the first
eight rail franchises to be offered to the private sector, including
ScotRail.
It is also keen to expand its overseas bus operations and recently
moved into Portugal.
Stagecoach shares yesterday dipped 6p to 238p.

REBEL Serbs in Croatia said last night that they were ready to
negotiate with Zagreb to avert outright war, after Croatian forces had
mobilised thousand of troops.
As diplomats scrambled to broker a compromise, Serb shells hit the
Dubrovnik area on Croatia's coast.
Three people were killed and three seriously wounded in the shelling
of the hinterland north and south of Dubrovnik, Croatian officials said.
The Bosnian Serb army had warned it would bombard the walled town,
just six miles from its artillery positions, unless Croats stopped
shelling the Serb town of Drvar in west Bosnia.
However, last night, an American mediator said a leader of the rebel
Krajina Serbs had offered significant concessions so that there was now
no reason for Croatia to go to war.
The US ambassador to Croatia, Mr Peter Galbraith, said Krajina Serb
''prime minister'' Milan Babic had agreed to hold talks on the
''peaceful re-integration'' into Croatia of Serb-held areas.
The United States is by far the most influential Western power in
Croatia but there was no immediate response from the government in
Zagreb to Babic's offer.
In an abrupt reversal for Croatia's rebel Serbs, Babic told reporters
in Belgrade they were prepared to hold talks with the Zagreb government
based on a proposed international peace plan.
''On my part, I can state that we are ready to enter negotiations on a
political solution with Zagreb,'' Babic said.
He said a ''modified and improved'' version of the so-called Z-4 plan
drafted by the United States, Russia, the United Nations, and the
European Union could serve as a basis for talks.
The Krajina Serbs had previously refused to talk to Zagreb but a big
Croat offensive in western Bosnia last week advanced to within miles
from the now cut-off Serb stronghold of Knin.
Ambassador Galbraith said Babic had told the Serb delegation holding
last-ditch talks in Geneva to carry out his pledges. The Croatians in
Geneva consider the talks to have broken down.
However, UN mediator Thorvald Stoltenberg said the discussions in
Geneva could yet help to avert a new war. ''We did not reach an
agreement but I felt it is not far away,'' he told reporters.
He did not elaborate but said he would go to Zagreb today and would
also visit Knin and the Serbian capital of Belgrade for more
discussions.
Croatian delegation member Ivica Pasalic did not share Stoltenberg's
cautious optimism. ''Unfortunately, as far as the content of the talks
is concerned, in my personal opinion there was no progress,'' he said.
In Sarajevo, Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic has quit his post
in a surprise move that officials said was intended to force his
government to back him in a dispute with the country's foreign minister,
Muhamed Sacribey.
Sacirbey, a clean cut American-educated lawyer, switched from a high
profile role as ambassador to the UN to his present job in May when his
predecessor was killed. He is close to Bosnian President Alia
Izetbegovic.
