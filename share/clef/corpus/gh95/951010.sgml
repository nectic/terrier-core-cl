BOGHEAD is a soggy name even for a football park. To Dumbarton fans it
is hallowed ground. In more than one way they have stuck to their field
most loyally. No other club has so well kept is roots. That's official.
''They have the longest occupancy of a single ground in British
football,'' it is recorded in The Sons of the Rock, the club history of
Dumbarton. (They call themselves the Sons for thoroughly good, if
totally forgotten, reasons.)
Why the Sons came to settle at Boghead is a puzzle. For football it
was about the worst of pitches as well as the best. It was ideally
situated, a more or less level bit of land a handy half-mile from town.
Its problem was to be less level than most. And the surrounding
countryside drained into it.
Visiting teams little liked its hills and valleys. Some renamed it
Bannockburn because they found it a battlefield. Their hopes of winning
sank in its glaur.
Severe comeuppance could be suffered at Dumbarton even by giant
visitors. Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest both fell at Boghead in one
season. But that wasn't this season. It was not this century.
When the Sons set up their stall, as the lads on the back pages like
to say, it was in 1879.
Not for that long, but near enough, Dick Jackson has been in or about
Boghead. He has become a more permanent feature than the goalposts. One
way and another he has cherished the place most days for 60 years.
He repaired the terracing when it was an embankment of railway
sleepers. He cleared up after games. He took the players' shirts to the
wash. About every backstage job has been his. On mornings he is first in
and last to leave at night. He stills mows the sward.
Dumbarton call him their kit man, apt title. For his gift hamper to
football is as big as anybody's. After being the unlisted team player
for so many seasons, tonight is his night.
Ahead of a birthday dinner at the weekend, this evening (at 7.30pm)
has a testimonial match for Dick Jackson. Dumbarton play Rangers. At
half-time some renowned former Sons will contest a sevens game. It will
be a salute of field guns to an off-the-field hero.
Dick Jackson will be in his usual place. Attempts to elevate him to
the directors' box failed. In a quietly firm way he said: ''There is no
way I'm going to sit down to watch any football match.'' He'll be there
as ever, standing outside the home dugout.
With Walter Smith, the manager of Rangers and a former Son, he looks
forward to their usual chat. Dick Jackson will recall a goal that Mr
Smith scored in his Dumbarton days. In a cup semi-final at Hampden it
was one of the most magnificent ever witnessed by Boghead loyalists.
''What a header!'' Dick Jackson can enthuse as if it happened last
Saturday. Only it was in 1976, the other joke being that the goal was
for the other side.
He recalled how the late Sir Hugh Fraser, a club chairman, took a
sudden notion for fitness. Dick Jackson would open the park on Sundays
so that the owner could lap the track and take a sauna. ''He was a
gentleman, and I'm sure the exercise did him good,'' he said loyally.
''Except he smoked all the time, even in the bath.''
Being on hand seven days a week has been no problem. ''It's my life is
Dumbarton. I'm more here than at home. Time is nothing to me,'' he
explained.
Boghead's neighbours in their houses know that well. The park's roller
gate used to open like a medieval portcullis. On winter mornings that
part of Dumbarton awoke to the clang of Dick Jackson going to his work
at 6am, although sometimes he was as much as an hour later.
''If he was paid by the hour, the club would be bankrupt,'' Murdo
MacLeod, a former manager, liked to say.
Boghead is a great place to become weel kent in the game. Multitudes
have passed that way because Dumbarton has changed managers, and
directors, as often as fancier clubs change their away strips. Many
players have come and gone, either on their way up or, later in their
careers, moving the other way.
So many want to attend a birthday dinner on Sunday that the venue
(good old football word) has been switched from Dumbarton to a Glasgow
West End hotel.
For the occasion Dick Jackson has made his first personal demand from
his club. He has written his own menu. Whatever other guests more
accustomed to sporting banquets will be given to eat, Dick Jackson will
decline to sit down unless it is to fish and chips. He is 80.

Glasgow earmarked for Britain's biggest pub.
FAST-growing pub chain JD Wetherspoon is hoping to open Britain's
biggest hostelry some time next year in Glasgow, dwarfing the Horse Shoe
Bar which is reputedly the busiest in the British Isles after one in
Dublin.
Wetherspoon chief executive Glasgow-born Mark McQuater refused to
divulge where the new pub will be situated for reasons of commercial
sensitivity. But he said it would have some 5000 sq ft of floor space,
which he reckons would make it about a third larger than the Caledonian
Brewers-owned Horse Shoe. He is hoping to open pubs in both Aberdeen and
Edinburgh possibly late next year.
Wetherspoon, which was founded by Tim Martin in 1983, increased
pre-tax profits in the year to July by 50% to #9.71m on turnover 47%
ahead at #68.5m. Underlying like-for-like sales were up by 6% as it took
business away from other pub operators.
The emphasis is on large High Street outlets with beer selling at
prices about 6% below the competition -- food accounts for just 15% of
sales. Typically these are opened in buildings such as former banks, a
few more of which seem likely to come on to the market. Their lack of
music is an attraction for many customers.
At present, the busiest of the 114 is Hamilton Hall at London's
Liverpool Street Station. It has an annual turnover of #2.5m, largely
attributable to Essex man and woman relaxing after a hard day in the
City, particularly on Friday evenings.
Profits growth was due to 23 new openings -- for the current year 32
new applications have been made for licences. Thanks to its increasing
volumes, Wetherspoon is able to obtain beer at highly competitive prices
and has new five-year agreements with both Scottish &amp; Newcastle and
Courage, which as Scottish Courage accounts for the highest proportion
of sales. This include Youngers Scotch Bitter at 99p a pint.
Increased buying power will help gross margins this year as will more
careful attention to design, which will reduce development costs from
the current #800,000 or so.
Capital expenditure will run at about #35m annually for the next five
years, by which time the business should be self-financing with perhaps
300 pubs in operation. However, there will be a funding operation in two
or three years -- the last was a rights issue in March last year to
raise #22m.
Like-for-like sales are running at 3.5% ahead in August and September
-- being on the High Street, the pubs benefit less than those in the
suburbs from hot weather.
Current-year profts should rise to about #12.5m to leave the shares at
630p trading at 19 times likely earnings which is discounting a fair bit
of growth.
The dividend total has been raised 21% to 8p for a 1.6% yield.

<HEADLINE>#10m tag a wind-up, says Rae</HEADLINE>

MILLWALL midfielder Alex Rae laughed off his #10m price tag as he flew
into Stockholm yesterday. Rae will play a key role in Scotland's B team
against the Swedes in their capital tonight, but he did not relish the
star billing which had been given to him by his club manager, former
Celtic player Mick McCarthy, writes Ken Gallacher.
''I think the manager is joking about this,'' said Rae. ''I'm sure
it's all a bit of a wind-up, but having said that I am not here to make
up the numbers. I want to stake my own claim for the European
Championship Finals.''
Rae, of course, is one of these players who have been brought up
through the various grades by Scotland manager Craig Brown. He has been
capped at all levels and Brown has watched over his progress. It seems
significant that he is now here in the B international category with the
European Championships looming.
Rae says: ''I feel I am playing well with my club and, obviously, when
you are not in the top flight it is good to know that Scotland remain
watching you.''
Brown has always said that there is a line between the youth team, the
under-21 team, and the full international side and Rae, once freed by
Rangers, is now a candidate to go all through that run.
The B side are adopting the ''three at the back'' style which has been
so effective for Scotland in their European Championship qualifying
group.
There is no doubt that Brown wants to see this employed as often as
possible when there are the players who are comfortable in that
situation.
He has that at first team level, now he is looking for players who can
slot into the top team if he has problems there.
There is no doubt that the men who play tonight will be looking
towards England next summer -- and that is the way Brown will want
things. The Scotland side to meet the Swedes tonight will be:
Nicky Walker (Partick Thistle), Brian Martin (Motherwell), Steven
Tweed (Hibs), Derek Whyte (Middlesbrough); Paul Telfer (Coventry),Scott
Gemmill (Notts Forest), Paul Bernard (Aberdeen), Alex Rae (Millwall),
Rob McKinmon (Motherwell); Gerry Creaney (Manchester City), Duncan
Shearer (Aberdeen).

Midlands 49, North 0
MIDLANDS opened their Bank of Scotland schools under-18 inter district
championship campaign with an easy victory win over North at Dunblane
yesterday. Neither side gained much from this encounter albeit that
Midlands finished with a haul of nine tries.
Midlands did not have an effective opposition to play off and all
their offensive rugby tended to be from set-piece play. There also was a
tendency for the backs, fed with an over-generous supply of ball, either
to overcomplicate moves or to take on too much individually.
North defended strongly for much of the game, left wing Richard
Bowditch and No.8 Doug Noble showing up well.
Midlands led 22-0 at half-time with tries by Steve McKinnon, Greig
Mason, Martin Wallace, and Chris Milne with one conversion from Mason.
In the second half, Milne and Mason crossed for second tries before
lock forward Robbie Steven barged over for his side's seventh score.
Flanker Simon Taylor touched down for Milne to convert and a final
offensive resulted in McKinnon's second try.
Midlands -- G Lawson (Dollar Acad); S Walker (Dollar Acad), C
Carnochan (Dollar Acad), P Hudson (Dollar Acad), C Milne (Dundee HS); G
Mason (Dollar Acad), S Keatch (Dundee HS) capt; M Wallace (Dollar Acad)
replaced by J Nelson (Queen Victoria School), S McKinnon (Queen Victoria
School), I MacKay (Morrison's Acad) replaced by M Welch (Dunfermline
HS), R Steven (Madras Coll), A Blackhurst (Queen Victoria School), S
Taylor (Morrison's Acad), D Duncan (Dollar Acad), J Cornelius (Queen
Victoria School).
North -- S Colling (Aberdeen GS) replaced by S Fowlie (Aberdeen GS); R
Bowditch (Banff Acad), D Macdonald (Gordon Schools), R Forster (Ellon
Acad), J MacAllister (Millburn Acad) replaced by D Moss (Forres Acad); J
Mitchell (Aberdeen GS), P Smith (Millburn Acad); A Frost (Aberdeen GS)
capt, B Williams (Forres Acad), A Averell (Gordon Schools), D McDonald
(Millburn Acad), C Duncan (Portree HS), A Ross (Elgin Acad), D Noble
(Nairn Acad), A Sim (Millburn Acad).
Referee J Bacigalupo (Edinburgh Wanderers).
Under-16 result -- Midlands 36, North 7.

<TEXT>
OSLO's police have vowed to crush hooliganism at the outset prior to
the game between Norway and England tomorrow night.
The last time the English national team played abroad, in February,
was in Dublin. That game was abandoned after 27 minutes because of a
riot by English fans in which 30 were arrested.
Norwegian police, working closely with British colleagues, plan to bar
known English hooligans from even entering the country, much less the
sold-out Ullevaal stadium in downtown Oslo for tomorrow's exhibition
game.
About 400 regular English fans have tickets, although many more --
including hooligans -- may try to come.
''We expect that up to 300 will try to come without tickets, either to
make trouble or to try to get a ticket,'' Oystein Berger of the Oslo
police said yesterday.
''We know the identities of just under 100 of them. These are people
who are so active that they have been convicted of violence in the past.
These are people we can stop at the Border under Norway's immigration
law without further ado,'' he told the Norwegian news agency NTB.
Berger said police found no evidence to support rumours that up to 300
tickets were sold to members of the British neo-Nazi group Combat 18.
Some fear that another outbreak of violence by traveling English fans
could jeopardize England's status as host of the European championships.
About 20 undercover English police will travel with the English fans.
English hooligans caused widespread trouble at the last two European
Championships, in Germany in 1988 and in Sweden in 1992. The last
Norway-England game in Oslo, in 1993, went smoothly, although about 85
English fans were arrested after a post-game bar brawl.

<HEADLINE>Injured keeper shows he's still in Brown's plans. Goram gains half a chance</HEADLINE>

SCOTLAND goalkeeper Andy Goram has confirmed to manager Craig Brown
that he wants to play for his country. The doubts which existed over the
misunderstanding between the player, his club, and Brown have
evaporated.
Now we have Goram travelling with the Scotland squad even though he is
not 100 per cent fit to play.
In Stockholm last night, Brown said: ''I think this shows Andy's
allegiance to the team. He has a hip injury and the doctor here told us
that he could easily have pulled out of the squad. It says a lot for him
that he did not do so.''
Goram, involved in so much controversy at the start of the season, did
not wish to make too much comment on the current issue. He said simply:
''Anyone is happy to be with Scotland.''
Brown has not said yet how he will deploy his goalkeeping force. But
it seems likely that Goram will play for one half of the game against
Sweden with Jim Leighton playing for the other. That seemed yesterday
not to be the one issue Brown had to contend with.
Scott Booth who travelled with the squad is likely to be out; captain
Gary McAllister is another who may miss the match, but who has travelled
to the Swedish capital to show solidarity.
Said Brown: ''We will not risk anyone if that will affect them when
they return to their clubs.
''We will look at all the players closer to the game and then make up
our minds. This is important for them, and important for Scotland.
''We have to look towards qualification and what will happen after
that.''
Brown did not name a team, but he did indicate that John Robertson, of
Hearts, who hasscored three times in 15 games for the national team,
will play.
Brown has already said that he feels embarrassed at leaving Robertson
out after the player's efforts on his behalf. But yesterday, the
Tynecastle striker shrugged that off. He said: ''That really does not
matter to me. I have no worries about Craig Brown leaving me out of
squads. He has always kept me in touch and that has been important.
''I think at the moment I am playing well for my club, despite the
results we are getting. I am scoring goals.
''There have been times when I have felt that I have been pushed back
into the shadows but, really, I have to look at this as a chance to go
forward again and to be there with the team in England next summer.
''I know there are people who are not here, and not available. But I
think that this is a chance for me to prove myself. I will be looking at
it that way.
''After all, I have only had seven starts for Scotland. Now, if I am
getting this one, I can score and show exactly what I am good at.''
Midfielder Billy McKinlay looks sure to start the game. Despite the
transfer talk which swirls around him, the player remains committed to
the match this midweek.
He knows that afterwards, he must make up his mind -- but there seems
little doubt that he will be moving to Blackburn Rovers.
Brown will not worry about McKinlay's attitude. He will simply see a
player anxious to remain in his squad, and eager to prove to his
potential employers that he is a class act.
Scotland coach Brown, of course, sees this game as important in his
build-up to the finals -- though he still refuses to accept his side are
there.
He said: ''We are not certain yet to be there. We may be there
tomorrow, depending on the result of the game between Russia and Greece.
''But the main thing for us at the moment is having continuity of
performance and in personnel. We can't have both, but we do have players
who will be here and who will play a part next summer if we go to
England.

TOP players face being frozen out of British ice hockey because
documents handed-over by some players with Canadian backgrounds don't
prove their claims to be UK citizens.
British Ice Hockey Association officials have told clubs not to ice
the star men in question until the mess is sorted out. If they do, and
the player's registration is not confirmed, clubs will lose all games
5-0.
Ayr-based league administrator Frank Dempster has faxed a warning to
all British league clubs after a high-level meeting with London-based
Canadian Embassy officials.
In it he said: ''Clubs and players have 28 days to produce the right
paperwork. If the player either cannot produce the required letter, or
is deemed a Canadian citizen, all games the player played in will be
forfeited by a 5-0 scoreline and the player declared ineligible.''
Last night one leading club official -- who declined to be named --
said: ''It's about time they acted and it's no surprise that the
paperwork is being questioned. There are so many ''British'' players in
the sport it's hard for home-bred talent to get a game.
''It's leading to cheque-book hockey with clubs buying their way to
the top with alleged British players. It's a joke.''

LIVE coverage of Scotland's tour to New Zealand next summer will be
available only on satellite television. No decision has yet been taken
on whether terrestrial broadcasters like BBC and ITV will have access to
delayed transmission rights or highlight packages.
During the summer Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation secured exclusive
broadcasting rights to all international and representative rugby played
in New Zealand, South Africa, and Australia.
The 10-year deal, which runs from 1996 and which is worth #370m, also
gives the Murdoch organisation world-wide TV rights to all incoming
tours. But when the agreement was signed in South Africa during the
World Cup it was unclear whether the rights to the Scotland tour would
be open to bidding from rival broadcasters or whether the Murdoch
organisation's British broadcasting arm BSkyB would retain them for
themselves.
A BSkyB spokesman in London confirmed yesterday that Sky Sports would
broadcast the games live. ''We will certainly be broadcasting the games
in the UK. Whether or not there will be secondary broadcast rights for
terrestrial companies is too soon to say. That will be negotiated nearer
the time,'' he added.
Critics of the pay-for-view broadcasting offered by BSkyB maintain
that as the organisation brings its huge spending power to bear on major
sporting events -- most recently the Ryder Cup which has been added to
football, rugby league and English club rugby union -- large numbers of
viewers who do not wish to purchase access to satellite or cable
facilities are denied the opportunity to watch.
Yesterday, BSkyB said that they did not have readily accessible
figures available for the number of people in Scotland with access to
Sky Sports. ''We are a national network and don't give regional
breakdowns like the terrestrial broadcasters.''
Bill Hogg, the SRU chief executive, said last night that the Union
would be disappointed if there was no suitable non-satellite coverage of
the tour.
''We were quite happy with regard to the Five Nations that there
should be this deal we have with the BBC and Sky but it is of concern to
us that many people without satellite TV will be denied the opportunity
to watch the Scotland side in New Zealand.
''Until now the New Zealand RFU has sold the rights to ITV which meant
that everybody could see the games. However, the Southern Hemisphere
unions now have an agreement with Mr Murdoch. We live in a changing
world and there is nothing that we can do about it,'' he said.
Mike Abbott, head of sport at BBC Scotland, said yesterday: ''Once
News Corporation had done the deal with the Southern Hemisphere unions
then it was always likely to be the case that if there was a Murdoch
channel available and appropriate then they would bring it into the
country live and that's what's happened.
''They've now got the deal to show Scotland in New Zealand and that's
something that we have to live with. We'll have to think about secondary
rights when they become available.
''Sky are doing live club rugby from England but, as I understand it,
they have no plans to do any games from Scotland. We are committed to
the Scottish club game and, of course, we'll still be doing the Five
Nations.
''They have the money to buy up these big sporting events like the
Ryder Cup and because of the budgetary constraints that the BBC is
operating under, we are not in a position to pay the kind of money that
Sky can. However, from the viewers' point of view it's terrible news.
''With the Ryder Cup I suppose Sky would argue that people without
satellite access could watch it in golf clubs and so on but I don't
think that is likely to be the case with live, middle-of-the-night
transmission of Scotland's games in New Zealand,'' he said.
ITV Sport has broken through into international rugby coverage with
the World Cup and regular coverage of tours to the Southern Hemisphere.
Andrew Chowns, ITV Sport controller of legal and business affairs,
said yesterday: ''It is a tough old game but, so far as the viewer is
concerned, all that it means is that the public are denied free TV
access to a large number of sporting events.
''Rights to a significant number of sporting events are been snapped
up by satellite. So far as I know the rights to this tour were never
offered to any other broadcaster. As part of the Murdoch deal they just
went straight to Sky. Nobody else even had the opportunity to bid. It
may be good for Sky but it is not good for the very large number of
people who are denied free TV access to sport,'' he said.
* THE Scottish Rugby Union and representatives of the national squad
will meet on October 16 when draft contracts will be on the agenda. The
Union has said that it wants to have the squad under contract by the
first international of the season on November 18 against Western Samoa.

PENDER Uddingston have made a disastrous start on their return to the
first division of the men's National League.
They have conceded 37 goals in four games and have yet to score a goal
or win a point, but a better day could be on the horizon.
The second-round draw for the Scottish Cup has put them at home on
October 29 to Kirkcaldy, who are pointless and propping up the fourth
division.
Most first-division clubs have come out of the draw well. Six of them,
including defending champions Touche Ross Gordonians and beaten
finalists Western, have drawn opposition from the second division. Both
will journey to Stirlingshire to meet Stirling and Grangemouth
respectively.
Grange, the league champions, have been less fortunate. They will be
involved in the only all-first division clash against Clydesdale, who
could prove stubborn opponents. The draw is:
Grange v Clydesdale; MIM v Westcars Motherwell; Malacca Ruthrieston v
Dundee Univ; Pender Uddingston v Kirkcaldy; Insights Inverleith v
Watsonians; Menzieshill v Harris; Stirling v Touche Ross Gordonians;
Madras College FP v Comware Carnegie; Inveresk v Morgan; Clydebank v
Ellon Gordon; Greenock v Edinburgh Univ; Cochrane Park v Hazlehead;
Perthshire v Torbrex Wanderers; Stepps v Kelburne; Grangemouth v
Western; Waverley v Stronachs AG SFP.
Ties to be played on Sunday, October 29.

ABERDEEN and Motherwell yesterday did their best to put transfer
speculation surrounding a couple of their players into the ''out'' tray
but will probably accept that the stories will not end there. The Dons'
manager, Roy Aitken, insisted that none of his top players was
available, having turned down the latest approach for Eoin Jess, who
would have been the subject of a #2.5m bid from Bolton, given any
encouragement.
Aitken, who has more than #1m left from his part of the recent share
issue, says he will be spending again instead of selling off his main
assets.
The manager added that he had dismissed enquiries for Jess and other
first-team players: ''Managers at top clubs receive calls constantly
asking about the availability of players,'' he said. ''I make a point of
letting it be known right from the start that none of my first-team
squad is for sale. My priority is to build a team which will get this
club back challenging for major honours.''
Motherwell manager Alex McLeish was in similar mode when asked about
the presence of Bolton's assistant manager Colin Todd at their match on
Saturday, which prompted speculation that the English club was ready to
bid for full back Rob McKinnon.
''Rob is a key player in my set-up here at Motherwell and I have no
intention of letting him go,'' McLeish said. ''I'm aware Bolton's
assistant manager was here at the weekend but he could have been
watching anyone.''

INEVITABLY, as Paul McStay missed Scotland's trip to Sweden, the old
rumour factory conjured up stories of fearful injury, but assistant
manager Billy Stark yesterday reported his man in good fettle -- not so
good news for Paris St Germain, who see McStay as a threat to their
progress into the third round of the Cup-winners' Cup.
Stark said that McStay could have played on Saturday but he needed a
further rest following the slight groin strain he had suffered as a
result of too many games too quickly after a long absence.
McStay is one of several Celtic players who have impressed Saint
Germain's assistant coach, Joel Bats, who has been busy spying on the
Parkhead club in the past 10 days or so. ''I like the look of McStay and
John Collins in midfield. They play the game neatly with good passing,
and have the ability to link well.
''In defence, Tom Boyd is a good, solid player and I have been most
impressed by Tosh McKinlay.''
''I have been surprised by the way Celtic played,'' said Bats, a
former French international keeper. ''They have a very technically
gifted midfield who prefer a neat passing game rather than the long-ball
tactics. However, I've noticed when they get to the penalty box they
have trouble.''
In other words, despite his worthy assessment of the Scots, he expects
his team to win. It would be strange indeed if he felt otherwise.

<HEADLINE>What a battle - Geneva Generals v Brussels Bureaucrats. Empire strikes back in war over transfers</HEADLINE>

UEFA never were likely to treat the threat to their empire lightly,
but the campaign they appear determined to mount against the might of
the European Union, whose legal minds are threatening the very
fundamentals of football, will be the most potent they have ever put
together. It could be the most exciting European tie of the decade.
The Generals of Geneva versus the Bureaucrats of Brussels.
There had been an ominous silence from UEFA since the European Court
of Justice's Advocate General, Carl Otto Lenz, issued his opinion on the
Jean-Marc Bosman case which brought football's transfer system into
question, but the governing body have come out fighting. It is their
intention now to win the support of the various governments within the
EC.
The leaders of the member associations of UEFA have had two meetings
-- the first in Porto a few weeks ago, and the second in London last
week -- and within the next week or so, their strategy to repel the
threat from without will be finalised. ''All member associations are
aware of the consequences and they realise we are all facing a very
serious problem,'' said UEFA's president Lennart Johansson, who is
fighting wars on two fronts because of his differences with FIFA
president Joao Havelange.
However, the repercussions of the Bosman case are Johansson's priority
because they jeopardise football's financial structure, and UEFA are
determined to stand against the EC. The Advocate General's opinion is
expected to be supported by the judges of the European Court of Justice
and made law later this year. That could mean an end to transfers and
also the three-foreigners rule which Rangers have been fighting against.
Indeed, the Ibrox club's desire to win the right of fielding as many
non Scots as they see fit puts them at odds with the SFA, but Rangers
are willing to go beyond their own boundaries and seek support from
Europe's larger clubs, particualrly the Italians. Also, Donald Findlay
QC, Rangers' vice-president, will write to EC commissioners to have
Lenz's deliberation accepted.
It is a touch ironic, however, that while the Scottish Professional
Footballers' Association are delighted with the Bosman ruling, and, in
common with Rangers, are determined, as members of FIF PRo (the
federation of Euoropean players' unions), to go against UEFA, they would
be willing to see the game's restriction on foreign players remain in
force in Scotland. Their's would seem to be the most reasonable stand,
yet for years they have been ingnored by UEFA.
In fact, it is only in the past year or so that UEFA have started to
deal with FIF PRo, but only on an unofficial basis, although the
likelihood now is that relationships will have to be cemented.
UEFA believe they can still go against European law with the help of
sympathetic governments and they will play various strong cards to help
their cause. For instance, the SFA's chief executive, Jim Farry, has
already highlighted the possible loss of VAT money if transfers are
abolished.
If the accumulative transfer fee in Britain were to run at #100m a
year, then the government would lose around #20m annually and that is a
figure which is likely to frighten any leadership. However, the Bosman
case is all about an individual's rights and freedom, and UEFA will have
to do some powerful lobbying.
UEFA intend to win enough support to have their case raised at the
next Inter-Continental Government Conference. Clearly, it is UEFA's
intention to go as far as they can towards having last month's judgment
reversed, but by having unofficial links with FIF PRo, they can always
appeal to the players at the eleventh hour. If there is a touch of
hypocrisy in their approach no one should be surprised.
However, they are playing a dangerous game. The players feel they have
gained a crucial advantage, and if their needs are not given due regard
now, the players' associations might become as intransigent as UEFA and
those members who have denied them rights all these years.
''The French and Spanish already are all for complete freedom of
movement with no strings attached,'' said Tony Higgins, secretary of the
Scottish Professional Footballers' Association, ''and if UEFA are not
careful, they could push the players into a position where they would
not be willing to offer any support.''
The players have always been willing to compromise because it isn't in
their interests to bring the game to its knees, but the transfer system
had to be overhauled. Apart from it being unlawful in a free world, it
is also morally wrong and UEFA must realise this.
Only compromise will produce a fair system, but UEFA do not sound in
the mood to deal with anyone other than those who may see it their way.
When Farry spoke the other day, he did not mention the need to draw the
players into the campaign and that is a fundamental flaw in UEFA's
approach.
Also, Johansson remains extremely bullish. ''You will all have heard
of the European Union and the increasing influence of Brussels,'' he
said.''UEFA is far bigger than the European Union,'' he added. ''We have
49 members whereas the EU have only 15.
''The latest interference concerns the transfer system and the rules
on non-selectable players which are both key elements in the regulatory
structure of football. We cannot tolerate this continued interference.''
The arrogance of UEFA is astonishing and talking like this will leave
them without many government friends. However, Johnsson is never one to
shirk a skirmish and he has been involved in a power struggle with
Havelange.
In an attempt to avoid further confrontation, FIFA have agreed to set
up a commission to study UEFA's proposals to overhaul the sport's
organisation.
Johansson has two visions, the first of which would have the World Cup
finals rotated automatically between continents to avoid the political
infighting which dominates site selection. FIFA's central role would be
reduced and their decision-making executive committee would be reformed.
Vision two would boost World Cup income to at least $800m by
overhauling the sale of television and marketing rights.
Although UEFA have the support of the African nations they are not
expected to push through their proposals because 79-year-old Havelange's
hold on world football remains powerful -- although he and Johansson sat
together when they met to discuss the way ahead.

* BOB Dwyer, sacked by Australia last Friday, could be named as the
new Ireland coach by the end of the week.
The Irish Rugby Football Union's three-man election sub-committee, who
appoint the national selectors and coach, are believed to have held
talks with Dwyer yesterday about the possibility of him replacing Gerry
Murphy.
Dwyer is currently coaching Racing Club de Paris in France and also
has business interests in Australia which place a question mark over
whether he would accept the Ireland job.
* WESTERN Province Rugby Union has cited Free State No.8 Jaco Coetzee
for dirty play following their Currie Cup match in Bloemfontein, the
South African Rugby Football Union said yesterday.
A statement said the case would be heard at Ellis Park tomorrow. It
said the citing followed ''various incidents'' during the match on
Saturday.
Coetzee punched Province prop Tommie Laubscher in clear view of the
television cameras and is also alleged to have raked centre Tinus Linee.

TERRY Venables dropped a broad hint yesterday that he wants to take
England beyond next summer's European Championship finals in this
country and on to the 1998 World Cup in France.
The England coach, who has rejected an approach from Italian giants
Inter Milan, will meet the FA in the next week or two to discuss his
contract and the possibility of becoming the new technical director.
But Venables is growing in to the challenge of shaping his country's
football future and insisted today: ''I'm enjoying it more and more.''
Now he hopes to thrash out his future before the finals start in June.
He said: ''It's no good coming out of the tournament and having to sort
everything out inside a week.''
The FA admitted that they hope to sort out the technical director's
appointment early next year, which may result in the job being offered
to Venables.
Both roles cannot be combined, and Leeds manager Howard Wilkinson and
Switzerland's English manager Roy Hodgson are among the names also under
consideration.
* JOHN Sheridan is out of the Republic of Ireland's crucial European
Championship qualifying match against Latvia in Dublin tomorrow night.
The Sheffield Wednesday midfielder, who has been struggling with a
knee injury, was sent home yesterday after it became clear he would not
be able to take part in the match Jack Charlton's team must win to keep
alive their hopes of qualifying for the finals in England next summer.
* JIM Magilton dealt Northern Ireland manager Bryan Hamilton a new
blow just before his party flew out of Heathrow for the European
qualifier in Liechtenstein.
The Southampton midfielder was all set to travel despite a heavily
bruised leg picked up in training. But an overnight reaction meant that
Hamilton was forced to rule out the experienced Magilton.
West Ham utility player Keith Rowland has been called up as a
replacement.
* GERMANY, despite a 6-1 thrashing of Moldova at the weekend, are
under no illusions about their task against Wales in tomorrow's European
championship qualifier in Cardiff.
The Germans, second in Group 7 behind Bulgaria, can clinch their place
at next year's finals with a victory.
Wales managed a 1-1 draw in Duesseldorf in their first qualifying
clash last April and beat the Germans 1-0 on their last visit to Cardiff
for another European championship qualifier in 1991.

IT is understandable that Lucas should be contemplating getting out of
aerospace altogether given the costly disaster in the US, but it would
surely be premature to take such a step when an upturn in demand appears
to be at last round the corner.
The aerospace market has been depressed for several years as defence
spending has been under pressure and airlines have been making heavy
losses. However, the market is at last starting to turn although it will
be a couple of years yet before it starts really growing.
There is enormous pent-up demand from airlines to re-equip with the
latest and most efficient aircraft and their financial position is
gradually improving. So the sector could be a long-term growth market
again within a few years and it would be worth Lucas hanging on,
particularly as it has particular strengths in fly-by-wire technology.
In fact, the aerospace market may pick up as automotive is slacking
off which would come in handy for keeping profits on a rising trend.
There is no reason why the disaster in the US should affect the rest
of the aerospace activities. The US problems were essentially
procedural. The products concerned, aircraft gearboxes, exceeded the
quality requirements but the quality monitoring procedures laid down in
the contract were not strictly adhered to.
The whole dispute derived from that. Lucas made the right decision to
settle quickly even at great cost rather than face the uncertainties of
litigation in American courts.
Freed of the US burden and with a new management team installed,
aerospace should now be the recovery element of Lucas's portfolio,
which, even if world class, is rather narrowly based on vehicle brakes,
diesel fuel systems and electronics.

Andrew Lochhead on Fife's college-to-business hi-tech pioneers
TWELVE lucky firms in Fife are taking part in a pioneering research
project run by Fife College of Further and Higher Education. Free of any
major investment on their part, they have the chance to develop their
staff's business skills in-house without the cost and disruption of
external courses or specialist consultants.
The Telematics project is the first of its kind in Britain for the
programme of training it offers to SMEs (small/medium-sized
enterprises).
After a recent meeting at 10 Downing Street involving the Federation
of Small Businesses, Gillian Shepherd asked to be kept informed about
the project. Fife Enterprise has also lent support with funding.
Ann Justice, senior manager of Kirkcaldy-based Fife College's SME
Centre, summarises the benefits when she says: ''The Telematics project
uses the most up-to-date technology to provide SMEs with training that
is relevant, flexible and accessible.''
Under the control of Sandy Stevenson, computing and IT manager in
charge of the project, each firm has been provided with a computer
linked by a modem to the college via the telephone and cable network.
With access to training materials in the form of computer-based learning
software packages, training programmes can be customised and carried out
on their own premises at the time and in the order best suited to their
own needs. The only costs relate to telephone use and course fees, which
are subsidised.
The range of packages on offer is extensive, both in terms of subjects
and grades of study -- from business disciplines to languages and IT
applications such as database management and multi-media. Users have the
choice of being assessed for formal qualifications.
In theory, the technical requirements for such a training scheme,
notably the high quality and diversity of current computer-based
training packages and the advances in telecommunications, have long been
in place.
However, Fife College, through its SME centre, deserves much credit
for its initiative in raising the funding to launch such a project which
responds to the IT needs of the SMEs. As opinion is voiced from all
quarters on the need to foster the partnership between business and
education, the college's lead could be vital for revealing the practical
benefits the SME sector could reap from such co-operation.
Ann Justice echoes the sentiments of Bob Downes, director of industry
and skills at Scottish Enterprise, that ''colleges are an undervalued
part of our assets for improving training''. Recognition of Fife
College's achievement in raising their profile came in a recent visit by
the Scottish Office Minister for Education, Raymond Robertson.
The Telematics scheme was developed in partnership with the Bank of
Scotland, United Artists and the Federation of Small Businesses.
The award of the project marks the culmination of the business
training programme run from the SME centre, which was set up with
financial support from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
With 90% of businesses in Fife falling into the SME category, having an
effective network of SME centres is clearly crucial to the region's
economic fortunes.
Ann Justice outlines the special function of the college's own centre
when she says: ''As our responsibility is to train students in the
relevant skills, it is essential that we are always monitoring the needs
of SMEs and changing our curriculum accordingly. We have to make sure
that we provide whatever learning support SMEs need.''
As well as paying for the computer hardware, the Telematics funding,
including #40,000 from ERDF, has allowed the centre to build up a bank
of software applications to match the training requirements of the
companies.
These were carefully compiled at the outset and a reflection of the
diverse range of firms in terms of size, location and previous IT
experience. Such a choice was in line with the broad aims of the
research project to measure and compare the success of training plans
over as wide a spectrum as possible.
Pam McAlester, the National Federation of Small Businesses chairman,
says: ''The federation is very impressed with the way Fife College has
set about this initiative because it has sought advice directly from
SMEs. Our experience is that many training providers are quite happy to
assume that they know the needs of SMEs without carrying out the proper
research.''
Ann Justice singles out owner-managed firms with irregular hours, such
as hotels, as ones which have most to gain. In their case, the
accessibility of the training rids them of the problem of finding time
to attend external classes.
Because the project has attracted such a high number of applicants,
the sample is as representative as could be hoped. The initial stages of
the 18-month project have now been completed, with the computer
equipment in place and the introductory training of the users completed.
The tutors, who are subject specialists drawn from the teaching staff,
are all volunteers and have themselves undergone a training course. They
will be available for advice at specified times during the day. In
addition, technical support will be on hand throughout the day.
Although Telematics remains a research project, all the signs from the
interest so far point to it being a trendsetter.

'I had to find #750 or be denied my degree' -- Fraser Nelson (below)
tells a cautionary tale of the university fees that vanished
NOTHING strikes more fear into the hearts of students than the arrival
of a university-crested envelope. Four days before the results of my
finals were due, it was not a time for things to go wrong; but they did.
''Dear Mr Nelson: We regret to inform you that the Student Awards
Agency for Scotland has not paid your university fees. You are,
therefore, personally liable for the arts faculty fee of #750 . . . Your
results will not be published, nor will you be allowed to graduate or
matriculate until the matter has been resolved. Yours sincerely . . .''
Coming at the end of my four-year arts degree at Glasgow University,
the news that I hadn't matriculated was a shock. I phoned the
university, which confirmed that my fees for fourth year remained
outstanding. It suggested that I hadn't posted my application to the
Scottish Office's awards agency. But I had applied in the same way as
the previous three years. ''Well, that is a matter between you and the
Scottish Office,'' the authorities replied. ''Perhaps you should try
there.''
The SAAS said it had not heard of me. Despite its having provided me
with course fees for the previous three years, I was no longer on its
lists, which meant -- no money. I spoke to an official who told me:
''Our deadline is January 31. We don't issue awards after that date. If
we have no record of your award you can only submit a late application.
But I must tell you your chances of succeeding are less than 5%.''
I pointed out that I had applied in good time. I distinctly recall
posting the application through a postbox in the west end of Glasgow in
September last year. It struck me that if I had owed the university #750
-- the tuition fee band for arts subjects -- since October 1994, I
should have been told before June '95.
The university's student welfare adviser, Joan Kean, told me: ''You
have fallen between two stools of incompetence. It is standard procedure
for any creditor to issue reminders, and well before nine months. They
can't just drop you a note four days before your results come out.''
According to the university regulations, I should not have been
allowed to study after October last year if my fees had not been paid.
But I had sat eight finals without a whisper. Did we have a case, then?
No, said the university's assistant registrar Christine Lothar. She
explained that the university organised a reminder service which could
not be expected to be 100% effective for all 15,000 students. The
service is not a duty, I was told; it is a courtesy.
At the beginning of the academic year in October there are thousands
of students with fees still outstanding. Their names are entered on to a
''debtors' list'' which is activated after November, by which time most
fees have been paid. But the alarm bells did not ring for me because my
details were not put on the original debtors' list, although they should
have been.
Christine Lothar suspects human error in the data processing at the
university. ''When there are thousands of entries mistakes can be
made,'' she said. From then on in I just kept slipping through the net,
until the academic year ended in June, when my name appeared in the
registrar's office with several others whose fees had not been paid.
But this was five months after the SAAS's deadline. At the SAAS, the
absence of my application for funding my final year of study also rang
no alarm bells. The agency is in the business of considering processed
applications and rejecting late ones. There is no procedure for missing
applications like mine, or for alerting or reminding those whose fees
have not been paid. I had simply fallen foul of the system.
The only safeguard would have been if I had noticed the absence of the
receipt slip which the SAAS sends out after it receives an application
for an award. Given that I had received payment for the previous three
years of my course, I was not on the look-out for the receipt. To be
honest, I hadn't noticed it in my second and third years.
The upshot was that I had to find #750 or be denied my degree. Without
a degree, I would lose the much-coveted place on a post-graduate
journalism course in London which I had been offered, and would face
unemployment. I was advised to take out a loan to pay the #750 but my
parents were against this option because they are deeply opposed to
debt.
George Galloway, my local MP in Glasgow, Rachel Squire, his Labour
colleague who represents the constituency in which my parents live, and
the Students' Representative Council all appealed on my behalf, but to
no avail. I also made a late application for the award but, given what I
had been told, it came as no surprise to me when I was rejected.
In the end, my parents lent me the money, which I shall pay back. I
graduated with an upper second class honours degree in July.
Rachel Squire has discovered that fewer than 50 late applications had
been made this year. To the Scottish Office, this represents a mere
0.004% of cases, but it amounts to 100% failure for the students
involved. The SAAS says its procedures are ''established and accepted''.
These remarks were passed on to me by Rachel Squire. A standard
rejection letter was posted to me two months after appealing.

Dr Marigold Curling's daughter was murdered four years ago trying to
help war-stricken Kurds in Iraq. Carol Clewlow speaks to the pathologist
on her campaign to build a hospital and continue the work her daughter
started
THE air of pain surrounds Dr Marigold Curling. It is almost palpable.
To interview her is to feel yourself prodding clumsily with a rough
stick into the soft tissue of human sadness. As it happens, it's a good
analogy. Dr Curling is a pathologist of 25 years standing. Her long
career at London's St Bartholomew's Hospital is not, regrettably, the
reason people interview her now.
Dr Curling's 15 minutes of fame has come late in life and through
mind-numbingly tragic circumstances.
Her daughter Rosanna and journalist son-in-law Nicholas della Casa
became newspaper headlines when they were murdered along with a
colleague, Charles Maxwell, four years ago in Northern Iraq.
They were there to make a BBC documentary on the plight of the Kurdish
people, thousands of whom had been killed by Saddam Hussein in a final
solution which included the wholesale destruction of villages whose
inhabitants, in the main women and children, he gassed.
Rosanna, a history graduate of Edinburgh University was a wide and
adventurous traveller. However, she was living the relatively
comfortable existence of a London PR officer when she gave it all up to
accompany Nicholas to the remote and moutainous region on the borders of
Turkey, Iran, and Iraq to which surviving Kurds had fled.
Both had become passionately concerned about the fate of the Kurds
since 1988 when the first news of the gassings began to leak out. It was
a concern which grew when Nicholas, who had won awards for his work in
South Africa, went out to the Gulf two years later to cover the war.
In his book on the Gulf War which he dedicated to the three, the BBC's
John Simpson who worked with Nicholas writes: ''They were conscious of
the need to do some good for people not simply to capture their stories
on camera . . . to tell the world about the suffering of people like the
Kurds was more important to the three of them than the possible dangers
. . .''
But dangers there were. The last postcard Dr Curling received from
Rosanna was from South-east Turkey. Two months later Nicholas' and
Charles' bodies were found in the mountains to which they had been
heading. Investigations revealed they had been killed by their guide. He
was later caught and tried and sent to prison.
By a bitter irony their killer turned out to be a Turkish Kurd. Bitter
irony though is a dangerous thing. Viewed through it, a situation can
become hopeless, threaten to collapse into darkness or despair. It might
do so in this case were it not for the large ray of hope which is the
Rosanna Hospital.
The facts of the case are encouragingly simple. Dr Curling has now
given over a large slab of her life to a campaign to raise #300,000 to
build, staff and run a hospital in the region where her daughter died.
Her reasons for launching the campaign were equally straightforward.
''I'm not a journalist,'' she says. ''But I felt I wanted in some way
to continue the work that Nicholas and Rosanna had started.''
She was also moved by the kindness with which she and her husband
David were treated by the Kurds in the early days when the fate of the
three was not known, and they went out in search of them. The last
reason was the dreadful conditions of the refugees of Sadam Hussein's
wrath which she saw around her.
The area where the three disappeared is now part of the fledgling
state of Kurdistan. Some four million Kurdish people live there under
Allied protection, many under Red Cross canvas.
The site, at a place called Kanamarsi, was selected by Kurdish leaders
as an area of special need, which given the surroundings gives some idea
of the conditions. On the site of a hospital blown up by one of Saddam
Hussein's bombs, its 30,000 inhabitants currently depend on the services
of one doctor.
Run-of-the-mill ailments associated with a life of hunger and cold and
advanced deprivation are compounded by injuries from landminesmore often
than not under the legs of young children.
''The injuries are appalling...'' says Dr Curling, adding with a
doctor's horror. ''There is no blood for transfusions . . . no suture
material . . . no swabs . . .''
For in another of those ironies that abound in such situations, the
sanctions designed to bring the dictator to his knees are also
preventing his victims rising from theirs.
The UN embargo means that the Kurds too have no economy, no building
materials, and therefore no way of obtaining the means to build or equip
a hospital. What they are not short of however, as Dr Curling stresses,
is well-trained doctors and nurses available to staff the new 12-bed
hospital.
In the year or so that the appeal has been going, an astonishing
#200,000 has been raised, mainly by family and friends using every
available means from sponsored absails to dinner parties. The composer
John Tavener will this evening premiere a new work fittingly titled
Innocence, which is dedicated to the innocent victims of war, in a
concert at Westminster Abbey.
But Dr Curling says more is needed.still colleagues have still offered
help in any way they can.
It is now four years since Dr Curling suffered the loss of her
daughter and son-in-law. Her load has not been lightened by the death of
her husband David last year.
She still works full time at St Bart's despite in her own words
working ''flat out'' as well on the appeal. If she has the air of a
woman driven and weary with it, it is scarcely surprising. The task to
establish the hospital is a difficult and delicate one, involving an
area of the world which could not be more politically sensitive.
In a fundraising letter she says that, when built, it will honour her
daughter's memory and that of Nicholas and Charles. ''It will serve as a
reminder,'' she writes, ''as to why they were there.''
While she will talk as much as required about the plans for that
hospital, she quietly and with great dignity refuses to be drawn on any
personal feelings about the sorrowful circumstances surrounding it.
Asked if continuing Roseanna and Nicholas's work in this way helps
with the pain, she answeres briskly.
''Not at all,'' she says. ''But it gives me something to do.''

SHAKEN by the #95m cost of settling its legal dispute with the US
Government over defence contracts, Lucas is considering quitting the
aerospace business altogether.
While the automotive side goes from strength to strength, aerospace is
now down to 17% of sales and its operating profits fell 35% to #19.7m
before exceptionals in the year to July.
Group pre-tax profits jumped 61% to #136m on the back of higher
automotive production, improved productivity and a further strengthening
of automotive margins. Dividends are held at 7p.
Lucas is hoping to bring in a partner for its US aerospace interests,
which are now free to bid again for contracts from the US Department of
Defense. Failing this, sale or closure are possible options and the
group has made a full provision against the business so it can draw a
line behind it.
There remain useful aerospace activities and new management is
concentrating on making sure the division is ready to take advantage of
an upturn in demand which is expected from 1997. The present managing
director of aerospace, Frank Turner, is leaving after three years in the
job.
It is the world-class braking systems, diesel injection and vehicle
electronics activities which are the core of the automotive division
that the group's real interest lies. In the past year braking systems
sales rose by a fifth mainly as a result of market share gains. New
contract gains included brake assistance technology for Mercedes
vehicles.
There was pressure on prices but margins improved as a result of cost
cutting moves. Restructuring of the manufacturing facilities is well
underway which will help margins further. Braking systems in the US
moved into profit and there was an increasing contribution from
associates, particularly in the India and Brazil.
Diesel systems had sales up 16%, which outstripped the growth in the
European market. Sales were constrained by capacity limitations but
margins improved despite higher spending on new technology. The big
contract win was a #1000m agreement to supply injectors to Volkswagen.
Lucas is seeking to expand the business globally and it has invested
in Mexico and Brazil. Capital spending generally was raised 50% to
#152m, including higher development expenditure.
Electronic systems inaugurated new plants in the US, England and India
as the group continued to build up this activity, whose sales were up
18%. Rationalisation spurred market share and margin gains in vehicle
aftermarket results despite pricing pressure from original equipment
makers.
Lucas chief executive George Simpson said the group's recent problems
were now in the past and it was now more focused on developing the
continuing activities. However, demand in the automotive sector is
flattening out so that slower market growth is expected over the next
couple of years.
Up 4p at 208p, Lucas shares look up with events, selling at almost 22
times earnings.

MARGARET Vaughan is clearly a victim of the dreaded condition
Scargillophobia, which for more than a decade has afflicted big swathes
of Britain's middle and upper classes.
In her character assassination she portrays the leader of the NUM as
an industrial dinosaur, a buffoon whose tactics brought about the
destruction of the mining industry, a deceitful egotist who sacrificed
miners and their families for the sake of his grandiose personal
ambitions (October 4).
The miners' strike of 1984 was no lightminded adventure dreamed up by
Arthur Scargill. It was a life-or-death struggle for survival which
began in local pit villages in Scotland and Yorkshire. It was backed by
tens of millions throughout Britain and across Europe.
The Tory Government spent #10bn to defeat the strike, 10 times more
than New Labour intends to spend on building a New Britain. Social
Security laws were rewritten; new trade-union laws introduced; and
Britain's secret intelligence agencies were deployed in a disgraceful
''dirty war'' against the NUM, the details of which are only now coming
to light.
Despite this, the NUM, representing just 1% of Britain's trade
unionists in 1984, fought the Government virtually to a standstill. Even
Lord Tebbit has since confessed that the strike was ''a close-run
thing.''
The fact that the NUM was defeated in 1985 does not mean that it was
wrong to fight.
Unlike his more ''responsible'' colleagues in other trade unions,
Arthur Scargill will never be recommended for a life peerage or for a
bauble in the New Year's honours lists. But, along with 150,000 miners
and their families, Scargill, Heathfield, and McGahey will always be
able to hold their heads high and say: ''During the dark days of
Thatcherism at least we offered resistance''.
Margaret Vaughan's attempted hatchet job is headlined, ''Swansong of a
leader who has lost everything''. Scargill has not lost everything: for
a start he has never lost his principles. But for a smug, suburban New
Labour, to which Margaret Vaughan appears to subscribe, Principles are
only a shop which sells designer clothes.

INFLATIONARY worries, which have been rather sidelined lately with the
publication of data showing economic growth slowing, resurfaced a little
yesterday with the producer prices data for September. It showed that
the price of goods leaving the factory gate rose by 0.2%, taking the
year-on-year increase from 4.4% to 4.5% after upward revisions to
previous months' data.
More important, the core rate of increase -- excluding food, drinks,
tobacco and petroleum -- was up 0.3% over the month following a similar
rise in August, lifting the annual rate from 5% to 5.1%, above market
projections. And while the Treasury said the core rate remained subdued,
some analysts see it as an indication that inflation could still pose a
threat.
Input prices -- the cost of raw materials to manufacturing -- also
rose, increasing by 0.9% in September compared with 0.5% in August, with
the year-on-year figure rising 9.5% against 9.2% in the 12 months to
August, again above market estimates.
The figures were regarded as disappointing and following on from
Friday's factory output figures for August, showing an increase of 0.6%
in manufacturing production after July's 0.2% decline, revised from an
initial 0.4% fall, could mean the Bank of England's earlier contention
that a rise in interest rates may be necessary at some stage is
restated.
The CBI, though, has suggested on the basis of its latest surveys that
the next move in interest rates is more likely to be down, but only if
it can be sustained.
Ordinarily, any sign that the economic slowdown was not as pronounced
as had been feared would be considered encouraging and, indeed, this was
how the production figures were described by the Treasury.
Unfortunately, they can also heighten inflation fears in financial
markets if taken in conjunction with any signal, however muted, that
there is still a potential inflation threat -- and this could be the
interpretation placed on the latest producer prices.
However, economic data often tends to send conflicting messages and
producer prices contrast with the more favourable Purchasing Managers'
survey for September and also with the CBI surveys. Industry is still
finding it very difficult in the present highly competitive climate to
pass on rises in raw material costs, and retail prices are likely to
continue to come up against customer resistance.
The evidence on the economy is still accumulating -- the RPI for
September is due on Thursday and the CBI Distributive Trades Survey on
Friday -- and there seems no reason to think the Chancellor feels any
need for an interest rate move until the Budget on November 28, if then.
Indeed, James Capel's Adam Cole believes that in spite of the input
price increase, which was substantially above expectations, the figures
do not pose a threat to the chances of a base rate cut in the coming
months.

MARGARET Vaughan's diatribe against Arthur Scargill reminded me that,
despite the efforts of the media over the years to portray him as a
liar, he has been proven correct time and again (October 4).
Had the Labour movement stood by the miners' union perhaps we would be
in a stronger position today.
In contrast to the empty rhetoric of so many of the speeches at
Brighton, Arthur Scargill's speech was one of devastating clarity.
Margaret Vaughan's article describes ''muted clapping as he walked to
the rostrum''. In fact the speech was met with warm applause.
There are many people inside the Labour Party who do not agree with
Blair's New Labour and to their shame they are silent as they seek power
in government at any price.
They may reach office but power is a different matter, and that is
where the importance of Arthur Scargill's contribution is so relevant.
The flame of socialism is being kept alive by people like Scargill,
Skinner, Benn, and others in the Labour Party and in other parties.
There is nothing new in New Labour. It is ''old'' Labour at its worst
with the political heirs of Jenkins, Williams, et al in charge. We know
their policies have continually failed, so we will have to try real
socialist policies sooner or later.

RUGBY LEAGUE WORLD CUP
Wales 28, France 6
WALES launched their World Cup bid last night with a five-star
performance at an ecstatic Ninian Park in Cardiff.
Clive Griffiths' Dragons completely outplayed the French, and a
victory against Western Samoa in Swansea next Sunday will guarantee a
semi-final place -- probably against England -- at Old Trafford.
However, the Welsh had an injury scare to skipper Jonathan Davies, who
left the field in 57 minutes and was taken to hospital with mild
concussion.
St Helens flier Anthony Sullivan led the scoring with a magnificent
hat trick of tries, but even that was not enough to give him the
man-of-the-match award. That went to Warrington's teenage full back
Iestyn Harris, who crowned a dazzling display with a superb 45-yard solo
try which finally killed off the French. John Devereux's try 11 minutes
from time rounded off a great night for Welsh rugby league.
Scrum-half Kevin Ellis was another star performer and to add to the
delight of the Welsh, who were gaining their fourth success against
France in three years, the crowd of 10,250 was the biggest since the
national side was revived in 1991.
Several players had been the subject of speculation over moves to
rugby union during the past few weeks, but all that was forgotten on a
night of pride, passion, and great rugby.
* A SCHEME to build a new 100,000-seater home for Welsh rugby union on
the outskirts of Bridgend has been drawn up by the new local authority
in the mid-Glamorgan town.
The WRU's plans to host the 1999 World Cup final at a new, covered
80,000-seater stadium on the Arms Park site were dealt a blow when the
Millennium Commission turned down their request for #50m.

ROY Jones wants to rendezvous with Nigel Benn in a bid to map out a
route to a big-money unification fight for the IBF and WBC
super-middleweight titles.
The two best 12st fighters are not on a collision course yet, because
of their different cable-network contracts. Jones is tied up with Home
Box Office while WBC champion Benn is committed to the rival Showtime
operation through his Don King connection.
But Jones believes a private meeting between the boxers, away from
promoters, might bypass the politics. They could even meet face-to-face
in America, as Benn lives for most of the time in Los Angeles.
''I'll go see him,'' said Jones, widely rated the world's best
pound-for-pound boxer -- even Benn ranks himself No.2 to the
super-stylist from Florida.
Jones said of the prospective fight: ''It certainly wouldn't go 12
rounds, it would be a great battle. I wouldn't care where the fight took
place. In London we'd get a pretty fair shake.
''There's also WBO champion Steve Collins and Britain's Henry Wharton
as well. But I like the biggest challenges. A Benn fight would be like
heaven on earth. He's a great person and a great champion.''
Meanwhile, Irishman Collins seems to have found a challenger next
month for the WBO super-middleweight title he won from Chris Eubank last
March and successfully defended against him a month ago. Collins looks
set to meet Middlesbrough's Cornelius Carr in Dublin on November 25,
although promoter Frank Warren also has pencilled in Ulsterman Ray Close
and France's former European champion, Frederic Seillier.
Collins ultimately wants unification fights with Benn or Jones. But
the first Dublin-born fighter to win a world title -- and the first
Irishman to reign as champion in two divisions, having previously held
the WBO middleweight championship -- will realise another ambition when
he defends a world title in his home city.
Carr, 26, won and then relinquished the British title and has lost
only once in 27 fights.
* RICHIE Wenton failed in his bid to become the European
super-bantamweight champion when he was outpointed by Italian
title-holder Vincenzo Belcastro last night.
The 27-year-old Liverpool-born Wenton looked to be taming ''The Lion''
in his own backyard of San Benedetto del Tronto. But the 34-year-old
veteran of 42 fights, including three unsuccessful world-title bids,
dominated from the seventh round onwards to take a unanimous decision.

Los Angeles
A JUROR in the O J Simpson trial kept a journal throughout the hearing
and is trying to sell the material for a book or film, his lawyer said.
''We are entertaining offers in that area. He has an interest in
telling his story,'' said Gary Brown, who is representing David Aldana,
an East Los Angeles lorry driver.
Brown declined to reveal the contents of the journal, but said he was
certain Aldana did not violate Superior Court Judge Lance Ito's
admonition ordering jurors not to form any opinions about the case until
deliberations.
''He did follow the rules and instructions,'' Brown said.
Meanwhile, Simpson's model girlfriend, Paula Barbieri, is claimed to
be at home in Florida rather than flying off to marry him in the
Dominican Republic, contradicting reports in a newspaper in that
country.
Barbieri has been in her home in Panama City, Florida with her mother,
said sources.
Simpson lawyer Carl Douglas also denied the report in Listin Diario,
the paper that accurately reported the wedding of Michael Jackson and
Lisa Marie Presley.
''That's totally false,'' said Douglas, adding that Simpson spent the
weekend at home.
The Listin Diario reports triggered a stampede of reporters and
television crews who flew to the Dominican resort of Casa de Campo in
search of the alleged bridegroom, but Simpson was nowhere to be seen.
A jury last week acquitted Simpson, 48, in the murders of his ex-wife
Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.
Aldana, known only as Juror No 4 until the trial ended, is the first
juror who remained on the panel until the end who is known to have kept
a journal, a precarious practice that could open him up to a juror
misconduct inquiry.
However his lawyer said the journal would help to dispel
misconceptions about the Simpson jury. For instance, it would show that
the verdicts, reached after less than four hours of deliberations, were
not reached without considering the evidence and were not the by-product
of racial feelings, Brown said. -- Reuter

Mexico City
A POWERFUL earthquake shook Mexico's Pacific coast today, toppling a
seven-story hotel in a southern resort, cracking homes and bridges, and
killing at least 61 people.
More than 100 people were reported injured. Forty-four were killed in
coastal communities in the Pacific state of Jalisco. Thirty of them were
killed in Cihuatlan, 11 in Melaque, and three in La Huerta. Fifteen
others were reported killed in the neighboring state of Colima.
The quake, measuring 7.6 on the Richter scale, was felt as far north
as Dallas and Oklahoma City, according to seismologists. It was the
second powerful tremor to hit Mexico in a month.
It struck at 9.37am and was centered three miles off the Pacific Coast
between Colima and Jalisco states. The tremor lasted about two minutes
and was followed by two small aftershocks.
Rescuers with bulldozers and cranes pulled 12 bodies and 10 injured
people from the Costa Real hotel in the port and resort area of
Manzanillo. Authorities feared the toll would rise.
''The rescue is going to be difficult,'' said Admiral Manuel Barron.
''Sounds have been heard. We think there are more people in the
rubble.''
At least 30 guests were registered at the hotel and 27 employees were
working there. It was not clear how many were in the building when the
quake hit.
Manzanillo textile shop owner Livas de la Garza said the injured were
being treated in makeshift outdoor clinics. He said he saw extensive
damage.
''You can see houses destroyed. The injured are everywhere,'' he said.
The quake cut telephone service and electricity to many areas,
including the resort itself, and authorities canceled flights to
Manzanillo because of damage to the runway.
A state of emergency was declared in the state of Jalisco, where homes
and buildings crumbled. President Ernesto Zedillo sent five cabinet
members to assess the damage and co-ordinate an emergency plan by the
military.
Jalisco state spokeswoman Claudio Villalobos said six people were dead
and at least 80 injured in the two small towns of Tenamaxtlan and Ameca,
north-west of Manzanillo.
Mexico City skyscrapers swayed precariously but no damages or injuries
were reported in the capital. Trading on Mexico's stock market halted
for 40 minutes.
Mexico City was hit by a major quake in 1985 which killed at least
6000 people and destroying thousands of buildings.--AP

Madrid
ANGRY victims of Spain's cooking oil scandal which killed more than a
thousand people and affected 25,000 others in 1981 gathered outside the
National Criminal Court in Madrid today for the trial of seven men
accused of allowing the tragedy to happen through negligence.
Five former civil servants and two local councillors face private
prosecutions claiming that their actions allowed a group of ruthless
businessmen to import rapeseed oil meant for industrial use from France,
refine it, and then sell it as cooking oil door-to-door at cut-rate
prices over a wide area of central Spain.
If any of the seven, for whom prosecuting lawyers are demanding prison
sentences of up to seven years, is convicted, the government is expected
to be forced to pay compensation of up to #2500m to the tens of
thousands of victims and their families.
The oil was snapped up by housewives because of its bargain price when
salesmen decended on poor working class districts of Madrid and other
cities and hundreds of small villages. However within weeks people were
struck down in their thousands by what at first was thought to be an
unknown strain of pneumonia. The oil was not found to be the cause until
after months of research.
Associations representing the victims claim that more than 1000 people
eventually died after consuming the oil. Of the 25,000 others affected,
many were left partly paralysed.
In May 1989, eight years after the tragedy, 12 people were convicted
for their parts in the massive fraud. Twenty-five others were acquitted.
The private prosecutions are expected to last until Christmas.

KIRSTY SCOTT investigates the issue of product extortion and finds
that while actual tampering with goods is rare, the UK has the highest
rate of contamination threats
THE deliberate spiking of food and other products has become the stuff
of many an urban legend; the razor in the yoghurt pot, a splash of
caustic soda in the can of soup, the poisoned tonic water. Just this
week, bottles of a well-known fruit drink were being recalled in another
alleged tampering case.
Yet, despite a series of high-profile scares, the crime of actual
contamination is still rare in the UK. Threatening to contaminate
products is not, and it's here that Britain leads the rest of the world.
Product extortion is one step down from contamination and usually
involves straight blackmail -- the threat to spike a certain product
unless money is paid over.
Recent figures compiled by the Control Risks Group in London found
that between 1990 and 1994 the UK accounted for almost half of all cases
of product extortion in Europe with a total of 87 out of 174. Next in
line was Germany with 49, Spain with 11, France with five, and Austria
and Sweden with one each.
It's not entirely clear why the crime is a peculiarly British affair,
but the recession may be somewhat to blame.
''It is a crime of developed countries,'' said Nigel Churton of the
CRG, ''and what we have found particularly in extortion cases is that it
generally comes right down to lack of money, normally the people are
fairly desperate.
''In recent times there are people in small businesses which have
collapsed, people who have got other monetary troubles, and they have
tried to get out of the problem through what looks like a fairly simple
crime. They understand what the pressure is if this becomes public
knowledge, your market share will suffer, therefore, they think it will
be easier for you to pay some money.''
All types of goods are targeted for product extortion but foodstuffs
are the favourite. They accounted for 139 of the 174 cases in Europe. In
16 cases drink was involved and in eight cases toiletries and other
pharmaceuticals were targeted.
Scotland has had several such cases. In September 1989 an extorter who
became known as the Bogeyman was jailed for five years after threatening
to contaminate supermarket products with the Aids virus and lace
Smarties with drugs. The same year another Scot was also jailed for five
years after trying to extort #140,000 from Marks and Spencer with a
threat to contaminate products throughout the UK.
While the clear temptation may be for firms to pay up and avoid
publicity, Churton says they don't because public safety is paramount.
''In most cases they will work with the police for an entrapment
operation. No company can be publicly defensible unless it ensures it
looks after the interests of the consumer at all times.''
The situation can put staff under enormous pressure. ''It puts a great
strain on people. They get very, very wound up about this crime,'' said
Churton. ''I have seen very senior executives going to pieces over this.
You're talking about a brand they have developed, and which may be the
market leader. It's just been their life's work and they're thinking
it's going to be destroyed in front of their eyes.''
Firms are reluctant to speak about the issue. A spokeswoman for
Safeway in London said they would never comment about the crime or
generally about precautions they might take to ensure consumer safety.
''I doubt very much if you will get any store to talk to you about
this,'' she said.
Product extortion may seem a simple crime, but it is rarely
successful. Of the 174 cases in Europe, 72 ended in arrests and 39
fizzled out when the blackmailer stopped making demands. The conclusion
of the remainder was not known.
''A lot of them fade away without an ending,'' said Churton. Few
blackmailers will take the extra step to actually tamper with the
products they have threatened.
''It's very rare,'' said Churton. ''These people generally want money.
They're not murderers who are going to put a lethal dose of something in
a product.''
What some are doing, however, is coming up with increasingly
unpleasant threats. ''The big emotive one at the moment is threatening
to put Aids-infected blood into things'' said Churton.
The concept of consumer terrorism first surfaced in 1982 when seven
people died in America after taking the pain relief tablets Tylenol
which had been spiked and put back on supermarket shelves. Four years
later in 1986 the Food and Drug Administration declared food tampering
to be a ''terrorist criminal act'' and urged companies to treat hoax
cases on a par with bomb threats. The same year the number of threats to
contaminate food rose fivefold in the UK.
There were 25 cases of actual product tampering in the UK last year,
but the US still leads the way when it comes to deliberate contamination
of products.
In Europe during the past four years there have been 198 cases of
contamination, at least 65 of them done intentionally and 85 done
accidentally. Britain accounted for 140 cases.
The term consumer terrorism is a little misleading. Of the 198 cases
of contamination only one could be attributed to a terrorist
organisation. Disgruntled employees accounted for eight cases, criminals
for seven, and extremists for 20.
While stores are reluctant to talk about how they are prepared to
combat extortion or tampering, it's understood that security at many
Scottish food stores has been stepped up following the tonic water
poisoning case.
Detective Superintendent Kevin Orr of Strathclyde Police Drugs Squad
said there was close co-operation between the police and retailers and a
series of sophisticated measures were in force to tackle the problem.
There are frequent seminars outlining the scale of the problem and how
it has been dealt with.
''The crime is mercifully rare but we can't be complacent and we have
action plans,'' he said. ''Retailers are very aware of the problem and
have plans in place.''
DS Orr, who acts as resource co-ordinator for the crime, said most
incidents occurred in England, but they kept in close touch with other
police forces to keep abreast of developments, people involved and new
strategies for addressing the problem. ''The key word here is
teamwork.''
Nigel Churton, who works with firms which have been targeted by
extortion or contamination, urges them to stay calm and rational and to
remember that the crime is rarely succesful.
''How many get away with it? Not a huge amount at all.''

A LEADING company yesterday dealt a fresh eve-of-conference blow to
the Government by slashing its donation to the Conservative Party.
Sugar giant Tate &amp; Lyle is to cut its donation from #25,000 to #15,000
and will give money to the Labour Party for the first time.
The board is to give Labour #7500 and make a donation of #2500 for the
second year running to the Liberal Democrats.
Chairman Sir Neil Shaw has written to the three parties explaining the
company's decision.
Tate &amp; Lyle, which has around half the UK sugar market, has
traditionally supported the Conservatives and made its biggest donation
of #50,000 in the election year of 1992.
But Mr Tony Blair's modernisation of Labour and the party's axing of
its Clause Four commitment to public ownership were factors in the
board's decision, said a spokesman.
The company has a turnover of #4000m a year and employs 17,000 workers
across the world, including 2500 in the UK.
A Conservative Party spokesman said that it was standard policy not to
discuss individual company donations.
''In the annual report published in August donations had gone up by
35% year on year, but inevitably from time to time people change the
nature of their donations,'' he added.
Tate &amp; Lyle championed the Conservative Party's anti-nationalisation
campaign in 1949 by launching its own initiative to keep the sugar
industry in private hands.
President of Tate &amp; Lyle, Lord Lyle, launched a campaign against the
nationalisation plans of the then Labour Government using the cartoon
figure Mr Cube to get the company's ''Tate not State -- Hands off
Sugar'' message into millions of homes in Britain.
Legal action was threatened by the Labour Government over what some
Cabinet members saw as ''political propaganda'' but it was Tate &amp; Lyle
which eventually won in court: the Mr Cube campaign was ruled to be not
political for tax purposes.
Tate &amp; Lyle stayed in private hands and the board continued its
strident opposition to nationalisation through the 1950s.
Lord Lyle was a Conservative MP three times between 1918 and 1945 and
in 1924 he stood down as MP for Epping to make way for Winston
Churchill.
The company's decision was welcomed by the Labour Party.
''It shows the general direction that British politics is moving that
in every quarter new Labour is becoming more popular and more
interesting,'' a party spokesman said.
* Traditional close ties between the Government and business are
''coming apart at the seams'', a managers' organisation claimed
yesterday.
The charge followed a survey showing that fewer than one in five
managers believed the Government was in touch with the needs of
business.
Three out of five managers questioned by the Institute of Management
said they opposed the key Government policy of privatising British Rail,
including 53% of company directors.
A majority of the 370 managers polled supported closer economic union
with the EC.

PATH TO POWER
THEY called them the Blackpool Follies of 1963, that time beside the
seaside in October when the Conservative Party turned private disunity
into public conflict.
The Golden Mile, while it did not actually run with blood, certainly
saw some peculiar goings-on as the rivals to succeed Mr Harold Macmillan
tried to show their fitness for the job. Some of the goings-on were
extreme, even by Blackpool standards, and Lord Hailsham in particular
reminded the representatives of his behaviour at the Brighton conference
in 1957 when he rang that blessed bell.
It was used by the conference chairman and on the final day was
presented to whoever held the job. Lord Hailsham made the presentation,
then rang it gently, before ringing it loudly and announcing that it
tolled for the defeat of the Labour Party. .
It had been a bad year for Prime Minister Harold Macmillan. His
Supermac image had been destroyed by, among other things, the Profumo
affair. He was tired, his health was poor, he wanted out after six years
in the job.
However, he did not want to be succeeded by Mr R A Butler, the man he
had defeated, with the connivance of the legendary magic circle in 1957,
when Sir Anthony Eden resigned after the Suez debacle. That was how he
felt all summer. Then things changed. He started to feel better and
decided he wanted to stay until the next election, telling Lord Home as
much when they had dinner at Chequers in September.
The trouble was that Rab Butler, by any standards other than those
applied by Mr Macmillan, was the best man for the job. Two possible
rivals, Lords Hailsham and Home, seemed out of the race because they
were in the House of Lords, although they could, under the new rules,
renounce their peerages.
Mr Macmillan decided that he would stand down by the next election and
had set in motion a look at how a successor could be chosen. Then, in
late September, his mind was made up for him.
Sunday, October 6: Lord Home again dined at Chequers. Mr Macmillan
seemed in good spirits.
October 7: Mr Macmillan summoned Lord Hailsham to Downing Street and
told him he wished him to be his successor and that he intended to
resign by Christmas.
October 8: Pale and drawn, he presided over the Cabinet but gave no
hint of his plans.After he had left the room, the colleagues started to
speculate about how a successor would be found, should he resign, and
were told by the Lord Chancellor, Lord Dilhorne that, under the
arrangements made in September, his task would be to sound Ministers
out. As he was not a candidate, he would be available to give any advice
colleagues might wish. Lord Home said he was in the same position and
would help in any way required.
That evening, Mr Macmillan told the Chief Whip to get the consultative
process under way. The country was told that Mr Macmillan would not be
going to Blackpool, would be absent for some weeks convalescence, and Mr
Butler, the deputy Prime Minister, would be in charge of the Government.
October 9: Mr Macmillan summoned Lord Home to the King Edward VII
Hospital for Officers in London and told him of his intention to resign.
Mr Macmillan said he considered Lord Home a possible successor. Lord
Hailsham had a speech in Morecambe but resisted announcing his intention
to disclaim the peerage as he felt it would be jumping the gun.
October 10: Mr Maurice Macmillan and Mr Julian Amery, Macmillan's
son-in-law, arrived from the sickbed to tell Lord Hailsham he must act
at once. Lord Home arrived that afternoon and read out the message to an
astounded conference, by which time the Hailsham bandwagon, led by Mr
Amery and Mr Maurice Macmillan, had started to roll.
Lord Hailsham also started to put himself about and announced after
his lecture that evening to the Conservative Political Centre that he
would disclaim his peerage and hoped to stand for Parliament. Mr Butler,
told in advance, was not pleased by the decision.
Nevertheless, the naked electioneering of the Hailsham campaign was
alien to the Tory way, which had always been to allow the magic circle
to work its spells and for a victor to emerge. Lord Hailsham was whisked
away to the Young Tories' ball and more scenes of hysteria followed.
Both Mr Butler and Mr Reginald Maudling announced they would stand but
Mr Butler failed to seize the tide of the times.
October 11: The possibility of Lord Home being chosen started to be
bruited through the conference halls, which were a hotbed of gossip,
both informed and totally unfounded. Lord Home, still on the sidelines,
opened his speech in the foreign affairs debate with the words: ''I am
offering a prize to any newspaperman who can find a clue in this speech
that this is Lord Home's bid for the leadership''.
The speech proved the success of the conference, and Lord Home
received a stream of visitors urging him to bite the bullet. They did
not want Mr Butler. Lord Home refused, but agreed, if the party got
''into a terrible jam,'' to consult his doctor to see if he was up to
the job.
October 12: Lord Home, as president of the National Union, was
conference chairman, and thus introduced Mr Butler's keynote speech, in
which he presented his view of modern Conservatism and British society,
his platform for the premiership. Lord Home, who was giving the
impression of being above the sordid fray, was received with infinitely
greater enthusiasm than the deputy Prime Minister.
The conference over, Lord Home returned to London that night aware
that Lord Hailsham's unashamed antics had lost him his support and that
the only other serious contender was Mr Butler. Lord Home had his
medical.
October 14: Lord Home's name was floated in The Times as the choice of
perfection, the man the party organisers wanted who would keep it
together and Lord Dilhorne, playing the kingmaker role, saw both Lord
Home and Mr Butler. Lord Hailsham by now was effectively out of the
running.
October 15: The Cabinet approved the sounding process proposed by Mr
Macmillan, and Lord Hailsham, Mr Butler, and Mr Maudling visited him in
hospital. Lord Hailsham wrote later that Mr Macmillan had said nothing
to him of the slightest importance and made no mention of their meeting
in Downing Street.
October 17: Mr Macmillan received the results of the soundings, Lord
Home was told that evening that he was in the lead, which may or may not
have been true, because only Mr Macmillan saw them. Lord Hailsham told
him he would not serve in his administration, Mr Iain Macleod and Mr
Enoch Powell told the Chief Whip they would not serve in a Home
administration and neither, they implied, would Mr Maudling.
October 18: Mr Macmillan resigned, told Lord Home to get on with it,
and advised the Queen to send for him. At 12.15, Lord Home was invited
by the Queen to form a government.
Mr Butler agreed to serve as Foreign Secretary, and Selwyn Lloyd
became Leader of the Commons. Five days later, Lord Hailsham, who
insisted he must keep his pledge to renounce his peerage, the only
honourable course in the circumstances, was appointed Education
Secretary. Only Mr Macleod, the party chairman, and Mr Powell stood firm
about not serving under Home.
October 19: Lord Home went to the Palace to kiss hands. The most
frenzied fortnight in British political history was over.

Peshawar
TWO Irishmen convicted of drug smuggling by an Islamic court in
Pakistan received five lashes each and were then released, officials
said.
It was believed to be the first time that non-Muslim foreigners have
been punished under Islamic ordinances passed by former military ruler
General Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq in 1979.
Prison officers in the north-western city of Peshawar said Brian
O'Loughlin and Oliver Byrne were flogged yesterday before they were
freed.
''Since they were foreigners, we were very lenient with them. It was
just a formality that we completed. There were no visible signs of pain
on their faces,'' said Ajmal Khan, assistant jail superintendent.
The Irishmen were sentenced in August to flogging and 10 months' hard
labour in jail after they pleaded guilty to trying to smuggle 1.5 tonnes
of hashish to western Europe.
They were also fined 20,000 rupees (#423) each, but were given six
months' remission for the time they had already spent in custody. The
jail term was later shortened.
The Irishmen, who were arrested on February 13, are still awaiting
trial by a Customs court for the same offence.--Reuter.

CONSERVATIVE chairman Dr Brian Mawhinney yesterday scrapped the
traditional eve-of-party conference briefing for the media and treated
them instead to a preview of the Tories launching themselves on to the
Information Super Highway.
One merit of this, from his point of view, was that he did not have to
answer further questions about the defection of senior Tory MP Alan
Howarth to the Labour Party.
Normally the chairman, flanked by senior party officers, brief the
press on the highlights of the coming week and tells them what a
wonderful conference it is going to be.
The press usually ask about the less wonderful possibilities and
probably Dr Mawhinney felt that Mr Howarth had provided them with too
much ammunition.
He smiled, a little grimly, as the snappers did their work but ''thank
you very much'' and a fast exit was all he offered journalists anxious
to inquire what effect he thought Mr Howarth's conversion might have on
the conference which is supposed to see the governing party get up off
the ground and relaunch itself towards a fifth historic, if, at the
moment, improbably looking election victory.
Sir Basil Feldman, chairman of the National Union, and Mr David Kelly,
the president who will chair most of the conference sessions, stood
shoulder-to-shoulder with Dr Mawhinney, smiling -- which admittedly must
have taken a bit of an effort -- and saying nothing.
Mr Kelly is chairman of a packaging company and his skills in that
direction might be even more use to the party than his expertise with a
gavel.
Dr Mawhinney left the actual launch of the Conservative Party's
contribution to the Internet to experts.
They flashed on to the large platform screen that is to be a feature
of this year's conference, the kind of ''new and exciting'' information
that is now available from them via Demon Internet, operating
appropriately enough from the old Thatcherite heartland of Finchley at
the touch of a PC button, a start-up fee of #12.50, and #10 a month
thereafter -- both plus VAT.
The Conservative offering includes policies, where they might have the
edge on Labour, a guide to party organisation, another to how
Westminster works, all previously available only in things called books
and, for those surfeiting with knowledge, said one expert with a smile,
''a lighter note,'' a Spot the Ball competition. How modern.
The screen can also turn a photo of Tony Blair smiling into one of
Tony Blair in deep depression. This will probably be the first photo of
a party leader depressed at being 30 points ahead of his opponents.
Ministers will use the screen for ''visuals'', to assist those
representatives having trouble with words alone and party sources have
promised a flood of, presumably illustrated, announcements.
Whether the technicians can transform a picture of Mr Howarth looking
conscientious into one of him looking deeply repentant was being kept
secret last night.
Representatives also will have a chance to cheer a new party film
which was also previewed to the media. ''We've come a long, long way,''
it says, sensibly seeking to make a virtue of 16 years in power.
Lowering music introduces a quick look at the tail end of the Labour
government -- strikes, low productivity and various other depressing
statistics shoot across the screen.
Then the music takes on a more positive note as the Tories take over
and things get better and better -- strikes down, inflation down, water
purer, more students at universities, Mrs Thatcher (Falklands) and Mr
Major (Kuwait) fighting for freedom and lots more.
It lacks the emotional pulling power of the famous film of Mr Major's
return to his Brixton roots but it certainly could make many
representatives ponder why their party is 30 points adrift of Labour
after apparently producing a Britain which somewhat resembles the
Britain Mr Blair promised to provide last week.
The organisers have ducked the real theme of the conference in their
platform logo. Instead of ''Our Party's Future,'' they have gone for
''Our Nation's Future'' -- at least it enabled them to avoid the
addition of a question mark.

Stockholm
THREE biologists whose work identified genetic faults that can cause
physical handicaps have won the 1995 Nobel Medicine Prize.
Americans Edward Lewis, 77, and Eric Wieschaus, 48, and German
Christiane Nusslein-Volhard, 52, were chosen for discoveries on the
genetic control of early embryonic development.
The three scientists won the #630,000 prize for discovering how genes
control human development in the womb.
''Together, these three scientists have achieved a breakthrough that
will help explain congenital malformations in man,'' the citation said.
The trio used the lowly fruit fly, well-known to generations of
biology students, as the basis for their experiments.
The winners were announced this year amid an uproar over lobbying
after a leading Swedish newspaper claimed that the 1986 prize had been
''bought'' by an Italian drug firm.
Despite denials by Nobel officials, the report has ignited a debate
about influence on Nobel judges, and may bring more scrutiny of the
laureates this year.
Tonight the 1986 laureate, Italian Rita Levi Montalcini, said she
would not wish the prize on any of her compatriots after the allegations
of corruption over her own award.
The claims ''put me in the dock like drug addicts and Mafiosi'', she
said.
''I've watched colleagues step in to defend me while in reality I
don't have to defend myself from anything,'' she added. ''This is all
madness. And it's why I could not wish the Nobel Prize on any other
Italian researcher.''
The Nobel prize in economics will be announced tomorrow, the physics
and chemistry prizes on Wednesday, and the peace prize on
Friday.--Reuter/AP.

<HEADLINE>Banks battle it out to win farming business</HEADLINE>

BANKS are making good profits, farming fortunes are for the most part
in the ascendant, interest rates are bearable and lenders are once more
keen to put money into agriculture. That is the picture all over
Scotland as the banks increasingly battle for valuable business.
As a leading country manager with the Royal Bank of Scotland put it:
''It's become a very competitive market and pencils are having to be
sharpened.''
A prominent Borders farmer, who recently bought another farm,
confirmed that opinion: ''I decided to do what many businesses are now
doing -- I put my plans out to tender.''
The farmer, who prefers to remain anonymous, added: ''I was astonished
at the range of options offered to me and at the differences in both
rates of interest and terms.''
The result is that he has now moved banks, despite having a good
relationship over many years with his previous lender.
However, changing banks can be expensive, particularly if the previous
borrowing arrangements were at a fixed rate of interest over a specified
period. Frequently, the bank losing out will impose a penalty, though
this is usually made clear when the deal is first agreed. According to
one banker, it can amount to anything between a few hundred and several
thousand pounds.
Actual rates are probably less variable now than in the past with 1.5%
to 2% over base rate the most common, though for less well secured
businesses with a more doubtful record the premium may be as high as 4%.
Inverurie-based Ian Clark, senior agricultural manager with the
Clydesdale Bank, said: ''I would definitely say there are more people
asking for quotes. Farmers are tending to look at the cost of finance in
a similar way to buying a tractor, fertiliser or feed. It's happening in
all businesses and farmers are following the trend, particularly the
more progressive element.''
On the subject of variations in interest rates he said: ''Half a per
cent on a small project doesn't make much difference, but when one
starts talking about large projects of say #500,000 then it can be very
significant.''
With the demand for loans from private individuals muted and the
housing market still slack, agriculture is considered a good investment
by the banks. Mr Clark added: ''Any sector which is seen as being
buoyant will encourage lenders, especially as they see that farmers can
service and repay their borrowings.
''The industry is well up a 10-year cycle of profitability, but it's
important that we don't get caught up with the mistakes of the past.
It's also worth remembering that there have been considerable changes in
bank management over that period. I would hope that we have all learned
during this time.''
Speaking specifically about difficulties faced by farmers in the
North-east in finishing their cereal harvest after the September floods,
he said: ''The harvest has not been quite as problematic as some feared,
but it has been difficult for a handful of individuals.
''I think the banks will be sympathetic in most cases, because there
has been a strengthening of balance sheets over the past two years and
interest rates are about half what they were in the late eighties when
there was a bad harvest. The outlook is reasonable, and I don't think it
will be a mortal blow.
''I do not expect to see a big shake out, but I think it's been a
useful agronomic lesson and we shall see a better spread of crops with
more winter barley and perhaps less winter wheat.''

Singapore
A COURT ruled today that evidence of two murders in Thailand was
''very relevant'' to the trial of a British fugitive accused of
murdering and dismembering of a South African tourist in Singapore.
The accused, John Martin Scripps, who faces the death penalty if
convicted in Singapore, also has been linked to three other
international murders.
Judge T S Sinnathuray of the High Court said he would allow evidence
relating to the killing and dismembering of Canadian schoolteacher
Sheila Damude, 49, and her son, Darin, 23, in the Thai resort of Phuket
in March.
Thai police have issued arrest warrants for Scripps, who is on trial
in Singapore for the murder of Gerard Lowe, a Johannesburg engineer
whose body parts were found floating in rubbish bags in Singapore
harbour in March.
Prosecutor Jennifer Marie said the Thai evidence was relevant ''to
show the striking similarities'' between the murders in the two
countries. Scripps has also been linked to murder and dismemberment
cases in Mexico, Belize, and San Francisco.
The Damudes' skulls, torsos, hands, and legs were found in different
parts of Phuket on March 19 and 24.
Marie said she would produce hotel records to prove that Scripps
befriended the Damudes and stayed in a room next to theirs on March 15
and later moved into their room.
She said she would also show blood stains in the Damudes' room. A
hammer found in Scripps' bag also will be shown to have blood stains
matching the blood of Mrs Damude, Marie said.
Scripps admits that he killed Lowe, but claimed it was after the
32-year-old man made homosexual advances in the hotel room they were
sharing on March 8.
He says the body was disposed of by an unnamed British friend he
approached on the day of the killing. After that, he went to Thailand.
However Marie said the Thai evidence would demolish the defence
argument that Scripps's killing of Lowe was an accident.
''The evidence of the Thai killings will show that the Singapore
killing was not the result of an unfortunate 'buttock touching'
incident,'' Marie said.
It was Scripps' ''cold, systematic, and deliberate plan'' to rob and
kill his victims and dispose of the bodies by skilfully chopping them
up, she said.
Last week, Marie produced witnesses to show that Scripps learned
butchery skills in a British prison in 1993 while serving a
13-year-sentence for drug trafficking. He went on the run from Britain
while on weekend home leave in October 1994.
Singapore police, who arrested Scripps on March 19 when he returned
from Phuket, found in his bags passports of Lowe and the Damudes, two
other forged British passports, credit cards, travel cheques, and some
clothes of his alleged victims.
The trial is expected to continue for several more days.--AP.

Phoenix
AN AMTRAK passenger train derailed in the Arizona desert today,
killing one person and injuring about 65 in what authorities said was an
act of sabotage.
''We have evidence it was not an accident -- it could be terrorist
activity,'' Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio told reporters.
He said two notes found near the crash site spoke of ''retaliation for
Waco and the siege of Ruby Ridge'', two deadly FBI confrontations that
some right-wing groups see as examples of government oppression.
''That's what leads me to believe this is a terrorist attack,'' said
Arpaio. The notes were signed by a little-known group called ''Sons of
the Gestapo''.
Authorities described evidence of a sophisticated plan to derail
Amtrak's Sunset Limited service en route from Miami to Los Angeles,
carrying 248 passengers.
Arpaio said 20 to 30ft of track had been loosened by the saboteurs,
who removed the heavy spikes securing it to the ground. A section of the
north rail had been moved a few inches out of line.
Moving a train rail would normally trigger a computer safety system to
warn oncoming trains but someone had used an electrical cord to link the
disturbed section of rail to the main rail to bypass the warning, he
said.
The derailment occurred at 1.30am local time as the train crossed a
bridge near the small town of Hyder, about 60 miles south-west of
Phoenix.
Joyce Matthews, 49, of British Columbia, was travelling to Disneyland
with her 24-year-old daughter and was asleep when the derailment
happened.
''There was a loud roar and everything was shaking. It was beginning
to tilt and then everything just shook and stopped,'' she said.
When the 12-car train jumped the track, a dining car and two sleeping
cars fell 30ft into a steep gorge. Most of the 30 critically injured
passengers, many of them elderly, were in the cars.
''I heard babies screaming and their mother was hollering each one of
their names, one after the other,'' said Betty Addington, 60, of Dallas,
who was travelling with her 80-year-old mother.
Because of the desert terrain, FBI agents, National Guard personnel,
sheriff's deputies, and firefighters had to be airlifted to the crash
site. Thirteen medical evacuation helicopters were used to fly victims
to hospitals.
Two men detained three miles from the crash site were questioned by
police, but later released.
Today's crash was the second in as many years for Amtrak's Sunset
Limited service. In the worst accident in the company's history, 42
people were killed when a Sunset Limited train plunged into a bay in
Alabama in September, 1993, after bridge supports were weakened when a
barge hit them.--Reuter/AP.

IT IS difficult, if not impossible, to settle a political argument by
recourse to economic statistics. Attempts to do so usually founder on
heated arguments about the nature of the statistics and the
interpretation which is put on them. Nevertheless, it is part of
government's task to gather as many statistics as possible which are
relevant to our economic life and to try to make sense of them. In an
open and democratic society it is just as important that those
statistics are made public so that the electorate can also try to
understand them and appreciate how government spends tax revenue and
other monies. For this reason we welcome the publication of details of
government expenditure and revenue for 1993-94, although in a sense the
new report raises as many questions as it seeks to settle. It is,
inevitably, a limited document. This is in the nature of such
enterprises and anyone seeking information on tablets of stone should
look elsewhere. It is limited because, in assessing government revenue
and expenditure and thereby calculating Scotland's ''fiscal deficit'',
it is restricted to one year which is by coincidence a year in which the
deficit was, even in UK terms, at a cyclical peak. Since then, as we
know to our cost, taxes have risen and public spending has been cut and
for these reasons Scotland's fiscal deficit must have subsided
significantly. Inevitably some figures are more useful than others, but
the report reminds us that even in the calculation of what the deficit
might be, we are inevitably using numbers which are themselves
estimates.
Laying all of this before us, with wall-to-wall caveats, is only
proper. The question is, what does it tell us? Does Scotland have a
fiscal deficit, in other words the difference between revenue raised in
Scotland as opposed to public money spent in Scotland, or would the use
of different figures and assumptions show that Scotland, as the Scottish
National Party would have us believe, more than pays her way and even
has a surplus in the current financial year? It is tempting to try to
keep politics out of the argument, but that is impossible. It is a
political decision which chooses the level of tax to be raised and which
decides, just as importantly, how it is to be spent. The Government is
serene in its belief that Scotland gets a good deal from the national
exchequer. Chancellor Kenneth Clarke in this newspaper recently
indicated that the system of allocating money to Scotland was generous
and would not be changed from the existing formula to one involving a
per capita calculation. The Scottish Secretary, Mr Michael Forsyth, has
said that this change would be made over his dead body and Mr Clarke
appears willing to add his corpse to the argument.
Nevertheless, none of this sheds much light on the most curious
element in the new report. While appearing to show with some clarity
that Scotland does, indeed, have a fiscal deficit, the economists take
matters a little further and suggest that Scotland exhibits a pronounced
structural budget deficit. What can this mean? Evidence of structural
abnormalities is generally taken to be a serious matter. Yet if there is
a structural budget deficit it is difficult to see how it can be
explained by any means other than the Government's own method of
apportioning money to Scotland. Mr Forsyth will argue that this is the
price which must be paid for Government generosity, but if this is a
worry a Scottish assembly with mild tax-raising powers could help out.
Not, it is true, sufficient to remove the deficit, but certainly enough
to prevent Mr Forsyth and Mr Clarke offering their dead bodies for
Scotland.

An APPRECIATION
THE death of Lord Home means the loss of one of the finest examples of
all that is best in the aristocratic tradition of politics in Britain.
He first entered the House of Commons in 1931 and did not leave
Parliament until 1974.
During that period, I do not think he made a single personal enemy,
although much controversy came his way.
His natural courtesy enabled him to mix easily with all sorts of
people and he had firm friends and admirers on all sides, including many
who disagreed strongly with some of his political views.
His political career fell into four main parts. The first, in the
1930s, was an apprenticeship crowned by being Parliamentary Private
Secretary to Neville Chamberlain at the time of the Munich debacle.
He was often reminded of his connection with ''appeasement'' but I
never heard him utter a word of criticism of Chamberlain, and he
certainly believed that, in delaying the war by one year, Chamberlain
probably provided the essential time for Britain to start re-arming,
enough to avoid defeat in 1940.
This experience did, however, give Alec a deep distrust of dictators
which stood him in good stead.
In the second phase of his career he overcame ill-health to hold a
number of junior offices, culminating in becoming the first Minister of
State at the Scottish Office in the 1950s. This gave him a wide
experience of all aspects of government.
Then came his brief, but very nearly successful, time as Prime
Minister in 1963-64. In fact, it was a great achievement to unite the
Conservative Party after the Profumo scandal and very nearly to win the
General Election of 1964.
During this period he handled the derogatory insults of press and
opponents with considerable aplomb. We all remember that when Harold
Wilson derided him as ''the 14th Earl of Home'' he responded: ''Well, I
suppose he is the 14th Mr Wilson.''
It was typical of Alec that he set up the Conservative Party system
for electing the leader, and then proceeded to use it to allow his
successor, Ted Heath, to succeed him. His clear sense of duty was never
better displayed.
The final phase of his career was in many respects the finest of them
all. He had no hesitation in serving his successors with enormous
distinction and total loyalty. In all the years from 1965 until his
complete retirement, we never heard him utter a word of criticism of his
successors -- something some of those who followed him might be well
advised to note.
Alec Home's grasp of British and world affairs was immense. Throughout
his long period as Foreign Secretary, he was a genuine world figure as a
statesman and was greatly respected by all who dealt with him.
He was one of the very few Western statesmen who could talk on equal
terms with Andrei Gromyko, the veteran Soviet Foreign Minister.
Many of our former colonies knew him as a friend and he was always
listened to with great respect both in European and transatlantic
circles.
Through all this, he never lost the common touch. He was fond of
telling the story about how, when Prime Minister, he faced an angry
meeting of farmers and, as he thought, persuaded them all to agree with
him.
The next day, however, he received a telegram from one of his
constituents who had been present, reading: ''To hell with you.
Offensive letter follows.''
I often relied on him for advice when I was responsible for Scottish
and Defence Affairs over many years. I never asked for his help in vain.
His advice was sound and always totally loyal to his leader and his
country.
Alec Home was a bigger man than most of those around him. The last
time I spoke to him, he was absolutely well informed on all the issues
of the day, although he could no longer read the newspapers and relied
on TV for his information.
The quality of Alec Home will not easily be matched, and Scotland and
the wider world are very much the poorer for his passing.

THE one-over-par 73 compiled by big-hitting George Stubbs in a strong
wind and heavy underfoot conditions at Haggs Castle was the outstanding
score of The Herald's seventh annual Parbusters final and may be the
forerunner of greater achievements.
This was a first national success for the 30-year-old insurance broker
from Perth, whose bid to make a mark in this year's order of merit
events was thwarted by his (then) handicap of one being too high. He was
balloted out of the Tennant Cup and West of Scotland opens.
Stubbs, a member of the Dun Whinny club at Gleneagles, is now down to
scratch for the first time since he was a teenager. His 73 last
Wednesday, a Parbusters score of minus two, will help consolidate this
mark, which will be his passport into the top amateur competitions as
soon as work commitments permit -- either next season or the one after.
For his overall good form this season, in which he won the Perth and
Kinross Champion of Champions title, he credits a maturing approach to
the game by keeping his temperament in good shape. ''I am concentrating
nowadays on what I can do instead of what I have done,'' he explained
after an acceptance speech of such eloquence that you might have thought
he had done this more often than he actually has.
His new-found powers of positive thinking were quickly put to good
effect. He was one of the lucky few who began at the first in the
shotgun start, but three-putted for a bogey 6, a shot he immediately
retrieved by holing from 25 feet for a birdie 2 at the next.
Birdies followed at the fourth, fifth, and ninth all with putts of six
feet or less, but there was a mid-round crisis when he dropped shots at
the seventh, eighth, tenth, and eleventh.
A run of pars steadied him and although he bogeyed the seventeenth, he
finished with a flourish by reaching the 476-yard par-5 last with a
drive and No.7-iron for a closing birdie to win by two shots from
Biggar's Bryce Kerr in a small but high-quality men's scratch field of
eight containing no fewer than four plus handicappers.
Not for the first time, two winners emerged from the same group and
one of Stubbs' playing partners was Belle Robertson, fresh from a top-15
finish in the American Ladies' Seniors Championship in Minneapolis and a
100% record in the Curtis Cup-style North America v Europe match which
followed.
Robertson took the women's scratch title following a test of
arithmetic for the organisers when three players tied on seven-over-par
80.
Also on that mark were home-club player Dorothea Hastings and Troon's
Sharon Lambie, who was left in third place with 41 over the conventional
inward half against 38 by the two others, and Hastings was runner-up
with a last six of 26 compared to Robertson's strong finish over these
holes of one-under-par 24.
This card play-off might not have been necessary had Robertson not
fallen foul of the rules by playing from the wrong tee at the third.
Having opened tidily with a birdie 4 and then a par 3, she mistakenly
played from the women's forward markers -- a mere two yards ahead of the
right ones.
She proceeded under Rule 11-4b and corrected the error by playing from
the proper tee, adding a two-shot penalty which led to a triple-bogey 7.
Upset by this incident, more dropped shots followed at the fourth,
fifth, seventh, and eighth, two of them the result of missed short
putts, and out in 42 she reckoned her chances of success were slim.
Three putts at each of the next two holes didn't help her cause, either,
but Robertson never has been a player to throw in the towel and this
never-say-die attitude pulled her through to the triumph that had seemed
well beyond her reach.
She covered the remaining holes in one under par with birdies at the
thirteenth and seventeenth countered by a dropped shot at the tough
fourteenth.
The title of Parbusters champion for 1995 may not be the most
illustrious achievement of Scotland's doyen of the women's amateur
scene, a veteran of seven Curtis Cup campaigns, but in her sixtieth year
it is no mean feat. The honorary member of her home club Dunaverty, now
living in Bearsden, has, moreover, regained a scratch mark this year,
setting in the process a record three-under-par 69 at Bonnyton.
Stubbs unwittingly played in part in the men's handicap success of
Cardross 14-handicapper Jim McHugh. The 44-year-old motor engineering
lecturer was playing in the group ahead and soon became aware of the
prodigious hitting from behind. McHugh rightly figured he was not
competing against this player, but said he took inspiration from the
long balls thumping down behind him to show what he could do as well.
A steady round containing a birdie at the seventeenth, four pars, and
nothing worse than a 6 gave him victory by three shots from East
Kilbride's Frank Ferris, and his Parbusters score of minus three should
result in a handicap cut to 13, two below the target which the former
footballer -- a latecomer to golf -- set himself at the beginning of the
year.
The women's handicap champion was Kilmarnock Barassie 15-handicapper
Michele Caldwell, a pharmacist at Ayr Hospital and a mother-of-two. She
thought her net three-over-par 76 was well out of the running,
especially having taken three putts at each of her last three holes, the
eighteenth, first, and second. She was, in fact, four clear of
second-placed Lorraine Morrow, the third member of the Stubbs-Robertson
group.
Starting at the third, Caldwell dropped nine shots in her opening
seven holes, but four pars on a steady inward nine of 42 gave her what
turned out to be a comfortable cushion.
The competition for match secretaries -- from a field of seven arrived
at by ballot -- resulted in a win for Glenbervie's Robert Clapperton,
with a net 78 off seven. And best among the guests was Sandy Murray,
operations director of co-sponsors Morrison Bowmore Distillers, whose
net 75 off six was two better than Haggs captain Ken Perston.

THE Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals is
warning people against investing in ostrich farming schemes, writes ROY
GREGOR.
It questions the validity of claims of great financial returns in some
enterprises and fears that a recent spate of promotional adverts might
encourage people with no knowledge or experience of animal husbandry to
attempt to rear a species about which little is known in this country.
SSPCA chief executive James Morris said: ''We believe there are
serious welfare concerns in relation to the farming of ostriches in
Scotland, including the climate and the ability of owners to meet the
birds' behavioural needs and to maintain them in good health. We are
also extremely concerned over the transport and humane slaughter of such
birds.''

IT WAS a whole new ball-game at Hampden yesterday as a group of the
Scotland rugby league players in next week's Emerging Nations World Cup
in England were handed a #10,000 sponsorship cheque by ScottishPower.
And giant Maori Charlie McAllister was yesterday unveiled as
Scotland's bounty from a mutiny.
The muscular Kiwi will help to spearhead the rugby league challenge
from north of the Border and yesterday he revealed the amazing tale that
gives him the credentials to wear the white thistle.
He said: ''My grandad, William Walter McAllister, was born and raised
on the Mull of Kintyre and went to sea as a young man.
''He was part of a crew who staged a mutiny somewhere in the South
Seas and they forced the captain to divert to New Zealand, where they
all jumped ship.
''They had to lie low for a while to let the dust settle -- but
eventually they were granted a royal pardon and told they could go back
to Britain if they wanted.
''But he had fallen in love with New Zealand -- and more especially a
Maori girl. They got married -- and I'm one of the by-products!''
The 31-year-old insisted: ''My blood may be only one-eighth Scottish,
but I'm fiercely proud of my links here.
''I went up to the Highlands last year intending to go ski-ing. But I
ended up spending the whole time in and around the shops of Braemar,
studying history books and tracing my clan back through the
generations.''
McAllister has been based in England for eight years and has starred
for Oldham, Sheffield Eagles, and Keighley. He is currently player-coach
for semi-pro outfit Higginshaw.
The Scots kick off their campaign on Monday against Russia at
Featherstone, before facing USA at Northampton two days later and Cook
Islands at Castleford a week on Friday.
The group winners will contest the final against the top side from the
other section, which contains Ireland, Moldova, and Morocco.
McAllister said: ''We know that Russia will be a real handful because
they have just finished a very successful tour of France. They beat the
top club, Catalan, then ran the national team close.
''We don't know much about America -- but the Cook Islands will be a
tough one because they will have a few good New Zealanders in their
squad.''
The rugby league giant already has one confirmed fan -- Scotland Grand
Slam hero Sean Lineen. He said: ''I played against him a few years back
when he was a top-notch centre.''
Team manager John Risman said: ''Playing in the competition is all
about credibility, because Scotland have never taken part in any rugby
league tournament.
''This cash will go a long way to giving us an element of credibility.
''It is important to look the part, and thanks to ScottishPower, we
are kitting ourselves out with the best of gear both on and off the
park.''
Risman added: ''Our aim is also to become the first ever Scotland
football team to bring home a World Cup -- and I'm confident we can do
that.''
Coach George Fairbairn said: ''We have a good blend of seasoned pros
and youngsters and if everyone can perform to his potential, then we
have a great chance.''
Fairbairn, who quit Kelso 21 years ago to join the pro ranks,
revealed: ''I took the squad back there at the weekend for a training
stint.
''I felt so proud to be with them in my home town -- and it was
tremendous the help and encouragement we received fom even the most
dyed-in-the-wool union followers.''
The Scots will be skippered by former Great Britain and Kelso hero
Alan Tait.
Each side in this competition -- which is being run in parallel with
the main World Cup -- is permitted only three full-time pros on the
field at any one time.
Risman added: ''We've already signed up a piper to lead us into every
game -- but despite our sponsors, there is no truth in the rumour that
we are changing the words of the anthem to POWER of Scotland!''

FUND MANAGEMENT
BRITANNIA Building Society has reorganised its Glasgow-based fund
management operations, separating them completely from its life
assurance business, writes ROBERT POWELL.
The aim of the move by Britain's sixth-largest building society is to
make its fund management operations more independent and focussed.
Scottish Amicable undertook a similar move in May, hiving off its fund
management operations into Scottish Amicable Investment Managers, an
autonomous subsidiary, whose directors have their own share option
scheme.
Britannia Life policyholders have sold their two-thirds stake in
Britannia Investment Managers (BIM) and Britannia Fund Managers (BFM) to
Britannia Building Society, the parent company for an undisclosed sum.
BIM will continue to manage #1900m of Britannia Life assets as part of
its overall #3500m fund management portfolio, but it will now be at arms
length from its partner instead of directly owned by it.
BIM also looks after #500m of unit trust funds placed through its
sister company BFM and #700m of external funds.
''We are now even more focussed on investment management,'' said Danny
O'Neil, who is managing director of both BIM and BFM.
''Effectively the two companies are merged. They have one set of
investment managers who are all BIM employees. It is just the backroom
function that is split.''

ENGINEERING
BABCOCK Energy yesterday signed a contract to supply up to #10m of
pollution control equipment to ScottishPower.
Babcock's Renfrew plant will build an advanced burner system to reduce
nitrogen oxide emissions from Cockenzie coal-fired power station in East
Lothian by up to 70%. Nitrogen oxide emissions are a major cause of acid
rain.
The pollution control equipment should allow Cockenzie to burn more
coal without breaching European Union rules on the emission of noxious
gases.
ScottishPower will initially fit the advanced burner system to one of
four boilers at the power station at a cost of #3m. If it proves
successful, similar equipment will be fitted to the other three.
Ken Vowles, the managing director of ScottishPower's electricity
generation wholesale division, said the pollution control scheme at
Cockenzie, and a similar project to burn coal with natural gas at
Longannet in Fife, would prolong the life of ScottishPower's coal-fired
plants.

the proper tee, adding a two-shot penalty which led to a triple-bogey 7.
Upset by this incident, more dropped shots followed at the fourth,
fifth, seventh, and eighth, two of them the result of missed short
putts, and out in 42 she reckoned her chances of success were slim.
Three putts at each of the next two holes didn't help her cause, either,
but Robertson never has been a player to throw in the towel and this
never-say-die attitude pulled her through to the triumph that had seemed
well beyond her reach.
She covered the remaining holes in one under par with birdies at the
thirteenth and seventeenth countered by a dropped shot at the tough
fourteenth.
The title of Parbusters champion for 1995 may not be the most
illustrious achievement of Scotland's doyen of the women's amateur
scene, a veteran of seven Curtis Cup campaigns, but in her sixtieth year
it is no mean feat. The honorary member of her home club Dunaverty, now
living in Bearsden, has, moreover, regained a scratch mark this year,
setting in the process a record three-under-par 69 at Bonnyton.
Stubbs unwittingly played in part in the men's handicap success of
Cardross 14-handicapper Jim McHugh. The 44-year-old motor engineering
lecturer was playing in the group ahead and soon became aware of the
prodigious hitting from behind. McHugh rightly figured he was not
competing against this player, but said he took inspiration from the
long balls thumping down behind him to show what he could do as well.
A steady round containing a birdie at the seventeenth, four pars, and
nothing worse than a 6 gave him victory by three shots from East
Kilbride's Frank Ferris, and his Parbusters score of minus three should
result in a handicap cut to 13, two below the target which the former
footballer -- a latecomer to golf -- set himself at the beginning of the
year.
The women's handicap champion was Kilmarnock Barassie 15-handicapper
Michele Caldwell, a pharmacist at Ayr Hospital and a mother-of-two. She
thought her net three-over-par 76 was well out of the running,
especially having taken three putts at each of her last three holes, the
eighteenth, first, and second. She was, in fact, four clear of
second-placed Lorraine Morrow, the third member of the Stubbs-Robertson
group.
Starting at the third, Caldwell dropped nine shots in her opening
seven holes, but four pars on a steady inward nine of 42 gave her what
turned out to be a comfortable cushion.
The competition for match secretaries -- from a field of seven arrived
at by ballot -- resulted in a win for Glenbervie's Robert Clapperton,
with a net 78 off seven. And best among the guests was Sandy Murray,
operations director of co-sponsors Morrison Bowmore Distillers, whose
net 75 off six was two better than Haggs captain Ken Perston.

LLOYDS Bank and the TSB are in talks which could lead to the emergence
of Britain's second-biggest bank with a stock market valuation of around
#14.8bn and 3200 branches throughout the UK.
It is certain to spark off further rationalisation in High Street
banking where it is generally accepted that there are too many outlets,
especially since the banks and building societies now have to compete
with telephone banking and the financial services offered by others such
as department store groups.
There are fears that the merged Lloyds TSB Group will shed a
substantial number of workers. It has been suggested that as many as
5000 could go. Lloyds, chaired by former civil servant Sir Robin Ibbs,
has 59,000 staff, while the TSB under Sir Nicholas Goodison employs
27,000. Those most at risk would seem to be in the South of England
where there is the greatest overlap in branch numbers and Lloyds is much
more widely represented for historical reasons.
With its Scottish origins, the TSB is concentrated in Scotland, the
North of England and the Midlands.
In addition to branch staff, those employed in the data processing
activities and particularly insurance would also appear to be at risk.
Lloyds chief executive Sir Brian Pitman warned recently that the
banking industry would have to shed 75,000 jobs over the next five years
because of the competition.
The merged bank will be ranked second in size only to HSBC, which took
over the Midland Bank in 1992, and be larger than both Barclays and
National Westminster.
In a brief joint statement which took the City by surprise, the two
banks said the Lloyds offer would value each TSB share at 329p,
including a special dividend of 68p net.
They added that if the merger did take place, it would be in the best
interests of customers, staff and shareholders.
Stock market reaction was to send TSB shares soaring 78p to 351p for a
market capitalisation of #5376m.
Lloyds jumped 21p to 724p for a market value of #9497m, reflecting
pleasure that it was making a highly logical move and with much less
risk than it would encounter almost anywhere else in the banking sector.
The TSB price rise was also inspired by hopes of a counter-offer
either from another British bank or financially oriented organisation or
an overseas bidder -- the TSB has been a rumoured bid target for most of
the years of its existence after the 1986 flotation at 100p a share.
If Lloyds succeeds its shareholders will own 70% of the enlarged group
and TSB 30%.
The two banks are somewhat similar in that they have concentrated on
expansion in the UK rather than moving overseas and both have an above
average exposure to insurance. Until the scandals two years ago over the
mis-selling of pensions, which badly affected customer confidence, this
was a rapidly growing area for both -- Lloyds also owns 63% of the
Lloyds Abbey Life quoted insurance company.
One incentive for Lloyds is that TSB owns the second division but
niche player Hill Samuel merchant bank. That was acquired for a total of
#777m and immediately ran up huge losses, pushing 1992 group profits
down to a mere #5m.
However, it has recovered strongly and provides a platform upon which
Lloyds could develop its medium-size corporate banking business -- it
has no merchant banking subsidiary.

ALEC DOUGLAS HOME, who died yesterday, was a distinguished Foreign
Secretary if an improbable Prime Minister. Membership of the House of
Lords was widely supposed to be a disqualification for that office: it
had certainly disqualified Curzon in 1922 and the last Premier to lead
the country from the Lords was Salisbury in 1895. Lord Home, as he then
was, did not lead from the Upper House for long. He was quick to exploit
the constitutional opportunity created by Anthony Wedgwood Benn's
successful dropping of his hereditary title, and became plain Sir Alec
and a commoner to be returned to the Commons, after a by-election at
Perth and Kinross when the Tories unexpectedly chose him to succeed
Harold Macmillan in 1963. Macmillan was his chief promoter -- in order
to ditch Butler -- but the fact was that Home enjoyed an unusual degree
of respect, something which surfaced again in yesterday's wide spectrum
of tributes.
That ability to survive by radical adaptation may serve to
characterise a man who was, as Mr Major put it yesterday, ''understated
and underestimated''. He was certainly far more able than his own
modesty allowed, and after the failures of the Wilson administration
(despite its leader being a brilliant economist) observers and critics
alike became less censorious of his admission that his own economic
calculations were aided by matchsticks.
Home was the last Tory leader to ''emerge'' by an obscure process of
consultation among the party's MPs and members in the Lords. His
emergence was widely resented even within the Conservative Party, where
two distinguished colleagues, Enoch Powell and Iain Macleod, refused to
serve under him. Yet neither that, nor his hereditary position, should
conceal that he lost the 1964 election very narrowly indeed to Harold
Wilson, widely regarded as the most successful leader of the Opposition
this century. Having lost, Home was able to substitute a democratic
electoral system for choosing future leaders, though his mechanism has
had to be refined. It was quite typical of Home that he was content to
serve Heath, his Tory successor, as Foreign Secretary in 1970. In fact
it was in the field of foreign affairs that he won his reputation for
sound judgment and clear expression: Harold Macmillan's famous phrase
about ''the wind of change is blowing through this continent'', which
stunned the South African Parliament in 1960, is sometimes claimed as
his, as it might have been, given that he was far-sighted.
Opinion in his own day might not have accepted that view, for he was
long held to have shared Neville Chamberlain's poor judgment of Hitler
which produced the Munich settlement in 1938. Home was his Parliamentary
Private Secretary, and accompanied the Prime Minister to the
negotiations. That opinion has not been sustained, though Home was
sympathetic to Chamberlain's plight, as his own accounts of the Munich
episode make clear.
Home did turn his mind to the constitutional challenge of Scottish
devolution and at one time appeared to have a formula which might have
reconciled Scottish Tories to that process in general, if to no definite
scheme in particular. If anyone could have done that it would have been
him, but his interest was not sustained and sometimes even cynically
dismissed as simple electioneering. Home was altogether a more complex
personality than he seemed, and a less unlikely Prime Minister than his
social status suggested. His death at the start of what looks like being
an exceptionally difficult conference for his party may confer some
benefits on it by reminding not just Tories but the nation at large of
his integrity, his good conduct, and his long public service.

IT WOULD be nice to think that the old saltire could be flown with
some gusto in the next couple of weeks as Scottish football teams get in
among the international set. The two national games with Sweden, full
and 'B' matches, may not mean a great deal in the grand scheme of things
but a couple of victories would do no harm at all to the tartan psyche
as the three home clubs involved in Europe prepare for their big tests
next Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.
Raith Rovers, the amazing lads from Kirkcaldy, are in there against
Bayern Munich, Rangers are off to meet Juventus, and Celtic head for
Paris to take on Saint Germain. We will wish them all well but first and
foremost, I suggest, we should all be standing up waving the flag for
Sam Torrance as he tries his luck in the Toyota World Matchplay
championship at Wentworth later this week, not because golf and Sam are
more important than the others but because our man is only in there as
an afterthought.
It is ridiculous that the man who is No.1 in the European Order of
Merit has scraped into the major head-to-head tournament in the world
only on the defection of Seve Ballesteros, even if the organisers have
not admitted as much. Unlike most of the others who received their
invitations to the competition a few weeks ago, Torrance was left
wondering if, indeed, he would be given his chance at all.
The indications are that, if Seve had not decided to take a long rest
from the business after the Ryder Cup, Torrance would not have been
asked to take part by the tournament organisers, IMG.
The difficulties for the administrators is easy enough to understand
in that whoever is among the chosen dozen golfers from around the world
inevitably there will be unrest somewhere. However, to ignore the man
who has been among the most consistent players at the highest level
anywhere in the world would have been inexcusable, especally as no-one
in Europe has won more than the three tournament first prizes he has
collected.
The truth is that Sam deserved his place before Seve, who would only
have been there on past glories. Even more unacceptable would have been
his exclusion at the expense of David Duval, a young and extremely
promising American who, even if he turns out to be their Rookie of the
Year, scarcely matches up to the 24-year consistency at the top which
sets Torrance apart from most of his peers.
Sam is maybe not as well known in the States as Colin Montgomerie or
Bernhard Langer but it is hard to believe he is not at least as big an
attraction as Costantino Rocca who is also in the match-play line-up. In
any case, everything he has done this year, including his Ryder Cup
performance in Rochester, warrants his place among any top dozen you
care to name and his game is so finely tuned at present that he is
capable of doing well in any company.
Sam has twice lost to Japanese players in the Wentworth tournament but
is a better, more confident player these days. He also demonstrates
human traits, like smoking, enjoying a pint and a bet and, unlike so
many machine-like golfers, is unafraid of showing his emotions. Golf
needs characters, people who are genuine individualists and, if Torrance
can lose the rag with the best of them, he can also weep with pleasure
playing the game he loves, without ever considering it the meaning of
life.
We will cheer Monty this week, too, because he is a wonderful golfer
who is unquestionably among the top four or five on earth, but the fact
that they were going to leave Sam out will guarantee even more solid
Scottish support. We don't like to see our star men being put down,
except, of course, when we do it ourselves.

IF the TSB's story is about prudence, then that of Lloyds is about
personalities.
While tracing its origins back to the times of the Lloyds coffee
house, it has never had any direct connection with the embattled Lloyd's
of London insurance market.
The bank has been one of the most aggressive but sometimes indecisive
in recent years under former chairman Sir Jeremy Morse and his chief
executive Sir Brian Pitman. That is continuing under the current
chairman, former civil servant Sir Robin Ibbs.
Like the other English High Street banks, Lloyds grew through merger,
and not always successfully, as its purchase of minority interests in
the Bank of London and South America about 25 years ago shows. That
brought it huge exposure to South America, where the combination of
deprecating currencies and rampant inflation left it nursing long-term
wounds which only now have healed. The attempted #1167m bid for Standard
Chartered Bank in 1986 came to nothing.
In 1992, the black horse bank lost out in the takeover battle for the
Midland Bank, partly because it lacked the determination to launch a
formal offer against the might of the much bigger Hong Kong and Shanghai
Bank. However, it did concentrate earlier than most on bancassurance by
building up a 60% stake in Lloyds Abbey Life.
But success came with the #1800m acquisition of the Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester Building Society. This was a much more sure-footed move,
breaking new ground in the industry and sparking off the current round
of building society mergers and takeovers. But that does not seem to
have been sufficient for Sir Brian.
Generally regarded as the dominant personality in British banking, he
is harsh towards those unable to repay their debts. He was originally
due to retire in 1991 and has continually postponed the move, partly, it
is thought, because he wanted to go out on a wave of glory.
The bank has been the best investment in the sector as it has not had
a rights issue since 1976 and has had a dividend record up with the
best.
To exploit its substantial capital base, Lloyds has to acquire,
although most were expecting it to try for another building society
after the success of the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester purchase.

THE probable merger of Lloyds and the TSB will effectively bring down
the curtain on a Scottish institution whose history stretches back
almost two centuries.
Long regarded as a family favourite in the West of Scotland, it ceased
to have meaningful independence nine years ago, when a group of
depositors, led by James Ross of Kinross, failed to stop the TSB
flotation.
Along with SNP leader Gordon Wilson, the retired senior civil servant
from the Scottish Office mounted a lengthy campaign to keep control of
the TSB in Scotland.
It finally proved futile in July 1986, when five Law Lords ruled that
depositors had no present or future rights to the bank's surplus assets.
Mr Wilson said at the time: ''Ownership of one of our largest
companies (is going to) pass to London. This is part of the process of
centralisation which is, bit by bit, destroying the Scottish economy.''
In reality, the battle to save the institution for Scotland was lost
back then. But yesterday's announcement will almost certainly be the
final straw, signalling the likely downgrading of the bank's Scottish
subsidiary to the regional arm of a UK plc.
City-watchers are forecasting that the new entity will take the name
Lloyds-TSB Group, but at least one analyst predicted that the second
half of the title would soon be dropped. It is, after all, less than
snappy.
Another analyst, Ernest Duckett of broker Tilney, said a merger would
trigger fierce competition among Scottish High Street banks.
However, he believes the deal makes sense for both the TSB, which is
chaired by Sir Nicholas Goodison, and Lloyds. ''TSB will benefit from
being part of what we regard as the best-managed bank in the UK, and the
fact that the two are geographically complementary is an added plus.
''Quite clearly, the competition in Scotland is going to increase
markedly in the next year or two.''
TSB Scotland employs about 2500 people north of the Border, including
1800 in its 200-strong branch network. It also owns Slater Hogg Howison,
Scotland's largest estate agency.
It seems likely that the merged company will use the TSB network as a
platform for growth in Scotland. Lloyds has only three branches here (in
Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen), but possesses a reputation for
strength in the commercial banking sector.
Any casualties of post-merger rationalisation are likely to be in
England, where the TSB has around 800 branches, including an overlap
with Lloyds' traditional homeland in the south, and with the
newly-acquired Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society in the south and
south-west.
Details of the possible economies of scale, and how much autonomy the
merged Scottish operation will have, were not forthcoming yesterday from
either bank.
The futures of the heads of the Scottish arm of the TSB -- chairman
Gordon Anderson and chief executive Alastair Dempster -- will also have
to be discussed before the comprehensive merger plan is unveiled.
However, they can reflect with some satisfaction on their last
full-year results. In the year to October 1994, TSB Scotland declared
very healthy pre-tax profits of #79m on an operating income of #192m.
But news of the merger received a less than friendly response from the
Opposition political parties yesterday.
Alistair Darling, Labour's City spokesman, said: ''Any takeover may
have profound consequences on the provision of other financial services
in the UK. We are concerned to ensure that there is genuine competition
in the system.
''The history of bank mergers and takeovers is such that the public is
entitled to ask searching questions as to what exactly is proposed, and
what the expectations are.''
His SNP counterpart, Fergus Ewing, was more scathing. He said: ''Will
Lloyds give any guarantees to safeguard Scottish jobs -- and will they
be worth any more than those issued and dishonoured by the likes of
Guinness, Rolls-Royce and Tate &amp; Lyle?
''Scots will remember that at the time of the TSB flotation, a small
but vocal group asserted that the true owners of the bank were, in fact,
the Scottish depositors. The depositors were ignored and treated with
contempt -- now it appears that the interests of Scottish employees are
to be ignored.''
Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce added: ''This merger
must be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission but, on the
Government's past record, it probably won't be.
''Change is not a bad thing, but the restrictions on choice for
consumers and the implications for jobs need objective consideration.
''This announcement effectively marks the end of the road for the
savings bank movement, which has a long and honourable history in this
country.''
TSB HISTORY
* 1810: The Reverend Dr Henry Duncan establishes a savings bank in
Ruthwell, Dumfries-shire, catering for people with insufficient money to
use joint stock banks.
* 1817: His idea proves so popular, especially in Scotland, that a
Savings Bank Act is passed, to ensure regulation of the growing number
of institutions. All savings are deposited with Commissioners for
Reduction of National Debt; no trustee is allowed to benefit from his
office.
* 1945: The TSBs have more customers than any other bank in the UK.
* 1965: First cheque account introduced.
* 1968: New unit trust brought in, as TSBs seek Governmental
permission to lend.
* 1973: Publication of Page Committee Report, which envisages TSBs
undergoing radical change and offering customers full range of banking
services, and receiving autonomy from Government.
* 1975: The 73 TSBs amalgamate into 19.
* 1983: The 19 become four: TSB Scotland, England and Wales, Northern
Ireland and Channel Islands.
* 1986: The group receives permission from House of Lords to go ahead
with flotation, after a battle by some Scottish depositors to prevent
it. It has eight subsidiaries: the four ''regions'', TSB Investment
Management, Trust Company, Trustcard and UDT Holdings (acquired in
1981).
* 1987: After flotation, TSB buys merchant bank Hill Samuel and Target
Group, a life assurance and pensions company.
* 1992: Merger of TSB retail banking and insurance operations to form
first genuine UK bancassurance business.
* 1995: Announcement of merger talks with Lloyds.

MINING
THE world's largest mining company, RTZ, is set to grow even further
by merging with its 49%-owned CRA associate in Australia, writes ANDREW
WILSON.
The result will be a group valued at #13bn.
RTZ chairman Sir Derek Birkin said it was not a takeover as the
businesses would be combined in a unified structure with managemnt and
assets shared. The share quotations of both companies will be retained
-- RTZ will have 76.5% of the new group and CRA 23.5%.
The nearest analogy is perhaps Unilever, which has both British and
Dutch legal identities.
CRA is orientated towards production in the Pacific Rim countries. Its
main products are aluminium, iron ore and internationally traded coal.
RTZ is concentrated in North and South America and Africa with a bias
towards copper, borax and titanium dioxide used in paint and paper.
In effect, RTZ has acquired CRA without paying a premium, although the
continuing quotation in Australia will help tap capital markets there
more efficiently.
Benefits will include being able to rationalise the exploration
programme which is running at the equivalent of #150m a year, although
there will be virtually no job losses elsewhere.

* This week's tip comes from NEIL COLQUHOUN, the professional at the
Merchants of Edinburgh Golf Club.
BAD posture causes terrible shots, but a helpful tip to get into the
correct position is to hold a club parallel to the ground with the arms
hanging straight down (picture far left). The shoulders should be over
the toes, the spine should be straight, and most of the weight should be
on the balls of the feet.
Now check three angles: 1, the shoulders to hips; 2, the hips to
knees; 3, the knees to ankles. It is useful to carry out this exercise
side-on to a mirror.
The next priority is to maintain good posture at the top of the
backswing (picture near left). The three angles should be the same as
address, and most importantly the right knee should remain flexed.
The major fault of handicap golfers is straightening the right knee.
That results in loss of tension on the backswing. The right knee must
remain slightly bent -- you should feel the tension in the back of the
calf and thigh.
A good top-of-backswing position provides a great base for swinging
through to the target.

AFTER an interval of 29 years the Amateur Championship is to return in
1999 to the Royal County Down club at Newcastle. The 36-hole qualifying
competition will be played on May 31 and June 1 over the championship
course and at Kilkeel, after which the leading 64 players will go
forward to the match-play rounds, which conclude on June 5 with the
final.
The Royal and Ancient club's announcement yesterday continues the
restoration of Northern Ireland to the wider golf arena. In 1993 the
Amateur was held at Royal Portrush, where this season the British Senior
Open and the home international matches also were played.
On the last occasion, in 1970, when the Amateur was held at Newcastle
Michael Bonallack, secretary of the R&amp;A, won the title for the third
successive year and the fifth time in all. His victim in the final was
the American, Bill Hyndman, whom Bonallack had also defeated in the
ultimate match the previous year at Hoylake.
* BRIAN Barnes has finished No.1 on the PGA Seniors Tour Order of
Merit and with it the John Jacobs Trophy with winnings of #63,620,
including victory in the Senior British Open at Royal Portrush. Barnes,
who had to withdraw from the season-ending Lexus Trophy said: ''My right
leg is still swollen but I hope to try for my US Senior Tour card next
month.''
John Morgan, the 1994 No.1, was second with #57,948 ahead of Brian
Huggett (#50,011), Tommy Horton (#44,886), Neil Coles (#41,902) and
Antonio Garrido (#37,771).
* LEE Trevino shot a six-under-par 66 for a three-stroke victory in
The Transamerica seniors tournament in California. Trevino, 55, finished
with a 15-under-par 201 total on Silverado's South Course for his second
victory of the year and twenty-sixth overall on the Senior PGA Tour. He
earned $97,500 to increase his season total to $804,210. Leading scores
(Americans unless stated):
201 -- L Trevino 66, 69, 66. 204 -- B Summerhays 67, 68, 69. 205 -- B
Smith 66, 69, 70. 206 -- B Murphy 66, 72, 68.
Other scores included: 211 -- B Charles (New Zealand) 71, 69, 71. 212
-- T Weiskopf 69, 71, 72. 215 -- T Jacklin (Britain) 68, 73, 74. 217 --
G Player (S Africa) 73, 73, 71. 222 -- A Palmer 76, 72, 74.
* HAGGS Castle have won the Greenlees Trophy, the West of Scotland
women's league competition, for the third year in a row. This year they
won the top division by four points from Troon.
The Glasgow club -- whose men's section picked up the wooden spoon in
the Brand Putter League -- have enjoyed a strength in depth this season
with nine single-figure handicap players to call on, led by Janice
Gardner with former Scottish champions Dorothea Hastings and Aileen
Wilson at No.2 and No.3 respectively. The ladies' captain, Jennifer

TO some extent the September producer input and output prices revived
the debate about inflationary pressures within the economy but the main
worry is that slowdown will prove to be more than that and could even
mean that the actual recovery is faltering.
The Chancellor has insisted that the present rate of growth is
sustainable and set to run and run and that prospects for next year are
good. But others, including the CBI, are not so sure or, at any rate,
not as confident as they were at one time.
An element of caution has crept into forecasts with a certain amount
of hedging taking place. The CBI now believes that the next appropriate
move in interest rates is more likely to be down after previously
forecasting an increase, though that admittedly was based on data which
has since modified.
It is still cautiously optimistic for next year that there will be a
reasonable rate of growth as disposable income picks up, underpinning
consumer growth. But there would also need to be a pick up in the US and
further strengthening in Germany.
A worst possible scenario in terms of confidence would be if the
Chancellor saw fit to lower base rates only to have to lift them again.
Any reduction has got to be sustainable and with little inflationary
niggles still on the horizon, in terms of factory gate prices, the best
option at present would seem to be to leave well alone.
The balance of opinion in the City is still that the economy is
experiencing a growth pause, possibly as a result of companies paring
back production plans to run off excess stocks.
The evidence on the economy is not overwhelming in either direction.
Third-quarter GDP figures, due out on November 20, will attract
particular attention.

IT had to come sometime. For the last five or so years, the question
was how the overcapacity in High Street banking was to be overcome.
At first sight, Lloyds' approach to the TSB is highly logical for a
variety of reasons. One is that while the latter has one of the best
capital ratios in British banking it seems to have nowhere to go for the
next year or two, particularly with its life assurance activites
continuing under a cloud.
Happily, under chief executive Peter Ellwood, TSB has recovered some
of its reputation after the disastrous series of acquisitions which
absorbed all the #1400m generated from the 1986 flotation and then some.
These included Target unit trusts and Hill Samuel which is now turning
itself from an ugly duckling into a quite a nice swan.
Mr Ellwood, who will become a deputy chief executive if the merger
succeeds, has been trying to find a building society if the appropriate
one became available at the right pride -- otherwise profits progression
in the current climate will prove very difficult.
Much the same applies to Lloyds which is the best managed of the banks
-- it has not needed balance sheet repair rights issues or funds to make
acquisitions or even fund organic growth for the last two decades.
The suggestion of returning 68p as a special dividend to TSB
sharholders as part of the consideration reflects the surplus capital
that would otherise be sloshing around the enlarged group.
The two banks say the deal is good for customers, although the
reasoning is not obvious, and for staff. Their position is even less
clear with uncertainty at the very least for the next six months or so
before the white envelopes arrive. But for shareholders -- yes it is
good.
It is now open season for bid speculation, with Abbey National an
obvious choice for a big balance sheet acquirer who would be buying what
is arguably the most soundly based of banks -- assuming house prices do
not deteriorate any further.

JAPANESE FINANCIAL SCANDAL
Tokyo, Monday -- The president and two other top executives of Japan's
Daiwa Bank resigned today in a widening scandal over concealed losses on
bond deals at the bank's US operations.
The resignations followed huge losses on unauthorised bond trades at
Daiwa's New York branch. But in new revelations, it said that another
part of its US operations, a trust banking subsidary, had covered up
losses on bond trading there.
Daiwa officials also said that several bank officials had been
involved in the original scam at the New York branch, which had at first
been blamed entirely on one former senior bond trader.
Analysts said the newly-revealed losses at the trust unit, which a
finance ministry official said were concealed from both US and Japanese
authorities until last week, will greatly upset US regulators.
They also said the resignations of Daiwa Bank president Akira Fujita
and two other top executives might be not enough to atone for the
scandals.
''Daiwa's nightmare will last for a long time . . . Daiwa is likely to
be at the centre of the restructuring in Japanese banks as they will be
forced to begin an industry-wide reshuffle due to the huge bad loans
they have,'' Yushiro Ikuyo, first vice-president of Smith Barney
International, said.
A Daiwa executive said its US trust subsidiary, Daiwa Bank Trust of
New York, posted $31m of unrealised losses in off-balance-sheet trading
in US treasury bonds in 1984 but that the losses were covered by August
1994.
The executive told reporters the bond losses at the trust unit soared
to $96m to $97m in 1987 and were transferred to a separate unit.
An analyst at a foreign securities house said there was the
possibility US regulators would take away Daiwa's banking licence in the
country.
''The Daiwa Bank Trust case was concealed for a period of about 10
years, and Daiwa Bank would have to be extremely good to explain to US
authorities why the head office did not report the irregularity,'' he
said.
The latest Daiwa news came amid growing worries about Japan's
debt-burdened financial system.
US authorities halted much of Daiwa's US business last week and
launched a probe into its trading losses. Japan's finance ministry and
central bank also launched investigations into the losses. -- Reuter.

CRITICS of management books complain that all too often, the authors
are like spectators at a football match -- long on opinion and hot air .
. . and short of practical experience.
How many of these pundits have ever pulled on the jersey? How many
have actually been in a senior management position?
Today's book was written by a premier league player with international
honours. It will be of interest to everyone who wants to see Scotland
rebuild its rightful position as a major manufacturing nation, and to
those who wonder whether there are any lessons left to be learned from
''Japanese management''.
Evaluating one of this year's most intriguing business books is Jim
Welsh (left), the Prestwick-based director and general manager of
British Aerospace Aerostructures.
PETER Wickens has been at the heart of the integration of Japanese
management practices into the Western environment.
As a successful manager in American, Japanese and UK companies -- most
notably as personnel director at the giant Nissan plant in Sunderland --
he has a valuable perspective to offer on the future of organisational
practice.
While pursuing a cogent line of argument, Mr Wickens does readers the
courtesy of reviewing all aspects of each topic. As a result his book
The Ascendant Organisation* is both stimulating and provocative -- not
every reader will agree with the conclusions reached.
With his wide experience it is interesting to note that he advocates
neither a Western nor an Eastern style of management. ''Over the past 30
years, I have come to realise that no nation has a monopoly on wisdom.''
Instead, Wickens argues for a synthesis of philosophy and practice.
He reviews the arguments for and against Japanese production systems
and provides lucid conclusions which he modestly describes as
''simplifications'', stressing that the West must not ''regard Japan as
an industrial Lourdes where a few days worshipping at the shrine will
bring about the miracle cure''.
In many ways he argues Japan is moving towards Western ideas. Control
of finances, the ability to make rapid decisions and achieve major
structural shifts, product planning and a concentration on the needs of
the individual are all highlighted as attributes of Western
organisations that the Japanese are beginning to value.
Where the best attributes of Western and Eastern management practice
come together, Mr Wickens argues that it produces an ''Ascendant
Organisation''. In such a business high levels of control of business
processes are combined with high levels of employee commitment. The
result is an organisation capable of long-term, sustainable business
success.
This then is Mr Wickens' proposition. Where the book scores heavily is
that it then goes on to provide a road map describing how to make an
organisation ''ascendant''.
In moving towards an ascendant position, Wickens stresses that ''the
old has to continue alongside the new -- it must continue to operate
effectively while change is going on around it''. He describes the
importance of organisational culture, the role of ''vision and mission''
programmes, the importance of leadership at all levels and of the
flexibility required from employees.
He sees every employee as a knowledge worker engaged in continuous
improvement in a learning organisation. The challenge is to find means
of combining people and machine to reduce drudgery and allow effective
contributions at all levels of the enterprise.
His views on team working and total quality in particular will be of
value to everyone with an interest in manufacturing.
Cell manufcturing or multi-functional task forces do not, in Mr
Wickens' experience, necessarily result in team working, nor are teams
built on the basis of an ideal mix of personality types. Real team
working results from individuals who are motivated to work together to
achieve clear and demanding goals -- for which they hold themselves
accountable.
He highlights the limitations of the total quality approaches
currently practised in the West. ''No longer does high quality give
competitive advantage. It is the entry price and therefore must be the
norm. Using acronyms such as TQM suggests it is something special. It is
not. It is the price of staying in business and therefore has to be
fully integrated into the business.
''The ascendant organisation does not speak of the cost of quality --
it speaks of the price of poor quality which is to go out of business.''
Mr Wickens' long experience in manufacturing enables him to write
authoritatively. His basis premise is that he regards Japanese and
Western contributions to operations management as distinctive sides of
the same coin. Combining these two sides leads to an edge -- the
competitive edge. A book worthy of careful and critical study which
provides a perceptive source book on the issues confronting
organisations as they seek to define their future.

The estate agent
Eric Kennedy meets a man who enjoys helping people over new thresholds
BEING an estate agent isn't all bricks, mortar and mortgages. People
come into it in a big way -- and that, says Kenneth Alves, is what makes
it worthwhile.
Alves likes people. He has even on occasion persuaded people not to
sell their homes. In the most recent case an 80yearold woman thanked him
with tears in her eyes for convincing her she should stay put in her
home of 30 years, surrounded by good and caring neighbours, rather than
give in to external pressures to sell up.
So bang goes the image of the coldhearted and grasping buyer and
seller of people's dreams.
Kenneth Alves reckons that, as property valuer with an Edinburgh
company, he is in a job which can offer a great deal of satisfaction.
''People change houses maybe five or six times in their lifetime,'' he
says, ''and yes, they need expert help and advice.''
He also reflects on the healthy competition among agents, particularly
in Edinburgh and Aberdeen. ''Sure we are rivals,'' he says, ''but we
meet socially and there's a lot of mutual respect.''
If you want to see cutthroat competition, he adds, you want to go into
insurance. That's what he did, entering the game in 1973 after leaving
Melville Academy in Edinburgh with three Highers, emerging with an HND
in Business Studies two years later after a course at the Scottish
College of Textiles in Galashiels. Then there was a sixmonth course in
industrial administration at Aston University, Birmingham.
He joined a major insurance company in London under what was basically
a graduate recruitment programme, gained practical experience in its
various departments, joined its personnel department for three years,
and became a director of a firm of Lloyds brokers in London.
That was in 1976. Three years later he moved to Glasgow as director of
another company and in 1984 he formed his own concern. He discovered,
however, that he ''wasn't any good'' at running a company. ''I didn't
enjoy it at all.''
He was casting around for a change of direction when his brother
offered him a position as property valuer with his estate agency in the
capital.
He joined in 1987, during the property boom, and found his financial
background and experience of handling clients to be great advantages in
his new profession.
These days he values four or five houses a day, and still enjoys
seeing other people's homes. ''You have to be careful,'' of course. ''A
seller might want to gild the lily a bit and that's no good. We are
abound, morally and legally, to tell the truth.''
He says youngsters could do worse than embark on an estateagency
career. There are courses run by the National Association of Estate
Agents and most large agencies have developed wellstructured internal
training programmes. And forget the wideboy image estate agents often
have in those TV sitcoms: ''That's England,'' says Alves. ''We do things
differently up here and have a better legal system.
''It doesn't pay, anyway, to mislead people. We believe honesty to be
the best policy.''

THE building societies have seen their share of merger activity
recently. This was prompted by the Lloyds Bank takeover of Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester, the UK's sixth-largest building society, for #1800m cash
last year. This led to generous cash handouts for C&amp;G deposit holders.
Then last November Britain's biggest building society, the Halifax,
announced plans to merge with the Leeds Permanent and become a limited
company.
In August this year, the Abbey National, itself a former building
society, announced it was merging with National &amp; Provincial, the
ninth-biggest society, in a deal worth #1350m.
The belief that big is beautiful appears to be the received wisdom in
many corners. Therefore we can expect more high-profile mergers, at
least another one along the lines of the Halifax/Leeds deal.
Societies that are thought to be the keenest to merge and convert
include the Birmingham Midshires, the thirteenth-largest. Of those
likely to be the smaller partner in a merger or subject to a takeover,
Britannia and Bristol &amp; West are the focus of greatest rumour.
Those seeking at least a merger are thought to include Alliance &amp;
Leicester, Britain's fourth-largest, which also wanted to merger with
the Leeds. Bradford &amp; Bingley, which is the fifth-largest is also said
to be looking for a merger, as is the Woolwich, the third-largest.
The three largest after the Halifax, the Nationwide, Woolwich and
Alliance &amp; Leicester, could convert to a bank on their own but are
thought more likely to look for a partner before heading for PLC status.
The catalyst for change at the Woolwich may come with the retirement
later this year of chief executive Donald Kirkham, a keen advocate of
mutual status. This could see the Woolwich following the Halifax route
and merging with a smaller society, possibly converting to a bank.
National Westminster Bank and HSBC, owners of Midland Bank, are
thought to be on the acquisition trail.
Those organisations on the outside who have yet to get involved in the
mergers and acquisition activity such as the Royal Bank of Scotland can
take comfort from the fact that in the latest annual building societies
performance survey published by stockbrokers UBS, three of the top five
best financial perfomers Coventry, Northern Rock and Yorkshire remain
independent mutual building societies.
The vast majority of the UK's 81 societies are too small to be prime
targets for a merger or takeover. However, up to 10 are thought to be
suitable for possible purchase but some of these have pledged to remain
independent. The history of the banking and building society industry
has up until now shows that agreed mergers are the preferred option.
It might be that the Royal Bank of Scotland, valued at #3700m and
therefore one of the smaller of the UK's banks, could become the prey
rather than the predator.
Some City analysts think there could come a time within the next five
years when a trip down a Scottish High Street would show the tangible
effects of the current merger mania.
Bank of Scotland and Lloyds are expected to remain but the The Royal
Bank and Clydesdale, currently owned by National Australia Bank, could
have disappeared in a takeover by Barclays.
The Royal Bank of Scotland, while closely monitoring developments, is
refusing to comment on bid speculation.
The Clydesdale acknowledges that if the price is right then it could
be sold by its Australian parent company, although it is currently
thought to be happy with its Glaswegian acquisition.

MARTIN Currie Pacific Trust just managed to keep ahead of its
benchmark index in the six months to August 31, helped by a recovery in
Japanese share prices.
Japan accounts for 26% of the trust's #61.3m portfolio. Its other main
investments were in Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia.
Fully diluted net asset value rose 8% to 146.3p, just managing to
outpace a 7.6% increase in the FT-A World (Pacific) index.
Earnings per share increased seven-fold to 0.81p as a result of
interest accruing on borrowed funds which had not yet been invested, but
as usual there was no interim dividend.
Borrowings amounted to 1600bn yen (#10m) at the end of August, giving
the Edinburgh-based trust a gearing ratio of 17% at present exchange
rates.
Chairman Tim Kimber said the prospects for investment in Japan looked
brighter following the recent depreciation of the yen, the easing of
Japanese interest rates and the announcement of a government spending
package to revive the economy.
''Elsewhere in the region economic growth and corporate earnings still
look superior to the rest of the world, and we look forward with some
optimism to the year ahead,'' he added.

EXAMINED in terms of electoral mandate, the switching of an MP from
one party to another without the demonstrated assent of those who
elected him is pretty dodgy in principle.
I would hope that procedures governing the behaviour of elected
representatives in a future Scottish parliament would insist that such a
translation could not happen without the member standing down and
submitting himself, in his new clothes, to the democratic judgment of
his electorate.
The present crossing over of MP Alan Howarth probably says more about
the political vacuity of the New Labour Party he is joining than it says
about the distressed Tory Party he has left.
The more cynical among us may wonder if his conversion owes more to a
desire to remain an MP at the next election than to any matter of
principle.
Hell hath no fury like the Tory politburo scorned. I wouldn't like to
be the MP for Stratford-on-Avon for the next 18 months (and no longer, I
suspect).

GOVERNMENT grants to the arts are not keeping pace with inflation.
That is the simple fact which lies behind the problem with which the
Scottish Arts Council and more importantly its clients have had to
grapple in recent years.
In these circumstances it is especially difficult for the Arts Council
to encourage innovation and new initiatives. But it must go on trying.
Indeed, had not the council in 1962 backed Sir Alex Gibson's dream of
an opera company for Scotland there would probably not have been a
Scottish Opera at all. Today's new idea is tomorrow's success story.
It is easier to show favour to some when money is plentiful, but when
it is in short supply help for one means pain for another. That is the
main reason why the Scottish Arts Council is not able to contemplate the
level of extra funding which Scottish Opera is seeking.
Earlier this year in an attempt to find some extra funds to help the
new and deserving we withdrew our grant from the Brunton Theatre in
Musselburgh.
That grant was for #53,000 and when we cancelled it we received
several hundred letters of protest, had a demonstration outside our
offices, East Lothian District Council not only protested but withdrew
its grant from the national companies in revenge for our action, and the
local MP sought an adjournment debate in the House of Commons.
The devastation and outrage which would greet a move by us to remove
grants 25 times greater than this to meet the projected deficits of
Scottish Opera and two national orchestras can only be imagined. Two
examples will suffice.
To raise the #1.25m which these three need would call for the complete
removal of our grants to the Citizens' and Lyceum Theatres, or for the
elimination of our entire literature budget. (And if you want to know
what our support for literature achieves ask James Kelman, Janice
Galloway, or the Edinburgh Book Festival.)
Throughout the last 32 years the Scottish Arts Council has been a
consistent and loyal supporter of Scottish Opera, by far the largest
recipient of Arts Council funding.
In more recent times as Government support has been virtually frozen
we have constantly warned the company that there could be no more than
token increases from council funds. Three years ago we were in favour of
the proposed merger of the opera orchestra with the BBC Scottish
Symphony Orchestra saying clearly at the time that the status quo was
not an option.
The recent report by Sir Lewis Robertson on possible collaboration
between Scottish Opera, the RSNO, and SCO seemed to us to point a new
way ahead for all three companies, and for the BBC, but Scottish Opera
chose not to investigate the proposals in more detail as Sir Lewis
proposed.
Whatever the fate of the report all concerned should be grateful to
Sir Lewis who, for no reward, devoted many days investigating all
possible collaborations between the companies concerned.
Comparisons with Welsh National Opera have been made. It is
frustrating that Scottish Opera's income is not as large as theirs but
the main advantage which they enjoy over Scottish Opera is a substantial
payment to WNO by the Arts Council of England to enable it to tour in
the West and Midlands of England, where it gives many more performances
than in Wales.
Why then can Scottish Opera not receive similar support for touring
the North of England? Because Opera North exists for that specific
purpose and is supported accordingly by the Arts Council of England.
The chairman of Scottish Opera has asked that the rules governing
expenditure of Lottery funds should be changed from their current use
for capital projects only.
There is not much doubt that in the long run a change will be made but
we must be a alive to the danger that whatever sums from the Lottery are
devoted to revenue expenditure on the arts the Treasury is likely to
deduct a similar amount from the existing grant. All the Arts Councils
in Britain are working together to find ways of loosening the Lottery
rules in such a way as to avoid such a negative outcome.
What now for Scottish Opera? The difficulties being projected for next
year and beyond are facing the company with the need to change their
ways of working in order to stay within their budget and yet deliver the
same number of opera performances to the Scottish public. The Arts
Council accepts that both will be possible within the plans submitted to
us.
Nothing would please us more than to receive more funds from the
Government, some of which would be channelled to the national companies,
who are all in financial difficulties. But until the Government can be
persuaded to make a step-change in the amount they give to the arts --
and regrettably our attempts to persuade them to have so far been
unsuccessful -- the sort of pain and anguish being experienced by
Scottish Opera will spread and multiply throughout the arts community.
As the Robertson report pointed out, although Scottish Opera's
position is the most urgent, the others are facing deficits in the very
near future, as are virtually all arts companies and artists up and down
the country.

Chairman, Scottish Arts Council,

YOU exclusively reported construction-sector disquiet with the lack of
Government support for the industry (October 6). This comes as no
surprise to those of us concerned with the consequences of national
housing policy failures.
One can draw almost parallel lines on a graph which compares rising
unemployment in the building industry with rising homelessness in the
first years of the 1990s.
Leading figures across the housing sector -- development bodies,
financiers, public sector organisations and campaigners -- are reaching
a consensual critique of a housing policy which has put all the eggs in
the owner-occupier basket.
This must change. With deep-seated social and labour-market change,
and with the flagship right-to-buy policy reaching saturation, it looks
as if the core activities of the building and financing industries are
set for further contraction.
This contraction reflects slackening demand in the housing market, but
the level of outstanding need -- from both homelessness and appalling
housing conditions -- is still enormous.
There is a unique opportunity to turn the critique into a positive
agenda. Many people in both lending and building industries will, in the
run-up to November's Budget, call for short-term quick fix responses to
stimulate the housing market.
Restoration of MIRAS at higher rates is one favoured option. But these
calls ignore the greater need to re-invent imaginative programmes of
public sector-led investment, providing affordable homes, sustaining
quality jobs, and servicing a prosperous economy.
Shelter has set out just such a programme. We believe that it is in
the interests of the unemployed building worker just as much as of the
homeless person that organisations join together and push the case for
investment to the top of the public policy agenda.

Dance
CANINE fever swept through the Theatre Royal last night. Sheepdogs,
when you whistle, come to heel. Hordes of wolf-whistling women brought
only a smile, a knowing look, and yet another stamp of the steel-soled
boot from Tap Dogs. This was like the Tappendales, bringing out the
puppy instinct in women.
At the Edinburgh Festival the female arts staff of The Herald were
reduced to slavering incoherence; they couldn't even say the name
without drooling. Ergo the presence last night of a writer with an
altogether more rational perspective.
Tap Dogs; heavy metal tap. Six guys from Oz, dressed like navvies,
shod like Clydesdales, kicking, crashing, stamping, and -- above all --
thunderously tap dancing: raw, ear-numbing, shipyard choreography. They
dance on wood, on metal, on stepladders, on electronic drum pads. If it
doesn't move it can be danced on; if it does, like the cantilevered
girders of their set, then they run at it and dance on it anyway.
They do it standing up, they do it sitting down. They even do it at 45
degrees. They dance on water and one of them -- I won't spoil the effect
by describing it -- dances on the ceiling.
Some of the sequences are dazzling -- the funniest is at the beginning
when all but the feet are concealed beind a metal screen, establishing
that these dogs don't need to cock a leg. Choreography is as tight as a
well-tied bootlace -- from the Mexican wave of rhythm that sweeps along
the line to the supercool dance accompanied by hypnotic Balinese-style
percussion.
Tap Dogs? The hottest ticket in town. You'll be barking to miss it.

<HEADLINE>Rush is on for Howarth seat. Tory agent predicts leading MPs could join list of 300 candidates</HEADLINE>

STRATFORD-ON-AVON Conservative Association is bracing itself for a
flood of applications from would-be MPs eager to land a safe seat.
Agent Peter Smith predicts there could be as many as 300 CVs arriving
on the party's doorstep after MR Alan Howarth's defection to Labour.
The seat -- the 17th safest in the country -- is an attractive
proposition for Tory MPs whose own seats disappear under boundary
changes at the next election or those on the so-called ''chicken run''
from areas set to fall to the Opposition.
Potential candidates -- who can be anyone on the party's approved list
-- include former Chancellor Norman Lamont, whose Kingston Upon Thames
constituency is set to disappear.
The Stratford party is hoping to get the selection process under way
swiftly, with a new candidate chosen by Christmas.
Mr Smith says it will involve sorting through 200--300 CVs,
interviewing around 25, whittling the figure down to seven who will
appear before the executive council of representatives from all branches
in the constituency, and then cutting it down to three.
The final trio will appear before a special general meeting of as many
of the 5000 party members who wish to attend.
Mr Smith said the party membership has changed significantly since Mr
Alan Howarth was selected more than a decade ago so it was impossible to
tell what sort of candidate they would go for.
But he stressed: ''It's a very loyal party. The constituency is about
160 years old and they know it. They are staunch, supportive and very
conscious of the position they hold.''
Party members are likely to look for a candidate whose interests match
the seat, so an interest in agriculture and small business would be an
advantage.
With such a choice of candidates they can afford to be picky and could
opt for a younger person aged 30-40 who would be around for a while, and
might prefer someone who is married.
They will also take into account whether they want a high flier who
may be promoted up the ministerial ladder with all the attendant
glamour, or someone who is going to be first and foremost a good
constituency MP.
Meanwhile in the rival camp yesterday the local Labour party was
overwhelmed by the flood of publicity but said they had not yet chosen a
candidate for the next election and could not rule out Mr Howarth.
Labour yesterday put out the welcome mat to Tory waverers after the
defection of Mr Howarth at the weekend.
Shadow Environment Secretary Frank Dobson arrived in Blackpool on the
eve of the Conservative Party conference and declared: ''It's welcome
aboard time. All we need is another two or three Tory MPs and if we can
get a defector a week we will.
''It's open house to all Tories. We have membership forms for the
Labour Party here and they're invited to fill them in.
''We may have to vet Cabinet ministers more closely than other
delegates, but I say to any Conservative who wants to wander down the
promenade, I am here,'' said Mr Dobson at his hotel overlooking the
Irish Sea.
Other members of Labour's front bench team plan to visit Blackpool
this week after Mr Howarth's switch to Labour.
The decision by the Stratford-upon-Avon MP to join Mr Tony Blair's New
Labour Party because he believes it has a more caring agenda, has
stunned Tories gathering in the Lancashire resort.
Many believe his behaviour is nothing short of treacherous, but Mr
Howarth says his views are shared by around 30 other Tory MPs.
Former Tory Cabinet minister Norman Fowler last night dismissed claims
that up to 40 Tory MPs share Mr Howarth's feelings about Tory policies.
''I think that is nonsense, I don't think there is any basis for a
belief of that kind or any objective evidence.
''It is just a two-to-three day wonder that will not overshadow the
conference. To read into it that there is some kind of malaise in the
Conservative Party is nonsensical.''
Lady Doreen Miller of London constituencies said Tory Central Office
was ''daft to let Alan Howarth in in the first place if he originally
supported Labour''.
''I am sure he is genuine in what he thinks but he is 100% wrong,''
she added.
Mr David Bradbury of Dulwich and West Norwood constituency said: ''I
don't think it will put a blight on the conference. If Alan Howarth has
let anyone down it's the people in Stratford-upon-Avon who thought they
were voting for a Conservative MP.
''As far as support for the Tories goes, we have had one of the
strongest recruiting summers ever in our part of south London so support
is holding up,'' he added.
Meanwhile, Mr Howarth yesterday hit back at party critics who
questioned his mental state after his decision to join Labour.
The 51-year-old MP brushed aside suggestions he was suffering from a
mid-life crisis and accused Education Secretary Gillian Shephard of
lowering the tone of the debate with her ''silly'' abuse.
Mr Howarth found himself subjected to a torrent of criticism from
ministers and other senior party figures after he declared he was
leaving the Tories on the eve of their party conference in Blackpool.
Prime Minister John Major said his decision was ''a mistake'', party
chairman Brian Mawhinney said it was ''bizarre'' while former minister
Alan Clark said the MP was ''batty'' and had committed ''an act of
complete treachery''.
Mrs Shephard was particularly outspoken suggesting that Mr Howarth was
a man in turmoil and accusing him of ''vindictiveness'' in announcing
his move just before the conference.
Mr Howarth, however, at his farmhouse home in south Warwickshire,
warned that such attacks could rebound on his critics.
''What I find regrettable is the somewhat waspish tone taken by
Gillian Shephard. I was sorry that she chose to attack me in the terms
that she did,'' he said.
''That was lowering the terms of the debate. I think it is very unwise
for the Government to try and slag me off. It may be counter-productive.
''People will have to form their own judgment. I think her comments
are silly and unfortunate. The Secretary of State for Education should
not make such abuse. She is supposed to set a good example to the boys
and girls.''
He admitted that when he spoke on Sunday by telephone to the Prime
Minister, Mr Major had described him as a ''nuisance''.
For the party high command there was some relief today with no sign
that other centre-left, One Nation Tories were prepared to follow Mr
Howarth's lead, despite his claim that up to 40 MPs shared his concerns.
Peter Luff, MP for the neighbouring Worcester constituency, wrote to
him urging him to re-think his decision.
Mr George Walden, the centre-left MP for Buckingham who has made no
secret of his dissatisfaction with the direction of Government policy,
also made clear that he would not consider joining Labour.
Mr Howarth's defection cut the Government's effective Commons majority
to seven -- or just five if Tory Euro-rebel Sir Richard Body, who has
yet to regain the party whip although he normally votes with the
Government, is counted with the Opposition.
The Ulster Unionists, whose nine votes could be crucial in a tight
debate, made clear that they would not change their tactics because of
the Government's difficulties.
Former Prime Minister Sir Edward Heath urged fellow One Nation Tories
not to join Mr Howarth but to stay and fight for what they believed in.

Tap Dogs have rhythm in their soles, as Mary Brennan describes
SOME angels have wings. Some angels have dirty faces. Herald Angels
Tap Dogs have rhythm in their soles. If clouds really did have a silver
lining, be sure that Tap Dogs would be in their element; metal under
boot makes such a satisfying outburst. Especially when the boots are
Blundstones and the metal is a lump of girder.
Angels -- you'll remember -- are the Herald's Edinburgh Festival
awards that recognise excellence across the board. Male colleagues have
iffily suggested that this particular award recognised something else --
the show has, after all, been labelled ''testosterone tap''. In fact the
second time I was there, the loudest whoopin' and hollerin' came from an
elderly man on my right.
Old enough to remember tap before Astaire took the steps uptown and
upmarket, this chap was utterly euphoric. What these Aussies had done
was take the dance back off the boulevard and on to the street corner,
where it hustled nickels and dimes -- though, actually, they had taken
it on to a construction site in order to make it rawer. The fact that it
appeals not just to young audiences, or to women alone -- no they are
not simply the thinking woman's Chippendales -- but also to men of all
ages makes the company's originator, Dein Perry, look serious for a
moment.
This, I should say, is quite an achievement. My chat with the team of
six was full of joshing and tomfoolery -- spiked, perhaps, by the fact
that partying in some quarters had gone on till 7am (well, it was the
end of the Festival) and some folk were having trouble doing joined-up
thinking. For Perry, however, the act of making tap so universally
popular -- bringing it into the nineties -- is something that goes
beyond all the joking that kicks around offstage and on. He never really
comes out and says what it is that drives him to dance in this fashion,
only that he misses it when it isn't there. It wasn't there for the
latter part of his teens. He has, very much, created the niche and then
filled it -- before making a successful career in tap dancing, he had
earned a crust as a fitter and turner.
The other members of the team have all dabbled in other careers, too
-- they joke that they all met up in the unemployment queue. Actually,
Perry had a little black book that listed all the hoofers in the
neighbourhood. His jibe is that this lot were the ones left over after
he'd cast Hot Shoe Shuffle (winner of a 1995 Olivier award for
choreography). It doesn't really matter -- they get their own back. A
little trouble with his knees and they have promptly christened him
''Gerry-Perry'' as in geriatric.
Darren Disney is also keen to point out that though they grew up
together, Perry's older! Onstage, this kind of lads-own needle match
translates into zappy, sassy dance that very much evokes the kind of
dance you used to find when groups of men were gathered together --
mining camps, say, or those street corners again. It's a way of stating
your masculinity by coming to blows with the ground, not some other
guy's jaw. It allows you to strut your strength and show off your sense
of humour -- and, if you are Darren Disney, your rippling thigh muscles
and your pecs.
Women I've spoken to have certainly said they find the show incredibly
sexy -- yet there's no obvious flaunting in the manner of Take That.
What you get is lads at play. At play, so successfully, that they have
already been booked for a West End season at London's Lyric Theatre in
the spring.
Glasgow audiences, meanwhile, can see what has sent the superlatives
flying -- as well as that Angel which has winged its way to them -- at
the Theatre Royal this week. Wannabees should affect checked workshirts,
worn dungies or denims, and those crunchingly robust workboots -- but
I'm afraid the technique takes years to achieve and, yes, it still aches
at the end of the day.
* Tap Dogs is at the Theatre Royal tonight and tomorrow.

HOW far would you go to please someone else? And if you changed your
name, your hairstyle, your way of thinking, maybe even your gender --
where would you be in all this? It was playing around with ideas like
this that resulted in Motionhouse Dance Theatre Company's latest piece,
Geisha which is at the MacRobert Arts Centre in Stirling tonight.
''We all do it,'' says Kevin Finnan, one of the company's two
collaborating choreographers. ''We go into some bar after a show we've
really enjoyed, start chatting to someone we like the look of, they say
they thought the acting was dreadful and the next thing you know, you're
altering ground. Just because you want to please them and want them to
like you. That process really fascinated us.''
These are dark waters to go paddling about in but Motionhouse have
deliberately kept the piece lighthearted as well as visually striking.
''We decided to make a journey into this area of identity, to look at
the roles we all play and particularly the gender aspect. We're raising
questions, yes, but they are there for the audience to answer to their
own satisfaction.''
Calling the piece Geisha came about because theirs is a profession
based on the art of pleasing. They spend years training in the social
skills -- everything from making conversation to making tea -- so as to
become ''the ideal companion''.
Finnan senses there is an unsettled confusion in society as to what we
ought to be. ''Identity centres completely on the body. It's how you
look, what you wear, that makes the statement about who you are. But
then you open a magazine and there are all these androgenous models
advertising perfumes.''
On stage these confusions and roles are played out against another of
Motionhouse's brilliant sets -- they have a well-earned reputation for
design surprises. This time it's over-sized furniture. A chez-longue, a
fridge, and a screen -- summing up, rather, the essentials of life.
Geisha is crammed with movement that ranges from the sensuous to the
all-out physical, resulting from the choreographic collaboration between
Finnan and Louise Richards that has shaped Motionhouse's own identity.
This year is the company's 20th birthday and this MacRobert showing,
their only one in Scotland, points up the fact that they have rarely
performed in central Scotland. Maybe that will change with their next
work, a collaboration with writer A L Kennedy. That particular show will
tour in early 96.
I wondered if all this working around the central question ''Do you
like me like this?'' had produced a polite and supportive company, all
very sure of who they were. Finnan laughs. ''It has, to a certain
extent, crisped up our ideas on identity. But in the end I think
identity remains a very fluid thing. It's subtly changing all the
time.'' A case of if the basque fits . . . or possibly secrets under the
kimono.
* Motionhouse aim to please audiences at the MacRobert tonight, the
show starts at 7.30pm.

THE Edinburgh Contemporary Arts Trust launched their winter season by
stretching a point a little. The group billed as the Philharmonia
Orchestra was actually a chamber group drawn from the ranks of the
orchestra, with a brass and saxophone instrumental line-up in the style
of the Dutch ensemble Orchestra de Volharding, under the direction of
Scottish composer James MacMillan.
Following a fanfare for three trumpets by Britten, MacMillan explained
that the idea behind the rest of the concert was to explore contemporary
works which existed on the periphery of various mainstreams, with three
of his own solo piano pieces as ''palate-cleansers'' between the more
substantial ensemble works.
That notion worked well in what was a carefully constructed programme.
The ethereal piano piece, Angel, which relies on silence almost as much
as sound, provided a stark contrast to the works it divided in the
opening half, Julia Wolfe's starkly staccato, menacing Arsenal of
Democracy and Gerald Barry's Hard D, which made increasingly outrageous
use of instrumental voicings and textures while maintaining a folk-like
melodic directness.
MacMillan's trio piece Intercession (in a new version for saxophones)
echoed the Britten fanfare at the start of the second half, albeit in a
very different idiom, while his Cecilian Variation for JFK provided a
more pungent bridge to the gentle, unresolved mysteries of Gordon
McPherson's The Bliss of Sexual Ignorance.
Having reversed the polarities in this way, MacMillan then did so
again, with his tongue-in-cheek but very pretty fusion of Burns and
Satie, Barncleupedie, providing a moment of calm before the typically
thunderous, muscular juggernaut of Steve Martland's exhilarating
Shoulder to Shoulder.

Mark Fisher hopes that when the European Season of Mask and Puppet
Theatre opens at the weekend, it will shake up a few preconceptions
WE'VE got a problem with puppets in this country. It strikes me as odd
that even though our most enterprising companies have gone out of their
way to integrate a diverse range of disciplines into their theatrical
wholes, not one of them has so much as begun to consider the potential
of puppetry. TAG has used dancers, Communicado visual artists, the Tron
on-stage musicians, Boilerhouse novelists, NVA has even used crane
drivers and their cranes, but no-one to my knowledge has ever used a
puppeteer.
I don't suggest anyone should use puppets just for the sake of it, but
for as long as this rich and fascinating tradition is not even thought
of as an option, Scottish theatre will be like an agile athlete who
chooses for no good reason never to make use of his right leg. And I say
this as much as anything because puppets, by their very inanimate,
make-believe nature, demand the most direct form of theatricality. An
audience cannot be lulled into a naturalistic stupor but must agree to
suspend its disbelief, use its imagination, share in the magic. If it
doesn't, the performance is nothing.
Children, of course, have no problem with this. Tell them a lump of
wood is an ogre, and it's an ogre. Perhaps for this reason -- that is,
the kids understand and the grown-ups don't -- puppetry for children is
a great unrecognised popular art form in Scotland, playing to audiences
far bigger than many respected adult theatre companies could hope for.
But because of the low status that we grant our children, puppet
theatre takes a marginalised place in the performance spectrum, not only
under-resourced but also badly positioned for the kind of
cross-fertilisation that would benefit both adult and children's
theatre.
At this point, definitions come into play. Our limited exposure to
puppetry -- Punch and Judy, Sooty and Sweep, Thunderbirds -- tends to
limit our expectations of what it could be. And all puppetry is not
Kermit the Frog, any more than all physical theatre is Marcel Marceau.
The Edinburgh Festival has been a major influence in shifting such
perceptions (though to what effect is unclear) by presenting work from
those countries abroad that accept puppetry -- or object theatre as it
is sometimes known -- as a legitimate theatrical form. The big-scale
performances of France's Philippe Genty a few years ago were a
high-profile example, but I'm thinking also of the Polish company
Wierszalin which has played at Theatre Workshop for three consecutive
years.
Wierszalin's performances are fascinating for many reasons -- the
choral singing, the ever-present ensemble, the Catholic iconography --
but one of them is the seamless integration of rough-cut, chunky wooden
figures which, despite their lack of plasticity, are characters who play
as significant a part as the human actors. In one show -- Roll a Pea --
they were the central protagonists, in another -- this year's The Curse
-- they were more peripheral, and in both instances they blended into
the performance with a casual ease.
And still I haven't touched on the variety that the blanket term
''puppetry'' so quickly smothers. There are the Vietnamese water puppets
I saw in Poland earlier this year, dragons and fish emerging from the
depths of an indoor swimming pool controlled by unseen manipulators.
Then there are large-scale creations requiring several operators, like
the Japanese bunraku or the radical street theatre figures built by New
York's Bread and Puppet Theatre particularly prominent during the
anti-Vietnam War protests. In 1862, someone called Henry Monnier even
opened a pornographic puppet theatre.
In short, the limits are only as narrow as your imagination. So it is
to be hoped that when Theatre of Story/Theatre of Dreams, otherwise
known as the European Season of Mask and Puppet Theatre, opens at the
weekend, it will shake up a few preconceptions. The season, which runs
for a fortnight in Aberdeen, Edinburgh, and Glasgow, is certainly
catering for children, as is only right, but half of its 12 productions
drawn from 10 countries are being pitched at an adult audience.
''I haven't particularly set out to prove that this is an adult
medium,'' says Donald Smith, director of the festival, which is being
mounted as a one-off and will not replace the Edinburgh-based Puppet and
Animation Festival. ''I'm presenting all kinds of work because I'm
exploring a cross-cultural thing across Europe. There are traditions
which are like the Danish, where puppet theatre is very high-quality
children's theatre, or like the Italian, where it's for a family
audience, or the French, where it is part of the adult theatre market.
''The purpose of the festival is much more deep than saying, 'Hey, you
can have an adult puppet show'. It's what you can do with puppetry.''
Showcasing productions from Italy, Spain, Romania, the Netherlands,
Greece, Denmark, France, Ireland, England, and Scotland, Theatre of
Story/Theatre of Dreams will crop up in Edinburgh at the Netherbow, the
Church Hill and Theatre Workshop, in Glasgow at the Cottier, the
Mitchell and the Scottish Mask and Puppet Centre, and as part of the
Aberdeen Alternative Festival at the Lemon Tree and the Aberdeen Arts
Centre.
Performances range from a Danish production, The Rainbow Show,
suitable for children from 18 months' old, to a Spanish version of Don
Quixote and a Kafkaesque piece of French surrealism.
''What I'd like to do is not to change perceptions but to broaden
them,'' says Smith. ''There's a stigma in Scotland about puppet theatre.
It's that thing: 'It's kids, it's popular, it's low status'. The
subsidised sector is quite sniffy about it. So I think the festival
should be eye-opening and say, 'What's the European situation, and are
we as a country part of Europe?' ''
If you still have any doubts, there are many great names who have
spoken out for puppetry in the past. Both George Bernard Shaw and
Maurice Maeterlinck wrote plays for puppets, while the celebrated
designer Gordon Craig wrote that ''in the puppet we have all those
elements necessary to interpretation and in the puppet stage every
element necessary to a creative and fine art''.
And in my copy of the Theatre of Story/Theatre of Dreams programme I
find a scribbled note from Donald Smith -- a quote from the German
playwright Heinrich von Kleist: ''Can I bring you to believe that there
could be more grace in a jointed marionette than in the form of the
human body?'' Smith, for one, thinks he can.

The report of the Commission on Scottish Educationis being timed to
concentrate party minds, says its secretary DICK LOUDEN, as he overviews
its progress
IT is a year since the Commission set about its task of examining the
Scottish system of education and training. In that time we have sought
and received submissions from a wide range of organisations and have
held meetings with some of them to supplement their written evidence.
We have found these meetings highly revealing and informative and the
views expressed on these occasions will certainly help to shape our
final report.
It remains our intention to publish that report during the first half
of next year. We make no apology for stating that such a timescale would
suit our purposes admirably. Far too often, worthy reports -- unless
initiated by the Government -- receive too little in the way of official
attention because the timing of their publication (eg, in the year
following a general election) is such that there is no real pressure on
politicians to react positively to them.
On the assumption that the next general election will not occur before
the autumn of 1996 -- admittedly, a slightly risky assumption with the
Government's majority now down to single figures -- our intended
strategy is to place our report before all political parties and to seek
their public reaction and commitment at a time when they will have to
''come clean'' about their educational policies in the run-up to the
election.
We cannot think of a better time at which to apply pressure on the
various parties. Writing on a personal basis, I have already expressed
concern about what seems to me to be the lack of distinctiveness of New
Labour's approach to Scottish education. It really must be made to come
out with much clearer statements of its policy intentions.
Similarly, the Government will have to be forced to break cover since
our parent body, the UK-wide National Commission on Education, has seen
its recommendations ignored to an unjustifiable extent, partly because
its visionary report, Learning to Succeed, was published in November
1993, too early in the lifetime of the present Parliament.
The SNP will also be invited to clarify where it stands -- the mass of
the population is not exactly familiar with the SNP's educational
policies.
However, if we hope to apply pressure on the political parties, we
shall have to ensure first that our report is of such quality as to
command credibility. Though our commissioners are people of some
eminence in the world of education and business, we do not intend to
expose ourselves to the criticism that we have operated from an ivory
tower.
It is with this in mind that we have not only consulted widely already
but also held numerous follow-up meetings to ensure that we are fully
aware of professional, parental and public opinion.
This process is not yet complete and we shall continue to take further
soundings during the period, about to begin, when we are debating among
ourselves the nature of our report.
We shall also, in that report, quote frequently from the submissions
we have received -- many of which have made a vivid impression on us --
so that it will be apparent to the reader that we have not been creating
new approaches in a vacuum but rather distilling the best of current
practice and imaginative forward thinking and giving it a clear policy
focus.
Our final report will be nearer to booklet than blockbuster size. This
is not simply because we lack the resources, in finance and personnel,
of the National Commission -- Learning to Succeed ran to 480 pages --
but also because we believe that if our publication is of readable
proportions, it is more likely to be read.
In addition, our remit is to identify and examine specifically
Scottish issues of education and training and not to re-invent the wheel
of Learning to Succeed.
Though we are still considering the structure of our report, we have
already decided on some generic headings around which it will be built.
These are: Scotland as a learning society, the early years, school
effectiveness and ethos, courses and qualifications at 16-18, further
and higher education, accountability and governance.
Our timescale will enable us to take account of the latest
developments such as the delay to the implementation of Higher Still,
the merger of the SEB and Scotvec and the results of the new
consultative process on nursery vouchers.
None of this should be taken as implying any deep dissatisfaction on
the Commission's part with the Scottish educational system. On the
contrary, we share the view of the National Commission that Scotland is,
by and large, well served. However, every system needs to be kept under
constant review so that priorities for development can be identified.
That is how we see our task.

What are schools around the world doing to prepare their pupils for
good citizenship? Alexander McKenzie reports
ONCE their lessons are over for the day Japanese pupils are expected
to help clean their schools. For about 30 minutes desks are tidied,
floors are swept and windows are washed. Groups of pupils are also sent
to tidy up the playgrounds, weed the gardens and, in some areas, sweep
neighbouring streets.
As well as promoting tidiness and self-discipline, the ''clean your
own school'' programme also seeks to discourage young Japanese from
developing a disdain for menial work.
Their social development is further assisted by formal lessons on
ethics and good citizenship. About 50 minutes a week is devoted to
''dotoku'', the lessons on moral education based on detailed syllabuses
drawn up by the Ministry of Education in Tokyo.
Other countries in East Asia have developed similar programmes in an
attempt to instil good habits and encourage diligence, perserverance,
and responsibility. Elementary school pupils in South Korea receive up
to two hours of lessons on moral education a week while high school
pupils are obliged to complete a mandatory course on national ethics.
At a recent education conference in Kuala Lumpur several speakers
emphasised the importance of moral education programmes in East Asian
schools. Education's contribution to the development of young people's
self-discipline and sense of responsibility, one speaker declared, had
been crucial to the region's impressive standards of educational
attainment.
With the economies of East Asia expanding rapidly, educators and
politicians in countries such as South Korea and Taiwan want to avoid
the sort of decline in moral standards which they say has accompanied
economic advancement in the United States and other western countries.
''If western values are adopted,'' Lee Kuan Yew, the former prime
minister of Singapore said recently, ''cohesion will be threatened and
the country will go downhill.''
Teachers in Russia are also looking at ways of improving moral
standards among the nation's young people. Some teachers attribute what
they describe as a decline in the behaviour and attitudes of young
Russians to the demise of the traditional values education programmes
which had promoted the Communist principles of comradeship, equality,
loyalty, duty and responsibility.
''Today's children lack the discipline and moral fibre of their
forebears,'' one parent wrote in a national newspaper. ''There is a need
for schools to promote a new moral code.''
But other Russian teachers question whether compulsory ''civics''
courses, particularly those loaded with Communist Party dogma, really
worked. Younger teachers in particular now prefer more general social
studies and humanities-type programmes which enable teachers and
students to discuss moral and ethical issues.
Freedom of thought and individual responsibility are also being
encouraged in the other former Communist states of Eastern Europe. In
spite of the problems of struggling economies, and the changing nature
of their societies, schools in the former Communist bloc are seeking to
encourage new moral codes and civic responsibilities.
American schools, meanwhile, are seeking to improve moral standards by
introducing new courses on ethics and values. Although American
education already promotes the national ideals of individual freedom and
responsibility, many state education authorities are introducing more
specific programmes to counter the growing problems of juvenile
delinquency and drug addiction.
But not all countries agree that values in education, social education
or moral education are the responsibility of schools. Countries like
Germany, France and Italy have a much narrower view of education with
the resources of schools being almost entirely devoted to academic
matters rather than character-building or promoting civic
responsibilities.
In Scotland, however, moral and religious education has been decreed
sufficiently relevant to be treated as a separate mode in the 5-14
curriculum. Scottish pupils are expected to study moral principles such
as justice, tolerance and equality in compulsory subjects like religious
education.
Other European countries are also examining ways in which schools can
help foster the personal, social and moral development of pupils. But
practical activities are not so popular in the West. When some schools
in Germany recently tried to introduce a Japanese-style school clean-up
programme there was opposition from pupils and parents.
Young people had nothing to gain from cleaning their schools, they
said.

Theatre
HIDDEN away in the darker recesses of Ladbroke Grove the Royal Court's
Young People's Theatre are seldom seen by the public unless something
like this joint Nigerian/British venture (under the umbrella of the
Africa '95 festival) beckons them into the light.
As such, it's a triumph of cultural collaboration.
Adapted by Bode Sowande from a novel by the grand old man of Nigerian
literature, Amos Tutuola, it's a delightfully vibrant piece of
story-telling theatre employing traditional Nigerian songs and drumming
and a cast of nearly 30 mixed culture young people who play narrators
and a host of weirdly wonderful ghosts and animal spirits including such
things as a Smelling Ghost, a hydra-headed monster called the Flash-Eyed
Mother, and one fabulous creation -- Super Lady.
My Life seems childlike and innocent in its style. In fact it hides
some remarkably radical political and sexual views in its story of a
young boy who gets separated by war from his family, undergoes a whole
range of adventures before returning to his starting point and his
village an older, wiser person.
Given the turbulent political times through which Nigeria is passing,
it also contains a wonderfully well-disguised little homily about
''ethnicity''.

Bonn
TENNIS star Steffi Graf is in danger of losing a $1m sponsorship
contract, one of the biggest in German sport, after the much-publicised
investigation into her tax affairs.
The German car company Opel, which has backed Graf for 10 years, said
it was concerned about the management of the Wimbledon champion, who was
questioned for the first time last week by public prosecutors about her
tax affairs.
German newspapers have been buzzing with reports on the tax
investigation for months. One magazine alleged at the weekend that Graf
might be arrested in connection with the affair.
However Mannheim chief public prosecutor Peter Wechsung said today:
''We have no plans to order an arrest warrant (for Steffi Graf). I want
to make that quite clear.''
Such sentiments seem unlikely to impress sponsors Opel. Company
official Klaus Mauer said: ''The way things stand today, I could not
imagine that there will be a new contract at the end of the year.
''We are not questioning the personal integrity of Steffi Graf. But
there are worries about her management and the team around her . . .
There are ups and downs in a (business) relationship and loyalty -- but
to a certain point.''
Graf, 26, whose father Peter was jailed in August to stop him fleeing
or concealing evidence that might support accusations he and his
daughter evaded taxes, is estimated to earn around around DM1.5m
(#700,600) per year from the deal.--Reuter.

TRAVELLERS to France should never forget the accepted French
definition of justifiable murder: a chef who throttles a customer for
scattering salt into the Potage du Jour before having taken the trouble
to taste it. But today there are other sins causing blood pressure to
rise in French restaurants.
More than half the eating places of Paris are now foreign
establishments, which means native chefs are threatened not so much by
the ignorant palate as by the promiscuous one. Sushi, tagine, chicken
tandoori, tiramisu . . . these are the favourite dishes that are causing
French restaurant critics to swallow the usual chauvinism and concede
that exoticism, allied to faster service and lower prices, is a winning
ingredient.
Today in the fiendishly expensive Paris of President Chirac's nouveau
regime one reviewer plaintively observes that: ''It is time to realise
that we are not the only people to know how to cook well. We might even
learn something from the invaders.'' Such an admission may be a symptom
of France's unhappy plight.
This morning's proposed general strike mocks a President who, in his
electon campaign, promised the world but so far has only delivered the
world's reproach for his nuclear tests. Meanwhile crime, taxes, job
losses, and terrorism rise. Chirac, so virile abroad, seems impotent at
home, and now even the glory days of the baguette appear to be over as
French bakeries cut costs and mimic the latex mattress quality of the
worst British loaf.
In times of misfortune the French brasserie always used to be a
paradise amid mayhem. But today the undemanding tastiness of its loaded
platters finds little space in catering's international vision. This is
also the decade of theatrical cuisine, where diners squeal in rapture
over costly less-is-more pretensions and the sight of a prawn
masquerading as a rosebud.
These are the High Nibblers whose self-regarding chatter about their
well-toned lives actually prevents any enthusiasm for eating. So they
simply push the food reverentially around the plate, leaving more behind
than they consume, their choice of dish becoming a nonsensical fashion
statement, something to be seen with rather than taken internally.
True Trenchers, on the other hand, exhibit a real appreciation of
every kind of cooking, but the High Nibblers, in fact, display a fear of
it. They may be ruthless movers and shakers in their own worlds but they
are cowardly when it comes to looking eggs, cream or butter in the eye.
High Nibblers hide their dairy intake in desserts.
But out on the street of almost every western country, the spartan
nutritionist is losing out. Their influence began suitably with
breakfast television where they assaulted commuters with evidence that
cluggy bread deadens the brain and monosodium glutamate rots the guts.
Thus cursed, the wretched commuter skipped lunch and snacked on the hoof
because that way he fooled himself he was burning off excess calories,
and, anyway, grazing from a paper bag made him look like an ''overdog''
in a hurry.
However, now that job insecurity, more than diet, is the cause of bad
digestion the commuter everywhere is retreating into the comfort of
stodge. In Glasgow you can hardly hear yourself crunching a radicchio
salad for cries of: ''And a large portion of chips with the hash
browns.''
Forget alfalfa sprouts, then. Forget plain yoghurt and the ascetic
apple. Some of the sandwiches on sale here these days match America's
Hero dimensions, but obviously they are not too large to get a mouth
around, for this week one more health report warns that Britain is once
again consuming too much fat and sugar for personal and national good.
Yet just when you think the diet is dead a postcard arrives from a
Parisian friend. ''Let me know when you are next in town and we can
lunch and talk. We don't have to eat.'' Things are obviously unravelling
fast in Chirac's Paris.
And sitting here we can imagine the scene: she bites on an
anti-cholesterol tablet while drinking Badoit, and refuses wine because
of a sudden antipathy to sulphates. As we dig into carre d'angueau, she
peels a banana and utters just one word, potassium, between her urgent
chewing.
How can anyone become excited about a food regimen designed to do the
most for every part of the body except the tip of the tongue? Our friend
might just as well join the street performers outside the Beaubourg, and
chomp razor blades for a living.

GENDER equality: that's the political fad of the hour, vital for a
Scottish parliament, too long absent from the House of Commons, and in
that absence a disgrace to democracy and civilisation as we know it.
Gender equality, you know, is a Good Thing: you know this, because
everyone now says it is. And massed gatherings of the great and good now
propose, with all the force of law, reform to public institutions to
ensure gender equality is soon achieved.
It has long since been agreed, by the negotiating parties in the
Constitutional Convention, that Scotland's devolved parliament must have
gender equality. What no-one has yet explained, to my satisfaction, is
why gender equality is essential and why its absence has been a stain on
our culture. And I have certainly not been convinced that the
consequences have been so serious we must now enforce equal male-female
representation by manipulating the law.
There is an arrogance here I find profoundly irritating. Without
bothering to explain themselves, or to justify some decidedly
anti-democratic proposals, the forces of the left are forcing gender
equality upon us because they have decided it is a Good Thing and we
must have it.
Here are some good reasons why they are wrong, and why such draconian
measures are both unnecessary and dangerous.
First, the absence of gender equality in Parliament, and in most
elected public institutions, is happenstance. It is not conspiracy.
There is no law, or institutional barrier, keeping women down. For 60
years men and women have been free to vote, and to stand for public
election, on precisely equal terms.
We have, in truth, fewer female representatives because fewer women
than men are active in politics, and of these women a smaller proportion
actually seek elective office. In short, there is no crime here, no sin,
no enshrined prejudice in our institutions and proceedings. So
aggressive, statutory action to enforce gender equality is destabilising
and stupid.
Secondly, it is not hard to find a chauvinist, bigoted logic behind
this drive for parity. An astonishing number of clever, sophisticated
people now accept, as common truth, that men are being caring, tolerant,
and wise. ''I'm so ashamed to be a man,'' burbled Tony Blair in 1992,
''because men cause most of the wrong in the world.''
This is nonsense. History abounds with vicious, dangerous women --
Mary Tudor, Catherine the Great -- who used power to evil ends. Men --
by virtue of greater physical strength -- may do most of the killing in
Ulster, Bosnia or Algeria, but the prejudice and hatred that drives such
ethnic atrocity is imbibed at their mothers' knees. The idea that a
parliament with equal male and female representation will usher in a new
civilised order is a delusion.
Thirdly, is it not profoundly insulting to women themselves, if we
must adjust our institutions to make sure they can be elected in
sufficient numbers? I should have thought it the height of feminist
logic to insist on men and women fighting elections on equal terms. To
seek a free leg-up from the system is an admission of weakness -- an
admission, perhaps, that few women can win election on their merits? Or
that women are no match for men? We are not, surely, to believe this;
but such is the inescapable logic of these gymnastics.
Fourthly, if our lack of parity is happenstance, born simply from
minority female involvement in politics, what will happen if we enforce
equality that elects a disproportionate swathe of these politically
active women? We will not, in fact, gain a parliament typical of the
population at large. Few of these women will be mothers, fewer than
average will be married, and a disproportionate number will be
aggressive feminists -- even more so, if most of them arrive because
they topped the approved lists of left-wing parties. These will come
with an aggressive feminist agenda -- pursuing policies on abortion,
censorship, child-care, education, criminology, and so on that has not,
in fact, sufficient breadth of public support.
Now I have no objection to aggressive feminists standing in free
elections with aggressive feminist views: they have every right to
express such views and policies as they please, and the voters may elect
such if they see fit. But if such women enter a legislature by the back
door, by some shady manoeuvres for ''gender equality'', by party lists
where you qualify for high placing by toeing the fashionable line --
then their policies and outlooks may have no electoral mandate to speak
of. This is cheating.
That is just the trouble: tinkering with the institutions of democracy
to achieve such a social or cultural aim as seems desirable to the
ruling political class of the day, is to attack democracy itself. Such
mechanisms have nothing to do with liberty or equality. They are plain
gerrymandering; they are paternalist; they are manipulative; and they
are grossly unjust.
An example. It is notorious that, in the old days of the Northern
Ireland parliament at Stormont, constituency boundaries were
deliberately drawn in such a way as to minimise the number of Roman
Catholic members being elected. The ruling class of Northern Ireland,
being Protestant, and running a self-consciously Protestant state, saw
it desirable to keep Roman Catholic members to a minimum. I have no
doubt they could have given you good grounds for this, and spun some
sort of discourse to justify this gerrymandering to their consciences.
What they did was wicked. But was that situation any more wicked, or
discriminatory, than what is being advocated here? This political class
-- those involved in the convention, the STUC, the Liberal Democrats --
are quite as sincere in their world view as the Stormont Unionists were
in theirs. They have a religion -- liberalisms, humanism, call it what
you will -- just as important to them as Protestantism was to the
Ulstermen. And they see it as desirable to elect women and men in equal
terms -- because it is, subjectively, a Good Thing -- as the Unionists
did to elect the maximum number of Protestants, because that was,
subjectively, a Good Thing.
But, in stooping to twitch the system -- actually to adjust the bolts
of democracy to achieve the desired cultural end -- they were, and are,
equally wrong. At least, if there is any difference in moral logic here,
I should like someone to explain it to me.
The logic of democracy -- of a voting system, of a Parliament -- is,
surely, to maximise the power of the voter. And -- putting it brutally
-- if the voters of Scotland ever want to elect a 100% male parliament,
they should be entitled to have it.
Our engines of democracy should not be seized upon by a ruling elite
to force upon the voter what is deemed good for him. These proposals for
gender equality will debase the moral authority of our public
institutions. They will create a tier of second-class elected members,
without the proper standing or weight due to their office. They will
give disproportionate power to party machines and party leaders. They
will elevate to the legislature many pursuing goals and ends
unscrutinised, and unauthorised, by ordinary electors.
These proposals are insulting to men and demeaning to women. And in
them we see, most dangerously, the institutions of the state being bent
by narrow ideology, institutions which rather should be shaped, blind
and fair, by the dictates of common sense and natural justice.

THE prospect of Scotland turning in economic growth ''of Taiwanese
proportions'' twinkled briefly in Glasgow yesterday. We were in Meridien
Court, the Scottish Office's splendid new marble, glass, and cold salmon
buffet outpost in the west, to be briefed on the latest scale of
Scotland's fiscal deficit.
The man from The Sun -- still Fighting for Independence on the
masthead, albeit in a much-much-reduced typeface -- suddenly put two and
two together and came up with a Pacific Rim miracle in the North
Atlantic.
The Scottish Office economists shifted red-faced and uncomfortable in
their seats. Such politicking -- with Alex Salmond and John Swinney of
the SNP ensconced a couple of hundred yards away in the Central Hotel,
ready to tear the official figures apart and accuse the authors of
prostituting themselves for political ends -- is not what joining the
Civil Service and dispassionate number-crunching was supposed to be all
about.
Round the corner the demolition men were still tearing apart Alhambra
House, the concrete bunker previously occupied by the Scottish Office
Industry Department. Somewhere beneath the rubble, perhaps, lay the
files containing all the previous, disputed, and inconclusive attempts
to prove whether we Scots are, in Sun-speak, a nation of subsidy junkies
or bravehearts, paying our way, and more, in the world.
Last month the SNP published the first of three new papers about the
Scottish economy, showing, in Alex Salmond's words, ''that Scotland
generates an estimated surplus of #200m relative to the UK as a whole.''
Now the Scottish Office, in an improved and updated rerun of an exercise
published once before, before the 1992 General Election, has taken 38
pages to show that, back in 1993/94, Scotland had a non-oil fiscal
deficit of #8100m, some 15% of Scotland's gross domestic product.
Throw in 90% of North Sea oil and gas revenues -- the SNP's chosen
settlement, if and when the continental shelf gets carved up -- together
with a share of privatisation proceeds and, according to the Scottish
Office analysis, the 1993/94 Scottish fiscal deficit falls to #6500m.
That is still an uncomfortably large percentage of the equivalent UK
deficit. Indeed the Scottish Office calculates that, if all the oil
revenue and all the oil output were chalked up to Scotland's account,
our deficit in 1993/94 would still have been 9.75% of Scottish GDP,
compared with a UK deficit of 7.25% of GDP.
How on earth does that picture reconcile with the SNP's stated claim
of ''an estimated (Scottish) surplus of #200m relative to the UK as a
whole''? Are we in John Prescott's land of pork pies? Is this the latest
outpourings from the Forsyth Ministry of Truth? Do the normal laws of
arithmetic go into suspense once you drive north of Carlisle?
The first thing to be said is that the Scottish Office analysis is for
1993/94, the latest year for which sufficient detailed information is
available to quantify the main income and expenditure headings. Even
then, the Scottish Office cautions that its numbers are ''indicative,
not precise''.
The latest SNP analysis is nothing if not up-to-date. It is for fiscal
year 1995/96, which still has the best part of six months to run. One of
the main hazards of adopting such a contemporary approach is that things
economic have a habit of not turning out as you expect.
For example, for the first five months of this year the accumulated UK
public sector borrowing requirement stands at #16.7bn, #700m more than
it was at the same stage in 1994, and well on its way to overshooting
the Government's own full-year forecast of #23.6bn by a significant
margin.
''But what matters is the relative position,'' protests SNP leader
Alex Salmond. A cursory reading of the latest paper from the
Nationalists might suggest there is, in fact, no Scottish deficit at
all. After all, Mr Salmond talks of a #200m surplus. But he also adds
the critical words: ''relative to the UK as a whole''.
The SNP is not telling us that, in Scotland, there is no such thing as
a fiscal budget deficit. That #200m surplus is, in fact, the amount by
which Scotland's share of the UK fiscal deficit, on the SNP's
calculations, falls below a strictly pro-rata share.
If, for argument's sake, the UK deficit were #40bn and Scotland's
pro-rata share was #4000m, the SNP is saying that Scotland's share of
the deficit is actually #3800m. As Mr Salmond told me yesterday: ''There
is no doubt that Scotland has a public sector borrowing requirement.''
So the real argument between the Scottish Office economists and the SNP
is much narrower than, say, a country running a #6500m deficit, on the
one hand, and one with a #200m surplus, on the other.
But such are the margins of error in some of the available data and
the deep political complexities of a government expenditure system based
on need that we will never see an agreed resolution to this long-running
debate.
The Nationalists have a vested interest in proving the Scottish
economy sufficiently robust to stand alone. The Government has a vested
interest in proving Scotland gets a better-than-average deal from the
Union. Arithmetic just gets in the way of rhetoric.
The civil servants who produced the latest Scottish Office analysis
deny any political interference in the process.
PUBLICATION of the report at the start of the week of the Tory party
conference in Blackpool is, they say, fortuitous. The report was
promised by the end of this year by the previous Scottish Secretary Ian
Lang, when he appeared before the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs
last June. The job, they say, was done as fast as possible.
Its publication yesterday came just 24 hours after the current
Scottish Secretary, Michael Forsyth, was reiterating his Wallace-like
determination to resist any further cut in the Barnett formula which
governs annual changes in the lion's share of Scottish government
expenditure.
''Over my dead body,'' says Braveheart Forsyth. Sadly the only people
who may be rejoicing at this contested addition to the sum of human
knowledge are those Tory MPs in the south braying for tax cuts and keen
to see the (subsidised) Scots cut down to size.

DOROTHY PAUL is now a fully paid-up member, along with the likes of
Duncan Macrae, Rikki Fulton, and Andy Stewart, in the list of Hogmanay
TV icons.
For the fourth year in a row a televised version of Dorothy's latest
stage show will be screened before the bells. BBC Scotland recorded the
opus before an enthusiastic packed audience at the Pavilion Theatre last
week.
As a follow-up to See That's Her, See That's Her Again, and Aye That's
Her Again, Ms Paul's latest production should logically have been called
something like See That's Her Again Since Last Hogmanay Aye So It Is. It
was decided, perhaps wisely, to call it Just Dorothy.
Dorothy and her co-writer and director John Bett are in brilliant form
yet again. The now-legendary cleaning lady opens the show with handy
hints on how to gie yer man a good flush oot wi' soda crystals. She is
thinking about going on to Mastermind to answer questions on ''Scrubbers
1840-1940''.
Her man has got a job at the sewage works, but we won't go into all
that.
Dorothy takes us through a varied cast of characters: the Glasgow man
as objet d'art in his semmit and clutching his remote control; the
professional funeral-goer; the ''whatever happened to baby Jane''
clients of Fraser's cosmetics department; the Kelvinside lady slightly
confused about the meaning of bondage; and Cheryl, the ''in-flight''
attendant on the Quick As Winkie coach service from Glasgow to
Blackpool.
The last in the above list is a hilarious direct descendant of Bridie
Macpherson, the famous Glesca tram-caur clippie. The modern Bridie not
only has to keep law and order among the passengers, she has to organise
snacks and entertainment too.
Thus we have announcements such as: ''Please stick to the seats
allocated as falling about the floor can form an obstacle. The above
rule may be waived during the karaoke.'' Plus ca change, and that.
Sharp-witted
THE Diary's man in America is on with a few O J Simpson jokes. O J is
getting married again. He's decided to have another stab at it.
And what were his last words to Judge Ito? ''Can I have my hat and
gloves back, please?''
Finally, what's the difference between O J and President Clinton?
Nothing. There's not a conviction between them.
Broadly speaking
MANY'S the time Scots have bridled when someone on the telly has
referred to Britain when he or she really meant England. William
McLaughlin, of Carmichael near Biggar, was one such to complain when
this solecism was committed in The Great Famine recently on BBC
television.
The response to Mr McLaughlin shows the BBC in less than contrite
mode: ''While we would certainly not wish to overlook this error when it
occurs, we feel it only fair to say that the respected linguistic
authority, H W Fowler, wrote in his Dictionary of Modern English Usage
that to compel people to stop and think whether they mean their country
in a narrower or wider sense each time they name it is doomed to
failure.
''References to British instead of English, and vice-versa on
occasions, happen so instinctively that we feel it would be rash to
promise that they will never occur again.''
So, there we have it. Next time a BBC newsreader talks of British
soccer fans on the rampage after an England game, think of Fowler and
the impossibility of thinking of your country in a narrower or wider
sense.

HAIR-SHIRT Time: We said in an article about ScottishPower perhaps
becoming CelticPower now that they have customers in Wales, that they
have executive seats at Ibrox but not at Parkhead. ScottishPower do have
seats at Celtic Park (but not as many as at Ibrox). They also support
commercially Falkirk, Kilmarnock, and Partick Thistle among others.
Even, God bless them, Hamilton Accies.
From the mailbag
ALISTAIR B Fulton of Hyndland Road, Glasgow, spotted a sign in a TV
rental shop in Byres Road. It read ''. . . special offer on student
rentals . . .'' He says: ''I know that students are strapped for cash
but isn't this a rather desperate alternative to a grant? Besides who
would want a student?''
Mr Fulton also passes on an extract from an article in the London
Evening Standard about a forthcoming stage musical version of Prisoner:
Cell Block H (starring Lily Savage, by the way). According to the
report: ''Prisoner is set in an Australian penal system for women called
Wentworth.'' This seems a bit exclusive, says Mr Fulton. Where do they
keep the prisoners who aren't called Wentworth?

OUR illustration today is not of a new use that Oor Wullie has found
for his bucket. It is from a leaflet sent to us by reader J Smart of
Glasgow on an indelicate but important topic.
The brochure contains information about a product called the
Stool-Stool. The diagram really says it all so we will not quote at
length from the leaflet except to say it claims medical studies show
that the squatting position is best when in a number-two situation. One
detail which is thankfully absent from the diagram: keep your knees
together.
The people of the Third World, which has few water closets, benefit in
this respect, we are told. Now we can simulate Third World techniques:
''The squatting position can be adopted on the western world's water
closets by the simple use of the Stool-Stool.
''The Stool-Stool is made in brilliant white glass-reinforced plastic
and has a foam rubber base covering for firm footing. The Stool-Stool is
available in three sizes: 9 inches, 10 inches, and 11 inches. You should
use the largest size you can comfortably use.''
The device can be yours from an address in Nottingham for #29.99 plus
#3 p&amp;p. Canny Scots might simply borrow Wullie's bucket.

LIKE Andrew Young I am more than bemused by the rendering of Rule
Britannia by the supporters of the current Scottish League champions
(October 6).
Frankly, their choral standards do not bear comparison with the
Promenaders at the Last Night of the Proms.
I also put in some sea time with the Royal Navy in defence of the
sentiments expressed in the magnificent patriotic tune, though, as
suggested by your correspondent, the Royal Navy does not exactly rule
the seas as it did in the days of yore.
I doubt if most of those super patriots who howl out the words,
ensconced in the comfort and safety of the Ibrox stands, have even
crossed the Clyde on the old Govan Ferry, far less ploughed the sea
lanes aboard a frigate or a corvette.

IAIN White in his travel article on Barra, Majestic isle of
make-believe, would appear to reinforce a stereotypical image of
Scotland which so incenses us when portrayed by London-based advertising
companies or Hollywood film directors (September 30).
The origins of the romantic, mythical image of Scotland lie with
Culloden, the consequent destruction of Highland society, and England's
further colonial aspirations.
In order to colonise other cultures, it was necessary for England to
define her own. The English chose to define themselves in contrast to
their neighbours, in other words in terms of what they were not. Thus
the English were cast as urban, civilised, rational, and clean-shaven;
the Scots as rural, barbarous, emotional, and hirsute.
The novels of Sir Walter Scott, as well as the stark beauty of much of
the scenery, have served to popularise and romanticise this image of
Scotland and the Scots worldwide.
Whilst there are undoubtedly worse images with which to be associated,
the fact remains that -- much the same as the plenitude of tartans
available on Edinburgh's High Street -- the popular image of Scotland is
at once both an inaccurate invention and condescending.
In this light, whether deliberate or not, Iain White's description of
the ''tiny airport terminal'' which ''exudes an atmosphere of
unreality'' and which ''creates the impression of being in a land of
make-believe'' displays a typically patronising urban attitude towards
rural Scotland.
Similarly, in expressing his dismay at the existence of a harling
factory beside the former home of Compton Mackenzie -- ''the romance of
the place is somewhat muted by the intrusive noise and dust'' -- Iain
White again shows the common city-dweller's recreational approach to the
countryside.
If Iain White were to adopt his own advice on ''the need for outside
forces to listen to local knowledge'', I am sure he would paint a more
realistic picture of life on Barra. As long as Scots themselves
perpetuate the myths of rural Scotland, the country as a whole cannot
expect to be properly represented at an international level.

We are not just getting fatter, but more and more of us are becoming
dangerously overweight. Elizabeth Buie describes the battle against
obesity
ON Thursday this week, the Nutrition Task Force, set up three years
ago by the Department of Health, will meet for the last time.
The Government insists that the NTF was never intended to be a
permanent fixture, and that it was given an extra year's grace in any
case.
However, a number of nutritional health experts and consumer champions
say that the task force still has important work to complete and that by
disbanding it the Government is signalling that it is not fully
committed to the problem of obesity.
Health campaigners are united in believing that the move has serious
repercussions because as a nation we are not just getting fatter, but
more and more of us are becoming dangerously overweight.
More significantly, too many people have not grasped the message that
what is needed is a change in lifestyle -- a change in the kind of food
we eat and the amount of exercise we take -- not just calorie-counting
for a couple of months.
The figures are very worrying. In England, in 1980, 6% of men and 8%
of women were obese, according to clinically accepted measurements. By
1993, those statistics had risen to 13% of men and 16% of women. Based
on current trends, it is estimated that by the year 2005, 18% of men and
24% of women will be obese.
Scottish figures are believed to be as bad, if not worse. Such trends
have serious implications for our health, for obesity is being linked to
cancer, heart disease, hypertension, and gallstone problems. Those who
are overweight, but not in the obese category, are also more vulnerable
to these illnesses.
Running parallel to the condemnation provoked by the axing of the
Nutrition Task Force has been a stream of claims that a report produced
by the obesity working group -- a committee set up under the aegis of
the Nutrition Task Force and its sister organisation, the Physical
Activity Tast Force -- has been delayed, and almost buried by the
Government.
Recently, The Economist magazine set the ball rolling by claiming that
the Department of Health had said the obesity report had been
''overtaken by events'' and that the Government had no plans to publish
it, but would make it available to anyone who requested it. It also
reported that this statement had been followed by a ''rethink'' and that
Ministers were now considering what form publication should take.
A spokeswoman for the department has now assured The Herald that the
report will be published ''fairly shortly'', probably by the end of this
month, and that its publication had always been scheduled for round
about now.
In any case, she said, the statistics contained in the report had
already come into the public domain as they had been announced at a
symposium of nutrition experts and had been included in a report of that
meeting.
The point, however, according to some campaigners, is that the report
should not appear in some obscure scientific journal, but under the
Government's name and easily accessible to members of the public.
One of the country's leading experts in nutritional health, Dr Andrew
Prentice, from the Dunn Nutrition Clinic in Cambridge, said that the
most important issue now was what the Government planned to do about the
report's recommendations.
Essentially, these recommendations cover ways in which Government
departments, directors of public health, the food industry, schools, and
local authorities can tackle the problem of obesity through dietary
advice, ie. the reduction of the fat content in daily intake, and
through a greater emphasis on increased physical activity.
Dr Prentice would like to see the Government setting up an Obesity
Focus Group, which he acknowledges sounds like yet another committee,
but would at least be a mechanism for keeping the subject on the agenda.
He accepts, however, that the scope of the report is too much for any
Government to tackle in one fell swoop.
''Obesity is caused by virtually every facet of our environment: the
fat content of foods, the types of food that are supplied by fast-food
chains, our eating habits in the workplace, and it has to do with
labelling. It has to do with our physical activity or inactivity, which
means our transport policy. Kids are taken to school by car or bus
because parents are worried about their safety on the roads. They are
frightened they will be knocked over or abducted, so it is also a safety
issue,'' he said.
Some believe it is also an economic and a political issue.
The National Food Alliance, a lobby organisation which campaigns for
the reduction in fat, sugar, and salt in food, believes that the
Nutrition Task Force is the victim of the Government's philosophy of
deregulation and non-interventionism in business. Although the NTF's
last days are being held under the reign of the Health Secretary,
Stephen Dorrell, it was his predecessor Virginia Bottomley who gave the
order to close it down.
Jack Winkler, treasurer and spokesman for the NFA, claims that Mrs
Bottomley was reluctant to carry out the interventionist actions that
would inevitably have flowed from its recommendations, fearful of
reinforcing her image as ''chief matron of the nanny state''.
He also claims that the food industry was unhappy about some of the
NTF's conclusions, particularly that the consumption of sugary foods
should also be reduced.
Another source claims that the food industry was not co-operating with
the NTF as much as it liked to pretend. On one level, it welcomed the
dietary message, while pushing the argument that what overweight people
really needed to do was take more exercise. On another level, it was
covertly trying to do all it could to ensure its markets were not
damaged.
In the preparation of educational materials on nutritional
information, the food industry could be guilty, it was claimed, of being
selective in the information it presented, featuring only one product,
or being plain inaccurate. For example, one educational poster rejected
as unsuitable allegedly stated: ''We all need meat to live'' -- a claim
that is clearly untrue.
Nevertheless, sections of the food industry that do want to put over
the right message will certainly find it harder to carry out such a
policy if the Government appears to be backing away from the problem of
obesity. It is expensive for them to develop new products with healthy
nutritional profiles, to redesign labels, and to develop new advertising
campaigns.
Yesterday, however, the Scottish Co-op took the brave step of
launching a campaign specifically targeting obesity, and openly
criticised the Government for axing the NTF.
A spokeswoman for the Co-op claimed the company was ''breaking ranks
with the rest of the food industry to battle against Britain's obesity
crisis''. The Co-op was therefore cutting the fat content of its
products where possible and putting fat and calorie information on the
front of all its products to help consumers.
Bill Shannon, Co-op General Manager, called for co-operation from the
rest of the industry and warned that truly effective action on fat could
not be achieved alone.
''By the Government's own admission obesity levels are increasing, and
now it seems the experts believe they'll reach crisis point if nothing
is done to help. Most people want to eat more healthily but they don't
want to be nannied. Sadly, however, the common sense of the NTF appears
to be grinding to a halt,'' he said.
''News of the NTF's demise is being welcomed by some. However,
consumer groups accuse the Government of bowing to pressure from vested
interests in the food industry which, they believe, make profits from
unhealthy eating. To stop now is ludicrous -- urgent action is clearly
required,'' he added.
Ann Foster, the Director of the Scottish Consumers Council and a
member of the NTF, believes that the key to tackling obesity it getting
people to make big changes in their diet and lifestyle. To achieve this,
however, a series of small incremental steps must be taken -- ''not just
persuading people to change from A to B, but making A a better product,
putting in less fat and sugar without compromising quality,'' she said.
More research should also be done on whether factors such as stress,
unemployment, or low income also make people overweight, she believes.
''You would expect people on restricted incomes not to suffer from
obesity because they can't afford a lot of food. But they are, more than
other sections of society,'' said Ms Foster.
In the current climate it will be interesting to see whether the
Scottish Diet Action Group recommends a more interventionist approach
when it issues its report next month.

Foreign students were delighted to see the caravan with a welcome on
its mat, writes Stefan Marx
FOR Glaswegians it might be slightly irritating to spot a caravan in
the middle of George Square. But for Sergio Esteves from Portugal it was
one of the most pleasant sights when he arrived in the city at 6.20am
off the London overnight bus. ''International Students Welcome'' was the
message on a banner fixed to the cabin.
Inside, volunteers provided fellow-students from abroad with advice,
maps, coffee, and biscuits. The cabin was a popular meeting place for
newcomers to the city for the three weeks during which it was open.
It was not hard to tell from Sergio's face that he was worried. The
27-year-old from Porto had arrived in Glasgow to take a postgraduate
degree in geotechnics at Strathclyde University, but his priority was to
find somewhere to spend the night.
Rosemary Eldridge, the international students' chaplain who runs the
caravan with the help of about 30 volunteer students, listened carefully
as Sergio explained that there was no accommodation left in the
university's halls. Mrs Eldridge could not immediately offer a room, but
a coffee helped raise his mood.
The chaplain was on the early shift and had been welcoming students
since 6am. Sergio flicked through the clippings of classified ads which
the volunteers cut from various papers each morning. Another student who
had found a bedsit the day before passed on some promising telephone
numbers. Mrs Eldridge started phoning around, and on the second call,
Sergio had an appointment to view a room in Argyle Street.
''It's amazing how things work out sometimes,'' Mrs Eldridge said. The
chaplain and her volunteers are totally committed to the initiative.
What makes people like Federico, a 23-year-old Italian from Turin, drive
out to Glasgow Airport in the evening, hold up a banner welcoming
international students, and then carry suitcases belonging to Costa from
Greece, whom he had never met before?
It can't be money anyway, because the volunteers are unpaid.
Federico explained: ''I was in the very same situation last year and
wondered, for instance, where I could buy a pillow. I was thankful that
I had these people to ask.'' Now, one year later, he is the person
giving advice and support.
Like Federico, almost half of the volunteers are foreign students,
while a number of the Scottish volunteers have studied abroad
themselves. ''They are very conscious of the fact that coming to a
foreign country can be a quite exciting but also a threatening
experience,'' said Mrs Eldridge.
The volunteers made their visitors feel at home as soon as they
stepped into the caravan, which was open 12 hours a day, seven days a
week.
Funding, mainly used to cover costs for brochures and bus fares, came
from the universities and colleges in Glasgow, the British Council and
Strathclyde Region. More than 1000 students from 76 countries benefited
from the coffee and comfort on offer this year.
They came from as far afield as Australia, Turkey, and Zimbabwe. Most,
however, were Germans. Seven from Brunei were registered, as were six
from England. ''No joke,'' said the chaplain, who is from England
herself. ''They really felt they had come to a foreign country, with a
different education and legal system. And they sometimes find the accent
a little difficult,'' she added.
Stefan Merx is a postgraduate student from Germany who is gaining work
experience in The Herald.

Brussels
EUROPEAN Commission officials stepped up pressure on France last night
for a possible ban on French nuclear testing in the South Pacific.
A huge and divisive row threatens the European Union if France is
hauled before the European Court of Justice for defying the terms of the
Euratom Treaty.
In Strasbourg today a majority of Euro-MPs will continue to press for
an injunction against France after revelations last night that
commission investigators were denied crucial scientific evidence about
the tests' effect. The European Parliament debates nuclear testing
tomorrow.
European Commission officials believe they have a right under the
terms of the treaty to demand full details because of the effects of
radioactivity on European Union citizens -- mainly French nationals --
in the South Pacific. However Mr Chirac insists that because French
military policy is involved, the European Commission has no competence
in the area.
A commission spokesman said yesterday a letter was formally being
delivered to the French authorities demanding more detailed answers to
questions. The debate inside the commission will continue tomorrow in
Strasbourg after last week's stormy meeting at which it was reported
that there was ''blood on the walls'' when commissioners disagreed about
suing France.
Mr Jacques Santer, commission president, will be asked to report the
latest developments at the commission to the European Parliament
tomorrow. Next week the Parliament moves back to Brussels for an inquiry
at which senior French officials will be asked searching questions on
sensitive areas of the testing programme.
A commission report from experts who visited the region last month
said some data had been withheld along with details of the tests'
long-term effects and French plans to clean up the site.

AT a time when interest is being shown in the Millennium tree fund for
Scotland it may be pertinent to consider the importance of trees to this
country.
From the retreat of the ice, trees have played an important role in
the development of Scotland. They have provided heat, protection,
building material, food, weapons, medicines for our material needs, as
well as satisfying some of our spiritual requirements.
The Celts held certain trees and groves as sacred -- the oak was
venerated as a symbol of Zeus and used in their rites by the Druids. The
yew was also revered by the Druids and a staff of its wood was used to
record phases of the moon. It was planted in holy places and there was a
taboo on its use for fuel.
The early Christian church recognised the tree as as symbol of
immortality and eternity. Also of special importance in earlier times
were hawthorn, willow, hazel, rowan, and elder -- all native trees.
Trees are of immense value to birds and mammals as well a being
invaluable in scenic terms. They are part of our heritage and the
Millennium Fund's decision to fund a native tree planting scheme is
surely a significant one.

Jane Reick and her husband Ron are striving towards a unified approach
to medical science through their College of Holistic Medicine, writes
Geraldine Abrahams
THERE is a growing demand for practitioners of holistic medicine --
treatment of the complete person, physically, psychologically and
emotionally -- to work with charities, in GPs' surgeries, in businesses
and other areas of work. And as the need for such skills increases, so
does the importance of thorough training for those working in
counselling, therapeutic massage, and stress management.
One training organisation which is striving towards the concept of a
unified approach to medical science is the College of Holistic Medicine,
a registered charity set up in 1983 by principal Jane Reick and her
husband Ron, the current director of studies.
Jane has a solid background in physical and psychotherapy, having
trained with a host of natural therapists like osteopath Maitland
Buchanan and Drs Bernard Jensen and John Christopher. She was the sole
student of Dr S S Singha, an international practitioner of natural
medicine with whom she studied acupuncture, naturopathy and osteopathy.
She also studied psychotherapy with Larry Bloemberg, Simon Meyerson and
Dr Joel Badaines.
Ron Rieck -- a student of psycho-sociology at Lewis University,
oriental medicine at Massachusetts, psychotherapy in India, and
hypnotherapy with Duskrainer Opfer -- has evolved the course over the
past 15 years, blending Rogerian, Gestalt, Bioenergetic and Stress
Management theories.
''Both Perls and Rogers created an interactive therapy where the
patient was not only listened to but responded to, moving away from the
patient lying on the couch talking while the practitioner took notes,''
explains Jane Reick. ''We were trying to see the next step on. We looked
at two fundamentals -- honesty and respect -- and devised a kind of
therapy that we called 'life development', which gives the patient the
perspective and the personal power to look at his or her own problems.
''This is teaching people how to look at their lives through clearer
eyes, with less judgment and more honesty.''
The importance of ''touch' became apparent through these years of
study. ''It seemed to us that touch was an essential to people improving
in their own self-image, and in coming to terms with their own physical
body,'' says Jane. ''We live at a level that we can tolerate without
realising that there are levels below that which would be much more
comfortable. We live at the tolerance level and then the straw breaks
the camel's back.''
Jane's work began in 1978, at a time when cynicism had set in after
the Sixties. ''It was pioneering work,'' she remembers. ''Attitudes at
that time were very hard. This kind of medicine was belligerent against
the medical profession, but as the college has got older and we have
matured, we are rather looking now to see how the whole lot can come
together to help people.
''It is very much better understood now and in a way it is flavour of
the month, which can present its own problems in terms of maintaining
standards and professionalism. We are trying to do with massage what the
osteopaths have done, coming together under one body. But trying to
create a standardisation is hard because everyone wants their own
pitch.''
The courses run at venues in the UK, Ireland and Switzerland and
comprise a Foundation Course which is followed by study for diplomas in
Therapeutic Massage (one year), Advanced Bodywork (one year), Life
Development Counselling and Stress Management Skills (two years) and in
Life Development and Stress Management Therapy (four years).
The college is affiliated to the Institute for Complementary Medicine,
the British Massage Therapy Council and the British Complementary
Medicine Association. Graduates can join the British Register of
Complementary Practitioners, the London &amp; County Society of
Psychologists and the Society of Holistic Practitioners.
Negotiations are currently taking place with Manchester University to
have pre-degree (HND) status accreditation, with a view to converting it
later to a BA degree. The validation submission will be made next spring
and the course should run within a year after that. They also intend to
approach one of the Scottish universities with a similar proposal.
Jane and Ron Rieck also run the Centre for Stress Management, where
they treat people from every walk of life, and from which many graduates
have gone on to run similar businesses themselves.
They consider that a therapy should work for everyone and that, if it
is not available across the board, it will not stand up. A recent test
has been a pilot programme in Easterhouse, supported by Easterhouse
Initiative. It has already run for five years, the last three years of
which were funded by Urban Aid -- funding which will continue for a
further two years.
''The work at Easterhouse involves everything that the private stress
management clinic offers including group work and one-to-one
counselling. It is no different, there is the same quality built in,''
assures Jane.
The latest initiative in Easterhouse has involved working with two
groups of children in local primary schools. This project has been
running for a year and through funding from Children in Need and the Van
Leer Foundation, there is now a therapist working for two and a half
days a week on the project, which is designed to help relieve stress for
children and indirectly for teachers.
''Children can suffer stress for all sorts of reasons -- feeling
inadequate and having to produce work in a class, or feeling under
pressure and not knowing how to handle it, so coming up with behavioural
problems,'' says Jane.
''I would love to see the facility for putting a therapist and teacher
together to work with classes where necessary. Children are our future
and we are trying to produce something better for tomorrow by
creating/training practitioners who are honest and respectful and carry
the evidence that they have been able to change their own lives.
''It is like Oxfam. Oxfam says: give a man a fish and you feed him for
a day; teach him how to fish and you feed him for life. If I solve
someone's problem, it is only that problem. If I teach someone how to
manage their life, they are their own person for the rest of their
life.''

THE Fifth Man is dead. John Cairncross, who returned to Britain six
months ago after 40 years in exile, was the Whitehall mandarin
identified in 1990 by the Soviet double agent, Oleg Gordievsky, as the
legendary, some thought mythical, missing link in the famous ring of
spies consisting of Anthony Blunt, Kim Philby, Guy Burgess, and Donald
Maclean.
His former KGB controller, Colonel Yuri Modin, confirming his identity
in 1991, said that Cairncross, a former Treasury, Foreign Office, and
MI6 official, who always insisted he was an outsider and not an
associate of the other four, was right. The link between them had come
about by coincidence.
On his return to Britain, Cairncross, whose older brother, Sir
Alexander Cairncross, the economist, is Chancellor of Glasgow
University, admitted he had spied for the Russians during the Second
World War, and had been promoted to one of the Russian's top five after
the Battle of Kursk in 1943. He denied being a traitor, insisting he had
helped the Russians by passing on secrets about the common enemy,
Germany, which helped them recover from Hitler's invasion.
''I was providing information at the time to help Britain's allies,
the Russians, to win,'' he said justifying his actions. ''It was German
intelligence I was providing. I was made one of The Five during the war.
I was promoted to fifth man after the Battle of Kursk because I had
provided information which helped the Soviets to win that battle against
the Germans.''
Born in Lesmahagow, he was educated at Hamilton Academy and Glasgow
University, and, after winning a scholarship, went to Trinty College,
Cambridge, where he gained a first-class degree in French and German. It
was there his potential was spotted by his tutor, Blunt.
He came top in both the Home and Foreign Office exams in 1936 and,
after a spell at the Sorbonne, duly entered the Civil Service, working
first in the Foreign Office, then the Treasury, moving when war broke
out, like many other intellectuals, into MI6 and intelligence gathering.
Like many undergraduates of the day he was briefly a member of the
Communist Party, and those sympathies motivated his actions while he was
on the staff of Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the
information-gathering wing of the espionage system, then at Bletchley.
He discovered Britain was not supplying the Soviet Union with decoded
German signals giving the location of Luftwaffe units on the Eastern
Front, and felt that it was essential to the Allied war effort they
should have it.
After the war he remained in MI6 continuing to work for the Russians.
He met his controller, Colonel Modin, for the first time in 1947 in a
West London pub. The liaison continued until 1951 when he came under
suspicion after a series of hand-written notes to Guy Burgess, whom he
had first met at university, were found by MI5 after Burgess's flight to
Moscow.
He denied knowing Burgess was a spy, was believed, and allowed to
resign quietly from MI6, but told to leave the country and not come
back. He travelled to Canada before going to work for the UN Food and
Agriculture Organisation in Rome. After his retirement he lived in
Provence.
In 1964 Blunt, by then the Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures, was
exposed and spilled the beans, telling his interrogators that he had
introduced Cairncross to James Klugmann, a communist and friend of
Donald Maclean.
After being assured he could not be extradited from Italy under the
Official Secrets Act, and so was safe from prosecution, Cairncross
confessed he had acted for Moscow since 1939.
In recent months he suffered two strokes and in September, following
the death of his first wife, Gabriella, from whom he had been estranged
for several years, at the age of 82 he married his long-time companion,
Gayle Brinkenhoff, a 39-year-old American singer.
He has left behind the manuscript of his memoirs described by those
who have seen it as ''explosive''. Provisionally entitled Memoirs Of The
Fifth Man they are expected to reveal the extent and scope of his
espionage for the first time.

When women write of imaginary sexual adventures they tend to keep it
tidy: theirs is sex with social responsibility. Anvar Khan talks to two
authors of pulp pornography
EROTICA has a conscience. It is not a completely cynical exercise. In
order to sustain an intellectual interest in the creation of erotic
fiction, pornography writers, like regular writers, look to themselves
for subject matter. But not in the sense that Agatha Christie must have
been a murderer.
Writers cannot write for other people. Whether they will have an
audience much depends on what happens after the main event at the
typewriter. In pulp pornography, writers come in two fashions. The one
who is careful to include a perversion for everyone, and the other, who
writes what he or she would like to read.
Male and female writers take different approaches too. According to
Kerri Sharpe, editor of Black Lace, Virgin Publishing Ltd: ''The main
difference is that when men write erotica, all references are
anatomy-based; impossibly proportioned nymphomaniacs, the detail of
their bodies. You've no idea what the room's like or even what decade it
is.
''When women write erotica, they write of the whole experience; what
clothes they're wearing, and their surroundings.''
In the case of the following two interviewees, it seems that women who
write sexual adventures for other women tend to be careful of the images
they portray. Theirs, like marriage, is sex with social responsibility.
And when pornography is produced by women, when they have not only the
physical but mental power to arouse, they want to clean up. They want to
dust and vacuum away any nasty cobwebs of misogyny more disinterested
authors left behind.
Authoress Juliet Hastings' first book, Crash Course, was published by
Virgin Publishing label Black Lace, Erotic Fiction for Women.
Hastings, 35, says: ''Group orgies are purely from my imagination. The
only research I can do is with one person because I married my first
boyfriend.
''I'm the consumer. My only benchmark is what I like. Foot fetishes,
rubber and latex don't work for me, nor does what the editor of New
Woman coyly calls 'waterworks'.
''I like to write about sex and food, which is fun, slippery, sticky
and mucky, the sort of thing you wouldn't really do. Like much erotic
fiction, when the reality is difficult to achieve or maybe not quite as
fulfilling as what you'd imagine, it's fun to write about it. Because
it's a fantasy, nothing goes wrong and you don't have to wash the sheets
afterwards.
''Some people think writing pulp pornography is a joke rather than an
achievement. Pornography has derogatory overtones but people are not as
horrified by it as they think they might be, and actually rather enjoy
it.
''Black Lace came at a time when I was developing, maturing, but it
has added to my self-confidence and certainly to my sexual confidence,
which sounds odd from someone in a faithful long-term relationship. It
changes the way you feel about yourself. I feel stronger and sexier.''
She adds:''If you are writing about strong women -- I have very strong
heroines -- you are actually walking a very delicate line between
liberated, emancipated women and heroes who aren't tough enough to turn
the reader on. This doesn't mean that I can't enjoy or want to write
about submissive sexuality. Most people I know, if you pinned them to a
wall and said, 'Come on, do you like a few silk scarves or not?' would
say 'Well yeah, from time to time'.
''Writing erotica is by no means as exposed as actually offering your
body. When you are writing erotica you can hide. A lot of Black Lace
authors would never talk to anybody. They use pen names, they don't even
tell their best friends. It's a secret release.''
Angel Strand, 40, wrote La Basquaise for Black Lace. She works
part-time, teaching adult literacy.
''The bizarre interests me. My work has been described as a cross
between mainstream romantic fiction and straightforward erotica.
Medieval sex toys had slippers with little penises on the end. The
slippers were for men, for use on women.
''There's a jewel-encrusted lizard in my first novel. A live lizard
which crawls all over her flesh. Her lover buys her it as present and
it's trained to do erotic things to her. It's a mad idea, it hasn't any
reality. The breaking of taboos is where the eroticism is. When you
first start writing erotic fiction it's very liberating and you thunder
away, but after a while you get bored.
''People hint at what they like in my work. They're not specific.
Black Lace have a 20% male readership. Men will be very direct but women
will be indirect. There's a man in my book who likes to have sex in
public, not in view but within earshot, and a woman said to me, 'Ooh, I
like that!'.
''There's a lot of people making money from writing erotica and
telephone sex lines and cable. You hear from other writers that there
are magazines you can write for. It's almost like a secret underground
industry but there's an awful lot of it.
''I used to write for men's magazines under a man's name. I sent work
to a publisher who said: 'Oh there's no market for women's stuff'. Two
or three years later, suddenly, it all exploded. Black Lace came along.
It's an extension of mainstream literature. Instead of stopping at the
door, you just go in.
''There are people who will say that erotica provides the sort of
stimulation which may help a waning sex life. I've actually seen that in
a problem page my Dad found. An agony aunt had recommended reading a
Black Lace novel. I haven't come out completely, I'm using a pseudonym.
My Dad said he was glad I was making money, as long as I wasn't
'corrupting young minds'.
She adds: ''It may sound naff but I try to make sure that what I'm
writing has some sense of political correctness about it. I really do
not like the idea of women being raped in fiction, or dressing up as
dolls in underwear. I try not to go into the stereotype of the femme
fatale. I censor myself.
''When I'm feeling particularly inadequate, and go into a newsagents
and see magazines on the top shelf with silicon-breasted women pouting
at me, I get angry. I wish they weren't so garish. Men can have what
they want on demand, women can't.
''For me, pornography is a freedom to earn money while learning how to
write novels. You get the princely sum of 37[1/2]p every time somebody
pays a fiver. I have literary pretensions. This is like an
apprenticeship.
''Sex seems to be all over our culture. If you're not having great sex
it's thought there is something wrong with you. Most people just want to
do it and get on with their lives. I fantasise that maybe there's a
woman who has trouble expressing herself, who might be able to buy a
Black Lace book and read it and feel that it gives her permission to ask
her lover for something different.''

Dr John Rigg, senior ecomonic adviser in the Scottish Education and
Industry Department, describes the methodology and principal findings of
a new Scottish Office report
THE Government's expenditure and revenue flows in Scotland are an
important element in the debate about Scotland's constitutional future.
This debate has generated a range of claims and counterclaims about the
size of Scotland's ''fiscal deficit'' and the implications for living
standards under the various constitutional options open to the people of
Scotland.
A new publication from the Scottish Office -- Government Expenditure
and Revenue in Scotland, 1993-94 -- aims to clarify the position.
In undertaking the research for the publication, the Government
economists and statisticians have not speculated on possible different
constitutional arrangements or on how these might affect expenditure and
revenue flows. Rather, the principal objective has been to examine
existing circumstances and data, on the basis of a methodology which is
analytically sound and which can be clearly explained.
Three points should be made by way of introduction. First, the data
are for 1993-94. This is the latest year for which the required detailed
information on actual expenditure incurred and revenue received is
available.
While it would obviously be more timely to use data for subsequent
years, this is not sensible, given the information gaps which remain to
be filled and the very wide margin of error that would accompany any
such estimates.
Second, even for this year, some of the figures are more robust than
others. The publication presents our best estimates and includes a
detailed description of the derivation of the various individual series.
Third, due caution should be applied in the interpretation of the
fiscal deficit. This is the difference between two large numbers --
total public spending in Scotland and total taxes raised in Scotland --
both of which are estimates and subject to potential margins of error.
What are the estimates themselves? Let us begin with the expenditure
side, where three types of Government spending can be distinguished:
''identifiable'', ''non-identifiable'', and ''other'' expenditure.
Cutting through the jargon, ''identifiable expenditure'' is that which
-- as the name suggests -- can be identified from offical records as
having been incurred specifically on behalf of the population of a
particular country/region. In 1993-94, such expenditure in Scotland
totalled #21.4bn, or 10.3% of the UK total. (For reference, Scotland's
population share was 8.8%.)
This total includes #4.6bn on health and personal social services and
#3.8bn on education, as well as spending on a range of other programmes
for which the Scottish Secretary has direct responsibility: agriculture
and fisheries, trade and industry, energy and employment, transport,
housing, environmental services and law and order. However, the largest
single programme of identifiable expenditure is social security
(#7.6bn), which is administered on a GB basis by the DSS.
Expenditure is defined to be ''non-identifiable'' for one of two
reasons: either it cannot be identified from official records as having
been incurred in a particular part of the UK; or it would be misleading
to attribute spending incurred on behalf of the UK as a whole to
particular countries/regions.
It includes expenditure on defence, overseas aid and representation,
payments to the European Community, the contribution to the external
financing requirements of certain nationalised industries and part of
central government administration. Our research suggests that Scotland's
share of UK non-identifiable expenditure is slightly less than its share
of UK GDP. In 1993-94, non-identifiable Government spending in Scotland
is estimated to be #3.7bn.
''Other'' expenditure covers items which do not fall naturally into
the two earlier categories. The principal items are local authority and
central government debt interest and other adjustments to bring the
expenditure total into line with the concepts of the National Accounts,
particularly the treatment of capital consumption.
The attention to detail required here does nothing to dispel the view
that Government economists are those who quit accountancy because they
find it too exciting. But the numbers are not trivial. The estimate of
other Government expenditure in Scotland in 1993-94 is #3.3bn.
Adding up the three expenditure categories yields an estimate of
aggregate Government spending in Scotland of #28.4bn. This is 10.0% of
the UK total -- ie, over one percentage point higher than the Scottish
share of the UK population. Government spending per head is #5550 in
Scotland, compared with #4870 in the UK.
On the other side of the fiscal equation are the tax revenues paid by
Scottish households and companies. Here, it should be noted that the
available information is less well-founded.
Some tax revenues can be fairly readily allocated to Scotland. These
include income tax (#4.6bn), Social Security contributions (#3.5bn) and
inheritance tax. Similarly, for most expenditure taxes -- including VAT
(#3.4bn), local authority rates/council tax (#2bn), Vehicle Excise Duty,
petrol taxes and taxes on tobacco and alcohol -- the Scottish element of
the tax can be reasonably estimated either directly or on the basis of
the consumption in Scotland of the goods or services attracting the tax.
Those taxes which can be identified in this way yielded an estimated
#16.2bn in 1993-94.
Other Government revenues are more difficult to apportion, usually
because they are collected centrally and official data on the
distribution of receipts by country or region are not available.
Included in this group are corporation tax, capital gains tax and
central government interest and dividend receipts. The Scottish
allocation for this group of taxes is #4.2bn. The publication provides a
detailed description of the methodology used in deriving allocations of
these revenues attributable to Scotland.
The calculations suggest that total revenues of #20.4bn (excluding
North Sea revenues) were raised in Scotland. This is equivalent to 8.9%
of of total UK non-oil revenues and is slightly above Scotland's share
(8.8%) of the UK population. It follows, therefore, that Scottish
revenues per capita (at #3975) were marginally above the UK figure
(#3950).
With aggregate Government expenditure in Scotland in 1993-94 estimated
at #28.4bn and total revenues estimated at #20.4bn, Scotland had a
fiscal deficit of #8.1bn. (The discrepancy arises from rounding). On a
similar basis, the UK figure was #53.5bn.
The question then arises: how can one get a sense of what these
numbers mean? After all, as Ronald Reagan once remarked, a billion here
and a billion there and pretty soon you are talking large numbers.
One way of determining the relative orders of magnitude of these
deficits is to express them as percentages of the respective GDPs. In
the case of Scotland, the fiscal deficit in 1993-94 was 15% of GDP; the
corresponding figure for the UK was 8[1/2]%. It should be noted, of
course, that these outturns are above the normal orders of magnitude as
the cyclical peak of Government borrowing was reached in that year.
The keen-eyed observer will have noticed that North Sea revenues have
been excluded thus far. This follows the Regional Accounts conventions,
in which the North Sea is treated as a separate region (the UK
Continental Shelf).
In practice, this does not have a significant effect of the estimate
of the fiscal deficit attributable to Scotland. In 1993-94, according to
the Inland Revenue, North Sea revenues totalled just over #1.2bn. Hence,
even with 100% of oil revenues allocated to Scotland, the fiscal deficit
would still be #6.9bn.
Two other points should be made. First, it has been emphasised that
the estimates of the fiscal deficit should be regarded as indicative, as
changes in the choice of plausible assumptions inevitably affect the
exact arithmetic of the calculation.
It is relevant to record, however, that the estimate derived here is
very close to that of respected academic researchers (for example, the
Fraser of Allander Institute for 1992-93). Similarly, internal estimates
by the House of Commons Library include a fiscal deficit which is one of
the same order of magnitude.
Finally, the analysis presented here is a static one: that is, it is
concerned only with the position in 1993-94. As noted earlier, this is,
for the time being, the most appropriate year to analyse. But of course,
the world has moved on since then.
The most important determinant of the Scottish fiscal deficit is, not
surprisingly, the deficit in the UK as a whole. In 1993-94, the fiscal
deficit in the UK was at its cyclical peak. Since then, the Government
has introduced new taxes and raised tax rates, while also restraining
public expenditure.
This fiscal tightening is likely to have reduced the Scottish fiscal
deficit just as it has done for the UK as a whole. However -- and this
is perhaps the principal finding in the publication -- the 1993-94
figures suggest that Scotland has a more pronounced structural budget
deficit. This is reflected in the respective shares of the fiscal
deficit in GDP: 15% in Scotland, compared with 8[1/2]% in the UK.

STEPHEN McGINTY finds that the bright lights of Soho have taken on an
even sleazier hues
THE girl in the long silver coat outside Live Girl Peep Show XXX
pointed to Jimmy the joiner next door and said he was my man. ''Can't
shut him up,'' she said.
Jimmy wasn't a joiner but a porn prince. He just looked like a joiner,
the way he wielded his Bosch drill, putting up pieces of plywood to
convert a Soho cupboard into a Nude Encounter.
''Sorry pal, come back tonight, grand opening around seven.''
Grand opening did not seem the right term for a doorway, eight feet by
10 feet, which by evening would contain a doorman's desk and two booths
covered by curtains. The back had little stages, 10 inches high, on
which the girls would strip and gyrate.
I told him I wanted to talk, and strangely so did he.
He talked about being born in Partick, of working as an enforcer for
money-lenders around Anderston, and moving to London five years ago when
two Scottish lads practically ran Soho. It's not like that today. He
said the Maltese owned a number of shops and tried to put him out of
business when he dropped the price of hard-core tapes from #35 to a
tenner.
''The copies were sh**, but just who is going to complain?''
The Maltese did and threatened to torch his premises. Jimmy felt
attack was the best form of defence so, with a couple of Glasgow lads,
he visited their book shop with a vodka bottle stuffed with a rag,
carrying a Zippo lighter. He said they backed down. It sounds dubious.
Jimmy is as wide as his booth is narrow. When he talks about women he is
more believable.
''There are hundreds of Scots girls down here, dozens of Cindys and
Candys from Govan,'' he said. ''And from all those girls I'd say about
80% end up on smack. Most of the dancers here are junkies, but the Scots
are the worst. Don't ask me why. I don't know. The Italians flog it to
them, they get hooked, and so they work.
''The money is sh**. A girl will get about 30 quid for her picture in
the Sunday Sport, so they work in places like this. We charge a quid for
a half a minute, for extras you talk to the girls. You can get anything
bar full sex, just sort out the price . . . these women are hard
tickets, they just want your money.''
Jimmy is talking, smoking and fastening a carpet to the floor. He is
on a roll, grinning. His front teeth are missing. ''It's great when
there is a war on,'' he says loudly.
I don't understand, thinking he means between rival club owners, but,
no, he means a real war. ''We've hundreds of Croats and Serbs just now,
great-lookin' girls. When Hong Kong falls, this place will be packed.
Just wait.''
Soho, in the 1990s, has lost much of its famed bright lights. It is
now a darker place. Material which was once tucked in a back shop or
just under the counter is now openly on display. Punters can preview the
hardest of tapes and youth remains a valued commodity. Dozens of Dutch
tapes involving sex with 16-year-olds are easily available and S &amp; M
magazines are everywhere, women trussed up in titles such as Bound To
Please and Discipline.
A desperate kissogram, in need of money for her children, accepted a
contract photoshoot for a whipping magazine. She was told it was ''just
pretend'', that it would not hurt. ''They beat her so bad she had to buy
a packet of frozen peas to sit on,'' said Ann Mayne, of Campaign Against
Pornography. We talk in a little diner a couple of hundred yards from
Anderston Jimmy's Nude Encounter.
Stripograms and erotic dancers are simply live porn to the women of
CAP. It is all a dangerous subject. Ann explains that weeks before the
woman was beaten, members of a naval party in a pub sodomised her with a
bottle. Police said it was a naval matter. She finally quit the industry
after accepting a role in a hard-core video, then discovering the
storyline involved a mother and teenage daughter.
''Porn has all kinds of PR people who just don't realise they are
doing PR for porn. Like liberal feminists who are strongly pro-porn and
see it as a form of women exploring their sexuality. They feel we are an
anti-sex, pro-censorship group. We are not remotely anti-censorship but
we feel this industry has not been challenged enough. It is absolutely
getting away with murder.''
What would she say to the businessman who collects a couple of
top-shelf magazines?
''He is a sexist bastard. If he gets turned on by seeing women
degraded and humiliated then his sexuality stinks. We know that male
sexuality is linked to the eroticism of power, but we believe that is
not a condition of human nature but one created by the power
imbalance.''
The Scottish chapter of CAP is now disbanded. Before it closed, Ann
said, some members were brought before a Scottish judge, charged with
ram-raiding a store which sold porn. CAP now runs a women's helpline,
Victims of Pornography, for women who have been abused while working in
the industry or by partners under the influence of pornography. It has
resulted in horror stories of incestuous abuse recorded on camcorders.
At seven o'clock Jimmy's Nude Encounter is open. For just #5 you can
slip behind the neat brown curtain and confront the horrors of war. A
20-year-old Croatian girl dances while a tape deck at her feet plays
Madonna's Like A Virgin, offering extras as she begins to tug at her
silk blouse. Her smile is strained.
I make my excuses and leave.

CONSERVATIVE Party chairman Dr Brian Mawhinney yesterday took to the
streets in a 160mph supercar -- only to find his ambitions thwarted by
strict urban speed limits.
The former Transport Secretary could only dream of what might have
been as he went for a sedate 30mph spin in the first road-going version
of the #37,000 TVR Cerbera.
But he was purring in delight as he arrived for a tour of the factory
in Blackpool where TVR hand-builds more than 1000 luxury sports cars
every year for enthusiasts.
''It was very impressive. It is very comfortable and easy to drive,''
he told PA News after the three-mile trip from the Conservative Party
conference headquarters hotel to the factory.
''You are also very conscious of the power that is available but which
you sadly cannot use in a 30mph speed limit.''
Dr Mawhinney was visiting the factory on the eve of the conference to
highlight an example of an export-led business which is flourishing as
the economic recovery gathers strength.

PARIS: A Frenchwoman is within a week of becoming the oldest known
human being at the age of 120 years and 238 days. Jeanne Calment, who
lives in a nursing home in Arles, was born on February 21, 1875. She
will become the oldest person whose date of birth can be authenticated
on October 17, a title previously held by a Japanese man who died in
1986. Asked on her 120th birthday what she expected of the future,
Madame Calment replied: ''A very short one.''

Santo Domingo, Monday
REPORTERS, television crews, and the plain curious flew to the smart
Dominican resort of Casa de Campo today hoping to track down
''bridegroom'' O J Simpson -- but the object of their attention was
nowhere to be found.
The stampede was triggered by yesterday's report in the main daily
newspaper in the capital, Santo Domingo, that Simpson planned to fly to
the Caribbean tourist paradise with his girlfriend, model Paula
Barbieri.
The report said the couple might be planning a wedding at Casa de
Campo, a favourite playground of jetset celebrities.
Simpson was cleared last Tuesday of murdering his former wife Nicole
Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman.
Today his main lawyer Johnnie Cochran flatly denied the marriage
report.
''There's no truth in that at all. I spoke to him yesterday,'' Cochran
said on Sunday. ''He's at home, I think, now, and he's planning the rest
of his life.''
Simpson was not to be seen today in the sprawling resort and a hotel
spokeswoman said he had not made any reservation, at least not in his
own name.
However she pointed out that there are hundreds of privately owned
villas nearby, some the homes of such international celebrities as film
director Dino di Laurentis and fashion designer Oscar de la Renta.
''If he was staying in one of the private villas, we would not
necessarily know,'' she said.
The local newspaper, Listin Diaro -- best known for breaking the story
of Michael Jackson's secret Dominican wedding to Lisa Marie Presley last
year -- appeared to back down on the story tonight.
Beneath a large front-page photo of Simpson and Barbieri, it said
there were no records of a plane carrying the couple having arrived in
the Dominican Republic.--Reuter.

THE night I drove up to interview Sir Alec at his spacious Border
home, I knocked on the door and was surprised to find it being opened by
Sir Alec himself, complete with cardigan and carpet slippers.
The Scottish laird who had become Prime Minister of his beloved
country invited me in with a typical Border welcome and there we sat for
two hours, raking over the story of his remarkable life.
Sir Alec represented the last of a breed of politician who was there
to serve without a single thought of vanity on the horizon.
In Sir Alec's case it was absolutely genuine. For you would have
travelled far to find a more decent and honourable man.
On that windy night, as we sat at his comfortable fireside, I listened
entranced as he charted the politics of the 1930s, his proximity to
Neville Chamberlain as they set off for their historic meeting with
Hitler in 1938 -- and his memory of the Nazi monster himself.
The criticism which eventually descended upon Chamberlain and his
policy of appeasement spilled over, by association, to Sir Alec. In
later years, it became fashionable to portray him as some kind of rural
eccentric.
Yet, when you talked to Sir Alec, you were soon aware of a man of
strong intellect and deep culture, acres away from the bumbling
aristocrat depicted by the satirists.
That brought us to the programme which changed the face of television
in the early 1960s, That Was The Week That Was. Fronted by the youthful
sneer of David Frost, it was the weekly dose of new-style satire which
was both hilarious and cruel.
Sir Alec, who was just taking over as Prime Minister from Mr Harold
Macmillan in 1963, was a natural butt of their less charitable
observations.
When I asked if that had affected him at all, he reluctantly confessed
that it was an annoyance he could well have done without.
Once again, Sir Alec was too much of a gentleman to hit back. The
truth was that he was a man above most of them, an aristocrat in the
best sense of the word, tough, determined, but always kindly and
courteous.
It was his misfortune to come at the tail-end of what became known as
''The 13 years of Tory misrule''. No Prime Minister could have saved the
Conservative Party in 1964.
Sir Alec was a man without an ill streak in his bones. The night I
left the Hirsel, I knew that I had been in the presence of a very
special gentleman.

IT left some observers in awe yesterday as Prime Minister John Major's
car played second fiddle to the limousine of US General Colin Powell
during a visit to 10 Downing Street.
The black general, who is in Britain to promote his new book, A
Soldier's Way, said he would make a decision on whether to run for the
American presidency by the end of next month.
General Powell, 49, who served in the Reagan and Bush administrations
and is regarded as a hero for masterminding the Gulf war campaign, has
yet to decide whether to stand as a Republican or an independent.
Current opinion polls show that General Powell would beat President
Bill Clinton if he were to stand in next year's presidential election.
General Powell said: ''I will have to decide sometime in November at
the latest. It seems to me because of the republican primary system, if
I were to enter the election race as a Republican I would have to start
registering for the New Hampshire primary, for example, in middle
December.
''Sometime in November I have to decide,'' he told the BBC Radio 4
Today programme
He would sit down and make the decision with his family as soon as the
book tour was over.
''I have to stand back and say to myself and sit down with my wife and
ask 'Is this something we want to do with the rest of our lives?'
''There are other options. I could work in charitable or educational
work. I could participate in the American public debate without
necessarily doing it as a politician.
''My whole background is that of a soldier in a structured
environment. My highest ambition was not to become a politician at the
highest level. It was to do my very best in the military.
''But the searching that is going on in my heart and soul right now is
'is this the right thing to do? Can I bring the passion to it that it
requires?'''
He said his wife, Alma, was worried about his safety and the impact a
presidential campaign would have on his family life.
General Powell said the O J Simpson trial revealed a racial chasm in
America, but added that the US gave him opportunities denied to blacks
in Britain.

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth last night put the brakes on plans
for a second road bridge across the Forth.
His predecessor, Mr Ian Lang, announced in January his intention to
take the new bridge plan forward and hold a public local inquiry next
year.
Mr Forsyth said he had given careful consideration to work done since
then on the Government's ''Setting Forth'' transport plans and to the
continuing discussions between Scottish Office and regional council
officials.
Now he has invited leaders of Fife and Lothian regional councils for
fresh talks on the bridge plan and other issues.
''Before we proceed further, I would welcome the opportunity to take
stock with you,'' he told them.
A Scottish Office spokesman said the policy was being reviewed and Mr
Forsyth wanted to have the meeting as soon as possible.

A year in politics turned out to be a short time for Lord Home. John
Macleod looks at the man and his career.
LORD Home of the Hirsel, who died yesterday, was the forgotten Prime
Minister. One has to be nearly 40 years old to remember him in Downing
Street, and he held the premiership for a bare year before losing the
1964 General Election. In those days, of course, he was Sir Alec
Douglas-Home. Names were always a problem for this elegantly upper-crust
politician.
Born in London on July 2, 1903, Alexander Frederick Douglas-Home was
grandson and heir to the 12th Earl of Home. His family had long since
risen above their thuggish Scots Border roots -- ''a bloodthirsty lot;
robber-barons, really'' said Home once -- and the Douglas-Homes were as
thoroughly anglicised as all their class.
Young Lord Dunglass grew to be tall and blond, with an engaging
personality and a passion for cricket, fishing, and shooting. After Eton
and Oxford, politics offered a useful life that fitted in well with such
rural pursuits. He had an innocent conception of noblesse oblige, and
was genuinely horrified by the ravages of unemployment through his
father's Lanarkshire lands in the 1920s.
''There were thousands unemployed in the Lanarkshire burghs, and some
of the men had been out of work continuously for eight years or more . .
. I was a positive supporter of anything that would improve the
industrial well-being of the country,'' he recalled later.
He became Unionist MP for Lanark in 1931: five years later, in 1936,
the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Neville Chamberlain, took him as his
Parliamentary Private Secretary. That October, Dunglass married
Elizabeth Alington, the daughter of his old headmaster, who was to be a
devoted wife until her death in 1990.
But in 1938, when Neville Chamberlain returned from his notorious
meeting with Hitler in Munich declaring ''peace in our time'', the
blunder reflected on his his Parliamentary Private Secretary.
The tragic trip gave the future Prime Minister a fascinating insight
into international diplomacy at a crucial hour in the history of the
twentieth century.
He was present at the meeting between Chamberlain and Hitler, and said
later that the German dictator was ''as near as you could get, I think,
to a totally evil man''.
He added: ''The 'peace in our time' thing was an impromptu statement.
Mr Chamberlain bitterly regretted when he was shoved on to the balcony
at Downing Street. He regretted that the moment he had done it.''
In another interview, Lord Home said: ''In the jostling of a packed
crowd on the stairs in No 10, I heard someone, whose identity I could
not fix, say to Chamberlain 'Neville, go to the window and repeat the
historic words 'Peace with honour'.
''His response was short, even curt. 'No, I do not do that kind of
thing'.
''But Mr Chamberlain was persuaded to say the infamous words.''
Years later, Lord Home was still defending his chief's policy of
appeasement.
''We got war, but also final victory, whereas war in 1938 would have
meant not victory but defeat,'' he said.
But in May 1940, his life seemed in ruins. Chamberlain was ousted and
dying, and appeasement a swear-word. Furthermore, Dunglass himself was
seriously ill. Tuberculosis of the spine was diagnosed and, after
surgery, he spent two years in plaster-cast immobility.
He recovered completely, but the enforced rest had profoundly affected
him. He had done much reading, especially on Marxism and foreign
affairs, and when he returned to the Commons in 1944, he made a speech
attacking Russian expansionism into Poland and warning of the communist
threat to Eastern Europe -- described later by one historian as ''the
first true expression of the post-war era.''
Deep loathing of communism was to be a primary strand in his political
career. But another was his deep and simple Christian faith,
strengthened by his illness, and thereafter making him one of the most
overtly pious British politicians of the century. His speeches and books
are laced with religious observations.
In 1951, his father died and Dunglass became 14th Earl of Home. That
October, the Conservatives regained power, and thereafter Home's
progress in statesmanship was rapid. At the Scottish Office, he proved a
capable Minister of State, producing some useful legislation, and when
Anthony Eden succeeded Churchill in June 1955, Home was his surprise
choice as Commonwealth Secretary.
''I suspected he had significant diplomatic gifts and that there was
much to be said for giving him a chance now to display them,'' Eden
later wrote. Suddenly, Home was in the Cabinet: he had never been to a
Commonwealth country in his life.
Eden fell in 1957, but Macmillan made Home Tory Leader in the Lords.
In 1960 -- despite considerable criticism for putting a peer in the post
-- he appointed Home as Foreign Secretary.
It was perhaps the high point of his career. He gained public
popularity for his forthrightness. He adopted a much less conciliatory
line with Moscow than had been fashionable, and became an outspoken
critic of the ''anti-Western bias'' of the United Nations.
Yet he also advocated -- to the horror of Washington -- communist
China's right to United Nations membership, and urged American caution
in south-east Asia.
But nothing in Home's career was as controversial as his accession to
the premiership. In October 1963, Macmillan, suddenly taken ill,
resigned in the middle of the Conservative Party conference at
Blackpool, and plunged the gathered Tories into a three-ring circus.
Macmillan's deputy, R A Butler, desperately sought the office he had
been twice denied. But Macmillan favoured Lord Hailsham, Leader in the
Lords since 1960; he would have to resign his peerage, but enabling
legislation had just reached the Statute Book. And there were younger
aspirants: Reggie Maudling, Iain Macleod, Ted Heath.
As Hailsham's horse began to weaken, Macmillan's thoughts turned to
Home. Butler -- whom he loathed -- had to be stopped. Yet the Government
needed unity. The gracious and amiable earl was the obvious candidate.
And so the men-in-suits met, and talked, and rang their constituencies,
and on October 18, 1963, Macmillan advised the Queen to invite Home to
form a government. There was then no mechanism for electing a Tory
leader while the party was in office: a ''magic circle'' had decided.
Home could only have been stopped if Butler and a sufficient number of
colleagues had refused to serve. In the event, they eyed each other
nervously, sighed, and dutifully accepted office in Home's government.
Only Iain Macleod and Enoch Powell refused, and returned to the back
benches.
The Tories had been in office for 12 years: they were tired, divided,
and completely demoralised. National hysteria greeted the ''emergence''
of the vague, tweedy, grinning Earl of Home as the most improbable of
Prime Ministers. ''After half a century of democratic advance, the whole
process has ground to a halt with a 14th earl,'' orated the opposition
leader, Harold Wilson.
''I suppose Mr Wilson, when you come to think of it, is the 14th Mr
Wilson,'' replied Home cuttingly. ''Are we to say that all men are
equal, except peers?'' Two days later, he resigned his titles -- six in
all, which may now be revived by his son -- and as Sir Alec
Douglas-Home, Prime Minister without a seat in either House, fought and
won a by-election in the then Kinross and West Perthshire seat.
''From this moment on,'' he said when he was formally adopted as party
leader a few days later, ''the fact that there is a General Election
ahead of us must never be out of our minds . . . The one thing that
matters is that this country should be saved from socialism and that a
Conservative government should be returned.'' In the face of enormous
Labour leads in the opinion polls, it seemed a faint hope indeed.
Almost the only thing of note achieved by the Douglas-Home government
was the abolition of resale price maintenance, a long overdue reform
which alienated hundreds of traditionally Tory shopkeepers. For the rest
of his life, Home believed it had cost him the election, though he nobly
insisted that right had to triumph over expediency.
Labour did win, but by only four seats, and some of these by tiny
margins. But the abolition of RPM was not the only factor. Home had
other serious liabilities: a style completely at odds with the mood of
the age -- more Lord Palmerston than Paul McCartney -- and a penchant
for slips of the tongue that made him look silly.
Most of all, he was not good on television. Addresses to the nation
were an ordeal that left him rigid and shaking. The badly managed Tory
campaign -- Sir Alec invariably filmed addressing rowdy public meetings,
instead of carefully vetted gatherings of the Tory faithful -- sent
images of a Prime Minister besieged by angry crowds across the land.
That Was The Week That Was attacked him mercilessly: David Frost
lecturing him in the persona of Disraeli, Bernard Levin dismissing him
as a ''cretin and an imbecile''. Screamingly daring at the time, but
markedly unfunny today.
After the by-election loss of a Tory Borders seat to the Liberals --
in his own back-yard -- Home was quietly manoeuvred into resigning the
leadership in July 1965. When Heath led the party back to power in 1970,
Home served him as Foreign Secretary, climaxing with the successful
negotiation of British entry to the Common Market. He retired from
office and the Commons at the October 1974 election, and was granted a
life-peerage: becoming the first Baron Home of the Hirsel.
Just once, in March 1979, he returned to political controversy --
making an ill-advised television appeal to Scots to ''vote no for a
better Act'' on the eve of the devolution referendum. Home genuinely
sought some form of Scottish assembly, and his manipulation in 1979
visibly weakened his enthusiasm for Margaret Thatcher.
His term as Prime Minister was too short for him to make any
significant impact on office or nation. But he had been handed a nearly
impossible assignment -- to unite the shattered Conservative Party and
win a looming General Election -- and very nearly pulled it off.
He had been a highly effective Foreign Secretary, and in retirement
was held in widespread affection and regard. It was hard not to love a
former Prime Minister who could write in Border Reflections (1979):
''One mallard at the Hirsel made a habit of nesting year after year in
the fork of a lime tree some 400 yards from the lake . . . In my year at
No 10 Downing Street, a mallard duck nested in some low hypericum just
outside the Cabinet room. Eventually she left by the back door, and so,
a little later, did I.''
Lord Home is survived by a son and three daughters.

TRIBUTES were pouring in last night to Lord Home.Prime Minister John
Major said he and his wife had learned of the death with great sadness,
and that Lord Home had personified the quiet dignity of a Scottish
gentleman.
Mr Major said: ''He was understated and often underestimated, but his
wealth of knowledge, his keen intellect and his deep patriotism all
combined in a lifetime of public service.
''He was always conscious of the obligations his position placed upon
him, which showed through in a genuine concern for the welfare of the
whole nation. Alec inspired great loyalty and respect from those around
him. His family and friends will remember him with deep affection.''
Labour Leader Tony Blair said: ''The whole country will be saddened at
the loss of a man who served Britain for so long. He loved his country
and was a man of great integrity and great compassion.''
Buckingham Palace said the Queen had been informed of Lord Home's
death and had sent a private message to his family.
Former Prime Minister Baroness Thatcher said: ''Integrity shone out of
Alec Douglas-Home. Everyone trusted and admired him. His supreme
courtesy and humanity were matched by strength and purpose and
clear-sighted action. He saw the evils of Communism, which he never
ceased to fight.
''He would also listen to his fellow MPs and try to correct an
injustice. He represented all that was best in his generation -- a
perfect gentleman who used his great talents in the service of his
country and her people.''
In a lengthy tribute, Sir Edward Heath selected Lord Home's
determination, trustworthiness and loyalty as the keys to his political
career.
Sir Edward served under Lord Home as Trade and Industry Secretary, and
appointed him Shadow Foreign Secretary on taking over the leadership in
1965. He said: ''Alec Douglas-Home was a very distinguished man, greatly
respected and much loved.''
Despite his brief period as Premier, Lord Home might be better
remembered for his work in the field of foreign affairs, particularly
his support for entry into the European Community and work with the
Commonwealth, said Sir Edward.
''He made his mark as Secretary of State for the Commonwealth and then
as Foreign Secretary, and he was completely trusted by everyone with
whom he was dealing.''
Sir Edward did not play down Lord Home's effectiveness as Prime
Minister, stating: ''He had to organise the election from the low
position at which the party found itself. He was successful. He never
got enough credit for it, because we almost won the 1964 election.''
He added: ''He was always very determined in carrying his policies
through. In many ways he was unusual. He always wrote his speeches in
his own hand, which is unusual for modern politicians. Sir Edward said
Lord Home ''adored Scotland and always wanted to see it given the
greatest possible freedom in its arrangements politically''.
Former Labour Prime Minister Lord Callaghan said: ''He devoted his
whole life to public service, though he was Prime Minister for only a
year when the Conservative Government ran out of time. He did not have
time to prove his own worth as Prime Minister, though he was most at
home in international and Commonwealth affairs.
''He held strong political opinions, always expressed with courtesy
that never caused personal offence. He was a very modest man, with
little patience for the sort of hype and soundbite style of today's
politics.''
Former Liberal Leader Sir David Steel said: ''Alec Douglas-Home was
one of the last of the gentleman politicians who had no other motivation
than public service.
''Since my by-election victory in the spring of 1965 was used as a
lever to end his leadership of the Conservative Party, I especially
valued his words to me on arrival in the House of Commons: 'I am
naturally sorry to see you here, but now that you are I wish you
well'.''
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said: ''Lord Home was one
of the most significant Scots of this century, serving as both Prime
Minister and Foreign Secretary. He was one of the last 'One Nation'
Conservatives and, whatever his role in the 1979 referendum, he did
believe in more devolution to Scotland. At home and abroad, he had a
major impact on events and his place in history is assured.''
Sir Michael Hirst, chairman of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist
Party, said: ''He served party, Government and country with great
distinction, first as a Scottish MP and then as a Minister in successive
governments.
''He was Foreign Secretary at a critical time for the United Kingdom
prior to becoming Prime Minister and leader of the Conservative Party in
1962. Inheriting a demoralised parliamentary party, he quickly
galvanised its fortunes and almost achieved the then unthinkable victory
at the 1964 General Election.
''Above all, Alec Home was thoroughly down to earth, warm,
approachable and unstuffy. He exemplified the finest qualities of a
Scot.''
Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond paid tribute to a man he
described as the last senior Tory from Scotland to have had a ''real
resonance'' with the Scottish people.
His ''laid-back and non-confrontational'' style had struck a chord
with the Scottish people, said Mr Salmond.
''He once said he was a Scottish nationalist in his heart but a
Conservative in his head.
''Although I disagreed with his politics, that type of comment
indicates why he was held in such high regard in Scotland,'' added Mr
Salmond.
Lord Home was honorary life president of Roxburgh and Berwickshire
Conservative Association.
The association chairman, Colonel Colin Hogg, said: ''What a true
Borders gentleman he was. A person who was always approachable to give
one sound advice.
''His contribution to both his country and indeed to the Borders over
the years has been immense and he will be a very, very sad loss.
''It did not matter if you were a local gillie or a peer of the realm
of whatever, he was the same to everybody.''
Alastair Brown-Scott, chairman of the Coldstream branch of the party,
who had known Lord Home for many years, said: ''You could describe him
as one of nature's gentlemen. He was one of the nicest people you could
meet.
''It was the way he dealt with people, you and he were on the same
planet, not like some gentry. He was perfectly natural whenever you met
him and always took time to chat to you.''
Enoch Powell said: ''Though I refused to sit in his Cabinet in 1963, I
always regarded Alec as that rarest thing in politics -- a politician
whose word one could trust.''
Lord Hailsham, who was one of Lord Home's opponents for the Tory
leadership in 1963, said: ''He was quite reluctant to be Prime Minister,
but he did enjoy being at the Foreign Office.''
Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said: ''I have been deeply saddened
to hear of Lord Home's death.
''Although a former Prime Minister, his greatest contribution to his
country may have been in the two terms he served as Foreign Secretary.
''He was a wise and experienced statesman whose gentle manner
concealed a toughness, skill and determination that often carried the
day. His country has every reason to be proud of him and to mourn his
passing.''

Renault 21 broke down on the Coaltown of Balgonie to Kinglassie Road at
about 1pm on September 18, to contact them. Detectives believe they
might have clues which would help in the hunt for a man who abducted two
teenage girls after offering them a lift from Glenrothes College, and
drove through Kirkcaldy district before attacking them in a wood at

LABOUR leader Tony Blair's barrister wife yesterday defended a
Conservative council's controversial ''staff tests'' to reduce its
workforce.
Ms Cherie Booth, QC, caused a storm by representing Brent Council,
north-west London, against 55 sacked workers at an industrial tribunal.
Union leaders were shocked after Miss Booth decided to take up the
defence for Brent Council in a case that could last nearly three months
and earn her at least #100,000.
In a polished and fluent performance, she claimed it was the council's
policy to employ only the best staff for the job.
She added that tests implemented towards the end of 1992 were fair and
objective.
She said: ''It was important to select only the best staff for the job
and, if necessary, to use a scoring system to achieve this.
''The applicants in this case scored the lowest in the tests and were
consequently made redundant.
''There was absolutely no discrimination whatsoever and there was no
biased marking. The tests were designed in 1947 and were since updated
and have been widely used.
''They were administered in a reasonable way and the overwhelming
majority of staff who took them passed.
''In interviews taken after the tests, the interviewers paid attention
to the content of what the candidate said and not the way it was
delivered.''
Earlier, Ms Booth was jovially ticked off by tribunal chairwoman Mrs
Marjorie Don when she tried to rearrange some heavy tables in the room.
Mrs Don said: ''Let a big strong man do that.'' The comment drew howls
of laughter from everyone in the room except Ms Booth, who remained
straight-faced.
The 55 applicants, mainly black and Asian, are claiming they were
unfairly dismissed, some on racial grounds, during a purge by the
council on its workforce which began three years ago.
The hearing was adjourned until today.

POISON placed in the two Safeway supermarket bottles at the centre of
a major public health scare could kill, it was revealed yesterday as the
search for the contaminated drinks intensified.
The disclosure came from senior detectives who announced their worst
fears over the bottles, alleged to have been tampered with at the
company's Morningside store in Edinburgh, had been confirmed.
Detective Superintendent John McGowan, heading the investigation,
said: ''Our original assessment was it may have happened. We are now
saying it is believed that it has happened.''
He said that through store film and till receipts for the products and
the poison, they were able to say the man who had alleged the bottles
had been contaminated had been in the premises.
Mr McGowan, who would not identify the poison alleged to have been put
into two one-litre bottles of Robinsons Apple and Blackcurrant
concentrate, said its effects would start from the low threshold of
nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea.
''The worst possible case is renal failure and if drunk in sufficient
quantities perhaps death.''
The Morningside store is only a few miles from another of the
company's premises that was involved in a contaminated tonic water probe
earlier this year.
Mr McGowan told a press conference the information relating to the
Morningside store had come from a man taken into custody on Saturday in
relation to a separate offence.
On one of the bottles, the cap was removed and replaced without the
safety seal being broken. On the other, the seal was slightly damaged.
Mr McGowan said it was absolutely essential to warn members of the
public who purchased these bottles since last Monday to contact the
police Helpline.
It has been established that 73 bottles were sold between the Monday
and Saturday. Last night, police said 43 bottles had now been returned.
Forensic scientists are presently testing them but so far none has shown
signs of being contaminated.
A total of 79 people have contacted the Helpline -- 0131 311 3535 --
over the weekend.
Mr McGowan, who headed the poisoned tonic water inquiry that led to
East Lothian university lecturer Paul Agutter being jailed for 12 years
for a plot to murder his wife, said it was not in the public interest to
identify the poison.
He said information had been passed to Lothian Health Board and all
GPs and emergency services in Lothian and further afield.
The detective stressed there was no threat to any other store product
or any other store.
A poster campaign warning the public about the 73 bottles of ordinary
concentrate and sugar-free ''Special R'' juice was launched yesterday.

SOCIAL security officials have cut benefits to a disabled child
because they insist money raised for her treatment counts as her
savings.
Teresa and Kevin Austen, of Millbank Road, Dingwall, are the parents
of two-year-old Chelsey, who suffers from brain damage and cannot walk
or talk. The family of eight have lost #28 a week through the DSS
decision.
A public appeal, helped by stars such as Wet Wet Wet and Rod Stewart,
has raised #10,000, allowing the Austens to buy Chelsey specialist
treatment and equipment which the NHS had refused to fund.
But there is still #4900 in the fund and the Benefits Agency has told
the Austens she cannot claim benefit because the savings total more than
#3000. The fund is administered by a trust and the family do not have
direct access to it.
The Ross, Cromarty, and Skye Liberal Democrat MP, Mr Charles Kennedy,
intends taking up the case next Monday when Parliament resumes.
A DSS spokesman said the case would be referred to its central
adjudication service.
''We are trying to be as fair as we can, but we have to ensure we
adhere to the regulations,'' the spokesman said.

FOOD manufactures are to join a supermarket chain in promising to look
at ways of reducing the amount of fat in food in a bid to tackle the
country's increasing obesity problem.
The move came after an announcement yesterday from the Co-op that it
is to display the fat and calorie content on the front of all its
products. The new labelling will also give details of trans-fatty acids,
which are linked with heart disease.
The Food and Drink Federation, which represents around 800
manufacturers, said it would publish a report on the fat content of
foods later this week, which will identify ways of reducing the amount
of fat in a wide range of products.
As the first retailer to put clear fat and calorie labels on the front
of products, the Co-op said it intended to look at ways of reducing the
fat content of ready-made meals.
However, spokesman Martin Henderson conceded that with hundreds of
suppliers, and commercial pressures not to radically alter taste,
reducing fat in other products would be a lengthy process.
Both the Co-op -- which has 165 stores in Scotland -- and the
federation said they had taken the initiative in the wake of rising
concern over the state of the nation's health and the growing numbers of
overweight people.
A leaked report by Government experts, Reversing the Increasing
Problem of Obesity, predicts that obesity is set to soar by 50% in the
next 10 years.
By the year 2005, a quarter of British women and 18% of men will be
obese. The report blames the high fat content of food and a general
decline in physical activity.
The Co-op's crusading stance was greeted with some surprise by
supermarket Sainsbury's, which pointed out that it had given customers
additional information about food fat and calorie content for the past
year.

SKYE and Lochalsh District Council yesterday voted to boycott Monday's
official opening of the #23m Skye bridge by Scottish Secretary Michael
Forsyth.
In a further move against the imposition of high tolls on the bridge,
Scottish Liberal Democrat MP Charles Kennedy said yesterday he would
circulate a draft Commons' Early Day Motion to all Scottish MPs, seeking
majority support against the tolls.
In moving the council boycott motion, Councillor Gavin Moncrieff
described the toll structure as ''a mafia-type extortion system'' and
said the bridge was developed without consultation.
''I think we should make it quite clear to this Tory Government that
they did not consult the people of Skye when considering this bridge or
its toll structure,'' Mr Moncrieff said.
''When we as a council tried to have meaningful dialogue with them
over improved access to Skye, they did not listen.''
The Conservative Party, by imposing a toll, had broken a promise to
the people of Skye, he said.
''This is the same Tory party that promised, in their election
manifesto of 1979, to remove the tolls from all of Scotland's bridges
and introduce RET (Road Equivalent Tariff) on all our island ferries,''
Mr Moncrieff said.
''When they came to power, they quickly dropped all that and they are
now imposing a ferry equivalent tariff on a public road bridge.''
Not only was the proposed toll the highest in the world but it would
increase by 25% in the summer months, he said.
Opposition to the boycott came from Councillor John Angus MacKay.
''Are we not in danger of giving ourselves an importance that we don't
really have?'' Mr MacKay said. ''I don't know how many of us received an
invitation to the opening. I don't know if any of my colleagues got one.
I certainly didn't.
''If we are saying we are going to cause a huge embarrassment by not
going, we won't -- because we are not that important.''
A show of hands before the vote revealed invitations had been sent to
council chairman John Munro, chief executive David Noble, and Portree
councillor Drew Miller, who is also on the new single-tier Highland
Council.
Councillors voted 8-2 in favour of the boycott.

A SCOTTISH council has been accused of carrying out unnecessary
repairs to keep its employees in a job.
It is also claimed the public works department of Dundee District
Council charged tenants double the commercial cost for the repairs.
Last night, a Tory MP demanded an inquiry into the running of the
Labour-controlled council's public works department.
The claims were made after the 500-member Dundee Association of
Council House Owners (DACHO) announced it would take the district
council to the Lands Tribunal.
The owners want to scrap a controversial clause in their title deeds
which allows the council to order repairs which the owners claim are
overpriced and, in some cases, unnecessary.
In one example, owners of former council houses in Murrayfield
Terrace, Dundee, were each sent bills of more than #1000 for roof work
carried out by the council.
A private contracting firm called in by the householders has claimed
the work could have been done for only #518 per flat.
Mr David Robertson, project director with Dundee roofing firm
Eavesclad, examined the work at the block of four flats on behalf of
DACHO.
''I personally inspected the roof at Murrayfield Terrace and there was
no problem at all with it,'' Mr Robertson said. ''There had been no
complaints made by the residents. The council decided to replace it
anyway.
Mr Robertson claimed the work was carried out on the houses as part of
a make-work scheme to keep public-works employees in a job.
Last night, Mr Bill Walker, Conservative MP for North Tayside, called
for an investigation into Dundee District Council's public works
department.
The row will move to the Lands Tribunal where owners of former council
houses will argue their titles deny them basic human rights. The titles
contain a clause under which the council retains the authority to order
repairs by its approved contractors even if there is only one
council-owned property in the tenement block.
Council administration leader Ms Kate Maclean said it was nonsense to
suggest work was undertaken to maintain jobs.
''Although tenants who have bought their homes accept conditions that
the council may carry out mutual repairs, it is not a case of the
council doing what it wants as far as these are concerned,'' Ms Maclean
said.
''The council has a duty to the public purse to ensure repairs are
carried out only when they are necessary and at competitive prices and
that work is placed through the tendering process.''

DETECTIVES were last night investigating a rape attack on an Edinburgh
woman within a mile of the spot where a prostitute was found murdered at
the weekend.
The 23-year-old woman was assaulted at about 3am yesterday as she
walked through a car park behind Duke Street, Leith, less than 48 hours
after the body of Ms Christine Dinnie, 40, from the city's Craigmillar
area, was discovered in West Bowling Green Street on Saturday morning.
Police said yesterday that it was too soon to say whether the rape and
the murder were linked, but they made it clear that the rape victim was
not a prostitute.
Her attacker had pushed her against a bottle bank waste bin, telling
her he had a knife, then assaulted her.
The woman suffered a broken wrist and bruising in the attack, but
fought back. She told police that she believed that she had bitten his
left cheek and might have scratched his face during the struggle.
''A bite mark and scratches to the left side of his face should be
easily noticeable,'' a police spokesman said in an appeal to the public
to help trace the man.
The attacker was white, in his late 30s, about 5ft 9in, with dark,
collar-length hair, and several days' stubble. He was wearing a blue
zipped jacket with side pockets, jeans, and dark shoes, and spoke with
an Edinburgh accent.
Detectives investigating the murder of Ms Dinnie are appealing to men
who had contact with her to come forward.

LABOUR and the STUC have failed to resolve differences over the gender
make-up of a Scottish Parliament. Their embarrassing row over equal
representation of men and women will now go to the wire.
Final details of a devolved parliament are due to be unveiled by the
Scottish Constitutional Convention on October 20. But no formal
agreement was reached at yesterday's urgent, conciliatory meeting
between Labour and the STUC, whose general secretary later declined even
to ''hazard a guess at what the final outcome would be''.
It also emerged that the Tories and the SNP were unlikely to go along
with any Labour-STUC deal which might arise before the convention's
crucial meeting a week on Friday.
The STUC's general council last week said Labour's proposal to have
just 129 members in a Scottish Parliament was unacceptable, especially
because of concern that it would not bring about an equal representation
of the sexes.
Labour leader Tony Blair subsequently accused the STUC of immaturity
in opposing the figure, which was struck in a personal deal by Shadow
Scottish Secretary George Robertson and Scottish Liberal Democrat leader
Jim Wallace.
Twelve of the 38-strong STUC general council yesterday met Mr
Robertson and Labour's Scottish secretary, Mr Jack McConnell, in a bid
to defuse the row. The Labour representatives not only underlined the
party's commitment to gender equality but said a 129-strong parliament
was sensible, realistic, and would achieve proportionality.
Mr Robertson added that the ''misunderstanding'' had been cleared up
and it was hoped the October 20 meeting would lead to a Scottish
Parliament.
However, STUC general secretary Campbell Christie interpreted the
talks differently. At no point did he concede that matters of concern
had been been resolved.
Labour, he said, would now submit a letter outlining the party's
position to be put to a recalled STUC general council. The document
would be considered along with information gleaned from a meeting with
the Liberal Democrats on Thursday.
Mr Christie, who accepted that Labour had formally rejected an STUC
request for a larger parliament, said: ''It may be inconvenient to the
media that we do not make instant decisions, but that is the reality of
the democratic procedures that we follow.''
Mr Christie, who last week said Labour's proposal for 129 members was
unacceptable, refused to say if the party's position, as underlined
yesterday, was ''acceptable''. He argued that that would be for the
general council to decide.
Mr Robertson, in stark contrast to Mr Blair's tough intervention last
week, said the STUC had displayed ''sense and maturity'' at yesterday's
meeting.
The STUC and Labour will now approach the Tories and SNP to clarify
their positions in light of the Labour and Liberal Democrat agreement
over how many members a Scottish parliament should have. Their response
is unlikely to do anything for the cause.
The Conservatives will not be signatories to the agreement because
they believe gender quotas are an ''insult'' to women. They say that
seats should go to people on ability, not their sex.
The Tories are also fundamentally against devolution. That position
would be reconsidered only if a Scottish Parliament happened. They
believe it will not.
The SNP, seeking an independent parliament rather than one ''on a
Westminster string'', declined to comment.

A HUSBAND and wife who rescued a dog in Israel were fined yesterday
after pleading guilty to smuggling it through the Channel Tunnel.
Graydon Denn, 29, and his wife Tamar, 20, pleaded guilty to bringing
the dog, Balak, into Britain on a Eurostar train.
They said customs officers in France allowed them to board the train
with the animal and simply wished them good luck.
The couple, of Weavers Way, Camden, north London, were each fined #400
and each ordered to pay #100 costs at Horseferry Road Magistrates Court.
The dog was discovered in a plastic holdall carried by Mrs Denn at
Waterloo international terminal on October 1.
Mr Paul Chadha, prosecuting on behalf of the Corporation of London,
told the court the dog was later found to have been vaccinated against
rabies while it was in Israel.
Mr Denn, an artist, told the magistrate: ''I rescued the dog from a
litter of puppies in Jerusalem. The owner wasn't in a position to keep
any of the puppies and was going to have them destroyed and he asked me
if I would take one and I said I would.
''I have had her since she was about two weeks' old.''
Magistrate Geoffrey Breem warned the couple that the offence, the
first of its kind in the tunnel, carried a maximum fine of #5000. ''It
is a serious offence. There are very good reasons for the prohibition on
bringing animals into this country.
''While I quite understand your attachment to that animal, I am afraid
I am here to uphold that prohibition and to punish you for the
offence.''
After the case, Mr Denn admitted: ''It was a very stupid thing we did.
We broke the law, we have been punished for it.''
He said the animal would be flown back to Israel and looked after by
friends because they did not want it pining in a British quarantine unit
for six months.

A SERIAL sex attacker was sent to Broadmoor high security hospital for
an indefinite period yesterday after he admitted slashing to death and
mutilating Dundee-born Samantha Bisset and suffocating her young
daughter.
Scotland Yard disclosed that detectives were keeping an open mind on
whether there were links between the case and the murder of Rachel
Nickell on Wimbledon Common.
In court yesterday, Robert Napper, 29, pled not guilty to the murders
of Samantha Bisset, 28, and her four-year-old daughter, Jazmine, in
November 1993, but guilty to their manslaughter on grounds of diminished
responsibility.
He also admitted two attempted rapes and a rape in the previous year
-- pleas which were accepted by Mr Justice Hooper at the Old Bailey.
Up until yesterday, Napper had maintained he had not committed the
crimes, claiming it was the work of someone else with the same
fingerprints and DNA.
Mr Justice Hopper said Napper's psychiatrists had reported he ''posed
a grave and immediate risk to the public''.
One psychiatric report had said he would need to be detained ''for
many years'' and that he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. He
was paranoid, had grandiose delusions, and felt he might be able to read
people's minds.
Napper was impassive as he was led to cells flanked by psychiatric
nurses from Broadmoor where he is already an in-patient. However, he was
visibly upset when his counsel William Clegg, QC, said one psychiatrist
believed Napper tried to conceal ''the madness within him''.
Napper, a warehouseman, had already raped one woman and attempted to
rape two others in the same part of London when he got into the Bissets'
one-bedroom basement flat in Plumstead.
First, he killed Samantha by stabbing her eight times in the neck in
her hallway. Then he sexually assaulted and suffocated Jazmine in her
bed, Mr Nigel Sweeney, prosecuting, told the court.
He then dragged Samantha's body into the living-room and on to a
cushion. There he cut open her chest and abdomen, severing the chest
bone, and continued to mutilate her body extensively before trying to
sever her right leg and cutting the left leg. He took away a piece of
her abdomen ''apparently as a trophy'', said Mr Sweeney.
Her body was found by her boyfriend, Mr Conrad Ellam, when he called
on a routine visit to the flat the following morning, the court was
told.
Mr Sweeney said Napper had committed three sex attacks on young women
while they were walking in open public places in south London the
previous year.
On March 10, 1992, armed with a lock knife, he attempted to rape one
woman as she walked through an alley. He forced her behind garages and,
when she resisted, beat her up before escaping.
Eight days later, he attacked another woman at knifepoint as she took
a shortcut across a field. She avoided angering him and was not beaten
up, said Mr Sweeney.
Both women identified Napper at identity parades. He was also
identified by scientific tests on his semen, the court was told.
Two months later, he attacked another woman, who was pushing her
two-year-old daughter in a buggy, by putting a ligature around her
throat. When she resisted she was badly beaten and raped next to her
daughter.
Seventeen months later, he climbed on to a balcony at the rear of
Samantha Bisset's home and entered through an open rear door.
After Napper was led from court, Detective Superintendent Michael
Banks said that throughout the inquiry he had liaised with officers
involved in the Wimbledon Common murder of Rachel Nickell. However, he
added it was not for him to say whether or not that squad was going to
interview Napper about that murder.
Like Rachel, Samantha was a beautiful blonde young woman and had a
small child.
Mr Banks said Samantha had been hoping to get modelling work. Her
murder and that of her daughter were amongst the worst cases he had
dealt with in a 30-year police career.
A woman police photographer who arrived to take pictures of the
horrific scene was so shocked by the carnage that she had not returned
to work since, said Mr Banks.
He said Napper had been caught through ''hard work by a totally
dedicated police team''.
Napper's fingerprints, found at the murder scene, had not been matched
to police records for five months because his previous convictions were
for minor matters -- theft and possessing a firearm -- and not of a
sexual nature, said Mr Banks.
Police still want to question Napper about the missing parts of
Samantha's body, he said.
''We believe he had hidey-holes where he hid things,'' said Mr Banks.
All Napper's sex attack victims were receiving counselling, as was
Samantha's boyfriend, he said.
Mr Banks described Napper as a loner who had never had a girlfriend
and had suffered from mental problems but nothing that required hospital
treatment.

THE mother of Samantha Bisset collapsed and died at the weekend ''of a
broken heart'' just 48 hours before Robert Napper admitted the horrific
killing of her daughter and granddaughter.
Mrs Maggie Morrison, 53, had only been home, at Crawton, near
Stonehaven, for five minutes after a holiday in Sorrento when she
collapsed.
Last night, her husband Jack, Samantha's stepfather, demanded that
Napper never be released and that psychiatrists be ''completely removed
from the judicial system''.
Mr Morrison, who owns the North Eastern Slating and Building Company,
said: ''He got away with the manslaughter of two lovely girls because of
diminished responsibility but he murdered them and should be locked up
for the rest of his life.
''In a few years' time, some stupid psychiatrist could say that Mr
Napper has recovered and he could be released. I don't think justice has
been done. There should be no chances taken.''
Mr Morrison plans to campaign to ensure that no-one who takes a life
is released from prison.
He said of Napper: ''I loathe the man. He killed Maggie just as surely
as he killed Samantha and Jazmine.''
He confessed that he had initially felt like trying to take a gun to
court in an effort to kill the man who butchered Samantha and suffocated
four-year-old Jazmine but decided that taking a life for a life was not
right.
Mr Morrison added: ''Maggie died of a broken heart. She was just 53 --
a young woman. I married her eight years ago and had known her for 10
years. Her first husband, Samantha's father, died of cancer.
''Since the murder of Samantha and Jazmine, she had been on
medication. Sometimes she was great and sometimes she was down. You
never really know how sad a person is feeling inside even if they seem
all right.''
Mr Morrison said they had enjoyed a two-week holiday in Sorrento and
had arrived back in Glasgow on Friday night.
''We had only been home five minutes when she suffered a seizure and
died,'' he said. ''I have no doubt it was the mental and physical strain
of the killings which caused it.''
He said his wife was aware of the impending court case. His
84-year-old father has now joined Mr Morrison to support him. ''It is
all too much,'' he said. ''The loss of Samantha and Jazmine, the loss of
Maggie, and now the court case.
''When everything has settled down, I will be contacting my MP and
campaigning to ensure that people who kill are locked up for life.''
Samantha Bisset was a restless ''free spirit'' who abandoned her
middle-class roots to take to the road as a New Age traveller before
settling in London with her baby daughter.
Born in Dundee, she spent most of her early years in London until the
death of her father, an artist.
She then returned to Scotland with her mother but travelled widely,
spending several months exploring Europe and, in the eighties,
occasionally joining the so-called peace convoy to make pilgrimages to
Stonehenge. She spent some time at a commune near Drumlithie, south of
Aberdeen.
Mr Morrison described his step-daughter as ''a lovely girl who cared
about others''. He made a public appeal for help in catching the killer
after Samantha's body was found in her flat in Plumstead, London, by her
boyfriend Conrad Ellam in November 1993.
Tall, slim, and blonde, Samantha was well-spoken, well educated, and
was, according to her friend Anthonia Hill, ''a friend anyone would like
to have''.
In 1989, she gave up her nomadic lifestyle after giving birth to her
daughter.
Little Jazmine Jemima -- known as JJ -- became the centre of
Samantha's life. She devoted herself to giving her daughter a stable
upbringing and a good education.

MANAGEMENT and senior medical staff at an NHS trust-controlled
hospital have defended the standard of care they provide following
criticisms by a junior doctor.
Dr Anila Reddy, a house officer in the paediatric department at
Raigmore Hospital, Inverness, claimed cost-cutting measures by Scottish
NHS trustshad cost lives.
He also claimed that staffing levels at Raigmore were too low and
could not cope with busy days.
The trust, in a joint statement from management and senior staff, said
there had been an increase in staff during the year up to the end of
March this year, from 1601 to 1680.
This has included the appointment of eight consultants. More junior
medical staff worked at the hospital now and the range of specialist
services had been expanded, the trust said.
''Raigmore continues to strive to provide high-quality services to the
people of the Highlands,'' the statement said.
''We would wish to ensure that the comments made by this junior doctor
are not taken out of context and do not damage public confidence in
Raigmore Hospital.''
They said Dr Reddy's ''negative comments'' related mainly to the NHS
in general and not specifically to Raigmore.
Dr Reddy had said: ''It is all about money these days and the people
in charge of budgets are not necessarily good managers.''
He said people should sue hospitals if they believed relatives died as
a result of poor care.
Dr Reddy also criticised staffing levels at Raigmore: ''They are set
to deal with the workload of an average day but there are between 10 and
20 extremely busy days every year which we simply cannot cope with.''
* Staff at Grampian Healthcare, including two nurses, are to shadow
chief executive Jeremy Taylor for a day to see why he merits a #26,000
pay rise, which is almost double the salary of some nurses and health
workers.
There was a public outcry when it was revealed that Mr Taylor's salary
had risen by more than 30% to #101,000 at a time when many staff were
fighting for a 3% increase.
Mr Taylor defended the increase, saying he deserved it.
''There is a lot of curiosity about exactly what a chief executive
does and by allowing staff to shadow me I hope to allow some of that
curiosity to be satisfied,'' he said.

Redundant council executive lands post with a #24,000 rise.
A REDUNDANT council chief executive, who is to receive a large
pay-off, revealed yesterday that consultants hired by his employers had
found him a new job in local government with a #24,000 increase in
salary.
Mr Rory Mair, 38, earns #46,000-a-year with Ross and Cromarty District
Council but would have been out of work with the change to single-tier
authorities after failing to find a job with the new Highland Council.
Now he is to work for the new Fife Council as corporate manager
(social strategy) at a salary of ''around #70,000''.
Ross and Cromarty councillors had decided to become the first local
authority in Scotland to use a scheme offering redundant council
officials taxpayers' money to find a new job, on top of a large
redundancy package.
Mr Mair, 38, denied yesterday that he had been given anything like
#5000 to pay top people's job-hunter Coutts and Co to find him the new
position, which he regards as a promotion.
As he announced his appointment to councillors at the development
services committee, he said: ''Because I have now got this new job
either none or a tiny proportion of this money will be taken up.''
Although the decision to make a large redundancy payment was taken in
a closed-doors meeting, two councillors decided to go public.
SNP Councillor Douglas Briggs said that the pay-out would be a
''misuse of public funds''. When he and another councillor failed to get
the decision overturned at the full council meeting, they lodged an
official complaint with the Edinburgh-based Accounts Commission for
Scotland, which polices council spending. It is to mount an official
inquiry.
Mr Mair, a father-of-two whose wife, Liz, died in a crash in the Black
Isle, said he would have responsibility for education, social services,
housing, and leisure in his new job. He would be responsible for 9500
staff, compared to 450 in Ross and Cromarty.
He said that he held Councillor Briggs entirely responsible for
releasing confidential information about the employment consultancy
payment and giving ''a spurious picture to the public''.
Mr Mair has been chief executive at the Dingwall-based council for
five years. At the time of his appointment, he was Scotland's youngest
council chief.

<RECORDNO>975962387</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SINN Fein president Gerry Adams yesterday pledged Republicans would
not use the threat of violence to try to influence the outcome of
all-party talks on the future of Northern Ireland.
In a clear reference to the continued demand for a start to the
decommissioning of IRA weapons as a sign of a commitment to democratic
means, he said no-one had ''the right to demand that Sinn Fein's
commitment to peace has to undergo some sort of test''.
Moving to quell Unionist fears that retention of arms could mean a
return to violence if Republicans did not get what they wanted out of
talks, Mr Adams insisted: ''It is self evident that threats of any
description from any quarter have no role in any such process.
''They are certainly no part of any talks process in which we will
engage.''
He insisted that throughout the present peace process, the party had
made ''abundantly clear on numerous occasions that we are totally
committed to the democratic process. The achievement of peace must
involve a permanent end to all violence''.
The comments appear to be a fresh attempt to satisfy demands from
London and Dublin for a public statement from Sinn Fein that there will
be no return to violence if they don't get their own way in talks.
However, there has been no public sign that the Government, or
Unionists, will reduce their demands from that of a start on
decommissioning.
Calling again for the Government to set a date for the start of
all-party talks, Mr Adams said Unionists could not continue to interpret
democracy solely in terms of their own priorities and objectives to the
exclusion of all other views.
In a statement giving his first detailed response to the election of
Mr David Trimble as leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, Mr Adams said
Mr Trimble had a ''crucial role to play in determining the success or
failure of the search for a lasting peace settlement''.
Deputy Irish Prime Minister Dick Spring last night underlined Dublin's
continuing opposition to conditions set for the entry of Sinn Fein into
all-party talks on the future of Northern Ireland.
Stressing the need for political dialogue to build on the present
peace, he declared: ''The Irish Government believe it is essential that
comprehensive and inclusive negotiations, in which all relevant parties
can participate on the basis of their popular support, must begin as
soon as possible.
''It is unfortunate that they have not yet begun.''
He added: ''The crucial point is that the guns are silent. The total
cessation of violence was the crucial point at which political
engagement with Sinn Fein on the one hand, and the loyalist parties on
the other, became possible.''
A Government Minister and a leading member of Sinn Fein had their
second session of talks in less than a fortnight last night but
afterwards little was revealed of the discussion.
As efforts to break the deadlock in the peace-talks process continued,
the Northern Ireland Political Development Minister, Mr Michael Ancram,
met Sinn Fein strategist Martin McGuinness -- at Sinn Fein's request.
Following the meeting at Stormont Castle, a brief statement said the
discussions had been useful and had covered ''the current political
situation''.

A NURSING sister was stabbed to death in her own hospital ward, a
court heard yesterday. The jury was told that her ex-lover, who
allegedly murdered her, had previously asked her: ''Have you picked the
lining for your coffin yet?''
Sister Irene Duffy, 32, fell under a hail of knife blows in Stobhill
Hospital, the High Court in Glasgow heard.
Other nurses ran screaming for help from Ward 2A but by the time help
arrived, Ms Duffy, of Glenacre Road, Cumbernauld, was lying in a pool of
blood.
Mr Stephen McGowan, 30, her former lover and father of her
three-year-old son, was still bent down stabbing her, it was alleged.
A visitor, Mr Ian McDonald, 47, of Kilsyth Road, Kirkintilloch, told
how he ran to help. Mr McDonald, a civil engineer, said he hit Mr
McGowan with a nurse's trolley to stop him attacking Ms Duffy.
He told Advocate-depute Ronald Clancy: ''I picked him up and pinned
him against a wall and asked him: 'What are you playing at?' I think he
said: 'It's Father's Day' and 'Christopher'.''
Mr McGowan denies murdering Ms Duffy last on June 18 and previously
threatening her.
Nurse Brenda Stark, 36, told the jury how Ms Duffy was frightened
after Mr McGowan made threatening gestures to her.
Ms Stark said Ms Duffy wept and told her that Mr McGowan had asked
her: ''Have you picked the lining for your coffin yet?''
Auxilliary nurse Dorothy Cunningham, 48, of Hillkirk Street,
Springburn, Glasgow, told how she was working a 14-hour shift with Ms
Duffy.
Ms Duffy suddenly realised it was Father's Day and said: ''Oh, I
forgot. I would have phoned Steven to ask him if he wanted Christopher
(their son) for the day.''
The couple were not living together at that time, she said.
Mrs Cunningham said Ms Duffy said she would get her mother to get
Christopher to phone his father to wish him a happy Father's Day.
Mrs Cunningham said that, later in the evening, she looked up and saw
Mr McGowan walking towards them.
Nurse Stark ran out of the ward and Ms Cunningham and Ms Duffy backed
into a corner.
Ms Cunningham said: ''I was in front of Irene. Steven had a knife in
his hand. He did not speak.
''Irene said: 'Oh no. Oh no.'
''I said: 'Leave her alone,' and he lifted up the knife and I ducked
and crawled round his feet and ran up the ward.
''I looked back and saw Steven McGowan plunging the knife up and down
into Irene several times.''
Nurse Stark told how she screamed and telephoned for help before
returning to find Mr McGowan pinned by Mr McDonald, and Ms Duffy lying
slumped on the floor.
The trial continues.

A WARNING that Scotland must keep improving its image to stay level
with overseas competition in tourism was given by Mr Peter Lederer,
chairman of Tourism Training Scotland, in Edinburgh yesterday.
The Scottish tourism industry was at a crossroads, he said. The world
tourism market was growing rapidly and the standard of competition
improved every day.
Tourism was a major business in Scotland, contributing #2000m to the
economy and 5% of the gross domestic product.
''If Scotland is to have any chance of maintaining or increasing its
share of this exciting market, we must ensure its reputation as a
premier destination,'' he said.
Mr Lederer, managing director of The Gleneagles Hotel, was speaking as
TTS announced details of the first management development programme for
owners and managers of small businesses.
The programme, known as Tourism Business Success, was intended to
improve professional standards across all sectors of the tourism
industry and aimed to train 1500 participants in three years.
The programme was targeted at small to medium-sized businesses,
particularly visitor attractions, bed and breakfasts, guest houses, and
small hotels which together comprised the bulk of the industry.
The programme was designed to bring practical business benefits such
as more effective marketing, better financial planning, and more repeat
business leading to increased profits.
Mr Eddie Brogan, head of tourism at Scottish Enterprise, said visitors
were more widely travelled than ever before and had higher expections.
This represented a serious challenge to the skills of owners and
managers, especially in sales, marketing, and service quality, he said.
A spokeswoman said research showed that although managers often had
some kind of formal qualification, few had had specific tourism business
training.
Scotland had more than 20,000 hotels, guest houses, B &amp; Bs, caravan
parks, and other types of accommodation, around 800 visitor attractions,
and many thousands of shops, restaurants, garages, transport services,
and other businesses providing essential services to tourists.
However, the industry in Scotland was fragmented. It had a high
proportion of small, family-run businesses and was characterised by a
shortage of skills among management and staff and high employee
turnover, she said.
TTS's annual report, which was launched yesterday, said that more and
more companies recognised the business benefits from effective training
and staff development, and highlighted four firms which had increased
business through these means.
They were Channings Hotel, Edinburgh -- 20% profit increase in year in
progress, Clan Donald Lands Trust, Skye -- increased profit by 11% in
1994, Gowanlea B &amp; B, Dunbartonshire -- 15% profit increase in present
year, Glenturret Distillery, Crieff -- visitors increased to 214,414 in
1995 from 101,244 in 1985.

THE cost of the Lanark Blue cheese case continue to escalate. Instead
of nearing the winding-up stage on day 17 yesterday, three more days
have been allocated.
Costs for the case at Lanark Sheriff Court alone are now expected to
reach #200,000. Already, it is estimated Clydesdale district faces a
bill of #70,000 for Court of Session and local court costs prior to
sheriff court proceedings.
The current case centres on a bid by Clydesdale to obtain an order to
destroy #27,000 worth of the gourmet cheese.
It claims a five tonne batch was so contaminated with lysteria it was
unfit for human consumption.
Cheese-maker Humphrey Errington, 50, of Dunsyre, has claimed his
product is safe.
He expects his share of legal costs to be at least #90,000 and has
launched a competition to pay them.
Yesterday's hearing was adjourned until October 30. The sheriff is
expected to give his decision in November or early December.

HUNDREDS of people from central Scotland, curious about a rash of UFO
sightings in their area, attended a lecture on the phenomenon last
night, only to be further baffled.
Around 700 people from the Bonnybridge area paid #2 each to attend the
meeting at Falkirk Town Hall, hoping to hear some explanation as to why
there had been some 2000 sightings of unidentified flying objects in the
past three years.
The gathering, billed The Cosmic Agenda and organised by local
councillor, Mr Billy Buchanan, left locals no wiser.
The panel of three experts was headed by Mrs Phylis Schlemmer, who
described herself as a transceiver from the Council of Nine, a group of
super beings who look after the Earth and its people.
Mrs Schlemmer, 66, was joined by Mr Geri Rogers, from Edinburgh, and
Mr Ken MacFarlane, from Cheshire, both ufologists.
During a half-hour lecture, in the style of a TV evangelist, Mrs
Schlemmer outlined her own strange encounters dating back to the 1950s.
However, she said little about Bonnybridge -- which at one stage she
referred to as Bonnybrook -- except that the visitations underlined the
area's importance in world events.
Her comments appeared to bemuse some people and infuriate others.
Mr Gregory Campopiano, 22, from Falkirk, said: ''It is nothing like
what I expected.
''I thought they would be trying to explain the sightings in
Bonnybridge. Billy Buchanan has got three speakers who are trying to
baffle us with jargon.''
There was also no sign of a mysterious extra-terrestrial called
Zal-us, who, according to newspaper reports, had appeared in Mr
Buchanan's offices a few months ago.
Mr Buchanan opened the meeting by criticising the press who, he said,
had damaged his credibility by writing about this person and undermining
a serious event.

A FARMER who ill-treated his pigs, causing some to become cannibals,
has been fined #1250 at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court.
But Tom Ness is being allowed to stay in business after Sheriff
William Christie was told that conditions on the farm and Ness's
financial situation had improved.
The sheriff had been ''horrified'' when he learned of conditions at
Brewness Farm, Balbeggie Avenue, Thornton, during an earlier hearing.
Ness, who has more than 2000 pigs and also runs a large poultry
business, previously admitted causing unnecessary suffering to pigs and
leaving a dead animal to putrify and be eaten by its pen mates.
He pled guilty to breaches of the Agricultural (Miscellaneous
Provisions) Act 1968 and the Protection of Animals (Scotland) Act 1912,
which stated that, between November 1993 and March last year, he caused
unnecessary distress to pigs and failed to provide adequate comfort and
shelter.
Last October, Sheriff Patrick McGoldrick ordered Ness to get his sty
in order by December -- warning him he could be banned from keeping
livestock -- after being told that, despite several deferrals of the
case, Ness was still failing to meet animal husbandry standards.
On December 29, Sheriff Christie accepted reports that matters had
''vastly improved'' but deferred sentence until April, then further
deferred matters until yesterday for updated reports as he had been
''concerned standards might slip again''.

A MAN who made hoax bomb threats escaped with an admonishment
yesterday after a court was told he had been forgiven by the target of
his calls -- Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth.
Stirling Sheriff Court was told that Mr Forsyth's wife Susan and their
three children were evacuated from Mr Forsyth's lochside home, The
Glassert, at Aberfoyle, in July 1993 after a former forestry worker made
three phone calls saying it was about to be blown up with plastic
explosive.
At the time of the calls, Paul Kelly, 37, was a neighbour of Mr
Forsyth. He has since moved from Kinlochard Cottages to Allanvale Road,
Bridge of Allan.
He was arrested when the village policeman recognised his voice on a
tape made automatically when Kelly called the 999 system.
He had also called journalist Emma Kennedy at Scottish Television and
the Scottish Office, telling a Scottish Office telephonist: ''We can get
into Michael Forsyth's home. We have the Semtex and we can go in by
boat.''
A squad of police officers scoured the house and grounds before it was
confirmed that the calls were hoaxes.
Yesterday, Kelly's lawyer Robert Sandeman said there was never a
satisfactory explanation for his client's actions but Kelly had been
suffering from a form of depression at the time.
Sentence had twice been deferred for 12 months, and Kelly was still
receiving help from a mental health charity. He had admitted making the
calls.
Mr Sandeman said there had been no repetition, no further offending,
and doctors thought Kelly was getting better.
Mr Sandeman said: ''Since the offence, my client wrote to Mr Forsyth
apologising to him and his family for the distress caused.
''He had a very understanding letter back from Michael Forsyth and,
following this, he has had considerable help from Mr Forsyth over
matters not connected with this offence.''
Mr Sandeman said later that Mr Forsyth, who was Employment Minister at
the time of hoaxes and is Kelly's constituency MP, had advised him over
problems he had had with his former job.
When Kelly first appeared, the court was told he had been persecuted
by fellow forestry workers and had an unhappy history of suffering
sexual harassment.
At that time, Sheriff William Reid warned Kelly he could face jail but
yesterday Sheriff George Crozier said that, although the offence was an
extremely serious one, he was satisfied it was brought on by a medical
condition.
Admonishing Kelly, Sheriff Crozier said: ''It's good to know that Mr
Forsyth has been helping him and has accepted the man's apology.
''It's time to bring this matter to a close.''

PRIME Ministers past and present paid tribute to Lord Home of The
Hirsel, Conservative Premier from 1963-64, who died yesterday, aged 92.
Better known as Alec Douglas-Home, he died peacefully and surrounded
by his family at his home, The Hirsel, in Coldstream, Berwickshire.
Mr John Major joined Britain's three surviving former premiers,
Baroness Thatcher, Sir Edward Heath, and Lord Callaghan, in paying
tribute.
Buckingham Palace said the Queen had been informed and had sent a
private message to Lord Home's family.
He was remembered as a quiet and dignified man, perhaps the last of
the old-style aristocratic Tory patrician leaders who entered politics
purely to serve his country.
Lord Home was Prime Minister from October 1963 to October 1964. He was
the unexpected choice and the last to ''emerge'' from the Tory party's
system of consultations dubbed the Magic Circle.
His appointment on the advice of then Premier Harold Macmillan from
his hospital bed caused a furore and led to leadership election ballots.
His brief spell at Number 10 ended when Mr Harold Wilson scraped into
power in the General Election of 1964. He resigned the party leadership
the following year.
His time at No 10 was only part of a long career which included two
spells as Foreign Secretary. He was even happy to serve in the shadow
cabinet after the Tory defeat of 1974 and later, in the Lords, he made
speeches until after his 80th birthday.
Entering Parliament in 1931 as MP for South Lanark, he rose up the
backbench ranks to become Parliamentary Private Secretary to Mr Neville
Chamberlain, accompanying him to the now infamous Munich meeting with
Hitler in 1938.
He lost his seat in Labour's 1945 landslide, came back as MP for
Lanark in 1950 and, on the death of his father, became the 14th Lord
Home.
He disclaimed his six peerages for life on becoming Premier and after
a by-election return to the Commons for Kinross and West Perthshire.

Clean-up teams recover 1000 explosive phosphorus sticks.
LARGE quantities of dangerous munitions yesterday continued to be
washed up on beaches in the south-west of Scotland.
The origin of the munitions will not be known until explosives experts
have analysed the materials.
However, Labour MP George Foulkes yesterday demanded that British Gas
contractors ceased underwater operations on a pipeline between Scotland
and Northern Ireland until the mystery was solved.
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth last night expressed his concerns
to the Defence Secretary.
A Scottish Office spokesman said: ''Mr Forsyth has tonight spoken with
Michael Portillo on the subject of the munitions washed ashore.
''The Secretary of State for Scotland has explained the importance
attached to it by the Scottish Office and his concern over the matter.''
About 1000 phosphorus sticks have been recovered so far in a
widespread clean-up operation which began on Friday. They have been
found on Arran and Cumbrae and at Ardrossan, Saltcoats, Stevenston, and
Carradale.
Last night, police, health, local government, and military experts
involved in the clean-up issued fresh warnings to the public not to
attempt to handle the articles.
The sticks are described as being nine inches long and two or three
inches in diameter, and of a dirty yellow colour. Anyone finding them
has been urged to contact the police or coastguard immediately.
Lieutenant Commander Simon France, of the Royal Navy, said: ''The
objects, which may also be found broken into smaller pieces, exude a
distinctive, pungent smell, similar to diesel fuel oil. They may be seen
smoking on the beach. They spontaneously combust when dry.''
Explosive Ordnance Disposal experts are examining some of the remains
of the articles to identify their origin.
Commander John Humphreys, of the Royal Navy, said it would be
''extremely dangerous'' for anyone to kick one of the articles or even
poke at it with a stick, as the substance was likely to adhere to
whatever touched it.
Officials from Cunninghame District Council are advising farmers not
to gather seaweed from the shore for use as fertiliser.
As reported in The Herald yesterday, environmental campaigners have
claimed the sticks may have washed up because of preparatory underwater
work undertaken by British Gas contractors in the laying of its
pipeline.
Yesterday, Mr Foulkes, MP for Carrick, Cumnock, and Doon Valley, wrote
to British Gas chief executive Cedric Brown, saying: ''While not stating
that there is any direct relation . . . I do feel that your actions in
continuing work in this area are with scant regard for public safety and
blatantly dangerous. It is essential that all work in the area is
postponed until a comprehensive survey of the area is carried out.''
A spokesman for British Gas yesterday repeated its earlier statement
that the work had been agreed with the Department of Trade and Industry,
and that the pipeline route was well to the north of the Beaufort's Dyke
dump, a suspected origin of the sticks.

THE former wife of a disgraced solicitor who was jailed for 10 years
for a #4m fraud, faces imminent eviction from her home.
The house, in Northumberland Street, New Town, Edinburgh, is
encumbered by mortgage arrears of more than #660,000.
Mrs Helen McCabe staved off eviction in January but now the court
order has been lifted.
Her husband, John McCabe, was jailed at the High Court in Edinburgh in
1991 for fraud involving banks and building societies, including the
Skipton.
Mrs McCabe, who also worked as a lawyer in Edinburgh, was herself
found guilty of professional misconduct by the Scottish Solicitors
Discipline Tribunal in connection with the preparation of standard
securities on loans which her husband had failed to record.
The Skipton Building Society began proceedings to repossess the house,
in which the couple each had a half share, at Edinburgh Sheriff Court in
1991. Mr McCabe did not defend that action.
At the Court of Session in January this year, counsel for the Skipton
told Lord Cameron the mortgage had not been paid since 1990 and arrears
stood at #666,711.
Mrs McCabe persuaded the judge to grant an order suspending the
repossession.
The judge was told that Mrs McCabe's appeal against the eviction order
had been unsuccessful and she had raised proceedings in the Court of
Session against the Skipton and Mr McCabe to have the building society's
standard security over her home set aside.
She was later refused legal aid by the Scottish Legal Aid Board for an
appeal to the House of Lords over both of these legal actions.
Lord Cameron agreed to suspend eviction proceedings after hearing that
Mrs McCabe intended to challenge the legal-aid refusal by way of
judicial review.
She argued that since her home was at the centre of the legal actions,
it would be prejudicial to evict her before the judicial review issue
was settled.
The Skipton has now returned to court asking Lord Cameron to lift the
order he granted in January, which would have the effect of allowing the
eviction process to go ahead.
In a written judgment, Lord Cameron said the building society claimed
there had been a change of circumstances.
Mrs McCabe's application for legal aid to launch her judicial review
application was refused by the Legal Aid Board and again, on September
22, at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
The sheriff had decided Mrs McCabe did not have a reasonable prospect
of success in her action.
The building society argued that the grounds on which the eviction
order had been suspended in January had now been overtaken by events.
Lord Cameron said he had also been told the outstanding debts covered
by the standard security substantially outweighed any price likely to be
received by the sale of the house.
The judge added: ''I have reached the clear view that the change of
circumstances is such as no longer to justify the continuance of the
interim order for suspension (of the eviction order).''

DOCTORS yesterday switched off the life-support machine which had kept
a two-week old baby alive for more than two days after a car crash,
following talks with her father.
Shannon Wilson suffered severe brain damage in the crash near Kyle of
Lochalsh on Friday in which her mother Rachel, 23, was killed and her
father, Sandy, 29, was seriously injured -- on the eve of their first
wedding anniversary.
Mr Wilson was flown by helicopter to Glasgow yesterday from hospital
in Skye to see his daughter in the intensive care unit of the Royal
Hospital for Sick Children Yorkhill, where she had been on a ventilator.
Mr Wilson, badly bruised and heavily bandaged, limped into the Glasgow
hospital just after 11am. He was later joined by his father Alex and
brother Brian.
Dr Alistair Miller, medical director of Yorkhill NHS Trust, said the
baby had been admitted with severe head injuries and was critically ill.
Dr Miller explained that the criteria for identifying if a baby was
brain dead was not the same as for an adult and that Mr Wilson was
''very shocked'' and had found it difficult to discuss details with
medical staff.
However, a statement issued later by the trust confirmed that Shannon
died at 3.50pm. Her father had been with her.
The nurse who accompanied Mr Wilson in the helicopter from Broadford
Hospital said his condition was ''as you would expect in the
circumstances''.
Shannon had been transferred to Glasgow by air ambulance from Raigmore
Hospital, Inverness, after she was thrown from her parents' car on to
the road in a head-on collision with another car on the A87 at
Balmacara.
Mrs Wilson was killed instantly. Three people in the other car also
suffered minor injuries.
The couple worked at the Cuillin Hills Hotel in Portree, where Mr
Wilson was a chef and his wife was a waitress.
The couple had been returning from a holiday at Mr Wilson's parents'
home in Oban, and were heading to Skye to celebrate their first
anniversary at the Dunvegan home of Mrs Wilson's sister, Margaret, when
the crash happened.
Mr Wilson and his family were too distraught to comment last night.
His wife's parents, Finlay and Isabella Maclennan, who run the post
office and general store on Raasay, where their daughter was married,
were also said to be ''shattered'' and were not available for comment.
Shannon was the Maclennan's first grandchild.
Mr Farquhar Maclennan, uncle of Mrs Wilson, speaking from Portree,
Skye, yesterday, said: ''We saw Sandy in Broadford Hospital. He was very
anxious to see the infant himself and went to Glasgow at his own behest.
He wanted to be on hand if any decision had to be made.
''We are a bit distant but we were glad that he was able to get to the
hospital.''

THE National Health Service spends as much on spots as it does on
cancer drugs, a leading research scientist claimed yesterday.
Professor Gordon McVie was speaking at the launch of a report showing
cancer in Scotland had almost doubled in the space of 30 years.
Professor McVie, scientific director of the Cancer Research Campaign,
said prevention had been ignored by successive health authorities
because of the demand for treatment. However, he acknowledged: ''You
have to have treatment for people who need it.
''To put the cost of expensive drugs in proportion, the total bill for
anti-cancer drugs in the UK is the same as all the prescriptions for all
the anti-acne remedies.''
The report, Cancer Incidence and Mortality in Scotland, 1960-1989, was
produced by the CRC, the information and statistics division of the
Scottish NHS, and the European Institute of Oncology.
It shows that the incidence of the disease had risen from 13,600 new
patients in 1960 to more than 25,808 in 1989.
This was partly accounted for by the ageing of the population, since
the risk of most cancers increases with age, but there were other
important changes, said the authors.
''The most staggering increase is the increase in lung cancer among
women,'' said Professor McVie. Scotland was the first country in Europe
to have lung cancer killing more women than breast cancer.

A SENIOR sheriff has questioned a long-standing principle of Scots
Law, that an advocate cannot be sued for professional negligence.
Sheriff Principal Gordon Nicholson, QC, dismissed an appeal in a
#150,000 action at Edinburgh Sheriff Court, by Thomas Crooks against
Christopher Haddow, QC.
The sheriff principal said he had some sympathy for Mr Crooks but
dismissed the appeal because he was bound by a decision at the Court of
Session in 1876.
The then Lord President, Lord Inglis, threw out a claim for negligence
against an advocate and a solicitor in the case of Batchelor v Pattison
and Mackersy.
Sheriff Principal Nicholson said in his written judgment that the
Batchelor decision meant ''in effect that counsel is immune from claims
in respect of professional negligence''.
The action came about after Mr Crooks, of Dundas Street, Edinburgh,
bought a flat in Dundee which turned out to have dry rot. Mr Haddow
acted for Mr Crooks when he sued the man who sold the flat for #175,000.
He eventually settled for #25,000 after Mr Haddow refused to appear in
court as Mr Crooks had apparently refused to take his advice to settle
the case. Mr Crooks then sued Mr Haddow for the #150,000 difference
between what he originally sued for and what he got but the case was
thrown out by a sheriff.

SOMETIMES it's hard to be a woman -- but now a Glasgow college has
stepped in to help transsexuals achieve femininity.
Eight transsexuals have enrolled on the special beauty course offered
by Clydebank College.
However, the move has outraged Ayr Tory MP Phil Gallie, who claims it
is condoning ''weird behaviour''.
Last night, Dr Susan Carr, senior clinical medical officer for human
sexuality at Glasgow's Family Planning Clinic, defended the course.
She said: ''It is very new, it is very innovative, and I have not
heard of one anywhere else in the world.
''To me it is extremely positive and it is something Glasgow should be
proud of.''
Dr Carr revealed that eight students aged between their teens and late
50s are attending the lectures, which are held once a week, and working
towards Scotvec modules in beauty therapy.
Dr Carr said there were probably 40 or 50 transsexuals living in
Glasgow and around 150 in Scotland.
She said Mr Gallie's comments were damaging and rabble rousing.
''They are absolutely not weirdos,'' she said.

THE Prime Minister warned his party agents last night that there is to
be ''political pain'' to be faced in the state spending cuts in next
month's Budget. It was Mr Major's answer to defector Mr Alan Howarth and
his determination to face the country with the realities of government
at the Tory Party conference today.
The Prime Minister first spent more than one hour with Mr Colin
Powell, who may announce his candidature for the United States
presidency at about the same time that Chancellor Kenneth Clarke is
making his Budget statement to the Commons.
The death of Lord Home of the Hirsel, the ultimate Tory loyalist, was
casting a bigger shadow over the Conservative Party conference last
night in Blackpool than the defection of Mr Howarth to Labour.
Mr Major was planning to make detailed announcements to his party
agents at their dinner last night but these have been deferred until his
end of conference rally on Friday in deference to Lord Home.
However, Mr Major told the Tory agents, on whom he must rely to give
him a chance of staying in power, that they will have to handle what he
called ''very tough decisions'' resulting from the heated Cabinet debate
on expenditure. There was no direct reference to Mr Howarth but the
Prime Minister's rebuttal to him was clear. Mr Major told the agents the
only way to defend the public services was a stable economy. This means
low taxation but neither can be achieved without low public spending.
He was underlining his Chancellor's target to reduce the state share
of the gross domestic product to below 40% between now and the next
General Election.
This means that education, health, and law and order are ''ring
fenced'' and given priority for state spending. However, it also means
that Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley and Defence Secretary
Michael Portillo look like taking the burden of some trenchant cuts.
The Prime Minister told the agents that key Ministers would be making
new policy announcements to the conference, starting today. These
Ministers are Education Secretary Gillian Shephard, Mr Lilley, Home
Secretary Michael Howard, and President of the Board of Trade Ian Lang.
Mr Major told his agents he wanted to make Britain the enterprise
centre of Europe, which required proper rewards and incentives for those
who provided the enterprise.
''So we must cut taxes when we can because lower taxes promote
enterprise. They will attract more investment and that creates more
jobs. To cut taxes we must lower spending. This means ruthlessly setting
out priorities. Education will be high on that list. No-one can avoid
the tough choices that lie ahead. Social security costs every working
person #15 every working day.''
He made it clear the Government would be attacking social security
fraudsters even more sharply. There are to be new plans from Mrs
Shephard to get people back to work and Mr Lang will be announcing
measures to fight fraud with the latest technology. Mr Howard looks like
getting new money to reduce crime.

EXCLUSIVE
JUST when you thought it was safe to go and see a mural in the Glasgow
Royal Concert Hall, the jinx has struck again.
Five years ago, it hit Lenzie artist Ian McCulloch when his murals,
commissioned by Strathclyde Regional Council to symbolise its
involvement in the #34m concert hall project, were ignominiously taken
down on the instructions of Councillor Pat Lally and re-hung at the
city's Tramway Theatre.
This time the jinx has hit artist Peter Howson -- the very man who was
approached to fill the void left by McCulloch.
Howson, whose bold, figurative work graces the walls of Madonna and
Sylvester Stallone among others, eventually pulled out of a #50,000
commission to replace the McCulloch murals, citing moral concern and
fears that his work would be watered down.
However, along with the other so-called New Glasgow Boys -- Steven
Campbell, Ken Currie, and Adrian Wiszniewski, Howson agreed to
contribute one mural.
Last night, it emerged that he had painted himself into another tight
corner at the concert hall because his canvas was the wrong shape.
When the 10ft x 8ft canvas arrived in Howson's studio, it is believed
he assumed that, being a mural, it would require a horizontal shape,
which he duly provided. In fact, the murals are to be fitted together in
pairs, vertically.
Today's unveiling by Councillor Lally will therefore reveal only three
paintings by Campbell, Currie, and Wiszniewski who have got theirs the
right way up.
Last night, Mr Lally laughed off any suggestion of a jinx. ''These
things happen,'' he said. ''Peter probably thought it looked better that
way round.''
Mr Howson had found out about his mistake last Thursday, said Mr
Lally. ''I don't think it will worry him unduly. I'm sure he will have
no difficulty selling it.
''He has been beavering away on a new one and I shouldn't think it
will be too long before he is finished. I'm a great admirer of Peter
Howson and hopefully we will see it soon.''
Each artist has taken a vaguely musical theme for his composition.
Currie has painted a black and brooding huddle of figures which indicate
a choir.
Campbell has created a striking image of Dame Joan Sutherland,
garlanded with a tiara of tears, her huge chin resting on Mount
Rushmore.
This is despite a phone call saying the concert hall was not keen on a
portrait of Sutherland because they were not interested in her as a
singer.
''She looks better than Abraham Lincoln or Theodore Roosevelt
anyway.'' said Campbell. ''It's romantic, mythic. I thought of a pillow
or a cushion, a place for dreams.''
Wiszniewski has taken a less controversial tack, merely inventing
imaginative musical instruments played by his quartet. His distinctive
cello has three parts and one girl plays a cross between a violin and a
Russian balalaika. Its up-beat bright colours will make it a popular
image.
Peter Howson's mural had been of a fiercely drumming Orange Walk. He
could not be contacted for reaction.

THE latest buzz phrase of human resource management has become flavour
of the month with nearly half of the managements of unionised Scottish
workplaces, according to Mr Campbell Christie, general secretary of the
Scottish TUC.
Reviewing the impact of HRM for last night's Town and Gown Lecture,
sponsored by The Herald, at Strathclyde University, he conceded that at
least the new management thinking had not been used for a tidal wave of
union derecognition in Scotland and that many workforces had a positive
experience of HRM.
Human Resource Management, said Mr Christie, encompassed different
strands of thinking in industrial relations, some of which had been
around for some time. It generally included greater employee involvement
in decision making, enhanced training, moves towards performance-related
pay, greater use of newsletters and briefings, and the use of phrases
such as ''people make the difference''.
Mr Christie differentiated between what he called hard and soft HRM.
The hard form, he said, set out to derecognise unions.
However, he told his audience: ''On this issue, we are quite clear. No
matter how it is dressed up -- whether it be as part of a Human Resource
Management strategy, an argument for individual freedom, or the need for
flexibility of payment or hours of work through individual contracts --
the total or partial derecognition of unions is nothing less than the
withdrawal of a basic human right.''
As for soft HRM, he said unions would support it where it was a
genuine attempt to involve employees.
A survey amongst shop stewards in Scotland had shown that just under
half of the workplaces were using the phrase HRM and most of them had
begun using it in the last three years.
Although it was fairly widespread, Scottish managements had
nonetheless adopted a pick and mix approach, choosing only some of the
essential elements of HRM, and less than 8% of the workplaces surveyed
adopted what were regarded as all the essential measures.
Mr Christie stated there was little evidence of hard HRM in Scottish
union-organised workplaces but what was more difficult to judge was
whether the use of HRM elements was an attempt to undermine unions or a
coherent attempt to involve workers in a mutually beneficial way.

THE ''absurd'' ban on homosexuals serving in the armed forces is
''impossible to justify'', the Court of Appeal was told yesterday.
Three gay men and one lesbian sacked from the services were launching
a bid to overturn a historic High Court test case ruling that the
automatic ban imposed by the Ministry of Defence was lawful.
Mr David Pannick QC, for the four, said the MoD's ''irrational and
perverse policy'' could not pass muster under domestic law.
Its ''lack of coherence and lack of legitimate purpose'' also meant
that it constituted a breach of human rights and European Community law.
Yesterday's renewed legal battle follows an announcement last month by
the MoD that there would be an internal review of the ban by a committee
of civil servants and serving officers.
Former Lieutenant Commander Duncan Lustig-Prean, 36, from London, was
dismissed from the Royal Navy as ''unsuitable'' at the end of last year,
only months after being commended by his commanding officer.
The other three, all with exemplary service records, are former RAF
sergeant Graeme Grady, 32, from London; ex-RAF nurse Jeanette Smith, 28,
from Edinburgh; and former Royal Navy weapons engineer John Beckett, 25,
from Sheffield.
Although the four lost their High Court action, they had their hopes
of eventual success boosted when Lord Justice Simon Brown, sitting with
Mr Justice Curtis, said he personally thought the policy, though not
unlawful, was wrong and doomed as ''the tide of history is against the
Ministry''.
It was the absolute nature of the ban which made it impossible to
justify, Mr Pannick told appeal judges Sir Thomas Bingham (Master of the
Rolls), sitting with Lord Justice Henry and Lord Justice Thorpe.
Arguments that there were special reasons why a disciplined force had
to exclude homosexuals did not bear scrutiny.
The evidence showed that other disciplined forces such as the police
and fire brigade in this country, and the armed forces of Britain's
allies in Nato and the Commonwealth, allowed homosexuals to serve
without any of the adverse consequences which the MoD feared.
''No coherent explanation can be given as to why homosexuality alone
requires an absolute policy of discharge,'' said Mr Pannick
The hearing continues.

THE first case involving the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act to
be brought against hunt saboteurs in Scotland was heard yesterday.
Ms Sarah Bruce, 28, of Dalkeith Road, and Ms Ruth Urquhart, 23, of
Spottiswoode Road, both Edinburgh, admitted at Jedburgh Sheriff Court
aggravated trespass and sounding a hunting horn and playing a recording
of dogs barking on January 28, actions intended to obstruct or disrupt a
foxhunt taking place at Hundalee Farm, Jedburgh.
The case had been tabled for trial along with three others, Daniel
Watson, 26, of Sunderland, Eleanor Murray, 24, of Edinburgh, and Timothy
Chamberlain, 18, of Melrose, but procurator-fiscal Graham Fraser
accepted not guilty pleas on their behalf.
Mr Alastair Duff, solicitor for the accused, said the women were of
the opinion that public attention should be drawn to their belief that
hunting was an inappropriate pastime.
He added: ''This year the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act was a
new piece of legislation, and lawyers and sheriffs, as well as those
whose activities might put themselves in breach of the Act, were
interested to see how police might administer the legislation.''
The Act, he suggested, was part of legislation designed to ''get at''
a selection of activities of various sorts. He went on: ''At least, in
this area, it was introduced by a Government keen to show the electorate
they were cracking down on certain activities. It was meant to be
something of a vote catcher -- but time will tell if that is the case.''
Ms Bruce, he said, was a BsC degree student at Napier University,
Edinburgh, while Ms Urquhart was unemployed.
They intervened when they felt the hunt was not being properly
conducted. Their assertion was that the fox had gone down a hole, and
having gone to ground, the hunt should have been called off. Instead, a
terrier was put in, and they believed the hunt was ready to start again,
and took action. The fox escaped.
They alleged that the fox had entered a badger sett (badgers are a
protected species), and had the case proceeded to trial, evidence would
have been led on that point.
A complaint was made to the procurator-fiscal and was being
investigated.
Sheriff Rodney Cairns said he was sure the women saw their actions as
honourable and humane, but they had broken the law, which was a serious
matter, carrying a sentence of three months imprisonment and a fine of
#2500, or both.
''I will give you credit for the fact that this is a fairly new law,
and I take the point that it is a law even lawyers have difficulty
interpreting,'' he stated.
He deferred sentence until April 11 next year, cautioning them that
should they become involved in similar activities, they should not break
the law.

<HEADLINE>Prosecution outlines gruesome details of the fate of Cromwell Street victims to jury. Chilling evidence of mutilation</HEADLINE>

THERE was chilling evidence that the bodies of nine of the 10 young
women and girls Rosemary West is alleged to have murdered had been
mutilated, the jury was told yesterday.
That was the only possible explanation of why bones were missing from
each of the nine graves uncovered by police at 25 Cromwell Street, Mr
Brian Leveson, QC, prosecuting, said as he concluded his opening address
in the trial at Winchester Crown Court.
In most cases, the bodies had had the legs removed from the hips and
they had been decapitated, he said. In all probability, this was to
force the remains into small holes.
It was a fact that, in every single set of remains, there were bones
missing. In each case, they included many of the small bones from the
hands and the feet. In addition, kneecaps were missing from seven
victims.
In some cases, there were other large bones missing. Mr Leveson said
fingers could well have been removed to render the task of
identification more difficult. That in itself was mutilation.
''Why is one or both kneecaps missing from seven of the girls?'' Mr
Levenson asked the jury. ''The only answer again is mutilation.''
The only other explanation for the missing bones was dismissed by
counsel. That was that the bodies were allowed to decompose elsewhere
before being brought to Cromwell Street, where they were buried, and
that the bones disappeared during the journey.
However, it would have taken months before the bodies had decomposed
sufficiently for bones to drop off.
''What on earth would be the purpose of moving a body from a site in
which it has not been discovered for months or years, presumably away
from Cromwell Street, into Cromwell Street, where it could inevitably be
linked to the West family?'' he asked.
Indeed, why would the knife found in the grave of Lucy Partington also
have been moved. ''There is no sensible reason at all,'' he said.
In addition, the discoloration of the soil around each body proved
conclusively that flesh had rotted away at that site.
Ropes, belts, and masks found in the graves and their position
strongly suggested that, when applied, there was a layer of soft tissue
between them and the underlying bones.
''I say again, it is ludicrous to contemplate that each individual
body sufficiently decomposed to allow bones to fall off but still with
muscles and tissue sufficient to rot, was then transported from some
place to Cromwell Street,'' he said.
Mr Leveson asked the jury to consider the possibility that Frederick
West was solely responsible for the dismemberment and mutilations and
burials.
How did this have a bearing on Mrs West?
''I have already said that the sexual activity must have involved both
and she, we submit, could not have been ignorant of what happened to
these girls afterwards,'' he said.
''Everything that happened afterwards must have taken some time . . .
and, more important, it must have involved a considerable mess.''
He continued: ''What was Frederick West wearing as he carried out this
task? However he did the task, Mrs West could not, we submit, have
remained in ignorance.''
Mr Leveson told the jury that, when the bodies were discovered, police
had to travel back over a 20-year period to find out what had happened
and so discover who was responsible.
An essential part of the investigation was to discover the identity of
each person. Identification had to be proved as conclusively as
possible, not just for the purposes of prosecution but also vital for
those whose granddaughters, daughters, sisters or friends had
disappeared all these years ago.
Mr Leveson explained that the Crown was not in a position to prove
precisely how any girl was attacked, the full extent of any force used
upon her, or the precise reason for her death.
''With only skeletal remains, we do not know if she was strangled or
suffocated. We cannot even say that she was not stabbed in such a way as
not to mark any of the bones which were recovered,'' he said.
''Nevertheless, I have no doubt that you will have no difficulty
whatsover in concluding that each of these girls was subject to unlawful
force, force which wasn't in self defence, which caused death.''
The circumstances were plain and the inference or conclusion of sexual
abuse obvious.
''Remember their age and their sex and what happened to Caroline
Owens.''
Both Rosemary and Frederick West were fined after admitting a sexual
attack on Caroline Owens, the jury has been told.
''Remember the masking tape and the bindings found with the remains of
all but two of the girls, demonstrating restraint under which each was
held,'' he said.
''Further, whilst some clothing may well have had to be removed before
the girls were dismembered, perhaps some bindings were around their
limbs when recovered and none had any clothing on. The only proper
conclusion -- each was naked at the time that she met her death,''
counsel continued.
Further graphic illustrations came from Lynda Gough with the ring mask
of adhesive tape, Shirley Hubbard with the terrible mask, Juanita Mott
with the clothesline intertwined about her limbs, Alison Chambers with
the belt around the skull.
''There are others and they speak from the grave as to what had
happened to them,'' Mr Leveson declared.
Nobody would suggest that the force of the attacker or attackers was
anything other then unlawful.
The real issue in the case was likely to be whether or not the Crown
could prove that Mrs West was one of the attackers, or she acted as part
of a joint plan with Frederick West the ultimate result of which was to
murder,'' he said.
Mr Leveson insisted that Mrs West had to be involved at the very least
in enticing and encouraging a number of the victims to Cromwell Street.
Each of the girls had been subject of sexual abuse and violence. This
was at Cromwell Street, not just for a few minutes and not merely at the
behest of Frederick West. At the very least, Caroline Owens had been the
start and it was Mrs West who had been the first to attack her in the
car and she had been fully involved in the attack when the girl was
taken back to Cromwell Street.
There were others who, it was felt correctly, could be trusted not to
complain -- a Miss A and Kathryn Halliday fall into that category.
''We also submit that the motives for the killings is either some
perverted sexual pleasure or to prevent complaints to the police,'' he
said.
''That involves Rosemary West just as much as it involves Frederick
West.
''All the reasons for justifying the conclusion that the girls had
been the subject of joint sexual abuse and violence apply equally to her
as to him,'' he said.
Even assuming Mrs West did not participate in disposing of and hiding
the bodies, she must have known it was going on.
In addition, Mrs West had lied consistently -- not least to Mrs Gough
at the very beginning -- the only parent to have got sufficiently far as
to knock on the door looking for her daughter. Mrs West was wearing her
daughter's slippers and her clothing was on a washing line. Mrs West had
said something about her daughter having gone to Weston super Mare.
Dealing with Charmaine, who disappeared at a former flat of the Wests
when she was eight, Mr Leveson said it was ludicrous to think that
Frederick West would have buried the body of this little girl -- who had
been born at a Coatbridge hospital -- in the very small flat that was 25
Midland Road unless his then young live-in girlfriend (Rosemary) was
fully involved.
''After all, why not bury her with Charmaine's mother or with the
other women, Ann McFall, both found in the field miles away from Midland
Road?''
It was also absurd that she was not killed in the flat -- the jury
would find it difficult to believe anyone would attempt to bring the
body into the flat with neighbours next door and above who would at
least have been likely to see what was happening.
The trial continues.

ROSEMARY West knew as long as 25 years ago that her husband Frederick
was capable of murder, Winchester Crown Court was told yesterday, writes
James McKillop.
In the early 70s, a doorstep confrontation between Frederick and
Rosemary West, in front of her parents, was described by Mrs West's
mother Daisy Letts, 76, from the witness box.
During the row, Mrs Letts said her daughter turned towards her father
and declared: ''You don't know him. You don't know him. There is nothing
he wouldn't do. He can murder,'' or something to that expression.
Mrs West had turned up at her parents' home near Cheltenham with her
then four-month-old daughter Heather -- said to be one of the 10 murder
victims.
The first witness to give evidence at the trial of her daughter, who
is charged with murdering 10 young women or girls, Mrs Letts said it was
clear that her daughter had fallen out with Mr West and intended to
stay.
She recalled that hours after her daughter arrived at her home, Mr
West turned up at the door and demanded that she return home with him.
She was very quiet, said Mrs Letts, but it was obvious she was
frightened of him.
''My husband stood next to her at the door and I stood behind Rosie,''
she continued.
''Fred was saying 'Come on home. Come on home'.''
It was then, she alleged, her daughter turned to her father and
declared that Frederick West was capable of anything, including murder.
Both Mrs Letts and her daughter, Mrs Glenys Tyler -- Rosemary West's
elder sister -- told the court they were not surprised when they were
later told that Charmaine, daughter of Mr West and his first wife Rena
-- and another alleged victim -- had left Gloucester and returned with
her mother to live in Scotland.
Charmaine was born at the Alexandra Hospital, Coatbridge, on March 22,
1963. She disappeared from the West's flat at 25 Midland Road,
Gloucester, aged about eight. Skeletal remains found in that flat are
said to be hers.
At the time of her disappearance, her mother Rena and a Scottish girl
who babysat for her, Anne McFall, were both dead, and buried in a field
some distance away, the court has been told.
Mrs West is not charged with killing either of these women.
Mrs Letts told the court Rosemary West was the fifth of seven
children. She left school aged 15 and started work in a baker's shop.
She did not go out much -- only to the shops to run errands.
Shortly after she began work Frederick West came to her home. ''I
didn't have a chance to get on with him,'' she said. ''I only met him
the once he came to the house.
''We just thought that what he was telling us wasn't the truth. We
didn't take to him really.'' She said Mr West boasted that he owned a
hotel in Scotland, and also a caravan site. He was 27, much older than
her daughter.
Mrs Letts agreed that because of the relationship with her husband,
who has since died, she contacted the social services and Rosemary was
taken into care. When she reached the age of 16 she went to live with
Frederick West in a caravan.
He already had two children, Charmaine and Anna-Marie.
She did not learn that Rosemary was pregnant until she arrived at her
door with four-month-old Heather on the day of the doorstep row.
Eventually she left, despite her father trying to get her to stay at
home.
Mrs Letts said that after the Wests moved to 25 Midland Road, she went
to the flat about three times in all.
Asked about Charmaine, Mrs Letts smiled in the witness box and said:
''She was a lovely little girl, a happy little girl.''
''Rosemary seemed to keep the children nice. She kept their hair
nice.''
She did her best to look after the two young girls and her baby
Heather. But she was just a child herself.
Mrs Letts said she never saw much of her grandchildren. Initially,
they did visit the Wests' new home in Cromwell Street, to see if their
daughter was all right, because they were worried about Mr West. Her
daughter was always there -- Mr West wasn't.

<HEADLINE>Kitchen encounter upset neighbour's daughter</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<TEXT>
A FORMER neighbour, Mrs Shirley Giles, told the court of an incident
in the 1970s when her family was living at 25 Midland Road, Gloucester,
where the Wests had the downstairs flat.
Mrs Giles said one morning she sent her seven-year-old daughter Tracey
to borrow some milk from Rosemary West but when she returned Tracey was
''very upset''.
Later, she confronted Mrs West about what Tracey had seen taking place
in the kitchen.
Charmaine had been standing on a chair or stool with her hands
strapped behind her back. Rosemary was standing behind her waving a
wooden spoon as if she were going to smack her with it.
Mrs Giles said: ''She said Charmaine had been naughty and she had to
teach her a lesson; that she had to be taught wrong from right.''
Describing Mrs West's relationship with her step-daughter, Charmaine,
Mrs Giles said the little girl was lively and there often seemed to be a
''clash of personalities'' with Mrs West.
''Rosemary West sometimes complained about Charmaine being very wilful
and it used to get her down.''
Mrs Giles said Tracey was very close to Charmaine and treated her as
her ''first, best friend''.
When the Giles family moved away to Cinderford, Gloucestershire, in
summer 1971, there had been a tearful departure.
Frederick West was in prison at the time, she recalled.
Mrs Giles said she had promised Tracey that she would take her back to
Midland Road to see Charmaine but when she did so, she was told
Charmaine had left to go and live with her mother.
Mr Leveson read to the jury a letter which Mrs Giles had sent to West
in Leyhill prison, near Bristol.
It began: ''Dear Fred, Just a line at long last. Hope you are still
behaving yourself in that lovely holiday camp.''
It invited him to visit her when he was released.
Of the account given by her daughter Tracey of what she had seen, Mrs
Giles agreed young children could exaggerate things.
She agreed her friendship with Mrs West had not been affected by what
her daughter had said, adding: ''We got on well.''
Mrs West was very young, perhaps 17, with two step-children and her
own baby, Heather.
Mrs Giles' daughter, Tracey Hammond, gave evidence afterwards. She
recalled living in a flat at Midland Road where the ''little girl
downstairs'' was a friend.
They saw each other quite often but did not go to the same school.
She recalled one morning when she went to Charmaine's flat to get
milk: ''I just barged in, I did not knock. There in front of me was my
friend Charmaine, on a chair.
''She was standing on the chair and there was a lady beside her and
she had this spoon in her hand. I still find it quite disturbing.''
She said Charmaine was to one side of her and she thought that she had
asked for the milk.
''Charmaine was standing and she had her hands behind her back and she
was sideways on.
''Then I saw a huge leather belt, a brown leather belt she had on her
wrists and the actual prong of the belt was sticking into the actual
leather of the belt. That is about it. I don't remember leaving the
room. I don't remember really anything much after that.''
Her family later moved from Midland Road to Cinderford and she could
remember returning to her former home at number 25 on only one occasion.
She did not see Charmaine but asked after her.
''I said, 'Where is Charmaine?' and the lady said, 'She has gone to
her mother's and bloody good riddance'.''
She said that, after the incident, she could not recollect anything
about her relationship with Charmaine.
She agreed that when she made her statement to police, she knew
Charmaine was dead and had read various accounts in newspapers.
Mr Ferguson, QC, asked: ''Might that have played on your
imagination?''
Ms Hammond said: ''No.''

ITV watchdogs are heading for a showdown with television chiefs over a
decision to delay News At Ten for a rape scene in the police drama
Cracker.
The Independent Television Commission said the shift was a breach of
its rules and could result in large fines or a shortening of ITV's
licence.
ITV has moved the news in next Monday's evening schedule because the
first episode of the drama, starring Robbie Coltrane, is 15 minutes
longer than normal.
The shift was proposed by Mr Marcus Plantin, ITV's network director,
and agreed by the ITV broadcast board who apparently failed to alert the
watchdog body.
The ITC, according to reports, is furious it was not consulted about
the rescheduling. Under its powers, it can regulate retrospectively by
imposing warnings, fines, or even shortening a company's licence.
Under their licences, ITV companies must broadcast 30 minutes of
international news in peak time between 6pm and 10.30pm. Delaying News
At Ten would mean running half the bulletin outside the peak period.
An ITC spokesman said: ''We are rather surprised. We were not
consulted about this and are going to look further into it.''
ITV insisted the bulletin's delay would be a one-off, allowing the
75-minute episode a prominent slot after the 9pm watershed. The
programme makers viewed this as important because it starts with a
brutal rape scene.

THE Scottish Tory chairman, Sir Michael Hirst, claimed last night that
a new analysis of expenditure and revenue published by the Scottish
Office proved that Scotland was far better off as a partner within the
United Kingdom.
Sir Michael said the analysis made ''a total mockery of SNP financial
jiggery pokery'' and highlighted what he said would be the crippling
cost of constitutional change.
''Those who seek that need to be aware that if they succeed in
breaking up the UK, there would be a #7000m black hole that the Scottish
taxpayer would have to fill,'' Sir Michael said.
According to the analysis, Scotland was running a non-oil fiscal
deficit of #8100m in 1993/94. With 90% of oil revenues and a pro-rata
share of privatisation proceeds also allocated to Scotland, the deficit
was still running at #6500m in 1993/94.
The estimated non-oil deficit -- 15% of Scottish gross domestic
product compared with 8.5% for the UK as a whole in the same year --
immediately turned into a political football, with the Scottish National
Party claiming the figures had been concocted at ministerial behest for
political ends.
SNP leader Alex Salmond complained of a ''blatantly political
exercise''. He claimed that if oil figures were taken into account, and
updated to today's levels, Scotland would have a surplus of #200m.
''As a former Scottish Office economist, I deplore the fact that the
economics and statistics branch are being dragooned and prostituted into
service by Michael Forsyth, the new governor-general,'' he said.
Among the several points on which the SNP took issue was the area of
''non-identifiable'' expenditure -- Government spending that cannot be
precisely tied to one geographic area.
Mr Salmond said South-east England benefited disproportionately from
this and pointed to money spent on infrastructure in London's docklands,
the number of civil servants in the South-east, and higher levels of
defence spending in the South.
The Shadow Scottish Secretary, Mr George Robertson, raised the spectre
of public resources being used for political ends. ''The timing of this
exercise is deeply suspicious,'' he said. ''It smacks of the taxpayer
subsidising party propaganda.
''What is clear is that Scotland's financial position is nowhere near
as bleak as the Tories make out or as rosy as the SNP claim. The truth
lies between the two and Labour will ensure that Scotland will continue
to receive her fair share of national resources as at present.''
Mr Malcolm Bruce, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, said the
figures were a red herring, proved nothing, and were ''totally
irrelevant'' to the argument over a Scottish parliament.
''It isn't about how much Scotland should get, but who should decide
how the resources are allocated. A directly elected Scottish parliament
should make those decisions, not a Secretary of State with the support
of only one in eight Scots,'' Mr Bruce said.
''No-one who supports a Scottish parliament is saying that we should
change the way of allocating funds. The Barnett formula has served
Scotland well, and it is only vindictive and increasingly desperate
Tories who suggest it should be swept away with home rule.''
The Scottish Office rejected SNP claims that civil servants had
''prostituted '' themselves. In a statement, it said the analysis was
part of the normal monitoring of the UK and Scottish economies and that
the figures were based on analytically sound methodology.
''Ministers were not involved in drawing up the content of the
document,'' the statement said.
In fact the analysis was promised last June by former Scottish
Secretary Ian Lang when he appeared before the Select Committee on
Scottish Affairs. Officials insisted the timing of its release, just
before the Tory Party conference at Blackpool, was fortuitous.
At a briefing yesterday, officials cautioned that the numbers were, in
some cases, indicative because of the lack of precise data on Scotland's
share of some expenditure and income from taxes, like corporation tax.
The analysis showed that, in 1993/94, total government expenditure in
Scotland stood at an estimated #28.4bn, 10% of the UK total. Scotland's
population share in 1993 was 8.8%.
But, under the Barnett formula, annual changes in 97% of the budget
allocated to the Scottish Office are governed by a percentage (10.66%)
of changes in the equivalent UK budgets.
The biggest single expenditure programme in Scotland, social security,
which accounted for #7640m in 1993/94, was only 3% higher than the
English share.
The Scottish Office paper makes clear that in areas like health and
education, the higher levels of spending are justified by factors like
higher morbidity rates, sparser population, and higher participation
rates.
The other side of the balance sheet -- government revenues from taxes,
social security contributions, and other sources -- shows Scotland
contributing an estimated #20.4bn, an 8.9% share of the UK total.

A COUPLE fly out on a delayed honeymoon today after the bridegroom was
charged with an alleged wedding day fracas.
Mr Gordon Harrison was detained at the weekend with his brother,
David, an usher, and another wedding guest.
He was locked up in the cells at a Glasgow police station when he
should have been flying to San Francisco with his bride.
Yesterday, Mr Harrison, 25, was given bail at Glasgow District Court
when he appeared on breach of the peace and police assault charges.
The incident is alleged to have happened during his wedding reception
at Glasgow's Grosvenor Hotel in Hillhead.
Mr Harrison's bride of two days waited nervously outside the court to
see if they would be able to go on their honeymoon.
Afterwards, their solicitor, Mr Joe Beltrami, said: ''The young couple
will be flying out from London in the morning.
''The police could have used a bit of discretion and asked my clients
for an undertaking to appear in court in a fortnight. That happens
regularly in drunk driving cases.
''These young men, who have never been in trouble in their lives,
would have readily accepted an undertaking to appear and the young
couple could have flown off to San Francisco as planned on Sunday
morning.
''I shall be writing to the police asking why this was not done. After
all, they weren't charged with the crime of the century.''
Mr Harrison, a self-employed tiler, of Tollcross Road, Glasgow, and
his brother David, 31, an oil rig electrician, of Merlewood Avenue,
Gorbals, denied the charges.
In the dock with them was Mr Derek Cochrane, 24, of Prosen Street,
Tollcross.
They all denied a breach of the peace by conducting themselves in a
disorderly manner, shouting, swearing, and fighting and struggling with
police.
Gordon Harrison also denied seizing an officer by the throat, jumping
on his back, and knocking him down. David denied punching another
policeman.
Trial was fixed for next January and bail was allowed after the court
heard that the accused had no previous convictions.

A WITNESS in a murder trial denied yesterday that he was a ''man of
violence'' feared by his local community.
Mr Alan Murdoch, 29, agreed, however, that the citizens of Craigneuk
in Lanarkshire ''rose in numbers'' to hound him and his family out of
the area.
He claimed that this was because he had been blamed wrongly for the
murder of a local man, Mr Douglas Bryce, 21, who was shot dead in the
town in August last year.
Mr Murdoch, who gave his new address as c/o the police, told the High
Court in Glasgow that two of the three men accused of murdering Mr Bryce
organised demonstrations and marches against him and his two brothers.
He said newspapers published photographs showing Mr William Longmire
and Mr John McNeil leading some of the marches.
Mr Longmire, 32, Mr McNeil, 27, and Mr Derek McCreaddie, 19, deny
murdering Mr Bryce by shooting him near his home in Meadowhead Road,
Craigneuk, on August 25 last year, and trying to kill Mr Murdoch during
the same alleged incident by shooting him in the leg.
Mr Longmire and Mr McNeil have lodged a special defence blaming the
murder on Mr Murdoch.
The two also deny attempting to murder Mr Murdoch's brother, William,
32, during an earlier incident on May 3 when it is alleged that they
fired shots at him outside his former home at Golfhill Road, Craigneuk.
During his second day in the witness box yesterday, Mr Murdoch told
Miss Rita Rae, QC, and Mr Donald Findlay, QC, defending Mr Longmire and
Mr McNeil, that locally he had been blamed wrongly for Mr Bryce's
murder.
He also denied he had been ''looking for'' Mr Bryce earlier in the
evening.
Miss Rae told him there was evidence that he told the dead man's
mother: ''I have done Dougie.''
Mr Murdoch denied this and said Mrs Bryce's head had been filled with
propaganda to make it look as if he had done it.
He admitted, however, that he did not name Mr Longmire as the man who
shot him until February this year, when he was taken to court to give a
statement under oath.
He added: ''At that time, I didn't want to say anything because the
people who did it were still running about.''
The trial continues.

yesterday which will allow him to challenge the Parole Board's decision
not to recommend parole next year. Peter Clowes, 52, of Wilmslow,

<HEADLINE>TUC halts Forsyth bid to create Labour split. Christie HIE invitation rejected.</HEADLINE>

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth tried to drive a wedge through the
Labour movement by rejecting nominees for a place on the board of
Highlands and Islands Enterprise, while suggesting that only STUC
general secretary Campbell Christie would be acceptable, it emerged last
night.
The issue passed through last week's general council meeting of the
STUC relatively unnoticed amid the furore over the Scottish
Constitutional Convention plans.
However, The Herald understands that the council, depleted by those
absent at the Labour conference in Brighton, voted by just nine votes to
five to block Mr Christie's acceptance of the place on the HIE board,
after those put forward by the congress were turned down for the post.
One STUC insider said: ''Michael Forsyth's clear strategy is to offer
Campbell Christie a place on everything and offer no-one else anything.
Then if he turns it down because of pressure of work or for any other
reason, he can say so be it. Frankly, it is not a very sophisticated
strategy.''
However, a spokesman for the Scottish Office said last night that, in
common with other bodies, appointments to HIE were made on merit.
It is true Mr Forsyth was keen to appoint Mr Christie, the spokesman
said, and was disappointed not to have the benefit of his undoubted
talent and expertise.
''The Secretary of State understands the considerable contribution Mr
Christie makes to public life and why he felt unable to take the
appointment, and appreciated his willingness to consider it.
''The appointment for the unfilled vacancy will be made in due
course,'' the spokesman added.
Others see the move in the specific context of the Scottish
Secretary's more interventionist style and his new listening mode, which
extended to a recent highly public audience with the STUC leadership, at
which some thought Mr Christie was used as a propaganda patsy by Mr
Forsyth.
After that meeting, Mr Christie agreed to hold a joint press
conference with the Secretary of State, resulting in a presentation by
Mr Forsyth which drove a wedge between historic partners in the Labour
movement.
Mr Forsyth made it clear at the time that he regarded that meeting as
a successful attempt to re-invent himself as a consensus politician on
the Scottish scene, and Labour politicians were privately furious at the
way Mr Christie had allowed himself to be used.
Mr Forsyth has subsequently taken one of the suggestions put by the
STUC at that meeting, the bolstering of the moribund industrial forum
the Scottish Economic Council, but turned this on its head, using it as
an argument for rejecting the need for a Scottish Parliament.
Of the latest controversy, Mr Christie said last night: ''I would not
describe the HIE board post as an offer. We have been anxious to have
more trade union involvement in public bodies. Shortly after we met
Michael Forsyth, the HIE were approached and were told the Secretary of
State would be appointing to their board.
''We suggested some trade union people who were active in their area
and could make a contribution. A few days before the general council
meeting, the Scottish Office asked to have a word with us and said the
nominations we had made were not as experienced as the Secretary of
State wanted, and he would not be inclined to appoint. If, however, I
was available, he might favourably consider.''
With STUC blessing, Mr Christie has already accepted board positions
on the Glasgow Development Agency and, more controversially, on the
Falkirk Royal Infirmary NHS Trust, where the feeling was that it was
better to have trade union involvement than none.
Of the Highlands and Island Enterprise post, Mr Christie said: ''I
said it was unlikely I would have the time to be involved in HIE, given
commitments elsewhere, but if that was the only way to get trade union
representation in there, I would accept.''
Mr Christie said he put the issue to the general council in neutral
terms and fully accepted its decision, which had been based both on the
factor of how much time he could devote to the post and to the general
principle that the organisation should put forward nominees, not the
Government.
One trade union source told The Herald: ''Campbell has to be extremely
careful that he is not simply being used by Michael Forsyth. There is a
danger that such approaches could be construed as blandishments.''
Another general council member said Mr Christie's rebuff of Shadow
Scottish Secretary George Robertson over the detail of the Scottish
Parliament scheme ''was principled'' but added that ''his courting of Mr
Forsyth was plain stupid''.

THE long-awaited Bosnian ceasefire was delayed just hours before it
came into force last night. After a day of Nato air attacks and shelling
by Bosnian Serb heavy weapons, officials urged the warring factions to
show restraint.
But all sides moved fiercely to seize as much territory as possible --
particularly in northern and western Bosnia -- before fighting comes to
an end.
Hasan Muratovic, the Bosnian Minister in charge of relations with the
United Nations, said: ''It will not happen because the conditions have
not been met yet.''
Talks to confirm the ceasefire, which was originally intended to come
into force at one minute past midnight, broke down after it proved
impossible to restore gas and electricity supplies to Sarajevo in time.
The Bosnian government had made the restoration of utilities to Sarajevo
a pre-condition for signing the ceasefire.
However, the Russian government last night told the US it had turned
on the natural gas supply to Bosnia. ''Russian Foreign Minister Andrei
Kozyrev told Ambassador Thomas Pickering that the Russian gas is on its
way,'' said a US spokesman.
UN and British officials were confident that supplies would be
connected within the next 48 hours and that a genuine ceasefire would
come into force.
There was confusion about Russia's delay in resuming gas supplies to
Bosnia with a Russian Foreign Ministry official citing ''technical
reasons''.
Mr Muratovic stressed his government and the Bosnian Serbs had made
great efforts to meet the deadline and insisted a truce would begin as
soon as the supplies were connected.
Attacks by Nato jets that destroyed a Bosnian Serb command and control
bunker around the Bosnian stronghold of Tuzla in northern Bosnia had no
impact on ceasefire talks.
The town of Zivinice, where a Bosnian Serb bomb killed 10 people on
Sunday, was shelled again yesterday killing two people and wounding 10.
