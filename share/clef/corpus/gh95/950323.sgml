SCOTTISH &amp; Universal Newspapers, Scotland's largest weekly newspaper
group, is to invest #9.5m in centralising its printing operations in a
new full-colour printing facility together with two publishing lines to
be installed at Blantyre Park in Lanarkshire.
The move is seen at S&amp;UN as a ''tremendous vote of confidence'' by
parent company Trinity International Holdings, the regional newspapers
group which purchased it from Lonrho in 1993.
S&amp;UN's group financial director John Williams said: ''This is the
biggest investment in the history of Scottish &amp; Universal Newspapers and
is probably the biggest investment ever by a regional weekly newspaper
group in Scotland.''
The company has signed a letter of intent to purchase a MAN Uniset
high-volume, full-colour web-offset press with a speed of 60,000 copies
per hour. By late 1996, the group's 34 titles will be distributed from a
new hi-tech factory at the greenfield site between Hamilton and East
Kilbride.
S&amp;UN director Alex Lumsden said: ''Pagination restrictions and lack of
colour on our existing preses have meant we have been unable to maximise
the opportunities which would otherwise have been open to the group.
This investment will give us the capability to print all our titles at
one centre. We will have the capacity for producing 32 pages of full
colour in a 72-page paper. We will have maximum pagination of 160
tabloid pages. The new site gives us a quick and convenient access to
the motorway network for nationwide distribution purposes.''
It is intended that the new press will also be used to contract
printing by other newspaper companies.
There will be closures at present printing operations at Irvine,
Hamilton, and Perth but S&amp;UN but job losses could be minimal, as little
as single figures. A lot could depend on whether members of the
workforce would be prepared to travel and also embrace the new
technology. In the longer term, there should be a net gain in numbers
because of increased distribution.
Meanwhile Trinity International, which also owns the Liverpool Echo
and Daily Post and the Huddersfield Daily Examiner, has lifted overall
profits 15.2% for 1994 from #19.854m to a record #22.877m before tax.
The dividend total is lifted from 9.7p to 10.7p with a final of 7.4p on
earnings per share up from 20.2p to 24p. The shares closed 1p lower at
354p.
In Scotland, increased revenues from the growth in advertising
volumes, together with the continuing benefits of cost savings from the
pre-press rationalisation, resulted in improved operating margins.
Circulation revenues again held up well with some titles showing
year-on-year increases, and leaflet volumes continued to grow.
Elsewhere, Trinity reported that in Merseyside, North Wales, and
Cheshire, advertising revenue grew encouragingly and the year finished
with a strong performance in the last quarter, especially at the
Liverpool Echo.

GLASGOW-based Luddon Construction has won the #1.5m maintenance
contract for BP Chemicals' 500-acre site at Grangemouth for the eighth
year in a row.
The civil engineering company had to fight its corner in a competitive
tendering situation.
Luddon has also received BP Chemicals' safety award for its work at
Grangemouth over the past year. Its operatives worked more than 80,000
man hours with only one minor injury.
Mr Charlie Frize, contracts director of Luddon Construction, said:
''We are delighted to continue to work with BP Chemicals. This is a very
important contract and we are pleased to win it on merit.''

A GOOD performance at Thistle Aggregates from the five former Tarmac
quarries in the north and east of Scotland provided the backbone of
Bruntcliffe Aggregates' 247% leap in pre-tax profits to #2.33m last
year.
This activity will perform a similar role in 1995. Chief executive
Mike Wallis is looking forward to an increase in road expenditure in the
medium-term in the north of Scotland after a hiatus in 1994 caused by
local government reorganisation. During that time, sales of the
company's coated stone fell 17%.
However, other products such as dry stone improved and particularly
agricultural limestone containing magnesium where prices rose by nearly
50% for the product quarried at Ullapool and transported to Inverness,
the Black Isle, and Aberdeenshire.
Profits for the current year should reach about #3m which would leave
the shares at 29p trading at about nine times likely earnings.
The dividend total has been raised 150% to 1.25p with a 0.85p final
for a 5.4% yield. One to follow.

Mr John McAllion, the party's housing spokesman, also called for
legislation to help deal with the problem of homelessness.
''The continuing scandal of half a million Scots living with dampness

THE Kurds are an unfortunate people in that their habitat contradicts
one of the basic assumptions of modern times -- they live in no single
state but are parcelled out between several. Kurdish lands stretch form
south eastern Anatolia across Iraq into Iran. North and south of that
area there are other detachments in Syria and in what used to be Russian
Transcaucasia. With all of these state authorities the Kurds have come
into conflict, and their latest encounter with the Turkish army is
simply the most recent in a long series. They have always been a
difficult people -- a bitter Kurdish saying recounts much of their
history: ''A Kurd has no friends'' -- but that need not always be true
for, from time to time, the minority coexists quietly within a wider
authority, an experience which fits Iran, Iraq, and Turkey itself.
Kurdish consciousness makes for problems and, in a region not renowned
for tolerance, seems to provoke strong reactions, which in turn
stimulates Kurdish violence.
From outside the region the obvious solution is some degree of
autonomy, but that might cut across competing sovereignties, so the
local powers see things differently, preferring to try military
solutions. This latest effort deploys large numbers of Turkish troops
and air power (Iran's latest efforts, under the Shah, were very similar
and Iraq has deployed chemical weapons like the sarin at present in the
news in Japan). Such efforts do not seem to work. The terrain and the
way the Kurds flit across international frontiers make military
certainties impossible, hence the considerable Turkish penetration into
northern Iraq which ought to bring them up against the UN proclaimed
Kurdish safe haven (even though it was intended to afford protection
from Saddam Hussein). It seems safe to assume that the Turks will not
win, but in their case the Kurdish reaction already involves third
parties: Turkish workers in Germany are the targets of the Kurdish
expatriate terrorists. Like terrorists everywhere these are hard to
counter, especially in liberal societies. In Germany the strains are
already evident with militant Kurds, never mind actual terrorists, in
some lander facing deportation to Turkey which is not a prospect any
will relish.
If the present fighting is not popular among Turks living abroad, it
seems to be quite popular at home. Some observers even suspect that the
motives of the Ankara Government in launching its most recent Kurdish
operations include the hope that these will divert attention from
demands by Islamic extremists for changes in Turkey's secular
constitution which would defer to Muslim fundamentalism. The Government
is in much the same position as, say, Egypt or Algeria: it is fighting
back, but the balance of power is delicately poised. Popular diversions
are welcome. Maintaining them, however, does nothing to further the
country's main policy aim to join the European Union, which would
enhance both the economy and political stability. The methods used in
Kurdistan are excessive, while the need to restrain the fundamentalists
compromises the civil liberties dear to the hearts of the country's
would-be European partners. The West wants to help Turkey but finds it
very hard to do so for reasons which the Kurdish campaign merely
underline.

A MAJOR package of measures has been agreed to curb flooding on the
River Irvine, which caused widespread damage when it overflowed its
banks last December.
Irvine Development Corporation, in partnership with Strathclyde
Regional Council and Cunninghame District Council, is to spend #490,000
on remedial and refurbishment work.
The river bank will be raised at Waterside, where dozens of houses
were flooded for several days, and work will be carried out at Carson
Drive to prevent river erosion.
The corporation will also spend more than #350,000, with help from
Euro funds, on the reconstruction of the weir. Sheet piling and
reinforced concrete will strengthen the weir, while a combined canoe and
fish pass will be retained.
Canoe and small boat enthusiasts are also to be catered for with a
#50,000 injection from Enterprise Ayrshire to build an access road and
launching ramps on the west bank of the river alongside the Marress
sports ground.

The former Ferrari Formula 2 driver, who set up TF Fabrication in
Glenrothes four years ago, believes the expansion into recession-hit
North-east Fife will boost his workforce of 18 to more than 50 by the
end of next year.
TF's move into 53,000sq ft premises in Tayport is receiving financial

EDINBURGH-based American Trust anticipates lower earnings per share in
the current financial year because of its decision to sacrifice some
short-term income for longer-term earnings growth.
Consequently, the investment trust held its final dividend at 3.6p,
with the total payout for the year to end-January only 0.1p higher at
5.5p.
Net asset value fell 10.7% to 275.8p during the 12 months. In the US,
where 88% of the #230m blue-chip focused fund was invested at January
31, the Standard &amp; Poor's index fell only 7.9% in sterling terms.
However, 8% of the Edinburgh Fund Managers-run trust was invested in
the UK, where the FTSE All-Share index suffered a 15.2% setback. The
trust's Latin American holdings took a battering from the Mexican
financial crisis, which began late last year.
Earnings per share were 9.1% higher at 5.99p, boosted by higher than
expected dividends, particularly from Edinburgh Fund Managers.
American Trust, which aims for long-term capital and income growth,
has switched from investments held for current income to US shares which
it expects to produce greater income growth in the future.
However, Colin Ross, chairman of Edinburgh Fund Managers, was ''99%
certain'' that the dividend would be at least maintained this year.
During the year, American Trust sold half of its interest in Edinburgh
Fund Managers for about #10m.
The trust's Latin American holdings, concentrated in Mexico, had
fallen about 40% from their year-highs by January 31, when they
accounted for 4% of the fund.
However, the trust is committed to retaining its holdings because of
the region's growth potential, pointing out that their relatively small
presence would not seriously affect the portfolio in the event of
another calamity.
This time last year, trust chairman Lord Macfarlane of Bearsden warned
about the effects of the turn in the interest rate cycle which began
last February.
Mulling over the current uncertainty surrounding the extent of further
US interest rate rises, he said: ''Equity valuations appear reasonable
against this scenario, with upward potential if overheating of the
economy is prevented whilst maintaining a sustainable level of economic
growth.''
Mr Ross said: ''On balance, I think we believe we are nearing the end
of the restrictive period, so we are probably near the top of short-term
interest rates.''

A SKYE mother-of-two is the first unemployed woman in Britain to
achieve the highest possible vocational qualification in management.
Audrey Parker, 37, of Achachork, by Portree on Skye, has achieved the
Scotvec-MCI (Management Charter Initiative) Diploma in Management Level
5. Earler this week she was presented with the certificate by Ross,
Cromarty and Skye MP Charles Kennedy at a ceremony at the Lochalsh Hotel
in Kyle.
Mr Kennedy said Mrs Parker achievement was ''tremendously
significant'' -- not only for herself but for other women eager to work
or get training in remote areas like Skye and Lochalsh.
Though Mrs Parker currently works as employment adviser and back to
work team leader at the Employment Services in Portree on Skye, she
completed the diploma in just three months last year while unemployed.
Scotvec director Margery Burdon who also attended the presentation
said Audrey's achievement marked a milestone in Scotvec's 10-year
history as no-one achieved this level in such a short time with her own
staff taking up to 18 months to complete it.
Glasgow-based Management Introductions, who conducted the course on
behalf of Skye and Lochalsh Local Enterprise said the diploma was the
highest vocational qualification attainable and that Henley College in
England had contacted it wanting to know how Mrs Parker had achieved it
so quickly.
To attain the diploma, managers are examined through an
''accreditation of prior to learning'' system whereby evidence of their
competence as a manager is provided by testimonies from people in their
previous employment which are set against a framework of national
standards. It also involves a hefty element of written work to show
competence in finance and personnel skills.
Management Introductions Business Development director Bill Gallaher
said that though the diploma had been in existence for two years only
employed people had achieved it until now.
''They go out and get a job then apply to do the diploma. Audrey was
different, she had to get her brain in gear and recall how she did these
things according to national standards,'' said Mr Gallaher.
Mrs Parker was a manager in both the public and private sector since
the age of 25 when she became office manager for RCA in Galloway. After
having her son Jason at 27 she became a youth leader for six months
before entering the employment service in 1986 and worked in their
Dumfries, Forfar, and Dundee offices.
But promotion for her husband Michael to the Scottish Office
Agriculture and Fisheries Department on Skye meant that Mrs Parker
experienced a two-year spell on the other side of the employment service
counter. ''Living on Skye and being out of work gives you a better
appreciation of what it's like to be unemployed in a remote area,'' she
said.
''Although Galloway is a rural area it is certainly not as isolated as
Skye where the geographical distances mean you can't attend a university
or college.''
Both Dr Burdon and chief executive Lorne MacLeod of Skye and Lochalsh
Local Enterprise -- which financed the course -- said Mrs Parker was an
excellent role model for others attempting to qualify for the diploma.

A MANAGEMENT group has bought New South Mills from Sidlaw Group, which
expects to realise over #2m from the transaction.
A new company, whose shareholders are a former director, members of
the management, and institutional and other investors, has agreed to pay
#1.318m for the Dundee-based business.
The initial payment is to be #243,000 on completion, with the balance
payable in two instalments of #500,000 and #575,000 respectively on
September 30, 1995 and 1996. Debtors less creditors, which are excluded
from the sale, are expected to realise #700,000.
New South Mills was formerly part of the face yarns division of Sidlaw
Textiles, and its disposal marks the final step in the group's decisions
to sell its textile interests.
Sidlaw's chief executive, Digby Morrow, said: ''We are pleased to have
completed the sale of the group's textile interests and to have
preserved the continuity of the face yarns business.
''We wish the new management and employees of the business every
success in the future.''
Bank borrowings are to be reduced as a result of the deal.

MORE than 250 new jobs will be created in the Aberdeen area when
Britain's largest DIY store opens next week.
The warehouse-type store is a #6m B&amp;Q supercentre which represents the
most advanced of its kind to date, the home improvements retail giant
said yesterday.
It is the first in a new generation of DIY warehouses with four more
planned throughout the UK during 1995. One is due to open in Glasgow in
the second half of the year.
Aberdonian Ronnie Stephen is in charge of the new North-east store. He
has seven managers working with him. They head a total staff of 280, the
bulk of whom are new starts.
The Aberdeen development opens on March 31 and takes up 135,000 sq ft,
almost three times larger than the average DIY superstore.
Mr Stephen said his staff had merchandised and planned their store
layout themselves. ''They have undergone intensive training to develop
knowledge of 40,000 product lines.''
Bill Whiting, marketing director, with overall responsibility for B&amp;Q
warehouses throughout Britain, said economies of scale meant the
Aberdeen development would offer the lowest prices on all products.

SCOTTISH Friendly Assurance, which has changed its name and become
incorporated within the last three years, yesterday officially opened
new #5m headquarters.
The society's move to new offices in Glasgow's Blythswood Square, home
to the major accountancy firm KPMG and the Royal Automobile Club, is
partly the result of the plethora of new financial services which the
1992 Friendly Societies Act allows it to offer.
Derek Lee, the London-based chairman of the Friendly Societies
Commission, declared Scottish Friendly House open yesterday, even though
staff transferred from 200 Bath Street in November.
Although 133 years old, Scottish Friendly, whose image transformation
encompassed its change of name from the City of Glasgow Friendly Society
in 1992, has undergone a process of dramatic change in recent times.
In the wake of the Act, it has augmented its traditional home
collection-orientated life insurance business with general
insurance-broking for clients.
Scottish Friendly, originally established by a group of workers who
wanted a friendly society of their own, this month launched its
unit-linked Scottish Investment Bond. This offers investors the fairly
unique option of a Scottish investment trust fund.
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke's increase in the limit for tax-free
investments in friendly societies in last November's Budget, to be
implemented in May, will provide another boost.
Scottish Friendly, which manages #130m of funds and has about 300,000
policyholders, is looking at the development of unit trusts and PEPs. It
could even move into residential care.
The society, incorporated in January 1994, spent about a year and
#2.5m on the refurbishment of its new headquarters, having bought the
23,000 sq ft building for #2.5m. It intends to lease half of it.
Scottish Friendly hopes the Blythswood Square building will have a
greater pull on independent financial advisers, as well as resulting in
improved customer service.
Chairman Ian Smail described the opening as a ''momentous stage in the
history of the Scottish Friendly Assurance Society Limited''.

GENERAL Cable indicated in May last year its intention to come to the
stock market, and it has now fixed the date as April 27, when it will
aim to raise between #198m and #220m, the exact amount depending on the
price to be decided nearer the time.
General Cable will have a capitalisation of up to #646m, which
compares with the #1500m market value of TeleWest, the only UK-listed
cable operator so far. Other companies such as Nynex UK and Bell
Multimedia are likely to follow.
Attracted by the low regulatory requirements in the UK, American cable
companies dominate the industry here, though General Cable is an
exception, being owned by the diversified French utility Compagnie
Generale des Eaux, which also has a major slice of the French cable
market. Apart from the need to raise money to pay for cable
installation, floating the companies on the UK stock market gives them a
more local feel.
General Cable's franchises cover 1,700,000 homes in west London,
Yorkshire and Birmingham. But it has been no more successful than others
in persuading people to be connected. Along with associates, it has
124,000 TV subscribers, 106,000 residential phone lines installed and
15,900 business lines. British consumers have not exactly been falling
over themselves to sign up for cable networks, partly because existing
terrestrial programming is adequate for most people.
The company has 14% of UK cable TV subscribers, 16% of cable-connected
telephone lines for residential use and 22% for business use. So it has
a reasonable share of the overall market.
There is no doubt it is developing into a major industry, if not quite
as rapidly as enthusiasts thought it would. It expects to take on 6400
new employees this year bringing the total to more than 26,000. Spending
is running at some #2000m a year, and a third of the country should be
covered by the end of 1995. For once these are real jobs in engineering,
construction, sales and customer services, and many are occurring in the
inner cities where employment is so urgently required.
Cable TV is actually a misnomer, at least as far as General Cable is
concerned, because telephone services are more important than television
to its subscribers. TV customers provided an average gross margin
(revenues minus programming and telephone interconnect charges) of #118
per subscriber, compared with #182 per residential telephone line and
#526 per business exchange line.
It is not surprising that the company is concentrating on developing
business telecommunications services. This also makes sense given its
Birmingham and west London franchises. The latter includes Heathrow
Airport and surrounding business parks.
The cable TV operators have a price advantage of 10%-15% over BT which
explains why they are all selling telephone connections. But it is a
risky strategy given BT's proven ability to strike back as its costs
fall. Mercury has found this out to its cost.
TeleWest appears to have a better balanced business and its offer for
sale was six times over-subscribed. General Cable is unlikely to prove
as popular, but there is little doubt its share offer will be
comfortably subscribed given the perceived long-term growth prospects of
the developing multi-media world.
Worthwhile profits are years away yet. General Cable expects to be
cash positive by the end of the year, though it will pay no dividends
for the foreseeable future. The fact the cable TV companies can raise
money easily in the City is one in the eye for those who say financial
institutions can only think in the short term.
The industry is developing fast and is fragmented, with many
franchises split several ways between different companies, but in the
end there will inevitably be consolidation, as is now happening in the
US. When this occurs it will be useful for the dominant operators to mop
up others with equity rather than cash given their heavy capital
commitments.
General Cable intends to issue up to 90 million shares, with 45%
offered in the US, where cable TV companies carry high ratings, and 45%
in the UK. The sponsor is Lazard Brothers.

NEIL MacMillan has been cutting suits for many years but you will not
find any of his customers walking down the High Street sporting their
made to measure garments.
You are more likely to find Neil's customers fully submerged in water
or at least up to their waist in it. Neil (pictured right) and his
partner Steve Curzon manufacture wet and dry suits for divers and breast
waders for anglers.
They launched their company Muir Deise a year ago, and since then have
found a big demand for their wet gear.
''We did not get any financial assistance from government grants,''
says Neil, ''there was too much hassle attached to getting the money and
we would have spent our time preparing reports rather than producing the
goods''.
The name Muir Deise is gaelic for ''ocean suits'', and the choice of
name is explained by the fact that Neil's father came from the Hebrides
and is a Gaelic speaker.
Although Muir Deise sells their various products to other specialist
outlets Neil says that many customers choose to come to their premises
in Robertson Street, Glasgow to be measured for their ''ocean suit''.
Muir Deise at presently concentrating on the Scottish market although
they have mail order customers from throughout the UK, and recently were
asked to supply sample suits to a store in Massachusetts.
In common with the more conventional suits Neil says water fashions
change and that more divers and surfers are opting for a dry rather than
a wet suit while the material commonly used is now neoprene.
''This material is a warmer fabric,'' explains Neil, who looks after
the production side of the business while his partner Steve takes care
of the finances.

IT'S thoroughly depressing to hear that Kenneth Clarke has put the
''feelgood factor'' on hold for several years. Most of us are not
terribly sure what the ''feelgood factor'' is, exactly: now we have to
wait longer to find out. When it finally arrives, we may discover it
doesn't apply across the board. So instead of rich and poor, we are
divided into feelgoods and feelbads.
''At the moment,'' said The Braces, ''I have a feelconned factor. This
is what you get when a politician promises you something, isn't able to
explain precisely what it is, then tells you -- sorry -- it's a bit
behind schedule.'' He sipped greyish coffee from his Nerd House paper
cup.
I said: ''If feelgood finally materialises, there's a possibility that
Kenneth Clarke might not still be in office. Therefore he's hardly
likely to refer to it. Therefore we might never learn what it's supposed
to be.''
Grim but true, agreed The Braces. Even worse, we had many more hurdles
to jump before that. He listed them as follows:
The feeldumb factor, in which Kenneth Clarke assures us that while
feelgood has not actually manifested itself, all the factors leading to
it are working away invisibly, and especially in Consett. Just look
around you: use your imagination.
The feeltwitchy factor, in which Kenneth Clarke allows more than a
fortnight to pass without mentioning the feelgood factor, and you wonder
whether he has forgotten about it. You wonder whether it would be a good
idea to jog his memory.
The feelsick factor, in which Kenneth Clarke starts mentioning
feelgood once again, hand over fist, and you know the Cabinet has
secretly agreed on a date for the General Election.
Ms Angelica Banana-Skyne, the High Whitecraigs polymath, had another
theory. ''Clarke's 'feelgood factor' is simply a replacement for
Lamont's 'green shoots of the economy', she said. ''Every Chancellor has
to have a slogan. I call it the OVUM -- the Optimistically Vague
Unquantifiable Mantra. When we have a new Chancellor, we'll have a new
OVUM.''
But, I asked, didn't ovum mean egg? ''Exactly,'' she said. ''Until you
crack it, you don't know whether it stinks or not.'' Angelica is wasted.
She should be occupying the Chair of Cynicism at Strathclyde University.
* ''If you're going to dump, don't dump a financial journalist if
you're Deputy Governor of the Bank of England. That's dumb.'' (Aphorism
of the Week from Ms Mary Ellen Synon.)
Some of us at Nerd House have been thinking deeply about this new
wisdom. It has a certain sharp focus. It speaks of our times, our
experience in the Sleazy Nineties . . . It's a helluva lot better than
the catch-all ''Hell hath no fury . . .''etc.
Obviously, all those antediluvian aphorisms and superannuated sayings
are long overdue for an update. This thought caused a flurry of e-mail
around the office as we used crucial office time to compose some new and
more relevant maxims, reflecting the way we are now. Here are some of
the worse ones:
''A stitch in time is far too much trouble. Better to throw away the
shirt.''
''Look after the pennies and the bank will charge you a surprising
amount for looking after the pounds, and only tell you afterwards.''
''Absence from the office is the mother of invention.''
''Honesty is the best policy if you really want a hundred journalists
camping outside your door for three days.''
''Silence might be golden, but nobody ever made a living out of it, or
even got their own back.''
''Love makes the world go round the tabloid newspaper offices until,
wow, up comes the offer it can't refuse.''
I looked over this collection on my screen with a curling lip. Then I
keystroked ''exit''. Maybe they'll be out of date next week. Maybe the
world will be different.

THERE is little chance of readers not spotting Eileen West's short
stories for she prints them on the back and front of T-shirts.
Appropriately enough her company, which Eileen (pictured left) formed
eighteen months ago, is called TopStory.
She decided to go up front with her stories after reading a report
about how little the younger generation read.
''I was appalled by the statistics, and decided to do something to
encourage youngsters to read, and as many of them wear T-shirts I
decided to encourage them to read by making writing fashionable,'' says
Eileen.
Kincardine and Deeside Enterprise Trust thought her idea was very
innovative, and helped Eileen with a grant.
The T-shirt tales are normally restricted to 650 words which takes up
the front and back of the garments which she admits gives people a
different reason for people asking you to ''turn round'' when they are
admiring your new clothes.
Among the writings to adorn TopStory apparel is Eileen's own
children's story A Tail Tale and James Thurber's story for adults The
Patient Bloodhound.
But, she says mainatains, there is no limit to the type of stories
used which to date have included horror material popular among
teenagers.
Eileen, however, admits that she is not much use at science fiction or
fantasy writing and would be grateful if anyone could supply her with
suitable material.
During the tourist season, Eileen is hopeful that her T-shirts will be
sold in heritage and craft centres, and she is prepared to custom design
her stories to suit a particular area or building.
''I have already been asked by one tourist board to write a story
about their particular area and a craft centre in Airdrie have also
asked me to prepare material on their locality,'' she says.
Molly Brown, a well know short story author from New York has also
told Eileen that TopStorey can use her material on T-shirts as long as
Eileen sends her a couple of T-shirts.
''I was really delighted with this response,'' says Eileen, ''as
obviously you have to be very careful about copyright''.

IF ever there was a duo that knows the score, it's Marco Romano and
Alison Barton, partners in marriage and partners in Performance Plus.
For their new venture, an original composition in the music business
in Scotland, offers, for the first time, a one-stop-shop for musical
performance.
''Both of us have nearly 20 years each of making a living as
professional musicians,'' explains Marco, a conductor to trade.
''Alison is a singer, and, together, we've worked with orchestras
great and famous, as well as the lesser known. That way, we've picked up
all the pitfalls in the trade, and that's what gives us the 'plus' in
the title of the business.''
Performance Plus promises to bring customers, individual, business and
artistic, the best in musical performers. ''We can provide anything from
a single singer to a complete orchestra, complete with conductor, of
course,'' smiles Marco.
And the business is looking at gaps in the market, with an eye,
especially, to providing the full range of musical performance services
to remote areas outwith the central belt of the country.
''We plan to take the best of live, classical music to the highlands,
islands and to Galloway,'' enthuses Alison. ''But we're not an agency
for freelance musicians. We also perform ourselves and we are able to
advise customers on the musical technicalities of what they want. Our
job is to get our clients the best possible deal. That's why we're in
business.''
At 36 and 33 respectively, Marco and Alison decided that the time had
come to face the music.
''We met at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama,'' said
Marco. ''Now we're at the age when many Scottish musicians go south for
security and to take the next step in their career. Neither of us want
to do that, and, with a five-year-old daughter, we've decided to stick
to the quality of life that Glasgow offers, while we make music.''
Music is in Marco's blood, for his father, Giulio, was the Royal
Scottish National Orchestra's longest-serving celloist. ''But,'' he
readily admits, ''I did have to get down to reading a different sort of
musical score -- the rules of running a business.''
Marco spent six months with IMS Trust, learning about marketing, cash
flow and the complexities of taking a new stage, where economic reality,
rather than the conductor's baton, rules.
''I was very impressed by the concept form the start,'' comments John
Glen, IMS Trust business adviser, who took Marco and Alison's score to
the world of work with his own variation on a theme.
Now, with start-up funding from the East End Partnership, Performance
Plus is firmly under conductor's orders. The Dennistoun due are out, in
the best possible marketing taste, of course, to blow their own
trumpets, french horns, bassoons, or anything else the customer
requires, to bring classical music to anyone who wants it.
And their own favourite piece of music? ''Encores from customers,''
says Marco. ''That's what's really music to our ears!''

NFC shares initially lost ground on a disappointing results statement
but perked up afterwards on the appointment of Gerry Murphy, at present
chief executive of Greencore, an Irish food group, as chief executive
from June 1.
They ended 4p ahead at 169p even though the group indicated that it
would be several months before it would see an improvement in results
relative to 1994. Profits for the first quarter to January 21 were down
from #29.2m to #20.4 before exceptionals, though the first interim
dividend is pegged at 1.4p.
NFC is facing tough markets and sees major cost-cutting as essential.
A new chairman, Sir Christopher Bland, arrived in January, and a major
review of the activities has begun.
The first quarter saw reorganisation costs of #5m and further
provisions will be required for redundancies, site disposals and
withdrawal from unprofitable contracts. Over the past 18 months the
group has set aside some #40m for restructuring, of which about half has
been used.
On the transport side, UK operating profits were down 19% at #13.3m as
margins came under pressure. New business gains were below expectations
but NFC says prospects are looking better. In Europe losses rose to
#1.9m mainly due to problems at German Frigoscandia, which was acquired
last year. New management has been installed.
North American profits were slightly down at #6.8m due to the weak
dollar and lower margins.

FEAR of a hostile reaction from financial markets was the crucial
factor in determining the timing of the February 2 rise in interest
rates, which was implemented immediately after the regular monthly
meeting between the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, and the
Governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George.
Both men detected signs that the growth rate was moderating, but they
doubted if activity would slow sufficiently to prevent a pick-up in
underlying inflation, the minutes of the meeting showed.
There was agreement that interest rates would have to rise in either
February or March. The Governor said that financial markets were
''rather fragile, given the situation in Mexico, political concerns in
some countries in Europe, and the perception that interest rates more or
less everywhere had passed their trough''.
He believed that UK markets would be left vulnerable to an adverse
shift of sentiment if interest rates were not increased sooner rather
than later.
''To delay and then have to move under market pressure would be very
damaging to the whole approach to monetary management being pursued.''
Mr Clarke recognised the risks in the fragile market conditions. Since
the decision was essentially about timing it turned largely on market
tactics.
''If an interest rate rise were delayed market expectations of future
interest rates might be lowered. But against that the previous interest
rate rises had the effect of lowering the interest rate expectations
implicit in the futures markets, and long-term rates had fallen.''
Ironically, since base rates were raised by half-a-point to 6.75% in
response to these arguments, sterling has been in the toils, mainly
because of the battle royal between the weak US dollar and the strong
German mark. In addition, the Government's political problems have
undermined sentiment in the pound.
On the other hand, the outlook on interest rates has improved with
futures markets discounting smaller rises than previously, but this is
part of an international trend.
Since the February 2 meeting activity indicators have been relatively
subdued and inflation data no worse then expected. City pundits
generally reckon interest rate policy is currently on hold, though there
is concern that the decline in sterling's international value could
threaten a fresh bout of inflation.
Inflation figures later today are expected to show an unchanged
headline rate of 3.3% last month, with the underlying rate moderating
from 2.8% in January to 2.7% or 2.6%.
A new measure of inflation, RPIY, which excludes indirect and local
authority taxes as well as mortgage interest payments, is also expected
to retreat from an estimated 1.7% in January to about 1.5%.
The main feature of the February 2 minutes was the attention paid to
market expectations in determining monetary policy. Mr George emphasised
he was not arguing that ''we should always respond to market
sensitivity''.
But City analysts decided that the authorities were keen to stay ahead
of market expectations on future interest rate moves. This led some to
conclude that the next rise could be expected in May.

LORD Weir and Sir Ron Garrick may have to spend a little more time
educating the City about the merits of the core Weir Group businesses
and the #135m acquisition last year of EnviroTech if they want to
prevent further share price slides such as yesterday's 14p reverse to
226p.
That came after it was revealed that full-year pre-tax profits had
fallen 19% to #30.5m following some #7.8m of costs. These arose from the
reshaping of the group after the US takeover and reducing the activities
of the pumps business in Manchester because of depressed demand for
spares.
After allowing for these costs, the underlying business saw a profits
slip just 4%, while the dividend total has been raised 7% to 6.96p,
maintaining the unbroken growth pattern stretching back a dozen years
and putting the shares on a 3.8% yield.
Turnover from the continuing businesses slipped #9m to #440m with
another #35m attributable to EnviroTech.
In January, Weir issued a trading statement which knocked 42p off the
stock to 251p partly because it felt that some analysts' forecasts were
far too high. The reaction was exacerbated because in October, Weir had
launched a #96m rights issue at 252p.
The belief now is that the company is running a much stronger
business.
There is plenty of good news for the future. Although margins on
engineering products, basically pump manufacture, declined last year
from 7.5% to 6.8% and were as low as 6.6% in the second half, the
indications are that there is now stabilisation. The return on
engineering services improved from 8.6% to 9.1%, while that at
EnviroTech amounted to 9.2% in the first three months under Weir
ownership.
So as the benefits of the merger and the extension of the product
range into pumps capable of handling highly-abrasive liquids and
slurries such as those in the mining industry, where demand is currently
strong, filter through, there is potential for a substantial improvement
in group margins.
There was a highly-successful week-long sales seminar in February at
the headquarters in Cathcart, Glasgow, which has resulted in several
major management initiatives.
Rationalisation will reduce costs by #2m this year and #5m next. But
behind all this is the increasing order book in the fourth quarter. It
jumped from #91m to #133m in the core business including a #16m order
from Italian contractors for a Lebanese power station for pump equipment
to be delivered around the end of this year. The Italians were unable to
find full project finance off their own bat but Weir helped out with the
assistance of the ECGD which guaranteed #50m.
That order backlog seems set to continue as global economies begin to
recover although overall power station work is very low margin, with
main contractors apparently sometimes bidding at no better than cost.
Dollar devaluation has been something of a problem as a fair
proportion of the turnover is in that currency, rising with EnviroTech
which accumulated #32m of orders in the December quarter.
Weir in 1995 should have turnover well in excess of #600m but Sir Ron
indicated that it will be second six months before the initial benefits
of the integration of EnviroTech come through, with 1996 seeing their
full effects.
John Dean at broker Albert E Sharp is looking for profits of #46m this
year and reckons the shares are a buy on a medium-term basis for the
patient investor. They are selling at about 14 times likely earnings but
should show above average growth next year and beyond.

THE biotechnology industry is estimated to have been worth #3800m last
year. However, it is developing rapidly and by the year 2000 could be
worth #60bn. The Department of Trade and Industry and particularly its
president, Michael Heseltine, is keen that British companies take
advantage of the potential of biotechnology, in a similar fashion to
information technology, to enhance their competitiveness.
''We are very concerned to ensure that British industry wakes up to
the importance of biotechnology,'' he said. Mr Heseltine firmly believes
that ''industry is on the threshold of a major bio-revolution''.
To this end the DTI has launched the Biotechnology Means Business
(BMB) initiative, aimed at raising awareness of biotechnology across
industry. A sum of #10m has been set aside to cover the four-year
programme. Its strong science and academic research base provides the UK
with an advantage over many of its European partners. There are already
160 biotechnology companies in the UK covering a broad spread of
activities.
Many people including those running businesses both large and small
currently have little idea how valuable biotechnology can be in
manufacturing and service industries. It is not just useful in
biomedical and pharmaceutical fields but across a wide sprectrum of
activities.
Research carried out by PA Consulting on behalf of the DTI has
identified 10 key industries where current awareness of biotechnology
applications is low but where its potential benefits may be high. Around
74,000 companies are thought to meet these criteria. They are in:
pharmaceuticals and diagnostics, agriculture and agrochemicals,
industrial and scientific equipment, chemicals and allied products, food
and drink, paper and pulp, textiles, leather and allied products,
petroleum refining and allied industries and, finally, water and waste
treatment.
The DTI has highlighted several of the benefits of using
biotechnology. These include increased profitability and efficiency,
simplified compliance with legislation, reduced environmental impact,
better quality assurance and improved consumer safety. It can also
facilitate the introduction of new products. For example, almost all
washing powders sold today are enzyme-based, genetic fingerprinting is
used to help solve crimes, and biotechnology has been used to produce
disease-resistant crops and new kinds of foodstuffs such as tomatoes
which make better sauce.
Those seeking information on how biotechnology may help their own
particular business can ring a free helpline backed by a technical
support service on 0800 432100 for general information. More detailed
information is available in a series of fact sheets. Seminars and
workshops are to be held at venues around the country during the course
of the year. Details of the Scottish ones have yet to be finalised.

SIR Lawrie Barratt launched into the Government's three increases in
interest rates as being one reason for his not expecting an improvement
in the number of houses to be built in 1995, writes ANDREW WILSON.
He said that its support had been disappointing compared with that
during the Thatcher period when 5[1/2] million people became
home-owners.
In the past three years, Government support had not been there and it
had breached the 1992 Conservative Manifesto in that mortgage tax relief
had been cut. He added that there had been disastrous action in November
when the Budget reduced the degree of housing income support.
Sir Lawrie was speaking after the Newcastle-based housebuilder had
emerged with half-time results 42% ahead at #16.1m -- bang in line with
the middle of City expectations.
Market men took the knife to the share price, slicing 14p off at 171p,
while Sir Lawrie day bought 100,000 shares at 179p for a family trust.
He added that UK national sales rose 4[1/2]% to 143,000 huses in 1994
rather than the 10% expected and that there would be no improvement in
1995.
Average prices rose from #74,600 to #77,900, reflecting the greater
concentration now on the south-east of England. Barratt has 33 sites
within the M25 orbit where prices are around 50% higher than the UK
average for the equivalent quality of property.
UK house margins improved from 8.9% to 9.6% -- well below the UK
average as Barratt is still working through uneconomic land bought at
the peak of the boom. It is perhaps a little worrying that Barratt
having spent #80m on land in the first half and plans to spend another
#100m in the current six months.
Full-year profits could rise from #35.2m to about #48m to leave the
shares trading at 9[1/2] times likely earnings. The interim dividend has
been raised 0.5p to 2.5p, pointing to a full-year payout of 7.5p for a
5.5% yield.

UNION International, controlled by the Vestey family and owners of
butchers' shop chain J H Dewhurst, yesterday called in administrative
receivers.
Receivers have also been appointed to Dewhurst which takes in the
Munro chain in Scotland, including 11 branches in Glasgow and seven in
Edinburgh.
However, it is the intention that all the shops continue to trade
until a buyer has been found, either for the whole lot or in parts.
Union said Alan Bloom, Gareth Hughes and Jason Elles of Ernst &amp; Young
have been appointed joint administrative receivers to Union.
The company said its bankers had on Tuesday required it to put
Dewhurst into receivership as a condition for continued lending.
Union's board met yesterday and decided that it could not continue
trading if Dewhurst was put into receivership and therefore applied for
the whole company to go into receivership.
The company nearly went into receivership in 1991 with debts of #430m
but was successfully restructured by former Lonrho director Terry
Robinson.
Union is controlled by the Vestey family whose fortune once topped
#1400m, but their financial position has taken a turn for the worse in
recent years.
The Vesteys ranked 17th -- at about #600m -- in The Sunday Times's
latest league table of Britain's richest people.

GORDON Strachan walked out on Leeds yesterday to join Coventry as
their manager-elect.
In a unique deal, the Scot has been given a three-year contract which
includes a clause that he will be offered the team manager's job in two
years' time, in succession to Ron Atkinson.
Strachan, who had been offered a similar deal at Leeds, opted to turn
his back on Elland Road after six years to serve his managerial
apprenticeship under one of the game's top managers.
Atkinson, who referred to a possible link-up with the player when was
appointed Coventry manager four weeks ago, believes his decision to put
the proposal into a contract persuaded Strachan to leave Leeds.
Atkinson said: ''It makes sense for Gordon to learn the ropes for a
couple of years without having any of the pressures. He can learn all
about the administrative side, transfers and so on from me as we go
along from day to day, so that he can then make the step up.''
But Atkinson sidestepped questions on his own future at that time. It
has been suggested that he might join Coventry's board as director of
football, but he said: ''Who knows what might happen in two years'
time?''
Strachan, 38, has retained his playing registration, but said: ''I
don't expect to play first team football, unless we get a lot of
injuries. I am more interested in the coaching side at the moment, but I
would like to play in the reserves.''
Atkinson signed Strachan for Manchester United in 1984 and the
Scotland international won an FA Cup winners' medal the following year
but, after Atkinson's departure, found himself out of favour under his
old Aberdeen manager, Alex Ferguson, and moved to Leeds in March, 1989.
Strachan, who won 50 caps, skippered Leeds to the second division
championship in his first full year and to the League title two years
later.

Pointing the way: Davie Cooper seen in action at an earlier television
coaching session, and the former Scotland winger still has much to offer
the sport.
SCOTTISH football was willing Davie Cooper to win his fight for life
last night after the former World Cup star had been rushed to the
Southern General Hospital after having suffered a brain haemorrhage.
The 39-year-old Clydebank player, who won 22 caps for Scotland, has
long been recognised as perhaps the last of the great Scottish wingers,
a throw-back to the glory days of the game. That was why he was involved
in a coaching video which was being filmed at Broadwood Stadium
yesterday when he collapsed.
Initially those working with him -- and the 14 schoolboys who were
taking part -- thought Cooper was joking when he slumped to the ground.
One of them shouted -- ''OK, Davie, the joke's over.''
Then Celtic's Charlie Nicholas, who was appearing with Cooper,
suddenly realised the seriousness of the situation.
''Davie had just asked me if I fancied going for a pint when we were
finished,'' said Nicholas, ''and I said that sounded like a good idea. I
turned away and then when I looked back he was on the ground.
''I think all of us thought he was kidding around, but then I saw some
blood coming from his mouth and I knew it was bad. The programme
director gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation until an ambulance
arrived. His pulse had actually stopped.
''Everyone is shattered and all we can do is hope that Coop pulls
through. That's what we all want. Everyone wants the same thing.''
That was the message from the sport last night as people remembered
Cooper's golden days at Ibrox -- and his marvellous performances at
Motherwell in the autumn of his career.
The chairman of the Fir Park club, John Chapman, recalled: ''On the
way to Easter Road for the game we heard on the radio that a Clydebank
player had been taken ill, and a minute or two later Dougie Arnott said
it was Davie Cooper.
''We were all very shocked, still are. Indeed, all of Motherwell will
be shocked. Davie was very fit, he trained hard, and his worth to us was
incalculable. When he joined us in l989, at the start of our Scottish
Cup winning season, the enthusiasm he generated was tremendous.''
And after the match in Edinburgh, Motherwell manager Alex McLeish, who
played in Scotland sides with Cooper, was too upset to talk to
reporters, leaving the ground close to tears, while Alex Miller, the
Hibs manager who played in the same Ibrox side with Cooper, said:
''Football pales into insignificance at times like this. Here we have a
man so young in a situation like this. It is tragic.''
At Ibrox, where Cooper spent 12 seasons, manager Walter Smith said
that everyone at the club wished him a speedy recovery, and captain
Richard Gough, who often shared a room with the winger when the team was
travelling, added his own personal memories.
''It's hard to believe that this has happened to Coop,'' said Gough.
''I was quite close to him when we were at Ibrox. He is not the easiest
guy to get to know, because he has always been a bit of a loner, but I
like to think I have been one of his mates.
''I played against him when I was with Dundee United and learned then
just how good a player he was. He was magnificent and I always felt a
sorrow that Graeme Souness had not arrived at Ibrox a few seasons
earlier and given Coop even better days.
''Let's face it, there were times in the early eighties when he
carried that Rangers team on his own. We all hope he pulls through
this.''
Former Celtic captain and manager, Billy McNeill, added: ''At his peak
Davie Cooper had an abundance of skill. It is to his eternal credit that
he always went out to display his undoubted talent. And it is an
indictment of our game that he did not win more honours during his
career.
''Like everyone else I hope he comes through this because he still has
so much to offer the game, either in coaching or in his role on
television, where he always talks sense.''
Cooper was discovered playing juvenile football for Hamilton Avondale
in 1974, and Clydebank's Jack Steedman persuaded him to join the
Kilbowie Park club. Three years later he was sold to Rangers for
#100,000. Today Cooper's wing wizardry would command a fee in millions.
Last night, Steedman, obviously distressed, said: ''Our thoughts are
with Davie and his family. We are concerned about his mum and dad at
this time and we know what they must be going through.
''All we want is for Davie to make a full recovery. He has a future
here at the club. He has always been the blue-eyed boy here and he
remains that . . .''
Before his club's vital Premiership clash with Arsenal, Manchester
United manager Alex Ferguson, who took Cooper to Mexico for the World
Cup finals there in 1986, told me: ''It is hard to grasp what has
happened to Davie. He played for Scotland when I was with the national
squad and all we can hope is that he comes through this ordeal.
''I have always kept in touch with him and when he was at his best I
was one of his greatest admirers. Just a marvellous, marvellous
player.''
His old Ibrox colleague, Derek Johnstone, echoed that -- ''I never
played with a greater player than Davie Cooper at any time in my
career,'' he insisted.
''The strength and determination he showed as a player are vital to
him in this fight.''

THE continued downward trend in red meat consumption impacted Bernard
Matthews, the turkey and red meat producer last year.
However, it is attempting to boost its sales through the introduction
of new cooked meat ranges and lamb products from its subsidiary Advanced
Foods in New Zealand.
This together with its growing business on the Continent enabled it to
report higher-than-expected annual results in 1994. In the 52 weeks to
January 1, 1995, profit before tax rose to a record #18.6m, an increase
of 65% on the previous year. Overall, group sales were up 45% to
#145.5m. There is a final dividend of 1.82p making a total for the year
of 3.14p, an increase of over 25% on 1993's payout.
Sales in its UK turkey businesss rose more than 10% on the back of
strong demand for branded range products and further development of the
fresh turkey range. Although heavy price discounting by retailers of
oven ready turkeys before Christmas boosted consumption it menat that
Bernard Matthews could not increase its prices.
Demand for its range of cooked meats continued to expand. In addition,
new ranges of added value fresh and frozen products are to introduced in
the near future.
Its Hungarian subsidiary continued to make a significant contribution
to the group's profits. In France and Germany, increasing sales of
existing products and the introduction of new products helepd to improve
the trading position.
The group has a strong balance sheet and despite two acquisitions in
the year at a total cost of #13.7m, net geaing at the year-end was below
20%. This helathy financial position will enable the group to make
further acquisitions should a suitable opportunity arise.

SOME of us were assembling in Edinburgh to watch a football match
yesterday when tragedy struck Davie Cooper, and as we waited, mostly in
silence, for news of his condition, there was a powerful reluctance to
pay much attention to what the players of Hibernian and Motherwell were
up to on the Easter Road pitch.
There seemed little point in watching football when one of the people
who helped make it the beautiful game was engaged in the greatest
challenge of his life in the neurological unit of a Glasgow hospital.
In the quietness, memories of Cooper were replayed, and if there were
smiles on a few faces, they were not born of any disrespect. It was just
that Cooper in full flight was a joy to behold and perhaps it was
appropriate that the re-arranged premier division match should be
treated as a distant second to the memory of a player who belonged to
another era.
Although Cooper, who was 39 last month, was still turning out in the
first division for Clydebank, his first senior club, he was from
yesterday. He was a genuine Scottish winger and that made him a rarity.
When emotions are spilling over it is tempting to reach into the
realms of hyperbole, but it is almost impossible to exaggerate Cooper's
exploits on the wings for Rangers, Motherwell, and Scotland. He was in
possession of wondrous gifts which defied belief.
A few years ago a sports commentator asked Ruud Gullit, who was at the
height of his own remarkable powers and playing in Italy, if he had ever
been impressed by any Scottish footballers and, instead of offering up
the name of Kenny Dalglish or Graeme Souness, the Dutchman said simply:
''Davie Cooper.'' Gullit had seen him play for Rangers and was astounded
by his natural ability.
Uncomfortable in the heat of the spotlight Cooper was a bashful hero
who never enjoyed adulation, and throughout his career the feeling that
he had not made the most of his abilities persisted. It gnawed
constantly and one can only wonder what he might have achieved had he
been able to do more than than stand on his right leg.
Still, with one educated leg he gave us many moments to cherish and,
ironically, one of his most significant contributions will forever be
submerged in a profound sadness. His penalty against Wales in Cardiff in
1985 took Scotland into the Mexico World Cup finals, but while the fans
were celebrating the manager, Jock Stein, was dying of heart failure.
That goal was one of six Cooper scored in 22 appearances for Scotland,
a paltry total for someone so talented. Caps should have been spilling
from every drawer but errors of judgment by managers -- Ally MacLeod
admitted after the ill-fated event that he should have taken Cooper to
the World Cup finals in Argentina -- injury, which prevented him from
taking part in Italia '90, and his own often brooding reluctance to
perform denied him.
He played in Mexico in '86, but his best was restricted mainly to
domestic arenas and one of his finest moments was a goal scored against
Celtic in the Drybrough Cup final in 1979. He kept the ball up and
flicked it over several defenders with an arrogant nonchalance before
scoring a goal which is one of the first retrieved from the archives
whenever television presents programmes on football's greatest moments.
He took Dundee United apart in the Scottish Cup final replay of
1980-81 which Rangers won 4-1 and scored the winning goal against Celtic
in the 1986-87 league cup final which presented Souness with his first
trophy as Rangers' manager. The Hamilton-born winger made 377 league
appearances for Rangers and scored 49 times before moving to Motherwell
for #50,000 five years ago.
He won his fourth Scottish Cup winners' medal with the Fir Park side a
year later with the three other triumphs occurring in 1978, '79, and
'81. Cooper also owns three league championship badges (1978, '87, '89)
and seven League Cup winners' medals ('78, '79, '82, '84, '85, '87,
'88).
We can only hope he survives, but I fear Scottish football will never
see his equal. He was the last in a distinguished line of Scottish
wingers: Morton, Jackson, Delaney, Liddle, Smith, Ormond, Waddell,
Henderson, Johnstone, and Johnston. They are the stuff of legend.
Davie Cooper was the last of the greats. May he recover and enjoy the
memories with us.

Albion Rovers 1, Montrose 4
MONTROSE went ahead in seven minutes when Colin McGlashan headed home.
Mark Haro was on the mark after 23 minutes when he bulleted a 35-yard
free-kick past Alan Davidson.
Rovers pulled a goal back through Alex McEwan with 16 minutes
remaining but three minutes later Shaun Smith extended Montrose's lead
and just before full time the same player completed the scoring.

COLIN Jackson's old Nemesis, double Olympic champion Roger Kingdom,
sounded a warning to his former arch rival yesterday with victory in the
110 metres hurdles at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata.
Kingdom, who for years stood between Welshman Jackson and the sport's
highest honours, warned after his success in Argentina that he was ready
to challenge Jackson for his World crown in Gothenburg this summer.
Yet yesterday's win took more than three hours. That was how long it
took for a disqualification to be overturned and the appeals procedure
to restore Kingdom to his Pan-Am throne.
Kingdom, who first won the Pan American title in 1983, clocked 13.39,
one hundredth ahead of Cuban Emilio Valle. A judge ruled he had
deliberately knocked over the ninth hurdle, but a six-man jury of appeal
reinstated Kingdom.
The only athlete to have won titles at the Games 12 years apart, and a
long-time arthritis sufferer, Kingdom was motivated to attempt a
comeback after European promoters refused to find him a lane last year,
even though he was prepared to run for nothing.
Also behind Kingdom yesterday was Courtney Hawkins, one of the two
Americans to beat Britain's Tony Jarrett at the World Indoor
championships in Barcelona earlier this month.
''This is the first stage of a comeback,'' said the 32-year-old
Kingdom. ''If I can make the World championships . . . you know I am not
going over there without trying to win. That's the only title I do not
have on my shelf.''

THE German mark reasserted its authority on the foreign exchanges and
left the pound and dollar floundering.
Sterling about lost 1[1/4] pfennigs to DM2.2295 but it rose almost a
fifth-of-a-cent against the weak dollar to $1.5863. This enabled
sterling's trade-weighted index managed to rise to 85.1, a gain of 0.3
on its overnight level.
However, City dealers suggest that underlying political worries and
the fragility of the UK economy need to be cured before sterling regains
confidence for any sustained length of time.
Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke said sterling's weakness
had nothing to do with economic fundamentals and said the recovery was
healthy. UK inflation data published today is expected to show an annual
inflation rate of 3.4%, up 0.1 on the previous month.
Mr Clarke refused to rule out intervention to prop up currencies. He
said there was a case for it when it went with the grain and reflected
economic reality. ''I do not rule it out in all circumstances,'' he
said.

HEARTS defender Craig Levein is doubtful for Scotland's European
Championship qualifier against Russia in Moscow next week.
Levein suffered an ankle injury in the 1-1 draw with Dundee United on
Tuesday and, although he played the full 90 minutes, there are fears
there could be ligament damage. ''It's touch and go,'' admitted Hearts
manager Tommy McLean.
Defender Steve Frail will see a specialist after being stretchered off
at Tannadice with a knee injury. The extent of his injury is not yet
known, but the signs are that the cruciate ligament has not been damaged
and McLean has not given up hope of him being fit to face Airdrie in the
Scottish Cup semi-final next month.
''It will be 48 hours before we know,'' continued McLean. ''We have to
wait until the swelling and the bruising have died down.''
John Robertson, who was stretchered off with a knee injury against
Rangers on Saturday, is improving.

DUNDEE turned down a renewed bid from Luton Town manager David Pleat
yesterday for their Under-21 Scotland player Neil McCann -- and with the
English transfer deadline set for today a move south by the winger does
not look likely now.
But, as interest mounts, Celtic are back in the hunt. I understand
that Dens Park manager Jim Duffy and Celtic's Tommy Burns had transfer
talks about McCann yesterday.
The 21-year-old was high on Burns' shopping list when he arived at
Parkhead in the summer. The emergence of Brian McLaughlin -- coupled
with the price placed on McCann by Dundee -- saw Burns' interest wane.
Now, though, I understand that the Tayside club, which would welcome a
boost to their bank account, have come well below the #750,000 they were
looking for earlier in the season.
Luton's offer was in the form of a package -- a cash sum up front,
with additions made when McCann played a certain number of games in
England or won a full Scotland cap. There was also a clause allowing
Dundee further money if the player was transferred by the English side.
A similar deal has been suggested to Celtic and that is being
considered. I believe, though, that a straightforward fee of #500,000
would land the player. The transfer deadline in Scotland is one week
later than it is south of the Border.
McCann joined Dundee from Port Glasgow Boys' Club just short of three
years ago. Until now Duffy has insisted the player is not for sale, but
with the Tayside team struggling for money he is the one asset who could
stabilise their finances as they aim for a place in the premier division
and the massive financial boost that would provide.

Hibernian 2, Motherwell 0
WITH the stadium announcer offering regular bulletins on the condition
of former Motherwell player Davie Cooper, the match was never likely to
grab and hold the full attention of the Easter Road crowd of 5402, which
was not at all an embarrassing number given the ridiculous 3.30pm
kick-off time.
The clubs had to perform at such a strange midweek time because
reconstruction work has cut off supply to the floodlights but,
defensively, Motherwell were always in the dark.
Hibernian, or to be more accurate, Keith Wright, took full advantage
of the Fir Park side's dithering and scored both goals.
The striker wasted little time in declaring his intentions by putting
his side in front after only nine minutes and his second arrived nine
minutes after the interval.
Motherwell then tried to do something positive about their plight, but
found Hibs cruising comfortably back into third place in the premier
division.
Alex Miller's side are now two points behind second-placed Motherwell,
who were beaten in a league match for the first time since January when
they lost 6-1 to Dundee United.
''I think the goals will do a lot for Keith's confidence,'' said
Miller, who, like many people at the game, was more anxious of further
news of Cooper.
''Someone so young, too,'' he said more to himself than anyone else.
''Football pales into insignificance at times like this.''
Motherwell's assistant manager Andy Watson had to take the post-match
press conference because manager Alex McLeish, who played many times at
international level with Cooper, was too upset to talk.
The game plan for Motherwell was to keep things tight at the back and
play the ball forward out of defence, but the strategy had to be
reconsidered when Wright was perfectly placed to flick Kevin Harper's
delivery into the net using his left heel. The second goal, scored after
Harper and Darren Jackson had combined to set up Wright with an easy
tap-in, was confirmation of the Edinburgh side's superiority.
Hibs' new signing, Andy Millen, made his debut playing in midfield but
was taken off near the end when it was clear fatigue was setting in.
Mark McGraw was allowed to stretch his legs and Miller later said: ''I
thought Andy had a decent debut especially since he hadn't played in a
premier division match for something like nine months.''
Millen, who arrived at Easter Road after Hibs had agreed to pay
Kilmarnock a sum of money as well hand over Billy Findlay -- it is
understood the package was worth #300,000 -- had been out of favour at
Rugby Park since he had made it clear he wanted to leave around the time
Celtic were showing an interest. He has been given his move and looked
determined to make up for lost time.
Motherwell hope to complete the signing of Mitchel van der Gaag from
PSV Eindhoven this morning and he will make his debut against Celtic
next week. ''There is just some paperwork to be completed,'' said
Watson, who must hope the Dutchman can shore up the defence which was
extremely shaky.
Motherwell could not possibly hope to secure a European place let
alone do anything on foreign fields with so many defenders looking as
though they had little idea of their functions.
Even the normally reliable Brian Martin was beaten regularly and, had
Hibs' finishing been more accurate, the Edinburgh side would have won by
a wider margin.
Two players, Hibs' Joe Tortolano and Stephen McMillan, of Motherwell,
were booked, but in the main the game was a low-key affair. The thoughts
of too many people, on and off the pitch, may have been elsewhere.
HIBERNIAN -- Leighton, Miller, Millen, McGinlay, Tweed, Hunter,
Harper, Tortolano, Wright, Jackson, O'Neill. Substitutes -- Weir,
McGraw, Reid.
MOTHERWELL -- Woods, May, McMillan, Krivokapic, Martin, Philliben,
Lambert, Dolan, Burns, Arnott, Davies. Substitutes -- Coyne, Shannon,
Howie.
Referee -- J O'Hare (Glenboig).

Ian McConnell reports on the Edinburgh-based merchant bank which is
showing no lack of bottle at Flanders, and making its presence felt in
the City.
EDINBURGH merchant bank Noble &amp; Company is keeping Scotland's historic
links with Flanders alive with major exports of corporate finance
expertise.
Although perhaps still saddled at home with the image of a financial
player almost exclusively involved in start-up deals, Noble has a much
higher profile south of the Border, on the Continent, and in the US.
In spite of doing a relatively small part of its business on its home
patch, however, Noble was crucial to the development of Waverley Mining
Finance, part of the Mining (Scotland) consortium which recently took
over the Scottish coalfields.
It is also a major player in the revitalisation of the ancient Lloyds
of London insurance market, offering people the chance to invest without
taking the horrendous risks which proved the undoing of the Names.
The unique Scottish touch which Noble has used in painstakingly
putting the commercial cogs in place for a #60m plastics factory in
Flanders has greatly impressed the business community there. So much so
that the Edinburgh merchant bank may be called upon by the government,
one of three federal ones in Belgium, to advise on privatisation issues.
PET, the much-in-demand preferred plastic for soft drinks bottles,
will be produced in the factory, which was the brainchild of two former
BP employees from the London area.
Initially somewhat bamboozled by the concept, which involves a
witches' brew of chemicals, Noble was impressed when it examined the
supply and demand conditions.
By a stroke of good fortune, Flanders, an ideal location for the
plant, was somewhere Noble could enlist the assistance of
well-established contacts.
For more than a year, Noble has been agonising over where exactly to
site the factory, the choice of several technologies.
What 51-year-old chief executive Tim Noble describes as an
''incredibly complex'' process has also involved attracting two trade
buyers as customers and investors, to reduce risk, and lining up finance
from banks and other investors.
However, the main pieces of the jigsaw are now in place and the
commercial, rather than purely financial, approach of Noble has gone
down well with the Flemish.
The Edinburgh merchant bank has received referrals from other
companies in Flanders and another Flemish firm. Word of mouth has also
put Noble in the frame for work in one or two upcoming privatisations.
Scotland's bonds with Flanders, famous for its poppies, are forged in
the blood of the Scottish soldiers who died in during the trench warfare
of the First World War. However, Mr Noble, a vehement nationalist with a
small ''n'', believes there is still a strong affinity between the
communities.
He said: ''The people there like the concept of Flanders and Scotland.
There have been a lot of historic links and there is also a feeling that
we have two communities that are the same size. Scotland has this
expertise in finance that Flanders doesn't have and Flanders has this
thriving industrial sector.''
In an industry in which the big London players tend to attract all the
media attention -- whether it be yet another wave of takeover rumours
surrounding SG Warburg or the stranger-than-fiction goings-on at Barings
-- Mr Noble delights in being the Scottish underdog.
He admits to having gleaned not a small amount of satisfaction when
his City peers were made to sit up and take notice at a recent dinner in
London.
Mr Noble explained: ''I mentioned my name to a group of people I had
never met before and those from London looked blank. However, the guy
who came from Belgium said, 'Oh, you must be from Noble &amp; Company. I
have heard a lot about them.' I felt very pleased about that.''
Those behind Noble have always fought hard for Scotland. Sir Iain
Noble, who founded the merchant bank with Tim and John Noble in 1980,
was at the forefront of the campaign to prevent The Royal Bank of
Scotland being swallowed up by Standard Chartered in the early-eighties.
Indeed, the merchant bank, which initially focused on the oil sector,
had its roots in the family's wish to redress the ''tragic'' lack of
Scottish companies reaping the benefits of the North Sea oil boom.
Noble has also been a key player in the re-birth of Scotland's coal
industry.
The merchant bank helped William McLucas fund Waverley Mining Finance,
which was floated on the stock market back in 1988 and more recently
took a 22% stake in Mining (Scotland).
As part of the consortium selected by the Government late last year as
the preferred bidder for the Scottish coalfields, Waverley had to put up
#6.3m.
With a very tight timetable having been set by the Government for the
sale of Scottish Coal by the end of the year, a #15m placing of shares,
underwritten by Noble and London stockbroker Williams de Broe, had to be
arranged swiftly.
Director Ben Thomson, 31, believes Noble has sponsored more vehicles
for Lloyds of London insurance market investors than any other merchant
bank.
It has set up four corporate capital vehicles, including Wellington
Underwriting and Premium Underwriting, which allow investors to
participate in a particular, or a range of, syndicates on a limited
liability basis.
After the devastation suffered by some Names, whose losses were as
deep as Pandora's Box, the vehicles set up by Noble allow investors to
switch from unlimited to limited liability.
Mr Thomson said: ''What we have been trying to do is bring in new
investors to help capitalise Lloyds for the future and get the format of
it right.
''Considering virtually all of the major banks have had a go, it is
certainly a surprise that a Scottish institution should be one of the
leading corporate finance houses of Lloyds of London.''
Another facet of the company is Noble Securities, which undertakes
portfolio management for individuals, charities and trusts.
Returning to corporate finance, Noble &amp; Company was, 18 months ago,
behind the first flotation of a general insurance company since the war.
Independent Insurance, formerly the UK subsidiary of US insurance
giant Allstate, was the subject of a management buy-in brokered by Noble
at the end of 1986.
Back then, Noble raised #15m, with Independent ultimately floated with
a market capitalisation of about #100m.
' It is certainly a surprise that a Scottish institution should be one
of the leading corporate finance houses of Lloyds of London '

NOT allowing staff to sit down during meetings may not sound like a
recipe for success, but this week's Trailblazer demonstrates how
successful this, as part of ''people empowerment'', can be.
In an effort to turn the levels of business around, health insurance
company Cigna took the dramatic step of ripping out its management
structure to create multi-disciplinary teams based around customers'
needs rather than functions.
Operations director Ian Ferguson was instrumental in the development
and implementation of this re-engineering process.
''Change didn't take place overnight. A lot of work was done trying
first to convince management of the benefits of this change, and then
the staff themselves had to be committed to make it work.''
In a move that took almost three years to complete, Cigna relocated
its headquarters to Greenock, introduced the team structure and has
succeeded in going from a loss situation to a #1m profit.
The company specialises in providing corporate employee benefits,
including health care, life insurance, private dental insurance, and
individual health policies.
Multi-disciplinary teams offer a range of services built for each
customer ensuring efficient and accessible delivery of health care to
their employees. A team of experienced nurses are on call to listen and
answer queries, discuss treatments, and offer guidance to patients and
their families.
Customers such as Motorola Ltd, Stakis, and housebuilder Cala plc have
adopted this approach. However, as Ian Ferguson explains, the teams did
not always work so well. ''To begin with a pilot team was set up,
pulling together a cross-section of staff from the original departments.
''Basically we were asking them to live in one another's pockets and
learn to work together. Departments were brought into contact with one
another, which was the first step in opening up the system.''
The eight-strong team had to learn team dynamics -- both in theory and
practice. For example, how to gain consensus decisions and how to
resolve conflict.
The first team, Camp (Claims and Administration Medical Pilot),
survived the testing period and today there are eight teams handling
Cigna's business.
Clients are assigned to teams which are given the task of dealing with
all aspects of the client's business. The client company and all
employees covered by the plan are given a direct telephone number and a
named individual who deals with their case.
This effectively empowers staff, giving them ''ownership'' of clients
and their workload. It also provides every customer with access to
someone who understands the details and background of an inquiry and who
can then make informed, rapid, and reliable decisions -- a one-stop
shop.
Grainne Bain, one of the first staff to join Cigna at Greenock,
believes strongly in the team structure. ''There are no supervisors,
only team members and team facilitators who are mutually supportive and
adaptive to the needs of every customer.'' Each day team members meet to
set work targets and measure themselves against those targets. Every
member of the team will tell their colleagues what targets they are
setting themselves, for example how many claims they expect to process
that day. The next day they will report back what they actually
achieved.
Marie McGhee, team facilitator of Camp, says everyone in the team
knows what each other is doing. ''It's not a case of judging each other
but being aware of how the team is doing as a whole.
''For example, if someone is struggling one day because the phone has
been ringing non-stop, then some of their workload can be shared.''
All the team facilitators meet on a daily basis (this is where they
have chosen to stand in order to keep meetings short and efficient) to
hear how the company is performing and where the teams have contributed.
As a result of Cigna's restructuring, productivity has increased more
than 30%, running costs have fallen and staff retention is high -- about
95%, but it has brought new concerns on career development.

LAST MONTH'S publication of the final draft Statement of Recommended
Practice (Accounting by charities) has marked the beginning of the end
of what has been a nail-biting period of uncertainty for Scottish
charities.
The charities have been waiting patiently for details of new
accounting recommendations that many feared would be far-reaching and
could potentially have a significant impact on the way they operate.
Nothing could be closer to the truth!
That the new regulations are necessary and overdue is probably not in
doubt, particularly from the point of view of ensuring that charity
trustees meet their duties to the public in terms of stewardship and
financial accountability.
In addition, there is undoubtedly merit in bringing forward specific
recommendations concerning the form and content of charities' annual
report and accounts to ensure that readers of these documents can
understand the precise purpose of a charity's activities, its financial
transactions and its financial position.
However, from a practical point of view, for many charities these
recommendations may be a double-edged sword, the impact of which could
inflict serious wounds, especially on those whose procedures and
accounting and administrative systems are in need of modernisation.
In England and Wales, the Charity Commission is the regulatory body
for charities, all of whom operate under specific charity legislation.
In Scotland, though, there is no comparable Charities Act and it is the
Secretary of State who has responsibility for setting out the criteria
for charities' reporting, accounting and auditing.
With the plethora of regulation currently facing charities and
particularly in light of the changes in the financial reporting scene,
my message to Scottish charities is that they should start planning for
these changes now.
In one sense, these recommendations are nothing more than standards of
good practice of the kind that should already be in place in all
organisations, including charities. Charities without the necessary
standards and practices may find it difficult to cope with the new
recommendations, and this could inhibit their on-going development.
Without going into too much detail about the reporting criteria to be
used in, for example, the production of annual report and accounts,
suffice it to say that in the future accounts will become more
standardised under a fairly prescriptive approach to the reporting of
transactions.
This could be a culture shock for many charities. Some will
undoubtedly have to get rid of archaic practices and many more may have
to adopt a more business-like approach to what they do. I am not
advocating that charities should be profitable, but they will have to
manage their resources more effectively.
There is one further specific downside. Volunteers who advise and take
decisions on behalf of charities can be held personally liable if things
go wrong and it is a real concern that many volunteers may not be aware
of these responsibilities.
It is acknowledged that in drafting the revised regulations (known as
SORP 2), care has been taken to provide some specific Scottish input and
some concessions have been granted. That said, the vast majority of the
features of charity accounting introduced by SORP 2 are intended to
apply to all charities, including Scottish charities, regardless of
size, constitution or complexity.
Accordingly, whilst SORP 2 may be ''recommended practice'' and
therefore in theory not mandatory, charities are given clear guidance
that they will be expected to follow its recommendations.
The final version of SORP 2 is likely to be issued during the summer,
as soon as the English and Welsh regulations are finalised, and it is
estimated that full implemetation will be required later this year.
If the burden of additional regulation and responsibility will put
more pressure on charities, as the impact of increasing regulation
becomes more clear to volunteers, it will also put more pressure on
those people who have traditionally given voluntary service to charities
as their contribution to the community.
This added responsibility could turn people away from becoming
involved in charity work in the future.
Charities must therefore look at ways of supporting these people by
having internal procedures and policies in place; this will not only
protect the individuals but will also help protect the charity itself.
Against all of these problems, I am encouraged to see the formation of
joint ventures between the professional and charity sectors which are
aimed at addressing some of the issues.
The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland and the Scottish
Council for Voluntary Organisations, supported by Brodies the
solicitors, have come together to set up the Scottish Charities Annual
Reports Awards, the objective of which is to improve the quality of
financial information produced by Scottish charities in their annual
reports.
In addition, a group known as the Scottish Charity Finance Directors
Group, has recently been formed. This will act as a forum through which
those involved in issues concerning Scottish charities can meet and
discuss problems.
These two developments are undoubtedly a step in the right direction.
It is a time of uncertainty and change for charities and the hope must
be that in tackling these issues, charities can rise to the challenges
they face and create a platform on which they can build for the future.

Co., and the Honorary Treasurer of the Guide Association in Scotland,

AN increasingly hungry world in which stocks of food are steadily
declining needs both the technical skills of progressive farmers and the
expertise of agricultural science, according to one of the doyens of
farming research.
Delivering the annual Sir John Hammond Memorial Lecture in Scarborough
yesterday on the concluding day of the British Society of Animal
Science's winter meeting, Professor Sir Colin Spedding distanced himself
from many current ideas in a thought provoking speech entitled
Sustainability in Animal Production.
Sir Colin first pointed out that the very term sustainability means
different things to different people. ''What worries me is that people
are equating sustainable with good, and it isn't always.''
Neither did he agree that this type of farming was the same as
low-input systems. ''There is no particular value in leaving a resource
totally unused as some would wish with, say, chemicals. There are
problems in the way resources are used and certainly we do not want to
do anything which gives rise to pollution.''
However, it was when he approached the economics of low-input farming
that his message became crystal clear. ''Economic sustainability means
that you want to continue to make a profit -- so why not say so loud and
clear? But how do you design a system for the future unless we know what
the costs and prices will be? And that's one thing we know nothing
about.''
Advising the average British farmer how to plan for the future, Sir
Colin said: ''Each individual farmer has to decide for himself to what
extent sustainability is a relevant concept for him. Clearly he has to
look at the rate at which his resources are used, but that doesn't mean
he cannot use them. It does not follow that using resources at a low
rate will allow you to survive economically.''
Seizing on the international implications of less intensive farming,
he continued: ''The question that everyone wants to know is: could you
feed the world under such regimes? Even then the trouble with that
stragegy is that we are not feeding the world just now. What's more,
feeding the world has got nothing to do with producing food. People are
hungry because they are poor, that's the only reason. No-one who has
money goes hungry. The rich do not starve except after earthquakes or
something like that.
''The question of hunger is one of poverty -- if they had the money
the food would be provided for them.''
Continuing with his theme and developing it towards the ultimate
question of whether the starving millions even with enough money in
their pockets could be fed by the world's farmers adopting low-input
systems, he concluded pensively: ''The judgment at the moment is that in
the long term it would be difficult -- if everyone was to be
satisfactorily fed by using low-input methods.''
Sir Colin received wide acclaim for his speech, and many delegates
later made the point that it was time for the agricultural industry in
the broadest sense to go on the offensive, adding that the individuals
who criticise farmers and intensive methods are all too often the same
ones who plead for more aid for the Third World.

Movie makers are coming to Scotland in increasing numbers, reports
Harry Conroy, thanks to local authority initiatives
JOHN DOWNIE is adamant. Despite all the hype surrounding the recent
production of several films in this country, Scotland does not have a
film industry. But the chairman of Scottish Screen Locations is equally
adamant that we could have one if everyone were to co-operate.
The recent success of Shallow Grave, the film backed by the Glasgow
Film Fund, is an indicator of what is possible even with a limited
amount of resources.
A number of initiatives are currently being undertaken to attract film
makers to Scotland. Scottish Screen Locations is talking to more than 30
feature film companies about using the country as a location, and film
makers from Italy, Japan, the US, and Germany are considering coming
here.
Lee Leckie, commissioner for Scottish Screen Locations, says: ''We are
very likely to get four of these productions, with three starting this
year. A couple of them are large productions but it can take three or
four years of talking before an agreement is reached.''
The economic rewards, not only in terms of employment for those in the
film industry but also for the localities where the filming actually
takes place, are high. Since 1991 an estimated #22m has been spent by
film production companies in Scotland in such basic services as local
shops, hotels, restaurants, and taxis. In the past two years six major
films have come here, including Brave Heart, Rob Roy, Mary Reilly, and
Glace Bay.
The latter is a reminder that we can attract films other than those
with a Scottish story. Glace Bay centres round a Canadian mining
disaster, and the facilities at the Scottish Mining Museum were used as
the setting for the film.
Film producers are attracted to Scotland for a number of reasons,
including our topography and the quality of light. We can also offer
them apparently remote locations within easy travelling distance of
urban towns where they can film without being troubled by aircraft
passing overhead.
Scotland is in competition with Ireland for film productions. Says
John Downie: ''Ireland can offer tax concessions, and throws all sorts
of goodies at the production companies. There is certainly not an even
playing field.''
Local authorities, however, have played an important part in boosting
Scotland's attraction for film companies.
John Downie is himself an executive of Strathclyde Business
Development, the economic arm of the region, which put #20,000 a year
into Scottish Screen Locations as well as the Glasgow Film Fund.
''Local authorities provide many of the facilities that a film company
needs, and the Scottish local authorities are very co-operative,'' he
explains. His own interest in the film industry extends beyond the
economic arena -- his wife Ann stars in Take the High Road.
The increasing interest in expanding the film industry in Scotland
dates back to 1988, when the Scottish Development Agency put together a
report suggesting that there was an economic case for attracting the
industry to Scotland.
In 1990, with the help of Glasgow District Council, Lothian Regional
Council, and Strathclyde Business Development, Scottish Screen Locations
was launched to market Scotland worldwide as a film location. This
initiative received a boost in 1990, when Glasgow was Europe's City of
Culture and hosted the European Film Awards.
Film making has been stimulated by the increasing number of television
channels and the growth of independent television production companies
as stations were encouraged to farm out 25% of their production to
independent producers.
John Downie points simply to the growing thickness of the ''Film
Bang'', the directory of the Scottish fledgling film industry, as an
indication of the expansion that has been taking place. ''The directory
is now three times the size it was four or five years ago,'' he says.
The establishment of the Glasgow Film Fund with money from the Glasgow
Development Agency, Glasgow City Council, and Strathclyde region as well
as the European Regional Development Fund, marked another step forward
for the industry, as has the commercial success of Shallow Grave, the
film the fund invested in along with Channel 4.
Shallow Grave was an immediate financial success, breaking box office
records at four London cinemas as well as at the Cameo in Edinburgh. It
drew #100,512 at eight London screens in one weekend before going on
general release throughout the UK.
The Glasgow Film Fund has now invested #150,000 in the #1m The Near
Room, which is being filmed in Glasgow. Other current productions
include the #1.5m Train Spotting, which is likely to be filmed in
Edinburgh, and the bigger budget #2m Easterhouse, which is likely to
provide work for a crew of 50 and 66 actors.
Early indications are that The Near Room, which involves 12 weeks of
shooting in the Townhead area of Glasgow, will be another commercial
success. A deal has already been struck with film distributor Smart Egg,
which has offices in the US and Australia as well as the UK.
Alan Shiach, chairman of the Scottish Film Production Fund, which
provides money to develop film scripts and ideas, is on record as
saying: ''The success of Shallow Grave and The Near Room proves that
here in Scotland we are no longer making films just for our television
consumption but films of real international standing.''
Lee Leckie is also confident about the future. ''All the strands are
starting to come together,'' she says.
One of the final strands, John Downie believes, is a ''bigger,
Scotland-wide film fund''.

High-flying business ambitions will be catered for from Monday when a
new airline will encourage trade to and from Northern Ireland's second
city, as Alan Gulland reports
SCOTLAND's newest airline is about to bring Derry's businessmen in
from the cold.
From Monday, they will get their first ever daily air link --
specifically geared to meet the needs of the business traveller -- from
Londonderry to mainland UK.
The fledgling airline, Macair, will launch same-day return routes
between Ulster's second largest city and London Stanstead, Edinburgh,
and Birmingham.
It will come as a welcome boost to Northern Ireland's bid to put ''The
Troubles'' behind them and attract much needed new commercial and
industrial investment to the area -- and for Derry Airport which
recently underwent a #12m redevelopment.
Take-off day will also mean a dream come true for Edinburgh based
Macair's young pioneering managing director Captain John Maxton.
It was on a day trip to Derry three years ago that the 37-year-old
former Loganair pilot got the idea for his new airline.
Local businessmen told him of their frustration at having to drive up
to two-and-a-half hours to Belfast Airport to get the flights they
wanted to London and elsewhere in Britain.
''Launching my own airline was something I had often dreamed of.
''I was given a copy of a market research report which showed there
were some very compelling reasons why north-west Ireland should have
direct air links with England and Scotland.
''The more I thought of it , the more attractive it became. It rapidly
became clear that it was not just pie in the sky.
''I drew up a business plan which showed that it had a very good
chance of success.''
From then on it was all systems go. He approached a number of
investment sources -- including banks, travel agents, private investors
and Government funding agencies to raise the #500,000 capital required
for the first year's operations.
He has also put some of his own money into the business and airline
staff, who will total 26. They too are being invited to take a stake in
the enterprise.
''I am fully aware that others before me have tried setting up their
own airlines and have failed after only a short while.
''But they made the mistake of trying to take on the big boys and go
for a share of existing business.
''What makes us different and gives us the confidence that we will
succeed is that we are opening up new territory. We will not be
competing with anyone on the routes we have chosen. In fact we are being
actively encouraged to go for it.''
They are getting practical support from Air UK, who will carry out
Macair's passenger handling services at Edinburgh and Stanstead.
John said: ''They also want to use us as a feeder service for their
network of European routes.''
Initially, Macair are leasing two 18-seat Prestwick-built Jetstream 31
Aircraft for their routes, which will also include daily flights between
Donegal, Edinburgh, and Birmingham.
Over the past few weeks John has had the job of sifting through scores
of applications for the 12 pilot and seven stewardess jobs which are
being created.
''I have 12 years of flying experience but over the last 18 months or
so I have had to turn my hand to all sorts of administrative jobs,'' he
said.
''Although there will be a team of pilots, I have no intention of
being completely deskbound. I will continue flying -- probably up to two
days a week,'' added the father of three, who has an honours degree in
German and a post graduate diploma in European marketing.
But it won't be all business traffic for the new airline.
''We will also be doing charter work and we will be launching a
special service for golfers to give them a day out playing some of
north-west Ireland's top courses.''
The new air link is being welcomed by Derry's businessmen.
Michael Black, president of Derry Chamber of Commerce, said: ''We are
absolutely delighted that we are at long last getting direct links with
London, Edinburgh, and Birmingham. This has been the Chamber's top
priority for at least the last four years.
''I certainly hope it does well because it is a vital piece of
infrastructure in attracting inward investment to north-west Ireland.''
Derry Airport manager Shamus Devine added: ''The business community
here has been crying out for the direct services. At the moment business
people in this area have to rise at 4am to travel two hours to catch the
first services out of Belfast.
''The new services from Derry are a crucial building block in the
development of our local economy.They will not only benefit the business
community but will also encourage tourism.''

LAMENESS in the dairy herd may be costing many farmers much more than
they think, according to a leading vet.
By the time conditions such as foul foot or dermatitis were visible
the damage had been going on for anything up to six weeks Gloucester vet
Roger Blowey told a meeting of dairy farmers in Stonehaven yesterday.
The consequent effects on profitability should not be under-estimated.
''Around a quarter of cows in the national herd are treated annually
for lameness -- and independent investigation suggests that the cost per
case can be as high as #390 for a single ulcer,'' he said. ''The figure
is so high because of the influence of lameness on fertility.''
As well as economic loss, he added, there was a hassle factor of
treatment and the effect on cow welfare. More attention should be paid
to prevention.
Suggesting that a lot of lameness was associated with problems at
calving, Mr Blowey explained that vets knew from the days of horned
animals that calving was a stress on horn formation. The foot also gave
a historical picture but the effects were a bit harder to see.
''What we now suspect is that calving is a much more stressful
condition than we've hitherto given credit to,'' he said. ''As well as
that disruption we impose at the same time additional stresses on the
cow -- such as a sudden change in environment and diet. I believe we
tend to under-estimate these factors.''
Many causes of lameness were related to accumulation of fluid on the
udder and in feet, with heifers particularly at risk in a strange
environment which might mean them having to get used to the change from
the soft surface of grass to concrete cubicles. Common calving-time
diseases like mastitis also caused poor horn growth.
''At calving an animal spends longer standing up so she must have good
conditions in which to lie down in order to tempt her to do so,'' said
Mr Blowey.
He also urged farmers to take care when changing the feeding regime
and suggested that the use of high-quality precision chop silage --
which went through the cow very quickly -- was not ideal feed for dairy
cows. It was important to know what kind of silage was being fed -- some
could lead to acidosis, while more fibrous feed needed high
concentrates. Getting it wrong could ''blast the feet off dairy cows,''
he said.
The design of cublicles was also important. They had to be big enough
and comfortable enough for the animals to lie down and had to have
enough room for it to lunge forward when getting up or down.
''If we can make cows more comfortable and if we can make them lie
down at time of calving, then we will be going some way forward to
reducing the costs of some of the most common problems,'' he said.

LINZI GORMAN does not mince her words when asked why she and her
husband William have been so successful in business: ''Sheer, bloody
hard work . . . and you can quote me on that!''
The husband and wife team is the driving force behind one of
Scotland's fastest growing companies, Supercard Retail Ltd, a greetings
card and gifts store chain with outlets throughout Scotland -- from
Hawick to Dundee.
Supercard was formed in 1991 to be run in harness with their existing
card wholesale operation, Gorman Graphics, trading from premises at
Hillington Industrial Estate near Paisley.
The Gorman's story is impressive by any standards: from 1993 to
January 1995 the combined companies turnover increased by an incredible
385% to #2.1m and the number of employees rose from 7 to 106.
Linzi says franchising Supercard in July 1994 was an obvious
development and one which has proved extremely successful: ''At the
moment six of our stores are run by franchisees and this is an area we
are developing. I would estimate that by the end of 1996 we'll have
something like 30 Supercard stores on line throughout Scotland, of which
roughly half will be franchised.''
The greetings card industry is highly competitive with several
well-known chains competing for a share of the market. However the
Gormans believe Supercard is well placed to maintain its strong foothold
through a keen ability to evaluate customer buying trends.
''Willie's been in this business for nearly 16 years and I've been
working with him for 14 of them, so between us we have a nose for what
type of cards people want to buy,'' Linzi adds.
''Approximately 70% of all cards bought are purchased by women, so we
place huge importance in stocking our shops with the cards which will
appeal to female buyers. However, we are noticing that the teenage
market is increasing at a furious pace, with more and more youngsters
buying cards for a whole variety of occasions.''
The Gorman's entrepreneurial skills are well known within the
Renfrewshire Enterprise headquarters in Pailsey.
Chief Executive Tony Cassidy comments: ''The two companies developed
by Linzi and William Gorman have created jobs not only in Renfrewshire
but throughout Scotland as well. They recognise the importance of
employing a skilled workforce and have sought our support to help with a
number of business development and training programmes. We are proud of
the progress they have made in a relatively short space of time and wish
them continued success.''
The company have entered for Renfrewshire Enterprise's first Business
Awards scheme, entries for which have to be received by April 7.
As to the future -- Linzi Gorman answers in her usual down to earth
fashion: ''We plan to open more stores in every Scottish town that would
benefit from a Supercard . . . and more bloody hard work, no doubt.''

THE traditional response to the sexual harassment issue is to
trivialise it, to see it as the province of a small number of over-sexed
middle-aged lechers who chase their young and pretty secretaries around
the office. In fact, sexual harassment is about power, not testosterone
and there is evidence that, in Scotland, there is a dramatic increase in
complaints and a growing recognition that sexual harassment is a
business issue which has to be addressed through better procedures and
training.
Research carried out by the Industrial Society in 1994 indicated that
50% of all working women in the UK had been sexually harassed at some
time in their careers. Perhaps more surprisingly, five per cent of cases
are brought by men. Closer to home, the Equal Opportunities Commission
in Scotland reported a 44% increase in sexual harassment cases in 1994
over the previous year. The commission believes that sexual harassment
may exist in every workplace and asserts that less than one per cent of
cases are based on false accusations.
Psychologist Dr Gillian Metze, who works with victims of sexual
harassment, observes that they become tense, anxious and frightened,
their self-confidence and self-esteem plummets and many experience
nightmares and a dramatic loss of interest in eating and socialising.
In common with much else in modern society, sexual harassment came to
the fore in the United States in the mid-Seventies, with a landmark case
in 1980 ruling that harassment on the grounds of sex was a violation of
the US anti-discrimination laws.
Scotland was the first country in Europe to implement sexual
discrimination legislation, with the 1985 case of Strathclyde v Porcelli
setting the standard -- sexual discrimination had not been a crime prior
to this case.
In 1993, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the #11,000
ceiling imposed by British courts on awards in sexual harassment cases
was unlawful. The Law Society of England and Wales forecasts that
settlements of between #20,000 and #30,000 will be the norm, with some
lawyers expecting awards of #100,000 and more.
Clearly, the financial implications for a company accused of sexual
harassment are serious enough, but added to these are the effects such
cases have on morale, performance and staff turnover.
''We live in a society biased towards men,'' says Richard Thomson of
TW Associates, an organisation and management development consultancy
involved in this area, ''and many men are unaware that their language
and behaviour is contributing to a discriminatory environment. A sexual
discrimination policy in the staff handbook is not enough. Ingrained
attitudes need to be changed through active training and education. We
need to understand why there is a need to change, not rely on
legislation which sets out procedures and imposes penalties.''

THERE are just two Scots in the Great Britain world championship side
which will compete in Bratislava for the Pool B event from April 12 to
21.
Only six Scots made the top 50 for last week's training session at
Milton Keynes, with Fife Flyers' forward and captain Iain Robertson, a
former ''young player of the year,'' and his goalminder team-mate Ricky
Grubb having been given the nod.
And the lack of Scottish presence is worrying, particularly as four
British League teams are based north of the Border, Premier Division
Racers and Flyers, plus two Division 1 sides, promotion prospects,
Paisley Pirates, and relegated Dumfries Vikings.
Recently players from Scottish sides have featured prominently in the
national squad.
Meanwhile, this weekend's final series of regular games will decide
who plays who in the British championship play-offs, and the
promotion/relegation play-offs.
The British championship qualifying sections, featuring the top eight
sides in the Premier Division, are:
Group A -- Teams finishing first, third, sixth and eighth. Group B --
Teams finishing second, fourth, fifth, and seventh. The top two move to
the championship semi-final at Wembley on April 15.
The promotion/relegation play-offs, including the bottom four teams in
the Premier and the top four in Division 1, are:
Group A -- teams finishing ninth and twelfth in the Premier plus the
first and third in Division 1. Group B -- teams finishing tenth and
eleventh in the Premier against those finishing second and fourth in
Division 1.
The two group winners play Premier Division hockey next season.

IT seems a just coincidence that in a season when Gavin Hastings has
achieved remarkable form in the Five Nations' Championship, his alma
mater, George Watson's College in Edinburgh, has enjoyed one of its most
successful seasons to finish alongside that other school of rugby
excellence, Merchiston Castle, in the top rankings.
Watson's success story is better measured in terms of the calandar
year rather than the school rugby season. In January 1994, Watson's
defeated Royal Grammar School, Newcastle, 7-3 to begin a sequence of
victories that was to continue until this year when they lost 19-18 to
local rivals Stewart's-Melville.
That added up to 27 victories that included wins over
Stewart's-Melville, by 18-14, and Eton College, 5-3, the latter
performance giving an indication of what was to follow later.
''That game gave us a guage of how things were going to turn out this
season,'' reflected Roy Mack, the head of physical education at
Watson's. Wins against Loretto, Fettes, and Glenalmond were followed by
a 17-7 victory over Edinburgh Academy but the big success this season
was the 27-22 defeat of Merchiston at Myreside watched by a crowd of
more than 1000.
Four days later, Watson's added Gordonstoun to their list and then
completed the year in fine style by defeating Heriot's 20-7. In the
twelve-month period, Watson's scored 1076 points while conceding just
172, figures which say a lot about the attacking ability of the side.
The first XV, of course, is the showcase for a school which turns out
24 teams every Saturday. A co-educational school, Watson's nevertheless
has 950 boys, all of whom are exposed to a balanced physical educational
curriculum consistent with current approaches. Rugby, in fact, is not
compulsory and, for the most part, is an after-school activity.
Mack heads a physical education department of 10 which includes Andrew
Ker, the former Kelso and Scotland stand-off, Ally Donaldson, the Currie
and Edinburgh player, Scottish Schools treasurer Ian Brown, and former
Trinity hooker Alan Bennett.
It also helps to have high-profile role models, the latest of whom are
Gavin and Scott Hastings. The brothers are two of the many Watson's
players who have represented Scottish Schools.
Their present-day successor is Danny Mallinson, who has played both at
full back and wing for Scottish Schools and could be the player to take
over from Gavin Hastings at Myreside when the Scotland captain decides
to retire.
And Mallinson could be destined to go all the way and win a full
Scotland cap.
After all, there is a well-trodden path to Murrayfield from George
Watson's College, a centre of excellence that should continue to
flourish as one of the top rugby schools in Scotland.

What's up, doc? Animation festivals in East Kilbride and Stirling.
David Grant finds there is more to them than meets the eye
IT takes Quentin Tarantino a mere split second to splatter someone's
insides all over the big screen. So spare a thought for the poor
animator of old Wile E. Coyote, or Tom Cat, as they suffer through the
endless tiny movements before that anvil smashes heads.
Consider this: the traditional cartoon animation requires an artist
(or team of artists) to produce 24 drawings that create just a second of
screen action. When you know that director Tim Burton had to accumulate
108,000 tiny movements to assemble the mere 72 minutes of the
stop-motion horror extravaganza, The Nightmare Before Christmas, you
begin to appreciate the meticulous art of animation.
So children of all ages should greet two animation festivals
brightening up the screens in Scotland in the coming weeks.
The East Kilbride Animation Festival takes place in the town's Civic
Centre on Saturday, with five different types of animation -- cartoon,
live action with cell animation, models, computer-generated images and
collage.
Meanwhile, the twelfth annual Puppet and Animation Festival stretches
from Stirling to Lanark, with a myriad of events throughout the Easter
holiday period. Stirling's MacRobert Arts Centre has some impressive
screenings running from April 10 to 15.
The younger enthusiasts are well catered for at both festivals. At
East Kilbride, two workshops in animation will run. The first, for
younger children, will teach the basics of model-making and paper
cut-out techniques, and the work will be filmed to produce a
three-minute video.
The older children will be versed in the art of scratch-on-film
animation. Again, a three-minute 35mm film will be the product of the
workshop. Both will be viewed later in the day.
The finished articles from a series of school workshops will be seen
at the MacRobert, a prelude to a 70-minute overdose of Hollywood cartoon
tomfoolery on April 15.
East Kilbride is set to screen 32 international films (including
Nicole van Goethem's 1983 Oscar winner, Greek Tragedy), half of which
are Scottish premieres and three are 1995 Oscar nominees. The Civic
Centre wil also host a retrospective of Barry Purves' work.
In Stirling, too, there is something for every taste. After some
frantic fairytale reworkings, Tim ''Batman'' Burton's Nightmare is
coupled with his first animated work, Vincent.
The latest ultra-violent craze from Japan, Manga cartoons, is
represented by a sci-fi feature, The Wings of Honneamise.
The surreal and macabre wit of Jan Svankmajer and the Brother Quay --
devotees of Svankmajer's absurdist genre -- will appeal to older
aficionados of darker animation, but for many, the highlight of the
Stirling week will be an evening in the company of Aardman animation, in
the shape of the award-winning company's technical director, Glen Hall.
Wallace and Gromit fans will miss this helping of cracking toast at
their peril, as Hall follows screenings of The Wrong Trousers, A Grand
Day Out, and the plasticine-powered and socially-aware slice of Zoo TV,
Creature Comforts.
Finally, there's Tim Watts' and David Stoten's Oscar-nominated The Big
Story -- in which a cast of Kirk Douglases learn the truth of life in
the newspaper business. It's been showing with Pulp Fiction, but if you
haven't the stomach for Tarantino, you can see it at the end of Saturday
afternoon's programme in East Kilbride.
* Further information on the East Kilbride Animation Festival is
available from the Civic Centre, telephone 013552 71200, while details
of the Stirling-hosted Puppet and Animation Festival events are
available from the MacRobert Arts Centre on 01786 461081.

OBAN Camanachd have been left counting the cost of last weekend's
Glenmorangie Camanachd Cup victory over Skye. Striker Dave McCuish has a
broken bone in a foot and will be sidelined for at least six weeks,
which means he will miss the Keyline MacAulay Cup final if Oban qualify
by beating Inveraray and a Camanachd Cup tie against Beauly.
Fort William, surprisingly easy winners against Kingussie last weekend
in the Keyline MacAulay Cup, face a similar set of travel arrangements
this Saturday as their Camanachd Cup tie against Inveraray has been
scheduled for Inveraray, Fort William, Taynuilt, or Spean Bridge as the
Camanachd Association battle to beat the fixtures pile-up which has
developed.
If Fort's match fails to make it at any of the venues, the match will
be switched anywhere, with Perth again a possibility, in a bid to get it
played. Extra time and penalties have been sanctioned for this replay
after the teams shared four goals on their last meeting.
In league terms, this Saturday could also be crucial with both
Kingussie and Oban Camanachd ready to take a major step toward clinching
their respective first division titles in the north and south.
Kingussie need three points from their two remaining matches and
should pick up two when they take on Beauly at home. Oban Camanachd, who
face Strachur, need six points from four matches.

' There are no team orders at Williams so you can expect Damon Hill
and David Coulthard to be pushing each other '
By LEADING TV
COMMENTATOR
MURRAY WALKER
LET me start by saying that I believe that the coming season will be
the best for some time. I say that because so many things point to it
being a good year.
First, the conditions are right, the rule changes have ensured that
everybody has started with a clean sheet and a new car.
This was unavoidable because we now have new aero-dynamic regulations
and the engine capacity has dropped from 3.5 to 3 litres. With this
combination I can see a much closer championship.
We will still look to the ''big four,'' Williams, McLaren, Benetton,
and Ferrari, to provide the fireworks. However, I think by season's end
we could be talking in terms of the ''big five,'' because I think it's
graduation time for Jordan.
This is a team who achieved a coup in getting the Peugeot works deal
that McLaren had last year.
Eddie Jordan's team has been on the brink of stardom for some time, so
with Peugeot and drivers Eddie Irvine and Rubens Barrichello, Jordan are
an exciting prospect.
Looking elsewhere on the grid, I think we have to look for the French
team, Legier, to make a show. They were bought by Flavio Briatore, of
Benetton, last year and I expect there to have been some considerable
cross-fertilisation between the teams, the result of which should
provide Legier with a good car.
They will also have the Mugen engine and that means Honda, a company
used to winning. They have been at the top with Williams, Lotus, and
McLaren. So Legier is a team on the up.
You then have to consider Tyrell and Sauber, who have the highly
prized official works engine.
So they are the cars that should be making the headlines, but the most
important thing that is going to ensure a competitive championship is
that every one of the eight teams has two very closely matched drivers.
For example there are no team orders at Williams this season. So you
can expect Damon Hill and David Coulthard to be pushing each other.
Eight teams with drivers of this sort of combination will really turn
up the heat on the grid. With that in mind I would be very hard pushed
to say which team will do best this year.
Conventional wisdom says Williams, Benetton, and McLaren will be the
top teams and if you are a serious Formula One fan, you have to hope
Ferrari will do well.
The thing with them is that they could have a problem with their V12,
3 litre engine, the characteristics of which may not be perfect for the
new formula. I hope they can get it right because with Gerhard Berger
and Jean Alesi, you have two fantastic driving talents.
Alesi is in search of his first victory and so often it's the same
drivers who win the races. This year we could see some new faces holding
a grand prix trophy.
Martin Brundle for one. He is a fine British driver who's been around
a long time and deserves a win, Johnny Herbert could win this year
because he's in the Benetton team and it would be no surprise to see
David Coulthard notch his first championship win.
Scotland have produced outstanding drivers and David has the potential
to be a world champion. He has been impressive but we must not forget
that he has only driven in eight grands prix.
This fact alone should not let people get carried away and suggest he
might be world champion this year, especially bearing in mind the
calibre of opposition he faces this year.
I say that not in any way to put David down as a driver. I say it
because one of the things you need as a driver in F1 is experience, and
that is what David lacks.
He is a very level-headed, sensible, mature, and intelligent young man
and I'm sure if you asked him he would agree that he needs more races
under his belt.
Michael Schumacher won the world championship in only his third full
season. He is a phenomenal talent but everyone needs experience behind
them to be a challenger for the title, and Michael now is a veteran of
50-odd races.
Anybody could tip Schumacher to take the title again this year, but I
am not going to do it. I'm going to predict that Nigel Mansell will win
his second world championship this year.
I am overjoyed that Nigel is back in F1 and found a berth with
McLaren, although actually filling that berth seems to be a problem at
the moment. If the car overcomes its problems Nigel can certainly go all
the way.
He is as hungry as ever for success and really wants that second
championship. With his focus and determination, it would be folly for
the critics to write him off.
All in all this should be a great season for the fans and I can hardly
wait until March 26 when we get it under way on Sunday.
Murray Walker was talking to Jim Kelly.

SRI Lanka yesterday clinched their first series victory abroad by
drawing the second and final Test against New Zealand in Dunedin.
The visiting side resumed in the morning on 210 for three, a lead of
136, but some ineffectual New Zealand bowling allowed them to reach 411
all out.
Bryan Young then faced just one ball before a successful appeal
against bad light ended play and completed Sri Lanka's triumph.
New Zealand skipper Ken Rutherford, whose side have lost five and
drawn two of the eight Tests they have played this season, now believes
his captaincy is in jeopardy. ''I imagine New Zealand cricket will be
thinking long and hard over who they want to see leading the side next
summer,'' he said.
Sri Lanka batsman Asanka Gurusinha resumed the day on 92 and went on
to make 127 -- his sixth Test century -- before lunch. Hashan
Tillekeratne recorded his second Test ton with 108.
Captain Arjuna Ranatunga said there was some thought to setting New
Zealand a target of 250 in 50 overs but an ankle injury to pace bowler
Pramodya Wickremasinghe forced a rethink.
Ranatunga was delighted. ''I have waited a long and hard 13 years for
this. I am very pleased that it has finally come about,'' he said. Man
of the match was all-rounder Chaminda Vaas, who took five wickets and
also made his maiden Test half-century in Sri Lanka's first innings.

The box office is not the only source of cartoon revenue. Keith Bruce
checks out the market in the art-form's collectables.
GARY Kogon practically boasts of the allergies which gave him the
nick-name of ''Sneezy'' as a child. There are two good reasons for this.
First, he's small and dapper and the parallel with one of Snow White's
little chums could have been much less kind. Secondly, it led directly
to the career that has made him a wealthy man.
In that cruel way adults have, the young Kogon was presented with
numerous gifts connected with his alter ego, so when he was taken to
Disneyland in the 1960s he invested his $1 pocket-money wisely in a
single celluloid frame of the dwarf from the original cartoon.
In a week when the Disney organisation has used a couple of elephants
to destroy pirate toys in India as a symbol of its litigous commercial
intent, it seems incredible that such a cherished item was simply dumped
in a souvenir bin little more than 25 years ago, but that was the way
things were.
It was not until 1984 that animation art was declared an indigenous
American art form (surely an arguable point), an honour only previously
accorded to jazz.
By then, the enterprising Kogon was well ahead of the game. He's moved
out of the restaurant business into collectable animation art, with a
couple of galleries in his home town of Boston.
The market had moved on some considerable distance by then with single
''cells'' from the 1940s fetching #16,000 at Christie's in London and a
1934 Disney cell from the cartoon, Orphans' Benefit, reaching a record
$454,000 in the US.
Predictably, the studios started to wise up to the value of their
assets but, strangely, Disney has still been slower to capitalise than
Warner Brothers, home of Bugs Bunny, Elmer Fudd, Sylvester, and the
God-like Chuck Jones, doyen of animators.
Kogon was head-hunted by Warners to direct its worldwide gallery
operations, which occupy a lucrative corner of its stores, including the
one in Glasgow's Buchanan Street.
Warners have moved $1 bargain-bins of discarded celluloid on to
another plane altogether with a range of collectable cartoon-derived
artefacts at prices for the dedicated.
Production cells range from #200 to more than #300, and the market has
been creatively expanded with the origination of limited edition cells
specially for collectors and runs of (similarly limited) commissioned
prints.
Surely, though, there are limitations on the archive Warners can
exploit. Bugs only made 170 six-minute cartoons, after all. That's a
mere 884,000 cells, or thereabouts.
Relax, Bunny-lovers, the Brothers have just signed the 82-year-old
Chuck Jones to a new 80-year contract and the new Roadrunner/Wile E.
Coyote opus, Chariots of Fur, is his first work in 30 years.
And he's training a new team in the techniques behind those Merrie
Melodies classics.
''Sneezy'' Kogon's personal collection now stands at some 110 pieces
-- some of them very valuable indeed -- and his job looks safe for some
time. Which understandably pleases the small man no end.
''As long as I can be a kid, I'm gonna be,'' he confesses.

IMPORTING plane-loads of frozen croissant-shaped dough from France and
baking it in Scotland is certainly possible. But when you can buy
authentic French croissants, made to traditional French recipes and of
the finest quality flour, with no additives or preservatives, and which
are freshly baked every day in Springburn, it does seem a touch
unnecessary.
When you discover they are delivered, still warm, to delicatessens,
restaurants, cafes and hotels all over Glasgow, importing could be seen
as downright perverse. Especially when there are many who would claim
that these Springburn croissants, made by Patisserie Francoise, are the
best they've tasted outside France.
No need to search hard for the explanation for their delectable
excellence. Patisserie Francoise this year celebrates a quarter of a
century as a French bakery in Glasgow. And its roots go further back
still, to the twenties, when Tony Cocozza's grandfather first came to
Glasgow and built up three cafes which flourished until, like most of
Springburn, they were demolished in the sixties.
However, in the meantime, Cocozza's father, Adolfo, had married a
French girl, Francoise. She was a talented baker who had learned her
skills at her brother's baker's shop in Chalons-sur-Marne; and when she
came to Glasgow she became the very first baker of croissants here,
supplying them and brioches, patisserie, and gateaux to the three cafes.
As a result, by 1970, the bakery business had started to overtake the
cafes, and Francoise and Adolfo had established their Patisserie
Francoise in Springburn.
Now, 25 years later, it again supplies its own outlets as well -- the
Patisserie Francoise in Byres Road, which this year celebrates its tenth
birthday, and a licensed cafe in the Italian Centre, which opened three
years ago. And like its baguettes which gradually expand as they rise
and prove before baking, the business has grown so much that now not
only are there seven bakery employees but the entire Cocozza family of
four children also works for the firm.
This is a real family business in every sense of the word. Adolfo and
Francoise are still closely involved in the bakery, Adolfo turning his
hand to anything that needs doing, while Francoise makes all the special
gateaux, the wedding cakes, the crocodile cake ordered by Elton John
when he was once in Glasgow, and the special gateau baked in honour of
the Queen Mother when she opened the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and
Drama a few years ago.
Tony's three sisters are equally active in the company. Natalie is in
charge of the patisserie part of the bakery, helped by Linda; Yasmin
runs the two cafes, both of which have a loyal regular clientele as well
as plenty of passing trade -- in response to healthy customer demand the
Byres Road outlet doubled in size just before Chrismas.
And Tony himself has taken over the running of the whole business from
his parents. This means long 12-hour days which frequently start at 5am,
and in which he copes with almost anything and everything.
In what spare time he has, Tony is presently in the midsts of planning
the move from the current bakery premises to a larger site, nearby in
Springburn, where he plans a new purpose-built bakery which will give
still greater scope for the growth of the business.
There's no shortage of hard work but the satisfactions of creativity
as a baker and achievement as a businessman are more than compensation
-- indeed he relishes these as much as his customers relish those
delicious and perfectly baked croissants with their breakfast coffee.

A SECOND company has been examining the Kishorn yard in Wester Ross,
with a view to taking advantage of renewed interest in concrete oil
platforms to exploit the oil fields west of Shetland and in the
Atlantic.
Last summer, Costain/Taylor Woodrow revealed that they are interested
in reopening the yard to build a concrete platform, and that they would
need a labour camp for 500 workers.
Now it is understood that representatives from John Laing Engineering
have also been to see the yard in the past few weeks.
They are believed to be examining the suitability of the Kishorn yard
for building a concrete tension leg production platform, in partnership
with another oil fabrication company, for the fields discovered west of
Shetland. BP are already known to be looking at several options,
including three concrete platform designs, for the second phase of its
Foinaven field development.
McDermott/Golar Nor and Brown and Root/Single Buoy Moorings are each
proposing a steel floating production storage and offloading vessel.
Three other consortiums are proposing a concrete semi-submersible, a
concrete tension leg platform, and a concrete monohull, respectively.
One of the consortiums involves McAlpine and Doris Engineering. Doris
Engineering were partners in Howard-Doris when the Kishorn yard was in
full operation in the seventies and eighties, but if they are
successful, they are more likely to use the yard at Ardyne Point, which
is owned by McAlpine.
Amerada Hess are also active in the area, in the Solan, Schiehallion,
Strathmore and Clair fields, and they are planning to drill at least a
dozen appraisal wells this year, one of which was reported to be ''dry''
earlier this week. It is likely that if the concrete options prove to be
cost-effective, this would be an attractive path for other companies to
follow. A spokesman for Amerada Hess said it was too early to say what
options they would choose, but that nothing is being ruled out at this
stage.
Costain/Taylor Woodrow, who are preparing to float out a concrete
gravity base structure from Hunterston in Ayshire next month, for BP's
Harding field in the central North Sea, are also interested in bidding
for work west of Shetland, and using the Kishorn yard for any contracts
they might win. But a spokesman would say this week only that as far as
the Kishorn yard is concerned, negotiations with the yard's landlords
are ongoing.
According to a spokesman for Doris Engineering, interest in concrete
platforms is increasing because the sea depths west of Shetland make
steel jackets, which would sit on the seabed, impractical. Concrete
platforms are more stable, and while the capital cost of building can be
high, easier maintenance means lower running costs.
They can also be designed to have inbuilt storage space for oil, which
can then be transferred to tankers for trans-shipment to shore
terminals. But this upsurge in activity will also have an impact on
Highland yards involved in steel fabrication, since orders for topside
facilities will also be placed. The industry, consequently, expects 1996
to be a busy year.
But even if the companies developing the west of Shetland fields
decide to go for the concrete options, the Kishorn yard faces stiff
competition, both in Norway and in the UK. Facilities at Hunterston,
Ardyne Point, and in England are also available, and the Highlands
Fabricators yard at Nigg is also presenting its dry dock as another
possible facility.

SHIRE took the lead after 20 minutes when Michael Geraghty sent a
thundering shot past Derek Watson and nine minutes before the break Ian
Lee extended the advantage.
With 15 minutes left Peter Dwyer added a third for Shire but Stuart

EDINBURGH University yesterday made rugby history by becoming the
first side to play against a team from mainland China in an
international tournament.
The Edinburgh students were taking part in a 10-a-side tournament in
Hong Kong in preparation for the Cathay Pacific/Hong Kong Bank
Invitation sevens this weekend.
Edinburgh, with centre Glen Howett in excellent form, had little
difficulty in defeating Beijing Agricultural University 24-0, their
tries coming from George McKinley (2) and Jamie Douglas (2), and two
conversions by Stuart Pearson.
In an earlier tie, the Edinburgh students opened strongly against Hong
Kong Dragons and won 24-0 through tries by Pearson (2), Craig Hunter and
John McKinley, two of the scores being converted by David Officer.
George McKinley added to his tally with a try in Edinburgh's third and
last game against the bizarrely named Funky Gibbons from Australia, who
scored a 12-5 win over the Scots. That result gave the Edinburgh
students second position in their pool and a place in today's
quarter-finals of the plate competition.

GEORGE Hume's brilliant and devastating attack on the credo of money
and its sweeping consequences for the general wellbeing of society
should be a warning to all in power, and those who aspire to it (March
17).
But when the chips are really down at the national political beauty
contest in two years' time (or earlier), how many of the big players --
those with so much to lose -- will actually desert the Conservatives?
One thing seems certain. In the new millennium we can achieve that
ideal so eloquently proclaimed at Gettysburg in 1863, the faithful
enactment and delivery of which seem so far to have eluded us: '' . . .
government of the people, by the people''.

William Russell reviews this week's crop of new film releases
THRILLS, spills and heart-stopping action are what you get in John
Badham's Drop Zone. What you don't get is a plot that makes sense, but
this is one of those films which began with the stunts and the plot got
tagged on to justify them later. The aim is to get the audience on the
edge of their seats as often as possible, and it does exactly that.
In a good thriller the hero is changed by the adventures he has
endured. Cary Grant in Hitchcock's North by North West, for instance,
starts off as a smooth, smug chap in control of events and ends up
hanging on for dear life from the stone faces on Mount Rushmore in a
somewhat dishevelled condition, very much out of control of events. He
has also fallen in love.
Here, Wesley Snipes, playing dense macho US Marshall, Pete Nessip,
ends up a little battered round the edges, but otherwise still the same
old macho thick Pete. He does not even get round to kissing the heroine,
Jessie Crossman (Yancey Butler), although he does give her a punch on
the jaw since he is a man's man and she is a man's woman. Jessie looks
pleased by the attention!
Pete and his brother Terry, also a US Marshall, are escorting a
computer genius from one jail to another on a commercial flight when it
is ambushed by terrorists led by Ty Moncrief (Gary Busey), who has
wall-to-wall teeth which he uses to bite off the computer expert's
little finger. In the ensuing melee a door is blasted open, and half the
passengers sucked out into space, including the terrorists, Terry, and
the computer man.
But it is all scam. The villains, expert sky-divers, have chosen this
method to spring the computer expert, because they intend to break into
the US Drug Enforcement Agency computer and sell the identities of all
the undercover agents to the drug cartels. The break-in is to be done
under cover of a Fourth of July mass parachute drop over Washington.
The violence is excessive -- a policeman has his throat cut on camera,
for instance -- though Busey's wallies, a miracle of modern dentistry,
keep distracting one's attention. But Badham and his stuntmen have
delivered the necessary thrills as they fly through the air with the
greatest of ease whether from 38,000ft or the top of a skyscraper.
Anybody who has not read the book, probably the majority of the
potential cinema audience, will hugely enjoy Gillian Armstrong's
gorgeously photographed, well-acted, politically-correct,
feminist-oriented version of Louisa May Alcott's Little Women. Those
familiar with Miss Alcott's work may have reservations, but Armstrong,
Australia's finest director, has at last achieved what has so far eluded
her -- a Hollywood box office hit.
The problem with this up-dating of the story for the 1990s is that the
picture it gives of the lives of young women in the 1860s becomes
falsified. Does it matter? If there are lessons to be learned by men and
women today from how society behaved in the past then one should see how
it behaved, not how we would like it to have behaved, which is what the
film provides.
It is not that Armstrong, best known for My Brilliant Career about a
young woman finding freedom through writing, or Robin Swicord, who wrote
the script, have done anything too awful to the story of the March girls
and their long suffering Marmee. But somewhere along the line what the
two novels, Little Women and Good Wives, on which the film is based,
have to say about women's lives at the time has vanished.
Ditching the Beth, the piano and old Mr Lawrence plotline for the
ineffectual revised version provided, seems perverse, and by stopping Jo
lamenting that she is not a boy -- something today's girl would never do
-- one takes away the dilemma any girl of spirit had to cope with then.
Society did not allow her to do things that a less talented boy would be
allowed to do as a matter of course.
The other alterations are of little moment. The details added from
what is known about the real life Alcotts -- Marmee (Susan Sarandon) is
a practitioner of homeopathic medicine, Jo (Winona Ryder) discusses
female suffrage when she goes to New York to work, and Professor Bhaer
becomes a transcendentalist -- being neither here nor there. The trouble
arises with the updating of Alcott's text.
In Little Women, Marmee tells her girls: -- ''I want my daughters to
be beautiful, accomplished, and good; to be admired, loved, and
respected; to have a happy youth, to be well and wisely married, and to
lead useful, pleasant lives with as little care and sorrow to try them
as God sees fit to send.
''To be loved and chosen by a good man is the best and sweetest thing
which can happen to a woman and I sincerely hope my girls may know this
beautiful experience.''
It contrasts starkly with the text for today Marmee actually delivers.
Sarandon is oddly ineffectual, but Ryder's Jo, although far too pretty,
and by no stretch of the imagination a tomboy, is the best thing she has
done. She conveys perfectly the frustrations endured by a girl of spirit
trapped by society's rules.
Expertly made and lovely to look at, it will warm the cockles of lots
of hearts even if Meg, Beth and Amy are no more than adequately cast,
and the men are a job-lot to say the least. Eric Stoltz's John Brooke is
the sort of sanctimonious creep sensible girls cross the street to
avoid, and Gabriel Byrne's Professor Bhaer is more a Glockamorra than
Mittel European heart-throb.
But for all its felicities, what we see is women's lives in the 1860s
as women of 1990 would like them to have been. The depiction of how it
was is what gives the novels their value and the film, by falsifying
things -- not for dramatic ends, but for feminist reasons -- does both
Alcott and the audience a disservice.
Another woman director -- they are not quite as thin on the ground as
all that -- Darnell Martin, makes an impressive debut with I Like it
Like That, a story about Puerto Ricans living in the South Bronx. A
chaotic affair bursting with energy and much Latin loving, as Lisette
(Lauren Velez) falls out with Chino (Jon Seda), the father of her child,
throws him out and sets about achieving her independence, it would have
benefitted from a little restraint. The top of the voice lifestyle
eventually becomes rather wearing, but the encounter between Lisette and
her new, sexually predatory boss (Griffin Dunne) is worth the price of
admission alone. No man should ever ask ''How was it for you?'' He may
get told. Rita Moreno sparkles as Chino's mother who thinks her son
could do better.

FIONA Campbell and Kirsty Hope, who will both compete for Scotland in
next month's Multi-Nations tournament at Edinburgh's Commonwealth Pool,
head Scotland's attempt to upset the English in this weekend's schools'
home internationals in Cork.
England have never been beaten in the annual event, but the Scots are
particularly strong at junior and intermediate level, with Bryan Morgan,
Karen-Marie Lewis, Fraser Bisley, and Lynn McLaren all having shown fine
form in recent weeks.
''Because of differences in the systems, the English pupils tend to
stay on for an extra year, so they always have an advantage at senior
level,'' said school's organiser Ken White.
The final qualifying round of the Speedo British Grand Prix also takes
place at Crystal Palace in London this weekend, but it has been almost
ignored by the Scottish swimmers.
Angela Pendrich, who returns today from the Scottish squad training
camp in Lanzarote, and Warrender's Richard Hope are competing along with
the Stirling University pair of Pauline McLean and Forbes Dunlop. The
Grand Prix Superfinal takes place in Cardiff in May, and is equally
likely to be short of Scottish interest.

MURRAY Walker, ''The voice of motor sport,'' is, of course, a highly
respected sports commentator, but his tendency to make the odd cock-up
has helped to establish him as a legend in his own lifetime.
Once after a gruelling race he asked Nigel Mansell to show the viewers
a nasty bump the driver had sustained on his forehead. Mansell gingerly
lifted his cap off, whereupon Murray stabbed a finger straight on to the
bump, inquiring of a screaming Mansell that he had found the right spot.
Countless times Murray described the masterful display of driving on
offer only for the object of his comments to make a mistake and finish
upside down off the track.
Situations like this, Murray insists, best explain his reputation for
dropping clangers. ''So often it's not mistakes I have made but an
unhappy coincidence of my description of events turning disastrously
wrong almost instantaneously, but that's the beauty of live
television.''
Murray's voice is an impressionist's dream and his catalogue of
blunders have attracted much leg-pulling over the years. But it does not
bother him. He said: ''I have a sense of humour, so it's not a problem,
it shows I am only human and make mistakes like everybody else, it's
just that perhaps I make more than most.''

ST ALOYSIUS won the Bank of Scotland Schools Cup, beating Queen
Victoria School 44-10 with seven tries to one in the final yesterday at
Malleny Park, Currie.
It was the Glasgow schools fourth victory in eight successive finals,
but they owed much to captain and right wing, James Craig, son of
Celtic's 1967 Lisbon Lion, who ran in all three first-half tries as well
as kicking three conversions and a penalty goal for 24 points.
It was, too, one of St Aloysius' easiest final wins, though against
the wind in the first half they had to work hard to subdue the stuffy
Dunblane team. The difference was in Craig's scoring.
* SCOTLAND'S warm-up for the FIRA junior tournament next month
produced only one try last night at Murrayfield, but it was still a good
trial for the Bucharest challenge, according to the team's coach,
Alastair Christie.
The FIRA squad won 7-3 against a team drawn from those under-19 Scots
ineligible for the tournament.
Gregor Hayter scored the game's only try off a forward drive after 28
minutes. Graeme Hay converted. Four minutes later Michael Duncan had a
penalty goal for the opposition.

MANCHESTER United trimmed Blackburn's lead at the top of the English
Premiership to three points after their 3-0 win against Arsenal at Old
Trafford last night.
Early goals from Mark Hughes and Lee Sharpe put United in command, and
Andrei Kanchelskis made sure of the points with a third after 80
minutes.
This success enabled United to bounce back to winning ways after
having been held by Spurs at home last week and then losing to Liverpool
at Anfield.
The result also tightens things up at the top again, but Blackburn
have the cushion of a game in hand.
Nottingham Forest boosted their hopes of qualifying for the UEFA Cup
with a 3-0 home win over Leeds. This success means that Forest now have
overhauled Liverpool, who fought out a 0-0 draw with Tottenham at White
Hart Lane.
Brian Roy, who struck twice, and Stan Collymore ended Leeds' run of
three successive victories, and the Forest defence can take credit for
keeping out Leeds, who had scored three goals in each of those last
three games.
Southampton completed a remarkable comeback after having trailed to a
goal in 17 minutes by Newcastle's Paul Kitson at the Dell.
Neil Heaney equalised four minutes from the end. Then new #1.2m
signing from Sheffield Wednesday, Gordon Watson, gave Saints the lead in
the last minute before Neil Shipperley made sure.
The win leaves Alan Ball's men in the bottom four, although they did
move above Crystal Palace. Kevin Gallen clinched victory for QPR in the
West London derby against Chelsea with a goal after 62 at Loftus Road.
In the FA Cup, Alan Smith's Crystal Palace booked their place in the
semi-final stage -- where they will face Manchester United -- with a 4-1
success at Wolverhampton.
At the top of Division 1, Bolton's 1-1 draw with Sheffield United at
Burnden Park did them more favours in the promotion race. They stay in
third position, but move to within a point of second-placed Tranmere and
two of leaders Middlesbrough, with a game in hand on both.
Nathan Blake gave Sheffield United the lead after 37 minutes, only for
Alan Stubbs to equalise five minutes later.

PETER Nicol and Senga Macfie completed a dismal day for Scottish
squash when they both made their exit in yesterday's first round of the
Leekes British Open at Cardiff.
For Scottish champion Nicol, the world No.5, a 15-14, 3-15, 17-15,
15-8 loss to French qualifier Julien Bonetat extended his disastrous
British Open record. Despite a meteoric rise through the rankings over
the past two years, he is still awaiting his first win in the top home
event.
In 1993, he failed to get past the qualifying rounds, while as a seed
last year he also went out to a qualifier. Even a return to the scene of
his most famous win -- against world champion Jansher Khan in the Welsh
Classic 13 months ago -- failed to end the jinx.
Macfie, the No.14 seed, looked set to make a remarkable recovery from
two games down to English qualifier, Donna Vardy, but she failed to
press home a 6-2 lead in the decider, and eventually lost 9-7, 10-8,
6-9, 0-9, 9-7.
Nicol attributed his defeat to a loss of confidence as the match
proceeded -- losing the third game from 6-0 ahead was particularly
destructive -- and there is little doubt that a recent bout of
tonsillitis has also taken its toll.
Ironically, Bonetat, the world No.27, paid tribute to the part played
by Nicol's coach, Neil Harvey. ''He has helped improve my fitness,''
said the 24 year-old.

SCOTLAND'S women players almost certainly waved goodbye to their hopes
of a third win in the home international indoor championship in
Ballymoney, Northern Ireland, yesterday when they went down 132-99 to
England.
The Scots now must hope that Wales can beat England this morning and
they can then record a big win over the hosts to allow them to complete
the hat trick.
However, that is not a realistic hope with Wales struggling to beat
Ireland 117-102 yesterday.
Scotland started brightly against the English, and with five ends
completed they were 33-20 in front. However, England hit back to take a
57-48 lead at the halfway point, and they pulled away over the second
half for a convincing victory.
The main problem for the Scots came in the rink skipped by Roberta
Hutchison. The Falkirk player, who had been the highest scorer against
Wales, went down 36-10 and lost a maximum 8 on the eighteenth end
against Irene Molyneux.
Joyce Lindores, with world champion Jan Woodley winning her first
international cap as lead in place of Liz Kirkwood, lost 22-15 to Norma
Shaw, Frances Haxton went down 18-20 to Mary Price, and Anne Watson was
edged out 21-22 by Jayne Roylands.
Scotland's only win came from Jeanette Conran who beat Wendy Line
18-15, while Auchinleck's Nancy Davidson forced a 17-17 draw with Mavis
Steele.

IT may not register on the Scottish festival seismograph, but in
several respects, the annual Glasgow Music Festival, which opens
tomorrow, is probably one of the biggest in the country.
The festival is funded 50% from sponsorship and the rest from fees and
admissions. It runs in the City Hall in Candleriggs and Renfield St
Stephen's Church Centre in Bath Street, and is a hectic, round-the-clock
affair.
Within eight days, the festival will feature almost 4000 performers,
ranging in age from six to 80. Audiences totalling over 6000 are
expected. And the entire venture is run on a budget of #12,000.
The Glasgow Music Festival -- now in its 83rd year -- offers, to the
man or woman in the street and the child in the classroom, the
opportunity to develop their performing skills.
The festival now offers more than 250 categories in music and speech.
New categories will allow performances from musicals and light opera,
while the range of piano solo events has been extended to include
ragtime and blues.
Speech categories, as usual, feature verse and public speaking, with,
this year, several new categories, including team debating, TV
newsreading (presented in association with BBC Television and judged by
newsreader Sally McNair) and drama monologues and duologues.
There is a competitive element, with trophies and prizes to be won.
However, festival chairman Robert MacDonald said: ''It's not the most
important part. We play down the competitive bit, though it does add
excitement.''
The results will be published in The Herald from Saturday.

THE ROYAL Bank of Scotland's corporate and institutional banking
division in the City of London has virtually completed its move into
shiny new offices located within the impressive late-nineteenth century
Prudential building off Holborn, now known as Waterhouse Square.
The move followed several years of strong growth in this divison. The
activities had been scattered among a number of locations in the City
and this was clearly becoming unacceptable.
''Customers should not expect to have to deal with people in several
different locations,'' observed Iain Robertson, a former head of the
Scottish Development Agency who has been managing director of the
division since 1992. He is now revelling in the new offices.
''I can now deal with issues with a quick walk round the office
whereas before it needed several separate phone calls.''
''We now have this tremendous capability of bringing teams together so
that when you get a particular proposal you can bring in a treasury
person, someone from structured finance, someone from the project
finance side, someone from the banking side, maybe someone from leasing.
So you can get the work done quickly.''
The main requirement for the new building was to obtain one of those
giant trading floors which are the feature of the City nowadays. This
floor is approximately 100 metres wide.
This requirement meant that there were few suitable buildings
available. The group's property people did look at Docklands, where a
financial area centred on Canary Wharf has been developed, but concluded
it was just too far from the City. Eventually the Prudential building
was chosen.
The site has been completely redeveloped while retaining the original,
elaborate facade -- which is a testament to Victorian bricklaying
skills.
The decision to take the 175,000 square foot site could not have been
better timed because the bank signed the lease just at the bottom of the
property bear market.
Royal Bank's property department worked with architects Thomas
Saunders Partnership to fit out the building. The costliest part of the
work was the #17m installation of the sophisticated electronics needed
to keep the trading screens winking. In all, some 650 miles of cabling
was laid. Previously the group had lagged a little in the technology
stakes but is now state of the art.
''We were lucky in a way because we did not invest perhaps as much as
we should have done in the 1980s,'' said Mr Robertson. ''But because of
the speed of technological change this has enabled us to leapfrog a
couple of generations. We have chosen products which are proven but at
the front end of the technology.''
Installed by a firm called Wall Street Systems, the network allows Mr
Robertson to see what positions the bank has outstanding at the press of
a button, a useful precaution these days. Not that the bank does much
proprietary trading, the great majority of business comes from
customers.
''One inevitably does it to a small extent,'' said Mr Robertson. ''But
the small amount of proprietary trading we do means any danger is
limited. We expect our books to be reconciled by the time the back
office goes home at night.
''But if you get what appears to be fraud, you don't want to say it
can never happen. However, given that we are customer driven, I feel it
is much less likely to happen to a bank like ourselves.''
The driving force behind the corporate and institutional division has
been to make better use of the customer base through offering more
services.
''Some 60% of income growth has come from encouraging existing
customers to use more services. The group is particularly strong in
certain niche areas like custody, security services and shipping and
increasingly in certain Treasury areas,'' added Mr Robertson
Customers have appreciated that the bank has stayed in the corporate
market despite making losses in the early 1990s. This has encouraged the
development of long-term relationships.
''This does not mean you get a better price but it does at least mean
that customers will give you first chance at a particular propositon.''
One area where the bank was behind was in treasury operations. Three
years ago its market share was perhaps half what it should have been
given its size in other activities. Now the division is two years into a
five-year plan to reach the market share it should have. Income from
this business has doubled, and could well double again as the customer
base has grown by a third.
The new premises have the capacity to handle this. Staff currently
number 800 and could go up to 1100 people. ''At that point we would
really have to move people into the corridors -- and don't believe I
wouldn't if we could get the business,'' quipped Mr Robertson.
Since 1991, the division's profits before provisions have risen by 59%
but its relative importance has not inceased because of growth elsewhere
in the group.
''As a percentage of the group total, our profits have actually fallen
but we shall continue to be a major contributor to the group as a
whole.''

Hamilton Accies 1, Dunfermline 3
DUNFERMLINE deserved to take the three points on offer at Firhill last
night which pushes them into the pace-setting role in the first division
on goal difference.
Hamilton tried to block the Fifers' path to the top and avoid their
fifth defeat on the trot, but it was not to be. Defensively they were
suspect although Alan Ferguson made a number of good saves.
A bad mistake led to Allan Moore opening the scoring three minutes
before the break, and slack covering allowed Hamish French his late,
points-clinching double.
Dunfermline dominated the first half, putting Accies keeper Ferguson
under pressure without cashing in on their outfield advantage.
Mark McCulloch had a drive touched over, then Marc Millar repeated
that feat before Andy Tod's header brought a goal-line save from
Ferguson. Then, with three minutes remaining before the interval and
Hamilton, not having tested van der Kamp, conceded a crazy opener.
Paul Chalmers was weak with a headed back pass just outside the box,
and Moore pounced to drive the ball home, leaving Ferguson stranded and
frustrated on his line.
After the break French struck twice to to clinch the points for
Dunfermline. His first came in 83 minutes when he controlled a Derek
Fleming corner before driving the ball into the net. And he added his
second three minutes later from the edge of the box.
Peter Duffield netted a consolation goal for the home side with just
seconds remaining.
HAMILTON -- Ferguson, Renicks, McInulty, McEntegart, McKenzie,
Hillcoat, Clark, Tighe, Chalmers, Duffield, McCormick. Substitutes --
Baptie, Lorimer, Cormack.
DUNFERMLINE -- Van der Kamp, McNamara, Fleming, McCathie, Tod,
McCulloch, Den Bieman, Robertson, French, Millar, Moore. Substitutes --
Hawkins, Smart, Westwater.
Referee -- T McCurry (Queen's Park).

AN 83-year-old widow and her son died when a blaze destroyed their
crofthouse near Grantown on Spey yesterday.
Firefighters discovered the bodies of Mrs Edith Ross, who had lived in
the cottage at Braes of Castle Grant for 60 years, and of her son,
Peter, 53.
The alarm had been raised at 4am by fencer, Mr David MacLeod, who
lives in a nearby caravan.
He said: ''I was wakened by the light from the flames. The whole
caravan was lit up. I ran round and the place was gone.
''The walls were falling in. There was nothing I could do.
''I phoned the fire brigade but there was nothing left when they got
here. Mrs Ross and Peter did not stand a chance in that fire.''
Deputy firemaster, Mr John Cheadle, said: ''It is a very rural
setting. The croft is in the middle of a field along a narrow track and
by the time we got there it was well alight.''
Mrs Ross, a widow for 20 years, and her son shared the corrugated-iron
roofed crofthouse which had no electricity.
Their meals were cooked over an open fire and water drawn from a well
50 yards away.
Mrs Ross's other son, Sandy, who lives nearby, said: ''We have been
trying for years to get her into a home but she was set in her ways.
''She loved that place. Nothing could persuade her to move.''
The cause of the blaze is under investigation.
* Another pensioner has died in a fire, in Chapelhill, Kirkcaldy.
A care assistant who called on 84-year-old Jane Purcell on Tuesday
night found her body in the smoke-filled living-room of the house where
she lived alone.
Firefighters discovered a small blaze had burned itself out.
Police said later that a post-mortem examination would be held.

THE article by Iain Wilson regarding the homeless in the Anderston
Centre made grim reading (March 18). If, as someone has said, a nation
is judged by the way it cares for its most disadvantaged, perhaps we
need not look at intractable economic theory for our missing feel-good
factor.
With the money spent on the National Health Service (more than ever
before), can some small resource not be made available to ensure that
homeless men and women are not denied access to a doctor because they
have no fixed address?

THE millionaire owner of the Stagecoach bus company, Mrs Ann Gloag,
came under fire yesterday from small businesses.
Tenants of industrial units in Perth owned by Mrs Gloag claimed they
were being forced to move out.
Mrs Gloag, a former Businesswoman of the Year, has been a past sponsor
of Perthshire Enterprise Company, which helps small businesses in the
city. Yesterday, however, she was on the receiving end of criticism from
the people she has tried to help.
Mr George Moyes, 60, who has run his painting and decorating business
from one of the units for more than 15 years, complained that his lease
was not being renewed.
He said: ''She's a hard woman. I feel gutted about this. I've only got
five years left before I retire and we only built this office two years
ago.
''There was a fire in the adjoining building in January. But, even
before the fire, we were told the lease was not being renewed. We never
got a reason.
''We've paid our rent up until the end of May, so we'll be moving to
new premises before then. What can we do? We feel we have been forced
out. When you come up against these sort of people, there's little you
can do.''
The firm paid a total of #2700 a year to Mrs Gloag in rent and service
charges.
Mr Moyes's wife, Sheila, 56, who works in the business, said: ''We had
to think about nine people's work and had to get a new place to keep the
business going. This will cost us valuable money, which we can't
afford.''
Other small businesses at the site complained that they were facing
uncertainty about their leases.
The manager of a joiner's firm said: ''We don't know what is going on.
Despite our phone calls, they haven't told us what is happening.''
Last night, Mrs Gloag said she sympathised with the tenants, but
stressed that her main concern was safety considerations after the fire.
She said: ''It has been a difficult patch for the small businesses in
the units. There are a number of problems with the safety of the
building, which we are trying to sort out. We have been reasonable but
have had to be forceful with tenants who have been understandably
reluctant to move. But we have offered them premises elsewhere in
Perth.''
She added: ''It is a pity that all of the tenants have had to suffer
because of what I suspect was the carelessness of one tenant in the
first place who started the fire.''

AT last we hear, in the letter from Paul Laverty (March 17), the note
of piercing alarm warranted by what is happening at lightning speed to
the world's economy, with its accompanying powerful threat to democracy.
Ralph Nader, in his book, The Case against ''Free Trade'': Gatt,
Nafta, and the Globalisation of Corporate Power, describes it as a
''race to the bottom'' led by the IMF, the World Bank, and above all by
GATT, NAFTA, and the new World Trade Organisation.
These bodies, he says, are leading the planet in exactly the wrong
direction. If you ''want a small-scale preview of the post-Gatt and
Nafta free-trade world'', check out what has happened to Mexico. Its
economy is now in the hands of the USA, the ''foreign tigers have
overwhelmed the Mexican pussycats'', as a Mexican businessman has said,
and the poorest of Mexico's poor, the Maya Indians of Chiapas, are
forced to take up arms in their misery.
The whole situation has been summed up by Herman E Daly, an economist
in the Environment Department of the World Bank, writing in a personal
capacity.
He says the Gatt agreements mean ''the destruction of local and
national communities in the service of a single cosmopolitan world of
footloose money managers who constitute, not a community, but merely an
interdependent, mutually vulnerable, unstable coalition of short-term
interests.''
Ralph Nader's book should be compulsory reading for all ''New''
Labour's leaders and MPs, indeed for all British Opposition politicians.

An off-the-couch joust with psychiatrists can be stressful, as Joe
Donnelly recalls
THEY were all there for the asking. In fact it was hard to decide
whether the trick cyclists were promoting depression or trying to cure
it -- at a recent afternoon gathering in the Moat House of the Royal
College of Psychiatrists.
Finding a collective noun merely added to the anxiety of attending
such a conference. A shrive of shrinks? A smirk? (They do when they
realise you're a lay-person with only practical and personal knowledge
of mental imbalance which, of course they have diagnosed at forty
paces.) A slip of Freudians?
Try to get them to speak in plain English and they look at you as if
you are mad. In their professional opinion, you probably are, though
they won't use two-syllable words in confirming their diagnosis and it's
a sure bet you need two Diazepam with every bill presented.
The wrong movie? I was in the Cuckoo's Nest suffering pre-frontal
assaults on all sides. There they were, handing out high-anxiety like
there was no tomorrow, and they'll claim tomorrow is merely a
present-induced abstract concept any old how.
Yet the psychiatrists, incomprehensible though they were, seemed
merely a front for the big issue. This was selling at its finest, at its
hardest. Even the brain-mashers would have recognised the techniques.
All the big suppliers were there, the world's dealers and pushers of
uppers and happiness capsules, of sunshine in a pill. They had stalls
and posters and free post-its and what-nots advertising this or that
cure for depression.
Every mental condition was catered for, to torment the easily led --
namely, me.
Kleptomania? There were samples for everything, except the tablets
(they assured me, though they may have lied). Yet many seemed reluctant
to be seen getting something for nothing, heisting the company gifts.
None the less, the free gifts disappeared like snow off a dyke.
Paranoia? The rep' from one pill-pusher was not having a happy day.
One had only to stand near her desk when she pounced. ''Didn't you get a
pen before now? Put that back. You've already had a leaflet. Who are you
looking at, eh?'' Scary stuff.
Lethargy? Two cups of the astringent coffee and I was bouncing along
like a pogo-person. At ceiling height. It was three hours before the
palpitations stopped.
Insomnia? Try reading Neuro Endocrine Challenges throughout the
Menstrual Cycle of Healthy Women. Then try to stay awake without the
coffee. Fail to understand it? See Paranoia again.
Hypochondria? See all of the above.
In fact, it's clear that simply to attend such a major league shrink
convention is symptomatic of the need for immediate specialist treatment
and all the happiness capsules the pill-mongers can churn out.
Yet the headshrinkers were a nice bunch of folk, even if they did
occasionally give one measuring looks that might have been assessing the
straight-jacket fit.

SAM Torrance and Bernard Gallacher, two experienced Ryder Cup players,
appeared to be cruising towards victory in their third-round match in
the Sunningdale Foursomes event yesterday.
The Scots were three up with as many to play when the wheels rather
came off their cart in devastating fashion against Richard Walker, the
23-year-old Wearside professional, and Robert Goldie, a 30-year-old car
upholsterer.
The English pair came back from the dead to win the match at the
nineteenth hole over the Sunningdale Old Course to provide the upset of
the tournament. Goldie could hardly believe that his side had won, even
though he was the star of the dramatic finish.
At the fifteenth, Goldie knocked in a four-foot putt to keep the match
alive. ''We were three down and we thought it was just a matter of time
before we lost,'' he said. ''I just knocked in the putt and we all
laughed about it.''
But then Goldie holed a No.7 iron from 165 yards for an eagle 2 at the
next hole and the two Scots three-putted the seventeenth, where
Gallacher missed from three feet. Now the Ryder Cup men were just one
up.
Worse was to follow for Torrance and Gallacher, for at the eighteenth
they took four shots to get down from 20 yards to lose the hole to a
bogey 5 and the match then went down the nineteenth.
Even then it looked as if the Scottish pair would win, for Walker cut
his second shot out to the right, and Gallacher was only just off the
green. But Goldie, who said later: ''It was the match of his life,''
played a superb chip to two feet, Torrance chipped four feet short, and
Gallacher missed the putt, while Walker sank his. Scottish scores:
SECOND ROUND
Old Course -- K Stables (Montrose) and A Webster (Edzell) (+2) beat A
Good and R Summerscales (Foxhills) (+2), 1 hole; D King and T Craik
(Frilford Heath) (2) beat J Collier and C Stewart (Walton Heath) (scr),
1 hole.
New Course -- S Little (Moor Park) and G Clark (Pinner Hill) (scr)
beat J Farmer (New, St Andrews) and D Scott (Letham Grange) (+2), 5 and
4; D Craik and L Jackson (Frilford Heath) (+1) beat L Donald

THIRD ROUND
Stables and Webster (+2) beat G Smith (Camberley Heath) and W Riley
(PGA European Tour) (+2), 3 and 2; King and Craik (2) beat T Morrison
and C Challen (Stoke Poges) (+1), 2 and 1; Little and Clark (scr) beat

beat Gallacher and Torrance (+2), at 19th.
* BARRY Lane is hoping that a change of clubs will bring a change of
luck as he defends the Turespana Balearic Open title in Majorca this
week.
He was told by Taylor-Made recently that they were not renewing his
contract and he has switched to playing Mizuno irons. ''It came as a
shock considering I was their highest-ranking player and had been with
them for five years,'' said Lane.
The 34-year-old, fourteenth in the Ryder Cup points table, went to
South Africa to try to rediscover his form, but had to fly straight home
again when his father died.
Lane won by two strokes last year, but that was at Son Vida and the
#250,000 event could not return there because of problems with the
greens. Instead, it is being played at Santa Ponsa II, a new course for
the European circuit which, according to Mark James, has ''some of the
smallest greens in the world.''
Already this season, five players have picked up their first pro
title, the latest being Glasgow's Adam Hunter at last week's Portuguese
Open. Hunter probably would have stayed at home celebrating but for the
fact that the Tour, having lost the Extremadura Open, takes a
fortnight's break after this week.
''I hardly slept on Sunday night,'' he said. ''Not because I was
partying, but because my mind was in a spin. It meant so much to me
after waiting 11 years.''

THIS week's Players' Championship may have fair claim to the greatest
field ever gathered for a golf tournament. Last year's Open was missing
the two top Americans, Fred Couples and Paul Azinger, while the US PGA
Championship, the next contender, had to pad out its field with 40 club
pros.
The Players' Championship is inching toward legitimising its claim to
be the fifth major by inviting the top 36 ranked golfers in the world,
46 of the top 50 in total are here, with the best player not present
being Sam Torrance.
Nick Faldo said yesterday: ''From a field sense, this tournament's got
everything. It's had quite a good run now, and it's getting a bit of
history behind it. The majors have so much history behind them. Another
90 years and they'll be there.''
With all of the talent gathered this week, there are still two names
which stand out -- Peter Jacobsen and Faldo. Jacobsen leads Faldo on the
US money list by more than $200,000, the bulk of his winnings coming
from his last five starts, in which he picked up two wins, a second and
a third. Faldo's record has been as impressive over just the last three
weeks, in which he has had a win at Doral, a runner-up finish the next
week at Honda, and a fifth place last week at Bay Hill.
After three straight weeks of grinding and contending, Faldo left Bay
Hill saying that was going to take the three practice days easy, perhaps
playing just nine holes on Tuesday and Wednesday. Faldo instead was
refreshed enough from just a one-day holiday on Monday to complete an
undiminished practice schedule over the next two days.
Aside from fatigue, Faldo left Bay Hill needing to tweak his driving.
He had been playing with persimmon for the past two weeks, but will go
back to a metal wood for this event.
Driving is going to be more important this week than in the past at
this course. This year the rough has been allowed to grow high,
narrowing the fairways by several yards and encircling the greens. This
change has been viewed by many players as a reaction to Greg Norman's
blitz of the course last year. Not only did Norman's winning score of 24
under par break Nick Price's record of 18 under, but so did Fuzzy
Zoeller's 20 under runner-up performance.

ON March 25, 1707, the old Scottish Parliament met for the last time,
to be replaced, as was the old English Parliament, by a new Parliament,
a British Parliament. Now, 288 years later, there seems to be a growing
consensus -- reflected, for example, in two recent Saturday essays in
this newspaper -- that it is time for Scotland to resume responsibility
for her own legislation.
If we are to understand why such a change may be necessary, and, which
is more important, to ensure that a new Scottish Parliament is
constructed to meet a real need, we should look at the role that the
Union Parliament was meant to play. We may then recognise that the
desire for change is not a narrow, party political one, but flows from a
generative change in the institutions of the state, and we may
understand better what the nature of a Scottish Parliament should be.
The eighteenth-century view of government was very different from
ours. About a hundred years later, poets and thinkers began to reflect
that ''The best government is that which governs least''. They did so
because they looked back from the hectic pace of the nineteenth century
to a more placid age, when the different elements in the constitution
stood in elegant equipoise, and government had the limited role that
Johnson recognised when he said: ''How small of all that human hearts
endure/That part which laws or kings can cause or cure.''
So although there may have been some popular and sentimental regret
when the Scots Parliament voted itself out of existence, and Lord
Chancellor Seafield said: ''There's an end of an auld sang'', what was
happening was hardly cataclysmic. Much -- indeed most -- of everyday
life was unaffected by Parliament. The critical elements of Scotland's
real identity were regarded as her Church and her legal system, and the
Treaty of Union specifically guaranteed their independence.
Lawyers' law -- indeed the law that touched the ordinary man -- was
not the child of statute, but the creation of the institutional writers
and the Roman jurists, interpreted by the courts. There was no income
tax in the 18th century; what the Act of Union was really about was
duties. In return for a harmonisation of tariffs and duties, the English
allowed Scots merchants access to trade with the colonies. This limited
bargain worked well for both sides. Lowland Scotland and the new
merchant classes prospered, and there were few, other than a hard core
of unreformed Jacobites, who regretted the Union.
But things changed quite soon after the turn of the century that had
created the Union. In 1803, income tax was introduced, and the cost of
the war with the French was only one consequence of the French
Revolution. Fear of revolutinary ideas gripped Parliament and found its
expression in repressive legislation. For the first time, the existence
of the Westminster Parliament began to have an impact on the Scottish
people. And that impact became all the greater as legislation was
generated to address the problems posed by the new phenomenon of an
increasingly industrial society.
The fine legislative torpor of the eighteenth century gave way to a
purposeful stream of enactments which swept through every aspect of
Scottish life, changing her public and private law beyond recognition.
What is interesting is that almost as soon as the function of the Union
began to change, Scots started to feel that government from Westminster
was ill-adapted to meet their needs.
By the 1880s, Home Rule was being vigorously advocated. The Scottish
Office was established in 1885 and the Office of Secretry of State,
which had appeared and disappeared through the eighteenth century, was
permanently re-established. But the growth of nationalism was not
checked, and as the nineteenth century drew to a close, Home Rule Bills
for Scotland and Ireland were introduced annually.
So, for its first hundred years, the Union Parliament did what it was
meant to, which is to say, very little. In its second century, it had
much more effect on every-day life and, by the end of that century,
there was an increasing and significant feeling that the Union did not
truly reflect Scotland's needs. Only in the present century has Scottish
opinion been required to come to terms with a Parliament that is no
longer satisfactory because it is not doing the job that it was designed
for. It's important, then, that we recognise that change is needed, not
for doctrinaire reasons, but to accord with the changing nature of the
times.
But we would do best to work on the basis of evolution and organic
growth, retaining those aspects of the Union that we can. In a recent
Saturday essay, Gavin Stamp said he would prefer an ongoing relationship
with the rest of the United Kingdom. If this were achieved in a federal
context, such a move would be consistent with the principles of 1707;
Scots should have no great difficulty in contemplating federalism.
In 1707, both the Scots and English Parliaments came to an end, and
were replaced by the new British Parliament. England never remembers
this fact, but Scotland does. We know, as the English forget, that we
surrendered a measure of sovereignty for good, practical reasons, and so
we don't get into a lather about surrendering a degree of sovereignty to
Europe. Indeed, many might be happier to be an influential component of
a European Parliament than a minor partner in a London one. That would
be a situation that would have appealed to the pragmatic Scots of 1707.

KILLERMONT Polo Club, one of Scotland's most stylish Indian
restaurants set in landscaped grounds at 2002 Maryhill Road, close to
the Bearsden border, continues to enjoy well-deserved favour on the good
food front. A runaway award winner celebrating its second year in the
prestigious Good Food Guide, the city's not too far pavilion is fully
operational after minor refurbishment to the entrance hall. For
aficionados of the spicy specialities of the great sub-continent adapted
to contemporary taste all roads lead to this mid nineteenth-century
former manse with its Trophy, Club and Polo rooms open for business
seven days a week.
The Trophy Room, seating 20, is an intimate enclave ideal for small
receptions and private dinner parties, while the Polo Room, seating 50,
is the perfect spot for splashing out in the grand manner. The Club
Room, seating 30, epitomises the days of the Raj with its wood
panelling, period photographs and polo paraphenalia making it a popular
West End watering hole.
In a relatively short space of time brothers Cal and Pami Dhaliwal
have revolutionised the eating out scene in the West of Scotland and
beyond as far as Indian food is concerned. Great care is taken in the
preparation of all dishes and their presentation is an eye-catching
delight. From home-made chutneys to custom-grafted sweets there is
something for everyone on the well-balanced menu at moderate cost for an
establishment of Polo Club quality. Tamarind and carrot chutney is
becoming a favourite with regular customers and spiced duck with cabbage
and potatoes was a recent hit on the #9.95 Sunday to Tuesday Gourmet
Buffet carte.
Prawns in coconut milk and bananas in spiced yoghurt have featured on
buffet nights but tops with seafood fanciers are the mussels
Goanese-style on the a-la-carte and lunchtime menus. Lemon rice with
cashew nuts adds an exotic touch to main course munching and chicken
done in several different ways is always well requested. Indian lager
from the Laltoofan brewery makes a perfectaccompaniment.
A sense of occasion and value for money go hand in hand at the
Killermont Polo Club. Parking presents no problem but it is essential to
book at weekends. The restaurant must be unique -- it does have a polo
team attached!

Dance
INTENSE, inventive, individual -- just three of the many celebratory
adjectives one could pin on the work shown by Canadian choreographers
Roger Sinha and Helene Blackburn.
Burning Skin, a solo made and performed by Sinha, is an astute brew of
images reflecting his own antecedents -- Armenian mother, Indian father
-- and the racist confrontations thus engendered. His text is taken from
Hanif Krueishi's Rainbow Sign but the dance and the brilliant
theatricality are very much his own.
He cleverly juxtaposes cogent symbols and dance styles from Eastern
and Western cultures. Garbed in flowing robes, he takes tea -- to the
elegant strains of the Blue Danube, synchronising his sipping as if at
some consular high tiffin. The next moment, he is whirling and kicking
in an intricate amalgam of contemporary movements and classical Indian
dance -- a kind of electro-Natyam, where traditional delicate hand
gestures are powered by a pounding modern beat and offset by
freewheeling contemporary footwork.
It's immediately exciting to watch, stumulating to reflect on
afterwards, because of the way Sinha evokes the blistering realities of
racial prejudice.
Helene Blackburn's company, Cas Public, showed two different pieces on
separate nights, one a work in progress. Both radiated a sense of
heightened ritual, a mantra-like use of reiterated motion leading to a
state of ecstatic entrancement that was both powerful and affecting.
On one level it's a meticulous pursuit of movement. Setting up a
phrase, like the on-the-edge rocking step in Bestaire, then letting it
gather unpredictable strengths through repetition, through being shared
by other dancers. But even as this technical exploration acquires its
own momentum, it's creating poetic images that are resonant with echoes
of spirituality, dedication, passion.
In Bestaire it's as if one was peeping into the life of some isolated,
closed religious sect. A group of people clustering together, supporting
one another through tiny shared gestures. These elements are being taken
further in Blackburn's current project, provisionally titled,
Kammermusik. It, too, is resplendent with taut energies, sharp
idiosyncratic steps, and above all a glorious sense of bodies being
speaking vessels for deep-felt beliefs.
No wonder New Moves Across Europe extended its remit across the
Atlantic: Canadian dance really leaves one speechless with admiration.

Music
WITH playing of this sort, and of the Vellinger Quartet's sort a week
ago, chamber music in Britain seems in better shape than is the country
as a whole.
In last night's programme of Beethoven, Schubert, and Frank Bridge,
promoted by the Young Musicians' Trust, nothing was shirked,
undervalued, or left to chance. Bridge's Three Idylls, far from seeming
to belong to some musical backwater of the early 1900s, brimmed with a
poetry which never became wishy-washy, and which showed exactly why the
young Benjamin Britten sought to be Bridge's pupil.
Lovingly articulated, the pieces sounded at times like Elgar with a
twist of something else, and proved that they no more deserved their
neglect than Beethoven's so-called Harp quartet deserved to lag behind
his others in general esteem.
But then -- though the performance did not suggest it -- it is a
treacherous work to play, though filled with rewards for those who can
generate the increasing momentum of the first movement and can cope with
the flurry of the scherzo.
The Brindisi Quartet did so yet held enough in reserve for Schubert's
great C major string quintet, in which they were joined by Charles
Tunnell as second cellist for a performance rich and robust in sonority
but with the plaintive sweetness the music also requires.

The compelling healing potential of chiropractic has taken it out of
the realms of quackery and, as Elizabeth Westcott explains, there is now
no need to take back pain lying down
THIS year back pain will cost the nation more than #3000m in lost
production. Disability due to back pain has increased dramatically over
the past three decades, but the awareness of treatments available has
not. Legions of back pain sufferers will tread the dreary rituals of
visits to their general practitioner, prescriptions of painkillers,
anti-inflammatories, and the unavoidable bed rest, all in the belief
that there is no real cure for back pain.
What they don't realise is that chiropractic, the fastest growing
complementary medical therapy in the UK, could alleviate their symptoms
in the space of a few visits -- without drugs or surgery.
Chiropractors specialise in disorders of the spine, joints, and
muscles. Meaning literally ''done by hand'', chiropractors use
manipulations gently to unlock stiff joints. After one or a number of
treatments proper movement is restored. Chiropractic is generally found
to be a remarkably effective therapy, as one patient, James Smith, can
testify.
Smith was suffering from cervical spondylitis, a common condition
which gradually immobilised his neck over a period of two years. Unlike
many chronic pain sufferers he didn't ignore his problem; he sought help
from his GP and eventually from physiotherapists but nothing eased his
discomfort until he consulted a chiropractor.
''I was in extreme pain,'' he said. ''I couldn't move my neck at all,
it was just impossible. My doctor said there wasn't a cure for my neck.
I wanted to have an X-ray, but my doctor said there wasn't any point.
His exact words were: 'Your neck's knackered.'
''Then I went to see the physiotherapists and I was going for about
three months. They gave me some exercises to do but in the end they gave
me up as a bad job. They said there was nothing they could do for my
neck.''
Feeling desperate, Smith took a friend's advice and visited a
chiropractor.
''It wasn't until then that I found any relief at all. It took a while
-- I was seeing the chiropractor twice a week at first -- but after
about a month I could really feel the difference.''
The improvement in James Smith's case was striking. His ability to
rotate his neck increased from only 10 degrees on his first visit to 65
degrees and the pain disappeared. He wouldn't hesitate to recommend
chiropractic to anyone.
Another patient, Annie Coorey, found chiropractic could alleviate the
pain she was experiencing in her lower back after traditional medicine
failed.
''I had terrible backache while I was pregnant and after my daughter
was born,'' she said. ''Twelve weeks into my pregnancy I had to wear a
brace and after 22 weeks I left work. A friend told me about the
chiropractor so I came to see her, and within a month or so I had total
relief. It was really quite good by the time I got pregnant again. I'm
now pain-free most of the time, but I was really in agony before I came.
''I've recommended chiropractic to my postman, who gets terrible
backache from bending over all the time.''
Other back pain sufferers could experience similar relief if they
didn't adopt a ''wait and see'' approach, according to Glasgow
chiropractor Dr Ian Dingwall.
''Back pain hasn't changed but the disability due to back pain has,''
he said. ''It's very common to get patients who have had back pain for a
long time and have never had their backs examined. It's crazy -- it's
like treating toothache with painkillers for years and never having your
teeth assessed by a dentist.''
Painkillers may reduce pain in the short term but the underlying
problem will not magically vanish. If anything, it will probably worsen,
says Dr Dingwall.
''If a sportsperson with hamstring damage is given painkillers the
pain will go. But without proper rehabilitation once back on the track
there's going to be all sorts of problems.
''People with back pain say 'I'll learn to live with it' because they
don't realise they have any other option.''
* SCOTTISH back pain sufferers don't know what's good for them.
Chiropractic may be the third largest health care profession in the
world (after medicine and dentistry) but few people in Scotland are
aware of chiropractic therapy and what it can offer, according to Dr
Bradon Keil, spokesperson for the Scottish Chiropractic Association.
''Awareness of chiropractic here is very low,'' he said. ''We would be
lucky if one-tenth of those questioned even knew what it was. We've
still got people booking in for their feet to be done. The increasing
number of practitioners is improving matters but there still needs to be
a lot of PR work.''
When Dr Keil first arrived in Scotland four years ago there were only
16 chiropractors. Now there are over 30 and despite the lack of common
knowledge concerning chiropractic, news of their practices spread
swiftly, usually by word of mouth.
Dr Keil predicts a rapid chiropractic expansion in Scotland over the
next decade. ''Scotland has the same population as the state of Victoria
in Australia where they have 700 chiropractors. Another two or three
hundred here wouldn't go astray.
''People with back pain are suffering needlessly. The standard
recommendation is still bed rest, which has been shown to be
detrimental. After two or three days of bed rest there are no more
benefits, and more than that can actually increase the side effects of
back pain.''
Dr Keil referred to the Clinical Standards Advisory Report which
states that traditional medical treatment has failed to halt the
epidemic of back pain and may even have contributed to it.
''There is an epidemic of back pain in the Western world,'' he said.
Elsewhere in the Western world chiropractic is a commonplace therapy
and Britain is finally catching on. It has come a long way since the
sixties, when it was generally deemed to be an ''unscientific cult'' by
the medical establishment. Last year the Chiropractors' Act was passed,
ensuring that only those registered and qualified could use the title
''chiropractor''. This legitimisation is a landmark for the profession
and marks a new openness towards non-established therapies in the UK.
Chiropractic's compelling potential for healing has dragged it from
the realms of quackery and towards mainstream medicine. As it continues
to gain recognition, no doubt Scotland's thousands of back pain
sufferers will benefit from what is proving to be the most convincing
solution to back pain ever.
BACK FACTS

learn to live with
* Sixty million working days are lost each year through back pain
* Back pain is second only to bronchitis as a cause of lost working
days
* Two hundred and thirty thousand people are off work every day with
back pain
* Since 1971 there has been a 230% increase in days lost from work.

A SOCIAL worker who offered to sell information about the children of
the alleged mass murderer, Mrs Rosemary West, was yesterday sacked from
his job.
Mr Errol Brown, 31, was dismissed by Gloucestershire County Council
after a disciplinary hearing in Gloucester.
He was suspended earlier this month after asking the Gloucester
Citizen for around #10,000, claiming he had information about the five
younger children of Mrs West, 41, and her late husband, Frederick, 53.
The newspaper had two meetings with Mr Brown, from the Forest of Dean,
before reporting him to the council.
Mr Brown later said his approach was a stunt for Comic Relief which
had gone wrong. He claimed he intended to give any money to charity.
Miss Anne Marshall, the council's press officer, said after the
hearing that Mr Brown had no knowledge of the children, had never met
them or worked with them, and did not have access to any confidential
records, which were strictly controlled.
She revealed that he had approached the newspaper offering, for the
price of a new car, to tell it where the West children were being looked
after.
Miss Marshall added: ''All those who have worked with this family have
strived to protect the children from publicity in order to help them
build new lives.
''Both the High Court and the Department of Health have complimented
the department on the efforts made to act in the best interests of the
childen and the care we have provided for them.
''Staff involved in this case are dedicated to the well-being of the
chldren.''
Mrs West, of 25 Cromwell Street, Gloucester, has been committed for
trial at Winchester Crown Court in the autumn.
She stands accused of 10 murders, including that of her stepdaughter
Charmaine, eight, and daughter Heather, 16.
Mrs West is also accused on four other charges alleging rape and
indecent assault. These were said to have been carried out jointly with
her husband, who was found hanged in his remand cell in Winsom Green
Prison, Birmingham, on January 1.

MR BLAIR claimed last night that Labour had recaptured the moral high
ground of British politics. He has also put his party ''on alert'' in
anticipation of an early General Election. It is usually a mistake for
politicians to proclaim that the cards they hold are morally superior to
those in the hands of their opponents. In free and liberal societies
political activity aims at reconciling competing claims for scarce
resources, which inevitably means compromise, something seldom allowed
in moral questions. It is rare for political issues to divide opinion
along morally opposing lines: an almost neutral example (in terms of
political partisanship) is the debate about animal rights and welfare,
where people of good intent can legitimately hold quite opposing views,
or views which are complicated rather than simple. What Mr Blair really
means is that Labour may have recaptured the intellectual leadership and
momentum of contemporary British politics after two decades in which
they have been held by the right. Even that would afford room for
vigorous debate since, no doubt, right-wingers would contest it, not
least because Mr Blair has successfully repositioned his party by moving
it rightwards -- hence ''new'' and ''old'' Labour. As for duties and
rights, their connection is an old Tory theme.
Of course, after all the sleaze and scandal which has affected the
Government, there may be a sense in which it is plausible for Labour to
claim the moral high ground. It might still seem overweening to do so:
most of the scandal which has so damaged the Tories is individual rather
than collective, and from its very nature is unlikely to be confined to
one party. Where the ground identified affects national issues, like
health, education, and employment, it is a different matter, but hardly
one that is more certain in moral terms. The main parties do not
disagree too much on these subjects but only in degree, even as far as
funding is concerned. This is not to be sneered at: much of the
stability of the country stems from consensus (though Mrs Thatcher was
wont to deny it), and as long as political competition is for the middle
ground of opinion, too much difference between the parties remains
improbable. The one great area of exception is the constitution, and
there Mr Blair has certainly moved Labour in decisive and radical
directions which, though they are mainly endorsed by the Liberals, are
hotly contested by the Tories. But neither in this movement, nor in the
content of the Labour proposals, is there an indisputable dimension of
moral superiority distinguishing one set of new proposals from those
already operating.
It is a big jump from what are essentially abstract considerations to
electioneering. Mr Blair, who is possessed of remarkable energy, is
engaged in that with his ''alert''. It is as long a game as John Smith
contemplated, for we are two years away from the one unavoidable polling
day. The Tories have many internal problems, and Labour would love to
have them at the hustings sooner rather than later. The Tories need not
hurry all the same. Unless Mr Major decides to go voluntarily -- or the
men in suits are resurrected to talk to him -- he really seems safe for
some time. As for Mr Heseltine, the shadow of John Smith's death must
underline the memory of his own heart attack. Meanwhile the Tory
majority declines as by-elections multiply and commentators recall Mr
Callaghan's problems in 1978 and 79. They might just as easily remember
Mr Wilson's majority of four in 1964.

THERE are many sound reasons why Britain should forget its
once-special relationship with the United States. The Turks, those
aspiring Europeans, have just provided 35,000 of them cleverly disguised
as tourists in battle tanks and despatched, with America's casual
benison, to northern Iraq.
Counterterrorism, so called, is fast becoming ethnic cleansing. The
Turks are ''safeguarding civilians'' with air-strikes against what is
still, without irony, described as a United Nations protection zone.
Meanwhile Britain adopts a ''low-key'' approach for no more noble reason
than that the US wishes it so: that's how very special our relationship
is.
This plot has unfolded in familiar style. A novice Prime Minister with
a shambolic economy and a troublesome minority on her hands has called
the White House to seek permission for a little punitive freelance work.
Bubba Clinton has given Tansu Ciller the nod, presumably because the
US owes Turkey a few favours, and asks only discretion in return.
The EU has complained, of course, and achieved precisely nothing. Ours
is the greater strategic interest and ours will be the problem if the
Kurdistan Workers' Party resumes its terrorist attacks against European
cities. None of that matters to Clinton. America is putting America
first and the real nature of the Nato alliance is laid bare.
Turkey likes to affect astonishment that it was not invited to join
the EU long ago. Little matters such as its treatment of dissidents,
opposition MPs as well as Kurds among them, and worries over the
boisterous style of its security forces when entertaining prisoners, are
treated as quibbles. Turkey has stood by Nato; we should be more
understanding of its ancient traditions.
Funnily enough, EU foreign ministers will be in Ankara today to
discuss how Turkey's impeccable human rights record might be improved
further. Europe has offered a carrot by agreeing to a customs union; the
next step would be an application for full membership.
PLAINLY, Ciller, who has been talking vaguely of democratic reforms,
believed she had made herself clear: it is her regime or the
fundamentalists. Which would the West prefer? Ciller has described this
week's adventure as the biggest military operation ever undertaken by
her country. Certainly it surpasses the 1974 invasion of Cyprus, for
which permission was never sought nor justification offered, but a piece
of near-forgotten history better illustrates why she is wrong, and why
the Turkish mind-set remains antique and dangerous.
In 1915 Turkey had another ethnic problem, this time with its
Armenians. In the midst of the Great War, and with the Allies having
declared war aims threatening to their tottering empire, the Turks
decided to resolve that difficulty by the simple expedient of murdering
in cold blood every Armenian they could lay their hands on.
The slaughter is generally held to be the worst act of pre-meditated
genocide before the Nazis but that is not, for our purposes, the point.
To this day Turkey refuses to make any acknowledgement of what took
place. No-one is still assigning responsibility; no-one is blaming
Ciller or any contemporary politician. But the refusal to confront the
truth is absolute, an irritable expression of a warped national pride
that admits to no error, past or present. Any state capable of such
wilful amnesia hasn't mastered page one of democracy for beginners.
For all that Turkey is, or should be, Europe's problem, not America's,
yet Britain remains incapable of deciding where its loyalties and
interests lie. Do we adhere, puppy-like, to an old fellowship when the
US couldn't care less? Do we side with a power whose newly-dominant,
deeply parochial, and pig-ignorant Republicans have made self-interest
the criterion for foreign policy? Do we continue to pretend that Nato
and the UN are something more than client agencies of the Pentagon?
Or do we just admit to being Europeans? In this, only one fact is
pertinent: the GDP of the Union is now greater than that of either the
US or Japan. Europe's power is a reality yet to be acknowledged, least
of all by European heads of government, but very soon now the tiffs over
Gatt, Hollywood movies, Eastern Europe, visas for Sinn Fein, or Turkish
aggression will become open economic rivalry. America already knows it.
Britain cannot forever look both ways, irrespective of the brawling
among Conservative patriots who interpret sovereignty as perpetual
deference to America. All the evidence suggests that not only is the
special relationship over but that it is, in our circumstances, the last
thing we need. Or should we just go on presuming the Government is
packed with CIA agents of influence?

MARY ELLEN SYNON, the woman dubbed ''The Bonk of England'', has
seemingly got what she wanted, namely the resignation of Rupert
Pennant-Rea, deputy governor of the Bank of England. He will undoubtedly
be feeling very sorry for himself with no job and added strain in his
third marriage to Helen Jay, sister of Peter Jay the BBC's economic
editor.
One of my colleagues, who saw Pennant-Rea in the midst of the
negotiations to save Barings merchant bank, remarked on how tired he was
looking. We assumed this was because of his efforts to save a major City
institution, but perhaps now we know the real reason.
While Pennant-Rea comes out of this episode looking foolish and
irresponsible at best, it is the actions of Synon that I find
despicable. There is something rather cheap and nasty in her recent
conduct. Although she professes to love Pennant-Rea, there is something
premeditated and distasteful in keeping his love letters with their
date-marked envelopes and a photocopy of a cheque he sent her to cover a
flight to America.
The adage ''hell hath no fury'' seems more than appropriate given her
recent disclosures. These include a claim that when she had once
previously threatened to reveal publicly details of their affair, he had
attempted suicide and had climbed on to the railway line at Clapham
Junction in south-west London, before changing his mind.
One is left with a feeling that it serves her right. Much the same can
and has been said about Sandra Hughes, now wife of Robert Hughes who
also recently tendered his resignation, as junior Citizen's Charter
Minister, after admitting an extra-marital affair. At the time they met
and began their affair, Hughes, elected to the Greater London Council in
1980 as Tory member for Croydon Central, was a 28-year-old father,
married for the first time.
These women have been ''the other woman'' and now find the tables have
been turned on them. They are getting a taste of their own medicine,
and, perhaps not surprisingly, do not like it. I am not sure why Synon,
who presumably, given her journalistic career to date, sounds like an
intelligent woman, expected her relationship with Pennant-Rea to be any
different to his previous ones.
Although I do not know (or wish to) the circumstances surrounding the
breakdown of his previous marriages, at the age of 47 he is already on
his third wife. This to me does not signify a particularly committed
nature when it comes to his relationships with women. In any case, from
what I have heard so far of Synon, I would say that Pennant-Rea is well
rid of her.
Still, he can console himself with the fact that he is not alone in
his plight but joins an ever growing list of eminent men who have felt
it necessary to resign because of affairs. Most, but not all, have been
politicians. Two weeks ago Hughes resigned as Citizen's Charter
Minister. Before him, senior defence chief Sir Peter Harding had little
choice but to leave his job when his affair with the then Bienvenida
Sokolow formerly Lady Buck -- wife of Tory MP Sir Antony Buck -- was
revealed last March.
Lady Thatcher's successor as MP for Finchley, Hartley Booth, got no
further than the first rung of the ministerial ladder before he was
forced to resign last February as a junior aide after revelations of his
''innocent'' liaison with House of Commons secretary Emily Barr.
A MONTH earlier Tim Yeo, the Environment Minister, was pushed from
office after admitting fathering a child with Tory councillor Julia
Stent. Shipping Minister Lord Caithness also resigned in January 1994 in
the immediate aftermath of his wife's suicide. The elderly parents of
Lady Caithness later blamed the Earl's relationship with former royal
secretary Jan Fitzalan-Howard for their daughter's depression.
So far Steve Norris, Minister of Transport, has refused to stand down
despite revelations of not just one affair but five, with different
mistresses, in 1993. Some men in the middle years of their life feel the
need to prove their virility and desirability by taking a mistress often
young enough to be their daughter. One thinks of the memorable
''five-times a night'' Ralph Halpern, a former chief executive of the
Burton retail group.
However, in this case there was no such young bimbo. Given her
occupation as a journalist and her age of 44 years, one would have
expected American-born Synon to be a little less naive. What amazes me
is that so many people in supposedly demanding jobs in the public eye
find the time and energy for such potentially dangerous liaisons. What,
with this latest sexual scandal and the recent collapse of Barings
merchant bank, triggered by huge trading losses incurred by Nick Leeson,
who needs to go to the cinema, read Jilly Cooper or Jackie Collins
novels for entertainment when they can just open their newspaper.

IT might be a great place for business and communications, but
Motherwell District also claims to hold a few trump cards when it comes
to choosing a place to live.
The selection of quality housing, in both the public and private
sector, has never been better. Neither has the choice of leisure,
sporting, and entertainment activities.
This pocket of Scotland caters for everyone's taste, whether it is in
outdoor or indoor pursuits, or sitting back to see some of the biggest
names in arts, sports and entertainment. Swimming, rambling, canoeing,
skating, bowling, yachting, sub-aqua, and athletic activities are
available and the magnificent concert hall and theatre complex at the
Civic Centre regularly draws top stars from TV, theatre, and the music
scene.
One of Motherwell District's biggest assets is, of course, the Clyde
Valley: there are few areas more scenic when it comes to leisurely walks
or a country drive. The river also borders the magnificent Strathclyde
Country Park, flowing into its 200-acre artificial loch and providing an
ideal environment for a wide range of water-based activities.
The lake was the venue for the 1986 Commonwealth Games rowing events
and the park features a caravan and camping site, fun park, sandy
beaches, nature reserve, jogging tracks, and picnic and play areas.
As for sporting facilities, the Sir Matt Busby Sports Complex in
Belshill has a 25-metre pool, an outdoor synthetic sports pitch, and a
health suite. A sports hall is also being constructed at the complex.
A new pool being built as an extension to Wishaw Sports Centre, which
was opened in 1982 and is the district's major sporting complex, will
also be 25 metres long. The eight-lane all-weather athletics track there
has been used regularly by international athletes such as Tom McKean and
Yvonne Murray, and the latter continues to use the facility regularly as
an active member of the Motherwell Lucozade Athletics Club.
An outdoor all-weather tennis-court complex is also being built at the
centre.
The council opened a state-of-the-art leisure complex at Shotts in
1990, having introduced the jewel in its crown, the Aquatec, in
Motherwell only a year earlier. This water and ice-based complex
continues to draw visitors from near and far, with the longest
wild-water channel in Scotland, water cannons, a flume, waterfall and
outdoor hot spring among the attractions of its leisure pool.
The other half of the building is given over to a free-form ice rink
complete with laser lights, Alpine trails, and ice cavern. A hi-tech
conditioning gym has also recently been opened.
Chief Executive John Bonomy considers that a district which has a bird
sanctuary only half a mile from its civic centre -- Barons Haugh Nature
Reserve, owned by the RSPB and adjoining Dalzell Country Park -- has to
be something special. ''You don't normally have such wildlife riches so
close to an urban environment,'' he says.
In all there are 3000 acres of parks in Motherwell District and five
golf courses cater for those with a purpose in their walk. Cultural
attractions are frequent at the concert hall and theatre, which houses
art exhibitions as well as performance art, and a purpose-built cultural
centre at Bellshill has facilities for plays, musicals, dance and a
multi-purpose room suitable for exhibitions, seminars and workshops.
An award-winning Arts Service offers a wide range of participative
arts and cultural activities.
The district is also building a #3.7m Heritage Centre in Motherwell
which will feature many innovative displays and exhibitions recording
the area's history from earliest times to the robust days of the iron,
steel and coal industries, and on to modern times. A smaller centre is
also based in Shotts.
Motherwell Football Club offers Premier League action. And all the
leisure, sporting and cultural attractions of Glasgow and Edinburgh are
a short distance away.
It's a central location. That is a large part of its attraction.

PERHAPS I am not alone amongst your readership who skips lightly
through Scotland's Business but the headline above Stewart McIntosh's
article may well be prophetic: Oceans rise up against each other to turn
tide of tenants (March 16).
Even those with the shortest memories among potential developers,
builders, insurers, and tenants viewing the Pacific Quay project in
Glasgow might think again.
The Atlantic Ocean, and the Rivers Clyde and Kelvin, have already
spoiled the equanimity of the infilled dock area on the north bank, and
they may well wonder what will safeguard their properties in the old
southern docks.
The apparently solid blocks of river wharfage have stood for over 100
years but the flimsy Bell's Bridge appears to have revealed that the
waters have continued to erode the hard core behind.
The silt continues to accumulate and elevate the flood tide of sea and
spate of rivers, so what price the computer ''super highways'' of the
future to those edifices on Atlantic Quay?
Whatever the best laid plans of Glasgow's ''movers and shakers'', they
would do well to acknowledge that the land, the rivers, and the oceans
have but one Maker. Man may well make modifications but if these are not
maintained into the future they will soon revert to nature.
You published a letter from Geoffrey Jarvis, subscribed by many
concerned and authoritative persons in our community, advocating a
careful examination of the whole aspect of Glasgow's river frontage. It
is surprising how many assets are already there which could, with viable
and economic adaption, be rescued from dereliction.
Whatever form that authority might take, I would suggest the priority
is to get the river right; and then take a walk around the Govan
Heritage Trail with the excellent guidebook in hand so that late
twentieth-century persons might get the proper perspective of the making
of Glasgow.

IT is a dreadful indication of the degree to which we have become
habituated to cynicism, duplicity, and dishonesty in public life that
when Scotland's leading national newspaper publishes a report detailing
a previous Government's complicity in deliberately causing physical harm
to 22,000 British Servicemen used as human guinea-pigs in experiments
with H-bombs this is relegated to page three (March 20).
This horrendous crime is not even noted on TV or radio, there is no
public outcry, and we all continue to entrust our fate to the
powers-that-be.
Are we expected to believe that those who live by the nuclear gospel
have somehow mended their ways and would never dream of committing such
an atrocity again.?
Or is it the case that we should simply accept the logical fact that
those who support the mass slaughter of innocent civilians as a
permitted means to their desired end cannot be expected to have any
qualms about the lesser crimes of killing soldiers, devastating the
environment, lying to the public, deceiving Parliament, and threatening
the lives of all of us?

BARCLAY McBain's report, Dismay as funding levels confirm education
fears (March 17), makes very depressing reading. The fact that the
majority of academic institutions in Scotland will have substantially
less resources than last year but will have to cope with additional
students underlines the Government's parsimonious attitude towards
education.
The present policy will ensure that students, with ever-increasing
levels of debt, can expect to receive from the academic institutions
even less in terms of teaching and other resources than they did this
year.
The Government's doctrine of cost-effective education is based on the
flawed philosophy that the less each student receives in terms of
resources the more cost-effective the education system is judged to be.
Is this what parents want for their children or what our young people
are entitled to expect from the Scottish education system?

I read Mr Penney's letter with great sadness (March 18). I can excuse
his ignorance of journalistic procedures (I did not choose the headline
for my original letter) but I have to struggle a bit to be gracious in
the face of his hubristic description of me as a poisoner; that seems to
go beyond the bounds of an honest difference of opinion.
Such a pity, too, that his student days were a hard slog; mine were a
joyful confirmation of vocation, but then I was preparing for
ordination, not for a career in the ''business'', whatever he might be
trying to convey by the usage.
Since all we seem to have in common is weariness with each other
(although I am willing to be weary with a brother in Christ), perhaps
this correspondence should end now.
Let's leave things where they are for now and agree to discuss them in
Paradise. Unless God, having consulted Mr Penney, as it appears He
surely will, takes his advice and doesn't let me in!

WE hear of a sudden outbreak of the democratic process in Dunoon where
one of the seats is being contested by no fewer than seven candidates in
the elections for the new shadow-of-their-former-selves councils. By
contrast another Cowal seat for the Argyll and Bute Council is
unopposed.
The SNP has opened the war of the hustings by issuing a ''public
warning'' leaflet about the ''Tory menace'' of voting for candidates who
stand under the label Independent but are actually Conservatives.
This will no doubt be firmly denied by Councillor Scott McClure who is
standing as an Independent despite being on the Tory short-leet of six
last time round for the Argyll and Bute parliamentary seat.
Mr McClure is a publican in Dunoon and given that Raith Rovers have
been elevated almost to cult status in his bar since the Coca-Cola Cup
final it appears that he is not canvassing any Tim vote that may exist
in his ward.
Two Cowal publicans are standing for election this time around, giving
some weight to the opinion held locally that being an elected member is
no hindrance when it comes to licensing matters.
Even better, in Campbeltown we have a candidate standing against the
leader of the council on a platform of ''Legalise cannabis and bring
back hanging''. Great to see that a return to one-tier local government
has maintained the tradition of multi-tiered local politics.
The Name Game
EDINBURGH Healthcare NHS Trust's ''Vasectomy Secretary'' is one Joan
Dix. The Green Party candidate in the election for the Battlefield ward
of the Glasgow City Council is a Brian Chislett, who is a joiner to
trade.
Siberian insult
WE hear from another Diary foreign correspondent, Howard Tindall. The
last time we heard from Howard, a former economist with the Bank of
Scotland, was when he was in Ulan Bator complaining about the food at a
Burns Supper. (If you must have the full details, get a back number of
The Herald for March 31 last year.)
Howard is now working in a bank in Kazakhstan, assisting the former
Soviet colony in its transition to a free-market economy. To help him
achieve this, he has been issued with one of these personal hand-held
computer notebooks.
He was drafting a letter home when the spellcheck queried his
reference to Glasgow. It suggested ''Gulag'' as an alternative.
Concerned that his PC was suggesting that there was a touch of the Ivan
Denisovich about Glasgow's post-war housing schemes, he looked up
Edinburgh. And drew a blank, not even an insult.
If the cap fits
THE Labour Party is on tour with an event called the Rambling Rose
Roadshow. As part of the hype and glitz, representatives of the People's
Party will be wearing baseball caps (made in the People's Republic of
China) adorned with roses. The baseball cap is an article of clothing
which must have fond memories for those of a Labour persuasion: notable
previous wearers include Robert Maxwell and Arthur Scargill.
Cruise control
A CONFERENCE on ''Issues and Crisis Management'' in London next month
will be addressed by a chap from Cunard Line, the people who had a bit
of a problem recently with their boat, the QE2.
The talk is entitled ''If you're the Queen and your slip shows, you've
had it!'' We are sure it will be a paradigmatic exposition on crisis
management. Even if the man delivering it, Cunard's PR supremo, rejoices
in the unconvincing name of Eric Flounders.
Well-travelled
A NICE bit of non-synchronous film and commentary from the BBC news
during HRH's visit to South Africa. We see the royal yacht Britannia
steaming into harbour. The reporter is observing what a fine old ship
she is. Unfortunately by the time we get to the words: ''Over one
million miles on the clock and still in service'' the cameras were
giving us a close-up of the Queen Herself.
By the left
A Diary correspondent, recently returned from France, tells us that
Jil, the French underwear company, has just launched the first-ever
range of left-handed Y-fronts. ''Forget scissors, potato-peelers and the
like,'' enthused one reviewer, ''these have to be the greatest boon to
the male southpaw yet.''
We admit to being confused, and somewhat alarmed, by the stuff about
scissors and potato-peelers but were pleased to be told it was nothing
to do with any handling of the contents of the Y-fronts. Merely a
reference to other artefacts which have been redesigned to help the
corrie-fisted.

Timely reminders of knowing not the hoor
EXAMPLES continue to surface of colourful demotic language on the
theme of passage of time. Bill Maclaughlan of Kilburnie remembers his
granny saying: ''Eight o'clock and no' a heid looked or a po' timmed.''
''Look at ma hair -- it's like a hoor's handbag,'' was another of her

George MacDougall of Sandyhills recalls: ''Eight o'clock and no' a
dish washed or a heid looked.'' A chap of Leith descent heard at his
granny's knee: ''Eleven o'clock, not a piss-pot emptied, not a hoor
dressed, and the French fleet in port.''
Rhona J Young of Old Kilpatrick contributes a farming version from
Stirlingshire where the men would be greeted of a Monday morning with:
''Hash on, boys. The day's but a blink and the rain's at Buchlyvie. The
day after the morn's Wednesday and no' a stroke o' work done yet.''
Jean Taylor of Brookfield, Johnstone brings the hale thing up to date
with: ''It's 9.30am and not a fax received or a call on my mobile

SIR Hector Monro asserted in the Commons that it is not the ownership
of land that matters but how it is managed (March 16).
While it is entirely predictable that he should try to defend the
privileges of the landed minority, this is still an enigmatic statement
from a Minister whose Government has publicly renounced responsibility
for land management through its espousal of the ''voluntary principle'',
despite severe condemnation of upland land-use practices in recent
publications by its own agency, Scottish Natural Heritage.
By contrast, what clear vision was shown at the same debate by Calum
MacDonald in his call for a tax on land values. In capturing the full
annual economic rent for the Exchequer this would indeed destroy the
speculative value of land by cancelling out the financial advantage of
mere ownership.
The landowner, as distinct from the land-user, is a purely negative
element of the economic equation as he provides nothing, yet demands
payment for the use of what is already there. His status as such
deserves no protection.
How appropriate that the demand for land value taxation should come
from the MP for the Western Isles where, far removed from Westminster,
communities have retained an awareness of their relationship with the
land and the way this has been distorted by the system of landlordism
imposed on them from outside.
Although last week's debate was about the future of wild land, it is
to be hoped that Calum MacDonald's parliamentary colleagues will
recognise the significance of land value taxation applied universally to
all land and the admirable way it would fit into the ideology of the
new-look Labour Party.
With assessment based on annual market rental values excluding
buildings and other improvements, and taking into account planning and
environmental restrictions on development, it would automatically
penalise the owners of idle or under-used land and so stimulate optimum
permitted land-use, rural or urban.
Crucially, as an alternative rather than additional source of revenue
to the Exchequer, land value taxation would provide the Government with
the means to free the economy from the stifling effect of penal taxation
on production and consumption.
Unpopular and counter-productive taxes such as income tax and VAT
could be slashed to a degree undreamed of by politicans blinkered by
conventional economic dogma.
While Sir Hector Monro may not choose to admit that the issue of
land-use is inseparable from that of landownership, the ignominious end
to the Government he represents is surely now in sight.
Tomorrow's politicians must acknowledge that land monopoly is at the
root of social injustice and economic security, and must be prepared to
tackle the issue head on.

MORE than 2000 workers yesterday experienced the real meaning of the
dearth of the economic feelgood factor identified by Chancellor Kenneth
Clarke when they were told they were to lose their jobs.
Midland Bank announced that 1745 jobs would go as part of a shake-up
aimed at focusing on ''communuity banking''; 320 pie-factory jobs are to
go in Stoke-on-Trent; Dalepak Foods is axing 75 jobs at its Hull
factory; and 50 textile jobs are to be lost in Dundee.
The jobs haemorrhage was compounded last night when one of Britain's
richest families -- the Vesteys -- saw Dewhurst, their main UK food
trading company, fall into administrative receivership, putting
thousands of jobs at risk. To complete the economic gloom, the
Government is planning to privatise engineering work at its GCHQ
communications centre, threatening 400 jobs.
The Midland Bank, part of the huge HSBC group, said most of its
regional business banking centres were to be integrated into branches.
It would be moving a number of senior managers with increased
authority into its branch network.
''These changes will result in the loss of 1745 jobs across the
country. However, where possible, the job losses will be achieved
through natural staff turnover, early retirement, redeployment, and
voluntnary redundancy.''
The bank has a small presence in Scotland, with offices in Glasgow,
Edinburgh, and Aberdeen. A spokesman said the number of job losses there
would be ''small if any''.
The Banking, Insurance, and Finance union claimed there would be more
than 2000 job losses as part of two separate job shedding programmes.
The union, which fears there will be a number of compulsory
redundancies, attacked the Midland for the scale of the cutback so soon
after the bank made profits of #905m.
Bifu said the number of jobs lost or at immediate risk in the finance
industry over the past five years had risen to 150,000. A total of
115,000 jobs have been axed and a further 35,000 are at risk this year,
according to a union analysis.
The number of jobs lost in banking fell from 17,500 in 1993 to 14,000
last year. However, a further 10,000 banking jobs have been targeted
this year and workers at building societies are threatened with
redundancy because of mergers.
''There is no feelgood factor in finance in spite of bumper profits,''
said Bifu's deputy general secretary, Mr Ed Sweeney.
In Dundee, two factories manufacturing man-made fibres have been the
subject of a management buy-out. The 50 redundancies are being made as
part of a restructuring plan by the new owners.
The factories, previously owned by the Sidlaw Group plc, will now
operate as New South Mills Ltd. About 270 workers were employed at the
two face-yarn operations, which produced man-made fibres mainly used for
carpets.
Mr Graham Scott, managing director of New South Mills Ltd, said: ''The
market has been very low for the past year. This is restructuring the
operation to what the market forces are now.''
Mr Colin Coupar, district secretary of the Transport and General
Workers' union, said: ''I will be negotiating the options and I think we
will be able to reduce the numbers involved.''
Trentham Bakeries, in Stoke-on-Trent, will close at the end of August.
The company, owned by the Northern Foods group, blamed the decision on a
shortage of demand for its pies.
The jobs going at Dalepak Foods in Hull are due to the transfer of
production of Ross meat products to its plant at Northallerton, North
Yorkshire.
At GCHQ, a spokesman said it was impossible to say how many
engineering jobs would be lost under the privatisation exercise. The
centre blamed falling workload for the decision but the Government has
been keen to cut back its Civil Service budget.

CAITHNESS Glass is to end manufacturing in Oban after 25 years.
Four jobs will be lost when the company, which produces paperweights
and other glass products, closes its glass-blowing operations at the end
of September.
Mr David Maxwell, the firm's manufacturing director, said Caithness
Glass would retain its retail shop in Oban's waterfront development.
''We have got to become more efficient and we will be consolidating
all our production in Wick and Perth.''
Mr Maxwell said only two employees would lose their jobs. ''The two
glass makers have been offered positions in Wick or Perth.''
Mr David Webster, president of Oban Chamber of Commerce, said
manufacturing had been stopped because it was no longer necessary to
pull in tourists.
''When the company were at Lochavuillin Industrial Estate, they needed
manufacturing to get people to visit the shop.
''They have recently moved to the waterfront development and don't
need glass making to attract people, so they are just ditching it.''
Mr Webster said the firm's decision also would hit the viability of
the recently-opened waterfront development.
''The exhibition centre has been closed down and the restaurant. All
that will be left when the glassworks close is a wool shop and a glass
shop.''

only five minutes away from the Eurocentral development is another major
success story in the Strathclyde Business Park. Extending to 155 acres,
this is a prestigious and strategic location for companies of all sizes,
from start-up to multinationals.
The park has already attracted big names such as the Mercury
Communications' Scottish headquarters, William Grant Distillers, and the
LDA which has its headquarters there.
The total investment in development has already exceeded #110m and
part of its success story is the 26 advance factory units in the
integrated Birchwood Courtyards, a high-specification two-phase
industrial environment which meant a #4.4m investment for Motherwell
District Council.
These units offer between 2000 and 5000 sq ft and their success -- all
the units are now fully let -- means a third phase of the project is to
start soon.
The business park has already attracted more than 700 jobs and is a
joint development among the LDA, Morrison Developments Ltd, and H F
Developments Ltd.
LDA Chief Executive Archie Bethel describes it as, ''an excellent
example of private and public sector working together to achieve further
economic regeneration in Lanarkshire.''
And Motherwell District contains about 322 acres of prime development
land which enjoy Enterprise Zone status. That, of course, means a rates
holiday which extends to February 2003, tax incentives designed to
reduce development costs, and simplified planning procedures.
Motherwell has four such sites, all easily adapted for any type of
commercial and industrial development. They are at Newhouse West (owned
by Scottish Enterprise/Rail Link Scotland Ltd), Tannochside (owned by
Scottish Enterprise/ Motherwell District Council), Excelsior Park (owned
by the council) and Airbles Road, Motherwell (owned by Lanarkshire
Development Agency).
Newhouse West extends to 195 acres at Mossend and enjoys close
proximity to the M8 and the Eurocentral development. It is seen as ideal
for distribution and manufacturing companies. Tannochside is
particularly suited to distribution operations and has already met with
significant success, and Airbles Road is scheduled for quality office
and business units.
Excelsior Park at Wishaw has already got off to a good start with
three companies in the process of moving into its first phase, a
self-contained section on its eastern corner called East Yett. Then
there came news in the middle of this month that a second development
had been approved and was going to be carried out by Micklegate Special
Projects of Leeds, covering 3.3 acres and consisting of nine units.
In all, there is a potential in these four Enterprise Zone sites for
about 8000 new jobs and the Industrial Development and Estates
Department of Motherwell District Council is in the middle of a
concerted campaign to make the most of the opportunities they offer.
Says Councillor Harry McGuigan, chairman of the Economic Development
Committee: ''Security for the future is fundamental if our communities
are to be caring and productive. The District Council is committed to
retaining existing jobs within the district and to construct a new
economic base. The Enterprise Zone developments are part of that
effort.''

TRAMP, tramp, tramp, the boys are marching . . .
It is hard enough fighting elections on my own behalf but with the lad
Michael also standing for a seat in the new unitary authorities,
kick-off April 6, my old plates of meat are taking a hammering. On
Tuesday night we were bowling along pretty well, had resisted two offers
of tea and one of something stronger -- by his casting vote -- when we
reached a large house in leafy Marchmont.
I rang the doorbell, noting the two cars in the ample driveway, and an
overweight, middle-aged man appeared. Before either of us could say
''vote for us, guv'', he went into orbit.
''You're selling something,'' he roared. My son shook his head. ''A
political party -- even worse,'' shouted the oaf and slammed the door in
our faces.
Michael, who is a gentler soul than I am, dissuaded me from stamping
out through his flower beds or indeed re-ringing the bell to tell this
creature what I thought of him. For there is absolutely no excuse for
rudeness of that sort and particularly towards those who, unlike the
majority of the electorate, actually take part in the local democratic
exercise.
In the next couple of weeks you may receive a call from a candidate.
From whatever party they come, they deserve civility. Without them, how
would councils operate? Fortunately such boorish behaviour is extremely
rare. If I had accepted all the soft drinks I have been offered my
bladder would have packed up by now; if all the hard drinks had gone
down so would my liver. Most people are charming and hospitable.
I have not managed, so far this time, to intrude accidentally on a
house lingerie party. ''Oh, yes, do come in, I think the ladies will be
thrilled to see a man.'' Michael lives in hope.
Nor have I had one of the more confusing interludes. At a General
Election I was canvassing for Malcolm Rifkind and told an elderly lady
that the Minister was counting on her support. She showed me into a
sitting room full of pensioners, all taking tea.
''We are very fortunate today,'' announced the host, ''to have with us
the Rev Rifkind who is to give us a report.''
On my own patch this time, I am accompanied as ever by the Old Doc,
agent extraordinaire, his arthritic knees giving constant cause for
complaint. ''I hope you have a wheelchair in that car boot,'' he
growled.
''No,'' I replied, ''there's a set of castors being delivered on
Thursday and I will have you roped behind me.'' Wouldn't be nearly as
much fun without him.
Actually I do enjoy myself at elections, whatever the political
climate. In Edinburgh, all the pundits tell us it is a one-horse race.
According to them, and the comrades themselves, the Labour Party is
going to skite home.
In a kind of mini-Sheffield rally, an early Ally McLeod sort of
celebration, the socialists have not only declared themselves the
winners, they have even chosen the people who will fill the main jobs in
the new authority. Eric will be LP, Keith will be leader, David will be
transportation boss, the list is quite long.
What is clear is that, should this scenario come to pass, the current
Labour members on Edinburgh District Council will be fried and filleted
by their counterparts on Lothian region. So long, suckers.
Makes you wonder why we are having an election at all. Still, as the
last big contest showed us, sometimes the favourites fall.
Of one thing I am certain, the Labour Party will win nothing on
grounds of policy; for in many fields it has none.
I bechanced to hear the shadow education secretary, David Blunkett, on
Radio 4 on Wednesday morning. He was asked, extremely politely, this is
not a member of the Government we are interviewing, to say whether
Labour would force schools which have opted out to return to local
authority control.
''That policy will be ready in the summer,'' he declared. There are
local elections in Scotland in April and in England and Wales in May yet
a major policy plank in education will be ready in the summer? Ask again
then.
Surely we can assume, however, said the man with the mike, that Labour
intends to spend more on education? ''Money will be spent in a wiser
fashion.'' Is that a ''yes'' or a ''no''? I have a question myself,
which has a direct bearing on events in Edinburgh, which I should like
to pose to Shadow Secretary of State Mr George Robertson. No, it is not
the one the Nats asked you, George.
Could you possibly inform the thousands of Edinburgh parents who have
children in non-state schools what is to happen to these establishments
should Labour win a General Election?
Specifically may they know (1) whether the assisted places scheme will
be scrapped and (2) whether there will be any change in the schools'
charitable status? I will pursue the postman until the reply arrives.
By the way, I had a most enjoyable afternoon talking at and with the
400 good souls who turned up for the Conversation Pieces series at
Glasgow Royal Concert Hall on Tuesday. ''It's a great pleasure for me to
be here in Glasgow, or, as the Chancellor of the Exchequer might put it,
Aberdeen,'' I told them, and we had a grand crack.
A lady stood up at the end and suggested I should be the candidate for
Sir Nicky's old seat. Madam, I may appear not too bright but . . .
Back to the hustings.
''Open that box.
''Put in the mail.
''Another two weeks, and we win or fail!''
Tramp, tramp, tramp.

THE Diary about the Rev Donald John Macaskill brought to mind an
occasion when I worshipped in the Free Presbyterian Church in Uig,
Lewis, while visiting relatives who were members of his congregation
(March 21).
My limited Gaelic was not up to appreciating the finer points of his
45-minute sermon. However, I need not have worried. At the end of the
sermon he announced that as there was a visitor present he would just go
over the main points again in English -- and proceeded to do so for the
next half-hour.
I sensed that not everyone appreciated this courtesy. My hosts did not
encourage me to attend the evening service.

I HAVE watched with considerable interest the machinations of the
various environmental groups who are protesting about the M77 and its
impact on the environment. What has been forgotten is that due to the
lack of the M77 the level of traffic pouring through Cardonald and
Penilee is totally outrageous and seriously impinging on the
environmental quality of life of the people of Cardonald and adjacent
areas.
It is all very well for environmentalists to hammer steel nails into
trees and protest about this, that, and the other when it is affecting
the environment at one end of the area. What has been forgotten, and I
speak for the people of Cardonald, is that people on the through-road
from Crookston Road to Sandwood Road have suffered for years as a result
of the massive traffic input flowing through the area.
Similar problems exist at Berryknowes Road where people use the tunnel
to reach the motorway as there is no alternative such as the M77.
I would ask for a balanced view to be taken of the construction of the
motorway and for critics not to be bogged down on the issue of what the
impact will be on certain areas.
As the situation stands just now areas like Shawlands, Cardonald,
Crookston, Hillington, and Penilee are affected and those who care for
the environment should recognise that it is essential that we get
traffic out of residental areas and on to the motorways to improve the
quality of life of those who live immediately adjacent to roads such as
Crookston Road and Berryknowes Road.
I assure those environmentalists who say they care that there are
thousands of people living now in a situation where heavy traffic is
impinging greatly on their quality of life.

BRUCE McKain's article, Judge challenged over admissibility (March
17), once again highlights the grey area of seeking truth and justice
versus rules and regulations.
It assumes a trial is always conducted to perfection with no margin
for error. It does not allow for incompetence, malpractice, or
complacency.
It should be basic -- if evidence is produced, whether it was
available or not at a trial, that throws new light on a conviction why
on earth should it not be heard?
It must be dreadful for an innocent person knowing there is evidence
that could clear him but is considered inadmissible because of wording.
Parliament surely never legislated to allow this to happen.

PEANUTS are taboo for 10-year-old Angela Rennie from Dumfries. She is
allergic to them, and both her parents and school keep a supply of
adrenaline injections handy in case she should accidentally eat some.
A year ago, her parents, Josephine and Bill Rennie, thought they were
the only family in Scotland to have a child suffering from peanut
allergy.
Today, they realise they are one of at least 100, possibly more, in
Scotland.
As Co-ordinator of the Anaphylaxis Campaign for Scotland (South),
Josephine says the aims of the campaign include better recognition of
the condition, better labelling of all foods, educating the public about
life-threatening food allergies and giving comfort and support to other
parents.
She still recalls vividly the occasion seven years ago when Angela
nearly died from an allergic reaction to peanuts:
''We were at a local social function and there was a buffet. Suddenly,
our eldest daughter, Clare, came rushing up, shouting: 'Come quickly,
Angela is choking!' We couldn't see anything in her mouth, yet she was
getting worse.
''We grabbed her, jumped into a car and rushed to our local casualty
department. The doctor said we were just in time. She almost died. They
kept her in for a few days and discovered she's allergic to peanuts.
''At first I thought: 'Oh, that's alright. It's only peanuts. We can
easily avoid them.' I was afraid it might have been something serious,
like cystic fibrosis. Little did I know then how potentially lethal the
condition could be.''

Central), or Barbara Neely on 01343 548595 (Scotland North).

It surprises most of us to learn that the humble peanut can be
dangerous. Yet, as ANN SHAW reports, there are thousands of people to
whom avoiding it is a matter of life or death
THE sudden death of 20-year-old Jennifer Mott, after eating a
strawberry gateau decorated with nuts, has led her mother, Anne Mott, to
join one of Britain's youngest charities, the year-old Anaphylaxis
Campaign to highlight the dangers in peanuts. She was among 120 parents
who gathered in Stirling last Sunday for the launch of the Scottish
branch of the campaign. Such is the interest that people had travelled
from as far away as Elgin and the Borders.
Anne recalls the death of her daughter, who worked with Grampian
Police: ''It happened at work. Shortly after eating the gateau, she
complained about her lips feeling itchy, and she went outside for some
fresh air. Within an hour and a quarter she was dead. She was taken to
hospital but it was too late.''
Jennifer suffered from asthma, and, as a child, she once had an
allergic reaction after eating peanuts. Anne has since learned that some
bakers, to cut costs, put flaky peanuts instead of almonds on their
commercial cakes. ''Maybe this is what happened. I've no way of finding
out.''
So far, there are more than 100 members of the Scottish campaign and a
further 1800 in England, where the campaign was launched a year ago by
David Reading, of Hampshire, whose daughter Sarah died after eating a
crushed peanut.
So how common is this allergy? ''That's the problem. We don't know,''
says Dr Evelyn Kirkwood, an allergy specialist at the Western General,
Glasgow, who gave the keynote lecture for the launch last Sunday.
''My advice to parents is to take peanut allergy very seriously. It is
potentially lethal. If you think your child is in the least bit
allergic, go to your GP.''
Once diagnosed, either through skin or blood tests, the condition can
be controlled by total avoidance of peanuts. If a child should
accidentally eat peanuts, the treatment is an immediate injection of
adrenalin.
If the child is old enough, often he or she will be trained, like
diabetic children, to self-administer injections. The usual practice is
for parents and schools to keep a supply of adrenalin injections.
It's not known how many people have died as a result of eating
peanuts, though anecdotal evidence in the media suggests that it may not
be as rare as had been supposed.
Because of the paucity of medical data, there is very little in the
way of statistical evidence. The International Classification of
Diseases has no code for food anaphylaxis -- sudden death through food
allergies.
It is suspected that such deaths may be recorded inappropriately as a
heart attack, asthma attack, or even sudden infant death syndrome. As
one doctor explained: ''If a person is brought into casualty department
and promptly dies, it may be put down to cardiac arrest. Until now
nobody thought to ask whether he or she might have been allergic to
peanuts.''
Is there not a risk that, with all the media attention on peanuts,
parents may panic? ''No,'' says Dr Kirkwood. ''This is a rare but
potentially dangerous condition. Until we know more about it, parents
have every right to be concerned.'' What is known is that children whose
immune deficiency system is impaired are more likely to suffer from
asthma, hay fever, and eczema and in turn are more likely to be at risk
of peanut allergy. Unlike other allergies, children do not grow out of a
peanut allergy.
Nobody knows why the number of people suffering from asthma and other
related conditions has increased substantially during the past 20-30
years. The finger has been pointed at several culprits, ranging from
environmental pollution, to central heating, dust mite, and food
additives, but without conclusive proof.
Dr Charles McSharry, an immunologist at the Western General Hospital,
Glasgow, suspects that the real cause may be something that has not yet
been identified. ''It's not outdoor pollution. The air is cleaner today
than it was a 100 years ago. Yet asthma is on the increase in the
Highlands, even on the Isle of Skye.''
One of the concerns of parents at Sunday's launch meeting is that the
condition is not as rare as doctors claim. Anne Brown, a nurse from
Stonehaven, has a seven-year-old son who is a sufferer. There are three
other children in his primary school who are also allergic to peanuts,
and the teachers keep a supply of adrenalin injections for emergencies.
An allergic reaction can occur within minutes of taking peanuts or up
to two hours later. The faster the reaction, the more potentially
dangerous the situation. The signs include swelling, itching of lips,
nausea, pain, tingling, overwhelming sense of fear, swollen throat,
fainting, and stomach pains. The worst thing you can do if you feel an
attack coming on is to go to the toilet. You could die alone before
anybody recognises the situation.
So who is at risk? Those who are already known to suffer from asthma
attacks, eczema, hay fever, or those with a family history of allergy.
It affects mostly children, though some adults suffer, too.
Dr Kirkwood advises: ''Listen to your body and do what it tells you.
If certain foods trigger an attack then avoid them in future. Carry
appropriate medication.''
The real danger is in the hidden peanuts in processed foods, something
that is high on the campaign agenda. Often these foods contain extracts
of peanuts or peanut oil. One of the aims of the campaign is to get all
food manufacturers to list in detail what their foods contain.
Even a Yorkie chocolate bar may contain traces of nut.
Chocolate-coated raisins may have been produced by machinery that
earlier was used to coat peanuts and there may be sufficient residue
left to trigger an attack.
Unlike hay fever, or some other allergic reactions, the danger with
peanut allergy is the speed of the reaction and its potential to kill.
This was certainly news to Sharon McIllwraith, from Dumbarton, who
attended Sunday's meeting. She's glad she did. Her daughter, Corinna,
suffered an allergic reaction when she was three years old, after eating
a peanut-butter sandwich.
''Her whole body was covered in a rash and she had a high temperature.
I dealt with it myself but next time I went to the doctor I mentioned it
to him. All he said was: 'Don't let her eat peanuts.' I had no idea
until today how potentially lethal the situation can be. I'm going back
to him to get her tested so that I can have proper medication. I'm
extremely glad I came to this meeting. It's been very useful.''
Meanwhile, there are two allergy clinics in Scotland, one in Edinburgh
and the other in Glasgow, and research is going on at Southampton
University. In May, all GPs' surgeries will be circulated with a leaflet
informing them about the potential dangers of peanut allergies.

<TEXT>
A CHEESEMAKER claimed yesterday he was denied natural justice when a
decision was taken to condemn batches of his gourmet product, which is
reputed to be enjoyed by the Queen.
Mr Humphrey Errington has asked a judge at the Court of Session in
Edinburgh to overturn the decision condemning 44 batches of his cheese
which a Justice of the Peace ruled was potentially hazardous to public
health and unfit for human consumption.
Mr Errington produces a blue-veined, semi-hard sheep's cheese, Lanark
Blue, made from unpasteurised milk. It has been at the forefront of
re-establishing traditional cheesemaking in Scotland. However,
Clydesdale District Council and the JP decided the 44 batches, worth
about #27,000, should be condemned as it failed to comply with food
safety requirements.
Mr Errington, of Walston Braehead, Ogscastle, by Carnwarth,
Lanarkshire, fears the decision could jeopardise his business, which
employs seven people. Other independent cheesemakers have expressed
concern about the effect the case could have on their industry.
Samples of Lanark Blue were discovered to contain listeria bacteria,
some strains of which can cause the illness listeriosis: Mr Errington
said 63,000 portions of Lanark Blue have been sold without one case of
listeriosis being reported.
The council took the issue before JP Elizabeth Wilson, who decided on
March 3 that 44 batches failed to comply with food safety requirements
and ordered its destruction.
Mr Errington then won an interim interdict at the Court of Session
preventing the destruction of the cheese pending a hearing of his
judicial review of the justice's decision.
His counsel, Mr Michael Jones QC, told the court yesterday that Mrs
Wilson refused to allow cross-examination of witnesses called before her
and had given no reasons for her decision.
He argued that the JP had reached her decision without regard to the
principles of natural justice and it should be set aside.
Mr Colin Sutherland, QC, for the local authority, said the relevant
food safety legislation had been enacted following a series of food
scares. It was envisaged the hearing before a JP or a sheriff would not
involve lengthy inquiry or cross-examination, he argued.
The hearing continues.

BREATHING new life into Motherwell District is a story of partnership,
and it is a tale which seems to enter a new chapter every other month.
The most obvious example is the Motherwell Partnership itself, which
brings together organisations such as the District Council, the LDA,
Scottish Homes, Strathclyde Regional Council, British Steel (Industry)
Ltd, and the Motherwell Enterprise Development Company (Medco).
This body makes a real contribution to the regeneration process
through its organised efforts to make the best collective use of
financial resources and professional expertise.
''People often talk about partnership between the public and private
sectors and among authorities and the various agencies when the reality
is that some of the partners are still pulling against each other,''
says Jim Hope, executive director of Medco.
''In this district, the partners really do work hand in hand. I have
seen some remarkable achievements here.''
At the Strathclyde Business Park Scottish headquarters of British
Steel (Industry), regional director John Fairlie has a similar story.
''In years to come, people will come here to make case studies of
partnership in action,'' he says.
It seems fitting that BS(I) should play a significant part in helping
an area so badly hit by the disappearance of the steel industry. The
initiative was set up in 1975, offering managed workspace and financial
help to small and medium-sized businesses.
It specialises in making loans, share capital, or a combination of
both available to companies which have the normal difficulties in
raising finance particularly what tends to be seen as risk capital from
the usual sources.
John Fairlie moved his headquarters team in 1994 to BS(I)'s new
Grovewood Business Centre at the Strathclyde Business Park in Bellshill.
The #3.5m centre is a high-quality complex of 34 industrial units and
a central office block offering 16 units suitable for anything from
start-up companies to reasonably-sized business concerns.
All the offices are fully let and occupants have access to fax, colour
photocopying facilities, and other communal features -- all welcome
features for small concerns.
The industrial units in the surrounding ''courtyard'' are causing some
interest and already nine of them are let despite having been opened
only in September of last year. John Fairlie is certain that all 34 will
be let within 12 months.
When fully occupied Grovewood will have generated about 400 jobs.
Already 19 companies are there, 99 jobs have been created, and there are
instances of companies being attracted there as opposed to other sites
outside the district.
John Fairlie also places importance on the Youth Enterprise Centre
based in the old Dalzell High School annexe in Motherwell. Here BS(I)
combined with the District Council, Strathclyde Regional Council, and
the Lanarkshire Development Agency to effect a #2m refurbishment, helped
by European Regional Development Funding.
The centre is now about to open its doors to young people wishing to
''have a go'' at start-ups. It occupies about a third of the refurbished
building -- the rest is to be let to other concerns by Strathclyde
Region -- and young entrepreneurs will be offered up to two years of
highly discounted rent, along with professional support in the areas of
training, computers, and advice.
BS(I) has funded it for three years and it is being run by Motherwell
Youth Enterprise Centre Ltd, with its own board of directors and
charitable status.
BS(I) is involved in a variety of other joint initiatives with the
LDA, Motherwell District Council, Strathclyde Regional Council, and
Medco.
Over at Medco's Brandon Street headquarters executive director Jim
Hope has a clear concept of its role in economic development.
Its slogan, For Business And The Community, survives from its origins
as Motherwell Enterprise Trust and continues to reflect a wide-ranging
programme of activities and schemes designed to help companies establish
and consolidate in the district.
This is done through grants, loans, business start-up advice, and a
variety of schemes designed to smooth the path in the way of computer
training, graduate placement, information technology programmes, and
grants for training and employment.
Jim Hope's set-up runs the Prince's Scottish Youth Business Trust for
the whole of Lanarkshire, and the New Business Start-up Programme for
the LDA under which about 80 companies receive grant aid each year.
It also offers workspace and use of a computer to start-ups qualifying
for priority assistance, and runs the Scottish Co-operative Development
Scheme and the Livewire Award Scheme, all designed to help companies
develop.
Medco's 22-strong team paid more than 1600 visits to Motherwell
companies last year, 750 of them in connection with business
development. Most of the other visits were in connection with grant
schemes for start-ups, and these efforts alone found jobs for 340
unemployed.
The last word on the pulling-together theme goes to Councillor Harry
McGuigan, chairman of the Motherwell Partnership, who sees the body as
''crucial'' to progress in the district.
''The Partnership share a vision for Motherwell District for the new
millennium.''

MOTHERWELL District is a dream location for any company to which
communications and distribution are of any importance.
At the heart of Scotland's motorway system and with fast access to
local, national and international markets, it is within easy reach of
both Edinburgh and Glasgow (about 45 and 20 minutes' drive
respectively).
It offers business locations which have direct access to the M8, M73
and M74, bringing about 70% of Scotland's population within an hour's
travelling time.
That means easy and uncomplicated access to 3,000,000 consumers to
north, south, east and west.
Motherwell is only four-and-a-half hours from London, thanks to the
main electrified Glasgow-London route, the Eurocentral Scotland Freight
Terminal at Mossend provides direct access to the rapidly growing
markets on the Continent, and Glasgow and Edinburgh airports are both
about 30 minutes away, in opposite directions on the M8.
Europe and its 320 million consumers have simply never been closer and
the accessibility of air links makes the world their oyster for a
significant number of companies based in the district. Even Prestwick
Airport is only about an hour's drive away, and it boasts faster airport
clearance than any of its UK rivals.
Companies which have selected Motherwell District as the ideal
distribution centre include Safeway (who built Europe's biggest
warehouse facility), TNT Group and Royal Mail Parcels (both at Righead
Industrial Estate), Frigoscandia, and Geest UK. And earlier this month
it was announced that the Royal Mail was at an advanced stage of
negotiations with the district council for the establishment of a
Scottish Distribution Centre at Excelsior Park, Wishaw.
Those with manufacturing bases include Levi Strauss (UK) Ltd,
Motherwell Bridge Holdings, Anderson Group Ltd, Terex Equipment Ltd,
Cummin's Engine Co Ltd, Daiwa Sports Ltd, and award-winning export
engineers Calcarb Ltd.
It is important that suitable shopping facilities are available to all
who work at such companies, whether they live in the district or not,
and both the public and private sector have invested heavily in
Motherwell, Wishaw and Bellshill town centres in recent years, with
#33.9m spent in the period from 1977-91.
Some significant further investment is planned. Motherwell and Wishaw
town centres are expected to benefit from further private-sector
expenditure and #3.7m of public-sector expenditure.

ONE of the biggest boosts to Motherwell District recently has been the
Eurocentral freight terminal, now in operation at Mossend with five
trains already leaving daily for various points in Europe.
It is Scotland's passport to 320 million consumers on the Continent.
The terminal was built at a cost of #8.6m by the Lanarkshire
Development Agency, which handed it over to Railfreight Distribution to
run, then embarked on three other imaginative schemes to help the area
draw maximum benefit.
About #27.4m has been spent, or is committed, to acquire, prepare and
service land at Eurocentral. The first project is the Eurocentral
Industrial and Distribution Park, a 100-acre site being developed
through a joint venture between the LDA and Amec Developments. It lies
within the Lanarkshire Enterprise Zone and the first 45 acres are now
available.
A #7m contract is under way to provide the necessary infrastructure
and there are three units currently under offer, involving a total of
450,000 sq ft of distribution space. These developments alone could mean
550 jobs.
The second project, already in existence, is the 95-acre Strategic
Investment Site which recently came within a whisker of attracting the
Japanese electronics giant Samsung to Motherwell District.
Mercedes Benz was also interested and the LDA is confident that a big
name will move in.
The third project is the Rail Freight Village alongside the
Euroterminal and consisting of a 100-acre site expected to provide
1,000,000 sq ft of modern industrial and distribution facilities.
About 1000 jobs are projected to be created over the next 10 years and
planning consent has already been granted to a #2.4m car terminal within
the village.
The LDA reckons the entire Eurocentral development will ultimately
cover nearly 800 acres, with the potential to create more than 4300 new
jobs.

In April next year Motherwell District Council will become part of
North Lanarkshire Council. In this three-page feature, Eric Kennedy
reports on the changes that have taken place within the district and
what is being done towards smooth reform
IT has been a truism over the past decade or so that the people of
Motherwell District are facing a time of change. What else is new? They
have come through a period not merely of change but of wholesale
readjustment to a radically altered industrial scene.
The change this time will be the absorption of the district council
into the North Lanarkshire Council. That comes in April of next year but
the preparations are naturally already in hand. The upheaval promises,
to be much less traumatic than at the time of the collapse of the old
industries: a groundwork has been laid to facilitate a prosperous
future.
The dust and dirt of the steelmaking, engineering and mining
activities have gone but with them the jobs. Motherwell District might
now have a cleaner and more pleasant environment but it is making every
effort to improve things on the employment front as well.
It is appropriate that some of the efforts of Motherwell District
Council and its partners in regeneration have been centred on the
establishment of bright new industrial estates and business parks on the
very sites once occupied by the old industries. Rehabilitation,
landscaping, modernisation have been the order of the day.
Allied to this has been a concerted effort to draw new companies to
the district, aided by incentives, help with planning procedures,
assistance in training, and the provision of state-of-the-art units.
Many of these are situated within the Lanarkshire Enterprise Zone,
which helps more than a little.
John Bonomy, Chief Executive of Motherwell District Council, feels the
area has a great deal going for it, in fact he is tempted to say that if
this part of Scotland can't make a go of things, which one can? ''We are
ideally situated as a centre for communications and distribution,'' he
says. ''The M8, M73 and M74 are only minutes away.
''The district is more or less equidistant from the two main cities of
Scotland, with their international airports within easy reach. Even
Prestwick is not that far away. And the establishment of the Eurofreight
Terminal at Mossend means fast access to Europe's growing markets. That
is our direct Channel Tunnel link.''
He worries about the hard-core long-term unemployed, especially among
men, and remembers the days of wholesale employment at the steel mills.
The future, he considers, has to lie with rather smaller concerns,
plenty of them, and with the potential for growth.
It is in attracting such companies, including start-ups, that the
council's efforts have been concentrated, although there are very large
sites with development potential situated near the motorway network
should a multinational concern wish to move in.
The council's Industrial Development and Estates Department provides
all possible help to companies, finding the right site and right
financial package.
Flexibility of leases, help with training, and fast planning
procedures also help.
But Bonomy feels Motherwell District has another asset, in its people.
A flexible and committed workforce is there, and it has already shown
its versatility in adapting to new industrial scenarios.
A variety of training initiatives, often supported by financial
assistance, as well as vocational training at local colleges, help keep
the workforce in touch with the changing requirements of the modern
employer.
This is one of the reasons why the Motherwell Food Park, which brings
more than 40 food companies and suppliers together in what was Britain's
first park of its kind, has been a success. The quality food products
emerging from there include anything from traditional Scottish fare to
exotic Japanese dishes.
Another innovation has been the Euromed Business Park, offering a
unique environment created to meet the legislative, quality and other
demands of marketing medical and healthcare products within the European
Union. It contains Scotland's first commercial sterilisation facility
and this and other initiatives mean Motherwell can claim to lead the way
in medicines, biotechnology, electronics, food and engineering.
John Bonomy says his council has much of which to be proud in its
regeneration efforts. ''Almost from day one of the council, it set aside
an element of its finance to provide industrial units, or be involved in
providing the infrastructure for sites for industry,'' he says.
He is also proud of the council's housing record and points to the
fact that the council inherited 40,000 council houses when it was formed
20 years ago. Today there are only 30,000, and all of those built
between the wars have been extensively modernised and upgraded.
Meanwhile owner-occupation has risen, reaching 23.81% in 1987, 31.72% in
1990, and a projected 39.44% for 1995.
''There is still much to be done,'' says Bonomy. ''But we are handing
over to North Lanarkshire a significantly improved housing stock.
''The council has also made significant progress in the provision of
leisure and sporting amenities to suit modern-day needs.
''Life can be good in Motherwell District if the proper efforts are
made in regenerating its economy through industrial growth. That has to
be an ongoing task, before and after 1996.''

THE mother of avalanche victim Dr Katharine Herd wept yesterday as a
climber told how he had found the 28-year-old woman's body buried in the
snow.
Mr Kevin Fear, 33, an outdoor instructor from Llangollen, told a fatal
accident inquiry at Dingwall how his own party had been on the same
mountain, 3458ft Liathach in Torridon, on the same day in January last
year.
His party had come off the mountain. Minutes after returning to their
vehicles, they were flagged down by Mr Marcus Cross, 18, of Aberdeen,
one of the avalanche survivors.
Mr Fear and three others headed back up the mountain and found Dr
Robin Dawson, of Dumfries, lying badly injured.
Mr Fear said: ''At first, we didn't spot Kathy. She was under the snow
and we dug her out. She was unconscious but still breathing.''
A helicopter airlifted the injured pair to hospital on Skye. Dr Herd
died next morning in a Glasgow hospital to which she had been
transferred.
Mr Terry Doe, 48, then leader of Torridon Mountain Rescue team, said
that, for the first time in his experience, there had been a
communications breakdown.
Mr Tom Forrest, 48, also a member of the rescue team, said he would
not have taken people into the gully in such conditions. The inquiry
continues.

On the surface, David McCarthy is scarcely someone you would expect to
have much sympathy for Scottish nationalism. Born 57 years ago in Kent,
he was educated at Winchester and studied modern history at Magdalen
College, Oxford, before joining Unilever.
A high-flying career saw him travel the world with his wife and three
children. He headed the multi-national's operations in Malaysia and
Chile, before he was posted to Scotland in 1988 as chairman and managing
director of their salmon-farming subsidiary, Marine Harvest.
He retired in December, two months after the company was bought by
Booker plc and merged with its main rival in the sector to become Marine
Harvest McConnell.
From his home in Kinross, this former ''soft'' Labour voter looked
back on his eight years of dealing with civil servants and Ministers at
the Scottish Office and bureaucrats in Brussels. It was an experience
which made him realise where his political allegiance now lies. Today he
will join the SNP. Here, he explains why.
Robbie Dinwoodie
ALARGE and growing number of people in Scotland believe that the time
has come for independence. I am now one of them. Scotland cannot be
governed indefinitely by the Tories. Their support in Scotland has been
abysmally low in the past two General Elections, in both of which they
were successful in England. No doubt this trend will be confirmed by a
further Tory disaster in the forthcoming Scottish local elections and
the loss of the Perth and Kinross by-election, whenever it is held.
The continuing governance of this country by a party now regularly
humiliated by the Scottish electorate offends democratic principles. It
has turned the Scottish Office into a quasi-colonial administration.
The Tories no longer even seem to expect to recover in Scotland and
their language and treatment of Scots has become offensive.
Ian Lang illustrated the point perfectly when he recently referred to
Scotland as a ''burden'' on the Tories.
Take as an example of Tory indifference their attitude to an industry
that I know well -- salmon farming. That industry is worth #200m a year
to the Scottish economy, with 55% going for export.
Six years of dealing with the Scottish Office led me to the
inescapable conclusion that the Tory Government just couldn't be
bothered with us.
Why? Because there aren't any Tory seats anywhere near a salmon farm,
nor are there likely to be. And, of course, there aren't any Tory seats
near Rosyth, Ravenscraig and several other examples of Tory disinterest
in Scotland. The only thing that the Tories are bothered about is
Scotland's oil. That is why the Union is so important to them.
Of course, some people say that this doesn't matter. There is a big
change coming in Scotland, for at last Labour have an electable leader.
The pendulum, so the story goes, is swinging Labour's way and provided
they can keep quiet about policy and avoid the crass errors of the 1992
election campaign, we will soon have a Labour government. That
government will then introduce devolution.
Scotland is keen on constitutional change and, Labour argues,
devolution will mean that we can run our own affairs. But the key
question is: ''How much power will be transferred?'' And if the answer
is ''not very much'' then what is the point of devolution?
For me the two key tests which determine where real power will lie
relate to the control of the Exchequer and relations with Europe. In
both these areas Labour's devolution proposals show Westminster
remaining in virtually full control.
Labour's timid proposal to allow its assembly to raise or lower income
tax by 3p has already apparently frightened the Labour leadership in
London into believing that they may be exposing the flank to the Tories
on which they lost the last election. The Tories have seized upon this,
with Ian Lang having already converted 3p to 19p by way of a typically
wild press release.
But there can be no real transfer of power if the Treasury in London
remains as dominant as now. I have lost count of the times over the past
six years I heard Scottish Office Ministers say that they would dearly
like to help the salmon-farming industry, ''but the problem is the
Treasury, you see!''
Relations with Europe are equally critical. It is essential to any
real transfer of power to Scotland that we be able to deal directly and
authoritatively with Europe.
Nothing, but nothing, has handicapped Scottish salmon farming more, in
their repeated efforts to engage Brussels in action to bring some
stability to the European industry, than total lack of support from the
Scottish Office.
Scottish Ministers say they would like to help but the trouble is that
even Scottish Ministers can't lift a finger in Brussels without
permission from London. The Scottish Office makes no secret of this --
they have told it to us many times.
Under devolution, Labour proposes some vague kind of direct contact
between an assembly in Edinburgh and the Commission in Brussels. That
won't work. We have had a little office over there before. It achieved
precisely nothing.
Officials of the European Union only start to listen when they know
they are speaking with people who represent, or are being fully
supported by, sovereign governments. I know, because I have been told
so, across the table in Brussels.
From my own observations of the European Union, I have no doubt that
Scottish interests in Europe can never be pursued through London in the
way that they could be out of Scotland.
I have observed, too, how effective the Irish are in Europe, because
their Government and industry have their act together. Even the
Norwegians, from outside the Community, get a better deal than we do.
Thus, if devolution ever comes to pass it will quickly become obvious
that without control of the Exchequer and without a real voice in Europe
any Labour assembly can only be a talking shop. Devolution will then be
seen as a messy and unnecessary halfway house.
And the SNP? What do they offer? To this observer, a great deal.
First of all, the return of democracy to Scotland would avoid the
indignity of being thrown bones by a Labour government just trying to
keep us happy, with the obvious objective of keeping the parliamentary
seats in Scotland and the power at Westminster.
Secondly, Scotland would be a full member of the European Union. The
benefits of membership for any small state are very great.
The EU is constructed to benefit small nations; they have equality of
representation in the Commission and the Council of Ministers and they
take their turn at the presidency. They can also use a veto.
Scotland will get even greater benefits because today Scotland ranks
only as part of a nation that is, in my observation of Brussels, the
least liked, the least enthusiastic and much the least competent member
of the EU -- and that incompetence includes the pursuit of its own
interests.
Thirdly, I believe that with independence Scotland would be a magnet
for inward investment. One of the attractions of a small country for the
investor (and I have experience of Singapore, Malaysia and Chile) is the
ease with which they can speak to top government Ministers and
officials. They like that.
For the foreign investor we could open a ''one-stop shop'' like they
have in Singapore.
Another attraction to the inward investor is the quality of the
Scottish workforce. It is a fact that education in Scotland remains
among the best in Europe.
Some Tories, and even some Labour politicians, argue that independence
would lead to an exodus from Scotland of businesses, banks and other
financial institutions -- a very curious view.
In six years of running quite a large Scottish company I certainly met
businessmen who were opponents of change, but I never met one -- not one
-- who said they would ''flit'' if independence came to pass.
The Tories keep saying that there is a transfer of resources from
England to Scotland -- a subsidy from London to keep us going.
This is an assertion unsupported by the facts. Most probably, when all
''unidentified'' (that is, conveniently excluded) expenditure is taken
into account the highest subsidies go to the South-east of England.
Scotland is rich enough and talented enough to make a pretty good job
of running its own affairs and looking after its own people.
We must decide things for ourselves, and I am glad that more and more
people seem willing to make that choice, including growing numbers
within the business community.
The twenty-first wealthiest nation in the world has nothing to fear
from going it alone. It's high time we did so.

A TARGET figure for a national minimum wage will be set by the TUC --
even though Labour leader Tony Blair has made it clear he does not want
a specific sum agreed before the next General Election.
Yesterday's meeting of the TUC executive also agreed that unions
should be involved with a Labour Government and employers on the
''setting and uprating'' of the wage, possibly through new tripartite
machinery.
Although no target is expected until after the September congress, TUC
general secretary John Monks said he fully expected it to be in place in
time for the election.
The move, seen as a bid to placate several larger affiliates including
Unison and the Transport and General Workers Union and so head off any
rebellion at congress, will not please the Labour leadership.
Although commited to the introduction of a statutory minimum wage,
Labour wants to assess what the nation can afford once the party is in
power.
Mr Monks denied the TUC decision was in ''defiance'' of Mr Blair's
wishes, adding: ''We are just doing our job as we see fit. The Labour
Party will do its job as it sees fit -- that is perfectly legitimate.
''We are just making it clear that we will come up with a target
figure. It is not anti-Labour. We are just making our position as clear
as possible.''
Many unions have urged Labour to back a minimum wage of half median
male earnings -- a formula worth #4.15 per hour. Current TUC policy is
for a minimum wage at half male earnings to be uprated to two-thirds,
but it has never before set a precise figure.

THE deal for Dunbartonshire Enterprise to buy the Drumkinnon Bay site
on Loch Lomond from its private developer owners, first revealed in The
Herald on March 8, has been completed.
The price being paid to the previous joint owners, Cala Homes and
Dixons Commercial Properties, for the 77 acres is #2.6m.
''We paid not a penny more than we had to for this site and we intend
to get every penny back,'' said DE's chief executive, Mr Donald
MacInnes.
Mr Michael Kelly, chairman of the sellers, the Drumkinnon Development
Company, welcomed ''the solution that local people wanted''.
The local Labour MP, Mr John McFall, will also welcome the move, but
is still concerned about the price paid to bring the land back into
public ownership. He is concerned that Drumkinnon Development has
profited from planning permission granted by Scottish Secretary Ian Lang
in December.
He said there was now ''a scandalous situation'' whereby
Dunbartonshire Enterprise ''provided #2.6m from the public purse to buy
land from developers who have failed to see the grandiose plans they put
to Ian Lang materialise''.
He said the price must have reflected the enhanced value after the
Secretary of State granted planning permission, and he is to ask him how
much was paid for this land over and above the price paid initially by
the developers.
The land will be linked by footbridge to Balloch Country Park to
create what DE describes as an opportunity to make Loch Lomond a ''must
see'' tourist destination.
The development could include a visitor attraction on a Loch Lomond
theme, a shop window for Scottish crafts, a hotel, a children's play
area, and a wet weather centre.
The main development phase, costing up to #80m and creating a
projected 400 direct jobs, will be funded entirely by the private
sector, if DE has its way. If any further public funding is needed,
according to Mr MacInnes, it will be restricted to #10m over a period of
five or six years.

STUDENTS are turning to drugs to cope with the triple demands of
poverty, work, and study.
Strathclyde University NUS vice-president (welfare) Michelle Sherlock
yesterday said hard-pressed students were taking amphetamines to cope
with the stress of their lives.
''We do have a stimulant problem at Strathclyde, with students abusing
amphetamines as they juggle their workload and jobs to survive,'' she
said.
She claimed grants cutbacks had led to greater student debt and led
many to seek work to make ends meet, leaving them with less time for
study and forcing them to turn to drugs to stay awake to work into the
night to meet the demands of their courses.
''The thing that angers me is that if this was happening in big
business, it would not be allowed to happen. We have legislation to
protect employees, so why are we allowing this to carry on with
students,'' said Ms Sherlock.
The NUS aims to help by distributing leaflets raising awareness of
common stress symptoms and offering a sympathetic ear through
counsellors. The NUS said the case of a 20-year-old Edinburgh University
student who died after he was thought to have tried to control his sleep
patterns with chloroform earlier this month was an example of the
pressure students faced.
''Inevitably, students are going to slip through the net. We can't
make it any easier in terms of finance but we can listen and advise,''
said Ms Sherlock.
Strathclyde University's welfare officer had seen more than 6000
people in 1994 -- with an increasing number suffering from
poverty-related stress.
The NUS in Scotland claims a rapidly-increasing number of students now
have to work to survive because of grants cutbacks.
More than 200 staged a demonstration in Edinburgh yesterday,
protesting at a ''triple whammy'' of cuts in the Scottish Office
education budget.
The students say their grants have been cut back to just #1975 a year,
with further reductions expected over the next two years.
The NUS claims the mature students' allowance and benefits for
part-time students are also set to be axed by the Government.
Scottish NUS president Douglas Trainer said: ''Student poverty has
reached shocking levels and evidence is growing of the disturbing
effects on study performance and health. This triple whammy of cuts can
only make things worse.''
Mr Trainer said the problem was particularly acute in Scotland because
of the four-year degree programme.
The NUS in Scotland says student grants have fallen by almost half in
real terms since 1979. It estimates an average of 43% of students across
Scotland are combining employment and study in an effort to beat the
poverty trap.

BRITAIN'S oldest twins are planning their 98th birthday party -- and
the guest of honour will be their 100-year-old sister.
Annie and Fay Sutherland accord their longevity to hard work and the
fact that elder sister, Rita, has always been around to look after them.
The twins, daughters of a Victorian sea captain, managed bakers' shops
in Edinburgh until the 1950s, when they moved with Rita to Crieff to

The three sisters now live at Moyness Nursing Home in Broughty Ferry,
Dundee, where a party is planned for May 16. Staff will dress in
Victorian costumes.
Rita said: ''This is very exciting. I'm very proud of them. I still
look after them. I see Annie and Fay as my little sisters.''
None of the sisters married but Rita said: ''We all had plenty of
chances.''
She said: ''We've lived well and looked after ourselves.''
Mrs Sheilagh Andrew, matron at the home, said: ''It's been a big
surprise to find this out. To have a 100-year-old in the home is special
but having Britain's oldest twins as well is something else.''
However, Annie and Fay will not feature in the next edition of the
Guinness Book of Records. A spokesman explained: ''They won't be in the
book because we just list the oldest twins ever.''
That honour falls to twins born in Surrey in 1888. They reached 102.

Valenciennes, Wednesday
MAVERICK former Marseille football club boss and MP Bernard Tapie told
a French court he was ''finished'' as his trial on charges of
match-rigging and interfering with witnesses ended today.
After a dramatic eight-day hearing, a chastened Tapie, facing a
possible prison term, pleaded for clemency.
''This affair has finished me, ruined me, left me in a financial and
professional situation that is called oblivion,'' he said.
Presiding judge Bernard Langlade said the court would issue its
verdict on May 15, eight days after France's presidential election.
The public prosecutor has demanded a six-month prison term, with
another 12 months suspended, against the former left-wing Cabinet
Minister, who admitted to lying in court.
''I have already been heavily punished and I did not expect to be even
more so,'' Tapie said.
Prosecutor Eric de Montgolfier's request at the trial in the northern
mining town of Valenciennes was the first formal call for Tapie, who
faces a string of legal actions over his collapsed business empire, to
be sent to prison.
A self-made millionaire, Tapie was declared personally bankrupt and
ineligible to hold public office for five years in December. He has
appealed against that ruling.
The court today heard defence pleas on behalf of Tapie and five others
accused of rigging a 1993 league game between Marseille and Valenciennes
six days before his club won the European Cup against AC Milan.
Marseille won the match 1-0.
Tapie, accused by former right-hand man Jean-Pierre Bernes of
instigating the scam, denied to the end any involvement in the bribery
of Valenciennes players to throw the game.
However his alibi on the charge of tampering with witnesses collapsed
when a former Cabinet colleague, Jacques Mellick, admitted he had lied
in court and had not been in Tapie's office on June 17, 1993.--Reuter.

Brussels
A FESTERING political scandal in Belgium yesterday ensnared yet
another prominent public figure when Foreign Minister and deputy premier
Frank Vandenbroucke resigned after admitting ordering the burning of
cash.
Mr Vandenbroucke summoned journalists to tell them that in 1991, he
had issued an instruction for the incineration of money discovered in
secret safety boxes in a Brussels bank. The money, meant for the
Socialist Party, is suspected of being linked to illegal kick-backs
allegedly paid to senior Belgians by the Italian helicopter firm,
Agusta.
The scandal has so far led to the resignations of three ministers and
the murder in a Mafia-style attack of a prominent MP in Liege. Two weeks
ago the former head of the Belgian air force committed suicide in a
Brussels hotel room after being linked with the scandal.
It also threatens the future of Mr Willy Claes, former Foreign
Minister and recently-appointed the secretary general of Nato. He was
Finance Minister when the bribes were offered but claims he is innocent.
Mr Vandenbroucke said he had ordered the destruction of the money --
about #120,000 -- to comply with laws on financing political parties.
However party officials ignored his order, although he did not know that
at the time.
A statement from King Albert, who accepted his resignation, said Mr
Vandenbroucke would be succeeded as Foreign Minister by Development
Secretary Eric Derycke and by Interior Minister Johan Vande as deputy
premier.
Mr Vandenbroucke, 38, became Foreign Minister last year after Mr Claes
moved to Nato. Both men are members of the Flemish Socialist Party.
The scandal centres on bribes paid through a Swiss bank to senior
politicians by Agusta in return for the Belgian Government ordering 46
attack helicopters.
A Liege magistrate, Mrs Veronique Ancia, has become a national folk
heroine as she investigates the affair, which has also threatened the
position of Mr Karl van Miert, Belgium's respected member of the
European Commission.
On May 21 Belgians will vote in a General Election in which the
socialists, who rule in coalition with Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene's
Christian Democrats, are expected to pay a heavy price for the bribery
scandals.

Johannesburg, Wednesday
PRESIDENT Nelson Mandela's estranged wife Winnie said after winning a
court battle to have a police search of her mansion and offices declared
illegal that her critics were ''hunting with the devil''.
Her remarks came after a judge ruled that police search warrants were
invalid and that documents seized in the raids should be handed back.
''The issuing magistrate did not appreciate that he needed reasonable
grounds to issue a warrant . . . The magistrate should not have issued a
warrant and it should be set aside,'' Judge Piet Streicher told the Rand
Supreme Court.
Police are investigating allegations of fraud and corruption against
Mrs Mandela, the deputy Minister of Arts, Culture, Science, and
Technology, over the awarding of building contracts to a firm in which
she had financial interests.
Officers raided her Soweto mansion and offices on March 1, when she
was away on an unauthorised visit to West Africa.
Mrs Mandela said in a statement: ''What this case has made clear is
that those who allow themselves to be used by certain sinister elements
both inside and outside the African National Congress, will in the end
find themselves hunting with the devil.
''They should therefore not be surprised when the masses call their
bluff.''
The ANC, in which Mrs Mandela heads the powerful women's league,
welcomed the ruling, describing the searches as ''melodramatic,
heavy-handed, and reminiscent of the past''.
''We hope the police will take note of the fact that South Africa is
no longer a police state where basic democratic rights of citizens could
be trampled upon without recourse to justice,'' an ANC statement said.
Police Commissioner George Fivaz said he was studying the decision and
Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi said there was no
suggestion in the judge's ruling of any wrongdoing by the police.
Mufamadi added that the criminal case against Mrs Mandela would
proceed.
Mrs Mandela, who was in West Africa when the raids took place, accuses
police of carrying out a witch-hunt against her and said she was not
guilty of any crime.
However she still has to face the music over her defiance of her
estranged husband's orders not to make the trip to West Africa.--Reuter.

Amman, Wednesday
THERE were conflicting reports from Jordan today about the eldest son
of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein having hospital treatment in the
Jordanian capital Amman.
One source claimed he was being treated for gunshot wounds he
reportedly suffered in an assassination attempt in Baghdad last week,
but a senior Jordanian official dismissed the reports.
Odai Hussein, 31, underwent surgery on Monday shortly after he was
admitted to the King Hussein Medical Centre in Jordan.
Iraqi officials were tight-lipped, apparently seeking to avoid linking
his hospital treatment with reports of the assassination bid.
A Jordanian source said Odai was in the hospital's intensive care
unit. Two Iraqis, well informed on Saddam's family, said Odai had been
shot in the neck and the abdomen.
However hospital officials declined to confirm whether Odai was being
treated and Adel Ibrahim, spokesman for the Iraqi Embassy, flatly denied
the report.
Last Thursday Kurdish rebels claimed that Odai was wounded in a
Baghdad shooting amid widening reports of unrest and military moves
across Iraq.
The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan has been clashing with Saddam's
forces in northern Iraq for three weeks.
Opposition sources reported a coup attempt in Baghdad earlier this
month.
* Turkish troops have detained villagers suspected of being Kurdish
guerrillas in a huge operation against rebels in northern Iraq.
On the third day of a mission involving 35,000 soldiers, Turkish
troops searched houses in Derkar township, north-east of the border town
of Zakho, and detained some residents.
An Iraqi opposition group said hundreds of villagers were involved.
Amid growing international concern, US Defence Secretary William Perry
urged Ankara not to harm civilians and to complete the action as soon as
possible.
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and French Foreign Minister Alain
Juppe voiced concern and questioned the legality of the operation.
The Foreign Office said: ''We are watching the situation closely and
with concern.''--Reuter.

Washington, Wednesday
THE diplomatic spotlight has suddenly swung to the Persian Gulf. Iran
has deployed 6000 troops, equipped with chemical weapons, on the Straits
of Hormuz and a new crisis with Iraq is brewing.
The United States remains determined to keep UN sanctions enforced
against Iraq, but has now to face the possibility that Iraq will
retaliate by breaking off its co-operation with UN control commissions.
The Americans argue that Saddam Hussein has not fully complied with
the UN resolutions that ended the 1991 war. He has not completely
destroyed all his chemical, nuclear, and biological weapons facilities
and has not satisfied Kuwait on its missing citizens and stolen
property, still less pay reparations.
President George Bush and his successor, President Clinton, hoped that
sanctions would force Saddam from office. He is still in power and
despite repeated rumours of coups, appears as strong as ever.
Now sanctions are up for renewal in May, and the Iraqis say that if
they are not lifted, or if no timetable for lifting them is offered,
then it will no longer consider itself bound by the UN resolutions. Its
position is supported by France and Russia.
It could expel the UN commissions, and might even revive its claims on
Kuwait. That might enable the United States to keep sanctions in force
indefinitely, but the purpose of the exercise is to bring Iraq to
civilised behaviour, not to ensure its permanent enmity.
As for Iran, the US secretary of defence, William Perry, is touring
the Gulf and announced today that Iran has moved substantial numbers of
troops to the Straits.
Their purpose in unknown, but they could, in theory, close the Gulf to
sea traffic and instantly cause chaos in world oil supplies.
Mr Perry confirmed that Iran had also deployed chemical weapons.
''We really do not know why Iran would choose to deploy chemical
weapons there but we consider it a very negative factor,'' he said.

Gainesville, Wednesday
MURDER accused John ''Billy Joe'' Crumitie told of shooting into the
car at a Florida rest stop where British tourist Gary Colley was slain
and his girlfriend wounded, his cousin testified.
''He said he shot the bitch and Aundra (Akins) shot the man,'' said
Thaddeus Crumitie.
Akins, 16, who prosecutors say fired the shot that killed Gary Colley,
has pleaded guilty to second-degree murder. He has agreed to testify
against Crumitie.
John Crumitie is on trial for the second time in the murder of Mr
Colley and the wounding of Margaret Jagger at a rest stop near
Monticello in September 1993. His first trial ended in a mistrial when
the jury was unable to reach a verdict.
Thaddeus Crumitie also testified he wore a ''bug'' supplied by police
trying to capture his cousin on tape making the admission, but tape
quality was poor. He also said he wore a wire to record statements from
some of the other young men originally charged in the case.
Earlier Ms Jagger, who has sat in the courtroom since testifying
yesterday, began to cry when medical examiner Dr Thomas Wood began to
describe Mr Colley's wounds.
He said one was caused by a .38-calibre bullet. Crumitie is accused of
firing a .22-calibre pistol into the air, while Atkins fired the
larger-calibre pistol.
Dr Wood's testimony followed that of a firearms expert who said the
bullet found in Mr Colley's chest was fired by the same gun used in a
motel robbery the day before the murder.
It also matched a bullet dug out of the couple's rented car.
There is no physical evidence linking Crumitie to the crime scene and
Ms Jagger could not pick him out of a police lin-eup. Crumitie testified
at his first trial that he was home sleeping when the attack occurred.
His new trial was moved south from Monticello, where the attack and
first trial occurred, because of concern about publicity. The attack on
the couple was the last of several on foreigners two years ago that
tarnished Florida's reputation as a tourist destination.--AP/Reuter.

SCOTTISH Office Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton made clear last
night that the sleeper service to Fort William is unlikely to be saved.
The Government still is fighting a rearguard action, but at Scottish
Questions the best that could be done was to put a gloss on the
situation.
Lord James said that the new Euro-sleeper service between Glasgow and
Paris, to be introduced next year, could be timetabled to connect with
daytime services to Fort William.
The Minister said: ''The franchising director has undertaken to look
at timetabling flexibility in daytime connections and that will be
important for day services to Fort William. These services will tie up
with other services, including the new sleeper service between Glasgow
and Paris to be introduced next year.''
The Minister came under pressure from Labour's Brian Wilson to
subsidise the threatened services, while a proper consultation process
took place. The services should not be ''condemned without trial,'' he
said.
However, Lord James told him: ''I cannot agree to divert funds from
education, health and social work for the purposes you have mentioned.''
Earlier, SNP leader Alex Salmond raised concerns over the future of
sleeper and Motorail services to Scotland.
He said the Government had compared the subsidy for these services
with the subsidy for passengers in the South-east of England, and
implied this was unfair.
He demanded: ''What hope is there for the consultation exercise when
the rolling stock is going to be stuck up a siding, when the Transport
Secretary already has made up his mind, and when the Scottish Office
team is in a state of total paralysis, unable to defend the Scottish
interest?''
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang responded that cash invested in rail
infrastructure south of the Border did benefit Scotland. He said: ''The
#300m upgrading of the East Coast main line benfited Scotland, the #600m
investment plan for the West Coast main line will benefit Scotland.
''It is a measure of the short-sightedness and narrow-mindedness of
the SNP that they cannot understand the benefits to Scotland which
accrue from services like the Channel Tunnel.''
* The Liberal Democrats yesterday issued a questionnaire to all
Conservative candidates in the forthcoming local elections asking for
their views on railway privatisation, Motorail and the Fort William
sleeper.

THE Government avoided an embarrassing defeat in a Commons committee
yesterday by promising to put before Parliament any changes in Britain's
immigration laws resulting from the implementation of European
legislation.
Home Secretary Michael Howard's pledge to consult MPs won over Tory
Euro-sceptic Bernard Jenkin, who had threatened to support a Labour
amendment that would have forced a debate on the floor of the Commons on
European proposals for loosening visa requirements.
The Government's victory left Euro-sceptic Tory MPs complaining of a
lack of democracy.
After the vote whipless rebel Sir Teddy Taylor kicked the partition
separating MPs from the public as he left. ''They might as well close
this place down,'' he said.
The debate also was attended by former Chancellor Norman Lamont, not a
member of the committee.
He said he believed the matter should be discussed on the floor of the
House, adding: ''It's potentially an explosive issue.''
The two-and-half hour debate in the normally quiet Standing Committee
B on European legislation was heavily attended by MPs from the
Euro-sceptic wing of the Tory Party. The rules of the committee allow
non-members to speak, but not vote.
Those who did speak, including several of the nine MPs who have had
the whip withdrawn, said the Government was allowing the EU to undermine
British immigration controls without consulting Parliament.
Sir Teddy told the Home Secretary: ''Unless we get it written into
European law, the EC will step by step sweep away every part of our
immigration controls.''
Mr Howard said the External Frontier Convention would in no way affect
Britain's right to control immigration. Just because a non-EU national
was granted a visa by Portugal did not mean Britain would have to grant
that person entry.
However, another whipless rebel, Mr Tony Marlow, pressed Mr Howard to
explain what the Government would do if its interpretation was
over-ruled by the European Court. ''Are we going to break the law?'' he
said.
Mr Howard said any change would require the unanimous approval of EU
members. ''We would not give our approval to any directive or regulation
that had the effect of dismantling our frontier controls,'' he said.
The Tory benches were packed with MPs from the anti-EU wing of the
party, including , Tayside North MP Bill Walker, the former Imigration
Minister Charles Wardle, and Euro-sceptics Bill Cash and Nicholas
Budgen.
They pressed Mr Howard to explain how far the Government was prepared
to go to defend British immigration laws against tampering by Brussels
or the European Court of Justice.
Mr Howard repeated the Prime Minister's promise that the Government
would take any steps necessary to preserve Britain's external frontiers.
''It is very important that we retain our existing frontier controls,''
he said.
''We do not see it as a step towards the abolition of internal
frontiers. We have no intention of dismantling our frontiers and we will
take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that they are not removed.''
Draft of the convention on controls at external and internal frontiers
are under discussion in Brussels. They include a proposed ''mutual
recognition of visas'' regime whereby someone granted a visa by another
EU state could then enter the UK without a separate UK visa.
EU members are also negotiating a ''common visa list'' of non-EU
countries whose nationals would be required to have a visa to enter any
EU country. Labour claims it would hit people from at least 28
Commonwealth countries.
Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw said a convention that would threaten
civil liberties and compromise Britain's policy of controlling
immigration should be debnated and voted on by all MPs on the floor of
the House.
The commitee voted on party lines by seven to six against Labour's
amendment. Afterwards Mr Jenkin, MP for Colchester North, said the
''very warm assurances'' he had received from Mr Howard persuaded him
not to rebel.
''I was always going to support the Government if I got sufficient
undertakings that the Commons and Parliament would have ample
opportunity to debate the effects of the External Frontiers Convention
before ratification,'' he said.

<TEXT>
The Prime Minister yesterday was accused of the latest Government
gaffe -- only 24 hours after setting up a team described as the
''committee for banana skins''.
Just six days after a verbal clanger by Chancellor Kenneth Clarke over
Consett in Durham, the text of a letter was released suggesting the
Prime Minister does not know his trade union history.
The letter, carrying Mr Major's signature, refers to the late former
seamen's leader Jim Slater as the ex-president and general secretary of
the National Union of Mineworkers.
It was sent to Shadow Defence Secretary David Clark, MP for South
Shields, Tyne and Wear, where Mr Slater lived.
Dr Clark said he was ''flabbergasted'' at the mistake.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said: ''It's an unfortunate clerical
error.''
The letter was written following a newspaper article last month
containing claims that the KGB considered former Labour leader Michael
Foot and others, including Mr Slater, to be agents of influence.
Dr Clark was outraged by the allegations about Mr Slater.He wrote to
Mr Major to complain about the article -- but the reply, dated March 16
and signed John M, upset him further.
It reads:''Thank you for your letter of 22 February about the
allegations in the Sunday Times about the late Jim Slater, the former
president and general secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers.
''I have considerable sympathy with some of your concerns about the
Sunday Times's story. But this is not a matter for the Government.
''As you know, Michael Foot has decided to take action against the
Sunday Times in respect of the allegations against him.''
Dr Clark said he was ''very annoyed'' about Mr Major's mistake over
''one of the best-known and campaigning leaders in the history of the
trade union movement''.
He added: ''It is outrageous that someone with access to the best
advisers in the world could make such an elementary mistake. This
blunder just compounds the damage.''
Mr Slater's brother, Walter, who used to be NUM lodge secretary at the
former Westoe Colliery, South Shields, said: ''This is a bloody
disgrace.
''All these people are nuggets -- they can't get anything right. If it
wasn't so serious, it would be laughable. It is beyond comprehension.''

Tokyo, Thursday
JAPANESE police raided a large complex of the Aum Shinri Kyo sect in
the village of Kamiku-Isshiki, west of Tokyo, for the second successive
day.
Yesterday about 2500 officers, backed by a chemical warfare unit,
raided 25 buildings belonging to the sect across the nation, inluding
Tokyo and in the village 63 miles west of the capital.
Officers, backed by a chemical warfare unit and caged canaries to
sniff gas, found stockpiles of a toxic chemical linked to the Tokyo
subway nerve gas attacks and rescued victims who said they had been held
against their will.
Yesterday's raid, the largest since a 1972 operation against the Japan
Red Army, officially stemmed from an abduction charge.
Officials have not publicly linked the sect to Monday's rush-hour
attacks on five subway trains, which killed 10 people and left nearly
5500 ill. Seventy remain in a critical condition.
Police sources said they were certainly investigating the sect over
the case, but gave no details.
Police said the swoop yielded 34 big containers of acetonitrile, a
toxic chemical found in the subway after the attacks, along with
residues of the nerve gas sarin.
As police moved in, sect followers screamed in protest. About 50
followers were taken to hospital in a comatose state suffering from
starvation.
Police said they had rescued six people who had apparently been held
against their will. One 23-year-old Yokohama woman told police she had
been forcibly detained.
Police said they had arrested five sect officials, three of them
doctors, on illegal confinement charges.
In a chilling message echoing the end of other doomsday cults, the
elusive head of the Aum Shinri Kyo was reported to have told followers
this week: ''It's time to carry out the salvation plan and to greet
death without regrets.''
Cult members based in Russia denied that other followers had carried
out the Japanese attack, and in fact claimed cult members had been
gassed in Tokyo and Moscow.
The Japanese director of the sect's Moscow branch, identifying himself
only as Juyu, told a news conference, ''They say in Japan that Aum
Shinri Kyo has spread poison gas, but that's far from being true.''
In fact, he added, ''in Japan we have suffered gas attacks''. He did
not elaborate.
Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama, vowing to take all necessary
measures to avert a repeat of Monday's ''hideous crime'', said he would
seek a blanket ban on sarin and other such lethal gases.
Media suspicion fell on the sect because of an incident last July near
its Kamiku-Ishhiki complex when the national police forensic team
detected sarin in the ground nearby.
Search warrants for today's raids were issued in connection with the
abduction last month of 69-year-old Kiyoshi Kariya, last seen being
pushed into a van by four men on a street near his home in central
Tokyo.
Kariya's younger sister had been trying to break with the sect after
pledging family assets as a donation.
Police did not find Kariya, and neither did they find guru Shoko
Asahara who founded the group in 1987. He claims he can levitate himself
and teaches that the world will end in 1997.
It emerged today that at least one Briton is known to have been drawn
into the Aum Shinri Kyo cult, and that worried families have contacted
watchdogs such as the Cult Information Centre seeking help about
relatives.--Reuter/AP.

<TEXT>
FERRY crews in Orkney are to be balloted on possible strike action, it
was announced yesterday.
The islands' council-owned ferry company said the men had been offered
a generous pay deal and that a strike would have a devastating effect on
remote communities.
However, Steve Todd, Scottish shipping organiser for the RMT union,
said crews wanted more time ashore rather than extra money.
He said the 29 men serving on the three ferries serving the outer
North Isles presently work three weeks on, two weeks off.
For three years, they had been seeking an even-time arrangement of two
weeks on, two weeks off, or one week on, one week off.
This had been rejected when he held talks with directors of Orkney
Islands Shipping Company, said Mr Todd.
He said a ballot on industrial action would be held next month.
Councillor Stephen Hagan, the shipping company chairman, said crews
had been offered a backdated rise of 1.5% plus #100 from April last year
with another increase of 1.4% plus #100 from next month.

A BILL to make seatbelts mandatory on school buses was introduced
yesterday by Clydesdale MP Jimmy Hood in memory of two young
constituents.
The Bill would make seat-belts compulsory in all buses and coaches
carrying children; outlaw overcrowding on seats; and require supervision
of children by someone other than the driver.
He dedicated the Bill to the memory of Tony Cousins, 13, and Francis
Scorgie, 15, pupils at Biggar High School, who died after a bus accident
on February 17 last year.
The 10-minute rule Bill will not have Government support, but draft
regulations published this week will require seatbelts for children. Mr
Hood said the measures were ''too little too late''.

THE exciting part of the day -- Scottish Questions -- was over. Labour
had said the Scottish economy was in trouble; Mr Ian Lang had said it
was wonderful. Mr George Robertson had promised devolution yet again; Mr
Ian Lang had said it was a terrible idea; Labour attacked on the water,
health and railway fronts; Mr Lang and his tiny army fought them at the
barricades.
Still, fun can't go on for ever. To work. As about 600 MPs busied
themselves outside the Chamber, 17 or occasionally 16 remained to deal
with the remaining stages of the Jobseeker's Bill.
The Sketch expected a bigger turnout in the Press Gallery than
actually occurred because the short title of the Bill describing its
main aims includes ''the assistance of persons without a settled way of
life,'' which would seem to cover journalists quite exactly.
But no, the Chamber was plunged into that dead atmosphere which
denotes that boring though necessary things are being done. Feeling that
even a Sketch should have its educative moments, the Sketch tried to
take it in.
This was not easy as Mr Keith Bradley (Manchester Withington) was
moving a Labour new clause in a speech written in impenetrable prose and
delivered in a monotone which had the odd effect of making one feel one
was hearing a blur. Mr Bradley looks born to be a middle-ranking
Minister who does most of the work of a department while flashier
colleagues have all the fun.
The Sketch worked out he was on the side of the angels, a conclusion
ratified when, first, the stunning Liberal Democrat Miss Liz Lynne
(Rochdale) and then the stunning wet Tory Mr Alan Howarth
(Stratford-upon-Avon) gave it their support.
Miss Lynne, a strapping, dark haired lady, normally clad in
eye-catching and becoming primary colours, unfairly adds to all that a
throaty voice which must have tempted many a Minister to abandon his
briefing notes and accept all her amendments
We will have to wait and see, though perhaps not for so long, what
effect Mr Howarth will have on female Labour Ministers. He has the looks
of one whom American political parties hope will be available to run for
President and, or perhaps one should say but, appears a very decent sort
of guy.
He was worried that some disabled people will find under the new
system that they will qualify neither for an incapacity allowance,
through not being disabled enough for the rules, nor for the Jobseeker's
Allowance, which is to replace unemployment benefit, through not being
fit enough to meet the rules governing that.
The exchanges illustrated an important parliamentary truth -- the most
boring debates are often the most important. There were no fireworks but
some MPs were trying to ensure that a group with enough problems already
would be fairly treated.
Dr Norman Godman (Greenock and Port Glasgow -- Lab.) joined in on
behalf of thousands of women between 60 and 65 whose benefit has been
suspended while a European Court of Justice judgment on their
entitlement is awaited. Such debates can bring home better than grander
setpieces that what Parliament does touches virtually every citizen's
life.
Miss Anne Widdecombe, the combative but able junior Social Security
Minister, argued that disabled jobseekers will be able to qualify the
number of hours, etc, they are able to work and still be eligible for
benefit. She then saw off and onslaught on behalf of those studying
while unemployed by Mr Ian McCartney, using a barrage of recycled
cliches.
This was ''knee jerk opposition'' said Miss Widdecombe. There were no
cuts in part-time study. The Opposition should withdraw and they ''might
even like to apologise''. Mr McCartney was too incensed at this
impudence to more than splutter -- briefly, for his colleagues were
hanging around waiting to vote and then be off, perhaps to an early high
tea.
Some 531 MPs of whom 17 had heard the debate trooped into the
lobbies. The Government won 277 to 254 and Labour returned to the charge
with a thinly disguised bid to introduce a statutory minimum wage. The
Sketch decided that it would be too painful to watch Miss Widdecombe
knock spots off that and left.

New York, Wednesday
RAILROAD gunman Colin Ferguson, who killed six people and wounded 19
others aboard a Long Island commuter train, was sentenced to life in
prison today, with families of his victims applauding the punishment.
''I have never presided over a trial with such a selfish and
self-centred defendant as you,'' said Nassau County Court Judge Donald
Belfi, calling Ferguson a coward and sentencing him to ''the functional
equivalent of life without parole''.
''What is even more remarkable is your total lack of remorse,'' he
added.
The judge gave Ferguson the maximum sentence under the law -- life
sentences for each of his six second-degree murder convictions and up to
25 years for each of his 19 attempted murder convictions. The sentences
are to be served consecutively.
''You will never, never return to society,'' the judge told him. ''You
will spend the rest of your natural life in prison.''
Belfi remarked that Ferguson ''unfortunately'' was not subject to the
death penalty, newly signed into state law.
Jamaican-born Ferguson stood impassively, although his face twitched
several times. He was found guilty of opening fire on the Long Island
Rail Road train on December 7, 1993.
Before he was sentenced, Ferguson made a rebuttal statement to victims
who had appeared in court yesterday to describe how they had suffered at
his hands. But as he began, the victims rose and walked out. Most
returned when the judge began to speak, and broke into applause when it
was over. Many then voiced their relief.
''A lot of the anger is gone,'' said Robert Guigliano, who had shouted
at Ferguson yesterday: ''Five minutes -- that's all I need with you.''
''I didn't get the five minutes, but that's all right,'' said
Guigliano, who was shot in the chest but survived.
Ferguson, after being found mentally competent, acted as his own
attorney in the bizarre trial. His courtroom performance was
characterised by frequent nonsensical ramblings as he confronted his
victims on the witness stand.
He said a white man had taken his gun and did the shooting, and that
he was framed because he is black.--Reuter.

THREE appeal court judges yesterday backed Kilmarnock Sheriff David
Smith over his decision to impose a 60-day sentence on a young mother of
two.
The sheriff imposed the 60-day sentence on Victoria Leiper, 19, on
January 10 this year after she admitted attempting to defeat the ends of
justice.
She admitted falsely telling police that her husband had threatened
her with a real gun when she knew the gun was a toy.
Her husband was kept in custody for almost a month and was finally
admonished by Sheriff Smith.
Yesterday, at the Justiciary Appeal Court, Mr Alan Muir, counsel for
Leiper, who has two children aged 10 months and 22 months, argued that
because of his client's personal circumstances the custodial sentence
was excessive and inappropriate.
He explained that she had been only 18 at the time of the offence and
was a first offender.
According to background reports, she had committed the offence out of
fear, firstly of her husband, and secondly of the court.
She was now divorced and if she had to serve the sentence her two
children would have to be looked after by her mother who would have to
give up her job.
She would normally serve half of her sentence and had already spent a
week in custody, leaving 23 days to go.
Mr Muir accepted the offence was a serious one but asked the court to
defer sentence to give Leiper the chance to demonstrate that she could
keep out of trouble and to assess her suitability for community service.
Lord Allanbridge, who heard the appeal with Lords Mayfield and Morton,
said the seriousness of the offence was that Leiper had given false
information to the police which she did not withdraw until the day of
her husband's trial.
The judge said it was an anxious case because it involved a young
first offender.
In his report to the appeal court, the sheriff had explained that
because of Leiper's false statement her husband had been charged with a
crime for which he could have been jailed for many months.
On the morning of the trial, Leiper had admitted that she had known
the gun was a toy but that, maliciously for vindictive reasons, she had
led police to believe the firearm was real.
The sheriff took the view that the false accusation of a crime was in
itself a grave crime, rendering the victim liable to unjustified
incarceration and causing unnecessary work and inconvenience to police
and members of the public.
As far as he was concerned, the gravity of the offence far outweighed
the personal circumstances of the accused.
Lord Allanbridge said the appeal court also considered that this was a
very serious charge.
He added: ''In all the circumstances, we cannot say that the sheriff
was not entitled to impose a custodial sentence.
He made the sentence a short one, and it will remain a short one, but
it must remain because it was an appropriate disposal.''

PLANS are finally under way to develop Oban's waterfront, with the
official planning application now lodged.
Argyll and Bute District Council and developer Iain Wotherspoon have
been in a ''stalemate'' for months over the prime site.
The council has pressed for an ice rink as part of the development
project while Mr Wotherspoon has held to plans for a bowling rink.
However, following recent talks with councillors, Mr Wotherspoon, of
Lismore Developments Ltd, is hopeful that he will be given the go-ahead.
Councillor Campbell Cameron said: ''The talks went very well. It was a
very positive meeting.''
Mr Wotherspoon hopes his plans will be passed at the May planning
meeting and added: ''There is no reason why we couldn't start the work
straight after that.
''It is now a #4.5m project. Costs have been going up all the time, so
we would have to carry it out on a phased basis.
''I would try to start with the visitors' centre and the 24 flats in
the first phase of work.''
The application is for a leisure centre and parking, incorporating a
cafe, office, visitors' centre, library, and exhibition area, to include
a retail sales area and bowling rinks.
Mr Wotherspoon said: ''There is one principal issue which is still
outstanding.'' He would not comment further but it is understood the
matter concerns the financing of the new library.
A further meeting will be held with councillors on March 29 and he was
hopeful he would get council support for his project then.

PROPOSALS for a new system to deal with complaints about the National
Health Service got a mixed reception yesterday from doctors' and
patients' representatives.
The plans, announced by Scottish Secretary Ian Lang in response to a
report on existing procedures, Being Heard, will leave a three-tier
system for dealing with patients' complaints about service from
hospitals or GPs.
Stage one will be a response from the provider of the service, with
the aim of dealing with the complaint on the spot through rapid informal
responses and, possibly, conciliation.
Stage two will be the opportunity of a review of the complaint by a
panel with an independent lay chairman, a non-executive member of the
NHS trust and a non-executive member of the health board concerned.
Independent clinical assessors will provide professional advice in the
case of complaints involving clinical judgement.
Stage three will be recourse to the Health Service Commissioner
(Ombudsman) whose jurisdiction will be widened so that he can cover all
complaints including clinical complaints and complaints against GPs and
other primary care practitioners.
The Scottish Consumer Council and the Association of Local Health
Councils both welcomed the proposals, but the association's director
Patricia Dawson said: ''We will be interested to see more detail about
how the independent chairmen of the stage two procedures are appointed.
However we welcome the emphasis on reconciliation and speedy resolution.
That is what people want.''
The British Medical Association regretted that the Government appeared
to be moving away from the present informal procedure for hospitals,
towards a more legalistic process.
Mr James Johnson, chairman of the BMA consultants' committee, said:
''Giving NHS trusts the responsibility for organising complaints
procedure is yet further evidence of the gradual break-up of a National
Health Service.
''Complainants are unlikely to be convinced that trusts will be
impartial when investigating complaints about themselves. We regard the
need for independent medical assessors as paramount.''
* In the Commons, Mr John McAllion, for the Opposition, asked how the
Government could justify the introduction of local pay bargaining
''which means that nurses and midwives in one part of Scotland will be
paid less than nurses and midwives in another part.'' He demanded the
abolition of pay bargaining and urged the Government to ''instruct the
management in every NHS trust in Scotland to pay the full 3% to all
nurses and midwives, with no strings attached?''
Scottish Health Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton said: ''Those at
the sharp end of the health service should be paid the rate for the
job.''

THE Government yesterday was accused of increasing the risk of
miscarriages of justice in Scottish courts in its determination to cut
costs.
The attack was made by Mr Paul Langan, president of the Glasgow Bar
Association, whose members are concerned by a ''considerable number'' of
the clauses in the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill.
Mr Langan will visit the Commons today to lobby MPs as the Bill
reaches its committee stage. He will be joined by representatives of the
Law Society of Scotland.
The Glasgow association has criticised the Government for not having a
Royal Commission prior to presenting the Bill before Parliament, and
claims the consultation periods on various papers relating to the
reforms were too short
It is especially worried about clauses relating to juries, judicial
examination, and an accused person's right to silence.
Mr Langan said yesterday: ''This Bill is a series of cost-cutting
measures by the Government and there is a danger that the whole
combination will result in an increase in justice miscarrying.''
The reforms which worry the association include the removal of
occupations from lists of potential jurors, and the abolition of the
right to object to potential jurors.
Mr Langan said: ''We should recognise that knowledge about jurors,
their occupations, and the right of challenge are vital safeguards to
prevent unfairness to the accused and the possibility of justice
miscarrying.''
The abolition of the right to challenge potential jurors had
significant Treasury implications, he said. ''If this clause becomes
law, there will be substantial savings to the public purse in the number
of potential jurors that require to be cited at a sitting. I think such
Treasury implications run through this Bill.''
The association also is concerned by the proposed strengthening of the
judicial examination, a procedure gone through when an accused is
brought to court on a serious charge. It says the changes would amount
to inviting accused persons to admit crimes at an early stage in
proceedings when they would have little information about the evidence
against them.
Mr Langan said the most unpopular reform was the ''attack'' on the
accused's right of silence, the proposal to allow the prosecution to
comment in court on an accused person choosing not to give evidence.
''The clause, in our view, simply erodes a cardinal principle of our
system, that the burden of proof in a criminal trial rests with the
Crown. It is an attempt to introduce an alien concept to our system.''

* UP TO 1800 jobs could be cut as a result of Scotland's council
reorganisation, the Government confirmed last night.
Mr Kynoch said in a written reply: ''The numbers of staff employed
will depend on decisions yet to be made by the new authorities.
''But, overall, it is estimated that local government reorganisation
could lead to a reduction of between 200 and 1800 in the present
workforce of around 300,000.''

LABOUR'S Shadow Heritage Secretary Chris Smith pointed towards the
bust of an alien Klingon in a glass case. ''Bears a surprising
resemblance to Michael Portillo,'' he smiled.
Captain Kirk's deadly enemies are well represented at Edinburgh
District Council's Star Trek exhibition in the capital. Any resemblance
they bear to Tory Ministers is, of course, only in the eyes of the
beholder.
Mr Smith was touring some of the council's arts and leisure facilities
yesterday to help boost Labour's local campaign to win control of the
new single-tier Edinburgh city council.
On the issue of the National Lottery and the cash contribution it
could make to the arts and heritage, he said Labour wanted to see more
flexibility over the way the money was used.

* Scottish Liberal Democrats were trying to spoil the SNP launch in
Perth yesterday, focusing their attention on the forthcoming
Parliamentary by-election, writes Local Government Correspondent Frances
Horsburgh.
Opening the party's election headquarters, president Robert Maclennan
said voters had the choice of choosing a party which aimed to break up
Britain, or choose the Liberal Democrats who had a clear message for the
constutuency.
Meanwhile, at a press conference in Edinburgh, SNP leaders yesterday
claimed that where they were in power they had already put into practice
the ''Fresh Start'' principles on which their local elections campaign
was based.
The party's vice convener for publicity John Swinney said the SNP had
developed eight principles covering water, local services, open local
government, fuel poverty, concessionery travel, housing, nursery
education and economic development.
For example, he said, SNP councillors in Highland and elsewhere had
been active in seeking to set up shadow water authorities which would
monitor the three new quangos the Government was setting up to run the
services.

ANGRY exchanges over the Scottish economy and Labour's plans for
devolution dominated Scottish Question Time in the Commons yesterday.
At one stage, Speaker Betty Boothroyd had to call for order as Labour
MP George Galloway (Glasgow Hillhead) tried to shout down Scottish
Office Minister George Kynoch.
Mr Galloway followed Dr John Reid (Motherwell North -- Lab.) in
attacking the Government over the disappearance of manufacturing jobs in
Scotland, particularly at Rolls-Royce.
He argued that the Government was presiding over an economy in which
people had low-paid, short-term jobs, compared with what they used to
have, and he demanded to know when the Government would ''clear out and
give the Scottish economy a chance?''
Mr Kynoch told him there was no point in harking back to the past when
what was required was forward thinking. ''Business in Scotland has to
adapt to what the market requires,'' he said. ''Scottish business is
looking up, members opposite are looking downwards and backwards''
The angry atmosphere was reflected in the exchanges on devolution.
Lady Olga Maitland (Sutton and Cheam -- Con.) said businesses were
threatening to ''pack up and leave Scotland, taking jobs and investment
with them.''
She said the assembly would have tax-raising powers which would cost
taxpayers 3p in the pound, affecting every family in Scotland.
Mr Lang replied that the tax-raising powers which, he claimed, would
cost the average family more than #6 a week, was ''only the beginning of
what Labour would seek to achieve with tax-raising powers in a Scottish
Parliament.''
As the argument raged, the Tories raised Labour leader Tony Blair's
weekend ''gaffe'' in which he said that all Scottish Bills now go
through a Scottish Grand Committee.
Mr Lang said that if the Leader of the Opposition did not know how the
House handled Scottish legislation, how on earth was he in a position to
say how a Scottish Parliament would.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said one of the roles for a
Scottish Parliament, which he pledged Labour would deliver, would be to
take Scotland's water back into full democratic control.
He challenged Mr Lang: ''Today, on the anniversary of the 97% bloody
nose the people in the Strathclyde referendum gave you, will you now
recognise that Scotland's water, which is among the safest and cheapest
and cleanest in the world, is going to be transformed by your
quangoisation into the most expensive in Europe?
''Why on earth do you not recognise the folly of your arrogant refusal
to listen to the people of Scotland and abandon this plan now?
Mr Lang retorted: ''You are lamentably ignorant of the facts of this
matter.'' The creation of the new water authorities would ''lead to the
more efficient delivery of water and sewerage systems at the least extra
cost to the people of Scotland.''

Mr David Evans (Welwyn and Hatfield) was intervening in a short
Commons debate on penalties for crime in which fellow Conservatives
complained about lenient sentencing.
Calling for Mr Howard to show his true colours, the MP demanded: ''He

He added: ''When are we going to start having Conservative principles

Elizabeth Buie charts the troubled voyage of the Pacific Pintail --
the ship the world does not want to know because of the radioactive
cargo it as transporting from France to Japan
ABRITISH ship loaded with 14 tons of high-level nuclear waste, en
route from France to Japan, is now sailing into the staunchly
anti-nuclear South Pacific.
The British-flagged ship, the Pacific Pintail, which is being shadowed
by the Greenpeace ship NV Solo as it travels half-way across the world,
has already encountered political condemnation from Caribbean and South
American states and taken part in a dramatic confrontation with the
Chilean Navy.
The environmental campaigners Greenpeace have raised the spectre that
an accident involving the ship could be of similar dimensions to the
Chernobyl explosion.
The Pintail, operated by Pacific Nuclear Transport Ltd (PNTL), a
subsidiary of British Nuclear Fuels, is carrying radioactive waste from
the nuclear reprocessing plant run by France's state-owned Cogema group
to Japan. Cogema's customers include some of Japan's main electricity
utilities who use its facilities to reprocess spent nuclear fuel rods
and plutonium.
Cogema, like BNFL (whose Thorp reprocessing facility is only now
coming on stream) is committed to sending back all the waste to its
customer.
Thus, as long as Cogema has reprocessing contracts with Japan, and
BNFL is poised to accept them, the Pintail's shipment is likely to be
the first of many regular shipments of waste.
The waste is the 3% residue left after uranium fuel rods, originally
brought to the European countries for reprocessing from the Japanese
utilities, have been stripped of re-usable material. Usable, unburnt
uranium comprising 96% of the imported spent fuel rods is recycled by
BNFL and the French company Cogema into new fuel rods for power
generation, while the small amount of waste is dealt with in a
relatively new process of vitrification. This process involves mixing
the waste with molten glass and pouring it into 1.3m high stainless
steel containers. As the molten material cools, the waste becomes locked
into the solid glass.
The vitrified waste is carried in specially designed flasks; massive
steel structures which weigh more than 100 tonnes each. The flasks are
subjected to rigorous tests laid down by the International Atomic Energy
Agency, including two ''drop'' tests -- one on to a solid unyielding
surface and the other on to a steel spike.
The ships used for carrying nuclear material -- in 20 years PNTL have
transported nuclear material more than three million miles by sea
without an incident resulting in the release of radioactivity -- are
covered by regulations laid down by the International Maritime
Organisation.
Regulators regard these ships as among the safest afloat, and few
would deny that oil tankers and even ships carrying chemical waste have
a much worse record. Nevertheless, the potential damage of a nuclear
accident is enough to cause the kind of political protest that the
passage of the Pintail has created.
However, Dr Edwin Lyman, an American research associate with the
Center for Energy and Environmental Studies at Princeton University, has
produced a report for Greenpeace claiming that the nuclear industry is
sacrificing safety to cut costs.
Certain of his criticisms based on the kind of seals used on waste
caskets and the temperature of waste transported have been described as
''inaccurate'' by BNFL.
Meanwhile, as the Pintail battles through 30-ft waves and 70mph winds,
rounding Cape Horn, the debate over whether nuclear waste should be
transported by sea -- or even transported at all -- is raging unabated.
First to protest were the Caribbean Community leaders, who appealed to
the governments of Britain, France and Japan to avoid their coastlines,
''now and in the future''.
Then, representatives in Washington of the US possessions of Puerto
Rico, the US Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and Guam, and of the US
State of Hawaii, asked President Clinton to demand that the British,
French, and Japanese government postpone the shipment of nuclear waste
until concerns over safety had been resolved.
South African politicians expressed their disquiet that the Pintail
might go round the Cape of Good Hope, and asked the relevant governments
to ''dispel our doubts by removing the secrecy shrouded around this
shipment''.
Protests have also been delivered by the Micronesian state of
Kiribati, one of the smallest nations in the South Pacific with a
population of 78,000, Fiji, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the
Republic of Nauru.
The most decisive action, however, came from the Chilean Government in
Santiago which attempted to ban the Pintail from its 200-mile exclusive
economic zone. The Chilean patrol vessel Macalvi approached the Pintail
shortly after she entered the Chilean EEZ, but the Pintail's captain
refused to change course. The Chilean navy later reported that the
Pintail had changed course, but not, apparently, until the Chilean
captain threatened to use force.
According to Greenpeace the Chilean navy ship warned that the Pintail
could be ''exposed to the use of weapons against you from navy vessels
or airplanes of the Chilean navy.''
Greenpeace claimed the Pintail's response was: ''I hear your message
and with the nature of our cargo I would not think that is a very
sensible thing to do, to use arms.''
The Chileans also, claimed Greenpeace, threatened to interfere with
the British ship's navigation and to throw ropes into the water to stop
it.
But as Chile's navy chief said the ship had taken ''the worst route
possible'' and environmentalists claimed that international protest had
succeeded in driving the Pintail away from what would have been its
shortest route through the Panama Canal, the supremacy of international
law was being called into question.
Few would argue that political clout, rather than observance of
international agreement, has won the day on this occasion.
Alan Boyle, professor of public international law at Edinburgh
University, said that Section 19 of the UN Convention on the Law of the
Sea III (Unclos), makes clear the principle that foreign merchant ships
conducting peaceful, lawful trade have the right of free or ''innocent''
passage through a state's territorial waters, so long as the ship's
actvities are not prejudicial to the peace or good order of the coastal
state.
The Pintail, therefore, has every right to be in a state's territorial
waters, even under the 1989 Basle Convention on the Control of
Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Waste. On signing that agreement,
the UK Government declared that '' . . . the provisions of the
convention do not affect in any way the exercise of navigational rights
and freedoms as provided for in international law.
''The ship, therefore, has every right to be there. It may pose a risk
to the coastal state, but then lots of ships do. Oil or chemical tankers
are much more obviously a risk. International law can regulate, but not
prohibit passage,'' said Professor Boyle.
The Chilean Government could doubtless be taken to the International
Court of Justice for its actions against the Pintail -- but at present,
that would serve little purpose.
Greenpeace can protest as much as it wants that the Pintail will
probably be passing through the nuclear-free zone of Antarctica in the
next few days. But as long as it does not release radioactive material
in that area, no international sanctions can be applied. The battle of
the environmental campaigners and the politicians versus the
industrialists of the world's nuclear power has a long way to go yet.

VOTERS in Perthshire and Kinross have an ideal chance to drive a nail
in the coffin of the Tories at the April 6 elections for the new unitary
councils, according to prospective SNP Parliamentary candidate Ms
Roseanna Cunningham.
She was speaking in Perth yesterday at a launch of the party's local
government manifesto.
Along with other SNP speakers, Ms Cunningham claimed that their party
-- which is contesting every seat in the area -- was the only one
capable of taking control away from the Tories.
SNP Group leader, Councillor Bruce Crawford said that since 1992, the
area had slipped back as a result of Tory indifference, and in order to
take advantage of the opportunities available under the new single-tier
authorities, a fresh start had to be ensured.
Ms Cunningham, who will be fighting to wrest the Tory-held seat from
the Tories in a by-election caused by the death of Sir Nicholas
Fairbairn, said that she would be fully supporting local candidates.
Ms Cunningham said: ''People have the chance to get shot of the Tories
at the elections, which will put another nail in their coffin.''

Building Scotland's hydro schemes was a memorable feat for the
thousands of Gaelic-speakers involved, as Lorn Macintyre reports
BELOW the dam at Kinlochleven -- nearly half-a-mile long and holding
back 24 million gallons of water -- is a small cemetery, the graves of
navvies killed in the construction and who died in bogs crossing the
moor to Kingshouse in search of drink. But where is the resting place of
the Irish gambler allegedly murdered at the Loch Awe scheme 30 years ago
for being too lucky?
The Kinlochleven cemetery and the riddle of the gambler are two of the
compelling stories in a programme on BBC2 tonight at 7pm, the first in a
series called Obair Latha (A Day's Work) in which Gaelic speakers relate
their work experiences.
Early this century British Aluminium built a power station at
Kinlochleven, with water for it harnessed nearly five miles away in the
mountains in a dam that took 2000 navvies four years to build, by pick,
shovel and crowbar. Patrick MacGill recorded the squalid conditions in
his classic Children of the Dead End.
''The room, 40ft square and 10 foot high, contained 50 bed-places,
which rose one over the other in three tiers . . . A spring oozed
through the earthen floor.''
The strong, light metal, excellent for armaments, rescued British
Aluminium's fortunes in the First World War. To meet post-war demand the
company built another factory, on a site near Fort William, taking their
water supply for power from Loch Treig by 15 miles of tunnel through the
mountains.
John MacDonald, whose father had worked on the Kinlochleven scheme,
went to work at Lochaber in 1928 in the tunnel at #1 a shift, big money
at that time.
MacDonald recalls: ''I was on the concrete mixer all the time. The
tunnel is 15ft high and 15 broad in the shape of a horse-shoe. It was
lit on both sides as far as you could see like a Glasgow street.''
The hydro-electric schemes offered work to thousands of Scots and also
attracted thousands of navvies from Ireland. In the specially created
camps of more than 1000 men they mixed more than their Gaelic over drink
and dice. Norman MacLeod remembers Glen Quoich camp in the 1950s: ''In
one year here I was in greater mortal danger . . . than I was in all my
other years with the police.''
With work scarce in Ireland, navvies crossed to Scotland in their
hundreds to get a start on the schemes, and Ukrainian, Czech and Polish
displaced persons came from Europe.
Many of the dams were built in some of the wildest and most remote
areas of Scotland. In the three years it took to build the dam at Loch
Sloy (by Loch Lomond), there were only three dry weeks, and with the mud
they sometimes had to use horses instead of lorries. Murdo Macleod
remembers a bad winter at Glascarnoch, between Ullapool and Garve. ''We
were off for nearly three months because of snow. You couldn't get near
it. You couldn't tell where the dam site was.''
The tunnellers had the most dangerous and exhausting jobs, crouching
in dust-filled, confined spaces with their deafening drills. There are
more than 180 miles of tunnels and aqueducts in the Scottish dams, and
two tunnels meeting was cause for celebration.
Iain MacMaster from Acharacle has fond memories. ''The tool maker and
your employer used to send in drinks; whisky, gin, rum, with cigars and
cigarettes. Then the party started.''
The camps of men far from home, and with big money in their pay
packets after the long shifts attracted the professional gamblers with
their rolled-up Crown &amp; Anchor boards. The Cruachan scheme at Loch Awe
was huge. Seonaidh and Angus Alick MacInnes from North Uist claim:
''There was this Irishman there, a gambler who did nothing else but play
Crown &amp; Anchor. He didn't work and had a briefcase full of money. He
went round all the hydro camps, and then he carried on to Loch Awe, to
the three camps there, gambling all the time. He made a fortune.
''Gentleman Jim, they called him.'' The gambler, or so the story goes,
came to grief on a Saturday night out -- dragged along underneath a bus,
all the way to Oban.
Norman MacLeod sums up the impact of the schemes bitterly, ''Whatever
the Highlands got out of it, it was dearly bought. We were promised free
electricity before the end of the century, but we're still waiting for
it.''

Ian McConnell casts lights on two Scots companies at the heart of a
muli-national project to light up European nights
TWO Scottish companies are using the research facilities of
universities at home and in Spain to pursue a bright idea on street
lighting with firms across Europe.
The #700,000 research project, which is 50% funded by the European
Union, will last two years, after which the seven companies involved
should have commercially exploitable products.
All of the firms have expertise in complementary fields, their joint
efforts coming together to produce an integrated control system to
improve the quality and efficiency of street lighting.
It is hoped the end-product could eventually become a world standard,
with Brussels having been particularly impressed by the
environmentally-friendly idea of energy savings through increased
efficiency.
The project aims to cut the 9p-a-night cost of lighting street lamps,
through energy savings, and reduce massive maintenance costs through the
eventual development of a research-based system which can predict
faults. It also aims to improve the quality of lighting, thereby helping
reduce crime.
Kilmarnock-based U-Aerials and Communications will work on the
telecommunications systems to ensure, for example, that a control centre
is alerted to faults at remote locations.
Dunsmore Data, of Edinburgh, will produce the system management
software which will translate the inspired insights of the boffins into
a user-friendly system.
Glasgow Caledonian University will help out with telecommunications,
integrated circuit design and software development, in what is by far
the biggest project in its recently established Intelligent Technologies
Research Centre.
Its Spanish counterpart, the University of Oviedo, has expertise in
the fields of lighting systems and power engineering. Kelman, based in
Lisburn, Northern Ireland, two Spanish, a German, and a Portuguese
company are also involved.
Funding for the ISCELIS, or Intelligent Supply and Control of External
Lighting Systems, project comes from Brite-EuRam, a European Union
science fund which buys research and development facilities for small
and medium-sized enterprises who could otherwise not afford them. The
companies themselves contribute the other half of the costs.
Project leader Barry Beggs, a lecturer in Glasgow Caledonian
University's department of engineering, said: ''I think what is unique
is the fact that we have a group of SMEs involved in a major European
project that has potentially got global implications.''
He added: ''The cost savings per lamp are a bit dubious but, when you
put that into a European context, 5% of 9p for every lamp in Europe is a
lot of money.''
The partners believe the system developed could also be applied to
signpost lighting, bollards and traffic lights.
When the project is finished, the companies could market their
innovative system by forming a European Economic Interest Group, which
makes it easier for small and medium-sized companies to overcome the
legal and fiscal difficulties of cross-border trade.
Alternatively, if they can each identify their contributions to the
system, they may market these products and services individually.
U-Aerials and Communications, which employs 45 people and hopes to
double its turnover to more than #2m in the year to end-August, is
already exploring the prospect of doing other business with one of the
Spanish companies.
Managing director Bill Strachan, who views the large-scale lighting
project as a great opportunity, said: ''It could give us a foothold in
Europe. As a small company, we see a lot of potential.''
In spite of the hi-tech nature of the firms involved, communication
difficulties have still been encountered in the pan-European project,
with nobody in the Portuguese company speaking English.
However, Spanish is the first language of Hernando Fernandez-Canque, a
member of the Glasgow Caledonian University research team, and he has
ensured ideas are communicated effectively.

TWO bar workers placed a wrong bet yesterday, and won nearly #33,000
instead of #12,000.
Ms Maggie Biggins and Mr Iain McCalman hit their unwitting lucky
streak at a betting shop in Thornliebank, Glasgow.
Bookies William Hill said they thought they were placing a #1 bet on
the Tote Jackpot.
Instead, they put their money on the William Hill Jackpot Six, a
similar concept which required them to pick six winners at yesterday's
racing in Exeter.
Both work at the Rowallan Bar in Thornliebank and, for Ms Biggins, it
was only the second week that she had been betting on the horses.
She said last night: ''I was just dumbfounded. I still can't believe
it, and Iain's over the moon.''

FISHERMEN are stepping up their campaign to force the Government to
withdraw from the Common Fisheries Policy and to claim back Britain's
200-mile exclusive fishing zone.
They are staging a rally in London's Central Hall at the end of next
month and hundreds of vessels around the UK coast are expected to tie up
for that day to allow an anticipated 3000 to 4000 fishermen to attend.
Mr Roddy McColl, strategy group secretary of the Save Britain's Fish
Campaign, which is hoping to force British withdrawal from the CFP
within two years, said: ''The campaign recognises that the debate on
Europe is going to intensify and the fishing industry will feature
prominently in the parliamentary discussions because Parliament gave
away the water and the fish stocks and it is our belief and firm
conviction they can claim that back.
''We can accomplish this aim without leaving the European Union and we
are not anti-European, we are not militant, and we propose no violent
means of protest.
''However, we must persuade our politicians to act and save yet
another great British industry from being destroyed.''
The chairman of the Scottish White Fish Producers' Association, Mr Tom
Hay, said Britain's fishermen had been persecuted and humiliated. He
said they had no doubt that they could take back into British control
fishing grounds and fishing rights which were improperly given away.
Mrs Elizabeth Stevenson, an owner from Newlyn in Cornwall, said: ''We
have done nothing but give, give, give in terms of quotas, waters -- in
terms of everything.
''The Spanish accession agreement reached in Brussels just before
Christmas was the final straw. We have decided we cannot take it any
more.
''It would mean the end of our fishing industry and so we are backing
this campaign to force Parliament to regain control of our exclusive
fishing zone so it can be policed and monitored and maintained in line
with stocks for the benefit of the UK fishing industry.''
Mrs Stevenson, whose family owns 26 vessels, continued: ''It is not
just fishermen's jobs which are at stake. For every one man at sea there
are four or five on the shore relying on him.''
The Government has criticised the campaign for using fallacious
arguments and misrepresenting the facts.
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang has said that the campaign is based
entirely on an appeal to the emotions of fishermen and fails to
recognise the economic, legal, and political constraints which make the
objective of withdrawing from the CFP completely unrealistic and
damaging to the fishing industry.

THE 72 people who live on Eigg last night still had no idea whether
the ownership of the island was about to pass from Keith Schellenberg.
Rumours persist that the island has been sold or is about to be sold
to German artist Marlin Eckhard, who calls himself Maruma.
Indeed Maruma, 41, is reported to have already declared himself as the
new owner of Eigg, having paid #1.5m for the 7000-acre island.
Mr Schellenberg, however, said these reports were wrong. ''I am still
the owner of Eigg. That is the state of affairs. I can assure you that
if ever I sell it, I will announce it publicly. Mind you, anyone looking
at the papers would think twice about buying the island, given the
roasting I am always getting.''
Last night, Mrs Karen Helliwell, secretary of the Eigg Residents'
Association, said: ''Confusion and uncertainty reign here. None of us
knows what is going on. We just get our wonderful information from the
papers and then somebody says something different.
''The German artist says he visited last year but he didn't identify
himself, although some think they might remember him.
''Schelly (Keith Schellenberg) arrived today but nothing has happened.
There are no meetings or anything like that, although he is supposed to
have told the four people that work for the estate that they have
nothing to worry about.''

THIS month, Finger On The Pulse waves its magic wand over the tricky
topic of transport. It's set to be the major subject of debate at
Scotland's first-ever national transport conference next week, ''Getting
Scotland Moving,'' organised by the Scottish Chambers of Commerce.
All the main movers and shakers in Scottish transport will be there,
and Sir Alastair Morton, co-chairman of Eurotunnel, will make the
keynote speech. It also seems that transport will be one of the major
topics for political debate this spring.
With this in mind we decided to compile our own transport ''wish
list'' with the help of members of the Glasgow Chamber of Commerce --
with over 2000 members it's the authentic voice of West of Scotland
business today.
We asked them to tell us what improvements they want to see across the
entire spectrum of Scottish transport. The list is interesting,
sometimes amusing and surprising, and occasionally alarming.
Members all had their transport ''horror'' stories -- be it a
half-hour delay on 18.02 to Falkirk Grahamston, gridlock on the M8,
congestion in the Clyde Tunnel or shuttle shockers. The situations are
certainly frustrating but what are the solutions?
According to Scottish Chambers there is only one solution -- to go to
the top and actually drive government policy. The Chamber wishes to see
an integrated and cohesive transport policy for Scotland. At the moment
this doesn't exist. Chief executive of Glasgow Chamber of Commerce,
Geoff Runcie, believes that this is seriously damaging Scotland's
recovery from recession, and is at the root of the majority of transport
problems in Scotland:
''If Scotland is to trade competitively in the UK and world markets,
our position on the periphery must be supported by the optimum
infrastucture. At the moment, this doesn't exist and until it does, we
will be operating at a competitive disadvantage,'' he warns.
He also criticises the lack of funding for transport. Indeed a recent
study reveals that although the UK's roads and airports are amongst the
busiest in Europe, Britain invests far less in transport than her
European neighbours. For example, investment in rail in the UK is only
20-30 per cent of the levels per head of the Netherlands, France and
Germany.
Similarly, the UK invests only about 80% per head of that invested by
France and Germany in roads. Yet it would seem that our network is badly
in need of attention. According to Scottish Chambers, the main cause of
road congestion in Scotland is the growth of car traffic, with cars
accounting for 80% of all traffic on motorways, trunk and principal
roads. It predicts that this could double by the end of the century.
Curtailing personal mobility is a thorn yet to be grasped by Government,
but it surely must sometime soon.
A ''wish list'' of solutions to these problems might be endless.
However, we decided to offer Chamber members only one wish. If they
could chose to solve at a stroke a transport problem specifically
detrimental or frustrating to them, what would it be and why? First stop
was Jim Hunter, Managing Director, Caledonian Freight Forwarders, who is
looking for ''integration''.
''Kicking the Government when it's down has never given me any
satisfaction but this Government and most in living memory have never
been on top in transport terms in Scotland. There continues to be a
complete lack of an integrated transport policy and little sign of one
for the future. My wish would be to see this in place immediately.
''Certainly there are many initiatives underway such as Mossend and
the Channel Tunnel, Glasgow Airport expansion, A74 upgrading and another
Forth Road Bridge, but where's the balance? Where's the confidence
giving bigger picture? Not even Paul Daniels can make it appear because
it just doesn't exist.''
Meanwhile, Douglas Fairbairn, Managing Partner at Ernst and Young,
Glasgow, was particularly concerned about his lungs!
''There has been a great deal in the Press of late about the harmful
effects of vehicle emissions. Recent reports seem to be linking exhaust
pollution with the rapid increase in asthma attacks.
''In fact, a recent government air quality study, which measure the
levels of nitrogen dioxide, found breaches of European guidelines in
Glasgow, Dundee, Motherwell, Edinburgh and Aberdeen. Friends of the
Earth described Hope Street as one of Britain's most polluted streets.
''My wish would therefore be to find a way to cut down on the number
of cars for short-term journeys. We could look at adopting some American
ideas, for example, incentives for those people who share car journeys
during peak times.''
Public transport was high on the wish list of Tom Waddell, Manager of
The Recruitment Company the specialist driving employment agency:
''I would wish for a more efficient public transport network into the
city centre which would allow motorists to leave cars outside an already
heavily congested area. This would free-up the traffic clogged streets.
''This in turn would allow deliveries to be made quicker and alleviate
the need for hard-pressed distribution drivers to double park or leave
vehicles in dangerous places.''
Agnes Samuel, Executive Director, Glasgow Opportunities, was also
concerned about public transport.
''My wish would be for someone to tell me where to get on and where to
get off -- the buses that it! If we are to be encouraged to leave our
cars and use public transport, let's have some readily available
information. Nothing classified. Just route maps on bus stops and inside
buses, marked off in fare stages to that you know what the exact fare is
without asking the driver. Other European cities do it. Let's make it
easier for tourists and citizens alike.''
Finally, we asked Geoff Runcie, Chief Executive of the Glasgow Chamber
of Commerce and the driving force behind ''Getting Scotland Moving,'' to
give us his views.
''It does not take a rocket scientist to recognise that integration,
not only of infrastructure, but of public and private sector transport
systems is absolutely the key and the only way to address the congestion
and deficiencies of our existing system. We need to move more people on
to effective, attractive public transport, allowing freight to make more
balanced use of the road, rail, sea and air.''
''Private transport could then be used for the out of the ordinary
journey, the recreational journey where an element of freedom is
absolutely crucial. However, I contend that without infrastructure in
place this view is a romantic notion for the UK and for Scotland in
particular. We need to plan, implement and then support the balanced use
of personal and public sector transport.
''It is time for the people of the community, the people in industry,
to state clearly that enough is enough, and that some serious planning
is necessary for us to enjoy improved transport efficiency and,
therefore, quality of life.''
Getting Scotland Moving takes place at Glasgow's SECC on Thursday
March 30. Information and last-minute bookings from The Conference
Manager, Getting Scotland Moving, Alan Clark Associates, 4 Woodside
Place, Glasgow G3 70F: telephone 041 353 5040 or fax 041-332-2363.

BRITAIN'S newest National Lottery millionaires said yesterday they
would be toasting their overnight wealth with cans of lager, not glasses
of champagne.
Unemployed Ms Audrey Jenkins and Mr Andy Voss are determined that
their #3.9m win will not turn them into ''snotty-nosed snobs''.
Ms Jenkins, 28, and Mr Voss, 29, live in a two-bedroomed council house
in Hartlepool, Cleveland, and until Saturday were managing on about #90
a week.
They are the biggest lottery winners to expose themselves to the
limelight -- and the first to agree to publicity since the identity of a
man who won almost #18m was controversially revealed by some newspapers.
Mr Voss, who said he had not had a proper job since he left school 13
years ago, said they hoped to buy a four-bedroomed house in the same
area of Hartlepool, a car, and would take their children -- Carl, nine,
and Claire, five -- to Disney World in Florida.
''We don't want anything big. We don't want to be moving up with the
snobs,'' he said.
He added: ''We will still be drinking lager.''
The lottery organiser, Camelot, is predicting another #8m jackpot this
weekend.
* National Lottery scratchcards were back on sale last night after
technicians sorted the computer software problem that scuppered the
launch on Tuesday.
Tickets were withdrawn hours after sales began on Tuesday when
retailers across the country experienced problems.
* Pools punter Mr Tony Jones yesterday scooped more than #1m -- and
put his good fortune down to a lucky charm. The 41-year-old
father-of-two, of Tredegar, South Wales, bought a carved wood talisman
in Jamaica while on holiday with his wife, Lynn, last year.
Mr Jones picked up a Littlewoods cheque for #1,022,780 after using a
successful 8 from 10 full perm costing just 60p.

A FIVE-PAGE document that looks like the brochure for a house sale
explains what the Royal Naval base at Rosyth has to offer prospective
buyers.
It includes a map of the site, the closing date for bids, and gives a
detailed guide of the buildings on it.
The document, prepared by property consultants Ryden, gives details of
the sale of the base which has been on the shores of the Firth of Forth
since 1903.
The main naval base extends to 148.7 acres. Included in the sale is
Woodend House, a mansion which is currently the base commander's house.
The oil fuel depot on site is said to be suitable for continued
commercial use.
HMS Cochrane is the main shore-based naval facility and provides an
office, ward room, residential accommodation, and medical facilities.
There is nearly one million square feet of accommodation on site.
There is also a 76-acre marsh.
Included in the sale is a deep-water berth 190ft long and 27ft deep.
There are three other basins with jetties.
Access to the site at present is through the dockyard security gates
but the intention is to grant a more direct access through the existing
visitors' centre car park. A railway line goes through the site.
Included in the base is an enclave extending to 30 acres which is to
be retained as a Royal Navy stores depot.
Also on the base is Rosyth Castle and a dovecot which would be the
subject of an access and maintenance agreement with Historic Scotland.
According to the document, the base ''provides an excellent commercial
opportunity to develop an industrial/office estate for port-related
activities which could also benefit from the railway links''.
It adds: ''Many of the buildings and facilities have recently been
refurbished but there is potential to carry out further improvements and
to develop a master plan for the re-use and redevelopment of the area.''
The front of the document states that HM Naval Base Rosyth is being
sold by order of the Secretary of State for Defence on the instructions
of the Defence Lands Service (Scotland).

STRATHCLYDE councillors rallied to the support of their beleaguered
social workers yesterday following a sheriff's criticism of their
handling of the Ayr child sex abuse case.
Based on the findings of two external assessors, councillors accepted
that the social work staff who gave evidence in the four-year-old case
acted ''honestly and in good faith''.
However, the assessors, Ms Alyson Leslie, a social work consultant,
and Mr Brendan Kearney, legal services manager of Dumfries and Galloway
Regional Council, concluded that in some instances the staff appeared to
have acted with ''an inordinate degree of naivety and credulousness'' in
their practice and in their reception of allegations from the children.
And the department itself accepted that some of the practice of social
workers in 1990 was ''flawed'' judged by present standards. A review is
being taken to improve procedures for investigative interviewing and
recording.
However, social work committee chairman, the Rev David Laing, reminded
his colleagues: ''Our social workers are trained as carers, they are not
trained as detectives. The people are expecting our social workers to go
and operate as if they were detective inspectors of police in the CID.
''Even with the best in-service training in the world we'll never
reach that kind of standard. That's why I'm concerned about the weight
Sheriff Colin Miller gave to the investigation techniques.''
He called on the Government to introduce national standards for
investigating such cases and said that in the United States social
workers and court officials received special training in dealing with
child abuse cases.
In her report to the committee yesterday, social work director Ms Mary
Hartnoll stated: ''The department accepts that a number of interviewing
practices adopted between June and August 1990 were flawed. In
particular, leading questions were asked.''
The department also accepted criticism of staff for inappropriate use
of equipment, such an anatomically correct dolls. However, this practice
related to a period of time when the department's staff had little
experience of the techniques that are now accepted to require additional
training.
Ms Hartnoll rejected Sheriff Miller's criticism that the staff had
closed their minds to the possibility that abuse had NOT occurred and
that they had pre-conceived views they were dealing with cases of
satanic abuse.
Senior Conservative member, Councillor Fergus Clarkson, was concerned
about the independent assessors' reference to case notes having been
amended, although the assessors had accepted that there was no evidence
of collusion and no apparent intention to deceive or mislead.
Mr Michael Johnston, solicitor for one of the families involved, later
condemned the social work department's response as a ''smokescreen'' and
a ''charade''.
He declared: ''This is a shameful attempt to cover up the inadequacies
of the social workers and the management procedures involved in this
case.
He said a great number of the social work management would sleep more
easily having heard Ms Hartnoll come to their rescue with this
smokescreen of a supposedly independent consultants' report.
''I would challenge Ms Hartnoll to clarify how the authors of the
report were selected and what was their remit.
''I believe they were asked to look at only 40 pages of Sheriff
Miller's 400-page judgment and interviewed only six of the social
workers who were involved.''
Mr Paul Burns, solicitor for another of the families, regretted that
the social work department had ''delivered a whitewash instead of an
apology''.

A LANGBANK businessman has come up with his own vision of the future
by registering a new company in Glasgow with the aim of designing and
operating a fleet of traditionally powered paddle steamers in tourist
areas throughout the world.
Mr Alistair Macleod, a self-confessed steamer buff, is now seeking
venture capital and institutional funding to allow the building of the
first paddler to proceed. This could cost around #9m and he says it is
hoped the first ship will be constructed at Fergusons Shipbuilders, Port
Glasgow.
He has even chosen a name -- the New Caledonia, re-kindling memories
of one of the smartest Clyde paddlers of all time, the 1934-Denny built
Caledonia which survived in service until 1969 and then as a static
restaurant on the Thames until 1980 when she was destroyed by fire.
His new company is called The Paddle Steamer Cruise Line and he says
negotiations are already taking place to operate new Clyde-built paddle
steamers in the Far East after he met contacts on a Strathclyde Business
Development mission to Hong Kong and China last year.
Mr Macleod declared yesterday: ''With considerable growth taking place
in the world cruise lesiure market this enterprise is well positioned to
create its own niche market.''
Though not much larger than the present Waverley, Mr Macleod's New
Caledonia and others that might follow would clearly have horizons
stretching much further than your average ''Doon the Watter'' day trip.
He says: ''From spring to autumn The New Caledonia would operate
cruises from the Clyde to the west coast of Scotland, southern Ireland
and the north of France. During the winter the ship would be based in
the Mediterranean and would operate in areas where conventional cruise
ships cannot navigate.''
The paddlers would have luxury two-berth cabins with en-suite
facilities and would accommodate up to 126 people including 10 deluxe
cabins with private verandas on the upper deck. A casino, cocktail bar,
dance floor and fitness centre would add that touch of elegance.
Mr Macleod says the New Caledonia, 90 metres in length and 20 metres
in overall beam, would be built to Class 2 international standard, be
fully stabilised with bow and stern thrusters and capable of operating
in open seas.
However, at least one important tradition would remain -- the engines
would be based on the triple expansion steam machinery used on the
Waverley. This was latterly the province of the Rankin and Blackmore
Eagle Foundry at Greenock, long-since demised.
''The traditional skills and technical expertise required to construct
the steam engines are being resourced in the West of Scotland area and
Captain David Neill, of the Waverley, has provided assistance to the
project,'' said Mr Macleod.
''The venture is also benefiting from the involvement of senior
figures in the shipping and hotel management industry, amongst whom are
Sir Ross Belch and James Smith, vice-president of Hilton Hotels in
Central Asia and general manager of the Hong Kong Hilton.''

THE world cruise liner market is set for a huge growth up to the end
of the century, and presents a great opportunity to boost tourism in the
North of Scotland, according to a delegation just returned from the
annual Seatrade Cruise Shipping Conference and Exhibition in Florida.
One of the ports most likely to benefit from the growth is the
Cromarty Firth, where passenger liner traffic has been increasing
throughout the 1990s as a result of determined marketing of the port and
the shore-side attractions. In Miami and other tourism fairs, and
visitor numbers this year are expected to set new records.
So far 17 cruise liners have confirmed a visit to Invergordon in the
Cromarty Firth as part of their itinerary this year, with the highlight
being the Clyde-built Cunard Liner QE2, which arrives on September 4th,
the largest liner to call at the port so far. But according to Gordon
Ireland, Ross and Cromarty District Council's Tourism Development
Officer, even the QE2 will be dwarfed by liners to be built over the
next few years.
''A new generation of liners is being built, and there are $8.5
billion (dollars) worth of ships on the order books, for 1995 to 1998.
Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines is building two liners of 70,000 tonnes
each in France. One of these, the Splendour of the Seas, which will be
launched in 1996, will come to Invergordon in August 1996, its inaugural
year.''
Last year, eighteen liners, carrying 6761 passengers called at
Invergordon, with an estimated boost of quarter of a million pounds to
the local economy. But the Cromarty Firth will see an average increase
in liner size this year, and passenger numbers are expected to rise by
33%. Holland America Line's ''Statendam'' at 55,451 tons, which called
in at the port last year, was the largest passenger liner ever to call
at the port. That honour will pass to the QE2, at 69,000 tonnes in
September.
''We're having to make a lot of arrangements for parking, closing
roads and street entertainment,'' said Gordon Ireland.

LEADING architects and businessmen yesterday attacked the use of the
Mr Happy logo on Glasgow City Chambers.
They believe that the sight of the cartoon character on the
prestigious nineteenth-century building overlooking one of Europe's
greatest squares is tasteless and cheapens the city's image.
Mr Happy, used to promote the slogan Glasgow's Miles Better since the
early 1980s, is not sophisticated enough for the city which recently
beat off tough competition to become UK City of Architecture and Design
1999, they say.
Mr Gavin Stamp, one of Britain's leading architectural historians and
writers, said the spectacle of Mr Happy beaming down from the City
Chambers detracted from the building's standing.
The Chambers, he said, was an example of Glasgow's ability to erect
buildings of ''great intellectual distinction and dignity''.
''The Chambers is a wonderful monument of Glasgow's optimistic and
opulent years and people who visit the city are always terribly against
the 'Mr Happy' banner. It certainly takes away from the building's
prestige,'' he said.
Mr Happy represented the city from 1983 to 1989, only to be replaced
by the disappointing Glasgow's Alive slogan.
Last year, Glasgow council chiefs ordered Mr Happy to be dusted off to
highlight Glasgow's friendly image.
It was revealed yesterday that, by the end of the month, the
character's smile will be miles bigger with a 60ft by 40ft picture of
him on the Possilpark gasometer.
The Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland admitted the
majority of its members in Glasgow and throughout Scotland were
disappointed the slogan was not more in keeping with the city's recent
accolade.
However, a council spokeswoman dashed any hopes of the character's
disappearance.
She said: ''Have these people no sense of humour? Mr Happy is bright,
bold, down-to-earth, and encapsulates the fun side of the city. He
cheers people up.
''The Chambers is appropriate for the poster because of its
prominance.''

BELL'S Bridge over the Clyde in Glasgow swung open for the first time
in three months yesterday. The bridge had been jammed since flooding
from the River Kelvin damaged the retaining river wall in December.
Repair work, which initially had been the subject of argument between
the Glasgow Development Agency, which owns the bridge, and the
management of the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre, which has
responsibility for the quay wall, has taken only nine days.
The way is now clear for the world's last sea-going paddle steamer
Waverley, which has been trapped at her berth at Anderston Quay upriver
of the bridge, to sail down to Garvel dry dock at Greenock next week to
undergo essential re-fitting work in preparation for her coming season.
Mr Gordon Wilson, contracts manager for Lilley Construction who
carried out the work at an estimated cost of #20,000, said: ''The work
was very carefully thought out well before we moved on to site. As a
result, our team came up against no real problems when they came to
tackle the job.''
The general manager of Waverley Excursions, Mr David Duncanson, said
last night: ''We are delighted. The Waverley is expected to leave her
berth on Tuesday and we should have no difficulty meeting our schedule
of work at the dry dock in Greenock to allow us to make our first public
trips of the season on the Clyde over Easter weekend.''

THE Government and Railtrack yesterday reaffirmed their ''absolute
commitment'' to the modernisation of the West Coast Main Line which they
hope will result in high-speed tilting trains moving between London and
Glasgow in a little over four hours.
However, they are still reluctant to put any money up front and expect
industry to fund the project which, it is now revealed, could cost up to
#2000m excluding the cost of new rolling stock.
Railtrack yesterday invited ''expressions of interest'' from companies
wishing to tender for the #30m to #50m contract to develop the
revolutionary transmission-based cab train control system which would
replace existing track-side signals.
This week it will apply for European Union funding for up to 50% of
the development cost, and project director Nick Higson said he thought
there was a very strong chance of the project attracting EU funds.
The reward for the successful company or companies would be the
opportunity to have a major role in providing the system which forms the
base of the #1000m ''core investment programme''. They would have the
opportunity to sell their product on to WCML and then on to the
world-wide market.
A lot of interest already had been shown and it was hoped that the
industry would fund all or part of the development itself as the
potential rewards later were so great. Contracts should be awarded at
the ''back end of the year''.
Railtrack chief executive John Edmonds said he was confident the new
concept would work and that it would lead to tremendous financial and
operational benefits including greatly improved safety as the new system
includes the automatic train protection system which has been declared
too costly to ''bolt on '' to existing track and rolling stock.
Mr Higson stressed that in addition to safety improvements the key
benefits would be improved comfort and reduced journey times.
The problem of the British rail system having a different gauge to the
rest of Europe also would be solved within the modernisation of WCML
which would then be opened up to some of the larger continental freight
wagons currently unable to use much of the UK network.
The opportunities for trans-European rail traffic would be greatly
increased, declared Mr Higson, adding that this should improve the
chances of EU funding.
The state of the art signal system reduces cost and replaces 56 signal
boxes and puts four electrical control rooms into one location. It also
will make the rest of the modernisation far easier.
It can be developed off line and be constructed in tandem with the
existing system with the final changeover made only once the new system
has been tried and tested.
Radio-based, it allows speed and distance to be monitored and opens
the way for faster running, up to 155 mph, and a higher frequency of
services.
According to Mr Higson, the eight-year modernisation programme would
put the WCML into a very good state of repair, make it a major player
within the European rail network, and drive technological benefits that
should give British industry a major foothold in rail developments world
wide.
Railways Minister John Watts commented: ''The West Coast Main Line is
one of Railtrack's most important assets, and is critically important to
both passenger and freight services. The modernisation of the line will
be one of the largest railway investment projects in decades.''
* Scottish business organisations agreed yesterday to unite in a
campaign to protect Scotland's railways in the light of the threat to
sleepers to Fort William and Motorail.
All the main organisations participated in the meeting held in Glasgow
and Scottish Enterprise, Highland and Islands Enterprise, the STUC, and
Cosla sent observers.
A business liaison group was set up and is seeking urgent talks with
the Scottish Secretary and his Minister for Roads and Transport at which
to air business's ''grave concerns about the future of the Scottish rail
network''.

A SELF-CONFESSED speed fanatic last night voiced surprise at the
leniency of a sheriff's sentence after he admitted driving at 143mph --
more than double the speed limit -- on a stretch of road in the Borders.
Sales representative Charles Young, who was fined #250 and banned for
one year, said he had expected to be jailed.
The 27-year-old, who had appeared at Peebles Sheriff Court, was
driving his firm's #50,000 car when police clocked him using the Vascar
radar system.
It is thought to be one of the fastest speeds ever recorded on
Scotland's roads.
Young was caught driving a red Mercedes sports car at 143mph on the
60mph A703 Penicuik to Peebles road last September.
Traffic policemen had been unable to pull him over until he slowed
down to just 60mph.
Young, of Peebles Road, Penicuik, Midlothian, yesterday admitted
driving dangerously.
His defence agent, Mr Andy Crawley, claimed it was a fit of madness.
Sheriff Nigel Thomson, who also ordered Young to resit his test, told
him it was the highest speed he had ever dealt with and had been a
''quite appalling'' act of driving on ''a notoriously deceptive piece of
road''.
Young, who had no previous convictions, admitted later he had been
''unbelievably stupid'' to drive so fast.
He said he had been lent the car by his bosses to travel to England on
business and simply could not resist the temptation to test it out.
''Anyone who knows cars knows the Mercedes Benz sports car is one hell
of a powerful machine. My love of fast cars just got the better of me.''
Road safety campaigners yesterday reacted with fury to the #250 fine
and ban.
Mr Eddie McColm, whose father was killed in a road crash six years
ago, called for a minimum five-year driving ban for excessive speed
drivers.
Mr McColm, of Stevenston, Ayrshire, who is a member of the Scottish
Campaign against Irresponsible Drivers, said the Scottish courts were
not doing enough to deter drivers from speeding. And he accused the law
of being too ''driver friendly''.
Last night Young's boss at Mercedes dealers, Western Automobile
Company, Edinburgh, refused to comment.

SIXTEEN people were arrested yesterday in the most serious clashes so
far over opposition to the M77 motorway link in Glasgow on a day when
roadbuilders Wimpey claimed it ''successfully'' completed its
tree-felling programme.
One police officer and a protester were slightly injured and were
taken to hospital. Scottish Militant Labour convener Tommy Sheridan was
among those arrested.
The police officer sustained knee and back injuries after being
crushed against a fence. His condition is not thought to be serious. A
protester had a head injury after being hit by a falling branch during
tree felling.
The arrests of 14 men and two women for mainly ''disorder offences''
were made next to the so-called Pollok Free State camp, set up by
protesters. It is anticipated they will appear at Glasgow Sheriff Court
today.
Strathclyde Police had drafted in about 250 officers in an early
morning operation to ensure that road builders could continue to fell
trees. Wimpey, the contractor for the #56.3m link, also brought in about
200 security personnel to ''allow work to progress''.
Contractors moved in to ground next to the camp about 6am to fence an
area off and clear away about 40 trees. Police stood guard inside the
fences throughout the day. An outer cordon was provided by security
officers.
Ms Lesley Bolton, a veteran campaigner in protests at Greenham Common
and the M65, said about a dozen protesters secured themselves high in
trees by abseiling over the fencing via connecting ropes.
She claimed ''hordes'' of police had stormed an area next to the camp
in an attempt to ensure that the tree-felling operation proceeded
smoothly.
Throughout the afternoon, a number of protesters were persuaded down
from their positions until 6.30pm, when the police officers and security
guards were stood down.
At that point, one man, who would only give his name as Jack, remained
up a Scots pine several yards away from the main area of trees.
Despite several attempts by foresters to persuade him down, rebuffed
on one occasion when the man tipped a bucket containing what appeared to
be urine over a forester, it was decided to leave him in position whilst
the tree's lower limbs were stripped.
Mr Dan Pollard, roads director for Wimpey, said: ''After a further
survey of the line of a diversion road, we decided to leave that tree in
place. The limbs were stripped to ensure that drivers have a clear line
of sight round the curve.''
One campaigner, Ms Donna McAtamany, 29, from Pollok, claimed her
one-year-old daughter Deborah was probably saved from serious injury by
local man Glen Pollock, 30, who suffered a head injury after being hit
by a branch that fell during tree cutting. She said: ''The branch that
injured him just missed my baby's pram.''
Asked if she was being irresponsible in bringing her daughter to the
area during such operations, Ms McAtamany replied: ''It is my
one-year-old that is going to be living here and breathing in the
pollution that will result from this new motorway. She will have to live
with the environment that remains.''
Strathclyde Police later dismissed Ms McAtamany's claims, saying that
she ran towards the incident after the debris had fallen, placing her
child and herself in danger.
One protester taunted police and security staff by holding a
full-length mirror in front of them and urging them to ''see yourselves
for what you are'' while others danced nearby.
The protester also focused the mirror on police video cameras, which a
spokesman said were there to provide evidence in the event of complaints
against Strathclyde officers, whom he also applauded for their refusal
to react.
Wimpey's Mr Pollard claimed that work on the M77 extension was still
on schedule to be completed by the end of next year but conceded that
the protesters were costing the company money -- the complexity of the
operation had involved the company ''tying up a lot of senior staff''.
He said there were no plans to uproot the camp because it was not on
land designated for the extension.

A HOSPITAL has dropped controversial plans to let the MacDonald's
burger chain open a branch in its grounds.
The board of Southern General Hospital Trust in Glasgow reached the
decision after consultation with staff, community representatives, local
MPs, and police.
The two parties had been unable to reach a business agreement. A
spokesman said last night there had been a number of factors, one of
them financial. He appreciated the professional way in which the chain
had negotiated.
The original proposal, to let MacDonald's open in the hospital's
retail shopping precinct in place of the existing Red Cross tearoom, led
to protests regarding the nutritional value of fast-food fare, and about
the security implications of having the restaurant open in the evening.
However, the board said they had set out to develop services in line
with responses from visitor and patient surveys which expressed a desire
for an extended range of catering facilities, with extended hours and
capable of handling promptly larger numbers of customers.
The hospital's own in-house catering unit will take over when the Red
Cross lease expires, pending further consideration by the trust of
future strategy for the retail food outlets.

MR DEREK Hatton, the former deputy leader of Liverpool City Council,
was yesterday found not guilty of stealing a #45,000 horsebox.
Mr Hatton, 47, and his co-accused, Mr David Godsell, 39, who was also
cleared, were both discharged at Manchester Crown Court.
The jury cleared the pair after deliberating for more than five hours.
The foreman said they had reached verdicts on which at least 10 of
them were agreed following the direction earlier by Judge Rhys Davies,
QC.
Mr Hatton, of Wavertree Gardens Suburb, Liverpool, was found not
guilty of theft and attempting to obtain an insurance claim from the
Norwich Union.
Mr Godsell, of Crumpsall, Manchester, was found not guilty of theft
and aiding and abetting the insurance claim.
After the verdicts, Mr Hatton turned to the jury, smiled, and said
''thank you''.
During the eight-day trial, the prosecution said that after Mr Hatton
fell behind with payments for the horsebox, the finance company which
had provided it, Forward Trust, began steps to repossess the Ford
Iveco.It was alleged that the two men moved the vehicle to a secret
location so that agents working for the financiers could not find it.
Mr Hatton allegedly submitted a false claim for the horsebox after
reporting it stolen.
However, the court heard he had denied the allegations when
interviewed by police, claiming Mr Godsell hid the vehicle because he
was owed money by Mr Hatton for repairs carried out on it.
During the trial, counsel called no evidence on behalf of the two men.

HIGHLAND Regional Council is pursuing legal action to try to prevent
the withdrawal of Motorail and Fort William sleeper services before
there has been full public consultation.
ScotRail's incoming managing director John Ellis warned yesterday that
if the action was successful, and he was forced to run these services
without additional financial support, ''it would mean serious
difficulties for other Scottish services''.
Mr Ellis was in Inverness to address a meeting of the Institute of
Directors but his first call was at Highland Regional Council's
headquarters, where he met the convener, Mr Duncan McPherson, and
vice-convener Peter Peacock.
The councillors emerged from the meeting saying they could delay no
longer and would now pursue legal action.
Mr McPherson said: ''There were moves within Cosla to initiate legal
action but that would take time and we can't wait.
''We are the transport authority most affected and we are taking
counsel's opinion on the best way forward to ensure the continuance of
these services after May 27.''
They are seeking advice as to whether they should seek an interdict,
judicial review or try some other course.
Mr Peacock said they had impressed on Mr Ellis the difficulty that
people now had in dealing with the railway industry. ''When you ask a
question you are immediately told it is somebody else's
responsibility,'' he said.
Scottish Office Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton made it clear
yesterday that the Fort William sleeper service is unlikely to be saved.
The Government is still fighting a rearguard action but at Commons
Scottish Questions the best that could be done was to put a gloss on the
situation.
Lord James said the new Euro-sleeper service between Glasgow and
Paris, to be introduced next year, could be timetabled to connect with
daytime services to Fort William.
The Minister said: ''The franchising director has undertaken to look
at timetabling flexibility in daytime connections and that will be
important for day services to Fort William. These services will tie up
with other services, including the new sleeper service between Glasgow
and Paris to be introduced next year.''

A YOUNG couple, found dead in a neighbouring flat to the one in which
the body of a convicted child molester was discovered last month, may
have died from an overdose of painkillers.
Police officers had to break into the home of Mr Steven Charleston,
26, and his wife Karen, 25, at Southhouse Medway, Edinburgh after
relatives became concerned after they had not been seen for a while.
The couple's three-year-old daughter Charmaine is being looked after
by Mr Charleston's mother. It emerged yesterday that Karen Charleston
was not pregnant as had been reported.
Police have ruled out any link to the alleged killing of neighbour
Lawrence Leydon, 36, found dead last month.
The full results of the post-mortem examinations being carried out on
the couple are expected to take some time.
* Earlier this month, Mr Paul Strathearn, 33, of Buchanan Street, off
Leith Walk, appeared on petition at the city's sheriff court charged
with Mr Leydon's murder. The case was continued for further inquiries
and Mr Strathearn was remanded in custody.

A LEADING member of the Scottish business community will today join
the SNP and urge others from industry and commerce to follow him in
backing the independence cause.
The former head of salmon farming giant Marine Harvest, Mr David
McCarthy, an Englishman, supported devolution but concluded it was an
unnecessary halfway house.
The party regards it as a major coup and a boost to its electoral
credibility across the country. SNP leader Alex Salmond said last night:
''The SNP have had some very well placed business supporters in the past
but none has been in a position to stick their heads above the parapet
and go public.
''None has felt able to nail their saltire to the mast, so David's
decision is very important. I hope it will be a rallying point for other
people in the business community who feel like him.''
Mr McCarthy, who describes himself as a former Labour voter, was born
57 years ago in Kent and educated at Winchester and Oxford. He has had a
high-flying career spanning more than 30 years with Unilever.
After heading its operations in Malaysia and Chile, he was posted to
Scotland as chairman and managing director of a subsidiary, Marine
Harvest, the world's largest salmon farming company.
He spent eight years in the job until a takeover last year.
Mr McCarthy retired in December and lives in Kinross, where he
recently decided to apply for membership of the SNP.
Asked what prompted him, he said: ''Partly it was the offence against
democratic principles of having Scotland run almost as a colony by the
Conservatives without democratic support.
''I was a 'soft' Labour voter and supporter of devolution but the more
I thought about it the more I thought it was an unnecessary halfway
house, a re-run of 1973 which had more to do with Westminster retaining
power than giving power back to the people of Scotland.''
Living in Scotland had made him conscious of its sense of nationhood
and that the energies and talents of the people were such that they
could go it alone in a much more mobile world in which people had
increasing cross-border links.
Another clinching factor for Mr McCarthy has been his experience
abroad and more recently in dealing with Ministers and officials at the
Scottish Office and in Brussels. The former admitted privately they were
hamstrung by London, the latter made clear that only sovereign nations
were listened to.
''I do think I am probably somewhat in the van here,'' he said.
''But I have noticed over the last few years that there has been a
change in attitude in the business community. Over the next couple of
years, I expect more and more people to think this way.''
Mr Salmond agrees and believes the ''Conservative hold on the business
community is loosening. David's stance will be an inspiration to others
to look more pro-actively at the issues and the possibilities.''

THE brain haemorrhage which left Davie Cooper fighting for his life
last night is likely to have been the result of an aneurysm -- a weak
spot in an artery which people can carry in their head for years like a
time-bomb.
A sudden bout of exertion, even jumping out of bed first thing in the
morning, can trigger a rupture which may leave the victim dead or
disabled.
Doctors are expected to decide today whether an operation is necessary
to stem or clear the flow of blood which burst into the inner lining of
Cooper's brain. They will be in no rush to do so unless the situation
demands it.
Last night, still unconscious, he had already undergone a series of
scans to determine the extent of the damage. Of vital importance will be
the pressure being put on his brain by the swelling in the bleed area,
and the danger of an early recurrence.
If he recovers he may still require extensive rehabilitation to
restore some of the functions -- movement, speech, or thought -- which
could be affected by his condition.
A subarachnoid haemorrhage is a bleed into the area between the middle
and inner of the three membranes, the meninges, which line the brain.
Whereas bleeds in the outer areas -- subdural or extra-dural -- are
usually the result of an injury, a subarachnoid bleed tends to occur
spontaneously.
Professor David Graham, a consultant neuropathologist at the Southern
General Hospital, said: ''An aneurysm forms at a point of weakness,
often where an artery in the brain forks in two.
''Over time they get bigger, and at 5mm-6mm, for haemodynamic reasons,
the risk is greatest. Physical exertion tends to raise blood pressure
and then it would burst.
''Exercise or atheroma can weaken the wall and predispose it to burst.
Sudden exertion, like leaping out of bed as soon as you waken, can be
enough to burst it.
''In many instances investigation and treatment gives some hope. The
prognosis is more favourable if the patient is conscious, and can move
his limbs, but he could require an operation.''
A massive bleed leading to prolonged unconsciousness is more
dangerous, and a third of people who suffer cerebral anuerysms die at
the scene or within a week of the initial bleed.
For those who survive, the prognosis is good. They may suffer
after-effects akin to those left by brain injury, but specialist help in
rehabilitation has become more widely available in recent years.
Ms Lynn McLeish, manager of the Scotcare Brain Injury Rehabilitation
Unit in Bonkle, Lanarkshire, said: ''The treatment we give is tailored
to each individual patient and their condition; there might be weakness
down one side, speech and memory impairment, loss of planning ability
and concentration, and physical or psychological problems.
''The treatment could include physiotherapy, speech or occupational
therapy, and psychological and psychiatric report; the aim is to get the
patient back to as independent a life as possible.
''Cerebral aneurysms are so unpredictable -- you can walk around with
one all your life and never know.''
More than 8000 Scots die every year from cerebrovascular disease, but
60% are ischaemic strokes in which a blood vessel is blocked by a clot
brought on by atherosclerosis or high blood pressure. Mortality rises
steeply from the mid-40s on, whereas haemorrhage extends more widely to
younger age groups.
A subarachnoid haemorrhage ended the playing career of Welsh rugby
star Mervyn Davies, then 29, when he collapsed during a scrum in 1976.
He recovered but not sufficiently to return to the game.

IN the health-conscious nineties Scottish parents are continuing to
ignore the advice of experts by passing on to their children all the bad
diet habits of the past, a new report published yesterday confirms.
Chips, junk food, and sweets are tops amongst the underfives in
Scotland. Their intake of vitamin C and carotene, from fruit and
vegetables, is less than anywhere else in the UK.
Tooth decay is a more serious problem for toddlers in Scotland than
anywhere else in Britain -- even though Scottish dentists are more
likely to recommend fluoride drops or tablets than their colleagues
elsewhere in the UK.
So what is new? Yet another survey has shown that Scottish dietary
habits are appalling compared with the rest of the country.
Thanks to the James report, published last year, this is a
well-recognised phenomenon in Scotland and steps are being taken by the
Scottish Office and others in an attempt to address the problem.
However, yesterday's findings -- concentrating as it does on children
aged between 18 months and four-and-a-half years -- highlights the fact
that Scottish parents are ignoring all the publicity concerning the
importance of diet.
They are carrying on feeding their children the same kinds of food
that they themselves like despite its likely contribution to the high
level of heart diesease in Scotland.
It would appear the message is not getting through.
''Children in Scotland were most likely to be eating chips, beef and
beef products, canned fruit in syrup and drinking soft drinks and were
least likely to be eating cheese, most types of vegetables, and drinking
fruit juice,'' the report declares.
Despite the findings, the report concludes that today's toddlers are
well nourished, taller, and -- perhaps less surprisingly -- in some
groups heavier than in the sixties.
The National Diet and Nutrition Survey was commissioned by the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food and the Department of
Health. It was carried out by the Office of Population Census and
Surveys and the MRC Dunn Nutrition Unit.
''The results of this excellent survey will be used to develop
long-term strategies for improving the health of children and setting
good eating habits for life,'' Baroness Cumberlege, a junior Health
Minister declared.
''I am certain that general practitioners, health visitors,
paediatricians, and others responsible for advising about health and
development of pre-school children will be able to make good use of this
data.''
The appended dental report, highlighting the high level of tooth decay
in Scotland amongst the under fives, left dentists more than slightly
annoyed. ''Parents should realise that dentistry is free for
under-fives,'' one of them said.
''They should also restrict sweets and confectionary to meal times and
make sure the children brush teeth regularly.''

AUTHOR Douglas Sutherland yesterday sued two firms of solicitors over
their alleged negligent handling of a royalties dispute with his
publishers, Debrett Peerage Ltd.
Major Sutherland claims that #81,764 in royalties was due to him for
the years 1978-84 for his humorous series, The English Gentleman, The
English Gentleman's Wife, The English Gentleman's Mistress and The
English Gentleman's Child.
His counsel, Mr Mark Living, told Judge Young at the High Court in
London that between 1983 and 1988, Mr Richard Sykes, of Halkin Street,
Victoria, London, handled Major Sutherland's action against Debrett.
At the end of 1988, Tucker Turner Kingsley Wood and Co, of Chancery
Lane, London, took over the matter until 1990.
Major Sutherland, of Bridge House, South Queensferry, West Lothian,
then engaged another firm but they were unable to do much before the
action was struck out for want of prosecution.
Mr Living said Mr Sykes showed a very ''lackadaisical'' attitude and
it was that firm's greater negligence which set up what followed.
The firms deny negligence and claim they were not provided with
sufficient information or funds to pursue the claim at the material
times.
They say it was not an action worth pursuing because Debrett had an
answer to Major Sutherland's claim and would not have been liable.
The hearing continues.

<HEADLINE>Blair puts duty first. Challenge to the Tories. Labour leader puts duty first in challenge to the Tories.</HEADLINE>

LABOUR leader Tony Blair put a dagger at the Prime Minister's heart
last night in a watershed speech based on the concept of duty.
Mr Blair, in a lecture set up by the right-wing Spectator magazine,
also focused on the prospect of pragmatic politics to match the
philosophy of a new generation. He claimed: ''The mood for change now in
Britain is more than about opinion polls or feel-good factors. It is a
belief that, as a country, we can be better than we are.''
He proposes that parents should be prosecuted for their children's
truancy as should citizens who make themselves objectionable by their
bad neighbourly behaviour such as loud noise, violence, intimidation or
racism.
He concedes the Marxist strand of Labour thinking was dangerous and
misleading and ill-founded.
He challenges the Tories to match his vision in the run-up to the
Scottish local elections next month and those in England in May. He had
already warned his Shadow Cabinet to be prepared for a General Election
this autumn as, as he puts it, the Tory Government disintegrates.
The Labour leader intended it as a watershed speech in the
philosophical political debate for these election contests to come.
It sidelined the Tory troubles over their nine MPs who are still off
the Government whip. They met last night for an hour in the Commons but
came to no decision over rejoining.
Mr Blair cut through this argument as a peripheral matter. ''The
Conservatives believe their problem is one of division. It is not. The
fundamental problem is lack of direction.
''They don't know where they are going. Until the direction is
resolved, the division will remain.''
The Blair vision outlined in The Spectator Lecture entitled, The
Rights We Enjoy Reflect the Duties We Owe, was delivered in the
knowledge that he will have solved the Clause 4 reform debate on
nationalisation at his special conference next month, and was addressed
to stealing the remainder of Mr Major's political clothes.
Duty was his keynote. Duty of the individual to the society in which
he lives -- which, delivered, gives the citizen a right of a duty from
the society to him.
''This is much more than a debate about words or rhetoric,'' he said,
despatching the Bennite Marxist left. ''In this sense, those opposed to
change are right when they say it goes to the very soul of the party.
But, so far from destroying our soul, it retrieves it.
''It rescues the left of centre from a false historical perspective
which linked it to a Marxist intellectual analysis. It broadens its
appeal beyond producer or class interests.
''It reaffirms the Labour Party as the keeper of the faith in certain
key social and political values, which define it from the left and
distinguish it from the right.'' Rewriting Clause 4 is an essential part
of the transformation of the Labour Party for Government.
Mr Blair was moving his personal performance as party leader up
several notches with the confidence of a man who is in full control of
his party and ready for Government.
His lecture last night pinpointed the Prime Minister's problems in not
being able to speak with quite the same authority. Mr Blair had already
confided to his Shadow Cabinet that an autumn election was still
unlikely but they must be ready for it with policy and presentation to
attract the disenchanted Tory voters.
It was a personal challenge to Mr Major to put his stamp on his own
party, right and left, Euro-sceptic or Europhile, and take the
consequences.
''For far too long, the Labour Party allowed the Conservatives to own
vast expanses of political territory to which they had no prior claim
and whose resources they largely squandered. It is time to reclaim the
ground and send the Conservatives into the nomadic existence they
deserve.''
The key challenges to a Labour Government he defined as: ''How we
modernise the country's economy to equip it for today's market and
tomorrow's. And how we move people from welfare to work, eliminating the
social evil of welfare dependency amongst able-bodied peoples.''
This stated, he declared that he is obsessed, not about people's
personal lives (ie the sleaze factor in Tory politics), but about their
duties to one another as citizens.
In a powerful passage, he condemned crime and vandalism, children's
access to drugs in school playgrounds, teachers assaulted by pupils, and
youngsters wandering homeless on the streets.
He contrasted this with the ''massive salaries paid to the few at the
top, whose income seems little related to company performance or
merit''.
For the last two decades, the Conservatives regarded the notion of
duty as their own but now neither seemed to understand it nor to act
upon it. Duty was an essential Labour concept at the heart of creating a
strong community or society.
Without it, freedom turned to ashes.
On that theme, he said : ''Parents have a duty, to their children and
to others affected by their children.'' He supported local authorities
who are taking action against parents on truancy.

TWENTY-FIVE striking Bulgarian seamen were sitting tight on board a
Klondiker last night after a judge refused to order their eviction.
Lord Clyde decided at the Court of Session that he would need further
and more clear information before taking the extreme step of ordering
the men off the MV Rotalia which is berthed in Lerwick Harbour,
Shetland.
Continuing the case for a week, the judge said: ''I take the view that
it would be too violent to throw out the crew today without being
satisfied of their being aware of their legal position.''
The court was told that Bourgwells (Bulgaria) Ltd, shipowners and
charterers based in London's docklands, bought the Rotalia, a stern
trawler and fish factory, from its previous Bulgarian owners, Okeanski
Ribolov.
There was a dispute with the previous owners over wages, with the
result that the crew had gone on strike and taken possession of the
vessel at Lerwick.
Bourgwells has already obtained a court order to prevent the 25 men
from obstructing a new crew from taking control of the Rotalia.
Mr Robert Howie, counsel for Bourgwells, said his information was
that, last weekend, the new crew had made three attempts to board the
vessel but these efforts had been repulsed by the strikers.
The view had been taken that discretion was the better part of valour
in the face of what might have been violent opposition and Bourgwells
was now asking the court for an order to have the 25 removed from the
vessel.
The Rotalia was needed urgently for a contract to catch and process a
substantial quantity of fish off Namibia.
Mr Howie disputed a claim by Mr Ralph Smith, counsel for the crewmen,
that under the sale of the vessel, Bourgwells was to pay the outstanding
wages owed to the crew.
Mr Smith explained that because of language difficulties it had been
difficult to obtain clear information.
Lord Clyde said he was not persuaded that the facts of the case were
sufficiently clear to enable him to take the relatively extreme remedy
of granting the eviction order at this stage.
He continued the case for seven days in the hope that communication
could be established between the two sides.
No doubt it could be explained to the 25 crewmen that there was
already an interdict in place and unpleasant consequences could follow
any breach of such a court order.

LABOUR has a 32% lead over the Tories, according to a poll published
today -- and Mr Tony Blair's approval rating is the highest since he
became party leader.
A Mori survey for The Times puts Labour on 57% (compared with 58% in
late February), the Conservatives on 25% (24%) and the Liberal Democrats
on 13% (14%).
The poll shows 51% are satisfied with the way Mr Blair is doing his
job (48% last month) while 21% are dissatisfied (22%). Among Labour
supporters, 70% are satisfied and 10% dissatisfied.

BLACK township leaders in South Africa yesterday called on the Queen
to give back the Great Star of Africa diamond which is set in the Crown
jewels' sceptre.
The Azanian People's Organisation claims the diamond was ''stolen from
the treasures of the African soil''.
Azapo spokesman Zithulele Nxawe said: ''She must be reminded that the
diamond belongs to the black people of this country, and to them alone.
''The imperialistic Queen should know she is persona non grata until
she has corrected all previous and current wrongs.''
He was speaking ahead of the Queen's visit to New Brighton, a
sprawling black township near Port Elizabeth in Eastern Province.
Security for the visit has been stepped up after chaotic scenes on
Tuesday at Langa, a township outside Cape Town, where the Queen was
mobbed by excited youths.
The Great Star of Africa was bought by the Transvaal Republic from the
Premier Mine and presented to King Edward VII in 1907.
A Buckingham Palace official said the diamond was a gift, Crown
property, and ''part of the inalienable heritage of the nation''.

KEEN interest is being expressed by several companies concerning the
future of a new 20,000 sq ft factory building at Cumnock in Ayrshire,
intended to be one of the centrepieces of the town's new Business Park
development.
It is another aspect of the renaissance way in which Cumnock has
changed almost beyond recognition in mich less than a decade.
''Anyone who has been away from Cumnock for even a few years would
find it hard to believe how much of a change has taken place,'' said
John Walker, Director of Property and Land Development with Enterprise
Ayrshire. ''Forget the old image of a depressed and worn-out former
mining town left with only a legacy of high unemployment.''
Cumnock has been turned around, thanks to recent and massive
programmes of economic development. In the past seven years around #100m
has been spent in Government funding, topped by EU assists. Ten
sponsoring partners, including, Enterprise Ayrshire, the Cumnock and
Doon Valley Initiative and Strathclyde Region have been hard at work in
a co-ordinated programme ever since 1989.
''Our overall target has been to regenerate the local economy,
integrated with social objectives,'' said John Walker at Enterprise
Ayrshire headquarters at Kilmarnock. ''Today's Cumnock has a lot going
for it and for any organisation that decides to locate there. It has a
high quality and skilled workforce, it is within half an hour of key
motorway links and air and rail connections, and considerable strides
have been taken towards increasing the prosperity of local people and
businesses.''
The Business Park, Cumnock's latest asset, is located on the south
side of the town overlooking the Cumnock-Auchinleck bypass. A 15-acre
site, already fully serviced, it adjoins the established Caponare
Industrial Estate.
''The new Business Park has been developed by Enterprise Ayrshire and
the local district council at a cost of #1.5m,'' said John Walker. ''It
already houses a similar size of factory for Afton Spring Plc, producers
of bottled spring water, who will move into a shortly from other
premises in Cumnock.
''The key 25,000 sq ft unit that is attracting so much interest is an
excellent building with quality finish and a glass frontage, and is
fully landscaped. Enquiries we have received so far have included some
from electronics supply companies and firms associated with the textile
industry.''
The quality of Cumnock's workforce is another attraction. Since the
Initiative's conception, the amount of industrial sites in the area has
been expanded with over 50 units being let or re-let and more than 500
jobs being attracted or safeguarded.
''All the new companies now located in Cumnock have been delighted
with the quality and reliability of their new workforces,'' said John
Walker. ''One reason is that there has been a heavy investment in
training. Ayr College has established an annexe in the town providing
training in various branches of textile production. We have also
established comprehensive training in electronics. Young people are
among the many taking full advantage of these courses and looking
towards the future.''
Cumnock, fighting back against a 17% unemployment rate, is fast
recovering from the scars left from its mining past. Only occasional
reminders now persist from that time -- one is the A frame structure
from the former Barony Pit, which is to be retained as a listed
structure.
In and around the town a series of major changes reflect the
development programme which has already been carried out, with other
work still in progress. Another proposed future development will be a
major refurbishment of the main shopping centre area.
''There are other obvious attractions for new businesses thinking of
coming to Cumnock,'' said John Walker. ''Cumnock is a development area,
with maximum Government incentives available for any project. Looking
further ahead, plans for the Business Park include further development
on about 10 acres of adjacent land, offering ideal locations for
individual companies.
''New arrivals already in Cumnock have been delighted with what they
have discovered from enthusiastic local authority support and the skills
of local workers to the wide range of amenities that are on offer in the
area. The latter range from fishing on stocked reservoirs to golf at New
Cumnock and at Mauchline -- and remember that Cumnock is only half an
hour away from the major shopping centres of Kilmarnock and Ayr and the
other attractions, including theatres, that both can offer.
''From a business viewpoint, that same half hour of travel will take
drivers to the M74 and the way to the markets of the south. Prestwick
and Glasgow Airports with their freight or passenger links are also
within easy reach. ''
From its location on the A76 Kilmarnock-Dumfries road, the former
mining town has built itself new foundations for a very different
future.
''Much of the work to date has been about putting into place the
various building blocks required for economic regeneration,'' said John
Walker. ''Private and public sectors have worked closely together to
achieve a common objective, a future of real economic growth built on
partnership.
''Cumnock has very definitely changed. Now it is going forward.''

ACTRESS and model Elizabeth Hurley told a court yesterday how she was
robbed at knifepoint by four teenage girls as she walked home on her
own.
Miss Hurley, 29, said she was ''stunned'' to find herself surrounded
by the girls, one of whom held a six-inch knife an inch away from her
stomach.
She gave them #10 but one of them sneered: ''Is that all you've got?
That's not enough . . . we can't even get some Big Macs with that,''
Southwark Crown Court heard.
She said she found herself ''fenced in'' by the girls, who formed a
semi-circle around her, forcing her back against a pillar.
Ms Christina Guerrina, 18, of Bethnal Green, east London; Ms Carlene
Irving, 18, of Shepherd's Bush, west London, and a 17-year-old girl, who
cannot be named for legal reasons, deny robbing Miss Hurley of #10 and
some photographs.
A fourth girl, also 17, has pleaded guilty to robbing her and will be
sentenced later.
The girlfriend of Four Weddings and A Funeral star Hugh Grant was
mobbed by photographers as she arrived in a red BMW to give evidence.
She looked flustered as she struggled through the melee to the court
but quickly composed herself in the witness box, looking relaxed and
confident as she gave evidence for 90 minutes.
She flew in earlier from New York where she had been on a photo shoot
for Estee Lauder after signing a #3m contract with the cosmetics
company.
Miss Hurley told how she had been walking home from her office in
South Kensington when she was attacked last November.
She told the jury her route home from work took her along the Old
Brompton Road towards Earl's Court.
As she turned left into The Little Boltons, close to the flat she
shares with Mr Grant, she heard loud female voices behind her.
Turning, she saw four girls walking close behind. She stood aside to
let them pass but when she crossed the road into Redcliffe Square, they
suddenly veered towards her.
Miss Hurley said she later darted behind a car and ran into the road.
Then she saw a large white van coming towards her, and caused it to
stop. The driver ''leapt out'' leaving the engine running.
He sprinted towards the girls while Miss Hurley stayed by the van. She
said a woman, seeing what was going on, came out from a nearby house and
gave her a cup of coffee.
0 Prosecuting counsel Richard Onslow alleged that all the girls had
behaved aggressively towards Miss Hurley. They were arrested and taken
to Chelsea police station, where they made no comment.
Mr Robert Coloves, defending Guerrina, put it to her that when she
made a 999 call on a mobile phone given to her by a woman from a nearby
house, she described her attackers as two white girls and two black
girls.
Miss Hurley said: ''Maybe I did in the heat of the moment. I was in a
blind panic by then. The adrenalin hit me and I was shaking like a
leaf.'' He also said she told police her purse had been stolen and she
had been threatened with a penknife.
The trial continues.

ALMOST exactly two years ago, Brian Duffy was, in his own words, ''a
young, naive and very inexperienced would-be business person''.
Today he is the technical director of his own thriving electronics
firm.
Dakon Electronics, designs, develops, manufactures and distributes
electronic products. To begin with, all it had was a series of product
ideas. ''At the time, we thought our business ideas were a 'sure
thing','' he said.
''Every new or young business needs expert help or advice if it is to
survive in this world. Support is required, not only in financial terms,
but in terms of good solid business advice in all the areas it needs
it.''
For him, this support came from Glasgow Opportunities, one of the
organisations which form part of the newly launched Glasgow Business
Shop Network. It will provide the necessary help and advice to get
fledgling businesses off to a good start.
The Glasgow Network is part of the Scottish Business Shop Network,
launched last year, which with Glasgow Opportunities, helped Mr Duffy
formulate and stick to a business plan, and obtain the financial advice
and assistance he needed.
''Through the huge wealth of experience available through all the
support agencies in the city, Dakon has been able thoroughly to examine
and form its plans in great detail,'' he said.
''At Dakon Electronics, through the benefit of all this advice and
experience, we have been able to look objectively at our business, with
the result that we now know we're on a sure thing.''
For the new business man or woman the list of questions they need
answers to may seem endless and to cover almost every subject from
accounts to grants to VAT. This is well understood, as Crawford
Beveridge, chief executive of Scottish Enterprise, pointed out in a
business start-up guide prepared by the Scottish Business Shop Network.
''In the early days it can be challenging and downright difficult,
especially if you've been used to an employer looking after tax,
National Insurance, legal requirements, VAT and a thousand and one other
details that must be attended to,'' he said.
''The Scottish Business Shop and the network of local enterprise
companies can't keep your books for you, but we can help make your
journey to being a successful small business much smoother.''
It is easy to be distracted from these essential administrative duties
for the best of motives. ''When you start your own business your
enthusiasm and energy is often directed at the actual business,'' he
said.
''While this is the central point of going into business, you must
devote much of your time, at least at the beginning, to attending to the
details of accounts, legal requirements, finance, marketing, premises,
staff and so on.''
The Business Shops offer a wide range of support for the business
newcomer, and can put them in touch with the right people in local
government, the professions, libraries, chambers of commerce, Government
departments, and any other relative organisation.
As Brian Duffy concluded, ''It is only by working together that we can
achieve all our goals and ambitions.''

SINN Fein could be involved in ministerial talks with the Government
by the weekend, its senior party strategist Martin McGuinness claimed
last night.
As unprecedented disarmament talks between loyalists and Northern
Ireland Office Minister Michael Ancram ended in Belfast, Mr McGuinness
said he believed his party could be in discussions as early as Friday.
He said: ''There is an international expectation we move foward to the
next stage. There must be meetings between political representatives of
the British Government and Sinn Fein.''
He added: ''Sinn Fein is prepared to discuss anything -- including the
decommissioning of weapons.''
Although the Government insisted last night that Sinn Fein had not
given sufficient assurances to clear the way for ministerial dialogue,
it now seems the two sides are getting closer to reaching agreement for
the next stage of the peace process to begin.
Mr Ancram, following four-and-a-half hours of exploratory discussions
with representatives of the Progessive Unionist Party and the Ulster
Democratic Party, also hinted that an end to the deadlock with
republicans might not be far off.
He said: ''They (Sinn Fein) are moving towards giving us assurances
but, as of this time, we have not received clear assurances, which we
have made abundantly clear we require before a Minister enters
exploratory dialogue with them.''
Yesterday's talks with loyalists went ahead after the Northern Ireland
Office said they were satisfied with assurances about the
decommissioning issue, despite the fact representatives made clear their
position on the decommissioning of weapons had not changed -- no guns
would be surrendered until they were satisfied the environment was right
and there was trust on all sides.
Mr Ancram's decision to move into ministerial contact with the two
loyalist fringe organisations was announced just over an hour before the
sides were due to hold a scheduled meeting at Stormont.
It was taken up almost entirely by the decommissioning issue but the
Minister was left in no doubt that the Protestant paramilitaries are not
even considering handing in weapons.
Instead there were discussions about the logistics of such moves.
Mr Ancram said later that the whole basis of exploratory dialogue was
to achieve a method which is going to secure trust -- not just between
Sinn Fein and the loyalists, but across the community in Northern
Ireland.
He said: ''We are looking at a process which can achieve concrete
results. The loyalists have provided us with those assurances. They said
they would discuss constructively and positively the elements of
decommissioning. We await to hear similar clear assurances from Sinn
Fein before a Minister can become involved with them.''
Sinn Fein's Northern Ireland chairman, Mr Mitchel McLaughlin, said he
was confident his party would be in ministerial talks soon, adding: ''We
are not the obstacle.''
Reiterating Mr McGuinness's assertion that talks could start as early
as Friday, he told BBC Radio 4's PM programme he welcomed the Government
discussions with loyalists.
''I think they should have happened some time ago, and similarly with
Sinn Fein,'' he said. ''It's a question of when the British Government
recognises the right of those people who vote for Sinn Fein to have
their voices heard.''
Meanwhile, 440 soldiers flew out of Northern Ireland yesterday in the
first major withdrawal of troops since the IRA ceasefire began seven
months ago.
It is expected that the highly symbolic withdrawal of the 5th Regiment
Royal Artillery will be followed shortly by a second battalion, if the
ceasefire holds.
Commensurate reductions in the RUC and the Royal Irish Regiment will
become inevitable.
The troops later arrived at RAF Leeming, North Yorkshire, and boarded
coaches to take them to their home base at Marne Barracks, Catterick, to
be reunited with their families.
The regiment, which had been based at Drummad Barracks, in Armagh,
left a month ahead of schedule because of the scaled-down security
threat in Tyrone and Armagh.
* Irish police have uncovered 20lb of Semtex explosive during a search
in a borderside county.
The find was made on Tuesday night near the County Cavan village of
Mount Nugent. A detonator and a pistol were discovered at the same time.
A man held for questioning about the find was released yesterday.
The Semtex and other weapons were thought to have been stored in the
area by the IRA ahead of their ceasefire declaration last summer.

<HEADLINE>Kray tells of doubts over brother's death</HEADLINE>

REGGIE Kray claimed last night there was ''conflicting'' evidence
about the cause of his twin brother Ronnie's death.
He suggested he may have died after a ''struggle'' as he resisted a
hospital test involving the insertion of a tube down his throat.
Kray, who rang a radio station last night to talk about his doubts, is
demanding a second post-mortem examination on the body of his brother.
''I'm not saying that this did take place but there is always a
probability when people don't like things being put down their throats,
so a struggle could have ensued,'' he told Talk Radio UK.
''This is an assumption but I feel that I have reason to doubt.''
Ronnie Kray, 61, suffered a heart attack and died last Friday after
being rushed to hospital from Broadmoor where he was serving life for
murder.
East Berkshire coroner Robert Wilson held his inquest a day later
without telling the press and public and reached his verdict of death by
natural causes in less than three minutes.
Reggie Kray, who is also serving life for murder, claimed last night
the full facts have yet to emerge.
In a telephone call from Maidstone prison, he said his brother's
doctor at Broadmoor, Dr Jose Romero, had told him Ronnie was physically
strong and his death had come as a shock.
''He said he had seen him shortly before the date of death and this
made him more shocked as he didn't visualise him dying from any known
cause.
''So there is a lot of doubt in my mind and then I heard about this
inquest that only took three minutes and was very rushed . . . (that)
put even more doubt in my mind,'' Kray said.
The gangland killer claimed he had been told by another doctor that
his brother received a massive blood transfusion, which he said had been
kept secret until now.
He said Ronnie had no history of heart trouble and added that there
was also a suggestion that his brother had an ulcer and had suffered
internal bleeding, which had not been ''mentioned''.
''There is a conflict in my mind and in the facts as I've been given
(them),'' he said.
He has already announced that he is postponing his brother's funeral
until ''the situation has been sorted''.

<HEADLINE>Chancellor defends Pennant-Rea</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, tried to persuade Mr Rupert
Pennant-Rea to stay on as Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, it was
revealed yesterday.
Mr Clarke put up a staunch defence of Mr Pennant-Rea and said it was
''absurd'' he had been hounded out of office by stories about his
private life.
However, the Chancellor, who has ultimate responsibility for the post,
failed to hold sway over Mr Pennant-Rea, who announced his resignation
on Tuesday after his mistress revealed their three-year extra-marital
affair.
Mr Clarke said: ''I personally did not see any reason for him to leave
public life. I made it quite clear to him as far as I was concerned he
could stay -- absolutely clear.
''It's absurd to lose a Deputy Governor of the Bank of England because
some newspaper wishes to print stories about his private life.''
Downing Street stressed later that the Government had not asked Mr
Pennant-Rea to quit and all resignations were a matter of regret.
However, its tone towards Mr Pennant-Rea, 47, was distinctly cooler
than the Chancellor's vigorous support.
The former deputy governor remained tight lipped as he returned to the
Bank to clear his desk. As the search began for a successor to his
#180,000-a-year post, bank officials insisted he would not receive a
''golden handshake'' -- despite reports of a settlement which could
reach #500,000. He will get a maximum payment of #45,000.
The woman involved in his downfall -- Mary Ellen Synon -- denied she
was motivated by personal gain in going public over their affair.
Her kiss-and-tell confessions in a Sunday newspaper led to the
resignation.
American-born Miss Synon, 44, said yesterday: ''I have neither asked
for, nor received, any money for talking to any newspaper.''
Miss Synon, an Irish-based freelance journalist, said: ''Despite what
has been written in the newspapers, I did not much want Rupert to lose
his job.''

The Scottish business shop network was launched last year with a
purpose to bring together those involved in developing the Scottish
economy. Sean Francis reports on the initiative that gives Scottish
businesses access to a wide range of business and commercial
information.
KNOWING whose door to knock on when you need help with your business
is easier if there is only one door. Making all the help available
behind one door is effectively what happened this week when a new
business initiative was launched.
The initiative brings together sources of advice which are all too
often spread out and, as The Herald reported on Tuesday, the purpose is
to provide information on all aspects of business, from start-up to
finance.
''It brings together the three main funders of economic development in
the city: Glasgow Development Agency, the City Council, and Strathclyde
Region, and adds the Chamber of Commerce with its unique access to the
private sector,'' said the GDA's Russell Simpson.
''These organisations have joined together not to create another
organisation but to enhance and develop the existing organisation's
abilities to assist our business clients.''
It is, however, only part of a bigger network. The Scottish Business
Shop network was launched in April last year to link all organisations
involved in developing the Scottish economy. The aim was to give
business a service which was both cost-effective and consistent.
Regional partnerships were formed between the economic development
bodies responsible for supporting companies in their area. More that 100
public sector organisations are involved, including regional councils,
district councils, chambers of commerce and local enterprise companies.
These partnerships help to ensure the service provided in each region
reflects local needs and to reassure customers that all the main
business service providers are involved.
The Scottish Network will be represented by individual business shops
operating within host organisations. Every business shop which wants to
join the network must be accredited to ensure consistent service.
Accreditation will be granted only after the shops have proved they
have the necessary systems and standards, and are committed to
continuous improvement. The sign of accreditation is the SBS Gateway
symbol.
Mr Simpson described this week's launch as ''a Glasgow response to a
Scottish-wide initiative''. There are nine shops in Glasgow, hosted by
organisations with roots in their local business communities, including
Glasgow Opportunities, Glasgow North Ltd, East End Partnership, Gorbals
Initiative and the Govan Initiative.
So that everybody who wants to can have access to a business shop, the
network has been extended so that it will also provide services via
Greater Easterhouse Development Agency, Castlemilk Economic Development
Agency and Drumchapel Opportunities. These agencies will become fully
accredited shops as demand for their services increases.
What distinguishes the business shop network is the fact that it is a
network. It draws from all sources to provide concise information from
just one location. The client gets the right information and advice
without having to contact each individual provider.
Those providing assistance will receive clients who know more about
the type of help they need and will receive fewer inquiries from people
they cannot help. It will mean scarce resources, including time, will be
used more efficiently.
The business shops have access to Companies House and the Patents
Office, and via the hub shop in Bothwell Street they can access services
from the Government Business Shop, including help on VAT, health and
safety, arbitration and conciliation services.
There is another advantage. ''It will give us, the organisations
charged with economic development in the city, information on what the
customer needs,'' said Mr Simpson. ''This information will enable us
accurately to develop solutions accordingly.''
He said it would add significantly to their ability to help businesses
in Glasgow.
Professor Donald Mackay, chairman of Scottish Enterprise, added: ''The
network offers existing and potential Scottish businesses
quality-assured and consistent access to a wide range of business and
commercial information.
''I believe that in this way, the network is an invaluable link
between the customer and the many sources of information and assistance
in Scotland.''
Herald editor George McKechnie, who officially launched the new
network, stressed the importance of matching the information to the
inquiry.
''The new business shop network in Glasgow embraces the improvement of
support for all sections of business from start-up to small, moderately
successful companies seeking growth and even more spectacular firms
hammering out plans for expansion,'' he said.
''The main idea is to cut out confusion and save the business person
time and effort when making any kind of inquiry, whether it's about
start-up funding or guidance on exporting. It is also a good example of
the way in which public and private sector can work together for the
benefit of everyone.''

FORMER Scottish internationalist footballer Davie Cooper was fighting
for his life last night after suffering a brain haemorrhage.
The player, who celebrated his 39th birthday last month, was said to
be in a ''critical'' condition at the Southern General Hospital in
Glasgow after collapsing at Clyde FC's Broadwood Stadium near
Cumbernauld.
Shocked members of his family and the Scottish football community were
last night praying that man who was regarded as one of the most gifted
wingers in Scotland at the peak of his career would recover.
Doctors at the Southern General -- who say he is suffering from a
subarachnoid haemorrhage and is deeply unconscious -- were attempting to
stabilise his condition in the intensive care unit of the hospital's
Institute of Neuro-Sciences.
They carried out a number of brain scans and placed him on a
ventilator to help him breathe, and may operate today.
Cooper's general physical condition -- he was regarded as very fit for
his age -- is not expected to have any significant bearing on his
chances of recovery because of the depth of his unconsciousness.
His girlfriend, Elizabeth Thomson, 32, and other members of his family
were maintaining a bedside vigil at the hospital last night.
Miss Thomson, who is a fitness instructor in Hamilton, said at the
hospital last night: ''We are all in a state of shock. It is absolutely
devastating, but we know Davie is getting the best medical care.''
Her mother, Mrs Lorraine Cameron, 62, had tears in her eyes when she
said at the couple's Hamilton home: ''We are just waiting and hoping for
good news. The one thing we know about Davie is that he is a fighter.''
Davie Cooper -- who was capped 22 times for Scotland and played for
Rangers and Motherwell before returning to Clydebank, his first club --
was due to retire from the playing side of the game at the end of this
season.
He was helping to coach a group of 14 schoolboys on football skills
for the Scottish Television programme Shoot, due to be screened later
this year, when he collapsed on an Astroturf pitch adjacent to Broadwood
Stadium.
Celtic star Charlie Nicholas, who was also coaching the boys from
local schools, together with Scotland under-21 coach Tommy Craig and Tom
Black of Kilmarnock, said they had been ''completely numbed'' by what
had happened.
Speaking from his Glasgow home, Mr Nicholas said they had been
coaching the children on how to take free-kicks and were rehearsing
their lines for the cameras when Mr Cooper slumped to the ground.
He said: ''Davie had just asked me if I fancied going for a pint when
we were finished, and I said that sounded like a good idea. I turned
away and then when I looked back he was on the ground.
''We are all so shocked. Davie looked after himself and was very fit
for his age. He didn't smoke and was not a heavy drinker and he looks
the same way at 39 as he did when he was 30.''
Mr Ian Hamilton, of Scottish Television, who was directing the filming
of the programme, went to Mr Cooper's aid when he collapsed and
attempted to give him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation until an ambulance
arrived.
Clyde manager Mr Alex Smith, who was taking about 20 of the club's
players through a training session inside the 6500 all-seater stadium at
the time, was alerted and was also very upset.
Medical staff who were already at the stadium for the coaching session
gave Mr Cooper first aid within a few minutes and he was taken by
ambulance to Monklands District General Hospital in Airdrie before being
transferred to the Southern General.
A hospital spokesman added last night that neurological surgeons were
not yet able to speculate on the player's chances of survival because
this type of haemorrhage was ''totally unpredictable''.
They had sought first to stabilise him and then to establish the cause
of the bleeding and were hopeful that his condition would remain the
same until this morning, when a decision on whether to operate would
possibly be taken.
Members of the close-knit Scottish football community were last night
praying for the man who earned the nick-name Super Cooper during his
illustrious career. Hibernian manager Alex Miller said that his team's
match against Motherwell yesterday ''paled into insignificance''
alongside the news of his illness.
Motherwell players, some of whom played with him in the 1991 Scottish
Cup Final, heard the news en route to Easter Road.
Mr Jack Steedman, managing director of Clydebank FC, where Cooper
began his career, said everyone at the club was devastated.
''Davie took the Clydebank training on Tuesday night and there was no
suggestion of this terrible thing.''
He added: ''Davie was first signed by the club when he was 18 from
amateur side Hamilton Avondale and is very much a fixture at Kilbowie
Park. So much so that one of our stands is named after him. He is not
just a player. He is a member of the family.''
Mr Walter Smith, the manager of Rangers, said everyone at the club
wished him a quick recovery. Rangers captain Richard Gough added: ''It's
hard to believe that this has happened to Coop.''
Davie Cooper spent 12 seasons at Ibrox after Rangers bought him from
Clydebank for #100,000 in 1977 and won a host of honours.
A spokesman for Scottish Television said: ''Davie is effectively an
employee of ours, because he does a lot of sports analysis on programmes
such as Scotsport and during big football matches.
''Everyone is devastated, especially the boys in the sports
department. Our thoughts and our prayers are with Davie and his
family.''

LAWYERS representing families in the Ayrshire child abuse case were
accused in the Commons yesterday of trying to ''intimidate'' MPs.
Labour MP George Foulkes (Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley) protested
in a point of order that an attempt was being made to stop him looking
after the interests of social workers who were his constituents.
He told Speaker Betty Boothroyd: ''Some of the lawyers representing
families in the Ayrshire child abuse case have been quoted in the press
as saying that MPs should not raise matters on behalf of their
constituents.
''I represent seven of the social workers involved.
''I consider the action taken by these lawyers is intimidation to me
-- trying to stop me performing my role as their MP.''
Mr Foulkes asked: ''I would hope you would make it clear that not even
the most distinguished Scots lawyers can stop MPs from looking after the
interests of their constituents.''
Miss Boothroyd told him: ''I am sure you aren't intimidated by any
such comment made outside the House.
''All Members here have a duty to carry out their responsibilities on
behalf of their constituents and they will certainly do so while I am
Speaker of this House.''
The case concerned eight children taken into care five years ago amid
allegations of ritual sex abuse. They were told last month they were to
be returned home after a High Court ruling.

<HEADLINE>Milk not E-coli source, says lawyer</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>
<PAGE>5</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979255635</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
TOP-QUALITY milk from a farm has been dumped for the past 10 months
after it was wrongly branded the source of a fatal food poisoning
outbreak, it was claimed yesterday.
Solicitor Ken Hogg told Linlithgow Sheriff Court that Redhouse Farm,
at Blackburn, West Lothian, was now in serious financial trouble.
He said: ''The consequences have been extreme. Nobody will take milk
from this farm. They fear it is implicated in the E-coli outbreak -- and
that is rubbish.''
Mr Hogg was speaking after the farm's owners, Robert Findlay &amp;
Company, admitted failing to bury three cattle carcasses which were
found on the farm last May. Two of the carcasses had been partially
eaten by animals, and one was lying under a collapsed shed. There was
nothing left but the skeleton.
Mr Hogg said: ''They were waiting for the knackers' lorry to arrive.''
The company was fined #750 by Sheriff Anella Cowan.
Mr Hogg told how the Scottish Milk Marketing Board started dumping
Redhouse Farm milk after cattle were found dead on the farm by council
health experts, searching for the original source of last summer's
outbreak of food poisoning in West Lothian.
However, after November, when the board was scrapped by the
Government, the company could find nobody else to buy its milk.
Mr Hogg said the board had been paying a premium for Redhouse Farm
milk because of its high quality.
He added: ''My clients are producing milk every day. It is being put
into the manure and spread on the lands. There is a farm somewhere else
that has this E-coli problem. It is not my client's. That can be proved.
''But it is the Findlays who are paying the financial penalty. Milk is
their main source of income.''
After the case, farmer John Findlay, 43, claimed that he had lost
three-quarters of his income because of the milk scare.
He added: ''We have done nothing wrong and yet we are being
victimised.''
