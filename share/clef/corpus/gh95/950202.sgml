ALLY McCoist staked a claim for a first-team return against Dundee
United on Saturday when he hit two goals in Rangers' 3-0 reserve win
over Hibernian at Easter Road yesterday.
But midfielder Ian Ferguson lasted only 10 minutes after having taken
a knock and is doubtful for Saturday.
Gordon Durie opened eight minutes from half-time and McCoist netted
four minutes later. His second came from a penalty after Mark McGraw had
missed one for Hibs.
Also in the Rangers side were Fraser Wishart, Neil Murray, Ian
Durrant, and new signing Alex Cleland.

THIS spring sees the second anniversary of the establishment in
Edinburgh's Victoria Street of Iain Mellis's marvellous cheese shop. And
what better way to celebrate two immensely successul years than by
opening a second shop in Glasgow?
Very soon Glaswegians too will be able to venture into cool dairy-like
premises, shelved from floor to ceiling, every square inch stacked and
piled high with varying shapes and sizes and colours of cheese, and
every cheese different in terms of age and taste, texture and
consistency.
As at present in Edinburgh, all the cheeses will have been made by
hand from farm-produced milk, the final products a skilful blend of art,
science, dedication, and judgment.
These cheeses have all been made on farms throughout England, Scotland
and
Ireland, and have been assembled here by Mellis -- an unashamed
enthusiast for the best of farm-made cheeses, and passionate in his
commitment to making them available to Scottish consumers.
At his shop you can try any cheese, discuss your tastes and needs
(without being even slightly embarrassed about any lack of knowledge,
for Mellis is the friendliest of shopkeepers), and then buy some of the
40 to 60 cheeses which he may have in stock at any one time.
The only difference in the Glasgow shop will be that there will be no
need for the humidifier to be running constantly to maintain a humidity
of 85% -- conditions in the west are all too ideal for the successful
storage and maturing of cheese.
As a cheesemaker of 14 years' experience, it is in fact Mellis's skill
and experience in the nurturing of his cheeses which is crucial to the
success of his operation. All the cheeses he sells have come straight
from the farm to be stored for anything from a few weeks to several
months in order that they may ripen and mature and be in perfect
conditon to eat at the moment of sale.
He visits his cellars near Victoria Street in Edinburgh every day to
turn, wash, wrap, and re-wrap his cheeses.
It is as a frustrated traditional cheesemaker that Mellis has come to
be a successful cheesemonger. As a youngster in Inverness, he had always
been interested in food. But when he left school, instead of becoming a
chef he joined the North of Scotland Milk Marketing Board as a
laboratory technician.
When the opportunity to be involved in a more creative aspect of the
board's work arose, he grabbed it. He became a cheesemaker for the
board's Claymore Creamery in Orkney, at first making cheese in the
traditional open-vat way.
But by the end of his seven-year stint there, the traditional methods
had given way to the automated. So he looked elsewhere. He joined a farm
in Cheshire as cheesemaker but again, by the end of another seven years,
factory methods had supervened.
He decided to approach cheesemaking from a different angle. He spent
some time looking at cheese shops in France and looked at the way the
Neal's Yard Dairy in London's Soho conducted its operations, maturing
and selling home-produced cheeses to a public eager to learn more about
traditional British cheeses.
He reckoned the Scottish public were as ready as the English to enjoy
the resurgence in popularity of real cheese, and that he could remain
closely involved with the creative process by looking after the maturing
product.
He chose Edinburgh for his shop simply because he had more contacts
there, and he sold his house to provide capital for the establishemnt of
the business.
The first year he saw a turnover of #140,000 (double what he had
expected) with peaks of sales at Festival time and before Christmas. The
second year has seen a still higher turnover for his 365 days a year of
total commitment.
All week he is in his shop and in his cellars where the cheeses are
maturing; every weekend sees him driving to a faraway farm, anywhere
from Devon, Berkshire or Sussex in the south to Cork and Tipperary in
Eire, from Lancashire and Northumberland in the north of England to all
over Scotland, as far north as Orkney.
About 50% of his cheeses come from England, nearly 30% from Ireland,
and the rest from Scotland. When he picks up his cheeses he discusses
his customers' enthusiasms and tastes with the farm producers, many of
whom are tied to their farms and their stock and who therefore greatly
value this indirect contact with their consumers.
And Mellis can see at first hand the cows, sheep and goats on the
quality of whose milk the individual taste and excellence of the
different cheeses ultimately depend.
Most of the farm cheeses are unpasteurised and Mellis is keen to
scotch the myth that pasteurisation is the fail-safe way to avoid food
poisoning: in fact pasteurisation, by killing all bacteria both good and
bad, can allow easier ingress of harmful bacteria once the cheese is in
the making.
And lack of pasteurisation and of automation together do not
necessarily guarantee a good cheese:There are about 230 farm
cheese-makers in Britain and Mellis buys only from those whose cheese is
consistently tasty and good. Farm cheese making is not easy and requires
dedication, judgment, and skill.
Meantime back at the shop, and especially at his proposed new one in
the west, Mellis's main concern is to find equally committed and
enthusiastic sales staff -- people who share his delight in the
renaissance of interest among the public and want to extend it still
further by providing a service as excellent as the product is delicious.

CHELTENHAM &amp; Gloucester Building Society is to set aside #10m so that
widows of accountholders do not miss out from the windfall arising from
the takeover bid from Lloyds Bank.
However, this will only be effective if a Bill to change the present
restrictive rules reaches the statute book by August 1, the date the
deal is due to be completed.
At the moment those named second in joint accounts will receive
nothing under the takeover if the first named died during the qualifying
period of the two years to December 31, 1994. The same applies to
divorcees. The rule stems from the Building Societies Act 1986 which C&amp;G
maintains is flawed.
Widows and others stand to lose a windfall of up to #13,500. There is
currently an attempt under way in the House of Commons to change the act
to change the rule. Douglas French, Conservative MP for Gloucester, has
introduced a Bill in the Commons which will in his words bring
''fairness and justice'' to many people.
The Bill is due for its second reading on Friday after which it will
go to the committee stage.
A spokeswoman for C&amp;G said it was still ''touch and go'' whether the
Bill would become law in time for the August deadline but she stressed
the society was very supportive of it.
Chief executive Andrew Longhurst said: ''All we ask is to be able to
pay widows without delaying payment to all those members who qualify. We
will provide more than #10m of extra money -- whether the widows get it
is up to Mr French and the Government.''
If the bill proceeds to Royal Assent by the end of July then C&amp;G will
implement its #10m pledge and compensate the 5000 widows affected. The
widow of a first-named qualifying member on a joint account will receive
the same cash payment which the joint account would have received had
the first-named member survived until completion.
C&amp;G has not responded to calls that the vote on the takeover by its
members due on March 31 be delayed until Mr French's Bill does go
through. The society said this was impractical and would be to the
disadvantage of the great bulk of members.
''C&amp;G estimates that if, for example, the delay was of five months,
more than 7000 investors would die and so could never be paid. All
others would have to wait longer for their cash payments and feel their
funds were 'locked' up for longer,'' Mr Longhurst stated.

BARCLAYS BANK yesterday announced a deal to sell its US mortgage
banking operation which is expected to net the group about #31m. It has
signed an agreement for Norwest to buy the $15bn mortgage servicing
portfolio and back-up facilities of its Barclays American/Mortgage (BAM)
operation. Subject to regulatory approval, the acquisition is expected
to be completed in the next three months.
In 1993, Barclays reported a loss in respect of BAM of #236m,
including a special charge of #265m. At June 30, 1994, a profit of #4m
was reported after a charge of #26m.
Richard Webb, Barclays' chief executive (North America), said:
''Barclays strategy in the United States is to concentrate on serving
investment banking clients, particularly those whose requirements are
global. A mortgage servicing business does not easily fit that
objective.''

A MAJOR boardroom reshuffle planned at London &amp; Clydeside could well
initiate a complete transformation of the Glasgow-based housebuilder
into a much more dynamic company through the formation of a younger
management team.
Norman Chalmers is standing down as chairman after the annual meeting
on February 28 and will be succeeded by Peter Stevenson although he will
remain as a non-executive director for another year.
Founder director and managing director John McIntyre will step down in
a year's time unless a replacement is found earlier but again will
remain as a non-executive director and consultant for at least two years
thereafter.
Mr McIntyre, who appears considerably more youthful than his 66 years,
said that the strategy is to ensure the succession is planned in an
orderly way. That is being reinforced by estates director Rae Grieve and
technical services director John Swanson, both also aged over 60,
becoming non-executive directors and consultants to help maintain
continuity.
Mr Stevenson (47) has substantial financial expertise through his
experience gained at merchant bankers Noble Grossart. Over the 17 years
to 1986 he was one of the lieutenants who built it into a significant
financial institution before selling out to ''lead a more independent
life''.
He is currently chairman of Mackays Stores where he helped a major
turnaround in the clothing retailer's fortunes as well as being on the
board of Scottish Nuclear. He was a director of supermarket group Wm Low
before that was swallowed up by Tesco last year, and is also a director
of EFT.
The most important task is the appointment of a new chief executive
who should ideally come from the domestic housing industry -- the
appointment could be an internal one.
Mr Stevenson said that one would have thought ten years ago that L&amp;C
would have grown further than it has. But it is a good solid company
with a good balance sheet.
Mr McIntyre founded the company in 1973 with two partners whom he
bought out five years later. It went public in 1984 at 108p a share
compared with last night's closing price of 116p.
There has been some general disappointment at the lack of progress as
the company has avoided the worst of the traumas of the housing industry
recessions.
It has been too cautious, perhaps reflecting the Chalmer's influence
-- he was an accountant with Arthur Andersen. There have been talks from
time to time with English housebuilders as part of a policy of expanding
south of the Border but these never firmed into reality.
Last month L&amp;C reported a 90% increase in pre-tax profits to #1.4m
from sales of 260 houses built on 15 sites in the Central Belt and in
Aberdeen -- although expansion there will be more cautious in 1995.
Mr McIntyre controls 34% of the shares which raises the prospect of a
management buy-in although he is predictably keeping all his options
open at present.

CITY slickers as young as three months are spending their days in a
3500sq ft office suite in Glasgow's Baltic Chambers.
The opening this year of the first nursery in the commercial heart of
the city, ideally situated to accommodate the corporate boom on the
nearby waterfront, enables ambitious parents to climb confidently back
on to the career ladder.
Four Seasons Nurseries wants employers to include a contribution to
child care in employees' salary packages, to take advantage of tax
breaks. The nursery company's solicitors and accountants are currently
thrashing out a deal with the Inland Revenue.
For #95 per week, parents can leave their children in the hands of
trained nursery nurses and resume a five-day working week at nearby
offices, popping in to see their little ones whenever they wish. Four
Seasons charges #20 for a day and #10 for a half-day.
Interest in Four Seasons' contracted corporate programme has already
been expressed by the Trustee Savings Bank, which is locating at
Atlantic Quay, and the Ministry of Defence, which has offices in
Kentigern House on nearby Brown Street.
However, employers in Glasgow have, for the most part, so far been
slow to embrace the programme which is apparently booming in the US.
Only about 10 children currently take advantage of the host of
leisure, educational and culinary delights in the office suite and a
sizeable play area in the building's light well. Nevertheless, Four
Seasons ultimately hopes to look after between 64 and 70 infants between
the ages of three months and five years.
Director Avril Beattie said: ''It is building the awareness up more
than anything. Child care has just taken off in the private sector in
the last few years and I think it is quite unusual for companies to
participate in it in any way.''
A vacant office suite in Baltic Chambers, Cadogan Street, which
required only relatively minor modifications, provided the inspiration
for the project.
Back in 1900, when the building venture was completed by the Baltic
Chambers Company, 55 firms were plying a variety of trades in the block,
which was designed by architect Duncan McNaughton. Obviously a popular
corporate location in the early part of the 20th century, this number
had more than doubled to 115 by 1927.
With the help of co-owner, Glasgow businessman Ken Ford -- an investor
who takes no part in the day-to-day running of the nursery -- planning
permission was obtained, a lease signed and the office suite kitted out
for its new use.
Mrs Beattie, 24, a trained nursery nurse who has been in charge of two
other private sector nurseries, said: ''It is the first nursery in the
heart of the city centre and the location is the biggest part of it. I
think in this day and age you have to be encouraged to go back to your
work and it has to be made reasonably easy.''
Although still only in its teething stage, Four Seasons hopes
eventually to set up more city centre nurseries in the UK and Scotland,
possibly including another in Glasgow.

FAR from smoothing away my sharpest fears, the days since Rolls Royce
confirmed the closure of its aero-engine design facility at East
Kilbride and the loss of up to 600 jobs have simply served to deepen my
initial sense of foreboding.
At the time I focussed on the sheer quality of the jobs being lost.
Designers. Graduate engineers. Product development technicians. These
are the seed corn of any manufacturing economy which purports to be more
than a convenient assembly point, inside this tariff wall or that, for
other people's products.
Cast these precious skills to the four winds and the individuals
concerned may, in time, find alternative work. But the damage done to
the vitality of the Scottish economy by such dispersal does not bear
thinking about.
There is the immediate impact of 600 relatively high earners reining
in their patterns of consumption, with the inevitable knock-on effect on
service industries as diverse as the high street, the tourist trade and
the housing market.
There is the multiplier effect as local suppliers and contractors feel
the pinch. Studies are underway to establish the specific multiplier
impact of the Rolls Royce decision, with initial estimates ranging
around a multiple of three. That is, for every direct Rolls Royce job
going, another three outside jobs may now be at risk.
If such figures are confirmed, that is bad enough. But more corrosive
by far, in the longer term, is the loss of another local hub of higher
level skills -- the loss of research and design capability and local
product development.
In the mid-eighties, when the last City takeover boom was at its
height, all Scotland united in bemoaning the loss of corporate
headquarter functions here. The concern was not just that brass plates
were being taken down. With the loss of headquarter functions, it was
argued, go all the higher order activities which mark out an economy as
more than a source of plentiful, available, relatively-cheap labour.
The battle to retain corporate headquarters outwith London enjoyed a
brief fillip in the booming property market of the late eighties, when
soaring costs in London forced a number of major UK companies to up
sticks and move to the provinces. But recession seems to have put an end
to that.
In its latest listings of the UK's Top 500 companies last week, the
Financial Times included a map showing the postcode locations of each of
the 500 HQs. It is hugely illuminating and deeply dispiriting.
Within Scotland, Edinburgh now boasts 13 HQs from among the UK Top
500. Glasgow has nine, Dundee three, Paisley and Perth two apiece, and
Aberdeen one. Just 30 in total out of 500.
The massive continuing dominance of London is graphically revealed.
The London EC and London W postcode areas each boast 55 corporate
headquarters from the Top 500. London SW has 50, London WC 16, London NW
12, London SE 9, London E 7, and London N 3.
That's 207 of the 500. But it's not nearly the end of the story.
Postcode areas around London are also rich in major corporate HQs.
Reading has 13, Slough 12, Kingston-upon-Thames nine, Twickenham seven,
Guildford and Hemel Hempstead six apiece, Redhill five, and so on.
The major English metropolitan areas outwith London fare nearly as
badly as Scotland. Birmingham has just 17 of the Top 500 HQs. Manchester
boasts 11. Leeds and Bradford have nine apiece. Huddersfield and
Liverpool seven apiece. Newcastle six. Derby (the beneficiary of Rolls
Royce's East Kilbride closure) and Nottingham five each.
Even if the whole of the UK outwith the south-east of England must now
get by on a meagre diet of corporate headquarters, there was always the
hope that we could hold on to a reasonable share of other centres of
corporate excellence. The Rolls Royce decision has shaken even that hope
till it begins to unravel.
It isn't just Rolls Royce. In industry after industry, the inexorable
logic of increasingly intense global competition is pointing to
international joint ventures and other forms of transnational
cooperation as the only way to survive, particularly in markets where
the front-end costs of product development are higher than all but the
most financially robust corporations can stand.
In the two weeks since Rolls Royce announced the switch of smaller
engine design and development from Scotland to Derby and Bristol,
British Aerospace has revealed details of the shake-up in its regional
aircraft business, a tri-partite venture with French and Italian
partners, and naval shipbuilder Yarrow has warned of dire consequences
if its current order famine is not fed soon.
The aerospace deal has been widely heralded as the salvation of BAe's
Prestwick operation, where the Jetstream 41 turbo-prop is assembled, and
for all but 180 sales and marketing jobs there. The man behind
Prestwick, Allan MacDonald, has let it be known he will move on to
pastures new, either within BAe or elsewhere, this summer.
The deal may have been the best that could be done to rescue a heavy
loss-maker in a heavily over-subscribed marketplace, but I, for one, am
reserving my judgement on whether the salvation tag will prove apposite
in the longer term.
The new joint venture is to be headquartered in Toulouse. Prestwick
will go on producing the Jetstream 41, although no one seems too sure
when it will make money. But what happens after that? Who will decide on
successor models? Who will design them? Where will they built?
I am pleased that Prestwick appears to have a future. But it is far
from clear to me whether that future extends beyond the market lifetime
of the current Jetstream 31 aircraft.
Yarrow's future is complicated by the battle between owner GEC and
British Aerospace (again) for control of VSEL, the nuclear submarine
builder at Barrow in Cumbria. That contested takeover battle is
currently with the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Before that
referral happened, BAe was issuing dark hints that, if GEC got its hands
on VSEL, it would be curtains for Yarrow and, if Lord Weinstock then
targeted BAe, it would be curtains for commercial aircraft building too,
with Prestwick and other sites being put up for sale.
Well, Prestwick is now consigned to the mercies of a multinational
joint venture anyway. And now Yarrow is warning that, if it doesn't get
further frigate orders from the MoD and fails to land an order from
South Africa, it could be curtains anyway.
At both Prestwick and Yarrow, we are again talking of design and
development, and of significant numbers of high skill jobs. The Rolls
Royce disaster in triplicate.
You might have thought, given the scale of the threats, both real and
potential, to some of the most precious industrial jobs in the land,
that those who control Scotland's political and economic destiny might
be doing more to address the crisis and offer some lead on the way
forward.
Instead what we are getting is the talking up of prospects elsewhere.
Hints that distribution companies are queuing up to locate on enterprise
zone site at the Mossend freight terminal.
In the past couple of weeks I have listened to a number of very
frustrated business leaders in Lanarkshire who ask one very simple
question: ''How can you equate jobs moving washing machines, built by
people elsewhere, around a warehouse on a fork-lift truck with jobs
designing aero-engines or ships?'' The truth is you can't and that's the
tragedy we currently face.

THE Highlands could be in line for their very first casino after a
property swoop by Scottish investors.
Zone Bronze, whose directors already have a sizeable stake in the
Scottish entertainments industry, has snapped up a town centre hall in
Inverness for #320,000.
Now it is promising a seven-figure investment in a major
entertainments complex at the Highland capital's Rose Street Hall.
John O'Donnell, a spokesman for the company, said it was ''not ruling
out'' the prospect of opening a money-spinning casino in the Highland
capital.
He claimed the development at the former army drill hall could create
up to 100 jobs in the town.
He added: ''My clients hope to provide something quite startling in
Inverness. It is a very exciting project and the directors think it is a
wonderful prospect for the area.''
The building was sold to the company by Inverness District Council,
which plans to use the cash to help fund an ultra-modern indoor
water-sports centre at its Bught Park leisure complex.

A WEST Coast prawn fisherman has reversed the trend of Spanish
fishermen landing their catches in Scottish ports. He is taking his
catches directly to market in La Coruna in North-west Spain.
The new initiative involves transporting live prawns in a specially
converted ship to take advantage of the premium prices paid on the
continent.
The first few trips have proved so successful that those involved are
considering using a larger vessel to make the venture even more
cost-effective.
Murdo Macaulay, who comes from the south of Harris in the Western
Isles, broke new ground over a year ago by transporting live prawns in
specially designed boxes with tubular separators to continental markets.
The greatest problem before the boxes were introduced was that they
damaged themselves during the trip, making it difficult for the
fishermen to take advantage of the higher prices paid for live prawns.
Mr Macaulay said the idea had now been extended. ''The separation
boxes have been mass produced, and we put them in a refrigerated
seawater ship which was formerly used to carry herring and mackerel.
There have been a few modifications to the plumbing in the ship's hold
to ensure that seawater is pumped around the prawns during the trip to
keep them alive.
''We did the first run just after Christmas, and the round trip takes
10 to 12 days,'' he said.
The first few trips have yielded positive results. ''We sell the
prawns at auction in La Coruna, through an arrangement with a Spanish
company. The live prawns fetch around twice the price of the usual prawn
landings in this country.
''They are caught in creels, rather than in trawls, so only the big
ones are kept and sold. They fetch anything from #3 to #12 a kilo,
depending on the quality and market conditions,'' he said.
The initiative could also have an employment spin-off, since more
people are required to place the prawns by hand in their separation
boxes. The ship being used at present can carry seven tonnes of prawns
and 100 tonnes of water. But the Harris fishermen are looking at the
possibility of leasing a larger boat to transport the catch.
''We are looking at a ship that can carry 20 tonnes of prawns and 300
tonnes of seawater. This would make our trips even more cost-effective,
and increase the returns to the prawn fishermen,'' said Mr Macaulay.

AN INNOVATIVE Dumfriesshire company led by a former Hollywood film
producer has sailed into new waters.
Mariner launched a sophisticated board game for yachtsmen at the
International Boat Show at Earl's Court and at the Sail Scotland
exhibition at the SECC.
The game's designer Jill Vandebrand, who presented a copy to the
Princess Royal at Earl's Court, commented: ''Interest has been great and
there have been orders taken by admirers from over a dozen countries.
''The most bizarre came from a ranger at a Kenya wildlife park.
Apparently suitable games that will withstand the steamy heat of the
rainy season are hard to come by.
''The board game was designed to withstand salt water and will take
anything equatorial Africa will throw at it.''
It all began when Ms Vandebrand devised a board game for merchant
seamen during the Gulf War when she and her Swedish husband, Tomas, a
tanker captain, were sailing through the Red Sea with 355,000 tonnes of
high explosives.
''We realised we were in a situation where training was a matter of
life or death,'' she said. ''We were playing Trivial Pursuit and the
palatable way of learning about seamanship was born.''
The resulting board game, which is intended for both recreation and
training, was described by Lord MacKay of Ardbrecknish, the Minister for
Aviation and Shipping, as ''a very worthwhile and commendable
enterprise''.
Ms Vandebrand spent most of her childhood in Sussex but, after meeting
a screenwriter, she moved to the US where she worked in film production
for 17 years.
Roger Corman gave her a job as a ''gofer'' and she subsequently worked
in various production capacities on films including Death Race 2000, Eat
My Dust and Chattanooga Choo Choo.
The original Mariner game for merchant vessels entertains, educates
and encourages foreign crew members to improve their English. ''Merchant
ships are notorious for having people of all nationalities.
''The game teaches them English, the international language of the
sea. It also relieves boredom, offers a social forum, and at the same
time is a learning tool on navigation, first aid and other essential
subjects,'' she explained.
''Videos and other training concepts have their place, but you do not
get the same retention of information that you get with a board game
such as this.''
Mariner, made in Glasgow, Arbroath and West Lothian, has already been
taken on board the entire Esso UK fleet, 19 of BP's ships and 26 Mobil
ships.
Several Hamburg companies have also placed orders, as have a company
which manages a fleet of 11 ships in Singapore, Denholm's shipping
company in Glasgow and the Teekay shipping group.
The Mariner game is bound by bookbinders to withstand the rigours of
manhandling on the ocean wave.
Each player has a coloured ship, and he or she throws the dice to take
it on a voyage from Sri Lanka around the Pacific, south of Cape Horn and
then up the Atlantic Ocean to Ireland and beyond.
Questions are asked of the competitors in accordance with the colour
of box their ship lands on. There are 1300 in seven categories:
navigation and seamanship; emergencies; pollution and fire prevention;
meteorology and geography; history at sea; operations and engineering;
and first aid, health and hygiene.
The couple run their company from a remote farmhouse near Moniave, but
a branch will soon open in Govan in Glasgow. ''April Fool's Day will be
the first day of business, and it will be opened officially on May Day
-- hardly auspicious dates, although May Day is our wedding
anniversary.''

MONEY has started flowing into the Farmers' Creamery Co-operative as
the second stage of fund-raising gets underway to increase its stake in
the new company set to take over the Galloway cheese plant at Stranraer.
However, there are fears that the bid could fail if the Scottish Office
does not step in to help.
Ian Evans of Penkiln Farm, Garlieston, one of the leading members of
the campaign to save the Galloway Creamery which employed 130 people,
said #500,000 was the new target.
Originally about 500 producers throughout Scotland came up with
#750,000 and the Co-operative gave its support to the preferred bidders
A McLelland and Son, the Glasgow-based cheese company, and Murray
Vernon, the Cheshire-based dairy products firm.
''The offer to the receiver had to be increased because the largest
offer is believed to have been from a breaker,'' said Mr Evans. A New
Zealand company has put in an offer, hoping to break up the plant and
ship out the machinery.
''We have seen what has been happening over the holiday period with
tankers going to Ireland loaded with milk. Currently milk is being sent
south to plants in England and the haulage costs are going on to the
farmers.
''Things can only get worse when production of milk increases in the
spring, and so it is vital Stranraer opens up quickly.''
Talks have already started with the Scottish Office on grant aid, and
a decision is expected on the application within the next two weeks.
There are also fears that the bid could fail if the Scottish Office
does not come up with a suitable package.

THE most important preparation dairy farmers can make today is to
ensure their business is flexible enough to cope with change, David
Leaver, professor of agriculture at Wye College, said yesterday.
''Unfortunately, at present, technical objectives (especially milk
yield per cow) have overtaken business objectives on many farms,'' he
told the North West Dairy Conference at Preston. ''This could mean less
flexibility to change when it becomes necessary.
''The challenge to producers is quite simply to continue to satisfy
the personal objectives that each farmer has for his or her farm
business. This involves consideration of both technical and financial
matters. If, as many predict, the milk price does decline in real terms,
then such considerations will have an even greater priority.''
The successful dairy farmer of the future would have to be good at the
technical aspects of dairying, as indicated by the farm gross margin, as
well as at controlling overheads. Some aspects of technology, especially
in high input systems, drew in overhead costs such as power, machinery
and interest charges, he warned.
''The view that the future of dairying lies only with larger farms on
intensive high input/high output production systems is not only
questionable, but also naive,'' he said.
In general, raising milk yield per cow and raising the number of cows
carried would increase gross margins. However, it was essential to
consider the cost of additional quotas; the impact on overhead costs
such as feeding and feed storage; increased risk to the business from
price/cost changes, from environmental changes and animal health and
welfare problems.
In the past, he said, expansion of production had generally occurred
through increased cow numbers, and possibly through the acquisition of
more land. The current interest was in cow genetics and higher planes of
nutrition, leading to higher yields per cow. ''While this is interesting
and technically challenging to the farmer, it is doubtful whether the
cost/benefits have been calculated for present or possible future
price/cost scenarios.''
It was for the farmer to consider what production system he wanted to
use, taking into account the resources available and his or her own
interests and motivations. The emphasis then had to be on managing that
system efficiently.
Low cost production methods were outlined by Shropshire dairy farmer
John Downes, who suggested: ''If increasing production is difficult why
not improve profitability by spending nowt?''
He described his own two farms, each with approximately 100 acres in
arable rotation with clover leys down for up to six years. Since the
introduction of milk quotas production had increased to 5800 litres per
cow while concentrate usage had fallen from 1600kg to 1000kg, he said.
The introduction of fodder beet 10 years ago had been a significant
factor. More recently, up to 10kg per head of maize silage had been
offered to the milking herd of 110 Friesian/Holstein cows.
Conversion to the ''clover concept'' had so far had positive results,
he said. He had been able to reduce fertiliser costs and increase the
stocking rate. In order to increase fertility on one of the farms he had
built up a ewe flock, starting with predominantly North Country Mules.
They played a vital role -- grazing the clover leys as tightly as
possible during the mid-winter months to encourage the next year's
clover production.
Tim Fawcett, technical manager of AF feeds, said that in addition to
getting feeding right it was essential to provide suitable housing and
bedding. ''The most balanced of diets will not give optimal production
if a cow has to have her neck arched back on herself when laid in a
cubicle which is too small,'' he said. ''She will simply not be able to
chew the cud and ruminate as required. Too often too many of today's
cows are expected to lie in six-foot cubicles.''
The challenge to producers is quite simply to continue to satisfy the
personal objectives that each farmer has for his or her farm business.

OBSOLETE office buildings present one of the biggest problems for
Glasgow city centre business development, according to a report on the
city's office market by chartered surveyors Lambert Smith Hampton.
The firm's Martinmas report points to the large number of centrally
located buildings built during the late 1960s and 1970s. A number of
these are now the subject of planning applications for demolition and
redevelopment, but Mike Ryder of Lambert Smith Hampton predicts that
only the most central will succeed.
The others will have to find new uses -- such as the Charing Cross
Tower, previously the home of defence consultants YARD and now
completely refurbished as a YMCA Hotel offering budget accommodation.
''Regrettably, only a small number of these buildings are in prime
locations justifying redevelopment,'' says Ryder. ''For those on the
periphery of the city centre, innovative ideas must be applied and
Charing Cross Tower is leading the way. However, there is a limited
number of hotel rooms which can be filled.
''A further solution would be to adopt the American concept for 3 to
5-year lease terms where there is a rolling programme of
refurbishment.''
The report predicts that there will be an increase in the number of
companies seeking to expand their current premises in the city, but
their existing lease commitments will restrict many of them to
short-term accommodation in order to keep overheads down. This demand
will boost the take-up of second-hand accommodation.
The report estimates that total take up in Glasgow last year was
926,598sq ft, only marginally less than the peak between 1986 and 1990.
Most of the lettings and purchases were to companies moving and
expanding within the city, rather than to inward investors.

THE curtain is about to fall on Alhambra House, an ugly 1970s office
building which squats on the site of a famous former Glasgow theatre.
Its owners, Friends Provident, will demolish the Waterloo Street
eyesore and, for an encore, replace it with a speculative #12m office
development.
Full planning permission has been granted for the new seven-storey
building. It has been designed in a classical style with an exterior of
polished and sand blasted granite in contrasting colours and with bronze
coloured metalwork.
A major feature of the 95,000 sq ft scheme is the atrium which will
run throughout the interior. The building will have floor plates of
around 13,000 sq ft, raised access floors, and full air conditioning.
The current Alhambra House is occupied by the Industry Department for
Scotland, which will move out to the nearby Meridian Court building when
its lease expires in May. Development work will then begin immediately.
Alex Maclachlan, chief investment surveyor at Friends Provident, is
confident that the market is now strong enough to guarantee occupiers
for the building within the next couple of years. He said: ''We believe
there will be significant demand for such a quality, high specification
building as the economy continues to expand. It will be a big bold
building reflecting the mercantile tradition of the city and I'm
particularly pleased it will be ready in time for the City of
Architecture and Design in 1999.''
Friends Provident have been advised on the development by property
consultants Ryden.
Ewan Cameron, Ryden's partner in charge of Glasgow office agency,
said: ''The decision by Friends Provident to proceed with a scheme of
this size on a purely speculative basis is great news for the city. The
announcement will be of major importance to Glasgow Development Agency,
Locate In Scotland and other bodies who are actively promoting the city
to potential inward investors as well as existing indigenous
occupiers.'' He went on to say that the site is arguably the best
location for a development of this scale in the city centre.
The plan also includes car parking for 45 cars.

Meet two men who offer support to forward-thinking companies which are
planning for the future.
INNOVATION is one of the current crop of business buzz-words -- so it
is surprising that, in the whole of Scotland, only one leading
management consultancy has brought to the market a programme
specifically designed to encourage new ideas in manufacturing
businesses.
David Clark Associates would, however, argue that it is just such a
skill in developing programmes to meet a specific market need which has
seen the company show dramatic growth in fee income, now projected to
exceed #1m this year.
David Clark, who set up the company 17 years ago after senior
appointments with Baxters Foods, Cadbury's and Polycell, believes the
company's new product development programme, Developing Winners, which
was launched three months ago to an enthusiastic audience of 40
hand-picked businesses, is only one example of his company practising
what it preaches.
''Let's face it -- for many businesses 'consultant' is a dirty word,''
he says. ''The late eighties and early nineties saw a tremendous
proliferation of former personnel managers, sales managers and marketing
gurus setting up in consultancy for themselves, cashing in on their
specific field of expertise without any overall feel for what their
customers really required.
''We were clear right from the beginning that, rather than copy
programmes and products which had been around for years and were often
out of date, we would examine the market for ourselves, talk to the
local enterprise companies and businesses throughout the country and,
once we had found what gaps existed, develop the right kind of products
to fill them.''
The result is a tightly focused group of programmes which have found
favour with companies from Skye to Springburn and from Aberdeen to
Airdrie.
According to Ken Tod, Clark's fellow director, the Developing Winners
programme, designed to take a fresh approach to new product development,
is a perfect example of the DCA ethos.
''The launch seminar at Cameron House Hotel featured speakers from
companies such as AT &amp; TF, Linn Products, and Quality Street,'' he says.
''We were keen to involve people the delegates could relate to, and who
had first-hand experience of making innovation a reality.''
The idea seems to have been a success, with a wide range of companies
in sectors such as engineering, electronics, and food and drink having
signed up for the subsequent programme.
''Everyone talks about innovation and how Scots have a natural flair
for it'', says Tod: ''Examples such as John Logie Baird, Alexander
Graham Bell, and John MacAdam are always quoted but the simple truth is
that not enough companies in this country are providing the right
environment to encourage innovation. So we decided to fill the gap in
the market.
''Once we brought our ideas to the table we received support from
Strathclyde Business Development and the local enterprise companies in
Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire and Dunbartonshire, who, like ourselves,
recognised the need to improve the innovation rate of Scottish
companies.''
Further DCA activities designed to meet specific needs within Scottish
companies have also been developed and are running successfully in many
parts of the country, addressing problems such as the lack of graduate
recruitment and the relatively low start-up rate in Scotland, a problem
which DCA tackles through its innovative team-based business creation
programme.
According to Clark, with any consultancy programme there is a danger
of falling into the ''theory trap'', where the content bears little
relation to day-to-day business issues.
''That is why we only employ consultants who have worked at the
coalface -- people who have come from career backgrounds in national and
international companies where they have held board-level executive
positions,'' he says.
''This means they know how to analyse often difficult problems, devise
solutions, and then work with our clients to implement them
successfully.''
This approach, and the recruitment of senior executives from companies
such as Volkswagen Audi, Coates Paton, the Clydesdale Bank, and
Cadbury's, has seen DCA make rapid growth over the past few years.
Although recognising there are a number of areas common to most
businesses, DCA prefers to recruit people with sectoral expertise
combined with skills such as management development, marketing, selling,
and finance.
Currently, the portfolios of the company's consultants cover
industries including food and drink, construction, engineering,
information technology, tourism, leisure, and the professions.
With a total staff of more than 20, including 12 consultants, the
company is shortly to open offices in Aberdeen and Inverness to
supplement its Glasgow headquarters.
Clark, who still maintains a home base in Fochabers, says: ''Both Ken
and I are originally from the Highlands, and despite having our
headquarters in Glasgow we have always carried out a large proportion of
our work for firms in the North of Scotland and the Highlands.
''The problems faced by businesses in relatively remote areas of the
country often mean they require different solutions to those operating
in the Central Belt, and due mainly to word of mouth and working for
local enterprise companies in the area, our business has grown
substantially there in the past few years.''
In keeping with the company tradition of innovation, DCA is looking at
developing new consultancy-led programmes designed specifically with
Highlands and Islands companies in mind.
Clark adds: ''Businesses in these areas realise that, more than most
companies, they have to broaden their horizons and break into new
markets if they are to survive and grow. That requires change in how
they operate and are managed.
''Opening up the new offices should enable us to consolidate our
position in these areas and get to know local companies, and their
needs, even better.''

AEROENGINE group Rolls-Royce received a possible #50m boost yesterday
after Austrian Airlines chose the Fokker 70 powered by Rolls-Royce Tay
engines to spearhead its new regional fleet.
The order for four firm aircraft and four options has a potential
value, including spares of #50m to Rolls-Royce.
The first two aircraft will be delivered in September and October this
year with the remaining two in March 1996.
Austrian Airlines, a new Rolls-Royce customer, plans to use the Fokker
twinjets to destinations such as Geneva and Turin from its base in
Vienna.
In December, Tyrolean Airways ordered three firm and three options on
the Fokker 70s.
Austrian is the thirteen operator to choose the Fokker 70 which has an
order book of 44 firm and 19 option aircraft.

SHARES of the English electricity distributors fell back yesterday
following a report which suggested that the industry regulator would
make life difficult for bidders such as Trafalgar House, which is
offering #1200m for Northern Electric.
Northern itself fell 20p to 950p following a report that Offer, the
Office of Electricity Regulation, had proposed that the go-ahead for the
takeover should only be given if Trafalgar agreed to re-float 25% of
Northern on the stock market, so preserving its status as a quoted
company.
Regulator Professor Stephen Littlechild is believed to have told the
Office of Fair Trading, which is considering whether to recommend the
bid be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, that he would
be less able to act as Northern's regulator if it became 100% owned by
Trafalgar.
If it remained a public company, Northern would have to continue to
publish its results in the same way it does now, giving useful
information to the regulator. However, the proposal would mean extra
costs for Trafalgar which could well make the whole exercise not
worthwhile.
There was no confirmation of the proposal from Offer itself and
Northern said it knew nothing about it. Analysts considered the report
had increased the already strong likelihood that the OFT would press for
a monopolies reference.

STRATHCLYDE Transport Sprinter diesel trains don't normally get beyond
East Kilbride, Kilmarnock and Cumbernauld, in the normal course of duty.
But the familiar black and tan liveried units have been making tracks,
from a miniature depot in the heart of Glasgow, to Canada, the United
States and Australia.
For model rail enthusiasts Betty Ferguson and Irene Davies, joint
founders and owners of D&amp;F Models, have cornered the market in the tiny
diesels and have shown that, as Sprinter sellers, they're no sleepers.
''Five years ago, Lima, the Italian model train makers brought out an
'OO' gauge model of a Strathclyde Sprinter,'' explained Irene. ''We
found that it was a runaway success as local children recognised the
colours, and plenty were bought locally. But, what we also found out,
was that adults by the hundred descended on us, desperate to get their
hands on one of the trains.''
That has led to D&amp;F Models commissioning two subsequent production
runs of the Sprinters. ScotRail drivers have bought them wholesale, and
trade has been brisk in supplying collectors at home and abroad.
The greatest demand for the model trains has come from tourists and
expatriate Strathclyders.
''We've had tourists and foreign model rail fans buying them to take
something authentically recognisable as Strathclyde, home with them,''
said Irene. ''And I've posted off dozens to expats as far away as
Australia, who just want a little bit of home.''
And the D&amp;F Strathclyde Sprinters have also reached the buffers for
posterity. For ScotRail buried one in a time capsule last year, and
Strathclyde Regional Council mounted one on a plaque to present to the
Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, following a
visit to a planned rail re-opening at Larkhall.
''Now we're keeping an eye on developments affecting Strathclyde
Transport,'' smiled Betty. ''If the present PTE (Passenger Transport
Executive) does go with local government reorganisation, our models will
have become historical, and even more interesting to collectors.
''And, if the new set-up opts for a new livery for the present
Strathclyde Transport trains, we might look at bringing that out in
model form, too.''
And Irene is convinced that the Strathclyde Sprinters that aren't
confined to local rails, are good value for money.
''For #59.95 post paid, a two car set can be yours,'' she said.
''Where you drive it to is limited only by your imagination.''
Business watchers, with a sense of history, can celebrate the rebirth
of the Glasgow railway export industry. A model idea of good business
practice, some might say.

THE financial position at the Lloyd's of London insurance market
should show a steady improvement and losses in 1992 should have been cut
from #1170m in 1991 to #250m in 1992, according to forecasts by
independent insurance analysts Chatset.
It said, however, that the figure is calculated before so-called
deteriorations on ''open'' years -- claims filtering in from old
policies -- and transfers to reserves against further likely losses.
The 1992 deficit at Lloyd's rises to #1000m when this
''deterioration'' in previous years is taken into account, Chatset said.
Lloyd's, which has seen record losses in recent years, issues its
results three years in arrears and will announce the 1992 figures on May
16.
Chatset said the only area to make large losses in 1992 was the
non-marine sector which was thought to have lost #318m, largely due to
Hurricane Andrew.
It said 1993 was likely to have been an excellent year for Lloyd's
with profits of #800m and 1994 was also thought to have been a good
year. But the market's results may continue to be burdened by losses of
previous years still coming through.
Lloyd's has racked up losses of more than #8000m since 1988 after a
series of disasters, exacerbated by allegations of negligence.
Many traditional backers, known as Names, were badly hit after
pledging their personal wealth to support their investments in the
market and have taken legal action to recover losses.
Meanwhile the market has recently widened its financial base to take
in corporate limited liability investment for the first time.

CHELTENHAM &amp; Gloucester Building Society is to set aside #10m so that
widows of accountholders do not miss out from the windfall arising from
the takeover bid from Lloyds Bank.
However, this will only be effective if a Bill to change the present
restrictive rules reaches the statute book by August 1, the date the
deal is due to be completed.
At the moment those named second in joint accounts will receive
nothing under the takeover if the first named died during the qualifying
period of the two years to December 31, 1994. The same applies to
divorcees. The rule stems from the Building Societies Act 1986 which C&amp;G
maintains is flawed.
Widows and others stand to lose a windfall of up to #13,500. There is
currently an attempt under way in the House of Commons to change the act
to change the rule. Douglas French, Conservative MP for Gloucester, has
introduced a Bill in the Commons which will in his words bring
''fairness and justice'' to many people.
The Bill is due for its second reading on Friday after which it will
go to the committee stage.
A spokeswoman for C&amp;G said it was still ''touch and go'' whether the
Bill would become law in time for the August deadline but she stressed
the society was very supportive of it.
Chief executive Andrew Longhurst said: ''All we ask is to be able to
pay widows without delaying payment to all those members who qualify. We
will provide more than #10m of extra money -- whether the widows get it
is up to Mr French and the Government.''
If the bill proceeds to Royal Assent by the end of July then C&amp;G will
implement its #10m pledge and compensate the 5000 widows affected. The
widow of a first-named qualifying member on a joint account will receive
the same cash payment which the joint account would have received had
the first-named member survived until completion.
C&amp;G has not responded to calls that the vote on the takeover by its
members due on March 31 be delayed until Mr French's Bill does go
through. The society said this was impractical and would be to the
disadvantage of the great bulk of members.
''C&amp;G estimates that if, for example, the delay was of five months,
more than 7000 investors would die and so could never be paid. All
others would have to wait longer for their cash payments and feel their
funds were 'locked' up for longer,'' Mr Longhurst stated.

MORE jam tomorrow for Vodafone in exchange for a thinner layer now is
the prospect being held out by the mobile phone operator.
Vodafone shares fell 12[1/2]p to 175[1/2]p when chairman Sir Gerald
Whent warned that profits for the current year ending in March would be
below the market's expectations.
Normally when a statement of this sort is made the shares of the
company concerned fall a lot more than this.
But in Vodafone's case the reaction was modest because the shortfall
was a temporary effect caused by strong growth in phone connections.
This means higher commission payments before the benefit of the
increased subscriber numbers comes through.
So while this year's profits will be affected, Vodafone can
confidently predict higher profits for 1995-96.
Analysts had already scaled down their current year forecasts from
some #420m to below #400m and now some wonder if there will be much of
an advance at all over the comparable #363m.

Current political thinking on an integrated transport policy is about
to be energetically challenged by
Scotland's business leaders. And, says Francis Shennan, the initiative
will cut across party lines.
SCOTLAND'S business community looks set to pre-empt this year's big
political debates with a call for an integrated transport policy, even
if it means thinking the unthinkable.
It will put down its marker by telling Government and the political
parties what it needs to transport people and goods efficiently.
The conclusions of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce Transport
Conference in Glasgow next month, which is expected to attract 500
businessmen from across Scotland, are likely to cut across party lines
and to demand some rethinking on the responsibilities of a planned
Scottish Assembly and even reorganised local government.
With 8500 members the Chambers claim to be the loudest and most
representative voice of Scottish business and industry -- one they
believe Government, Opposition and local authorities cannot ignore.
''We need to be revolutionary in transport infrastructure,
particularly on funding and ownership,'' says Geoff Runcie, chief
executive of the Glasgow Chamber, which is hosting the conference.
''There needs to be a cultural change for everybody. We can't just
continue thinking, for example: 'I have a right to a car and a right to
take it anywhere.' We have to start a cultural change.
''How are we going to fund transport? The costs are escalating at such
a rate there is no way the public sector can fund it all.''
Traditional responsibilities may need to be altered in ways which do
not fit current political thinking on executive devolution via the
Scottish Office, or legislative devolution as with any future assembly.
''The division of responsibility for transport between the Scottish
Office and Department of Transport is not particularly adapted for
co-ordination between different transport modes,'' says Dr Alan
McKinnon, reader in transport and logistics at Heriot-Watt University,
who will present a position paper to the conference.
''Roads are the responsibility of the Scottish Office and rail is the
responsibility of the Department of Transport. The conference will want
to say something about co-ordinating responsibility.''
Delegates may also decide the new unitary authorities are unsuited to
helping to develop local transport infrastructure.
On deciding to sponsor the conference, Clydesdale Bank's chief
executive Frank Cicutto says: ''The time has never been more appropriate
for Scotland's commercial voice to lobby for the improvements necessary
for us to capitalise on the emerging markets of the European Union.''
The conference, called Getting Scotland Moving, has been restricted to
one day on March 30 to allow as many businessmen as possible to attend,
and will concentrate specifically on transport infrastructure.
Services -- such as what private rail operators might provide -- and
even telecommunications have been excluded to provide time to cover the
concrete, metal, and legislative parts of the picture. The reasoning is
that unless the physical and legal infrastructure -- such as
liberalising some of the restrictions on air freight -- exists,
sufficient services will not be possible anyway.
The approach will be to examine, in Dr McKinnon's position paper, the
infrastructure as it exists at present before looking at the
infrastructure as it should be. That will be examined by TNT UK managing
director Alan Jones, Herald economics editor Alf Young, and Eurotunnel
co-chairman Sir Alastair Morton in his keynote speech.
In the afternoon four ''breakout'' groups on road, rail, sea and air
will study ways of closing the gap in each sector as quickly and
efficiently as possible, before reporting back to the reunited
conference.
After the conference the Scottish Chambers' manifesto, stating what
business requires to be done to the transport infrastructure for
economic revitalisation, will be sent to policy-makers. The
openly-stated object of the conference is to drive Government policy.
''I get frustrated at a situation where we have to have a
conference,'' said Runcie. ''For example, the M77 extension was designed
in 1965. How much more will it cost to have put it off? It is probably
20 times the cost.
''If we cannot learn from that, what hope have we got of ever getting
on to a level playing field with our colleagues in Europe? Look at
Prestwick Airport having to build its own railway station!''
As well as the effect on Scottish-based companies, Runcie is also
concerned about the effects on investment. ''When it comes to inward
investment you want a number of negotiating tricks in your box,'' he
says, and transport infrastructure has already been proved to be one of
them.
The conference is not intended to be a whingeing shop, and Runcie and
McKinnon have good words to say about Scotland's network of motorways
and trunk roads in central Scotland. But urban routes, and especially
the roads south, come in for heavy criticism.
Runcie would also like to see more attention paid to ''intermodal''
transport. After all, few major companies use only one form of transport
and the biggest delays can occur when switching between them.
Details of the conference are available from organisers Alan Clark
Associates, 4 Woodside Place, Glasgow, G3 7DF; 041 353 5040; fax 041 353

SUN Alliance, Britain's largest household insurer, has decided to draw
a line under its losses in mortgage indemnity insurance.
Its 1994 accounts will bear a #100m charge to cover projected mortgage
indemnity claims, after which the losses will not have a material effect
on results.
These losses have been a heavy burden on the group, though they are
coming down. From #186m in 1992 they dropped to #89m in 1993 as the
housing market stabilised and doubtful mortgages dropped out. The trend
would have been lower in 1994 as well under the old accounting treatment
which recognised the losses as they occurred.
The new method will recognise losses from those mortgages which are in
arrears as at last December and which are projected to become
repossessions.
The new basis means that the reported loss on the business will be
increased by #100m. Unless the housing market deteriorates, losses from
mortgage indemnity business already written will no longer have a
material impact.

LEISURE group Rank Organisation confirmed yesterday that it was
potentially interested in the rival Metro-Goldwyn-Myer (MGM) cinema
chain put on the market by Credit Lyonnais.
Rank operates over 300 Odeon cinema screens in the UK and is well
placed to pick the best MGM sites to complement its existing business.
It may also be interested in expanding into Continental Europe through
acquiring MGM sites in the Netherlands and Denmark.
In 1993, MGM had 25.5% of the UK market generating turnover of
#106.7m. The company manages 120 cinemas in the UK and Ireland, split
between 18 multi-screen complexes and 102 traditional picture houses.
Two new multi-screen complexes are being built, talks on four others
are under way and 25 other projects are being studied.
A Credit Lyonnais spokesman said that the group had received dozens of
letters from parties interested in the 450 MGM cinemas which it hopes to
sell by this summer. A price tag of around Ffr1600m (#192m) has been
mentioned.
However, Rank may face monopoly constraints on any potential tie-up
with MGM. UK film distributors and cinema chains are already under
orders to liberalise the supply of films after a Monopolies and Mergers
Committee report last year found smaller picture houses and distributors
were being squeezed.
Rank's cinema admissions were boosted in the year to October 31 by 9%
helped by the popularity of the film Four Weddings and a Funeral and
toward the latter half of the year, The Lion King.
It is focusing on larger multiplex cinemas in the UK such as a site in
Dundee opened in 1993 which has a seating capacity of over 1670 in six
auditoria. A consolidation of the UK cinema industry would enable Rank
to increase its average admission price which was unchanged last year
due to increased competition.
Shares in Rank Organisation added 6p to 375p.

AS currency dealers across Europe awaited news from the FOMC meeting,
trading was quiet with major currencies moving in narrow ranges.
The dollar itself drew comfort from the revival in the Mexican peso
following news of an international support package for the Mexican
economy.
News of a higher-than-expected increase in the US Purchasing Managers'
Index was ignored by the dollar.
Meanwhile sterling barely moved ahead of today's monthly meetimg
between Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke and Governor of the
Bank of England.
The market has factored in a half-point rise although yesterday's
Purchasing Managers' Index and recent comments from Mr George have
raised doubts as to whether an immediate rise in UK rates is necessary.
By the end of European trading, sterling eased against both the German
mark and the dollar at DM2.4081 and $1.5800 respectively, while in New
York last night, it closed at $1.5815.
Sterling's trade-weighted index remained at 88.7.

New York, Wednesday -- Blue-chip stocks closed slightly higher as the
market shrugged off the widely expected decision by the Federal Reserve
to boost interest rates for a seventh time in 12 months.
The Dow-Jones industrial average ended with a gain of 3.70 points at
3847.56.
In the broader market, advancing issues led declines by four-to-three
on active trading of more than 397 million shares on the New York Stock
Exchange.
The Fed said it raised two key short-term interest rates by one-half
percentage point to contain inflation and sustain the economy's
expansion.
Major banks were quick to follow and raised their prime rates by
half-a-percentage point to 9%.
The move was led by Minneapolis-based Norwest Corporation and was
quickly followed by Chase Manhattan, Citicorp, First Chicago and others.
The prime rate is the rate banks charge their best corporate customers
for loans, but it also directly affects credit card and other lending
rates throughout the economy.
The Dow hit a session peak, up over 24 points as some market players
appeared to bet that Wall Street would have a relief rally after the
rate hike was out of the way.
But the rally never materialised.
''I think a lot of people bought in front of the Fed news thinking the
market was going to rally with a half-a-point rise,'' said Richard
Meyer, manager of institutional trading at Ladenberg, Thalmann.
''When no rally followed, people turned sellers.''
Investors responded positively to President Clinton's $20bn economic
aid package to Mexico. Despite strength in the overall market, the
American depositary shares of Mexican companies were lower, giving back
yesterday's strong gains after the aid package was announced.

A 12-ACRE distribution base at Bellshill, Lanarkshire, is home for the
50-vehicle Scottish lorry fleet of Applied Distribution Ltd and the
centre for an impressively efficient business operation which has
achieved a steady 20% growth in turnover in each year of its five-year
history.
That includes clocking up a total of more than three million delivery
miles each year -- and now the distribution and storage group's Scottish
centre is about to take another major stride forward into a new area of
development.
''Here at the Foodpark at Bellshill Industrial Estate we are at an
ideal location to cover all of Scotland,'' said Mr Ian Galston, ADL
general manager at Bellshill. ''At the moment we have a staff of 120
located here. We have increased our warehouse area from an initial
70,000sq ft to a total of 120,000sq ft, including considerable chilled
and ambient facilities.''
The key factor for the future is that ADL have planning permission to
develop another 80,000sq ft on their 12-acre freehold base. ADL's
management intend to target their next Scottish growth plan around that
80,000sq ft area.
''We have put a lot of research into the best way ahead,'' said Ian
Galston. ''We want to develop a new 'shared user' approach, involving
either a retailer or a group of small companies who can see the
opportunities afforded by operating in a partnership style -- firms that
can see the benefits of having a major distribution company as immediate
neighbour.''
ADL regard their location at Bellshill, only minutes away from the
heart of Scotland's motorway network, as a much valued asset.
''We believe that the high quality of our distribution facility at
Bellshill, coupled with our extensive 'all of Scotland' delivery
service, puts us in a unique position,'' said Mr Martin Palmer, group
business development director. At Bellshill we are ideally placed to
offer quality, value for money and service.''
Another factor certain to grow in importance is that they are close to
the Mossend rail network terminal for Europe. ADL has already won the
contract to operate Daventry rail freight port.
''Daventry is on the West Coast mainline which also services
Mossend,'' said Martin Palmer. ''We see great potential in utilising
Daventry and Mossend together to service the total UK marketplace. If
business volume dictated it, we would certainly look at taking space
closer to the Mossend facility.''
The ADL group has a modern approach to the fast growing contract
distribution business, providing third party trans-shipping, warehousing
and distribution services.
Major customers at Bellshill include CWS for fresh produce, Nestle's,
Baxter, and Esso for promotion goods. The operation is carried six days
a week, 24 hours a day.
''We regard all our customers as partners,'' said Ian Galston. ''This
can take the form of dedicated services or shared user services in an
operation which has state-of-the-art computer control provided by both
our own and customers' system.
''In the same way, we have dedicated office space for our main
customers and their staff which is located within our warehousing
areas.''
BS5750 accredited and with a solid blue chip customer portfolio, ADL's
giant warehouse areas include 16,000sq ft of chilled space and are
provided with a full range of the latest high stacking and storage
equipment.
''The benefits of being so strategically based at Bellshill are backed
by other aspects, including a very experienced and loyal workforce,''
said Ian Galston. ''All maintenance and servicing requirements for every
vehicle in our fleet can be provided by our own Bellshill workshops.''
Looking ahead, business development director Martin Palmer believes
that future ADL growth in both Scotland and England will come by
providing a tailor-made service.
''In Scotland, because of our high level of infrastructure we are able
to offer our services to all sizes of company. We hope that this growth
will come from both English or European companies wanting distribution
handled in Scotland, as well as Scottish-based companies looking for us
to help them with their overall distribution.
''We are also looking at potential Scottish acquisitions to further
enhance our position in this important market place.''
He believes that special skills are required for retail distribution
in Scotland.
''As we already act for the Co-op in most parts of Scotland, it is
easy for us to understand the particular difficulties of servicing this
often lightly populated marketplace. We believe special skills are
needed in terms of shared use operation to cope with this.''

IN a message to The Herald's business readers, Russia's UK ambassador
Anatoly Adamishin, has called for greater trade and cultural contacts in
1995.
Mr Adamishin has further committed his embassy to ''demystifying and
decentralising trade development procedures and consular activities.''
The ambassador also confirmed that Russia's Edinburgh-based
Consul-General Gennadi Lazoutkin, would confer a Certificate of
Achievement upon the Dundee-based Siberian Trading Company.
Mr Adamishin said he hoped that this annual award would, ''encourage
Scottish companies to trust the experience of those already trading with
Russia and to explore the many profitable openings on offer to Western
investors.''
He described his goal as ''narrowing the perplexing gap between UK
investment in Russia and that of countries like America, France,
Germany, Italy, Turkey and even Portugal''. Mr Adamishin stressed that
Scottish business methods are especially admired by his countrymen and
that the new Certificate of Achievement is ''uniquely Scottish for that
reason.''
The Siberian Trading Company's managing director Jack Meiland, said
that realistic rewards await those willing to adopt a long term overview
in the import-export and manufacturing sectors.
Mr Meiland said his company's four-year spell in the Siberian city of
Krasnoyarsk, in Moscow, and in Glasgow's twin city of Rostov on Don,
came about from close liaison with municipal and regional authorities
and listening to what the Russians said they needed.
Company director Bill Rodgers, who joined Mr Meiland at a recent
consular reception in honour of Mr Adamishin's first visit to Scotland,
expressed delight at the Russian Government's decision to recognise
STC's efforts.
Mr Rodgers said: ''We also recently brokered six months of
negotiations which led to Celtic Boys Club's acceptance, in late
November, of an invitation to play six friendly matches against Moscow's
Team Olympic youth squad.
''In December we hosted our second 1994 delegation from Siberia. That
group included the depute commercial director of the eastern Siberian
power industry, two officials of the Siberian Public Health Fund and a
textiles manufacturer.
''In September with the Russian Communications Company in Edinburgh we
co-ordinated an exhibition of works by Alexander Shafeyev, a well-known
artist from the Siberian city of Omsk, and hosted the travels in
Scotland of his sponsors from the Siberian International Investment
Bank.''
Natalya Krylova, chairwoman of the bank -- a hard currency institution
which is currently seeking reciprocal UK facilities -- told The Herald
that the Siberian Trading Company and its associates, ''represent the
spirit, business style and flexibility which our clients seek in foreign
partners.''
Other companies familiar to The Herald's business readers have
improved their profiles in Russia to the long term benefit of Scottish
trade prospects in the Federation.
Iain C Shirlaw, a former Scottish Development Agency executive and now
managing director of the Ayrshire-based St Petersburg Development
Corporation, has been active in north-west Russia since early 1990.
Mr Shirlaw was given joint responsibility for raising investment in
the West for the 23-site Konushennaya Island Development Agency by Dr
Anatoly Sobchak, mayor of St Petersburg. The agency's holdings have a
contractual value of over $4000m. Mr Shirlaw's development partner, Dr
Alexander Ryazanov, has since been promoted and is now a personal
adviser to Mayor Sobchak with a substantial say in all commercial
property development matters.
This move, said Doug Smith, the Richard Ellis Estate Agency expert who
tutored Mr Ryazanov at Glasgow University in 1992, places his former
student ''in full control of commercial floor space 10 times the size of
Glasgow's.'' He described this as, ''a major breakthrough for Scottish
business interests.''
St Petersburg has managed to withstand much of the panic which swept
Russia in the latter weeks of 1994.
In mid-December, the Sevodnya (Today) newspaper reported that the St
Petersburg stock exchange was the second busiest, by volume of trading,
in Russia, processing transactions worth 2400m roubles; 69% of which
came from the exchange's hard currency auction.
Major prospects which attracted Western interest in late 1994 were St
Petersburg's international transport conference and exhibition; an
education conference attended by senior Western Government Ministers; a
north-south inner city road tunnel for heavy trucks; confirmation of the
Via Baltica road network and GAZPROM pipeline (linking St Petersburg
with Sweden and Finland), and a major harbour expansion programme.
In Moscow, Mayor Luzhkov announced the creation of a Small Business
Development Foundation while the Federal Securities Commission launched
an information centre for investors which will provide information from
the 1992 financial statements of privatised companies.
Glasgow Chamber of Commerce spokesman Joe McLaughlin, said the
chamber's relations with officials in Moscow and in the city of
Krasnodar, south of Rostov on Don, are still in the formative stages but
that Rostov City Council ''has decided to create not just one but four
Customs Free Zones each of which will support a road, sea, air or rail
facility within the South Russia Terminus transport development
programme.''
Mr McLaughlin said: ''The Russian market's growing demand for quality
footwear, clothing, household goods and electrical equipment presents
niche market opportunities, especially in the Rostov region, from which
Scottish companies could swiftly benefit.''
Russia's November export figures, for countries outwith the former
USSR, totalled $4900m. Compared to January-November 1993, imports
increased 5.1% to a new high of $24.8bn.

IT'S like something out of a movie starring John Gordon Sinclair --
guy running pizza home delivery service in Livingston New Town meets
girl working next door in curry home delivery service.
They fall in love, get married -- and open Scotland's first popcorn
factory?
The thing is, folks, that this is the true story of Michael Danyluk
and his wife, Sheri-Ann. Mr Danyluk, 28, says: ''My mother is Italian
and comes from a catering background so I set up my own business in 1988
selling pizzas and pasta on a home delivery basis. In fact, I was one of
the first in Scotland to do that.
''Right next door to me on the same industrial estate was another home
delivery service, specialising in Indian food. My wife's family ran it
and that's how we met.''
At this point, Mr Danyluk explains that, as well as having an Italian
mother, his father is Ukrainian.
He adds: ''Sheri-Ann's father is Burmese and her mother comes from
Pakistan. Our first child, a boy, was just born in September and we're
going to have a hard time explaining his ancestry to him when he gets
older.''
After they married, the young Danyluks decided to set up an entirely
new business together selling hamburgers, hot dogs and other
American-style fast food, including popcorn.
And it was their search for just the right popcorn that led to the
establishment of their own corn-popping enterprise.
Mr Danyluk says: ''When we were looking around for a popcorn supplier
we found there wasn't one in Scotland; it was all coming from down south
and, frankly, we weren't impressed.
''Having discovered there was that kind of gap in the home market, it
didn't make sense to go back into catering, with all the long hours and
hard work, if there was an easier living to be made out of popping
corn,''
So, three years ago, the Popcorn Factory, selling what the company
describes as ''fresh, Scottish popcorn'', opened for business right
across the street from those self-same industrial estate units that had
brought Michael and Sheri-Ann together in the first place.
Currently, the factory makes around six tons of popcorn a week -- the
corn kernels come from the United States, as did the corn popping
machines -- which they sell to smaller cinemas, video stores, sweet
shops and grocery outlets.
Mr Danyluk claims that, even with sugar on it -- which is the way most
Scots prefer their popcorn, apparently -- popcorn's high fibre and
negligible fat content make it a much healthier snack food than crisps.
In a bid for even greater sales, the Popcorn Factory has just launched
a new range of colourful ''movie-style'' packages aimed at the growing
video watching population. They feature a family of cartoon characters
called The MacCorns -- Pop MacCorn, Maisie MacCorn and the little
Niblets -- and bear the slogan: ''What's a movie without popcorn?''
Indeed.

THIS week's Trailblazer column gives you an insight into a ''Brave New
World'' where reality is what you make it and imagination is king --
welcome to the world of virtual reality (VR).
Morrison McLean Associates (MMA), an Aberdeen-based computer firm,
consists of a crack team of 10 computer technology ''whiz kids'' who are
able to transport clients to the world of make believe.
They can put divers into the deepest oceans without getting their feet
wet, and they can let aircraft pilots take part in realistic dog-fights
without ever leaving the ground.
But MMA wasn't always able to open the door to the never-never land of
virtual reality. The company started life in 1987 as a one-man bureau
service for draughtsmen primarily involved in the oil and gas industry.
Since that time, thanks to the vision of MMA's founder and current
managing director, Mr George Morrison, the firm has grown to become the
largest Computer Aided Design (CAD) consultancy in Scotland.
In less than eight years its turnover has risen from #40,000 per year
to approximately #2m annually. Not bad for a company whose oldest
employee is 31, and the average age of the other computer experts is 24.
MMA's bread and butter work is supplying 'high-end' computer
engineering work stations to the oil and gas industry. According to Mr
Morrison, these are just one-step removed from virtual reality.
''The older CAD systems had a 3-D facility but the bulk of the work
had to be done in two dimensional format. The powerful equipment we now
provide works in 3-D all the time which gives design engineers a greater
feel for the project,'' he said.
''For example, if an engineer was working on a platform design he
could take a predetermined walk around the structure viewing it at all
angles on screen. But despite the obvious benefits of this capability,
the very latest CAD tools cannot replicate reality in the detail that
genuine reality requires,'' added Mr Morrison.
For the last two years MMA has invested heavily in the VR technology
designed to fool users into believing they are part of the computer
environment. Using the latest hardware, system operators can interact
with a computer generated model of anything they desire as if they were
actually there.
Anybody interested in computers and VR will know about the headsets
which are worn to immerse themselves in the virtual world. The kit's
mini-monitors, one for each eye, relay pictures of the environment the
user is in which change in relation to head movements.
It is similar to hi-tech equipment which MMA is marketing to leading
companies in the petroleum sector. ''We are currently working on
something called telepresence. It is similar to VR in the respect that
it makes the user feel part of the environment. But it differs in that
the environment is real and not computer generated,'' explained Mr
Morrison.
''We are working in partnership with a Norwegian oil company and
diving contractor both of which are interested in the system. In this
context, it involves the operator wearing a headset with one mini screen
for each eye which receives stero vision pictures from cameras on a
subsea robot.
''This enables the operator to see hundreds of metres below the sea in
real-time if you like. In the past pictures were relayed back on to a
normal monitor which made the operator feel quite detached and without
any perceptive senses,'' he added.
''Through stereo-vision he can judge distance, get a better idea of
size and basically work a lot more effectively by relying on judgment
rather than chance.''
MMA is now taking this concept a stage further with the introduction
of the exo-skeleton. This is a metal skeletal structure built in the
form of a limb, for example an arm, which can relay real-time physical
forces from an environment thousands of miles away. When used in
conjunction with the VR headset, the user will feel, as well as see,
what is happening in the remote environment.
''This technology is already being used by the American military for
developments in remote surgery,'' enthused Mr Morrison. ''In war
situations where it is difficult to get to casualties, a robot with a
scalpel in a manipulator will go to the frontline under the control of a
surgeon back in the States for example.
''Using a VR headset he will be able to see everything around him in
real-time, including the seriously injured body. He can then operate
using the exo-skeleton which will tell him exactly how much force he
needs, thanks to the force-feedback from the robot, to cut the skin and
conduct the necessary surgery -- all this from the comfort of his office
in the States.''
But for the uninitiated, what is VR really like? When asked to
describe it, Mr Morrison's standard reply is: ''Everybody knows what
reality is, well VR is virtually that!''
An easy explanation for work which involves some of the most advanced,
complicated computer systems around to create a new world for us to
experience.

Drew Watson, Principal Consultant,
Change and Development, KPMG.
SHORTLY after the five-nations tournament is over, another --
untelevised -- rugby match will take place when United Distillers meets
Moet Hennessey in their annual fixture. You can imagine the feelings of
the French tight head last year when he found himself playing against
David Sole.
Yet his team still managed to scrape an 18-17 victory. A spirited
performance producing a champagne result, you could say, and a real
boost for corporate espirit de corps on both sides.
The drinks industry as much as any is well aware of the need to
maintain quality, drive up efficiency and accurately predict trends in a
world market which is subject to turbulent growth in the East and
changeable trends in the West. Add to that technological advances and
fierce competition and you can see why companies in this sector have to
keep their eye on the ball. In moving through such changing times
corporate teamworking has to match and exceed the passion of the
Franco-Scottish sporting clash.
The significance of teamworking to the Scottish economy is not just
that it has the potential to enhance efficiencey and effectiveness but
that it is a key factor in creating the type of organisational agility
and innovation which is so relevant to the increased volume, pace and
complexity of change that most of us are now facing.
At a cross divisional team meeting in a large Scottish company last
month one of the participants said ''we have a number of new projects on
the go at present and it's stretching us -- maybe next year we will get
back to business as usual''. The team leader leaned forward and replied:
''Sorry, -- this is business as usual''.
It is an apparent anomaly that the things that make it easier to
handle change -- like teams and good coaching -- take up more time in
the short term before paying real dividends in the long term.
One problem is that absorbing change uses energy: physical, mental and
emotional. Single events with a beginning middle and end are less of a
problem. But what happens when several things are changing at once and
in the middle of the process they change again?
Where do you and your colleagues get that kind of energy from? Think
back over the last three or four years when words like transformation,
step change and quantum leap started to be used in Scottish boardrooms.
If you have been, and still are, part of that sort of ''reinvention'',
which energy reserves have you had to plunder? Those which were used for
leisure, or the community, or family life, or those which maintain the
human spirit? Not easy, and it is this which makes it all the more
important for organisations to plan and link vision, processes, skills,
structures and team relationships in such a way which creates rather
than destroys the energies of people, ''their greatest assets''.
One tired manager of a large and busy company recently complained he
was suffering from ''death by a thousand initiatives''. ''Think about
it,'' he said ''IT systems and software upgraded or changed every so
often, the divisional mergers, the best in class project, total quality,
rightsizing, ISO 9000 and now business process redesign''.
In that company projects abounded but they all seemed to operate like
separate initiatives -- each one making increasing demands on people for
training, briefings and mandatory actions. They are now taking a more
integrated and paced approach.
Change brings with it ambiguity and resistance -- this is natural and
needs to be honoured and worked with as a legitimate part of it all.
What is it then that tomorrow's winners will do differently from the
rest? They will recognise that change is an ongoing process to be
managed and not reacted to by a series of seductive ''quick fixes''.
They will show the strength to see things through. Perhaps most
importantly they will strive to create the type of synergies which only
genuine teamworking backed by the right culture can bring.
The combination of an achievement orientated culture, an open and
communicative management style and truly empowered teams is a strong
one. There is more of a delicate balance in such a formula than first
meets the eye. Many companies are taking their inspiration from Anita
Roddicks' Body Shop or from some of the new players in electronics: good
models for self-managed teams.
And self-managed teams seem to work best on new sites with specially
developed selection criteria. For traditionally managed UK companies it
will take about six steps and a lot of communication, involvement and
development before this approach can be implemented. Otherwise, if
prevailing culture doesn't scupper it, middle management insecurities or
workforce suspicions will.
The capacity of such companies to identify the benefits that team
based approaches can bring is not in doubt. What does cause problems is
making it happen in a balanced way, in step with other changes, with
optimum levels of communication and training, and without
underestimating the need to manage people through the complexities of
change.
Yet there are plenty examples of good practice here in Scotland. Some
of the electronics companies have developed excellent teamworking
environments, certain companies in our drinks industry can see shopfloor
teams contribute to greater efficiences in bottling and packaging; a
number of hotels, professional services and engineering companies also
come to mind.
The team route is not going to be the panacea for every organisation
but for many it clearly does offer more than a sporting chance of future
success.

Hong Kong, Wednesday
PORKY Pig is banned, news is pulled, heavy metal is on the scrap heap,
and Madonna's pointy bra stays in the closet.
Welcome to satellite television in Asia, where international
broadcasters bend over backwards to woo the region's more sensitive
viewers and ingratiate themselves with nervous regional governments.
In two weeks' time, China will kick-start the next phase of the
region's television industry when it launches its new satellite,
Apstar-2, over Asia.
Apstar-2 will carry a raft of ambitious broadcasters who are realising
their success stories in the United States or Europe cannot simply be
relabelled and rerun in Asia.
Take stuttering Porky for example -- he's a hit with kids in the West.
But Moslem viewers, who don't eat pork, might have seen red over the
sight of Ted Turner's porcine character if tuning in to Asian cartoons
at dinner time.
Unasked, Turner banished the swine to the archives when he launched
his movie and cartoon network in Asia last year.
''We are not having Porky Pig at all. We are going to be sensitive to
regional viewers,'' said a spokeswoman for Ted Turner's TNT &amp; Cartoon
Network in a recent interview.
Blanket broadcasting and Western tastes do not always go over well in
Asia, a region filled with races, religion, culture and languages as
diverse as those found in Europe.
Rupert Murdoch, whose Star TV pioneered Asian satellite broadcasting
in 1991, should know. This month Star announced its pop-music Channel V
was finally blessed by the Singapore government, well-known for its
tight grip on the media.
But no nudity, rap or grunge will be seen on Singapore's eight hours
of Star TV pop videos each week. Star has substantially tamed its music
broadcasts from its early days to include more crooning love songs and
less rock'n'roll.
''We vet everything not just for vulgarity and sex and violence but
also for cultural taboos,'' said Channel V programme manager Don Atyeo.
''It's a real myth that music travels across boundaries,'' Atyeo said.
''It's very hard for a kid in Hong Kong to relate to Madonna prancing
around with traffic cones on her tits. They relate more to Andy Lau with
a sports coat and a turtleneck sweater.''
Murdoch also yielded to China, axing Star TV's BBC news broadcasts
over north Asia last year when Communist officials found uncensored
Western news too close to the bone.
While Western broadcasters were rethinking their Asian strategies,
niche local broadcasters began to spring up, promising sanitised
family-style entertainment to please Asia's increasingly wealthy but
relatively conservative middle class.
Asian television veteran Robert Chua started China Entertainment
Television Broadcast Ltd (CETV), a variety satellite channel in the main
Chinese dialect of Mandarin.
Former Hong Kong publisher Yu Pun-hoi launched Chinese Television
Network, which plans to show Mandarin news and entertainment.
But Western broadcasters say they can still use their popular material
and play to their strengths in Asia, as long as they give the locals in
each country what they want.
Ted Turner has archives full of movies about making money, a favourite
local pastime. Advertisers, too, after their experience in Europe, find
generic ads rarely have pan-Asia appeal, even for universal brands.
Companies planning regional television campaigns mostly buy time on
local terrestrial television stations, often creating a different ad for
each country.
''There's no such place as Asia. India is a very different place to
Malaysia and a very different place to China,'' said television
researcher John Kaye. ''Pan-Asian advertising is as daft a proposition
as pan-European advertising was.''

Adaptation is the order of the day in Scottish agriculture as Harry
Conroy found out on a visit to some farms on the banks of the River
Forth.
TOWNIES passing in the car or gazing out of train windows see before
them idyllic countryside with sheep munching quietly in the fields or
wheat bending gently in the breeze.
At harvest time they quietly bemoan the disappearance of the haystacks
which have been replaced by black plastic covered bales.
Many will have harboured the romantic notion of swopping suburban life
with its morning traffic jams and busy office for a pretty farm cottage
and an idealised, quiet, less stressful, lifestyle.
The reality, however, is not quite so romantic.
Today's farmer does not have to merely cope with the vagaries of
Scotland's weather but also the mood of Europe's political leaders.
Farming as an industry has had to adapt to survive, and productivity
is as much the name of the game on the farm as it is in the factory.
The Mitchell family, who work two farms on the
Perthshire/Stirlingshire border beside the meandering Forth, have
witnessed many changes since the family became tenant farmers at Offers
Farm near Gargunnock.
In 1950 when they took over the 234-acre mixed arable farm there were
three pairs of horses in the stable and two farm hands and a boy to lend
a hand.
Today, the horses have gone to be replaced by two tractors and a
forklift and the family have had to buy another farm. Brothers Jim and
David Mitchell now work not only Offers Farm themselves but also the
neighbouring 168-acre Kepdarroch Farm.
''We bought Kepdarroch in 1985 in order to make the farm viable,''
explains Jim Mitchell.
The farm horses disappeared around 1960 reflecting the mechanisation
taking place in the farm industry.
In 1914 there were an estimated 200,000 horses on Scottish farms, but
by 1963 there were only a few hundred left.
The Mitchells have not had a farm hand since 1980 when their last
employee retired. This too reflected the trend in the industry as
machines replaced men.
In 1881 there were more than 150,000 farmworkers in Scotland. By 1972
this figure had been reduced to 42,000 and today the figure is around
26,000.
These figures should not be seen as portraying an industry in decline.
Agriculture is still a vital, basic industry. There are 32,000 holdings
in Scotland whose total output in 1992 was valued at over #1.5m.
The industry plays an important role as an exporter. Scotch beef is in
high demand abroad, and every year we export around #400m of beef at
farmgate prices along with #180m of lamb and #65m of pork.
There is no question that our beef and lamb industry is geared for
export. Our five million population could not consume the meat produced
from the herds and flocks scattered across our countryside.
In 1993 there was an estimated 8.5 million sheep and lamb in Scotland
and 1.4 million cows and calves.
There are just over 11,000 holdings in Scotland with beef cows and
another 15,000 with sheep.
The Mitchell farms reflect modern day farming with 19 hectares ''set
aside'' and 16.5 hectares given over to oil-seed rape, a crop which was
unknown in Scotland when the family first began to farm the land.
''Set aside began in 1989, and you must set aside 15% of your total
land if you want to receive aid payment from the EC,'' explains Jim.
''In 1950 there was no oil-seed rape and we grew more wheat which was
then used to thatch the stacks. At that time the wheat was grown longer
so that we could use the straw for thatching, while the wheat grown now
is shorter and is not so easily damaged by the wind and rain.''
Jim and David grow also barley, wheat and oats with the barley
destined for Scotland's whisky industry.
''The problem with growing barley for the whisky industry is that the
nitrogen content has to be just right and you have no way of knowing
what your level is until after the harvest,'' explains David.
On the farm's 52 hectares of grazing land there are 100 ewes and some
suckle cows.
Jim and David work around 60 hours each week but try to do only what
is necessary at weekends so that one of them can have a weekend off.
They do not believe that the way ahead for farming lies in organic
produce.
''I can't see organic farming on a mass scale. If you had an organic
farm and a non organic farm side by side then what is sprayed in one
field is blown into the next. It would not work,'' says Jim.
Many farms in the future, they reckon, might not grow produce for
human consumption but for fuel consumption.
''Biofuels could be the crops of the future,'' says David, ''It is
already happening in Europe, and if our Government were to decide to
encourage it then we could see it happening here''.
The development of biofuel, according to the brothers, would mean that
crops such as sunflower seeds would be grown to produce oil and coppices
could be managed to produce wood for burning.
Scottish farms receive around #200m a year in subsidies but Jim, who
is president of the Forth Valley Branch of the National Farmers' Union
does not see an end to these.
''There would be the equivalent of another clearance if they took
subsidies away. America and Europe would have to stop on the same day
and prices would go up immediately, although New Zealand has already
gone down this route.''
Working horses may have disappeared from Offers Farm 35-years-ago but
Jim clings to tradition, keeping three Clydesdale horses for shows.
At harvest time, the saying goes: ''A red sky at night is the farmer's
delight'' as it signifies a dry day ahead, and like most farmers the
brothers keep a close watch on the weather.
The seasons, says Jim are changing. ''There are not the same hard
frosts we used to get, and these killed off slugs.''
In recent years the weather has not been good for the Mitchell
brothers as their land is heavy soil which retains moisture, and the
recent flooding has not helped.
The bonus is that the land does not burn up in dry, sunny weather
which should mean that at least one farm is praying for a summer
heatwave in 1995.
I can't see organic farming on a mass scale. If you had an organic
farm and a non organic farm side by side then what is sprayed in one
field is blown into the next. It would not work

From MARK O'NEILL Beijing, Wednesday
ON the vast floor manned by sweating workers in the Beijing Number
Three Mill, where deafening looms shake and twist cotton 24 hours a day,
there is no sign of China's serious cotton shortage.
''We have not stopped production since early 1992,'' said proud
managing director Zhao Shaowang, who has worked in the plant since it
was built in 1956.
''The shortage affects small firms with outdated equipment and not big
key plants like ours,'' he said in a modest room off one of the mill's
dark, narrow corridors.
All the same, in August last year the mill ordered 7000 tonnes of
foreign cotton, its first imports for 16 years. It needs 24,000 tonnes
of raw material a year to produce its 75 million metres of cotton cloth,
80% for export, mainly to Europe and North America.
China's cotton output in 1993 was just 3.76 million tonnes, down 16.6%
from 1992, its lowest level since 1986 and compared with a record 6.25
million in 1984.
The number of cotton mills in China with more than 10,000 spindles
reached 2630 in 1994, more than double the figure in the early 1980s.
The cotton shortage has now shut down hundreds of these mills, laying
off thousands of workers.
China's imports in the first nine months of 1994 were 340,000 tonnes,
soaring from just 10,000 in the same 1993 period. Exports were 100,770
tonnes, down from 100,059.
The government has issued a string of orders, reaffirming the state
monopoly on cotton purchase and distribution and calling on farmers to
sell their crop to the state and not to hoard it in the hope of higher
black-market prices.
The purchase price plus subsidy this year is 544 yuan ($64) per 50 kg
(110lb), which the government says is 202 yuan ($23.8) more than last
year.
Zhao said the domestic price of cotton had risen to 17,000 yuan
($2000) per tonne from 9000 yuan ($1060) last February.
His Number Three Mill is one of 200 high-quality, export-oriented
state factories whose supply of cotton is guaranteed, he said.
''The shortages are not so severe as reported abroad,'' he said. ''We
have national stocks. Farmers will sooner or later have to sell to the
state, as other buyers are illegal.
''It is just a matter of time until government control is lifted from
the cotton market but two necessary preconditions are not ripe yet --
adequate stocks to regulate the market and a balance between supply and
demand.''
He said he opposed a further increase in the purchase price given to
farmers, saying mills could not tolerate it.
His mill's priority status has enabled it since 1987 to spend 350
million yuan ($41.2m) on large-scale imports of new machines from
Switzerland, Germany, and Japan that hum and spin almost without noise
and are gradually replacing the old, noisy and more labour-intensive
machinery.
This renovation has trimmed the workforce to fewer than 7000 from
10,000 in the early 1980s, mostly through retirement.
''We cannot fire anyone,'' said Zhao. ''That would not be good for
social stability. Under the new Labour Law, we are now able to hire
contract workers. But it is very hard to change the mentality of
people.'' The government's long-term plan to solve the cotton crisis is
to cut demand.
An order issued by the State Council (Cabinet) last October called for
a reduction of 10 million spindles, half by the end of 1996 and the rest
by the end of 1998.
The order said that, once the spindles have been phased out, they
cannot be re-used and strict control must be exercised on new capacity,
with old machines replaced by new ones and no overall increase in
capacity.

TOP Scots civil engineering boss Marshall Dougall has found another
outlet for his city business skills. After building up the highly
respected Luddon Construction Ltd nearly 20 years ago, Dougall is now
juggling his time between the city and the countryside, running a
#20m-a-year company and raising a very successful herd of pedigree
cattle.
He owns a 600-acre farm in Stirlingshire, which is spread around his
home in the small village of Buchlyvie.
A childhood dream came true in March, 1986 when Marshall Dougall
bought Whiteleys Farm, at the time purely a hill farm consisting of 450
acres of grazing land for its 60 cattle and 300 sheep.
Through gradually acquiring additional lowland grazing, building
modern barns and more vehicle-friendly access routes, he has achieved
one of the most up-to-date farms in the area.
''I am very privileged to have made enough money to do what I had
always wanted to, not having to rely solely on farm income for my bread
and butter,'' he says. ''With a farm annual turnover of less than
#100,000, I would have had to run the place on a shoestring, like most
farmers who do regard the industry as a way of life.''
Dougall, whose construction company has just been accredited with the
British Standards Quality Assurance award, obviously believes the only
way to increase profit margins is to improve quality. Once a suitable
farming environment had been achieved, he started developing his
livestock.
He favoured the pedigree breed of Blonde d'Aquitaine, which is the
fastest-growing breed in its native France and well established in this
country because of its easy calving attributes and good temperament,
combined with daily live weight gain figures equal to or ahead of its
competition.
Dougall now has a herd of 83 pedigree Blondes and, although he is
still concentrating on developing as pure and strong a herd as possible,
several of his earlier bulls and heifers have already won prizes at
shows, including the Highland Show in Edinburgh.
''We chose the Blonde because the breed possess qualities which both
the Limousin and Charolais lack,'' he says. ''We believe the breed is
underrated and has points which have yet to be recognised in Scotland.''
The Blonde herd is Dougall's passion but the mainstay of the farm
continues to remain with the more traditional Scottish farming stock,
with 90 Blonde cross Friesian suckler cows and 600 sheep.
The Glasgow-based Luddon Construction is also in the middle of further
developments, into the design-and-build and commercial building sectors,
and is already recording great success in these new arenas. Says
Dougall: ''We have never been so busy, and have just had to take on
three more engineers to cope with the workload.''
There can't be enough hours in the day for this 51-year-old
entrepreneur. When asked how he copes with running two very successful
but different operations, he answers: ''It's been a very hectic 20 years
but I have finally reached the stage where I can choose between my two
favourite pastimes -- building roads and chasing cows. And anyone can
make time for the things they enjoy.''

THE vociferous debate over the UK's position as a member state within
the European Union continues undiluted. Grumbles from within our
national boundaries (Scottish and British) persist in lending a popular
media image of Britain as a downright difficult member of the club,
despite the incontrovertible facts of geography.
An innocent bystander might think from this that membership resembled
some sort of prison sentence. Yet on the first day of 1995, after a
democratic vote, the majority of the peoples of Finland, Sweden and
Austria decided that membership of the EU represented the best economic
and social future for them. Several more countries are waiting in the
wings. Are we or they mad?, observers will ask.
As Director of the EuroInfoCentre Ltd in Glasgow -- one of more than
200 non-profit making European business intelligence and legislation
information points throughout the EU -- you would be right in assuming
that I have a pro-European axe to grind. EuroInfoCentres are the product
of the European Commission's commitment to ensure equal business
opportunity for companies across the whole of the EU -- particularly in
the small and medium-sized sector.
In that light, I want to stand back from the high-level social and
political furore and take a down-to-earth look at the world of the SME
(Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise) which represents the backbone of the
Scottish economy, and its potential position within European Union
markets.
But first I want to drop a bomb on a popular myth concerning Scottish
business and its alleged apathy towards Europe.
According to European Commission figures from the whole network of
EuroInfoCentres, our office in Glasgow has the highest daily usage rate
of one of Europe's most important business databases. TED (Tenders
Electronic Daily) is a fast-track electronic version of the daily
Official Journal -- the main means through which public sector and
utilities procurement contracts throughout the EU are publicised.
Subscriber companies buy our services to search and sift this
information, relative to their chosen interests. Using this database, we
perform more than 75 client searches per day -- a figure I would still
like to see increased. Given that a degree of get-up-and-go is needed
from a company in the first place, that should be proof enough to blow
the apathy myth wide open.
The real economic benefits of EU membership have been felt by many a
small Scottish company.
Take, for example, one road-sweeper manufacturer from Falkirk. This
firm wanted to break into important municipal markets in Germany and
France, among others. The company has a great product, but without
speedily available market intelligence it would have taken many days of
executive time to access the information needed regarding noise
legislation in those countries.
It is doubtful if even the most assiduous company marketing director
would have found everything required, resulting in the potential of lost
opportunity. But by virtue of our membership of the EU, the European
Commission makes this easy through the EuroInfoCentre route.
Go to Strasbourg and you have a good chance of seeing how they clean
their streets with Scottish -- or as the French might now see it --
European equipment. The Falkirk firm now competes effectively throughout
the community.
However, in business, today is today and tomorrow, well that's another
story. I see a somewhat negative side to the performance of Scottish
business relative to the opportunities presented by the application of
technology in SME industry and Commission-funded research.
Again, these are real opportunities for the taking, only available
because of memembership of the EU.
EuroInfoCentre Ltd is involved in another European Commission
initiative, namely the VALUE Relay Centre network. We are the
co-ordinating partner for the VALUE Relay Centre for Scotland and
Northern England, one of 32 spread thoughout the EU, aimed at promoting
both the participation of companies in the multi-million-pound EC
programmes of funding for Research and Technological Development and the
application of results from them.
In this area, Scottish SMEs have been slow to seize upon
opportunities.
Funding in this category is made available under Framework Programmes
which span four-year periods. Looking at the last of those periods, the
Third Framework Programme, figures show that, of the research funding
obtained in Scotland, more than 95% went to research institutes
(universities etc,) and of the 5% paid to industry, the amount claimed
by SMEs (using an EC definition of under 500 employees) was a fraction
of 1%.
Yet, in Germany, the SME sector -- the Mittelstand, or backbone of
German industry -- received a much healthier 21% of the funding.
The latest Fourth Framework Programme for 1994-98, which has just
started calling for proposals, has a budget for collaborative research
of #9.5bn.
These are practical programmes aimed at making companies more
competitive. Yet the uptake of them, despite the additional local
assistance offered in terms of financial aid and support expertise,
remains at a relatively low ebb compared with our continental
colleagues.
There is a simple message here. Take advantage, or fall behind and
suffer the consequences.
It is essential that more businesses of the type already taking
advantage of the TED scheme should also take advantage of the research
programmes.
Away from the television cameras and the newspaper headlines of the
political debate, the more enlightened companies, which provide our
wealth and jobs, seem more and more committed to the benefits of EU
membership.
It may sound ludicrously simple, but much of the benefit to be gained
by businesses from our EU membership is there for the asking! The
EuroInfoCentre in Glasgow is at 50 Waterloo Street and our telephone
number is 0141-221 0999.
Ian Traill, Director of EuroInfoCentre Ltd, Glasgow, was talking to
Yvonne Wightman.

SCOTTISH businessmen were urged yesterday to act quickly if they want
a share of the growing market for consumer goods in Russia and not to be
deterred by the difficulties of investing and selling in the Russian
Federation.
The Russian Consul-General in Scotland, Gennady Lazutkin, emphasised
that Russia was ''open for business'' and was not merely interested in
selling its vast reserves of raw materials.
He told members of the Edinburgh Businessmen's Breakfast Club that
Russia was looking for investment in various sectors including
manufacturing industries.
Anyone who had already done business in Russia would be familiar with
the difficulties, but companies should ''look beyond the issues of today
to the market of tomorrow.''
Mr Lazutkin emphasised that his government was trying to ensure
political and economic stability by fighting crime and corruption.
He said many organisations and factories were buying equipment to
refurbish their facilities. Mr Lazutkin added that the Russian people
wanted vast quantities of consumer goods -- a demand which would not be
quickly satisfied.
Echoing the words of the Russian Ambassador to the UK who spoke in
Edinburgh in December, Mr Lazutkin said: ''Make your decisions carefully
but swiftly.''
Mr Lazutkin also spoke of the ''great grief'' of the Chechnya
conflict, which had threatened the stability of the Russian Federation,
but said the transformation of Russia from a Communist dictatorship into
a democratic state was continuing.
In an interview after his speech, Mr Lazutkin said that, if Scottish
businessmen did not become involved in Russia soon, they could find
themselves ''at the end of the queue''.

<TEXT>
SCOTTISH business and consumers alike tend to view Japanese industry
as a model of efficiency that we can only aspire to, so the news that 10
Japanese quality assessors have been in Scotland attending a training
course being run specifically for them by certification body, BMT
Quality Assessors, could come as a surprise.
The 10 Japanese visitors are here as a crucial step in the growth of
Stirling-based BMT Quality Assessors with expansion into Japan being
only one international development that this ambitious business is
pursuing.
Surprising as it may seem -- especially to those companies critical of
the whole BS5750 registration scene -- British industry is at the
forefront of the delivery of quality standards when compared with
international competition and, in particular, Britain's National
Accreditation Council for Certification Bodies, (NACCB) is held in high
esteem.
As a result, BMT Quality Assessors, which is accredited through NACCB,
has negotiated an agreement with the Japan Management Association to
provide assessment and certification of Japanese companies to the
international ISO 9000 standard, which itself was born out of the
orginal BS5750 standard developed here.
Managing director Isaac Walsh explained: ''It is clear that Japanese
industry believes in the standards set by the NACCB.
''They view this accreditation as a vital tool for improving their
credibility and success in international markets. Of course, we are
delighted to have won this business which will add substantially to our
activities.
''It is difficult to quantify how much more business this will bring
in because, as well as using the newly-trained Japanese assessors to
work on our behalf in Japan, we will also be accrediting the European
operations of many Japanese companies.''
A wholly-owned subsidiary of British Maritime Technology, BMT Quality
Assessors is the only accreditation body operating solely out of
Scotland and although their client-base includes more than 250 British
organisations, Mr Walsh sees the new Japanese connection as another
important move in a burgeoning export trade.
''Certification business in the whole Pacific rim is ready to
mushroom,'' he confirmed.
Mr Walsh is also active in a number of other worldwide markets,
including Canada, India, and the Middle East.
The export successes mean that BMT Quality Assessors will continue to
recruit to meet the growing demand. The company was set up in 1991 with
four employees.

Lord Hanson said yesterday that the Labour Party was still not to be
trusted in power. ''Remember what happened to inflation and the pound in
your pocket last time we had a Labour government'' he said.
Speaking at the AGM, he told shareholders that he still regarded the
Conservative Party as the best party for business in the UK. ''The
Labour Party is funded mainly by the unions and someone has to finance
its opposition,'' he said. Although the Conservative Party was having a
rough time it was still ''a party which truly believes in the creation
of national wealth, not spending it,''said Lord Hanson.
The Labour Party hit back saying that Lord Hanson was blinkered and
ill-informed. Jack Cunningham, Shadow Secretary of State for Trade and
Industry, said industry and commerce were increasingly talking to the
Labour Party to develop a new consensus on industrial policy.
''Lord Hanson stands out as blinkered, ill-informed and hopelessly
politically-biased,'' said Mr Cunningham in response to Lord Hanson's
remarks. ''Whilst he personally may have done well out of Tory policies
for industry he cannot pretend that the same is true for British
industry as a whole,'' he added.
Lord Hanson enjoyed a warm relationship with former Prime Minister
Baroness Thatcher. Hanson has long been a generous donor to the Tory
Party. Last year the company gave #100,000 to the Conservatives,
unchanged on the previous year. It also gave #15,000 to the right-wing
Centre for Policy Studies.

DOUBLE champion ''Prince'' Naseem Hamed yesterday continued a
blossoming love affair with Scotland and its boxing fans when he
appeared back in Glasgow just 11 days after having drawn a full house to
the SECC to see him defending his WBC International super-bantamweight
championship.
Yesterday he announced that he would again be breaking new ground by
defending his crown -- he also holds the European bantam title -- in
Livingston on Saturday, March 4, against Argentinian Sergio Liendo.
He said also that he has been made so welcome north of the Border that
he hopes to buy a house in Scotland.
When he fulfils what he believes to be his destiny of winning the
first of several world titles this summer, he would be happy if he got
the opportunity in Glasgow. ''The Scottish fans are magnificent,'' he
said. ''They gave me such tremendous support last time and I would be
happy to fight here again and again.''
The man, who gave himself the regal addition to his name, was an
instant hit when he entertained the crowd last month before demolishing
Mexico's Armando Castro in four rounds. Now he is set to take his
uncanny boxing talents and flair for the unusual to West Lothian.
The 25-year-old challenger from South America has a record of 41 wins,
four defeats and three draws. Liendo has never been stopped, but the wee
man from Sheffield is convinced this will not be the case after March 4.
Asked what he knew about his opponent, Naz grinned and said: ''I know
he is going to get knocked out, and when I have studied videos of him in
action I will tell you in which round it will happen.''
The show, which will feature a minimum 10 contests and may include
another championship fight, will go ahead at The Forum with a capacity
of just over 3000. Tickets will range from #20 to #100. Londoner Frank
Warren again will promote, in association with Glasgow's Katherine
Morrison, and special buses will be laid on to take West of Scotland
fans up the M8 and back.
The unbeaten Hamed said: ''I just can't wait to perform before my
Scottish fans again,'' he said. ''When they see a real champion they
give him their full backing.''
The wee man was serious about his intention to come back to Scotland
again and again. He said: ''The Sheffield public is not the boxing
public it should be with a champion in their midst. But Scotland --
that's entirely different. I even hope to buy myself a house up here.
That's how much I like it.''
Hamed will travel to Cardiff at the weekend to see world featherweight
champion Steve Robinson defend his title, and to issue a challenge to
the winner to meet him. But he also has world title options at the
lighter weights of super-bantam and bantam.
Other boxers down to perform on March 4 are Dennis Andries, the
48-year-old who won the British cruiserweight title in Glasgow last
month, Nicky Piper, Dave Anderson, Brian Carr, James Murray, John
Wilson, and Sean Heron.

HANSON has no plans to sell its Imperial Tobacco business despite
mounting pressure on the tobacco industry from the health lobby on both
sides of the Atlantic.
On Tuesday, legal aid was granted to a group of several hundred
British smokers who want to sue Imperial and four other tobacco
companies in the UK for compensation for ill health.
The company's chairman, Lord Hanson, said: ''Imperial continues to
produce excellent results under first-class management. We intend to
continue to run a proper and legitimate tobacco company,'' he said at
the AGM yesterday. He added that he believed that adults have a right to
choose for themselves whether to smoke or not.
Imperial Tobacco is the UK's second-largest manufacturer of tobacco
products with 36.5% market share. Its principal brands include Embassy,
John Player Special, Castella Panatella, and Henri Wintermans. The
business has traditionally provided Hanson with substantial operating
profits and cash flow. In the year to 30 September, 1994, profits grew
by 7% to #328m on 6% higher sales of #3254m.
Hanson is known to be keen to boost its UK revenues for tax reasons
and so any sale of Imperial Tobacco would not appear to make financial
sense. Indeed, Imperial is busy trying to build up its overseas sales to
offset a predicted decline in its UK market. China and Russia, where
smoking is still popular, are targeted markets.
The group's stated desire to increase UK revenues coupled with its
stronger balance sheet has led to speculation that the company is on the
lookout for a potential takeover target. Typically, Hanson has
concentrated on mature basic businesses where there is little risk of
new technology undermining its strong market positions.
Spirits group Allied Domecq, retail group Kingfisher and a regional
electricity company have all been mentioned as possible targets.
Yesterday, bid speculation centred on Costain, the troubled UK
construction and engineering group. It was recently forced to announce
that the sale of its remaining US coal-mining interests in Kentucky was
likely to take place ''at a substantial discount to their net book
value''.
In recent years Hanson has become more focused in its business
activities. Costain would fit neatly into Hanson's building products
division which includes ARC, the largest aggregates and second-largest
coated stone and ready-mix concrete manufacturer in England and Wales.
Hanson also has substantial American coal-mining activities in Peabody,
the largest US coal producer.

SCOTTISH athletics, its budget slashed and its major international
event in jeopardy, has asked entrepreneur Gerry Weisfeld if he can
salvage the sport's principal fixture this year.
Weisfeld, a leading player in the financial package which rescued
Celtic, said yesterday that he would like to help with Scotland's track
and field match, against Israel, Turkey, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
But with a final decision needed next week, and budgets already
committed, he said assistance, if it could be offered, would be limited.
''Being Jewish by birth, I'd very much like to help,'' said Weisfeld.
''But we get a lot of requests of this kind, and it is very short
notice.''
The fixture, staged in Istanbul and Tel Aviv during the past two
years, would cause great embarrassment to the Scottish Athletic
Federation if they were forced to cancel, now that hosting it is their
responsibility.
Syria expressed an interest in competing this year, and though now
dormant for this year's match, in July, that could be revived in future.
As Weisfeld observed, initiatives which help heal traditional enmities
deserve to succeed.
The SAF has been in touch with Glasgow Jewish Welfare Board, and other
potential sponsors, but landing backers will not be helped if current
policies in Glasgow should become widespread.
TSB, backers of this weekend's national age-group championships at the
Kelvin Hall, and the schools event there a week today, have been ordered
to confine promotional material to one banner and one board -- hardly
the kind of policy to bring potential sponsors flocking to use the
facility.
Richard Ellis, spokesman for the bank said: ''I can't understand this
attitude. We have never covered up any of the city's branding, and as
far as I'm aware, have done nothing to upset them. Hopefully, through
discussion, we can come to an amicable agreement.
''We organise about 500 events throughout Britain, and the Kelvin Hall
is the only place where we have any difficulty. We have just given money
to the Scottish Schools Association, for indoor coaching, much of which
will take place at the Kelvin Hall. It makes you wonder why we bother.''
A spokesman for Glasgow Parks and Recreation department said last
night that the city was looking into the matter.

FORMER Scotland and British Lions captain Finlay Calder has called for
summer rugby in Scotland even if it means scrapping the Five Nations'
Championship.
Calder, who led the Lions to a historic series win over the
Australians in 1989 and won the last of his 32 Scotland caps during the
1991 World Cup, has aligned himself with current Scotland skipper Gavin
Hastings, who advocated summer rugby in his recently published
autobiography.
The 1990 Grand Slam flanker, who now coaches Stewart's Melville FP,
declared yesterday: ''In Scotland we fight a continual battle with the
elements. From November to February, it is sheer hell. The conditions
that we have to train and play in are appalling.
''The season should begin in April and if that means Scotland opting
out of the Five Nations' Championship, then so be it. In world terms it
is purely and simply a district competition.''
0 He argued: ''The Five Nations' -- like it or not -- is a regional
competition and if we want to test ourselves against the best in the
world then we should be playing, on a regular basis, South Africa, New
Zealand, and Australia.''
However, the television rights alone are worth nearly #30m a year and
Scotland's Five Nations' opener at 67,500-seat Murrayfield on Saturday
is a sell-out.
''Is that what it's all about?'' asked Calder. ''Is it just about
bringing in the cash so that the SRU can rebuild Murrayfield? How long
can the SRU go on charging #22-a-time for a seat at Murrayfield -- and
then the team gets porked? If that goes on for much longer then the
punters will begin voting with their feet and Scotland will be playing
in an empty stadium.''
Already this season Calder has upset the establishment by maintaining
that the traditional club game should be the linchpin of the sport.
The SRU and director of rugby Jim Telfer are keen to develop the
under-supported district championship as the main focus for Scotland's
top players. But Calder said: ''The clubs have to be the thing, just as
they are in Wales. If we go down the district route, which people just
aren't interested in, then we will lose so much about the game which is
good, and that includes club loyalty and the support that clubs have
traditionally enjoyed.''
* IRELAND'S reserve scrum-half, Niall Hogan, has pulled out of his
country's squad for the match at Murrayfield. Hogan has failed to
overcome a rib injury sustained in a club match last week.
His place on the bench goes to Blackrock College player Alain Rolland,
who has been promoted from the replacements in the Ireland A team. His
place there goes to Andy Matchett of Ballymena.
Ireland manager Noel Murphy is hopeful that hooker Keith Wood has
overcome the shoulder problem which curtailed his training.
* THE row over Murrayfield pirate hospitality packages rumbled on
yesterday, with SRU advisers Carnegie Sports International declaring
that in all likelihood they would fight any legal action which corporate
hospitality operator Mike Burton might bring against them.
The Herald revealed yesterday that Carnegie were mounting an
undercover operation at hospitality functions for the game against
Ireland on Saturday with tickets they had bought from the blackmarket.
The SRU has said they reserves the right to eject from the stadium
anybody found in possession of a black-market ticket.
Carnegie claim that, despite his denials, the Mike Burton Group are
staging a corporate hospitality function at an Edinburgh hotel on
Saturday. Burton says that the SRU are operating in contravention of
European law by attempting to restrain the trade of competitors in the
hospitality business.
* SCOTLAND skipper Gavin Hastings was last night passed fit to lead
the side against Ireland at Murrayfield on Saturday after a
precautionary medical check on a back strain. Hastings will be making
his fifty-third appearance for Scotland -- a new Scottish cap record.
The forwards trained at Murrayfield last night when prop Peter Wright,
who could not take part in Sunday's squad session because of a calf
strain, played a full part.
Dundee HS FP lock Stewart Campbell, who is aiming to make his Five
Nations' debut on Saturday, did not complete the session because of
cramp in his right thigh. But it is said to be virtually certain that he
will play.

GLASGOW-based Vico Properties continues to expand rapidly, with two
purchases totalling #2m since the New Year.
The property group, which shrugged off the recession and has enjoyed
seven straight years of earnings growth, paid Swedish bank Svenska
Handelsbanken #1.6m for a portfolio of office and retail premises in
Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dunfermline.
Group property director Colin Taylor is confident of letting vacant
space in the 12,000 sq ft office building in Golden Square, Aberdeen,
seeing an opportunity to improve an ''already attractive'' initial
yield.
Interest has already been expressed by potential lessees. The office
building was the major part of the purchase, with the small shop in
Dunfermline already sold to a private investor at a profit.
Vico has also paid #425,000 for several shops in Motherwell, whose
tenants include Strathclyde Regional Council and the British Red Cross.
The properties currently offer a yield of nearly 14%.
Only last month, the property group announced the purchase, for an
undisclosed sum, of a three-acre site in Musselburgh.
It pre-sold part of the proposed retail development to German food
discounting giant Aldi.
Vico has also pre-sold a development in Rutherglen, Glasgow, on a site
which it bought for more than #500,000, to the German retail group.
Mr Taylor said: ''We are extremely active at the moment in Scotland.
We have several projects which we are working on and are endeavouring to
make new purchases all the time.''

Clydebank 1, Hearts 1
LIKE many another team before them, Hearts found Kilbowie Park a tough
hunting ground in the Tennents Scottish Cup third-round tie and went
back up the M8 last night happy to be getting another chance on their
own pitch next Monday.
Bankies may not have been in great form in the first division
recently, but invariably seemed to revel in taking on the big shots on
their home pitch, and they made life difficult for the premier division
side.
Hearts had found the first division team prepared to match their own
attempts at playing a passing game and the consequence was a cup-tie
unusually ordered, especially at this type of ground.
The Edinburgh side seemed to have taken the measure of their opponents
at the time they went ahead from a John Robertson penalty. Maybe they
had, but the equaliser from Ken Eadie -- who seems to have been scoring
goals for decades in Clydebank -- came before they were able to settle
properly in front.
From then on it was anybody's guess who would be next to score, and
for a spell in the second half Clydebank held the initiative, although
they didn't create many real chances. Their best players were in defence
where Sean Sweeney and, in particular, Scott Murdoch did sterling work,
while the same could be said of Dave McPherson, who was Hearts' most
proficient player.
It was not difficult to guess which of the two managers was happier.
Brian Wright, of Clydebank, felt that his team had done themselves
proud. ''My only disappointment is that we did not go on to win the
game,'' he said. ''But we have no fears of going to Tynecastle.'' For
Hearts, manager Tommy McLean it was ''a below-par performance.''
Even if he did get his name on the score sheet, Robertson will know he
could have done it much earlier. Craig Levein did the running from deep
in defence, but his pass towards Brian Hamilton was diverted into the
path of the striker who was defied by a good blocking run from keeper
Gary Matthews.
The first division lads came scurrying back, but Hearts got the break
they were due in 30 minutes when they were awarded a penalty after Gary
Mackay had been sandwiched inside the penalty area by Derek Crawford and
Steve Jack.
Despite his earlier miss, Robertson had no problem with the spot kick.
But if Hearts thought that was the job done they soon learned
differently. Within three minutes Flannigan sped down the right and when
his cross came over, Eadie headed the ball firmly into the far side of
the net.
Kevin Thomas didn't appear for the second half, Willie Jamieson taking
his place.
Murdoch became the first man to be booked after he pulled down Hagen
from behind. Then Bankies nearly snatched the lead with a Lansdowne
effort which was just off target.
Crawford, who had suffered an injury, had to leave the field to be
replaced by John Walker. A few minutes later Jim Bett also had to be
replaced because of injury, John Colquhoun coming on.
CLYDEBANK -- Matthews, McStay, Crawford, Murdoch, Sweeney, Currie,
Cooper, Landsdowne, Eadie, Flannigan, Jack. Substitutes -- Walker,
Grady, Monaghan.
HEARTS -- Nelson, Frail, Miller, Levein, Mackay, McPherson, Hamilton,
Bett, Thomas, Robertson, Hagen. Substitutes -- Colquhoun, Jamieson,
Smith.
Referee -- H Williamson (Renfrew).

A FIFE-based computer company, described as a superb example of
Scottish talent and poised to exploit a share of a market worth #400m by
1998, has won the region's latest Exporter of the Year award.
The award to Calluna Technology of Glenrothes was made by the Fife
Export Club, which is supported by the regional council.
Runners up were Buko of Glenrothes and Butler Building Systems from
Kirkcaldy, which were also said to have demonstrated significant
achievements in export markets.
Calluna manufactures and markets a range of miniature hard-disk drives
for use in computerised equipment -- selling 85% of its output abroad.
The company is looking to new goals because it is one of only four
known manufacturers throughout the world making removable 1.8 inch card
hard-disk drives for use in small notebook computers, and in many other
portable applications.
The company, which started with capital of #500,000 three years ago,
predicted that it would achieve break-even point this year. It is
looking to a market which could grow to #400m within the next three
years.
The company's marketing administration manager, Wacek Kaczmarczyk,
said the firm was ready for strong growth in the market, with a facility
capable of turning out 150,000 units a year.
He added: ''All design and development work is carried out at
Glenrothes by a team of Scottish engineers, and we see no difficulty in
more talent being attracted to swell the present workforce of 50 as
demand rises.''

NORTHERN Area champion Kevin Anderson will partner Jimmy River --
unbeaten in his last seven point-to-points -- in the first meeting of
the season at Alnwick.
If it goes ahead, the West Percy and Milvain meeting, postponed last
Saturday because the course was waterlogged, will be a historic occasion
-- the first Sunday race meeting with betting in the north.
The Jockey Club gave permission for it to be switched to avoid a clash
with the Witton Castle meeting in North Yorkshire.
Anderson, the five-times champion who broke the northern record last
season with 17 winners, has four rides at this meeting.
Jimmy River, now 12, has been one of the most consistent pointers in
the north in recent seasons, and should get off to a winning start in
the men's open.
The Dumfriesshire rider also has Givower in the restricted race.
Anderson also rides Farrier's Favourite and Bogart's Disco in the two
maiden races.
Andrew Parker, runner-up to Anderson with 11 winners, also has four
rides. His best chance is in the confined race where he partners Royal
Stream.

THE current clamouring for kilts on the fashion scene should help put
a major retailing venture with a strong Scottish flavour on the road to
success.
Two couples have spent several million pounds constructing a mock
Victorian or early Edwardian lodge on the A9 by Blair Atholl, halfway
between Edinburgh and Inverness.
Among the attractions in the imposing House of Bruar are a cloth room,
cashmere hall and a 10,000sq ft main hall selling country clothing. The
development, which will open its doors on March 30, also has a food
hall, a restaurant and a garden/gift shop. Hunter's of Brora textiles,
Johnston's of Elgin knitwear and Barbour jackets will be among the
products on offer.
Initially, The House of Bruar will employ between 30 and 35 people,
although the workforce could grow significantly if a proposed worldwide
mail order venture takes off.
Behind the project are directors Mark and Linda Birkbeck, who in 1986
founded the Jumpers retail chain in Cumbria, which had more than 100
shops throughout the UK by the time it was bought by management in 1992.
The other driving forces are joint managing directors John and Pam
Clark, who ran Malsis boarding school in North Yorkshire for 19 years.
Mr Clark, a Yorkshireman, believes quality is the key to successful
selling of Scottish products to tourists and considers the environment
in The House of Bruar crucial to this image.
By obtaining lower prices through collective buying, he hopes the
company can achieve the strong margins necessary to justify its major
investment.
Taking comfort from the current popularity of Scottish national dress,
Mr Clark said: ''It is quite fortunate at the moment that kilts and so
on are very much in favour.''

FRANCOIS Boutin, one of the most successful Flat trainers of all time,
died of cancer at the American Hospital in Paris yesterday, aged 58.
Boutin first took out a full training licence in 1964, having served
as assistant to Etienne Pollet.
During his career he captured virtually every Group 1 prize his
country had to offer, and was by no means a stranger to success on this
side of the Channel -- indeed his first classic victory was achieved in
England when La Lagune ran out a five-length winner of the 1968 Oaks.
Boutin went on to win the Prix du Jockey-Club on two occasions -- with
Caracolero in 1974 and Hernando in 1993 -- and the Prix de Diane three
times, courtesy of Northern Trick (1984), Lacovia (1986), and Resless
Kara (1988).
His best horse in recent years was the brilliant filly, Miesque, who
was owned by his chief patron, Greek shipping magnate Stavros Niarchos.
Miesque, who won the 1987 General Accident 1000 Guineas, went on to
win the Group 1 Prix Jacques Le Marois twice (1987 and 1988) and the
Breeders' Cup Mile in the same seasons, the only European-trained horse
to win two races in Breeders' Cup history.
He will also be remembered for Arazi's stunning dismissal of his
rivals in the 1991 Breeders' Cup Juvenile.
Boutin, a widower, leaves one son and two daughters from his first
marriage. In 1989, he was remarried, to Princess Lucy Ruspoli.

EUROPE's first hi-tech repair facility for Liquid Crystal Display
units has been established in Lanarkshire.
East Kilbride-based Display Products Technology is the only company in
Europe offering the repair service for LCDs, which are used in a huge
range of electronics equipment from car dashboards to lap-top computers.
Until now, defective units have either had to be scrapped or returned
to Japan costing major manufacturing companies in silicon glen and
throughout Europe millions of pounds.
Launched with assistance from Lanarkshire Development Agency and
British Steel (Industry), Display Products is already handling more than
1500 units per month and expects that number of grow to 5000 by June.
The firm, which employs five people, has been set up by David Wares, a
former IBM employee and a laser physics and opto-electronics graduate
from Strathclyde University. His firm is taking advantage of a niche in
the market by offering electronics manufacturers in ''Silicon Glen'' a
competitive edge in servicing and repairing flat panel displays.
Mr Wares explained: ''Computer manufacturers are forced to spend
money, time and effort returning liquid crystal units to Japan. Even
Japanese manufacturers with UK interests have had to return defective
screens to Japan for repair.
However, with demand outstripping supply particularly for colour LCDs
turn-around time becomes an important factor for manufacturers. The
average turn-around time for repairs in Japan in 90 days -- our company
can complete repairs within 10 days with none of the additional freight
costs incurred.''
Display Products has established new state of the art clean room
facilities at its base in Kelvin Industrial estate and specialises in
sophisticated repairs such as tab-bonding and polariser replacement.
The company offers complete turnkey operation involving repair,
repackaging, and delivery to the manufacturer.
Display Products is in the process of securing further orders from
other electronic and computer manufacturers and has enlisted the
services of David Brain, former vice-president of Unisys in Scotland. As
a member of the firm's board, Mr Brain will have responsibility for
overseeing marketing and financial aspects of the business.
The company also secured help from Lanarkshire Development Agency,
which helped the firm find premises and offer a range of advice and
assistance.
Andy McNab, the agency's enterprise and development manager, said:
''We're delighted that DPT has decided to set up in Lanarkshire and we
are convinced that this up and coming hi-tech company will continue to
grow and create many more jobs in the future.''
Rod McLaren, regional executive of British Steel (Industry) added:
''The sort of service and repair facility DPT provides will prove
invaluable to a range of companies in the electronics field throughout
the UK and beyond.
''We're delighted to support a business involved in technology which
can only become more important in the future.''

EIGHT years ago Bill Rowan decided to strike out on his own and
invested his life's savings in a small public house.
The #5000 he invested has proved very worthwhile for Bill's latest
venture, The Granary restaurant bar on the outskirts of Dalgety Bay in
Fife, cost #750,000 to build last year.
It goes without saying he is delighted with the success of The
Granary, which now serves 2,000 meals every week.
''It has doubled every forecast we made,'' he says, ''and in its first
year will turn over around #1m''.
Another indication of its success is that The Granary has reached the
last six of a UK-wide competition for a Pub Design of the Year award.
''There were more than 200 entries from throughout Britain,'' explains
Bill, ''and I am really delighted to get so far particularly as I was up
against some of the big brewery companies''.
He now intends to repeat this success story. ''I have another
four-acre site in Fife and I intend to start building a second Granary
on it later this year,'' he says.
Although he and his wife Alex spend most of their time at their latest
venture they also have to keep an eye on their other business interests
which includes the Tranmare Hotel in Tranent, Nicols Bar and Mamma Mia
Italian restaurant in Kirkcaldy.
Bill started in the licensed trade as a barman with Scottish &amp;
Newcastle Breweries, and at 21 he became their youngest manager when he
was put in charge of a bar in Rose Street, Edinburgh.

ACCOUNTANT Jim Wylie did not need a lot of convincing when Don
O'Driscoll told him about his proposed new business venture.
Don wanted to build a #500,000 clay pigeon school in central Scotland
and Jim, who had been Don's pupil, knew that he could do the job.
Jim's firm Wylie Frame helped Don, a Scottish internationalist clay
pigeon shooter, to draw up the business plan and find the necessary
finance.
The main difficulty was finding a suitable site. For obvious reasons
the school had to be remote but eventually Don found a 15-acre site at
Garbethill Muir three miles from Cumbernauld.
Now Don's dream is a reality, and he is looking forward to attracting
1000 members to his Central Scotland Shooting School although the
facility will also be open to the general public who want to learn the
sport.
He is well qualified for the job, having captained the Scottish Clay
Target shooting team and represented his country 20 times.
He is confident that many of Scotland 20,000 clay pigeon shooters will
use his new facilities, which includes a club house with restaurant and
a VIP lounge for corporate outings.
''In addition to our members,'' says don, ''I would hope to attract
corporate days out and charity events''.
Don also plans to have special Ladies Days as he explains: ''It is a
sport that ladies can compete in at the highest level, and I would hope
that more would take it up.''
Gun makers Winchester are also talking to Don about the possibility of
sponsoring Open Days aimed at newcomers to the sport.
On a busy day Don would expect the school to use about 20,000 clay
pigeons, and he points out that one hundred and thirty million targets
are 'used' every year in the UK.

RESTAURATEUR Malcolm Duck enjoys a good wine and he still recalls with
relish his trip ''Down Under'' last year when he tasted 200 wines in one
day.
''We tasted 120 wines in the morning, 50-odd over lunch and had
another 24 wines at dinner, says Malcolm. ''It was a hard day's work.
Tasting wine is different from drinking the stuff. For a start you are
not supposed to swallow it.''
He admits however the some of his companions on the trip did not
adhere strictly to this principal and were slightly the worse for wear
as the day progressed.''
Malcolm owns Le Marche Noir in Edinburgh and enjoys offering his
customers a nice wine to go with their meal although as yet no one has
ordered his Petrus '66 which is on the wine list at #685.
''It has been asked for by customers,'' explains Malcolm, ''but it has
to be drunk properly, and we would expect people who wanted to enjoy it
to phone the day before so that it can be opened''.
Malcolm has not always been in the restaurant trade. His other
occupations include being a British Rail porter, a van driver and for 10
years an officer in the Royal Marines.
During his spell in the marines, Malcolm, saw action in the Falklands
and was involved in the taking of Two Sisters, a hill around Port
Stanley.
He left the Royal Marines in 1991 and took over the running of the Le
Marche Noir which he had invested in while in service. It was not his
first association with the premises. In 1979 while working as a van
driver he regularly dropped in for a coffee when it was Bob's Cafe.
Malcolm is now chairman of the Edinburgh Restaurateurs Association
with the aim of helping to make Edinburgh ''a livelier place''. His
philosophy is to ''enjoy life, smile and be happy''.
When not trying to keep his customers happy Malcolm can be found on
the rugby pitches around the capital trying to keep 30 players happy as
a referee.

WEST Indian all-rounder Malcolm Marshall was yesterday confirmed as
Scotland's 'hired-hand' for this seasons Benson and Hedges Cup and
NatWest Trophy matches.
SCU Director of Cricket, Jim Love, said he hoped that the inclusion of
Marshall would benefit Scottish cricket.
''Malcolm is still a major name in the game and I'd hope that he'd
create interest by putting bums in seats. But more importantly, he's a
superb cricketer and, hopefully, his expertise will rub off on some of
our bowlers.''
Marshall, currently with Natal, will pro this summer with Lancashire
League club Denton. But Love confirmed that the former Hampshire
all-rounder would be available if the Scots progressed in either of the
one-day competitions.
Marshall however, won't face the Windies during their one-day stop-off
in Edinburgh in June.
With 376 wickets to his name, Marshall is still the fourth leading
wicket taker in Test match cricket, and follows other West Indians
Desmond Haynes and Gordon Greenidge in playing for Scotland.
A more contentious issue, however, is the appointment of Yorkshireman
Love as captain for the four B &amp; H ties, and the NatWest game.
Love, who adopted the same role against Lanacashire in last season's
NatWest match at Old Trafford, takes over from Alastair Storie.
With no-one jumping out as a natural leader, Love is a short-gap
appointment until someone can be groomed to take command.

ENGLAND cricket captain Mike Atherton will urge his players to take
the 'spirit of Adelaide' into tomorrow's final Test.
A month ago, England were facing the real possibility of an Ashes
whitewash after their thumping defeats in Brisbane and Melbourne.
But now the unexpected chance to finish all-square with Australia
beckons -- and Atherton wants nothing, not even the sharp eye of match
referee John Reid, to puncture a new-found mood of confidence and
self-belief.
Reid interrupted England's victory party in Adelaide on Monday night
to hand Chris Lewis a #650 fine for pointing Craig McDermott to the
pavilion and issue a reprimand to Atherton for failing to prevent his
all-rounder from stepping out of line.
But nothing could spoil the players' celebrations after their 106-run,
series-reviving victory.
And while Atherton says he has ''no quibbles'' with either of Reid's
judgments, he is desperate for his team to show the same level of
controlled aggression in Perth.
''You cannot play worrying about the referee,'' said Atherton. ''He's
there to do a job and all the players accept that. We have to play hard
but fair and be as aggressive as Australia.''
To finish 2-2 with Australia after what happened during November and
December would be an outstanding achievement -- and a memorable farewell
present for Graham Gooch and Mike Gatting.
Gooch, England's record runmaker, has already announced this Test will
be his last while Gatting looks set to retire from international cricket
as well after Perth.
Atherton must be tempted to name an unchanged XI after the way his
patched-up team played in Adelaide. But there are options for him to
consider.
Mark Ramprakash, summoned from the A tour of India, could come in as a
sixth batsman which would leave the selectors to choose between Lewis
and spinner Phil Tufnell.
Whatever combination takes the field, England will attack. A positive
result is always likely on Perth's fast, bouncy pitch and their captain
would rather lose the series 3-1 going for a win than sit back.
England (probable) -- Gooch, Atherton, Gatting, Thorpe, Crawley,
Ramprakash, Rhodes, Lewis, DeFreitas, Fraser, Malcolm, Tufnell.
Australia (from) -- Taylor, Slater, Boon, M Waugh, S Waugh, Blewett,
Healy, Julian, Warne, McDermott, Angel, McGrath.
* TEENAGE debutant Henry Olonga, Zimbabwe's first black Test
cricketer, took a wicket with his third delivery after his side has
piled up 544 for four declared in the first Test against Pakistan in
Harare yesterday.
A double-century from opener Grant Flower and hundreds from his
brother, Andy, and Guy Whittall lifted Zimbabwe to their highest Test
score, beating the 462 for nine recorded against Sri Lanka in Bulawayo
in October.
Pakistan had made 51 for one by the close of the second day.

* MY late dad was a major investor in sport. He did the football pools
every week, staking ten bob. Religiously, he sat down on Saturday
evenings to check his coupon. It was the only religion he had, so far as
I can remember.
The plummy voice upon the wireless read the litany, like a peer of the
realm contemplating a field of cow-pats. Accrington Stanley 1, Port Vale
2 (''Aha!'' -- dad.). West Bromwich Albion 3, Sheffield Wednesday 3
(''Blast!'' -- dad.). Names with an exotic sense of drabness.
I wonder what he would have made of the National Lottery. He'd have
had a go, but he would never have deserted the pools which gave him a
lifetime of happy tension and, once, a postal order for 2/6d. Not like
others are doing, reducing the pools companies' takings, turning masses
of easy money into slightly smaller masses of easy money.
But one pools operator has moved to outwit its spiv-like rival, that
millionaire-maker with flashing lights and dancing girls. At the
beginning of the season, the pools changed their system of awarding
points to create fewer winners, but bigger ones. Now, Zetters Pools has
changed tack, to make fewer jackpots and many more smaller winners.
''Crafty,'' said The Braces yesterday about this epoch-yawning event.
''That's everyone's criticism of the lottery: 17 millionaires would have
made more people happy than a #17m punter who left town.''
But I was puzzled about the points system the pools had originally
introduced to create bigger winners. They gave the maximum three points
only for a 1-1 draw: yet the 1-1 draw was the most popular result going
these days. Take the St Johnstone cup match against Stenhousemuir on
Tuesday . . .
The Braces said: ''Ah, but that was a postponed match from Saturday.
The pools panel had considered that game, and had put it down for a St
Johnstone win.''
What did that prove? The Braces said: ''It proves that you had to be a
damned sight smarter than the pools panel. Maybe that's the reason why
they changed the system back again -- to save embarrassment.''
This was taking us into actuarial regions which were as clear as mud.
But from somewhere, I thought I heard the voice of my old dad, saying
''Aha!'' It was back to the well-tried system of the lucky 2/6d, and
you'd never win that in the National Lottery.
* FARMING is a tough business, no doubt about it. At our weekend
retreat in Angus, we heard of the local tattie-baron telling his
slightly deaf orraman: ''Geordie, I'm puttin' the Bottom Field tae set
aside.'' ''Orright,'' said Geordie, which is probably why he's called an
orraman.
The next thing the farmer saw was Geordie out in the Bottom Field on
his tractor, spraying for all he was worth. ''What're ye daein', ye
eeejit,'' he bellowed, as soon as he could get within two inches of
Geordie's ear. ''Ah said this park was for set-aside.''
''Ach,'' said Geordie. ''Ah thocht ye said insecticide.'' The tractor
was out of the field before you could say ''Brussels''.
The farmer told me this story in his warm kitchen, full of the smell
of fresh baking. (The farmer had just been to the bakers for rolls: his
wife was away on a world cruise). His eyes kept straying to his TV set.
When I looked harder I saw it wasn't exactly a TV but a dealing-room
monitor which happened to be showing share movements in Tokyo. ''Ach, I
jist dae it for amusement,'' he said, his eyes hardening slightly as he
made a quick note with his pencil on the paper bag from the bakery and
picked up his mobile phone.
Yesterday, I noted that Scottish tattie-growers have doubled their
income without having to plant an extra spud. Funny he didn't mention
that.

A LANARKSHIRE foundry is working at full capacity because of oil
industry orders from Kuwait. Blantyre Castings is recruiting additional
staff to cope with the latest order for shackles for Kuwait Harbour and
other oil related work for the UK industry.
Production director Frank Hull said: ''We were hit by the closure of
Ravenscraig, but orders are picking up and we are now doing more work
for the oil and mining industries. We are starting a night shift to cope
with the extra work.''
Blantyre Castings was formed in November 1986 by Mr Hull and three
other colleagues, John Jenkins, finance director, Ian Campbell, quality
director and Charles Standerwick, technical sales director, after the
collapse of another Lanarkshire foundry company.
Frank Hull said: ''I suppose we were bucking the trend. We were the
first new foundry in Central Scotland for many years but we now employ
15 people and this will be increased by four when we start the night
shift.''
The Kuwait order is for ship to bouy shackles for the oil terminal at
Kuwait Harbour, and is the second order the company has received from
Kuwait.
Blantyre Castings was formed when Frank Hull, Ian Campbell and Charles
Standerwick were made redundant from the other foundry.
''People told us we must be off our heads when we suggested starting
another foundry but we were convinced we could do it.''

BURN Stewart has surprised the tightly knit Scotch whisky community by
appointing a leading corporate lawyer as group managing director.
Ian Bankier has taken up the post at the Barrhead-based distiller and
bottler after a career spent mainly advising a wide range of companies
on buy-outs, mergers, takeovers, and the like.
His connection with Burn Stewart is close however, having helped guide
the company since the original buy-out in 1988 through to the subsequent
Stock Exchange flotation three years later.
Bill Thornton, founder and chief executive, will focus on the role of
executive chairman to leave the day-to-day running of the company in the
hands of Mr Bankier, a self-confessed ''innocent'' in the ways of the
whisky world.
''I've learnt a lot sitting beside Bill for the past eight years or
so, but I admit that I've not been offered the job because of my
expertise in the whisky sector,'' Mr Bankier said yesterday.
''However I hope to bring different, more all-round business skills to
the company which will, dare I say it, blend well with the other
executive appointment,'' he added.
He was referring to the promotion of industry specialist Billy Walker,
Burn Stewart's production director, to the new role of managing director
(operations).
The shake-up appears to increase the likelihood that the company, a
young and tiny player in the whisky trade, will embark on more joint
ventures and high-level ''strategic alliances'' that could be vital for
its growth.
A former partner with McGrigor Donald, Mr Bankier left the firm two
years ago to set up his own consultancy and worked closely with Burn
Stewart as a non-executive corporate adviser.
''I've worked closely with this company for many years now and I see
this move as a natural progression designed to make the most of industry
opportunities as world whisky prices begin to recover,'' he said.
Mr Bankier, a non-executive director of Stakis, Murray Johnstone, and
Tulloch, will wind down his consultancy firm.
Involved almost entirely in the cheaper end of the whisky market, Burn
Stewart has struggled since flotation. It has been caught in the
crossfire of an price war between the majors which can afford to see out
a prolonged squeeze on margins.
Profits last year halved to #4.2m despite a 7% rise in turnover to
just over #40m.
Mr Thornton, who recently described trading conditions as the toughest
in memory, acknowledged that the new appointment would raise some
eyebrows among his industry colleagues.
''I will still call the shots in any strategic moves, but we feel that
Ian's experience will give us an edge in corporate development, an area
where we need to be more active,'' he said. ''The whisky trade is a
mature industry, sales are currently flat, and this is the road we must
go if we're to build up a long-term future.''
Burn Stewart has already made solid progress in moving away from its
former dependence on bulk shipments -- down to 18% from 40% three years
ago -- to the bottled-in-Scotland category, which now makes up
four-fifths of sales.
Scottish Leader, its main blend, has notched up a 53% increase in
volume sales, while the company's Deanston and Tobermory malts have
performed reasonably well.
Joint ventures have included deals with Chinese and Russian concerns,
and Burn Stewart's production and marketing of white spirits like gin
and vodka are certain to be expanded. Closer ties with the Dutch spirits
giant, Bols, which owns 10% of the company, are also likely.

#100,000 in prize money, could sound the starting pistol for an indoor
grand prix series.
Scotland's former Commonwealth champion, Ian Stewart, one of the
organisers, confirmed last night that he is trying to include a place
for Brian Whittle, Ayr Seaforth's double European indoor medallist at
400 metres.
The Ricoh Tour will cover four indoor meetings this month, in
Stuttgart, Lievin, Birmingham, and Stockholm. The sponsors are putting
up $150,000 -- $25,000 for the winners of six events. But spokesman
Nigel Swinscoe confirmed that sum would be at least doubled in support
for meeting organisers to ensure credible fields, and more again in
marketing.
The arrangement -- similar to the so-called Golden Four, which puts
gold ingots up for competition over the summer meetings in Oslo, Zurich,
Brussels, and Berlin -- could revolutionise the sport indoors, though it
is debateable how the bodies of leading competitors will stand up to the
additional demands.
Whittle, however, will be delighted to take the risk. His event, 400m,
in which he anchored Britain to relay victory in Birmingham last
Saturday, is one of four for men and two for women carrying the $25,000
prize.
The men's events are 60m, 400m, 3000m, and triple jump, plus the 60m
and 800m for women.
Stewart, head of the British Athletic Federation's event management
division, having confirmed that the deal, initially, was for two years,
said: ''The tour will raise dramatically the profile of indoor
athletics, and will give more opportunities for leading athletes to
participate.''
Only winners will be paid, the money going to the athlete with the
fastest aggregate time for the four contests, and to the triple jumper
whose total distance is greatest.
The first meeting is in Stuttgart on Sunday, followed by Lievin
(February 19), the KP Invitation meeting in Birmingham six days later,
and Stockholm on February 27.
* A PLAN to introduce prize money at the 1997 world championships has
been jeopardised by the Mexican financial crisis.
The International Amateur Athletic Federation gave #4.7m to the
organisers of the 1993 event in Stuttgart, and plan to do so again at
this year's championships in Gothenburg. But for the 1997 championships,
in Mexico City, the same sum was to go into a pool from which prize
money would be paid for the first time.
However, because of the peso crisis, the IAAF are being asked to give
the organisers up to #6.7m. Already, there are offers to stage the event
elsewhere. That would please endurance runners, who hate the thought of
another altitude championships.

Stirling Albion 1, Airdrie 2
TOP scorer Andy Smith was the Airdrie hero in an exciting Tennents
Scottish Cup third-round tie at Forthbank.
His sparkling double, which takes his season's tally to 17, earned the
Diamonds a home tie against first division rivals Dunfermline.
All three goals came in a five-minute spell, but there was no lack of
thrills throughout.
Airdrie threatened in three minutes when Alan Lawrence beat three
players in a mazy run before firing a 20-yard shot inches over.
But Alex MacDonald's side were lucky to survive a sweeping Albion raid
minutes later. An excellent run by Andy Paterson set up Joe McLeod and
only an intervention by Jimmy Sandison denied danger man Willie Watters.
The visitors were soon back on the attack, and Steve Cooper came close
with a header from a Kenny Black free kick.
Stirling's defence finally cracked in 27 minutes as Black and Sandison
created the chance for Andy Smith to blast home from six yards. The home
side fought back and three minutes later Ronnie McQuilter equalised with
a header from a Ross Kerr free kick.
But as the home fans celebrated, Smith restored the lead two minutes
later with a carbon copy of his first goal, this time firing home from
Black's measured cross.
Lawrence should have made it 3-1 but Mike Monaghan was at full stretch
to push his curling shot round a post.
Stirling came close on either side of the break. First, keeper John
Martin had to push a Graham Hay header over the bar to prevent an own
goal, then did well to hold a Kevin Drinkell header on the line from the
corner.
There was another anxious moment for the visitors in 59 minutes when
McLeod just failed to connect properly with a Paterson cross and Martin
scrambled the ball away.
STIRLING ALBION -- Monaghan, Paterson, Gibson, Mitchell, McQuilter,
Kerr, McInnes, Tait, Watters, Taggart, McLeod. Substitutes -- Drinkell,
Watson, McGeown.
AIRDRIE -- Martin, Stewart, T Smith, Sandison, Hay, Black, Boyle,
Lawrence, Cooper, Harvey, A Smith. Substitutes -- Wilson, McIntyre,
McCulloch.
Referee -- G A Evans (Bishopbriggs).
* LAST night's postponed Premier match between Partick Thistle and
Dundee United has been re-scheduled for Tuesday, February 14. The
programme for a busy midweek programme of cup and league matches next
week is:
Monday: Scottish Cup -- Falkirk v Motherwell (7.45); Hamilton v
Rangers; Meadowbank v Berwick. Tuesday: Scottish Cup -- Clyde v Dundee
United; Stenhousemuir v St Johnstone. Third division -- Alloa v East
Stirlingshire. Wednesday: First division -- Airdrie v Clydebank. Third

IBM's chief executive in the UK Javaid Aziz has resigned after just 19
months in the post. It is believed he is joining Silicon Graphite, a
computer chip manufacturer.
The move comes as a great surprise. It was said by an IBM spokesman
last night to be ''for personal reasons''.
The resignation took place yesterday and he was out of the IBM UK
headquarters building on the south bank of the Thames within hours. This
was described as ''normal in these circumstances''.
There was little sign last week when he presented IBM's results in
London that he was at all uncomfortable or that anything was afoot,
apart from some guardedness over the detail of the figures.
His departure comes as another major blow to Big Blue, which on
January 19 saw the departure of John McClelland, vice-president
manufacturing at Spango Valley in Greenock. He is going to Digital
Equipment, a major rival to IBM in personal computers.
Mr Aziz is being succeeded by Barrie Morgans.
One source suggested there could have been some frustration on Mr
Aziz's part with the parent because it was not prepared to give the
full-scale guarantees offered by some competitors, which had cut into
sales growth. However, IBM manufacturing quality is such that there
would seem very little risk of warranties having to be exercised.
Mr Aziz, a graduate in electronic and control systems engineering from
Loughborough University, joined IBM in 1975. He worked his way up,
having started as a graduate trainee.
He had huge experience of IBM's European operations including
marketing, being director of quality, and then in charge of sales in the
south of England. In 1992, he was appointed general manager for
marketing for IBM UK.
IBM was hard hit last year in the PC sector, losing global market
leadership to Compaq whose UK activities are based at Erskine. Compaq
adopted a much more aggressive pricing policy which resulted in its
market penetration rising from 8.1% to 10.3%, while IBM slid from 10.8%
to 8.5%.
IBM UK swung from operating losses of #119m into a surplus of #176m.
This was partly caused by an 8.6% rise in sales to #2532m. About #2000m
came from the Greenock manufacturing operations. Of this figure, about
#400m was due to PC sales, mostly exports.
Mr Aziz said the UK results showed a dramatic improvement and the
company was back on track. He added that Greenock had been selected as a
core manufacturing base for IBM PCs.

East Fife 1, Ross County 0
A PENALTY 11 minutes from time earned East Fife a fourth-round tie at
Rugby Park, where the Methil players will meet up again with the man who
previously had charge of them, Kilmarnock manager Alex Totten.
Fife created most of the chances in a tense encounter, with Paul
Hunter heading just over in five minutes and Robert Scott, Gilbert
Allan, and Dougie Hope all going close.
County's best chance came in 22 minutes when Johnstone Bellshaw's shot
was headed off the line Hamill.
East Fife should have taken the lead in 34 minutes when Alec Hamill
sent Hope clear but keeper Hutchison blocked his shot with his legs.
Six minutes later, County's Billy Herd was booked for a crude tackle
on Hunter and from the free kick a drive from Allan was deflected on to
the bar.
A neat move involving Allan and Scott set up another chance moments
later but the latter could not direct his shot on target.
County full back Chris Sommerville was sent off for handling Scott's
netbound header and Allan converted the spot-kick.
But the drama continued in 82 minutes, when East Fife also were
reduced to 10 men, with a second bookable offence resulting in Mark
Donaghy leaving the field.
It was a cracking finale to a hard-fought tie.
EAST FIFE -- Robertson, Bell, Hamill, Sneddon, Cusick, Donaghy, Allan,
Hildersley, Scott, Hunter, Hope. Substitutes -- Hucheon, Gibb, Wilson.
ROSS COUNTY -- Hutchison, Sommerville, Reid, Williamson, Bellshaw,
Furphy, Ferries, Grant, Herd, Connelly, McLeod. Substitutes -- McKay,
McPherson, McMillan.
Referee -- E Martindale (Glasgow).

The United States last night lifted short term interest rates by 0.5%
after a two days of deliberations by the Federal Open Market Committee.
It now adds pressure for a rise in UK rates, already considered likely
by many economists, as Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke meets
today with Governor of the Bank of England Eddie George for their
regular monthly monetary get-togethers.
Share markets had earlier received a boost on hopes that President
Clinton's $50bn rescue package for Mexico will be effective and it did
halt the slump in the peso which in turn reduced pressure on the dollar.
The FTSE 100 Share Index closed up 25.7 at 3017.3 having touched 3024.0
at one stage.
The increase in the US Federal discount rate to 5.25% and the federal
funds rate to 6%, both up a [1/2]-point, is the seventh rate rise in the
last year.
With the economy already running at or above capacity, US financial
markets had felt that the Federal Reserve Board had little choice but to
raise rates further to try to offset a rise in inflation though there is
some concern on Wall Street that pre-emptive rate rises may damage the
recovery.
There are also some worries on this score in the UK. The Bank of
England Governor suggested on Tuesday that the fast rate of growth of
the UK economy may have slowed although the general tenor of his
comments casued some confusion in financial markets where an increase of
0.5% in base rates to 6.75% has long been discounted.
Mr George's main aim seemed to be to dampen the market's perception of
future interest rate levels, which he considered too high, and
economists believe that a rate rise will come this week or, if not, next
month when further economic data can be examined.
The Governor, though, on past form is likely to want action sooner
rather than later.
The Chancellor's conundrum is that the signals are rather mixed. This
showed up starkly in yesterday's UK purchasing managers' survey for
January from the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply. This
showed that the rate of growth of the manufacturing sector slowed for
the sixth month in a row, with the rate of growth in output dropping
sharply and order books deteriorating.
But at the same time upward price pressures remain very much in
evidence. The survey includes the first leading indicator of inflation,
designed to trace turning points in inflation. The indicator suggests
the rate of retail prices inflation will rise over the next two years,
although not significantly.
The purchasing managers index fell to a seasonally adjusted 53.7% from
56.4% in December, although any reading above 50% still means activity
has grown compared to the previous month. Strong price pressures showed
up with just under 64% of purchasing managers reporting higher prices
against only 3% enjoying lower prices.
The Prices Index, at 75.8% (71.6% in December) rose to its highest
level since the survey began in June 1991.
Manufacturers were also continuing to find it difficult to obtain
supplies because of capacity constraints.
'Steady Eddie and Canny Ken', as the Chancellor once memorably
described the twosome, will be weighing up the evidence when the meet
today though the probability is that the Governor, at any rate, will
have decided a rise is necessary to counter price and thus inflation
pressures.
The Chancellor may be more reluctant given the vulnerabilty of certain
sectors of the economy, not least housing, and the apparent absence
still of any feel good factor or confidence in consumers.
The vulnerability of the housing market was highlighted by the January
house prices index, seasonally adjusted for the first time, from the
Nationwide Building Society, Britain's second biggest. This showed a
decline of 0.8% in January from December and a fall of 0.5% on Jnauary
1994 levels. At the start of last year both the Halifax and the
Nationwide were forecasting increases over the year.
The figures continue to reflect a flat housing market which we have
seen since the spring of 1994, says Nationwide's divisional director
Philip Williamson. He added, ''in spite of strong economic growth
confidence remains fragile. Falling unemployment has not eliminated
continuing concerns over job security while negative equity remains a
factor constraining market activity, particularly in the south of
England.''
Even so, the Nationwide is bravely forecasting a limited upturn in
1995.
On Monday, MO, the narrow definition of money supply comprising mostly
of notes and coins in circulation, showed an unexpected decline in
growth for January which could be said to ease pressures for an
immediate interest rate increase. But the December Retail Price Index
was above expectations, and there was also higher than expected GDP
growth in the fourth quarter of 1994.
Added to which the recent Quarterly Industrial Trends Survey from the
Confederation of British Industry saw a sharp jump in the percentage of
firms expecting to raise prices between now and April -- although this
may be constrained by consumer resistance -- and continuing fast
economic growth. The CBI itself has argued that a rate rise is
unneccessary at this time.
The various, sometimes contradictory, strands of the economy will be
studied carefully by the Chancellor and the Governor of the Bank of
England today. But the financial markets and majority of City economists
are certainly looking for a rate rise. And the US move makes it even
more likely.

MANAGER Joe Royle launched a blistering attack on referee David
Elleray after Everton had two men sent off and five others booked in the
2-0 league defeat at Newcastle.
''Earl Barrett has never been sent off in his life but got booked for
kicking the ball away when it was never a corner, and Barry Horne's
first booking was never a foul,'' complained Royle.
Blackburn took a five-point Premiership lead -- despite having
goalkeeper Tim Flowers sent off for a professional foul after just 90
seconds.
Just four minutes later Alan Shearer shot Blackburn ahead from the
spot with goal No.27 of the season and Leeds needed Gary McAllister's
late penalty to earn a 1-1 draw.
The biggest cheer of the night at Highbury came when Arsenal's Paul
Merson, out for four months following his confessions of drug abuse and
alcoholism, appeared as a substitute against AC Milan 15 minutes from
time. The European Super Cup match finished goalless and the second leg
is in Italy next Wednesday.
* WIMBLEDON manager Joe Kinnear and captain Vinnie Jones have been
charged by the FA with bringing the game into disrepute and
ungentlemanly behaviour at their recent 2-1 defeat at Newcastle, and
Liverpool striker Robbie Fowler faces similar charges for an incident,
also involving police intervention, during the 2-1 Boxing Day win at
Leicester.
* PORTSMOUTH last night sacked manager Jim Smith, a week after the
club was put up for sale at #7m. Smith, 54, had been in charge since May
1991 and led Pompey to a place in the FA Cup semi-finals in 1992, but
they now are in the first division relegation zone, are out of the cups,
and have no money for new players.

SATURDAY marks the passing of another milestone in the long and
winding rugby road travelled by the Scotland captain, Gavin Hastings,
since he made his debut with a record-breaking six penalty goals against
the French in 1986.
Against the Irish at Murrayfield, Hastings wins his fifty-third cap
and in the process becomes his country's most honoured rugby son,
overtaking the existing record held jointly by the Hawick pair, Jim
Renwick and Colin Deans.
But for Hastings the occasion will tinged by a personal sadness that
younger brother Scott will not be there to share the plaudits.
The Hastings boys have played together 44 times in Scottish colours
but, like Mary Queen of Scots, the younger Hastings has felt the
dolorous stroke of the selectors' axe. Mary's appointment with the
axeman came after a contretemps with England's Good Queen Bess, Scott
found himself on the block after defeat by South Africa before the turn
of the year.
Hastings Jr has kept his thoughts to himself since his ommission from
the full Scotland side, commenting only: ''I'll do my talking on the
pitch.''
He gets the chance to whisper sweet somethings in selectorial ears
with an outing in the A side that plays Ireland A in Edinburgh tomorrow.
Yesterday the Scotland skipper mused on the fact that his younger
brother will not be keeping him company on the Murrayfield pitch on
Saturday.
''Obviously, I'm disappointed for Scott, and he knows that. We've been
through a heck of a lot together. We've had two Lions' tours and two
World Cups and all the caps, but once the team is picked then my
responsibility is to the team. There is no let-off for me in that
respect.
''I will encourage and help every single person. I can assure you that
there's no family prejudice, if you like, against any players that
happen to be in the team,'' said Hastings. ''I've been around long
enough, and Scott has been around long enough, to realise that he has
got to fight his way back into the team. It is up to him to do that.''
Both brothers have, indeed, been around long enough to treat those
twin impostors -- victory and defeat -- with a worldy-wise disdain. They
made their Scottish debuts together and were both key figures in the
Lions' campaigns to Australia in 1989 and New Zealand in 1993. The
Wallabies were defeated in the Tests and, but for a questionable
refereeing decision, Hastings Sr would have led the tourists to series
success in New Zealand as well.
The New Zealand expedition marked another low point in Scott's career,
when he was invalided home with facial injuries so serious that they
required four separate operations to put right.
Gavin's appointment as Scotland captain in 1992 turned out to be
something of a poisoned chalice. The team had lost its 1990 Grand Slam
stars and was in a period of transition. His form suffered, too, as he
led Scotland -- Argentina excluded -- to the unenviable record of nine
games without a victory.
That devilish statistic was exorcised last time out against Canada and
on Saturday Scotland begin their Five Nations' Championship campaign
with Hastings's record haul of caps not quite uppermost in his mind.
He said: ''Of course, I'm aware of the record, but I don't look
forward to the game because of that. There is a more important job to be
done and that is, firstly, ensuring a Scottish victory and, secondly, me
playing my part in that.
''The enjoyment of winning the fifty-third cap will come after the
game, providing we win. But I look back to last year's match against
France, when Scott and I both won our fiftieth caps. It wasn't as
enjoyable or memorable as it might have been and that was obviously down
to the result.
''So, yes, in 10 years' time it's going to be great to remember
winning my fifty-third cap and Scott and I winning our fiftieth caps
together, but right now the most important thing is making sure that
Scotland get the win. So far as I'm concerned that's more important than
anything,'' he declared.
The 60,000 dollar question, though, is whether Hastings thinks that
Scott will win back his Scotland berth.
''I'm not a selector. Scott has got to go back and play some good
rugby, and unless he does that, then he won't expect to get back in the
side. He knows that. So the ball is in his court and he knows what he
has to do to make the selectors made a decision in his favour,'' said
the Scotland skipper with a side-step that would find favour within the
diplomatic corps.

GREAT Britain's women's hockey team were understandably dejected after
the 3-1 defeat on Tuesday by the USA which cost them the three-match
Test series, writes Joseph Dillon.
And the way forward for Britain doesn't look particularly bright as it
sets its sights on an Olympic qualifying tournament in Cape Town in
November.
An acute shortage of players of the calibre which helped Britain bring
home bronze medals from Barcelona means the amount of work required to
secure one of the places in Atlanta is now much greater than previously
envisaged.

TWO shinty players will be taking more than a passing interest in the
weather this weekend, writes Hugh Dan MacLennan.
Hail and snow look like wrecking the card for the second week in a
row, and that would be a blessing for both Lovat's Roddy Munro and Oban
Camanachd's Gordon MacIntyre.
Munro is suspended for one game and will miss Lovat's next match,
whenever it is played. Their first fixture is due to be the rearranged
North Qualifying Cup final against Caberfeidh at Inverness, in which he
would want to play.
MacIntyre, Oban Camanachd's international defender, weds Sharon Ramage
on Saturday.
The home game against Oban Celtic has an 11.30 start to enable players
from both camps to attend the wedding.
But with striker Dave McCuish suspended and Camanachd's position as
league leaders at stake, MacIntyre may be required to play.
McIntyre, who commutes from Londonderry, said: ''If I go along as
substitute and if the boys are getting beaten, I would have to go on
anyway, so I may as well just do so from the start.''
The weather could, of course, decide the issue.

MICHELE Mair can expect her world tennis ranking to improve for the
first time in more than a year following her success in last week's
$10,000 US Satellite tournament at the Woodlands, Texas, writes Judy
Murray.
Victory in the doubles event with South African partner Karen van der
Merve and a place in the last four of the singles signalled the end of
an unproductive 12 months on the pro-circuit for the Scottish No.1, who
had slipped almost 100 places on the WTA computer to a current No.603.
But the ranking points earned from wins over Emily Bond, Katarina
Misic, and Shiri Burstein should lift the Edinburgh player to around
No.560 when the lists are updated this week. That should enhance her
chances of acceptance into the main draw for the UK Satellite circuit
which opens in Sheffield on Monday.

Glasgow Under-19 12, South Under-19 0
GLASGOW, beaten by Edinburgh and the South in the November series,
avenged one of those defeats when they beat the Borderers in the
under-19 district championship match at Bridgehaugh last night.
Victory, however, was marred by the late dismissal flanker Graham
Inglis.
A try by Alan Sievewright after two minutes was an early indication of
Glasgow's intentions. The Stirling stand-off also converted, but almost
constant Glasgow pressure produced nothing further until midfield
commitment by Ian Sinclair and Nick Barrett created the scope for Geoff
Caldwell to gallop through on the right.
Glasgow took no fewer than five strikes against the head in the first
half, but Gavin Kerr's introduction to the front row at the interval
tightened up the South's scrummage.
The flow was still mainly Glasgow's way though the home team could add
no more against very secure Border defence.
Glasgow -- R Williams (Stewartry); G Caldwell (Ayr), S Jenkins
(Kilmarnock), N Barrett (GHK), C MacDonald (Ayr); A Sievewright
(Stirling County), R White (Stewartry); M Smith (Glasgow Academicals), C
Docherty (GHK), R Harvey (Cartha Queen's Park), D Hough (Ardrossan
Academicals), G Macfarlane (West of Scotland), G Inglis
(Hutchesons/Aloysians), E Macdonald (Newton Stewart), I Sinclair (GHK),
captain.
South -- S Tomlinson (Selkirk); B Charlton (Berwick), K Utterson
(Kelso), R Steel (Berwick), C Farmer (Peebles); G Dalgleish (Gala), G
Cowe (Kelso), captain; I Cornwall, W Browne (both Melrose), O
Weatherhead, G Younger (both Berwick), A Hotson (Langholm), G Whelen

Kerr (Berwick) for Weatherhead (half-time), M Landells (Hawick) for
Browne (54min.), S Graham (Langholm) for Walker (57).

JIM Mailer plans a rebirth in his badminton career this weekend at the
Hydro-Electric Scottish national championships in Edinburgh, just months
after considering retiring from the sport.
The former Scottish champion is quietly confident of regaining the
men's singles title, despite tough opposition from defending champion
and No.1 seed Bruce Flockhart, who has defeated him on both occasions
they have met this season.
''I feel I have a chance to create an upset at the nationals,'' said
Mailer. ''It would mean a lot to me if I could win the title again.''
The Stirling player, however, also admits that last year was a total
disaster. ''I had my heart set on getting to the Commonwealth Games, but
blew it,'' he said. ''I was so disappointed that I seriously considered
ending my career last summer.''
Meanwhile, Flockhart has returned from Denmark with confidence high
after putting two fine performances under his belt in the Horsens and
Gentoste events, where he was put out by the eventual winner on both
occasions.
The Stirling University sports scholarship student reached the last 16
in the first competition and the quarter-finals of the second event.
Gillian Martin, who was denied a top-two seeded place at the
championships, has welcomed her placing in the bottom half of the draw
where she will probably meet No.2 seed Aileen Travers, allowing the
Barnt Green player to avoid playing No.1 seed Anne Gibson in the early
rounds.
''I think this is the sensible draw,'' said Martin, who has notched up
an impressive string of victories over the season, including a win over
Britain's current No.1 player Julia Mann, and was critical of the
decision not to include her as one of the two favourites.

RED tape forced marksman Doug Smail to sit out last weekend's ice
hockey defeat double for Fife Flyers despite rave reports about his
condition and his enthusiasm.
But the veteran National Hockey League player is set to return to top
flight British ice hockey this weekend.
Smail was forced to side-step the first part of this season because of
business commitments -- he is the managing director of a sports clothing
company.
He answered Fife's appeal for help after their dressing room looked
more like Emergency Ward 10.
Record-breaker Smail, last year's player of the year in Britain, and
the man who holds the honour of scoring the fastest ever goal in the
National Hockey League -- after just five seconds -- returns against
Cardiff Devils, the league champions, and the side he played for on a
short-term contract in the European Cup earlier this season.
Smail said: ''It's great to be back. I watched last weekend's games
and the Kirkcaldy kids have done really well for the club getting them
over a difficult spell. The experience they gained can only benefit them
in the long term.''
He added: ''I'm here to help Fife make the British Championship
semi-finals at Wembley.''
Import defence man Ryan Kummu may also return to action wearing a visa
to protect his damaged jaw shattered by a flying puck in a Christmas Eve
training accident, and leading Canadian goal grabber Mark Morrison is
set to lace on his skates after a long lay-off with back trouble.
Stewart Saunders, Flyers team manager, said: ''It's been a difficult
time for us and we're grateful to all the players for seeing us through
the crisis.''

VERY few English footballers, especially those who have helped inflict
humiliating defeats on Scotland, are treated with respect approaching
reverence on this side of the Border. Bobby Charlton was one and Tom
Finney was another. In more recent times, there has been a tolerance of
such as Gary Lineker and Bryan Robson.
Then, of course, there was Stanley Matthews. Now Sir Stanley, the
former England, Stoke and Blackpool wizard of the wing last night
celebrated his eightieth birthday, and football people from all over the
globe, including Scotland, gave a sigh of nostalgia and said a prayer of
thanks that the great man is still among us.
Probably his finest hour was when he turned a 3-1 deficit into a 4-3
triumph for Blackpool over Bolton in the 1953 FA Cup final, but there
are those of us who remember only too well the events at Wembley in 1955
when Matthews and a brilliant English side walloped Scotland 7-2. It
just wasn't fair. They had men such as the late Duncan Edwards, Billy
Wright, Don Revie, Nat Lofthouse, Dennis Wilshaw -- and, of course,
Matthews.
However, despite taking a roasting and chasing the shadow of Matthews
for most of the afternoon, Harry Haddock, the Clyde left back who was
given the task of marking the winger that day, retains a deep respect
for the man.
Harry, who still lives a free-kick distance away from the Shawfield
Stadium where Clyde used to play, told me yesterday: ''The Old Man is a
true champion -- he was a wonderful player and is a wonderful person.
When God made him, he threw the mould away. You could talk about Stan
all day and at the end of it all you would just sum him up as a great
guy.
''As a player he would never ever try to give an opponent a showing
up. He never tried to kick anybody either. His idea of playing football
was to control the ball, take it as quickly as possible, past an
opponent, and if there was someone else there he would do the same.
After that he got in his cross without any fuss.
''He was also so modest. I remember him coming up to me after the 7-2
match and when I congratulated him he wouldn't take any credit. He just
said: 'Harry, the ball just ran for us today. You were unlucky.' He
didn't have to tell anyone how good he was -- everyone could see for
themselves he was a genius.
''He also gave me two of my best personal memories. First when he
appeared at a dinner given for me on my retirement from the Post Office
four years ago and shortly after that when he presented me with an award
from the Scottish Professional Footballers Association. To think he
would travel all the way from Stoke just for me.''
Tommy Docherty was another Scot who took part in the 7-2 drubbing at
Wembley, scoring one of the goals. ''Stan is a lovely man and was a
fabulous player,'' he said. ''Not as good as Tom Finney, mind you, but
few were.
''Our organisation that day was a shambles. We didn't have a manager
and all the tactics were left to the captain big George Young. I think
one of the selection committee told Harry how to mark Stan. I believe he
is still looking for him. My goal? That was scored out of sheer anger
rather than accuracy.''
On a personal note, I have cause to raise a glass and toast the great
man. I remember meeting him in the grounds of Edinburgh Castle in the
early eighties where he was strolling with his old Blackpool team-mate
and pal Jackie Mudie. It was out of the blue and I asked if I could
interview him over lunch. ''Don't call me Sir Stanley,'' he said. ''It's
Stan, and we'd be delighted to have lunch with you.''
Instead of opting for one of the more expensive restaurants in the
city, he asked to be taken to the old tea shop where he had eaten while
he was guesting for Hibernian during the war.
He was in Scotland to play in a Scottish international jersey during a
charity match at Grangemouth in aid of UNICEF. Wee Willie Henderson was
to come on as a substitute for the Englishman and the Scot told me at
the time: ''He is the only winger in the world for whom I would agree to
substitute.''
A few years later, I happened to run into Sir Stanley at a function in
Toronto. I hadn't seen him since that day in Edinburgh, but he came
across to me and held out his hand. ''Hello, Jim. Nice to see you
again,'' he said. That is class.

Madeira
BRIAN Barnes, who is 49, and Andrew Coltart, 25 years his junior,
return to the Madeira Island Open, which begins today at the Madeira
Club, with very different objectives to pursue -- the former a new
career as his golfing seniority approaches, the latter the consolidation
of one which is starting to take definite shape.
Barnes, the veteran of 17 regular tournament victories worldwide and
six Ryder Cup appearances, turns 50 on June 3 and, as a preliminary to
dipping a toe in the richly-stocked but fiercely competitive waters of
the US Senior Tour, he will have two weeks' practice in Florida.
That choice of state is no accident, for the headquarters of Jack
Nicklaus's Golden Bear Organisation is in North Palm Beach and Barnes
has recently joined it. That represents an aptly ironic twist of fate
since Barnes once memorably beat Nicklaus twice in a day in Ryder Cup
singles.
As Barnes said yesterday of the new association (other clients include
Tony Jacklin and Hale Irwin): ''If Nicklaus can't get me some sponsors'
invitations, no-one can.'' It is all, of course, in preparation for the
difficult task of qualifying for the American Tour at the school in
November.
Barnes, incidentally, hopes the sponsors will agree to allow his
father-in-law, Max Faulkner, who is now 78, to lead off the field with a
ceremonial drive at the Senior British Open in July at Royal Portrush,
where in 1951 Faulkner became the third of only six Britons since the
war to win the Open championship.
Indeed, Barnes has the further idea that Faulkner could be accompanied
by two of his old sparring partners from former days, Ken Bousfield,
aged 74, with whom he and his son-in-law regularly play, and, to bring
an appropriately Irish touch to the proceedings, Christy O'Connor Sr,
recently turned 70.
Coltart is still glowing over his joint fourth placing with Greg
Norman and Michael Campbell in the Johnnie Walker Classic in Manila --
although, after the long-haul flight home, only just beginning to feel a
sense of where he is and what day of the week it is.
It was 12 months ago that Coltart began here what was to turn out to
be the season which transformed his fortunes. Admittedly, to finish
equal thirty-seventh was not exactly a hint at his victories in the
Scottish and Australian PGA championships or his rise from 171st to
forty-second on the order of merit.
However, Coltart remains a realist. ''After all,'' he noted, ''two
years ago this same tournament started that horrible season. I've got to
keep going, because you're not really in the scene unless you're
consistent over three or four years. So many players do well, only to
disappear.''
Coltart was very impressed with the attitude of Nick Price, the Open
and US PGA champion, who was his partner in the final round in the
Philippines. Coltart said: ''I was amazed when he introduced himself to
me on the practice ground before we started and later flattered that he
should think so well of my game.''
Comparatively modest as the prize-money is this week -- #250,000 in
total and #41,660 for first place -- and although only two current Ryder
Cup players, Mark James, the winner two years ago, and Peter Baker, are
in the field of 120 -- Coltart is aware that there are more players than
ever before capable of winning now.
Mats Lanner made that point last year with his second victory in 13
seasons and the first for seven and since none of the leading 20 in the
Ryder Cup points table and only four of the first 20 in the current
order of merit are playing, the opportunity clearly exists for success
from an unexpected source.
Coltart, Gordon Brand Jr, who will be one of his partners for the
first two rounds, and Paul Lawrie all missed the cut in Dubai. They are
joined by five other Scots -- Barnes, Brian Marchbank, William Guy, and
Dean Robertson and Craig Ronald, both of whom will be treading these
boards for the first time.
So unknown is Robertson that the caddie he sat next to on the flight
out asked him who he would be working for. ''Myself,'' Robertson
replied, although he will have a bag carrier for what he hopes will be
the start of a first season as promising as Coltart's second was
fulfilled.
* COMEDIAN Bill Murray, of Ghostbusters and Groundhog Day fame,
yesterday finally agreed to play in this week's AT and T National Pro-Am
in California.
Murray said he would never play in the event again after having been
criticised by Tom Watson and former commissioner Deane Beman for his
antics last year. However, Beman has resigned and Murray was invited
again.
He will partner former US Open champion Scott Simpson as he did last
year. Others in the celebrity field include George Bush, Dan Quayle,
Sean Connery, and Clint Eastwood.

THE newspapers scream the headlines -- Flesh-eating bug claims another
victim -- but the reality behind the sensationalism is that the disease,
necrotising fasciitis, is still rare and there is no evidence that it
has increased in the past three years.
Necrotising fasciitis, or streptococcal gangrene, is an uncommon,
quickly progressive, potentially fatal infection caused mainly by group
A streptococci bacteria.
These streptococci, which can cause tonsilitis, scarlet fever and
erysipelas (once a common skin disease), are also found living
harmlessly in our noses and throats and on our skin, throughout our
lives. They are tiny, round organisms that live joined together in
chains.
The group A streptococci usually involved are protected from human
white cells, which would destroy them, by a hairy outer coat containing
M protein. Once they invade our tissues these cocci can produce
substances that destroy blood cells and break down tissue fibres, and so
spread rapidly from the blood stream to reach and infect every part of
the body.
In necrotising fasciitis these streptococci may also be assisted by
anaerobic bacteria and possibly staphylococcus aureus.
STAPHYLOCOCCUS aureus was first identified by Alexander Ogston, a
Scots surgeon and Professor of Greek at Aberdeen University, who gave it
its Latin name because the bacteria is round and forms clumps like
bunches of grapes.
Why the group A streptococcus suddenly becomes invasive no-one is very
sure -- perhaps because, when people are frail or exhausted after an
operation, the bacteria can overcome their natural healing processes.
The main treatment of necrotising fasciitis is to remove the whole
infected area surgically. Antibiotics are always administered. Treatment
is most often successful where the patient is young, has a sound
constitution, and when the infection is spotted early.
Necrotising fasciitis often follows mild injury. The skin becomes
dusky and blisters and the whole area becomes ulcerated and necrotic.
Streptococcal toxins may work so fast that their passage into the blood
stream is only a matter of hours. By the time the sufferer has reached
hospital, however, the disease may be so advanced that the patient has
no resistance left.
But like a lightning strike this disease is a random killer which
claims very few victims each year.

Charity
stampede
REMEMBER our appeal asking for your surplus Christmas stamps for our
Herald Foundation for Women's Health?
Well, we are delighted to announce that we have just received a cheque
for nearly #2000 from the Royal Mail.
This is the first time the Royal Mail has participated in such a
campaign and it is pleased with the response.
Keith Allan, competition post manager, says he received 1690 replies
with an average of #1.33 a card. ''The whole exercise raised a clear
#1827.50 profit,'' says Allan.
So, a special thank-you to our readers for taking the trouble to fill
in the card with their spare stamps, especially over the busy festive
season.
Acid test
THIS week sees the launch of the Folic Acid Helpline -- 081 994 9874
-- to encourage all women planning a pregnancy to take a 400 microgramme
folic acid supplement daily before conception and until the 12th week of
pregnancy.
This simple precaution lowers the risk of neural tube defects, notably
spina bifida. The helpline is staffed by specially trained nurses and
will allow women to call in complete confidence.
Available from Monday to Friday, 2pm to 10pm, until April then from
5pm to 10pm May to December.
Cancer cash
EVERY day in Scotland seven women die of breast cancer yet money for
research comes mainly from charities.
A demand for more Government money for research is the thrust of a
Scottish petition with 150,000 names to be handed in to No 10 Downing
Street next Tuesday by the Scottish Breast Cancer Campaign.
Organised by Audrey Jones, herself a breast-cancer sufferer, she
points out that most breast cancer research funding comes from
charitable donations.
''In America a similar campaign to ours succeeded in diverting $2100m
away from the defence budget to breast cancer research. This is the
result we want,'' she says.
In emergency
HOW to obtain emergency contraception is one of the subjects dealt
with in the new Women's Health Helpline in Fife.
It will provide information on Well Women clinics, family planning and
a range of other services dealing with women's health. Based in Dalgety
Bay clinic, it will be staffed during office hours, and out of hours
there will be a recorded message system. Organised by Fife Healthcare,
it's part of the new, improved NHS Trust service. Telephone 0383
8221099.
Odd bite
DOG and rat bites are common enough, flea and tick bites are always
with us, and in Edinburgh squirrels (the grey ones) are biting the hands
that are trying to feed them, says the Royal Hospital for Sick Children.
But the oddest bite reported comes from Inverclyde Royal Hospital, in
Greenock: a fisherman was attacked by a prawn.
Key to keyhole
AS a result of complications arising from keyhole surgery, the Royal
College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has decided on compulsory
training in the technique for gynaecologists. It also suggests that they
should take part in a national audit programme. To ensure maximum safety
for the patients, the RCOG tells hospitals it is up to them to provide
adequate and safe equipment and support staff.

Ann Shaw, in search of the secret of Gloria Hunniford's glow, uncovers
a few surprises
BROADCASTER Gloria Hunniford may well attribute her bouncy good health
to vitamin supplements -- for the 54-year-old television presenter and
radio star gulps down 30-40 tablets a day.
''I rush around too much. I don't have time to eat properly; nor do I
fancy carrying food around with me all day. The alternative is to take
vitamin supplements,'' she says.
''I take them first thing in the morning. Yes, I know I should eat a
healthy diet, but with my lifestyle I just don't have the time to eat
properly except at weekends.''
Gloria Hunniford is a very busy woman -- she does five radio shows and
two television programmes a week and, while most middle-aged women are
slowing down, she is speeding up.
A year ago her homeopathic doctor, Troon-based Jan de Vries -- who
also has a clinic in London -- suggested to her that she take the herbal
drug gingko, derived from the apricot-like Japanese maidenhair tree.
She says as a result she has never felt better and her energy levels
have shot up, though she declares: ''I've always been a naturally
energetic person.
''Gingko is very popular in the States. Over there it's hailed as a
new drug, though it's hardly known in this country among the general
public.''
She doesn't know whether her immense energy levels and good health are
due specifically to the ginkgo plant or the combination of all the other
pills she takes.
''All I know is that I feel great. No, I'm not on HRT (hormone
replacement therapy). There's no need yet. It's something I'm keeping in
reserve. Maybe one day. My children say if I go on that, along with my
pills, my energy level will rocket. They will have to chain me to a
chair!''
But aren't all these pills and potions a bit expensive?
''Yes, but I believe that every penny spent on your health is worth
it. After all, it could just as easily go on smoking and drinking.''
Her daily supplements include high-dosage vitamin C, pure Vitamin E,
CH3 (a pill recommended by Barbara Cartland for brain power and energy)
and calcium.
''Everything I take is available from health shops. I feel it helps.
But I've always been blessed with natural energy and had good staying
power.''
''Of course, it may be psychological. All I know is that if I don't
take my pills I feel less good. My memory has definitely improved.''
What about exercise? ''No, I don't exercise,'' she claims, but quickly
adds: ''But I am starting next week to go back to my health club twice a
week.''
Then would she say that gingko is source of her energy? ''Who knows?''
says Gloria. ''I can't isolate it because of all the other pills I'm
taking.''

GERMAN doctors prescribe the herbal remedy gingko for memory loss. It
is hailed as a miracle drug and while you cannot get it on prescription
in this country it is available from health shops and herbalists.
Claims border on the extravagant. It is said to help everything from
short-term and long-term memory loss, concentration, blood circulation,
and Alzheimer's disease, to depression and Raynaud's disease (poor
circulation in fingers and toes). ME sufferers too, are beginning to use
the drug with some success.
So, what's the truth? Medical herbalist Dee Atkinson, of Napiers,
Britain's oldest herbal house, in Edinburgh, is bemused at the sudden
attention gingko is getting.
''It's been available for a long time,'' says Atkinson. ''The plant
comes from the biloba tree, indigenous to China and Japan. It has always
had a reputation for improving mental performance and blood flow to the
brain.''
Atkinson offers a word of caution: ''All herbs are drugs. While there
is no known side-effect from gingko you should not just rush out and buy
a bottle. Yes, it is a useful herb, but like all drugs it should be
treated with respect. We would advise anyone coming to us to see a
herbalist for a free consultation first.''
It is in its purest form as a liquid which is available from
herbalists. Health shops stock it either in tablet or capsule form.
Expect to pay around #5 upwards for a month's supply.
If you would like to see a biloba tree then visit Edinburgh's
Botanical Gardens where there are a couple of specimens, the only ones
in Scotland.

Lest M Tahir Ahmad is left unanswered by any other ''priest, minister,
mullah, guru, or even the 'defender of the faith' '' regarding the
statement by a guide on Iona that Jesus was homosexual, may I humbly
draw attention to my letter of December 24 last year.
In condemning an artist's portrayal of Christ as Aids-ridden, and in
pleading for the church's long-tried moral standards, I was, like Mr
Ahmad, censuring by implication any attempt to label Jesus homosexual.
There is no good biblical evidence for the homosexuality of Christ,
though now and then one finds articles in ''scholarly'' books which
impute this to him because his immediate disciples were all male;
perhaps special pleading on the part of the writers.
The verb agapan even in Ephesians 5:25 compares marriage to Christ's
relation to the church which John 17 in turn compares to God's love for
Christ. The verb philein in John 21 need not imply sex though it can
sometimes mean ''kiss'' -- context is everything. The verb eran, which
does mean sexual love, is not in the New Testament.
Also there is biblical and apocryphal evidence for Jesus's being at
ease with women as much as with men, though he seems not to have
married.
In both testaments the Bible condemns homosexuality; but even
independently of the Bible, a simple study of cause and effect should be
enough to make us prefer its view to that of some writers, or to the
implications some draw from Plato on the subject.
One must not pander to one's lower instincts. Some church people have
recently been in danger of doing so.

S Hussain, commenting on the reported remarks of an Iona Community
guide, seems to think that the law of blasphemy should apply to Scotland
(January 26).
My understanding of this law is that it was framed to provide
protection for the Church of England and consequently cannot have any
force in Scotland. Some Muslims went to court in an attempt to widen the
application of the law in England to include other faiths and they were
supported by many humanists, including Salman Rushdie.
The humanist position on this law is quite clear. We feel that the law
should be repealed.
In a society which claims to be multi-racial and multi-cultural, the
law should not discriminate between different religions, which explains
the humanist support for the Muslim court action, but the logical step
would be complete removal of this anachronistic piece of legislation.
If Prince Charles is to achieve his declared aim and become ''defender
of the faith'' it can only be as a defender of diversity of belief, and
that will inevitably mean that sometimes people's religious
susceptibilities will be offended.
The present correspondence related to verbal remarks addressed to a
small group of people and the obvious course for any complainant was to
take the matter up with the guide's employers and to attempt to minimise
publicity relating to the alleged offence. The criminal courts should
not become involved in this kind of thing.

January 27.
The appalling behaviour of Eric Cantona last Wednesday night has
absolutely no justification. The excuses of several ex-players, notably
Pat Crerand on television news, that the player was severely provoked,
does not relinquish the player from responsibility for his actions.
Cantona is undoubtedly an extremely talented player and is paid rather
handsomely for the display of this talent; verbal abuse, which also
cannot be condoned, is part and parcel of the game of football today.
Players must show their professionalism by rising above the petty
rantings of opposition supporters. The manner in which Cantona reacted
on Wednesday night is nothing short of common thuggery, the type of
thing football associations have been trying to eradicate from the

Would those who forgive Cantona for his indiscretion be so forgiving
if it had been the fan who had jumped over the barrier and assaulted the
player. Without any doubt the fan would have been charged with assault
and banned by the club for life. This is exactly the punishment that
befits the actions of Cantona.
No player is above the law and I only hope that the Football
Association ensures that Cantona is not allowed to play again, and that
the police take appropriate action against him.

There appears to be some confusion as to why public services are
privatised.
The reason why valuable assets, funded by and belonging to the
taxpayer, are sold at discounts to the private sector is because some
politicians believe that privatisation allows the replacement of
existing managers by those who are committed to maximising profit while
providing simply a tolerable service to the public.
The political gamble in all this is that the public will meekly accept
government assurances of concern on massive price increases and
fundamental changes to the service.
In essence, the ploy requires enough mugs among consumers.

The Cantona disgrace should be considered as two separate incidents.
The justifiable ordering-off offence, and the bizarre high-kicking
outburst.
The study of the immediate pre-incident TV freeze frame wil reveal the
foul-mouthed instigator surrounded by a crowd of sniggering supporters
(young males and females) fronted by a hapless steward disinclined to
defuse the obscene tirade.
Regrettably, this mindless tribalism is commonplace at many football
grounds. In this instance it effectively finished the career of a
brilliant, if undisciplined, player. Cantona is off for good . . . pity
the morons will be back baying for more.

Recent comment in your columns has rightly emphasised the lack of job
opportunities for newly qualified and ''returning'' teachers. The
General Teaching Council is the Secretary of State's principal adviser
on intake levels for college of education courses.
My association has long argued that too many students are being
admitted to courses for the number of jobs realistically available.
Tragically our pleas have fallen on deaf ears, despite mounting evidence
of increasing numbers of un- and underemployed teachers.
The situation represents a waste of resources -- human and financial.
Teachers are being trained for the dole, or the vagaries of supply work.
Indeed, an increasing number of those who do obtain teaching posts are
being appointed on part-time or temporary contracts.
This can be severely demoralising. Supply work does little to
contribute to a teacher's development. In turn, such teachers are
generally able to contribute less than their full potential to our
pupils' educational development.
The present situation is a mess. It harms children's education, and
does nothing for teacher morale.

It gives me great pleasure to inform your readers that CNSA plans to
open one or more full-time Gaelic-medium community nurseries in the
London area before the end of the year.
Any reader with London-based family or friends whom they feel would be
interested in such a venture should tell them to get in touch with me on
081-343 3211.
This initiative is not as strange as it might seem, for in the London
area alone there reside more than 300,000 Scots. Moreover, one can also
find in and around London numerous long-established and well-supported
Scottish and Gaelic organisations.
Given this enormous potential we are more than confident in a vibrant
response to such a venture. Accordingly we anticipate the first
information meeting to be held some time during March and April and a
resulting nursery to open in the autumn.
Apropos the staffing of such units, we welcome everyone. However there
are two conditions that must be met by anyone considering offering their
services.
These are thatall staff must be fluent in Gaelic, and at least half of
the applicants must have had either primary school teacher or nursery
nurse experience.
Finally it is worth mentioning that although the staff must be fluent
Gaelic speakers, as far as the children and their parents are concerned
it matters not one iota whether they are the most accomplished Gaelic
speaker ever or a complete novice: there is a welcome for all.

Julie Davidson's sneer about the future of Taggart (''The commercial
imperative at Scottish is death-defying when there is a product to be
sold'') is more than usually offensive (January 28). Her bourgeois
imperative is gravity-defying -- the contortions required to convert
indifference into insult are truly acrobatic.
Having virtually ignored Taggart while Mark McManus was alive she
perversely chooses the occasion of a tribute to Mark to cheapen his
memory and attack his colleagues' work. Julie Davidson comments on our
motives while actually knowing nothing of them.
Perhaps her television reviewing should be reviewed. Julie Davidson's
prejudices have become so kneejerk, her coverage so patchy and
idiosyncratic, and her travel writing so much less bilious, might I
respectfully suggest a break from the box and more foreign travel.

I should like to add my congratulations to BT for its recent success.
Success in taking five weeks to get my fax working. Success in
supplying to date three mobile phones that have all failed to work as
per spec. Success in supplying a cordless telephone that picks up
interference from 300 yards away making it impossible to have a
conversation.
Success in wrongly charging me on a number of occasions. Success in
sending my bill to a subscriber in London. Success in cutting off my
mobile on two occasions after the bill was paid.
Success in jeopardising the very existence of my small company by
ensuring there are no decision-makers available to talk to me on these
matters. Success in passing over a ''bad'' debt to a debt recovery
agency -- a debt made up of a bill that was paid on time and one that
has not yet been issued.
And finally success in using my money to take out expensive adverts to
tell everyone how popular and successful it is.

THE harsh light of remorseless parliamentary scrutiny is about to
obfuscate the alleged comfort-zone fiddles of Britain's fourth estate .
. . the men and women on Irn-Bru incomes who quaff nothing less than
vintage Krug, those scarce able to afford a well-used Trabi who none the
less swish past life's bus queue of less inventive mortals borne in limo
luxury.
The hon member for Mid-Staffordshire, the aptly named Michael
Fabricant, has been putting it about that journalists, specifically BBC
journalists, abuse their swindle sheets by, well, fabricating claims: in
a word or 10, putting in for that to which they were not entitled,
chancing their arm to the point of amputation. American hacks call it
the Spritzer Protocol.
Mr Fabricant's mind is apparently taken up with the story of a foreign
correspondent who, he says, submitted a chit for a lawn-mower
notwithstanding that he lived in a fifth-floor flat. The MP's outrage is
further exercised by another correspondent's alleged largesse with his
and our Auntie's money, getting her to pick up the tab for
air-freighting grand pianos -- yes, in the plural -- from South Africa
to Europe. Mr Fabricant, a well-Whipped Tory, does not relate whether
the pianos were Euro-Bechsteins and Bluthners or good-old British
Broadwoods -- just that they were grand.
Well, as one who has just studied the art of filling in fire-proof
claims for those necessities required to keep journalistic body and soul
together, to sustain the inner man while in hot pursuit of the truth, I
can assure Mr Fabricant that grand, and in the plural, is what expenses
are all about . . . grand pianos and grand hotels, the grand breakfast
as well as the grand plan and the even grander gesture.
How could it be otherwise? Britain has to keep her end up abroad
against fierce competition. Would Mr Fabricant have the Times man in
Moscow serenade a secrets-laden Baltic Olga with a mere Jew's harp, the
Nine O'Clock News reporter pitch for street cred amid the Chechens with
a .177-calibre, smooth-bore Daisy air pistol?
What possible respect could this nation of couch potatoes have for the
owner of a face loved throughout the land if he or she billed the corps
merely for a carry-out pizza and a mug of tea from a greasy spoon? A
nation needs its heroes. It is well known among journalists that you
cannot possibly write with authority if you spend less on lunch than the
total monthly earnings of those who give your output house room.
There have been long attempts to get to the bottom of what journalists
traditionally regard as a bottomless pit -- their expenses. I remember
when one of the greatest organs of information and propaganda in kingdom
and Commonwealth -- I Beavered away for it for what seemed like many
years -- passed out of family control into the hands of a mega-corps . .
. and their accountants. Within days Star Reporter, a journalist whose
every exclusive crashed a currency or brought down a government,
received a terse note from the recently installed chief number cruncher.
It referred to an examination of Star Reporter's expenses claims for
the past decade that had revealed a weekly item: ''To entertaining for
information the Baron von Strizliputz -- say, #20.'' Continued the
missive: ''I have been unable to trace the baron in Who's Who, Burke's
Peerage, Debrett or, for that matter, the Almanach de Gotha. Please
explain.'' To which Star Reporter, a class act to the last -- and it was
his last class act -- replied: ''Thank you for drawing to my attention
your suspicions about Baron von Strizliputz. I was beginning to have
doubts about him myself.''
Mr Fabricant, I fear, is one of life's innocents, a naive dabbler in a
tough world. He has tabled questions for answers from the BBC but seems
not to understand that whenever whatever Government bloodhound goes on
to the DG's office for an explanation of foreign correspondents'
expenses, his demand for truth wil be passed on down the line to
departmental head, strand series executive, editor-in-chief, senior
producer, and director before, as is the way with such things, landing
on the foreign correspondent's own desk for explanation of his actings
and detail in support so that the DG, hand on heart, can report a
thorough investigation.
Not a newsroom in Britain, it is said, lacks a cupboard stuffed with
wellington boots bought by reporters in a panic when they learned that
the accounts department was planning a blitz following an apparent
epidemic purchase of foul-weather gear during a drizzle.
The story goes -- always -- that when the cupboard is finally opened
the boots are found to be neatly paired, held no more than an inch apart
by the strand of string from which they hung in the shop. Why did Mr
Fabricant not raise that one? Apocryphal tales have the advantage of
having well-loved punchlines.
Mr Fabricant should be told that some of the best tales that
journalists tell each other are about expense coups. Then, for a laugh,
they tell them to gullible MPs. Stories about grand pianos flown round
the world, lawn-mowers for a fifth-floor flat, sticks purchased and
cleft for runners to carry despatches from the front -- all are the
stuff of a second large vintage port after a Methuselah or three of la
vie en rose.
Mr Fabricant could be having his leg well and truly pulled -- just
like those of the camels that were purchased for Arabian travel leading
to a bill for their lengthy upkeep thereafter.

EDINBURGH Academy boy and British Telecom chairman Sir Iain Vallance
-- you'd be amazed by how many phone calls you can make on #663,000 a
year -- should probably take care not to fall under the doctor in the
near future.
Having outraged the entire medical profession by telling a Commons
committee that a junior quack's job would be ''quite relaxing'', the
tactful tycoon must be wondering if the communications industry is
really the place for him. What was that BT slogan again? Ah yes: ''It's
good to talk.''
Nothing daunted, Heriot-Watt University proposes to award the man
whose mouth is several sizes too big for his dial an honorary degree --
doctor of engineering, if you really care -- this July. The usual thing:
''Outstanding commercial leadership . . . distinguished contribution to
business and'' (it says here) ''the community''.
Not, we understand, community medicine.
Blockbusting Bard
THERE are rumours abroad that Canada is a dull place, like Belgium
only bigger. News reaches us from Winnipeg that should lay the calumny
to rest once and for all. The folk of Manitoba are not only cultured and
sophisticated, it seems, but their sense of humour is second to none.
Item: the Collected Works of Shakespeare has become a best-seller.
Item: $20 T-shirts bearing the immortal injunction ''To thine own self
be true'' are selling like hot cakes. Item: $36 tickets for a three-week
run of Hamlet at the Manitoba Theatre Centre are selling for upwards of
$750 on the black market.
Even the reviews of the play are good. Hamlet is, according to one
critic, full of ''splendid fury'' and ''animal grace''. Mind you,
another observer attributes the play's success to the fact that the lead
thespian is the owner of ''a great butt''.
As it turns out, the latter remark is more representative of the
play's audience, who seem to be mostly teenage and female, and who have
been arriving hotfoot from as far afield as Finland and Japan. We don't
say they lack a deep appreciation of the Bard, but it is, by all
accounts, outweighed by their appreciation of one Keanu Reeves in
tights. Frailty, as someone remarked, thy name is woman.
Mr Reeves, you will recall, rose to prominence after a deeply moving
performance in that epic tragi-comedy Bill and Ted's Excellent
Adventure. Hamlet may be a ''very riband in the cap of youth'' but we
await ''To be or not to be, dude, that is the question . . . not.''
Next: Kenneth Branagh in Wayne's World 3.
OJ tells all
STILL with culture, we hear that O J Simpson's book I Want to Tell You
(not his first words to the LA polis, incidentally) has hit the top of
the US bestseller lists within days of release. Among the shock
revelations is Mr Simpson's claim that it wisnae him, honest, really,
hand on heart . . .
Less than dear Abby
BOOKWORM II: Sainsbury's, those nice sun-dried tomato and Bulgarian
plonk people, are taking their duties to their customers very seriously
indeed. Having received all of four complaints, the shop has withdrawn a
children's book deemed damaging to tiny tots.
Abigail on the Beach, by Felix Pirani, tells of how Abigail's dad
packs three cans of lager for a day out, the monster. It adds that while
playing on the sand Abigail suddenly threatens every other child on the
beach, tells two boys that her daddy is in the Mafia and will hang them
up by the heels if they mess with her sandcastle, and warns a little
girl that her pet dog will be ''shot full of holes'' if it continues to
sniff around her diggings.
Mrs Victoria Trevor, who bought the book for her two-year-old in
Portsmouth, said: ''The only moral of this story seemed to be that to
stop other children from ruining your sandcastle you have to threaten
them with violence.'' That was always our experience. Perhaps, however,
Abigail on the Beach should henceforth be known as Pulped Fiction.
Representation
without taxation
ONCE they've stopped knocking lumps out of one another over whether
independence should happen tomorrow or the day after, the SNP might take
notice of a brilliant wheeze by the Irish Government. Realising that
there are almost as many people who have left the country as there are
who have stayed, they plan a referendum to amend the constitution and
allow three overseas Irish persons seats in the Senate.
Think of the possibilities for Scotland's political class: Auntie
Jessie back from Brisbane telling them to get their feet off the seats;
Uncle Tam from Manitoba rising from the back benches to recall how in
his day MPs knew their place.
The added benefit would be that all those Scots planning to emigrate
the day independence is declared could still interfere in the country's
affairs from afar. Bit like the Tory Party, really.
Christ, the sequel
WE don't say Richard Holloway, Bishop of Edinburgh, is a man with a
sense of humour, but we do notice that his new book for Easter -- Behold
Your King! Meditations on the Death and Resurrection of Christ -- comes
hot on the heels of his seminal text Anger, Sex, Doubt and Death.

OPENNESS has never been the present Government's strongest suit. This
is a pity, for Mr Major's hurried broadcast to the nation last night,
and the preceding and tensely controlled appearance of Sir Patrick
Mayhew in the Commons, is the direct result of the furtive and
frustrating nature of the Northern Ireland peace process. The actual
catalyst for yesterday's confusion, and the Government's scrabbling
attempt to regain control of the peace process, was the leak of
important elements of the framework document for Northern Ireland's
future. This document has been the subject of lengthy discussions
between the British and Irish Governments. It has also been the focus of
intense distrust on the part of the Unionist community in Northern
Ireland and in the minds of many Unionists yesterday that suspicion was
vindicated. None of this detracts from the power of Mr Major's warning
last night that the direct result of the failure of the peace process
will be more bloodshed, degradation, and misery. He is quite correct.
The problem is that his strategy for achieving peace is beginning to
unravel and the strands are coming undone because of the uneasy
suspicion among Unionists that they have been elbowed aside from the
substantive discussions and are now virtually uninformed observers.
The core of the framework document, at least as far as the leaked
portions are concerned, is the proposal for a joint North-South body
with sweeping executive powers. The ramifications of this proposal are
of the utmost importance but, as Sir Patrick Mayhew insisted yesterday,
it requires agreement and consent before any portion of any document
acquires weight. Sir Patrick's defence of the Government position was
eloquent and forthright, but particularly important for his careful use
of words. This became evident when Mr James Molyneaux of the Ulster
Unionists complained that he had been told last December that a
framework document did not exist, although the leaked details precede
his December inquiry. Sir Patrick's reply that there was no agreement on
a framework document, and to that extent no framework document existed,
is the purest sophistry and not good enough. It joins Mr Major's
misleading reassurance to Ulster political leaders last week on the
question of joint authority, and the earlier but damning denial and then
admission of talks between the Government and the IRA, as evidence of
governmental lack of openness.
There is no need to doubt Mr Major's frequent insistence that a
settlement will not be imposed on Northern Ireland, indeed it could not
be. Nevertheless, the leaked portion shows that the framework document
will be detailed and far reaching. Radical documents of this sort have a
habit of developing a momentum of their own which can come close to
denying full consultation. For the moment Mr Major must wrestle with the
problems caused by current negotiating methods. He appears to have
calmed his own back benchers but the Irish Government is increasingly
worried by his weakness and the various Ulster Unionists are threatening
to withdraw their general support for his Government if they are not
given some satisfaction. With rebel Tories still adrift, Mr Major cannot
let this happen. The net result may be increased influence for the
Unionists, and further delays in the framework document. This is not
what Mr Major intended but he must pay for the failure to achieve a
proper balance between negotiating in confidence and the proper
involvement of all interested parties.

THE Prime Minister wants us to believe that the National Health
Service is safe in his hands. As our story this morning shows, it is not
even safe in his own backyard. The achievements of the service are not
in dispute -- few medical procedures will fail to establish new records
annually, and the throughput of patients is always going up (though such
figures always need careful interpretation). The evidence seems to be,
however, that morale within the service is poor and that many of its
doctors are becoming more unhappy with the terms and conditions of their
work. Junior doctors are certainly unhappy with their lot, for while
their former excessively long hours of work have been cut, insufficient
new recruits have emerged to fill the inevitable gap created. This
situation may prove to be temporary (something like it existed when
nurses' hours of work were reduced) but there does seem to be a shortage
of doctors willing and able to fill vital roles in hospital wards. The
consequent additional stress on those doctors actually working is deeply
resented, as are jokey offers from highly-paid company executives to do
the same job at the same rate.
There is an even more obvious shortage of doctors in hospital accident
and emergency departments all over the country. This is an area where
the work is demanding (and sometimes dangerous), especially at weekends
when drink and violence add their own crop of nasty casualties to the
toll of road accidents. Doctors are not queuing up for such unpleasant
employment but the method of short-term (six-month) contracts for
accident and emergency work leaves the shortage acute at the beginning
of every August and February, from which dates the new contracts
operate. In the past there seemed to be a steady stream of locums
flowing into such work when junior doctors were not available. It is a
fast-drying flow, however, for the number of locums appears to be
diminishing, as many have reverted to permanent jobs. Attempts to
recruit more in Europe, from as far afield as Poland, have not afforded
sufficient replacements. To make matters worse the appeal of North
American medicine (that is Canada as well as the US) remains as
attractive as ever to some British doctors.
One result of the shortage is that competing hospitals are having to
push up wage offers well beyond the normal. The new devolved structure
of the NHS makes that relatively easy, but it drives a horse and cart
through existing pay structures, and the collective bargaining which
establishes and modifies them on national assumptions. The Government
may like the possibilities of this switch from nationally to locally
determined wage rates but in the case of doctors' pay it seems unlikely
that any such change will reduce the total wage bill; it is more likely
to push it up when some hospitals are already finding that they have to
offer as much as five times the previous rates to fill vacancies in
accident and emergency. This position surely qualifies the general, and
often repeated, optimistic statements of the Health Secretary about the
well-being of the NHS.

THE pilot of a North Sea helicopter which ditched after being struck
by lightning has been praised for his considerable skill in an official
report into the accident.
Senior First Officer Lionel Sole, 39, was commended for achieving a
gentle touchdown on the sea after switching off both engines during a
flight from Aberdeen to the Brae platform.
All 16 passengers along with Mr Sole and the aircraft commander, Capt
Cedric Roberts, escaped without injury from the Bristow's helicopter and
were rescued by stand-by vessels after the incident on January 19.
The special report by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch of the
Department of Transport, which was published yesterday, says that after
taking off at 11.38am for the 120-mile journey to Brae for a routine
crew change, the Super Puma helicopter started a descent towards the
platform at 12.33pm.
''One minute later there was a loud bang and a flash as lightning
struck the helicopter which immediately began to vibrate severely,'' the
report states.
''The first officer, who was the handling pilot, transmitted a Mayday
call saying he had had a lightning strike and was going to ditch.
However, although the severe vibration continued, the helicopter was
quite controllable so he levelled out at 1300ft, and the commander told
Brae Traffic that he was going to proceed to the Brae A platform, which
was his closest diversion.''
''No sooner had he said that than there was a loud crack and the
helicopter yawed rapidly left, rolled, and pitched down.
''Another Mayday was transmitted informing Brae Traffic that the
helicopter had suffered tail rotor failure and that a ditching was
imminent. The aircraft commander shut down both engines to prevent the
helicopter from yawing rapidly and the first officer demonstrated
considerable skill in achieving a gentle touchdown on the sea.''
The report said that the crew operated the helicopter's flotation
system and, in spite of a five or six-metre swell and wind gusting to 40
knots, the helicopter remained upright.
The doors were jettisoned and both liferafts inflated, but the left
side could not be used, and the passengers and crew made an orderly
evacuation into the other liferaft, and then cast off its attachment to
the helicopter.
Another helicopter on the Brae B heard the distress message and led
the search. It found the ditched helicopter at 13.05 and assumed the
role of on-scene commander.
Four other helicopters, a Nimrod aircraft, and two stand-by vessels
were involved in the rescue and the survivors were taken off the
liferaft by the fast rescue craft of the Grampian Freedom and the St
Patrick.
The supply vessel Highland Pride attached a line to the helicopter,
but the flotation system was punctured and it sank. The helicopter was
recovered later by a salvage team.

A MAN was yesterday cleared of killing his partner during a tiff. The
High Court in Glasgow heard that Margaret Goligher, 37, died from a
freak blow behind her ear.
Doctors who examined her body said the injury could have either been
caused by a clip on the ear or during a fall.
But, whatever happened, hardly any force had been used to cause her
death.
Stuart Archer, who lived with Ms Goligher for nearly nine years, was
cleared of culpable homicide after a three-day trial.
As he walked from the court, Mr Archer, 34, of Hood Street, Clydebank,
said: ''The last three months have been a nightmare.
''I feel so sorry for Ms Goligher's family. They have lost a loved
one.
''I loved Ms Goligher, too, but I didn't mean her any harm, and I
didn't kill her. Whatever happened was a freak accident.''
During the trial witnesses who were with the couple in a flat at
Kingsway Court, Scotstoun, Glasgow, on the night of October 4 last year
told how she and Mr Archer had been arguing.
They saw Ms Goligher on the floor, but no-one saw Mr Archer do
anything to her.
Ms Goligher got up and lay on a settee where she fell unconscious and
died.
Mr Archer and a friend tried to resuscitate her, using the kiss of
life, but their efforts were unsuccessful.
Soon afterwards, the court heard, Mr Archer tried to kill himself by
jumping from a veranda. He was sobbing: ''She's dead, she's dead.'' But
his friends hauled him back.
Pathologists told the court that Ms Goligher died from bleeding on the
surface of the brain.
There were no injuries on her body apart from a small associated
bruise just behind her right ear which had been leaking blood into her
brain.

THE Government yesterday gave formal approval for the #500m
development of the Captain field in the North Sea which will create
around 2000 jobs in Scotland, including 1000 at UIE, Clydebank.
A contract worth more than #300m had already been awarded to a joint
team of contractors, including the UIE yard, ABB, Stena Offshore Ltd,
and Astano.
The Captain field lies 90 miles north-east of Aberdeen in the Inner
Moray Firth.
The water is 350ft deep, and the development involves a well head
protection platform connected by a network of pipelines to a floating,
production, storage, and offloading vessel (FPSO) on which the crude oil
will be processed.
Oil will be exported from the field by shuttle tanker.
Texaco, to obtain the maximum out of the reservoir, will use extensive
horizontal drilling with sections up to 6000ft.
The FPSO will process 60,000 barrels of oil each day.Production is
expected to begin late next year.
The go-ahead came as Amerada Hess announced that the two-phase
development of the Hudson field, 300 miles north-east of Aberdeen, has
entered its second phase.
The first was production through the Petrojarl I floating, production,
storage, and offloading vessel which started in the field in July 1993.
On January 26 after having produced more than 17 million barrels of
the field's estimated reserves of 86 million barrels, the Petrojarl
ceased production. The phase two facilities have been brought into
operation two months ahead of schedule.
The Hudson platform is now connected to Shell's Tern platform on which
new facilities have been installed.
Amoco (UK) Exploration Company, operator of the Central Area
Transmission System (Cats), yesterday awarded a contract worth more than
#8m to expand the Cats natural gas terminal at Teeside.
The contract, with the Ralph M Parsons Company Ltd., is part of an
#80m project which will involve around 400 construction workers at its
peak.
The new facilities will process gas from the Armada gas field 155
miles north-east of Aberdeen. It is expected to begin production in late
1997.

The would-be author who played in his own drama was thwarted by its
unexpected turns. CHRIS HOLME reports on a poisoning plot that cost Paul
Agutter his freedom.
It was a crime story with everything --
more academics and doctors than
Inspector Morse could have coped with
in Oxford, more red herrings than
Agatha Christie could have invented,
and more extraordinary convolutions
than a plot by Ruth Rendell.
It was too bizarre a case for any work of
fiction. But it all started with something
shared by every family in Britain -- the
weekly trip to the supermarket.
THE FIRST VICTIMS
ELIZABETH Sharwood-Smith took a two-litre bottle of tonic water from
the shelves at the Safeway Hunter's Tryst store in Edinburgh, not
knowing that it had been put there five hours earlier laced with 250
times the normal medical dose of atropine and enough to kill up to 15
people.
For poisoner Paul Agutter it could not have fallen into worse hands.
The store has a potential range of 750,000 customers in Lothian of
whom just 49 are consultant anaesthetists, the very people who use
atropine in their daily work.
Elizabeth's husband Geoffrey is a consultant anaesthetist at Edinburgh
Royal Infirmary. The tonic was intended to add to the gins of two doctor
friends arriving from Newcastle to see a play at the Edinburgh Festival:
neurochemist Elaine Perry, whose special academic interest is
hallucinatory drugs derived from plants, and her neuropathologist
husband Robert.
That Wednesday (August 24) Elizabeth poured herself a pre-dinner
Vermouth and tonic and eldest son Andrew, 18, had a glass of tonic. They
became violently ill with pulses racing to 140 beats per minute,
suffering hallucinations and temporary blindness.
At first it was put down to bad attack of flu. Geoffrey already
suspected some form of accidental poisoning by the time the Perrys
arrived.
''Fortunately, for some reason I made them a cup of tea, instead of
offering them a drink,'' he recalled. ''Elaine said afterwards she could
have killed a gin and tonic, but two large ones could have killed her.''
They sat down to talk about the case. Elaine Perry searched the garden
for deadly nightshade berries (from which atropine is produced) just in
case some had accidently had found their way into some vegetables.
By Friday morning both victims had apparently recovered. Dr
Sharwood-Smith again discussed the incident with colleagues on a night
out but the horrifying confirmation came on his return. Elizabeth and
Andrew had drunk more of the tonic. He found his wife in bed and unable
to move and Andrew dazed and hallucinating.
They were rushed by ambulance to the Royal Infirmary. Dr
Sharwood-Smith frantically asked them questions about what they had
eaten and drunk. By very careful process of elimination, he had actually
identified the poison and its source.
Despite his rank in the hospital, his claim was initially met with
disbelief by accident and emergency staff on a busy Friday night.
The Saturday proved a frustrating and exhausting day for Geoffrey
Sharwood-Smith in trying to get over the seriousness of the situation to
the outside world.
''Although we had worked it out clearly, it seemed too bizarre an
occurence for outsiders to believe,'' he said.
He tried to contact the environmental health department and went to
Safeway's in Hunter's Tryst and persuaded the manager to remove the
batch of tonic from the shelves and take a sample from his bottle for
analysis.
On Sunday everything changed.
Two people were admitted to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary with exactly the
same symptoms as Andrew and Elizabeth Sharwood-Smith.
Alex Agutter and a girl aged 11, who cannot be named for legal
reasons, were both seriously ill. Accident and emergency staff
remembered the insistence of a colleague two days earlier that his
family had been poisoned by atropine in tonic water.
THE PLOT
IF the the plan was to engineer a scare of consumer terrorism as a
cover to kill his wife, Paul Agutter demonstrated both extreme ingenuity
and stupidity.
Various Safeway stores in Edinburgh had been the target of a poisoner
nicknamed the Raven who in 1987 started a campaign to extort #100,000
out of the company. He used paraquat and ground glass and left warning
labels on the products but was never caught.
As a result, the supermarket chain installed security video cameras
which played a crucial role in Agutter's downfall.
Key questions remained unresolved. Having planted an esoteric poison,
Agutter could not have forseen that one of the seven bottles -- and the
one with the second highest concentration of atropine -- would have
landed in the Sharwood-Smiths' trolley.
He was dependent for the perfect alibi on it being discovered but he
had no control on who, how and when.
Thanks to Geoffrey Sharwood-Smith, the secret was out too early, but
it could easily have passed undetected.
Agutter also had to ensure that his wife was seen to ask for a gin and
tonic, rather than him foisting the drink on her. It appears she had
opted for glass of wine before Sunday.
There was another person to lend credibility, a gardener who tasted
the gin and tonic. He was an ideal outside witness and a useful alibi
for Agutter who said he could not have a drink because he had to drive
him.
When his wife complained about the taste of drink Paul Agutter phoned
their GP, leaving a message on the answering machine. A locum doctor
picked up the message far more quickly than he had anticipated and was
at the house in Athelstaneford within minutes.
Ambulance technician James Rudyj was sufficiently alert to ask about
the remains of any of the drinks. Agutter provided what was left in his
wife's glass and this was put into a jar. This was to prove of critical
importance.
The high concentration of atropine in it indicated that the drink had
been tampered with by the person who had poured it.
THE INVESTIGATION
DETECTIVE Superintendent John McGowan of Lothian and Borders Police
got the call from Dr Keith Little, senior accident and emergency
consultant at the Royal Infirmary, on Sunday evening.
Two severe cases of toxic poisoning were bad enough but there was also
a link with the other two 36 hours earlier.
Detectives were assigned to take statements from both families.
Lothian Health Board and Edinburgh's environmental health department
were immediately alerted as part of emergency procedures.
Geoffrey Sharwood-Smith's painstaking forensic work was vindicated in
the early hours. An early break came from the police chemist who
identified atropine in the second of an array of 50 tests he had to
carry out.
By 3am on the Monday all the Safeway drinks shelves had been cleared.
Police called a press conference to alert the public and find the
other bottles. They received 160 calls in the first day.
Various lines were pursued. Initial suggestions that it could have
been the work of a disgruntled ex-serviceman using supplies gained in
the Gulf War were soon discounted.
Then another red herring surfaced. The Edinburgh Evening News
published details of a threat made by a man claiming responsibility for
the poisonings. Two weeks earlier he had threatened to poison police
officers with Lucozade spiked with weed killer placed on the shelves of
Edinburgh shops.
A psychological profile was prepared, but the man, who lived just a
stone's throw from the Safeway Hunter's Tryst store, then denied he was
responsible. He was eliminated from the inquiry. He was later prosecuted
for causing a public mischief and is now undergoing psychiatric
treatment.
Other lines also needed to be pursued. There was a possibility of a
grudge by one of the 200 workers against the supermarket management. In
addition one senior member of staff had also worked at most of the other
Edinburgh stores involved in the Raven scares.
By Friday the police laboratory had identified four of the bottles and
also had evidence on the concentrations found in them.
The highest was in that found in the Agutter household, added to which
was the far higher concentration still in Alex Agutter's glass.
A renewed publicity appeal yielded another dividend. A part-time
worker at the store remembered seeing a man pushing a trolley with
bottles hidden under a green coat.
Around 40 security camera tapes which had been looked at before
without a result were viewed again on Sunday.
This time police saw a man acting suspiciously. The officers who
initially interviewed Agutter were contacted at home. When they came in,
they recognised him immediately.
Detectives raided the Agutter house at Athelstaneford at 7.30am on the
following Monday. They found a green jacket and a purple top, the type
of which was seen in the video. It was in a Safeway bag, complete with
the till receipt.

ATROPINE is derived from deadly nightshade, one of the oldest poisons
known to man, but its use by criminals in Britain over the last 40 years
is virtually unknown.
That could have been Paul Agutter's stroke of genius. Ironically, in
December, on the eve of his trial the BBC screened The Wimbledon
Poisoner based on Nigel Williams's novel in which the villain, Detective
Inspector Rush, admits to having used . . . atropine.
Agutter had an interest in fiction and notions of writing a novel. The
Williams novel was first published in 1990 and there are some uncanny
similarities. In interviews with police, Agutter spoke of getting his
hands on the ''blighter'' responsible
That word appears in the novel, whose plot also features the a
supermarket spiking of a chicken. Rush says: ''I wasn't able to get as
much atropine into the chicken. You see I injected quite a few things at
random and I didn't get much time. They're always watching you.''
The inspector later confesses: ''I got the idea from Everett Maltby
(the original Wimbledon poisoner) . . . . You could poison a lot of
people and then you could poison the one person you wanted to kill and
people wouldn't think it was you. They'd think it was a maniac.''
Agutter's desire to achieve some kind of fame is mirrored by Rush's
remark ''It's a funny thing about poisoners. Most of them want to get
caught. It's a club, do you know what I mean? They have to show their
cleverness to the world.''
Whatever motivated Agutter, it is clear he had a detailed knowledge of
atropine. Symptoms would usually be confused with a common drug overdose
or even dabbling with magic mushrooms.
The body also fully ingests it within four hours, leaving no trace.
Had Alex Agutter drunk her full glass, she could have easily died.
Agutter's plan depended on four hours elapsing before she was admitted
to hospital and tests were carried out, but events moved far quicker and
what remained of her drink had been retained.
Atropine is also one of the most commonly available drugs used in
every laboratory, chemists and operating theatre in the country. Tiny
quantities are used in preparations ranging from eye ointments and
asthma treatments.
In the medical textbooks the symptoms of atropine are characterised as
''hot as an iron, blind as a bat and mad as a hatter'', exactly those
spotted by Geoffrey Sharwood-Smith.
Initial diagnosis would suggest flu, but the blindness and
hallucinations would later confound this to any experienced observer.
For the poisoner, its bitter taste would make it ideal to be
introduced into water, especially tonic water already containing
quinine.
But its application also requires reasonable pharmacological
knowledge. The different concentrations used by Agutter produced varied
results. One person who had consumed several drinks was seen by a GP and
admitted to a psychiatric clinic.
But for good fortune, the random terrorism employed by Agutter as a
smokescreen to establish his innocence, could easily have claimed a
younger victim.

THE Agutters seemed a perfectly ordinary couple in the East Lothian
village of Athelstaneford. Locals thought he was a doctor, a notion he
did nothing to dispel, although he is a doctor of philosophy rather than
a medical practitioner.
Alex Agutter 39, is also a PhD. She taught Scots in the
English-language department of Edinburgh University before leaving in
1988.
Paul Agutter 48, had been married before. His married his first wife
Jennifer in 1970 and, after a fairly stormy relationship, they divorced
five years later.
Born in Glossop, Derbyshire, Paul Agutter first arrived in Edinburgh
in 1964 to study medicine, but he switched courses after two years. He
gained a first class BSc in 1968 and worked as demonstrator in
biochemistry at Edinburgh University between 1971 and 1974 during which
time he gained a PhD in molecular biology.
Paul and Alex were married in 1976 and he joined the staff of Napier
College as a lecturer the following year. Promotion followed as it
changed first into a polytechnic and then into a university. His
position at the time of his arrest was reader in cell biology, carrying
a salary of more than #31,000.
Few doubted the couple's intellectual glitter. Impromptu limericks and
clever puns, sometimes self-mocking, were features of the banter around
their dinner table at Kilduff Lodge. In 1983 they co-wrote a paper
entiled Aspects of Fuzziness in the Semantics and Pragmatics of English.
Less clear was the emotional integrity of the marriage. Over the last
five years they continued to live under the same roof while both had
affairs with other partners. There were deeper undercurrents of emotive
turmoil beneath this outwardly civilised arrangement.
Alex has a direct manner and friends also spoke of a manic side to
Paul Agutter.
In the months leading to the poisoning, he was said to have been
suffering from depression linked to financial pressures of maintaining
the family home and a relationship he had developed with a former
student, Carole Bonsall.
At the police press conference after discovery of the bottles,
Geoffrey Sharwood-Smith was clear of what he thought of the poisoner:
''It was the work an evil and twisted mind.''
Interviewed by The Herald later that day, Agutter played the part of
victim well, but some of his comments did not ring wholly true. He knew
then that the police had figured out atropine had been used.
''It has been very stressful, quite ghastly, but I am becoming more
hopeful.''
Asked what he thought of the person who did it, he was more flustered:
''I really cannot imagine. I simply cannot understand that question at
all because it is beyond me to imagine what type of person could do
this.''
Agutter also seemed intrigued to learn that the other victims had been
in a doctor's family and, the following week before his arrest, he made
contact with the Sharwood-Smiths.
''To us at the time, this was just another family which had been
poisoned,'' recalls Geoffrey Sharwood-Smith. ''He told us he was
medically qualified and not practising. That was lie. He also said this
to other people. ''He appeared to know how much atropine could go into
tonic water before it could be detected by taste.
''I was astonished by this. Even though he was a biochemist, it was an
odd thing to know. He definitely had expert knowledge about atropine and
seemed to want to show it off.''
While on remand in Saughton Prison, Agutter was visited by his wife,
who was still apparently convinced of his innocence.
Two days after his arrest, he also wrote an extraordinary letter to
Geoffrey Sharwood-Smith, insisting that it was the work of a supermarket
poisoner, and expressing hope that he would be caught soon, ''hopefully
without any fatalities''.
Agutter said he had faith in the judicial system and was confident he
would not be convicted. He emphasised his liking and respect for his
wife, but said he loved Carole and he definitely wanted to marry her.
But for some people who knew Agutter, his conviction came as no
surprise.
''I could believe he cooked this up simply to see if he could get away
with it,'' said one former acquaintance. ''He was someone who took pride
in his cunning.''
Agutter's conviction means that life for the Sharwood-Smiths and other
victims can now return to normal. ''It was something of a miracle that
has no-one was killed. But for some extraordinary chances, he could have
got away with it,'' says Dr Sharwood-Smith. ''It was so clever and
convenient. But he was just too clever.''

IT was not enough for Agutter to win, as he did, the admiration,
respect and often fondness of many fellow-academics and most of his
students, writes JAMES ROBERTSON. He appears to have entertained
thoughts of much more widespread recognition and to have indulged in
visions of future fame, picturing himself as a candidate for
international acclaim.
Agutter provided a glimpse of this Walter Mitty-ish aspect of his
ambitions in the cv he drew up and sent to a publishers' consultant in
pursuit of the unscientific goal of being hailed as a literary lion. The
document also betrayed an unexplained dislike for psychiatrists.
In it, he split his ambition into two classes -- his ''sane'' and his
''deranged''. The ''sane'' side aspired ''to be a productive research
worker'' and other worthy goals, while under the other heading he
declared that he wanted ''to see the solution of major, current human
problems, gain an FRS, gain immense public esteem, Nobel Prize (medicine
or literature -- not fussy), have a letter to The Times printed, etc''.
In 1980, by which time he was a senior lecturer, he was seeking expert
guidance on the ''viability'' of a novel he had penned, titled
''Perilaus''. His literary credentials were one short story, which he
stated appeared in a magazine in 1975, and 30 to 40 scientific papers
and reviews.
The consultant, who was never to meet the budding novelist, rejected
it as a publishable proposition, expressing the opinion that Agutter had
been ''carried away by your ingenuity to the extent that the book
becomes self-indulgent''.
However, despite this criticism, the consultant recognised that the
writer was not without talent and looked forward to the opportunity of
reading future attempts.
The consultant did not hear from Agutter again until he received a
phone call from him in May of last year -- followed by manuscripts of
two children's stories about a character called ''Sir Flugel''.
He offered encouraging criticisms, but again returned the manuscripts,
suggesting that Agutter, by now promoted to a readership, deal directly
with potential publishers.
Agutter has listed his likes as ''music, literature, open countryside,
well-behaved dogs, Burgundy of respectable age, log fires and my work''.
His dislikes are ''pop music, television, nuclear power plants,
badly-behaved dogs, idleness, Hirondelle red, psychiatrists and
bureaucrats''.
Agutter's work as a reader was mainly on the research side, organising
and co-ordinating the work of research students under him.
One fellow-academic said: ''Paul was certainly very well-liked by the
students -- very approachable and very helpful. He was quietly
authoritarian.
''He was also well-liked by many of the staff. Some people didn't like
him, but that was because he was so keen.
''He was certainly enthusiastic in everything he did. Time didn't mean
anything to him. He would stay on and do anything that had to be done
until he was satisfied it was done.
''He was a very keen DIY man at home. We talked about that sort of
thing. But I don't know anything about his intimate, domestic life.''
The colleague added: ''When I heard what he'd been charged with, it
came as a thunderbolt to me. Others felt the same. We couldn't believe
it.''
Told of Agutter's various ambitions as stated in his CV, the colleague
said: ''He would say things like that and not really be meaning it. It's
like someone else saying they'd like to win the pools.''
A second colleague was equally shattered by Agutter's arrest.
''I found him, honestly, to be one of nature's gentlemen. He certainly
took the interests of students very much to heart. He was just a very
caring person --though he could appear slightly aloof, which is often in
the nature of researchers.''

<TEXT>
A TURKISH Cypriot businessman ordered to forfeit #650,000 of a #1m
bail surety for fugitive tycoon Asil Nadir yesterday won a Court of
Appeal bid to have the order quashed.
The court ruled by a 2-1 majority that Ramadan Guney was not obliged
to pay because Mr Nadir had surrendered to custody in June 1992 and Mr
Guney's obligation as a surety had ended.
The ruling on a legal technicality was a blow to the Serious Fraud
Office which now faces a bill for legal costs unofficially estimated at
#60,000.
The SFO was given leave to challenge yesterday's split decision in the
House of Lords.
Mr Guney, 65, of Green Lanes, north London, said: ''I am pleased to
say justice has been done.''
His successful appeal was against a ruling in July 1993 -- upheld by
two High Court judges in January last year -- that he was liable to pay
the #650,000 after Mr Nadir absconded to Northern Cyprus, following a
preliminary court hearing, to avoid trial on charges of theft and false
accounting.
Old Bailey judge Mr Justice Tucker, who conducted the preliminary
hearing, did not regard the businessman as having surrendered to the
court and stated the bail conditions continued.
The SFO argued that Mr Nadir was not required to surrender that day
and had not done so, while Mr Guney's lawyers contended that Mr Nadir
had attended court because he was required to do so and therefore
surrendered.
In the appeal court, Sir Thomas Bingham, Master of the Rolls,
concluded there had been no surrender, saying: ''Plainly the judge here
did not intend to require Mr Nadir to surrender to the custody of the
court or believe that he had done so.''
But Sir Michael Mann and Lord Justice Peter Gibson disagreed. Lord
Justice Gibson said: ''In my judgment a surrender to the custody of the
court occurs when a defendant on bail and under a duty so to surrender
is required to attend the court and responds by attending the court and
overtly subjecting himself to the directions of the court.''

YOU may, like me, have grown up believing that insurance is your
security blanket. A man in a trilby used to come round every Saturday
morning to collect the money, stashed under the statuette of the lady
with a chalk alsation, for penny policies. It was carefully notated in
cramped blue ink columns in a book kept in the sideboard.
When somebody died you got money back to pay for the Co-op funeral,
along with sympathy, a handshake and a new policy: if something was
stolen or broken he would come along to hand over a lump sum in cash
from his black bag.
The man in the trilby was respected. More than that, he was trusted.
People listened to his advice and believed it. Like a doctor, or a
teacher. Apart, that is, from one man whom my grandfather had long
regarded as a bit suspect and who ran away with a week's takings from
his rounds. What could you expect, granddad asked, from a man who wore a
feather in his hat?
Now, it seems, insurance is infested with the profiteering ethic, the
gallop for profits at the expense of trust betrayed.
I tell this story not because I have been ripped off, although that
might have happened. I tell it not because I feel hard done by, although
I do. I tell it because the man who arranges my insurance, a broker,
asked me to. You, he said, might have some clout. Many of my clients,
and many thousands more like them, have none. They are being swizzed.
If you read this column regularly you may recall that a thief broke
into our house late last year. He took only jewellery. The items were of
sentimental value. I couldn't care less how much my mother's locket was
worth for cash. To me it was priceless. And irreplaceable. And that was
true of nearly every item stolen.
When I came to calculate the value of the thief's haul, the sum was
not inconsiderable. I did it as accurately as one can (without taking a
flight back in time to Singapore, how was I supposed to know what a
friend spent on a ring she sent for my 21st birthday? How do you ask
your best friend how much she spent on your Christmas present the year
before last?).
Still, when the loss adjuster came round to case the house and, one
assumes, me in case I was a lying fraudster, he confirmed that we were
not under-insured.
As he was about to leave, he dropped casually into the conversation
the news that I would not be receiving any money from the insurance
company. Eh? You could have knocked me over with a feather. But he
wasn't wearing one, or a hat either.
No, he explained, in a helpful tone, what happens now is that you go
along to a jeweller, a designated jeweller, a jeweller specified by the
insurance company. He will provide the insurance company with a
valuation and, wait for it, he will replace the items stolen.
But these items cannot be replaced, I said, rather reasonably I
thought considering that what I wanted to do was clock him with an empty
jewellery box and burst into tears.
I don't want to spend an hour splurging on gold earrings and silver
lockets I don't need or want. I don't want new jewellery. I want what
was stolen. Given that it's not coming back, and was in all probability
melted down to pay for a day or two's shot of heroin, I want the sum it
was insured for back from the insurance company. From the same insurance
company who have contentedly swallowed progressively larger premiums
every year for many years.
He shook his head sadly. You don't understand. It is entirely within
our power to insist on replacements . . . But you can't replace them . .
.
We got nowhere.
I went to the jeweller's shop of the insurance company's choosing.
After two hours of haggling over the price of silver in 1956 and the
style of cufflinks in 1927, I emerged with a valuation which matched my
own.
Weeks later a letter arrived from the insurance company: glad to tell
you, pleased to let you know, delighted to say: if I cared to drop along
to the same jeweller's shop they would replace my jewellery.
Like hell they would.
The letter was followed up by a phone call from an oily geezer in the
jeweller's, assuring me of his best attentions. You betcha. And did I
realise, he confided, that I did not have to buy all my new jewellery in
one session? No siree, he was pleased to tell me I could simply open an
account with them and go along whenever I liked and pick up the odd
gee-gaw here, a gold bracelet there . . .
I spun him along, I confess: well that's nice then, so I come along
and pick out a bit of jewellery here and another there . . . Yes, he
enthused, obviously thinking the zipper on the back of my head was
stuck, and we'll just keep an account . . .
So, I simpered, YOU get money from the insurance company -- my money
-- and you get the use of it and if I am stupid enough I will come along
and occasionally pick out the odd bawble . . .
You catch the drift. I suspect by the close of conversation he
realised that the oleaginous voice had not washed over an entirely happy
specimen of dumb womanhood.
This, in case you think I was insured on the cheap, was no policy with
the Bolivian Iron Smelters Benevolent Insurance Inc, registered at
Lloyds, and run by a man with a feather in his hat. This was one of the
leading insurance companies.
The insurance broker, through whom the policy was arranged, tells me
that this has become common practice over the past few years. I will not
name him because he makes his living from such companies. He doesn't
wear a trilby but he is an honest man. It worries him, as it does many
of his clients forced to accept jewellery they don't want, from a shop
not of their choosing . . .
The deal works to the advantage of all except, it seems, to me, the
person who has been robbed. Say the jewellery is valued at #1000. The
insurance company gets a discount from the jeweller. The jeweller gets a
fine sale. The client? You get what the insurance company tells you and
what the jeweller can provide. And, er, that's it.
It disturbs the broker that people still trust insurance companies to
protect their interests when increasingly the money-grubbing race for
profits betrays any notion of public service. Never mind you, he said,
there's the window cleaner whose claim I had to take to an Ombudsman,
and the old lady whose claim was refused . . . and . . . and . . .
But he is, he accepts with some resignation and a great deal of
frustration, an old-fashioned man. He will get me most of the money he
believes I am due -- minus, of course, the discount the insurance
company did not get from the jeweller. Because I've got clout. But no
jewellery. And it will stay like that.
From now on, the only gold that will glister in my lugs will be
verdigris danglers.

THE nation's favourite washing powder is damaging its clothes. Today
the Consumers' Association announced that their tests show that clothes
are damaged by being washed in Persil Power.
Even the reformulated version of Persil Power -- with less manganese
damaged some clothes in normal washes. Tests on 200 garments worn by 100
volunteers and washed around 6000 times showed that garments washed in
reformulated Persil Power were 1.5 times weaker than those washed in a
rival brand. Those washed in original Persil Power were 2.5 times
weaker.
On the basis of these findings the CA has asked Lever Brothers to add
an explicit warning to pack of Persil Power powder that it should not be
used on colours, to publicise a compensation scheme for damaged clothes
and to offer to exchange packs of Persil Power for packs of New
Generation Persil when it is launched.
Sheila McKechnie, the new director of the CA, said: ''I find it
difficult to believe that a major company, with the resources of Lever,
made this kind of basic mistake about a product on the market. Everyone
makes mistakes. We judge companies on how they handle them.
''By that criterion, Lever could do more to ensure its customers are
fully informed of the risks of using this product on colours and of the
company's guarantee to provide compensation in the event of damage to
clothes.''
The damning report carried in today's edition of Which? is likely to
be the coup de grace in what has become known as the Soap War. I refer
not to the battle for viewers as waged by the likes of Brookside and
Eastenders but to the battle for customers currently being fought by
detergent giants, Lever (makers of Persil) and their arch rivals,
Procter and Gamble (known in the business as P&amp;G and makers of Ariel)
who, between them, spend more than #70m a year trying to persuade us to
buy their products.
According to the latest figures, consumers in the United Kingdom shell
out a whacking great #1 billion per annum on washing powders and
liquids. Approximately #237m of that goes on Ariel, slightly less --
#234m -- on Persil. You see the problem, then. We have the upstart Ariel
which came into being a mere 25 years ago, not just level with but
overtaking the venerable Persil, the world's first household detergent,
launched on to the market way back in 1907.
Well, last April, in a blaze of publicity, Lever introduced Persil
Power, a so-called across-the-wash detergent which, because of some
new-fangled secret ingredient called an ''accelerator catalyst'', could
allegedly ''remove more tough stains first time''. It was lauded as the
first of a ''new generation'' of washing powders and the ''biggest
technical breakthrough in 15 years''.
But the company's multi-million pound campaign to capture a bigger
share of the detergent market began to backfire when P&amp;G (makers of
Ariel, remember) started spreading nasty rumours about the efficacy of
the new super-product.
So powerful was Persil Power, they claimed, that it not only removed
those hard-to-shift stains but would, in certain circumstances, remove
the fabric as well.
The claims were later backed up with photographs of identical pairs of
cotton boxer shorts, one pair washed 16 times in Persil Power, the other
in Ariel Ultra. To Lever's undoubted horror, the Persil Power shorts
looked as if they'd been put through a shredder while the ones given the
Ariel Ultra treatment looked as good as new.
P&amp;G, looking cleaner by the minute, further revealed that they, too,
had been carrying out research into the use of an ''accelerator'' (also
made, like the Persil Power one, from manganese) but had decided not to
incorporate it into their own products when they discovered it could
seriously damage certain fibres.
Thus it was that, in September, less than six months after the launch
of the best thing since Radion (another of the company's products,
incidentally), Lever publicly admitted that perhaps Persil Power was not
all they had originally cracked it up to be. It was not, it seemed, the
all-purpose product that most customers really want.
In a bid to salvage the multi million pound detergent with a miracle
ingredient, they modified the formula, reduced the concentration of the
manganese accelerator (which had been found to ''react badly'' to a
number of dark dyes) and stuck special information leaflets on the new,
improved packs.
The leaflets warned consumers that although Persil Power could be used
with confidence to obtain ''brilliant whites'', regular washing of
coloured articles with the product was not recommended.
But mud sticks (an expression obviously not thought up by a washing
powder ad man) and adverse publicity has seen Persil Power being taken
off the shelves in recent weeks by no fewer than three supermarket
chains: Waitrose, Sainsbury and Tesco.
Safeway is still stocking it but Lever may not be too comforted to
learn that some branches in Scotland are giving away a free Persil Power
refill (worth #4.29) with every #4.39 box.
Personally, I've never been tempted to use the stuff. I buy my washing
powder from the corner store because the supermarket is too far away to
carry heavy bags of messages from and the gossip is better. Mr and Mrs
Sagoo stock only the detergents that their customers ask for: Persil
Original Non Bio-logical (the one I use), Ariel Automatic, Bold Ultra
All-In- One, Happy Shopper (for hand washing and twin-tubs) and those
curious little packets of Acdo, a powder which comes from Bolton in
Lancashire and apparently conforms to Vegetarian Society standards.
''No-one's ever asked me for Persil Power,'' said Mrs Sagoo who
revealed that her customers were particularly resistent to change
(present company included) and would need more than a multi-million
pound advertising campaign to get them to switch brands.
''We got some Radion in when it first came out,'' she told me, ''but
when the last box had been sold, nobody asked for it again so we didn't
restock.''
Back in July, the original version of the new powder was one of 20
detergents tested by the Consumers' Association to show ''which are best
for getting stains out and keeping colours in.''
In common with all the other products, Persil Power was found to be
poor at shifting dirt from collars and cuffs. It scored an ''average''
for coffee stains, poorest for liquid make-up, excellent on grass
stains, one of the best on chocolate ice cream and the best at getting
rid of red wine.
Lever, in the meantime, have been busy preparing a ''replacement''
product for the ill-fated detergent. It's going to be called Generation
Persil, will be an across-the-wash powder and . . .

On St Valentine's Day Talk Radio UK blasts on to the airwaves, and
there will be little love lost as it gets a word in edgeways
BRITAIN's first national commercial speech-based radio station will go
on air at 7am on Tuesday, February 14, St Valentine's Day. Will it
establish a love affair with its intended listeners, or a financial
massacre for its backers?
Talk Radio UK is its name -- TRUK for short -- and the first talking
point must be to do with just how many people there are out there
prepared to lend their ears, find the time to listen when there is
already such a plethora of words of all kinds coming over the airwaves
from seven established network channels, countless local radio stations,
not to mention the pirate broadcasters. All of which are scrambling for
attention in competition multi-television outlets, terrestrial and
satellite, with much much more to come.
John Aumonier, managing director of TRUK, says a great deal of talk
had already taken place before the decision was taken to go for it. He
is a man with a lot of airwave business under his belt and he says that
two years of research, plus gut reaction, convinced them they had
located a gap between the other two national commercial stations, Virgin
and Classic FM. And in that gap, he claims, there is also an attractive
alternative to BBC Radios 4 and 5.
TRUK will be hard-nosed, controversial, relevant, irreverent, ''using
the language of today''. Provocative, stirring. The stirring being done
by a new breed of ''Shock Jocks'' who have been specially selected for
the job. The technique has been pioneered in America with spectacular
success.
Lord Reith will no doubt be doing a few more turns in his grave. A far
cry from his style of pioneering when announcers had to wear dinner
suits to read the news.
''Radio 4, the Grand Old Lady,'' he says, a touch condescendingly,
''is doing a super job. But in today's market it is more like 10
stations rolled into one. You never quite know what you're going to get,
be it a play, a short story, a quiz, news or current affairs discussion.
And its tone of voice tends to be terribly London and south-east biased,
aimed at a slightly older, upmarket audience.
''Talk Radio is going for all classes, mainly in the 25 to 55 age
group, but not excluding the oldies or the youngies.''
Aumonier has a lot of respect for Radio 5. ''It is doing a reasonable
job, but it's all about sport -- at least that's where its ratings
lie.''
He claims research has shown that 76% of people who listen exclusively
or mainly to speech services are dissatisfied with the service they get,
either to a small or huge degree. Just as important, music station
listeners who would welcome the occasional rest from music find the
speech alternatives unacceptable. ''We're not providing for the leafy
suburbs of London. We're firmly committed to being outrageously popular
nationwide,'' he says.
TRUK makes no secret of the fact that it is following the tried format
of Talk Radio stations in North America. The UK company's shareholders
are Media Ventures International, CanWest Global Communications Inc of
Canada, Emmis Broadcasting, Hambros Group Investments, and Radio
Investments Ltd. Its chairman is Sir David Nicholas, a non-executive
director of Channel 4 and former chairman of ITN.
It will be 97% speech-based, reaching 96% of the UK population,
broadcasting 24 hours a day on the medium wave frequencies occupied
until recently by BBC Radio 1. Interactive programming, ''based on
debate, humour, news, drama and entertainment shows, will be hosted by
high-profile presenters and some new faces.''
About half of its output will be conducted through phone-ins,
including international calls. It will be people-based rather than
journalist-inspired, to use the company's buzz words. Cab drivers and
insomniacs can stay off the line unless they have something worthwhile
to say -- an obvious dig at London phoners monotonously complaining
about holes in the road.
The arrival of these new airwave talkers will be closely monitored in
Scotland. At Clyde, Forth, the recently-launched Scot FM, currently
pulling itself out of the mire with its own Shock Jock, one Scotty
McClue, who says the most outrageous things to callers on to discuss
problems of an explicit sexual nature. And, of course, at the
essentially speech-based Radio Scotland, UK station of the year.
TRUK's state-of-the-art studios have been created in the old Palmolive
building in London's Oxford Street. There will be a Glasgow office and
Scottish independent producers are being encouraged to come up with
ideas.
The annual budget is believed to be in the region of #12m, modest in
comparison to Radio 4's #72m. The commodity it is selling to advertisers
is number of listening hours, as distinct from number of listeners.
Aumonier, aged 42, whose ancestors came over with the Huguenots 400
years ago, has a clear view of how Britain's present popular radio
pattern evolved so far as music is concerned.
''It goes back a few years. You had the pirate ships which led to
Radios 1 and 2. This led to independent local radio, Jimmy Gordon and
all that. Revolution might be too emotional a word for our activities,
but in terms of speech radio, the equivalent has never happened before
in Britain.''
As TRUK comes on air he will be celebrating his 21st year in
commercial radio. For many years he ran local stations in the south of
England. This was followed by a controversial spell when he was managing
director of Virgin Radio for six months, or five minutes, as he
describes it.
''I left before it went on air for all sorts of reasons, but mainly in
order to plot the present operation. So I had the dubious honour, all be
it for a short period, of being simultaneously MD of two out of three
national commercial services.''
Radio 4 currently sets the political agenda for the day with all the
top people prepared to be interviewed. ''So it will be with Talk
Radio,'' says Aumonier. ''But it will not be used as a megaphone for
politicians to simply propagate more of the same. They will rapidly find
out that the station has edge.'' He says they will provide a different
listening pattern -- ''I suppose closer to Channel 4 in thinking, but
without the volume of ghettos.''
So will he be hiving off listeners from Radios 4 and 5, Radio Scotland
and the commercial operators up here? ''Well, again, gut feeling and
research indicate that listening could come from anywhere, because our
type of service will appeal to music listeners as well as speech radio
listeners.
''We are not in the business of head-on competition. Every other
station, to some degree, is a target.''
Even before it starts, TRUK is causing tremors in the airwaves. It was
revealed at the weekend that Radio 1 DJ Steve Wright is quitting after
14 years to join the new station on a two-year deal worth #700,000.
Other signings include controversial former Sky News front man Scott
Chisholm.
Other signings: Central TV controller of sport Gary Newbon and agony
aunt Anna Raeburn, Jeremy Beadle, Terry Christian. Also the most
shocking Shock Jock of them all -- Caesar the Geezer from London's Kiss
100.
Aumonier believes, that with more and more stations opening locally
and nationally, listeners are becoming their own programme controllers.
He adds: ''There was one choice or the other. We had to decide whether
to be fish or fowl, and we decided to be fish.''

David Belcher talks to Don Paterson about how he came on to a game
when he discovered poetry
HE'S done great, the boy Paterson. He's gave 110% and he's got a
result. Half a chance and he's in there, seizing yon fleeting moods;
setting up self-puzzling evocations; giving form to scantly scented
memories. Sheer poetry. Sheer bloody poetry.
Which is good, because poetry is Don Paterson's game. His first
collection of the stuff, Nil Nil (Faber, #5.99), won the 1993 Forward
Poetry Prize, while he's also tucked away the Arvon Poetry Prize and
forced himself into the Poetry Society's 20-strong squad of New
Generation Poets.
And tomorrow in an away fixture at Glasgow's Tramway -- 7.30pm
kick-off, with a film-screening of The Double Life of Veronique in the
second half -- Don will be reading from his published work and from new
poetry created during his 18-month stint as Fellow in Creative Writing
at his hometown university, Dundee.
Yeah, he's done brilliant, like I said -- especially when you consider
that Don Paterson began his literary career with Draconian Dundonian
publishers D C Thomson, scripting the wee boys' weekly adventure comic,
Commando, as a 16-year-old. Persistent absenteeism -- and writing his
pals' names into Commando's tales of derring-do -- scuppered that job.
London beckoned. And, at at the age of 22, poetry.
''It was hearing Tony Harrison on TV in a mind-blowing pre-V
performance. And I was in love, and trying to impress a lassie. So I
wrote her a long poem.'' She left; Don's poetic ardour remained. Music
was blooming, too.
''I'd played music from early childhood, but was crap on everything,
ending up as a particularly crap third-trombonist in the Kirkton High
School band. But at 13, having deliberately avoided the guitar because
my dad has always played it, I began playing the guitar and found I was
OK at it.''
So good that at a tender age he became a member of established folkies
Talisker. Currently, Don plays in lone-furrow-ploughing
Celtic-jazz-polka cross-over pioneers Lammas, who are based in London.
Don's dad still plays, too, in a Tayside clubland country and western
band.
When he's not writing poetry or playing with Lammas at jazz festivals,
Don is supporting Dundee United. Hence Nil Nil. Or not, actually. ''Nil
Nil isn't about football. Via the inexorable decline of a rotten
Scottish football team who aren't Dundee United -- but who might be
eventually -- Nil Nil employs football as a metaphor. For pursuing to a
logical conclusion things that have no logical conclusion.''
Popped a screamer into the rigging there. Don Paterson: he's earned
himself a deserved psychological cushion at the end of the day.
* Further poetry readings in the Tramway's Between The Lines season,
which also features exhibitions of work by Roderick Buchanan and Steven
Willat, will be given by Edwin Morgan (February 10, accompanied by a
screening of Prospero's Books); Liz Lochhead (February 17, Latin For A
Dark Room), and W N Herbert (February 24, The Bitter Tea of General
Yen).

AN Lanntair gallery in Stornoway is to mark its tenth anniversary in
March with an exhibition focused on the Callanish Stones.
Featuring the famous Druidical stones as interpreted in pictures,
sculpture, and photographs, the exhibition will be complemented by the
publication of a book and a CD of jazz and Gaelic traditional music.
Since the gallery's inception, director Roddy Murray has been leading
the drive for its recognition as a premier venue for some of the finest
national exhibitions. It had been a busy first decade.
''But the work goes on and further and further afield too. We continue
our search for larger premises in Stornoway as An Lanntair (The Lantern)
has now outgrown its present base upstairs in the town hall,'' said
Murray.
The tenth anniversary celebrations are expensive to put on but Murray
said that #60,000 of the #90,000 target had already been achieved from
funders. ''It's not just to celebrate our birthday but also to spread
the name of An Lanntair even further.''
The Callanish Stones exhibition will feature the work of 24 artists as
well as poets like Ian Stephen and Professor Derick Thompson. Other
artists' work will include that of Ian Hamilton Finlay, Glen Onwin, Will
Maclean, and Fay Godwin.
''There will be much more than the usual pictures. As well as examples
of how the stones have been interpreted by artists in different media,
we will also be looking at their history. The various theories about
their purpose will feature strongly.''
The CD will include contributions by Phil Cunningham, Dougie Maclean,
and Artair Cormack, as well as island talent like Mary Smith and young
songstress and Machair actress Anna Murray. The jazz element will be
from Tommy Smith on sax and Martin Taylor, guitar.
After the celebrations on Lewis the Callanish Stones exhibition then
sets off to France for the Festival Interceltique, Lorient. The
300,000-visitor annual festival, the largest in France, has Scotland as
its theme this year.

Scottish painters feature impressively in a new exhibition about the
development of Impressionism.
THE large and stunning new exhibition at the Barbican Art Gallery
almost fails to work, as it is tied together by the loosest of threads:
the connections between British and French painting at the turn of the
century and the development of Impressionism here.
However, the quality of the works more than compensate for the absence
of any overt rationale, and it is the Scottish showing that is
particularly impressive.
The exhibition has been sponsored by the international investment bank
Flemings, which has an impressive collection of Scottish art, and it has
lent several paintings to the exhibition, including James Paterson's
Winter Sunshine, Moniave 1889. This is like a Whistler nocturne in its
use of soft blues and golds and the way in which oil paint has been
treated like water colour and left to spread across a damp surface.
Scottish galleries can pat themselves on the back, too, for the works
which they have lent to the exhibition are every bit as good as those
from very much larger collections. It serves as a reminder that Scottish
collectors were investing in good-quality French Impressionist works
when London galleries were rather more conservative in their taste.
The National Gallery of Scotland has lent Sisley's Molesey Weir, near
Hampton Court of 1874 which is shown alongside two little Pissarros from
the National Gallery in London and the Courtauld Institute Galleries.
Certainly the Sisley was painted three years after the other two, and is
therefore stylistically more advanced, but there is no doubt that it is
the best painting with its interest in differing textures and a delicate
mauve sky.
The Burrell's painting by Degas from the same year, The Rehearsal, is
technically advanced with the huge area of unoccupied floor right in the
centre of the composition and the ballet dancers either half obscured by
the spiral staircase or cut off by the frame of the picture. By any
yardstick it is a remarkable, powerful composition.
The strong points of the exhibition lie in the fascinating section
devoted to photography and the obvious influence the relatively new
medium took from painting to help establish ways of representing the
world. The two rooms dedicated to modern-life scenes, like Stirling
Station by the Glasgow-born William Kennedy, more than hold their own
with their Parisian antecedents, and the kilted figure in the foreground
lends local colour.
It is the room devoted to Scottish Impressionist painters, however,
that is especially interesting although Scots painters are interspersed
throughout the rest of the show too.
The works by John Lavery, Belfast-born but who worked in Glasgow,
represents British artists in France and the merits of painting in the
open with Sewing in the Shade. This is surely too large and too crisp to
have been worked entirely in front of the subject, and the use of
anecdote implied by the women's side-long glances is far from the work
of Monet or the forcefulness of Degas, but the clear palette and the
attempt to suggest sunlight dappling through the trees and reflected in
the water behind the figures suggests a technique successfully
translated to a northern climate.
Why then segregate the work of painters like James McLaughlan Nairn
(whose Auchenhew, Arran perfectly suggests the end of a summer's day
with the moon softly rising over a tranquil landscape) or William
Kennedy's Spring from Paisley Art Gallery? And in particular why hang
them on deep red walls when the rest of the exhibition is hung on
light-coloured walls? The dark colour is certainly more historically
appropriate, but leaves the impression that the Scottish works were less
modern than those produced elsewhere.
James Guthrie's Fire Light Reflections is as confident as a Degas and
his view of Oban is as dramatically composed as work by the French
Impressionists.
The interest in the pastoral preoccupied the Scottish painters. E A
Walton's The Herd Boy or E A Hornel's Pigs in a Wood may have more in
common with French Realist painters like Millet or Corot than with the
Impressionists proper, but their methods and interests are exactly those
of the New English ruralists like George Clausen's Shepherdess or Henry
Scott Tuke's The Promise depicting a serious young couple under a
spreading blossom tree. Their fine quality suggests that the Scottish
works are due a reassessment and this exhibition provides the perfect
opportunity.
* Impressionism in Britain is at Barbican Art Gallery, London, to May
7.

THE daughter of a couple killed by her obsessed former lover hugged
friends and relatives after he received two life sentences yesterday,
and said ''mum and dad can now be properly laid to rest''.
Amine Akanour, 25, a French-speaking Moroccan, was convicted on
majority verdicts by the jury of murdering teacher Mrs Janet Taylor, 46,
and her husband Dr Barry Taylor, 45, a university lecturer, at their
home in Southsea, Hampshire.
The jury was told how he killed them after their daughter Jennifer,
24, a law student -- who met him while studying in Limoges, France --
broke off their relationship.
He followed her to Britain when she returned to resume her studies at
Birmingham University.
At Winchester Crown Court, Mr Justice Collins told Akanour: ''No one
could doubt you were responsible for killing Dr and Mrs Taylor.
''It was clearly deliberately planned because of your obsession with
Jenny and your belief that the Taylors constituted an obstacle to any
relationship you might otherwise have with Jenny.
''The killings were carried out in circumstances of great brutality.
It is clear you are a real danger if you remain at large.''
Medical reports made it plain Akanour needed treatment, he added.
''It may be the Secretary of State will decide you should be
transferred to a secure hospital to receive that treatment. That is a
matter for him and not for me,'' he said.
Ms Jennifer Taylor who, with members of her family and friends,
attended most days of the trial and gave evidence against her former
lover, turned and hugged a friend after he left the dock.
In a statement issued by her solicitor, she said: ''We are very
relieved that justice has been done, and feel that mum and dad can now
be properly laid to rest. We look forward to putting our shattered lives
back together.''
Akanour, who is of no fixed address in this country, used a kitchen
knife to inflict ''appalling'' injuries to Mrs Taylor, virtually
decapitating her, the jury was told.
He left her body upside down in a broom cupboard, then killed the
family dog with a knife and hammer before waiting for mathematics
lecturer Dr Taylor to return home from Portsmouth University.
Akanour attacked him with a hammer, raining down about 20 blows. As
Akanour fled the house, Dr Taylor was left dying in the hallway near the
cupboard containing his dead wife.
The court was told that Ms Taylor met Akanour on the first night she
arrived in Limoges. Their relationship did not become sexual until much
later.
When she broke off their relationship the Moroccan, who was obsessed
with her, followed her from France to Britain.
He admitted going to the house on the day of the murders in December
1993, saying it was to speak to Mrs Taylor about an allegation that Dr
Taylor had sexually abused his daughter, an allegation she angrily
denied in evidence.
''That is outrageous and it is not true,'' she told the court.
Akanour, who denied murder, told the jury that while he was at the
house he lost feeling in his legs and feet.
He felt a ''presence'' as if someone had arrived, there was the smell
of a hospital, and that was all he remembered.
The jury was told by medical witnesses that Akanour had a personality
disorder and had been treated for depression.

WET Wet Wet make Pop Art Scot Art? So trumpets a gushy press release
which informs the Arts Diary that the Wets intend to monopolise
Scotland's artist population with the launch -- oh, how we are bating
our breaths -- of their forthcoming studio LP. Artists including Peter
Howson, Steven Campbell, Adrian Wiszniewski, and Neil MacPherson will
paint portraits of Clydebank's famous foursome which will feature as
part of the artwork for the sleeve of the new album.
This work will also be part of a special Wet Wet Wet exhibition which
is expected to travel across Europe. Artists who have agreed to
participate include Lesley Banks, John Byrne, Joyce Cairns, Joe Davie,
Stuart Duffin, Mark Gilbert, Sandy Guy, Ian Hughes, James MacDonald,
Keith McIntyre, Paul McPhail, Ron O'Donnell, June Redfern, and Ian
Scott.
The band's manager, Elliot Davis, has asserted that this project
represents ''a unique interaction between the best of Scottish art and
music,'' a statement which has caused consternation to Simon Cunningham,
the design group manager of Scottish Opera.
Cunningham huffily points out that Scottish Opera has worked closely
with Scotland's foremost artists, including Stephen Conroy, John Byrne,
and world-renowed photographer Harry Benson, for several years.
Meanwhile the Arts Diary is concerned about the artists' brief for the
Wets project, regarding the ''interpretation of tracks from the album''.
Could this lead to a serious shortage of brown paint in local art
stores?
High and mighty
FANS of the Royal SNO Chorus, who have been delighted since the
Glasgow Royal Concert Hall bought smashing new red seats for the chorus,
which allowed the chorus to come down from their heights behind the
orchestra, on to the stage, and into the realms of audibility, are set
for a dizzie.
Every choral item remaining in the season (beginning with Schnittke's
Faust Cantata this Saturday) requires such a large orchestra that the
choir will have to return to its original vertiginous seating.
One particular audience, however, is set to be more disappointed than
others: for the performance of Mahler's Second Symphony with Neeme Jarvi
the seats now to be occupied by the chorus have, in the interim, been
sold to the public. Who will sit where, and upon whose knee, is
unresolved.
Poetry of Strathclyde
POTENTIAL poets residing in the inspiring environs of Strathclyde are
being called upon to contribute to a new anthology by Anchor Books.
Glenn Jones, project editor, is looking for poems by new or established
poets who live in Strathclyde -- so, all you Shotts scribblers are out
of bounds -- on any subject.
Verse-mongers are invited to submit up to two poems, each no longer
than 30 lines, in an SAE to Anchor Books, Strathclyde Poets, 1-2 Wainman
Road, Woodston, Peterborough, PE2 7BU.
Scientology sixsome
THINGS just ain't what they used to be. Rock'n'roll was once the
province of hip-swivelling, pelvis-thrusting devilish young things --
Satan, sin, and song in an unholy trinity -- but these days it's fast
becoming an outlet for Christian proselytising.
Take Cliff Richard. Please. Now we have The Jive Aces -- ''the band
that jumps with style'' -- who play The Maltings Arts Centre in Berwick
on Saturday night.
A clean-cut, besuited sixsome from Sussex, the lads are apparently
sponsored by the publishers of L Ron Hubbard, the founder of the cult
Scientology, who also boast the squeaky clean Tom Cruise and the rather
more tarnished Michael Jackson among their members.

DAVID GREIG'S latest play for his own Suspect Culture company is a
curious, wryly funny show that dazzles and dances for an entertaining 90
minutes, only to finish almost but not quite resolved.
This is partly explained by the way the play has been put together
using a devising method in which Greig plays writer and director and
Graham Eatough plays actor and co-deviser.
Suspect Culture plans to let the production develop further over the
coming year, responding to audiences and different performances, so
challenging the conventional practice of a hard-stretched company trying
to make the most of an inflexible script.
If they succeed in their aim it will be fascinating to see how it
turns out. Inspired by the writings of the philosopher Walter Benjamin,
who thought of his life in terms of places more than events, One Way
Street is a monologue that explores the emotional resonances that
buildings, streets, and cities hold for us.
It tells the story of an English travel guide writer commissioned to
described 10 tourist walks around the former East Berlin, the script
cleverly slipping from emotionless details about cobblestones and
statues to colourful digressions about a Lancastrian childhood, street
rebellions, and key moments in a turbulent love affair.
Graham Eatough might lack the finely-measured control of a trained
actor, but there is something in the breathless conviction of his
delivery, the casual irony of his asides, and the general level of
comfort with his part that makes his performance endearing and
absorbing.
I'm not sure he taught me much about Walter Benjamin's philosophy but
he showed me enough to want to find out more.

in Dublin
A TELEPHONE call from a senior official in the Taoiseach's office in
Dublin to a counterpart in Ten Downing Street yesterday morning, helped
to avoid friction between the two Governments over a British newspaper
leak of a framework document on future political structures for Northern
Ireland.
There were also contacts between Mr Dick Spring, the Irish Deputy
Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, with Sir Patrick
Mayhew, before the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland answered
questions in the House of Commons.
Mr Shane Kenny, Irish Government spokesman, said last night that Prime
Ministers John Bruton and John Major were determined not to be deflected
by the leak, which he described as malicious in its suggestion that a
united Ireland was closer than at any time in seventy years.
This co-ordinated response by the two Governments came after the
initial shock impact of the report threatened to disrupt relations
between Dublin and London.
The basic fear was that the premature popularisation of the main
outlines of the document would create instability in Northern Ireland,
and put intolerable pressure on Mr Major to renounce the draft text.
Earlier, the Irish Republic's pavlovian distrust of ''the Brits'' had
momentarily paraded itself on the floor of the Dail, the lower House of
Parliament, when politicians from all political parties united in
denouncing the leak by ''The Thunderer'' of draft terms for a new
all-Ireland executive body.
The frantic reaction was confirmed by Mr Bruton when he claimed that
the leak damaged the entire process towards peace in Northern Ireland.
He vigorously dismissed the report as selective and as designed to alarm
Ulster Unionists.
Mr Bruton's genuine agitation was more than matched by the main
Opposition party, Fianna Fail, whose Foreign Affairs spokesman, Mr Ray
Burke, recoiled from the horror of ''national sabotage of the worst
kind'' if the source of the story proved to be Irish.
However, Mr Bruton would not countenance the suggestion that the leak
came from either his Ministers or officials.
Seizing upon a suggestion by The Times that Dublin was ''the ultimate
source'' for the story, the Irish Premier scornfully dismissed this
claim as bearing ''the hallmark of weasel-wording.''
Astonishingly, none of the Dail speakers commented on the radical
nature of the embryonic executive cross-border body, which is billed as
the biggest step towards Irish unity since the partition of the island
in 1922.
Even more remarkably, none of the details claimed as exclusive in the
British newspaper were actually new to the Dail, as similar versions
have already appeared in Irish newspapers about what is contained in the
long-awaited Framework Document being drafted by the two Governments.
The frantic tone in the Dail was conditioned not only by the report's
London dateline, but also by the aggressive editorial comment in the
front-page headline, that the ''document reveals proposals that will
alarm Ulster Unionists''.
And alarm Ulster Unionists, it did. But Dublin politicians are not
normally so easily intimidated by talk of ''No Surrender'' from Belfast.
Curiously, this time, if anything, the response in Dublin is the more
alarmist of the two cities.
The strident nature of the Dail reaction on this occasion was rooted
in an unspoken fear that Ulster Unionists have already put pressure on
an enfeebled Mr Major to put off his acceptance of this bold, innovative
experiment in Northern Ireland-Southern Irish institutional relations,
based on the model of the European Union Council of Ministers.
Mr Spring had hoped to reach politicial agreement a week ago at a
meeting in London with Sir Patrick Mayhew.
From Dublin's point of view, something went wrong at that five-hour
meeting. Agreement was not reached. Officials were asked to continue
their work. No explanation was given for the delay in completing the
document.
The private suspicion in Dublin is that Mr James Molyneaux, the leader
of the Ulster Unionists, had threatened to withdraw his party's support
for the Conservatives at Westminster if Mr Major agrees to an All
Ireland body covering agriculture, trade, education, and health.
However, the leak appears to have had the opposite effect from its
intended derailing of the talks process. There was a fresh determination
in Dublin last night to speed up the final phase of the negotiations.
Officials of the two Governments will meet in Dublin today to put the
finishing touches to the document ahead of an early meeting at
ministerial level between Mr Spring and Sir Patrick.
Last night Mr Spring appealed to Ulster Unionists and Sinn Fein to
reserve judgment until after the document is published, rather than
reacting to an article which was clearly inspired by partisan motive.
The betting is still firmly on Mr Major and Mr Bruton convening a
summit meeting to sign the document before the end of the month. It will
then be time for Northern Ireland -- both unionist and nationalist -- to
make up its mind around the conference table.

A PROACTIVE approach to development and training is what helped the
staff at the Calor Gas Grangemouth headquarters to gain an Investors in
People (IIP) Award.
Calor Gas Scotland had made a public commitment to the principles
involved in November 1993. A year later, businessman Tom Farmer, was
able to hand over the prestigious award.
He emphasised: ''Good business is all about good people. Quality
service and quality products can be achieved only if there is a quality
workforce to deliver these standards.''
In fact, action had been put in hand some time previously. Senior and
middle management underwent an extensive managing change training
programme some five years ago. This was subsequently delivered to all
staff.
The result was that the organisation could maintain its high standards
of service and safety in their traditional markets, bulk gas and
cylinder gas, while developing into newer markets of natural gas supply,
air separation systems for drinks dispensing, and refrigeration.
An important aspect was funding from Forth Valley Enterprise, in the
form of a grant for training facilities. The programme was tailored to
cover all levels of staff, to ensure an increased level of customer
satisfaction could be achieved.
The programme included transactional analysis, in other words learning
to deal with both customers and colleagues on one level. Staff went
through customer service courses/modules and were encouraged to provide
an input on the requirements for key customer service standards.
There were no doubts as to the benefits accruing from such an
intensive programme of training. In addition to an improved focus on
development, there was improved teamwork, increased morale, reduced
staff turnover, enhanced customer service, a continuing excellent safety
record, reduction in customer complaints and increased profitability.
Regional controller for Calor Gas Scotland, Jim Kearney commented:
''Our evaluation research has shown that volume has increased 5.4% since
1991, and that staff levels have dropped by 32% in the same period.
Distribution costs have also decreased as a result of better planning.
''All this, coupled with the low level of customer complaints and an
extremely low turnover in staff, is clear evidence that the IIP
programme has been a major factor in our successful business
development.''
Calor Gas has indicated that market development, into fields of
natural gas supply and air separation systems for drinks dispensing, has
dictated a need to ensure that not only are service and safety standards
of the cylinder and bulk gas markets kept to the same quality as other
company operations, but that staff are constantly in tune with new
developments and trained to deliver high standards across the board.
Jim Kearney says: ''An integral part of our business strategy lies in
the development of our people. This IIP standard has provided the
catalyst for improving our business performance, and directly reflects
the commitment and contribution our people have made to Calor Gas
Scotland.
''Our close working relationship with Forth Valley Enterprise,'' he
added, ''has helped us to achieve our training objectives, and we must
thank them for their contribution to our IIP award.''
This is by no means the only recognition Calor Gas have achieved. The
company can readily claim it has simply meant energy, to millions of
customers, since a start was made in 1935 to supplying gas. The company
is market leader in the liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) industry, and
achieved ISO 9002 registration in recognition of its quality standards.
This LPG technology, covering both propane and butane, is something in
which Calor Gas has specialised over the past 50 years, becoming not
only the longest established supplier but the largest, with a network of
dealers and stockists supplying more than 10,000 points throughout the
UK.
There are free safety checks of all company mobile heaters, old or
new, carried out by accredited dealers operating with trained staff.
Where appropriate, if a free inspection indicates a replacement heater
is needed, the company provides a part-exchange offer. And to spread the
safety message even farther, customers are encouraged to have a
pre-delivery inspection of new equipment.
The caravan and camping sector is seen as an important one, and as
part of a #2m investment in this field, Calor Gas has introduced a new
6kg gas cylinder, in response to public demand. Calor Gas has also
entered the natural gas market, supplying users ordering more than #1200
worth of gas a year. This move is seen as opening opportunities to
provide the whole of Scotland with a competitive natural gas supply,
supplied by Alliance Gas, and transmitted through the existing natural
gas mains network, at 15% below original prices for natural gas supply.
Taking all aspects into consideration, the Calor Group now has an
annual turnover in the UK of more than #300m.

Belfast
IT was the day the fears of Ulster Unionists were finally justified.
All the suspicions surfaced as the spectre of a united Ireland, or some
steps towards it, was raised before their eyes again.
Everyone knew in Northern Ireland that British and Irish civil
servants as well as Ministers had been involved in talks about
cross-border institutions for months.
The Rev Ian Paisley had been warning against any such deal, almost
from the moment Mr Major and the then Irish Premier Albert Reynolds had
stepped out of Downing Street with their peace declaration in December
1993. The Ulster Unionist leader, Mr James Molyneaux, regarded as a
trusted confidant of Mr Major during the whole peace process, had lately
rung alarm bells too.
Yesterday their fears and suspicions took on a new dimension as the
leaked words of the framework document finally sank in. At the heart of
the Unionist objections is the extent of the proposals on future
North-South co-operation, and the level of executive authority to be
given to Dublin in any such development.
In 1985, the Unionists almost to a man, opposed the Hillsborough
Agreement, claiming it granted a form of joint authority between London
and Dublin Ministers over Northern Ireland issues.
The new proposals suggest to the Unionists another form of ''joint
authority'' between the Irish parliament and a new Northern Ireland
assembly, which is expected to form part of any eventual political
settlement.
What the framework document appears to propose is that a whole range
of matters, from education to transport, from health to agriculture,
could be the responsibility of a joint body of representatives from the
Irish Dail and a Northern Assembly. What the Unionists are now objecting
to is that this proposal builds in to their future a degree of
interference from Dublin on Northern Ireland issues that they find
totally unacceptable.
In attempting to assuage such fears, the Nothern Ireland Secretary,
Sir Patrick Mayhew, and Mr Major last night on television were at pains
to emphasise nothing could be agreed or done without Unionist consent.
That does not go far enough for Mr Paisley or Mr Molyneaux, who believe
the leaked proposals lock them and Dublin to a scheme from which they
cannot escape, whether they find it unpalatable in the future or not.
What has also surprised many people in Northern Ireland is that the
matters to be covered by a new cross-border executive body are so
far-ranging. Many Unionists have already accepted that there is a need
for co-operation on issues such as agriculture and tourism. They are now
alarmed to find the British and Irish Governments are discussing
''harmonisation'' of education and health across the island, even though
these matters are dealt with in distinctly different ways north and
south of the border.
For Mr Paisley and his party yesterday's events were a political
godsend. The Democratic Unionists have appeared out on a limb throughout
the peace process, their warnings sounding hollow, as even the hard-line
loyalist paramilitary groups adopted a more moderate stance. Now Mr
Paisley is saying: ''I told you so,'' to the North's Protestants, and
overnight it seemed as if more were already listening to him.
For Mr Molyneaux, the leaked report would have been politically
disastrous had he not had the foresight a couple of weeks ago to warn
that British and Irish civil servants were cooking up a plan he could
not accept.
Mr Molyneaux has carefully side-stepped direct criticism of the Prime
Minister by placing the blame for what is happening on faceless
officials and saying there is still time for Mr Major to see the light
and reject the cross-border deal.
As the Prime Minister went on television last night, he was
unfortunately speaking to many in Northern Ireland who, as Mr Molyneaux
said, had made up their minds by six o'clock. The effect of the report
was to unnerve his followers to such an extent that the framework
document now appears blackened beyond rescue.
To Mr William Ross, another leading Unionist MP, the document ''is
dead''. To Mr David Trimble, one of Mr Molyneaux's closest lieutenants,
the proposals meant his party could withdraw support from the Government
and bring it down.
The nationalist community, however, took a different line, encouraged
no doubt by the reports of closer co-operation with the South, but were
concerned by reaction to the leak. Mr John Hume, the SDLP leader, said:
''Words are becoming the enemies of peace in our society.'' The Sinn
Fein spokesman, Mr Martin McGuinness, admitted the leaks had ''done no
favours for the peace process''.
Despite the Unionist rage, the hardline loyalist reaction was
curiously low key. Mr David Ervine, leader of the small Progressive
Unionist Party, known to have close links with the outlawed Ulster
Volunteer Force, warned against ''a knee-jerk reaction''.
He said his party would reserve its judgment until the entire
framework document was published and called on the governments to do so
as soon as possible. That was also the reaction of Mr Gary McMichael,
another leading loyalist. But he warned that the leaked proposals would
be rejected.
Given the Unionist reaction, it was difficult to see where London and
Dublin could go from here. While some observers believed yesterday's
leak might speed up publication of the framework document, others felt
the whole process would now need more consultation and possible changes.
Whatever the approach, Mr Major's task of finding a lasting settlement
in Northern Ireland now appears much more difficult.

Shepperton Studios is back in the big picture. Its purchase by the
Scott brothers, reports Allan Laing, promises a much-needed lift for the
British film industry
IN a move which could at last signal a significant revival in the
fortunes of the ailing British film industry, movie directors Ridley and
Tony Scott have secured the purchase of the legendary Shepperton Studios
in Surrey for #12m. The brothers from South Shields, who between them
have made some of the most successful Hollywood movies of the past
decade, intend to create ''an environment which understands the needs of
film makers everywhere''.
They want Shepperton to be regarded by directors and movie companies
alike as one of the world's great production centres. And, to do that,
they are prepared to inject a further #10m over the next five years to
upgrade the studios. It is very serious money.
The Scotts, who took an option to buy Shepperton three months ago,
secured a financial package with the City-based Candover Partners,
specialists in management buy-outs. Candover is understood to have
invested half of the #12m. The remainder came from the Scotts
themselves, the existing management at Shepperton, and the
Hollywood-based Intermedia Company.
After the deal was finally signed in London last night, both brothers
deliberately made themselves unavailable for comment. Only Ridley spoke
briefly. He said: ''I'm very pleased to confirm that we shall be
continuing with the studios' first-class management team. We have been
working together on our plans to expand the facilities and I look
forward to announcing details later this month.''
A spokesman for the brothers said that, although they had specific
plans for the studios' expansion and for bringing in major productions
from the US, they did not want to disclose details until everything was
in place.
''They will make an announcement, probably in London and LA, within
the next few weeks about how the extra #10m will be spent,'' he said.
It is understood that one of the Scotts' priorities is to increase the
studios' share of post-production business. They are unhappy at a
situation whereby directors who make movies at Shepperton then have to
go elsewhere -- usually America -- for the final phase. Revenue from
post-production work is particularly high.
The studios, which have had their financial hard times in the past,
have enjoyed a dramatic improvement in both revenue and profit over the
past five years. This was partly due to a small but steady flow of
feature films but it had more to do with the increasing demand for pop
videos and television adverts. Currently the order book is healthy,
though mostly with television commercials.
The Scotts are planning to use their Hollywood clout to persuade
American film makers to ignore the fact that the British Government
doesn't offer tax breaks and work at Shepperton. Britain, after all, is
generally recognised as having the finest technicians in the
international movie industry.
Perhaps more important, however, the Scotts are keen to encourage more
British investment in home-produced films, something which has been
sadly lacking over the past 10 years.
If anyone can persuade Hollywood to come to Surrey then it must be
Ridley and Tony Scott. They are both highly astute businessmen, having
run their own successful production companies for years. In addition,
they are arguably Britain's most sought-after film directors. They cut
their teeth -- and made names for themselves in the process -- by
producing up-market television adverts in the seventies. (It was Ridley
who introduced the boy-on-the-bike Hovis ads and Tony who started the
Levi commercials).
Ridley's first movie, The Duellists, won the best newcomer award at
Cannes in 1977. But his career really took off with the slick sci-fi
horror film, Alien. The stylish futuristic thriller Blade Runner,
starring Harrison Ford, followed to critical and box office success.
Other films he has directed have included Legend, Black Rain, and
Someone To Watch Over Me.
The Oscar-winning Thelma &amp; Louise, made two years ago, is generally
recognised as his best movie. Ridley, aged 56 (a year younger than the
Shepperton itself), is currently so hot that he could cook a Pop Tart in
his pocket. He has the rare distinction in Hollywood of being
sufficiently successful to pick and choose what he wants to direct. Now,
it seems, he will be making his decisions from the banks of the Thames
in West London.
Tony, aged 51, has a reputation for creating brash, loud, populist
movies for the youth market. These include Top Gun, Days of Thunder,
Beverly Hills Cop II, Revenge, and True Romance. He too can write his
own pay cheque in Hollywood.
Nigel Sinclair, a senior member of the management team at Intermedia
(described as a Hollywood ''deal-making'' company led by a team of
British lawyers), commented: ''This is a cutting-edge deal. British film
makers who have achieved top success in Hollywood are bringing their
expertise back to the UK's most venerable studio.
''We're especially proud that we raised the money here in the UK, in
the City, with top UK venture capital specialists.''
Shepperton, one of only two major studios left in the UK (the other is
Pinewood), was founded in 1936. Its 17 sound stages have been availed
upon by such cinematic luminaries as Alexander Korda and the Boulting
Brothers. The great John Ford stalked its  corridors when he was making
The African Queen. Some of the great British films of the past 50 years
have been made there. Its list of some 600 movies include classics like
The Third Man, Colditz, The Guns of Navarone, Dr Strangelove, and the
hit musical Oliver!.
Through the 1950s and 1960s, it was renowned as the centre for British
comedy films, at that time one of the most popular, profitable, and
prolific cinema genres.
More recently, Shepperton was used to make David Lean's Passage To
India, Kenneth Branagh's version of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and, of
course, the box-office hit of 1994, Four Weddings and a Funeral. Work
was completed last month on Danny Cannon's #40m budget Judge Dredd,
starring Sylvester Stallone.

A JUDGE has ruled that three East European factory fishing ships,
anchored off Ullapool, are not to be moved.
The Bulgarian vessels, the Kaprela, the Ofelia and the Afala, arrived
in Loch Broom last October but within days a Government marine safety
officer issued orders detaining them as unfit to go to sea without
endangering human life.
The Department of Transport's Marine Safety Agency decided the vessels
should be detained within a line crossing Loch Broom, close to Ullapool,
but the harbour master believed the vessels would be more safely
anchored at Annat Bay, several miles away, within the harbour. Marine
safety officers disputed the harbour master's view.
Ullapool Harbour Trustees went to the Court of Session in Edinburgh
for a judicial review of the orders made on behalf of the Secretary of
State for Transport.
But Lord Milligan dismissed their challenge and said in a written
judgment, issued yesterday, he accepted that a marine safety officer
could competently prohibit an unsafe vessel from going beyond the
detention line.
The judge said that both sides accepted that there was a gap in the
law applying to the case and that further legislation might be required
the clarify the position.
However, the judge said he accepted that the Marine Safety Agency's
detention line ''is more consistent with the presumed legislative
intention to be taking efficient safety measures to stop unsafe vessels
going to sea''.

IN an ideal world the leaked document would have been seen by everyone
concerned as a sensible way of suggesting how to proceed with the
problem which has bedevilled British history for centuries -- how to
cope with Ireland. In an ideal world the leak might have been helpful.
But this is not an ideal world and prejudice, not common sense, has
played the greater part in anything to do with Ireland. Scots in general
may be tepid about the Union -- the days when 'Conservative and
Unionist' was a redundant description have gone -- but the Ulster
Unionists stand by the Union four square.
They know only too well that in any United Ireland they would be a
minority group. Better the power of the kailyard than that; better the
resources of the British Treasury to bail one out of trouble than those
of the Finance Ministry in Dublin.
The leak has upset the delicate balance of the negotiations and been
exploited to the full by those implacably opposed to any change in the
status quo.
It is important, therefore, to remember that, like all leaks, it was a
selective leak and that what was leaked is still only a discussion
document. The Times did not publish a 23-page 56-clause agreed policy
document.
It remains a discussion document after the two Governments publish it
because then the people of Northern Ireland have to look at it.
However, there was no denial by British or Irish ministers of the
accuracy of what was disclosed so clearly the proposals that have been
revealed are the nub of the matter.
* How would the plan work?
The proposed Joint North-South Irish Authority is perfectly practical
-- in theory. The flaw is a political one. The Ulster Unionists have
decided in advance of seeing the document that they will have none of
it.
The point is, however, that the plan has still to be agreed by the two
Governments in London and Belfast. The document, the work of civil
servants, may be almost what the politicians are about to endorse, but
will even then not be finally agreed. the next step is for Northern
Ireland's politicians to get it to discuss and amend. Only then will the
final text be put to the people of Ulster in a referendum. Parliament
and the Dail will also get their chances to pass judgement.
Given that the form of the new authority remains undecided, on the
basis of what is now known it would be made up of senior politicians,
the heads of departments of the Irish Government and the devolved Ulster
administrative assembly, assisted by the appropriate civil servants. The
balance between the two parts would presumably be equal, which would
give the Ulster representatives greater muscle than they would be
entitled to on a population basis.
The big advantage for them is that, as elected representatives, they
would be fighting their own corner, rather than leaving it to the
British Government.
* The body would have ''radical executive powers'' and deal with
Brussels on behalf of both Eire and Northern Ireland.
The European Union is a source of many benefits to its poorer regions,
and there would appear to be sense in creating a body which would ensure
that Ireland negotiated with the Commission as a whole, rather than as
two parts with different degrees of clout. That way schemes common to
both parts of the island could be established, conflicting schemes
avoided, and EU aid would end up being spent more economically and
arguably to better effect.
In 1993 the Republic received more than #2b of EU money. Eire is an
object lesson in how EU aid can be spent to the benefit of a community
as a whole. There is no secret about how it has been spent. The benefits
are everywhere to be seen as any visitor can testify. Northern Ireland
also benefits. It received #240m recently to help in the peace process,
and by the end of the century will have had another #1b from Brussels.
Given the sums involved there are clear advantages to be gained from a
unified approach. The whole lobbying process, essential if a persuasive
case for aid is to be put to the Brussels paymasters, could be combined,
which ought to make it more effective because it would avoid
counter-productive arguments.
And Eire plus Ulster arguing a case for Ulster ought to be more
effective than a Northern Ireland Secretary arguing the case because it
is a larger unit.
The document says the body should be ''dynamic, enabling progressive
extension of its functions to new areas.''
On the basis of one step at a time, there is no reason why it should
not be able to function effectively in relation to Europe, which would
be one step, or to deal with areas like the island's transport system,
which would be a second step. Other steps are obvious -- common
aproaches to the social services, to health provision, to education, and
agricultural support.
The document clearly hopes other areas in which an all Ireland
approach would be of mutual benefit can be agreed. It says that the new
body would assume ''immediate executive responsibility for sectors
involving a natural, physical all-Ireland framework.'' That could mean
common policies on roads, rail transport, airports and sea ports --
support systems for society in other words.
Clearly such a body could be the first step on the road to a United
Ireland, but that road is a long one. It is a journey which can only be
completed if the people of Northern Ireland wish that to happen. The
principle of consent enshrined in the Downing Street Declaration remains
the political equivalent of Holy Writ, and the dilemma for Northern
Ireland is whether taking a tentative step down the road means
inevitably having to go the whole way down it.
The body would consist of democratically elected political
representatives from the two countries and is not some quango. So there
would be political control over it from the Dail and the new Northern
Ireland Assembly. The trouble, as the European Parliament has shown, is
that any body created to carry out this sort of job will, as it gains
experience, seek to expand the perimeters of that job.
* The constitutional aspects.
Britain will either amend or replace the Government of Ireland Act
1920, which gave Ireland two parliaments, one for the six counties, one
for Southern Ireland, with limited powers. The changes will ensure that
British legislation reflects the new approach to Northern Ireland. In
return, the Republic will change its constitution so that no territorial
claim to Northern Ireland contrary to the will of its people is
asserted. Eire's written constitution has always been a stumbling block
to unification. This change would remove one major obstacle.
Northern Ireland's MPs would be able to play their part in the process
of changing this legislation at Westminster, and while they would not be
able to amend anything in their own right -- they do not have the
numbers for that -- they would be able to deploy their case for or
against whatever is proposed. Whatever secrecy may shroud negotiations,
there is nothing secret about the Westminster legislative process.
The document also pledged the British Government would do nothing to
prejudice the freedom of the people of Northern Ireland to determine by
peaceful democratic means its future constitutional status, whether as
part of the United Kingdom or in forming a part of a united Ireland.
* Nationality.
It contains an assertion that everyone born in either jurisdiction is
part of the Irish nation, and makes clear that Britain will be rigorous
in its impartiality in its rule over the Province and will ensure that
the freedom of the people of Northern Ireland to determine by peaceful
democratic means its future constitutional status, whether as part of
the United Kingdom or a United Ireland, is not prejudiced. This is meant
to be the guarantee which enshrines the Downing Street Declaration.

WORK began yesterday on building a #1.5m hotel which will offer
budget-price accommodation in Glasgow.
The 42-bedroom Granada Lodge is being built beside Harry Ramsden's
fish restaurant in Paisley Road, next to the M8 on the south bank of the
Kingston Bridge.
Councillor Pat Lally, leader of Glasgow District Council, turned the
first sod yesterday to signal the start of the project, which should be
completed by August.
Mr John Morrison, operations director of Granada Hospitality, said
there was a strong demand for budget accommodation in Glasgow. By
providing ''a three-star bedroom at a one-star price'', the hotel would
enable a family of four to stay within striking distance of the city
centre for under #40 per night.
Meanwhile, the developers of a similar but larger venture in Glasgow
announced that it will be open for business next month.
The #4.8m Charing Cross Tower Hotel in the city centre is the
brainchild of property development company Surveylink Projects Ltd and
is being built by an all-Scottish team.
Mr Eric Barlow, general manager of the 275-bedroom hotel, said: ''We
intend that our highly-competitive rate of #38.50 per room per night
will set the benchmark in the city for quality, service and value for
money in this exciting new market sector.''

HOSPITALS are fast becoming dangerous places to be ill. The
smokescreens of NHS reorganisation and the search for ''new roles'' for
doctors do not disguise the fact that there are effectively fewer
doctors to deal with an increasing number of patients.
Since I joined medical school 20 years ago ''cutbacks'' has been an
enduringly popular catch-phrase -- an easy punchline as medical staff
and others watched some genuine slack in the system being tightened up.
Now it is different. Now I go about my daily business knowing that the
medical division of my hospital, like so many others, is seriously
undermanned. Knowing that inpatients may not receive the care they
require. Everyone has an NHS anecdote to tell, from the most serious to
the trivial, from dying patients to vanishing pillowslips, but these
could happen anywhere, anytime. The real worry is the atmosphere of
humbug which surrounds the manoeuvrings in the health service. The
pretence that everything is for the best, while the NHS staggers like
some latter-day Candide from one self-inflicted disaster to the next.
A facade of improved efficiency has been erected, an illusion of
consultation with interested and knowledgeable groups, while a
politically motivated set of market forces have been foisted on an
inappropriate organisation. A ''patients' charter'' is similarly
introduced -- outlining an arbitrary selection of promises and
undertakings with active encouragement to patients (''customers'') to
complain if these are not delivered. Their complaints are, of course,
directed at workers who never made the promises in the first place, were
never consulted about their importance or feasibility, and were given no
help to deliver them.
The most worrying facade, however, is that the reduction of junior
doctors' hours has simultaneously improved patient care and doctors'
conditions. A particular disappointment is the way the BMA -- ''the
doctors' union'' -- almost seemed to conspire with the Government in
making things more dangerous for the patient. One has to assume this was
not their intention. There was great support among the British people
for their campaign to reduce juniors' hours. Clearly it was potentially
dangerous for doctors to work all day, all night, then all the next day.
The BMA went for it in a big way. They had the Government over a barrel
-- a chance for a rare victory. What a triumph! What an achievement!
What naivety! In pursuing shorter hours, they lost sight of almost
everything else.
A cynical onlooker might even say they played into the Government's
hands. What happens? The Government concedes. Hospitals are given new
guidelines over doctors' hours. Hospitals are given deadlines by which
these new guidelines must be reached. What hospitals are not given is a
deluge of extra doctors to make up the shortfall. A system which only
functioned because staff were working huge numbers of hours would now be
saved by stopping them doing those extra hours. Interesting mathematics.
The same number of doctors are looking after the same -- in fact,
constantly rising -- number of patients but during fewer hours. Each
doctor, therefore, has to fit the same amount of work into a shorter
time.
This makes things safer?
Junior House Officers (JHOs) now cover other doctors' wards to a
ridiculous extent. Many hospitals have been forced to introduce shift
systems to keep within the guidelines. The doctor seeing you when you
arrive at hospital will almost certainly not be the doctor looking after
you eight hours later, with a further change due the next day. Each of
these doctors, instead of having you as one of his 30 patients, will
also be looking after another 60 elsewhere in the hospital. It would
appear that having a good night's sleep enables doctors to be in three
places at one time.
Once we establish that the JHO is no longer responsible for his own
ward -- as he busily runs round filling forms and injecting patients he
has never seen before -- the burden falls on the Senior House Office
(SHO) to keep track of day-to-day needs of the patients. This is
unfortunate, since in the past he would have had time to perform a more
critical and supervisory role in the patients' management. This function
now falls more directly on the less-supported consultant, who has
patients scattered over the hospital and usually runs a specialist
inpatient and outpatient service along with his general medical duties.
Meantime, he incurs an increasing administrative load of letter-writing,
form-filling and protocol-devising, much of which is designed to shore
up the facade of improved efficiency while achieving the opposite.
Simple mathematics again. Between 1981 and 1994 the medical unit of my
own hospital has increased emergency admissions by 120%. During the same
time, the number of doctors has increased by 12%. Allowing for the
reduction in juniors' hours (average of 40%) there are fewer doctors
available at any one time in the hospital for an increased patient load.
Only one ''middle grade'' is on call overnight for all new heart
attacks, strokes, pneumonias, overdoses, asthmatics, chest pains, etc
who arrive as emergencies. The SHO also looks after all the medical
patients already in the hospital.
Is this how an efficient organisation keeps up with an increasing
workload? Reduce staff, but increase propaganda? Of course, during this
time, administrative staff have increased up to threefold -- but who do
you really want to see if you're ill?

Anne Johnstone reports how Accident and Emergency Departments in
Scottish hospitals are going through an emergency of their own because
of a shortage of junior doctors
APOLICEMAN injured in the chest during a training exercise; a
62-year-old lady with a fractured wrist after slipping on ice; a
43-year-old man with a panic attack; a 20-year-old girl with an
overdose; a 30-year-old drug user with a suspected thrombosis; a sobbing
five-year-old boy with a large bloody gash on his forehead -- and in the
midst of them all there's a homeless alcoholic called Jimmy, a Royal
regular. Today Jimmy has a pain in his tummy. The nurses are smiling.
The doctors are cracking weak jokes.
Just another day at Glasgow Royal Infirmary's Accident and Emergency
Department, the busiest unit of its kind in Scotland with more 80,000
patients a year. What the patients don't know is that this and nearly
every other A and E department in Britain is facing its own emergency.
It's not an emergency about funding but about staffing. Junior doctors
form the backbone of the service. Until 30 years ago they ran casualty
departments virtually without supervision. These days there are a few
consultants on hand to keep an eye on things and help in complex cases
but most patients won't get to see them. Instead they will be seen by
one of a team of Senior House Officers, junior doctors employed on
six-month contracts to do 56-hour shifts.
Five years ago the Royal routinely received 90 applications for its 12
SHO jobs. This year they didn't receive enough applicants to fill the
posts and only managed to scrape together their dozen after
readvertising and trawling in Europe. Most of Scotland's score of
Accident and Emergency Departments were at least one SHO short when
contacted by the Herald yesterday.
* In Glasgow the worst situation is at the Royal Hospital for Sick
Children, Yorkhill, where the trust is four short. The Southern General
is one short and so is Stobhill.
* Law Hospital at Carluke in Lanarkshire, which has filled only two of
its eight SHO posts, has only averted the closure of its Accident and
Emergency Unit by appealing to local GPs to do locum sessions. A
spokeswoman said they had managed to fill the staff rota until the end
of the month. It is unclear what will happen after that.
* Tayside Health Board is considering closing casualty facilities at
either Arbroath or Stracathro unless more junior doctors or locums can
be recruited.
* In last week's recruitment section of the British Medical Journal
more than 70 SHO posts were still being advertised for jobs due to start
yesterday. They included Kirkcaldy Acute Hospitals, Crosshouse in
Kilmarnock, Perth Royal Infirmary, Dumfries and Galloway Royal
Infirmary, Falkirk and District Royal Infirmary, Law, Caithness General,
the Vale of Leven in Balloch, Monklands Hospital in Airdrie and Raigmore
Hospital in Inverness. Until last week Crosshouse was eight doctors
short. It is still looking for two more.
* To avoid closure some A and E departments south of the Border appear
prepared to go to extraordinary lengths. Peterborough District Hospital,
whose catchment area includes part of Prime minister John Major's
Huntingdon constituency, is offering local GPs and any other suitably
qualified doctors #50 an hour to take on a nine-hour shift.
''The situation is horrendous,'' said Dr Noelle Murphy, the consultant
in charge of A and E at Raigmore in Inverness. Mr James Stevenson, at
Crosshouse said: ''We're just about scraping by this week. We'll know by
Saturday whether we'll have enough staff to keep going.''
What does this crisis mean for patients? Life-or-death emergencies
will receive the same service as usual. The losers will be the walking
wounded. They are likely to wait longer to see a doctor. Secondly, at
some hospitals, such as Law, patients are being advised not to come to
the hospital at all unless they are sure their condition can't be dealt
with by their GP. Thirdly, patients with minor conditions are more
likely to be treated by a nurse than a doctor.
Why has the crisis loomed so suddenly? It has always been more
difficult to fill the posts in February than August (the start of the
contract periods) on account of the large proportion of newly graduated
medical students who take up 12-month contracts in August. But in
previous years there has been a reasonable balance between supply and
demand.
The biggest fly in the ointment is the Government's promise on the
hours worked by junior doctors. For those working a full shift system in
Accident and Emergency this means a 56-hour week. Consequently many
departments are having to take on more doctors simply to cover the same
number of shifts. The Government claims it is increasing the numbers of
doctors to cope with the reform but it appears that the numbers
graduating from medical schools still aren't sufficient to meet the new
demand.
The situation has been aggravated by offers of lucrative short-term
contracts in North American hospitals and to some extent by the
tightening of Britain's immigration laws since 1985. The number of
junior doctors coming to the UK from the Indian sub-continent has been
declining.
On top of this, accident and emergency medicine is still an expanding
speciality. Many hospitals which had no casualty service 10 years ago
now offer one and rather than spreading the same number of casualties
around more hospitals this trend has led to an increase in the numbers
of patients presenting themselves for treatment.
Lastly, since early last year there has been no requirement for junior
doctors to do a stint in A and E if they wish to qualify as consultants.
Because it is difficult work and involves unsocial hours, some have
opted not to.
In the past, temporary or regional shortages of SHOs were made up by
employing locums. According to Simon Faulkner, managing director of the
recruitment agency Professional Locum Services, many doctors who used to
go from one short contract to another have recently taken staff jobs.
''We have only half the locums on our books compared with a year ago,''
he said. His company has also received approaches from hospitals for 126
SHOs, all meant to start work yesterday. They were able to supply only
about 20.
The staffing crisis and the way it is being handled has important
implications for the future of the entire health service. First, it
raises clear concerns about the quality of those being accepted. Though
all the hospitals approached by The Herald yesterday insisted they had
not taken on anyone they thought unfit to do the job, many weren't in
any position to be particular.
More fundamentally, there is likely to be concern in some quarters
about the future of collective bargaining in the NHS when some trusts
can offer four or five times the going rate for the job to locums in
order to keep their A and E departments open.
In the medium term the staffing situation is bound to increase
pressure for the closure of a number of A and E departments. Many
consultants in Glasgow have long argued for the rationalisation of
Accident and Emergency provision on three sites, instead of the current
five. Yesterday, Dr Harry Burns, director of public health for Greater
Glasgow Health Board, said that closing an A and E department was
tantamount to ''closing a hospital's front door'' and he did not
envisage that happening. But he admitted that the staffing situation was
very worrying.
At present the board is exploring an alternative strategy. This would
involve the creation of one Major Trauma Centre for the entire city, to
deal with the most serious cases, probably fewer than 1000 a year.
On the face of it this is an attractive option. It would involve
bringing together on one site specialists in several key areas of
medicine such as burns, neurosurgery and cardio-vascular surgery and
maximise the chances of survival for seriously injured patients in that
vital ''golden hour'' after their accident.
The idea has not gone down well with consultants. Traditionally these
specialties have been spread around the city.
The second major proposal, which could have a far bigger impact on the
whole concept of an Accident and Emergency service is Primary Care
Emergency Centres. It has long been argued that a large proportion of
patients attending A and E departments could be adequately treated by
their own GPs.
Pilot schemes for this version of care in the community could be up
and running within a year. Meanwhile, queues in casualty are set to
lengthen.
* BT chairman Sir Iain Vallance, who claimed it might be ''relaxing''
to be a junior doctor, was today challenged to do the job for a week.
Sir Iain provoked fury in the medical profession with the remark to a
Commons select committee investigating executive pay.
He insisted his comment was not meant to be taken seriously. However,
Dr Andrew Carney, chairman of the British Medical Association's Junior
Doctors Committee, issued the challenge to Sir Iain.
He said: ''If Sir Iain believes that a junior doctor's job might be
relaxing, then he can come and work for a week as a junior doctor.
''On my calculations, a house officer earns in a year what Sir Iain
earns in about 10 days. I see that Sir Iain has listed hill walking as
one of his recreations -- most junior doctors have just one recreation
called sleep.''
''The pressures of working in a corporate boardroom are, I am sure,
great but no-one can understand the pressures of being a junior doctor
in today's NHS without working as a junior doctor.
''Many of my colleagues still work continuous shifts of up to 24 or 36
hours with hardly a break, making difficult decisions throughout about
the health and sometimes the lives of patients.''
A WORKING DAY IN LIFE OF SIR IAIN VALLANCE
The working day of BT chief Sir Iain Vallance is typically long but

ONE of Scotland's top ensembles was given a new look yesterday
courtesy of a postgraduate student from Edinburgh College of Art.
Alison Mitchell, 22, from Fife, had been commissioned to produce a new
collection of outfits for the BT Scottish Ensemble.
She was asked to reflect both the traditional and contemporary
elements of the ensemble's work to create a design that was ''dramatic
and practical''.
It took her 700 work-hours of drawing, snipping, and stitching to
complete the outfits for the musicians.
The BT ensemble modelled their new outfits yesterday with the female
musicians sporting individual ones. They all share a common theme, using
black Lycra body-stockings under simple sleeveless black dresses, with
complex, historically-accurate print details.
The men were dressed in black evening-style suits over shot-silk
shirts in bright colours.
The colours were chosen to reflect the myriad of shades in the rich
baroque coloured outfit for the ensemble's artistic director Clio Gould.
The men's outfits are enhanced with cummerbunds for evening concerts and
braces for daytime performances.
''Musicians need total freedom of movement and absolute comfort. The
challenge was to come up with a design striking to the eye,'' Ms
Mitchell said.
She is studying for a Masters degree in theatre costume design and
will leave shortly for a working trip to New Orleans and Rio de Janeiro
to study carnival costumes.

<TEXT>
A PART-time footballer, being sued for #20,000 for an allegedly
reckless tackle, has been given a second chance to state his version of
events.
The damages were awarded against Stanraer midfielder Steven Cody, 25,
at Alloa Sheriff Court in December, but yesterday at Stirling, Sheriff
Principal John Maguire ordered them to be wiped out, giving Cody a fresh
chance to fight the case.
The case will now be referred back to Alloa Sheriff Court.
After yesterday's hearing Cody's solicitor, Mr James McDonald, said
his client had not been covered by his club's insurance, and would be
forced to sell his house if he lost.
He added: ''If this is allowed, it has implications for the whole game
-- football will have to become a non-contact sport.''
Cody is being sued jointly with the Stranraer club and two Stranraer
officials.
He will be opposing Hendry's claim that the tackle had ended his
professional football career.
His advocate, Mr James Kennedy, told the court that Cody would argue
the #20,000 sought was excessive, and that Hendry had been guilty of
contributory negligence.
The court was told that Cody, who supplements a student grant with his
part-time wages of #100 a week from Stranraer, faced difficulty paying
for his defence, and had applied for legal aid.
In the court record, Hendry alleges Cody was sent off for ''serious
foul play'' after a late and reckless tackle at the Alloa Athletic
ground on September 11, 1993.
Hendry claims the tackle left him with a compound fracture to his
right ankle. He says he now walks with a noticeable limp, and alleges
the incident lost him earnings of some #1500 and lost him a new contract
with Alloa which would have brought him a signing-on fee of #2000.
In defences now lodged, Cody claims the ball had run away from Hendry,
and both went for it in the course of a normal tackle.
He argues that in any event, Hendry had risked injury voluntarily, by
taking part in the game.

<HEADLINE>Transport policy vital for export levels, says CBI</HEADLINE>

SCOTLAND'S hopes of prosperity following record exports will die
unless the Government comes up with a transport policy and provides much
needed investment in roads and rail, the Confederation of British
Industry warned yesterday.
Its critical report on transport links within the UK, let alone those
to the Continent or further afield, catalogues a history of neglect on
transport links and a failure to spend on infrastructure.
The report also sets out a framework for integrated road, rail, and
air networks that would encourage rather than stifle economic growth.
But many business people have lost confidence in the Government's
ability to produce a visionary system that could support UK
competitiveness while meeting environmental concerns, according to the
director-general of the CBI, Mr Howard Davies.
He said that France, Germany and the Netherlands were better at
reconciling the industrial and environmental issues, and businesses
abroad were happier with their transport systems.
At a separate Scottish launch of the report, Missing Links: Settling
National Transport Priorities, Mr John Russell, who heads a CBI working
group on needs north of the Border, said the Government must come up
with a vision of how transport policy would meet objectives over the
next 20 years.
He said: ''If it does not, we have no prosperity to look forward to in
Scotland. We are an exporting nation which could overcome disadvantages
caused by distances from market with good transport links to Europe in
particular.''
CBI Scotland director Lex Gold said it was vital the Government
produced a Green Paper on long-term transport strategy. Chairman John
Ward spelled out criticisms:
* Roads are among the most congested in Europe, likely to worsen as
traffic levels increase. Investment, about 20% less than in France and
Germany, is too low.
* The rail network is ageing, with failures to upgrade hampering
attempts to boost passenger or freight business. Investment, at best, is
just 30% of amounts spent in Holland, Germany, and France.
* Most UK trade by volume passes through ports, yet the merchant
fleet's average age is higher than the rest of the world. The types of
vessels used out of Scottish ports are such that it is often more
economical to export from English ports.
* Restrictive legislation even prevents Scottish cargo going on planes
which have landed from the US or Far East before carrying on to
Continental destinations.
The report showed that while the UK has a ''good record'' in the
efficient provision of transport services, the quality of infrastructure
compares badly with that of France, Germany and Holland.
The CBI wants the Government to identify the level of public or
private sector funding needed to achieve a ''sound transport
infrastructure essential to enable business to compete effectively.''
Mr Davies said: ''Other countries not only spend more, they also seem
better able to take long-term decisions and stick with them. A long
history of comparative neglect leaves us at a competitive disadvantage.
We must catch up quickly, but in ways which are sensitive to
environmental needs.''
Mr Russell was adamant Scotland's access to markets had suffered
because of wrangles over investment, with spending on roads seen to hit
rail, or spending on rail viewed at the expense of new roads.
He said the Government must produce an approach in which different
types of transport worked together to meet the wider need of encouraging
economic development.
Main transport corridors -- road, rail, or air -- had to be
identified, then enhanced because the time for piecemeal expansion was
over.
He argued more Government investment was needed for all forms of
transport, regardless of moves to encourage private sector funding.
Scotland's exports are at record levels, up 14.7% and worth #11.5bn in
the year to March.

<HEADLINE>HCI clinches patient deal with Fife board as take-over looms</HEADLINE>

WITH a take-over by Middle-East backers believed to be days away, the
private HCI hospital in Clydebank yesterday clinched a deal to treat up
to 160 NHS patients referred by Fife Health Board.
The hospital, which went into receivership in November, five months
after opening, is to offer out-patient orthopaedic treatment for
patients who have been waiting beyond the board's 15-week waiting time
guarantee.
There is the provision in the contract for follow-up in-patient care
for those who require it, including accommodation in the HCI hotel for
an accompanying friend or relative.
Funds to meet the cost of the scheme and other waiting list
initiatives were received by the Fife board from the Scottish Office
late last year.
Board general manager Pat Frost said: ''The NHS Trusts in Kirkcaldy
and Dunfermline have highlighted difficulties in meeting the waiting
times for orthopaedic out-patient appointments.
''Fife Health Board is working with the trusts to address these
through a programme of investment and the expansion of orthopaedic
services, which includes recruiting additional consultants and will
result in a better local service for Fife.''
She said that, to meet the more immediate problem, the board and the
local trusts had now agreed that patients who have not been seen within
the waiting times guaranteed should be offered treatment from
alternative providers.
The board had made it clear that its first responsibility was to
identify the most effective means of treating local people within the
guaranteed waiting times.
''The contract with HCI will not only enable immediate treatment for
those people waiting beyond those guaranteed waiting times, but will
also reduce the pressure on the existing service.''
The contract immediately provoked more of the controversy that has
stalked the #160m hospital since its inception with the objective of
flying in overseas patients for treatment.
Mr Menzies Campbell, QC, the Liberal Democrat MP for North-East Fife,
said: ''Obviously I am delighted for anyone living in North-east Fife
who may have the opportunity of an early operation, but I think it is
scandalous that those resources are not available within Fife itself.
''The money which the Scottish Office has poured into HCI with no
guarantee for its continued operation could have been used throughout
Scotland and in Fife to provide the standard of care which people are
entitled to expect from the NHS.''
This was echoed by Labour's Scottish health spokesman, Mr John
McAllion, who said: ''The NHS is being asked to act as a life-support
system for HCI. People are going there because of insufficient provision
in the NHS. This breaks all the promises we were given.''
HCI's most recent NHS contracts up to now have been with Lothian and
Borders Health Boards to carry out heart operations on up to 40
patients.
Lothian has so far taken up 14 of the 30 operations on which they had
an option, including a number of coronary artery by-passes -- normally
funded centrally by the NHS Management Executive for Scotland.
A Lothian Health Board spokesman said the HCI operations were over and
above the 3130 by-passes the executive has bought this year, and were
intended to fulfil their local waiting-time guarantee of 10 months --
two months less than the national guarantee.
Their local provider, Edinburgh Royal Infirmary Trust, was already
working to capacity, and the board had the consent of the executive to
look elsewhere.
Both the Glasgow Royal and Western Infirmary Trusts, which between
them perform nearly 2000 a year, confirmed to The Herald that they too
were working to capacity. The other centre, Aberdeen Royal, does 430,
mainly from the Grampian area.
The expected rescue of HCI by the Abu Dhabi Investment Company has
also raised fears that, when reponsibility for purchasing by-pass
surgery, accompanied by a share of the allocation, is devolved to
individual health boards from April, they may be more inclined to seek
whatever bargain prices are still on offer at HCI.

MANAGEMENT at Yarrow Shipbuilders on the Clyde will meet union
conveners today to discuss the company's prospects, as concern grows
among the 3000 workforce over current orders.
The Glasgow yard has been successful in recent years in significantly
cutting costs by turning warship building techniques into an almost car
factory-style of continuous production.
However, the downside is that without further orders, gaps will appear
at the start of the building process.
This can be partly compensated through greater flexibility and moving
workers to other parts of the construction process, but that inevitably
can only be a temporary measure. Without further orders workers may have
to be sacked.
Unwilling to speculate too much about the future, a management
spokesman said: ''We are concerned, as we always are. There is an urgent
need to secure new orders.''
Indeed, with such a large workforce, securing fresh orders is a
constant process. Only two days ago the firm put in its tender for four
patrol corvettes for the South African Navy. The country's Ministry of
Defence has so far eliminated bids from Danish, French, and German
yards, leaving a straight fight between Yarrow and Spanish firm Bazan.
This obviously strengthens Yarrow's chances, but there are other
hurdles to be faced.
There are critics within the African National Congress who believe the
money would be better spent on housing and other social needs, rather
than on defence.
More subtly, there are government officials in the republic who would
like to see the corvette order linked to the sale of South African goods
to the country building the corvettes.
Another prospect for the Scotstoun yard is its tender for three
further Type 23 frigates for the Royal Navy. The tender has to be
submitted in March, but it is not known when the MoD will announce the
orders.
Yarrow's production process makes it favourite. Its obvious
competitors being VSEL at Barrow-in-Furness, and Vosper Thorneycroft of
Southampton.

<HEADLINE>Plan to close down psychiatric hospital</HEADLINE>

EXCLUSIVE
THE future of one of Glasgow's largest psychiatric hospitals is in
doubt according to an internal letter passed to The Herald.
The letter from Mr Tim Davison, the chief executive of Greater Glasgow
Community and Mental Health Trust, outlines plans to close the 469-bed
Leverndale Hospital in the south of the city.
Acute patient care would be transferred to redeveloped psychiatric
services based at the Southern General Hospital and newly built
psychiatric wards at the Victoria Infirmary.
Other patients would be transferred to the community or relocated
largely to privately provided community care beds.
The proposal angered union leaders because it was not mentioned in the
Joint Community Care Plan for the health board area published last month
and presently out for public consultation.
Mr Dave Watson, regional officer of the nursing union Unison, said:
''It makes a mockery of the public consultation process to announce a
further hospital closure. This proposal appears to be driven more by a
desire to sell valuable hospital sites than care.''
Mr Watson said that about 75% of the nursing staff at Leverndale were
members of Unison and he described the timing of the move as being
extremely insensitive.
''There is increasing public concern over the policy of community care
for mental health services. There is not even a hint of this in the
Joint Community Care Plan, which is why this is such a bolt from the
blue,'' he said.
Mr John McAllion, Labour's Scottish Health spokesman, said: ''The
Joint Community Care Plan was a long time in preparation and involved
all care services, yet there was no indication of any intention to close
this hospital -- this needs an explanation.''
Mr Davison's letter was addressed to Mr Tom Divers, the acting general
manager of Greater Glasgow Health Board. It also states that the trust
hopes to submit proposals, for mental health care in the south of the
city, to the health board in early 1995.
Shelagh McKinley, of Greater Glasgow Community and Mental Health
Trust, said that no conclusions had been reached on Leverndale's future.
''It is not the case that it will close. As the letter makes quite
clear, these are proposals.
''The only discussions which have been held are preliminary ones. They
are at a very early stage and we are looking at creating a whole package
of care in the south of the city. We must make it clear we are not
simply closing hospitals. We are building up community services which
allow us to close hospitals.
''Old Victorian hospitals are not best suited to provide the high
standards of care people expect today. Any firm proposals once they are
worked out would be consulted on very widely.''
A spokesman for Greater Glasgow Health Board said: ''We published our
plan on December 6 and made it clear we haven't fully developed our
plans for the south and west of the city. This is still being looked at
in some detail and any suggestion about the future of Leverndale is
purely speculative.''

THE body of a man who refused to leave his home despite repeated flood
warnings was discovered in Yorkshire yesterday when water levels started
to subside.
Clifford Greenwood, a 67-year-old bachelor, was found in
Pool-in-Wharfedale, near Leeds, where the River Wharfe had burst its
banks.
The rain was finally relenting overnight as, the length of England,
people began sorting out flood damage after the wettest January for
almost half a century.
The National Rivers Authority said nine red warnings had been issued
on rivers in England and Wales after hundreds of properties were flooded
nationwide.
Worst hit was Boroughbridge, North Yorkshire, where water from the
River Ure was just inches below flood defences and soldiers helped
evacuate residents after the town's main roundabout was submerged.

<HEADLINE>Italian road firm fined for pollution</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Italian construction firm which has landed in controversy over its
failure to complete the upgrading of a section of the A74 on schedule
was fined #12,000 yesterday for pollution, the highest penalty in
Scotland for a single pollution charge.
Castelli Girola UK Ltd admitted that it caused or knowingly permitted
poisonous, noxious or polluting matter -- namely suspended solids
consisting of silt -- to enter the Kirtle Water and two of its
tributaries.
The offences took place at the firm's construction site at
Cauldwellknowe, Eaglesfield, on five occasions.
Prosecuting at Dumfries Sheriff Court, depute fiscal Stuart Macfarlane
said the firm had received visits and warnings from officials of the
Solway River Purification Board whose guidelines were incorporated in
their contract.
He said that one of the problems was that the silting pond was too
small and on the first three occasions, the firm was found to be
discharging silty water into tributaries of Kirtle Water at the rate of
44,800 milligrammes per litre.
This compared with the EC recommended rate of 25,000 milligrammes a
litre per year.
Mr Macfarlane said that silt settled on the riverbed, forming a crust
and smothering plant life and fish eggs. It could also get into the
gills of young fish and kill them.
He added that the construction firm, which is upgrading the A74 dual
carriageway between Eaglesfield and Kirkpatrick Fleming to motorway
standard, was several months behind with its contract and was subject to
a penalty clause of about #8000 a day.
Mr Douglas Small, advocate for Castelli Girola, said the firm was now
taking steps to ensure that there would be no further pollution.

THE animal welfare controversy took a dramatic new turn yesterday when
a protester died during a demonstration against calf airlifts.
Police said a 31-year-old woman fell under the front wheels of a lorry
carrying calves to an aircraft at Coventry airport.
It is the second time the controversial export operation has been
dogged by tragedy.
In December an Algerian plane returning empty from the Continent
crashed near a housing estate in Coventry, killing all five people on
board.
Animal welfare groups said they were appalled by yesterday's tragedy.
In a statement Phoenix Aviation, which operates the flights, said they
had decided to suspend live veal calf flights.
''After the tragic incident near Coventry airport this afternoon the
company has decided to suspend its livestock flights for the time
being.''
Agriculture Minister William Waldegrave said he ''deeply regretted
this tragic incident''.
Ironically, the death came just hours after Mr Waldegrave said he was
confident the European Union would ban the use of the ''cruel'' veal
system on the Continent.
The woman, who has not been named but came from the Coventry area, was
injured when she slipped into the path of the slow-moving lorry after
leaping at the cab, said police.
She died later in hospital.
Police said about 40 protesters had ignored requests to clear the road
leading to the airport.
Three other people had also attempted to climb on the lorry but were
unhurt, added the spokesman.
The Police Complaints Authority is investigating the accident, which
happened shortly after 4.30pm.
A spokesman for Warwickshire Ambulance Service said the woman died
after suffering ''very severe multiple injuries''.

THE weather was perfect and the salmon were jumping, but on the first
day of the season on the River Dee only a handful of rebels were out
with their rods.
Anglers had been asked to delay their first casts until March as part
of a package of conservation measures proposed to reverse the decline in
numbers of salmon. Although the vast majority of beats were deserted
yesterday, there were some prepared to ignore the voluntary code.
Ghillie David Brady, 44, has cast a line on the first day of the
salmon season for almost 40 years and he maintained his tradition.
However, he spent only 10 minutes on the Ardoe beat, a few miles west
of Aberdeen, and admitted that he did not expect to catch anything as
the water was far too high.
He said that, for the past four years, not a single salmon had been
taken from the Dee by the 32-rod Ardoe syndicate during February, and he
believed that the Dee Salmon Improvement Association had got it all
wrong.
''I would like to see a catch limit, but a respectable one of one fish
a day. Everyone would be happy with that,'' he said. He added that he
believed the publicity was ruining the river.
Further up the river at Aboyne, ghillie Jim Cowper said that two of
the four time-share fishermen on his beat during February had said they
would abide by the code. He did not know about the other two.
He said those who bought the time shares had paid thousands of pounds
for their weeks. ''Personally, I think the measures are sensible,
because we have to protect the spring fish. These are the fish that are
missing. There are plenty of summer fish and back end fish. Without
measures the spring fish would be wiped out. However, my sympathy lies
with the owners. If February continues to remain closed how will these
people be reimbursed for their timeshares?''
The only anglers spotted along the length of the river, with the
exception of Mr Brady, were six rods at Upper Drum, which is owned by a
London syndicate.
The ghillie on that stretch, Mr Fred Fowler, had indicated he would
defy the measures which he believed had been introduced on the basis of
flawed scientific evidence.
The Dee Salmon Fishing Improvement Association said last night that,
while disappointed the code had been broken in view of its importance to
the future of ''Scotland's finest spring salmon river,'' it did mean
they had the support of the overwhelming majority of proprietors.
Spokesman Mr Andrew Bradford said: ''There are some 72 owners on the
Dee and Feugh, and only two rebels. It is galling for those who have
supported the Dee conservation code to find their efforts eroded.''
As well as delaying the start of the season by one month the
conservation code involves a partial catch and release policy of one
spring fish per rod per week and restricting the river to fly fishing
only.

PETER WOOD, chief executive of Direct Line, received a #7m pension
contribution last year on top of his #17m salary as a director of the
parent company, the Royal Bank of Scotland.
He easily tops the list of highest paid directors in a new survey by
the union-funded Labour Research group, which concentrates on pension
contributions for the first time.
Also on the list is Sir Iain Vallance, vice-chairman of the Royal Bank
of Scotland, who in addition to his #757,000 salary from BT received a
#94,000 pension entitlement.
Sir Iain also received #50,000 from bank, where he sits on the firm's
remuneration committee which calculates the pay of directors.
Another notable entry is Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman of Marks and
Spencer, whose #779,188 salary was topped up by a #90,250 pension
payment.
Sir Richard is chairing a group of highly-paid captains of industry,
set up by the CBI to prepare a code of good practice, in the wake of the
continuing furore over executive pay.
The Labour Research survey identified 41 directors in 238 companies
who received more than #50,000 in pension contributions in the latest
financial year. Many company reports, however, gave no specific
information on individual directors' contributions.
The study shows that not only are these directors receiving large
amounts in absolute terms, but as a percentage of their salary they are
also getting a better deal than most ordinary workers.
Second to Mr Wood was the appropriately named Mr Pat Rich who, when he
retired last year as chairman of industrial gases group BOC, received
just more than #1m in pension entitlements on top of his #387,000 salary
for his last six months in the job.
Mr Alexander Dyer subsequently took over as BOC's highest paid
director. In addition to his #620,000 salary, he received #472,000 in
pension contributions, putting him fourth in the Labour Research table
just behind Sir Paul Girolami, of Glaxo, whose #696,000 pension payment
took his total remuneration from Glaxo to more than #2m.
But to keep him in the style to which he has become accustomed, Glaxo
has also made a provision of a further #2.27m as a direct contribution
towards his pension.
Thames Water has a similar arrangement for its highest paid director,
although in this case it is for #76,000, on top of a contribution of the
same amount.
Although Sir Nicholas Goodison, former Stock Exchange chief, appears
only at number 36, he is nevertheless well looked after, as chairman of
the TSB banking group he joined in 1988.
He receives pension contributions of 22.5% of his #274,070 salary, but
the company has agreed to make up any shortfall, if his pension at 65
does not equal two thirds of his pay.
In contrast, after a similar 12-year period of service, an ordinary
TSB employee would expect to get a pension of about a fifth of final
salary.
The National Association of Pension Funds annual survey of pension
schemes shows that on average employers contribute between 7% and 8% to
occupational pension schemes. Of the 40 companies surveyed by Labour
Research, executives in almost all received pension contributions in
double figures and more than half received more than 20%.

Perth, Wednesday
FORMER England Test cricketer Tony Lock revealed that he is on the
verge of financial ruin after child sex charges against him were dropped
today.
Lock, 65, who is dying of lung cancer and has only months to live,
said he was relieved that his ordeal was over.
The former cricketer, who played 49 Tests for England, taking 174
wickets bowling left arm spin, told how he had endured a three-year
nightmare.
Lock had pleaded not guilty to four charges of indecency involving a
10-year-old girl in 1980.
He had met the girl's mother, a former member of the Australian
women's cricket team, during his first year as a player-coach for the
Western Australia Sheffield Shield team in 1962.
Speaking from his home in Beechboro, a northern suburb of Perth, the
former Surrey player said he had always maintained his innocence.
He said: ''It's gratifying to know my fight for justice has been
justified. Life hasn't been very pleasant for the past few years.
''I don't feel over-elated. I'm relieved, of course, that it's all
over but I'll never forget what I've been through. It will always be
with me.''
Referring to his terminal illness, he added: ''With all the pressures
I was under during the trial, I thought the only way I was going to get
out of there was in a wooden box.
''At least now I can hold my head a bit higher when I walk down the
street. There are people who will always believe I am guilty, regardless
of the outcome, but at least I know the truth. People will always
believe the worst.
''I suppose when I die it probably won't be Tony Lock, the greatest
slow left arm bowler to play for England, but Tony Lock, the guy who was
up on sex charges.
''I've always had an affinity with kids -- boys and girls -- but all
this has made me think twice now about going near anyone.
''My reputation has been destroyed but I'm lucky I've got friends who
won't give a stuff and they're the only people who matter.''
After his two-day trial last December, a jury failed to reach a
verdict and he was remanded to appear in the Western Australian District
Court today.
Prosecutor Ian Jones told the court the state director of public
prosecutions had decided to drop the charges because of the evidence
given at Lock's trial, his age and failing health, and the cost to the
community of a retrial.
In November 1993, a jury acquitted Lock on a charge of indecently
assaulting a 15-year-old girl during a cricket lesson at his home in
1987.
Lock was first arrested by child abuse detectives in February 1992.
He said today that his family was close to financial ruin after paying
legal fees to defend the two court cases and he had been forced to sell
some of his cricketing memorabilia.
''You can't carve up a trophy and put it in a sandwich,'' he said.
''The case is over but we'll still be paying for it for another five
years.''
Lock spoke sadly of the death of his wife of 45 years, Audrey, who
died in September last year after suffering a stroke.
He said: ''The only sad thing tinged with all this is Audrey's not
here. She stood by me from the start and believed in me implicitly.
''I do believe these charges were a contributing factor to her death
because for any person it's a big strain. It's a bit horrifying, sad,
when you turn over in bed during the night and no-one's there.''
Lock's son, Richard, said the sex charges had affected the way the
former cricketer related to people.
He said: ''Mum had to drag him outside. He didn't want to go out. He
didn't want to face people.
''It has affected all of us -- not that we ever doubted dad's
innocence. It's the constant pressure.
''Something like this either brings you closer together or tears you
apart. We've had to bond together as a family.''
Lock now plans to spend time with his grandchildren and is thinking of
returning to England for a holiday in the next few months.

THE convicted Ice Cream War murderer Joe Steele, who has escaped twice
and staged protests claiming innocence, has had a third attempt thwarted
at Perth Prison.
The escape bid was made with a second life sentence prisoner, John
Croall. The men used a key, possibly a forged master key according to
friends of Steele, and apparently got through several doors and into the
prison grounds.
Croall was jailed for life after robbing a bank in Aberdeen at
gunpoint in 1993.
Two inquiries are under way at the high-security jail, one into how
security procedures could have been breached and the other a discipline
inquiry. It is understood Steele, 33, and Croall, 44, went missing from
their prison hall shortly after 8pm on Tuesday. They were discovered
soon afterwards by an internal security patrol officer but in a part of
the jail, believed to be staff accommodation, where they should not have
been.
The Scottish Prison Service yesterday appointed Mr James Milne, the
area director for the North and East, to head the security inquiry. A
senior governor from a different prison will head the discipline
inquiry.
On Steele's previous escapes, he returned voluntarily to prison on
both occasions. He has been drawing attention to his repeated claims
that he was wrongly convicted for the murder of six members of the Doyle
family in Ruchazie, Glasgow, in 1984. Steele and Thomas Campbell, now in
Shotts Prison, are currently the focus of a campaign led by friends and
sympathisers and dubbed ''Free the Glasgow Two''.
Steele's latest escape attempt may be connected to the fact that a
decision by the Crown Office on whether or not to prosecute the key Ice
Cream War trial witness, William Love, for perjury, is imminent. The
Herald has been told the decision will be announced within the next few
days.
Lawyers close to the case believe the Crown will refuse to prosecute
Love despite his repeated confessions that he lied, allegedly under
duress, at the original trial. A prosecution would certainly mean the
freeing of Campbell and Steele, rocking the Scottish criminal justice
system.
The trial judge told the jury that without Love's evidence they could
not convict. Some key supporters of Campbell and Steele have changed
their position in recent times to suggest Love was coerced into lying by
a major Glasgow criminal rather than, as they had originally alleged, by
detectives.
Steele's escapes took place in 1993, the first during a compassionate
visit to his sick mother in Barholm Square, Garthamlock, Glasgow. He
remained at large for several weeks before chaining and glueing himself
to the gates of Buckingham Palace to draw attention to his protests of
innocence.
On the second occasion he and four others made off through a hole in a
playing field fence at Saughton Prison, Edinburgh. He again remained at
large for some time before giving himself up after climbing a lighting
and camera tower outside the gates of Barlinnie Prison, Glasgow, for the
benefit of press and television.
Steele, who has served more than 10 years of his life sentence, has
stated he would not accept parole ''even if they throw it at me''
because it would mean admitting guilt.

From MICHAEL MILLER
Los Angeles, Wednesday
A CLOSE friend of O J Simpson testified in the football legend's
murder trial today that Simpson told him only hours after his ex-wife's
murder that he had had ''lots of dreams'' about killing her.
In a statement to police, the friend, Ronald Shipp, also said that
after the conversation with Simpson he came to believe his old friend
was guilty of killing Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald
Goldman.
The statement was contained in a motion filed by the prosecution in
support of allowing the jury to hear the dream testimony.
Deputy District Attorney Hank Goldberg said in court that the dreams
showed Simpson had a ''fatal obsession'' with his ex-wife, who was
stabbed to death along with Goldman last June.
Simpson has pleaded not guilty to the murders.
After taking the witness stand today, Shipp, a marital counsellor and
former police officer, was asked by prosecutor Christopher Darden if he
and Simpson were still friends. ''I still love the guy but I don't know.
This is a weird situation I'm in, sitting here,'' he said.
In answer to Darden, Shipp agreed he was the man referred to as
''Leo,'' in the book Raging Heart by Sheila Weller.
It was in that book that ''Leo'' first mentioned Simpson's dreams of
killing Nicole Brown Simpson. Shipp said Weller had agreed to give him
anonimity by calling him ''Leo.''
In the book, he said that during a conversation at Simpson's home the
night after the murders, Simpson told him: ''I was interviewed by
detectives and they asked me to take a lie detector test.''
Shipp then asked Simpson, ''Well, well what did you say?''
Simpson then chuckled and replied: ''Hey, to be truthful Ron, man,
I've had a lot of dreams about killing her. I really don't know about
taking that thing.''
Asked by Darden why he had talked to Weller even before talking to the
police or the district attorney's office, Shipp said: ''Ever since I had
that conversation it's been burning me up.''
In his statement to police Detective Philip Vanatter, Shipp, a friend
of Simpson for 26 years, said he was shocked by Simpson's dream
revelation and told him, ''I am in shock, man.''
''I just did not know what to say to this man . . . and at this point
in time, it's not personal. I mean from being a police officer, I just
knew my personal belief, that he was guilty by asking these questions,''
Shipp said in his statement.
The questions, he said, were part of another conversation that evening
in which Simpson asked him how long it took for the results of DNA tests
to come back.
Shipp said Simpson told him officers had found a glove and a cap and
asked him what that meant, and then asked how long it took for DNA
evidence to come back.
''It just came out of the blue . . . He says, 'How long does it take
for DNA evidence to come back?' I honestly have no idea but I told him
two months,'' Shipp said in his statement.
Shipp testified that when he asked Simpson why he was talking about
DNA, ''Jokingly, he just said, 'Honestly Shipp, I've had some dreams of
killing her.'''
Goldberg, in a reference to the dream statement, told Superior Court
Judge Lance Ito, ''In and of itself the statement is perfectly
understandable, it is very clear. It is the defendant saying 'Hey, I
dreamed about killing this woman.'''
Defence attorney Carl Douglas argued that the dream statement should
not be admitted, saying, ''We deny that the conversation ever took place
or that the statements were ever made.''

THE Democratic Unionists wore their habitual expression of men who
have been betrayed; the Ulster Unionists theirs of men who very much
fear they are being betrayed. Despite the high stakes which had produced
an emergency statement from the Northern Ireland Secretary and a
nationwide broadcast from the Prime Minister, the rest of the Commons
took calmly the affair of the leaked UK-Irish framework document.
Sir Patrick Mayhew was at his silkiest setting out again to square the
circle, the perpetual fate of those who seek an answer to the Irish
question. His assurances that the document was only a draft which had
not been agreed by the British or Irish governments did not go far to
placate the Unionists.
The notion of an all-Ireland authority which could negotiate with
Europe and which members of a Northern Ireland executive would be
required to attend was for them a constitutional development much too
far.
The framework document, when one was agreed -- for, of course, one had
not been agreed said Sir Patrick in capital letters -- would merely be
offered to the Province's constitutional parties. There was no question
of its suggestions being imposed, he soothed. He recited ''triple lock''
like a mantra. The parties would all have to agree on any developmenent,
the Province's voters would have to agree, Parliament would have to
agree.
What stuck in the Unionist craw, however, was that such things as an
all-Ireland authority on anything was being thought of at all. ''He
cannot expect any self-respecting Unionist to sit down at that table if
that is going to be on the table,'' boomed Ian Paisley, a dig well
understood by the Official Unionists across the Chamber who are
perpetually trying to work out how politically dangerous for them it
would be to sit down at the table in any case.
Their leader, the shrewd Jim Molyneaux, said the revelation had
wrecked the current consultation process. ''Seek another way forward,''
snapped Mr William Ross (Londonderry East). Mr John D. Taylor
(Strangford), one of the aspirants to succeed Mr Molyneaux, warned Sir
Patrick it was no good just bringing Sinn Fein on board.
The rest of the House closed ranks around the peace process. Ministers
should remember that on this policy they had a big majority, comforted
Alan Beith for the Liberal Democrats, and Mo Mowlam said Labour would
offer what help it could.
Unhappily, the process chiefly involves Mr Major and Sir Patrick as
coachmen trying to steer a fractious team of horses each of which
fancies its own route and has a different idea of the destination at
which it intends to arrive.
The Rev. William McCrea (Mid Ulster) wondered why Mr Major did not
speak up as loudly for keeping Northern Ireland in the Union as he did
about Scotland. Sir Patrick neatly reminded him that the Prime Minister
has also said that Scotland could not be kept in the Union if it
citizens voted for independence so it must be with the Province. The
people must decide.
The danger that the leak might set off violence that could derail the
peace process properly prompted the Government's high-level response.
Sir Patrick called it ''mischievous and dangerous.'' But it did strike
one that it was perhaps as well that the leak came before the framework
document had been finalised. As Mr McCrea put it bluntly the current
document would not stand ''a dog's chance'' of approval by Unionists.
At least, the leak has given the British Government a chance to go
back to the drawing board and try to convince the Irish Government which
fails to learn the lesson that a united Ireland cannot be seized quickly
by negotiation any more than by violence.
If there is to be such an outcome, it will require peace and time. Yet
both are commodities Ministers cannot command. They must be aware even
as they try to pacify obdurate Unionists that the very success of their
efforts could have the IRA reaching again for their Armalites.

Cape Kennedy, Wednesday
THE first British-born astronaut to make a space walk will be Dr
Michael Foale, a member of the US space shuttle Discovery which blasts
off tomorrow.
Dr Foale, 38, was born in Lincolnshire but is now an American citizen,
having emigrated in 1982 to become an astronaut. He is one of three
mission specialists in Discovery's crew of six.
Also on the flight is Russian cosmonaut Vladimir Titov.
On his first trip into orbit, the Russian almost crashed into a space
station. Five months later, he was catapulted off an exploding rocket.
Another time, he had to abort a spacewalk when a wrench broke.
Titov, 48, a cosmonaut since 1976 and a Russian Air Force colonel, has
been waiting for this moment for more than three years. Part of
Discovery's mission is to rendezvous with the Russian space station Mir.
The shuttle launch was postponed later for almost 24 hours following a
technical problem.

Brussels,
THE prospect of the British Government being hauled before the
European Court of Justice for refusing a Scottish Parliament was raised
yesterday.
The EU's fledgling Committee of the Regions, established by Maastricht
to bring Brussels policy-making closer to the people, is considering
invoking the principle of subsidiarity to compel the UK and other
centralist states to devolve more power.
During the Thatcher and Major years the United Kingdom has
consistently refused to set up parliaments or assemblies in Scotland and
Wales, insisting that subsidiarity -- decentralising power from Brussels
-- stops at the level of the nation state.
This policy is hotly contested in Brussels and is now being challenged
by Mr Jordi Pujol, nationalist prime minister of the strongly-devolved
Catalonia region of Spain. Mr Pujol is widely credited as being the man
keeping the troubled Spanish socialist Premier, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, in
power through a coalition arrangement and he is recognised as a
formidable force in European regionalism.
He is official reporter to a group examining ways of giving the CoR
more powers when Maastricht 2 is negotiated at next year's
inter-governmental conference.
If the CoR was accorded the formal status of an EU institution it
could sue the Council of Ministers in the Court of Justice. The basis of
the suit would be that the council, representing member states, has
failed to ensure subsidiarity is carried out adequately by some EU
countries. Those to be targeted would probably be Britain, Portugal and
Greece, which are regarded as among the most centralised.
The idea of eventual litigation will be discussed today at the CoR's
plenary in Brussels but some members oppose the idea. Doubters about the
wisdom of such a move are said to include Mr Jacques Blanc, the
right-wing French CoR president, who is likely to support a call for the
idea to be dropped temporarily or reconsidered when subsidiarity is
discussed at a special committee conference in Montpellier next month.
Mr Blanc is anxious not to cause inter-institutional friction in the
EU ahead of the IGC, which he described yesterday as a ''unique occasion
politically to reinforce the Committee of the Regions.'' But he
insisted: ''Subsidiarity is our political leitmotif.''
He was speaking after CoR members discussed the prospect of new powers
for the 222-strong committee which has 24 British members, including
five Scots. Mr Pujol's views are seen as an expression of the CoR's
impatience to be given more say in the EU -- an ambition which has
already caused suspicions in the European Parliament where Euro-MPs see
it as a potential legislative rival. Mr Pujol wants the CoR granted
formal recognition as an EU institution alongside the commission,
council and parliament.
The prospect of European law forcing the Government's hand was
welcomed by Mr Eurig Wyn, a Plaid Cymru member of the CoR, last night.
He said: ''We would like Maastricht to say clearly that subsidiarity
must be practised below nation state level. If our proposals are not
taken on board we should appeal to the Court of Justice on behalf of the
unrepresented people of Scotland and Wales.''
But Councillor Charles Gray, former Labour leader of Strathclyde,
said: ''Subsidiarity is important and too few governments observe it --
and ours is very guilty of this. But at present the CoR needs friends,
not enemies.'' He said he agreed ''this time around'' with dropping the
call for a court appeal.
Edinburgh district councillor Brian Meek, an outspoken Tory
devolutionist, said: ''I don't think we should try to get devolution
through Europe. It has to be done in the UK context. I think it would be
deeply resented if anyone tried to get the European Court to say we must
have a Parliament.''
A spokesman for the Scottish National Party said: ''The British
Government is totally hypocritical on the question of subsidiarity,
demanding it for Westminster but denying it to Scotland.
''A key advantage of Independence in Europe is that it is available to
Scots as of right whenever we vote for it. There is no London veto on
independence -- as John Major admitted just last week.''

<HEADLINE>Babies 'at grave risk' from car airbags</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>5</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>980058383</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
PARENTS were warned yesterday that car safety airbags could kill
babies sitting in rear-facing child seats.
The danger was so grave, said the Consumers' Association, that
explicit warning labels should be fitted immediately in all cars with
passenger airbags.
Tests showed that a child sitting backwards in the front of a Fiat
Punto or Vauxhall Corsa would be killed in a crash -- and the Corsa
carried no warning, said a report in the association's Which? magazine.
''Never put a child in a rearward-facing child seat placed in front of
a passenger airbag,'' said the report.
''In a crash, the airbag comes out with such force that the blow would
kill a child.
''The danger is so grave that visible, explicit, and permanent warning
labels are needed now in all vehicles with passenger airbags. In the
longer term, car makers must find a permanent solution.''
Most child seats do carry warnings about the dangers of placing them
backwards in front of airbags.
Which? said airbags could also damage grown-up passengers who braced
themselves in a crash. The airbags inflated so quickly that bones in
hands or arms could be smashed.
It added that airbags and seat belt pre-tensioners did not always give
as much protection as they could, and warned that many folding rear seat
backs were not strong enough to prevent luggage being thrown forward in
a crash.
The magazine said tests carried out by car manufacturers should be
more realistic.

NO NEW evidence has come to light to change the Government's belief
that Libyan intelligence agents carried out the bombing of PanAm flight
103 over Lockerbie, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said yesterday.
In response to a Private Member's debate called by Linlithgow MP Tam
Dalyell, Mr Hurd dismissed claims by Mr Dalyell that new evidence
challenges the official version of events and deserves an Government
inquiry.
Mr Hurd said: ''The painstaking work by the Scottish police and Crown
Office has led to charges being brought against two individuals. The
case against them stands.''
He said he was responding personally in the debate -- instead of a
junior Minister -- because of the enormity of the crime and because of
his wish to ''lay to rest certain suspicions and accusations that have
arisen.''
The police investigation into the bombing, which killed 270 people in
December 1988, was the most extensive in British criminal history. Mr
Hurd rejected accusations that the Government influenced the
investigation for political or diplomatic considerations.
Scottish and American prosecutors issued arrest warrants for two
Libyans in connection with the attack in the belief that it was
orchestrated by Libya. However, the government of Muammar Gaddafi has
refused to hand them over for trial in either Scotland or the United
States.
Families of the victims and their supporters claim evidence has been
supressed which shows the bombing was the work of Palestinian
paramilitaries, working on behalf of Iran, who took advantage of an
established American drug intelligence operation to plant the bomb.
Mr Dalyell asked the Foreign Secretary to explain why some American
officials were warned not to get on the flight.
Six years after the attack, the relatives ''want to know exactly why
US personnel were withdrawn from that flight, and exactly what officials
of the US government knew. This was not available to the youngsters
going to their deaths.''
Mr Hurd rejected the suggestion and said Dumfries and Galloway police
investigators remained ready to consider any new evidence.
However, he offered only one new detail. He revealed that Scottish
police had been notified of the arrest of two suspected Palestinian
terrorists arrested by the German authorities before the bombing.
''Requests were made for both men to be interviewed, the requests were
granted, and Scottish police were present at those interviews.''
Part of the case of the Lockerbie campaigners against the Government's
version of events is that the two suspects were released by the Germans
for no apparent reason, despite evidence suggesting they were preparing
an attack.
Mr Hurd dismissed an American intelligence document released last
month purporting to show that the bombing had been commissioned by a
former Iranian interior minister for a bounty of $10m, saying that no
credible evidence had been found.
Afterwards, Mr Dalyell said: ''The Foreign Secretary passed by on the
other side of the road and did not address the critical questions of
which he was given notice.''
The relatives expressed disappointment that the Government was
continuing to ignore their call for an official inquiry.
Ms Pamela Dix, a spokeswoman for the British relatives who lost a
brother at Lockerbie, said: ''Every piece of evidence that comes up to
wreck the official version is always discounted. Those who bring it up
are dismissed as not credible.''
Dr Jim Swire, whose daughter Flora died in the attack, said: ''There
are two things we have not got six years later. We have not got the
truth and we have not seen justice in action.''
The relatives and Mr Dalyell promised to continue their campaign. They
have enlisted the help of Mr Michael Mansfield QC, who wants to focus on
what he described as the failure of three governments -- American,
British and German -- to warn passengers booked on flight 103 of the
risk they faced.

EXCLUSIVE
MOVES are being made within the Labour Party to scrap the commitment
to tax-raising powers for the Scottish Parliament, sparking off a debate
to be aired during its conference at Inverness next month.
The right of the Parliament in Edinburgh to raise or lower income tax
by up to three pence in the pound, is a long-standing policy agreed
during years of deliberation by Labour and its Liberal Democrat partners
on the Scottish Constitutional Convention.
The move to scrap that policy and send the whole matter back for
further consideration has come from Mr Jim Stevens, an economist at the
Fraser of Allander Institute, and a member of the Labour Party's
Scottish executive committee.
He tabled a last-minute amendment just before the closing date
yesterday, which radically alters a motion drafted by Scottish Labour
Action, the party grouping most in favour of a Scottish Parliament with
strong economic powers.
Although support for Home Rule is now virtually universal within the
Scottish Labour Party, there is a considerable gulf between a strongly
pro-Union wing which sees devolution as the best way of preserving the
UK, and the pro-Nationalist wing of SLA which envisages something closer
to full Scottish sovereignty. Yesterday's move lays down battle lines
for that debate.
A recent newsletter circulated to SLA members spoke of concern over
possible moves to scrap the tax-raising powers. ''When we decided to
sponsor this particular aspect of the Scottish debate for this year's
conference, we did not realise the jitters that were beginning to jangle
in some quarters over our commitment to revenue-raising powers for the
Parliament,'' it stated.
''As the debate at November's meeting of the National Policy Forum
revealed, there are people in the party, on the Scottish executive and
in Parliament, who think we should drop our commitment to a
revenue-raising legislature.''
Mr George Robertson, Shadow Scottish Secretary and MP for Hamilton,
last night denied that there was any prospect of a policy change of this
kind. ''There is no veracity in the suggestion that this is a view that
is gaining ground,'' he said.
He did not believe Mr Stevens' amendment stood any chance of success,
saying: ''This is one of the parts of the convention package and I do
not envisage it being changed.''
The Inverness conference will provide an opportunity to gauge party
feeling. Mr Stevens' amendment deletes a section of a motion from
Cumbernauld and Kilsyth backing ''the right of the Scottish Parliament
to vary levels of taxation within agreed parameters.''
Instead, he substitutes: ''Conference recognises the political and
economic constraints facing a Scottish Parliament in respect of
taxation, and welcomes the decision of the Scottish Policy Forum to
examine the scope for fiscal autonomy and recommend appropriate
arrangements.''
His amendment also supports the ''political coherence of the UK'' and
says the new Parliament ''must be carefully devised to ensure that
Scotland secures a stable, influential, and enduring position within a
reformed UK constitutional and institutional framework.''
Mr Bob McLean, SLA convener, said of tax-raising powers: ''This is an
important symbol. The point has to be made that if people are to be
allowed to express different social and economic priorities from the
rest of the UK, there must be the right to raise revenue to cover
this.''
One activist who heard Mr Stevens address the forum in Stirling in
November, said: ''I don't think this issue just popped up. Pat McFadden,
adviser to Tony Blair, was sitting there nodding. My concern is that the
leadership will see this issue as an Achilles' heel to its image as a
non high-tax party, and it may want to draw Scotland back into a more
restricted Britain-wide scheme.''

A PROFESSOR'S theory on the existence of an undiscovered particle of
matter, which he first proposed about 30 years ago, is to be put to the
test in a #1000m research project in pursuit of The Holy Grail of
science -- the origins of the universe.
The money will be spent on building a huge machine to recreate the
incredible heat and conditions of the first million millionth of a
second of the beginning of time and The Big Bang that gave birth to the
universe.
The hope is that causing high-speed collisions between beams of
protons in the immense heat will produce debris that will include an
elementary particle named after Professor Peter Higgs, 64, Edinburgh
University's Professor of Theoretical Physics. It is regarded as the key
to the mystery of creation.
The professor, who regards his proposition of three decades ago as his
most important contribution to science, was present yesterday when
details of the project were unveiled in Edinburgh.
Professor Higgs, who comes from Newcastle, was modest about his role
as originator of what would be the most amazing discovery.
He first proposed the existence of his Higgs bosen in a mathematical
paper published in 1966.
It suggested the notion of a particle which gives weight to matter and
might have triggered the sudden, rapid expansion of the universe from
possibly the original size of a pinhead.
The machine in which the theory will be tested -- the Large Hadron
Collider -- was given the go-ahead recently by the 19-member states of
Cern, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics in Geneva, where it
will be sited. The target year for full operation is 2008.
Dr Lyndon Evans, project director, described it as ''the most
sophisticated scientific instrument that has ever been contemplated''.
Professor David Saxon, of the Kelvin chair of physics at Glasgow
University, compared the experiment with the national lottery when he
spoke of the millions upon millions of matter collisions the machine
would create.
''When you want to win a lottery you have to bet a lot of times,'' he
said.
He predicted that the project would be a stimulus for Scottish and
British industries willing to take advantage of the spin-off work
involved.

A MAJOR shake-up of local enterprise company boundaries in the West of
Scotland, triggered by local government reform, could result in
Dunbartonshire Enterprise being dismembered.
One option being privately canvassed by Scottish Enterprise, would see
parts of the existing Dunbartonshire Enterprise area being added to
three other Lecs -- Lanarkshire Development Agency, Glasgow Development
Agency, and Renfrewshire Enterprise.
Apart from the dramatic impact on the Dunbartonshire Lec itself, the
proposals are causing considerable unease in parts of Lanarkshire.
There, those who fear an enlarged and over-dominant LDA are arguing that
it too should be split up.
The proposals are also bound to trigger a row in the northern commuter
belt around Glasgow, where areas like Bearsden and Milngavie stoutly
resisted being lumped in with Glasgow when Scottish Enterprise was first
created in 1990. Under the new proposals, they again face that prospect.
The new structure of single tier local authorities, which comes into
effect in 1996, not only redraws the local government map of Scotland.
It also undermines the existing principle that, as far as practicable,
Lec boundaries should be coterminous with those of local councils.
The problem only arises in the area around Glasgow. It has long been
known that opinion within the Scottish Enterprise network tended to
favour a parallel restructuring to bring the Lec boundaries into line.
Now the Scottish Enterprise board has issued a private consultation
paper, examing five options for reform. The Herald has seen a copy of
that paper. Once the consultation is completed, the SE board will advise
the Scottish Secretary, Mr Ian Lang, on what should be done. It is for
Mr Lang to make the final decision.
The most radical option being considered would see Cumbernauld and
Kilsyth and Cambuslang added to the existing area of the LDA. That would
add some 122,000 people to the Lanarkshire Lec, allowing it to challenge
Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise and the GDA as the largest Lec in
Scotland. It would be the only one with two new towns within its
boundaries.
Under the same option East Dunbartonshire, the new council area to be
formed from Bearsden and Milnagavie and Strathkelvin would be added to
the area covered by the Glasgow Development Agency.
When this option was aired, at the time of the formation of the GDA by
its then-chairman Lord Macfarlane, it was vigorously resisted by these
same dormitory areas.
Under the same proposal, the rest of the current Dunbartonshire
Enterprise area -- the new Clydebank and Dumbarton council area and East
Argyll (the area around Helensburgh which is going into the new Argyll
and Bute council) -- will be merged with Renfrewshire Enterprise to form
a new Firth of Clyde Lec.
Technically the East Argyll area ought to go into the jurisdiction of
Highlands and Islands Enterprise. But there was no provision in the
Local Government (Scotland) Act to allow that to happen.
The options offered by the paper range from no action to this most
radical proposal. They do not include dividing the LDA between the new
North and South Lanarkshire council areas, although that idea has
support in some parts of Lanarkshire.
The paper warns that change in Lec boundaries carries costs. It warns
that these could include ''an unavoidable period of uncertainty among
key partners'' and ''possible interruptions and delays to key projects
and initiatives''.

Siwa Oasis, Wednesday
ARCHAEOLOGISTS who are searching in Egypt for the tomb of Alexander
the Great said today they had uncovered an underground passage leading
to his final resting place.
But they announced a one-month break from their excavations, leaving
historians in suspense as to whether they really have found the burial
site of the all-conquering Macedonian king -- and solved one of the
ancient world's enduring mysteries.
Liana Souvaltzi, 47, head of the Greek team exploring the sprawling
and leafy oasis of Siwa in Egypt's western desert, said she hoped they
would return to work at the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan
which began today.
She showed journalists visiting the site at al-Maraqi, about 10 miles
west of Siwa town, a concealed crypt leading down from the entrance of
the smaller of two excavated buildings.
A passageway, impenetrable until it is cleared of mud and water, led
on to the actual burial chamber, she said. ''I cannot say how many
metres down it is. We have to follow the signs and estimate what is the
length and direction we have to follow.''
She said the larger building -- about 50 yards long and 20 yards wide,
with a long corridor leading to two ante-chambers and a ''burial
chamber'' -- was an elaborate decoy designed to mislead potential grave
robbers.
''It is a unique discovery. Finding his tomb was always the dream of
everybody. But now we know where he is buried and we have all the
details,'' Souvaltzi told reporters at the site where, despite
sceptisism from many experts, she insists Alexander the Great was
buried.
Until now most historians had said his grave is somewhere in the
Egyptian port city he founded and which was named after him --
Alexandria.
Al-Maraqi, surrounded by eerie-looking pink outcrops of rock, lies on
the outer edge of the oasis where Alexander was proclaimed a god in 332
BC, just before he launched a highly successful strike against the
Persian king Darius.
Souvaltzi said there was overwhelming evidence for her view, including
stone tablets her team uncovered which appear to show that Alexander's
deputy Ptolemy I carried his mummified body back to al-Maraqi after he
died in Babylon in a military campaign, and that the Roman emperor
Trajan came to make offerings to the ''one and unique'' Alexander after
his death.
She said that the site had typical Macedonian designs, such as oak
leaf insignia at the top of columns, and said Alexander himself
requested that he be buried there.
''Everyone is free to believe what he likes but we have archaeological
proof. The tablets were found here, the tomb is here, everything is
here. In Alexandria, nothing,'' she said.
Souvaltzi, who studied archaeology at Athens University, heads a team
which includes her husband Manos, an epigraphist who interprets the
ancient inscriptions on the tablets and says he has financed their five
years' work in Siwa.
Liana Souvaltzi, an unashamed fan of the military leader whose
conquests spread Greek influence across the eastern Mediterranean and
deep into Asia, said Alexander was ''a universal personality and a man
of vision.''
''If he hadn't died so young -- and from our second inscription we
have information that Alexander was poisoned -- the destiny of the whole
world would have been different. He was going to unite the whole
world,'' she said.
Asked why she choose in 1989 to start digging at al-Maraqi, she said
she paid more attention to her instinct and interest in local traditions
than in received historical wisdom.

From STEVE HAYS
Amsterdam, Wednesday
EMERGENCY services and an army of volunteers struggled to plug weak
points in flood defences today as water levels reached critical levels
in the Netherlands but began receding in Germany, Belgium and France.
Tens of thousands more people were ordered to abandon their homes in
the central Netherlands with huge tracts of the country braced for
catastrophe as sodden dikes threatened to collapse after days of intense
pressure from rising rivers.
''The situation is very hard to predict,'' Interior Minister Hans
Dijkstal told a news conference. ''It is extremely difficult to make a
reasonable estimate of the danger.''
One dike near the village of Ochten on the River Waal, 12 miles west
of Nijmegen, began crumbling, creating panic among local residents and
prompting a massive and swift military response.
Ed d'Hondt, mayor of Nijmegen, said that the critical weakness in the
Dutch river defences lay along a 12-mile stretch of dikes between the
villages of Druten and Dreumel, either side of Ochten.
He warned there was a 50-50 chance the Ochten dike could collapse,
flooding the entire polder, home to 40,000 people.
Flood fears also increased to the northeast where the river Issel
reached critical levels behind an emergency dike near Kampen, a medieval
town of 30,000 people.
But the flooding, which has claimed at least 26 lives over thousands
of square miles across northern Europe this week, and has sent well over
250,000 people fleeing from their homes, was easing around the Rhine to
the east of the Netherlands.
D'Hondt said the Rhine was expected to fall by 12 inches a day over
the next few days, but the risk of further flooding remained.
''We don't expect people will be able to start returning home this
week,'' he said.
The floods, which have already claimed 16 lives in France, six in
Belgium, three in Germany and one in the Netherlands, are likely to
become the costliest of this century.
Damage estimates are already above #1260m.
Dutch analysts said damage and evacuation costs could be as high as
three billion guilders (#1107m), as long as flood defences held.
French insurance companies, calling it the ''costliest flood for
almost a century'', predicted the bill there alone could be up to three
billion francs (#360m).
The German cabinet proposed to put aside 30 million marks (#12.6m) to
subsidise low-interest loans for flood repairs, while Belgium budgeted
1.8 billion francs (#36m) for a special disaster fund.
The costs are likely to cause more heartache for many people and
businesses, however, as few people in the Netherlands, Belgium and
Germany have flood insurance.
Britain's Commercial Union said it was not worried about its exposure
through its Dutch Delta Lloyd subsidiary because Dutch property
insurance generally excluded flood damage.
The main waterways through the Netherlands and Germany were likely to
remain closed to shipping for at least another week, stranding 85% of
Europe's oil and dry bulk barge fleet.
In France's Brittany region, water levels were easing, especially in
the worst-hit Ile-et-Vilaine department and officials said rivers could
return to normal levels by Sunday.
Several roads were reopened in Belgium, but weather forecasters warned
against over-optimism.
In Cologne, one of the worst affected areas, the Rhine was ebbing by
the hour after cresting at three times its normal depth on Monday.
Meanwhile, the RAF was joining international efforts to help the Dutch
tonight. It was sending nine heavy-lift helicopters to Holland after an
urgent plea for help from the Dutch emergency services.
Five giant twin-rotor Chinooks, two from RAF Laarbruch in Germany and
three from RAF Odiham, Hampshire, will spearhead the operation assisted
by two Puma helicopters from Odiham and two Wessex helicopters from RAF
Benson, Oxfordshire.
A Reuter reporter travelling west out of Tiel, along the Waal, saw
huge traffic jams building up on roads to Nijmegen and Utrecht.
''It's calm, but I can see miles and miles of very slow moving
traffic. There is every kind of vehicle -- caravans carrying bicycles,
horse-boxes piled high with pot plants, trailers, trucks, cars and
buses,'' he said.
In Tiel, a mediaeval town whose 35,000 inhabitants were told yesterday
to leave, the view from the town walls was of vast areas under water,
dotted with treetops, rooftops, half-submerged lamp-posts, the tips of
traffic lights and telephone kiosks.
Elsewhere, more than 160 British troops from the RAF Regiment, who
have been helping to fight rising waters on the River Maas for days,
were praised by Queen Beatrix when she toured the area today.
She met the airmen from RAF Laarbruch who have been working around the
clock since last Saturday.Reuter/PA.

A YEAR past November, I called into a bookstore in Princes Street to
snaffle up some early Christmas presents.
Confronting me were two displays -- one of the newly-released Downing
Street Years, selling at #25, and one of the Kama Sutra reduced to clear
at #5.
Apart from pondering what sort of society we live in when you can get
five copies of the Kama Sutra for one Margaret Thatcher, it occurred to
me to ask the staff who was responsible for the juxtapositioning of the
displays.
They confirmed that the Kama Sutra was outselling the former Prime
Minister -- whose memoirs had sold but one copy. The Kama Sutra had sold
substantially more and not all to Members of Parliament. Then a young
lady explained the presentation.
''I just thought that if people were in the store reading the Thatcher
book and any of their friends or neighbours came in, they could quickly
move over and pretend they were looking at the Kama Sutra!''
I wasn't the guilty party who bought either book, but contented myself
with the newspaper serialisation of Lady Thatcher.
Within the text, I found one surprising piece of common sense and
wisdom about Scotland.
It was the section in which the former Prime Minister faced the
possibility of what her response would be to a vote for Scottish
independence. It is a clear, dignified and principled position.
''As a nation, they (the Scots) have an undoubted right to
self-determination; thus far they have exercised that right by joining
and remaining in the Union. Should they determine on independence, no
English party or politician would stand in their way, hower much we
might regret their departure.''
It was rather more clear and more dignified than anything she had said
while in office, and it started for me a 14-month paper chase as I tried
to get the present Prime Minister to endorse the wise words.
My first ''Dear John'' letter received a pretty frosty response. He
referred me to a much more equivocal statement that he had made in the
White Paper on the ''Taking Stock'' exercise.
By October of last year at Prime Minister's Question Time, he was
employing the near-nuclear deterrent of telling me to read through his
speeches from the 1992 campaign
Steeling myself to that task on November 9, 1994, I sent him some
relevant passages of his speeches which seemed to touch on the right of
the Scottish people to self-determination. For good measure, I asked how
he could apparently and rightly preach the principle of consent in the
Province of Northern Ireland while denying it to the nation of Scotland.
By December 12, his replies were becoming more and more detailed.
There was still, however, no straight-forward confirmation of the key
quotation.
Then at last the breakthrough. I wrote a further letter in response to
his New Year broadcast, picking up on the point that he himself had
challenged Tony Blair on how Labour would react to an SNP majority in
any future Scottish Assembly. Once again I asked him to endorse the key
Thatcher quotation.
Back came a terse almost petulant answer, but one which finally
accepted ''my position is essentially the same as the passage you quote
from Lady Thatcher's memoirs.'' He added that there would be no further
amplification.
No further correspondence is needed. As someone once said, I have
''game, set and match.'' For the faint hearts and doubters, there is
finally an acceptance from a sitting UK Prime Minister that all Scotland
needs to do to achieve independence is to vote for it.
This view is roughly that which is becoming clear from the first
opinion surveys south of the Border on the Scottish issue which show the
majority of English people substantially more supportive and enlightened
about Scottish ambitions than many Scottish, but Westminster-based,
politicians.
If offers Scots the political opportunity to face our own
responsibility to change our own circumstances without any alibi that
somehow the ''nasty'' English won't let us. The decision is ours and
ours alone. There is no big bad wolf hanging over Scotland.
Now I've finally got one unionist party leader on side on
self-determination there remains the other one. Which is why I'm lifting
up my pen again this morning and to begin a note ''Dear Tony.''

Rome, Wednesday
ITALY'S former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi denied fresh
allegations of corruption today after newspapers reported that he could
face an investigation for suspected false accounting.
In one of the toughest statements he has issued in a months-long
battle with magistrates, the billionaire media mogul said plotters were
determined to wreck his political career and destroy his huge Fininvest
business empire.
It followed unconfirmed reports in newspapers that magistrates in
Milan had taken the first step in an inquiry into Berlusconi, who
resigned as prime minister in December, for alleged false accounting.

Grozny, Wednesday
RUSSIAN troops redoubled their efforts today to push rebel Chechen
fighters from their battered capital Grozny but it was increasingly
clear that Moscow's forces were bogged down in the city ruins.
Chechen separatists reported a determined Russian attempt to take back
the tram depot in the south of the city, but neither side seemed to have
moved from its previous positions.
The Russian forces rained down artillery and mortar shells, many of
them striking the area around the Minutka roundabout in central Grozny.
But two weeks after Russian forces seized the central presidential
palace, then seen as the symbol of Chechen resistance, they seem as far
away as ever from gaining full control of the city.
''There was no reason to keep the palace. We gave it up -- if we had
stayed there it would have become a tomb,'' said Chechen fighter
Deinubah Taramov, sheltering not far from Minutka.
''We can last as long as we have bullets, we can last half a year,''
he declared.
Russian troops said they had crossed Grozny's Sunzha river,
establishing a bridgehead in an area long controlled by Chechen
fighters. But a Chechen commander told the Interfax news agency the
claims were false.
Thousands of Russians and Chechens have died since President Boris
Yeltsin sent troops into the rebel region on December 11 to crush its
three-year independence bid.
Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev, whose troops are fighting the
rebels, went into hospital for routine medical checks, a ministry
spokeswoman said today.
She declined to give any details. There were no indications that
Grachev, strongly criticised for mishandling the crisis, was about to be
removed by the president.
Yeltsin said last week that the military stage of the Chechnya
operation, masterminded by Grachev, was over and it was now up to
Interior Ministry forces to handle the crisis. He named a police
general, Alexander Kulikov, as chief coordinator of the campaign.
The protracted struggle seemed set to spoil Yeltsin's 64th birthday
party today.
''That's the sound of Yeltsin celebrating his birthday,'' said fighter
Minkil Erbubov, himself marking his 34th birthday with Taramov and a
dozen other rebels.
Many houses in the area were burning but some people, many of them
elderly and sick, still huddled in dark cellars. Some had been there for
two months without gas, light or heating.
Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev has become Russia's public enemy
number one in official circles. He is portrayed as a rebel who led his
people into a fruitless war and allowed his region to become a haven for
criminals.
Today, Interfax said Russian prosecutors had issued an arrest warrant
and drawn up treason charges against Dudayev.--Reuter.

FRESH allegations about the activities of Scottish Homes were made in
the Commons last night by Labour MP Michael Martin.
He claimed that an organisation called Gemini -- which he alleged had
been set up by Scottish Homes' officials -- was seeking to get its hands
on properties in the Glasgow area, stretching from Westercommon in
Maryhill to Rutherglen and Cambuslang.
Tenants were being told this was the best way forward, but Mr Martin,
MP for Glasgow Springburn, was anxious that in any ballot on their
future tenants should be allowed to choose to remain with Scottish Homes
rather than another landlord.
Mr Martin's comments, made in a late- night Commons debate, come after
a call by Labour last week for the resignation of the board of Scottish
Homes in the wake of what Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson
said were ''repeated and failed attempts to persuade its members to
allow tenants the choice of their own locally elected councils as
alternative landlords.''
For the Government, Scottish Office Minister Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton said: ''On management bids, it should be noted that of
the 18 proposals for transfer approved by the Secretary of State, only
one has involved a management bid.
''Scottish Homes' procedures ensure that all bids are treated
objectively and even-handedly. The important point is that tenants
should be aware of all options open to them and ultimately it is for
tenants to choose.''
Labour has chosen what it describes as the ''housing quango'' to be
the subject of debate in the Scottish Grand Committee on February 13.

Sarajevo, Wednesday
UN trucks drove across Sarajevo airport into the Bosnian capital today
for the first time in six months after Bosnian Serbs allowed the supply
route to reopen to United Nations and relief agencies.
But the Serbs, who had closed all traffic over the so-called ''blue
routes'' since last July after an attack on a British UN convoy, refused
to allow civilian traffic safe passage.
Fighting eased between Bosnian government troops and Muslim rebels
allied to Serbs in the northwestern Bosnian enclave of Bihac, scene of
the worst clashes since a shaky ceasefire began across the former
Yugoslav republic on January 1.
The UN said the Croatian Serbs backing the rebel Muslims in Bihac were
now pursuing a systematic policy of intervention despite promises to
withdraw.
UN peacekeepers delivered scores of sick or wounded people to a
hospital in Sarajevo today after evacuating them from the eastern Bosnia
enclave of Gorazde.
The agreement to allow eight humanitarian groups to use roads across
the UN-controlled airport was reached in eight hours of heated talks
between Bosnian government and Serb officials yesterday.
Three of the trucks which crossed today carried badly-needed firewood
for residents of the city, gripped by winter cold.
Two others took glass and timber for a UN-sponsored reconstruction
project, a UN spokeswoman said.
The Muslim-led government said the Serb decision to renege on an
earlier agreement permitting civilian traffic threatened to derail the
ceasefire accord signed by both sides on December 31.--Reuter.

AVERAGE annual housing costs for the typical home-owner in Scotland
will have risen by almost #800 -- 26% -- this year compared with last,
as interest rate rises and the Government's mortgage and tax reforms
begin to bite, Labour claimed yesterday,
Presenting an analysis of mortgage costs, Labour Front-Benchers Gordon
Brown and Donald Dewar accused the Government of betraying home owners.
Mr Brown, Shadow Chancellor, said: ''Home owners are worse off under
the Tories.''
According to Labour's Scottish figures, an average annual mortgage
cost of #2921 would increase by #780.52 or 26.7%, by October once higher
interest rates, the cut in mortgage tax relief to 15%, and the
Government's proposed requirement for a mortgage insurance premium are
added on.
Shadow Social Security Secretary Donald Dewar warned that
repossessions in Scotland would increase.

NORTHERN Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew tried last night to calm
fears among Unionists over the future of the peace process in the
Province. There was, he said, a ''triple-lock'' of parties, people and
Parliament against the imposition of any deal on the people of Northern
Ireland.
Answering an emergency question in the Commons, Sir Patrick rejected
reports that the Government would propose arrangements for joint
authority over the running of the affairs of Northern Ireland.
He attacked claims that proposals had been drawn up which could pave
the way to a united Ireland as ''distorting leaks'' calculated to
destabilise and destroy the sensitive peace process.
He insisted that consent was the key to reaching an agreement and that
any document, even if agreed, would simply be offered to the Northern
Ireland parties and would not be some blueprint to be imposed.
''They could accept it, they could reject it, they could amend it or
adapt it,'' he said. ''But at least we hope they would sit down again
together and discuss the issues in it.''
Sir Patrick understandably faced a hostile reception from Unionist
MPs. Ulster Unionist Party leader James Molyneaux said he had been told
on December 1 that a framework document did not exist, yet the Times
newspaper report (which provoked the latest controversy) apparently was
based on a document dated November 25.
Mr Molyneaux demanded: ''Why were the Ulster political representatives
denied the opportunity to at least inject some degree of common sense
and realism into the thinking of an obscure liaison group consisting of
British and Irish civil servants, who are not terribly interested in the
fate of political parties or governments?''
He claimed: ''The disclosures -- I use the plural because they have
been leaked out and disclosed over a period of weeks -- have made
irrelevant the post-publication consultations we were promised and have
thereby wrecked the framework concept.''
In the light of that, he said, would Sir Patrick now heed his advice
to initiate discussions with representatives of the four main
constitutional parties on ''how we clear away the debris and then start
building on structures based on democratic principles?''
Democratic Unionist leader Ian Paisley said the contents of the leaked
document had not been challenged, just the interpretation of them.
Given Mr Molyneaux's comments, he said: ''How do you think this
document now is going to be a basis for any discussion, let alone
agreement? This document is an insult to the majority of people of
Northern Ireland.
''It bears out all I have been saying consistently in all this
controversy. You cannot sit down at a table if that is going to be on
the agenda. That is the price you are paying to get a deal with Gerry
Adams and the IRA and Dublin.''
Sir Patrick told him: ''You revert to a familiar line of yours, that
there has been a deal with Gerry Adams and the IRA. I reiterate there is
no such deal.
''What I have seen in the Times is a few selectively lifted phrases
from a very long document that has beeen used in these negotiations and
not agreed. I reiterate that absolutely nothing will come forward for
the approval of the people of Northern Ireland in a referendum unless
and until it has the broad and wide agreement of the political parties,
which will include your own.''
The deputy leader of the ntionalist SDLP, Mr Seamus Mallon, said:
''This leak shows there is a fairly cynical game being played. It is
also a very deadly game, because what is at stake is the peace that has
been created painstakingly in Northern Ireland, not least by Mr Major
himself.
''Could you give us an assurance that the peace process will not be
derailed, either trhough threat or force of arms in Northern Ireland, or
threat of electoral strength within this House?
''We all have vetoes, and if we all use those vetoes there simply is
not going to be a solution to our problem.''
Sir Patrick told him: ''There must be no derailment of the peace
process. This offers the people of Ireland the best prospect of a
permanent ending of violence, of the instability that has plagued them
for generations, and it has to be preserved.''
Democratic Unionist the Rev William McCrea (Mid Ulster) said: ''Why
doesn't the Government come out today and state, unequivocally they
desire Northern Ireland and would not countenance any change in the
position of Northern Ireland as an intregral part of the UK?''
Mr David Trimble (Upper Bann -- UUP) challenged Sir Patrick: ''It is
totally disingenuous to say that there is going to be no joint
authority.
''Your failure, in your previous contacts and today, to be frank,
particularly your prevarication to Mr Molyneaux, robs you of
credibility.''
Throughout the exchanges, Sir Patrick made clear that nothing would
change in Northern Ireland without the consent of the people .
He said: ''We have not yet reached agreement on a framework document
to offer to the parties. Both Governments hope, and earnestly hope, that
we can reach agreement, but consent will be the key.''
For Labour, Shadow Northern Ireland SecretaryMo Mowlam said Labour had
fully supported the Government's efforts through the peace process, a
processs which might at times seem fragile but which still offered the
best hope for a generation to the people of Northern Ireland.
''There is always a risk when there is selective leaking of any
document that the impression given by the way it is leaked is far worse
than the actual contents. I would therefore urge all parties to wait and
study what is actually being proposed, rather than selective
interpretation of it.
She said the framework document had to respond fairly to both
traditions in Northern Ireland, and she called for an assurance that the
consent of the majority would be the guarantee of a balanced
constitutional settlement.
The SNP's parliamentary group leader, Mrs Margaret Ewing, emphasised
her party's continuing support for the Government in its attempts to
reach a peace settlement, and urged the Minister: ''Don't sacrifice
tomorrow's lasting peace because of today's headlines.''
Mr Alan Beith, for the Liberal Democrats, assured the Government that,
despite its precarious parliamentary arithmetic, it had the support of
''a very substantial majority of MPs'' on this issue.
Mr Dennis Canavan (Falkirk West -- Lab.) said the peace process was
''far too important an issue to be put at risk by the threat of
blackmail from any quarter or by the Government's desire for Unionist
votes for their own self-survival''.
Mr Andrew Hunter (Basingstoke -- Con). condemned the ''scandalous
irresponsibility of the Times'' in printing extracts from a leaked
document.
However, another Tory, Mr Barry Porter (Wirral South), said he
wondered why the document had been produced at all when there were
aspects of it that were ''never going to be acceptable to those who
represent the majority of opinion in Ulster and on the mainland as
well.''

A BREAKDOWN of trust was found between the finance and the social work
departments after an inquiry by Western Isles Council.
The inquiry was into social work's #605,000 overspend on its #8.3m
budget this year.
The figures came to light last month. Around the same time it was
announced that the director of social work, Mrs Norma Macleod, had
decided to take early retirement while her assistant director, Mr
Bernard Chisholm, was negotiating terms of notice.
The social work convener, Mrs Mairi Bremner, insisted at the time that
there was no connection between the overspend and the departure of
either official. But after his inquiry the chief executive, Mr Brian
Stewart, states that Mrs Macleod had ultimate responsibility. The Herald
tried to contact Mrs Macleod but her husband said she did not wish to
comment.
Mr Stewart spoke of ''an almost complete breakdown of trust'' between
the departments. He discovered that there had been tensions for some
time. ''This breakdown was the culmination of a period of approximately
18 months of difficulties and disagreements regarding budget preparation
and monitoring.
''It is clear from interviews with staff that senior managers in the
social work department did not understand, and therefore did not accept,
the way in which their budget was constructed.
''There was a feeling, albeit without any tangible evidence, that
aspects of the budget were being manipulated to their disadvantage and
that virements were taking place without their consent between budgetary
heads, most notably Community Care to Residential Care, to mask
deficiencies in the initial budget.''
Mr Stewart has no doubt there was some justification in the social
work department's complaints about the quality of support it received
from the finance department. In particular it was unfortunate that a
different service accountant had not been allocated after Mrs Macleod
had complained last June. The director of finance, however, had no
alternative personnel.
Mr Stewart was clear where the final responsibility had lain: ''The
finance department identified the problem at an early stage and brought
it timeously to the attention of the social work department and the
council. It is equally clear that the response of the social work
department was wholly inadequate. Such remedial action as was instituted
was too little and too late, and was not sufficiently targeted at the
main problem areas to be effective.''
The council will debate the issue today.

BILL Heeps, the former chairman of Thomson Regional Newspapers, died
yesterday following complications after a heart operation.
Born in Falkirk in 1929, he began his journalistic training at 14 as a
messenger and then a reporter on the Falkirk Mail. After completing his
National Service, he returned to journalism with the Linlithgow Journal
and Gazette where he eventually became chief reporter.
After a spell with the Daily Record as a reporter and sports
sub-editor, he joined Thomson Newspapers' Evening Despatch (later
Evening News and Despatch) in Edinburgh in 1955.
In 1956 he married his first wife, Anne, and the couple had two
daughters, Elaine and Donna.
On the Edinburgh newspaper, he progressed quickly, becoming sports
editor and eventually assistant editor in 1962.
He was given his first editorship, of the Teesside Gazette in
Middlesbrough, in 1966. Two years later, he became managing director of
Celtic Press and, in 1972, returned to Thomson's Teesside centre as
managing director.
After the death of his wife in 1974, Mr Heeps was appointed managing
director of the Evening Post (Luton) and Evening Echo (Watford). He
later held similar posts with Thomson Magazines and Thomson Data before
being appointed editorial director of Thomson Regional Newspapers in
1982 and, the following year, managing director of the company.
In the same year, he married his second wife, Jennifer, and became a
stepfather to her daughter, Sarah Jane.
Mr Heeps was chairman of Thomson Regional Newspapers from 1984 until
1992 and also held the position of chief executive from 1984 until 1990.

EXCLUSIVE
DOCTORS are being offered #50 an hour to work at a hospital serving
Prime Minister John Major's constituency, in a desperate bid to prevent
the partial closure of its accident and emergency department.
In common with around 45 other British hospitals, Peterborough
Hospitals NHS Trust was still advertising two weeks ago in the British
Medical Journal for junior doctors to start work in its casualty
department.
All the contracts for these posts as senior house officers were due to
commence yesterday and last for six months. But because of a shortfall
in the number of junior doctors available, largely due to the recent cut
in the number of hours they are allowed to work, the posts remained
unfilled.
While other hospitals have warned patients of longer waits in casualty
or asked them to take all but urgent cases to their family doctors,
Peterborough decided to buy its way out of trouble.
In mid-January, with time running out and three of its six full-time
posts in accident and emergency for February 1 still unfilled, the trust
contacted 270 local GPs and all junior staff at local hospitals to offer
them #50 an hour to do the work. The normal going rate is around #10 an
hour.
Defending the move yesterday, the director of operations for
Peterborough Hospitals NHS Trust, Mr Bryan Harty, said: ''The
alternative was closing the department at night. We are half an hour
away from any other accident and emergency department.''
The action is bound to be seen as political. Peterborough lies in the
constituency of the now Transport and formerly Health Minister, Dr Brian
Mawhinney, and the hospital's catchment area takes in a large part of Mr
Major's adjoining Huntingdon constituency.
The closure of casualty services, as a direct result of what could be
seen as Government mishandling of the junior doctors' hours dispute,
would be politically embarrassing.
Mr Harty said yesterday he did not regret the move. ''As a result, our
accident and emergency is open today.''
He said the trust was still hoping to recruit junior doctors for the
work. They would be offered the accepted Whitley Council rate for the
job, he said.
Yesterday, at least half of Scottish accident and emergency
departments had vacancies for one or more senior house officers.
At the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Yorkhill, Glasgow, there were
four vacancies out of 12 posts, though two are due to be filled shortly.
Law Hospital, in Lanarkshire, has kept its casualty service going only
after local doctors rallied round and offered their service as locums.
They are not being offered enhanced rates for their services. Last week
Law had managed to fill only one of its eight SHO vacancies.

A GLASGOW University professor believes he has sniffed out the
solution to the mysterious plague of ''garlic'' bad breath afflicting
the nation's dogs and troubling their olfactorily polluted owners.
Professor Andrew Nash, of the university's vet school, began
investigating when a Troon vet asked his advice after more than 20 dog
owners had visited him complaining of the smell.
Other cases were reported elsewhere in Scotland and England.
''Very quickly we managed to cut the possible sources down to
something these dogs had eaten, as there were no other common factors,''
Professor Nash said.
Once he had the scent, he did what every self-respecting scientist
does. He experimented -- on dogs and on himself.
He explained: ''We fed the dogs between six and eight dog biscuits.
Within less than an hour, there it was. Garlic dog breath.''
Initially the trail led to just one brandbut subsequent scrabbling
convinced Professor Nash there could be a common ingredient.
The Petfood Manufacturers' Association have been informed of the
professor's findings. He advised owners: ''The most important thing to
remember is that there is absolutely nothing wrong with your dog if he
starts to smell a bit. No amount of drugs, dentistry or canine mouthwash
will help if you continue to feed him the same diet.
''If you want to treat your dog to something in addition to the normal
canned meat, then give him his carbohydrate in the form of cooked rice
or bread. Don't give him dog biscuits or snacks.''
But what of the effect of the biscuits on himself? Putting his mouth
where his mind was provided only inconclusive evidence of
halitosis-inducing tendencies, the professor claimed.
''I didn't eat that many personally, so I don't know. You'll have to
ask the people round me.''

<HEADLINE>Controllers powerless to prevent train crash</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>980058402</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
RAIL controllers knew for six minutes that two passenger trains would
crash -- but could do nothing to stop the collision which killed a
British Rail worker, it emerged yesterday.
The driver of a two-carriage Super Sprinter train which derailed on
the Settle to Carlisle line on Tuesday night flashed a danger warning to
the rail control room.
But the area was too remote and hilly for any radio message from
control to be received by the oncoming train, and there was no signal
along the stretch of line that could be activated.
Details of the warning signal dilemma emerged as an inquiry began into
the accident in which conductor Stuart Wilson, 47, from Leeds died and
26 other people were injured at Aisgill in Cumbria.
A spokesman for Cumberland Infirmary, Carlisle, said six people
remained in hospital and were ''progressing satisfactorily''. All were
now on regular wards. They had mainly suffered abdominal and lower leg
injuries.
The first train derailed after it ran into a landslip. The lead
carriage slewed on to the southbound track, immediately creating a
potential disaster.
The second train, which had just left Kirkby Stephen and was heading
into a well-known radio blackspot, was thought to be travelling at about
60mph as it ploughed into the derailed Super Sprinter.
Giving further details about the crash timetable, Aidan Nelson,
Railtrack's North-east director, said: ''At 1849 we became aware of the
initial derailment and at 1850 emergency services were alerted and
attempts were made to stop the train that was going south.
''That didn't prove possible because it had left Kirkby Stephen and we
had no radio communication.''
Lew Adams, general secretary of the train drivers' union Aslef, said:
''It is a matter of serious concern to Aslef that the drivers on these
two trains could not be contacted in time to avert the collision,
apparently because of radio blackspots on this stretch of line.
''Again, rail safety is shown to be at risk because of lack of
investment in reliable working equipment.
''It is both tragic and ironic that the lowest grade railway managers
are issued with portable phones whenever they leave their office, but
drivers do not have essential working safety equipment, especially on a
remote line like Settle to Carlisle.''

TWO drug dealers were jailed at the High Court in Aberdeen after the
biggest drug seizure by Grampian police. Thomas Pirie, 25, of Marchburn
Drive, and Keith Cowie, also 25, of Marchburn Crescent, both Aberdeen,
were each found guilty of being concerned in the supplying of heroin and
cocaine at the house at Marchburn Crescent, on September 15 last year.
Cowie was also convicted of intent to supply cannabis resin.
Jailing Cowie for seven and a half years and Pirie for seven years,
Lord Marnoch said the estimated value of the seized drugs was about
#200,000. He said Pirie seemed to be involved in financing the operation
while Cowie had allowed his house to have been used for keeping drugs.
Lord Marnoch agreed to a Crown motion in confiscating drugs and money
seized in the raid.

ALMOST as many movies were made in Scotland last year as in the
previous three years put together, according to new statistics released
by the Scottish Film Council yesterday.
In 1994 a total of 14 feature films were produced on location, mostly
in the Highlands, by American, British, German, Canadian and New Zealand
movie companies. In 1993 there were only five, in 1992 six, and in 1991
five.
Last year's figures were probably the highest ever for Scotland. They
included Michael Caton-Jones's Rob Roy and Mel Gibson's Braveheart, both
multi-million dollar movies with Hollywood backing.
Now film industry sources are privately predicting even more success
this year, particularly with the recent critical and box office success
of Shallow Grave.
Already at least three major projects have been confirmed for 1995 --
David Hayman's The Near Room; BBC Scotland's first feature film,
Easterhouse, and Trainspotting, an adaptation of Irving Welsh's novel
from the Shallow Grave team.
The SFC figures, which are contained in the first edition of its
annual publication, Scottish Screen Data Digest, show that 33 movies
have been produced in Scotland to date during the 1990s.
Thirteen of them originated in Scotland, six from elsewhere in the UK,
six from Europe, and eight from North America. Between them they have
ploughed more than #22m into the local economies.
The new document, which was launched in Glasgow yesterday, is the
first attempt to gather statistics about television and movies in
Scotland. The 39-page book covers information and analysis on
broadcasters and their audiences, the independent sector, feature films,
the work of the various strategic bodies in Scotland, the scale of
employment in the industry, and the production of commercials by
Scottish companies.
Ms Erika King, deputy director of the SFC, said: ''We really need a
reference book like this in order to assess where our position is. Here
is a substantial industry, providing a lot of jobs and a lot of money,
and we really do not know all the information about it. There is only a
limited amount that the SFC can do. The film-makers really have to help
themselves.''
The book, she said, was aimed not only at those in the film industry
but also at politicians, local authorities, and enterprise companies.
The data also examines trends in cinema attendance. The number of
picture houses in the UK fell continuously from the mid-1950s to the
mid-1980s.
Since then there has been a dramatic expansion due to the introduction
of the multiplex cinemas. In Scotland between 1987 and 1993, the number
of screens grew by almost 50% (from 1215 to 1890).
However, because of multi-skilling and technical advancements within
the industry, the number of people employed in cinemas has fallen
steadily.
In 1981, 2000 people were employed in the industry; by 1991 the figure
had dropped to just 1200. Paradoxically, film attendances have risen
dramatically in recent years. In 1989 there were eight million cinema
admissions while in 1994 there were 10 million.
Here is a substantial industry, providing a lot of jobs and a lot of
money, and we really do not know all the information about it.

GLASGOW is to press ahead with a #30,000 study on the feasibility of
re-creating the 300ft Tait's Tower which dominated the Empire Exhibition
at Bellahouston Park in 1938.
The #2m tower would, in the words of Labour leader, Councillor Patrick
Lally, provide Glasgow with a ''unique international feature''. However,
the plan has already come under attack from opposition parties.
Councillor William Aitken, leader of the council's Conservative group,
said: ''I feel it is visually and aesthetically highly displeasing. The
prospect of a massive tower dominating the south side of the city does
not appeal.''
For Militant leader, Councillor Thomas Sheridan, it was a question of
getting back to the basics of everyday life for the disadvantaged of
Glasgow.
He said: ''This is yet another waste of money, unless the tower is
intended to hold all of those councillors who have made promises to
their constituents, and broken them, in respect of new windows and
central heating.''
The original tower was demolished because it would have been an
invaluable landmark for German bombers.
It is hoped to have restaurant facilities at the base of the tower. In
addition there would be three viewing platforms, providing views 60
miles across the city.

SAFEWAY poisoner Dr Paul Agutter was jailed for 12 years yesterday
after a jury found him guilty of an evil and ingenious plot to murder
his wife.
In an attempt to cover his tracks, Agutter placed tonic bottles laced
with the deadly poison atropine on the shelves of a Safeway supermarket,
showing a callous disregard for the lives of the public.
A jury at the High Court in Edinburgh convicted 48-year-old Agutter by
a majority verdict of attempting to murder his wife Alex, 39, at their
home at Kilduff Lodge, Athelstaneford, East Lothian, on August 28 last
year by putting a massive dose of atropine in her gin and tonic.
They also convicted him, again by a majority, of placing bottles
contaminated with the poison on the shelves of the Safeway supermarket
at Hunter's Tryst, New Swanston, Edinburgh, on August 24.
A number of Safeway customers became violently ill after drinking from
the spiked bottles, and shelves had to be cleared in a nationwide safety
alert.
The Crown dropped a charge stating that he also tried to murder an
11-year-old girl at Kilduff Lodge on August 28.
Agutter showed little emotion as he was jailed by Lord Morison at the
end of an eight-day trial at the High Court in Edinburgh.
The judge told him: ''This was an evil and cunningly devised crime
which was not only designed to bring about the death of your wife, but
also caused great alarm, danger and injury to the public.
''You will go to prison for a period of 12 years.''
Agutter is understood to be considering an appeal.
Lord Morison also paid tribute to the public-spirited and responsible
action of consultant anaesthetist Dr Geoffrey Sharwood Smith, whose wife
and son became seriously ill after drinking from Safeway tonic bottles
hours after Agutter had placed them on the shelves.
Dr Sharwood Smith, who uses atropine in his work, was the first to
identify the poison and its source, and also appeared in the press and
on TV warning the public of the dangers they faced.
Defence counsel Mr Neil Murray, QC, had described the type of person
who placed poisoned tonic bottles on the supermarket shelves as
conniving, cunning, devious and evil.
After three-and-a-half hours deliberation, the jury decided that the
description fitted Agutter, a gifted biochemist who had access to
atropine in his job as a reader at Edinburgh's Napier University.
The verdict leaves a number of puzzling questions to which there are
no obvious answers. The first and most compelling is why did he do it?
According to Agutter himself and his loyal wife Alex, they had drifted
apart over the years and had accepted a completely open marriage. The
fact that Agutter had a new girlfriend, mother-of-two Carole Bonsall,
was not a problem.
Mrs Agutter, who regularly visited her husband in prison while he
awaited trial, told the court that she had met Carole and she seemed ''a
perfectly nice person''. She did not consider the new relationship was
any of her business.
But, just a week before the poisoned bottles appeared on the Safeway
shelves, Agutter told a rather different story to his GP, Dr Ross
Langlands. Dr Langlands went to see an almost incoherent Agutter after a
''suicidal'' phone call to the GP's answering service.
Agutter talked about having to take out two loans to cover debts he
was incurring after a financial deal with his wife.
According to Dr Langlands: ''I think he was generally unhappy about
the way he was being treated by his wife. He felt as if she was treating
him with some contempt.
''He felt a little bit under pressure from the lady in this (new)
relationship that he ought to leave his wife and perhaps consider
marrying her.''
These may have been the pressures that pushed Agutter over the edge.
The remains of the laced gin and tonic which he had poured for his
wife in their home on the evening of Sunday, August 28 provided crucial
evidence against Agutter.
The concentration of atropine in her drink was 292 milligrammes per
litre, compared with 103mg in the bottle of tonic Agutter had bought at
Safeway the previous Wednesday and poured into his wife's gin. The
obvious explanation was that the poison had been added directly to his
wife's drink.
Why did Agutter not simply pour the drink down the sink?
It was a fatal mistake which the prosecution was able to exploit,
thanks to the vigilance of ambulanceman James Rudyj, who was called to
Kilduff Lodge to deal with a case of suspected poisoning.
The ambulanceman established that the remainder of Mrs Agutter's drink
had not been poured away, and told Agutter that he would have to take it
away with him for analysis.
Mr Rudyj recounted how, until that moment, Agutter had appeared calm
and collected.
Although it was a summer night, Mr Rudyj and Dr Judith Richardson, the
locum who called at the house, noticed the oppressive temperature in the
living room, a heat which would have speeded up the effect of the
poison.
It was significant, too, that Agutter's call for medical help did not
indicate that his wife needed to be treated with any degree of urgency.
Another vital but puzzling piece of testimony came from a jailer at
Edinburgh Sheriff Court, who insisted that Agutter had confessed all to
him after being beaten up in the cells by fellow prisoners.
Turnkey David Hill recalled: ''He said he was guilty and had no
remorse.''

THE Prime Minister appealed to the nation last night over the heads of
Northern Ireland politicians to save the precious prospect of peace.
''For the first time in 25 years we have a real chance of achieving
this,'' he said. ''It should not be thrown away by fears that are unreal
and accusations that are untrue.''
Labour leader Tony Blair is expected to convey the same message today
in a similar broadcast, to be followed tomorrow by Liberal Democrat
leader Paddy Ashdown. The British parties appear united in their
irritation about what MPs on all sides described as a ''malicious
pre-emptive strike'' by Ulster Unionists.
Mr Major, asking for time and trust, promised the people of Northern
Ireland that their future would lie in their own hands, and told them
''there is nothing you need fear'' from the proposals.
However, Ulster Unionists on all sides last night were at least
sceptical and at worst derogatory about the broadcast.
Irish Prime Minister John Bruton welcomed Mr Major's address. He said
the Prime Minister had shown his commitment to the peace process and
negotiations for the framework document.
With lives at stake after the blessing of a ceasefire, now about to
run into its fifth month, the insidious sectarian actions to leak
damaging parts of the draft document is considered at Westminster as
outrageous. The finger is being pointed at some Ulster Unionists for
this action which forced the Northern Ireland Secretary, Sir Patrick
Mayhew, to make a statement in the Commons and the Prime Minister to
broadcast to the nation.
The Prime Minister said last night: ''With the Northern Ireland
parties we have discussed possible new arrangements for Government
within the Province. We are now discussing proposals with the Irish
Government in what we call a Joint Framework Document. These talks
continue.
''I can't guarantee their success. But fears have been raised that the
document will be a blueprint to impose unity in all Ireland and a
betrayal of the promises we have made.
''Those fears are wrong in every respect. I want to explain why,
because peace in Northern Ireland is too important to be put at risk.
Nothing is going to be imposed on Northern Ireland. Peace cannot be
secured by coercion. New arrangements will only work if they are agreed
by the people of Northern Irleand -- supported by them and operated by
them.''
The London/Dublin Framework Document will be a consultation paper, he
said. ''Its sole purpose is to help the constitutional parties reach
agreement. When they do, that will not be the end of the story. The
outcome will be put to the people of Northern Ireland in a referendum.
If they agree with it they'll vote for it: if they don't they'll reject
it. In either event their future will lie in their hands, and we will
respect their decisions.''
Any new North-South bodies must be accountable to the people of
Northern Ireland, the Prime Minister promised. ''They will not be run by
London, and they cannot and will not be over-ridden by the British and
Irish Governments.''
He appealed to the people of Northern Ireland: ''Judge our proposals
as a whole: there is nothing you need fear.'' After five months of peace
it is time to look ahead. He warned: ''If there are people who don't
want the talks to succeed they should be clear about the consequences.''
Mr Major was urging patience and understanding. He wants: ''Arms
decommissioned. Talks going ahead. Every honourable avenue to a
settlement explored. Then the outcome put to the people.'' He asked for
time and trust. Northern Ireland alone has to decide when the time comes
''whether fear can give way to hope''.
Last night trust appeared in short supply from the Ulster Unionists at
least. The Rev Ian Paisley, head of the Democratic Unionists, walked out
of BBC's Newsnight programme in the middle of a discussion on the
situation.
The chair occupied by Mr Paisley, who had earlier said he could not
trust Mr Major, was seen to be empty as the studio camera panned away
from a live link with former Northern Ireland Minister Michael Mates. Mr
Mates had been condemning the Unionist position on talks.
Ulster Unionist MP John Taylor, who had been sitting next to Mr
Paisley, said: ''Mr Paisley has already walked off the programme. That
emphasises the feeling of some people in Northern Ireland about this
document.''
DUP deputy leader, Mr Peter Robinson, said: ''The people of Northern
Ireland tonight saw the spectacle of a Prime Minister attempting to soft
soap and chloroform the people of Northern Ireland: it was cant and
hypocrisy.''
Ulster Unionist MP William Ross told Irish television: ''There is no
chance of the Ulster Unionist population accepting one jot of it (the
framework document), therefore the framework process is dead and
buried.''
However, Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams urged the British and Irish
Prime Ministers to ''seize the initiative by moving quickly to all-party
peace talks''.
He said the leaking of the document was obviously intended to damage
the peace process. ''The Orange card is being played once again. This is
unacceptable.'' He said Mr Major ''must abandon his pan-Unionist
alliance''. It was widely accepted a lasting peace would require
fundamental constitutional and political change, he said.
Various Ulster Unionists like Mr David Trimble warned they might
withdraw their support from the Government to force a General Election.
But significantly the key player from the North in this historic Irish
negotiation.
Mr James Molyneaux, was detaching himself from the leak uproar. He
said: ''We are not in the business of terminating the life of a
Parliament prematurely simply because a team of four or six civil
servants have been permitted to run amok.''
The Prime Minister talked to Mr Molyneaux yesterday after he had
summoned a unique midnight meeting on Tuesday of between 60 and 100 Tory
Ministers and back benchers in his room at the Commons.
At that meeting, as reported in The Herald, Mr Major promised a
statement to the Commons by Sir Patrick and a broadcast to the nation to
counteract what he sees as a deliberate attempt to sabotage the peace
negotiations.
These were due to come to fruition within a month: after this crisis,
Mr Major and Mr Bruton may seek to reach quicker agreement.
The selective leak, which implied Britain had conceded astonishing
arguments to Irish republicans, was vigorously denied by Sir Patrick in
the Commons and by No 10.
Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the nationalist SDLP said the leak
was a pre-emptive strike, part of a ''deadly game''. He added: ''What we
are talking about is developing a process of peace and that means we are
talking about keeping people alive in Northern Ireland.''
However, if the leak were part of a pre-emptive strike by the Ulster
Unionists, the reality of the situation is that they have achieved by
political manoeuvring promises set in stone by Mr Major and Sir Patrick,
who declared in the Commons there would be no joint cross-border
institutions imposed by London or Dublin.

A BOOKLET which gives Edinburgh's homeless advice on begging and
prostitution was yesterday described as ''a misuse of public funds'' by
a Kirk leader.
The booklet, entitled A Guide to Surviving the Streets of Edinburgh,
cost #3000 and was produced by the Edinburgh Streetwork Project, which
helps the city's homeless and hungry and receives funding from Lothian
region and Lothian Health.
Among the book's recommendations are:
* Begging -- If you beg, the best times are first thing in the
morning, lunch-time and tea-time, when people are on their way to or
from work, and at busy shopfronts and street corners.
* Prostitution -- If you do, use condoms. Don't do anything you don't
want to, work out prices beforehand and don't let the punter know you
have a drug problem in case he exploits you.
Last night, a spokesman for Lothian Health admitted that it gave
funding to the project for its work, but declined to comment further.
But the Rev Bill Wallace, convener of the Church of Scotland's Board
of Social Responsibility, said: ''It seems a complete misuse of public
funds.''
He added: ''I believe that any money should be spent on getting these
young people off the streets and into permanent accommodation, and not
encouraging them to remain out on the streets.''
Councillor Tom Ponton, Conservative group leader on the regional
council, said that the advice in the booklet was being given at a time
when Edinburgh had 1600 empty council houses.
He added: ''When funding was first raised, last year, at the social
work committee, it was to go to producing a booklet advising homeless
young people. The advice on prostitution has dangerous implications in
that it could encourage prostitution.''
Mr John Chant, director of the social work department, said that
although it had helped fund the book it had no direct control over its
editorial.
He added: ''It appears designed to help homeless young people,
although in some very frank terms. It does not in any sense promote drug
abuse, begging, and prostitution. How to minimise harm could be the
lesser of two evils.''

A GIANT wheel based on the technology of the ancient Greeks may be
built at Falkirk to link the Forth and Clyde Canal with the Union Canal
as part of the British Waterways Board's plan to create a navigable
canal corridor across Central Scotland.
A public meeting in Falkirk will tonight be told of plans to create
''a new Scottish landmark of international significance for the next
century'' as part of the board's proposals for what it has christened
''the millennium link'' -- the restoration of the canal link between
Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Under the proposal, which is dependent on being one of the dozen
projects that receives multi-million pound funding from the Millennium
Fund, a 25m high wheel -- the height of a nine-storey building -- would
be built at the Falkirk Canal Interchange at Roughcastle, to the west of
Falkirk, to transfer boats from one canal to the other.
The design for the wheel, produced by Mr Ric Russell, of Nicol Russell
architects in Dundee, would be an engineering feat never before
attempted and would involve tunnelling under the Antonine Wall. Hotel,
leisure, visitor centre developments, and housing alongside the wheel
are also being proposed.
The canals were originally linked by a series of lock-gates which took
a day to negotiate.
''The intention here is to make the transfer as quick as 15 minutes,''
said Mr Russell.
He described the concept of the wheel: ''Imagine a water-wheel such as
you would have on a flour-mill, and imagine that attached to the water
wheel you would have something similar to a Ferris wheel at a
fairground. The notion is based on the idea that comes from the original
noria -- a Greek word -- which was devised in the days of Philo.
''It was based on the water-wheel principle for lifting water
continuously from a low level to a high level.
''Containers were strapped to the outside edge of a wheel and the flow
current of the water in the river below turned the wheel and lifted the
water from the lower level to the higher level to irrigate the land.''
The millennium wheel concept would involve floating a boat on to a
cylindrical type of tray full of water. The boat would then proceed
through an automatic lock into a longer container, shutting off the
canal water and the container and boat would be brought down to the
lower canal where the boat would float out. A boat could be moved from
the lower to the upper canal using the same method. The wheel would
probably be powered by water-generated electricity.
Mr Jim Stirling, project manager for the British Waterways Board,
said: ''The millennium link is about turning industrial heritage into a
national asset for the people of Central Scotland -- a forward-looking
project to deliver significant economic and environmental benefits, as
well as to build a new landmark for the next millennium.
''It is that link between past and future that is so exciting -- to
take an under-utilised asset and . . . unlock its enormous potential in
terms of employment, tourism and leisure, and environmental
improvement.''
In addition, the millennium link project team has commissioned
regeneration studies for three areas on the canals -- Wester Hailes in
Edinburgh, where the Union Canal has been filled in; Clydebank, where
the Forth and Clyde Canal is semi-derelict; and on the Forth and Clyde
Canal from Maryhill to Port Dundas.

THE Graham family, of Alexander Road, Glenrothes, are to appear in
court later this month in an attempt to overturn a ruling that they
should be evicted from their home. The hearing, before Sheriff Principal
John J. Maguire of Tayside, Central, and Fife, is due to be held at
Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court on February 16. A legal team representing
39-year-old Gordon Graham and his wife Anne, 35, will challenge on
points of law Sheriff Gail Patrick's order that Glenrothes Development
Corporation can evict them. The order was granted in December following
a 17-day hearing during which Sheriff Patrick was told of persistent
anti-social behaviour of the Grahams and some of their five children. No
attempt can made to evict them until the appeal procedure is exhausted.

<HEADLINE>Call for fiscal to face inquiry rejected</HEADLINE>

THE Lord Advocate, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, has rejected a call from
a councillor in Paisley for an independent inquiry into the handling of
cases by the procurator-fiscal's office in the town.
Councillor Paul Mack first raised concerns in 1993 over the failure to
prosecute two local men for drugs offences when the proceedings became
time barred.
A year later, he himself was fined #200 at Paisley Sheriff Court for
assaulting a former girlfriend by shaking her arm and committing a
breach of the peace. The case has affected his political career.
Councillor Mack complained bitterly about the handling of that case,
particularly the Crown's action in flying a key witness from Sweden and
back again the same day after she gave her evidence.
He claimed the fiscal's office acted with undue haste, bringing him to
court without allowing him and his solicitor adequate time to prepare
their case. It was unheard of, he also alleged, for witnesses to be
flown from abroad for a minor, summary case.
The concerns were taken up by Mr Allan Stewart, MP for Eastwood and a
Scottish Office Minister, whose constituency falls within the remit of
the Paisley fiscal. He is understood to have expressed concern about the
case.
Lord Rodger said yesterday in a statement that he did not accept that
there was a need for an inquiry. The two drug cases were isolated
examples arising out of failures in systems in place in a busy office,
he said.
Councillor Mack had received a full reply from the Crown Agent and new
procedures had been put in place at Paisley.
Of Councillor Mack's own case, the Lord Advocate said: ''His case was
brought relatively speedily because it was understood that an essential
witness in the case was due to return home to Sweden at an early date.
In the event she had already returned to Sweden by the time the trial
took place, and it was thus necessary for her to be flown back for the
trial.''
The case was now under appeal, making it inappropriate to comment on
its merits, but ''the prosecution had nothing to do with the fact that
Councillor Mack had complained about the procurator-fiscal,'' said the
Lord Advocate.
''But because of that fact, and in order to ensure that justice was
seen to be done, the decision on criminal proceedings was referred to
Crown counsel and the prosecution was undertaken by a depute fiscal from
another office.''

THE Labour councillor who has been instrumental in developing
Edinburgh's gap sites and creating the Gyle centre has surprised
colleagues by deciding not to seek election to the new single-tier city
council.
Councillor George Kerevan, an economics lecturer who has been chairman
of the economic development committee for eight years, said he wanted to
step back a little and consider Scotland's future. Although some Labour
supporters might not want to hear it, he said, Scotland was a rich
country with one of the strongest economies in Europe.

TWO policemen were injured, one seriously, when their car crashed in
Glasgow yesterday.
The officers were in an unmarked police car going to join a pursuit of
a car when their vehicle hit a traffic light in Bearsden Road near its
junction with Ilay Avenue in the Temple area at about 6.30am.
The driver, PC Michael Sherry, was taken to the Western Infirmary
where he was detained with a broken rib and a punctured lung. His
condition was described as ''comfortable''.
The other officer, PC Kenneth Anderson, was released after treatment
for a broken rib.
Another police vehicle continued its pursuit of a Honda Civic which
had been reported to be travelling in Milngavie Road, Bearsden, without
its lights switched on.
The Honda was later abandoned in Kilmun Street in the Possil area.
It had been stolen from the grounds of the Garfield House Hotel in
Stepps on Tuesday night.
A 20-year-old man is expected to appear at Glasgow Sheriff Court today
in connection with the incident.
The northbound carriageway of Bearsden Road where the police car
crashed was closed for about 10 minutes to allow the vehicle to be
removed. Police said there was minimal disruption to traffic.
