QPR 0, Crystal Palace 1
RELEGATION-haunted Palace scrambled three vital points in a passionate
London derby. The crucial goal came in 56 minutes when Ricky Newman
swung over a corner and Iain Dowie's powerful header left Tony Roberts
helpless.
The strike came amid a revival by the south Londoners, who had started
brightly but then had to endure a QPR barrage in the 20 minutes before
half-time.
Manager Alan Smith must have had some hard words to say at the
interval, for Palace came out with more purpose -- and hung on grimly as
Rangers threw everything forward in the battle for an equaliser.

Madrid, Monday
THE settlement that ended the turbot war between Spain and Canada will
mean the loss of up to 10,000 jobs in Galicia, northwest Spain, fishing
leaders claimed today.
Leaders of the industry said that the Brussels agreement meant that
the turbot fleet of 36 trawlers in Galicia, home of Spain's Atlantic
fishing fleet, would have to be cut to about a dozen vessels.
''We calculate that the number of job losses amongst crews and related
industries will amount to 10,000. We are faced with a very bleak future
because of Canada's illegal aggression in international waters and the
lack of support in confronting it by the EU,'' said a trawler spokesman.
Today Spain's ''Grand Old Man of the Right,'' Manuel Fraga Iribarne,
the president of the autonomous Galician government, sent a letter to Mr
David Brighty, the British ambassador in Madrid, expressing his anger at
the UK's support for Canada.
Mr Fraga, a former Spanish ambassador to London and later a
post-Franco Interior Minister who founded the conservative Popular
Party, wrote of his ''surprise and disgust at having to live during the
past few days the sad experience of the lack of support of the British
Government''.
Fraga also resigned his post as vice-president of the Spanish-British
Society which he had helped to found.
Today, El Pais, Spain's leading newspaper, warned that the agreement
with Canada had put the Galician fishermen on ''a war footing'' and that
there could be further clashes off Newfoundland.
The Spanish press heavily criticised the Socialist government for not
opposing the agreement.
El Pais said: ''What's for sure is that it was Canada that provoked
the conflict and resorted to illegal methods with the intention of
forcing negotiations.
''These negotiations went forward on their conditions and this is
their victory.''
The conservative ABC, under the headline: ''Fishing in mourning'',
said that the turbot agreement ''signifies purely and simply a
humiliating and painful defeat for Spanish interests''.
The independent El Mundo warned: ''The euphoric Canadian Fishing
Minister, Brian Tobin, has announced that he will try to force through
similar agreements for the rest of the fishing grounds close to their
coasts.''

BACK at the start of this arduous League campaign, back in the summer
months when it all began, the Motherwell-Aberdeen game which goes on
tonight at Fir Park, would have been looked on as a possible European
place decider.
No-one would ever have foreseen that the Pittodrie team would be
arriving in Lanarkshire looking for a victory which would lift them from
the bottom of the table and, perhaps, catapult them to safety from
relegation.
That, though, is the script for tonight. Strangely enough, at Firhill,
there is the same sense of bewilderment surrounding the fight for
survival between Partick Thistle and Dundee United.
Thistle were always expected to be in the dogfight at the bottom.
That's the way things are at Firhill and no-one expects anything else.
But United? They won the Scottish Cup last season, less than a year ago,
and now they find themselves second bottom, trailing Thistle by four
points and knowing that only victory can give them hope of premier
division survival.
At Fir Park, the additional irony is that Motherwell are now under
manager Alex McLeish, one of the rocks upon which those glory days at
Pittodrie were founded.
In essence, McLeish, if he guides his team to a win tonight, could now
condemn to the first division the club he served for so long.
It is something which McLeish accepts. But as the consummate
professional he always has been it is also something he will not allow
to interfere with his current task.
McLeish was able to enjoy more glory than most of Scotland's managers
in Europe last season. His team's immense effort against Borussia
Dortmund won them respect on the Continent while the other Scottish
sides dropped like flies at their first European attempt.
He wants more of that, and if Aberdeen have to suffer a serious defeat
as Motherwell march towards Europe again then so be it.
As McLeish said yesterday: ''I was not happy with the way we lost
goals at the weekend against Falkirk. I spelled that out to them
afterwards. There was no heated discussion, I just made my points.
''But I also told them that if they wanted to be in Europe again next
year instead of sitting at home fiddling about the satellite stations to
see the midweek games then they had to get back to winning.
''There was some little consolation with Hibs and Celtic both losing,
but we cannot look at other teams. We have to look to ourselves and the
only way we can make sure that we will be playing in the UEFA Cup next
season again is by winning from now until the end of the season.
''I'm not ready to name a team today. I have to talk to the players
about that first, but we do have Eddie May available again after injury
which allows us another option.''
Aberdeen have been lifted by their win over Celtic, their one brief
ray of hope in recent games. They will play the team which won at
Pittodrie and that decision was made easier for caretaker manager Roy
Aitken when John Inglis failed a fitness test on the hamstring injury
which kept him out of the weekend game and allowed Brian Irvine to make
a scoring comeback.
Aitken said: ''It has annoyed all of us here to be written off as
being gutless and lacking in the battling qualities which are needed in
our present situation.
''I have never doubted my players' will to win and when we prove
people wrong it will make things all the sweeter.
''The victory against Celtic has given everyone a great boost at the
club, and if we can win our last four games then the very worst that
would happen to this club is to be involved in the play-offs.''
At Firhill, the tension will be just as great -- though yesterday it
was all so different.
Thistle manager John Lambie excused his players training and took the
day off himself. He explained: ''It's a time to stay calm. We know what
is required here and we don't have to emphasise that to the players.
''Dundee United will come here looking for the victory they need --
but we need it too. The lads know we have to get the three points. Our
only injury problem is that Kevin McKee will miss the game with a
shoulder injury.''
Meanwhile, at Tannadice new manager Billy Kirkwood, who could have
been sipping champagne at Ibrox on Sunday if he had remained at Rangers,
was delighted that he will see skipper Maurice Malpas back in action.
''We need his experience in this one,'' he said yesterday, ''and we
also have to look for something extra from the experienced players who
will be suspended after this match and won't play again this season.
''Dave Bowman, Billy McKinlay, and Brian Welsh all face suspension and
I want to see them do something a little bit special in this game.
''What we have to do is match the work-rate of the Thistle players.
There is no doubt in my mind that it is the way they battle for each
other that has given them their recent run of success.
''But if we can do that ourselves, equal them in that aspect of the
game, then our players should be able to assert themselves and give us
the win we need, and it is a win we want. It would be so important to us
if that happened.''
Kirkwood may make changes, but he won't reveal them until just before
the game. United will again fund transport for their official
supporters' club, and Kirkwood emphasised last night how important the
backing of the fans could be.
''Firhill has never been a great ground for us,'' he admitted. ''But
if the fans are behind us and in these circumstances I don't think that
is going to count for too much. It is what is at stake now, not what has
happened in the past, which is going to count.''

FIVE players and a coach were sent off and nine players shown the
yellow card in a brutal derby match in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Botafogo beat Flamengo 1-0, striker Guga coming on as a substitute,
scoring the winner, and joining the dismissals all within 10 minutes.
Also red-carded were Botafogo's Jefferson and Gottardo, along with
Flamengo's Fabinho and Valber. Flamengo coach Vanderley Luxemburgo was
sent off for dissent.
The result put Botafogo three points ahead of Flamengo at the top of
the final stages of the Rio de Janeiro championship.

which reduces the lead of Kenny Dalglish's Rovers to five points over
Manchester United with four matches to go in the English Premiership.
Said Dalglish: ''That was the first time we've lost in 11 games so
obviously it was a bit of a blow, but everybody else would want to be in

SCOTLAND coach Allan Turner calls his final session at Jordanhill next
weekend before naming his senior men's squad for next month's European
Championship qualifying tournament in Lugano, and he could be about to
spring one or two surprises.
In Switzerland, Scotland face the hosts, Rumania, Portugal, Austria,
Iceland, and Cyprus in an exhausting six-matches-in-seven-days schedule.
Three teams will go through to the Challenge Round.
Turner, the former Cumnock club coach, who currently has no senior
club team under his wing, will have to do without two of the best
shooters in the Scottish League as both Glasgow Brightsiders' Alan
Kiddie and Edinburgh Burger Kings' Derek Frame are out injured.
Two of his former Cumnock players, Marshall Muirhead and Douglas
''Diesel'' McCormick, both of whom have been playing in England, joined
last Sunday's session at the Kelvin Hall, which attracted 16 players in
all.
The problem area is the guard spot and Turner could be about to spring
a surprise by naming Paisley hustler Fraser Birch for his first cap.
Turner is now looking for English club teams to provide warm-up
opposition.

AUDREY Cooper is looking out her passport for a 10-month
globe-trotting trip which she hopes will end with a place at next
summer's Olympic Games in Atlanta.
Scotland's beach volleyball specialist hopes to be there when the
offshoot of the indoor game makes its Olympic debut as a full medal
sport.
Along with English partner Amanda Glover, she has to play in a number
of tournaments all over the world from next month, including America,
Chile, Japan, and Indonesia.
Her aim is to amass world-ranking points to enable her to gain entry
to the World Championships in Rio next February, which will act as the
qualifying tournament for the Olympics.
''It's not as if it's your best five tournaments that count; it is the
teams that have the most ranking points,'' explained Cooper. ''The more
tournaments we play in, the more points we can get.''
Cooper and Glover hope to secure a major sponsor to help them on their
travels and Cooper estimates it will cost #25,000 for them to travel to
every tournament.
Ranked No.15 in the world at present, the British pair will make their
first appearance of the season in Florida from May 5 to 7.

WHEN the rain finally arrived for real at Chester-le-Street yesterday,
somebody suggested the elements had saved Durham from the embarrassment
of losing, having set Scotland a massive 300 to beat in the first of
two, one-day contests.
The remark was, of course, tongue in cheek -- with more than a bit of
cheek involved -- as the Scots rocked with their total on just 16 with
three wickets down.
Today, the Scots will have first use of the wicket. But it would be
wishful thinking indeed to believe that they would follow the lead set
by the senior county yesterday.
The Scots' attack, especially the seam bowlers, were savaged as
Durham's shot-makers cut loose.
Openers Wayne Larkins, no stranger to the Scots on previous visits,
and Mike Roseberry, Durham's new skipper from Middlesex and making his
home debut, went on the attack from the off.
Larkins crashed his way to a quick-fire half-century, with all but two
of his 50 coming in boundaries as the former England Test batsman tore
into the Scotland pacemen, battering eleven 4s and one big 6 before he
eventually found the safe hands of Gordon McGurk at extra-cover.
That opening stand clocked up 111 runs, but any relief gained by
Larkins' departure was soon forgotten as Roseberry took up the
challenge.
Others chipped in, but it was the captain who starred, marking his
first appearance for his new county with a magnificent 127 before Kevin
Thomson ended his stay.
At the close, Durham had made 300 for six, with only Peter Steindl
earning plus points with his three for 43. That target looked a long way
off as Scots openers Steve Crawley and George Reifer strolled to the
middle -- and Crawley was soon strolling back.
The hard-hitting West Lothian man lasted just five balls before he
mistimed a drive and holed out at mid-off, Jon Wood the triumphant
bowler. Nought for one.
In his next over, there was more success for the Durham new-ball
bowler, with Gordon McGurk being pouched by Roseberry. Nought for two.
Reifer made six before going leg before, leaving the visitors looking
to the skies for either inspiration or intervention. It was the latter
that arrived first, the drizzle that had fallen during the day
eventually becoming a steady shower. Scoreboard:

NORMAN McLeod came off the substitutes' bench to score two of Grange's
goals in a 3-1 play-off victory over Pocztowiec of Poland in A Division
of the European men's hockey Cup Winners cup in Cagliari, Sardinia,
yesterday.
The result ensures a place in the A Division of the championship next
season.
McLeod's first contribution came in 27 minutes when he hit the target
to cancel out a Polish score. Then, playing their best hockey of the
weekend, Grange took a firm grip thanks to a great extent to young Irish
midfield player, Andy McBride, their player of the tournament.
Donald MacFarlane missed a penalty in 50 minutes, but quickly made
amends by giving Grange the lead after an hour.
With Pocztowiec reeling, McLeod was on hand again six minutes from
time to complete a superb display by the Edinburgh men.
Indeed, had Grange played as well in their group matches, coach Mike
Gilbert is confident ''we would have returned home with a medal''.
Heriot Watt University failed to emulate Grange. In the women's event
at Groningen, Holland, they lost to Amiens of France 1-0, Delavenne
scoring five minutes from time.
Scotland's men's under-21 side also lost out by a single goal, going
down 2-1 against Belgium in Brussels to lose the three-match Test series
2-1. Results:
European Cup Winners Cup: Men -- Final: Harvestehuder 0, HDM 0
(Harvestehuder won 4-1 on penalties).
3rd / 4th play-off -- Real Polo Club 3, Teddington 2.
Classification matches -- Grange 3, Pocztowiec 1. Ekaterinburg 0,
Amsicora 0 (Ekaterinburg won 5-4 on penalties).
Women -- Final: Russelsheim 1, Slough 1 (Russelsheim won 4-2 on
penalties).
3rd / 4th play-off Groningen 1, Muckross 0.
Classification matches -- Lorenzoni 2, Tekstilshik 2 (Lorenzoni won
4-3 on penalties). Amiens 1, Heriot Watt 0.
Under-21 International -- Belgium 2, Scotland 1.

Middlesbrough striker Jan-Aage Fjortoft of cheating in the sides' 1-1
draw at Ayresome Park. Bassett also accused German forward Uwe Fuchs of
making a ''disgraceful'' tackle on a fellow professional.
Bassett said: ''Fuchs was sent off for a challenge that could have
broken Kevin Gage's leg, while Fjortoft spent the afternoon looking for
penalties and cheating. I thought their behaviour was disgraceful. We
have had some great foreign imports but they were not a good advert.''
Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson, meanwhile, hit out at referee Bill
Burns. ''As far as I was concerned it was fairly obvious that the
referee did not want us to win the game,'' claimed Robson. ''A lot of
decisions he made made sure of that.''

SCOTLAND'S John Cleland lost his lead of the British Touring Car
Championship amidst drama and chaos at Brands Hatch yesterday.
Both races had to be stopped and restarted after first-lap accidents,
and on each occasion Cleland's Vauxhall Cavalier beat the pole position
Volvo of Rickard Rydell into the first corner.
But at the start proper of the first race, Cleland's intermediate tyre
proved the wrong choice for the rain which had begun to fall just before
the race and he slid off the track and into retirement.
Rydell's team-mate, Tim Harvey, won the race.
There was more trouble for Cleland in the second race. As he and
Rydell went into the first Surtees bend they touched, sending Cleland
into the gravel trap.
He rejoined the race just as the field came round on the next lap, but
he got only as far as Paddock Bend where he discovered the incident had
dislodged a brake lining, leaving him without front brakes. Once again
he plunged into the gravel trap and retirement.
With Rydell also having lost places through the incident, Harvey again
took victory.
Another Scot who suffered bad luck was Chris Buchan from Edinburgh. He
led all the way in the Formula Vauxhall junior race only to suffer a
fuel pick-up problem on the last lap, dropping him to fourth. Results:
Round 3 -- 1, Tim Harvey (GB) (Volvo 850), 25 laps, 23min 45.55sec,
75.98mph; 2, Paul Radisich (NZ) Ford Mondeo; 3, Kelvin Burt (Ford
Mondeo); 4, David Brabham (Aus) BMW 318i: 5, Charlie Cox (Aus) (Ford
Mondeo); 6, Julius Bailey (GB) Toyota Carina.
Round 4 -- 1, Harvey 27 laps, 24min 56.63sec, 78.16mph; 2, James
Thompson (GB) Vauxhall Cavalier; 3, Rickard Rydell (Sweden) Volvo 850;
4, Burt; 5, Johnnie Cecotto (Venzuela) BMW 318i: 6, Brabham.

VOLVO driver Tim Harvey won rounds three and four of the Auto Trader
RAC British Touring Car Championship at Brands Hatch yesterday.
He triumphed in tricky wet conditions that had caused accidents which
forced both races to be red-flagged and then restarted
The first race stoppage came about when Nigel Smith spun his Vauxhall
broadside across the track on the opening lap.
The rain-delayed restart saw most of the field equipped with
intermediate tyres.
The Volvos, revelling in the increasingly wet conditions, sped into
the lead.
Harvey took the lead on lap nine, and held on to win. His victory, his
first for the Volvo team, was by a fairly comfortable 5.9sec margin over
New Zealander Paul Radisich in the leading Ford, with young Ford signing
Kelvin Burt an impressive third.
The second race was red-flagged after a potentially serious crash
between Radisich and Watts.
They clashed on the startline straight at the end of the first lap,
but neither driver was hurt.
Luckiest man on the grid for the restart was Harvey; had the race not
been stopped and restarted, he would have had to start from pit lane
after starter motor repairs delayed him.
Harvey, however, eventually seized the lead, pursued by Vauxhall
number two James Thompson, and although Thompson kept Harvey on his
toes, it was Volvo ahead of Vauxhall at the flag.
Harvey's victory elevates him to overall leadership of the
championship, with 63 points to his team-mate Rickard Rydell's 46.
Volvo leads the manufacturer's championship.

<TEXT>
PAUL Walsh threw Manchester United a title lifeline as City provided
the Ewood Park miracle Alex Ferguson had been praying for.
Alan Shearer's thirty-fifth goal of the campaign, after a dreadful
howler by Tony Coton, looked set to move Blackburn eight points clear of
the Old Trafford men with just four matches left.
Even when an astonishing decision by referee Keith Cooper handed City
a penalty which Keith Curle converted with ease, Colin Hendry's second
goal in three days put Blackburn back in front before the interval.
But Uwe Rosler's beautifully executed twenty-first goal of the season
deservedly put the relegation-threatened Maine Road side back on terms
before the hour.
With Rovers's raw nerves exposed, Walsh stroked home a rebound 19
minutes from time to hand Kenny Daglish's men only their second home
Premiership defeat of the campaign and leave them needing eight more
points from their last four outings.
Rovers' manager Kenny Dalglish said later: ''We're obviously
disappointed to have lost the match but I think on the night City
deserved to win it.
''But we wouldn't swop positions with anybody else. I think you've
just got to be sensible when you look at the position in the table and
see the position we're in.
''There's four games left but we're still five points in front and we
can't be any more positive than that. We'd have settled for that at any
time.''
Dalglish added: ''That was the first time we've lost in 11 games so
obviously it was a bit of a blow, but everybody else would want to be in
our position. I think tonight you've got to give City credit and you
wonder where they've been all season if they can put in a performance
like that.''
He denied that his side's below-par display had been a consequence of
an adverse reaction to the news that United had been held to their third
goalless home draw in four matches by Chelsea.
''I wouldn't have thought so,'' he answered when pressed on the
subject. ''It certainly didn't have any effect. You'll tell how we react
to the pressure by our results, but one defeat in 11 isn't a bad record
and we need only eight points, assuming United go on 100% until the end
of the season.''
City manager Brian Horton declared his side's display as ''the best
away from home since I came to the club''.
The Maine Road manager was rightly delighted with the all-round
display of his team although he does not believe their Premiership
future is secure yet. ''I think we probably need one more win,'' he
said.
''Alex Ferguson rang me last week to wish me good luck but he knows we
wanted to do ourselves a favour.''
If United do miss out, they will no doubt look back and reflect on the
goals that suddenly dried up. Last night was the third time in the last
four home League games that they had failed to score.
Andrei Kanchelskis and Eric Cantona are the club's top scorers, and
they were missing, along with the injured Lee Sharpe, Ryan Giggs, and
Roy Keane.
The burden, therefore, fell to Mark Hughes -- the only player apart
from Kanchelskis and Cantona to get into double figures -- and Andy
Cole.
However, to the frustration of a packed Old Trafford, they could not
break down a Chelsea side that defended in depth superbly.
Afterwards, and before the Blackburn game, United manager Ferguson had
said: ''If God is a United fan he's got to act now.''
* RELEGATION-haunted Crystal Palace scrambled three vital points in a
passionate London derby against QPR. The only goal came in 56 minutes
when Ricky Newman swung over a corner and Iain Dowie's powerful header
left Tony Roberts helpless.
* MANCHESTER United are 7-2 to win the Premiership title with William

ALTHOUGH the Romanians have never been the easiest of teams against
whom to fashion a stylish pattern of play, Scotland surely will seek at
Murrayfield on Saturday quick-fire action encompassing minimal stopping
time, swift continuity, and as much surprise as possible.
That is the kind of game they will encounter in the World Cup,
especially from the heavier artillery of the Southern Hemisphere and
with a quarter-final against the All Blacks a possibility.
Scotland, of course, will want to adhere to the pattern that suits
their personnel as well as the distinctive playing conditions they will
meet in South Africa. However, the recent Super 10 series has given a
clear indication of the type of action expected of New Zealand,
Australia, and South Africa aim -- aggressive and uncompromising, with
all-round speed as a vital element.
Not that there is anything novel about what they do, but simply that
everything is accomplished at such pace and with such vigour and high
skill levels as to ask searching questions even of defences advancing
like cavalry, line abreast, and augmented by fellows big enough to block
out the sun.
The most striking feature is their speed of ball transference through
fingertip passing. When this is set alongside feint runs, scissors, miss
moves and surprise appearances by uncommitted wings and full backs,
there is presented to defenders only minimal time in which to adjust to
a new target moving at pace. Thus even the Canterbury defence was torn
asunder by a Queensland move that was nothing special, other than that
all the bits and pieces were put together with such pace and accuracy.
From a scrummage the No.8 detached on the right, took his scrum half's
feed, then flicked it left to his open-side flanker, who smashed the
gain line. When he posted on the floor after contact, the ball rippled
from scrum half to stand-off to outside centre, while the inside centre
made a decoy scissors run. The outside centre then dummied a pass prior
to accelerating through a gap before putting the left wing over in the
right corner. The right wing could have scored had he been required.
The speed at which the ball passes through the hands is such an
important ingredient in welding an expansive pattern on to the use of
driving forwards. There is also the flat alignment of the handling
backs, who threaten the gain line as soon as the ball is moved from the
break-down point. Ball protection also is a prime requisite towards
quick re-delivery.
While there were cases of players deliberately falling on the wrong
side of the ball to prevent opposition clearance, there aren't as many
panheads Down Under prepared thus to put their bodies at risk. This is
because summary justice generally is meted out by the boot to anyone
potty enough to do so.
Another aspect of play Down Under that will demand sharp Scottish
focus, concentration, and awareness throughout is the wider use made of
quick throws in at lineouts, instant use of tap offence kicks, and the
number of drop goals attempted with handsome success. Frequently, when
the referee signalled an offence kick, it was taken so quickly that even
he had to shift sharpish from the mark.
Clearly, too, players Down Under appreciate the value of the drop
goal, especially in tight matches. Jannie de Beer, the Transvaal
stand-off, thumped over three beauties against Queensland, whose Paul
Kahl plonked over a couple. Against Romania, Craig Chalmers will equal
John Rutherford's record for a Scottish stand-off of 42 caps, but with
eight drop goals Chalmers is still four short of Rutherford's record
haul of 12. Still, Chalmers recorded two in the Grand Slam decider at
Twickenham, underlining his awareness and technique.
Scots are well acquainted with the heavy and unorthodox tackling of
Southern Hemisphere types and especially those from the Pacific islands,
where Scotland toured in 1993. The rib-cage is frequently the target and
any ball-carrier in a weak contact position can expect to be driven
backwards, and an attack situation thus transformed into one of retreat
defence. Hopefully, World Cup referees will reach uniformity in dealing
with players who tackle airborne opponents and with those who lift
opponents off the ground, turn them virtually upside down, then dump
them downwards.
In the World Cup, however, touch judges will have their foul-play
function and hopefully will fulfil it to the letter. That type of tackle
is dangerous and should be outlawed before a player is seriously
injured.
Hopefully, conditions at Murrayfield on Saturday will be dry and warm
to give some impression of what the South African winter will be like,
although the forthcoming Scottish sojourn in Spain should prepare the
players for the testing conditions at altitude.
Clearly nothing short of a good win will be acceptable to the Scots
but victory embracing a rich mix of all the attractive elements surely
would prove a mightly fillip to Scottish confidence in their ability to
remain upsides with the tough, skilled, crafty, and perceptive
practitioners they will encounter in Rugby Union's biggest shop window.

AMERICAN FOOTBALL: By STEVE LIVINGSTONE
THERE will be no World Bowl at Murrayfield. The Scottish Claymores'
disappointing 10-7 loss to the Barcelona Dragons in the Montjuic Olympic
Stadium yesterday dropped them to a 0-2 record and to the bottom of the
World League.
But more immediate to head coach Jim Criner is when, and how, they are
going to get their first win -- the only team out of the six still to do
so.
The game was plagued by mistakes on both sides and the Claymores
failed to convert third downs inside the red zone.
Starting quarterback Matt Blundin admitted: ''It was a bad game. We
made some bad mistakes -- I threw three interceptions and Lee Williamson
threw one. It seemed we were doing our damnedest to lose.''
Claymores looked impressive at the start when cornerback Jocelyn
Borgella intercepted quarterback Casey Weldon. Seven plays later wide
receiver Allen DeGraffenierd grabbed a 19-yard Blundin pass in Dragons'
end-zone for the game's opening touchdown.
The Scots could have been forgiven for feeling aggrieved when, on the
Dragons' next possession, Claymore's defensive lineman Mike Brandon,
looked to have recovered a fumble from Dragons' running back Lindsay
Chapman. But the officials ruled a Barcelona ball and Weldon soon moved
his team into scoring range, scrambling for 20 yards before throwing a
43-yard touchdown pass to receiver Mario Henry to tie the score.
In the second quarter, after moving the ball 60 yards to the verge of
a second touchdown, Blundin threw a miserable pass into the end-zone
which was scooped up by Barcelona defensive back Chris Crooms.
The Scots again could have felt robbed when Williamson lofted a pass
to receiver Tim Barnett for what seemed the Scots' second touchdown. He
looked to have got one foot down just inside the scoring zone but the
referee ruled the pass incomplete.
A comedy of errors ensued, with both sets of quarterbacks throwing to
the opposition.
Both teams stalled at the start of the second half and the sloppy play
continued with six changes of possession including Blundin's second and
third pass interceptions.
Barcelona kicker Scott Szeredy booted through a 37-yard field goal to
put the Dragons ahead, and ultimately deciding three-point score.
The Claymores couldn't respond on their next possession and the
Dragons took control, running out the clock 10-7 winners.
The Claymores next will travel to Frankfurt on Saturday.

DAVID Roe revealed that the fear of failure spurred him on to a 10-6
victory over Scotland's Billy Snaddon in the first round yesterday.
''I was trying like mad out there because I didn't want to lose my
top-16 spot,'' he said after having booked a meeting with Jimmy White.
Roe, who has not been beyond the second round of a ranking event this
season, began the day with a slender 5-4 lead against the world No.36
from Sauchie. Three of those frames in the opening session had been
decided on the black and another on the pink.
But the anticipated close encounter never materialised when play
resumed. After having dropped the tenth frame to Snaddon's clearance of
78, Roe won the next four to stand on the verge of victory.
He had chances to win 10-5 but lost the fifteenth frame on the black
before runs of 42 and 46 settled the contest. ''I didn't deserve to
win,'' said Snaddon. ''I had the rub of the green perhaps twice in 16
frames but I'm not complaining. I had my chances but didn't take them.''

JAMES TRAYNOR at SHEFFIELD
THE most influential names in the snooker world rallied behind Jimmy
White last night and made it clear that the 32-year-old Londoner could
not have been involved in the alleged betting coup which has marred the
opening round of the Embassy World Snooker Championship.
White's manager Barry Hearn said: ''It's been a rough season for White
and this is the last thing he needs.
''It's more disruption to what has been a very difficult season for
him.'' White, of course, only recently was given the all-clear after a
testicular cancer scare and his manager continued: ''Something is
strange with the betting, but I'd be amazed if Jimmy was involved.''
Ian Doyle, manager of world champion Stephen Hendry, said: ''Jimmy
White is like the driven snow, he is pure. I have known him for many
years and he can be a bit of a rascal, he likes to think he's Jack the
Lad, but he is an honest professional.
''On the table, he's a real gentleman and plays the game straight.''
The World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association were alerted
to irregular betting on White's first-round match against Peter
Francisco, which the Londoner won 10-2, the winning margin on which
significant sums of money were placed before the match began. The
Association were contacted by the Betting Office Licence Association.
On the table yesterday, Alan McManus answered the critics who said he
was on a downhill slide when he ended John Higgins' dream for this year.
The second favourite never came to terms with his fellow Scot or the
famous venue and slumped to a stunning 10-3 defeat.
After his exit, the 19-year-old Wishaw starlet tipped his former
practice partner to go all the way -- but not before criticising the
Crucible arena.
''I just couldn't settle,'' said the Scot, who has won three ranking
titles, including last week's British Open, in the past six months.
''I've heard a lot about the Crucible but it disappointed me. It didn't
do anything for me at all. It was too tight and I didn't fancy it.
''Maybe it's just sour grapes,'' admitted Higgins, who trailed 6-3
overnight and lost four frames in a row yesterday morning.
''I wish Alan well and this victory could give him the confidence to
go on to bigger and better things. I'm not bragging when I say he's had
the hardest game of the whole draw. I'm disappointed but there are
thousands and millions worse off than me in this world.''
McManus, 25-1 to win the title at the start of play, said that
experience had worked in his favour. ''Don't forget I've been to the
Crucible before and reached two semi-finals.
''It's hard to describe what sets the Crucible apart but the pressure
is 10-fold here no matter who you play.''
The world No.6 was never headed in the match as Higgins made a
succession of unlikely errors and was punished each time by the
24-year-old Glaswegian, who next meets either Nigel Bond or Stephen Lee.
Darren Morgan will meet Ronnie O'Sullivan in the second round after
the left-hander had a 10-3 victory over fellow Welshman Anthony Davies.
Morgan, leading 7-2 from their morning session, struggled to complete
his win over the world No.64, and took two frames only on the black as
he moved on to victory last night.
Willie Thorne came from 2-0 down to take a 5-4 lead over Thailand's
Tai Pichit into this morning's second session. But six-times world
champion Steve Davis trails Devon's Andy Hicks 6-3  when they resume
this afternoon.

THE claim by Kirkintilloch golf club to have in 65 acres of prime
sward possibly the smallest area containing 18 holes in Scotland may be
about to change in their centenary year.
As cries of ''fore'' again announce the start of the new season at the
Dunbartonshire club, negotiations are in hand to buy 33 more acres of
land adjoining the north east part of the course, which would bring the
total nearer the modern norm for a full course of between 120 and 150
acres.
The course, set against the scenic backdrop of the Campsies, has
changed little since it was extended to 18 holes in 1924, the layout
being designed by five times Open Champion James Braid.
In the modern context though, at 5269 yards Kirkintilloch is unusually
short for its par of 70. The standard scratch score is 66, meaning a
scratch player must score four birdies on what centenary chairman George
Kennedy describes as the ''par 3[1/2]s'' just to stay level.
''The fact that they put 18 holes into this area is incredible,'' he
said. ''There are three sets of holes each with fairways running
parallel, and it must have been with the will of God and a lot of
foresight that they managed it at all.''
There have, however, been problems of late. A 16-foot high rubbish tip
on top of a bog is thought to have compressed the land so that water was
re-routed on to a low-lying section containing the fourth, fifth, and
thirteenth holes.
The layout is such that if these holes were taken out of commission,
the fourteenth would probably have to go as well, and architect Graham
Taylor has already been along to take a look.
Kennedy added: ''If we are successful in buying the 33 acres, we would
be thinking of replacing these four holes and looking at ways of
reducing the congestion on other parts of the course.''
If a centenary is a time to look forward, it is also one to look back,
and the recently-published club history by local golf consultant Robert
Price notes a missed opportunity in 1963 when the club could have bought
82 acres to the east for #14,000.
The committee thought the land unsuitable and too costly, a view that
must raise a few eyebrows today.
Back now to 1925, and the extraordinary general meeting of December 3
to decide on whether to sell liquor at the club, which was just outside
what was then a dry burgh.
The vote went in favour of temperance, so the thirstier members
resigned and went across the road to form Hayston Golf Club.
The Kirkintilloch club survived, however, and 1995 is a cause for
celebration, particularly at the October 6 centenary dinner, which is
unlikely to be a dry occasion. Club president Lord Whitelaw, the former
deputy prime minister to Margaret Thatcher, is due to attend.
Lord Whitelaw played for the Kirkintilloch team as a three handicapper
in the 1950s, and went on to captain the Royal and Ancient Golf Club and
become a Walker Cup selector.
This last honour was also conferred on international player Donald
Cameron, after whom the local scratch league has been named. Along with
James Hay, another Kirkintilloch man who played for Scotland, they are
among those who more than followed the club motto ''Persevere in Hope.''
We all do.

ALTHOUGH Scotland's comprehensive 16-8 defeat of France at Bordeaux
last month was achieved against a young side, the selectors have thought
it prudent to nominate the same eight experienced players for what
should be a decidedly more rigorous examination against Sweden on May 1
and 2 at the Loch Lomond course.
The team is led by Scottish champion Hugh McKibbin and also includes
Stephen Gallacher and Gordon Sherry, who showed encouraging early-season
form by finishing first and second respectively in the recent Champion
of Champions tournament at Leven.
David Downie, the stroke-play champion, Barclay Howard, last year's J
&amp; B order of merit winner, and Graham Rankin complete the team. Since
this is a six-a-side match, Alan Reid and Allan Turnbull, who played
against France, have become reserves.
In the opposing team are Martin Erlandsson, who beat Howard but lost
to Turnbull in last season's Amateur Championship at Nairn, and Viktor
Gustavsson, who lost to Gallacher three times in two days last August in
the Britain and Ireland youths' match against Europe.
Victory, of course, would carry its own satisfaction, but wider
horizons beckon. Eight of the 10-man Walker Cup side will be chosen
after the European team championship in Belgium in June, and a place in
Scotland's team for Royal Antwerp is almost a prerequisite towards
influencing the Royal and Ancient Club's selection committee.

WALES captain Mike Hall took no part in yesterday's training session
-- on the eve of the announcement of the squad for the World Cup finals.
Hall, the Cardiff captain and centre, was forced to watch the final
workout before the new management team retreated behind closed doors to
whittle down the 35-strong training party to the 26 who will travel.
A groin injury prevented Hall taking any part, caretaker Wales coach
Alex Evans explaining: ''It is really sore, and it would have been
stupid to run him out today.''
Minor injuries to back row forward Stuart Davies and full-back Justin
Thomas meant they also sat out the session, although prop Ricky Evans,
lock Derwyn Jones, and wing Nigel Walker all took eleventh-hour chances
to prove their fitness.
Prop John Davies, whose 60-day ban expires tomorrow, is set to be
included in the squad. Davies was sent off against England on February
18 for kicking Ben Clarke.
''There are a few niggling injury worries, but nothing that will
prevent anyone from being considered for next month's tournament,''
coach Evans said.

Price falls by the wayside with a disastrous 12 at the seventeenth
Walton made to sweat by Coltart's late eagle
IRISHMAN Philip Walton put in a storming finish to win the Catalonia
Open in Girona, Spain, by three shots yesterday and gain his first
European Tour victory for five years.
Walton, who fought off strong challenges from Scotland's Andrew
Coltart and Yorkshireman Howard Clark, shot a final-round 68 to finish
on 281, seven under par with Coltart on 284 and Clark on 285.
Later Walton paid tribute to his coach Bob Torrance who spent 18 hours
with him last week advising him to widen his swing. ''I owe Bob a lot,''
said Walton after his victory. ''I've felt a different player this week,
but my victory was never as easy as the final scores suggested because
Andrew pushed me right to the final hole.''
Because of gale-force winds, only half the third round was completed
on Sunday and Walton played 30 holes yesterday in what he agreed was one
of the longest golf days of his life.
At the end of the third round yesterday morning he was second on 213,
one shot behind Clark and one ahead of Coltart and Welshman Phillip
Price.
Price soon fell away, but Coltart went out in 34, led with nine holes
to play, but had a double bogey 6 at the eleventh, allowing Walton to
take a lead he was never to lose.
The Irishman, whose only previous Tour victory was in the 1990 French
Open, birdied three in a row from the twelfth, and at this point led
Clark by three shots and Coltart by four.
But Coltart refused to give up hope, birdied the fifteenth, then had a
brilliant eagle 3 at the seventeenth to go only one shot behind.
The 24-year-old Scot, however, could manage only a bogey 5 after going
over the back of the eighteenth green in two while Walton finished with
a flourish by hitting a No.9 iron to 12 inches for a birdie 3 and the
#50,000 first prize.
Clark paid the penalty of being too defensive, hitting irons off
almost every tee but Price was the most unfortunate player.
The 28-year-old Welshman was fourth with two holes to play and looking
forward to a big cheque, but the seventeenth hole proved horrific.
After hitting a bad tee-shot, Price went from one disaster to another,
had to take three penalty shots and finished the hole with what he
thought was a 10. Later, however, he was penalised another two shots for
grounding his club in a hazard. His 12 dropped him to joint
twenty-seventh place.

DERRICK Patterson, the West Hartlepool scrum half, was named yesterday
as the A N Other in Scotland's World Cup squad in the berth that was
apparently being kept vacant for Andy Nicol.
Nicol's fight to regain match fitness came to a premature end on
Saturday when the former Scotland player sustained a medial ligament
injury in his left knee while playing for Bath reserves.
According to the SRU, Nicol will be out for at least six weeks -- a
cruel blow for a player who had worked so hard after suffering a serious
injury to his other knee in the Alloa Cup final last May.
Ironically, it was that injury which gave Patterson, 26, his place on
the Scotland tour to Argentina last summer, the consequence of which was
promotion to full cap status against South Africa in November.
At his parents' home in Hawick yesterday, Patterson said: ''I'm just
pleased the waiting is over. I can now concentrate on my playing.
''I must admit it was a bit of a shock to me when they announced an A
N Other in the World Cup squad. But it didn't dent my confidence,'' said
Patterson, who has been training at Tweedbank with the Borders-based
members of the World Cup squad.
Among the many points in Patterson's favour is that he has played in
South Africa, having spent the summer of 1992 in Durban.
Patterson, who has a quick break, admits to liking the hard grounds.
''The harder the better,'' he said. ''I like to run. In South Africa you
don't get far by kicking the ball into the air.''
Crucially, Patterson has also played at altitude. ''The first three
days are really hard. Your lungs and throat feel sore, but after two
days you can increase training significantly.''
The knock-on effect of his inclusion in the squad is the naming of
Kevin Troup as the A N Other in the tour party for Zimbabwe. Troup is
now with Patterson's old club, Edinburgh Accies, having joined in
January from London Scottish.
Like Patterson, he is a gifted sevens player, a running scrum half,
and as such should be suited to the hard grounds in Zimbabwe.
There, like his 25 colleagues, he will be on standby for the World Cup
squad in the event of injury.

SCOTLAND'S newest professional arts festival is off to a splendid
start and the people of Glasgow's South Side are lining up for its
remaining attractions.
The first-ever Artsfeast, under way in the Eastwood district, drew a
huge crowd to Sunday's opening when a spectacular fireworks display
climaxed the Scottish Chamber Orchestra's open-air concert in Eastwood
Park.
The response, according to festival organiser Michael Dale, has been
extraordinary and visitors are coming to appreciate the outdoor nature
of many of the events -- symbolic, perhaps, of Artsfeast's theme of a
welcome to spring.
''You can have a good time just dotting about the area,'' he says,
with sculptures of all kinds on show at different venues. Even the
roundabouts at Eastwood and Clarkston Tolls and at Spiersbridge have
been re-planted by artist Wendy Hardie to achieve a significant
recreation.
Yesterday's concert by jazz singer Carol Kidd drew another sell-out
crowd to Eastwood Park. There is now open speculation that Artsfeast,
launched to mark the 20th anniversary of Eastwood District Council and
to welcome the new East Renfrewshire Council, will become a biennial
feature of the Eastwood scene.
It certainly is designed to please all age groups. Families quickly
found out that they have a special place when yesterday's Lark In The
Park at Rouken Glen provided a day of street theatre, mime, sculpture,
and a Kite Extravaganza featuring no fewer than 800 kites.
Youngsters also had the chance to explore a huge structure of tunnels
and spaces, featuring magical colour and lighting effects, called the
Eggopolis, which is based at the park until 5pm today.
Today's highlights are Cappella Nova playing sacred and secular music
at St Vincent's Church in Thornliebank, the lively Csardas trio in
cabaret at Eastwood Theatre, and Dancing -- A Portrait of Margaret
Morris at Eaglesham's Montgomerie Hall.
A lunchtime delight will be old film of Scotland, including a
performance by Chic Murray on a steamer, at the Eastwood Theatre, and
Gary Marshall is hosting a Sixties Disco in the Carmichael Hall in the
evening.
Tomorrow sees an unusual and exciting event at the newly refurbished
Eastwood Pool and Recreation Centre when keyboarder Bobby Wishart leads
the award-winning Strathclyde Youth Jazz Orchestra in music by
Ellington, Corea, Basie and others.
I am told there is to be a short display of synchronised swimming
during some of the numbers, so it promises to be a cool occasion.
Meanwhile the film about singer Joseph Locke, Hear My Song, is being
shown at the Eastwood Theatre, and Tommy Truesdale and the Sundowners
are giving Country and Western fans a treat later at Eastwood House.
Thursday's highlight for most people will be Opera On A Shoestring
which will see the Eastwood Theatre ring with arias, duets, and
ensembles from composers such as Mozart, Puccini, Verdi, and Bizet. The
same venue earlier hosts a recital of Beethoven, Cassado, and Dvorak by
The Silver Duo -- a little gem of chamber music which promises to be a
lunchtime treat.
Mid-afternoon brings an opportunity to step out with the Eastwood Big
Band at a Carmichael Hall tea dance.
The accent is very much on traditional jazz the following night when
George Penman takes his Jazz Men to Eastwood House, and other beautiful
and impressive sounds will come from the Copenhagen Boys' Choir as they
open a UK tour at Giffnock South Church.
Other Friday offerings include the Glen Michael Cartoon Cavalcade Quiz
show, an Antiques Roadshow and a look at fun food as described by Robert
Burns, A A Milne, and Rabbi Lionel Blue in a musical and poetic
presentation entitled Sweet Fancy.
This one, at the Greenbank House coachhouse, has an extra attraction:
free cakes.
The weekend promises to be one to remember in Eastwood District as
Artsfeast draws to a spectacular conclusion.
Saturday has a variety of music on offer, with the works of George and
Ira Gershwin performed by Keith Smith and the Mike Pyne Band at Eastwood
Theatre. Meanwhile Glasgow Phoenix Choir is at Broom Parish Church, and
later a trio from Fife rejoicing in the name Crooked Jack are the stars
of a ceilidh at Carmichael Hall.
Sunday is, however, the big day with The Rite Of Spring getting under
way at 1pm in Rouken Glen Park and featuring a family sculpture day,
dance, music, and street theatre.
At 6.30pm, Fablevision's spectacular community theatre event really
comes alive with a show which climaxes in a procession with music,
lanterns and banners to a huge bonfire and fireworks display.
Festival organiser Michael Dale makes the point that everyone and
anyone can turn up and take part, but if they want to be rather more
involved there are preparatory workshops each day up to and including
Saturday.
These take place at Woodfarm School, across the road from the park, at
10am, 2pm and 6pm and allow people to make lanterns, costumes, and items
for the bonfire display.
But Artsfeast's outdoor attractions are there on a daily basis for all
-- the ''Artsbeast'' at Rouken Glen is on every day and provides the
chance to spot a skunk up a tree, seek out various canine creatures in
different parts of the park, and even take a trip on a transparent boat
on the pond, with sunken objects on view.
And at Greenbank Gardens, there is music and sculpture each day from
11am to 5pm, with electronic mood music setting the scene for a
presentation called Awakening.
Artsfeast has not forgotten the youngsters, either, with a full
programme of events at libraries and other venues.

POLISH Agriculture Minister Roman Jagielinski has made it clear that
his country has no desire to flood Europe with cheap foodstuffs in the
wake of its planned accession as a member of the European Union.
The experience of the last few years had rather shown the reverse
trend -- that Poland's 40 million consumers had provided a major market
for EU exporters, he told an Agra Europe conference in Warsaw.
Moreover, he said, despite trade concessions offered by the EU to
Poland the EU's agri-food exports to Poland had risen almost threefold
in recent years, while trade in the opposite direction had grown at
barely half that speed.
Mr Jagielinski, suggested, however, that Poland would in future focus
its exports on areas where it had particular natural advantage,
especially fruit and vegetables and potatoes. That comment is unlikely
to comfort EU producers of processed fruit and vegetables or potatoes,
where Polish production already amounts to well over 50% of the entire
output of the member-states of the EU.
A ministerial colleague, Ryszard Smolarek, addressed the question of
integrating the farm policies of Poland and the EU in the run-up to
accession.
He was adamant that integration could only be achieved through a
scaling down of support in the EU. ''Poland cannot afford to step up the
level of subsidies to agriculture,'' he said.
A key problem for Poland's future agricultural development was its
particularly unfavourable farm structure. Much of the country was
characterised by very small and inefficient farms, producing at barely
higher than self-sufficiency level.
The high rate of rural unemployment was hampering efforts to
rationalise these farms into larger and more profitable holdings. In the
north and west of the country many of the huge ex-state farms were
facing bankruptcy. Although a land privatisation programme was in place
there was little demand for farmland -- largely because of the lack of
agricultural credit.
EU Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler, who also addressed the
conference, rejected calls for immediate and drastic cuts in the levels
of EU agricultural support but did not close the door on further
''evolutionary'' changes to farm policy in the coming years.
One of the central elements of Common Agricultural Policy reform had
been to give farmers a long-term and stable legislative framework in
which to operate, he said.
He saw no reason why that should be consigned to the political dustbin
after just three years of operation. He stressed, however, that the
current CAP should not be seen as a permanent fixture.
First results indicated that the shift away from price support towards
direct income support had been a right decision, he said. ''We must
continue down this path in a consistent manner and we must make a shift
in emphasis -- less central intervention in the market and a more
comprehensive policy of rural development, including protection of the
environment.''
Evolution, he said, did not mean stand-still. It meant consistent and
permanent progress.
Despite public pre-occupation with market support policies, the issue
of structural development in the Central and Eastern European countries
was more important, he said. This was particularly the case in Poland
where roughly half of the two million farms had an area of five hectares
or less.

SCOTTISH Agricultural College vets fear that rabbits may be
responsible for the spread of a serious wasting disease that affects
cattle, sheep, goats and deer, writes ROY GREGOR.
They are concerned that the high incidence of Johne's disease --
paratuberculosis -- could be linked to increased rabbit populations.
The disease is a serious problem worldwide and in UK abattoirs some
carcases have been condemned although any risk to humans has not been
established.
On farms in Perthshire and Angus, a survey revealed that the disease
is more prevalent on rabbit-infested farms. More than 60% of rabbits
collected on three farms showed evidence of carrying the disease and
most of these were on farms where Johne's disease was a problem in
livestock.
Scottish Agricultural College vet Alastair Greig said the recent
survey results were only the beginning of an investigation. ''We still
have to establish whether the organism in rabbits is infectious to
cattle and sheep and whether the Perth/Angus farms are typical.
''If the infection is widespread in rabbits and the strain of
mycobacterium is the same as in cattle, then we are looking at a new
scenario as far as control of this disease is concerned. Vaccination
would be the most attractive option.''
Johne's disease is a chronic enteric disease of cattle, sheep, goats
and deer. Infection is thought to occur early in life from faeces
contamination. The college is working with the Animal Diseases Research
Association in Edinburgh on new, high-technology research projects to
investigate the link between wild rabbit populations and farm livestock.

<HEADLINE>Scottish rings on verge of moving up a gear</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A SCOTTISH network of 14 agricultural machinery rings is on the verge
of moving up a gear into something close to becoming a totally
integrated co-op, buying and selling on behalf of members, and thus
inevitably putting pressure on existing suppliers.
Discussions have been proceeding over the past few months with a view
to using all the latest computer technology so that the rings which now
cover virtually the whole of Scotland from Orkney to the South-west can
lock into each other and thus provide an enhanced level of service.
Ken Nichol, who farms at Hospitalshields, near Montrose, is
vice-chairman of the Mearns ring which has a turnover of #2.5m, and has
been appointed to head a steering committee.
Speaking yesterday, Mr Nichol said: ''We have been looking at the
possibilities of establishing a separate company which will be closely
linked to the rings to provide a wide range of farm requisites. Of
course many are already doing this to some extent as can be seen from
our collective turnover of at least #10m.''
The scope for such a venture is immense with at least 20% or over 4000
Scottish farmers now being involved in rings but Mr Nichol recognises
that there is a potential clash of loyalties.
He said: ''In certain areas there are strong farmer-owned co-ops such
as North Eastern Farmers and Central Farmers but we have been speaking
to these companies and have decided to press on.''
The Scottish rings are now ahead of the rest of Europe in that several
are now linked into the Integrated System Digital Network (ISDN). The
Borders was the first area of the UK to have a ring when, chiefly at the
instigation of its manager, the former Hawick and Scotland rugby star
Alistair Cranston, a group of progressive farmers linked up to pool
their machinery resources. That ring now straddles the border with
England having a office in Wooler and a membership of 380 and a turnover
of #1.6m.
Mr Cranston is keen to develop the concept a stage further. ''ISDN
will allow the rings to communicate better and then build up the ability
to trade between each other. We want to start the ball rolling and
certainly one advantage could be that it will allow farmers in the
islands to work with us without having to go to the expense of setting
up their own separate administrations.''
The Borders ring is probably a stage further down the co-operative
highway than most because that area lacks a powerful farmers' co-op. As
Mr Cranston explained the range of purchases available is already
extensive. ''We are buying fuel, fertilisers, tyres, building materials
and spare parts on a collective basis. I suppose that around 40% of our
turnover is in that line of business already.''
Establishing a completely computerised network will not be cheap but
the Scottish Agricultural Organisations Society is already assisting in
making approaches to the EU for grant aid under Objective Five B status.
Meanwhile several local enterprise companies have indicated that they
may be willing to be involved.
Mr Nichol, however, is keen not to rush the expectations of supporters
for this major expansion. ''Nothing is going to happen immediately and I
would expect it to be early autumn before we are able to come back with
a firm set of proposals.''

THE March retail sales figures, to be released on Friday, are the last
significant statistical indicator to be published before the Chancellor
of the Exchequer and the Governor of the Bank of England meet on May 5
to determine whether another rise in base rates is needed to check
inflationary pressures.
Unless retail sales fall off the cliff it seems likely that rates will
be raised for the fourth time since last September.
The CBI's distributive trades survey was gloomy about the state of
trade in the High Street, but it does not have a good record in
forecasting retail sales volumes.
Economists at James Capel expect to see a rise of 0.3% in retail sales
for March. This would have the effect of reducing the annual growth rate
from 2.6% in February to 2.2%.
The minutes of the meeting between the Chancellor and the Governor on
March 8 are due to be published tomorrow. Since rates were raised in
February there was no chance of the authorities giving serious
consideration to another dose of monetary medicine.
However, sterling fell sharply in February, and the minutes will be
closely studied by the pundits for indications of how much concern this
was arousing at the Treasury and the Bank.
Mad March is the most difficult month in the year to forecast the
Public Sector Borrowing Requirement. Government departments go on a
spending spree to use up their allocations before it is too late.
Capel economists have plumped for an #8000m PSBR. This is the final
month of the fiscal year. On this basis the PSBR outturn would be #33bn
against Treasury forecasts of #34.4bn to give a more modest undershoot
than at one time seemed likely.
Inevitably the outcome will arouse speculation about the scope the
Chancellor has for cutting taxes in his November Budget. The state of
the economy will also have a bearing on this, however.

THIS week's list of companies reporting their results is a quieter one
than of late but there is still plenty of interest to be generated, not
least from reborn hotel group Stakis, which will be giving an update on
its second quarter on Wednesday ahead of the interim results, expected
on June 1.
Another company of interest is department store group House of Fraser
which was floated in March 1994. Full-year results will be out on
Thursday and the share price has weakened after the company's Christmas
trading statement warned of margin erosion.
Floated at 180p, the price had fallen to 154p. City analysts, who had
been predicting profits of more than #45m at the float, have lowered
their sights to around #36m, over #2m down on the preceding year.
However, there is more confidence in the outlook now after the closure
of three poorly-performing stores and the superior performance of the
recently refurbished stores, the rising gross profit margin and the end
of the exceptional promotional spend.
The dividend total could be lifted [1/2]p to 5.5p.
SmithKline Beecham is the biggest of the week's batch. Its
first-quarter figures are expected on Thursday and brokers believe these
could be marginally ahead of #353m last time with the headline figure
boosted to #860m from the sale of Animal Heath.
Some analysts expect the quarterly dividend to be upped 0.3p to 3.3p.
The Mirror Group (also Thursday) could be set to pay a final dividend
for the first time since 1992. It paid 1p at the interim stage, the
first meaningful payment since the group was floated in 1991. NatWest
Securities' analyst considers there is likely to be a 3p payout.
Rising circulation among a number of its titles and improved
advertising could also be on the cards.
The profit figures, though, could be distorted by pension fund
provisions, leaving pre-tax profits at around #71m against #132m in
1993.
The National Lottery should have provided a boost to Havelock Europa,
another company set to unveil its full-year results on a busy Thursday.
It was chosen by lottery organiser Camelot to install booths which will
have helped profits for the year to December climb to #4m from #2.3m in
the view of Greig Middleton.

SHARES in the fast-growing acquisitive pharmaceuticals group Medeva
are likely to spurt as share markets re-open today after the Easter
holiday following the company's admission that it is holding merger
talks with Fisons.
A statement from the company yesterday said that ''talks are at an
exploratory stage and may or may not lead to an agreement''.
If they do succeed, the merger would take the form of an agreed bid by
Fisons for Medeva, whose market capitalisation is approaching #620m with
the shares at Thursday's closing level of 226p, up 6% on the week on bid
speculation.
It is thought that any successful bid would have to put a value of at
least #900m on the company. Not in the Glaxo/Wellcome pharmaceuticals
league where Glaxo's #9100m takeover was the largest in UK corporate
history, but a sizeable and important deal nonetheless if it bears
fruit.
Fisons, which has been dogged by problems in recent years, has
certainly been clearing its own decks since Stuart Wallis became chief
executive on September 1 last year -- divesting itself of those
businesses it does not consider core.
Last month it sold its research and development operations to Astra, a
Swedish rival, for #202m and this came just two weeks after the sale of
the loss-making scientific instrument business to Thermo Instruments
Systems of the US, also for #202m.
The company was also poised to sell its distribution and horticultural
businesses. Fisons, which made a pre-tax loss of #463.7m last year after
exceptional items such as a write-off #278.6m in goodwill and a charge
of #220.6m for restructuring the pharmaceutical division, will be left
as a drugs company based solely on production, sales and marketing. It
will also have a cash balance of possibly around #500m.
Medeva has seen strong growth and has benefited from the restructuring
in the pharmaceutical industry which has enabled it to acquire products
and businesses which are non-core parts of larger groups. It has
acquired products which were well developed or in the late stages of
development, keeping its own research and development spending to about
7% of sales.
The company beat City profit projections last year when it reported a
39% increase at the pre-tax level, from #46.1m to #64.2m on a 20% rise
in sales to #240m.
This was fuelled largely by strong US demand for methylphenidate, a
treatment for hyperactive and attention deficiency disorders in children
and young adults. Sales of the drug rose 89% from #35m to #66m. And the
company was able to raise the price by about 10%. Around 86% of group
overall operating profits are derived in the US.
Medeva's intention was to continue to pursue its policy of
acquisitions and alliances with major pharmaceutical firms. It bought
generic anaesthetic manufacturer Inhalon Pharmaceuticals at the year and
also made an alliance with SmithKline Beecham in vaccines.
Sector analysts had expected Medeva to produce above-average growth in
earnings per share. And there are long-term hopes for the development of
its hepatitis B vaccine Hepagene which it was felt could transform the
company into a major player.
From Fisons point of view, the acquisition of Medeva would look to be
a natural fit with its core business and provide some useful impetus.
Whether, though, at the end of the day Medeva will want to give up its
independence remains to be seen, especially if it is confident that it
can continue to succeed through its present growth formula.
On the other hand, money talks and if shareholders feel the terms are
right, then a deal could be struck. Unless, of course, there is someone
else out there that thinks Medeva might make a tasty morsel.

TWO former investment bankers with Lehman Brothers' Equity Finance
have launched their own company, Securities Finance International, to
provide independent and confidential advice about Securities Lending and
related Securities Financing businesses.
SFI will work with a range of customers including beneficial owners of
securities, agent lenders, intermediaries and proprietary traders.
Some of the largest lenders in the securities financing market place
are Scottish Life offices, such as Scottish Amicable, Scottish Equitable
and Scottish Provident, while others like Scottish Widows and Scottish
Mutual are believed to be looking into it. Standard Life has been
traditionally sceptical of its advantages.
Mark Faulkner and Charles Stopford Sackville resigned from Lehman
Brothers' Equity Finance Group last month and have established SFI to
specialise in the provision of independent advice to companies, or
considering participation, in the Securities Financing marketplace.

<TEXT>
OIL prices shot back up towards eight-month highs yesterday after Iraq
rejected a United Nations' resolution allowing some oil sales, delaying
its reappearance on the world oil market and raising pressure on other
oil supplies.
Crude oil futures in New York jumped by 65 cents to $19.80 per barrel
for May delivery. They hit an eight-month high of $20.10 last Wednesday.
The London market was closed for the Easter holiday.
''The possibility that Iraq will begin selling oil again has been
hanging like a cloud over the market for the last week,'' a trader said.
Iraq, banned from exporting oil since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
rejected a UN motion to allow it to sell $2000m worth of oil over six
months. Profits from the sales would have been used for humanitarian aid
for the Iraqi people, Gulf war reparations and UN costs.
A television station run by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's eldest
son, Uday, described the UN plan as ''a dangerous violation of Iraq's
sovereignty''.
Oil traders estimate that the UN resolution would have allowed about
700,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Iraqi oil on to the market. That would
represent a 1% increase in world supply but the psychological impact on
the market was reckoned to be far greater.
It would also have raised the question of when Iraq would be allowed
to sell more of its three million bpd capacity.

<TEXT>
PHARMACEUTICALS distributor AAH is due to make a last-ditch effort
this week to fend off a #400m hostile bid from German rival Gehe.
Crucial to the outcome will be a decision by three fund managers --
PDFM, Schroders and Threadneedle Asset Management which between them own
30% of the Lincoln-based group.
Last week the German company raised its offer from 420p to 445p a
share and at the same time through its brokers snapped up 17% of AAH in
the open market.
Analysts believe there is little chance of a rival bidder entering the
fray, partly because AAH was worth more to Gehe in view of its long-term
pan-European ambitions.
Gehe sees the UK as a natural target for expansion following its #300m
purchase in 1993 of Office Commercial Pharamceutique of France. If it
succeeds in the takeover of AAH, Gehe will command 10% of the EC
wholesale pharamceuticals market.
AAH issued a profits warning in February which accompanied news that
#3m of customers' cheques had been stolen, although most of the money
was quickly recovered.
The group's biggest problem has been its environmental services
division, which runs street sweeping, rubbish bin emptying and
grass-mowing operations for local authorities.
AAH chief executive Bill Revell blamed over-aggressive tendering on a
small number of new local authority contracts.
The group is due to announce results for the year to the end of March
in June.

Clash of cultures: Mark Fisher talks to London-based writer Rona Munro
about her new award-winning play which is taking her back to her roots
in rural Aberdeenshire
IF there is a part of London that is forever Scotland, I reckon it's
round at Rona Munro's house. For all the success the playwright has
enjoyed of late -- earning critical plaudits for the script of Ken
Loach's Ladybird Ladybird, being commissioned to do a follow-up to her
TV play Men of the Month, and picking up the lucrative Peggy Ramsay
Award for her new stage play The Maiden Stone, opening at the Hampstead
Theatre this week -- she always seems to have a wistful hankering to be
back in Scotland.
No reason to suppose she's unhappy in London, but whenever I've spoken
to her on the phone I've always got the impression she'd rather be here.
In fact it sometimes seems the only reason she sets her plays in
Scotland is to give herself the excuse to return home to do a bit of
on-the-spot research.
For instance there's another television play, due to be filmed this
year, called Bumping the Odds about loansharks, which she has set in
Glasgow (Munro's female-centred view should make an interesting contrast
to the machismo of Mike Cullen's similarly-themed The Collection which
the Traverse Theatre is putting on in Mayfest), and the one that's
really taking her back to her roots in rural Aberdeenshire is The Maiden
Stone.
Set in the early part of last century in the North-east of Scotland,
it's a play steeped in the geography, mythology and character of the
land, and also one that reflects Munro's contemporary interest in the
clash of neighbouring cultures. ''This one does put English culture in
contrast to Scottish culture,'' she says.
Writing with a Hampstead audience in mind might have influenced the
way she presented her vision of the North-east, but even without that,
the very fact of living in England has sharpened her awareness of the
cultural differences.
The play tells the story of an English actress who travels to
Scotland, carrying Shakespeare with her, only to find her fortunes peter
away as her rural audience is left unimpressed. She meets her match in a
travelling woman who roams the roads with her brood of wild children
(there are two teams of five in the rehearsals) and who shares her fund
of myths, legends and stories.
''I'm contrasting an English culture with a Scottish one and a
literary tradition with an oral tradition. And that probably was a
response to myself confronting London,'' says Munro.
It's worth remembering that in parallel to her mainstream career --
plays such as Bold Girls, recently revived both by Glasgow's Drama
Centre and by Dundee Rep, and Your Turn To Clean The Stair, an Edinburgh
close murder-mystery staged by the Traverse, as well as screen-writing
credits for Casualty and Dr Who -- Munro has been a long-time
collaborator (first as a performer now only as a writer) with Fiona
Knowles in the feminist comedy outfit they call The MsFits.
Hugely popular on the community circuit, the company presents a blend
of songs, sketches, poetry and comedy that arguably speaks more clearly
about Munro's roots in a ceilidh culture than any of her conventional
stage plays.
''It's much better now, but what you did at school ignored Scotland
altogether,'' recalls Munro, explaining how she has always been aware of
the pull of opposing cultures. ''I wasn't conscious necessarily of being
Scottish but I was completely bananas about folk tales. For a long time
they were mostly what I read and that's probably had an effect.''
The brief for The Maiden Stone, according to director Matthew Lloyd,
was for Munro to write what she wanted as long as she took the
opportunity to stretch her wings. ''She was told not to feel inhibited
and not to write something small just because it was a smallish studio
space,'' he says. ''So she came up with something that was really quite
epic in scale -- which is thrilling. It's a play that is informed by a
sense of landscape, and a landscape with so much majesty.''
On the strength of the script alone, The Maiden Stone was the first
recipient of a Peggy Ramsay Award, a #50,000 prize in memory of the
famous London actors' agent that goes towards a play's production costs.
The cash has enabled Hampstead Theatre to employ the full complement of
children as well as the adult actors -- Carol Ann Crawford, Shirley
Henderson, Paul Higgins and Alexander Morton are the Scots; Sarah Howe
and Frances Tomelty the English -- and to cope with the elaborate
costumes and locations that the period setting requires.
The Maiden Stone of the title is a rock said to have been a woman
transformed by God to save her from the devil's designs, and it serves
as a symbol of Munro's concern with women's relationship to the hand of
fate.
In response to the geography of Aberdeenshire, the play is also about
extremes. ''It is so lush and so green but because it's so far north,
the climate and the landscape can become extreme very abruptly. You go
to the mountains in the west and even if you're at sea level you can see
the whole height. But you go to the mountains in the east and it's only
when you're at the top that you realise you're a long way up.
''Things are pushed deceptively to an extreme. You think everything is
couthy and cosy and then you realise that actually you're in quite a
hostile environment. The extremity of everything that happens in the
play comes out of the mundane.''
* The Maiden Stone opens at Hampstead Theatre, London on Thursday,
April 27 with previews from this Thursday.

IT'S tired and it's tiring. There is nothing as unappealing to the
non-musician as the flaunting of undoubted musical genius as a
substitute for soul or inspiration. It's why we love Bjork and hate Eric
Clapton.
Of course, Jeff Healey is an amazing blues/hard rock guitarist, made
all the more remarkable by his blindness. The band are equally
impressive, even though second-guitarist Tom Rush looks as if he has
just walked off the set of Spinal Tap, and tunes are well down the
agenda.
Healey's own song-writing is generally unremarkable, although much of
Sunday's set was taken from his Cover To Cover album, which is that most
pedestrian of beasts, a collection of cover versions.
His chosen genre often makes this sound like an exercise in the most
tedious kind of pub rock and remarkably his opening version of Spirit's
I Gotta Line On You was one of the most concise, pop moments of the
entire proceedings.
Sure, Healey can play Hendrix (Angel), attack Steelers Wheel (Stuck In
The Middle With You), and crank up the volume on Lennon's Yer Blues, but
it's only on Angel Eyes, an acoustic strum, where subtlety scores a late
consolation over volume.
The show ended with lengthy instrumental musings around See The Light
which certainly appealed to those bedroom guitarists in the audience who
play along to Healey's records when their parents are out, but for the
rest of us this was a show which could be appreciated, if only rarely
enjoyed.

Sara Villiers finds Irish playwright Donal O'Kelly 'so mad' about a
publishers' decision over his latest play
DONAL O'KELLY is really ticked off but he's a pretty affable guy and
his anger manifests itself in the mildest expression of annoyance, which
means much sighing and shrugging of shoulders. The Irish playwright,
author of Hughie on the Wires and Trickledown Town, has just discovered
that Faber has withdrawn from publishing his latest play Asylum! Asylum!
on the grounds that it is ''too political''.
''Ach, an American publisher is going to publish it anyway but that
mentality, from such an influential publisher as Faber, is so
depressing. It makes me so mad.'' Thankfully his version of being mad is
quite different from mine, so there's no foot stamping, banging on the
table or sulking over lunch. His politics might be considered radical --
being, dare we mention it, socialist -- but his manner is reasonable.
''I wouldn't mind if they said it was overwritten or something,'' he
considers, ''but to reject it on the grounds that it's too political!
That kind of attitude just leads to people worrying that they should
tone their stuff down.''
O'Kelly clearly has no intention of doing so; at a time when it is no
longer fashionable to do so, he is determined to continue his commitment
to issue-based theatre, a commitment backed by Scottish company
Wiseguise, who previously staged Hughie on the Wires in association with
Calypso, and who are about to tour Asylum! Asylum! around Scotland.
''I think that nearly everything you write is political in some way
and I certainly don't think that there should be any virtue attached to
being non-political, despite the vague consensus about that just now.''
This seems straightforward stuff to O'Kelly and he laughs over the
fact that his articulation of it has led to him being perceived as an
overtly political writer. ''Heh, heh, they should see the first play I
wrote,'' he smiles. ''I wrote it in 1984 as a protest against Ronald
Reagan's visit to Dublin and it was just desperate, it was real
hammer-over-the-head stuff but I think I pack a pretty soft punch these
days.''
In Asylum! Asylum! he is aiming his blows at the insidious spread of
xenophobia in Europe and, more specifically, at Michael Howard's
proposed crackdown on immigration and asylum seekers. He reviles these
measures as ''racist in intent'' and shakes his head in quiet disgust
over French Minister for the Interior Charles Pasqualle's declared
intention to achieve zero immigration.
Directed by Kenneth Glennan, a long-term collaborator of O'Kelly's --
they jointly formed the theatre company Calypso -- the Wiseguise
production boasts a formidable cast, including company regulars Anne
Marie Timoney, Jim Twaddle, and Laurie Ventry alongside Phil McCall,
David Baker and American musician Fjaere.
The play, which was inspired by two actual events (an incident in
Bucoro, Uganda in 1991 and the burning of a Vietnamese immigrants'
hostel in Berlin in 1992), tells the story of Joseph Omera (Baker), a
Ugandan refugee who seeks asylum in Dundee, and the resultant effect of
this action on the family of an ambitious immigration officer (Ventry).
Asylum! Asylum! was previously staged at the Abbey Theatre in Dublin
but O'Kelly is happier with the Wiseguise presentation of the play,
which more clearly markets it as a campaigning play, with the company
supporting the case of the Nigerian-born Moraya Scanlon and her two
children, who after 12 years of living in Glasgow are living under
threat of deportation after the break-up of her marriage to a Scot.
''We have to present it as a campaigning play, otherwise people don't
know what to make of it,'' insists O'Kelly with his customary gently
persuasive lack of didacticism. ''I think it's really good that
Wiseguise have publicised it this way because it is important to use the
play as a kind of flag -- to say, hey, we've noticed that this is going
on and to try and generate interest.''
* Asylum! Asylum! opens at the Traverse Theatre in Edinburgh tomorrow,
then tours Scotland throughout April and May.

STORMY WEATHER may not have been the first number of the afternoon,
but its inclusion on the programme was fitting since it accurately
forecast what was to come -- in more ways than one. The song has become
a regular feature of jazz vocalist Carol Kidd's repertoire, something
that could be said about much of what she sang at yesterday's Eastwood
Artsfeast concert.
In fact, as soon as the musicians assembled onstage and it was
apparent that this was not the Dave Newton-Allan Ganley-Dave Green trio
advertised, but the singer's larger group, it was possible for a Kidd
fan to predict a substantial proportion of what would be performed.
Like Jeepers Creepers (a superb duet with ace bass Ronnie Rae) or
Drifting (accompanied by top guitar double-act Nigel Clark and Dominic
Ashworth, as well as the inimitable Fraser Speirs on harmonica and
peerless pianist Brian Kellock on organ) or the no-musician-spared
Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out. No wonder she does them so
well -- she's had plenty of opportunity to perfect them.
What makes it irritating is that Carol Kidd is so good. It would be
lovely to hear her vary her selection a lot more than she does.
She has made some concessions to change of late: the gorgeous,
sumptuously slow medley of The More I See You and I've Grown Accustomed
to His Face has made a welcome return to her repertoire, as has the dark
and brooding Randy Newman number (possibly brought out on this occasion
for topical reasons) I Think It's Gonna Rain Today.
A few more where they came from (or elsewhere) wouldn't go amiss.

THE wave of sunny radiance that swept through Eastwood Theatre last
night as the Rachmaninov Trio launched the second half of their recital
-- the first chamber concert of Eastwood's Artsfeast -- with Schumann's
Second Piano Trio, wasn't just down to the gush of warmth emanating from
the music itself.
It was more like a catharsis following the bleak intensity that had
characterised their first-half performance. The Variations on a Hebrew
Theme by Israeli Paul Ben-Haim, with which the Rachmaninov Trio had
opened the proceedings, while a characterful work despatched with
flamboyance, had never really smiled.
And from there the group plunged into darkness with a memorable and
chilling account of Shostakovich's great Second Trio. These three
players were born to work together: Phillip Silver's powerful,
steel-tipped pianism is the perfect match to the strong, full-bodied
violin and cello combination of the Russians Lev Atlas and Sasha Volpov.
The latter two play absolutely as one.
The psychological trick in the Shostakovich is that, superficially,
there are moments of what appears to be humour and an almost
cartoon-like wittiness. No chance. This music is as black as sin. And
the Rachmaninov Trio didn't miss a moment of it. The humour in the
second movement was drenched in acid. And the pawky smirk of the finale
revealed itself as a death's head grin. This movement -- played with
unremitting intensity -- developed into a scorching and vicious
performance.
The evening was marred by the piano, which went out of tune in the
first half, was retuned at half-time, and destabilised quickly in the
Schumann, its watery sound rather spoiling the slow movement. Superb
playing from a rock-solid group.

THE divorce papers to end his eleventh marriage have just been filed,
reaffirming Sam Beckwith's greedy talent for entering and breaking
marital bonds with the bravura of Houdini. Of course remarriage
accompanied by serial divorce is not uncommon in America, but amid the
golden acres of New England no old money WASP with Mayflower connections
was expected to pursue wedding bells so vigorously. Sam Beckwith, after
all, was 76.
At 35, Dolores had been the oldest bride to share his fine colonial
home and sundry penthouses. Sixty-three days after the confetti of Las
Vegas, the couple parted, she complaining that in a closet he kept a
trunk full of previous nuptial albums and two heirloom wedding dresses
as stand-bys for any future belles. For his part, he loathed her
tendency to chew sunflower seeds in bed. But worse than that, Dolores
spent too much time out dancing in Manhattan.
On marriage to Sam, she had claimed their uptown pad as a spiritual
abode, sashaying forth from East 69th Street every night to become one
of New York's disorderly celebrities, edging her husband out of the
society columns, usurping his high-trash reputation. Now the formal
disentanglement was beginning, allowing Sam to reflect on the careless
disposition of his love life yet again.
But charges of fickleness were not entirely fair. Divorced from eight
earlier wives and twice married to two of the 11, Sam was, in a way, a
perfectionist, insisting that marriage was like stamp collecting: once
hooked on the ideal you looked for the rarest specimen and kept trading
until that goal was found.
This required not only a lifetime commitment but profound wealth, and
Sam's pedigree greenbacks piled up into billions. That said, when the
mood took him he could be as mean as any other fatcat. ''Tight as a
hatband,'' one of his ex's once retorted. Yet in his defence there were
those who believed that Sam's predicament was not so much that he had
loved women but loved the notion and ritual of marriage itself.
HERE indeed was one of the puzzles of the age. Throughout the Western
world divorce statistics were rocketing but within that world, society
was still a married one. Propelled by tumultuous insecurities and
unrealistic hunts for romance, even the most emotionally scarred
continued to seek out ''dream partners'' when what they probably needed
more was an effective psycho-therapist. Sam shunned that
couch-confession stuff, believing it dulled adventure, and perhaps as a
result he was eternally drawn to the type of women with whom life would
become a mutual hell.
In contrast the sisterhood of the harem sprang up among his ex's, if
only to maintain a watch on the various competitive financial
settlements involved. It was well known that in Sam's circle alimony was
a word women learned to speak with honest passion. Mrs Sam Beckwith the
ninth felt very close to the other wives because, in this
multi-fractured love story, she was the only one who had arrived at the
Connecticut mansion without giving offence to those who had gone before:
Mrs Beckwith the ninth was the sole wife to have been borne over the
threshold because her predecessor had died, and the local fire
department band turned out to honour that distinction.
But by that time Sam was 72 and suffering from name-confusion. First
thing in the morning he would peer over the share prices in the Wall
Street Journal, demanding: ''Hell, woman, which one are you? Trixie,
Florence, Karen, Glorietta, Justine, Margie, Sally, Bonnie, Violene, or
Lark?'' He never forgot a single one of them, just couldn't tell them
apart. As it happened, Mrs Beckwith the ninth was Justine.
''He had a crazy humour,'' she recalled, ''and he could make a girl
feel real special. Money had nothing to do with it.'' Nevertheless Sam
has paid dearly for his matrimonial hobby. The combined total duration
of his fifth, sixth, and seventh marriages was less than four months and
23 days, and the three brides were paid off to a joint total of $3m. The
seventh marriage lasted all of 10 hours, the bride receiving $24,000 for
her time and trouble.
Sam called his Yankee house Honeymoon Heaven, although for the most
part nothing too heavenly went on there. Often he would lock a wife out
of the building, howl at her bills, call the police to settle her cash
claims, and he once shot Glorietta in the foot. Above all, he took
meticulous care to inform the newspapers about his every move, for
notoriety was his god and each wife was chosen for publicity value.
Some might call him a playboy, but let's face it, the old bridegroom
was not a philanderer. Sam married those girls, every one of them. At
least, that is the story so far.

CONSIDER this. If or when the Scottish Parliament reconvenes after an
interregnum of almost three centuries, it will have more women members
than when it voted itself out of existence on January 17, 1707.
But by how many? From a percentage of zero, how far will Scotswomen
have progressed? Beyond the 8.3% of their representation at Westminster?
Their 12.5% at Brussels, their 17% on the regional councils, their 22%
on district councils, or their 22.4% on the new unitary authorities?
Of one thing you may be sure. It is a safe bet that without statutory
backing, women will not achieve equality of representation. Of the
snail's pace progress to date, Labour MP Rachel Squire conjured up a
memorable statistic at the Scottish Constitutional Convention.
On current projections, she said, it would take 975 years for women to
achieve equal numbers of Scottish MPs. ''I'm not willing to wait that
long,'' she said, criticising the proposals of the Scottish
Constitutional Commission to rely on voluntary progress with topping up
by the additional member system of proportional representation to right
some of the wrongs.
There is no doubt that the proposals were met with disappointment by
those committed to equality, which is just about everyone prepared to
put her, or even his, head above the parapet these days. The Scottish
body politic, it is widely accepted, has a testosterone imbalance. Helen
Liddell's by-election victory in Monkland's East last year brought the
number of women representing Scottish constituencies to a dismal
all-time high of six.
According to the Scottish Local Government Information Unit, 25.7% of
the candidates in this month's elections were women but only 259 were
elected, barely half of one per cent up on last time at 22.4% and an
indicator of what had long been suspected -- that even when the number
of women candidates goes up, male hands on the party machines ensure the
most winnable seats go to men.
This strikes at the heart of the compromise thrashed out between women
working across the Labour-Liberal Democrat divide to find a mechanism to
ensure that more women make it to New Parliament House in Edinburgh. The
announcement of a plan for a voluntary contract -- binding but not
statutory -- between the two parties to field equal numbers of male and
female candidates for the Scottish Parliament was hailed last month as a
historic step forward.
It was indeed an achievement, for there is a deep division between the
two parties based on ideology (yes, a word which still exists in spite
of today's politics of new blandness). Labour women passionately believe
that 50:50 membership must be enshrined in statute if it is to work.
The Liberal philosophy underpinning the SLD view finds such a coercive
use of statute abhorrent, and it suggests Labour is using heavy-handed
measures to solve what is essentially an internal party problem of male
domination.
In some ways the Liberal Democrat position is a curious one. It is the
most advanced party in terms of gender equality, with 28.7% of the
female councillors elected last month. The Tories, historically strongly
represented by women at council level, came second on 26.8%, Labour
third on 23.7%, with the SNP fourth on 19.6%. But, counters the SLD, it
is the principle. Let's look at that principle.
The state already lays down conditions on those who would stand for
Parliament. There are nomination procedures to be followed, deposits to
be paid, a percentage poll share laid down under which these are
forfeited, and cash limits set on campaign spending.
The insane cannot stand, nor can members of the armed forces. A
bankrupt cannot be an MP, nor anyone who accedes to the House of Lords.
None of these conditions or disbarments to reaching Westminster is
regarded as unduly coercive by Liberal Democrats.
Can 50:50 be achieved from day one of the new Parliament? Of course it
can, by any number of ways. Here is one, in rough outline. Around 72
constituencies (this could vary slightly, particularly given demands
from Orkney and Shetland for separate representation) would each return
two MPs, one male and one female standing as a team under one policy
slate.
The voter would have a ballot paper much like the present one, but
with two names representing each party or cause. Preference for pairings
would be indicated by numbered choice, giving proportional
representation by transferable vote.
The two members of the winning team would represent the constituency
as MPs, bringing different aptitudes to the task.
In terms of their surgeries, the medical analogy would be appropriate,
since a constituent with a problem could choose to go to a male or
female for assistance.
Nothing suggested here would disbar Lord Sutch from standing, provided
he could find a woman candidate to share his Monster Raving Loony slate.
Is that so coercive? One thing is certain; gender equality matters most
in the crucial first elections, for once members of that first crop are
in position, history shows that they will cling to power tenaciously.
Thereafter, the Scots Parliament of 72 women and 72 men could decide on
future rules.
Scotland has a macho political culture. But so, presumably, does
Argentina, where a statutory minimum quota of women in parliament is in
force. Scotland could be the first country in the world to build in
50:50 from day one, an achievement which would focus international
attention on Calton Hill. Let's start the way we mean to continue, with
a justly constituted Parliament aspiring to a just society.

A DISGUSTING spectacle throughout last winter has been Sinn Fein
supremo Gerry Adams strutting the world stage. Deigning on occasion to
meet for talks with ministers of the Northern Ireland Office, he has but
dripped contempt for them, for the Unionist majority, and for all daring
to suggest that few in Ulster view submersion in the Irish Republic with
unmitigated joy.
Adams has been, once and again, in the US, paraded everywhere as a
hero of peace, darling of the chat-show circuit, and an essential guest
for the hostess with the mostest. He has been lauded in the very White
House itself, gazing twinkle-eyed at Bill Clinton as the company sang
jolly Oirish ditties. The only laugh in all this has been the
restoration of Adams's broadcast voice. Silent, dubbed over, Adams
looked much more important than he really is. Rebonded with his reedy
thin and unprepossessing tones, he has been brought pleasantly down to
earth.
Nevertheless, over the past weekend Adams excelled himself for
sophistry and menace. It was (of course) the anniversary of the 1916
Rising in Dublin, high in the hagiography of Fenianism, and he was in
Dublin engaged in the customary rant against Britain, against the people
of Northern Ireland and their manifest desire to remain attached to the
country of their birth. But Britain, snivelled Adams, ''refused to
accept the rights of Sinn Fein voters'': if, further, we ''refuse to
listen to reasoned and reasonable argument, then let them listen to the
sound of marching feet and angry voices''.
The Sinn Fein electorate, declared the ex-MP for Belfast West, was
being ''excluded'' from the ''dialogue and negotiation which will shape
the future of Ireland''. But, ''the peace process cannot be allowed to
founder on the rock of British intransigence''.
For 25 years, sneered Adams, the British failed to defeat the
Republican struggle. Now they sought victory by subverting the peace
process.
So there. Can't, won't, and shan't talk to the nasty fascist British
until they entertain Adams, and Sinn Fein, in the style to which they
would like to be accustomed.
Let us subject this tirade to our calm deliberation.
First, the occasion. In the blood-cult of Irish Republicanism, the
Easter Rising of 1916 stands as a High Mass. Even in Scotland there are
plenty of silly people willing to believe that the failed Dublin putsch
was the heroic struggle of a repressed race against their imperial
masters; Pearce, Connolly, and the rest of them are revered as saints of
the Irish nation.
The reality, of course, was that those who launched that slaughter
never troubled to seek election even once. (They had no connection, by
the way, with the moderate Irish Nationalists who, in 1914, had stood on
the brink of achieving home rule.) In the mad days of that Paschal
weekend, hundreds of people -- most of them the innocent poor of Dublin
slums -- lost their lives. Who remembers their names today? But Pearce
and his cohorts are recalled with honour in the Republican tradition,
because of the British Government's asinine decision to execute them,
endowing their memories with martyrdom and enraging moderate
Nationalists who, hitherto, had viewed the extremists with embarrassment
and anger.
Second, the political logic. The British, storms Adams, must ''accept
the rights of Sinn Fein voters''. Call me naive, but by inviting Sinn
Fein to the conference table I thought the British architects of peace
had done just that. Indeed, on raw figures it seems rather more than
Sinn Fein deserves. In Eire, that rich and happy land, the last General
Election demonstrated the breadth of Sinn Fein/IRA support. The comrades
stood in 41 seats, lost deposits in all but two, and walked away with an
underwhelming 1.6% of the Irish vote. (In Britain's 1992 polls, the
continuing Liberal Party took 1.7%; but Michael Meadowcroft is not
demanding a seat in Cabinet.)
In Northern Ireland in 1992, Sinn Fein did rather better -- winning
10%. But it lost its only seat, Belfast West. Ten per cent is scarcely a
mandate. Ninety per cent of Ulster voters chose to support somebody
else. Even the Roman Catholic, Nationalist community preferred the
moderate SDLP to the gun-toting advocates of Sinn Fein.
Third, the threat. And here we may start with ironic surprise. Should
Britain continue to spurn the demands of Sinn Fein, squeaks Adams, then
a terrible consequence is unleashed. The foreign masters will quail
before the sound of marching feet and angry voices! So much for the
terror of the bogs. Mr Major has worse most weeks from the 1922
Committee.
Here, of course, Adams deliberately pulled his punch. After all, Adams
must enjoy his present place in the sun. There have been canapes in the
Capitol, flattery on Larry King Live, besieging autograph hunters on the
streets of Boston, clinches from the Clintons, and kisses from the
Kennedys. Why jeopardise such pleasantries by any hint of serious
violence?
But then, if Adams is suddenly shy of a bit of blood and guts, why
commemorate the Easter Rising at all? On the most charitable estimation,
it amounted to rather more than ''marching feet and angry voices'';
Pearce and Connolly, gently frying in Hades, might be rather miffed to
hear their Gotterdammerung reduced to the scale of a student demo.
The reality, as Adams knows full well, is a wee bit harder than that.
Sinn Fein was invited to the conference table because, like Lyndon
Johnson's camel, it was safer in than out. Besides, 10% of the vote is
10% of the vote -- a small block of feeling, but feeling none the less,
feeling which it would be more discourteous, and impolitic, to slight.
But more -- much more. Sinn Fein was invited to the conference table
because, as only the Americans are too stupid to know, its politicians
are the only ones in Ulster ready to kill people to get what they want.
Sinn Fein is the political wing of the Provisional IRA. Many Sinn Fein
activists are active in IRA gangs -- or, as some quaintly refer to them,
''active service units''. Sinn Fein has long boasted in the exploits of
the men in black masks. Never once has Gerry Adams recoiled from some
atrocity.
In the world of realpolitik, Gerry Adams and his Hibernian hoods have
to be taken seriously; they must be entertained at the conference table,
because spurning them is far too dangerous and because no-one -- no-one
-- wants the slaughter, the butchery, and abominable cruelties of the
Troubles to resume. But the IRA is still there, Sinn Fein still
postures. And -- though the British withdrawal of troops continues apace
-- not a round of ammunition, not a handgun, not a lump of Semtex has
been surrendered, or laid down, by the men of violence.
Irish nationalism is a folk-myth. It is not a legitimate political
movement like our own SNP. It does not abide by democratic ideals or
endorse the principles of liberalism and humanity. It is a fanaticism
founded on self-righteousness, on Catholic authoritarianism, on an utter
lack of self-doubt. Eamonn de Valera, that most evil statesman, best
summed up its rubric -- ''The majority has no right to be wrong.''
The IRA, Sinn Fein, the brotherhood of blood, will never disappear.
Their swords will never be beaten into ploughshares. Their struggle will
continue, irrespective of the wishes of the Irish people, heedless to
the tears of the maimed and the widowed. There will always be ''the
few'', ''ourselves alone'', ready to continue the cause even as others
desert it. The guns are their right; the Semtex their host.
The majority has no right to be wrong. The Few will kill to the end of
time.

TO Rouken Glen for a bit of art. These are changed days (yes, haud on
for a daud of nostalgia) from when we used to make our way to the big
park on the South Side of Glasgow for the traditional Easter picnic.
Rouken Glen, with its endless acres, was a magical place for city kids
racked, as we were, with rickets, consumption, malnutrition, chronic
bronchitis from the city smoke, and us with hardly a shoe on our feet.
Actually that last bit isn't true, but we do tend to get a bit carried
away thinking about the good old days. What was good was that almost
every kid on the street, young and old, went on the trip in a vast tribe
which made parental supervision unnecessary.
In those good old days we made our way to Rouken Glen by tram. (Sorry,
can't remember the number of the tram, senility has set in along with
the other diseases.) Then we would make our way up the sunlit avenues to
stake our picnic spot on the hill overlooking the boating pond.
I always remember Rouken Glen as being packed as well as sunny. My
family still take pleasure in reminding me of the Easter Monday when I
woke everyone at 7am and said we had better get on our way because the
park might be full.
Certainly you had to be up early and queue forever to get a shot on
the rowing boats to explore the boating pond with its exotic and
forbidden islands, fierce swans, and even fiercer parkies.
There was danger on the loch, especially when our neighbour Margaret
Wilson became concerned about the amount of water sloshing around the
bottom of the oary boat and pulled the wooden plug to let it out. Go
explain her logic to the parkie.
It was a full shift, Easter Monday at Rouken Glen. But there was so
much to be done. Rolling your egg down the hill and chasing after it
before it went into the boating pond or a wee dog ran away with it.
Then there was the picnic. Always a highlight, apart from the year
Davie McCartney had a sudden and severe attack of diarrhoea all too
adjacent to the picnic site.
Also deleterious to your lunch was the daredevil climb of Everest
proportions up the rocky crag overhanging the roaring torrent below.
Actually, I saw the rocky crag again yesterday and it is a mdest incline
of some 40 feet.
On to a game of hide and seek in Rouken Glen's huge rhododendron
bushes. The rhododendrons are apparently world famous, though for what
my fellow indulger in nostalgia could not remember.
He did recall that one such bush once provided shelter for an amorous
adventure. He also remembered a slogan much used by his contemporaries:
''Roukie for nookie''. It should be pointed out that this chap is from
Arden and lacks insight into some of the finer elements of the Glasgow
condition.
So, carrying all this cultural baggage, I turned up at Rouken Glen to
sample parts of the first Eastwood Festival of the Arts which is partly
centred on the park. One element is called Arts Beast, a collection of
bits of visual art dotted through the park.
One piece is a new recruit to the fleet of ageing rowing boats at the
pond. It has a glass bottom so that you can better see the crisp pokes
and Coke cans through the murky brown water. I don't think my old
neighbour Margaret Wilson would have approved of seeing all that water.
There is a Japanese meditation hut built on a bridge across the river.
Interesting concept, but try meditating with hordes of kids pounding in
and out of the hut and ringing the three bells which form part of the
structure.
Or hang about until dark to catch the moving picture show on a glass
screen hanging from a tree in the park. The images consist of the ebb
and flow of a North Sea scene with synchronised swimmers superimposed.
I have tried to keep local politics out of this report, but how were
the sensible and cautious cooncillors of Eastwood persuaded to come over
all arty? Search me, but the Loud Provost, Leslie Rosin, was there in
his pinstripe suit and chain of office leading the charge round Rouken
Glen's collection of odd art.
I call him the Loud Provost because I have never heard such ringing
tones used in conversation. None of your can't be heard behind a bus
ticket stuff with Provost Rosin. Especially when he was talking to
foreign visitors who, as you know, are all deaf.
The provost was still leading the charge much later in the grounds of
Eastwood House which have been turned into a kind of douce East
Renfrewshire Woodstock. The Scottish Chamber Orchestra were belting out
fine music from the tented stage.
The tented bar was selling nips of Scottish Leader whisky at 50p which
worked wonders for the black coffee from the adjacent Danny's Snack Bar.
The outgoing Eastwood Tory administration had obviously spent the entire
Common Good Fund on a fireworks display but took the precaution of
setting them off before it got dark so we could all get home early.
It has to be said that the Eastwood Arts Feast is a jolly occasion,
even for those of us of a generation used to making our own fun. It
continues for the rest of the week with such delights as Opera on a
Shoestring doing the greatest hits of Mozart, Verdi, Puccini, Bizet, and
Donizetti.
Another show is called the Fiddling and Fooling Variety Show but we
won't mention it since we really are trying to keep politics out of
this.

Fred Forrester, deputy general secretary of the Educational Institute
of Scotland, makes the case for keeping the big two examining bodies
apart
WHY should Scottish parents and the public be concerned at the
Government's proposal for an amalgamation of the Scottish Examination
Board (SEB) and the Scottish Vocational Education Council (Scotvec)? Is
this not a purely administrative matter, following on from the Higher
Still proposals? Will it have any effect on standards in Scottish
education?
These are two bodies with very different histories and philosophies.
Both are non-departmental public bodies (quangos), but the SEB is a
fairly rare example of a quango whose composition is laid down by
Parliament. The Education (Scotland) Act, 1981, specifies a number of
''constituencies'' from which the members of the board must be drawn.
These include higher education institutions, directors of education,
educational advisers and teachers in educational establishments. By
contrast, Scotvec is a mainstream quango, with most members appointed by
the Scottish Secretary and up to six co-opted by the organisation
itself.
School teachers are much more comfortable with the SEB than with
Scotvec. It and its predecessors have been running examinations for
secondary pupils since 1888. Teachers are well represented on the board
itself and on 31 subject panels and short course committees.
Its annual report contains the names and workplaces of every member of
a subject panel or short course committee.
Scotvec's original purpose, which remains its main aim, is to act as a
certification body for further education. Although it now has a
substantial presence in the secondary school sector, this was not a
consequence of any plan but a result of the huge increase in the number
of pupils staying on beyond the minimum leaving age. It is strongly
market-orientated and its structure is markedly less representative and
less transparent than the board's.
There is another differnece which should concern parents. The board's
emphasis is on externally assessed examinations, though many subject
syllabuses now contain internally-assessed course work such as
investigations or folios. However, awards are made after national
examinations, held on the same day and at the same time in every school
in Scotland. There is a sophisticated system for determining the
''pass'' mark in each examination, as well as an exhaustive appeals
system. The status of the Higher as a ''benchmark'' achievement depends
crucially on external assessment.
Scotvec, on the other hand, makes its awards exclusively on the basis
of internal assessment. There is an elaborate back-up system involving
moderation, verification and ''quality audit'' but, at the end of the
day, the assessment of each student by lecturers or teachers working in
the student's institution is the important factor.
So there would be a real worry if an amalgamated body adopted a
Scotvec market-based ethos or increased the element of internal
assessment in its awards -- though the Higher Still document contains
the safeguard that there should be a mixture of internal and external
assessment in all ''academic'' and ''vocational'' in the upper
secondary.
In his consultation paper, the Scottish Secretary, Ian Lang, puts
forward a number of options but makes it clear that his preferred option
is for a single new body to take over all the functions of both bodies.
It is regrettable that the consultation is ''loaded'' from the outset
through Mr Lang expressing his preference.
Many respondents will conclude that a decision has already been taken
and will turn to the annex on issues for consideration if a new body is
to be established. This would be unfortunate. The matter deserves a full
and untrammeled debate.
The logic of having a single body is now very much open to question.
Higher Still is a derivative of the Howie Report. While FE colleges
would be able to offer the new qualifications, in the same way that they
have offered SEB qualifications in the past, there can be no shadow of
doubt that what we are dealing with is a new curriculum for school
pupils at fifth and sixth years. Removal of the distinction between
''academic'' (mainly SEB) and ''vocational'' (mainly Scotvec)
qualifications in the secondary school can be an opportunity for the
secondary and the SEB to reclaim lost territory.
For various reasons, the prospect of some kind of blurring of the
distinction between school and further education has receded in
Scotland. Consortia of secondary schools and FE colleges are no longer
the flavour of the month. Ironically, one of the reasons is the
Government's decision to hive off the colleges from education
authorities.
Why not recognise that schools and further education colleges have
separate but legitimate roles within the Scottish education system? Why
not transform the SEB into a School Qualifications Authority and Scotvec
into a Further and Higher Education Qualifications Authority? Of course,
the position of the Scottish universities in this set up would have to
be examined; and, of course, there would still be a need for
co-operation between the two authorities.
This would have more logic than the present arrangement and would
avoid the huge practical problems associated with the Scottish Office's
four options, for example the questions inherent in having a single body
with two bases 60 miles apart, two sets of staff, two expensive
investments in new technology and two entirely different examination
philosophies and working practices.
The matter is too important to be contained within Mr Lang's
parameters. Issues of great importance for Scottish education are
involved. Respondents should not be restricted either by the stated
parameters or by the extremely tight May 9 deadline for submissions. The
debate has only begun.

WHEN Aegis, the Adult Educational Guidance Initiative Scotland, held
its recent conference, it was celebrating its second birthday, and
taking a close look at its next steps forward in what has become a vital
area as further and higher education has developed and changed.
Aegis was established, with Scottish Office Education Department
support, to act as a focus for developments in adult guidance. It is
engaged in mapping current provision, disseminating examples of good
practice, producing quality guidelines, offering staff development, and
identifying further development needs in adult guidance.
''Membership is drawn from all the sectors involved in further,
higher, and adult education, as well as training,'' explained Bob
Bissell, national development officer.
''Adult guidance has become increasingly necessary as the whole map of
the post-school sector has changed. There has been constant change in
the types of institution we have, changes in types of courses, and a
growing recognition that to gain access to the Scottish education and
training system to their best advantage, adults must have professional
guidance, effectively delivered.''
Attending the Aegis conference, were people from traditional further
education colleges, universities, community education, the careers
service, education directorates, and local enterprise companies.
The SOED was also represented by way of senior officials and members
of Her Majesty's Inspectorate, with Marian Docherty, HMI, playing an
active role in the conference and in Aegis.
''I would agree that adult guidance is important as never before. The
sheer range of choices that an adult student faces can be bewildering.
Excellent and sensitive guidance is essential at all stages,'' she said.
That was a view endorsed by Elaine McLaren, access co-ordinator at
Glasgow's Stow College.
''Guidance is a vital component of making sure that an adult student
who has chosen to embark on further and higher education is supported
every step of the way. Many students coming on Scottish Wider Access
Programmes, for example, have given up jobs and careers, and returning
to full-time study can put great strains on family life. That's where
guidance comes into its own. It's just as important as the quality of
teaching on a course.''
Delegates recognised that local government reorganisation posed a
potential threat to established patterns in adult education. Adult
education is a non-statutory function, which at the very least leaves
its future open to discussion, particularly, perhaps, in unitary
authorities which will go without education directorates.
But Aegis members are convinced that adult access to further and
higher education will continue to be as open as possible, and that
guidance will be more important than ever.
''In fact,'' said Bob Bissell, ''we can also see a need for guidance
for students gaining their first degrees. Gone are the days when a
degree meant a job. First degree students need guidance at that point in
their career, and, with the emphasis firmly on career change and
retraining, all partners in the adult guidance field will have a key
role to play.''

EASTER revision courses are in vogue. Courses over the holiday period
have been offered by both FE colleges and small private organisations,
and the uptake has been high.
Langside College in Glasgow has been running Easter courses for five
years under its coordinator, Neil Carwood, head of social sciences. They
are offered at Higher level in English, maths, the sciences, geography
and modern studies.
The teachers are Langside staff, all experienced in presenting
students for Highers. A minimum of four enrolments is needed for a
viable course, and a maximum of 12 is imposed for each class.
Tuition lasts 12 hours, on a half-day basis on four days. Some
students enrol for two or even three courses at a cost of #65 each (#110
for two courses). Now that colleges are independent, any profit is used
to balance any other loss-making courses which Langside runs.
About a third of the enrolments are from the college's own students.
The rest are pupils, mainly from schools in the south of Glasgow --
though a few come from as far as Ayr -- plus a number of adult
returners.
''In each subject there is a core element of information which
students must master,'' said Neil Carwood. ''In addition, we teach them
exam techniques and go over past papers with them. We set homework for
the evenings.''
At the end of each course, students complete an evaluation form. High
levels of satisfaction are expressed -- the college has vast experience
of presenting for Highers (about 1300 this year). Next session, its
cumulative total of presentations will exceed 50,000, an event which
Langside will celebrate.
Tom Smith, senior lecturer in biology, had a full complement of 12
students, including one from Malaysia and three from the Gulf states.
Some of his class are repeating Highers, others are taking a sixth year
crash course in Higher Biology. ''I identify the problem areas, such as
the chemistry of respiration and the more involved aspects of
genetics,'' he explained. ''I direct their studies and choose revision
questions with a problem-solving slant.''
John Rae-Kelly taught a Higher English group because, as quality
officer in the college, he had no Higher class in his normal timetable.
''I had to fight for it,'' he said. ''The rest of the English staff
wanted to do it.''
The Henderson clan was very enthusiastic. Rebecca Henderson, a
first-year student at Langside, hoping to take economics at Glasgow
University, followed revision courses in modern studies and mathematics.
''I am much more confident now,'' she claimed. ''There is far more
chance to talk on an individual basis, especially about essays.''
Gioia DiMeo Henderson, from Notre Dame High, wants to study medicine
and was taking Easter classes in physics and chemistry. ''Why sit at
home?'' she asked. ''Here it's fabulous -- they give you background and
help you with what's most likely to appear in the exams.''
Kenneth Arnott, from Williamwood High, is planning to study hotel
management and doing a revision course in chemistry. ''The teachers
remind me about material I would have forgotten. At home I would have
looked at it for 15 minutes and given up,'' he said.
Naureen Ahmed, from Woodfarm High, needing four Bs to study economics,
hoped that ''the course would summarise my year for me. It has done just
that -- I have had lots of practice.''
Violet Webster, an evening student at Langside, had not sat an exam
for 38 years but ''wanted to get back into the habit''. She has a
morning job and appreciated the college's help in cutting corners by
teaching her exam techniques.
Ashgrove Tutorial College, run by two teachers of English -- Annette
McGarrill from Chryston High and Rena Gregory from St Maurice's High in
Cumbernauld -- uses lecture rooms in Strathclyde University for its
classes.
Ashgrove started seven years ago and this Easter it was offering 16
courses at both Standard Grade and Higher level. Each course lasted 10
hours, spread over four days, and cost #60. Homework was regularly set.
As with Langside, the concentration was on revision, teaching exam
techniques and previous exam papers. At Standard Grade, pupils were
divided into groups at Credit/General and General/Foundation levels.
Annette McGarrill made the point that ''these are not crash courses --
they are structured revision courses offering reinforcement, taken by
experienced secondary teachers.''
According to Rena Gregory, the courses also enabled pupils to become
familiar with a university environment and were appreciated by parents
because ''they know where their children are and what they're doing''.
Mary Burge, a teacher of modern studies at Bishopbriggs High, said
that her own son, nephews, and nieces, attended courses at Ashgrove.
''In school they may nod wisely but not ask questions. They may feel
tense and under pressure. Here it is put into perspective and they
relax.
''Modern studies has a lot of content, and lip service is sometimes
paid to how to study. We put that right.''
Suzanne Kerr and Alison Neil, from Grange Academy in Kilmarnock, were
taking Higher Chemistry and Maths. ''It's really, really good,'' said
Suzanne. ''It helps you to understand better, and it's easier to ask
questions.'' Alison found the courses excellent. ''I'm not good at one
part of chemistry. It would have been hard to concentrate at home. Here
you relax and get on with it.''
Robin Jones, from Jordanhill School, had enrolled for three classes --
in English, chemistry and physics. ''They're all very good,'' he said.
''The courses are well condensed. The English teacher keeps you on your
toes.''
Gordon Brown, from Greenfaulds High in Cumbernauld, has the
conditional offer of a place at Glasgow University in aeronautical
engineering. He needs to enhance his grades in three subjects. ''I came
to Ashgrove last year,'' he said, ''and they improved my English and
physics. I'm confident they're doing it again. They clear up points you
don't understand. If it still doesn't work out, they sit down with
you.''

MIKE Newton, general manager of Apple Computer UK, recently gave a
talk to Scottish teachers about the boom in information technology
enhancing the quality of education. The lecture was organised by the
Scottish Council for Educational Technology.
On the night both organisations learned there was a niche market ripe
for tapping into. From the floor, a number of teachers asked whether
Scet and Apple could get together to make it easier for them to buy
personal computers for use in the home.
The niche market consists of teachers who want to buy a computer but
who cannot afford to fork out the money up front. There are several
schemes in place for schools to buy computers, but to date nothing had
been available from Apple to enable individual teachers to buy them for
their own use.
Now Scet and Apple are offering teachers an interest-free financial
package to buy the Apple Mac Performa 630 Plus -- desribed by the
company as the ultimate in home computing power -- and extras at a
highly-competitive price.
Anne Eastgate, Scet's marketing director, said she had been staggered
by the response to the organisation's mail shot to schools,
establishments and some teachers. ''There has been a huge uptake,'' she
reported.
The offer is about to be made available to those working in Scottish
education for a limited period. For a #200 deposit and 24 monthly
payments of #46.60, teachers and others in Scottish education will be
able to buy the PC, complete with integral CD-Rom.
A free software bundle includes ClarisWorks version 2.1 -- an
integrated package in common use in schools -- the Grolier multimedia
encyclopedia 1994, and the Guinness disk of records. The package also
includes a specially-compiled Scet CD with the award-winning Writer's
Toolkit and Expression for the teaching of English, as well as extracts
of The Herald from last year.
And purchasers will receive a #50 voucher for their schools to use
when they are buying software. They will also have access to the Scet
technology helpline on all aspects of implementing IT in the classroom.
Scet chief executive Nigel Paine said: ''It was clear from Mike
Newton's lecture that there was a demand for technology at affordable
prices and Scet has responded by making this opportunity available to
teachers.''
Mr Newton said: ''Scottish educationalists were early adopters of
Macintosh and have remained in the vanguard. The clear lead that
Scottish schools have with information technology in education is
undoubtably due to the enthusiasm and commitment of teachers.
''This deal with Scet will give teachers the opportunity to become
part of the multi-media revolution.''

Multi-millionaires Mark and Rene Yarnell explain to Geraldine Abrahams
how to cast a net, get rich, and be happy
LAST month saw the launch of the first certificate seminar in network
marketing offered by a major institution of higher education in the US.
The seminar, entitled: Network Marketing: Planning, Building and
Managing a Distributor Organization, was run at the University of
Illinois, Chicago, and the teachers or seminar leaders were Dr Charles
King and Mark and Rene Yarnell.
The Yarnells, who have over 15 years of experience in network
marketing, are legendary in the industry in the US having developed an
international distribution organisation of over 55,000 people selling
$50m in wholesale products annually.
They have won an array of top awards from within and outwith the
industry, have published several books, articles and tapes and have
featured in various books by other authors.
They are very rich, but have found that the financial remuneration is
secondary to the enormous personal growth that can be achieved, and the
opportunity to use wealth for the greater good.
Initially, like most nouveau riche people, they went overboard on
acquisitions. ''But money doesn't buy happiness,'' Mark says. ''The
first thing we teach people is to create goals that makes sense, that
are bigger than themselves.''
One of their goals has been to fund a project for the homeless in
Reno, Nevada and they consider it to be just one aspect of personal
development to come out of network marketing.
Personal development is a growing field here in the UK too but
according to Mark Yarnell it is not enough merely to empower people.
''I was in the positive thinking arena for 12 years. The reason I got
out of it was because I got tired of empowering people only to have them
forget those principles within four hours of going back to a job they
hated,'' he says.
''You can't pump people up unless you give them a vehicle through
which to apply those principles of positive thinking. Once a person like
Jack Black, of Mindstore, gets to them and they get all excited, then
what?''
''Network Marketing gives a person an opportunity, with a very small
investment, to take principles of positive thinking and work their way
up. But without a vehicle, positive thinking is nothing but nonsense.
''I was a Methodist minister getting my car repossessed in 1986 when I
found this industry. It only took four months to get completely out of
debt through hard work.''
Since then the Yarnells say they have convinced hundreds of people
that they have inherent potential to rise to levels beyond their dreams,
and then giving them a vehicle through which they can express that
potential.
''Tony Robbins is a great prophet of positive thinking, but what he
and Zig Ziggler have never done is, when they have finished teaching
people how to think right, they have never given them an unlimited
vehicle through which to express that unlimited thinking,'' says Mark.
''So people go back to their corporate jobs and face the same
downsizing and cutbacks. They have the same office politics, the same
meaningless repeat job, and they forget they were empowered by Tony
Robbins, they forget that they have just read Mindstore. It doesn't
matter how positive you are if you don't take action.''
That action can be both ineffective and destructive however, if not
properly and ethically applied. Over the past five or six years, he
argues, companies dealing in non-consumable products have left large
numbers of people unhappy, and given the industry a bad name.
''Where we come from, most people would not consider going into a
business like that because they have learned that in the evaluation
process, the very first criterion before you pick a company is: are the
products consumable and reusable?
''If you get into the right network company, you are unlimited,'' he
says.
''Just take all of the headaches that people say exist in traditional
business and throw them out the window. They don't exist in network
marketing.''
The demoralisation caused by the economic recession is a major reason
for people to look for an alternative to a corporate world which they no
longer trust, suggests Rene.
Says Mark: ''Most people are on the '40-year plan'. At the age of 25
you have a sense of direction, you can go into bank management or
teaching or whatever, but at 65 there is an amazing fact in America.
''According to the Life Census Bureau, out of every 100 Americans who
started at 25 with a sense of direction, by the age of 65, 31 of us are
dead, 68 are earning less than we made the last year we were working,
and one is wealthy.
''For 40 years the average person goes back and forward to a job they
hate, and every once in a while getting in a game of squash or a two
week vacation. This is what I call 'Token Joy' -- just enough to keep
them going -- and only one person makes it!
''It's stupid. Either you take responsibility for your own lives or
you are going to spend 40 years in hell, in a job you hate, because you
think that is a means to an end.''
Mark and Rene Yarnell have just finished writing a book: Should You
Quit Before You Are Fired?, with Paul Pilzer, a noted economist at The
White House under Presidents Reagan and Bush.
''Paul Pilzer says there are enough natural resources to build a house
the size of the White House for every man, woman and child on this
planet without disrupting the ecological balance,'' says Mark. ''He says
that if the bottom 50% of the people earned as much as the top 10%, it
would completely erradicate all the social problems.
''Imagine a Scotland where every person had no bills, no worries, life
was about doing constructive, productive things. About 20% of the people
would sit on their butts and do nothing but watch Oprah but 80% of the
people would have to do something of value after a while or they would
feel socially irresponsible.
''The most serious fraud ever perpetrated on society is that everybody
couldn't live that way. The best thing that could happen is that
everybody could have the ability to earn big money, and have a job that
would enable them to rise to their full potential.''

IT was interesting to read the comments made by Councillor Alison Hay,
Liberal Democrat leader, at the meeting of the new council members for
Argyll and Bute (April 12).
She said it was illogical for Independents to band together as a
single grouping. This is not so when you break the situation down.
Everyone seems to have missed the significance of the Independent
upsurge on the west coast. If these candidates stood for election under
their true banners they would not have been elected -- and they know it.
Now that they have been elected, they will band together and, lo and
behold, the Tories are back in business.

ALEX SALMOND is quite correct in pointing out that BBC Scotland's
projections of what the total vote for the parties was in the local
elections overestimated Labour's share and underestimated that of the
Liberal Democrats (April 12).
Labour did indeed fail to match its previous highest share of the vote
in 1984. Alas, the rest of what he wrote about BBC Scotland's coverage
of the results was pure fantasy.
The BBC in Scotland was not being used ''as a guinea pig for a new
computer analaysis which was intended to be used in the English local
elections''.
The methods used by the BBC in London to project a vote share for the
parties when local elections are held in one or more parts of Great
Britain at the beginning of May each year were first developed no less
than 14 years ago.
Full details were published in an academic journal as long ago as
1989. Neither I nor any of my colleagues within the BBC have any need to
use Scotland as a test bed.
In truth, both the methods and the objectives of our projection were
developed solely for use in the Scottish local elections in order to
meet the distinctive political and electoral circumstances which pertain
north of the Border.
Alex Salmond, in contrast would have us use the swingometer, a device
which usually ignores the existence of the SNP entirely.
I am afraid the reason for our inaccuracy in estimating Labour's vote
share is much more prosaic than the ''smouldering computers'' Alex
Salmond would have your readers believe.
Our projections were based on comparing the results in a sample of
wards in this year's elections with those in last year's regional
elections. In the event, the increase in Labour's vote in our sample
proved to be greater than it was across Scotland as a whole.
A closer look at the results explains how this could happen. Labour
did in fact do better than its previous best performance in 1984 in more
than two-thirds of the existing districts in Scotland (leaving aside the
predominantly non-partisan Highland, Borders, and Dumfries and Galloway
regions).
Unfortunately these proved to be the districts which predominated in
our sample (whose composition was more or less dictated to us by the
decisions made by the political parties about where they would all
fight).
Meanwhile, having asked the BBC to admit its errors, I presume Alex
Salmond will take a dose of his own medicine. He claimed on local
election night that the SNP would better its own best performance of
26.8% in last year's regional elections. In the event (as reported by
The Herald itself) the party won just 26.3%. I look forward to the
explanation as to why he got it wrong in his next column.

PRO-SCOTTISH parliament Tories could learn from the experience of the
Scottish Liberal Party in the seventies. Electorally they failed, but in
terms of effect on policy they achieved a great deal by pushing Labour
into a firmer position on a Scottish parliament and also outlining a
position taken on board by the SNP on Europe.
It is a curious phenomenon that the SLP, which was well to the left of
centre, and my late father, who was to the right, should have adopted
the same position. It makes a mockery of political labels.
By remaining relatively silent in order to preserve ''unity'' in the
run-up to a by-election in Perth and Kinross, pro-Scottish parliament
Tories will only suffer guilt by association.
As things stand, they have not much of a political future. Remaining
passive, unwilling to strike, will only reduce what prospects there are
for any eventual recovery.

SO the election was not fought on local issues. If it was not, then it
must have been aimed at the Government. Why is the Government so
unpopular? Just how many local issues begin in Downing Street and are
directed at locals everywhere?
Does privatisation not become a concern for the locals when it entails
the essentials of life? Is crime not a local issue? It isn't Downing
Street that is burgled and vandalised. The apprehension of criminals of
all ages and the penalties on them affect the locals, do they not?
Irregularities in hospitals and old people's homes are felt by the
locals and stem from bad supervision from Government officials. There is
little that affects the locals that does not stem from the Government
and simply because they are out of reach of the public the only way to
get even is to attack at election times.
The results are most often a substantiation of the old saying, As you
sow so shall you reap.

THE overall effect of Alex Salmond's complaint about BBC Scotland's
Election Special is to cast doubt over the accuracy of the programme. In
fact only one item of psephology is in dispute.
Alex Salmond says: ''What makes the BBC's (mistake) so infuriating is
an almost manic inability to recognise, admit, and correct errors.'' Had
BBC Scotland got any single result wrong we would be quite happy to
correct the error.
Alex Salmond confuses projections with actual results. The figures for
each party's share of the vote that were given on the results programme
were projections. They could hardly be otherwise as they were broadcast
long before all the results were in.
Throughout the evening Brian Taylor made a point of issuing health
warnings, ''We're going to take a few gambles perhaps with some of the
facts and figures,'' and clearly distinguished between projections and
actual results.
The objective of the computer prediction was to give the viewer as
clear a picture of the likely outcome as soon as possible. We would not
have expected it to prove exactly correct in its predictions on
percentage share given the complexities of devising a system which
involved comparing votes cast under the old boundaries with those cast
under the new boundaries.
In fact, the projections for the Conservative and SNP share of the
vote were remarkably accurate: projection 11% and 27%; result 11% and
26.5%.
The projections for the Labour and Liberal Democrat shares were out by
a few points because of necessity our projections were based on a sample
of results which in event proved not to be exactly in line with what
happened across the whole of Scotland.
For the record we are happy to admit that our projection of the Labour
share of the vote was 47% against the actual share of 44%; and that our
final projection of the Liberal Democrat share was 8% against the actual
share of 9.8%.
Contrary to Alex Salmond's assertion that ''by Friday the system was
smouldering in a corner, unable to produce any figures,'' the computer
was packed away because once the actual results had come in its job of
projecting results had become redundant.

I READ with interest Mr Kenneth Pritchard's comments in your article,
The bottom line for lawyers (April 14).
I resisted making any comment when Mr Pritchard as secretary of our
professional body seemed candidly to suggest in a part profile of him
which appeared in your newspaper that there was no reason why
conveyancing should not be carried out by persons other than solicitors.
I now see that Mr Pritchard suggests that there are two options open
to the ordinary solicitor who forms the bulk of the membership of the
society he represents.
One is to do a good professional job and go bankrupt. The other is to
cut corners and put his clients, his firm, and his insurers at risk.
Neither is acceptable.
Surely Mr Pritchard and his colleagues in Edinburgh have something
more constructive to suggest, namely a properly regulated fee structure.

YOUR editorial made some pertinent points about change in the housing
market (April 13). It is worth drawing out the implications of both
explicit policy and of wider, more fundamental change.
On the policy side, it is true that the gradual phasing out of
mortgage tax relief has been advocated for a long time. Let us be clear
why. Since 1980 the Government has foregone #4bn in tax revenues in
Scotland as a result of MIRAS. That same period witnessed the rise of
homelessness to record levels.
Acute problems of dampness and disrepair cannot be ignored forever.
The #4bn spent on MIRAS benefited no-one: for home owners it simply
pushed up land and house prices across the board; it did nothing to
address the problems of homelessness and poor housing.
Not only was MIRAS an equitable subsidy; more pertinently for the
current Government, it was shockingly inefficient.
MIRAS should be phased out precisely so that money can be used more
effectively to tackle the most pressing housing problems. The opposite
is, in fact, happening. The Treasury has estimated that it will save
#250m in Scotland between 1994 and 1996 on reducing the MIRAS rate from
25% to 15%. But this money will remained stashed in Treasury coffers.
Far from re-investing the savings, the Scottish Office actually plans to
cut housing expenditure by #214m over the next three years.
Short-term expediency has replaced coherent policy. In the long term,
this will have even more disastrous consequences. As your leader points
out, this is a time of fundamental change in the labour market and in
perceptions about work.
Underlying the removal of the MIRAS crutch (and, of course, the
reductions in homeowners' rights to income support beginning this
October) is a challenge to the foundations upon which the mortgage
market is based -- secure jobs and steady incomes.
The medium-term goal of low inflation also erodes the
investment-magnet of home ownership. But nothing is being done to
respond to these changes. Scotland desperately needs a new approach to
renting. We have both the impetus and the resources. Only ostrich-like
dogma is in the way.
It is ironic that your thought-provoking editorial came only a day
after a press release from St Andrew's House proclaimed: ''Lord James
announces spring home ownership campaign''. Let us hope, for the Housing
Minister's sake, that future generations have a taste for bitter irony.

YOU carried two stories: Sunday bingo plan angers Church and Lottery
loser kills himself after advance tickets run out (April 11).
In the Social Responsibility Committee of the Methodist Church in
Scotland we have considered these two issues, both concerning gambling.
We are opposed in principle to gambling.
With regard to Sunday afternoon gambling, we wrote to the Scottish
Office saying that, although we maintained our opposition to hard
gambling, we felt soft gambling to be less serious and as Bingo clubs
provided a social facility and a warm environment (we wrote when 17% VAT
on fuel was still intended) we did not wish to oppose their opening.
At our recent committee we discussed the impact of the National
Lottery on people and on the raising of charitable funds. As far as we
know no Methodist organisations will be applying for Millenium funding.
We resolved to support those who refuse involvement with the lottery
and more importantly, to care for the casualties of this new societal
activity.
We were aware of the traumatic invasion of privacy, and of ostracism
in certain groups as probable results. We had not envisaged a casualty
taking his own life. Our concern for the casualties is deepened and our
opposition to the lottery must also be reinforced.

BRUCE McKAIN'S excellent article, The bottom line for lawyers (April
14), highlights the effect of Thatcherite philosophy on the legal
profession. The same philosophy has also affected other professions, eg
architecture and quantity surveying, where private-practice firms now
have to tender for work and almost always the lowest tenderer is awarded
the contract.
Are the professions and the associated codes of professional ethics
disappearing and being replaced by firms of ''contractors'' who of
necessity are having to adopt the ethics of the market-place, ie
short-term maximisation of profits?
If this is the situation then sadly the general public will have to
realise that if they are only prepared to pay peanuts for a
''professional'' service then they cannot be surprised if they only
attract monkeys.

After Ian Bell's marvellous double whammy, Bob Dylan and the Tom Paine
book (April 10), what did John Macleod offer the following day?
So he's moving house; so he's leaving the island; so he's had a bit of

So what?

HAVING recently sat my driving test I am only too aware of how
unpleasant an experience it is. A fairer and more humane way must be
found to judge one's ability to drive safely.
I propose that we do away with the test altogether and instead allow
driving schools the right to issue licences. The law should state that
everyone must undergo a fixed number of paid lessons (a minimum of 10 I
think is a good figure).
If after the tenth lesson the instructor feels you are a competent
driver then you should be issued with a licence. If he thinks your
driving is still weak in some areas he would insist you take more
lessons until you've attained the required standard.
Independent assessors should be allowed to do spot checks and by law
be permitted to sit in during any lesson to ensure that the instructor
is showing neither favouritism nor unfairness.
The great benefit of this system is that it assesses people over a
period and doesn't focus on a 40-minute test where nerves of steel are
needed to complete it successfully.

GREENPEACE can be its own worst enemy. The sincerity of the protesters
who broke into Sellafield and Aldermaston yesterday should not be
doubted. The demonstration was timed to coincide with the opening in New
York of the international conference to review the future of the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). There is nothing wrong with wanting to
use a demonstration to persuade the world's powers of the need to end
the manufacture of nuclear weapons, but demonstrations should be
peaceful and should observe the law. It is plain fanciful to claim, as
did the Greenpeace spokeswoman, Stephanie Mills, that they were taking
action to do what the NPT had failed to do -- stop the production of
nuclear weapons and plutonium. Extending and strengthening the NPT is
the way to achieve that goal. Direct action of this irresponsible kind
does not help.
When the NPT was first signed 25 years ago all the indications were
that by the end of the century some 20 to 30 countries would have the
bomb, not just the five nuclear states, which include Britain. That
scenario did not work out as more and more countries, with the notable
exceptions of Israel, India, and Pakistan, signed up. A total ban is
not, human nature being what it is, something which could be achieved
overnight, whatever Greenpeace may think. The three nations which have
persistently refused to sign have their own good reasons, and the only
way to persuade them otherwise, let alone outlaw countries like North
Korea or Iraq, is through the diplomatic process, which by its very
nature is a slow process.
Yesterday's shenanigans will not stop the production of anything, no
matter what temporary production stoppages they may have caused. They
will make the name Greenpeace synonymous with silly behaviour. Maybe
Aldermaston marches belong to the past, but surely a demonstration in
which vast numbers of people can be persuaded to take part is the way to
advance a good cause, rather than having 100 or so politically motivated
activists behaving almost like urban terrorists, breaking and entering
private property. The Greenpeace supporters who invaded Sellafield and
Aldermaston claimed to have halted production at the Thermal Oxide
Reprocessing Facility (THORP) at the former, and to have sealed a
discharge pipe carrying contaminated waste into the Thames with concrete
at the latter, causing the plant to shut down. BNFL is right to remind
us that THORP is a civil reprocessing plant, that the uranium and
plutonium recovered there are a valuable energy source, and that
Greenpeace is wrong to link it with the talks in New York.
This is a free society; our right to demonstrate is one to treasure.
But the wrong kind of demonstration damages that right. The activities
of the far left and the far right on other marches, and the way the
police now frequently over-react (as incidents on the picket lines
protesting at live animal exports have demonstrated) are all putting
this traditional right under pressure. Geenpeace's strategy is fine. It
is the tactics that are worrying.
The admission by BNFL that it is impossible to make the Sellafield
site totally secure is surely disingenuous. It may not be possible to
patrol every inch of a long perimeter fence with guards, but modern
surveillance technology should be capable of making it well-nigh
impregnable. Maybe Sellafield is not quite ''the world's nuclear dump''
as Greenpeace claims, but the material involved in reprocessing is
dangerous and should be treated with great respect.

OLD HURTS from the Battle of Wounded Knee still throb. What is to be
done with the Ghost Shirt taken from a warrior killed in that tragic
encounter, and for the last century displayed in this country? Should it
remain on show in Glasgow, or is there a moral obligation to hand it
back? The delegation of American Indians who sought its return have so
far received only an ambiguous answer to their request, having been told
that ''the door is not closed on its repatriation''. This is only one of
an increasing number of claims on museums and art galleries for the
restoration of both artefacts and human remains to the homelands in
which they were discovered -- or, to look at it from another point of
view, from which they were plundered.
Recently American scientists attending an anthropological conference
in California found themselves under attack by African representatives,
accused of stealing fossils in Ethiopia. On the other hand there are
many institutions adapted for the study of ancient material, and science
is best served by holding it there. Yet indigenous communities,
particularly in North America, Australia, and New Zealand, are becoming
increasingly insistent, especially when human remains or items of
spiritual significance are involved, and it is often difficult to
counter their forceful arguments for belated justice. Old bones have
life in them yet.
The last and proper resting place of works of art is just as
contentious. This month saw the opening in St Petersburg of an
exhibition of ''lost'' Impressionist paintings. The euphemism does not
conceal their true origin; to put it bluntly, they were looted from
Germans by Russian troops in the war -- not that the hands of Nazi
invaders were clean in this respect, to look no further. Some
collections brim with spoils of war. In such cases the ethical argument
is clear, though finding a satisfactory solution is usually far from
simple. The sins of colonialism, too, include a fair measure of blatant
theft which must cause a measure of soul-searching in these more
sensitive times. And beyond that there is a vast grey area where rights
and wrongs are difficult to determine. Who is the rightful owner of the
treasures of Troy which the obsessed amateur, Heinrich Schliemann, dug
up from a disregarded mound in Turkey? Are the early archaeologists who
carried off mummies from their desert tombs no better than the grave
robbers who usually got there before them? Should the Elgin marbles be
returned to Greece? The equivocation that for a great part of the time
they may have been in safer hands in London -- and certainly better
conserved than if left to rot in the appallingly polluted atmosphere of
modern Athens -- sounds uncomfortably patronising. Better in our hands
than in yours is a dubious principle, but one which has been used
silently to justify centuries of despoliation.

THIS is a war tale about a house of no fixed address. Today it leaves
its Stirling site. By Friday it will have been rebuilt in Dundee. Wheels
will again be put under it so that postmen will find it variously in
Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dumfries, Greenock, Inverness, and Hamilton. Fifty
years ago, until the war in Europe ended, it was even more all over the
place.
To beat Hitler the house with no home of its own became a showpiece
residence in about 80 streets, including more than a dozen in England.
How it helped to win the war was with money. Visitors paid to look in
on it, although what they paid was not a lot. It took only 2[1/2]p to
view, children half price. But it all added up, the war going on the way
it did.
For all of the summers the fighting lasted Grace Gavin was seldom far
from the house she built. She flitted with it. A dauntless lady, she
must have been as remarkable as the place she created, which was
remarkable indeed; perhaps unique.
At the time such European housing policy as existed was more about
bombing to bits than building. And the Gavin domicile was rarely
commodious, with nine rooms and many extras.
Of considerable acreage were house and garden. Their dimensions were
6x3. Feet, that is. But they added up to more than a doll's house.
Really, a dream house.
It came to embody the ideal home that people fondly imagined they
might live in in the brave new world when the bloody war was over. They
saw themselves in a white-walled villa with a swimming pool in the
garden, a tennis court, a croquet lawn. They dwelt in the dream of the
house of Grace.
In Greenock in a week 6000 paying visitors beat a path to the door.
Setting up her house in shops with hallowed names (Pettigrew and
Stephen, Daly's, Hodge's) Grace Gavin with her family and friends made a
contribution of #8500 to Red Cross parcels for prisoners of war. In
today's collapsed currency that's getting on for #70,000, a mountain of
sixpences and threepenny bits.
The dream house's current circuit from Stirling amounts to a lap of
honour for its war service.
Become a damp nuisance in the garage of Mrs Gavin's two daughters, the
house has been restored in Stirling at the Smith art gallery and museum
by Michael McGinnes, the Smith's collections manager. It has been
rewired. There has been a two-month spring cleaning.
Grace Gavin furnished her dream with bits and pieces found about her
own house. Her DIY was basic. There was a war on, remember. Fancy goods
were scarce. Michael McGinnes's housework was to refurnish a luxurious
way of living that had been put together with scraps of cloth, cigar
boxes, ends of linoleum, cardboard, and old jewellery.
On the house's first tour the Glasgow Herald's sharp eye noted that
the coal scuttles were the black caps off tubes of nail varnish.
Breathlessly was added: ''There are deck chairs which actually fold.''
It wasn't a palace of a place: ''Just the house one pines to own.''
Everywhere the house went on show the papers covered its progress like
a V for Victory parade.
And everywhere with it went Grace Gavin, lugging her dream in lumpy
boxes on crowded trains. To a daughter of the grand Donaldson shipping
family her charitable jaunts must have felt like trips into another
world. Nothing was a bother to her. To put the posh house together in a
jerry-builder's time of four months she had even learned toy carpentry.
She acquired a knack for crude publicity.
When the house moved from Greenock to a direly rival part of
Renfrewshire, she made sure that Greenock's open-handedness got
trumpeted in advance. In her logbook she noted: ''The House goes to
Paisley who are badly shaken by Greenock's awful success, but determined
to do their best.'' (Paisley kept its hands in its pockets, needless to
say.)
When the Queen in Edinburgh in 1942 bought bits of the house's bedroom
suite (for all of #1 10p) Mrs Gavin whooped in her diary: ''We BURST
with pride.'' Modesty was more like her.
Long a stalwart of the Dunblane Players, her local thespian group, she
did some film work after the war. In Floodtide, the 1949 Clydeside
shipbuilding picture, she played Gordon Jackson's landlady. ''That will
be all right if I just have to say uh-huh about twice,'' Grace Gavin
said when offered the part.
Her house's next address is the McManus Galleries, Dundee.

After starring as Kong's handmaiden she became a trivia joke on the
Hollywood glitz circuit. Her later pursuits proved them all wrong
Nearly two decades on from first starring in King Kong, Jessica Lange
collected her second Oscar last month. Douglas Thompson describes her
life in-between and what lies in the future
SHE got the monkey off her back a long time ago so it's a subject to
relegate to second banana time with the actress the increasingly
perceptive Jack Nicholson calls a cross between a delicate fawn and a
Buick.
Jessica Lange is 46 this year. She has made a lot of films and babies.
She is an off-beat beauty: a tall natural blonde with an equally natural
flat nose so unlike these pert little upturned things that sniff around
Beverly Hills. She was a model before she jumped into the arms of Jeff
Bridges and King Kong in 1976.
''Successful model? That's a myth. I doubt that anybody could find a
published photograph of me. The year I modelled was the most painful
year of my life. Editors would always talk to you in the third person as
though you were merely a piece of merchandise. You get to a point where
you are tired of worrying about how people are going to judge you.''
Nearly two decades on, Ms Lange collected her second Oscar last month
-- as Best Actress for Blue Sky in which she co-starred with Tommy Lee
Jones -- and she may be a contender again next year for Losing Isaiah.
Like Lange, it is a formidable piece of work.
The film, directed by Stephen Gyllenhaal, is the Kramer Vs Kramer of
today. It deals with the complex situation of interracial adoption.
Lange is a social worker who adopts a black child. Then the boy's
natural mother, a former crack cocaine addict, wants the child back.
Halle Berry, who stole the frothy The Flintstones last year, plays the
real mother. You can understand the drama and emotions involved. And the
politically correct lobby stalks the corridors of the movie. ''Black
babies belong to black mothers,'' says the lawyer representing Halle
Berry. But, for drama as often now in real life, the adoptive parents
fight back.
They point out that they are teaching the boy about multiracial
culture, about the ethnic melting-pot we all live in. There's a
wonderful line when they explain that the boy watches Sesame Street. To
them it represents all that is good in education and entertainment. The
opposition lawyer quizzes: ''So who is this child to identify with? The
yellow Muppet?''
In America this is called ''transracial adoption'' and there have been
studies showing how the children as they become teenagers feel ''lost''.
They are black with white ''parents'' and the ethnic hook is missing.
The majority, say the surveys, benefit from growing in a family
environment rather than in a crack house in some inner-city slum.
''It is a film with a strong theme and a message,'' says Lange, who
felt ''compelled'' to make the movie. She believes it is an issue which
has side-stepped most of us, a subject which has been withering in the
dark. No longer. She and Halle Berry deliver career performances.
Which is what Lange has been doing since she got out of the clutches
of King Kong. After starring as Kong's handmaiden she became a trivia
joke on the Hollywood glitz circuit. Her later pursuits proved them all
wrong.
She lives in the Virginia countryside with Pulitzer-Prizewinning
writer/actor Sam Sheppard and their son and daughter and her daughter by
ballet maestro Mikhail Baryshnikov, cats, dogs, and any bird that flies
by and wants a meal. In her native countryside of Minnesota she retains
her custom-built log cabin (no phone, no television) and she chops wood
and watches the trout bite.
Now, like Fonda and Streisand, she's a deal-maker. But Lange is not
some snappy tyrant. Movies like Losing Isaiah are a choice made through
many years of playing the Hollywood game. ''In a sense I think I was
lucky because some people take off -- they're flying -- and then
something hits them in mid-career. Suddenly, the bottom falls out. I got
over all this disappointment and rejection and self-doubt and all of
those things were imposed on me for those first couple of years. It was
great, for now I know none of that will ever affect me again -- or as
strongly as it did.''
That uncertain, unsure period ended with Bob Fosse's All That Jazz in
1979. A year later she was in the successful comedy How to Beat the High
Cost of Living. The Kong bad reputation was gone. But she believes it
was in 1980 when she and Nicholson famously took over the kitchen table
in the remake of The Postman Always Rings Twice that her career took
off. The film did not do as well as the 1946 John Garfield/Lana Turner
teaming but it proved something to the critics, to Lange, and to
Hollywood. She had that indefinable ''it''.
She rang the bells again as the hauntingly troubled actress Frances
Farmer in Frances and as the space-cadet soap-opera star adored by
Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie. Those two 1982 films won her double Oscar
nominations as Best Actress (Frances) and Best Supporting Actress
(Tootsie). She jogged off with Best Supporting and then came nominations
for Best Actress for Country (1984) and for portraying country and
western singer Patsy Cline in Sweet Dreams (1985).
She followed that with Crimes of the Heart with Diane Keaton and Sissy
Spacek. She made the three films between pregnancies. This is one of
those coping-with-it-all women.
''The hardest thing is the kids,'' she says. ''It just kills me. The
other stuff isn't hard -- working long hours, doing the whole emotional
thing. But being away from the kids gets worse rather than better. The
thing is you get seduced by a great part. I've always felt that each one
comes at a particular time in your life to give you the means to explore
new areas that are important to delve into. I do think there is some
grander order so you have to be careful what you say no to. But I can
look back from when I really considered myself an actress -- from
Postman -- and I never felt as if I was wasting time playing any of
these roles.
''If I didn't have children I'd be a much better actress. I wouldn't
be so distracted. I could pour 100% of my energies into it, to promote
the investigation which acting is. But I can't do that so I have to pick
and choose really deliberately. I must say there has been a lot of
suffering along the way with misjudgments. But I've got the children,
work I enjoy and the enchanted land.''
On her family land around Cloquet (population: 8000) in Minnesota she
lived as a child being in her dreams Melanie from Gone with the Wind one
day and Scarlett O'Hara the next. Her father Al was a wanderer -- the
family moved 18 times before settling in Minnesota -- and was as much a
dreamer as his daughter. Her mother Dorothy wanted her to be a dancer.
The four children followed their own dreams: Ann, 49, is a Minneapolis
art director; Jane, 46, has a schooner and sails the seas on charter;
George, 39, is another wanderer -- an airline pilot.
Jessica Lange has settled down as one of the great actresses of the
century. During her seven-year relationship with Baryshnikov they jumped
the clouds constantly, flying between Los Angeles and New York and
Minnesota and Milan, anywhere he happened to be dancing and she was
filming. It sounds romantic and exciting but it can jet-lag
relationships. And it did.
Lange was still married then to Spanish photographer Pasco Grande,
whom she met at Minnesota University. They married in 1970 and spent the
early part of their marriage in Paris. But after she met Baryshnikov the
divorce detail got busy. The mess wasn't sorted out until 1982. She had
$3479 in the bank. Grande had settled for a lump-sum pay-off.
It is not that she's Scrooge. She's careful, say her family, who
recall that her first words when she was three were ''Charge it!'' No
money was involved when she and Baryshnikov separated.
She says she identifies so much with Losing Isaiah because she feels
the importance of family. It contradicts her instincts: ''In my mind's
eye I always see myself as settling down but I can't stand to be in the
same place all the time. I love arriving in a town I know nothing about
and setting up house. It's like life in a gipsy camp. But I think it's
inevitable now that we'll stay in one spot -- Sam and me and the kids.
''I've never believed much in marriage, I've never believed that
someone like a preacher or a judge should determine how you live. I
think I would get married if it was in the best interests of the family.
It used to seem like legalese but now, with Sam, I really think I have
something that is going to last a lifetime. Before it was more of
hopefulness on my part rather than an absolute knowing in your heart.
''Before it was a dream. This is reality. No more dreaming.''

A treasure hunt involving a giant of the early railway age proved a
revelation.
JOHN FOWLER reports
WHO knows how long the piles of paper had been mouldering out in the
stables, with the rain dripping through the roof? Who knows what secrets
they would reveal? So when David Buri -- now architecture librarian at
Glasgow School of Art, but at that time working for the Institution of
Civil Engineers -- got the message to investigate, he didn't know what
to expect when his taxi dropped him at a large old villa on the Thames.
It was a revelation. The mass of papers he found there were the
personal and business documents left long ago by William Mackenzie, a
Scots engineer who rose to become one of the giants of the early railway
age, although with the passing of time his pioneering contribution had
been obscured and his name almost forgotten. As Buri worked his way
through the mass of information, carefully peeling off manuscripts and
drawings from the musty piles, he realised that the restoration of a
reputation was in his hands.
One of the positive results of this treasure hunt is an exhibition --
called Mackenzie, Giant of the Railways -- which opens today at
Glasgow's Museum of Transport, after an initial showing at the
institution's headquarters in London.
Buri describes his first confrontation with the raw material as
overwhelming. ''It was one of the most astonishing experiences of my
life,'' he says. ''It was like coming on something unknown by Charles
Rennie Mackintosh.
''A lot of it had been brought into the living room of this big
rambling house and it was lying in great dusty piles all over the place,
mostly rolled up and tied with pink ribbon.'' As he looked at it he felt
it would crumble to dust in his hands.
Among it all were letters written to Mackenzie by the great engineer
Thomas Telford, and a collection of beautifully coloured and
immaculately drawn original plans of bridges, viaducts, and other civil
engineering works Mackenzie had overseen.
Last week Michael Chrimes, librarian of the Insitution of Civil
Engineers, was in Glasgow helping to mount the exhibition. He explained
how it came about.
''About five years ago a Miss Mackenzie, a great great niece of
William Mackenzie, got in touch to say that she had all his family
papers at her home near Henley. He died in 1850 and although his name
occurs here and there he had lapsed into obscurity.''
All the papers had been stored in former stables and some were in a
parlous state, almost like soggy blotting paper. But the institution set
about conserving the material, and after a lengthy process it was saved
for posterity. Without this timely intervention, it might have been lost
irretrievably, and Mackenzie would have remained a figure in the
shadows.
The exhibition draws on other material including early photographs,
but in the main it consists of salvaged letters, diaries, and -- most
attractive of all -- plans and drawings of many of the works on which
Mackenzie was engaged. It includes a painting Mackenzie commissioned of
himself standing at the Bishopton cutting on the Glasgow to Greenock
line, a difficult job which he was particularly proud of. In this and
another presentation portrait he is shown, in Chrimes' words, as ''tall,
stout, with sideburns and a rather imperial look about him''.
Mackenzie rose from humble origins to become one of the great and
wealthy international entrepreneurs of the early railway age, a friend
and colleague of such celebrated pioneers as Joseph Locke and Thomas
Brassey. Samuel Smiles in his near contemporary biography of George
Stephenson mentions a meeting in Paris between the grand old man of
railways and ''Mr Mackenzie, the contractor for the Orleans and Tours
Railway''. But his name gradually slipped from recognition after his
death at a relatively early age.
He did not have an easy death, according to Chrimes. ''He got gangrene
of the leg in 1849 and bits of his foot kept dropping off. His last
months must have been miserable.''
Mackenzie's father came from the Inverness area but moved to Glasgow
where he worked as a navvy on the Forth and Clyde canal. William was
born in 1794 after another move to England.
At first he tried his hand at weaving but was so disgruntled with the
work that it's said he broke his loom. Then he was apprenticed to a firm
of lock carpenters, and it was when he was working for them on the
construction of Troon dry dock that he first met Thomas Telford. Telford
appreciated the young man and Mackenzie assisted him on several
projects, including the construction of Craigellachie bridge.
Being talented and ambitious, he became an engineer himself -- he was
Telford's resident engineer when the Mythe bridge near Tewkesbury was
built -- and from the 1820s he worked on many canal and bridge projects
until swept up in the mini railway boom of the 1830s. He went into
partnership with Thomas Brassey in the 1840s and, from then on, either
in partnership or on his own, he was in business as a major contractor.
With Brassey he built the railway line from Lancaster to Glasgow --
now part of the main west coast line -- and several lines in Scotland.
He became heavily involved in railway building abroad, constructing the
Paris-Le Havre-Rouen route, and early railways in Spain, Belgium, and
Italy. He was, says Chrimes, ''one of the first Euro capitalists''.
And from being born into a labouring family, he died a wealthy man.
* The exhibition Mackenzie -- Giant of the Railways is at the Museum
of Transport, Glasgow, until June 20.

As France prepares to vote, Nicholas Powell describes how the build-up
has been strong on pictures but short on ideas
THE other evening, a picture of extreme right-wing leader Jean-Marie
Le Pen, 66, was projected several storeys high on to buildings along the
banks of the River Seine from a cruising pleasure boat, while
top-ranking National Front officials sat down to a black-tie dinner on
board.
Minutes before that, during a radio debate, 55-year-old Arlette
Laguiller, Trotskyist and presidential candidate for the fourth time,
had silenced the aggressively garrulous deputy leader of the National
Front, Bruno Megret, going for him like a terrier after a rat: ''Even if
you do not have blood on your hands you have blood on your tongue. You
and your sort are not wanted in France,'' she snapped.
It was an unusually violent moment in a presidential campaign which
began unofficially last September and has seen all parties avoiding such
direct confrontation.
The major concerns are France's very serious domestic problems: a
record number of 3.3 million unemployed, increasing poverty and
homelessness, and how best to court economic recovery. With nine
candidates moving into the final stretch for first-round voting on
Sunday, to be followed on May 7 by a second-round vote between just two
of them, the tone of the campaign is rising to a shrill peak.
The 1995 fight for a seven-year stint at the Elysee has been dominated
more than any previous campaign by opinion polls and tailored for
television -- strong on pictures, short on ideas. Some of the images
have been memorable. Gaullist candidate Jacques Chirac, aged 62, his
hair Brylcreemed back and his face frozen into the same manic smile, was
recently greeted by thousands of screaming, poster-waving teenagers in
Paris's largest sports hall like a cult rock star.
The other Gaullist candidate, Edouard Balladur, was last week courting
an agricultural vote and being photographed shaking the hands of many
farmers in the centre of France.
Latest polls give Chirac 26% of the votes, Socialist candidate Lionel
Jospin, 57, 21%, and Balladur, 65, who was once tipped to win by a long
chalk, only 19%. While pretending to scorn the polls, each political
chief of staff is in fact obsessed by them, and the big question
dictating each major candidate's strategy is who will go through to the
second round on May 7.
Particularly worried is Mr Balladur, who has started launching attacks
on Jospin and the socialists' record in government during the 1980s, in
an effort to overtake him and get through to the second and final round
of the election with his real enemy, Chirac.
France had not experienced such a battle between two right-wing
candidates since George Pompidou defeated Alain Poher to become
successor to General De Gaulle in 1969. The violence of the current
fight between two camps from within the Gaullist family which dominates
the national assembly has even led to fears that the parliamentary
majority could break up once the election is over.
To calm such anxiety, both Mr Balladur and Mr Chirac recently promised
they would not dissolve the assembly if they were elected.
With the far right-wing ground monopolised by Mr Le Pen, the
independent extremist Philippe de Villiers, 46, and the maverick
candidate Jacques Cheminade, 53, the political platforms of Chirac and
Balladur both occupy centre-right territory. The differences between the
two men are more questions of image and of personality than of content.
Chirac is leading a breathless tub-thumping campaign throughout the
country with a strongly patriotic and republican tone. A marked
conservative during his 30 years in politics, he has adopted a brand-new
populist image and has argued over the past six months that distinctions
between left wing and right wing are obsolete. He has kicked against not
only the socialists' record, but what he claims is the lack of dynamism
of Balladur's government, appointed in 1993.
A strong pro-European, handicapped by the fact he is still busy
governing the country as Prime Minister and by a pronounced dislike for
the meetings and handshaking of politics, Balladur is basing his
campaign on his record as premier since 1993 and pledging cautious
commitment to further economic improvement. Unemployment is his main
priority.
Socialist candidate Jospin, meanwhile, nominated earlier this year by
a party in a state of virtual collapse, has run a remarkable campaign
aimed at uniting left-wing voters and talking himself out of the
dreadful record of the socialist governments of the 1980s.
He has two energetic candidates on his far left -- Robert Hue, 48, who
looks like sailing the Communist Party out of its historic doldrums to
score 10%, and Trotskyist Laguiller who, thanks to a virulent and
radical campaign promising to outlaw redundancy in profit-making
companies and increasing wages, could obtain as many as 5% of votes.
Ecologist Dominique Voynet, 36, meanwhile, is heading for 3%.
Pleading for a ''useful vote'' on April 23 to concentrate left-wing
votes on his own count and away from Hue and Laguiller in order to take
him through to the second round, Jospin is now hoping for a presidential
blessing from Francois Mitterrand.
Under a socialist presidency, working hours would be reduced to 37 per
week by 1997 and major building programmes launched to improve France's
rundown high-rise suburban areas. A former Minister for Education,
Jospin would also make a priority of improving schooling.

Power struggle of
the union barons
With top posts at the four largest unions up for grabs, Labour will be
watching closely. Roy Rogers reports
THE power and influence of the union ''barons'' may not be as strong
as in days of old but they still control 70% of the votes at Labour's
annual policy-making conference and Labour leaders will take a keen
interest in forthcoming elections for the top posts at Britain's four
largest unions.
Most intriguing will be the battle for the general secretaryship of
the Transport and General Workers Union, the largest Labour Party
affiliate, where Mr Bill Morris has gambled by putting himself up for
re-election a year early.
Morris became Britain's first black trade union leader when he
defeated right-wing TGWU Welsh regional secretary George Wright in 1991,
but since then he and the union's left wing which supported him have
seldom seen eye to eye on anything.
A desire to placate the left may account for Mr Morris's apparent
wavering over the controversial issue of Labour leader Tony Blair's
crusade to rewrite Clause 4 of the party constitution to soften its
traditions demands for the nationalisation.
It is said that Morris gave personal assurances to Blair that he would
try to win his union away from its traditional pro-Clause 4 position.
But he subsequently went on the record as being opposed to any
redrafting of Clause 4, a stance, which while it may have won him some
favour on his own executive, so upset the Labour Party that an anonymous
party spokesman hit out at his ''confused, muddled, and pusillanimous''
behaviour.
Last week a special session of the 30-strong TGWU executive agreed to
stand by Clause 4 and oppose the softer Blair option although the final
decision will be taken by the union's delegation to the April 29 special
Labour Party conference.
In addition to the wrangle over Clause 4 there are also many who have
had their noses put out of joint by reorganisation moves and financial
restructuring forced through by Morris after years of prevarication by
his predecessors.
Morris's apparently shrewd move was clearly designed to catch any
potential challengers off guard and see himself restored to general
secretaryship for ''life'' -- that is until retirement age in eight
years -- before his union's biennial conference in July.
But he reckoned without the ambition of national officer Jack Dromey
who decided he was not prepared to wait for up to eight years and who
has brushed aside suggestions from Mr Morris and others that any
challenge from sitting full-time officials is exploitation of Tory
anti-trade union laws which demand period re-elections.
Neither Morris nor Dromey can easily be tagged as being from the left
or the right although Jack Dromey's links to Labour -- his wife Harriet
Harman is Shadow Employment Secretary -- will almost certainly mean the
contest being portrayed as traditionalist against moderniser.
Mr Morris has found it is difficult to lead without the support of the
union's lay executive which in recent years has had a definite left-wing
complexion -- although that might change, at least in theory, when
executive elections come round again early next year. There is no reason
to believe that Mr Dromey would fare any better.
Meanwhile, Britain's largest union Unison is poised to call its first
general secretary election since it was formed by the amalgamation of
Nalgo, Nupe, and the health union Coshe two years ago.
Under the terms of the amalgamation, Nalgo's Alan Jinkinson was to be
Unison general secretary for the first two years after which Nupe's
Rodney Bickerstaffe would be given a relatively clear run.
However, under law any Unison member can stand against him and he is
by no means assured of victory bearing in mind the electorates come from
three previously separate unions and that almost one million of the 1.3
million members are women.
It is generally assumed that Mr Bickerstaffe will be elected but that
he will probably be the last male general secretary of this
female-dominated union. The charismatic 50-year-old has been maintaining
a low profile recently.
More immediate will be the battle to secure the presidency of the
Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union left vacant by the move to
Brussels of Mr Bill Jordan as the first British general secretary of the
International Confederation of Free Trades Unions.
Traditionally Scotland in general and Clydeside in particular have had
a major influence in the engineering industry. Scottish engineering
prowess was recognised throughout the world -- wherever Scottish ships,
locomotives, boilers, and other heavy equipment was exported. So much so
that when the American science-fiction TV series Star Trek was written
30 years ago it was obvious that the engineer should be a Scot --
''Scottie''.
The general secretaryship of the old Amalagamated Engineering Union
has been held by Scots for more than 20 years although Sir Gavin Laird,
who succeeded Sir John Boyd, has announced that he intends to retire
this summer.
The Scottish stranglehold on the general secretaryship of the
Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions has already been
broken with Tynesider Alan Robson succeeding the late Alec Ferry who led
the CSEU for many years after succeeding fellow Scot Jack Service.
Scottish executive councillor Jimmy Airlie has made it clear that he
will not stand for the presidency as he too will take early retirement
to coincide with his sixtieth birthday on November 1996.
The ''official'' right-wing and left-wing candidates -- North-east
executive councillor Jackie Crystal and Tyneside district secretary
Davey Hall -- are both Tony Blair supporters as indeed is the unofficial
right-wing candidate Mr John Allan from the key Midlands region.
The general secretaryship of the General Municipal and Boilermakers
will also be up for grabs soon although the incumbent John Edmonds would
appear to be as secure as anyone.

Does fox-hunting perform a necessary function? Aileen Little argues
that the question is irrelevant
FROM Aesop to La Fontaine, from Uncle Remus to Beatrix Potter, the
fox's predatory instincts are the stuff of folk tales. But research
shows the animal's farmyard appetites are, to some extent, just that --
a fiction. Yet Britain's 206 registered fox-hunts use the ''control''
argument to justify their actions.
They are helping farmers, they say, contributing to conservation by
slaughtering 15,000 foxes a year.
It is hard to imagine a more tangled web. The fox-hunting debate is
muddled by facts and philosophies drawn from different ideological and
scientific frameworks. The recent Wild Mammals (Protection) Bill
designed to protect animals from being hunted by hounds, marks the first
time in history Parliament has voted to ban fox-hunting. But as a
fragile Private Members Bill, its translation into law may depend on
disentangling the contentious issues of ethics and wildlife management.
Central to the debate is the question of whether foxes really need to
be controlled at all: their perceived role as predators of livestock is
the pro-hunting lobby's trump card. Look at the cards, however, and you
meet a clash of evidence. On the one hand, scientific research claims
the fox is a victim of myth; on the other, farmers insist they are a
menace.
New research by Oxford University Zoology Department (due to be
published next spring in a book on the exploitation of mammals) surveyed
867 farmers in 10 regions of England about their attitude to foxes. The
animals' major impact, according to this case study, is not on lambs as
generally claimed, but on game birds ''the loss of lambs to foxes is the
most debated, but little quantified topic'', say the authors. Fifty
three per cent of farmers reported they had lost lambs to foxes; only
39.1% of these had witnessed any attacks first hand.
This disparity crops up also in research carried out by Aberdeen
University in 1990. ''It follows that the less active the shepherd in
searching for lamb carcasses -- and lambs die in holes, in streams, on
cliff ledges and tall bracken -- the greater the alleged predation,''
points out the author whose work was conducted over three years on the
Eriboll estate in Argyll.
Twelve foxes were fitted with radio collars during that period to
study movements in relation to lambing areas. By withdrawing all fox
control from Eriboll, no evidence was found of increased killing of
lambs. Nor, indeed, was there any increase in the number of foxes.
''Many shepherds . . . including some of the most experienced, do not
complain of losses,'' concludes the author who saw the problem as part
of -- rather than in addition to -- the normal scale of lamb losses.
The Oxford research is a collaboration between the Universities
Federation for Animal Welfare and the Mammal Society, while the Aberdeen
report was commissioned by the League Against Cruel Sports. Both were
carried out by non-partisan scientists. But lest even-handedness be in
any doubt, it's worth noting the Ministry of Agriculture describes the
predation of lambs by foxes as ''insignificant'': one in 200 lambs falls
victim to a fox, while between 10% and 24% die of malnutrition, disease
or are stillborn. Foxes seen in fields of lambs are likely to be looking
for corpses.
But farmers tell a different story. Mrs Janet Marshall owns a 26-acre
livestock farm in Ayrshire. She loves animals and is current chairperson
of the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. ''I
took the precaution of keeping pregnant ewes and lambs indoors till
three weeks old,'' she says. But neighbours were less fortunate and
farmers cannot afford to be sentimental. Mrs Marshall adds: ''In one
day, a fox killed nine of one farmer's lambs. He went out with a halogen
light and shot it. Another neighbour told me a fox on my land was
killing his lambs so I paid a retired gamekeeper to shoot it.''
Mrs Marshall has never forgotten the day she witnessed the sickening
conclusion of the Renfrewshire hunt. She advocates a different method:
''One clean shot and that's the end of the matter.'' In her experience,
most farmers prefer to control foxes themselves.
Some, like Ronald Barge -- now retired -- club together to employ a
crackshot fox-hunter. A countryman with deep concern for animal welfare,
and a former director of the SSPCA, Mr Barge believes foxes are a
''severe nuisance''. ''One has to be sensible,'' he says. ''On my
1500-acre Argyll farm I lost 20 to 30 lambs in the season.'' He is
sceptical about research with contrary findings. ''It depends, for
example, on the rabbit and vole population.''
So who is right? Farmer or scientist? Does fox-hunting have reason to
plead it performs a necessary function? Surely the question is
irrelevant? Whether or not control is desirable, fox-hunting is no way
to go about it. Some animal lovers are even prepared to accept that
hounds dispatch a fox quickly but, as Ronald Barge explains, this is to
miss the point. ''Nothing alters the fact the fox has been driven to
exhaustion. The real cruelty lies in the terror and trauma inflicted by
the chase. I find the killing of a creature for amusement morally
unacceptable.'' Mrs Marshall agrees. ''The SSPCA is totally opposed to
fox-hunting.''
What seems most objectionable about fox-hunting is not the hypocrisy
of the ''control'' argument (research has shown that Britain's 250,000
foxes regulate their own numbers and fox-hunting kills only 6%). Nor is
it even the cringe-making moment of death -- most likely, the fox is
dead before being torn apart. It is the fact the chase is classed as
sport. Humans are seen to be taking pleasure in torment.
In his published diaries, Alan Clark MP hit the nail on the head. The
well-known vegetarian and animal welfarist records the time he felt
driven to shoot a heron which habitually helped itself to carp from his
castle moat. After doing the deed, Clark felt stricken with
self-loathing. ''Why should I kill that beautiful creature just for the
sodding fish?'' he asked himself. ''It's human beings that are the
vermin.''

JOE DONNELLY concludes the series by looking at the lifestyle of the
single man down through the years and finds that little has changed
BUSTER POINDEXTER had an altogether different approach from Sandy
Posey, who said the single girl needed a man to lean on. Old Buster's
leanings, more than a generation before the sixties, reflected a male
notion that would have been recognised down the centuries.
''I'm staying single,'' sang bachelor Buster, '' 'cos I do as I
please.''
He could do as he pleased: stay out all night with the boys, go
fishing, smoke, fight, drink, make merry, chase girls, and still be a
great guy.
For men, the single status has never been a reason for pity. Men don't
look at each other's ringless fingers and think of the bachelor as a
poor soul.
No matter what the culture, celibacy, the state of avoiding marriage
has been a masculine thing. Women have had one purpose: to marry, bear
children, carry heavy things. Men have had choices, simply because they
cannot bear children. They have had no weight to carry, no bags and
baggage to slow them down. They have therefore been light-footed, fancy
free.
State-of-the-art bachelorhood draws its roots from primitive times.
Men like Buster Poindexter stayed single because somebody bigger,
better, tougher, and richer, bagged all the women. At least, that was
how it was in times gone by.
You had to have land to wed. In fact, the word bachelor comes from the
Latin for ''small farmer'', maybe one who didn't have quite enough land.
You had to have property, or be prepared to fight suitors, or carry out
Herculean tasks because her father wasn't too sure of your credentials.
Nowadays, he might want to see a bankbook or check your redundancy
prospects and pension plan; but a man doesn't have to cut off Gorgon's
heads.
Yet there are plenty of bachelors about. Statistics show that their
numbers are on the increase. In one decade alone, the greedy eighties,
male marriage rates dropped by more than 30%. The proportion of young
men who decided to do as they please increased dramatically. While more
and more single, divorced, or separated women are at least prepared to
co-habit, more and more men want to lead a solitary existence.
Grizzly Adams, John the Baptist, Captain Ahab: they chose the
wilderness or the sea. Richard Burton (the explorer, not the serial
wedlocker) might have been married, the amount of time he spent away
from home. Ditto Charles Darwin, Magellan, Captain Cook. Married they
might have been, but they were all clearly men to whom the pleasures of
the single life beckoned irresistibly. Once wed, they couldn't wait to
get back out to play for extended periods.
If there is a cultural change, then it is a change for women. Men are
exactly where they always were, except there are simply more of them.
The married ones look with envy on the footloose; the stay-at-homes
dream of being adventurous.
* SCOTT WILSON, 27, graduate, is still on the adventure and is in no
hurry to get down to serious nestbuilding, even though he does have a
nice flat of his own.
A Kelvinside man, he gained a degree in English and history, did a
postgraduate degree in marketing, worked for a year, and then went off
to see some of the world. He spent a year teaching spoken English
language to businessfolk in Seville and Madrid.
''That gave me a taste of real freedom,'' Scott said. ''Once you have
a taste of it, it's not easy to consider giving it up. I've just moved
through to Glasgow from Edinburgh, and I must say, it's better to be
single there because you can stay out in pubs until two or three in the
morning if the notion takes you, and there seem to be more single people
as well. Here in Glasgow, with the exception of Mayfest, you have to go
home early.''
Scott, a public relations consultant with Young Publicity in Glasgow,
said the single life means night life: pubs and clubs where a single man
not on the hunt for a proposal can meet his peers -- pubs mainly.
''Leith was great,'' said Scott, who likes steak, drives a Renault
Clio, and likes to go to Europe on holiday. ''The King's Wark, Bar Kohl,
the Last Drop. There's a big design community in Leith, plus plenty of
media and professional people. Many of them, maybe even most of them,
are single.
''Here in Glasgow I'm still a bit out of touch, but I'm finding some
good places. Most of my friends in Glasgow are single. In fact, apart
from friends who were already married when I met them, only one of my
close friends and acquaintances has got married since I've known him.
''However, the life of a bachelor is not all that different from what
it was years ago, I suppose. There's not really a lot more to do, if
you're not sporty. I play golf, but I'm a fair-weather player, and
plenty of married people play, too. There's the cinema, but mostly it's
nights out with the boys, and the girls, too.
''I think that, while single is fine, people get a bit more scared of
being on their own when they are older. Also, for the past 10 years or
more, they have been climbing the career ladder, making their way in the
world. They've fought some battles and achieved a few things. Now they
feel a bit settled.''
So why stay single? ''I think, practically, more people are in further
education, going on to college and university and not completing that
until they are in their twenties. They don't start their careers until
later. In the sixties people left school, went to work, got married. For
many reasons, that's just not happening now. Some folk feel that getting
married and starting a family too early will hold them back in their
early careers.
''As for women, they quite rightly want a career for themselves and
they, too, are less inclined to want to settle down.
''For men and women, there's not a great antipathy towards marriage.
Just no rush; and that's pretty healthy and wise. There's no cultural
pressure these days.
''People are getting married later, making the choice when they are
more mature, when they have done many of the things they have set out to
achieve.
''I don't feel any urgency to settle down, but who knows what will
happen in the future.''
* MIKE MACDONALD is 35 and dresses like somebody a decade younger.
He's got a sharp, young man's haircut. His current girlfriend looks like
she could be his daughter, and no, he didn't want his real name used.
''And no pictures, either,'' he said. ''It'll just make the other guys
jealous.''
Some indeed might be. This writer has seen the girlfriend. This writer
has also seen Mike's motorbike, an electric blue tourer that matches
exactly his electric blue helmet and spaceman's suit. The bike is a
lovely piece of machinery and the girlfriend is a lovely addendum, and
she listens intently to every word.
''Married? Are you kidding? he protested. ''That would just tie me
down.'' But what about the bungalow and the mortgage? ''That's
different. That's my pad, man.'' He doesn't quite say ''Yo! Baby!'' but
you expect it. He's wearing an ecology-correct Tibetan yak-wool jacket
and drinks straight malt. He is a financial adviser, selling insurance,
lives in Glasgow's South Side and drives a Rover.
''Couldn't afford to get married,'' he said, and anyway, I'm never at
home. Wouldn't be fair on the weans. I have to be up early in the
morning, and I'm not back till late. I spend the weekends out on the
bike, or out with the mates. Discos, pubs, that kind of thing.
''I like being single. I nearly got married once after I stayed with a
girl for a couple of years, but I couldn't take the pressure: or she
couldn't. Anyway, if we'd got married I'd be paying a fortune in a
divorce settlement by now. I've pals who've got divorced and it's
costing them plenty. I don't want that to happen to me.
Any setbacks to being a bachelor? ''Doing the hoovering and the
ironing, and cleaning up after parties. My mother does my washing for
me, and I go to her for my tea a couple of nights a week. She likes to
pamper me.''
* Civil engineer WILLIAM THOMSON said: ''I play rugby every Saturday.
We train at least twice a week, and then we go for a beer. On Tuesdays I
play squash and in the summer it's either cycling or Munro bagging.''
William hopes to become an associate with his company in the next year
or so, and he's got his eyes on a partnership in a couple of years after
that.
''Probably by then I'll get married, but not yet. There are too many
things to do. I don't think I'd get the time if I had to think of
somebody else. I've always been into team games, physical stuff. I'd
miss the company. Maybe you get addicted to it, but there are plenty of
people on the team who aren't married.
''In fact, there's hardly anybody who is. Any time one of the boys
gets married, it's like we've lost one. Sure enough, they start coming
to the pub less; you don't see them at training; they start to settle
down.
''Most of the boys have girlfriends, including myself, but the girls
seem to realise that we want to get as much out of life before our knees
and cartilages go.
''But it's hard to think of settling down and being responsible.
There's no need to do that. At our dances there's always stacks of girls
who aren't married. Girls in their late twenties and early thirties.
They don't seem in any rush. I work hard and I play hard and there's not
much time for anything else.''

It's not so difficult to travel with young children, and they can
bring some unexpected benefits, as Andrew Popple found on a trip to
China
You've spent years as an independent traveller, and then as a couple,
seeing the sights of Scotland, Europe, the world. With nobody else to
think of but yourself. Now life has caught up with you -- you are a
family! Does this mean the end of holidaying as you know it?
Not entirely, as we found out a few years ago when we took our
daughter, then four months old, on a 10-day tour of China. True, we were
not brave enough to go independent, but escorted tours in China a few
years ago were harder work than go-it-alone in many other places. The
initial reactions of our fellow travellers were predictable -- from
doubting our sanity to quite open hostility. But within a day or so
attitudes had mellowed; then she became tour mascot; at the end she was
star attraction.
Why? First, she caused little or no disruption to the group. Secondly,
she opened doors where we were otherwise refused entry, and was of
interest to our hosts. It wasn't every day they saw a round-eyed baby in
a pink sunhat -- we were giving them something in return for showing us
their way of life. Especially important to us as we considered this kind
of tour holiday to be akin to voyeurism.
There are lots of things to bear in mind if you wish to take a baby
out of a western-type environment. Health, climate, and feeding
arrangements are the most important. Sorting it all out makes for a
better chance you'll have a hassle-free holiday, not least because you
will be more relaxed. Babies and children pick up on signals like this,
and a relaxed you is more likely to lead to a well-behaved, happy little
traveller.
Need it be said, always check with your GP if you plan such a trip. He
can advise on precautions to take and provide a list of medicines, etc
you may need. We carried a small pack of pediatric stuff labelled
''Don't Panic''. Remember, too, that although your baby is travelling
free or nearly, you must confirm your travel and health insurance covers
all of you.
The likely climate will determine what clothes you take, how easy it
will be to dry them after washing -- and therefore how many to take. And
what mood your baby is likely to be in. Babies can get irritable and
fail to sleep easily when it is hot and humid. Strange bedding
arrangements and constant travelling makes it worse. Our daughter spent
at least one night in a suitcase -- open, of course -- where no cots
were available. We were travelling in late summer, possibly the best
time of all to take a small child. Warm sunny days, cool nights, and no
rain.
I am sure that it is possible to bottlefeed a baby on such a holiday,
but it is undoubtedly more difficult and more risky. A feeding mother
is, however, likely to find it and the travelling very tiring. Setting
up and breaking camp at each stop, pocketing odd items of food for her
snacks later on, and being chief nappy changer, are the partner's
duties. They gain lots of brownie points with the other females in the
party. Priority is to keep the feeding mum healthy.
But beware of the unexpected . . . We were able to get a babysitter
for the evening of the Tour Banquet, and she duly turned up, a
16-year-old Chinese girl and her younger sister. Through an interpreter
she was told to leave our sleeping baby alone, who we expected, as usual
to sleep the night through. We arrived back to find said infant on the
girl's knee, being fed cow's milk with a spoon. And it was not
pasteurised ''foreigners milk'', it was the untreated local milk.
They just could not resist fondling the first European baby they had
ever seen, and had woken her up -- and were terrified at what we would
say. But no harm was done.
What else to consider? Take nappies with you, hundreds of them. The
first law of travel says that if you plan to be able to cope with losing
a bag, it won't happen. The second law says: or you lose the lot. I
backpacked a week's supply of nappies, and as many again were spread
around our bags. Don't count at all on finding a supply nearby, and in
any case the tour itinerary is unlikely to include ''Pampers Stop -- 15
minutes'' on the day you need them. The upside is that you have plenty
of space for souvenirs on the way out.
How did our daughter open doors? Chinese holidaymakers were
unfailingly friendly and helpful, and we were happy to hand her over for
inclusion in ''family'' photographs, getting into interesting
conversations as a result. A surprisingly large number of ordinary
Chinese spoke some conversational English, and we learned much.
We were offered a ''cultural'' visit to somewhere of our choosing, and
a number of us asked if we could visit a school. Once it was established
the baby was coming too, we got permission and spent a most interesting
afternoon, while the older pupils entertained her, much to their
delight. It was at this point that the most hardened anti-baby in the
party declared that we had given something in return for a change, and
our daughter's value to the tour was acknowledged.
Such trips aren't easy, but this was one of the best holidays we have
had, including those as pre-family independent travellers. Plan it
reasonably well, go with the right attitude, and enjoy -- your baby will
too. Ours did, and she has the photos to prove it!

<TEXT>
BUS passengers in Dundee next month will see the end of that frantic
fumble for change to pay their fares.
A #250,000 initiative means journeys can be paid for with a plastic
''smart card''.
The cards are drawn through an electronic reading machine once the
passenger has informed the driver of his or her destination. The cost of
the fare is deducted and any credit remaining will be displayed on the
back of the card.
Cards will be sold in #5 and #10 values and also a #7 ticket covering
10 journeys.
The Flexible Fare scheme is to operate on all 140 of Tayside Public
Transport's double-deck vehicles in Dundee.
Mr Jack Henry, chief executive of Tayside Public Transport, which is
the largest worker-owned company in Britain, said: ''This new scheme
will give greater flexibility to our passengers. Paying the exact fare
with change when you get on a bus can be a problem for people.''
He added: ''The new card is not time barred like weekly or monthly
passes and can be passed among people.
''A whole family can travel on a bus just using the one card.
''I believe that people will soon discover the advantages of this new
system.''
Passengers are still able to pay for their fares with money or buy
passes covering a specific time period.

ON the eve of the second reading of the Bill to create a Scottish
Environmental Protection Agency, the Government proposals were condemned
as ''a missed opportunity to safeguard Scotland's environment''.
The attack on the proposed legislation came from Mr Ian McCall,
conservation officer with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds
in Scotland.
He claimed that Sepa's ''limited remit'' would leave Scotland in a
worse position than other parts of the country.
The new agency is intended to take on the role of the River
Purification Boards, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution, and local
authority waste functions.
However, the RSPB claims its powers and scope are inferior to those of
the National Rivers Authority, its English equivalent.
It wants the Government to give Sepa a ''duty to further
conservation'' rather than simply to ''have regard to conservation''.
''The Government has chosen to take a minimalist approach by creating
an agency which is solely a pollution control body which will be unable
to address other issues affecting the environment,'' said Mr McCall.
He added: ''Threats to the environment do not come from pollution
alone. Sepa will, for example, be unable to regulate water abstraction,
fisheries or to facilitate the improved management of water
catchments.''
The RSPB is also concerned that the Bill introduces a cost duty
benefit on the agency.
Mr McCall said:''As the Bill stands, the agency will be driven by
financial considerations alone and environmental factors will lose out.
''The RSPB recommends that Sepa should be given environmental quality
targets which it must achieve and which will be taken into account as
well as the financial bottom line when the agency plans its work.''
Conservation bodies are also concerned that Sepa has not been given a
clear duty to control integrated catchment management, meaning that it
is not directly involved in issues such as acidification, nutrient
enrichment, and flood alleviation.
Mr McCall said: ''The Forth River Purification Board, with the
Scottish Agricultural College and Scottish Natural Heritage, has
launched a catchment project around Loch Leven. This is a very positive
step but we need reassurance that such approaches can continue with
Sepa.
''Many of the problems which affect species such as black-throated
divers need to be addressed at a catchment-wide level and SNH alone is
unable to do this. SNH themselves have recommended that Sepa should have
this role so that the two bodies can work together in such situations.''

POACHERS who set snares to catch deer in woods near Greenock could
have killed a child, an inspector with the Scottish Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals claimed yesterday.
Mr John Wilson, an inspector with the SSPCA, who is investigating the
death of a farmer's bullock which became caught in a wire trap, said:
''This would have taken a kiddie's head clean off.''
He said the bullock had caught its neck in a wire noose as it walked
along a dirt track and, as it struggled, the animal lost its footing and
slipped on the sloping embankment. The woods are near the Gibshill
housing estate in Greenock.
''This illustrates completely why we want these snares banned
altogether. I have seen horrors in the past where cats and dogs have
been trapped in them but this latest incident is beyond belief. The
bullock must have died a terrible death in very distressing
circumstances.
''The snare was set about three to four feet off the ground,
presumably for deer which are regularly seen in the area. But this whole
hillside is used as a recreational spot for youngsters from the near-by
housing scheme. We saw two young lads on a scrambling bike when we were
up there. If they had run into this trap, or any others which might be
out there, it would have decapitated them,'' he said.
SSPCA officers hauled the animal's carcass off the steep hillside
using a four-wheel- drive vehicle and winching equipment. The animal
would have been worth #600.
Constable Donald MacCuish, of Greenock police said the snare could
have been set for ''a long, long time'' and that the bullock had been
dead for a few days.
However, he added that he did not believe that children were in
serious danger as the spot was very inaccessible and youngsters on
scrambling bikes would have found it very difficult to reach.
He added that police had searched the woods thoroughly and were
confident that no other snares had been left.

THE Irish Prime Minister has apologised for using strong language
during an interview with a radio journalist last week.
Mr John Bruton told the reporter he was ''sick answering questions
about the fucking peace process'' in Northern Ireland.
He has sent a letter of apology to Cork radio station 96FM, after
making the remark in an interview with journalist Cathy Farrell.
Mr Bruton's comment came last week when he was asked about Northern
Ireland by Ms Farrell, and afterwards he asked her to switch off a tape
recorder.
''I really regret causing offence but my remarks were directed at the
situation I found myself in and not at Cathy Farrell, who is a reporter
I hold in the highest esteem,'' Mr Bruton wrote.
He said the interview had been organised by his Fine Gael party, and
his frustration had arisen because of constant questions about the peace
process, when there was nothing new to say.
Mr Bruton's outburst was criticised yesterday by Dublin's Fianna Fail
opposition party, which described the comment as ''an outrageous
statement''.
Meanwhile, 200 police officers were drafted in yesterday to prevent a
loyalist parade through a flashpoint Catholic area of Belfast.
The march by a flute band and two dozen members of the Apprentice Boys
was diverted away from the Lower Ormeau Road, where protesters had
gathered to object. The parade passed off without incident.
Royal Ulster Constabulary chiefs announced a decision to re-route the
parade just before it was due to start at Ballynafeigh, on the far side
of the River Lagan, in the predominently Protestant Upper Ormeau Road
area.
Security chiefs feared there could be violence if the march was
allowed through on its way to a bigger parade in Bangor, County Down.
In February 1992, loyalist gunman shot dead five Catholics at a
bookmakers' in the Lower Ormeau Road and, since then, nationalists have
objected to Protestant parades through their area.
Another parade, this time involving Orangemen on their way to a
traditional church service, is planned for next Sunday. The RUC has been
urged to divert it also.

THE Libyan leader, Colonel Muammar al-Gaddafi, has signalled the
''greenest of green lights'' for a Tory MP's formula to end the legal
stalemate over two Libyans accused of the Lockerbie bombing.
Mr Allan Stewart, the MP for Eastwood, who has just returned from
Tripoli, will now press home his case for allowing them to be tried
under Scots law in a third country.
He has proposed a clause to the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill which
would allow a Scottish court, complete with Scottish judge and jury, to
try the case abroad.
However, the former Scottish Office Minister emphasized that the
Libyans' defence lawyers still maintained their strong reservations
about such a trial.
Mr Stewart flew to Libya last week to discuss his clause with senior
Libyan government officials and other interested parties, including the
legal team.
The visit overran because of an invitation to meet Colonel Gaddafi. Mr
Stewart had private talks with the Libyan leader in his winter tent
which lasted about an hour.
Mr Stewart said yesterday: ''Colonel Gaddafi had clearly briefed
himself on the proposals in the new clause . . . he said the Libyan
government supported them as a possible way through.''
They also discussed how such support should be expressed to the
British Government, which has no diplomatic relations with Libya.
Mr Stewart, who agreed to relay the message, was told later that ''the
greenest of green lights'' had been given by the Libyan government for
his proposal.
Col Gaddafi emphasised that a ''necessary guarantee'' could be
discussed via the UN Security Council. This was a reference to the need
for assurances that a Scottish court in a neutral country was an
acceptable alternative to surrender for trial in the UK or the USA, if
sanctions were to be lifted.
Scottish and American prosecutors have issued warrants for the arrest
of two Libyans, Mr Lamen Khalifa Fhimah and Mr Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi, in connection with the deaths of the 270 people killed when
a bomb destroyed PanAm Flight 103 on December 21, 1988.
Libya has refused to surrender the two, claiming that they would not
receive a fair trial in either Scotland or the United States --
resulting in damaging UN sanctions in an effort to force compliance.
Mr Stewart insisted that the Libyan government had not sought to score
propaganda points during his visit, which he described as worthwhile.
He acknowledged that defence lawyers remained concerned about a
Scottish jury trial, at home or abroad, although they had been told a
jury was ''an essential and integral part of the Scottish judicial
system''.
The MP also pointed out that comment is now much more balanced, in
contrast to just after Lockerbie -- while a significant number of people
have expressed reservations about the nature of the evidence.
Mr Stewart said that the new clause would meet Libya's worry about its
citizens not receiving a fair trial in Scotland, while in no way
undermining the integrity of the Scottish legal system.
He now hopes to persuade colleagues on the Commons committee
considering the Bill, which is currently going through Parliament, to
vote for the new clause.
The Scottish Secretary, Mr Ian Lang, has expressed reservations about
the move to change the law, although it will be fully debated --
probably later this week.
Mr Lang believes that the practical difficulties of setting up a court
abroad rule it out and he prefers a trial in Scotland.
Dr Jim Swire, a spokesman for British families of the Lockerbie
victims, said that Mr Stewart's initiative would at least help the cause
of those who wish to see truth and justice triumph in the case.
Meanwhile, Col Gaddafi has warned that his country is ready to fight
to enable Libyan pilgrims to fly directly to Mecca, Islam's holiest
shrine, in Saudi Arabia.
The flights, he told Reuter, must be seen as exempt from the UN
Security Council air embargo imposed in 1992.
The pilgrimage season begins early next month, and flights are
expected to take off from several Libyan airports later this week. Since
the air travel embargo, Libyan pilgrims have flown to Mecca from other
countries.
Col Gaddafi said that Libya had run out of patience on the direct
flights ban. Some Libyan pilgrims had died last year en route to Mecca
via a camel train through Egypt.
Several Arab League countries have recently intensified contacts with
the Security Council to get permission for direct Libyan pilrimage
flights.

SOCCER star Eric Cantona will today start a special coaching programme
for youngsters as part of his penalty for kicking a spectator.
The Manchester United striker suggested the scheme to conform with a
community service order made by a judge.
He will teach more than 700 youngsters at his club's training ground,
The Cliff, supervised by a probation officer.
Cantona was given the 120-hour order after successfully appealing
against a two-week prison sentence for the kung-fu kick he launched at
Crystal Palace fan Matthew Simmons.
The judge recommended that he be given work which made use of his
skills and helped young people.
The incident in February happened when Cantona was allegedly taunted
after being sent off during a match at Crystal Palace's south London
ground.
Greater Manchester probation service insists the coaching programme is
''no soft option''.
The children, aged between nine and 11, will have one two-hour session
in groups of 12 with the French internationalist.
A spokeswoman at Manchester United's ground yesterday confirmed that
the coaching was going ahead but had no further details.

THE only Scot to have won the national final of the LiveWire UK
business start-up awards, Paisley businessman Mr Gary McEwan, yesterday
lent his support to the organisers of this year's national final, to be
held in Scotland for the first time.
Mr McEwan, who won the national title in 1993 for his business scheme
Associated Freight Training, which trains drivers of heavy goods
vehicles and fork-lift trucks, was joined yesterday by Mr Garrath Le
Sueur, director of Strathclyde Business Development, Mr Colin Wilson,
director of LiveWire Scotland, and Mr Russel Griggs, director of
business development at Scottish Enterprise, who are all involved in the
organisation of the scheme.
Mr Wilson said the Scottish finals would be judged tomorrow in
Aberdeen and the national finals held in June in Glasgow.
''There will be 15 entrants in the Scottish finals -- one from each
region. But altogether there were 247 entries this year, which is a
record for Scotland. That means that 20% of the entries came from 9% of
the population. As far as we are concerned, business confidence among
the 16 to 25-year-olds is very healthy,'' he said.
Mr Wilson said two of tomorrow's Scottish finalists would go through
to the national finals because of the high Scottish entry.
The LiveWire concept was initiated by Shell UK in Strathclyde 13 years
ago but this is the first year the national final has been held outside
London, following a joint bid by Scottish Enterprise and Strathclyde
Business Development, the economic arm of the regional council.
The competition now carries almost #200,000 in prizes and free
business advice for 16 to 25-year-olds starting up in business, or
considering a self-employment option.
Mr Le Sueur said: ''It is a great privilege for Strathclyde Regional
Council to welcome this event to Glasgow. Shell's willingness to bring
the final to Glasgow reflects the role SBD has played in promoting the
LiveWire concept.
''Strathclyde competitors have performed creditably for more than a
decade, including producing one outright winner in 1993 in Mr McEwan.
He added: ''Although concern has rightly been expressed by Scottish
Enterprise about the low rate of new firm formation in Scotland, the
figures from LiveWire this year give cause for considerable optimism,
with 20% of contestants in 1995 coming from North of the border.''
Mr McEwan said his business would never have reached its present level
without his LiveWire win.

ARTHUR English, who has died aged 75, began his comedy career more
than 40 years ago at London's Windmill Theatre, which also played host
to stars like Peter Sellers, Michael Bentine, and Jimmy Edwards.
Wearing huge kipper ties and a pencil-line moustache, he created Tosh
the Spiv and became the Prince of Wide Boys, a character very much part
of British folklore in the years after the war.
His remarkably long-lived career earned him the accolade of the grand
old man of television.
After being demobbed from service in the Second World War, English was
a labourer and housepainter, but at night worked his act round
Aldershot.
His brother Walter put him on the road to success by writing to the
Windmill, suggesting he be given an audition.
After the Windmill, English's star quality was spotted by the BBC and
he became resident comedian on radio's top-rated Variety Bandbox.
His career began to slow up as variety became less popular, but he
successfully switched to television.
He featured in the children's series Follyfoot as the grumpy stable
hand and was Mr Harman, the Grace Brothers caretaker, in Are You Being
Served?
Off stage he was a quiet man, softly-spoken with a slight Hampshire
burr, and an active member of the Grand Order of Water Rats, the
showbusiness charity.
In 1976, his wife Ivy died and English was devastated. He began
drinking very heavily and admitted getting through two bottles of whisky
a day.
Three years later, while he was in a pantomine, John Inman -- a
colleague from Are You Being Served? -- introduced him to a dancer 36
years his junior.
They fell in love and married after a whirlwind romance, but Teresa
left him in 1987, taking their daughter Claire.
He lost all confidence, suffered stage fright and did not work for
more than a year. He publicly talked about his hopes for a
reconciliation, but it never came.
He was heartbroken when a court ruled he was not allowed to see his
daughter without a chaperone -- and successfully fought to have the
order reversed.
By 1989 his health began to fail and he had to have a chairlift to get
up the stairs in his home.
Always the professional, he carried on working, starring with Warren
Mitchell as Alf Garnett's drinking partner in the comedy In Sickness and
in Health.

DR James R Minto, who died on April 8 on the eve of his 69th birthday,
retired in 1990 as director of Quarrier's Homes, Bridge of Weir,
Renfrewshire. He was born in St Boswell's, where his father was the
minister, from which background he embraced the Christian faith, finding
expression in a life dedicated to the education and welfare of children
and the needy.
He was educated at Kirkcudbright Academy and the University of St
Andrews, which he entered after serving in the Far East with the Royal
Navy. His first teaching appointment was to Wade Academy, followed by a
period in a depressed area of Philadelphia.
In 1959, he was appointed headmaster of Dr Graham's Homes in
Kalimpong, West Bengal, serving as Principal from 1961 until 1970. In
recognition of his 14 years there he was awarded the OBE in 1971. The
founding of this school by Dr John Anderson Graham in 1900 is described
in Dr Minto's book Graham of Kalimpong, published in 1974, an adaptation
of his PhD thesis awarded by St Andrews.
Dr Graham's Homes, which occupy an outstanding geographical setting in
the foothills of the Himalayas, have strong links with Scotland, where
many former staff and pupils live.
As an example of Dr Minto's concern for groups with special needs, he
set up a fund for Tibetan refugee children to be educated at the homes.
He often told his pupils: ''Walk on this earth with dignity.'' They
responded by carrying the education and values they were given into all
walks of life in India and around the world.
On leaving the homes for Scotland, he was their organising secretary
for three years.
As director of Quarrier's Homes from 1974, Dr Minto was faced with the
need to formulate and implement new directions, as the increase in
fostering of children had reduced the need for placements there. He
opened a centre for Down's Syndrome and a refuge for battered Asian
women and, with Sense, helped found a home in Glasgow for deaf and blind
children.
Dr Minto was a worthy successor to William Quarrier and Dr Graham, the
two pioneers who had moulded his life. Under his direction, the two
institutions they had founded were in turn moulded by him, adapting
successfully to new conditions while maintaining their original aims to
help the under-privileged.
His retirement from Quarriers was hastened by failing health and a
further blow was the unexpected death of his wife Rosemary in 1992. He
found happiness again in his sadly brief marriage in December 1994 to
Alison, who survives him together with his children Derek, Lesley, and
Rosie.

Kiev, Monday
THE head of Ukraine's nuclear power authority told the West today his
country could not honour its pledge to close Chernobyl by the year 2000
without major financial help.
Mikhail Umanets told a news conference in Kiev that the West would
have to help provide about #3000m to close Chernobyl and build a
replacement for the station, site of the world's worst nuclear accident
on April 26, 1986.
''The political decision (to close the station) is just a skeleton,
though a good one,'' Umanets said after discussing the promise to close
the facility with President Leonid Kuchma.
''To put meat on it means resolving the technical issues, and the
blood which will put it on its feet is financing. And everyone will have
to sweat buckets to pull it off.''
Kuchma last week promised Ukraine would close Chernobyl within five
years, provided the West helped.
But he disclosed no figures on how much the operation would cost and a
visiting European Union delegation pressing for its closure gave no
guarantees on financing.
A fire and explosion at one of the station's reactors nine years ago
sent a cloud of radiation across most of Europe and contaminated large
swathes of Ukraine, Belarus and Russia.
Umanets said Ukraine was to draw up a timetable by May 15 on closing
the station, and said the West was to come up with a financing plan by
July.
''We believe that in July we will also see a financing programme. If
we do not, we will consider our talks with the West as not serious,''
Umanets said.
''I think the (European Union) delegation was aware when it left
Ukraine that without money we cannot do anything.''--Reuter.

From FERIT DEMIR, Tunceli, Turkey, Monday
TURKISH troops and planes besieged Kurdish rebels holed up in a
mountain stronghold in eastern Turkey today while Ankara's military
offensive in northern Iraq entered a fifth week.
''Clashes in the Alibogazi ravine area are getting heavier. Many PKK
(Kurdistan Workers Party) are dead,'' an official told Reuters in
Turkey's eastern province of Tunceli.
At least two fighter-bombers and Super Cobra helicopters firing
rockets struck at Alibogazi, a deep 20 mile gash in the Munzur mountains
which the Turkish army last managed to conquer more than 50 years ago,
army sources said.
The Anatolian news agency said 25 rebels of the separatist PKK had
been killed over the past 24 hours in the operation while 17 rebels were
killed east of Tunceli in the Yedisu area of Bingol province. No army
casualties were given.
Although international attention has focused on Turkey's military
offensive against PKK bases in northern Iraq, the most intensive
fighting in recent days has been inside Turkey.
About 25,000 Turkish troops have moved in on the ravine where about
500 PKK rebels are believed to be holed up under the leadership of PKK
regional commander Semdin Sakik -- known as ''Fingerless Zeki'' after
losing a thumb while firing a rocket.
One of the 17 killed in Bingol today was identified as ''Blond
Mazlum'', said to be Sakik's right-hand man.
Turkey's emergency rule governor in the southeast, Unal Erkan, arrived
in Tunceli this morning with a large team of Turkish journalists and
headed to the ravine area.
More than 15,000 people have died since the Marxist PKK took up arms
for a separate homeland in southeast Turkey in 1984.
Western countries have urged Turkey to end the incursion into northern
Iraq out of concern for civilians. Germany has frozen military aid and
officials say Turkey's hoped-for customs pact with the European Union is
in jeopardy.
A Turkish state security court in the southeast town of Diyarbakir
today deported 11 Germans accused of taking part in an illegal
pro-Kurdish demonstration yesterday.
Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has begun a week-long visit to the
United States. Government officials declined to comment on unsourced
reports in Turkish newspapers that she will tell President Bill Clinton
on Wednesday of her intention to withdraw Turkey's 30,000 or so troops
from Iraq next month.
Turkey's offensive covers 5400 square miles of mountains and valleys
in northern Iraq. While it is impossible to know the full extent of
military activity Reuters reporters there said most signs indicated the
operation was coming to a standstill.
Troops say many PKK rebels fled eastwards to Iran even before the
incursion began on March 20.
Turkey is seeking the cooperation of the two main Iraqi Kurdish
factions to secure the borders against PKK incursions after an eventual
Turkish pullout.

ROSELLER ENRIQUEZ Zamboanga, Philippines, Monday
MUSLIM extremists killed 14 Christian hostages in a violent orgy,
mutilating and beheading some of them, while fleeing pursuing troops in
the southern Philippines, a survivor said today.
But the rebels spared a woman captive, believed to be a government
engineer with whom army officers say one of the guerrillas has fallen in
love.
One other hostage escaped the mass execution carried out early on
Saturday by the fundamentalist Abu Sayyaf guerrillas, survivor Rustico
Secundo told reporters.
More than 2000 soldiers have been pursuing the guerrillas in the
mountainous Zamboanga peninsula since the band sacked the town of Ipil
on April 4 and killed 53 mostly unarmed civilians.
In Manila, President Fidel Ramos called a meeting of the National
Security Council for Friday to discuss the threat from the Abu Sayaff
and intelligence reports that they were getting Russian-made weapons
from Aghanistan.
Secundo, taken to a Zamboanga hospital with slash wounds after being
rescued by soldiers yesterday, said he overheard the guerrillas saying
the hostages ''had become extra baggage'' and had to be killed to hasten
their withdrawal.
''I kept praying Psalm 23, 'The Lord is my Shepherd. I shall not
want'. I kept repeating the prayer when they started hacking us.''
Secundo said of his mortally wounded companions: ''I heard them
calling their mother's names as they lay dying.''
Those killed had grown too weak to carry on after their captors forced
them to act as porters, sometimes carrying their firearms or duffel bags
filled with bundles of money the rebels looted from banks in Ipil, he
said.
The deaths brought to at least 20 the number of hostages killed since
the start of the manhunt for the raiders. A survivor has alleged that
one of them was a 14-year-old boy the guerrillas slaughtered before
eating his flesh for lunch.
Forty guerrillas have died in clashes with troops, the military said.
About 200 rebels took part in the Ipil attack, seen as an escalation
of fundamentalist violence in the southern islands, where various Muslim
groups are fighting for autonomy.
About half of the group escaped by sea while the rest retreated into
the mountains.
The army deployed extra troops in Pagadian and General Santos cities
as well as in Sarangani province and other southern areas to ward off
any further raids following sightings of boatloads of suspected Abu
Sayyaf men, Brigadier-General Renato Garcia said.
Police around Manila have been on the alert for a week in fear of
guerrilla strikes in the city of 8[1/2] million people.
''I saw how they beheaded (some of) my companions,'' Secundo told
reporters.
Hacked in the neck and backside, the 24-year-old farmer survived by
playing dead and floating in a mangrove swamp until soldiers came.
He said the lone woman with them, whom the rebels call ''Jojo,'' was
alive and had been taken away by the guerrillas.
The military said an engineer of the Bureau of Public Highways, named
Jocelyn Ortega, was the lone woman among the 37 hostages seized by the
Ipil raiders as human shields.
General Rene Cardones said one of the rebels had been personally
taking care of Ortega and this could only mean he had fallen for her and
''intends to marry her''.--Reuter.

From WAFA AMR Jerusalem, Monday
YASSER Arafat's Palestinian Authority and its Hamas rivals met
secretly to reach an accord to prevent anti-Israeli attacks that are
holding up peace moves, Hamas and PLO officials said today.
One PLO official said yesterday's meeting, the first between the two
sides since December, had been ''very positive''.
Arafat adviser Ahmed Tibi and Islamic leader Sheikh Abdallah Nimer
Darwish, Arab Israeli figures who were key mediators in a Hamas-PLO
confrontation last November, arrived in Gaza late today for talks with
the PLO leader.
The two were instrumental in helping hammer out an accord that defused
tension in the strip after Palestinian police fired on demonstrators at
a Gaza mosque, sparking bloody clashes.
Palestinian Authority member Zakariya Al-Agha, asked whether Hamas had
responded to calls to halt armed attacks, said:
''There was understanding and readiness from all sides to work for the
interests of the Palestinian people.''
Hamas leader Sayed Abu Musameh declined to say whether Hamas had
agreed to suspend attacks from Palestinian self-rule areas.
Arafat, who heads the Authority, vowed to get tough with Hamas and
Islamic Jihad -- both Muslim militant groups opposed to his peace deal
with Israel -- after their suicide bombings in self-ruled Gaza last week
killed eight Jews.
Arafat's security forces arrested hundreds and sentenced five members
of the groups in a Gaza military court.
Arafat called yesterday for a national dialogue but demanded the two
groups limit themselves to peaceful means in opposing the 1993 peace
deal which gave Palestinians self-rule in Gaza and in the West Bank town
of Jericho.
Israel and the PLO say they hope to reach a deal by July 1 on
extending self-rule to other parts of the West Bank. --Reuter.

Madrid, Monday
SPAIN today summoned the British ambassador in Madrid to express its
displeasure at Britain's position during the fish dispute between Canada
and the European Union, which ended with a weekend deal in Brussels.
''The ambassador is being called to the ministry and he will be
informed of Spain's displeasure at Britain's attitude from the beginning
of this dispute until the very end,'' foreign minister Javier Solana
told reporters.
The five-week dispute began on March 9 when Canada seized a Spanish
fishing boat in international waters and demanded a new agreement for
Greenland halibut aimed at conserving stocks.
Spain filed a complaint with the International Court of Justice in The
Hague, and despite the weekend agreement is not withdrawing it.
It is also maintaining a new visa requirement for Canadian citizens
visiting Spain.
Britain and Ireland sided with Canada in the dispute, which ended with
an agreement which Spanish fishermen's leaders say will cut Spain's
catch by 80% and double Canada's.
Thousands of jobs are expected to be lost in the Galician fishing
industry.
Galician president Manuel Fraga today wrote to the British and Irish
ambassadors complaining about their failure to support Spain, and
attacking Canada for its ''aggression'' against Spanish boats.
In Madrid, opposition politicians urged the government not to ratify
the weekend deal.
Accusing the ruling Socialists of weakness, the centre-right Popular
party said it was asking the government to ''withdraw its support for
the (European) Commission in an affair which has seriously affected
Spanish interests''.
Labour minister Jose Antonio Grinan said the deal was the best
available. He would consider aid for Spanish fishermen who lost their
jobs.
The settlement that ended the turbot war will mean the loss of up to
10,000 jobs in Galicia, fishing leaders claimed.
Leaders of the industry said that the Brussels agreement meant that
the turbot fleet of 36 trawlers in Galicia, home of Spain's Atlantic
fishing fleet, would have to be cut to about a dozen vessels.
Today Spain's ''Grand Old Man of the Right,'' Manuel Fraga Iribarne,
the president of the autonomous Galician government, sent a letter to Mr
David Brighty, the British ambassador in Madrid, expressing his
''surprise and disgust'' at the UK's support for Canada.

From ANDREW DRUMMOND, Singapore, Monday
SUSPECTED British serial killer John Martin Scripps, 35, is believed
to have used an electric stun gun to immobilise a South African brewery
engineer and his other victims before killing them and chopping up their
bodies, it was revealed today.
As Scripps, who stood impassively in a Singapore court as he was
remanded in custody, details of how he stalked his victims began to
emerge.
At the city's police headquarters boxes of exhibits -- items found on
Scripps when he was arrested last month -- had already been labelled in
preparation for the trial ahead.
The exhibits include 10 pairs of handcuffs, a pair of thumbscrew
handcuffs, and a stun gun.
Police believe that Scripps stunned his victims and then probably
suffocated them before cutting up their bodies. In all cases he had
stolen the victims' cash and had attempted to obtain money from their
credit cards and bank accounts.
Outside the court, there was a scuffle with photographers as Scripps'
uncle, Mr Colin White from the Isle of Wight, shielded the accused's
mother Jean, 57.
Scripps was led into court with a group of 18 other local prisoners.
His hair cropped short and wearing a white T-shirt, he approached the
front of the dock as the name, John Martin, under which he has been
charged, was read out.
He said nothing, and did not even glance at his mother, a slim woman
with greying hair sitting at the back of the court.
Police asked that he be remanded into their custody at the Criminal
Investigation Division headquarters instead of Changi Prison's
psychiatric wing where he had been undergoing medical tests. They have
many more questions for the man who faces the mandatory death sentence.
His lawyer, Mr Edmond Pereira, approached the court with a plea for
Mrs Scripps to be able to see her son, who is accused of murdering
Johannesburg businessman Gerard Lowe in Singapore, Canadians Mrs Sheila
Damude, 49, and her son Daren, 21, on the Thai holiday island of Phuket,
and is linked to the disappearance in Mexico of 28-year-old Timothy
McDowall, a financial consultant from south London.
South African chemical engineer Gerard Lowe, 31, checked into the
River View Hotel in Singapore with Scripps on March 8. They shared a
twin room but just why is still unknown.
Lowe's carved-up body was found a week later in separate black plastic
bags floating off Cliffords Pier in Singapore harbour two miles away.
Scripps left Singapore for Thailand on March 11. On March 15, he
checked into Nillies Marine Hotel in Phuket, Thailand, arriving on the
same flight from Bangkok as Mrs Damude and her son.
The couple's bodies were later found chopped up and scattered in
undergrowth at the resort of Patong Beach. As in the case of Lowe,
Scripps had also told hotel staff that his victims had checked out of
the hotel early. He asked to move into their room.
But unlike the case of Lowe, there was evidence of blood in the hotel
room, suggesting there may have been a struggle.
Police believe that Scripps probably knocked on the door and used the
stun gun on his first victim before the second victim returned.
Meanwhile, Mexican police say Scripps had also managed to milk the
bank account of Mr McDowall of #20,000 and transfer the funds to the
Wells Fargo Bank in San Diego, California, earlier this year. Mr
McDowall has disappeared without trace.
The investigation into Scripps has involved Scotland Yard and the
police forces of six other countries -- Thailand, Singapore, Mexico,
South Africa, the United States and Canada.
Canadian interests were represented at the Singapore court by Douglas
Herda, a RCMP liason officer at the Canadian embassy in Singapore.
''Because of the background of these murders and the status of Mrs
Damude, these killings have attracted a high profile in Canada. Scripps
had nothing in common with Mrs Damude. Their backgrounds were quite
opposite,'' he said.
''It appears that Scripps was selecting victims though, of course, we
do not know what story he was telling them. We are sure he did not
become friends of the Damudes.''
Mrs Damude, financial manager of the Pacific Christian School in
Victoria, Vancouver Island, was once the secretary to British Columbia
former finance minister Hugh Curtis.
British Consul Colin Lane, who escorted Mrs Scripps to court,
confirmed that he had spoken to her son. ''I cannot comment on what he
said. That is a consular matter. But he appeared calm and composed. His
mother is anxious to avoid publicity.''
The family were represented by Mr Michael Quigley, of the Manchester
firm of solictors Endlar Quigley. He said: ''The family still have a
very vague idea of what has happened. All they know about John is what
they have read in the newspapers.
''The mother's first thought was to come out and see her son. She does
not wish to make any statement to the press.''
The alarm was raised after Lowe's wife Vanessa, 33, contacted police
in Johannesburg, distraught at the fact that her husband had failed to
return on his booked flight to Jan Smuts International airport. She was
already concerned, not having had a phone call for several days.
She described Lowe as the perfect husband who had never ceased to
surprise her with presents of perfume and candlelight dinners since they
married two years ago.
''I cannot understand to this day how he ended up in the same room as
Scripps,'' Mrs Lowe told a South African magazine.
''Gerard was not stupid but he did have a soft heart. The only thing I
can think of is that Scripps pretended to be without money and asked
Gerard to help him out.''

A FARMER who ill-treated his pigs, allowing some to become cannibals,
faces a further wait to find out if a sheriff will allow him to stay in
business.
After hearing a review of conditions at Mr Tom Ness's piggery and also
details of the poor financial state of the business, Kirkcaldy Sheriff
William Christie further deferred sentence until October 9.
At a previous hearing, Sheriff Christie demanded: ''How can people
treat animals in this way? It really is unbelievable.''
He described conditions at Brewness Farm, Balbeggie Avenue, Thornton,
as ''absolutely horrendous'', adding: ''It is disgraceful, dreadful. I
do not know how human beings can be so callous''.
Yesterday, the sheriff vowed to keep 50-year-old Mr Ness ''on the
hook'' until he was satisfied that his business was viable and that the
animals would not suffer again.
The farmer, who has more than 2000 pigs and faces a possible ban on
keeping livestock, previously admitted causing unnecessary suffering to
pigs.
He had pled guilty to causing unnecessary distress to pigs and failing
to provide adequate comfort and shelter.
He further admitted that between the same dates, being the owner of
livestock, by wantonly and unreasonably omitting adequately to husband,
manage, and provide veterinary treatment for 35 pigs, he caused
unnecessary suffering to them.
That charge stated that one of the animals became wedged in a drainage
exit and was so severely injured that when released it immediately died,
and another died in its pen, was allowed to putrefy there, and was
cannibalised by its pen mates.
In October, Sheriff Patrick McGoldrick ordered Mr Ness to get his sty
in order by December.
On December 29, Sheriff Christie accepted reports that matters had
''vastly improved'' but on learning from defence advocate, Mr Douglas
Small, that the farm had a #200,000 overdraft, he said: ''This business
does not seem to be viable and I am concerned that standards might slip
again.''
Yesterday, Mr Small read letters from the farmer's vet and a
Department of Agriculture vet stating that conditions had improved but
much was still to be done, and from a bank manager who confirmed the
bank was continuing to support the farmer.

CHILDREN in Scotland are the wealthiest in the country, according to
the latest pocket money survey. Parents have been credited with helping
to finally dispel the ''stingy Scots'' myth.
The Gallup poll of 1023 parents showed that children aged five to 16
received an average weekly total of #4.84. The United Kingdom average
was #4.18.
A spokeswoman for Walls, the company that commissioned the survey,
said: ''The myth of the stingy Scot has been dispelled once and for all.
Scottish children are doing very well and are the envy of kids in the
rest of the country. The UK figures show pocket money on the way down,
whereas in Scotland it has bucked the trend and gone up.
''Traditionally, children in London and the south of England are more
affluent but this time Scottish kids are better off.''
Scotland was bottom of the league in 1990 but has since topped the
poll three times.
This year, actual pocket money was up 19% to #2.08. Cash handouts from
relatives and family friends rose by a massive 42% to #1.90, and
industrious Scottish youngsters earned the rest through odd jobs. The
Scottish figures are in sharp contrast to those for London and the south
of England, where children received the most pocket money but the least
in handouts.
In the UK, pocket money remained static and total income (including
handouts and earnings) fell by 3%. A lack of odd-job work has been used
to explain the drop.
Boys received marginally more than girls. They tended to get more from
earnings than girls, who benefited more from handouts.
The league table read: Scotland (#4.84); London and south (#4.52);
north and north-east England (#4.42); north-west England (#4.09); the
Midlands and East Anglia (#3.95); Wales and the West Country (#3.25).

FIFE sculptor Martin Rayner carves a post for a sixteenth-century
castle, helping to transform the ruins into a luxury home.
Dairsie Castle, near Cupar, is being reconstructed by a financial
businessman, Mr Chris Ruffle. Contemporary artists have been creating
the interior of the castle, while the building exterior is being
reconstructed to the original form of the tower house.
Mr Rayner has also created a likeness of John Spottiswood, the
Archbishop of St Andrews, who lived in the building in the sixteenth
century.
Mr Tim Heale, site agent at the castle, explained: ''The castle is
being done in a contemporary way. We're not trying to make a replica, it
is an interpretation of the original. But the building is the shape it
would have been.''
Work at the castle is expected to be finished this summer.

AN airline pilot yesterday appealed for a Good Samaritan who came to
his aid when he was attacked in Edinburgh's Royal Mile at the weekend to
come forward, so that he can thank her.
Police are also anxious to speak to the heroine who saved 41-year-old
Mr Simon Caven, an Australian, from more serious injury. They have
appealed for witnesses to come forward.
Mr Caven, who had been due to start work tomorrow with Scotland's
newest airline, Macair, was assaulted by two or three men as he walked
home shortly after 3am on Saturday. He was punched and kicked in the
face and head before they ran away when the woman, who was with three
friends, intervened. The woman may also be Australian.
The group took him to the city's Royal Infirmary, where he was treated
for several injuries.
Mr Caven, who lives in Leith, said yesterday: ''I can't thank this
girl enough for coming to my aid. She had obviously seen the brutal way
the thugs were getting stuck into me, and she bravely squared up to
them.''
Doctors have advised the pilot to postpone his starting date with the
airline. A spokeswoman for Macair said the company was shocked by the
incident.

MEN spent #1.2m a day last year on toiletries such as body spray,
aftershave, and hair gel.
The market has risen by 37% to #460m in five years as men become more
concerned about hygiene and personal appearance, according to research
by Mintel, the firm of analysts.
Men in Scotland buy the most aftershave and fragrances, followed by
those in Yorkshire and the Midlands. Aftershave is used least in the
North of England.
Purchasers are more prepared to experiment with products themselves
rather than relying on gifts from wives and lovers.
Conversely, women are spending less on make-up as they opt for a more
natural image. The market for female cosmetics was #489m, #3.2m less
than the year before.
Gillette reports that 68% of men now purchase their own grooming
products and a man has almost as many such products in his bathroom as a
woman.
Elida Gibbs, the fragrance makers, say men are spending about 30
minutes a day on weekdays and up to an hour at weekends on their
appearance.
Fragrances account for the bulk of men's toiletries purchases, at
#237m, followed by body sprays at #58m, deodorants #52m, shaving
preparations #42m, hair-care products #30m, and talcum powder #10m.
Mintel reports: ''Men's toiletries is one of the fastest growing
sectors of the total toiletries market as a result of the dramatic
change in men's attitudes to personal appearance and general grooming.
''Younger men started to spend more on their appearance and the
popularity of toiletries has spread to other age groups.
''It is now not considered effeminate for men to use a body spray,
hair-styling mousse, and shower gel.
''It is now more acceptable for men of all ages to be well groomed and
smelling nice.''

FAMILIES living in an Edinburgh tower block are to be questioned about
damage to a security camera system installed to protect their homes.
Edinburgh District Council yesterday said that a number of residents
at Fort House, Leith, were to be questioned over a spate of vandal
attacks on the system, which is part of a #1m crime-cutting network
installed in the area in February.
''We are building a dossier of video evidence of incidents going on at
Fort House, which would suggest a small minority of families who are
living in Fort House are vandalising their own security system,'' a
council spokeswoman said.
''We are compiling a dossier and liasing with police. We will be
pursuing legal action against those responsible,'' she added.
Installed for a three-month trial period, the council's housing
officials predicted that the system would produce substantial savings on
repairs, but the spokeswoman admitted that the system had been
vandalised in a series of incidents.
The most serious attack, 10 days ago, put one of the surveillance
cameras out of action for 24 hours.
In 1993, the council agreed to proceed with a #7.5m plan to instal
security measures at 28 tower blocks around the city, including cameras
and a 24-hour concierge service.
The city's remaining tower blocks are also under consideration for
such schemes next year.
The plan was implemented in a bid to release more council houses in
the city as well as cutting crime. More than 3000 people are currently
homeless in Edinburgh.
The spokeswoman said: ''Some of the multi-storey blocks have been
incredibly difficult to let. We feel this sort of commitment to security
and this sort of investment is really benefiting tenants.
''The system has proved to be particularly effective at other blocks,
where the costs of installation have been more than made up by the
savings in vandalism.''
Security cameras have proved effective in reducing vandalism and crime
throughout Scotland.
In one of the most serious cases, Daniel Downie, 22, was jailed for
six years in January after he was filmed by a Greenock tower block
surveillance camera as he slashed a man on the face.

A SPANISH seaman was flown to hospital in the Western Isles yesterday
after a dramatic eight-hour rescue operation.
During it, a helicopter winchman was tossed into heavy seas in the
North Atlantic while trying to lift the seaman on to the aircraft and
had to be rescued himself.
A Bristow's helicopter, chartered by the coastguard at #4000 per hour,
set off early yesterday from its Stornoway base to a point more than 200
miles west of Benbecula after an appeal for help from the Spanish
trawler Moraime, on which a crewman was suffering from a suspected
perforated ulcer.
The Sikorsky helicopter, which had four crewmen and a local doctor on
board, refuelled at Benbecula airfield before flying to the trawler.
Once there, two attempts to get a winchman on board the trawler
failed. Weather conditions, described as ''horrendous'' by Bristow's,
meant the trawler was pitching and rolling violently in the sea and poor
visibility caused by low cloud in the darkness made it difficult for the
pilot, Captain Mike Roughton, to hover above the vessel.
A Nimrod maritime reconnaissance aircraft from RAF Kinloss attended to
help with communications between the helicopter and the trawler but
language difficulties also hampered the rescue.
A radio-telephone link was set up to allow a languages teacher from
the Nicolson Institute in Stornoway to translate and relay the
helicopter captain's instructions to the trawler's crew.
Then the helicopter was forced to return to Benbecula for more fuel
because the trawler was sailing close to the helicopter's extreme range
limit and fuel was getting low.
On its return to the scene a slight improvement in conditions allowed
winchman Chris Murray, 40, from Aignish near Stornoway, to be lowered at
a third attempt.
The operation almost resulted in tragedy when the trawler was struck
by a 20ft wave as Mr Murray unhooked himself from the winch. He was
thrown over the stern and into the sea.
The helicopter was quickly manoeuvred to a point above where Mr Murray
was spotted and a line was dropped into the water, enabling him to
re-hook himself.
After signalling to the helicopter's winch operator, Mr Vic Carcass,
that he was uninjured and able to continue, Mr Murray was lowered back
on to the trawler then lifted on to the aircraft along with the sick
man.
The fisherman, Lorenzo Ramon Menduina, 45, from Pontevedra on Spain's
west coast, was tended by Dr Ian Lawson during his journey to the
Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway, where his condition was described
as stable and comfortable last night.
The total cost of getting the crewman to hospital is likely to be
about #200,000, from public funds. Foreign vessels are not charged in
such circumstances.
The estimated operating costs of a Sikorsky S61N rescue helicopter are
about #4000 per hour and a Nimrod #20,000. The helicopter which carried
out the rescue was airborne from 12.45am until 9.45am yesterday.
Bristow's chief pilot, Captain Alan Elphinstone, who was not involved
in the operation, said yesterday: ''Chris could have been injured when
he was knocked over. He was in the water for almost five minutes but he
was wearing all the necessary survival equipment and signalled to his
fellow crewman that he was okay and could continue.
''Captain Mike Roughton and co-pilot Graham Findlay did a good job in
the pitch dark and heavy rain. There was nothing for them to look at --
no points of reference.
''Their quick thinking and Chris's bravery meant he was able to just
get back on board the trawler and carry on with the job.''
Captain Elphinstone described the rescue as ''a very long and
dangerous mission''.
* Manuel Iribarne, president of the autonomous Galician government,
has sent a letter to Mr David Brighty, the British ambassador in Madrid,
expressing his ''surprise and disgust'' at the UK's support for Canada
in the North Atlantic fishing dispute.

A 13-year-old girl was fighting for her life last night unaware that
her parents and sister were among five people killed in a horrific car
crash.
Surgeons at Leeds General Infirmary worked to save Abigail Austin --
the sole survivor of a smash which killed half of her immediate family.
Her father, Stephen, 42, mother, Carol, 45, and her elder sister
Sarah, 22, all died after the family's Vauxhall Cavalier was involved in
a head-on collision on the A629 Skipton bypass in North Yorkshire.
The couple's two sons, Shane and Luke, were also at the hospital last
night praying for their sister after watching the smash as they
travelled behind their parents in another car.
Miss Deborah Illingworth, 26, who had been staying at the Austins'
home in Haslam Grove, Shipley, near Bradford, West Yorkshire, also died
along with Mr Richard Bernard Lee, 18, of Skipton, who was driving the
other car, a Vauxhall Nova.
Shane, who is in his 20s, and his teenage brother Luke had set off in
another car and were following their father for a day trip to the Lake
District. The Austins' fifth child Jessica, 15, was travelling in a
third car.
Witnesses described a scene of ''total carnage'' as firefighters
toiled to cut Abigail free from the mangled wreck as bodies of the dead
lay around her. Her mother was alive when she was cut free but died
later in hospital.
A police spokesman said that it was looking hopeful that Abigail would
pull through, although her injuries were described as serious.
Mrs Austin's cousin, Mr Fred Tillett, 39, said that the family were
devout Jehovah's Witnesses and Stephen had been an Elder at his local
church.
Mr Tillett said: ''The Jehovah's Witness community will be devastated.
''We still can't believe this has happened,'' added Mr Tillet, a
service engineer and a neighbour of the Austins.

SCOTLAND'S new appointment to the Equal Opportunities Commission, Dr
Joan Stringer, said yesterday she will seek to teach Scottish men and
women better attitudes to equality in the workplace.
Dr Stringer, assistant principal of The Robert Gordon University,
Aberdeen, said she was delighted when offered the three-year
appointment, which will be announced officially today by Employment
Secretary Michael Portillo.
On her aims, she said: ''We can teach children there's no pre-ordained
natural law that women are destined always to take low pay, part-time,
and lower-status work. It is worth aiming to impart values of justice
and equity.''
Dr Stringer, who is also dean of the faculty of health and food at the
university, arrived in 1980 as a lecturer in public administration and
law. She was made head of the department in 1988 and was appointed to
her present academic position in 1991.
She feels that, generally, the situation for women has improved. ''It
has got better over the past 20 years since we had equality legislation
such as the Sex Discrimination Act in 1975, but there's still a great
deal to be done.''
Dr Stringer pointed to the difficulties women face in returning to
work after having children: ''Women with children who wanted to work or
return to work have had to take part-time positions because there is not
the child care available, particularly in Scotland.''
While not certain that legislation would be appropriate in this area,
she is keen for employers to realise that there are economic benefits
for them in making full use of women's skills in the workplace.
Another issue that Dr Stringer will be paying close attention to is
the regional variations in women's pay in Scotland.
Meanwhile, Edinburgh University launched a University in Scotland
Initiative, to emphasise its role in Scotland while also demonstrating
its international perspective.
Among the aims of the initiative, which will last initially for two
years, are the promotion of the study of Scotland within the university
and of the university as a centre of excellence in this study.
Judge David Edward, of the Court of Justice of the European
Communities, speaking at a reception, said Edinburgh and Scotland had
contributed the democratic intellect to the world.
The Scotland Initiative would help students and teachers to appreciate
what it meant to be a university in Scotland and make the people of

SOCCER player Gerry Creaney was recovering after surgery to repair a
fractured cheekbone yesterday as police investigated claims that he had
been attacked by his club's own fans in an altercation over a taxi
outside a nightclub.
The former Celtic player, now with English first division club
Portsmouth, was celebrating his 25th birthday with former England
international Mark Chamberlain when the pair were set upon as they
waited for a cab.
Mr Creaney, who last week was called into the Scotland squad for their
European Championship match against San Marino, will be out of action
for the rest of the season.
Now police are investigating claims that Mr Creaney and Mr Chamberlain
were attacked by Portsmouth supporters in an argument about a taxi.
Mr Chamberlain, who was released with minor facial injuries after the
attack, in the early hours of Good Friday, said yesterday that he had
spoken to police at Southsea to lodge a complaint.
A spokesman for Southsea CID said officers had taken statements from
Mr Chamberlain and had also spoken to Mr Creaney at Portsmouth's Queen
Alexandra Hospital.
Mr Creaney now faces a club investigation about breaching a pre-match
curfew by entering licensed premises less than 48 hours before a game.
A spokeswoman for the hospital said Creaney was ''progressing well''.

AN EMOTIONALLY-charged speech touched the hearts of delegates at the
start of the congress yesterday.
Normally, the gathering begins with the president's address. However,
this year's president, Mr Willie Queen, Scottish secretary of the
Transport and General Workers, was told by doctors that he was too ill
to attend congress after a serious heart attack on Christmas Eve.
Instead Gorbals-born Mr Queen, a trade union activist and communist
all his working life, penned his speech in his sickbed and gave it to
union colleague Mr Dan Duffy to read out.
Mr Queen told delegates, through Mr Duffy: ''As anyone who's
experienced it will tell you, flirting with death concentrates the mind
like nothing else.''
However, if his health had faltered, his zeal had not. Dismissing the
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke as a ''bumptious buffoon in Hush Puppies,'' Mr
Queen said: ''He wonders why there is no feel-good factor.
''Let him go to Kilwinning and to Hawick where Dawson International,
the makers of Pringle, have decided to down-size these communities
''Two factories to be closed, five hundred jobs for the chop by a
company whose profits this year will top #20m.''
Listing other redundancies, Mr Queen continued: ''If Kenneth Clarke
doesn't understand why there is no feel-good factor, then maybe I can
help him.
''People -- whether they have a job or not -- can't feel good for
feeling insecure. They can't feel good for feeling threatened. They
can't feel good for feeling battered and betrayed.
''And in Scotland we're suffering from a chronic case of the feel-bad
factor.''
However, Mr Queen was also in a reflective mood, warning unions that
just because they had become leaner and fitter, it did not automatically
guarantee their survival.
''Too many workers are without a union today for us to be fooled by
the notion that our existence is inevitable. We will only survive if we
do our job, if we deliver, if our members and our future members believe
we are relevant to them,'' he said.
The delegates, who listened attentitively to Mr Queen's words,
immediately agreed to send him their best wishes for his recovery.

<TEXT>
BEHIND-the-scenes talks to try to halt Scotland's three largest unions
from falling out in public appear to have failed.
The country's largest union, Unison, is to challenge a motion at
Congress today put forward by the general workers union, the GMB. The
second largest union, the Transport and General, is expected to line up
with the GMB and against Unison.
The fall-out is threatening the show of union solidarity, which
leaders had hoped to portray at the 98th congress.
At the heart of the argument is the future of tens of thousands of
local authority workers employed in what are known as Direct Service and
Direct Labour Organisations.
One of the largest, Catering Direct, employs about 8500 workers in
Strathclyde.
The GMB workers at Catering Direct have voted overwhelmingly that it
should not be broken up with local government reorganisation.
They argue that millions of pounds of savings are made through its
huge buying power, and this would be lost if it was dismembered, and
would increase the chances of private companies winning council
contracts in the future.
To remain as one company however, it would mean joint boards being set
up by the new councils to oversee it.
The GMB is in favour of such boards in order to preserve jobs.
However, Unison sees joint boards as a threat to local democracy, and
only wants them set up as a last resort.
It argues that joint boards would allow such services to be privatised
in the future, or for a Tory Secretary of State to remove
democratically-elected councillors from the boards.
Instead of a compromise being reached in private, it seems the issue
will now be argued out in public.
The issue of joint boards may seem an odd one for a major fall-out of
the unions, where rows in the past have been over the more emotive
issues of nuclear power, trade union laws, and calls for general
strikes.
It is a reflection of the decrease in manufacturing jobs and the rise
of the service industries. Local government is easily Scotland's largest
employer, and so is increasingly an area where unions can appear at
loggerheads.

KEN SMITH reports on the opening day's debates at the Scottish Trades
Union Congress in Perth
TRADE union exasperation with the new-look Labour Party spilled over
on the first day of the annual STUC congress at Perth yesterday.
First, Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown and then Labour leader Tony
Blair came in for withering criticism from delegates.
The mood of a growing number of trade unionists is that if Labour
wants to keep the unions at arm's length, then the unions in turn should
be free to criticise Labour.
Mr Brown, as a leading Scot in the Shadow Cabinet, normally would be
the darling of the trade union movement.
However, yesterday he was told by Anne Middleton, a Scottish organiser
with Unison, and the highest-ranking woman trade union official in
Scotland, to put a figure on what national minimum wage Labour would
support.
She said he was wrong to campaign to win support for the principle
before saying what level he would set for a minimum wage.
Ms Middleton said that an opinion poll by her union had shown that 85%
of Scots backed a minimum wage of half the median of male earnings --
calculated at present at #4.15 an hour.
The unions had to destroy the Tory propaganda that a minimum wage
would destroy jobs, she added.
Criticism of Labour for not setting a minimum wage means that Labour
is now being attacked on two fronts by certain sections of the union
movement, as it is also facing union opposition over the rewriting of
Clause 4.
Labour leader Tony Blair was attacked by college lecturer Penny
Packham, of the Educational Institute of Scotland.
Mocking his decision to send his children to an opted-out school, she
said: ''We learn that Blair drives his kids eight miles across London to
Brompton Oratory. Were there no decent schools a little bit nearer his
house?''
She continued: ''The Labour Party supports the principle of a minimum
wage but it refuses to set a level for the minimum wage. They refuse to
say they will renationalise industries that have already been sold off.
''But how else are we going to get full employment if not by
nationalising or renationalising factories or other workplaces --
without compensation if necessary.''
She said the trade union movement had to fight to defend jobs no
matter which Government was in power.
Although Ms Packham was speaking as an individual delegate and not as
an official spokesperson for the EIS, her views are supported by many
rank-and-file members.
With a minimum wage and renationalisation of public utilities up for
further discussion this week at Perth, then further criticism of Labour
can be expected.
Labour officials argue that it cannot set a minimum wage until it gets
into office as it has to see what the state of the economy is at that
time.
Privately they fear that setting a rate would give the Tories a public
relations coup as they could bring forward employers to claim that they
would have to sack workers if the rate was introduced.
Increasingly, many unions are expecting Labour to be bolder, and take
the risk.

<TEXT>
THE Aviemore hotel fire on New Year's Day, in which two people died,
could have been a far greater tragedy because of a lack of fire-fighting
equipment, the Fire Brigades Union claimed at the congress yesterday.
The union has identified 20 towns in Scotland which it says should
have their own high-reach rescue appliances, such as turntable ladders,
just to meet Scottish Office guidelines.
They include Aviemore, where the nearest high-reach vehicle was said
to be an hour's drive away at Inverness.
The fatal fire was on lower floors, but the FBU says that if people
had been trapped on the fourth floor or above, then nothing could have
been done for them until the appliance arrived from Inverness.
''You can't have people clinging to a window ledge for an hour,'' FBU
executive member Dave Patton said.
''Yet when we raised our concerns with the Scottish Office Minister,
Lord Fraser, he said there was no money for extra equipment.''
The fire-fighters' union says that #10m is needed in the first year to
have Scotland's eight brigades adequately supplied with such vehicles.
It is launching a postcard campaign -- initially with 10,000
pre-printed postcards which it is wanting the public to send to Scottish
Secretary Ian Lang, calling for more resources.
The union points out that official figures show that there are more
fires in Scotland in percentage terms, than England and Wales, and that
a higher percentage of fires in Scotland end in fatalities.
The death rate in Scotland is 20 per million population, compared with
13 in England and Wales.

ONE of the country's largest unions has become an agony aunt to
thousands of members.
An advice helpline set up by the Transport and General Workers' Union
was expected to be used to solve workplace problems. However, about 5000
calls were logged on matrimonial problems.
Motoring, property and personal injury inquiries also ranked highly.
Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the union, said: ''Yes, we were
very surprised. We thought most of the inquiries would be
employment-related, but they weren't at all.''
The 24-hour phone-in helpline, called CareXpress is operated for the
T&amp;G by an outside agency which promises to phone people back within 20
minutes if they cannot answer an inquiry immediately. Union members can
use the service free.
Mr Morris said the union was delighted with the service. About 60,000
calls were logged in the first year, with about 4000 from Scotland.

MRS Irene Adams, 46, is the widow of Allen Adams the MP for Paisley
1979-83 and Paisley North 1983-90. She was the youngest woman to become
a councillor in Britain when she was elected to Paisley Town Council in
1970. She is a past member of both Renfrew District Council and
Strathclyde Regional Council and has been a member of the Labour Party
for more than 25 years.
She has conducted an almost single-handed campaign against the drug
barons in her constituency. This campaign has taken a new urgency after
the recent spate of shootings and death threats.
She is firmly linked to one faction within Renfrew Labour Party but
has wide political support within her constituency.
THE son of a factory assembler Mr Tommy Graham, 51, is a heavy-weight
and outspoken politician on Labour's back benches.
He defends a slim majority as MP for Renfrew West and Inverclyde and
has previously been a community councillor and district councillor on
Renfrew District Council, before reorganisation, then a regional
councillor for Strathclyde.
His political agent is Mr Harry Revie, who is a director of FCB. Mr
Graham and Mr Revie enjoy a close friendship and both are seen to be in
an opposite faction of the Labour Party to Mrs Adams.
Mr Graham is married with two sons. He is a former engineer with
Rolls-Royce and also worked as a manager in a solicitor's office before
going on to the House of Commons.
THE jovial Mr Gordon McMaster, 35, is a qualified lecturer in
horticulture and has been MP for Paisley South since 1990.
He has held numerous positions in his constituency Labour Party and is
a former Johnstone Community Councillor and Renfrew District Councillor.
He has been an Opposition whip since 1992 and is regarded as a potential
high-flyer within the Labour Party.
He is a friend of Mrs Adams and it is understood that his advice was
sought before the fellow MP drew up her questions which will today begin
to open up a parliamentary inquiry into FCB.
He has refused to become involved directly in the inquiry, telling The
Herald that he has no locus in the matter as it is outwith his
constituency.

POLICE in Paisley are scrutinising closely the activities of FCB
Enterprise Security Ltd, set up with #195,000 of public money and formed
as part of the #47m revitalisation of the town's Ferguslie Park.
The money came from the Scottish Office, Strathclyde region, and
Renfrew district. The charitable company guards building sites and other
properties across the Ferguslie Park area.
The Herald understands that the company has been referred to the
Charities Office and has been the subject of several complaints from
opposition members on Renfrew District Council.
Paisley North MP Mrs Irene Adams is concerned about the way the
company has operated and is anxious to know why FCB was the only company
approached to tender when it was awarded a #300,000 Renfrew district
contract in 1993 to protect empty houses and district offices in the
council's area.
Mrs Adams also claims she has received information that FCB has been
used as a front for illegal activities in Paisley.
She has named a particular individual who is employed in a senior
position in the company. The employment of this person was confirmed to
The Herald by a director of the company.
The FCB group is the biggest employer in the area and is part of
Ferguslie Park Community Holdings, Scotland's oldest community business.
The company was set up three and a half years ago to provide community
employment. The security firm has been the most successful arm with
around 80 employees.
Two local Labour councillors, Mrs Olga Clayton (Renfrew District
Council) and Mr Harry Revie (Strathclyde Regional Council), are members
of its board of directors.
Mr John McIntyre, co-ordinator of the Ferguslie Park Partnership, is
also a director of the group's holding company and secretary of
Craigielea Ward Labour Party.
No-one was available for comment at the headquarters of FCB Enterprise
Security Ltd in Ferguslie Park. An employee who answered the locked door
described the allegations as ''a load of rubbish'' and said the offices
were closed for the day because of the holidays.
''Everybody is away until tomorrow,'' he added.

<HEADLINE>Voters seem undeterred by local difficulties</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Labour in Scotland has had its share of local difficulties, but they
have little effect when it comes to the ballot box. Scottish Political
Correspondent Robbie Dinwoodie points out why
DIRE electoral consequences for the Labour Party have often been
predicted in the wake of internal troubles and scandals, actual or
perceived.
The truth is that these have rarely come to pass as voters remain
loyal in their allegiance in the face of criticism in the media.
Historically, in Dundee and Midlothian, and more recently in
Monklands, Falkirk, Kirkcaldy, and South Ayrshire, the Labour Party has
been confronted by the potential consequences of its local hegemony with
allegations of corruption, gerrymandering, or bigotry.
This month's elections for the new unitary local authorities offered
no evidence that the electorate had turned against Labour as a result.
West Renfrew results were not good for Labour, but it was already a
party riven by splits in its local organisation.
The Paisley scandal, in which a sitting MP has now alleged a direct
link between a local quango with Labour involvement and organised crime
in her area, carried the potential for spectacular damage, but the
actual impact remains to be seen.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson was leaving most of the
awkward questions about Renfrewshire to his senior party officials
yesterday, but he told The Herald: ''We are determined to make sure that
our fortunes nationally are not determined by the activities of a few
activists at local level.
''In the elections two weeks ago, people made a conscious decision
that they wanted Labour to control Scottish local government. It is our
obligation to live up to that.''
Superficially, it might be assumed that headlines screaming local
government scandals would have a direct electoral consequence, but the
evidence for such a downside is scant. Midlothian District Council was
once mired in allegations of anti-Catholic bigotry. That storm
weathered, its unitary authority quietly consolidated a different bias
by putting up a successful, 13-strong, all-male slate this month.
Dundee's ruling administration saw Labour politicians end up in
prison, but the electoral backlash was hard to pin down. Kirkcaldy had
its fall-outs last year, and South Ayrshire and Falkirk faced their own
allegations of impropriety this year. Labour voters signally failed to
turn away.
The Paisley allegations are far more dramatic, amounting to nothing
less than a direct link between the local party machine and organised
crime. But two factors count against this harming Labour in the long
run.
One is that Paisley North MP Irene Adams has been brave enough to
raise the issue. The other is that Labour HQ had already begun to act
against a local party that was patently out of control.
Scottish Labour Party general secretary Jack McConnell said: ''The
fact that we coped with Monklands, dealt with a difficult local party,
got through a horrendous by-election, and that a new council will soon
see these practices not repeated -- that will show across the country
that we are prepared to deal with that. We want new councils to operate
on a much more consistent and open basis than the old ones.''
Mr McConnell is a phenomenally tigerish in-fighter when it comes to
party discipline. As a result, Labour can claim two things
simultaneously: that traditional voters have not been deterred in areas
where there have been problems and allegations; and that the new
organisational broom will be so severe that any future problems will be
swept away.
One opponent with experience of fighting a local Labour administration
harbouring skeletons in its cupboards is former Dundee MP and SNP
vice-president Gordon Wilson. He does not believe allegations of
malpractice, in themselves, have much effect.
''The general public are fairly insulated and have low expections,
quite apart from an attitude that says if a councillor can look after
himself, he can look after everyone else,'' he said. He added that, in
the past, when the SNP had gained from corruption in a rival party, this
had served to cut out the dead wood in the rival and bring it back more
strongly next time.
Nevertheless, he claimed Paisley represented the worst case of
one-party rule.

IT was life as normal for people in Paisley's Ferguslie Park
yesterday, despite the storm of allegation and counter allegation
breaking over their heads.
''Heard it all before'' was the stock reaction from residents going
about their business in a scheme which, not for the first time, finds
itself under the public spotlight.
Ms Helen Mitchell, of Westwood Gardens, said she had spent her life in
Ferguslie Park and was happy to bring up her children Jaqueline four and
Louise three, there.
''I have been here 33 years and I've never seen any violence or felt
in any danger. It doesn't matter where you live, everywhere has its
problems and Ferguslie is no different.''
Smart new double-glazed windows in refurbished tenements illustrate
the major changes ''feegie park'' has undergone in recent years. Yet it
has not quite shaken off its downtrodden look.
Grim boarded-up rows of shops, broken glass, and aimless groups of
youths give the area an uncomfortable feel to outsiders.
Most people spoken to by The Herald were unaware of the allegations
being made against a company which operates in their midst, and scornful
of claims that the scheme was rougher than any other.
Many, saying they were tired of being singled out, emphasised the
neighbourhood spirit and sense of community in the area.
Mrs Helen Campbell, of Killoch Avenue, laughed at suggestions that
there was a climate of fear in Ferguslie Park. ''It's a load of rubbish.
People keep themselves to themselves, but it's not that we're frightened
to leave our houses or anything like that.
''I have gone out and left the kitchen window unlocked knowing that my
neighbours will look out for me. Neighbours here help each other out.''
One woman, who asked not to be named, said ordinary people were not
touched by drugs troubles. ''I'm sure, for some people, there is a
climate of fear. But that is nothing to do with most decent folk.''
That theme was echoed by 52-year-old William Quigg, of Blackstoun
Road: ''Some of the young folks seem to like to fight with each other
and I believe they sometimes use weapons, you get that in all the
schemes.
''I don't see why Ferguslie Park should be picked out, it's no
different from anywhere else, and for the average person there are no
problems.
''I've lived here since I was two and I like it. I am able to go in
and out of the house when I like, and I don't get any trouble.''
His friend, 54-year-old Malcolm Fulton, agreed that if there were
problems in the area they passed most people by. ''I have seen me coming
home at three or four in the morning without the slightest worry of any
danger.''

SCOTLAND'S new appointment to the Equal Opportunity Commission, Dr
Joan Stringer, said yesterday she would seek to teach Scottish men and
women better attitudes to equality in the workplace.
Dr Stringer, assistant principal at The Robert Gordon University,
Aberdeen, said she was delighted when offered the three-year
appointment, which will be announced today by the Employment Secretary,
Mr Michael Portillo
On her aims, she said: ''We can teach children that there's no
pre-ordained, natural law that women are destined always to take low
pay, part-time, and lower status work. It is worth aiming to impart
values of justice and equity.''
Also Dean of Faculty of Health and Food at The Robert Gordon
University, Dr Stringer arrived in 1980 as a lecturer in public
administration and law. She was made head of the department in 1988 and
assistant principal in 1991.
She feels that generally, the situation for women has improved. ''It
has got better over the past 20 years, since we had equality legislation
such as the Sex Descrimination Act in 1975, but there's still a great
deal to be done,'' she said.
She pointed to the difficulties women face in returning to work after
having children: ''They have had to take part-time positions because
there is not the child care available, particularly in Scotland.''
While not certain that legislation would be appropriate in this area,
she is keen for employers to realise there are economic benefits for
them in making full use of women's skills in the workplace.
Another issue to which Dr Stringer will be paying close attention is
the regional variations in women's pay.
* Edinburgh University has launched a University in Scotland
Initiative, to emphasise its role at home while also demonstrating its
international perspective.
Among the aims of the initiative, which will last initially for two
years, are the promotion of the study of Scotland within the university
and of the university as a centre of excellence in this study.
Judge David Edward, of the Court of Justice of the European
Communities, speaking at a reception, said that Edinburgh and Scotland
had contributed the democratic intellect to the world.
The Scotland Initiative would help students and teachers to appreciate
what it meant to be a university in Scotland and make the people of
Scotland more aware of what a treasure they had in Edinburgh as an
international university, he said.
Professor Sir Stewart Sutherland, the principal, said Edinburgh was a
Scottish university with an international dimension.

POLICE were hunting last night for a group of youths who left two men
seriously injured in separate attacks in the centre of Glasgow.
Detectives yesterday appealed for witnesses after the attacks, which
occurred within minutes of each other and just a few hundred yards
apart, on Sunday night.
In the first attack, a family night out to celebrate a christening
ended in tragedy for Mr William Johnston, 44, of Castlebay Drive, in the
city's Milton area.
He was leaving Drummond's Bar, in West Regent Street, with his wife
and other members of his family at about 10.45pm, when a group of
between four and eight youths attacked his brother-in-law, who asked
police not to reveal his name.
Detective Inspector Donald McQuade, who is leading the police
inquiries, said: ''The group ran off shouting when the rest of his
family went to his assistance, and it was only then that they noticed Mr
Johnston slumped on the stairs in front of Drummond's with a serious
facial injury.''
Mr Johnston was stabbed in the eye and was taken to Glasgow Royal
Infirmary, where his condition was described as serious but stable.
Police are basing most of their inquiries on the bar and are anxious
to contact anyone who was in the downstairs Potters pool lounge on
Sunday night, where the family had been.
Mr McQuade said: ''We have no evidence of any dispute in the pool
lounge but we have reason to believe that the people who carried out the
attack were also in it on Sunday night.''
Police were questioning staff at the bar yesterday and seeking the
names of regular customers and other people who may have been in the
pool lounge, which has six tables.
Mr McQuade added that police had had a good response from staff and
customers.
Mr Steven McDonald, assistant manager of Drummond's, estimated that
about 200 people had been in the main bar area and 50 in the pool lounge
late on Sunday night.
He said: ''We are not aware of any arguments or incidents inside the
bar or pool lounge,'' adding that management and staff were ''very
upset'' by what had happened.
Another man was assaulted minutes after the attack on Mr Johnston,
this time in Renfield Street near Bath Street.
Mr Hugh Calderhead, 27, of Buchlyvie Path, in the city's Easterhouse
area, was apparently walking in the street when he was punched by a man
and struck his head as he fell to the ground.
He was taken to the Southern General Hospital, suffering from a
fractured skull. His condition was described as serious.
Police believe the assailant was one of the youths involved in the
first attack.
Mr McQuade said: ''We have been unable to speak to either of the
injured men so far but, from descriptions we have received from other
people, it would appear that one man was involved in both incidents.''
The man is described as being white, in his early twenties, about 5ft
8in tall, of medium build, with short, blond hair and bad facial acne.
Mr McQuade added: ''The first attack in particular was extremely
vicious and the second seemed to be an assault gone wrong. As far as we
know, both were completely unprovoked.''

<HEADLINE>Sellafield invaded by protesters Police hold 61 as Greenpeace claims success</HEADLINE>

MORE than 60 anti-nuclear protesters were arrested yesterday after
breaking into the Sellafield reprocessing plant and blocking a main
access road to the site, but Greenpeace claimed last night that five
activists were still hidden inside the plant.
Around 100 campaigners breached security at the site on the Cumbrian
coast, but British Nuclear Fuels Limited, which runs the plant, denied
claims by Greenpeace that plutonium production had been halted.
Further claims by Greenpeace that activists had shut off a discharge
pipe at the Aldermaston nuclear weapons facility in Berkshire were
neither confirmed nor denied last night.
Police arrested 61 demonstrators during the six-hour Sellafield
protest, timed to coincide with the start of talks in New York yesterday
to review the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
Those arrested were taken to Whitehaven police station in West
Cumbria, where eight were charged with offences including criminal
damage and obstruction and released on bail. The remaining 53 were
''being processed'', said police.
Greenpeace, which blocked a road into Sellafield with a 20ft
container, claims the plant is one of the world's leading producers of
plutonium -- a key component of nuclear bombs.
It also claimed to have anchored one of its ships, the Moby Dick,
close to a discharge pipe at the plant which, according to Greenpeace,
pumps high levels of radioactive waste into the Irish Sea.
Police confirmed that three protesters had tried to parachute into
Aldermaston -- but only one managed to get near the base.
A Ministry of Defence spokesman said it was impossible to concrete the
base's main discharge pipe without entering the base and there had been
no reported trespassers.
However, Greenpeace spokeswoman Janet Convery said activists had shut
off valves on a 10-mile water pipe from Aldermaston by striking at a
point near the Kennet and Avon Canal which is outside the base. An MoD
spokesman confirmed that a valve had been ''tampered with''.
Mr Bill Anderton, for BNFL, stressed that the Sellafield protest had
not affected plutonium production at the site's Thermal Oxide
Reprocessing facility (THORP).
Mr Anderton was unable to explain how the protesters entered the site
but said: ''Sellafield is about a mile by a mile-and-a-half and has a
wire fence around it. It's not possible to patrol every inch of it.'' In
a statement, BNFL criticised Greenpeace for linking the THORP plant with
the non-proliferation talks.
''THORP is a civil reprocessing plant and the uranium and plutonium
recovered from its operations are a valuable energy source.''
The THORP plant extracts uranium and plutonium from nuclear waste from
British and foreign reactors.
Its construction was fiercely opposed by anti-nuclear groups, who
claimed it would turn Sellafield in the ''world's nuclear dump''.

GEOFF Knights, boyfriend of EastEnders star Gillian Taylforth, was
charged last night with causing grievous bodily harm after a minicab
driver was attacked outside the couple's home, police said.
Mr Knights, 40, a self-employed consultant, was arrested late on
Sunday after Mr Martin Davis, 33, was taken to hospital with severe
facial injuries.
He will appear before magistrates in Hendon, north London, today,
Scotland Yard said.
Mr Knights was charged after being questioned at Barnet police
station.
Mr Davis was said to be ''recovering nicely'' at Barnet General
Hospital, where doctors waited for his facial swelling to go down before
carrying out precautionary x-rays.
Miss Taylforth, 39, spent yesterday filming for EastEnders, the BBC
soap opera in which she plays cafe owner Kathy Beale.
She later returned to her home in Whetstone, north London, where she
was interviewed by police.
She left the house carrying an overnight bag and declined to speak to
reporters.

THE United Nations secretary-general, Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali,
yesterday held out a vision of a world without nuclear weapons but also
launched an attack on countries that signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty
in a bid to obtain nuclear arms.
He was speaking at the opening of a conference on renewing the 1970
nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty at the UN in New York.
The meeting is to decide whether the agreement, designed to prevent
the spread of nuclear arms, is to be extended indefinitely and
unconditionally, as sought by at least four of the five acknowledged
nuclear powers -- Britain, the United States, Russia, China, and France
-- or renewed for a fixed period.
Mr Boutros-Ghali said that some countries which had signed the treaty
were ''seeking to obtain materials and technology for the manufacture of
weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear arms''.
Without naming any culprits, he said: ''This is a frightening prospect
under any circumstances, but even more so in a world beset by ethnic
tension. It would be tragic if the end of nuclear deterrence were to be
followed by a proliferation of the nuclear threat.''
Mr Boutros-Ghali, who has said that he favours indefinite extension of
the NPT, declared: ''The most safe, sure and swift way to deal with the
threat of nuclear arms is to do away with them in every regard.
''This should be our vision of the future. No more testing. No more
production. No more sales or transfers. Reduction and destruction of all
nuclear weapons and the means to make them should be humanity's great
common cause.''
Many third world countries among the NPT's 178 signatories see the
conference as a last chance to force the nuclear powers to live up to
their pledge under the agreement to negotiate in good faith for nuclear,
and eventually conventional, disarmament.
By pressing for NPT renewal for periods ranging from five to 25 years,
they hope to retain their bargaining power with the nuclear states.
As evidence of moves towards disarmament, the United States cites a
moratorium on underground nuclear testing and Strategic Arms Limitation
Treaties with Russia. It also refers to progress towards a comprehensive
nuclear test ban treaty that goes beyond a 1963 accord by including a
ban on underground testing.
The leading powers are fairly confident that they can secure a
majority of 90 votes needed to renew the NPT indefinitely.
But they realise that anything less than a resounding majority would
represent an unsatisfactory outcome likely to weaken the treaty.
A sign of contentiousness was evident throughout the past weekend as
negotiators attempted privately to work out voting procedures, which
still remain to be settled.
All proposals -- and there are expected to be many -- to extend the
treaty must be formally presented by May 5.
Israel said it would not commit itself to a nuclear-free zone, or sign
the treaty, so long as it is not at peace with its neighbouring Arab
states.
Mr Gad Yaacobi, Israel's UN ambassador, said Israel would only observe
the proceedings despite Egypt's insistence that it sign the treaty.
There have been reports that Israel has nuclear weapons, but Israel
has declined to comment.

LEGAL advisers to Scotland international footballer Duncan Ferguson
will lodge an action at the High Court today in an attempt to obtain
footage from Scottish Television of two trouble-torn games.
The former Rangers' striker, now with English Cup finalists Everton,
is set to go on trial in Glasgow next month in a much-postponed assault
case.
Ferguson has been charged with assaulting one time Raith Rovers'
defender John McStay in a premier-division match at Ibrox last season.
It is understood that his lawyers formally requested that Scottish
Television should make available to them other incidents of violence
which have occurred in Scottish football and which had no criminal
action in their wake.
The television company refused and now moves are being made to force
it to hand over film of last season's Scottish Junior Cup Final between
Glenafton and Largs Thistle, when four players (two from each side) were
sent off.
The request to the court is also believed to cover footage of the
punch-up between Hearts' team-mates Craig Levein and Graeme Hogg in a
pre-season friendly. Hogg ended up with a broken nose after that fracas.
Ferguson has been involved in two #4m transfers in his career -- from
Dundee United to Rangers then on to the Goodison Park club. He was set
to be named today in the Scotland squad for the European Championship
tie in San Marino next week until he was injured playing for Everton
yesterday.
He faces a Wembley showdown on May 20 against Manchester United in the
FA Cup Final.

A FORMER Labour councillor has warned an MP that she is putting
herself at risk by attempting to expose a possible drugs and
money-laundering scheme.
The bloodletting within the Scottish Labour Party also intensified
yesterday with another councillor accusing the Paisley North MP, Mrs
Irene Adams, of conducting a ''smear'' campaign using allegations of
manipulation of branch memberships and involvement in criminal
activities.
Mrs Adams retorted by calling on the councillor and his colleagues to
speak publicly if they knew anything.
The Scottish National Party has demanded a re-run of the recent
council elections if it is discovered the Labour Party was already aware
of the seriousness of the problems.
The Herald yesterday disclosed details of a political scandal in
Renfrewshire where Mrs Adams says she will use parliamentary privilege
to open inquiries into the activities of a community business, funded by
Renfrew District Council, Strathclyde Regional Council, and the Scottish
Office and run by Labour Party members.
Strathclyde Police has confirmed it is undertaking an investigation
into FCB Enterprise Security Ltd at Paisley's Ferguslie Park, which Mrs
Adams claims is being used as a front for illegal activities.
Two Labour councillors are members of the company's board and the
secretary of a local branch is also a director of the group's holding
company. One of the councillors said Mrs Adams ''has taken leave of her
senses''.
Mr Ken McGinlay, a Renfrew district councillor who was recently
expelled by the Labour Party, claimed party members were being forced
out in a series of back-stabbing campaigns.
He said it was dangerous to link the political divisions with drugs
and racketeering. ''You do not involve yourself like this and do not
speak against drugs cartels,'' he said.
''What Irene Adams is doing is a hell of a risk. She has made herself
an easy target. She should never have made these claims.''
Mrs Adams also alleges that manipulation of the Craigielea branch of
the Labour Party has taken place with appointments of 14 new members who
had been funded by one individual.
She claimed it was part of an orchestrated move to put key Labour
activists in positions of power in Ferguslie.
Her concerns were supported by Mr Con O'Driscoll, the secretary of
Renfrew District Labour Party. He claims 140 new Labour Party members in
the area had their memberships paid by one senior Labour Party
individual, showing the level to which activists were prepared to go to
control vital interests.
He said that when he stood for selection as a Labour candidate last
year, he and his supporters were subjected to a campaign of threats of
physical violence and intimidation by fellow party members.
Last night, Mr Harry Revie, a Strathclyde Regional Councillor, and a
director of FCB, said the rift within the Labour Party in Renfrewshire
had reached new depths and accused Mrs Adams of conducting a smear
campaign.
''I think Mrs Adams has taken leave of her senses,'' said Mr Revie,
agent for Renfrew West and Inverclyde MP, Mr Tommy Graham. He said that
to make a link in ''any way with gangland warfare is absolute garbage.
As for any campaign of intimidation, I have never intimidated anyone in
my life.''
A director of the company -- who did not wish to be named -- said the
police were closing in on the gangland leaders and everyone was becoming
aware of the network of illegal activities.
''We are all afraid, after all, we are talking about people walking
around shooting other people. They are animals and totally fearless,''
said the director.
Mrs Olga Clayton, a Renfrew District Council member and a director of
FCB, said the allegations concerned her greatly. ''Most people are too
frightened to speak to the police,'' she said. ''We have all got
families. I would welcome any inquiry to clear this up.''
Mrs Adams said that if the FCB directors have knowledge of the
activities of the drugs operations they should ''speak out to clear
their own names and help the police in their inquiries''.
Mr Jack McConnell, the general secretary of the Scottish Labour Party,
said he was aware of the rifts within the local Labour Party and had
ordered a full investigation into all aspects of party activity.
District Councillor Hugh Henry, the nominated leader of the new
Renfrewshire unitary authority, said he would have ''no hesitation in
ordering a full investigation'' and would not be party to any cover-up
if members of the Labour Party were involved.
Last night, a spokesman for Strathclyde Police said they had received
information regarding a company in Ferguslie Park and were undertaking
inquiries while also following numerous lines of inquiry following a
recent murder in Linwood.
SNP leader Alex Salmond has meanwhile called on Mr McConnell to say
whether he knew about the seriousness of the problems in Renfrew before
the elections for the new unitary authorities on April 6.
''It would be intolerable and unforgiveable if the Labour Party had
delayed their own inquiry for reasons of electoral expediency. If that
is the case, I have no hesitation in calling for a re-run of the
elections in Renfrew, especially given the closeness of so many of the
results,'' he said.
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang said: ''It is not for me to get involved
in this rather seedy civil war in the Labour Party.''

<HEADLINE>Passengers tell of confusion on catamaran 300 in 'short cut' to disaster on ferry</HEADLINE>

MORE than 300 passengers were rescued yesterday when a ferry smashed
into rocks in a treacherous sea channel off Jersey. Thirty three were
seriously injured.
Most of the injuries were caused during the frantic rescue operation
when passengers leapt from the stricken catamaran as she took on water
and began keeling over.
Eyewitnesses said it appeared that the French-owned Saint-Malo, taking
visitors on a day trip from St Helier to the island of Sark, was
attempting a short cut.
The 400-metre wide strait between the mainland and the Corbiere
lighthouse, was regularly used at high tide to cut five minutes off the
journey time.
The passengers were rescued in an hour-long operation by a flotilla of
lifeboats, local vessels, and Royal Navy helicopters following the
Saint-Malo's distress call shortly after 10am.
There were no fatalities but those injured suffered mainly broken legs
and ankles jumping from the listing ferry.
The catamaran's French captain, Phillipe Panau, is to be interviewed
by the St Helier harbourmaster Captain Roy Bullen, who is leading an
inquiry into the incident.
Passengers told of confusion as water poured through the Saint-Malo's
ruptured hull and the order was given to abandon ship.
Schoolteacher Mike Owen, 32, from Guernsey, on board with his
girlfriend Eleanor McLean, 26, said: ''The passengers were fairly good,
but the couriers just seemed to disappear.
''Some of the crew were good -- when you saw them. We were at the back
of the boat and we were terrified. Water was pouring in and we thought
we were going under. There was no-one to be seen, no advice.''
Mr Karl Gottschalk, 46, from Germany, whose wife Kristal, 46, was
injured and taken to hospital, also spoke of the confusion. ''We were
given two different lots of information by the crew when the incident
happened. People upstairs were told one thing and people downstairs were
told another.
''People had to jump down five metres into the lifeboats. I saw about
50 or 60 people jumping around me. Some of them went into the water.
''We didn't know whether it was going to sink. I was up to my knees in
water. We thought it would turn over in seconds.''
Mr Gottschalk, who was with his son Christian, 14, added: ''I was
terrified for my family.''
A Royal Navy Sea King airlifted one man and five women from one
crowded liferaft. All had fracture injuries, most of them to their legs.
Because of their injuries, the crew of a Seacat ferry alongside the
survival raft could not lift the injured passengers on board and the
helicopter crew was asked to help.
A Navy diver, Petty Officer Simon Allison, was lowered on to the
liferaft where he assessed the condition of the injured passengers.
He said later: ''One woman was in quite a bad way. She had a badly
broken lower leg and was lapsing into unconsciousness. In view of her
condition, I decided she had to be given medical attention as quickly as
possible.
''We lifted her on board the aircraft and flew her immediately to the
landing area at St Helier.''
Captain Bullen said the ferry was probably taking a short cut through
the channel, known as Small Boat Passage, which saved her having to
navigate around the other side of the lighthouse.
At low tide, a causeway is exposed across the channel running between
the mainland and the lighthouse, and the area generally is strewn with
rocks.
Captain Bullen said that, although it was not unusual for small ships
to pass through the channel when the tide was high, it was route avoided
by larger vessels and inexperienced masters.
He said the Saint-Malo had passed through the channel about 90 minutes
after high water. It should have been safe for the catamaran, which has
a shallow draft, to follow the route until about 10.30am.
An angler fishing off the Corbiere lighthouse rocks described what
happened.
Mr Dave Turner, a retired painter, said: ''I saw her coming round the
lighthouse doing the short cut that they normally do and I noticed she
was coming in too close to the land.
''I've seen a lot of them go through and you can judge which way they
are going. She came in too close and she started to turn out to miss the
rock that she hit. But she hit it on her port side. She sort of jolted
around and started to sink straight away.''
Another eyewitness, former Corbiere lighthouse keeper Ted Moignard,
said: ''The rock was not visible, it was not even awash. I would say
they hit on the port afterside.
''He was coming through Small Boat Passage but, instead of going to
the west of the rock he went to the east. He must have noticed he was
off station and turned to go out. As he did so he would have struck the
rock.''
Jersey Police said a total of 65 people had been seen by doctors, of
whom 33 were detained at St Helier General Hospital, mostly with broken
limbs.
Police said there were 185 German and 16 French passengers aboard the
Saint-Malo. The rest were a mixture of local Channel Islanders and
visitors from the British mainland.
Captain Bullen said Captain Panau was an experienced master who had
sailed the route for a number of years. Before taking charge of the
Saint-Malo, owned by the French company Channiland, he skippered ferries
for a rival company.
He said the skipper was sufficiently experienced to have his own
pilotage licence, allowing him to navigate vessels into port himself
instead of taking a pilot on board. The harbourmaster said if Captain
Panau were found to be at fault he would be able to revoke his pilot's
licence but because he was a French national employed by a French
company the British authorities could take no further action.
He did not know why the ferry captain had chosen the route on this
occasion.
''Perhaps he was taking a more interesting route for the benefit of
his passengers,'' he said.
Channiland, which is part of the bigger French ferry operators SNAT,
said the Saint-Malo was a twin-hulled catamaran built in 1993 in Norway.
The Department of Transport announced its Marine Accident
Investigation Branch would carry out an examination of the accident on
behalf of the Jersey authorities.

MARLON BRANDO's daughter has committed suicide, hanging herself at her
home on Tahiti, her family said yesterday.
Relatives said Cheyenne Brando, 25, had been depressed since the
murder of her boyfriend Dag Drollet by her half-brother Christian four
years ago and had made three previous suicide attempts.
She was found hanging in her bedroom at her home in Punaauia on the
French Polynesian island in the south Pacific, on Sunday afternoon, a
relative said.
A report that Marlon Brando had been taken to a hospital in Los
Angeles after hearing the news was denied. His whereabouts were unknown.
Ms Brando, who had a five-year-old son by Drollet, was the daughter of
Marlon Brando and Tarita Teriipaia, a Polynesian who acted in the 1962
film Mutiny on the Bounty, of which Brando was the star.
Christian Brando was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment for the
murder of Drollet but could be released on parole within two to three
weeks for good behaviour, they said.
During the trial, Christian admitted shooting Cheyenne's Tahitian
lover Drollet but claimed it was an accident. He said the gun had gone
off during a struggle. The two men had been fighting over Cheyenne's
claims that Drollet had beaten her.
The shooting took place at Brando's home in Los Angeles.
Cheyenne was arrested in France on charges of complicity in the
killing after her brother had been sentenced.
At the time of the arrest, her lawyer said she was pregnant and
suffering from depression and receiving treatment at a Paris clinic. He
requested psychiatric tests.
The authorities in Polynesia, a French territory, refused to force her
to appear at the trial. She was later allowed medical treatment in
France under judicial control.
Marlon Brando, considered one of the great actors of the century, had
returned to the screen this month with Don Juan de Marco, a romantic
comedy.
Brando's performances in A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), The Wild One
(1953) and On the Waterfront (1954) were acclaimed as classics.
He won an Academy Award for On the Waterfront and another for The
Godfather (1972).
