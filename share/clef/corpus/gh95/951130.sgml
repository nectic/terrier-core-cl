By Our Political Editor
CHANCELLOR Kenneth Clarke is under severe pressure from his party to cut the
cost of borrowing to compensate for his neutral Budget. Britain's biggest
building society, the Halifax, added to this with a 0.25% cut in its lending
rate.
However, the Chancellor is waiting to see what Germany does today and what
interest rate action might be taken in America. He told a news conference:
``The one thing I am not going to do is play fast and loose with interest rates
in response to political pressures.''
The surprise 0.25% reduction to 7.74% by the Halifax was followed immediately
by its competitors, including the Nationwide, National &amp; Provincial, Abbey
National, Bradford &amp; Bingley, Northern Rock, and Britannia.
The cut will benefit more than six million borrowers.
The political pressure on Mr Clarke to boost a slowing economy with an early
cut in the interest rate saw sterling fall against the deutschmark and the
dollar yesterday. Despite this, at the Commons, back-bench Tories were
insisting that the rate should fall from 6.75%.
Mr John Townend, chairman of the Tory back-bench finance committee, said: ``The
Budget has provided a window of opportunity to cut interest rates within the
next few weeks.''
He had been demanding a much more substantial cut in the standard rate of
income tax than the 1p that the Chancellor delivered.
He was supported by several other back benchers. Mr David Nicholson said: ``We
very much hope that there will be a fall in interest rates.''
Mr Mathew Carrington insisted that a ``substantial cut in rates is needed. Mr
Clarke has been very modest and prudent on tax cuts. There should be a half per
cent cut very quickly and a further half per cent before too long.''
Nevertheless, Mr Clarke insisted: ``My job as a Conservative Chancellor is to
run the economy and keep this economy growing faster than anybody else's and
that is what we will do.'' Future economic growth and control of inflation
depended on ``a sensible economic policy and running it in a sensible
fashion''. He added: ``That is what Conservative Governments are for.''
q The Halifax said the reduction in its standard variable mortgage rate would
reduce monthly payments on a #30,000 repayment mortgage by #4.07 to #206.45, a
#50,000 loan goes down by #7.37 to #352.68, and a #100,000 mortgage is cut by
#15.67 to #734.37.
On an endowment loan the reductions are: #30,000 loan down #5.32 to #164.48;
#50,000 down #9.49 to #293.48; and #100,000 down #19.91 to #615.98.

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth was greeted by derision yesterday as he
unveiled his much-publicised new vision for the treatment of Scottish politics.
Opposition MPs laughed openly as he suggested that the Prime Minister and the
Chancellor of the Exchequer could take part in debates in the Scottish Grand
Committee, which would meet in different locations around Scotland.
The committee is in line to be given greater powers but it emerged from Mr
Forsyth's statement that these would only be ``when it makes sense to do so'' -
in other words controversial Bills would still have to go through the full
Commons procedure even if their initial stages were taken in Scotland.
Third Readings of Bills also could be taken in the Scottish Grand Committee but
that would only be after they had gone through ``detailed consideration and
amendment''.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson described the plans as a
``travelling circus'' which was no substitute for a Scottish Parliament elected
by and responsible to the Scottish people.
Mr Forsyth will put some meat on the bones of his plans in a St Andrew's Day
speech this evening but his line last night was that it was right to expand the
role of the Scottish Grand Committee, with senior Ministers called in to
present policies, react to criticisms of them, and for this to be done in a
forum accessible to the people of Scotland.
He has plans for eight meetings next year of the committee to consider
Government business, all of which will be held in Scotland.
He angrily rejected plans for a tax-raising parliament which, he said, would
damage Scotland's jobs and prosperity, and said the Government already had made
clear in the White Paper, Scotland in the Union, that it believed the current
approach was to work within the existing framework to make Government and
Parliament at all levels more visible and relevant to the people.
He claimed the changes he proposed would greatly strengthen the role of the
Scottish Grand Committee in considering legislation affecting Scotland.
``It will provide a new focus for the role of the Scottish Grand Committee in
scrutinising and calling to account not just Scottish Office Ministers but
every Minister. The Scottish Grand Committee will thus assume an increasingly
pivotal role in the parliamentary government of Scotland, in bringing
Government closer to the people and in underpinning the Union.
``What the people of Scotland want is government close to them, government
listening to them and, above all, government accountable to them.''
Mr Robertson described the Secretary of State's remarks as a ``stark admission
that the Government's policies towards Scotland have utterly failed.'' For
taking stock we now had taking the Michael, and do nothing had been replaced by
do as little as possible, he said.
He demanded: ``Is this the full breadth of the Secretary of State's vision? New
Forsyth, New Status Quo?
``Is this the Secretary of State's big idea: weekend breaks for the Cabinet?
After all the hype, all the publicity, is this the best he could come up with?''
Mr Robertson questioned whether the revamped Scottish Grand Committee would be
anything more than a rubber stamp for non-controversial legislation. ``What has
changed?'' he asked. ``An extra stage to Scottish Bills, a few more meetings, a
few more debates, a few more opportunities to hear Ministers and their
reinforcements from the  Cabinet  dodge difficult questions?''
For the Liberal Democrats, Scottish leader Jim Wallace said: ``These changes
amount to no more than a series of away-day returns for a succession of
Government Ministers. They can come to Scotland, explain their policies and
react to criticism, but nowhere is there any suggestion that the Government
will change its policies in the light of Scottish opinion.
``There is nothing in this statement which would have prevented the poll tax,
nothing that will stop the introduction of nursery vouchers in its tracks. Far
from strengthening the Union, these proposals may well weaken it by showing how
clearly unresponsive the Government is to Scotland's needs and its political
agenda.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond said: ``The proposals announced by Forsyth confirm that
the Westminster veto remains intact over every aspect of Scottish affairs.
Scottish MPs are trusted to examine uncontroversial Bills but are not to be
trusted to consider anything contentious. Even on uncontroversial measures,
Westminster would still rule, OK.''
Mr Major and Mr Kenneth Clarke, meanwhile, have agreed dates for their
appearances in Scotland, which are expected to be announced shortly. Last
night, Mr Forsyth claimed other Cabinet Ministers were queuing up to appear in
Scotland, and extra dates for meetings of the Scottish Grand Committee would
have to be laid on.
He accepted that the cost of taking it to towns and cities around Scotland - he
suggested Stirling, in his constituency, and Hamilton, in that of Mr Robertson,
as two possibilities - would be high.
He compared that to the cost of Labour's Scottish Parliament, which Scottish
Office officials have calculated at #40m a year to run, plus a one-off #35m to
prepare the building. ``The addi

THE British-American special relationship was given new impetus yesterday with
the visit to London of President Clinton.
Mr Clinton's major duty on the first day of a three-day visit was to address
the Houses of Parliament. He hailed the ``extraordinary relationship'' between
the countries and was praised warmly later by Prime Minister John Major at a
state banquet at No 10 Downing Street.
Mr Major described the speech as ``memorable'', adding: ``It showed detailed
knowledge of our history, a great deal of it shared with the United States.''
``It could only have been made by a long-standing friend of this country.''
Mr Clinton and his wife Hillary started their visit to London, Belfast, and
Dublin, with a wreath-laying ceremony at the grave of the unknown soldier at
Westminster Abbey.
Then Mr Clinton and Mr Major walked from the abbey to Downing Street amid
massive security.
Later, the president was welcomed amid pomp and pageantry to Westminster by the
Prime Minister and Commons Speaker Betty Boothroyd.
Arriving to a fanfare of trumpets, he addressed a packed Royal Gallery in the
House of Lords.
Baroness Thatcher, who invited former President Ronald Reagan to speak to
Parliament in the early 80s, was among the guests to hear Mr Clinton describe
the links between the two countries.
Hailing the ``extraordinary relationship'', Mr Clinton said ``it unites us in a
way never before seen in the ties between two such great nations''.
Recalling that he had been to Westminster many times before, he said he always
``felt the power of this place, where the voices of free people who love
liberty, believe in reason, and struggle for truth, have for centuries kept
your great nation a beacon of hope for all the world''.
Mr Clinton said: ``For a long time, I thought if my forebears had not left this
country perhaps I might have gotten here on my own, at least to the House of
Commons.
``But now our American television carries your question time and I have seen
Prime Minister Major and Mr Blair and other members slicing each other up face
to face with such great wit and skill against the din of cheers and jeers. I am
now convinced my forebears did me a great favour,'' he said to laughter.
Although the Cold War was over, the forces of destruction were still a
challenge.
``We see it in the growth of ethnic hatred, extreme nationalism, and religious
fanaticism which most recently took the life of one of the greatest champions
of peace in the entire world - the prime minister of Israel.''
It was also evident in acts of terrorism that resulted in deaths from Islamabad
to Paris, from Riyad to Oklahoma, and the organised drug trade.
But both the United States and the United Kingdom bore a special burden of
responsibility.
``After so much success together, we know that our relationship with the United
Kingdom must be at the heart of our striving in this new era: because of the
history we have lived, because of the power and prosperity we enjoy, because of
the accepted truth that you and we have no dark motives in our dealings with
other nations.''
As if to underline the strength of the partnership, Mr Clinton announced that a
US warship would be named after Winston Churchill.
Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind later praised the close bonds of the
UK-American relationship in the Commons.

ANYONE in the property sector who had been hoping for a boost from the Budget
found themselves disappointed on Tuesday.
``I can't see the Budget having any impact whatsoever on commercial real
estate,'' said Ted Webster of international surveyors Richard Ellis. ``To be
fair, I don't think it's the Government's job to stimulate commercial property
development. But by stimulating activity in the economy the Government can
create an increased demand for industrial, office and retail space. Essentially
property is a reactive sector.''
However, if the Budget was to be followed up by a reduction in interest rates
then the investment side of the property sector could receive a boost. ``For
the last couple of quarters, total returns from property have out-performed
gilts,'' said Mr Webster. ``Combine that with a further lowering in interest
rates and you will see a stimulus of the investment market. People would be
seeking to buy income streams, even if rentals did not increase.''
In declining to take the traditional route of boosting demand by announcing
extra public expenditure in the construction sector, the Chancellor is clearly
signalling that future capital projects will be funded via the controversial
Private Finace Initiative (PFI).
``The construction and property industry now accepts that the PFI will replace
the normal procurement route for large capital projects,'' says Webster. ``But
in many ways the big companies are ahead of the Government. There is a
willingness to get on with these schemes but the Government and the civil
servants are slow in bringing suitable schemes forward to the tendering stage.
There's also a widespread worry that the cost of tendering for PFI schemes is
too high.''
Phil Reid, of international surveyors Jones Lang Wootton, says: ``Apart from
one or two hot spots, such as the retail sector, commercial property is marking
time at the moment. Only an increase in demand will create new activity - and
it's patently obvious that no such increase in activity will flow from the
Budget. People still see property as a cost on which they must keep a tight
rein.''
He has seen several clients postpone relocation decisions over the last six
months, despite the availability of good premises at good prices. However, he
does see one chink of light.
``If it's true that industrial demand is a barometer of the economy, then
things seem to be getting better. We are seeing a steadily increasing demand
for space across all the industrial sectors, from traditional space users to
high-tech firms - but many lettings are still supported by public sector
subsidies of one sort or another.''
The Chancellor's introduction of a landfill levy of #7 per tonne has
implications for the regeneration of derelict and contaminated sites, often
known as brownfield land. ``Developers and agencies considering the remediation
of brownfield sites will have to take the new levy into consideration - and in
some cases the additional #7 per tonne could push redevelopment schemes out of
financial kilter,'' says Alistair Dalziel of environmental consultants RPS
Cairns.
``The other big impact will be on individual companies which will now have to
look very carefully at controlling the waste they generate. Such companies will
now see waste as a threat to profitability. The cost of waste is accelerating
faster than the Retail Price Index and is now an important influence on bottom
line profits.''
Kemp Lindsey, an environmental specialist with surveyors Grimley, welcomed the
landfill levy. ``An incentive to reduce the amount of waste that goes into
landfill must be a good thing. But there are many practical implications which
still need to be hammered out.'' And he warned that the levy will not be
absorbed by waste operators, but will be passed directly on to the waste
producers.

A MAJOR furniture manufacturer is poised to settle into new large-scale
premises. Forrest Furnishing has acquired a 148,000 sq ft facility at Dalkeith
(above) from the administrative receivers of Ferranti International plc. The
building is set in within its own 13.3 acres of ground at Thornybank Industrial
Estate.
Conditional consent has been obtained to allow change of use from industrial to
50,000 sq ft of furniture retail space, plus ancillary storage, manufacturing,
assembly and office accommodation.
The five-storey building was developed 22 years ago and extended in 1989.
Forrest Furnishing is undertaking a #1.2m refurbishment programme to convert
and upgrade the facility. The site has parking for 200 cars.
``This acquisition will allow us to service the market in the East of Scotland
and the Borders and will enable expansion of our existing Glasgow based retail
operations,'' says managing director Ken Forrest. ``At Dalkeith, we will also
be able to expand our facilities for manufacture, assembly, storage and
distribution.''
Surveyors Graham &amp; Sibbald acted for Forrest Furnishing. Ryden acted for
administrative receivers Arthur Andersen. The purchase price was not disclosed.
Meanwhile a rental of #14 per sq ft has been achieved in a new deal at South
Gyle Park, the West Edinburgh business park recently acquired by Grosvenor
Estates Holdings. The 3,630 sq ft first floor at 36 South Gyle Crescent has
been let to Usher Systems Ltd, a provider of software packages to the legal
profession.
The starting rental is #51,000 per annum on a full 20-year lease. A further
7000 sq ft is available in 36 South Gyle Crescent, which has been fitted out as
offices by Grosvenor. South Gyle Park also offers some 6.5 acres of development
land. Usher systems was represented by Alexander Macaulay Associates, while
Chesterton acted on behalf of Grosvenor.

WHO'S on the Internet, then? The Diary will be on it from this weekend, but the
only rugby club in Scotland on at the moment is Annan.
It's thanks to Angus Robertson, an MSC chappie from Napier and son of Annan
president Alan, who has put the club at http://www. gopages. com/
Colosseum/1920 . . . or something like that.
Most of the contact so far has been from America, where there are hundreds of
clubs on the Internet, although some have also come from England. Among the
fascinating aspects available for perusal at other clubs are player profiles of
Brian Moore and Will Carling. Leicester, Harlequins and Sale are all on. Oh
yes, we'll be spending hours in that bit of the web all right.
But mischief is in the air. Our computer buff friend has created a spoof
Dumfries page for all the world to communicate with as well.
There is bad blood, from the dark ages of history, between Annan and Dumfries.
So young Mr Robertson has taken a spoof page in the name of Dumfries Prayer
Page, where the rugby people of the world have been invited to deposit a prayer
to help Dumfries rugby club. Many beautiful prayers have arrived, and since
then Dumfries have won their last two games.
``It's a great way of spreading news about the club,'' said a taken aback Colin
Brown, the Dumfries secretary. ``We will do the same.''
``Do the same?'' retorted Dumfries committee man Don Wylie. ``I'll be selling
prayer mats behind the bar from now on if it works.''
A hint there for the rest of us perhaps.
q.THERE are few ladies in Scotland who will have a better understanding of
rugby than Rhona Lawson, the Isle of Arran rugby team secretary.
She is famous in rugby for being super organised, and she goes everywhere with
the team. Arran are about to build new pitches at Brodick costing #800,000, but
that is not what this little piece is about.
The Diary understands that Rhona, who is now retired after having started her
interest in rugby as a tea girl at Hillhead school in Glasgow, is writing a
book called A Woman's Perspective of Rugby. To settle a few minds, this is not
an expose, but a beautiful look back at her involvement in the game since those
early days, charting her progress through Rose Street in Edinburgh, and taking
us to the present.
``I have had discussions with a publisher,'' says Rhona. ``It's been a 40-year
involvement in the game, and it's been my life. I may need a sponsor.''
Rhona tells the Diary that she is mid-way through her third chapter, which is
all about Bill McLaren, and it is entitled, The Comfortable Alternative.
McLaren will be delighted to learn that this is about how listening to the
great man's tones compares to a hard day and night at Murrayfield ..... and not
about Rhona testing Bill McLaren's testosterone levels.
q.DOCTOR James Dabbs of Georgia State University has proved that sporting
excitement can make you feel that warm, affectionate way. Come on, you remember.
During the football World Cup in Atlanta he sent volunteers into bars for
samples. Of saliva, you'll be glad to know.
When Brazil played Italy his tests showed that the testosterone levels of the
Brazilian supporters had risen by 27% after the game, but had dropped 26.7% in
the Italian fans. Brazil beat Italy.
I conducted my own research after the Scotland v Western Samoa draw. Results
were inconclusive. Big Jill from Haddington turned me down again. And something
I can't mention happened when Kenny Logan came on the TV.
q.JOHN Jeffrey may have needed some of that medicine. Playing for a golden
oldies team in Bermuda last week, where the players are farmed out to local
families, he was billeted with a 40-year-old divorcee.
Much to his discomfort the lady in question made breakfast in her nightie,
waited up for him to come home late at night, popped off work to help him pack
his bag, and came to every game.
JJ says he has never had so many headaches in his life. That's what he's saying
and I believe him.
q.PETER Wright fell foul of Ken McCartney as we all know. But the Diary
understands that Jim Fleming, one of Scotland's international referees, was
getting fed up with a player's back-chat recently.
``You want to be a referee?'' quipped Fleming to the player. ``Wednesday
evening, six-thirty, Edinburgh referee's society, Inverleith ..... be there!''
qTHE in-crowd held a surprise party for Kenny Milne at his father's house at
the weekend. Gav, the lot really, were there.
As the unsuspecting Baby Bear entered the house Bohemian Rhapsody which, as the
world knows, is Kenny Milne's party piece, started to blare at full volume.
Yes, it was wonderful. Don't know why the Diary is so delighted though. We
weren't flaming invited.

Ralph Uriah Hunsecker Blane, songwriter, born Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, July 26,
1914, died there November 13, 1995
WITH his partner, Hugh Martin, Ralph Blane wrote the score for one of the
greatest of all MGM musicals, Vincente Minelli's Meet Me In St Louis, in which
Judy Garland sang The Trolley Song. It won the 1944 best song Academy Award,
but it was not a one-song score.
The film was rich in ballads still sung today, including Have Yourself a Merry
Little Christmas, which vies with Berlin's White Christmas for being the most
recorded Christmas song, and the wistful The Boy Next Door.
Born in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, Blane maintained close links with his home
state throughout his long career, and eventually retired there. He was educated
at Northwestern University, where he studied piano, dancing, and voice, before
joining the St Louis Muncipal Opera Company in 1934. Then he went to Broadway,
working as a singer in revues and musicals, and met Martin.
The partnership was one in which they took credit together for everything they
produced, regardless of who thought of it first. Before finding success in
their own right as composers, they had a fair career as orchestrators, working
for Richard Rogers on The Boys from Syracuse.
In 1941 they wrote the college boys musical, Best Foot Foward, for George Abbot
with its rousing hymn to the alma mater, Buckle Down Winsocki. That led to MGM,
signing them up for films like Thousands Cheer and then Meet Me in St Louis.
Blane's solo career as a composer included the the Jane Russell film, The
French Line, and the Betty Grable musical, My Blue Heaven. With Martin he wrote
The Girl Rush, which starred Rosalind Russell, Athena, and The Girl Most
Likely. In 1989, both aged 75, they worked together on the Broadway version of
Meet Me In St Louis.

JOHN Price, the defending champion, became the first player to win the CIS
Masters for a third time when he beat world champion Andy Thomson 7-3, 0-7,
7-4, 7-5 in last night's final in Coatbridge. Scottish interest had ended
earlier in the day when Price cruised to a 7-1, 7-2 win over Commonwealth gold
medallist Richard Corsie while Thomson beat Scottish champion Paul Conlan 7-3,
1-7,     7-1.
Price, who was lining up in his fifth final in the seven-year history of the
Masters, made a great start with doubles on the opening three ends. The world
No.1 broke his duck with three shots on the fourth end, but a single on the
next gave Price the set 7-3.
However, the match then swung dramatically in Thomson's favour. With Price's
deft touch suddenly deserting him, Thomson counted 11 shots over the next five
ends to take the second set on a whitewash and move 4-0 ahead in the third.
Then it was Price's turn to take command. Ten shots over the next six ends saw
him take the third set 7-4 and move 3-0 ahead in the fourth before Thomson
pushed himself     back into contention with       two doubles and a single to
lead 5-3.
On the next, with both     players having dead-length touchers, Price played
the shot of the match with his final delivery, turning Thomson's toucher
through the head for what almost produced a match-winning count of 4, but the
Swansea man had to settle for a 3 that pushed him ahead again 6-5.
Price then added the single he needed to take the #1600 first prize on the next
end, wrapping up a 7-3, 0-7, 7-4, 7-5 win.
Both players later agreed that Price's shot on the penultimate end was the
match-winner.
``From 5-3 down it gave me a 6-5 lead and just the boost I needed at the right
time,'' said Price, while Thomson said: ``It was a risky shot that could have
gone wrong, but full marks to John for playing it. He took his courage in both
hands and was rewarded.''
Earlier, hopes of a home victory disappeared at the semi-final stage when both
Corsie and Conlan tumbled to defeat.Corsie was the first to bow out, going down
against Price, and then Scottish champion Conlan lost 3-7, 7-1, 1-7 to Thomson.
The eagerly anticipated Price-Corsie clash failed to produce the fireworks
expected with Price dominating from the opening end and wrapping up his
straight-sets win in just 13 ends.
Conlan, who had survived a slow start in his quarter-final victory over Alex
Marshall, started well with an opening end double but Thomson slowly hauled
himself back and went on to take the set 7-3. Conlan then needed just three
ends to take the second set 7-1.

TIMBERLAKE Wertenbaker's The Break of Day is one brave play. Flawed,
over-schematic, and bedevilled by sentimentality, unusually for Wertenbaker and
her director Max Stafford Clark, this is, however, a tugging, pioneering,
modern counterpoint to Chekhov's Three Sisters - the other work currently on
tour by Stafford Clark's Out of Joint company.
Wertenbaker has updated Chekhov's ideas of the search for happiness and hope in
the future and the sisters' longing into the very pertinent issue of women and
fertility, setting beside it, as saviour to all those swirling female hormones,
the necessity of work.
Without it, Wertenbaker shows, women are at the mercy of their bodies. Equally
bravely, she plants her colours firmly in the intellectual camp.
``We only want to try and understand what's happened,'' declares former
magazine editor Tess, at the end reduced to a jangling wreck by her obsession
to have a child.
Her sister in feminism, the doughty, determined Nina (Maria Friedman) has also
been laid low by the hunger of the unfillable void, trailing off to the eastern
block to find and adopt a baby.
Taking us behind the headlines of those heartbreak mothers, Wertenbaker shows
the madness, the humiliating IVF tests, and the anguish and bewilderment of the
various husbands and spouses with ground-breaking honesty.
Only partially sucessful, though parallelling Three Sisters to a remarkable
degree, the first half falls into a fairly familiar Royal Court style of sharp
one-liners about art and life and an England in despair.
However, the second half with Nina and Hugh's battle against crazed bureaucracy
in a post-communist world is the true child of Chekhov - tragic and farcical in
equal measure.
The Break of Day runs to 6 January.

Lt-Col A C C Brodie, DSO, OBE, MC
THE Black Watch has recently lost a depressingly large number of gallant
wartime officers, the latest being Alec Brodie who was certainly the most
colourful and best known. He was a legend in the regiment and anyone who knew
him would have some hilarious story about him.
He was born in London in 1912 - the son of a city merchant. He was educated at
Stowe and, while a boy, contracted polio which left his face with a rather
crooked appearance. He was commissioned into the Black Watch in 1932 and was on
operations in Palestine at the outbreak of war in 1939.
The first part of his war was rather peripatetic. He learned Serbo-Croat in
Belgrade and served as military attache in Athens and Sofia. He had spells in
the second battalion and in the Middle East Commando. On his own admission he
was frequently moved on as no-one could quite handle his unorthodox behaviour.
He described his various sackings as ``catching the 11 o'clock train''.
He joined the 5th Battalion in Normandy and won the MC at Colombelles. He
stoically stuck to his position to allow the rest of the battalion to withdraw.
Although badly wounded he remained with his men to recover an anti-tank gun.
Some six months later he won the DSO at Goch near the Rhine. On this occasion
he led his company in a series of daring attacks which bordered on suicidal.
However, despite being severely wounded many times he took the position and was
able to hold it against determined counter-attacks.
It was this reckless bravery that made commanders wary of putting him in
command of soldiers. However, the Jocks adored him and he could remember the
name and family background of all those who served under him. As a result of
his boyhood polio and war wounds he cut rather a grotesque figure and his
high-pitched voice and eccentric mannerisms were frequently mimicked.
One frequently told and suitable exaggerated story concerns his activities in
the town of Gennep. It was cold and wet and there was intermittent enemy fire
coming down the street when Alec appeared round the corner under an umbrella.
When questioned about the umbrella he pointed out that it was raining. He led
that sort of charmed life.
After the war he was military attache in Seoul, Laos, and Beirut. It came as no
surprise that war broke out in each place just after the arrival of Alec.
Nevertheless, he was awarded the OBE for his work in Beirut. After retirement
he was commandant of Barry Buddon Training Camp for 17 years.
Alec was a kind and caring person and was always willing to help the young and
inexperienced. He cared little for rules or orthodoxy. No more so than in the
way he dressed. In uniform he never conformed to the accepted forms of dress
and made up his attire, I suspect, as it came to hand.
He laughed at himself and we did so with him because he was a larger-than-life
funny man. Such characters are not in the Army now and the Army is poorer for
it.
n Appreciation by Colonel Robert Gurdon, regimental secretary, the Black Watch.

Iain Wilson considers the effect the Budget will have on Scotland
WHEN giving Budget details, it's not what you do but the way that you do it
..... and Michael Forsyth certainly did it his way. His response to Kenneth
Clarke's Budget for the Scottish Office over the next three years was one of
``delight''.
Predictably, the Scottish Secretary also sang loud and long about next year's
total allocation being, in cash terms, the highest ever - up #173m on this
year. He also celebrated retention of the Barnett formula, which guarantees
Scotland an enhanced fixed share of spending.
In the world of politics, there was nothing wrong with such a triumphal
presentation of his public expenditure negotiations, reputed to be ``the
toughest'' for many years.
The reality is different. In real, not cash, terms, there is no denying a #329m
cut in the Scottish Office budget next year. Or that by 1998-99, cuts will have
risen to 5%.
It would also appear the rest of the UK has fared better than Forsyth in the
battle for spending money. The Red Book, the Government's financial statement,
shows the Scottish Office budget will increase by 2.3% in cash terms by 1998-99
- compared with 7.9% for the UK overall.
However, in real terms, over the same period - once inflation is taken into
account - the Scottish Office's planned ``out-turn'', what it really spends, is
scheduled to fall by 5%, in contrast to a 0.2% rise elsewhere in Britain.
Scotland's overall decline in spending power is put at #700m, down from #14.1
billion next year to #13.4 billion in 1998-99.
The ``brutal truth'' will emerge within weeks, according to Shadow Scottish
Secretary George Robertson, when Forsyth has to provide Parliament with a
detailed breakdown of expenditure plans.
Robertson is among political opponents who believe Forsyth's initial cheer
after Tuesday's Budget was based merely upon limiting damage during Treasury
``negotiations''.
However, even Professor Brian Ashcroft, director of Strathclyde University's
influential Fraser of Allander Institute, suggested yesterday Forsyth's delight
was misplaced.
Ashcroft stressed there are substantial differences between increases in cash
terms and real terms, when the Government's own projected inflation figures of
between 2.25% and 2.75%-a-year up to 1998-1999 are taken into account.
He stressed it was possible the Government expects Scotland's population to
decline over the next three years. If so, it would be possible
spending-per-person will not fall by as much as 5%. He reckons that scenario
could explain why the Scottish Secretary failed to get more money in real terms.
Meanwhile, Labour predicted the public expenditure cuts will hit housing,
roads, and Scottish Enterprise in particular - regardless of claims that
spending will be supplemented by an estimated #2.2 billion worth of Private
Finance Initiatives by 1999.
Robertson expects budgets for education and law and order will hold up, but
fears many other areas will be damaged. He especially fears that Scottish
Enterprise's expenditure on training will suffer.
The Shadow Secretary said of Forsyth's pleasure at defending the Barnett
formula: ``Who was he fighting? We are told it was a great victory, but the
truth is that he `battled' to keep something we have had since 1978.
``Barnett survived the whole period of Margaret Thatcher; Michael Portillo as
Chief Secretary to the Treasury, and others from Jonathan Aitken to William
Waldegrave. What is the big deal?''
SNP leader Alex Salmond said Forsyth's delight was obligatory, despite the
sharp fall in spending power over three years. He pointed out public
expenditure will fall in Scotland yet increase slightly in UK, and added:
``That is a fact, whether Michael Forsyth likes it or not.
``I do not understand why he is celebrating because the Scottish Office budget
is more a wake than a party.''
``Perhaps he is happy because he has not lost more than #700m. But it is very
difficult to see where such cuts will come from without damaging key services.''
Forsyth himself says: ``I fought and won the battle for Scotland to make sure
the Scottish people continue to benefit from the greater spending they have
enjoyed for many years.
``The most important victory was to make sure the Scottish settlement was in
line with other departments and I was successful in that fight.''
He adds, support for local authorities had increased by over #100m, and the
Scottish Office was one of the most successful departments in pioneering PFI.
Private investors would spend #930m in the next three years on important
projects to boost Scotland's infrastructure.

FEW would doubt Candy Dulfer's inordinately large instrumental ability: one of
the world's most naturally gifted saxophone players, her services have been
hired by everyone from the seriously funky (Prince) to ageing hippies (Dave
Stewart, Van Morrison) trying to give their increasingly dull outputs some
spark.
In between times, Dulfer has mixed with the jazz elite (David Sanborn and
Marcus Miller contribute to her current album Big Girl), which makes it
something of a surprise that the Plaza is so sparsely populated for what is her
first appearance in Glasgow.
It becomes easier to establish why as the set wears on, for Dulfer's
eclecticism serves to alienate, rather than embrace a wide range of potential
audiences from jazz through easy listening to funk: whetting many an appetite,
satisfying none.
The seventies backing band are, as expected, flawless but fussy, the set
building from lightweight and meandering jazz doodlings into some infinitely
more serious funk.
Tommy Gun and Capone are next year's elevator music, calling to mind the likes
of Mezzoforte and Shakatak, while the Miles Davis tribute, 2 Miles,
encapsulates Dulfer's dilemma. For all its tightness of execution, you know
that Davis himself would never have come up with something so cluttered, flashy
and underwhelming.
Ironically, the prosaic nature of the opening part of the show is abruptly
halted by the arrival of three powerful gospel-driven singers for an extended
funk workout. Equally banal in content, the likes of Get Funky and Funkyness
are at least more enjoyable, encroaching on Brand New Heavies territory.
However, when her own Heavenly City merges into Rufus's Stop On By and she
embarks on a lengthy run through the Average White Band's Pick Up The Pieces,
it becomes obvious that Dulfer's real talent lies as an interpreter rather than
originator of songs.

THE gig that sounded like a race horse looked like one you could have put your
money on - and so it turned out. It was the sort of night that restores your
faith in the package tour: three of Ireland's foremost folky attractions, each
of whom could have headlined.
These are busy times for Eleanor Shanley. No sooner had she stopped touring
with Christy Moore than she was back on the road, back in Glasgow and back on
form.
Last time round she sounded road weary. This time, the sharpness was back. She
sang with confidence, a jaunty new song, The Dawning of the Day, in there
beside strong regulars like her voice and bodhran Still I Love Him and the
wholehearted Magdalene Laundry, with Robbie Overson's percussive guitar pushing
her on.
Sharon Shannon's current band may not have quite the virtuosic depth of the one
she brought a couple of Mayfests ago but it's certainly as mobile, rattling off
Simon Jeffes's Music for a Found Harmonium with unstoppable gusto. Shannon may
not have much to say for herself but with her equally ridiculous talents on
button accordion, fiddle and tin whistle, who cares?
Luka Bloom, on the other hand, worked alone, at least initially, before various
bill sharers arrived to help out, and confirmed once again that he doesn't need
a band. He can draw the listener in with a simple wordless refrain.
Like his elder brother, Christy Moore, he has vast reserves of quiet power and
whether crooning Black is the Colour, rapping I Need Love or railing against
French nuclear experiments, he is a fascinatingly persuasive performer.

AS another thunderstorm rumbled in last night to give The Wanderers ground in
Johannesburg a third soaking in 24 hours, there were fears that England's
second Test against South Africa would be ruined by bad weather, just like the
first.
But for two batsmen at opposite ends of the experience scale, Robin Smith and
Mark Ramprakash, the pressure has been rising even quicker than local reservoir
levels.
Smith, England's most capped player and leading run scorer among a tour party
of 16, has produced just one convincing innings so far. Happily for him, it
came during the first Test at Centurion Park, where he scored 43 and displayed
typical courage until defeated by a superb delivery from Brian McMillan.
But against Orange Free State in Bloemfontein, Smith collected his third duck
of the trip - and worse, took 42 minutes and 30 balls to do it.
``I am very worried about how Robin is playing,'' admitted manager Ray
Illingworth. ``He's not played particularly well on tour and that wasn't the
most exciting nought you've seen. But we are backing his Test experience and
temperament.
``I don't think he's doing anything more wrong than he's always done,'' added
Illingworth, offering less than 100% backing for Smith's technique when asked
whether any particular problems were obvious to his expert eyes.
What England do know, though, is that Smith possesses a proven track record,
will fight as though his life depends on the outcome, and revels in a big match
atmosphere.
Two of those three huge pluses cannot yet be entered in the credit column under
Mark Ramprakash's name. No-one doubts his determination, nor his natural talent
for that matter, but to date, 31 Test innings have earned him a ludicrously low
average of 17.
``We know he can play, he knows he can play,'' said Illingworth. ``I think he
does get a bit uptight about Test cricket, but one nice big score would ease
that.``
Waiting in the wings and unable to get a Test outing at the moment is John
Crawley, scorer of 312 first-class runs from four completed innings to date.
England's bowlers will get their chance, weather permitting, to explore the
strength of South Africa's batting. But the exact composition of the attack was
still uncertain last night.
A last look in the morning at a pitch that was damp and grassy yesterday will
sort out whether spinner Richard Illingworth, fast bowler Devon Malcolm or
left-arm seamer Mark Ilott gets the final spot.
South Africa, who badly misread the pitch in the first Test, plan to field a
more balanced attack this time. They fielded five pace bowlers at Centurion
Park only to watch England amass 381 for nine.
``We miss Fanie de Villiers, and Meyrick Pringle's ability to swing the ball
away from the bat gives us the variety that Fanie brought,'' said South African
coach Bob Woolmer.
Pringle replaces Brett Schultz, who bowled only 16 overs in the first Test
after sustaining a recurrence of a strained buttock muscle. Woolmer also
indicated that Transvaal slow left armer Clive Eksteen was part of his plans.
Teams (from):
England - M Atherton (captain), A Stewart, M Ramprakash, G Thorpe, G Hick, R
Smith, J Russell, D Cork, D Gough, R Illingworth, A Fraser, D Malcolm, M Ilott.
South Africa - A Hudson, G Kirsten, H Cronje (captain), D Cullinan, J Rhodes, B
McMillan, D Richardson, S Pollock, C Eksteen, A Donald, M Pringle, C Matthews.
q DEMAND for tickets for England's Texaco Trophy one-day international against
India at The Oval next season has broken all records. Tickets for the match,
which takes place on May 23 next year, were snapped up in just four weeks.
q INDIA beat New Zealand by six wickets in their sixth and final one-day
international in Bombay yesterday to win the series 3-2. One match was washed
out by rain. Scores:
New Zealand 126 (35 overs); India 128 for four (32 overs).

SO much for your Internet and the communications revolution. All it takes is a
postal strike and civilised discourse grinds to a halt.
What could have been cheerier than for Erasure to invite members of their fan
club onto the Renfrew Ferry for an unpublicised song session? Well, the actual
delivery of said invites would have been a help.
Thus it was that the Ferry was in no danger of being over-laden on Tuesday
night. A disappointment for Erasure, whose low-key appearances elsewhere have
met with a riotous response, but what a treat for those who managed to get
onboard.
It is possible to like Erasure for their danceability, their melodies, and
their outrageous costumed campery. Amid the bleeps and sweeps of Vince Clarke's
programmed keyboards - irritating or ecstatic depending on your chemical
balance - it is easy to miss the fact Erasure generate some nifty melodies, and
Andy Bell actually sings them with a voice that soars all the way up from his
tummy and projects far beyond the microphone.
Simplicity was thus Tuesday's keynote. Dressed plainly for a night down the pub
or for chatting with fans, the amiable Messrs Bell and Clarke, plus guitarist
Nick Johnson, provided three songs performed acoustically: the last single Stay
With Me, (as you might expect), Sono Luminus, and Always from the I Say album
which sounded almost medieval. Quite beautiful. Remove the computers and you
have troubadors, timeless and true.

Angelo Fazzi, food and wine expert; born, February 15, 1903, died November 24,
1995
THE 16-year-old Italian, dressed in a smart coat, who arrived for the first
time to a cold and foggy Motherwell Station at 11am in the morning of November
19, 1919, just wanted to turn round and go back home to the warmth of Tuscany.
An action-packed 76 years later and that same man's last words were: ``I belong
to Glasgow.'' He never lost the love of his native land but like other
immigrants before, he had grown to love this country and its people and chose
to die here.
Angelo Fazzi was the youngest of the three original Fazzi brothers who founded
the famous delicatessen in Clyde Street in Glasgow and thus started the
education of Glaswegians on the delights of Italian cooking.
Born in a well-established, close family in the enchanting countryside of
Lucca, a small town in western Tuscany, he belonged to a generation where life
signified constant struggle. By his eighth birthday both his older brother and
his father had died young from causes that now no longer challenge modern
medicine.
The year 1914 heralded the departure of his oldest brother Pietro to Motherwell
and the other brother Guiseppe to the front to fight for his country in the
Great War. During the difficult war years, young Angelo learned to tend the
vine and the olive and developed that empathy for the land and its fruits which
characterised his later life. The joy that came with the arrival of the
armistice was tempered by his leaving home at a very young age to come to our
distant northern land.
As one would expect, being an Italian in Scotland in those days meant long
working hours serving in a cafe or making ice cream or lemonade in a dingy
cellar. It took at least one year before the new arrivals to this country had
made the time to visit its capital, which they liked and its major city,
Glasgow, which they found to be far too busy and dirty.
The success they reaped from their energy and commitment to the business (they
worked from 6am to 12pm seven days a week) gave them the resources to import
the food and wine of their homeland for their own consumption.
Thankfully the liberal trade laws of this country made this an easy exercise
and thus in 1923, in response to their perception of an unsatisfied demand for
Italian produce from by then a large immigrant Italian population, Angelo Fazzi
bought a bike and started to travel to sell the surplus.
In 1926 they rented their first shop in Maxwell Street, Glasgow. It was such a
success that they were forced, in 1928, to move into new, larger premises in
232 Clyde Street, Glasgow, where the business remains to this day.
In the Second World War Angelo Fazzi was interned in the Isle of Man and
narrowly escaped having to go aboard the Arandora Star on its fateful journey
to Canada when it went down with all souls. Angelo was one of the founder
members of the Casa D'Italia and a leading member of the Italian community in
Scotland.
After helping to re-establish the firm after the Second World War he retired
finally in 1977 to his house in Glasgow. He was a man of prodigious energy with
the greenest of fingers, honed by the knowledge and experience handed down by
his predecessors in Italy.
In recent years, he bore with great fortitude and dignity the intense pain of
seeing the beloved business that he and his brothers had spent so much time and
energy developing, fall apart so badly.
He was clever, always elegantly dressed, and a gentleman of the old school with
solid old-fashioned values. He is survived by his wife and three sons and one
daughter.

CHRISTMAS comes but once a year and when it comes - how the heart sinks at the
prospect - it brings with it the Christmas movies, those seasonal tales with
which each distributor trys to secure the biggest share of the seasonal
box-office jackpot. They are invariably drenched in whimsy, smothered in
treacle, bedecked with fake snow, and feature some old ham in red with false
whiskers going ``Ho, ho, ho''.
This year, however, the first to appear is a delight, a fresh, inventive, witty
tale which manages, without spoiling the myth, to reassure the doubtful that
Santa Claus exists, while making clear he is, of course, really Daddy. Directed
by John Pasquin, The Santa Clause tells how Scott Calvin (Tim Allen), a
divorced parent, is outraged when his ex-wife (Wendy Crewson) brings their
small son Charlie (Eric Lloyd) over to spend Christmas Eve with him, only to
find she and her new husband, a psychiatrist (Judge Reinhold, wonderfully
nerdish) have told the moppet Santa does not exist.
Not that Scott believes in Santa either. He just hates his ex-wife's new
husband, a pompous psychiatrist with terrible taste in seasonal sweaters. In
the middle of the night there is a bump on the roof, and when Scott and Charlie
investigate they disturb a stout old party in red about to climb down the
chimney.
Losing his footing, Santa Claus, for it is he, falls into a snowdrift and is
knocked out. Scott rummages in his pockets to find some I D and extracts a card
which he reads, but neglects to study the small print. The body in the snow
drift disappears, and Scott and Charlie find they have been landed with
delivering the presents in Santa's place. There is nothing for it but to get in
his sleigh, still on the roof, and let the reindeer do the flying. When they
end up at the North Pole a bolshie elf called Bernard reveals the clause in
question. Scott has inherited the job of Santa and has until next Thanksgiving
to put his affairs in order.
What happens next? Go and see, because this truly is film for the entire
family. Leo Benvenuti and Steve Rudnick's script is blissfully sharp. When
Scott finds himself flying through the air, suspended from Santa's bag of toys
which acts as a balloon, Charlie cries - ``You're flying.''
``It's OK, I'm used to it. I lived through the sixties,'' Scott replies.
Erik Lloyd is an endearing Charlie, his loyalties divided between his parents,
and Reinhold makes the most of an unsympathetic role. But the film's mainstay
is Tim Allen, star of the TV sitcom Home Improvement, in a wry, charming, and
nicely prickly film debut.
Maybe the film does ignore the fact that Christmas is about more than Santa
Claus and toys, but its heart is in the right place since it is, at the least,
about a dysfunctional family getting its act together.
Shown at this year's Edinburgh Film Festival Antonia Bird's Mad Love, her
Hollywood debut as director, is a dire tale written by Paula Milne about a
young voyeur (Chris O'Donnell) who falls in love with the girl across the lake
(Drew Barrymore) whom he spies on while she is skinny dipping.
He is so besotted that the fact she is barking mad escapes his notice and the
pair run away from home. Eventually it penetrates his thick, albeit pretty,
head that she is a danger to herself and everyone else, so they go home. Not a
moment too soon.
We are back in the world of Warners with Murder in the First, a stylishly
directed piece about the awful regime in Alcatraz. On his release, Kevin Bacon,
kept in solitary confinement for three years for trying to escape, murders the
convict he believes betrayed the escape attempt. Christian Slater is the brash
attorney on his first case defending him, and Gary Oldman the sadistic warden.
The three stars act for all they are worth, the horrors of the Hole are
unsparingly shown and the courtroom scenes are gripping. But Alcatraz has long
since closed and Marc Rocco's film, although based on a true story, says
nothing that has not been said many times before about a penal system gone
wrong.
A sense of deja vu also hangs over Scott Kalvert's The Basketball Diaries,
another true story, which tells how Jim Carroll (Leonardo DiCaprio), a good
Catholic boy, became a junkie, not a basketball star, and went to hell and
back, only saved by the diary he had kept.
Carroll's literary talent was recognised and he ended up both a celebrated
writer and an off-Broadway performer. Kalvert lingers too long on his
degradation, and scampers over the really interesting stuff - how his
redemption came about.
DiCaprio, however, gives a blazingly good performance, confirming he is one of
the best young actors in Hollywood today. As for Candyman: Farewell to the
Flesh, we are back with the ghostly slave with a hook for a hand who
disembowels his victims, this time in New Orleans where, as Noel Coward said,
the wrought-iron screens are frightfully overwrought. So is the film.

CAN this be it? The Secretary of State for Scotland was obliged to go to the
House yesterday and give some explanation of his plans for the governance of
Scotland, at least inasmuch as they would affect the workings of Parliament at
Westminster. This was the first instalment of the fruits of Mr Forsyth's
thinking on the subject in recent months and it did not amount to much. Nor was
it intended to. It is inconceivable that a man of the energy and subtlety of Mr
Forsyth would choose to make as little of the 15 or so months left to him in
office as was represented by his statement in the House yesterday. Therefore it
is possible that we will soon hear more than is contained in this mousy effort.
There were interesting bits to it, of course. The Scottish Grand Committee is
to be beefed up to enable Scottish MPs to have more power over legislation
affecting Scotland. The second and third readings of Scottish Bills would be
heard in the Grand Committee, but only when it makes sense to do so. What is
meant by that enigmatic phrase is anybody's guess but at the very least it
signals the utter determination of the Secretary of State for Scotland to
exercise control over everything within reach.
A Special Standing Committee is proposed so that professional bodies and
interest groups in Scotland may have more of the sort of access to the
formative stage of proposed legislation which is at present enjoyed by their
counterparts in England. This sounds more promising and if it permits the great
and the good of Scotland to let off some steam, so much the better. We must
not, however, pretend that it will have any great significance in the manner in
which the Government goes about its business. Requiring the presence of the
Prime Minister, the Chancellor, and other Ministers to explain Scottish policy
is significant, though it could be argued as little more than a sop to vanity.
It is clear that Mr Forsyth's way with things is very much a matter of smoke
and mirrors. Budget day found him enthusing over the highest ever cash-terms
increase in next year's allocation for Scotland. As we point out elsewhere in
this newspaper this morning the reality is somewhat different. In real terms
the budget allocation for the Scottish Office has been cut by #239m next year
and by 1998-99 the cut, again in real terms, will have risen further. The
heavily trailed suggestion that Mr Forsyth will give back to the new unitary
authorities many of the powers which were taken from the old authorities is
intriguing, but how can it sit comfortably with Mr Forsyth's determination to
retain powers to cap local authority spending and the measures to force
councils next year to curtail their capital expenditure to force the
establishment of joint ventures with the widely disregarded Private Finance
Initiative?
There must be more to Taking Stock Mark Two than this. But what? Mr Forsyth may
be content to believe that strengthening the Scottish Grand Committee will
allow him to argue that it will thereby have every function proposed by the
Opposition for a devolved parliament, except for tax-raising powers. He might
hope to use this to drive a wedge between Labour devolutionists and those in
the party who are doubtful, but the power to raise tax and to enact relevant
legislation is what makes the difference. Some Scots Tories, notably Sir
Michael Hirst, have spoken in recent days of a referendum on devolution. Could
this be Mr Forsyth's bombshell for today? If it is he is a wilder gambler than
we had thought.

Actress Joan Francis, an original member of the Coronation Street cast, has
died after a long illness at the age of 75.
JOAN FRANCIS played Dot Greenhalgh - Elsie Tanner's best friend and fellow
good-time girl - in 83 episodes of the TV soap, Coronation Street, from 1961 to
1969. She had been born into a theatrical family and appeared in plays,
pantomimes, musicals, and revue before going into television.
She originally auditioned for the part of Street siren Elsie Tanner but was
offered Dot instead. Her final scenes in the show were in a dramatic court case
where she let Elsie take the blame for some dresses Dot had stolen. Elsie was
let off but Dot had to leave the street.
In a racy plot for the 1960s, Dot and Elsie, played by Pat Pheonix, returned in
1967 to the American air base at Burtonwood where they had ``entertained'' the
Yanks during the war to rekindle old flames. Elsie ended up marrying Steve
Tanner and Dot's husband threw her out when he discovered her affair with a GI.
Francis retired from acting in the 1980s because of ill health. She suffered a
stroke seven years ago from which she never recovered and died in a South
Manchester nursing home after developing a chest infection.

SCOTTISH cricket has lost top umpire Hector Blackburn who died suddenly
yesterday at the age of 52. Mr Blackburn was one of the most respected
officials in the game and had been on the SCU's international panel for several
years.
SCU Chairman Chris Carruthers said: ``It's difficult to reminisce about Hector
without talking in cliches. But he was, quite simply, the most respected umpire
in the country. He would have been a strong front runner to represent Scotland
at the Mini World Cup in Malaysia in 1997.''
Mr Blackburn, who underwent a serious heart operation in September, officiated
at Scotland's friendly match against the West Indies last June. SCU general
manager Alex Ritchie revealed: ``Hector knew he was due to go into hospital for
a bypass, but he told his doctor in no uncertain terms that he wouldn't have
the operation until he'd stood in the Windies game. It was the highlight of his
career.''
The death of Scotland's top umpire follows the loss of the chairman of the
selectors, Hugh Stevenson, in August. Mr Blackburn's funeral will take place in
Bannockburn tomorrow.

James Houston Henderson, a solicitor with one of Dumfries's oldest family
firms, died at home after a long illness, aged 88.
JAMES Houston Henderson, was born in Dumfries and educated at Dumfries Academy,
Fettes College, and Edinburgh University where he was a rugby blue. He
graduated as a Bachelor of Law.
In 1931 he joined the firm of John Henderson and Sons which had been founded by
his grandfather and remained there until he was 80, with a break for war
service.
During the war he served as an officer with the 5th Battalion of the King's Own
Scottish Borderers and won the Military Cross in Holland. He was always
reluctant to talk about this heroic episode and even his own family did not
know the details. He left the Army with the rank of major and later served with
the TA.
Mr Henderson was a well known and highly respected member of the Dumfries legal
fraternity. He was secretary to Dumfries Savings Bank, clerk to the
Comissioners of Inland Revenue, and an honorary sheriff-substitute. He was also
a Rotarian and keen bridge player.
His wife Doreen died in 1986 and he is survived by his sons, David and John,
and daughter, Elizabeth. John has followed him into the family business.

Stuart Henry, disc jockey; born February 24, 1942, died November 24, 1995.
MY first memory of Stuart Henry was of a jaunty nautical figure holding court
in a tavern in Dunbar shortly before Radio Scotland, the ship, was due to go on
air in 1966. There was the cap at the perfect angle, the shoulder-length hair,
but, above all, those glowing eyes which seemed to tell you that life could be
fun.
While he could do the shiver-me-timbers bit to perfection, having trained as an
actor at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama, Glasgow, he couldn't
cope with the ocean waves. Which was why he was to be dubbed ``the seasick
pirate.''
He was given a rare dispensation to be a landlubber pirate DJ, recording his
bits from the the rock-steady studio in Cranworth Street beside Byres Road in
Glasgow. While still at sea he had been so popular they couldn't do without
him. No-one listening realised that his most essential piece of broadcasting
equipment was the bucket.
The rusty old tub, MV Comet, stripped of its engine, started broadcasting on
January 1, 1966. Then, because the signal was not getting through strongly
enough to the West of Scotland, it was towed to a point off the Ayrshire coast
near Troon. Fellow pirates included Paul Young who had been at drama college
with Stuart.
Another was Tony Meehan who recalls that Henry was the complete professional
who would let nothing - not even sea sickness - prevent him doing his bit as he
felt it had to be done.
With the scuppering of Radio Scotland through the Marine Offences Act, Stuart
helped launch Radio 1, and became the most popular DJ in Britain with a Sunday
morning audience of more than 11 million. With his kaftans, long hair, and
droopy moustache he was in complete contrast to the traditional BBC DJs in
suits - more a product of the Flower Power generation.
In his Scottish accent he would address: ``Ma friends . . .'' He began to slur
his words on air, seemed clumsy off. The BBC management thought that this was
due to drink or drugs, not realising it was the start of the multiple sclerosis
that was to cripple him.
He was fired in 1974 but went on to Radio Luxembourg where he met his wife
Ollie who helped him continue broadcasting until 1987. It was in Luxembourg
that I met him again, in the early eighties. Nothing about his personality had
changed. There was still the kindness behind those eyes, the sensitivity, and
the love of music.
He was getting around on two walking sticks but he was still able to drive me
back to his house outside the town for dinner. At one point he lost balance,
and fell on the floor. He was immediately back on his feet again, talking
animatedly as though nothing had happened. He was a gentleman of great style.

THE lights in Edinburgh's public buildings will be switched off at 5pm tomorrow
for a period equivalent to one second for everyone in Scotland who has died
from Aids.
The gesture - one of the ways in which the capital is marking World Aids Day -
will demonstrate a grim statistic. Last year the lights were off for six
minutes. This year it will be 10 minutes and 10 seconds. And the worst is yet
to come.
``The majority of deaths from Aids are still ahead of us,'' Dr James Inglis,
consultant in public health medicine with the Health Education Board for
Scotland, warned yesterday.
With 10 years the typical time-lag between infection and death, what we are
reaping now follows the explosion of HIV infection in the mid-1980s.
``There have been 600 deaths in Scotland to date and there will be at least as
many, if not more, in the next few years,'' said Dr Inglis.
``Hopefully the death rate will fall away again after 1997, when our success in
reining in the spread of infection starts to show.''
Complacency, however, could undo this work, a report prepared by Dr Inglis and
his colleagues points out. Building on Good Practice catalogues the 800
prevention initiatives being carried out from Shetland to the Borders. One of
the statistics they came up with for the report which set them back on their
heels was the discovery that one-in-500 Scots males in the 15-44 age group is
now infected.
``That is a significant proportion of the sexually active population,'' said Dr
Inglis. ``When we were working it out it took us by surprise. We had to check
our arithmetic, and the epidemiologists at the Scottish Office went over it.
``In Edinburgh the figure is as high as one in 100. Most people will now know
someone who has HIV.''
Of particular concern is the inroads HIV is making into the community at large.
It can no longer be dismissed as a disease of gays or drug addicts.
More than a quarter of those who tested HIV positive last year became infected
through heterosexual contact - for HEBS the first priority for prevention
campaigns is now the first priority for prevention.
Other Aids facts:
n-The World Health Organisation estimates that 18.5m people, including 1.5m
children, are infected. Two million of these infections took place last year
alone.
n-The number of people known to be infected in Scotland is 2000, but the true
figure is thought to be double that.
n-Deaths from Aids last year were double that of the previous year.
n-Over the past eight years new infections have averaged 150 a year. That is
less reassuring than it may sound, for two reasons, said Dr Inglis: There has
been a dramatic decline in the number of new infections among IV drug users;
and there is no sign of a downward turn in new infections.
He explained: ``Normally an infectious disease peaks and then fades. There is
no indication of a downward trend and modest evidence of a slight creep
upwards. This increases the prevalence in the population, even though people
are dying from the disease.
``It is in many respects the fastest-moving epidemic we have seen. The virus
could change and become more lethal, or become more easily transmissable. Flu
can alter its characteristics and HIV is even trickier.
``The message has to be continuous, and it has to adapt to the style that will
reach each wave of young people reaching sexual maturity.''
For all the warnings, people travelling abroad still appear to be indulging in
unprotected sex. Dr Graham Hart, who works for the MRC Medical Sociology Unit
at Glasgow University, discovered in a survey of 400 people who had travelled
abroad within the previous three months that one in four had sex with a new
partner during the trip, and two-thirds claimed they had never, or
inconsistently, used a condom.
Since the 400 were all patients at a genito-urinary medicine clinic in London,
Dr Hart is first to acknowledge that they are not entirely representative. It
is the kind of place you would expect to find the victims of sexual
indiscretion.
But he points out in a re-search journal, Genitourinary Medicine, that between
30 and 40 million overseas visits are made by the British every year, so his
sample doesn't have to be all that near the mark to show a major potential for
the spread of infection.
``We need targeted health education for men and women who are sexually active -
whether this is prior to, during or after recent travel. In particular, single
men travelling alone should be considered a major risk group in terms of sexual
behaviour risk and travel.''

THE year's remembrance of the Second World War is drawing to a close, and the
reliving of victory has often overshadowed commemoration of the faceless
millions killed by the Nazi holocaust.
Hence the importance of the exhibition opening tomorrow at Edinburgh City Art
Centre which asks, and answers, one question: can art come out of the horrors
of Auschwitz?
Inspired by the words of the philosopher Theodor Adorno, who claimed that
``after Auschwitz there can be no poetry'', curator Monica Bohm-Duchen has
assembled the works of a variety of artists who are intent on creating art that
is relevant, that explores the nature of memory and loss without trivialising
the truth of what happened.
The exhibition opened in London, where journalist and author Rabbi Hugo Gryn,
himself a camp survivor, said Adorno was wrong: ``It's not true. There's art
and there's poetry and there's music. Look at these images, engrave them on
your hearts, tell them to your children and see to it that it is never ever
repeated.''
The work ranges from the disturbing architectural drawings of Melvin Charney to
the moving installations of Shimon Attie, in which photographic images of
pre-war German-Jewish street life are projected onto their original locations.
Also included in the exhibition is a series of black and white photographs by
the German artist Henning Langenheim, whose ongoing Memorials project aims to
document the known and unknown holocaust sites.
His work was partly set off by the shock of discovering that the Berlin
wasteland he had commuted past every day was once the Gestapo headquarters from
where the murder was managed.
n After Auschwitz: Responses to the Holocaust in Contemporary Arts, is at
Edinburgh City Arts Centre, Market Street, until January 20. A programme of
readings, lectures, and lunchtime videos accompanies the show.

IF lawyers are feeling slightly paranoid at the moment it is probably because
everyone really is out to get them. Five judges in the Court of Criminal Appeal
will rule tomorrow on whether incompetent legal representation during a trial
can amount to a miscarriage of justice and provide a good ground for setting
aside a conviction.
And a leading Queen's Counsel was recently sued unsuccessfully for #150,000 in
Edinburgh Sheriff Court in a civil case in which it was alleged he had been
guilty of professional negligence.
The current law in criminal cases was laid down in the case of McCaroll in 1949
when a man charged with theft by housebreaking claimed his solicitor had failed
to ensure he received a fair trial.
The allegation was he had not competently cross-examined Crown witnesses and
that the defence case had not been properly placed before the jury. However,
the Court of Criminal Appeal ruled that lack of skill or diligence in the
preparation or conduct of a defence could not be pled as a basis for claiming a
miscarriage of justice.
Five judges, headed by Lord Justice General Hope, have been pondering whether,
nearly 50 years on, that can still be regarded as good law.
It is easy enough to see the rationale behind the 1949 decision. In court cases
there is always a loser unhappy with the outcome, particularly when he has been
convicted and sent to jail. It is easy to blame your lawyer even although he
might have done his best and the case was a no-hoper from the start.
In the middle of a court case lawyers also have to think on their feet as
evidence develops and it is easy with hindsight to say a certain question
should have been put or not put to a particular witness at a particular time.
Does the fact that it wasn't make the lawyer incompetent?
To suggest that the conduct of criminal trials by counsel (and solicitor
advocates) should not be open to scrutiny would leave Scotland out of line with
other legal systems which already allow an appeal on the grounds of incompetent
legal representation.
Appeal judges in England have indicated that an appeal would be competent where
counsel had taken a decision during a trial in defiance of or without proper
instructions ``when all promptings of reason and good sense pointed the other
way''.
Lawyers are naturally concerned the floodgates will open and every convicted
person with a grudge will be heading straight back to court no matter how well
their case was conducted. They are also afraid that trials could drag on
interminably with counsel having to safeguard themselves by getting
instructions in writing every time a major tactical decision has to be made.
The appeal court would obviously have to lay down extremely strict guidelines
within which any new rules would operate.
Mr Graham Bell QC, who appeared before the five judges to argue a change in the
law, suggested an appeal should be allowed where incompetent legal
representation had resulted in a accused person's defence not being properly
presented to the court.
The court would have to be satisfied that the defence in question was
important, likely to have had a significant bearing on the decision of the jury
and a miscarriage of justice had occurred.
One factor which may help persuade the judges to change the law is that,
whereas in 1949 the only option was to quash a conviction and allow a convicted
man to walk free, Scots law can now allow a retrial following a successful
appeal.
In the sphere of civil law, doctors, architects, surveyors, and other
professional people (including solicitors) can be sued for negligence if their
work does not meet the standards expected of an ordinary member of the
profession exercising reasonable care.
A solicitor could be held liable if he pursued a case under the wrong Act of
Parliament or failed to raise a damages action within the three-year time
limit. Since the last century, however, the received wisdom has been that
counsel cannot be sued for negligence for work done and advice tendered in
connection with a court case.
This immunity was based on the absence of any contract between advocate and
client (unlike the solicitor/client relationship) and the fact that counsel
owes a duty not just to his client but to the court and the public. These
duties may sometimes conflict.
The authority for stating advocates are an exception to the normal rule is the
1876 case of Batchelor v Pattison and Mackersy in which damages were claimed
against counsel for alleged professional negligence and disregard of
instructions.
Lord President Inglis said: ``The nature of the advocate's office makes it
clear that in the performance of his duty he must be entirely independent and
act according to his own discretion and judgment in the conduct of the cause
for his client.
``What he does bona fide according to his own judgment ..... will not expose
him to any action for what he has done, even if the client's interests are
thereby prejudiced.''
In the recent sheriff court case in which Mr Christopher Haddow QC was sued for
#150,000 it was argued that the modern trend in the law of negligence was
against the views expressed in Batchelor.
Mr Gordon Nicholson QC, sheriff principal of Lothian and Borders, expressed
sympathy with that viewpoint, saying: ``I think the time may have come when the
decision in Batchelor ought to be reviewed to see whether it still properly
reflects what ought to be the position of an advocate in relation to claims of
professional negligence.
``I have little difficulty in holding that, apart from the restriction imposed
by the case of Batchelor, an advocate must be under a duty to take care not to
act negligently in respect of his actings on behalf of his client.''
There have been a number of English cases in the House of Lords in the past 25
years which suggest strongly that the scope of counsel's immunity has narrowed
considerably since last century and may no longer include, for example, written
work unconnected with court proceedings.
The modern cases were put to Sheriff Nicholson but the sheriff principal said
he had no option but to follow the 1876 decision which was binding on him and
still seems to be the law in Scotland.
As he suggested, however, it is perhaps time the situation in Scotland is
reviewed by an authoritative decision of the Court of Session.
A restatement of the law might even be welcomed by advocates who are no doubt
wise to take out insurance cover for negligence, rather than rely on the
increasingly fragile protection of a case that is 120 years old.

AS I read John Macleod's Faithful daughter of Mother Church (November 28) and
Ruth Wishart's fanciful redesigning of the role of Pope John II (November 27),
I was reminded of a recent Channel 4 quasi-religious programme cobbled together
by Kirsty Wark's TV company.
Before us an Orangeman, also flushed with the desire to free Catholics from
error, cut a morning roll in two; he then switched the halves around at speed
on a worktop, posed a rhetorical question, and, as the camera closed in,
declared the doctrine of transubstantiation to be false.
These three, John Macleod, Ruth Wishart, and the Orangeman, illustrate the
distinction which St Thomas Aquinas makes concerning the state of not-knowing.
The Orangeman's lack of knowledge can be called ``nescience'' since he is not
expected to know; his interests lie elsewhere. To Ruth Wishart's and John
MacLeod's lack of knowledge, however, must be applied the term ``ignorance''
since they write professionally on a subject of their own choice.
Because of the contrived gravitas of John Macleod's work it is not unreasonable
to describe his ignorance as being culpable. He wallows in it; it leads him to
vilify persons and to see evil where there is none.
Your readers, interested in accuracy or even fairness, can correct the
misinformation of these two Herald articles by referring to Catechism of the
Catholic Church and The Code of Canon Law in the public library. Therein they
will find a full description of the sacrament of matrimony, the office of Roman
Pontiff, and the nature of the Catholic Church itself.
Finally, Catholics rightly distance themselves from the frequent distortions of
their faith expressed in The Herald by a remarkably significant number of
feature writers and they wonder why contributions by Catholics, as a rule, are
relegated to the letters section. A statement of The Herald's policy might
clarify, or even justify, this phenomenon.

FOR once, I find some sympathy for that theatre pest, the sweetie-paper
rustler. He was probably making an inarticulate protest, doing it deliberately
to annoy Marcella Evaristi (Weekend Extra, November 18).
Why? Because, by her own (first-sentence) admission, she's an even bigger pest
- the balcony ``hing-er''.
These selfish, inconsiderate people, not content with an uninterrupted view of
the stage, stick their great elbows on the ``velvety balcony'' and do a Glesca
``hing'', thereby blocking out 50% of the stage from the view of the
unfortunate person behind.
That person has then to duck and weave to see the action - and everyone behind
him has to do the same. The sweetie merchant, instead of a cowardly rustling,
should have tapped Marcella Evaristi and asked her, politely, to sit properly
and not be so thoughtless.

<TEXT>
HAVING just returned from a windsurfing holiday I was most interested in the
debate regarding windsurfing in Tiree. In the light of your study of tourism in
Scotland it seemed particularly pertinent.
I took up windsurfing some seven years ago, was introduced to Tiree by friends,
and have returned 12 times since then. I doubt that I would ever had gone there
but for windsurfing.
A distinction should be made between the people who attend the ``Wave Classic''
and the ordinary windsurfing tourist. Most of the competitors in the former are
young, male, single, and poor.
Neither windsurfing nor surfing are rich sports. Most ``pros'' live a
hand-to-mouth existence. It is no wonder that they are not big spenders. (I met
two competitors at Machrihanish some years ago whose supplies consisted of a
loaf of pan bread.)
But these people are not typical of the regular windsurfing tourist, as many
people of the island noted in their replies to a recent survey of attitudes to
windsurfers and reported in An Tirisdeach.
When my wife and I were on the island in the last week of September (hardly
peak tourist time) we were part of a group of people which included an actuary
and an engineer (the two ``pan loaf boys'', now somewhat older and wealthier),
two lawyers, a restaurateur, a Spanish factory owner, a PhD lecturer, a
surgeon, and a doctor. All the kind of tourists that most destinations would
roll over and beg for.
All of these people are in love with the island but would not be there but for
their love of the sport.
My own cottage, five people in all, ate out at the Tiree Lodge twice (#100),
spent #40 in the butchers, #110 in the Co-op, and #35 at the petrol station.
Not the biggest tourist spend in the world but from my observation of people in
the windsurfing resort of El Medano in Tenerife last week, about the same as
the tourists (windsurfing or not) in self-catering accomodation there.
These people will be visiting Tiree for the rest of their lives. To categorise
them as second-class tourists is a mistake.
The tensions between tourism and agriculture are not unique to Tiree but common
to all of the world that is a tourist destination. It was only natural that
some individuals in any community will suffer from increasing tourism while
others will gain.
I sympathise with the farmer whose land lies next to ``The Green'' but hope
that the local council could provide some way of recompensing him for the loss
of any productive land.
Certainly I know of no windsurfer who would not be willing to pay a small tax
to help pay for maintenance of tracks and ways. One of the problems is that
there are almost no signs whatsoever as to how to gain access to the relevant
beaches.
On behalf of the many passionate admirers of Tiree and its people I would ask
for understanding on all sides.

LIKE Sir Bruce Pattullo, Governor of the Bank of Scotland, I too ``have no time
whatsoever'' for certain ideas, in my case for his dismissive views on
devolution or, for that matter, on economics (November 28).
The banking world is well-practised in looking after itself, and Sir Bruce and
his ``personal opinion'' are part of an outdated but powerful monetary system
which plays havoc with the human condition, and for which there is abundant
global evidence.
Enlightenment has to start somewhere and it might as well be here. If
responsibility and self-respect can be excited by devolution, then why not? Our
proven capacity for compassion and analysis is instanced by the real wealth of
Adam Smith's Moral Sentiments, but ignored by bankers in favour of an
avaricious over-emphasis on his Wealth of Nations.
Smith, of course, was not an economist but a moral philosopher, which probably
makes his own favourite treatise, the Moral Sentiments, ``romantic'' and
therefore an ``on-cost''.

IN his letter Norman Hogg states, ``The hard fact is the Scots do not support
the SNP in anything like the numbers that would make them a viable choice at
the next election'' (November 28).
If the 30% of Scots who do support the SNP does not make them a ``viable
choice'', should Norman Hogg not be questioning our so-called democracy? What
percentage of the vote does a party need before it becomes ``viable''?

WITH reference to Mr John Butterfill, MP for Bournemouth West, who wants to
change to Central European Time, I find his use of road safety as a vehicle to
do this quite distressing (November 24).
The Government already tried this experiment between 1966 and 1969 and while it
is true there was a reduction of accidents involving school children in the
afternoon, there was, however, sadly an increase of accidents to them in the
mornings, an increase of 1% overall.
There was a lot less traffic then, moving a lot more slowly than traffic on our
roads today.
Do not be misled by Mr Butterfill's words or by businessmen who want the
convenience of having their lunch at the same time as their counterparts in
Europe. It is up to all of us to protect our young and vulnerable road users.
After all, if a country the size of America can manage with eight different
time zones then surely Britain can cope with Europe as it is.

DURING a recent holiday in Spain I noticed crisp, new 1000-peseta banknotes in
circulation. Half expecting to see Juan Carlos or some other member of the
Spanish monarchy, I was shocked instead to find portraits of Hernan Cortes and
Francisco Pizarro, butchers of the Aztec and Inca peoples respectively, given
pride of place.
Notwithstanding the obvious insult to the indigenous population of Latin
America, is this the only currency in contemporary Europe that honours the

SOME three months ago John Macleod was at great pains to denounce Catholicism
for the sensual roundness of its association with neo-paganism. Now he
castigates it for the angular intransigence of its fundamentalism in its stand
against divorce (November 28).
While I admit that the church is currently in bad shape nothing can be so
malformed as all that and hope to survive.
John Macleod informs us that the prohibition of divorce was ``against scripture
itself'' but the Master tells us that it was only allowed by Moses ``because of
the hardness of their hearts''.
The more things change the more they remain the same.
He will find cold comfort too in the Old Testament. For it says somewhere
``Thou shalt not commit adultery,'' and again ``Thou shalt not covet thy
neighbour's wife'' - thus gainsaying two overwhelming reasons for separation.
The apostles' counsel that it was ``better not to marry'' if divorce was not
allowed implies the fundamental change brought about by Christ. And to the
Christian it is the will of Christ that matters.
Therefore, despite the times, it is the function of the Church to ``preach the
good news in season and out of season and welcome or unwelcome to insist upon
it''. Come hell or high water or referendum.
Historically the unification of Church and State has brought nothing but
trouble into religious affairs. Eire is no exception. And there is always the
bright side. Their separation in Ireland should be a great stride towards
eventual political unification of that sad land.
But I doubt if the myopic will see it thus.

IN your editorial on November 15, concerning Bishop Holloway's opinions, you
rightly exposed the dangers involved in assuming that there is no such thing as
a moral absolute.
Before the Second Vatican Council, Ireland, and some other predominantly
Catholic nations, sought to enshrine such moral absolutes in their laws. They
considered the enshrining in law of these absolutes necessary to secure the
common good - which does not always correspond with the desires of individuals.
Alas, the gradual and sustained pressure of liberals and secularists has
removed almost every vestige of moral absolutes from the laws of these
societies, and many acts once thought heinous and destructive of social life
are now accorded as ``rights''.
The ever-increasing toll of ``easy'' divorce, broken homes, abortions, and the
looming and inevitable lurch towards compulsory euthanasia in our own country
bear witness to this abandonment of moral absolutes. Your observation that
``Societies and the way they interpret morals change; it is still wrong to
kill'' is of little comfort to aborted children.
That the Irish have chosen to take the first faltering steps on this Gadarene
slope to secularism gives comfort only to those who seek the final separation
of Church and State in Ireland. They will remain dissatisfied until the
American model is replicated in Ireland - a model which forbids children to say
prayers in state-funded schools.
John Macleod (November 28) berates Catholics in Ireland for enforcing their
morality on Irish Protestants and does so, smugly, as if liberal British
society does not force its amorality on its Catholic and Protestant citizens.
Through taxes we are forced to contribute to the killing of countless unborn
children, and we must also pay for the immense expense arising from the
consequences of divorce.
John Macleod, a closet secularist, will in true liberal style only tolerate
Catholics and some Protestants (because he doesn't even like some of them)
provided they accept the liberal model of society; a society in which the only
moral absolute is that there are no moral absolutes.

WJACK Webster, that most lucid and reasonable of columnists, comments (November

performance on Panorama. This does not appear to be a popular view but I
entirely agree with him.
Also, the ill-considered, albeit honest, comments on Diana by Nicholas Soames,
for which he has been duly caned, were at least made during a live programme in
contrast with the carefully rehearsed (17 hours of filming reduced to one hour)
Panorama broadcast which many people regarded as live and spontaneous.

WHY is it that some people often begin a dialogue by displaying their stupidity
in all its glory and then spend the next 10 paragraphs or so trying to convince
us that they really do know a bit after all? In Ruth Wishart's case I'm sure
she does this completely unawares.
In her article about how ``Divorce can offer mixed blessings'' (November 27),
in the first column she points out ``it should not be the business of . . . the
Polish Pontiff to dicate to the men and women of Ireland''.
That seems to me a bit like saying it's not the place of a writer to write or
an artist to paint. As leader of the Catholic world, the Holy Father is only
performing his task as shepherd to the flock.
The next four columns were very positive and indeed sensible. It always
surprises me when I see good sense and great stupidity lying side by side.

A COUPLE of weeks ago the star of Braveheart and Hamlet collapsed at the end of
a day's rehearsal and was rushed to hospital. No, not that star. It was an
overworked and underfed Jimmy Chisholm, who plays alongside wee Mel in the
Wallace movie, who took a dizzy turn only a couple of hours before he was due
to go on stage in the Royal Lyceum's Caucasian Chalk Circle.
He would be back on typically ebullient form in time for the opening night of
the same company's Hamlet the following week.
However, for two nights the Edinburgh theatre was short of one actor in
Brecht's technically complicated show in which everybody was to play several
parts.
By chance, I was in the theatre that night and saw the company sail
effortlessly through, substituting artistic director Kenny Ireland (who was
word perfect, despite having less than two hours notice) and a
clipboard-carrying Tom McGovern (who, as the lead in Hamlet, surely had other
things on his mind).
Were it not for a pre-show apology, the audience might never have noticed
anything was up.
That the show must go on is theatrical lore, but that this show went on so
smoothly is testament to the way this past season has been organised at the
Lyceum.
Starting with Timberlake Wertenbaker's Our Country's Good, the theatre has
employed a core of around ten actors who stayed on first for Caucasian Chalk
Circle and then for Hamlet (which finishes on Saturday).
Apart from Pitlochry Festival Theatre, which operates such a system as a matter
of course, it's a surprisingly rare way to run a season - surprising, because
the benefits are all too apparent.
Agreeing to perform even when a key actor was absent is a prime example.
``At six o'clock we didn't know whether the show was going to go on or not,''
says Ann Louise Ross, who played Gertrude in Hamlet, several characters in the
other two, and will be back for The Steamie in January. ``We decided we could
do it and that was because we all felt secure with each other.''
It's a factor outsiders don't consider, but quite apart from the business of
acting, actors need time to settle in, just like anyone does in the first days
of a job.
Even being in work in the first place can take some getting used to if, like
most actors, you've just been unemployed. The company system bypasses these
distractions.
``It normally takes about a week to get to know people and that eats into
rehearsal time,'' says Ross. ``You don't know how a person works. Whether
they're quick or slow, you have to make allowances for each other.
``By the time we got to the read-through for Hamlet there was a relaxed feeling
because we all knew each other and how we worked.''
Audiences benefit too. It's not just that they appreciate the ensemble spirit,
it's also that they enjoy recognising actors and seeing them tackle a variety
of roles over a short period. And that variety is all the more broad when the
theatre, having to work with the same group of actors, is forced to break the
tyranny of typecasting.
It was no surprise, for example, to see Louise Ironside playing a convict in
Our Country's Good, but until now, who would have imagined her as Ophelia? It
is our good fortune somebody did.
``It was an excellent experiment,'' says Ireland, who is already trying to
through-cast for the spring season, although practical constraints are likely
to stop him repeating the full fixed-company model for some time.
``If you have a daunting task like doing Hamlet, any other company would have
had at least four weeks rehearsal. This is a practical solution. It means you
don't lose two or three days with them getting to know each other, you don't
lose two or three days when they're scared to show their performance. Everyone
dives in at the deep end.''
The system creates a sense of security that has both simple practical benefits
- Ross talks about the pleasure of getting to know the acoustic properties of
the auditorium, allowing her to develop a more subtle vocal range - and
aesthetic benefits because egos no longer come before the play.
``If you are an actor or a director doing the one show every so often, you have
to impress,'' says Ireland. ``In an ensemble company everybody knows they've
got a body of work to show themselves off, so you wouldn't do Hamlet in
hot-pants set in the 60s just to prove what a wonderful director you were, or
have Ophelia defecating on the stage just to prove how clever an actress she
was.''
The result has been a highly satisfying season of large-cast plays that have
stretched the theatre's technical resources and proved a hit with audiences.
When the company takes its final bow on Saturday night, it will be with a
thoroughly well-deserved sense of achievement.

CLICH is the crime of our era. You may squeak by on adultery, sleaze, or
incompetence, but talk in cliche and a rabble of commentators and parvenus will
be clamouring with their wet sponges. Damn your opponent with a just charge of
cliche, and you have, ipso facto, won the argument.
The modern clichephobia is, like all cultural phobias, revealing of the
malformations and hang-ups of its time. It is sustained by a sloppy taxonomy.
At least five different kinds of semantic phenomena or social belief are
designated by the word ``cliche''. Clichephobes are unreceptive to the
differences, and therefore respond with enthusiastic but premature lack of
discrimination.
The first class of cliche is the ritual locution, expressive of a stance which
no-one, including the utterer, really endorses or is thought to endorse, the
purpose of which is evasion or obfuscation. Ask a football manager topping the
league in December if he thinks his team can win the title, and the questioner
is liable to be told that the club policy is one game at a time. No one
believes that this is ingenuous; the management, players, and fans are
excitedly contemplating the entire championship, and it would be a myopic
management, in fact, who considered only the next match. Similarly, sceptical
eyes are cast upon the exposed politician who claims he doesn't consider
hypothetical questions. Everyone knows political life, and any kind of valuable
human life, would be impossible without consideration of unactualised
possibilities.
The second kind of cliche is the ground-floor truth, belief, or assumption with
which someone might begin a discussion, for example: Turkey is the bridge
between East and West; women are historically subjugated; we live nowadays in a
global village. This class differs from the first, inasmuch as utterance is
generally believed ingenuous, and audience acceptance is usually universal.
Every business has its jargon, and this blameless fact underwrites the third
species of cliche. Reality is repetitive, and jargon mirrors this feature in
its own repetition. But modern clichephobes find this natural repetition
risible. Woe betide the football journalist sufficiently callow to report he
saw a ``game of two halves'', even if the regular pattern of match for which
the expression was coined is in fact witnessed by the scribe.
The fourth class displays comfortable and lazy folk-wisdom. It is a revealing
fact that some members of this class are seldom properly articulated,
subscription being betrayed by other statements and responses. Resistance to
articulation protects a belief from contestation, allowing it, instead, to
shape lived experience intimately and tactfully from within. The most
conspicuous examples of the rarely articulated members of the fourth class are
social beliefs about professions and interest groups: for example, that
scientists are emotionally repressed, accountants are boring.
The most obvious examples of the articulated cases are the formalisation of
national and provincial stereotype: London is impersonal; Glaswegians are
friendly and humorous.
The fifth class of cliche does not involve truth value. Its members are
expressions and turns of phrase: at the end of the day; over the piece; at this
moment in time; to be quite honest with you.
The five classes of cliche do not exclude each other universally. An obvious
combination is the second and fourth; for example, a speaker addressing a
Scottish audience might present as ground-floor truth the Scots are more
friendly than the English, and there might be uncritical acceptance in his
audience.
We now inhabit a culture which extends very little houseroom to the unshowy,
dogged use of the intellect. We demand increasingly that writers and speakers
jolt, thrill, and unsettle. We therefore thrust our accolades at the
strainingly clever and wacky performers of the pen and of the tongue.
Conversely, our era downgrades and parodies the rigorous, self-effacing use of
intellect. This reflects, in turn, our style-riven times. Cliche is
stylistically humdrum, therefore it is culturally inadmissible. Postmodernism,
with its dethronement of truth and elevation of text, offers a mild injection
of culturally timely intellectual sponsorship.
Intellectually, our culture finds it difficult to go the distance. Proper use
of intellect entails boredom. If correctness is sometimes as important as
flashiness, then the greyness of cliche is an ineliminable source of boredom.
And we are not at ease with the notion of an enriching or fructifying boredom.

THERE is much head-scratching over what exactly has happened to the Northern
Ireland peace process. Have the Irish and British Prime Ministers worked long
and mightily and brought forward a fudge, as alleged yesterday by some
disgruntled figures? Or do we have here a creative piece of political
manoeuvring which might allow the stalled process to move forward once more,
albeit on rusty rails? The answer to those questions is that both fudge and
creativity are involved, although working out where the fulcrum lies between
them is not easy. We should dispose first of all with the Washington
connection. It was said yesterday that the rush to agreement by Mr Bruton and
Mr Major was encouraged by President Clinton's imminent arrival in the United
Kingdom. This could be taken two ways: either the two Prime Ministers were
anxious to gain some sort of agreement to prevent the possibility of President
Clinton gathering the merit from any potential progress, or they rushed matters
along for fear of harsh words from the leader of the Western world.
The first point is the most reasonable. Having worked long and hard it is
perfectly understandable if Mr Bruton and Mr Major did not relish the prospect
of President Clinton claiming credit. The truth is that he is due a good
measure of credit but is too sensible to claim it, at least in public.
Washington has lobbied energetically in Dublin in recent days with the aim of
moving the Irish Government's belief that it is not possible for the IRA to
dispose of any weapons before all-party talks begin. Arm-twisting will also
have been applied to Sinn Fein, for Washington is less pleased with Mr Gerry
Adams than it was earlier this year. It is unlikely that attitudes have been
altered on matters of so-called principle, but the log jam has been breached a
little and negotiations may start to flow again.
This does not mean that a solution has been found. It may be unkind to describe
this week's agreement as a fudge but that is what it is. Nobody, as far as can
be seen, has changed their minds on the major issues. The British Government
and the Irish Government still hold their respective positions on the question
of disposing of arms but they have decided to set their differences aside to
allow someone else to shoulder the arms burden for a while. This, they hope,
will permit the preparatory talks to go ahead. Here we have movement and
creativity. The talks will be intensive, or so Mr Major hopes, and the Ulster
Unionists have been lured towards them by the promise that the issue of an
elected body will be discussed. This should allow initial Unionist scorn to be
dissipated somewhat, though for the sake of his electoral prospects Mr Major
would be advised to keep a weather eye on Mr Trimble and his associates.
Yet there is a positive side to all the manoeuvring of recent days. The British
and Irish Governments have re-established a momentum of sorts which will allow
the peace process to escape from the backwater in which it was mired. They have
done something else just as important. Mr Major was determined yesterday to
impress on the participants that he and Mr Bruton could not establish a peace
settlement by themselves. Speaking directly to the violent and the gun-holders
on both sides of the argument he is saying that the next move is up to them.
This is a powerful message; it is time they listened to it, and acted
accordingly.

THIS presentation at the TSB's Edinburgh HQ was a review of a work-in-progress
and also an appeal for corporate sponsorship in order to assure the project's
future.
Set up two years ago by the Edinburgh-based Slide Workshop, Light Opera is a
multi-media project continuing Slide Workshop's Equal Arts Programme in
conjunction with the charitable Drake Music Project. For 10 years Slide
Workshop has encouraged people to discover their own hidden abilities using
image projection, lighting techniques, and sound.
Similarly, the Drake Music Project enables physically-disabled young people and
adults to make music utilising computer technology while carrying out research
in expanding uses of electronic machinery.
Light Opera's presentation combined instrumental and vocal music, slide
projection, and video production with a photographic display recording the
company's work. The band of five musicians and singers, disabled and
non-disabled, performed to a high standard.
Vicky Haylott's ballad, backed by David Trouton on keyboards and Rick Bamford
on percussion, filled the TSB's atrium with rich, strong sound. Richard Weir
took over on vocals with Brian Sutherland joining on keyboard arrangement with
a witty epigrammatic play on popular nursery rhymes. Liz Tainch projected slide
images to kaleidoscopic effect.
As we are currently in the National Week of Disabled People, it would be
fitting if funding were forthcoming.

'ON one hand, it's highly commendable that Strathclyde Theatre Group's
semi-professional company should tackle difficult and challenging work . . .and
you don't get much more challenging than the black hearted, morally complex
world of John Ford's Jacobean tragedy.
Certainly, there's educational value in allowing the play to be seen and in
offering aspiring actors the opportunity to grapple with meaty roles.
Undoubtedly, STG's affiliations with Strathclyde University make sense of this
pedagogical function. But when, as in this instance, the quality of the
production is so uneven and shoddily staged, it raises the question of just for
whom the piece is intended.
Don't get me wrong, it wasn't all bad. It was revealing to see the Ramshorn
Theatre opened up into Traverse format, although sight lines into the
scaffolding structures at either end were a problem.
Strong performances, noteably by the female members, reached the necessary
level of passion and intensity. Above all, the power of Ford's horribly
pertinent drama of sexual taboos, madness, incest, and intrigue, shone through.
However, a piece of such heightened emotion, florid language, and ideological
complexity, needs a clear confident and coherent vision to guide it and give it
credibility.
The sheer visial panache and bold dramatic sweeps of the best of the Citizens'
Jacobean productions were sadly lacking in Susan C Triesman's direction,
leaving actors to struggle with a text they seemed not fully to understand and
strut woodenly around a bland set.

LONE parents and the young unemployed are to pay for the 1p cut in income tax
announced in the Budget. Chancellor Kenneth Clarke had barely sat down on
Tuesday before Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley was on his feet to spell
out who will be footing the bill for the Government's largesse.
Single people under 25 in private rented accommodation will face curbs in
eligibility for housing benefit. (Effectively, the young unemployed will
qualify only for the cost of shared accommodation, rather than that of a
self-contained flat.)
Lone parents are spared from this axe but will suffer two other blows. Both of
the special payments available to one-parent families are to be frozen and
eventually phased out. At present a lone-parent premium of #5.20 a week goes to
single parents on income support and all lone parents qualify for the #6.30 a
week one-parent benefit.
Both cuts were leaked by Labour earlier this month following the interception
of a letter from Mr Lilley to Treasury Chief Secretary William Waldegrave.
Nevertheless, confirmation that they were to go ahead provoked a furious
reaction yesterday from the Opposition and pressure groups representing those
who stand to lose out.
The cuts in housing benefit apply to all new claims and reviews of existing
claims made after next October and will affect an estimated 135,000 claimants
aged 16 to 24. This is expected to save the Treasury #100m over three years.
The benefit has been targeted already for large-scale pruning, mainly by
cutting back on the categories of people eligible. The Government is concerned
at the alarming way the housing benefit bill has doubled since they switched
housing subsidy from bricks and mortar to individuals in 1987, in a bid to
stimulate the private-rented sector. The effect has been large rent rises with
the suspicion that many landlords are milking the system.
In future a rent officer will base his assessment on the average cost in the
area of a bedsit or room in a multi-occupation flat when the applicant is less
than 25.
Justifying the cuts on Tuesday, the Chancellor said they would deter young
people from leaving home before they could afford to, that they would encourage
youngsters to rent within their means and would increase incentives to work.
Critics question all three arguments.
Shelter Scotland says the policy ignores the plight of those under-25s who
simply don't have families to return to because they grew up in care or because
they have been kicked out of the parental home or forced to leave because of
abuse.
And the charity argues that in many areas of Scotland, rural areas in
particular, shared accommodation is simply not available. As for incentives to
work, Michael Thain of Shelter says: ``The real issue is that unemployment
among young people remains high because there are not enough jobs.''
This cut in housing benefit can be seen as the latest instance of the
Government's policy of encouraging ``youth rates'' in both employment and the
benefits system. It began nine years ago with the removal of under-21s from the
pay protection offered by wages councils. Peter Hunter of the Scottish Low Pay
Unit said: ``These changes combine to create a package in which young people
get less, whether it's in work, benefits or training. This means they find it
harder to pay their rent. If anything, they require more help rather than less.
The obvious consequence of cutting help with housing costs is more young people
being forced on to the streets.''
The announcements about lone-parent premium and one-parent benefit signal the
ending of official recognition that lone parents face higher costs, especially
for childcare. ``The right approach is to neither penalise nor to promote lone
parenthood,'' Mr Lilley told the Commons yesterday. In political terms this is
clearly a move designed to pander to the Tory right who have caricatured lone
mothers as unmarried teenagers, happy to live off the state and even
deliberately becoming pregnant in order to maximise their benefits, despite
ample evidence to the contrary.
The phasing out of lone-parent premium is likely to increase the hardship of
some of the most vulnerable families. Around 40% of Scotland's 132,000 lone
parents live on less than #100 a week, compared with just 2% of two-parent
families, according to One Plus, which helps and lobbies for one-parent
families in Strathclyde. ``There can be no excuse for taking away benefits
which so many families need simply to survive,'' said One Plus  director, John
Findlay.
One-parent benefit was designed as a ladder to help lone parents climb out of
welfare back into work. That's why it isn't means-tested. Abolishing it appears
to fly in the face of everything the Conservatives stand for. Though the loss
of this benefit will be partially offset by an increase in childcare allowances
from #40 to #60 a week and there's the promise of a pilot scheme to help lone
parents get training and jobs, there are fears that much of the supposed
savings from the lone-parent benefits cuts will be lost in increased income
support payments to single mums who decide to stay at home.

THE Christmas tree and the coloured lights festooned on the shops at the top
cross in Hamilton proclaim it to be the season of goodwill to all men. But for
striking postal workers stamping their feet to keep warm around a dustbin
brazier just 100 yards away there is one man they would absent from the list.
He is Gordon Johnson, newly-promoted line manager at the Hamilton sorting
office, who has unwittingly found himself at the centre of a bitter local
dispute which threatens to rekindle the embers of last week's national
unofficial strike.
The national strike's epicentre was the tiny office of Portobello where a local
walkout over changing work practices and the threat they posed to jobs spread
shockwaves throughout the country which were to register more than 5000
Scottish postal workers taking unofficial action.
According to one postman, it was an ``outburst of underlying anger at the
manner in which management has undertaken the task of rationalisation over the
past five years''.
The men voted to return to work on Sunday and began clearing a 12 million
letter backlog which built up during the strike. Hamilton, the only place where
the strike was official, recorded a similar vote on Monday.
And it is the fact that the strike at Hamilton was official which is crucial to
the understanding of what has followed.
For the past 16 weeks workers there had been in the vanguard of additional
supervision and close monitoring as management introduced new working practices
and cut back on second deliveries of post.
The men had come to the end of their tether. As the unofficial dispute
escalated, they made their action official against the trend towards
casualisation, increased use of part-time staff, and heavier workloads.
Then, on Sunday, a settlement was reached with a 14-point peace plan promising
a review of delivery services. Talks would continue between the two sides until
mid-January with the Communication Workers' Union agreeing to suspend plans to
ballot members on taking official action.
As part of the deal, union officials at Hamilton claimed they were told Mr
Johnson, who in their minds is indivisible from management's drive to change
working practices and ultimately cut jobs, would be moved.
Mr Tam McHugh, the local CWU representative, said yesterday Mr Johnson himself
had told him he was being sent back to Shotts. However, when the nightshift
arrived for work at midnight on Monday they found Mr Johnson was still there -
a red rag to a bull.
Mr McHugh said yesterday: ``So we never actually went back to work and are
still on official strike.''
They genuinely believed, he said, that they had an agreement that Mr Johnson
would be moved and that the changes in work practices would be put on hold
while they are debated at national level.
Royal Mail see it differently and said yesterday they would not remove Mr
Johnson as a pre-condition of a return to work.
As Mr McHugh speaks he has constantly to raise his voice as passing cars toot
their support for the strikers. ``We want to go back and deliver mail to the
public but we will not work with Mr Johnson.''
He added: ``At one stage during the past 16 weeks we had 10 managers for 68
workers. If anyone stopped working they would come up and tell you to get on
with it. I have had my members called `lazy bastards' while I was called a `fat
bastard' by one of the managers. It was just ludicrous.''
Royal Mail as a business had made a profit of #1500m last year, but this it
would seem is not enough.
``As usual, they are trying to take it off the bottom of the tree. In Hamilton
we fear the management want to cut 25 second deliveries which would mean the
loss of 12!s jobs. It is all about saving money.''
Management allegations of unruly and violent picketing are vehemently denied.
``Ask the police. They will tell you there has been no trouble. The accusation
has been levelled by Alex Gibb, delivery director for Scotland, but he has
never been here.''
Mr McHugh also took exception to another of Mr Gibb's comments. Mr Gibb said
yesterday: ``We will no longer be able to open the inquiry office for customers
coming in to collect their mail. It's simply not safe. I am sure our customers
will understand that we cannot put our people at risk.''
However, Mr McHugh maintained that was just not true. He said: ``If the public
wanted their mail, we let them in. There was a wee lassie who didn't want to
cross our picket line but was desperate to collect her giro. We told her to go
in just as we have told any other members of the public. We have no problem
with that.''
Both sides now seem deeply dug in and what happens next is anyone's guess. As
Mr McHugh returns to warm his hands at the brazier, this could be the spark to
reignite the whole dispute.
Elsewhere there is a growing feeling it is at best an uneasy peace which has
broken out nationally with the day of reckoning postponed until the season of
goodwill ends.

THE Scottish Rugby Union yesterday launched a scheme aimed at securing business
support for the country's leading players.
The idea was born before the rule changes on professionalism in a bid to
encourage employers to take on players with support from the SRU. It is
intended to formalise the kind of social and professional links forged at club
level throughout the country.
SRU director of rugby Jim Telfer said: ``The problems of reconciling the
demands of first-class rugby with a career will not be solved easily. We will
listen carefully to the views of employers before taking this initiative
forward. This is just the first step.
``Much has been said about professionalism and while it is true that there is
more money coming into the game, very few first-class players are likely to
benefit significantly, and certainly not in the short term.
``For the players to be successful they have to spend quite an amount of time
away from their work. We are trying to keep the best players in Scotland and we
are trying to keep the best players with the best careers as well.''
``If the correct player goes to the correct company, there is a mutual benefit
to both.''
The SRU plans further meetings to discuss careers with a variety of
organisations, including the police service and hospital trusts.
Among those speaking at the launch was Eric Barr, chairman of PEC Barr
Printers, whose sales manager is former Scotland hooker Kenny Milne.
``The problem now is that circumstances are changing so quickly that it is
quite      difficult to keep up,'' said Barr.
``We employed Ken not as an up-and-coming rugby star but as an established
internationalist. When we took him on we knew the ramifications and rugby
undoubtedly helped.
``The public relations aspect is an asset, but he is good at his job here, but
then his international status also helps him to be good at his job.''
q FORMER Scotland captain David Sole declined an invitation to appear at
Murrayfield last night following his reported criticism of referee Colin
Henderson, but the meeting went ahead, attended by two officials from Edinburgh
Academicals.
Sole, who coaches the Accies forwards, had been summoned to account for his
public outburst against the referee following the league defeat by Melrose at
Raeburn Place. Sole questioned the nine successive penalties awarded to Melrose
in injury time from which the Borderers scored their winning try to put
Academicals on course for relegation.
Academicals' secretary Ken Lauder said: ``It is likely that there will be a
future meeting between the SRU and David Sole at Murrayfield.''
Sole was unable to accept the SRU's invite because of baby-sitting duties, his
wife having to attend a meeting associated with her new business venture.
Meanwhile, Edinburgh Academicals, having been asked by Melrose to investigate
further the incident in which Melrose prop Mark Ross received a blow to his eye
that has caused sight impairment, have made ``a suitable response.''
``We have looked into the matter and our conclusion is that the incident
happened in the usual hurly-burly of front-row play. We believe that punches
were thrown by both sides,'' said Academicals secretary Lauder.
q THIRTY-THREE players have been called up for the Scotland squad session on
Sunday at Murrayfield. In addition to the 21 who were in the squad for the
Western Samoa match 12 others have been invited, significant among whom are
back row forward Eric Peters, centre Tony Stanger, scrum halves Andy Nicol and
Derrick Patterson, and hooker Martin Scott.
Also included are Scott Hastings and Craig Joiner, both ruled out of selection
for the Samoan match because of injury, and prop Peter Wright, who missed the
last international game because of a six-week suspension. The others invited to
attend         are Cameron Glasgow, prop Millan Browne and locks Ian Elliot and
Malcolm Norval.

Glasgow Under-21 22, South Under-21 17
GLASGOW opened their inter-district under-21 championship campaign with this
success at Murrayfield last night.
The winning try was scored by the former Kelso player, David McLeish, now with
West of Scotland. McLeish played well, with Steve Begley also making notable
contributions in the lineout.
Behind the scrum, Jamie Weston began to play more visionary rugby, tormenting
the South defence with some telling runs.
South applied the early pressure, Gavin Dalgleish putting over a penalty before
McLeish scored the first of his two tries from short-range to put Glasgow
ahead. Tony Greenshield added the conversion, but South scored a try from scrum
half David Paterson, Dalgleish adding the conversion.
When Steve Lawrie raced over for South's second try and Dalgleish converted, it
seemed the Borderers were heading for victory. However, Glasgow reasserted
themselves and Greenshield pulled them back with a penalty. Then the full back
was on hand to add the conversion of a splendid try by Geoff Caldwell from a
break by Weston.
Right on time Glasgow made their pressure rugby tell when McLeish, from a
pick-up at a scrum five metres out, evaded the fringe defence for his second
try to bring Glasgow victory.

Edinburgh Under-21 45,
North-Midlands Under-21 0
EDINBURGH, the defending champions put on a polished performance at Murrayfield
to outclass an under-strength North-Midlands side last night.
Sammy Dow gave the game an excitement that has been missing in so much of
Scottish rugby, the Edinburgh Academical, until he retired injured 30 minutes
into the game, showing the value of a running stand-off.
Edinburgh, with likely senior players Graham Dall, Tam McVie, and Scott Murray
in their pack, were much too skilful for a North-Midlands side that at best
contributed with some resistant defence.
A Campbell Aitken penalty triggered Edinburgh's point-scoring machine into
action before Dow side-stepped through the defence for a marvellous solo try
which Aitken converted.
Aitken's second penalty gave Edinburgh a 13-0 half-time lead, but the
title-holders really cut loose in the second half. Winger Ally McLean opened
with an unconverted try before Aitken blazed through an eroded defence for
another unconverted touchdown.
Edinburgh increased their lead through tries by Grant Talac, Doug Rogerson, and
Scott Murray, a dropped goal by Mike Duncan and two further conversions by
Aitken.

PETER Phillips, son of the Princess Royal, will win his first Scottish Schools
cap when he plays against French Schools at Goldenacre on December 22.
Phillips owes his inclusion in part to an injury to his Gordonstoun team-mate,

selection was the decision to move Jason White from blindside flanker to lock,
his international position last season.

n-LOSING #5.20 from the weekly income must hardly seem worth worrying about for
those with a job. The price of a couple of drinks or a taxi fare. So what. But
for lone parents subsisting on income support any erosion in benefits brings
unbearable financial pressure.
Yesterday in Glasgow a group of single mothers, currently studying for an
administration qualification in an attempt to find a job, listed everyday items
that would have to go when, as outlined by Social Security Minister Peter
Lilley, the one-parent premium is phased out along with the #6.10 one-parent
benefit paid to families regardless of income.
For women like Anne McAllister, who left an abusive partner and has one
daughter, or Alexis Couper, who has four children, a fiver buys a week's worth
of cheap dinners, a power card, a box of nappies or a bus pass. It pays for a
couple of trips to the swimming pool, for gymnastic lessons for Ms McAllister's
daughter, or contributes towards after-school care for Liz Fallon's
five-year-old son.
Managing on benefits that range from #77 a week to #150 a week the women say
while it can be tough on a daily basis, the biggest problem is coping long term
on benefits. Think what happens, says Ms McAllister, if the washing-machine
breaks down. Any loss of benefits means worrying about how to pay back a DSS
loan, usually 13% of a person's income, for a new machine. Phasing out premiums
totalling #20 a month means not being able to buy a new pair of shoes or a
jacket for a child or simply skimping on meals themselves to feed their
children.
Attacks on single mothers angers people like Ms Fallon who says that she is
trying to improve her life through education. Single parents, she says, are
portrayed by the Government as irresponsible teenage girls when the majority
have been in stable relationships and would not have chosen the circumstance
they find themselves in.
The 26-year-old lives in a privately rented flat in Renfrew. She has a
five-year-old son, Sean-Paul, and a three-year-old daughter, Gemma. The father
of her children died after taking a drugs overdose.
In addition to income support she receives #18 a week child benefit but pays
#20 a week in after-school care, a loan repayment of #10 and a fixed
electricity payment of #20. She is left with #43 for food, clothes, shoes, bus
fares to her mother's house in the north of Glasgow and, next month, Christmas
presents. Her son has already requested that he get more than two small
presents.
In spite of the difficulties Ms Fallon is optimistic about her future after
admitting spending a couple of years doing nothing. ``I've got up and decided
to do something. I want to study for an HNC and then go to London and do an HND
in business and computing.''
But that future depends on paying the #6 a week subsidised child-care costs at
Glasgow's Nautical College when she enrols for an HNC next year. So while some
may shrug at #5 a week, it is ironic that Ms Fallon's attempts to free herself
from state dependence could be dashed by a state saving of a fiver.

RECORD-BREAKING Stephen Hendry for once failed to hit the heights yesterday at
the Royal Liver Assurance UK Championship in Preston. But the Scot's
consolation for a below-par display against Irish stablemate Ken Doherty is a
6-2 overnight lead in their best-of-17-frames quarter-final.
When the duo met in the 1994 UK final, Hendry went on a potting spree, notching
five century breaks in seven frames and seven in 12 during his 10-5 triumph.
The world No.1 almost reproduced that dazzling form, this time in the earlier
rounds when he produced his 147 maximum against Gary Wilkinson in the last 16.
But after threatening to launch his bid for the penultimate round with another
massive clearance, Hendry surprisingly went off the boil.
He won the opening frame with a break of 85, but fluffed an easy pink with a
possible 144 on the table.
World No.9 Doherty, who has won only two of their 10 previous meetings,
levelled the score at 1-1 with runs of 48 and 34. This was the closest he came
to Hendry through bad luck and carelessness.
Breaks of 37 and 85 propelled the 26-year-old defending champion 3-1 ahead at
the mid-session interval. However, he seemed certain to lose the fifth with
Dubliner Doherty forging clear, courtesy of a 53 break.
To his cost, Doherty missed an easy pink and Hendry's own 53 eventually helped
him take the frame 77-53.
In the next frame it was Hendry's turn to make the mistake. He led 47 points to
nil but allowed Doherty to recover with a run of 59. All Doherty required was a
clearance up to the blue, but he snookered himself on the final yellow.
After several safety exchanges Doherty found himself snookered tight behind the
brown ball. Trying to find an escape to hit the green, instead he struck the
blue three times.
At the fourth attempt he reached his target, but left the ball on for Hendry to
clear green to pink and go 5-1 up.
The last two frames of the session were shared and Doherty will be disappointed
not to start on level terms for the conclusion of the match this afternoon.
Hendry requires only three of the remaining nine frames to stay on course for
his fourth UK title in six years.
Peter Ebdon, defeated by Hendry in the semi-finals 12 months ago, established a
5-3, first-session lead over Nigel Bond, and at the end of their quarter-final
last night there still were two frames between the pair, with Ebdon winning the
match 9-7.
In the other tie, Scotland's John Higgins, who in the previous round defeated
Jimmy White, was not having things his own way against Mark Williams in the
early stages, but steadied, eventually ending the session at 4-4 with the
Welshman.

BEAUTIFUL South fans are tall. Nothing wrong with that. Unless you're
unfortunate enough to be stuck standing at the back of a packed-hangar SECC.
Then it's most unfortunate. Particularly when the tall ones have come along to
listen, motionless. Us small ones were forced to balance upon each others
shoulders if we wanted to see the band.
But this precarious act was worth it, if only to witness the sight of Paul
Heaton, he of the Clark Kent jaw and Bernard Manning belly, singing, I Think
the Answer's Yes, while sashaying across the stage. Sand dancing indoors.
Outstanding.
He's got a fine old voice this fellow. At times it worries, but always remains
this side of overblown. And the overall sound from the band was good too, just
what you'd expect from their records. Very nice. But no more than that. None of
yer raucous japery here mate. What you get are well crafted songs with clever,
ironic lyrics.
Ideal for home listening or a more intimate venue where the alcohol flows and
the only impediment to a good view is a thick curtain of cigarette smoke.
Heaton told us a tale of a recent drinking session with Blur. It involved
champagne, a hotel reception and a hot water bottle. Very funny I'm sure, but
the gist got lost somewhere in the ether off this high-vaulted hall.
They're troupers though, the Southies. The guitar player is apparently dead
from a broken arm, singer Jacqueline Abbott's missing, pregnant, the bass amp
broke down, and still the show went on. They might not rock, but they certainly
roll.

ANGELA Pendrich gave hint of a return to form at the Cumbernauld Meet and is
now determined to fight her way back into the international reckoning via the
Scottish winter championships in two weeks' time.
The 19-year-old Commonwealth Games swimmer spent the summer sidelined by
glandular fever, but bounced back to win a silver and bronze at Cumbernauld.
``It's not been an easy time,'' admitted the London-based youngster. ``I've had
to change clubs after my coach moved to Wales, and now I'm training with the
local Greenwich Borough Mariners.
``I was pleased with my performance at Cumbernauld, because I'd only been back
in training for five weeks, and now I'm hoping to build on that at Ayr. The
first priority is to force my way back into the Scottish team.''
The Olympic trials in March remain the big target, although she realises it is
a long shot. Last time, it all ended in tears when she lost out by fractions of
a second in the 400 metres free-style.
This time, she faces even tougher opposition. Sarah Hardcastle's comeback has
limited her chances in the distance free-style, while the evergreen Kathy Osher
will be form favourite to take the spot in Pendrich's other discipline, the
200m back-stroke.

THE sport's governing body, FINA, has admitted an anomaly in their new
sanctions for drug offences, which means the penalty for refusing to take a
test is shorter than that for being caught using banned substances.
The FINA congress has agreed automatic, four-year suspensions for swimmers
taking anabolic steroids, yet those who refuse to take a test receive only two
years. The four-year ban is unenforceable in countries where civil law views
anything longer than two years as a restraint of trade.

at the magnificent Highland scenery around Loch Fyne holds several surprises
for anyone interested in our much-vaunted natural history.
In among the indigenous crimson-berried rowans and stately Scots pines set by
the roadside is a standard North American Giant Redwood in the Ardkinglas
woodland garden. Behind them the more slender-limbed Southern Beech from South
America flourishes. Eucalyptus trees from Tasmania, whose leaves make up the
staple diet of koala bears, are also visible among a host of other exotic
varieties from China and the Far East.
But this isn't arboreal contamination of our native flora. Rather, the tree
shop garden centre aims at providing a very wide range of exotic and indigenous
trees, shrubs and plants to cater for the growing interest in world as well as
domestic species in and around British gardens.
Surprisingly, to those of us with little knowledge of arboreal matters, and
partly because of the frost and lack of sunlight, December is a good month for
tree planting. With the shoots dormant for the winter, even the more
temperamental species can be well dug in just now, with three months of snow
and heavy winter to bed them down in plenty of time before spring works its
annual miracle.
The mild and wild climate of Argyll provides a first-class environment for the
shoots to thrive in, giving the centre's manager Mark Sands the satisfaction of
seeing good growth in a comparatively short time. All of which, coupled with
his comprehensive range, free catalogue and following mail order business, is
gaining the Tree Shop a country-wide reputation for excellent service and
quality goods.
A recent addition to the range of woodwork is folding garden furniture, made
from British hardwood. Designed to be elegant, yet strong, it folds for storage
and is light enough for anyone to carry.
The centre prides itself in an interest in the unusual but with the emphasis on
quality and an assured, friendly service.
The Tree Shop has also the luxury of a tasty little oyster bar as immediate
neighbour, where superb seafood can be taken away to be enjoyed at home, or
eaten on site fresh from the tanks.
Just an hour from Glasgow, and well within reach from anywhere in the central
belt, this woodland garden and extensive shopping area is a first-class
destination for any family fed up with the hustle and bustle of festive
shopping and that feeling of fighting the crowd.

Veteran singer Bruce Trent has died at his London home, aged 82
BRUCE TRENT was one of the top singer-actors in stage musicals in the 40s and
50s, making frequent radio appearances and selling more than one million
records.
He took part in three Royal Variety Performances and appeared on many
television shows in Britain and America.
He was born Billy Butters in St Helier in Jersey and trained as an architect
before turning to showbusiness and coming to England in 1936.
He made his first broadcast in 1937 before joining the Jack Hylton Band where
his baritone voice was immediately popular with female fans.
When Hylton became one of the West End's top producers in the 40s he made sure
Trent got starring roles in shows such as Brigadoon, Camelot, and The Student
Prince.
Trent was married with four children. Comedian Ted Ray was his best man at his
wedding in 1940.

THE Chinese director, Zhang Yimou, has made some memorable films, including Red
Sorghum, Raise the Red Lantern and The Story of Qui Ju with his regular star,
Gong Li. His latest, Shanghai Triad, a brilliantly conceived gangster thriller
in which Gong Li plays Bijou, the ambitious, sexually predatory mistress of
Tang (Li Biotang), a Shanghai Godfather, breaks new ground for them both.
Bijou - a cabaret singer, who struts her stuff in scarlet feathers while the
chorus dance around in white, and the boss's acolytes mutter about her lack of
talent in the wings - is having an affair with the boss's sidekick, Song (Sun
Chun). The stage is set for disaster.
The life of the Triad is seen during the course of a week through the eyes of
Shuisheng (Wang Xiaoxiao) a small country boy brought by his uncle to be the
mistress's servant.
There is a gang war in process which forces Tang to flee to a remote island
with his mistress and his closest supporters. The arrival of these evil, greedy
city people destroys the innocent way of life enjoyed by the islanders and
leads to a shocking climax.
Yimou cunningly keeps most of the violence off screen. Although we know awful
things have happened, the full horror - Martin Scorsese take note - comes from
knowing, not from having bloody things thrust in front of one's eyes.
Yimou has taken a familiar Hollywood genre piece, the Warner Brothers mobster
movie with the Claire Trevor tart with the heart and Edward G Robinson gangster
characters, and translated them to an alien world with consummate brilliance.
Shanghai Triad looks magnificent, the performances, especially that of Gong Li,
are outstanding, while the ending, with the boy suspended upside down from the
mast of the Boss's boat for trying to protect his mistress, is truly chilling.
His world has literally been turned upside down.

I DREAD the coming of the Turner Prize and generally try to avoid the hype
surrounding it. This is partly because of a dislike of all artistic
competitions and prizes - which have turned music, above all, into a
competitive sport - and partly because I hate to be reminded of how great the
gulf is between contemporary art and the general public.
The Turner Prize, for all its good intentions - and I am charitably assuming it
has good intentions, though it has never really been clear what or who the
prize is for - widens that gulf. Contemporary art never gets noticed by the
tabloids unless there is an opportunity to re-run the Bricks at the Tate story.
There would be no chance, in Britain, of the type of reponse by the German
tabloid Bild to Christo's wrapping of the Reichstag in Berlin this summer: mad,
but wonderful. All art here must be categorised as mad, bad, and a joke at the
taxpayer's expense. This I can live with, but the broadsheets and the TV arts
programmes cover the Turner Prize artists as if they come from another planet;
there is a bemused, jokey approach to the whole thing. Every year, they ask:
``But is it art?'' Of course it is. What else would it be? The question is:
``Is it any good?''
All this, together with the bookmakers' odds and all the hoopla, means work
which could get through to people - to individual people, not ``the public'' -
is overwhelmed. I went to see House twice in the year Rachel Whiteread won the
prize. It was a strange and remarkable piece, standing there in isolation like
so many houses briefly left over from demolition in wastelands all over London.
It struck a chord. People brought their children.
This year Damien Hirst won, of course. Children like his work, too. Not the dot
paintings, which are a part of a coherent but restricted, very restricted,
internal debate about painting and the nature of painting - I don't like them
much myself, because they haven't anything new to say; but certainly the
infamous work, the shark in formaldehyde and everything that followed it - art
as natural history, as spectacle.
Hirst is a showman. Advertisers nick his ideas; he nicks ideas from
advertisers. He makes it very clear the problem most people have with art is
not so much any individual art work, but the word ``art'' itself. Every day we
all process very sophisticated visual material without a moment's thought. But
when the word ``art'' precedes it, there is a terrible defensiveness.
Brian Eno began to address this in his speech at the award ceremony. A lot of
the blame lies with the art world - not necessarily artists - and this partly
because the art world often does not need a public. What matters to the dealer
is not the equivalent of bums on seats - feet on floors? - but cheques in
banks. If mystification sells, or if it helps writers and curators move on up
in academic circles, then it will not be overcome.
Mystification makes people feel stupid. But sometimes the response to
contemporary art is itself stupid, paranoid, insanely aggressive.
Artists cannot pretend the past 100 years have not happened. They cannot begin
to deal with criticism which suggests paintings and sculptures should look like
paintings and sculptures from 100 years ago, that they should not address our
lives now, seeking out new forms. Abstract painters must take 80 years of
abstraction for granted; they cannot begin to defend themselves from criticism
which dismisses abstraction out of hand. Artists must be met halfway.
Mark Wallinger was one of the short-listed artists. He is a neo-Dadaist, and
that is a pretty arid area, but he gives it a laddish twist. It is interesting
that he moves over into sport, though mostly into racing, to make points about
breeding - human as well as animal.
Sport, it has seemed to me for some time, is doing what art has been unable to
do in all honesty for some time - since the Renaissance even. Sport is defining
the heroic possibilities of the human - the human body and the human spirit.
Such talk has long since sounded phoney in art, and the notion of genius has
often been used only to stop us looking for ourselves or to put up prices. But
sporting achievements and sporting genius still mean something.
The two artists short-listed whose work means most to me are Mona Hatoum and
Callum Innes. Hatoum's installations - and you have to be with them, inside
them - are very simple, very minimal, and yet are also political parables: they
sum things up, often unforgettably. Innes makes very beautiful paintings. You
have to stand in front of them, with your eyes open.

RANGERS have warned the SFA that if their players are treated severely at
today's disciplinary meeting in Glasgow, the club will consider taking the
association to court. Vice-chairman Donald Findlay, confirming that the three
Ibrox players involved in controversial incidents during the 1-1 game with
Aberdeen at Ibrox would appear at Park Gardens, said last night that the club
had asked the SFA on a number of occasions the same question but had not
received a clear answer.
``We have asked why it seems to be that, because a supervisor in the stand
disagrees with the referee on the pitch, a player can be taken before the
committee,'' said the Ibrox vice-chairman, who also is a QC, ``but as yet we
have had no clear answer.''
The players concerned are Paul Gascoigne, John Brown, and Alan McLaren who,
along with Aberdeen's Billy Dodds, have been summoned to the committee hearing
as a consequence of a report by referee supervisor Don McVicar.
Although the incidents, none of which resulted in a sending-off by the referee,
John Rowbotham, were captured by TV cameras, that evidence is not allowed in
Scottish disciplinary meetings. That is expected to be changed when a motion to
permit its use as evidence will be put before the SFA Council in January.
Rangers' objection to the summons of their players is based on their belief
that the supervisor's report is not a valid base for disciplining players.
``They have not pointed to a rule which allows this to happen,'' said Findlay.
``We have been referred to various articles and general principles of the SFA,
but as a mere lawyer I can't work them out.''
The Ibrox trio will be represented by Players' Union secretary Tony Higgins,
who will speak on their behalf. However, it seems certain that the committee
will take action, irrespective of the club's position. The association believes
that, under its constitution, it is free to discipline players for misbehaviour
as it sees fit.
``If it becomes obvious that the SFA are looking at material that we have not
had notice of, for example press reports or television pictures,'' added
Findlay, ``that is not a fair way to go about business.
``It means that the way the committee works is not in accordance with the basic
principles of justice. If they do that we are not prepared to see our players
prejudiced by that kind of treatment, and we would certainly be looking to take
matters to law. And we have made our position plain to the SFA.''
The procurator fiscal is already considering taking action against one or more
of the players involved in the controversial incidents only a few weeks after
former Rangers player, Duncan Ferguson, was released from prison following a
sentence brought about when he was taken to court for assault by the fiscal.
The stance the club is taking makes it appear that a collision with the SFA is
inevitable.
Also appearing this afternoon in front of the SFA committee will be Alan
Lawrence, of Hearts, Sean Sweeney, of Airdrie, and Dumbarton's Ian McFarlane,
who are all expected to receive suspensions.
q INTER-Milan's Paul Ince has been banned for one match following his fourth
yellow card of the season.
The former Manchester United player, who has not been seen at his best since
his #7m summer transfer, picked up his fourth caution in the game against
Fiorentina at weekend.

BOXING:
KATHERINE Morrison, Scotland's only woman promoter, has been cleared by the
British Boxing Board of Control of any negligence for the ringside riot which
took place at the end of last month's ill-fated British bantamweight title
contest in Glasgow between Condorrat's Drew Docherty and James Murray, of
Newmains.
An inquiry by the board in London also found that no fault lay with co-promoter
Frank Warren, of London, nor the venue, the Hospitality Inn.
Murray, the challenger, was knocked out in the twelfth and final round of a
close contest. As he received medical assistance on the canvas, a section of
the crowd, believed to be latecomers who paid only for the boxing and not the
meal at the wine and dine show, caused a serious disturbance, with bottles,
chairs, and other objects thrown.
Murray died in hospital two days later, but yesterday's inquiry dealt only with
the trouble among the crowd.
The outcome of the meeting was that the boxing chiefs have banned ``mixed''
promotions. Only those clients who attend the actual dinner at such an event
will be allowed to view the boxing.
Katherine Morrison attended yesterday's inquiry with her father Alex. Board
secretary John Morris said: ``They were most helpful.'' Katherine will now go
ahead with a planned show at Glasgow's Moat House Hotel next month. She
recently announced that she would continue in boxing, and, prior to the board's
findings, vowed never to stage another ``mixed'' show, despite having
successfully staged them for five years.
The board stewards stressed promoters must liaise closely with security firms
and police, even if promotions have taken place successfully at the same venue
over a period of time.
They insisted that it is ``essential'' police be present whenever it is
considered necessary, confirming the board regulation that promoters should
always consult their local police force when a tournament is taking place.
Promoters will be told to keep a special watch on security in cases where a
boxer has a following which could produce problems.
Morris said: ``We had a long look into the many aspects of mixed boxing
evenings, which could be difficult to control.''
The board stewards concluded that the section of the audience who had purchased
tickets for boxing only had caused the disturbance, adding that the problem
appeared to have been exacerbated by alcohol.
q LENNOX Lewis's handlers are prepared to guarantee Riddick Bowe, the World
Boxing Organisation heavyweight champion, #6m for a showdown in March or April.
Lewis's promoter, Panos Eliades, will make the offer to Bowe's manager today.
q THE Mike Tyson-Buster Mathis Jr fight, scheduled to go ahead in Atlantic City
on Wednesday, has been moved to Philadelphia on December 16.
The New Jersey authorities ruled that staging the bout in their state would
violate a ban on casinos doing business with Don King, Tyson's promoter, who
has had his license suspended after he had been charged with fraud. The fight
will now take place in the Spectrum arena in Philadelphia.
q JOHNNY Armour retained the European bantamweight title last night when in the
York Hall, Bethnal Green, he stopped Frenchman Redha Abbas with two seconds
remaining of the fifth round.

Judge is
arrested
A JUDGE was arrested last night by the Metropolitan Police, in connection with
allegations of mortgage fraud between 1980 and 1989.
Judge Richard Gee, 53, a Crown Court judge who sits in London, was bailed to
return to Belgravia police station in January, pending further inquiries.
Woman robbed
TWO men, pretending to be water-board employees, stole a three-figure sum of
money on Tuesday from a 75-year-old woman who lives in Marmion Road,
Cumbernauld. Police said the incident was similar to one on Tuesday in
Shawlands, Glasgow.
Hotel man's post
THE Forte group has appointed Mr Jacques Ligne, 47, as general manager of
Edinburgh's Balmoral Hotel. Mr Ligne previously held a similar position at the
Meridien Hotel, Bangkok.
Hospital rise
EDINBURGH Royal Infirmary NHS Trust said yesterday it had agreed a 3% increase
for most of its clinical staff. The money will be backdated to April.
Centre plan axed
STRATHCLYDE councillors have rejected a plan for a mixed retail, leisure, and
industrial development at Newhouse. A report said the development might
indicate a #25m investment and the possible creation of 1000 jobs but this had
to be balanced against likely loss of employment and investment in surrounding
shopping centres.
Man found dead
A MAN was arrested in Edinburgh yesterday after the body of Mr John Clough, 33,
was found in a flat in Peffermill Road in the city. Police said the man would
appear in court today.
Green light
EUROPEAN Commission officials have decided that mushy peas can stay green after
all. They have dropped plans to ban the dye used to give frozen peas their
colour.
Job in store
THE head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch is leaving the force to head
security at Sainsburys, the supermarket chain. Commander David Tucker, 53, will
retire as head of the anti-terrorist branch in January after three years in the
job.
Aids concern
MORE than 250 children contacted ChildLine over worries about Aids, a report
reveals today. Youngsters as young as nine rang the free helpline seeking
advice and help during 1994/5.
Fare deal
A HOLIDAY firm is offering reserved seats on flights to Canada next year for a
deposit of 99p. Bluebird Express is making the concession for bookings made
before December 31. Fares start at #199 for services to three Canadian cities
from Birmingham, Stansted, Gatwick, Manchester, and Glasgow.
Start date
WORK is to start on the #3.8m Roy Castle International Centre for lung cancer
research in Liverpool on January 10. Castle, who died aged 62 in September last
year, devoted his last few months to fundraising for the centre.
Father's victory
PETER Malkin, who served a prison sentence for abducting his son, Oliver, from
his former wife, has won his battle for the right to look after the boy. After
a private hearing in the High Court in London yesterday, a judge announced that
Oliver, 14, would be returning to live with his father following his mother's
death from cancer last month.

Paris
STRIKING French rail unions said tonight they had decided to extend the
crippling protest over government austerity plans into a seventh day.
In Paris, Metro and bus workers also decided to continue their own separate
strike tomorrow.
``Service disruptions should be identical to today's,'' Paris transport chiefs
warned.
Bus and rail services were at a near stand-still in Paris today and motorists
faced massive traffic jams on all main roads into the capital.
Rail travel was virtually impossible across France as the strike continued to
grip in a protest against government plans to trim retirement packages and
encourage greater productivity on the state-owned railway.
The three main rail unions also said they would boycott tomorrow's planned
meeting with management.
Students, on strike at universities across the country amid claims that they
have inadequate resources and too few teachers, also planned more protests for
tomorrow.
Despite the continuing disruption French leaders today vowed to push ahead with
their austerity plans.
``The reforms will take place and the government must stick by the agreed
schedule,'' President Jacques Chirac told a Cabinet meeting.
Underlining the government's determination to cut the huge deficit in the
welfare budget, the Cabinet approved a draft Bill allowing Prime Minister Alain
Juppe to order changes by decree, pending later parliamentary ratification.
``The hour of true reforms has come for France. Putting them off, as we have
for 15 years, would mean accepting a decline,'' Juppe said as he launched a
committee to review retirement schemes.
Fears of changes in a pension scheme which allows retirement as early as 50 are
at the centre of the railway workers' strike.
Workers at the state utility giant Electricite de France-Gaz de France also
called for a strike today, raising the possibility of power cuts.
Manufacturing firms began scrambling for alternative transport, such as barges
and lorries, to keep plants open.
A Peugeot plant in Mulhouse announced that at least half its 11,860 employees
would be sent home on Friday because there was no more room to store the cars
being produced there and no way to ship them.-Reuter.

<TEXT>
WILD boar could soon be roaming free in a Scottish wood, but only for the
hunter's gun.
The animals, which once shared the Caledonian Forest with wolves, lynx, and
beaver, became extinct in this country three centuries ago.
Now a Perthshire businessman intends to reintroduce them in a commercially run
boar forest, which he hopes will attract hunters from all over the world.
Animal rights campaigners are horrified at the scheme, describing it as
barbaric.
The project is the dream of Mr David Hendry, a former undertaker, who owns
Hendry, Ramsay &amp; Wilcox, one of Scotland's biggest hunting, shooting, and
fishing agents.
Next spring, he plans to spend a six-figure sum on 1000 acres of woodland at a
secret Perthshire location, then fence it off, fill it with 30 wild pigs and
hunt the boars for sport.
Mr Hendry sees no problem in reintroducing wild pigs to what was once their
native country and anticipates a great demand for boar hunting.
His wealthy clients are expected to pay thousands of pounds for every animal
they kill. They will sit with high-powered rifles in hides high in the trees
above tracks or feeding places and wait for a boar to wander by. The more
impatient hunters will be able to arrange for beaters to drive the beasts past
their perch.
Boar hunting is very popular in Germany and Poland, where the animal is still
common in places.
Mr Hendry said: ``They will find food where no other animal can so, once we
have bought the wood and fenced it in, they will be relatively inexpensive to
keep.
``The only time they are aggressive is if they are hurt. Then they can be very
fierce.''
Yesterday, Mr John Robins, of Glasgow charity Animal Concern, predicted
widespread opposition to the idea from local farmers and animal rights
activists.
He said: ``We totally oppose this ridiculous scheme. We agree, in principle,
with the reintroduction of some species to Scotland but we will not tolerate
this sort of exploitation.
``To let these animals free in the wild just so that some rich playboy from
abroad can get a kick out of shooting them is a perversion which should never
be accepted in any civilised society.''

A DUTCH KLM plane carrying some of the world's top footballers was forced to
circle over the Siberian border today when it was denied entry to Russian
airspace.
In a bizarre ending to Ajax Amsterdam's win of the World Club title, the
players and 200 Dutch supporters had to return to Tokyo before they were
permitted to resume their flight home to Amsterdam.
KLM officials said the problem was caused by a mix-up over flight numbers which
meant the Russian authorities were not expecting the plane.
The confusion brought the Ajax players back to earth after winning the title
last night in Tokyo, and it also spoiled a huge homecoming party prepared by
fans in Amsterdam.
To add insult to injury, while the winners were marooned on the ground at Tokyo
airport, the team they beat in a penalty shoot-out, Gremio of Brazil, flew home
over them without incident.
``It was all a misunderstanding,'' said a KLM spokesman. However, by the time
it was sorted out, the plane had used up too much fuel circling over the
Russian border to go on and had to return to Tokyo for refuelling.-Reuter.

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth yesterday confirmed The Herald's exclusive
story earlier this week that water-charge increases levied by the three new
public authorities will not be allowed to rise by more than 6% on average next
year.
In a parliamentary written answer, Mr Forsyth said the rate of return the
authorities should earn on the net value of their assets should be 6!s%
annually.
He added that the financial arrangements meant that the average charges need
increase by no more than 6%.
``I invite the authorities to be guided accordingly in finalising their charges
schemes,'' he said.
He also gave details of the relief scheme to help householders with domestic
sewerage charges during the changeover from council control. The authorities
are due to present their schemes to the Scottish Water and Sewerage Customers
Council next month. If they cannot reach agreement, the matter goes to the
Scottish Secretary to be resolved.
Customers Council chairman Dick Douglas said yesterday that without wishing to
prejudge the issue, it seemed unlikely that Scottish customers on average would
face charges much above the rate of inflation.
The restrictions on charges are expected to cause problems for the three
authorities. The chairman of the West of Scotland Water Authority, Mr John
Jameson, has already said it would be ``very difficult'' to make cutbacks when
necessary spending increases had been calculated at 10% to 15%.
Making large reductions in the capital spending programme, he warned could
place the authority in breach of new Government and European Union regulations
to raise standards.

STEVE Watson proved that history can repeat itself with the stunning goal that
ripped the Coca-Cola Cup out of Liverpool's grasp last night and put Newcastle
through to the last eight for the first time in 20 years.
The England under-21 internationalist had scored the last-minute winner to
steal the points when the sides met at St James' Park at the start of the month
and last night he came off the bench for head injury victim Les Ferdinand to
chip home in magnificent style 13 minutes from time.
There seemed little on when Watson received Peter Beardsley's pass 30 yards out
with three Liverpool defenders in front of him. He took an age to ponder his
options as Mark Wright stood off, turning outside and then in before looking up
and spotting David James had strayed off his line.
But from then on it was sheer class, Watson's left-footer arching beyond the
despairing keeper to send the travelling Toon Army into ecstasy and Anfield
into despair.
Tomas Brolin made an impressive debut as Leeds reached the quarter-finals with
a 2-1 win over Blackburn at Elland Road.
The #4.5m Swedish internationalist, who made a brief substitute appearance in
Saturday's Premiership defeat at Newcastle, did enough before being replaced
after 78 minutes to help his new side into the last eight of this competition
for the first time in four years.
Brian Deane scored his third goal of the season and Tony Yeboah produced
another wonder strike to put Leeds firmly in control after just 29 minutes.
But a Gary Kelly own goal just six minutes into the second half condemned Leeds
to a nervous finale and it took a brilliant late save from goalkeeper John
Lukic to prevent Blackburn forcing a replay at Ewood Park.

WOMEN'S GOLF
SCOTLAND'S Tracey Craik made light work of the testing conditions when she
added a round of 72 to her opening 71 to lead the field after the second round
of the 72-hole American Express Tour qualifying school tournament at La Manga,
Spain, yesterday.
With a one-under-par aggregate of 143, Craik leads by one stroke from
Australian Anne-Marie Knight with Tracey Loveys, from Dorset, a stroke further
behind.
It is Craik's second appearance at the qualifying school after a disappointing
run since turning professional in 1989.
Her best year was 1990 when she finished seventh in the Haninge Open in Sweden.
Yesterday, the former Scottish girl champion played impressive golf. She holed
out from eight feet for a birdie at the third hole but missed the green at the
seventh to turn in 36.
Craik was twice in sand to lose a shot at the eleventh but struck a superb
No.6-iron to within a foot of the hole for a birdie at the short twelfth then a
wayward drive cost her the third bogey of the round at the fifteenth.
Once again, Craik bounced back with a birdie at the next hole only to miss a
putt of three feet for another birdie at the seventeenth on her way home in 36.
Leading second-round scores (British and Irish unless stated):
143 - T Craik 71, 72.
144 - A-M Knight (Australia) 75, 69.
145 - T Loveys 72, 73.
147 - E-J Smith 75, 72; I Tinning (Denmark) 71, 76.
148 - R Bates (USA) 75, 73; S Sharpe 72, 76; J Mills (Australia) 69, 79.
149 - D Doniger (USA) 72, 77; S Hanley (USA) 74, 75; H Lee (Canada) 77, 72; S
Melin (Sweden) 75, 74.
150 - F Fehlauer (Germany) 75, 75; M Burstrom (Sweden) 75, 75.
Other Scottish scores: 151 - L Irvine 76, 75; M McKinlay 71, 80. 155 - K Ross
76, 79. 156 - M Wright 78, 78.

<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Kenneth Clarke is forecasting that the economy will grow at 3% next
year, a little higher than the 2.75% he expects this year.
To validate this year's forecast it is necessary for the economy to start
picking up again in the current quarter from the slower growth of the spring
and summer quarters.
A 3.5% rise in consumer spending is to be the engine of next year's economic
growth. The City was sceptical about the strength of his forecasts. The cynics
are arguing that the only way they can be achieved is if Clarke cuts interest
rates aggressively.
The Chancellor defended his forecasts yesterday and denied that they were
dependent on rate cuts. The Governor of the Bank of England might adopt a
different perspective. If the economy is set to grow so strongly there is no
need to cut rates, Eddie George may well argue.
City eyebrows were also raised at the size of the Public Sector Borrowing
Requirement, especially the #22.5bn for the coming fiscal year. Most of the
deterioration in the public finances can be blamed on a #9000m shortfall in the
revenue projections, mainly from value added and corporation taxes. It is not
clear why this should be so if the economy is really set to grow at well above
its trend rate of 2.25% per annum.
James Capel's Adam Cole is suspicious that Clarke has been deliberately
cautious in his revenue forecasts so that he will be in a strong position to
deliver bigger tax cuts in next year's Budget, that is if the Government's
wafer-thin majority lasts that long.
The PSBR forecasts have made it difficult for the Chancellor to engineer a
pre-Christmas cut in interest rates. Sterling has reacted badly to the public
borrowing numbers. So maybe Clarke will have to stay his hand until the new
year. Weak data might be the trigger for lower rates.
Curiously the move by the Halifax Building Society to kick start the housing
market by cutting its mortgage rate by a quarter point could take some of the
heat off the Chancellor.
One suspicion in the foreign exchange markets is that Clarke is not averse to a
deterioration in the exchange rate which would boost activity and help validate
his growth forecasts.
All smiles
ARGYLL'S chief executive, Colin Smith, barely stopped smiling yesterday - and
with good reason. But that meant some deep anxiety elsewhere in the supermarket
sector as the industry increasingly sees dynamic movements that point to
substantial structural changes in market share.
Tesco is continuing to stretch its lead although Argyll's Safeway is now
demonstrably benefiting from the Safeway 2000 programme and Asda performing
much better than would ever seem likely even 18 months ago.
The losers have been J Sainsbury and Kwik Save in the quoted sector and also
the Co-op which has been a soft touch for the last three decades while
Somerfield is showing surprising resilience.
When the Safeway 2000 programme was first launched, there was some cynicism
that this was just a marketing ploy with more noise than substance. However,
there are already tangible results with the most apparent being the increase in
weekly sales per square foot of 7.6% to #13.84 and so well ahead of schedule of
arriving at #15 by 1997-98 even if Tesco and Sainbury have already left that
well behind them already.
The differing profiles of the stores is the major reason with Safeway having a
lower exposure to high-population areas such as the inner M25 orbit. But target
attainment points to an increase in annual profits of well over #50m.
The increase in like-for-like sales of 9.6%, of which 6.7% was volume, reflects
in part the success of the ABC loyalty card which now has a base load of 3.1
million customers. This is costing #7m in start-up costs which will be taken in
the current six months but it apparently requires an increase in sales of just
3% to cover its costs.
Significantly the losers in the volume battles, Sainsbury and Kwik Save, are at
best lacklustre in their enthusiasm for these marketing tools.
There is now the prospect that at long last after five years of flat earnings
in real terms, Argyll will begin to show some performance. An increase in
full-year profits from #375m to about #430m would leave the shares at 319p -
the same as they were six months ago and trading at 12.2 times likely earnings.
The 10% underperformance against the FTSE should now begin to be made up with
sentiment encouraged by a likely 5.1% yield.
Profits flow
GIVEN the public relations fiasco that was Yorkshire Water's handling of this
summer's drought one could have been forgiven for thinking that the financial
performance of the group would have been impaired. But no, taxable profits on
an FRS3 reporting basis actually rose by an impressive 48% to #99.5m.
It is perhaps not surprising that in the current highly-charged political
environment, the company prefers to concentrate on adjusted profit growth of a
lesser 10%.
Yorkshire believes that the profits are good news for customers because a large
chunk of cash is being used for improvement schemes to prevent drought next
summer. There is certainly no shortage of projects to spend the money on, for
instance plugging the pipes which leak a quarter of Yorkshire's water. However,
it is likely to be several years before leaks in the entire network are tackled.
While it is true that the spell of hot weather in the summer was unusually
prolonged it is just not good enough to blame the weather. It provokes the same
level of annoyance as British Rail's excuse of leaves on the line for the late
running of trains.
Yorkshire Water customers pay for a service not for excuses from the board as
to why they have failed to deliver. Its customers still face the possibility of
cuts to their water service on a rota basis from January next year.
It will be interesting to see whether a similar situation occurs if we have a
hot summer next year. In the meantime at least Yorkshire Water shareholders
have something to smile about, the 10% increase in the interim dividend.

DUNDEE, the club who lost in the Coca-Cola Cup final against Aberdeen at
Hampden on Sunday, is up for sale with a price tag of #2.2m.
It is understood that millionaire chairman Ron Dixon, who bought the club
almost five years ago, is ready to walk away from his football investment after
having spent #600,000 to buy the club and adding another #1.5m of a personal
loan to wipe out the debts.
The mysterious Dixon was at Hampden for the final after having arrived back on
Tayside just 48 hours before the game following a near year-long absence. Since
his reappearance, the business community in Dundee has been alerted that he is
ready to sell. I believe that the Vancouver-based Dixon would prefer a deal
which would allow him to retain Dens Park and lease out the ground to whoever
buys the club.
That may be a stumbling block but the news that Dixon is ready to talk business
placed the future of the club in the melting pot once more.
Dixon bought Dundee from Angus Cook after he had become involved initially in
the city when he took over the Dundee Tigers ice hockey team as well as Dundee
ice rink.
The rink was later sold for a supermarket development at a #1.9m price and the
hockey club closed down.
The hopes were that an ice rink could be built at Dens Park and a multi-purpose
sports centre could have been operational. So far, however, all that has
happened is that dog racing has been introduced at Dens and the ice rink plans
have been shelved.
Last night one Dundee businessman said: ``The word is out that the club is
going on the market and the price of #2.2m is being talked about. This is not
the first time we have heard that the chairman would be ready to sell but this
time, with the price tag in place, it seems that he has made up his mind.''
Dixon has always maintained that he would review his own position as owner of
the club after five years in charge. That time limit has almost been reached
and it will be clear to the Canadian that money is not made running a football
club in Scotland.
He has been able to put the club on a reasonably strong financial foundation by
handing the local board members his personal interest-free loan of #1.5m. And,
the team's successful run to the Coca-Cola final has brought in more than
half-a-million pounds to ease the cash-flow problems which afflict Dundee and
so many other clubs around the country.
The Dundee manager, Jim Duffy, has been widely praised by his chairman and
there is little doubt that as well as the Hampden adventure - even though they
did suffer defeat there - the Dens Park side have a group of young players who
will be worth a lot of money in the transfer market, and who look good enough
to carry the team back into the premier division.
In that sense buying the club would look to be a good investment, although any
potential buyer will want to see the stadium as a part of the deal.
Already, of course, Dixon has floated the kite of ``amalgamation'' with local
rivals Dundee United. He did so in a Radio Scotland interview at the weekend,
maintaining, as he has done before, that there is no room in the city - far
less the same street - for the two senior teams to exist side by side.
That is not a view shared by the support of either team, but it gives a guide
as to how Dixon's mind may be working.
Whatever, there is little doubt now that Dixon would like to sell, recoup his
investment, and give himself more time to attend to his other business
interests scattered around the world from Canada to South America to the Far
East.
The problem he faces is trying to convince a buyer that the club, without the
stadium, is worth #2.2m.

DOCTORS responsible for the care of a 52-year-old woman at the centre of
Scotland's first ``right to die'' case risk prosecution for murder or culpable
homicide if they withdraw her life-sustaining treatment.
That possibility emerged yesterday as Law Hospital NHS Trust went to court to
ask that Mrs Janet Johnstone, who has been in a coma since January 1992, should
be allowed to die peacefully, with dignity, and the least possible distress.
The Carluke hospital has decided to seek the guidance of the Court of Session
because the Lord Advocate, Mr Donald Mackay QC, has declined to give an
undertaking that he would not prosecute medical staff if her treatment was
stopped.
The action by the hospital is supported by Mrs Johnstone's family but is being
challenged as incompetent by the Lord Advocate.
It is also being opposed by the guardian appointed by the court to look after
Mrs Johnstone's interests, who says that her condition is stable, that she is
not suffering pain, and that he cannot consent to the proposals to end her life.
Lord Cameron is being asked at the Court of Session to declare that despite Mrs
Johnstone's inability to give valid consent, doctors can lawfully discontinue
all life-sustaining and medical treatment, including artificial feeding,
designed to keep her alive.
The judge was told yesterday that Mrs Johnstone, formerly of Houldsworth
Crescent, Allanton, Lanarkshire, was admitted to Law Hospital in January 1992
after taking a drugs overdose.
She suffered convulsions which caused brain damage and failed to regain
consciousness. She is being fed through a nasal tube and her condition has
remained unchanged, consistent with a persistent vegetative state, although she
does not need help with her breathing.
Five doctors, including Dr Iain O'Brien, the consultant in charge of her case,
agree that there is no realistic hope of recovery or improvement, that
medication should be withdrawn, and she should receive treatment only for the
purpose of allowing her to die peacefully and with dignity.
That position is accepted by Mrs Johnstone's husband, Peter, her daughter,
Linda, and her two brothers.
Law Hospital says the Lord Advocate has not made public any policy he might
have about criminal proceedings against a doctor who withdraws life sustaining
treatment from a patient in a persistent vegatative state with no realistic
hope of recovery or improvement.
In the absence of a public policy statement, the hospital feels that a doctor
faced with a medical dilemma of this kind has no guidance about the risk of
public prosecution.
It says that despite being appraised of the issues raised by Mrs Johnstone's
case, the Lord Advocate has not given any undertaking to refrain from criminal
prosecution if life-sustaining treatment is withheld.
That is why it has felt it had to ask for the guidance of the Court of Session.
The hospital makes it clear that it has continued to provide Mrs Johnstone with
care and treatment for three and a half years, not for medical reasons, but
because of the uncertainty about the legal position.
In his answers to Law Hospital's case, the Lord Advocate accepts that he has
made no public statement relating to criminal proceedings in a case of this
kind.
He argues that the case involves consideration of the criminal law relating to
murder and culpable homicide and the Court of Session, a civil court, has no
jurisdiction to pronounce an order on the discontinuation of treatment.
The curator appointed by the court to look after Mrs Johnstone's interests
points out that when Mrs Johnstone was admitted to hospital in January 1992 she
was conscious and lucid. She was aware that attempts were being made to save
her life and co-operated with them.
He stresses that her condition is stable, that she is well looked after and not
suffering pain, and in these circumstances he does not consider the proposals
to end her life to be in her best interests.
He also takes the view that he cannot consent to anything which would
constitute a potentially wrongful act and might have criminal consequences.
The hearing continues.

TESSA Sanderson yesterday surprised the athletics world by announcing her
intention to make a comeback - but the former Olympic javelin champion's
aspiration of representing Britain at a sixth Olympic Games is not an overnight
decision.
Sanderson, who retired in 1993, had decided as long ago as April 11, when she
requested her name be restored to the list of competitors available for
anti-doping measures. British Athletics Federation information officer Bill
Adcocks confirmed last night that she has been tested since.
``The rules are there to stop people taking a year out of the sport, off the
anti-doping list, and souping themselves up before coming back,'' he said.
Athletes must be on the register for 12 months prior to competing
internationally.
Sanderson, who will be 40 by the time of the Olympics, threw 55 metres without
training during the summer and, though well short of her best of 73.58m set a
year before she won gold in the Los Angeles Olympics, she believes she can win
again.
The spur is the possibility of raising #1m for the charity, Children in
Hospital. Having been approached by Sir Anthony Tippet, the charity's chairman,
she said: ``I will need the support of children around the country to reach our
target of #1m and bring back a gold medal for Britain.''
Thrice Commonwealth champion, and 10-times UK record-breaker, Sanderson has
already represented Britain in five Olympics, a UK record.
There is no prospect of a restoration of hostilities with arch-rival Fatima
Whitbread, who last year announced her intention to return but never went on
the doping register.
Former Sky TV presenter Sanderson lived with TV personality Mr Motivator for
five years, but they have split up. She will also miss the aid of her former
coaches. Wilf Paish, who helped her to Olympic gold, is now working in South
Africa and her other mentor is serving a jail sentence for embezzlement.

A 23-year-old loyalist told a detective how peace talks negotiator Lindsay Robb
handed him two dum-dum bullets, a court heard yesterday.
Mr Alexander Davidson, whose father is a councillor from Broxburn, West
Lothian, claimed that Mr Robb then asked him to take the bullets back with him
to Northern Ireland.
The evidence came on the sixth day of the trial at the High Court in Glasgow of
Mr Robb and Mr Davidson.
They are in the dock with four other men, Mr John ``Jock'' Johnston, 49, from
Laurieston, Falkirk; Mr Francis Hives, 45, of Liverpool; Mr William ``Spud''
McArthur, 41, of Bonnybridge; and Mr David White, 29, of Airdrie.
They deny conspiring to acquire guns and ammunition for the Ulster Volunteer
Force intending to endanger life in the UK and the Republic of Ireland.
Mr Robb, 28, who is from Lurgan, was also alleged to have been the organiser of
a consignment of two guns and ammunition from a Liverpool pub to Scotland.
It was also claimed that while he was a member of the Progressive Unionist
Party taking part in peace talks with Government Minister Michael Ancram at
Stormont earlier this year Mr Robb was also a member of the outlawed UVF.
The allegations about Mr Robb were made in statements alleged to have been
given to detectives by four of his co-accused while they were being detained in
a Glasgow police station under the Prevention of Terrorism Act.
The court has heard that Mr Johnston, Mr McArthur, and Mr White were arrested
by armed detectives after they had been shadowed in a car from the Market
public house in Liverpool to Airdrie last July.
In the back, it was alleged, were a machine pistol and a semi-automatic pistol.
In his alleged statement, read out in court by Detective Inspector Ian Watkins
of Strathclyde Police, Mr Davidson described getting the bullets from Mr Robb
in the Tam Bain pub in Laurieston.
His statement also revealed that Mr Johnston, who was present, talked about
getting two Uzi sub-machineguns for #1800 from Liverpool and having met a
gangster there during his previous visit.
Mr Davidson also claimed that Mr Johnston knew a man who would store them under
his floorboards and Mr Robb said they would go to Northern Ireland but he
didn't know how they would get there.
In his alleged statement, read out by Detective Inspector Douglas Brown
yesterday, Mr Hives, the manager of the Market pub, admitted he took a parcel
containing the guns from another Liverpool man who asked him to pass it to
``Jock''.
The guns were kept overnight in the cellar hidden between two kegs before being
taken taken back to Scotland.
Mr Hives told how Mr Johnston, Mr McArthur, and another man came down to the
cellar to view the weapons.
Earlier, the jury heard detectives reveal the contents of statements given by
Mr Johnston and Mr White.
Mr Johnston said he was a member of the UVF and claimed that Mr Robb asked him
if he could get guns.
Mr White's statement also named Mr Robb. In it, he claimed that as they drove
from Airdrie to Laurieston, Mr Robb told him he was going to ``organise a few
guns for purchase''.
The trial, before Lord Sutherland, continues.

ALEX McLeish has returned to Holland to try and strengthen his injury-hit
squad. The Fir Park manager side's challenge has been undermined by the loss of
more than half the team in recent weeks.
McLeish, who was forced to pull on his boots two weeks ago against Kilmarnock,
said: ``The situation is so bad I cannot afford to wait for it to improve. For
instance, I had to play six juveniles in a reserve game because of the injury
crisis.
``We urgently need new players - particularly a striker - and I have had two
highly recommended to me in Holland. I assessed them both and they have the
quality needed.
``But negotiations are at a very early stage. I do not visualise any
developments before the weekend.''
q.PLANS by Scottish League newcomers Caledonian Thistle to build a 5000-seater
stadium have received a #480,000 boost.
Inverness and Nairn Enterprise yesterday announced the grant, which will go
towards an access road to the new park in the town's East Longman industrial
estate.
The club was formed following a merger between town rivals Caledonian and
Thistle, and a small section of fans are still against the union. But the
team's future hinges upon fulfilling a promise to the Scottish League that they
will be in a new ground by August.
The enterprise company is ready to augment the sum with a further #175,000 to
unlock a much more ambitious #6m development of the entire area, which could
create hundreds of new jobs by providing badly needed new space for businesses.
INE's funding package is conditional on the club securing a #900,000 grant from
Inverness District Council, which will help finance the #4.5m complex.
INE are also seeking incorporation of Inverness into the club's name. The
club's fans have voted in favour of that.
q.DUNDEE'S Morten Wieghorst could be on the way out of Dens Park, but not
necessarily in a move back to Denmark.
The Dane, who signed his latest monthly contract with the Tayside club so that
he would be eligible for last Sunday's Coca-Cola Cup final, has been linked
with a transfer to Brondby.
But there could be moves from several English clubs, including Southampton,
Bolton, Manchester City, and Nottingham Forest, who have watched the midfield
player this season.
Manager Jim Duffy said: ``I have had a couple of inquiries - one from abroad
and another from England - but it has gone no further.''
Meanwhile, Dundee striker Jim Hamilton's booking in the 2-0 defeat by Aberdeen
on Sunday has earned him a one-game SFA ban and he will miss the Tayside derby
against St Johnstone at Dens on December 16.
q. HEARTS goalkeeper Gary O'Connor was last night in signing talks with English
third-division club Doncaster Rovers.

BRITAIN has unexpectedly pulled out of a Council of Europe programme providing
financial support for European film-making.
``During the more than 40 years that I have worked at the council, I cannot
recall a move of this type,'' said the fund's Italian president, Gaetano
Adinolfi.
``Those who will suffer the most from this will be the British producers who
will have a much harder time making co-productions with their European
partners. I love the British cinema and I am sorry they did this,'' Adinolfi
added.
Twenty-three European nations in addition to Britain have been participating in
the programme, Eurimages, which was set up in 1988. Britain joined in 1993.
The fund has paid out #106m to support the production of 422 full-length films
and documentaries. Britain has so far this year contributed about #2.6m.
A total of 56 British films have received subsidies, according to Barrie
Ellie-Jones, Eurimages executive secretary. Recent films supported by the fund
have included British film-maker Ken Loach's acclaimed Land and Freedom.-Reuter.

SPACE-AGE technology is on its way to help farmers combat weeds - by selecting
individual types and the herbicides needed to eliminate them, writes ROY GREGOR.
But until the new technology is cost effective, cereal growers are advised to
continue with conventional control methods and to watch out for cereal
varieties that become less resistant to diseases.
According to Dr Ken Davies, weed specialist at the Scottish Agricultural
College, precision farming is on the horizon. Farm and field plans relayed by
satellite through computers could already assist in management plans for the
application of fertilisers where they were needed, and related systems would
identify weed black spots that needed treatment and which herbicide or
combination would be required, he said.
``Machines are being developed that will distinguish between a crop and weeds
and even different weeds and will combat the problems,'' he said.
But he pointed out that, at present, the information needed for such
high-technology management required farm staff to cover the ground and identify
the trouble areas and the weeds involved. The day would come when machines
might do that - but not yet.
He also warned Scottish cereal growers that there had been isolated areas in
England where the pernicious wild oat weed had become herbicide resistant. ``I
am not panicking but if you have wild oats that you cannot control let us
know,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>Consumers will decide on BST, says Minister Hormone issue one of public confidence</HEADLINE>

THE use of hormones to improve milk yields or provide heavier carcases would in
the final analysis depend on the views of the consumer, Scottish Office
Agriculture Minister the Earl of Lindsay indicated yesterday.
During a visit to the Dairy Scot event at Ingliston, near Edinburgh, Lord
Lindsay said: ``If the use of Bovine Somato Trophin is allowed we must make
sure that consumers out there do not fear for their health.
``The whole industry suffers if we undermine people's confidence in
agricultural produce.''
The milk-boosting hormone BST, which has been licensed in Canada and America,
is not authorised for use in the European Union although the position is likely
to be reviewed next year.
America is considering using the most recent Gatt agreement to challenge the
European ban on imports of food products which include hormone boosters. The
Americans were of the view that the doubts expressed in Europe had no
scientific basis, said the Minister.
``Whatever the scientists say, and whatever the World Trade Organisation rules
and regulations say the reality none of us can avoid is what the consumer feels
is safe - or isn't safe.''
The use of naturally occurring hormones in beef was a challenge facing both
government and the industry, he said. Britain had opposed the European ban
because there was no scientific basis for it but there was a public perception
that hormones were not wanted.
If America won its case, the response of the industry might be to advertise the
fact that North American beef contained hormones but Scotch beef didn't.
Cautioning against such a policy the Minister said that a short-term gain could
be offset by a longer-term danger of casting doubt in the customer's mind about
beef in general. The shopper might decide to buy chicken or fish instead.
At the beginning of the week, however, Sir David Naish, president of the
National Farmers' Union of England and Wales, called for clear labelling of
food from hormone-induced sources so that the consumer had the opportunity to
make a choice.
Alex Brown, chairman of Dairy Scot's management committee and a prominent dairy
farmer, said there was no need to use hormones to boost yields. The dairy
industry had for years promoted milk as a fresh product and should not throw
that away. He was confident of what the consumer would prefer, given the choice.
Earlier Lord Lindsay announced plans for drawing up a code of practice for
specialist cheesemakers in Scotland.
The new code will include guidance on good hygiene practices for smaller
cheesemakers and sensible enforcement practices for local authority
environmental health officers.
The Minister said that the decision to draw up a code should not be regarded as
necessarily related to the case of Humphrey Errington, maker of Lanark Blue
cheese, who has been fighting against local authority attempts to condemn a
batch of cheese from his plant.
The cheesemakers' association had made a case for a more commonsense approach
to the enforcement of hygiene regulations, he said. ``But we know that food,
health and human safety cannot be seriously compromised.''
Some of the cheesemakers were using methods which were hundreds of years old
and there was a remarkably low incidence of human health problems. Some of the
regulations imposed might have been unnecessarily zealous and inappropriate
given the time-span over which these cheeses had been safely eaten.

<HEADLINE>Hospital delay for jail suicide victim Inquiry told how NHS reforms held up bed</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>

<TEXT>
NHS reforms delayed efforts to find a psychiatric bed for a troubled teenager
who hanged herself in Cornton Vale prison near Stirling, an inquiry heard
yesterday.
Prison medical officer Dr Alexander Stuart said a psychiatrist at the jail had
tried to get Miss Arlene Elliot, 17, admitted to Gartnavel Royal Hospital,
Glasgow, after she began hearing voices.
A consultant from Gartnavel travelled to the prison to assess Miss Elliot but
was turned away at the gates because he arrived at 5pm and the jail was closed
to visitors.
Dr Stuart said it was difficut to say what the consultant's judgment would have
been if he had been allowed to see her.
The inquiry heard that there was then a delay finding a bed.
Asked by Scottish Prison Service solicitor, Ms Lynda Towers, whether medical
staff could not have chosen any hospital in Scotland to send her to, Dr Stuart
said he understood their choice was now limited.
He said that, under prison rules, the Secretary of State had to approve the
transfer of mentally ill patients from jail to hospital. His understanding was
that, under the new NHS system, the fact that the majority of inmates at
Cornton Vale came from Glasgow limited prison doctors' choice of hospital.
He said: ``The way the system is operating at the moment restricts us to
Glasgow.''
He said the girl's mental state improved while she was waiting for a bed and
the attempt to have her transferred was cancelled after nine days. She hanged
herself a few weeks later.
Dr Stuart also called for a reform of the way suicide-risk inmates were treated
in jail, with a greater emphasis on therapy.
The hearing is a joint inquiry. Earlier, a prison nurse who failed to spot that
the other hanging victim, Miss Kelly Holland, 17, was a suicide risk despite
interviewing her just hours before she killed herself admitted he had been too
busy to check vital medical records.
Mr William Rock, 46, said he interviewed both girls on their admission to
decide what level of surveillance they should have been put on.
He placed neither on suicide watch but admitted that if he had had time to read
Miss Holland's medical notes he would have put her on strict supervision in a
bare cell with a sleeping bag instead of sheets and blankets.
Miss Holland, of Hamilton, hanged herself with a sheet only hours after Mr Rock
marked her card ``no suicide risk at present''.
Mr Rock, a prison nurse for 22 years, told the inquiry that the sheer pressure
of work when prisoners arrived at the jail every weekday evening made it
impossible to review their case histories. He had to rely on what the girls
themselves told him.
Procurator-fiscal John Miller, who is conducting the inquiry, asked him: ``Did
you have time to read the nurses' notes on Kelly? Did you have time to read the
medical officer's notes on Kelly? Did you have time to refer to anything in the
jail?'' To each question Mr Rock replied ``No''.
He admitted that if he had read the notes he would have discovered Miss Holland
had been placed in top suicide risk category ``SSS'' on three previous
jailings. He admitted that if he had known that, he would have placed her on
SSS again.
Mr Miller asked him: ``Does it come to this - that although the system may be
such that you can take the medical records with you to the screenings, you
don't have time to look at them?'' Mr Rock replied: ``It can come to that.
That's what it came to in Kelly's case.''
In Miss Elliot's case, despite the fact that her medical records revealed two
previous suicide bids, Mr Rock said he had not placed her on strict suicide
watch when she arrived at the jail on May 30.
She did not kill herself until nearly a month later, hanging herself with her
nightie four days after Miss Holland died.
Mr Rock said she had been placed on strict suicide watch because Miss Holland
had been her friend. The watch was taken off again on the orders of the jail
psychiatrist.
The inquiry, before Sheriff Principal John Maguire at Stirling Sheriff Court,
continues.

Srinagar
GUERRILLAS have again sought medical help for four Western hostages in Kashmir,
including a Briton who may be seriously ill.
``The abductors have been trying to get medical aid in south Kashmir for the
last couple of days,'' said an Indian official.
Britons Keith Mangan and Paul Wells, American Donald Hutchings, and German Dirk
Hasert were captured by Al-Faran militants in July while on trekking holidays.
A fifth hostage, Norwegian Hans Christian Ostroe, was beheaded in August.
``We have reports that Hutchings and Wells are seriously ill, and Mangan and
Hasert are suffering from fever,'' said the official.
The Westerners are known to have suffered stomach and eye ailments, and
Hutchings is believed to have frostbitten feet. Al-Faran has sought medical aid
for the captives at least twice during the five-month-old ordeal.
Recently the militants and hostages have descended from high altitude towards
the Kashmir valley as snow has started to fall and temperatures have plunged,
officials said. Al-Faran, a shadowy outfit unknown before the kidnappings, has
demanded the release of 15 jailed separatists including three Pakistanis from
the Harkat-ul-Ansar militant group.
India has refused to bow to the militants' demands and ruled out a rescue raid
for fear of harming the hostages.
On Sunday Al-Faran reiterated its threat to kill all four tourists unless the
government bowed to its demands ``as soon as possible''.
But officials shrugged off the threat, saying it was probably a pressure
tactic.-Reuter.

<TEXT>
TOM Kite was yesterday named as the man who will captain America when they try
to win back the Ryder Cup in Spain in two years' time. And he hopes to be a
playing captain.
The Texan takes over from Lanny Wadkins, whose one match in charge resulted in
Europe regaining the trophy by the smallest possible margin, 14!s-13!s last
September.
Kite, who emerged last week as the front-runner for the job ahead of Larry
Nelson, Hale Irwin, and Ben Crenshaw, has just had the worst season of his
23-year career.
But he said: ``I hope it's just an abberration and that I get my game back in
shape. I would love to be the first playing captain since Arnold Palmer.'' That
was in 1963.
``It came as a big surprise when I was asked to succeed Lanny. I thought there
was a possibility, but, until somebody calls, you kind of pinch yourself.
``Then when it happens it's a kind of out-of-body experience. You keep thinking
`Am I dreaming or is it really happening?' It's the start of a dream come true
and I hope I can bring the cup back.
``I watched this year's match and I was agonising as much as anyone. It was
very stressful watching close friends not perform to their standard. I would
not wish that loss on anybody.''
Nothing should be read into the fact that Wadkins, overcome by emotion during
the closing ceremony at Oak Hill, has not been given a second chance.
America's Professional Golfers' Association have appointed a different captain
for every match since Ben Hogan led them in 1947 and 1949.
In contrast, Europe have had only two captains, Tony Jacklin and Bernard
Gallacher, since 1983.
Seve Ballesteros is expected to succeed Gallacher for the match at Valderrama,
but no decision will be taken at today's meeting of the Ryder Cup Committee in
London and it could be next summer before an announcement is made.
``There's been a lot of speculation about Seve being captain,'' said Kite.
``But whether he is or not I cannot imagine a Ryder Cup in Spain without him
being heavily involved.''
``I have a tremendous amount of respect for him and everything he has done for
golf worldwide. I always enjoyed competing against him because you know you are
competing against one of the best.
``If he is chosen I am sure he will have the same type of attitude for the team
as he has for his own game. He has that little bit of swagger and cockiness.''

Athens
GREEK Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou had another dialysis session today and
was still hooked up to a respirator but his condition was stable.
``In the six hours since the last medical bulletin, the Prime Minister had
another dialysis. His condition is stable and he is breathing through a
respirator,'' said a medical bulletin.
One of the doctors treating him said Papandreou, 76, who had open heart surgery
in 1988, was not suffering heart irregularities.
The Prime Minister was rushed to hospital with pneumonia nine days ago. He has
been breathing with the help of a respirator and a dialysis machine was
replacing his kidneys in filtering his blood.
Hundreds of supporters have gathered outside the Onassis Heart Centre while
dozens of socialist party officials have crowded hospital corridors for news of
his health.-Reuter.

PROSECUTORS have decided against taking action over a father who claimed he
killed his brain-damaged baby to stop her suffering.
Mr Nigel Nelson, 42, of Bournemouth, Dorset, was arrested in August after
giving himself up at Poole police station. He was released on bail.
He had claimed in a newspaper article that he deliberately increased the dose
of diamorphine being given to his seven-week-old daughter, Naomi, as she lay
slowly dying at Poole General Hospital.
The Crown Prosecution Service said yesterday: ``Police have been advised there
was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of a conviction.''
Naomi, who was born by caesarean section in September, 1992, was blind,
probably deaf, could not move any part of her body voluntarily, and had a bowel
defect which meant she was unable to swallow.
Unemployed Mr Nelson, a former electricity meter reader, told the newspaper
that he increased the diamorphine dosage Naomi was receiving because he loved
her and could not bear to see her suffer.
``I helped her to rest in peace,'' he said.

Glasgow, writes Doug Gillon.
However, Europa Cup 400 metres champion Neef's Olympic hopes may be blighted by

US electronics firm Jabil Circuit plans to build a #5m factory in Livingston
next year creating up to 120 new jobs, writes ROBERT POWELL.
Randon Haight, Jabil's vice-president for European business development,
revealed the move in an interview with the trade weekly Electronics Times.
Jabil came to Scotland in 1993, setting up two factories at Livingston and
Bathgate, now employing a total of 600 people making products for the
telecommunications, data transmission and automotive industries.
A rapid growth in sales has persuaded the company to set up a third 10,000
square foot plant in 1996. Two greenfield sites at Livingston have been
identified for the project and planning permission has already been granted at
one of them.
Some of the equipment presently installed at Jabil's existing Scottish plants
will be transferred to the new factory, which will offer increased automation.
Mr Haight said Jabil, which had total sales of $600m (#392m) last year, had
targeted the automotive sector as a fast growth market.
n.FACTORIES owned by foreign companies provided 83,000 jobs in Scotland last
year, more than a quarter of the country's total jobs in manufacturing.
The latest annual statistics on overseas ownership in manufacturing industry
published by the Scottish Office show that 56% of those jobs were provided by
companies based in the US.
There were 357 foreign-owned manufacturing plants in Scotland last year, but
the number of people they employed fell for the second year in a row from
85,000 in 1993 and 84,700 in 1992.
That downward trend looks likely to change, however, following the announcement
of several recent large investments by overseas electronics manufacturers.
The biggest of these was a #260m project to manufacture computer and television
screens in Lanarkshire, announced by the Taiwanese company Chunghwa earlier
this month. This is expected to create 3300 new jobs over the next four to five
years.

THE Safety Case regulations introduced in the wake of the Piper Alpha disaster
are having a ``positive impact'' on the industry's approach to managing safety,
according to a report published yesterday by the Health and Safety Executive.
However, the report, based on five research studies, reveals thataround one
third of offshore safety representatives felt inadequately informed about
safety cases and ``an unexpectedly large minority lacked knowledge of certain
key areas of their rights in relation to safety cases''.
An HSE spokesman admitted this was a generic weakness which they were trying to
address. Last night, the OILC union, which is a constant campaigner for union
representation offshore, blamed lack of training.
The Offshore Installations (Safety Case) Regulations 1992 implement some of the
key recommendations made by Lord Cullen following his investigation into the
1988 Piper Alpha disaster which claimed 167 lives. They require operators or
owners to submit to the HSE a safety case for each installation. All 216 have
been submitted and approved before today's deadline.
The report said there was evidence of significant risk reduction but that it
was recognised the improvement was likely to be because of a combination of
factors. The report estimated that, by the end of this year, the industry would
have spent between #1200m and #1400m complying with the new regulations.
The report acknowledges industry concerns about the complexity of the Safety
Case preparation and assessment and the HSE is exploring with the industry what
can be done to minimise paperwork. It will also consider ways of encouraging
workforce participation.
Last night, Mr John McKinnell, Aberdeen director of the United Kingdom Offshore
Operators' Association, said the industry had made very significant attempts to
involve the workforce and, even before the Cullen Report and Piper Alpha, many
companies had set up safety representative systems.
``Through that experience, one has knowledge of the degree to which you can
involve people in safety discussions and some people are more interested and
more willing to be involved than others,'' he said.
OILC general secretary Ronnie MacDonald said: ``In 1992, in our Safety Case
submission, we said that, as things stood then, the offshore workforce would be
disenfranchised from full participation in the process because the training and
education provisions were wholly inadequate and remain so to this day.''

q UP TO 5500 people are still missing from Srebrenica months after Serbs
encircled and captured the eastern Bosnian town, according to a new UN report.
``The best current estimate of the number of missing is perhaps between 3500
and 5500,'' said the report.
It was requested by the Security Council on November 9 following news reports
of executions, rapes, and other horrors when Bosnian Serbs overran the Muslim
enclave last July.
``This and other reports provide undeniable evidence of a consistent pattern of
summary executions, rape, mass expulsion, arbitrary detentions, forced labour,
and large-scale disappearances. The full horror has yet to be properly
investigated and revealed,'' said Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.

<HEADLINE>Celtic, Aberdeen make major strides this term What a difference a year makes to league positions</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>IAN PAUL</BYLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>
<PAGE>35</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975126628</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
DECEMBER, according to Scottish football folklore, is when leagues are won and
lost, relegation is virtually settled, and all that is left is the minutiae of
prize-giving day.
That may be a touch exaggerated, but it is often the case that before the
chilly finale to the year is complete, positions have been secured or forsaken
which are confirmed at the end of the season.
For that reason it is interesting to note how the premier-division teams have
progressed or otherwise as they move into what might well be the decisive
period of the term as compared with their efforts at the same stage last year.
The interim report card makes fascinating reading and, in a general sense,
shows that the clubs are not only making great efforts to improve upon last
season, but succeeding.
The major strides have been made by Celtic and Aberdeen, who have left their
uncertain form of this time last year well behind and, in fact, are far higher
in the table now.
Celtic, after 15 games, were in an unsteady fifth place in the table in 1994,
having collected 20 points. Now, they are second after the same number of
matches, with an extra 12 points gathered.
A year ago, Celtic were 10 points behind the leaders, Rangers, and virtually
ruled out of the championship race.
This season they are in second place, four points adrift, but very much serious
contenders for the title they have not won since 1988.
The difference in the Parkhead side's fortunes to date, apart from the fact
that they have the assistance of new strikers Andreas Thom and Pierre van
Hooydonk and are obviously playing better, is that, for the time being at
least, they have left behind them the addiction to draws which hampered them
all through last season.
In their first 15 matches then, Celtic had drawn eight times, but this year are
in a little more imposing mood, having reduced that to five.
Aberdeen, whose transformation, or perhaps resurgence, was completed by their
success in the Coca-Cola Cup last Sunday, had been in miserable form at this
stage in 1994.
They had collected only 12 points from their opening 15 games and were
languishing in joint bottom place alongside Partick Thistle.
Oddly enough, both managed to survive, a rare event when in that position at
this stage.
The Dons, aided by the rejuvenation of Eoin Jess and the arrival of Paul
Bernard, have left that alarming time behind them now, having improved to the
20-point mark after only 14 games and fifth spot in the table which promises to
be a good deal better before the end of the competition.
Aberdeen, in fact, are second only to Celtic in the rate of their improvement a
year on but in third place are Rangers, who are six points better than they
were twelve months ago.
Considering that they were top of the table at that time, their progress, at
least on the domestic front, is not good news for their pursuers.
The champions have chalked   up an extra six points in their 15-game run, no
mean feat in a season when Champions' League involvement and injury setbacks
have conspired to make life more difficult.
The downside of the table is demonstrated harshly by Motherwell and Falkirk,
both of whom were going strong at this point last term but have found life hard
so far in the new season.
Motherwell were only two points behind Rangers at this stage last year, with 28
points from their 15 games, and were to go on to keep up that splendid form
almost to the finishing line.
They have been assailed by injury problems this term, with a whole host of
first-team men being ruled out at various stages, and their early hesitancy did
not help their cause.
The Fir Park team are 14 points worse off, with only 14 in their favour so far
and that ought to rule out any championship ambitions this year, but the
anticipated recovery, when the casualty list clears up, could see them in a
chase for a European place.
Falkirk at a late stage last season harboured precisely that ambition after
looking good bets to go down earlier.
Before that, however, they had made an impressive start, with 21 points from
their 15 matches, which compares starkly with the nine to date.
Falkirk, fourth in the table a year ago, now are bottom but they slid from that
lofty perch to become relegation candidates again before jumping back up the
table to the respectable zone.
This season, the change of manager, with all the trauma that surrounded Jim
Jefferies' departure to Hearts, as well as indifferent form to begin with, has
held up their progress but new manager John Lambie has started to get his
message across and there has been improvement.
The Edinburgh sides have made identical, if marginal, moves up the graph, with
each a point better off than last year.
In Hibs' case, that keeps them in the same third place as last season, while
Hearts are two places higher in the table in fifth spot.
Partick Thistle, who performed a memorable escape in the closing weeks of the
season, are three points better off at the moment than at this point last
season, while Kilmarnock, after 14 games, are three points behind their total
of last season.
We should not let this milestone pass without paying tribute to newcomers Raith
Rovers who have not only conducted themselves with some style in the UEFA Cup
but have reached fourth place in the division.

WORKERS at the Clydeside warship builder Yarrow are holding a secret ballot on
whether to follow the recommendation of shop stewards and accept the company's
latest offer on redundancies.
Shop stewards - who have warned that industrial action could have grave
implications for the yard - recommended at a mass meeting yesterday that the
2500 manual workers accept a revised offer of enhanced redundancy terms. The
decision to hold a ballot was taken after a show of hands revealed workers were
divided on the issue.
The result of the ballot, which started yesterday, is expected to be known
today.
Shop stewards said yesterday they were confident that workers - most of whom
are members of the GMB and EEPTU trade unions - would accept the company's
offer but warned that the yard was on a ``knife-edge''.
Any industrial action could jeopardise the chances of securing a
multimillion-pound contract to build up to three Type 23 frigates for the Royal
Navy.
The company announced 415 redundancies in September because of a dearth of
naval orders. The future of about 315 workers still hangs in the balance as the
company waits to hear whether any new orders are in the pipeline.
The Minister for Defence Procurement, Mr James Arbuthnot, is expected to
announce who has won the contract for the latest round of Type 23 frigates in
the House of Commons within the next few weeks.
After yesterday's meeting, yard convener Dougie Conroy said he thought workers
would accept the offer but warned that the Type 23 order could be awarded to
the Southampton-based shipbuilder Vosper Thornycroft if they took strike action
and said such warnings were not scaremongering.
He said: ``Our message to the workers is clear. The shop stewards are
recommending that, in light of the current position the company finds itself
in, they accept the company's latest offer.
``Things are on a knife-edge. If we have industrial action, it is possible that
the Type 23s will go to Vosper rather than Yarrow. If that happens, then the
yard is down the tubes. That is the reality and the workers have to understand
that and we hope they make the right decision.''
A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Defence said yesterday the contract
announcement was due to be made before the end of the year.
Mr Murray Easton, managing director of Yarrow, was not available for comment
yesterday.

reports on the latest round of awards for civil engineering schemes
THIS week saw the Saltire Award for Civil Engineering presented by Rear Admiral
Douglas Dow, director of the National Trust for Scotland, at a ceremony at the
Royal Society of Edinburgh.
The 200 guests were addressed by Professor Tony Ridley, newly appointed
President of the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) and the ceremony was
chaired by Mrs Margaret Street, chairman of the Council of the Saltire Society.
Founded in 1936 by a group of people who wanted to see Scotland restored to its
proper position as a cultural entity, the Saltire Society is concerned with all
things Scottish, past, present and future - its main criteria being the present
and the future.
An apolitical body, the society aims to preserve the best of Scottish
tradition, encouraging new development which can strengthen and enrich the
country's cultural life.
The Saltire Housing Award was begun in 1938, while the idea of introducing an
award for civil engineering in Scotland came from the two local associations of
the ICE.
In response to their request for advice on the mechanics of running an awards
scheme, the society offered to sponsor a Saltire Award for Civil Engineering,
in conjunction with two local associations of the ICE. The purpose of the award
is to recognise and encourage excellence in civil engineering in Scotland, and
an important aspect in judging the entries is the extent to which the projects
advance the art of civil engineering, with separate awards being made for
design and construction.
In 1993, an additional category was added to the awards scheme specifically for
conservation.
Since the competition was first instituted in 1981, and up to and including
last year, nine design and 14 construction awards and two joint
design/construction commendations have been made.

BLACKBURN'S Graeme Le Saux and David Batty, already heavily fined by the club,
were yesterday suspended for two matches by UEFA for their punch-up in the
Champions' League match against Spartak Moscow.
The European governing body had announced earlier that they would take no
action against the England internationalists and Le Saux and Batty were stunned
by a fax which arrived at Ewood notifying them of a dramatic about-turn.
``The news has come as a bit of a shock,'' said chairman Robert Coar. ``All the
statements we had seen said UEFA were not going to take further action.''
The English FA, which had urged UEFA to act against such a bad high-profile
incident, were surprised, but pleased, with the decision.
``We asked UEFA to consider taking action and they have now done so. We
consider this to be the end of the matter,'' said a spokesman.
UEFA spokesman Peter Limacher had said: ``We will respect the referee's opinion
that it is not worthy of further action.'' But then they received the Fair Play
report, compiled by a UEFA official, and quietly signalled that they were
reopening their investigations because of ``new facts.''

TSB Group chief executive Peter Ellwood pledged no branches would be axed in
Scotland next year, as shareholders approved the bank's #16bn merger with
Lloyds.
His assurance follows TSB's closure of some 35 of its Scottish branches this
year.
Addressing an extraordinary meeting in Glasgow, Mr Ellwood said: ``I am very
happy to tell you there will be no branch closures in Scotland in 1996.''
He did not envisage any reduction in the new Lloyds-TSB Group's Scottish
workforce, made up of 3200 employees from TSB and 100 from the ``big four''
bank.
More specifically, he revealed there were no plans to cut the combined
450-strong workforce at TSB's international banking operation in Edinburgh and
mortgage processing centre in Glasgow.
He said the merged operation would retain the commitment to create another 700
jobs at its #17m telephone banking operation in Glasgow, which opened this
year. This currently employs 200 people.
Scotland looks likely to escape most of the #350m of annual cost savings
envisaged by Lloyds TSB by 1999.
However, when pressed by the Banking Insurance and Finance Union (BIFU), Mr
Ellwood was unable to guarantee that there would be no compulsory redundancies
among the banks' UK workforces after the merger.
Earlier, in a carefully phrased statement, he told the meeting he envisaged
``reductions being achieved without the need for any large-scale compulsory
redundancies''.
However, responding to a question from BIFU, he said: ``You ask for an
assurance of no compulsory redundancies. I can't give you that assurance but we
have said many times that, if there is to be a reduction in the number of
staff, we anticipate this will be achieved largely on a voluntary basis and
through natural staff turnover.''
BIFU, which yesterday issued shareholders with leaflets urging them to reject
the merger, claims 10,000 of 90,000 jobs could be axed and 650 High Street
branches could disappear as a result of the link-up.
There was a large security presence yesterday, after a similar meeting held by
Lloyds on Monday was disrupted by environmental protestors.
Lloyds shareholders will receive 2.704 shares in Lloyds-TSB Group for every
Lloyds share currently held. TSB shareholders will own the same number of
shares in the enlarged group as they do in TSB but will also receive a one-off
payout.
However, analysts believe the merger deal is worth less, certainly to private
TSB shareholders, than the current market price per TSB share.
Individuals will receive a special dividend net, at 68.3p. However, TSB's
institutional shareholders, because of their tax position, will receive an
extra 17p per share.
Shares in TSB have rocketed by 48% since the banks announced they were in talks
last month.
Although TSB shareholders could, by selling their shares now, realise more in
cash than the apparent value of their resultant holding in Lloyds-TSB plus the
special dividend, the TSB share price indicates a conviction that the enlarged
operation has good prospects.
The merger, effectively a reverse takeover, requires the approval of the Bank
of England and the High Court, which should have been obtained by December 18.
It should become effective on December 28 and TSB shareholders will receive
their special dividend 21 days later.

THE housing agency Scottish Homes was accused of glossing over Scotland's
housing crisis in its annual report published yesterday.
Shelter Scotland, the housing charity, claimed the agency was doing ``a major
disservice'' to the case for new housing investment by the self congratulatory
tone of its report.
Summing up the year, Scottish Homes said it had exceeded its housing target
and, with a record level of investment of #565m, had provided more than 9000
houses. Around 3000 of these homes had been made possible as a result of the
#184m levered into the agency's own development programme from banks and
building societies.
Scottish Homes also calculated around 3000 jobs were created or sustained each
year as a result of their joint investment activity. In addition, the agency
had helped provide around 2400 houses for homeless people and spent more than
#1m in helping improve the quality of information and advice available to the
homeless.
However, Shelter depute director Kate Caskie said the agency's achievements
should be judged against the scale of housing need in Scotland, not against its
own targets. At least 13,000 affordable rented homes were needed in each of the
next five years in Scotland. Scottish Homes had not even met half of that
target.
So far as homelessness was concerned, Shelter said Scottish Homes had fallen
short of its own target of 2500 homes and had come nowhere near meeting the
real need.
Shelter suggested the agency should re-direct its public-relations efforts into
convincing the Scottish Secretary of the reality of housing problems.

Sarajevo
BALKAN leaders plan to sign a Bosnia peace package in Paris on December 14 as
Nato was preparing to move quickly to send an advance force of around 2600
troops into the country to police it.
The French Foreign Ministry confirmed the signing date today, adding: ``France
hopes that the former Yugoslav republics will use the occasion formally to
extend diplomatic relations to one another.''
The peace deal, initialled on November 21 in Dayton, Ohio, by the leaders of
Serbia, Bosnia, and Croatia, would create a unified Bosnian republic with two
constituent states, one Muslim-Croat and the other Serb.
Thousands of Serbs in the Sarajevo suburb of Ilidza rallied in protest against
the Dayton accord, which would force the former besiegers to loosen their grip
on the Bosnian capital.
In Brussels, Nato diplomats said the Alliance's top policy-making body would
give final approval tomorrow or on Friday for sending in 2600 troops early next
week at the start of the most dangerous mission Nato has yet undertaken.
The body, the North Atlantic Council, would also formally approve deploying a
multi-national force of 60,000 well-armed troops, one-third of them American,
to enforce the peace.
The chief architect of the deal, US Assistant Secretary of State Richard
Holbrooke, said today that the risk to the 20,000 US troops involved was
manageable. ``This is not war. This is not Vietnam. It is not Somalia. It is
not Lebanon,'' he said.
Holbrooke said the presidents of Bosnia, Serbia, and Croatia all ``sent
assurances to President Bill Clinton in writing guaranteeing the safety and
security of American and Nato forces''.
The Republican-led Congress opposes sending troops into what many US
politicians see as a Balkan quagmire.
A top US general said earlier that the rest of the peace force, which would
start moving in after the signing of the accord, should be in place at former
front lines within 30 days.
A 10-member US military team to pave the way for the American contingent
arrived today in the central Bosnian town of Tuzla, the future US contigent
headquarters.
However, as the world rushed to help implement peace, protesting Serbs vowed to
resist the handover of their Sarajevo suburb to Muslim and Croat rule.
Demonstrators strung banners across the road. One five-year-old carried a
placard saying: ``I live here, I was born here, help me please.''
Speakers denounced the peace deal as a betrayal and individual protesters named
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, who negotiated it on behalf of the
Bosnian Serbs, as the principal traitor.
It was the latest in a series of angry but orderly demonstrations encouraged by
hard-line Serb officials, who backed Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic's
demand that the future status of Sarajevo be renegotiated.
The Dayton agreement calls for the Bosnian capital, including the mainly Serb
suburbs, to be unified under the control of the Muslim-Croat Federation.
Karadzic has demanded in vain a Berlin-style ethnic division.
In a letter to US President Bill Clinton today, French President Jacques Chirac
called for guarantees to be given to Serbs in Sarajevo.
``It is out of the question to renegotiate the terms of the agreement
concerning Sarajevo as the Bosnian Serbs want, but it is absolutely essential
that we give the Bosnian Serb population there the guarantees they quite
rightly expect,'' Chirac wrote.-Reuter.

THE spooks took over the fortune-tellers from the boffins last summer, and
concluded it was all hocus-pocus.
For 20 years or so, the Pentagon had employed a team of psychics, costing #7m
over the past decade, to use their paranormal senses to find missing Americans
and divine what secrets were hidden in suspicious foreign buildings.
Then the CIA took over the programme, and soon concluded that it was a complete
waste of money. This is Washington, however, and the Pentagon insists that the
mystics were occasionally useful as sources of valuable military tips.
One participant claimed that the clairvoyants detected a Soviet submarine
programme in 1979 and had also divined the purposes of key buildings in foreign
cities. They were asked to explain the purpose of a suspicious Soviet radar
station in Central Asia and the true function of a Libyan training facility for
the PLO.
The US Coast Guard asked them to locate ships smuggling drugs and the National
Security Council asked them to divine the design of a new Soviet submarine.
Evidently these were not obscure fortune-tellers in a distant corner of the
military establishment, but a proper intelligence-gathering operation in the
heart of it.
There was also a more conventional scientific research project, conducted by
the DIA which usually concerns itself with spy satellites. The clairvoyants
were given offices in a military installation near the Pentagon, and there
exercised their skills at ```remote viewing''. Each psychic would be isolated
in a room and would be asked to select one of four photographs displayed in
another room and decide which was the correct target.
They ought to have guessed right 25% of the time, but some of them managed a
30% accuracy rate. According to the Washington Post, which obtain a copy of the
subsequent CIA report, one of the assessors found that the research showed a
statistically significant success rate. She said it was ``definitely
worthwhile: there is convincing evidence of a real phenomenon here.''
The other assessor was not impressed, however, and the CIA wants to close down
the programme. Eventually it will probably succeed.

BRITAIN's 1300 JobCentres face disruption today as thousands of staff take the
day off in protest at an imposed pay increase of 2.3%.
Talks aimed at resolving the dispute broke down yesterday and the main union
involved, the Civil and Public Services Association, said JobCentres across the
country would be hit along with unemployment benefit offices.
General secretary Barry Reamsbottom accused the Employment Service of being
``hard nosed'' by refusing to pay performance-related increases he said had
been promised to staff.
``Workers feel they have been cheated out of a rise they are entitled to
receive,'' he said, adding that he had left no stone unturned in trying to
avoid the strike, which could have been settled with a small amount of money.
Mr Reamsbottom said despite the involvement of the conciliation service Acas
and an appeal to Education and Employment Secretary Gillian Shephard to
intervene, talks had broken down.
He predicted that the ``vast majority'' of the country's 1300 JobCentres would
close but managers insisted that most would remain open and operate ``as normal
a service as possible''.
A spokeswoman for the Education and Employment Department said:
``We expect the vast majority of JobCentres to stay open. The strike will
achieve nothing as we have already allocated all funds available this year for
paying staff.
``A strike will impact mainly on clients, particularly unemployed people.''
The Employment Service's Scottish director, Mr Alan Brown, said he hoped all
148 offices would be open, with the payment of unemployment benefits given
priority.
The one-day action follows a dispute over new pay levels for clerical and
junior executive staff.

STRONG growth in North America has underpinned a good performance from Tate &amp;
Lyle which is busily expanding its international interests in sugar and other
sweeteners.
Profits rose 23% to #374m before exceptionals in the year to September and
dividends are increased by 11% to 16p after a final of 11p.
The corn sweeteners and starch business in North America saw a 16% increase in
operating profits to #171m, representing just under half the total of #365m
after charging #25.5m of exceptionals. These included #7m of provisions to
cover the closure of the Greenock sugar refinery in two to three years.
Production is to be concentrated at the London site.
Margins of the main company, Staley, were down as a result of a surge in maize
prices but volumes were up and costs reduced. Cane sugar margins were also
lower.
North American profits stood still in the second half and margin pressure is
continuing. Raw material costs have risen by 50% and the industry is waiting to
see if higher prices for sweeteners stick.
Tate &amp; Lyle chairman Sir Neil Shaw believes current year margins overall will
be lower as a result. But he is confident volumes will continue to move ahead
as the US market for sweeteners is expanding by some 5% a year.
Europe made more modest progress, with trading profits up 6% at #144m. The
domestic market was helped by the hot summer and export demand was good,
reflecting a world shortage of quality white sugar. Productivity rose by 4%,
helped by a modernisation programme.
Tate &amp; Lyle is investing heavily in widening its geographical scope,
particularly in developing countries where there is great long-term growth
potential. Investments totalling #142m in the year included cane mills in
China, Mexico, Zambia and the Ukraine, a starch glucose plant in Turkey and a
beet processing plant in the Czech Republic. It has also taken an interest in a
large glutamate factory in China.
Since 1990 a total of #539m has been invested in new projects, of which #129m
has been in developing markets. These have made only a modest contribution to
profits so far, but Sir Neil projects a quarter could be coming from emerging
markets in developing countries and eastern Europe in three years.
In-fill acquisitions are also being made in traditional markets, such as in
cane refining and packing and distribution in the US.
Tate &amp; Lyle shares rose 10p to 454p where they look modestly rated selling at
under 10 times earnings and yielding 4.4%, but the City believes current year
growth could be much less impressive because of the margin pressure.

DEFENDING champion Nick Faldo heads a 12-man field at the Sun City Million
Dollar Challenge, with fellow Britons Colin Montgomerie and Sam Torrance also
chasing the huge rewards on offer at the tournament, which starts today.
Six of the world's top 10 players line up in the Johannesburg event, set to be
the most fiercely contested yet in its fifteen years.
But Nick Price, champion in 1993, believes the reason Sun City keeps attracting
excellent fields is less about money - last place is guaranteed #66,000 - than
the quality of the Gary Player Country Club course.
``Sun City is one of the best all-round tests of golf we play world-wide. It
demands straight driving, precise iron shots, and a nerveless short game,''
said Price, who won the Zimbabwe Open last Sunday.
``If you're going to shoot a low round you have to be aggressive with your
irons, and, with the way the course is set up, that means you're going to miss
a few greens.
``For that reason you have to have utter confidence in your sand wedge and
putter.''
One man happy with his putter at the moment is Torrance. His broomstick secured
second place in the European order of merit this season and, at 42, he is
playing the best golf of his life.
Torrance is a first-time player at the tournament, but has reason to remember
the Gary Player Country Club. In 1981, he walked off the course in contention
after two rounds of the Sun City Classic. He then jumped fully clothed into one
of the resort's swimming pools and did not tee up for the third round. Heat
stroke was the official explanation and the elements remain a factor on a
course where temperatures above 35 degrees are commonplace.
Most of the local money will be bet on South Africa's Ernie Els. Els let Faldo
in by double-bogeying the fifteenth in last year's final round and finished
tied for third.
By his own exacting standards, Faldo has had a modest year - his first as a
full-time player on the US PGA Tour. But he still won the Doral Ryder Open and
finished five times in the top 10, so he cannot be discounted.
Three-times winner David Frost has slipped down the rankings this year. But
Bernhard Langer, champion in 1985 and 1991, has enjoyed another successful
season and has every facet of the game Price says the course requires.
Good summer rains have toughened up the rough and there seems little prospect
of any player challenging Price's remarkable 1993 total of 264, 24 under par.
The field is:
N Faldo (England), N Price (Zimbabwe), E Els (S Africa), P Mickelson (USA), D
Frost (S Africa), C Rocca (Italy), C Montgomerie (Scotland), S Torrance
(Scotland), B Langer (Germany), C Pavin (USA), T Lehman (USA), V Singh (Fiji).

COMPANIES fail to manage for value. A new European research survey published by
KPMG Management Consulting highlights the large gap which exists between
organisations being aware of the powerful Value Based Management tool (VBM) and
implementing it.
While 70% of those surveyed were aware of the concept of economic value, only
8% claimed to have implemented it fully.
VBM influences an organisation's behaviour and decisions. It ultimately acts as
a catalyst in changing traditional attitudes. It can enable management to
transform the organisation into a value based one by:
n.Establishing economic value creation as the governing objective, that is -
and this is one for finance directors - the net present value of its future
free cash-flows discounted at the weighted average cost of capital.
n.Implementing strategies which provide the highest potential value creation.
n.Designing performance measurement systems to monitor value creation (or
destruction) and value drivers.
n.Aligning all management and decision-making processes with value creation,
including, for example, strategic planning, resource allocation, performance
management and employees' remuneration.
The creation of value, together with managing for value, will increasingly
become a principal objective for successful European organisations wanting to
grow in a competitive global market. More and more European organisations claim
to be managing for value but without a clear definition of what it is or how to
implement it.
As a leading proponent of VBM, KPMG carried out research by polling directors
and executives in leading European organisations in a variety of sectors to
establish:
1.To what extent do they manage for value?
2.How do they implement the concept of VBM?
3.What are the results?
Based on responses from more than 450 of Europe's leading companies, the
findings show that in the UK 12% of respondents are true users. This compares
with the European low of only 3% recorded in Germany. The most significant use
of VBM is in the energy, water and construction sectors. The lowest is in the
hotel and catering industry.
Awareness of VBM is high at 70%. But when it comes to implementation only half
(35%) claim to use it at all and less than 10% use it for key business
decisions. This low level of implementation was surprising given the high
recognition of shareholder satisfaction as a key goal.
Of those that had implemented the process 83% claimed that          it had
added value to their organisations. The major bene-fits were enhanced market
value, improved strategic decisions, improved management performance and better
understanding of market forces.
However, a general misunderstanding of how financial markets work emerged. Many
were unaware of how the financial markets value their organisation and still
more were unable to say whether the financial markets fairly valued their
organisation.
Our conclusion was that there is a depressing lack of implementation of VBM and
of those who claim to have implemented it many still do not claim to measure
actual value creation within their organisation.
Until an organisation grasps the nettle of measurement any other actions are
largely irrelevant.
What does this mean for Scottish business? Are you managing for value? What are
the key objectives for your organisation? Those in the survey considered
customer satisfaction the most important objective, with shareholder
satisfaction second. However, those which used real VBM rated shareholder
satisfaction higher than those which did not.
How well defined and implemented are your strategies which demonstrate the
highest potential value? Of those asked 84% said that concentrating on core
activities to maintain profitability fits well with their corporate strategy.
What performance measures do you have to monitor value creation and value
drivers? Organisations use a variety of (often conflicting) tools to measure
performance. At the corporate level profit is the most commonly used measure,
together with cash flow and returns on capital and equity measures. At the
business unit level market share and sales growth are considered more important.
How do you align other management processes, such as executive remuneration,
with value creation? Having a reward structure in place that supports the
philosophy of VBM is important. The long-term perspective of value creation is
not often taken into account in current remuneration schemes.
It is also important to look at how you communicate throughout the
organisation. Have employees at all levels been advised of your priorities and
understand the role they have to play in their achievement?
Clear communication on where your business is going and how you expect it to
get there, linked to well defined roles, are essential in harnessing employees'
understanding and commitment to value creation.
How do you measure up?
VBM cannot be implemented overnight. Implementing it is about value at all

The doctors say their patient should have the right to die. A QC says her right
is to live. Bruce McKain reports on proceedings.
JANET Johnstone could survive for up to a decade if she continued to receive
her present treatment, according to the consultant in charge of her case.
Another doctor told the court that, in his opinion, to prolong her life
artificially would be a form of cruelty to her relatives.
Dr Iain O'Brien, the consultant physician treating Mrs Johnstone, said she was
not in pain and was well looked after by nursing staff.
Mr Colin McEachran QC, appearing on Mrs Johnstone's behalf, asked from whom the
proposal to withdraw treatment had come.
The doctor thought it had been initiated not by relatives but from the clinical
team, probably himself.
Asked whether there had been any input from the hospital administration, Dr
O'Brien replied that this had happened only latterly in dealing with the legal
aspects of the case.
He explained that although Mrs Johnstone was receiving medication, for example
to prevent seizures, the most important aspect would be the removal of food and
water which she was receiving through a nasal tube.
He believed the effect of that would be that she would die from dehydration
within 10 to 14 days.
``Would this cause distress to her?'' asked Mr McEachran. ``I do not believe it
would,'' replied Dr O'Brien.
Mr McEachran then asked why medical treatment should be withdrawn. The doctor
replied: ``From the medical point of view, it has been established that this
lady has no prospects of recovery. She is not aware of her surroundings.
``The medical treatment is sustaining a state of affairs which, I think it is
reasonable to suggest, is not in her best interests and her best interests
would be best served by withdrawing the treatment and allowing her to die.''
It was not known how long she might survive if she continued to be fed
artificially. It could be anything from a month to 10 years.
Dr Richard Metcalfe, a consultant neurologist at Glasgow's Southern General
Hospital, told the court he had been called in to give a second opinion on Mrs
Johnstone.
He had no doubt she was in a persistent vegetative state and, generally in such
cases, if there was no improvement within a year of receiving appropriate
treatment, the prospects of progress were virtually nil.
He was not aware of anyone showing any sign of improvement after almost four
years and supported Dr O'Brien's proposal to withdraw nutrition and hydration.
On the basis that Mrs Johnstone had been in her present condition for a long
period, during which her family saw no prospect of her improving to lead any
useful form of life, he felt that prolongation of life would be a form of
cruelty to her relatives.
Asked about Mrs Johnstone's own interests, Dr Metcalfe replied: ``All one can
go on is one's personal view; what I would want for myself and members of my
family.
``I certainly would not want my own life or the life of relatives to be
prolonged artificially.''

EXCLUSIVE
AN inner-city secondary is celebrating St Andrew's Day by giving each of its
940 pupils a school jumper to extend the wearing of school uniform.
The near #6000 cost has been met out of the proceeds from the school's tuck
shop, which means that the pupils of St Andrew's Secondary in the East End of
Glasgow have received an unexpected bonus from buying food and drinks.
Based on yesterday's reaction, the gift - which has coincided with the school's
as well as Scotland's patron saint's day - has been popular with pupils.
They said it would take the pressure off pupils and parents to conform with the
fashion to wear expensive sweatshirts with branded logos along with the
standard uniform of white shirt and tie and grey trousers and skirts.
The school's catchment includes disadvantaged areas and pupils said the jumper
- or the cardigan which girls could choose - meant that no-one would stand out
because they could not afford a sweatshirt or a school jumper.
Fifth-year pupil Letitia Mclaughlin said: ``It is a good idea. I think everyone
is quite happy with it.''
Mr Bruce Malone, who has been head teacher for four years, believes that school
uniform is one of the marks of an effective school.
He said: ``The school has always had a uniform policy, but it was effective to
varying degrees. Over the past few years it has been worn quite extensively,
although there have been debates about what constitutes full uniform.
``Parents, pupils, and staff generally thought that if there was an appropriate
school jumper it should be worn.''
Uniform promoted uniformity, the identity of the school, pride in it, and
enabled its young people to be seen in the community as pupils of St Andrew's,
said the head.
Providing each pupil with a jumper or cardigan removed the fashion mentality
prompted by the wearing of sweatshirts, and gave parents and young people the
confidence to wear the new top, because they would know that it would be
commonplace throughout school.
Mr Malone continued: ``Putting the whole school in uniform gives pupils
confidence in themselves. It boosts morale and self-esteem. They are coming to
school dressed in a professional way for their work.''

Tutu to head
truth commission
PRETORIA: Nobel peace laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu will head South Africa's
Truth and Reconciliation Commission looking into apartheid-era political crimes
and human rights violations.
The Cabinet approved the 17-member commission, which will have 18 months to
investigate the human rights record of the former apartheid government. It will
have the power to award compensation to victims and grant amnesty to penitent
offenders.
Trial delayed
BANGKOK: The drug trial in Thailand of Britons Sandra Gregory and Robert Lock
failed to go ahead for the tenth time yesterday after an airline witness failed
to appear despite a summons for his arrest. The latest delay means that Miss
Gregory, who has admitted trafficking in heroin, and Mr Lock, who denies the
charge, have been on trial for two-and-a-half years.
Incest pair jailed
OXFORD: A woman and her grandfather who had a 20-year incestuous relationship
were jailed for five years for plotting to kill her husband. The judge in
Oxford, Mississippi, told Teresa Hutcheson, 30, and William Hinson, 71, that it
was ``the most sordid case I've seen, where the great-grandfather is also the
father of his great-grandchildren''.
Four die at polls
CAIRO: Four people, including two elderly women, were killed and scores injured
yesterday as Egyptians voted for a new Parliament. The opposition reported
electoral abuses by police and the ruling party.
Dingo baby plea
SYDNEY: The couple cleared in Australia's notorious ``dingo baby'' case,
Michael and Lindy Chamberlain, are asking the Northern Territory coroner to
rule that a wild dog caused the death of their baby Azaria 15 years ago.
Coroner John Lowndes will give his ruling on December 13.

ST CHARLES: A 64-year-old woman who has worked in a McDonnell Douglas aircraft

Jerry Sue Huellweig, of Missouri, was the single winner of the state's biggest
ever jackpot. She plans to stop work immediately, buy a new house and car, and
share the rest with her family.
Blood taint trial
HANOVER: The co-owner of a German pharmaceutical laboratory went on trial
yesterday facing almost 6000 counts of murder or attempted murder for selling
blood products tainted with the deadly HIV virus. Dr Gnter Kurt Eckert, 55, is
accused of distributing blood plasma which his Aprath laboratory failed to test
for the virus which causes Aids.
Nuclear pact
WASHINGTON: The US has won the agreement of its allies and Russia for a
co-operative programme to prevent the smuggling of nuclear materials. The
programme will be adopted at a Moscow summit in April of the Group of Seven
industrial nations, plus Russia and Ukraine.
Ale and hearty
MOSCOW: Russia's Beer Lovers predicted yesterday that they could pull off a
serious upset in next month's parliamentary election. The party is counting on
widespread disenchantment to win the 5% needed to take up seats in the State
Duma. However party leader Yuri Milyukov feared apathy. ``People might wake up
on election day and ask themselves if they should go to vote or drink beer. I
fear they will choose to drink beer,'' he said.

REPRESENTATIVES of Walter Alexander yesterday handed over 60 ``all-Scottish''
buses to SB Holdings, the seventh-largest bus operating group in the UK, writes
KRISTY DORSEY.
The single-deck buses are part of #21m of orders placed with Walter Alexander
by SB Holdings, operator of Strathclyde Transport, GCT and Kelvin Central
Buses.
Walter Alexander will supply another 150 double-deck buses to SB Holdings in
1996.
The Falkirk-based company builds the bus bodies and installs engines supplied
by    the Volvo Bus plant in Irvine. The total order value of     #21m will be
split fifty-fifty between Walter Alexander and Volvo.
Handing over the buses at Hampden Park, Bill Cameron, managing director of
Walter Alexander, said the SB Holdings orders represented an important part of
the bus manufacturer's business.
``It's obviously a substantial order, and we're grateful they have placed the
order with us here in Scotland,'' he said. ``Our business has grown over the
last couple of years in line with the rest of the industry, and this ensures
current levels of employment, certainly through 1996.''

Railtrack on
whistlestop tour
RAILTRACK directors are visiting Edinburgh and Glasgow this morning to meet
institutions as part of the programme to build up support for the privatisation
the Government plans for next spring.
Privatisation director Richard Aitken-Davies said it would be the most
complicated privatisation to date. At least 51% of the shares will be sold off
- both a UK retail offering and an international book-building exercise are
intended - although the Treasury seems certain to press for a 100% disposal if
that is possible.
Scottish institutions so far have shown only muted interest in Railtrack
because of the paucity of information. Spelling out the future investment
programme, including that for the West Coast main line, and the precise
arrangements with the train operating companies will be major tasks.
Low seals deals
INTERNATIONAL packaging and materials group Low &amp; Bonar yesterday announced a
#3m acquisition in the UK and #7.5m of new investment in Canada. The
Dundee-based group has purchased Ex-Press Plastics, a plastic components
manufacturer, for #3m cash. It will make a further payment of up to #1.3m
according to profits made by the Norfolk firm in the year to November 30, 1996.
The board also approved a C$16.3m (#7.5m) capital expenditure investment to
modernise its production of multi-layered plastic bags in Canada.
Bandt in black
BANDT, formerly Brown &amp; Tawse, returned to profit in the first six months of
the year. It made a pre-tax profit of #1m compared with a previous loss of
#1.2m. Group turnover was #55.7m against #38m last time. There was a useful
#1.6m profit contribution from Kwikform UK, acquired from GKN in July. There is
no interim dividend but barring unforeseen circumstances the board intends to
pay a final dividend.
Directors on mat
RECORD numbers of directors are being disqualified from office, with the
Department of Trade and Industry's Insolvency Service taking action against 258
in the third quarter, a 77% increase on the same period last year. Misleading
creditors, misapplying assets, unauthorised payments to associates, excessive
remuneration or benefits and failure to co-operate with the authorities were
some of the reasons for disqualification.

THE rabbit failed to appear from the Scottish Secretary's hat yesterday,
prompting scorn from his constitutional critics surprised by the lack of the
unexpected.
``I must say, I said to myself: `Is that it? Is that all?' Obviously, he must
have something more substantial tomorrow. He surely must, mustn't he?''
This was the reaction of Canon Kenyon Wright of the Scottish Constitutional
Convention, whose celebration of home rule plans today on St Andrew's Day in
Edinburgh has now become a three-way political bun-fight between
devolutionists, Unionists, and nationalists.
But Scottish Tories liked the idea of a beefed-up Scottish Grand Committee and
felt this gave them a defensible position on the Union which they could rally
round. ``I am very pleased,'' said party chairman Sir Michael Hirst. ``I think
it is a very useful development of a committee that includes every Scottish MP.
``It is fully elected and fully democratically accountable, with the power to
bring to Scotland key Ministers to talk about exclusively Scottish matters.
``When the people see the Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer coming
to Scotland to speak on Scottish issues, they will realise that under
Conservative proposals we have the means to ensure that Scottish affairs get
proper consideration at the highest level.''
Sir Michael delivered a broad hint that there would be no dramatic further
revelations by the Secretary of State today other than the widely flagged
suggestion of a beefed-up Scottish Economic Council to discuss issues and make
recommendations for legislation.
In particular, he dismissed the rumour that a multiple choice constitutional
referendum might be called, saying such a move would be inappropriate.
``I would imagine that the Scottish Economic Council would have the opportunity
to meet and talk about things in advance of them coming to the Scottish Grand
Committee.
``Within such a framework this body of Scottish MPs will be given unique powers
and this confirms that Michael Forsyth has had a very firm claim to be
Scotland's man in the Cabinet - enhancing our place in the Union without a
single penny of the `Tartan Tax' being levied or a single job being risked.''
Despite Sir Michael's enthusiasm, Opposition politicians were jubilant,
convinced that Mr Forsyth had raised expectation far beyond anything he could
deliver.
Apart from Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson's jibe - ``First we had
Taking Stock, now we have Taking the Michael'' - there was a widespread feeling
that Mr Forsyth had overplayed his hand.
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace said: ``I thought he lost heart
halfway through delivering it, as if even he wasn't convinced. I don't think he
expected the hoots of derision he got. The mood was of disbelief bordering on
ridicule. There was just nothing there.
``If anything, he has made things worse by admitting that a democratic deficit
exists. Far from stabilising the Union, he has demonstrated that Scotland is
lumbered with undemocratic structures. There were a lot of hostages to fortune
in that speech.''
STUC general secretary Campbell Christie said his general council had discussed
its suggestions for an enhanced Scottish Economic Council yesterday but he
stressed: ``We see this as sitting alongside a Scottish parliament as a
consultative body. It is not a substitute for a parliament.
``If this damp squib of an announcement is really the best that Forsyth can
come up with then the Government is even more tired and worn-out than we
thought. The people of Scotland don't want more visits by Cabinet Ministers,
they want real constitutional change.''
Canon Wright said: ``The very fact that Michael Forsyth is talking about the
constitution at all is a tribute to the work of the Convention. We have set the
agenda - everything else is a reaction, and nothing at all would have been
offered without us.
``Imitation is the most sincere form of tribute, if not flattery. What was
offered today was a pretty poor imitation. The acid test is whether it proposes
giving real power to the people of Scotland, and his ideas fail this test.''

Q: What is the international arms decommission body?
A: The body which will advise the British and Irish Governments on arrangements
necessary for the handing in of IRA and all other illegally held weapons in
Northern Ireland.
Q: Who will be involved?
A: Three members will sit. It will be chaired by Mr George Mitchell, a former
US Senator and President Clinton's special economic adviser on Northern
Ireland. Two other ``eminent persons'' are expected to be chosen next week.
Q: What do they have to do?
A: The British and Irish Governments have asked them to submit a report by
mid-January. That will follow a series of consultations which will involve
inviting ``relevant parties'' to make submissions on how best to deal with the
issue of decommissioning.
Q: Will it be difficult?
A: Extremely. The IRA and the loyalist paramilitary organisations like the
Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF) will NOT be
helping with inquiries. It effectively means the commission turning to the
likes of Sinn Fein and the small loyalist pressure groups - The Progressive
Unionist Party (PUP) and the Ulster Democratic Party (UDP) to help them.
Sources close to those organisations insisted last night there will be NO
handing over of weapons in advance of any overall political settlement.
Q: How many illegal guns are there?
A: Impossible to estimate. The IRA remains the best armed, with up to 1500
rifles and handguns. They have also some heavy machine guns, rockets, and other
missiles - all hidden in bunkers on both sides of the Irish border.
The loyalists have supplies of high-powered rifles smuggled in from South
Africa. Police believe they have access to Russian-made RPG-7 rockets.
Q: Will the commission consider guns held by the RUC and soldiers?
A: No. Downing Street refused Irish and Sinn Fein demands for ALL weapons to
come under review. There are around 130,000 legitimately held firearms in
Northern Ireland.
Q: Will the commission have any powers?
A: No. It's purely advisory but will make recommendations.
Q: Will the British and Irish Governments have to accept them?
A: No. They will consider them and ``give them due weight on their merits''.
Q: Will it work?
A: The commission has six weeks to come up with a report and recommendations
for the two Governments to consider while preparatory talks continue between
the various political parties.
Those talks are due to finish at the end of February before all sides move into
substantive dialogue on the future of Northern Ireland but only if the IRA
makes a move and some sort of decommissioning gesture.

<TEXT>
SHADOW Chancellor Gordon Brown rounded on the Chancellor last night, accusing
him of taking pounds away in tax rises and giving back only pennies in tax cuts.
Opening the second day's debate on the Budget in the Commons, Mr Brown branded
Kenneth Clarke not a prudent Chancellor but a ``prisoner of the Government's
economic failure''.
Mr Brown said that despite the 1p cut in income tax, people in total were
nearly #700 a year worse off after the 21 tax rises of recent years.
All the tax changes announced on Tuesday were worth little more than #2 a week
to the ordinary family - the price of two or three packets of peanuts.
With rises in prescription charges, rail fares, dental charges and the council
tax ``very few people are better of in any real terms.
Treasury Chief Secretary William Waldegrave said the Budget kept spending down,
kept borrowing on a downward path and protected high priority programmes.
It was ``plausible'' that the average family would gain some #450 a year in
personal disposable income.
Mr Waldegrave warned: ``If we were to find ourselves in this country with a
Labour Government elected on a basis of having promised lower taxes, higher
spending, no theory or ideology of any kind to guide them, no consistency or
plan, they would find themselves in a world where the sound-bite would avail
them nothing.
``It's called the real world. They would be a broken-backed government within
six months, as they always have been before.
For the Liberal Democrats, Malcolm Bruce said: ``This is a cautious Budget
because it had to be.
``The Chancellor knows very well that the economy is very sluggish at the
moment and that the most important thing that is needed is a drop in interest
rates.''

Dublin,
THERE is more of John Major than John Bruton in the twin track policy on
disarmament and political talks in Northern Ireland, according to independent
analysts in Dublin.
With the status of the International Body on decommissioning of arms merely
advisory, Mr Bruton is perceived as having so far failed to persuade Mr Major
to shift from his Washington demand for a handover of some IRA weapons before
political talks can begin.
A phone call from Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams to a television programme in
Dublin saying that he had not been briefed on the deal before Mr Bruton's
dramatic late-night visit to London on Tuesday also has created uncertainty in
staunch republican circles.
The speed with which Ulster Unionists poured cold water on the joint communique
- and their continued demands for a handover of weapons by the IRA ahead of
agreeing to talk to Sinn Fein - did little to inspire confidence that the
communique will meet its aim of all-party talks on Northern Ireland by the end
of February.
The negative Unionist reaction and the muted response from Sinn Fein have
contributed to a public verdict that the communique is more a fudge than a
breakthrough.
In the Dail yesterday, Mr Bruton and his Foreign Minister, Mr Dick Spring, did
not receive the glory and adulation that were heaped upon them earlier this
year after the launch of the Framework Document.
Nor was yesterday a ceremonial day of the kind which greeted former Taoiseach
Albert Reynolds two years ago when he returned from London after signing the
Downing Street Declaration.
There was relief, however, the stalemate had been broken and that Northern
Ireland should be able to enjoy its second violence-free Christmas. The next
three months are seen as either breaking or making the peace process.
If there is an immediate political beneficiary from Tuesday's deal it is the
week's star visitor to the two islands, President Bill Clinton, with both Mr
Major and Mr Bruton basking in the shadow of his lavish praise of them as
risk-takers for peace.
Mr Reynolds, now a parliamentary back bencher since his loss of power almost a
year ago, is in no doubt that the deal was a command performance for Mr Clinton.
While welcoming the need for ``something which will inject new life in a
process which had been flagging for some time'', Mr Reynolds was surprisingly
critical of his former counterpart, Mr Major.
He noted that Mr Major's insistence of a handover of some IRA arms as a
precondition of talks was ``unacceptable and unobtainable''.
Mr Major was looking for surrender and was pursuing a militaristic rather than
a political approach, he said.
According to Mr Reynolds, the American president had never accepted that arms
should be decommissioned in advance of talks.
Mr Reynolds suggested that President Clinton's ``own man'' - former senator
George Mitchell who will chair the international body - might come up with a
set of proposals to let the British Government off the hook on the arms issue.
Mr Reynolds said he was sure President Clinton realised that the British
Government's attitude on this was the stumbling block for the last nine months.
In a spirited defence of the communique as providing a new political dynamic in
the peace process, the Justice Minister, Mrs Nora Owens, claimed that the Irish
government had secured more than it would have if the British-Irish summit had
gone ahead in September.
The main difference, she argued, is that the international body examining the
issue of decommissioning will be able to make an independent assessment of the
situation.
Long after President Clinton's visit, the paramilitary arms question will
continue to be what Mr Reynolds calls the stumbling block.
Newspaper coverage in the Irish Republic was generally favourable to the
initiative, which was seen as adding to the political stock of both Mr Bruton
and Mr Spring.
Giving the statement ``a hearty but cautious welcome'', the Irish Times
identified the co-operation of Dublin and London as its core principle.
``Without it, the many uncertainties lying ahead have no solution,'' it said,
summing up the mood in Ireland.

UNEMPLOYED people will lose their benefit if they refuse to take part in a new
training scheme due to be launched next year, it was disclosed yesterday.
The #12m Project Work programme, which will be tested in two areas from April,
will be aimed at people aged from 18 to 50 years old who have been unemployed
for more than two years.
Employment Minister Eric Forth made it clear yesterday that people who withdrew
from the programme without good cause, or who refused to take part at all,
would lose their benefit.
The new scheme would offer a programme of structured help in finding a job as
well as practical work experience, he said.
Jobcentres were placing a record number of people in work and the stock of
vacancies was growing, Mr Forth said..
However, he added: ``The long-term unemployed can be at a disadvantage in the
job market because they lack motivation or confidence after being away from
work.''
Everyone taking part in the new scheme would receive help and advice
appropriate to their needs, and would have their job-finding skills sharpened.
``But we will expect something in return. Most long-term unemployed want to get
back to work and will value the help this scheme gives,'' he went on.
``Some, however, may have no intention of finding work. Anyone who refuses to
enter, or drops off the work experience programme for no good reason, will
normally have their benefits stopped.''
The Education and Employment Department said the type of work experience
offered could include painting and decorating, construction and gardening work.
TUC secretary John Monks said the new programme was unlikely to help many of
those struggling to get back to work.

Belfast,
THAT air of blase irritation which so often hangs around great events has
already settled on Belfast, as the city anticipates the first visit in history
of an American president.
Opposite City Hall, a stranger up from Dublin approaches a newsvendor with a
question: ``What night does your man switch on the Christmas lights?''
With a look of feigned wonder and fatigue, the vendor demands clarification
before entering substantive talks: ``What man do you mean, exactly?''
The stranger considers his position and replies: ``Your man, Big Bill, of
course.''
And the vendor answers: ``Och, that man! Sure, it's tomorrow night around tea
time. But you haven't a chance of meeting him because they'll be 70,000 lining
up in Donegall Square to do the same. And not a bus or taxi to be had in the
town.''
Traffic chaos is a mandatory consequence of all US presidential tours, and
given Northern Ireland's long experience of sealed-off streets and body
searches, the Province should be better able than most places to cope with such
annoyance. But 15 months of peace can play remarkable tricks with memory. As
soon as ordinary folk really began to believe that the ceasefire was no
mischievous ploy, it seemed the Troubles had ripped apart some far-off planet.
In contrast to the predictable rant of politicians, the people of Belfast and
Derry have revelled, this past year, in a social rebirth as bombs have given
way to boom.
``The people are actually ahead of the politicians on this one'', says a
shopkeeper on the Ormeau Road, where Hillary Clinton visits a community centre
today. ``You won't find us talking about the nuts and bolts of the latest
proposal because we're all far more interested in the reconstruction package
Bill Clinton will be bringing with him.''
Nevertheless, that Christmas booty, estimated to be in the region of $200m,
remains dependant on an overall peace settlement which partly accounts for the
high drama telephone calls and late-night dashing between Dublin and London
this week.
At the Europa Hotel, the advance party of the Flying White House are already
installed. So, too, is a shoeshine stand, the first of its kind in Northern
Ireland, which is situated just inside the foyer, a prime photo opportunity
site.
A few streets away workmen complete the presidential podium outside City Hall,
its shield of bulletproof glass having been specially flown in from Washington,
as if Belfast knew nothing about protection.
It will be from this vantage-point that Bill Clinton will illuminate the city's
festive decorations, an entourage of curious, razzmatazz diversity arranged
about him. Paul Newman will be there in his role of philanthropic
internationalist. So will some of America's key industrialists and Belfast's
own great unifier, the rock musician, Van Morrison.
Meanwhile guests will be taking up their positions inside the Whitla Hall of
Queen's University. The Secretary of State's reception could be the trickiest
event of the visit, as Northern Ireland's leading politicians desire to be
present but some nurse stern pledges about never being seen in the same room
together.
So, will David Trimble, leader of the Unionists, find himself reaching towards
the same tray of canapes as Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams?
Will President Clinton finally shake Adams by the hand? If he does, it is
likely to be well out of sight of the media. But the fact is the two pressed
the flesh some time ago at a St Patrick's Day party.
Clinton's gesture then was a gamble. In many ways it is still a gamble today,
but despite that blase irritation, Northern Ireland will rise to the occasion
and give its American visitor some special hoopla of its own.

<HEADLINE>Civil Service unions fear more Scottish Office redundancies</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>CALUM MACDONALD</BYLINE>

CIVIL Service unions claimed yesterday that Scottish Office staff are facing a
further 400 redundancies, on top of 1000 jobs already expected to be lost over
the next three years.
They said the deeper cuts - which could include compulsory losses - were the
price of Tuesday's Budget announcement, in which Chancellor Kenneth Clarke
outlined the Government's determination to reduce public expenditure.
Details of a 5% cut in running costs were given yesterday to the leaders of the
Civil and Public Services Association, the National Union of Civil and Public
Servants, and the Institute of Professionals, Managers and Specialists.
All staff also received a letter from Sir Russell Hillhouse, permanent
secretary at the Scottish Office, in which he says: ``The policy of having to
cover cost increases through efficiency savings will continue.''
He admits the Scottish Office's 5% cut will mean, after inflation is added, an
8% reduction in costs.
In his letter, Sir Russell says: ``Savings of this order cannot be achieved
without further reductions in total staff numbers. It is very much hoped that
these will be achieved through voluntary means, though there are specific areas
where this may not be possible.''
Final details of the redundancies are likely to emerge early in the new year.
The Scottish Prison Service has been exempted from any cuts.
Mr Michael McCann, Scottish officer of the CPSA, said the unions had estimated
about 1000 jobs would be lost because of the previous cutback, which was 14% of
running costs. The new reduction would mean at least a further 400 lost posts
out of the total complement of 5500 staff.
He warned the figure could rise even higher if non-staff savings could not be
made in Scottish Office expenditure.
Labour Employment spokesman John McFall said the decision to cut more jobs was
further evidence of Mr Forsyth's ``callous disregard for employment in
Scotland''.
THREE thousand temporary jobs in the voluntary sector will be lost as a result
of the Government's decision to cut the Community Action programme for
long-term unemployed adults, according to the Scottish Council for Voluntary
Organisations. (writes Elizabeth Buie).
Community Action, introduced in 1993, is delivered through the Employment
Service and offers temporary work opportunities to adults unemployed for more
than six months.
The move, announced on Tuesday, has angered voluntary organisations which
deliver Community Action, particularly as the Chancellor did not refer to the
move in his Budget statement.
Mr Ian Brown, enterprise and training officer with SCVO, said: ``Kenneth Clarke
barely referred to unemployment in his statement, but Employment Service
officials were press-releasing Community Action's obituary before he had even
sat down.''
Community Action providers said the programme was popular with long-term
participants and that its wide range of projects benefited the community.

PRESIDENT Bill Clinton hailed the ``extraordinary relationship'' between
Britain and the United States yesterday as he made a historic address to both
Houses of Parliament.
Mr Clinton and his wife Hillary were welcomed amid pomp and pageantry to
Westminster by the Prime Minister and Commons Speaker Betty Boothroyd.
Arriving to a fanfare of trumpets he addressed a packed Royal Gallery in the
House of Lords, where the guests included former Prime Ministers Lady Thatcher
and Lord Callaghan.
After being formally welcomed by the Lord Chancellor Lord Mackay of Clashfern,
Mr Clinton said to laughter: ``I look out and see so many of your distinguished
leaders in the House of Lords and I think it might not be a bad place to be
after a long and troublesome political career.
``I have been here to Westminster many times before. As a student I visited
often and over the last 20 years I have often returned.
``Always I have felt the power of this place, where the voices of free people
who love liberty believe in reason and struggle for truth, have for centuries
kept your great nation a beacon of hope for all the world.''
Mr Clinton described Parliament as a ``monument to liberty'' and recalled its
role in opposing the tyrannies of earlier times.
``As one whose ancestors came from these isles, I cherish this opportunity.
``For a long time, I thought if my forebears had not left this country perhaps
I might have gotten here on my own, at least to the House of Commons.
``But now our American television carries your question time and I have seen
Prime Minister Major and Mr Blair and other Members slicing each other up face
to face with such great wit and skill against the din of cheers and jeers, I am
now convinced my forebears did me a great favour,'' he said to laughter.
President Clinton said that in this century, Britain and America had overcome
their differences, rediscovering their common heritage and shared values.
This month's remembrance of the two world wars had recalled how the two nations
had fought together.
In the Second World War, the troops had neither failed nor faltered, he said:
``In the greatest struggle for freedom in all of history, they saved the
world.''
Now the countries together were preparing the way for peace in Bosnia, ``where
your peace keepers have performed heroically and saved the lives of so many
innocent people.
``I thank the British nation for its strength and its sacrifice through all
these struggles and I am proud to stand here on behalf of the American people
to salute you.''
He continued: ``In this new era, we must rise not in a call to arms but in a
call to peace.''
This time was full of possibilities . The ``chasm of ideology'' had
disappeared. Much more of the world now shared the ideals that the US and
Britain had fought for.
In Europe and many other nations, long-suffering peoples at last controlled
their own destinies, and economic freedom was spreading with political freedom,
bringing renewed hope for a better life, rooted in ``honourable and healthy
competition of effort and ideas'', he said.
President Clinton said: ``America is determined to maintain our alliance for
freedom and peace with you, and determined to seek the partnership of all
like-minded nations to confront the threats still before us.''
The President turned to the end of the Cold War, claiming that the world had
``stepped back from the nuclear precipice'' with the extension of the Nuclear
Non-proliferation Treaty and next year's expected Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
``For the first time in a generation, parents in Los Angeles and Manchester
and, yes, in Moscow, can now turn out the lights at night knowing that there
are no nuclear weapons pointed at their children.''
On Northern Ireland, Mr Clinton said that the American people felt ``a special
gratitude for your efforts'' in the Province.
President Clinton said: ``With every passing month more people walk the streets
and live their lives safely, people who would otherwise have been added to the
toll of the troubles.''
He said that today he would ``have the privilege of being the first American
President to visit Northern Ireland''.
He added that it was ``a Northern Ireland where the guns are quiet and the
children play without fear''.
President Clinton said he applauded the work of Mr Major and Irish Prime
Minister John Bruton in setting up the new twin-track peace initiative, ``an
initiative which provides an opportunity to begin a dialogue in which all views
are represented and all views can be heard''.
President Clinton declared: ``This is a bold step forward for peace. I applaud
the Prime Minister for taking this risk for peace.
``It is always a hard choice, the choice for peace, for success is far from
guaranteed and even if you fail there will be those who resent you for trying.''
To loud applause, he insisted: ``But it is the right thing to do and in the end
the right will win.''
Mr Major, sitting next to Mrs Clinton in the front row, was seen to mouth the
words: ``Thank you.''
President Clinton went on to dismiss those who argued that the West could relax
now that the Cold War and other troubles were over.
He urged vigilance, saying: ``These are the siren songs of myth.''
President Clinton referred to movement towards isolationism in the US after the
First World War and the supporters of appeasement in the run-up to the Second
World War.
``We have gone down that road before, we must never go down that road again,''
he said. To applause, he added: ``We will never go down that road.''
President Clinton said: ``We must help peace to take hold in Bosnia, because so
long as that fire rages at the heart of the European continent, so long as the
emerging democracies and our allies are threatened by fighting in Bosnia, there
will be no stable, undivided, free Europe.''
Britain and America had a responsibility to answer the request of warring
parties in Bosnia to secure peace.
``Without our leadership and without the presence of Nato there will be no
peace in Bosnia.
``I thank the United Kingdom that has already sacrificed so much for its swift
agreement to play a central role in the peace implementation.
``With this act Britain holds true to its history and to its values. And I
pledge to you that America will live up to its history and its ideals as well.''
President Clinton then declared, to warm applause: ``Friends, we have stood
together in the darkest moments of our century. Let us now resolve to stand
together with the bright and shining prospect of the next century.
``It can be the age of possibility and the age of peace. Our forebears won the
war, let us now win the peace.''
`Our American television carries your question time and I have seen Prime
Minister Major and Mr Blair and other Members slicing each other up face to
face with such great wit and skill . . .'
`For the first time in a generation, parents in Los Angeles and Manchester and,
yes, in Moscow, can now turn out the lights at night knowing that there are no
nuclear weapons pointed at their children.'

HOUSING benefit changes affecting young people would have ``malign
consequences'' with some driven into ``inadequate, unregulated and potentially
dangerous multiple- occupancy dwellings'', Labour spokesman Chris Smith said in
the Commons yesterday.
He was questioning Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley on welfare changes
announced in the Budget.
Mr Lilley angrily rounded on Labour MP Dennis Skinner (Bolsover), who said
reducing the level of benefit available to under-25s would increase the number
of young people on the streets who could be preyed on like the victims of Fred
and Rosemary West.
The Minister said that even by Mr Skinner's usual standards, that was ``a
distaseful attempt to exploit a ghastly tragedy for party political ends.''
He said benefit would be limited to the average cost of shared accomodation in
each locality. It would discourage unemployed younger people from leaving home
before they could afford to do so. It would also reduce the attraction to some
of moving to seaside resorts.
Mr Lilley also told the Commons that the Government is to devote extra
resources to fighting benefit fraud.
An additional #134m will be invested in sophisticated computer systems and
other checks to counter false claims.
Mr Lilley said that the reforms he had introduced to the social security system
would deliver a saving of #3.5bn next year - #500m from the current package -
which would grow to #5bn by the end of the century and save #15bn in the next
millennium. The expansion of the anti-fraud campaign should save #2.5bn by
1998-99, he added.
Mr Smith attacked the decision for the second year running to increase the
non-dependent part of housing benefit which he said would encourage families to
eject adult children from the family home. ``And this is the party which is
supposed to be in favour of keeping families together,'' he said.
The freezing of one-parent benefit hit at one of the few remaining benefits
which provided ``a genuine bridge into work,'' he said. The raising of
thresholds for people seeking long-term residential care was welcome but would
still leave most elderly people fearing they would have to sell the family home
to meet care costs.
When he sat down, Mr Lilley said ``You have just chalked up a bill of #1bn in
savings forgone.'' He told Mr Simon Hughes, for the Liberal Democrats, who
complained that the pensioners' #10 bonus had not been increased for 23 years:
``We are in serious government and we cannot afford to hand money out like
confetti.''

<TEXT>
THE Government was urged by Labour MP Tam Dalyell last night to question the
reported findings of a key FBI officer in the Lockerbie bombing inquiry who,
the MP said, was currently under investigation for allegedly falsifying
evidence in another case.
Mr Dalyell (Linlithgow) named the officer as Thomas Thurman in the Commons as
he referred to the case against two Libyan suspects wanted for the bomb attack
on PanAm Flight 103 which resulted in the deaths of 270 people in December 1988.
Claiming that the credibility of the Government's case was in doubt, he said it
focused on a timing device which allegedly linked the Libyans with the bomb.
However, Mr Dalyell said he did not believe the timing device existed and there
was now doubt over the evidence of the FBI officer said to have identified it.
He told the House: ``Thomas Thurman, the FBI officer who has claimed to have
identified the timing device, is under investigation by the US Justice
Department into allegations by a fellow FBI officer, Frederic Whitehurst, that
he fabricated the evidence and committed perjury in a murder trial in the US.''
Mr Dalyell called for the case against the two Libyans to be heard in the Hague
before a Scottish judge and under Scottish rules of evidence.
However, Home Office Minister of State Jeremy Hanley ruled out a trial for the
Libyan suspects in a third country as ``unacceptable and unworkable''.

Belfast,
IT will be a day to remember for the people of Northern Ireland but will
anything have really changed when it is over? That is the question which looms
over the historic visit of President Bill Clinton to Belfast and Londonderry.
This morning, Air Force One will touch down at Aldergrove Airport and Mr and
Mrs Clinton will step out into a Province that has never before had a visit
from a serving United States President. The ramifications of 24 hours in
Northern Ireland are central to political stability as well as the prospects of
foreign investment n a part of Europe with an unenviable economic record.
Until the eleventh hour, it appeared the President's day in Northern Ireland
would be clouded by political deadlock. But somehow in the darkness of Tuesday
night, Prime Ministers John Major and John Bruton came to what has been
described as an agreement to differ.
One word dominated political debate yesterday - fudge. Once again, as has
happened in the past, the British and Irish Governments have composed a
document which is far from clear-cut in its meaning and has won both support
and criticism from Unionists and Nationalists alike.
In Belfast yesterday, Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble and the Sinn Fein
president Gerry Adams appeared to have something in common at last. Both shared
a degree of suspicion about what Mr Major and Mr Bruton had produced. Indeed,
of Northern Ireland's five major political parties, only two - the moderate
Alliance and the nationalist SDLP - seem prepared to take a positive,
enthusiastic line.
For most people, however, the fact that anything had been cobbled together in
advance of President Clinton's visit was enough to make today's great occasions
in Belfast and Londonderry all the more memorable.
After 15 months of peace, Mr Clinton will find that Northern Ireland has barely
left base camp in terms of making any political progress towards a permanent
settlement of its divisions. The communique issued this week from Downing
Street is not seen so much as a breakthrough as simply a means of moving a road
block further along the torturous path towards any settlement.
The crucial question of what to do about terrorist arms and explosives remained
unanswered and simply postponed for another day. This week's agreement between
London and Dublin on a way forward looks to be based more on hope than on any
realistic prospect of the log-jam being broken.
The Northern Ireland peace process, which began with the euphoria of IRA and
Loyalist ceasefires, has slowed over the months and is now set in limbo until
well into the new year.
The Unionist demand that IRA weapons be handed over remains unanswered. Sinn
Fein's demand that the British Government sets up round-    table talks is also
set aside.     Instead, the latest Downing Street-Dublin formula offers another
breathing space during which it is hoped such vital issues can be addressed
again.
The Americans' involvement deepens, not only through the President's visit
today, but even more so in the appointment of former Senator George Mitchell to
chair the international body which will examine the decommissioning of
terrorist weapons.
Mr Mitchell has an unenviable task of consulting all the parties about how they
see the decommissioning question and of also producing a report by mid-January
for the British and Irish Governments. Somehow, he has to indicate convincingly
that there is a clear commitment on the part of those in possession of arms,
the IRA and Loyalists, to permanent peaceful means of attaining their political
ends.
Realistically, many people in Ulster are starting to doubt whether arms and
explosives will ever be handed over by terrorists. Indeed, the best London and
Dublin may hope for is that by next year the issue will not loom as large in
the minds of Unionists as it does today and that they may be more willing to
sit down to talks with Sinn Fein.
As of now, there is nothing to suggest that will be the case with Mr Trimble
saying Mr Major and Mr Bruton had failed to deal properly with the arms issue,
and the Rev Ian Paisley even more sweeping in his condemnation.
But, if Unionists are unhappy and suspicious, so too are the followers of Mr
Adams. Yesterday, he, too, expressed his suspicions about the new proposals
which clearly do not meet Sinn Fein's key demand for round-table talks now.
Observers in Belfast feel Mr Adams is under increasing pressure from rank and
file republicans who claim that 15 months of the IRA ceasefire have won
insufficient concessions from the British Government and who threaten a return
to violence if a breakthrough is not achieved soon.
A restraining influence on their tempers must be the attitude of the US and,
significantly, President Clinton is placing great emphasis on getting Sinn Fein
and the IRA to support the new decommissioning approach.
Two hundred years ago, many founding fathers of the US hailed from
Ulster-Scottish origins and carried across the Atlantic the mark of defiant
independence. In Belfast today, Mr Clinton could well feel that history has
come full circle. Despite his plea for peace, he will find that the Ulstermen
of today still have a mind of their own.

EIS begins
fight against
funding cuts
SCOTLAND'S biggest teachers' union yesterday launched a campaign against
underfunding in education which, it said, was the Number One issue facing
schools, colleges, and universities.
Mr Ronnie Smith, general secretary of the Educational Institute of Scotland,
said the fact that 5000 teachers had signed a petition for a special union
conference about the impact of funding cuts indicated there was growing
resentment about the direction the service was taking.
The meeting, which is to be held next month, is expected to hear calls from the
hard left for the EIS to take industrial action against underfunding generally
or, as seems more likely, to support lecturers facing compulsory redundancy in
further education colleges.
Mr Smith, whose union represents eight out of 10 teachers, further education
lecturers, and academics in the new universities, said resources would be a key
issue in the General Election campaign.
The union said underfunding underpinned many of the problems confronting
education: crumbling schools, bigger class sizes, curriculum innovations,
attending to the individual needs of pupils, and the drive to improve standards.
The EIS said there was growing evidence that teachers were coming under
pressure to take classes with more pupils than the legal limit: 33 from primary
one to second year in the secondary sector; 25 for composite classes comprising
different age groups; 30 for third to sixth years; and 20 for practical
subjects.
However, more teachers were finding themselves on the ``slippery slope'' of
bigger classes because of the greater use of emergency provisions which
increased the limit to up to 39 pupils.
The EIS is commissioning research to establish the scale of underfunding. It
said the new unitary councils would have to find more than #200m in savings,
and #40m for education alone, to maintain services at present levels.
The union predicted that more than 600 teaching posts would disappear in the
current financial year.
Mr Smith has asked Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth whether any of the
additional #878m earmarked for schools in the Budget would come to Scotland.
The Scottish Office Minister for Education, Mr Raymond Robertson, said local
authority current expenditure had been treated very favourably. ``I do not
therefore believe there should be any need for cuts in essential services such
as education as a result of next year's settlement.
``There is undoubtedly some scope to make efficiency savings but if there are
to be cuts in education services, they will be as a result of decisions at the
local-authority level,'' he said.

THE President of the most powerful nation on earth spoke unto the Parliament of
a quaint, slightly dotty great-aunt yesterday. He wore a suit; she wore a very
big wig, lots of gold leaf and waved a number of funny sticks about. He spoke
of peace and destiny; she listened politely and offered him tea with the Queen.
By the strict standards of the Clinton White House, the Royal Gallery of the
Palace of Westminster is not a politically correct place. Although smoking is
not permitted, the glorification of dead, white, imperialist males certainly
is.
A panorama scene of the death of Nelson faces a mural of Wellington at
Waterloo. The whole is framed by acres of gilt paper of the Royal Tandoori
Gallery school of interiors.
The strict timetable detailing when to enter, when to stand, and when to blow
trumpets required peers, MPs, and other witnesses to this footnote of history
to turn up an hour before the Clintons .
Most arrived in identifiable batches - out-of-favour Shadow Cabinet,
second-rank Unionists, old Liberal Democrats, young Labour on the make. Those
who arrived singly were either disgraced Tory ex-Ministers, Michael Howard, or
Margaret Ewing, in a painfully obvious yellow jacket.
We stood to allow the Speaker and the Lord Chancellor to advance into the room,
preceded and followed by their various rods, caps, chaplains and other
hangers-on in skirts. We all sat down again, except for Lord Mackay and Miss
Boothroyd, who chatted away about problem students and where to get cheap gold
braid.
A fanfare announced the arrival of the President, escorted by men in tights,
men in anoraks, and the High Keeper of the Saxophone. He was introduced to Mr
Major, which must have puzzled him as only moments before he had emerged from
two hours of meetings with a man who looked suspiciously like the Prime
Minister.
The Lord Chancellor welcomed him and tried to interest him in a cloak and wig
for his Vice-President. Mr Clinton had more selfish ambitions. All that ushing,
rodding and privying of the House of Lords had made an impression. How he
wished the United States could boast a similar institution: ``It might not be a
bad place to be after a long career''.
Out of concern for the sensitivities of our Yankee cousins, the large portrait
of George III has been discreetly hidden behind a photographers' perch. But not
the enormous painting of gorgeous George IV: throughout his address, Mr Clinton
was faced by a man of many mistresses, who inhaled at every opportunity.
Mr Clinton's speech was a reminder of the skill that made his candidacy in 1992
a triumph of style over substance. There was nothing new in what he said, but
my, how he said it.
The generous words flowed, warm and comforting like a sea of stickiest Arkansas
molasses. Mr Major lapped them up, relieved that that awkward misunderstanding
over Tory help for the George Bush campaign three years ago was apparently
forgotten.
Here instead was Mr Clinton praising his management of the Ulster peace process.
Mr Clinton received an enthusiastic sitting ovation. He was thanked by Miss
Boothroyd, who quoted Thomas Jefferson's spine-tingling words of the
Declaration of Independence, that ``all men are created equal'', as a model for
modern democracies. And, with a flick of her gold trim in Hillary's direction,
she added: ``I only have one criticism to address across the centuries to Mr
Jefferson: all men?''

THE choice of Mr George Mitchell to chair the International Commission seems,
in hindsight, almost inevitable.
For a start, giving the job of chairing the commission to one of President Bill
Clinton's key advisers ties the White House firmly into the peace process.
There are differences between London and Washington, as the President made
clear yesterday when he refused to back the British position that the IRA must
start to hand over weapons before Sinn Fein can join all party talks.
But that is no surprise and does not mean he will not exert pressure in private
on the IRA and Sinn Fein.
The President, who was energetically reasserting the existence of the special
relationship yesterday when he spoke to both Houses of Parliament, is desperate
for diplomatic triumphs.
Given the strength of the Irish-American vote in the United States, the
temptation to meddle in Northern Ireland has always been overwhelming and his
Irish visit, to Belfast today and Dublin on Friday, was regarded with deep
suspicion in London.
But the agreement announced late on Tuesday by Mr John Major and Irish Prime
Minister John Bruton has changed all that. The President now goes not to meddle
but to urge the case for peace and the international commission. He has
something to ``sell'' which both London and Dublin are behind.
Mr Mitchell's suitability for his new job is beyond question. His personal and
career credentials are impeccable.
He is of Irish origin and a Catholic. His father, who was adopted by a family
called Mitchell, was a Kilroy.
Considered in the US as being ``Irish to the core'', he has vast political and
legal experience.
As President Clinton's special adviser on ``economic initiatives in Ireland'',
he already knows everyone who matters there, is aware of what the problems are,
and has been to see the situation for himself. The learning curve for the new
commission will, therefore, be short.
His appointment should also help silence some of the more militant, and all too
often ignorant, Irish American voices which back the IRA and Sinn Fein
regardless.
The other two members have yet to be appointed but it is pretty clear where the
Government will be looking. What is needed are a former Commonwealth statesman
and a leading European figure, genuine outsiders, probably politicians although
not necessarily, who have an interest in peace in Northern Ireland. The
important thing is that they are not seen as having anything to do with the
British Government.
During his 14 years in the Senate, Mr Mitchell took a deep interest in Irish
affairs and was associated with the so-called Friends of Ireland, although not
so prominently as Senator Edward Kennedy. In December 1993, he was one of the
signatories, along with Senators Kennedy, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and
Clairborne Pell, of a solemn appeal to ``all those who have relied on bullets
and bombs in the past - lay down your arms''.
He also made a point of meeting Irish political leaders as well as
representatives of smaller Irish interest groups, and was a leading supporter
of the American Ireland Fund.
Ironically, while in Belfast earlier this year when he had talks with a
cross-section of political opinion, both Unionist and nationalist, he said he
had no intention of becoming involved in the political aspects of the current
negotiations. In a sense, he now has become involved, because what the
commission achieves is vital to progress.

THE Royal Mail yesterday closed a strike-hit delivery office because of
``unruly and violent'' picketing.
The office at Hamilton is the only one in Scotland where staff remain on strike
after last week's walkouts by 5000 postal workers crippled services.
The other postal workers called off their unofficial action after a peace deal
on Sunday.
Hamilton had been the only office where the strike had been official. However,
the 70 staff there remain out in a local row over a newly promoted line
manager, Mr Gordon Johnson.
As part of the peace deal, union officials at Hamilton claim they were told
that Mr Johnson would be moved. They believe him strongly linked with
management's drive to change working practices and ultimately cut jobs.
When the nightshift arrived for work at midnight on Monday they found Mr
Johnson was still there.
However, if there had been any violence it had to be laid at the door of a
Royal Mail manager who had nearly run over two strikers on the picket line,
according to Mr Tam McHugh, the local representative of the Communication
Workers' Union.
Mr McHugh said: ``Only yesterday one postman was struck by a van driven by a
manager.''
The Royal Mail said it had been forced by picketing to close the office until
further notice.
Mr Alex Gibb, delivery director for Scotland, said: ``The intimidation of staff
and managers who are merely trying to maintain a modicum of service for
customers in extremely difficult circumstances is unacceptable.
``We will no longer be able to open the inquiry office for customers coming in
to collect their mail.''
CWU divisional representative George Robertson said: ``There has been no
violence. This is typical Royal Mail; they are overreacting.''
Meanwhile, Royal Mail chiefs were accused of trying to ``strangle in red tape''
attempts to give short-term loans to postal workers suffering financial
hardship caused by the recent strike.
The CWU claims that a #25,000 benevolent fund run by the workers and management
in East and Central Scotland should be used to pay out cash to struggling
postmen.
Management said any recommendations on pay-outs should be made by experienced
and trained welfare officers who also give debt counselling. It was this
procedure which could cause some delays.

AMERICA is to name a destroyer after wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill.
President Clinton said the decision was to honour the Second World War alliance
between Britain and America .
He said: ``When that ship slips down the ways in the final year of this
century, its name will ride the seas as a reminder for the coming century of an
indomitable man who shaped our age, who stood always for freedom, who showed
anew the glorious strength of human spirit.'' The 9200-ton USS Winston
Churchill will be the 31st of the Arleigh Burke class of destroyers.

<HEADLINE>MP eyed up men in gay pub, libel case jury is told</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>975126666</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A FORMER parliamentary reporter saw Tory MP David Ashby eyeing up young men in
a gay pub, a libel case jury heard yesterday.
Mr Andrew Pierce, a journalist from the Times, saw Mr Ashby, 55, in the Queens
Head in Tryon Street, Chelsea, on the evening of December 14, 1991, Mr Richard
Hartley QC, told the High Court in London.
Mr Hartley, for the Sunday Times, said Mr Pierce would say in evidence that Mr
Ashby, MP for North West Leicestershire, was in one of London's ``oldest and
best-known gay pubs'' between 8.30 and 9.30 that night.
His statement included the comment that Mr Ashby was having ``as little success
in the bar as he did in the House''.
Mr Ashby is suing the Sunday Times and its former editor, Mr Andrew Neil, for
libel over an allegation that he was homosexual.
The MP said it was perfectly clear to him from Mr Pierce's statement that the
journalist was a ``particularly cruel and unpleasant man''. He had the
``misfortune'' of having met Mr Pierce last month at the publication party for
Matthew Parris's book, Great Parliamentary Scandals, in which Mr Ashby featured
as a result of the current court case.
The MP said he was in his constituency that Saturday night, having travelled up
to Ravenstone on the Friday and returning on the Sunday.
He denied that he and his wife were leading ``very separate lives'' in 1991 and
that he told her to mind her own business when she asked where he was going.
Mr Hartley produced Mr Ashby's Members' car allowance document - used by MPs to
claim mileage for journeys to their constituencies and back to Westminster -
which he said recorded a claim for a journey by Mr Ashby and his wife from
London to his constituency on the weekend of December 6-9, 1991.
Mr Hartley alleged that not only was this entry false but also the entry for
the following weekend was also false, because Mr Ashby's wife's diary showed
she was abroad for that entire period.
Mr Ashby is claiming damages over a story published in January 1994, which said
he shared a double bed with a man friend during a holiday in Goa in 1993.
He says the article alleged that he was a homosexual who had misled his wife,
Silvana, from whom he is now estranged, about the nature of his sexuality; that
he had lied to the public about having an affair with a Dr Ciaran Kilduff; and
that he was a hypocrite in emphasising the importance of the family in his last
election address.
Times Newspapers and Mr Neil deny libel, although they accept that Mr Ashby did
not holiday with a man in Goa. They assert that he was and is having an affair
with 32-year-old Dr Kilduff.
The hearing continues.

Museum in drive
to keep pistols
ABERDEEN University's Marischal Museum is trying to prevent two rare
seventeenth-century Scottish snaphaunce belt pistols being sold abroad.
The museum has raised #76,000 so far towards the price of #88,000. Fine art
dealer Peter Finer, of Shipston-on-Stour, Warwickshire, has put the sale of the
pistols on hold while the museum tries to raise the remaining cash.
Emu venue
A POULTRY farmer is to bring emus to Scotland. The flightless native Australian
birds, along with other exotic species including kiwis and ostriches, are
expected to attract tourists to Collessie Farm Park, in Fife, which is due to
open in spring.
Drugs charges
A MAN has been reported to the procurator-fiscal after cannabis plants were

He first arrived as a student, returned as a Governor, and yesterday visited
Britain as the most powerful man on earth. Elizabeth Buie traces the itinerary
of Bill Clinton as he rubs shoulders with royalty and commoners.
BILL Clinton has returned to Britain many times since his student days at
Oxford, but his first presidential visit was marked by formal pomp and ceremony
and meetings with commoners and the Queen.
The presidential flight, Air Force One, carrying the world's most powerful man,
touched down at Heathrow at 7.05am, marking the beginning of a three-day State
visit to London, Belfast and Dublin.
From then on it was red carpet treatment all the way.
The president's first official duty was the laying of a wreath on the tomb of
the Unknown Soldier, in Westminster Abbey.
To shouts of ``Hi, Bill'' from a group of a dozen American tourists holding up
signs declaring ``We love Clinton'', and ``California loves Clinton'', his
cavalcade swept into the Abbey.
Then, thanks partly to the new-found climate of security engendered by the
peace process, Mr Clinton and Mr Major braved the drizzle to walk from
Westminster Abbey to Downing Street.
They were accompanied by an entourage of around 80 security men, some 100
American journalists, and a horde of British reporters. A helicopter whirred
above them.
As he entered Downing Street, Mr Clinton was met by a crowd of around 300
schoolchildren from three London schools. He shook almost every child's hand.
One onlooker, Colette O'Hart from Ireland, seized the opportunity to ask Mr
Clinton if he planned to play any golf.
``I asked if he was going to Ballybunion in County Kerry to play golf,'' she
said.
``He said he was very sorry and that because of the Bosnian situation, he could
not.''
Shortly before, Mr Clinton had picked out a group of Jubilee Line construction
workers for a chat.
Paul Wydenbach, 28, from Swansea, said: ``I just shouted out `Hi there Bill,
how are you doing' and he came over and shook my hand and said `How are you?'.
He had a good firm handshake as well.''
America's First Lady, Hillary Clinton, met a group of prominent British women
at the US ambassador's residence, among them Education and Employment Secretary
Gillian Shephard and Baroness Tessa Blackstone, the Labour spokeswoman on
foreign affairs in the House of Lords.
In a curiously-worded list of those attending issued by the US Embassy, it was
noted that local government official Sarah Ebanja came from south of the Thames
``where most persons of color live''.
Meanwhile, Mr Clinton was engaged in two hours of intensive talks in Downing
Street, before telling a news conference of his appreciation and admiration for
John Major's courage in taking a ``risk for peace'' in Northern Ireland.
Shortly after midday, Mr Clinton, accompanied by his wife, addressed both
Houses of Parliament in the Royal Gallery of the Palace of Westminster amid
images and reminders of Britain's past power and pageantry. Among the listeners
was the former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
At 2pm, a secret serviceman touched his ear and spoke into his sleeve. The
President of the United States was about to arrive at Buckingham Palace to meet
the Queen.
From a black armour-plated Cadillac limousine, Bill and Hillary Clinton stepped
on to the steps of the Grand Entrance. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh
exchanged handshakes with their guests.
Originally, the president was to have had lunch at the Palace, but that had to
be cancelled. So it was an ``audience'' in the classical splendour of the 18th
Century Room, with a view over the palace gardens.
The Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, and the Clintons sat on a settee and chairs
upholstered in matching French silk, overlooked by three-quarter length
portraits of King George III and Queen Charlotte, and paintings by Canaletto
and Gainsborough.
Members of the White House press corps, bussed into the Palace in two coaches,
looked on, snapping pictures and scribbling notes for consumption back home.
By 4pm, it was time to return to politics - this time a meeting with Labour
leader Tony Blair at the US ambassador's residence.
The pair discussed Northern Ireland and Bosnia and the role of ``progressive''
political parties in bringing about change.
Hillary Clinton also met Mr Blair briefly, after reportedly asking to see him.
By evening, the president and his wife had changed into evening dress for a
formal dinner and reception at No 10.

MOTORISTS in the more populated areas of Scotland could benefit from a petrol
price war which is set to flare with the announcement yesterday that some
retailers plan to hold fuel at pre-Budget prices.
However, as the battle continues to dominate the petrol forecourts in urban
Scotland, it appears that, once again, rural drivers will be the losers as the
3.5p a litre (15.9p a gallon) duty increase imposed by Chancellor Kenneth
Clarke on petrol and diesel will almost certainly become effective in their
area.
Shell, the UK's second largest petrol retailer, confirmed yesterday that it was
setting no time limit on its price freeze. Tesco and Sainsburys said they would
not raise prices until Monday. Asda has also confirmed it will sell off
existing stocks of petrol before deciding on its next move.
Shell, which says it sells unleaded for as little as 48.9p in places, says it
will monitor the reaction of rivals and raise prices only if necessary.
Meanwhile, Esso, the UK's largest petrol retailer with 2100 service stations,
said it would remain competitive with rivals who choose not to implement the
Budget increase.
A spokesman said: ``Where local competing petrol stations throughout the
country keep petrol at pre-Budget prices we will remain competitive with them.''
A spokesman for BP, the third largest petrol retailer in the UK, said it
planned to implement the increased duty at midnight last night but insisted
that its prices would remain competitive.
The Office of Fair Trading confirmed that it had received a complaint from the
Petrol Retailers' Association, which alleged that Esso had acted in a predatory
manner by selling petrol at ``possibly below cost price'' as part of its
Pricewatch campaign in parts of Scotland and north-east England.
The association has expressed fears that Esso's practice could force some
smaller petrol retailers out of business.

LOTHIAN and Borders Police, embarrassed by a break-in at their headquarters
three years ago, yesterday were investigating a listening device found
broadcasting from their control room.
Last night, however - with the incident being described as ``Fettesgate Two'' -
a senior police official said: ``This is not a case of breach of security.''
He denied there was any danger of sensitive material being received by possible
listeners but admitted: ``We are aware of the matter and it is still being
investigated.
``It appears that this could result from part of our own equipment left in the
control room.''
The incident is thought to have been detected earlier this month, with senior
police officials immediately ordering an investigation.
They moved in swiftly to set up the inquiry, following increased surveillance,
installed after a break-in at their headquarters at Fettes when confidential
documents were said to have been stolen.
It was claimed yesterday that police officers had picked up messages from
colleagues in their operations room, where telephone calls were being taken and
radio messages were being relayed.
q.During a murder inquiry interview in Fife several years ago, police launched
a similar investigation, in which it was alleged that details were picked up by
a radio ``ham'' when a police radio was left switched on.

A DRUGS dealer promised to pay a detective thousands of pounds if the policeman
passed on information about him, it was claimed in court yesterday.
The High Court in Aberdeen was told Ronald Cormack offered Constable Neil
Cooper a one-off payment of #4000, plus a further #200 a week.
Mr Cooper, 36, of Springdale Road, Bieldside, denies corruptly accepting #6000
and other unspecified sums of money from Cormack in return for providing him
with police intelligence and movements.
He also denies two charges of defeating the ends of justice, including tipping
off Cormack and an associate, Mr Ian Smith, about police interest in them.
Mr Smith, 32, a former barman, told the court he had been approached by Cormack
to see if he could arrange a meeting with Mr Cooper.
``He wanted Cooper to watch his back, to tell him if there was any mention of
his name at the police station,'' said Mr Smith.
The court has already heard that Cormack was jailed in May for 17 years on
drugs-dealing and firearms charges.
Mr Smith said Mr Cooper agreed to the meeting, and the two were then picked up
by Cormack in his car in Union Street. This was in 1993.
Mr Smith said Cormack asked if Mr Cooper would give him information about his
name being mentioned at police headquarters in connection with drugs activities.
Mr Cooper, he said, asked Cormack how much the information would be worth.
He claimed Cormack replied: ``#4000 and #200 a week.''
He told the court the men agreed the deal and Cormack then gave Cooper a white
plastic carrier bag which Mr Smith thought contained money.
He said later that day Cooper had come to his house and handed him #1100.
``He gave me the money and said, `There you go,' then left. I was expecting
something for setting up the meeting,'' said Mr Smith.
Mr Smith said his involvement as an intermediary came to an end when he failed
to pass on the first payment of #200 to Cooper.
Under cross-examination, Mr Smith admitted he had given Cormack false
information, saying his phone was tapped, claiming it had come from Mr Cooper,
in order to get money.
The trial continues.

SINN Fein leader Gerry Adams will be told by President Clinton in Belfast today
that it is now his turn to take a ``risk for peace''. This follows two hours of
talks with Mr Major yesterday and a combined will to put pressure on the IRA.
The president said in Downing Street yesterday after congratulating Mr Major
and the Irish Premier John Bruton on their new peace initiative: ``My message
to the IRA is that the twin-track process has provided a mechanism for all the
parties honourably now to bring their concerns to the table and be heard. In
the end, peace means peace and we are all going to have to support that.''
Mr Clinton had praised Mr Major and Mr Bruton warmly. ``I can't say enough to
the British people how much I appreciate and admire the Prime Minister in
taking this kind of risk for peace. This is not an easy action for him to take,
not an easy action for Prime Minister Bruton to take.''
The late-night deal struck on Tuesday by Mr Major and Mr Bruton seems to have
caught the Sinn Fein leader off guard.
He complained that he had not been consulted but throughout the day yesterday
he seemed to be softening his attitude after the tripartite solidarity of
London, Washington, and Dublin. He declared that the agreement was a ``fudge''
but added that his party would approach it in a positive way.
There was no sign, however, that he would enter talks with the pre-condition
the IRA must make a start to handing over weapons.
Today in Belfast, the British and Irish Governments are looking to the
President to pressurise Mr Adams.
The excitement for his visit was rising last night, heightened by a bomb alert
which closed part of the street in Belfast where Mr Clinton will stay in the
Europa Hotel tonight.
Army bomb disposal experts were sent in after a passer-by spotted a suspicious
package close to a Shell filling station.
Such excitement aside, Mr Clinton is expected to meet all the party leaders
during his historic visit.
The Ulster Unionists are still deeply suspicious of the deal done with Dublin.
Mr David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, at one point described
Mr Major's behaviour as ``shameful''. The deal meant only that the
decommissioning of arms issue was not resolved but simply delayed. ``The
essential issue is that there must be decommissioning and there will be no
talks with Sinn Fein until that happens.''
Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, said: ``We
don't want to be packaged along with Sinn Fein in a twin-track process.''
However, there were signs last night that the Ulster Unionists may change their
attitude after the Prime Minister's statement in the Commons. Neither Mr Bruton
nor
himself could make peace in Northern Ireland: only the political leaders there
could do that, he said.
``If the people of Northern Ireland, who have shown great courage, can find a
similar courage in all their political leaders - courage and determination to
banish the old enmities - then I believe, in joining in these discussions, they
can provide a more secure future for Northern Ireland than it has ever known in
the past.''
The Unionists are calling for an election in Ulster for an assembly to
establish democratic authoritity for the various parties in the sure knowledge
that they can out-gun Sinn Fein easily in any vote.
The Prime Minister pleased them in the Commons yesterday by seeming to give
this idea encouragement: ``Negotiating a constitution will not be easy. I am
open minded . . . I can see the advantage for some political parties in this
idea; I can see an elected assembly, not to govern Northern Ireland but to
produce nominees to negotiate constitutional matters for Northern Ireland.''
Throughout the day, Mr Clinton was lavish in his praise for the Prime Minister
and Mr Bruton, who had taken this ``risk for peace'' in agreeing a three-strong
international body headed by US Senator George Mitchell to explore how the
paramilitaries might hand over their weapons and the timing of their doing so.
The twin-track proposal approved by the Irish Parliament yesterday and all
sides in the Commons allows for Sinn Fein to be involved in exploratory talks
while this process is going on. Senator Mitchell is asked to report to both
Governments by mid-February.
Mr Major and Mr Bruton still disagree on a vital point. Mr Major insists that
Sinn Fein cannot be involved in constitutional talks until some significant
move has been taken by the IRA to decommission its explosives and heavy weapons.
The Irish Premier believes this condition is not attainable but the two have
agreed to let the new initiative go forward.
The big risk for Mr Major is that the independent body will come down on
Dublin's side of this argument.
Mr Major insisted yesterday that Senator Mitchell's recommendations were only
advisory.
The president emphasised that the role of the US is to promote peace but not
get involved in detail. ``The United States, whether in the Middle East, Bosnia
or Northern Ireland, is trying to support reasonable peace processes, not to
dictate terms or make decisions.''
Privately, he backs Mr Major's line that the IRA must start to hand over their
guns.
Today in Belfast and later in Dublin, Mr Clinton is nevertheless expected to
tell Mr Adams and his supporters in the Dublin administration that Sinn Fein
must now make up its mind to support this new initiative and impress upon the
IRA that if it fails the blame will fall on them.
The president is known to be impatient with Mr Adams and the IRA since he
defied his own state department and the British Government in granting Mr Adams
a visa for the US and permission to raise funds there again.
Meanwhile, Northern Ireland is bracing itself for chaos today during Mr
Clinton's visit.
Roads will be closed, schools shut, some offices empty for the day, and Belfast
city centre jammed when tens of thousands of people are expected to flock to
the City Hall to watch the president turn on the Christmas tree lights.
A security operation involving almost 3000 members of the RUC and more than 100
American Secret Service agents has been set up to protect Mr Clinton during the
24-hour trip.

A REFUGE for mentally handicapped people run by the Roman Catholic Church has
been forced to close after a ``campaign of terror'' against residents and
staff, it was claimed yesterday.
Bricks were thrown through refuge windows and residents suffered persistent
physical and verbal abuse, including threats ofrape and stabbing.
All 10 residents of the refuge in Whitelaw Street, Maryhill, Glasgow - who were
rehoused from Lennox Castle Hospital north of Glasgow about five years ago -
have been temporarily accommodated in other parts of the city after the
Archdiocese of Glasgow decided on closure.
The archdiocese, which operates a number of refuges in the city, said residents
and staff had been ``under siege'' for several weeks and were moved for their
own safety last month when the situation became intolerable.
It is believed to be the first incident of its kind in Scotland since the
Government introduced the Care in the Community scheme in the late 1980s.
The archdiocese said yesterday that residents and staff had suffered the
attacks over a six-month period. The refuge was closed on October 10 as the
trouble escalated.
The worst incidents included:
q A knife being pulled on a voluntary worker at the refuge.
q A female member of staff being threatened with rape.
q Residents having stones thrown at them and being called derogatory names
relating to their condition.
q Stones and bricks being hurled through windows.
q A break-in with a sledgehammer to the refuge's office and the back door to
its communal close being kicked in.
A public meeting was called two months ago when church officials and the police
outlined the crisis and urged local residents to support a campaign to stop the
harassment, but to no avail. The archdiocese said police increased their
surveillance of the area after several complaints but it was not aware of
anyone being charged.
Glasgow district councillors were told yesterday that the situation
deteriorated to the extent that two members of staff were required to accompany
one resident to nearby shops.
A full report was ordered by Councillor Madge O'Neill, the authority's housing
convener, who said she wished the unit to remain operational as a care project.
``Otherwise,'' she warned a housing sub-committee yesterday, ``this could have
a snowball effect on projects in other parts of our city. I am not having
that.''
The residents, six women and four men aged between 40 and 60, had all
previously been in long-term institutional care and were discharged from Lennox
Castle to give them the opportunity of living semi-independent lives in the
community. A caretaker provided 24-hour cover at the six-flat complex and seven
other members of staff helped by teaching residents life skills such as cooking
and house-keeping. One flat was used as a communal area and the other five
served as bedsits.
Miss Agnes Malone, the archdiocese's director of social services, said that the
residents had been temporarily rehoused in similar projects in Clydebank and
Pollok after discussions with the district council and Strathclyde region's
social work department.
She added: ``We had no choice but to move them out because the residents and
staff were very frightened and very angry about the appalling way they were
being treated. It is no exaggeration to call it a campaign of terror. They were
literally under siege.
``Even the day the whole management team helped them move out of the flats was
horrendous. We were putting furniture and clothes into vans but they were being
whipped out and thrown on to the street. It was quite unbelievable.''
Scotland's Roman Catholic leader, Cardinal Thomas Winning, said yesterday that
he was shocked and disgusted by the outrage at the refuge.
Strathclyde Police made no comment.

<TEXT>
A GRANDSON of the Queen will win his first Scotland rugby cap next month. Peter
Phillips makes his debut for the national schools side against France at
Goldenacre, Edinburgh, on December 22.
The 18-year-old son of the Princess Royal was expected to be kept on the
sidelines for months before the big call-up. However, the selectors gave him
the nod yesterday after an injury to his Gordonstoun team-mate, Fergie
Gladstone, also 18.
The great-great-grandson of the late Prime Minister has a ruptured cruciate
knee ligament.
Phillips, who plays blind-side flanker, showed up well in the international
schoolboys' trial at Murrayfield but had to be content with a place on the
reserve bench for the match against Scotland Under-18s a fortnight ago.
He qualifies to play for Scotland because he has been resident at the Highland
boarding school for more than three years.
He could still opt to play for England in the future, because he and his
parents were born there.
However, as his mother is patron of the Scottish Rugby Union, he is not
expected to change his allegiance. The Princess Royal attends virtually every
Scotland international.

<HEADLINE>EU President rethinks comments about outspoken Commissioner. Santer softens view of Kinnock</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>
<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975126675</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
MR Neil Kinnock was putting on a brave face yesterday after being publicly
denounced for lacking strength of personality by his boss in the European
Commission, Mr Jacques Santer.
Mr Santer's cutting remarks - made at a major news conference in Brussels -
were apparently Mr Kinnock's punishment for stepping out of line last week at a
business seminar in England.
However, in a bizarre about-turn after seeing his comments being reported
throughout Europe, last night Mr Santer issued another statement softening his
remarks. Observers suspect Mr Santer's partial retraction followed a blazing
behind-the-scenes row.
In a speech not made public by his press service until it was leaked to a news
agency, Mr Kinnock said last week he believed the timetable for a European
single currency was unrealistic and that the EU's policy for granting
membership to ex-Communist countries needed revision.
The former Labour leader broke the convention of Commissioners speaking with
one voice on all policies and exposed the deep divisions on the issue which
observers have long suspected exist, despite frequent denials.
The Maastricht timetable for economic and monetary union leading to a single
currency by 1999 is regarded as an immutable truth in the Commission which is
also adamant, in public, that the Community can afford to take in up to 15
economically desperate former Eastern Bloc states early next century.
Before astonished reporters yesterday, the mild-mannered Mr Santer responded to
a question about Mr Kinnock's comments by saying his transport Commissioner was
``not enough of a strong personality'' to win arguments about the single
currency and enlargement.
Mr Santer said: ``I am the one who is entitled to present Commission policy -
that is something which happens in any government in the same fashion. I would
say that it is the Commission which defines policy as a college.
``If there is one member of the same college who hesitates, or continues to
express some scepticism on certain points, I can only say that he may not have
enough of a strong personality to convince his colleagues in the college.''
Mr Santer insisted the timetable for monetary union was irreversible and
predicted there would be a reinforced commitment to enlargement from the Madrid
EU summit next month.
Later, he seemed to have second thoughts about his attack. He issued a formal
statement confirming his opinion that Mr Kinnock had damaged the Commission's
collegiate approach. However, he continued: ``I do not consider, however, that
Neil Kinnock has a weak personality.''
Mr Santer said: ``Clearly, no words of mine should be construed in this way. In
fact, I consider Neil Kinnock as a very active, co-operative, efficient
Commissioner.'' He concluded by saying he looked forward to working with Mr
Kinnock.
The presidential put-down was more pointed than the censure suffered by Sir
Leon Brittan, who stepped out of line on an earlier occasion. His rebuke was
delivered privately after he suggested eastwards enlargement of the EU should
be carried out more quickly than is planned.
In recent times, Mr Santer has had to cope with rebellious behaviour from the
Danish Commissioner, Mrs Ritt Bjerregaard, who kept a diary of her observations
of Commission colleagues - some unflattering - and who had to order its
withdrawal. She was also prevented from accepting royalties.
As Mrs Bjerregaard was making waves, the Commission was trying to brush aside
the effects of a book entitled The Rotten Heart of Europe by Mr Bernard
Connolly, a British Commission official who was later suspended for claiming
monetary union amounted to a Franco-German plot against sterling.
Mr Santer said the Madrid meeting would give the lie to those predicting doom
for the EU and added that the Community should now ``talk less and do more''.
Mr Kinnock's spokesman said last night: ``This matter is now closed.''
q.No name for the proposed single currency has been agreed so far. France is
now alone in wanting it called the Ecu. Spanish premier Felipe Gonzalez
yesterday ruled out an Italian suggestion, made apparently in jest, that it
could be called the franco. The ``Euro'' is still favourite. A decision will be
made in Madrid.

More bite, without a taxing after-taste. Political correspondent Stuart Trotter
chews over Michael Forsyth's argument.
MR Michael Forsyth's thesis underlying the ingenious proposals revealed
yesterday is that in the dire event, as he sees it, of a Labour government
being elected, his plans are better for Scotland than the Labour Party's.
The revamped Grand Committee would be able to legislate, debate, and scrutinise
Scottish Ministers. Do everything the Convention parliament could do except tax
Scots more than the rest of the Kingdom. It could actually do more, he argued.
It could bend the Chancellor of the Exchequer's ear before he decided on the
amount of the block grant that would fund a Scottish parliament and that is
more than the Scottish parliament could do. It could quiz the UK Minister on
how social security policy operates in Scotland.
The Grand Committee could have the UK Prime Minister to speak and be questioned
in its debates. So in some respects, Mr Forsyth was arguing to MPs,
journalists, and the Scottish public, the committee would carry more weight
than the parliament, its activities would range more widely, and its operations
would cost very much less.
Mr Forsyth brandished a weapon which was not so much rusty with disuse as never
drawn from its scabbard. The Commons Standing Orders provided for the setting
up of an English Grand Committee.
If some Scots Labour MPs are saying - and the Secretary of State clearly senses
the possibility of a split here - the wishes of Scottish voters should
determine the actions in Scotland of a Westminster government whoever is in
power, the same must apply for England.
If Mr Blair comes to power with a Commons majority provided by Scots and Welsh
MPs it will not be long before English Tories demand the setting up of the
English Grand Committee. If it had the powers which the Scottish Grand
Committee is criticised for not having, Mr Blair would be unable to rule
England.
He could vote the Tories down but only by using Scots and Welsh votes. That
would precipitate a storm in which the Union would be in danger.
It is implicit in being a unionist, Mr Forsyth argues, that your particular
part of the Union may be governed by a party for which that part did not vote.
That is a consequence of being in a Union.
The Secretary of State also pointed out that the West Lothian question was
entering its seventeenth year unanswered and the Constitutional Convention did
not propose to answer it today. Scots voters may not mind their Westminster MPs
voting on English health, education, and so on without the English Westminster
MPs being able to reciprocate, but English voters could become quite heated
about it.
The Opposition had easy jokes yesterday about the ``travelling circus'' but Mr
Forsyth's statement clearly sharpened the debate about the nature of the Union
and that, he believed, rightly or wrongly, could only be to his advantage.

THE Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen could become the battleground for a
union attempt to end national negotiations on lecturers' pay and conditions.
The Educational Institute of Scotland, which through its University Lecturers
Association represents the majority of teaching staff at the new universities,
and the white collar union MSF are seeking legal advice on new contracts
proposed for new staff which, they claim, mean a 25% increase in lecturers'
workloads.
The unions demanded yesterday that the university withdraw the contracts which
they claim are being imposed without proper negotiations. They say that if they
do not make a stand at RGU there could be major repercussions for higher
education in Scotland.
``This is the worst contract in any sector in higher education in Scotland or
England,'' Dr Alastair McLeish, EIS RGU branch secretary, said yesterday after
a meeting of its members.
This meeting produced a condemnation of the RGU management ``for its intention
to unilaterally impose contracts for academic staff which have not been
negotiated through the recognised national negotiating machinery''.
The meeting also demanded that the issue of the contracts be suspended and
regretted ``the effect this unilateral action will have on staff morale and
staff retention since the proposed new contract conditions are significantly
worse than those provided both in traditional universities and in the
nationally negotiated contracts in new universities in England''.
The meeting was attended by EIS national official Marian Healy, who said: ``If
we don't make a stand here, Robert Gordon University will have set a pattern
for local negotiations elsewhere.
``It is changing conditions by the back door because it is an untenable
position to have two different types of contract working in an organisation.''
The contracts affect only new staff at the moment but Dr McLeish said
management hoped to get school heads to sign the contracts by next summer and
anyone promoted would have to sign before taking up their new post.
Anyone on a fixed-term contract moving on to a new one also would automatically
have to sign one of the new contracts.
Ms Healy and other union officials will meet university management on Monday
but she urged it to withdraw the contracts in the meantime.
``If they don't withdraw the contracts, we will be hoping to organise a
national campaign to isolate this university,'' she said.
Mr Jim Cowan of the MSF said the new contracts involved meant a 25% increase in
workload during the year including an increase in hours from 32 to 37 a week
and a reduction in holidays from 50 to 30 days.''
RGU said in a statement last night: ``Discussions are on-going concerning
conditions for new staff and proposals will be put to the governors.
``The proposed conditions are comparable to those in the majority of higher
education institutions throughout the UK. The conditions of existing staff will
not be affected by these proposals.''

<HEADLINE>Way clear for Europe to tighten ferry safety</HEADLINE>

BRITAIN and other Western European nations are poised to agree tough new safety
standards for roll-on, roll-off ferries operating between their ports, even
though maritime nations worldwide refuse to endorse such a move.
An agreement was reached in London yesterday, at a meeting of the International
Maritime Organisation, to phase out ferries with only one compartment and
modify others to ensure they can remain stable even with two compartments
flooded - a quality that must apply to all new ferries. However, the meeting
could not agree on the stricter safety regulations suggested by an IMO panel in
the wake of the Estonia tragedy which claimed 900 lives last year.
The panel had recommended the fitting of watertight compartment bulkheads to
keep vessels afloat for as long as possible if water entered the car deck. This
would have meant much costly structural work for virtually all ferries and
would have gone far beyond the survivability standards set by the 1990 Safety
of Lives at Sea convention.
Largely because of opposition from Mediterranean ferry operators, who argued
that the conditions they faced did not warrant such drastic action, the IMO
failed to endorse these tougher regulations and merely agreed that all ships,
rather than just those built since 1990, should meet the lesser 1990 standards.
The UK is now set to bring in these stronger stability regulations, thanks to a
regional agreement it has reached with France and other Western European
countries which will be the subject of a separate conference of European and
Scandinavian maritime nations arranged for next week in Stockholm.
This follows an agreement by the UK, together with France, Italy, Spain,
Norway, and Sweden, and accepted by the IMO, that when two, or three, countries
in a region agreed there was a need to have higher standards, they could impose
them.
Mr William O'Neil, IMO director-general, had supported strongly the tougher
standards proposed. These sought to introduce stability and passenger
survivability regulations which would have been met even with 50cm of water on
the car deck.
Despite the failure to have such standards accepted internationally, Mr O'Neil
told a news conference that it had been a quite successful meeting.
q.A key report on ferry safety, being taken to Brussels on Tuesday by East Kent
Euro-MP Mark Watts, arrived late after being held up at Calais by a strike by
French transport workers.

THE strength of sales in recent weeks at Safeway took the City by surprise
yesterday. Indications are that the combination of the Safeway 2000 strategic
programme and the success of the ABC loyalty card, after an uninspiring start,
are working more quickly than expected. So shares of the Argyll parent rose 7p
to 312p in response.
In the 28 weeks to October 14, sales increased 7.8% in like-for-like terms with
volume accounting for 4.7% of the gain, inflation the remaining 3.1%.
The expectation is that food prices will show this level of increase for the
remainder of the year although an unknown is the volatility of fresh produce
prices. Safeway has been forced to sell bananas at 19p and tomatoes at 27p to
match the competition.
Overall group turnover was little changed but the previous year included 20
uneconomic Presto stores now sold off.
The Scottish operations outperformed the group average despite the impact Tesco
has had on its Wm Low acquisition.
The pre-tax total improved 4% to #214m, while operating margins increased 0.3%
to 6.9% at the pre-interest level. That conceals a fall of 0.2% at Safeway to
6.9% and a 1.1% jump to 7.1% at the 100 or so Presto outlets to boost its
divisional profits 3.7% to #17m.
The Safeway downturn was due to the price competition in fresh produce and
petrol and generally competitive conditions.
Chairman Sir Alistair Grant does not now expect the margin recovery postulated
at the annual meeting in July to occur and it will now be slightly below that
of last year.
Safeway has been successfully targeting the big spenders with its share of the
ABC1 sector laying out more than #40 a shop rising 2.1% to 21.3%. The group
overall market share is just 7.5% although it claims now to be clearly number
three.
The 2000 programme inevitably caused disruption with 4800 jobs going but 7500
being created and with many employees reassigned to new responsibilities. The
store opening programme is currently running at 17 new outlets for this year
and next and there is also a hefty programme of refits. The revitalised stores
have seen sales rise by a fifth over similar refurbishments in 1994.
Self-scanning has been introduced in 24 stores. This means Safeway is world
leader in trials of this development which should speed up the checkout
procedures - only four stores elsewhere in the world are involved. Chief
executive Colin Smith said the preliminary indications had been encouraging.
The interim dividend has been raised 3.8% to to 4.05p.

POLICE searching for the mother of a new-born baby girl found on the steps of
Glasgow Royal Maternity Hospital in Rottenrow last week, yesterday released
video pictures of the woman they suspect abandoned her.
The baby, named Amy by nurses, was discovered by hospital staff at 4am on
Tuesday, November 21, after they had been alerted by a female caller. The baby
was thought to be only a few hours old.
The video, taken by a private security camera at 3.37am on the same day, shows
a woman carrying a bundle walking up Montrose Street near the hospital.
At 2.01am, the video captured her without the bundle walking along the same
route, apparently checking the surrounding area.
Police do not believe the woman on camera is the baby's mother, considering the
estimated time of birth which doctors put at between one and two hours before
the baby was discovered.
Leading the inquiry, Detective Chief Inspector Nanette Pollock said: ``I do not
think it is the mother herself but I do think it is someone connected with the
mother. She did not look as if she had just given birth.''
She said she wanted to interview the mother before deciding if the law had been
broken but stressed: ``At this point in time, our main aim is to re-unite her
with her baby.''
Ms Pollock described the woman on camera as being in her 40s, medium build and
height, light blonde, collar- length hair, glasses and wearing a strong pink
thigh-length jacket, dark leggings, and white training shoes.
On the same day the baby was found, the hospital received a telephone call from
a woman calling herself Karen who said she was a friend of the baby's mother
and would bring her into the hospital. This did not happen.
A second call was received on Sunday by a woman claiming to be the mother but
she hung up when questioned.
A hospital spokesman confirmed yesterday that the baby, who was well wrapped up
and in good health when found, was ``doing very well'' and would be released
into temporary foster care within the next few days.
Anyone with information should contact Ms Pollock on 0141 532 3000 or
Strathclyde social services on 0141 227 6029.

<HEADLINE>Burns festival hit by more setbacks Dame Kiri pulls out and satellite supper is axed</HEADLINE>

BTHE troubled Burns International Festival has been hit by a further blow, with
the news that two major events will not now take place.
It had been planned to host the world's biggest Burns Supper on January 25,
with Ayr being linked by satellite to a variety of world centres. That has been
shelved.
Dame Kiri Te Kanawa was to have given an open-air recital next summer for
thousands of fans at Rugby Park, Kilmarnock. Talks with the singer's management
have broken down.
The disclosure that these two key events are now off the agenda comes days
after the management teams of both comedian Billy Connolly and the pop group
Runrig made it clear that they had no agreement with the festival company,
despite claims to the contrary.
It is now certain that Billy Connolly will not be performing, although the
Runrig management team says that the group will take part if certain guarantees
about the Centrum arena being ready can be obtained.
The Centrum poses another problem for the organisers, as they had been led to
understand that Barr Ltd, with a controversial injection of National Lottery
cash, would be ready to fit out the arena in time to take 5000 eager fans for
festival events.
Thus far there has been no such guarantee.
The Herald disclosed in August that the festival was running into difficulties
and that Enterprise Ayrshire was seconding a senior official and PR and
marketing agency Barkers were being brought in to assist festival director John
Struthers and his small team.
Since then, the news has seldom been good and in an unconnected but
embarrassing departure, festival chairman Councillor Eric Rowe left his wife
and family to take up residence with a new partner in Essex.
One glimmer of hope, however, is that Westsound Radio, which has staged the
world's biggest Burns Supper for many years, has agreed to allow the festival
to become associated.
Managing director Joe Campbell said: ``We were approached by the festival after
it became clear that their ambitious and elaborate plans for satellite links
and the like were not going to come off.
``We were delighted to let them have a number of tickets and for them to become
involved in a small way in an event which has become established as the leader
in its field over a number of years.''
It is unlikely there will be any replacement for Dame Kiri, however, and the
festival will continue with what is left of its existing programme.
A festival spokesman said: ``It is true that talks are no longer going on with
Dame Kiri's management, as there were some aspects of the event they were not
satisfied with.
``As far as the Burns Supper is concerned, the logistics became unworkable and
we are happy to be associated with the Westsound event in mid-January.
``It may be that publicity was given to some of our events a little too early
and that is something we will be aware of in future. Many events are in place
and there will be anouncements about others in due course.''
Mr Struthers said: ``Obviously it is a disappointment that two such prestigious
events will not now be part of next year's programme.
``What I would say, however, is that in the coming days and weeks we will be
announcing events which will fill the gaps which have been left by the
unfortunate failure of some events to come to fruition.''
He added: ``In each of the cases there have been logistical and contractual
difficulties involving either the performers or the venues. There was nothing
we could have done to foresee these.
``We are continuing our efforts to ensure that the festival is a success.''
The year-long festival is being staged to mark the bicentenary of the death of
Burns.
It is also expected that before the end of next month, when the festival is due
to begin, sponsors will be identified for festival events.

n DOROTHY PAUL is among the artists taking part in a charity gala at Glasgow's
Mitchell Theatre tomorrow evening as part of the city's contribution to World
Aids Day. The performance is entitled Touched by Torchsong - In Loving Memory
Of All Departed Friends.
Earlier, at 6.30pm, a memorial service will be held in the Lord Todd Hall,
Strathclyde University.
Organised by the newly formed Strathclyde branch of Body Positive, World Aids
Day celebrates the lives of people affected by the virus, and aims to create
awareness of HIV/Aids.
Tickets for the Torchsong charity gala at #5, and #2.50 for the unwaged, are
available from the Mitchell Theatre or at the usual TicketLink outlets.
Meanwhile in Edinburgh, Crew 2000, the drugs information centre, will be
holding an open day at 32 Cockburn Street, with a variety of events.
n FATHERS who keep in contact with their children after divorce are more likely
to suffer depression than those who no longer keep in touch, according to new
research carried out at Newcastle University. The men saw regular contact as a
continual reminder of failure on their part, says the study reported in the
recent issue of GP, the doctor's weekly magazine.
n AMONG the more unusual people who turn up at hospital casualty departments
are young people crowing like cockerels. For they are the victims of stage
hypnotists who have failed to come out of their hypnotic state.
Doctors called on late at night to deal with such cases are only too well aware
how easily an evening out can turn into a disaster. That's why many would like
to see much tighter control governing stage hypnotists.
It now looks as though their campaign will be successful, as Home Office
experts, following evidence submitted to them by doctors, are recommending that
hypnotism should be licensed and operate under strict guidelines.
They examined case histories from doctors showing what can happen to people who
participate in stage hypnotism and it goes badly wrong. These range from minor
problems like headaches and dizziness to deep-seated psychological problems,
personal injury, and even death.

A PIONEERING educational package which will help provide children throughout
Britain with the social skills required to tackle issues like drug abuse and
bullying has been launched in Grampian.
``The Police Box - Learning for Life'' has been jointly developed by Grampian
Police and Grampian region's education department over more than two years and
is attracting interest from all over Britain.
Grampian Police is investing up to #300,000 a year in the programme, which will
help provide young people with the skills to cope with life today, and a number
of officers are undergoing a condensed teacher training course at Aberdeen's
Northern College to help them present it.
Chief Constable Dr Ian Oliver said: ``The philosophy of Grampian Police is
that, whenever possible, an appropriate education is more valuable than
enforcement. The preferred education approach is to develop a well-rounded
individual within society with the skills necessary for living a good and
useful life.
``This is a skills for living package to educate today's children and
tomorrow's responsible adults to be good citizens.
``It incorporates a whole range of skills including how to develop self-esteem
and to handle the problems of peer pressure and a whole range of ideas that are
integrated into the education system.
``It is a long-term investment and a selfish one from our point of view because
it will arguably make our job easier in 10 or 15 years than it would otherwise
be.''

James Currie reports on a family firm that has grown by using its expertise to
expand into related business areas
ONE of the great strengths of the Scottish commercial base has traditionally
been our ability to identify markets and operate within set parameters, all the
while fine tuning along the way.
In other words, many Scottish companies still provide their clients with
exactly the services they require, rather than establishing themselves in one
field of activity and then drifting off, often ill-prepared, into others.
Which is why we still have a very high proportion of successful concerns
controlled by the families who founded them, who can offer the expertise and
experience lacking in those operating on a broader canvas.
One such business is John Gardiner Environmental Services Limited, of Larkhall,
Lanarkshire, which also operates from offices in Edinburgh and Wakefield, West
Yorkshire.
Earlier this year it was assessed and registered by National Quality Assurance
Limited against the provisions of BS EN ISO 9002 and the Certificate of
Registration is now displayed in the company's headquarters in Broadway House,
after being presented to Gardiners by Dr Morton Fyfe, the deacon convener at
the Trades House of Glasgow.
Now recognised as one of the country's leading authorities in several complex
activities, including asbestos removal and encapsulating, the company was
formed in 1952.
That was when Mr L J Broadway bought an existing Hamilton-based haulage firm,
John Gardiner (Contractors) Limited.
Its principal field of operation was switched from haulage to civil
engineering, and this formed the core of the business from 1953 to 1985,
providing the base from which to launch its asbestos removal and re-insulation
divisions over 20 years ago.
From fairly small beginnings, this side of the business has grown to the extent
that the company now covers an area from Orkney to Somerset, with the
occasional flying diversions to the outer Western Isles.
Mr L J Broadway and Ms L D Broadway acted as managing director and company
secretary until they retired a few years ago, although their interest is
maintained in the roles of consultant and company director.
The present managing director is Anthony J W Broadway and his wife, Sandra
Broadway, has taken over as company secretary. Mrs Broadway's sister, Sheena
McCallum, is office administrator, so if anything, the family influence is
stronger than ever.
``Our activities now take in a number of related activities,'' said Anthony
Broadway. ``We handle asbestos removal and encapsulating, asbestos cement sheet
roofing, thermal/acoustic insulation, fire protection, cold stores,
contaminated land clearance, environmental cleaning of ducting and water
treatment.
``On the fire stopping side, our men are specially trained to deal with both
new build projects and the restoration of older properties, nowadays a vitally
important aspect of industry.
``Clearing and restoring contaminated land sites is also an area where
experience is essential, and our role is to remove the contamination to an
approved tip and safely reclaim the original land area, using a bottoming of
blaes and then a topsoil surface.''
On the asbestos removal aspect the company has been handling material on behalf
of local authorities, health boards and the private sector since 1976.
Clients have included the Royal Bank of Scotland, British Home Stores,
Lanarkshire Health Board, hotels (including the Balmoral, Edinburgh), and the
Royal Mail in Orkney.
This type of contract generally involves the removal of old asbestos insulation
and its replacement with newer, safe materials.
It has been some time since the problems with asbestos were first recognised
and steps taken to deal with it, but there is still a lot of it about, said Mr
Broadway. After all, it took a couple of hundred years to put it all in.
``Our move into this field has come about as a result of the expertise gained
over the years in dealing with asbestos, supplying and installing alternative
products is a natural progression,'' said Mr Broadway.

Q. WHAT actually should a man's cholesterol be?
I was in America this summer and had my level checked by a doctor there. She
said it was a bit up. But when I came back to Scotland and saw my GP, he did it
again and said that at 5.2 it was ``perfectly okay''.
So what are the facts?
A. As I'm sure you know, the level of blood cholesterol is very important -
because high figures are associated with heart disease.
But doctors differ a bit on what exactly constitutes ``high''. An additional
source of misunderstanding is the fact that the Americans use a totally
different system of units from ourselves.
However, in the UK there's general agreement that if your level's anything more
than about five units, then you should at least have a chat with your doc about
it, and consider modifying your lifestyle.
Being a bit more specific, a leading Glasgow physician has just issued these
very useful ``cholesterol guidelines'':
q Fewer than 5.2 units: no action needed.
q 5.2 to 7.8 units: consider cholesterol-lowering diet or treatment, depending
on whether there are any other risk factors for heart disease.
q More than 7.8 units: definitely see hospital specialist.
Q. TO settle an argument, can you tell me this: does a man really need to wash
his ``personal parts'' every day?
A. It's certainly a good idea - partly because of the fact that carcinoma of
the penis (which generally develops under the foreskin) is almost entirely seen
among those who haven't made a habit of washing themselves regularly.
Q. WHAT'S a healthy blood pressure for a young man, please? I had mine done at
a sports clinic, and it was 120 over 70. Is that good?
A. Yes, it's fine. I'll be explaining a bit more about blood pressure in a
couple of weeks' time, but in a young chap the first figure shouldn't be much
more than about (100 + your age in years).
And for teenagers and young adults, the second figure shouldn't be more than
about 80. So you're fine.
Q. I'M only a modest drinker, but I'm having a wee bit of trouble with my
waistline. To what extent does alcohol actually put on weight?
A. It's quite a significant factor, because it contains a lot of calories.
There are three main classes of foods; carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.
Carbohydrates and proteins aren't very fattening, because they contain only
about four calories per gramme. Fat (as the name implies) is very fattening
indeed, because it has more than nine calories per gramme.
Alcohol has around seven calories per gramme. So you can see immediately that
it's nearly as bad as fat when you're trying to shift a bit of weight!
Q. CAN you put my mind at rest, doctor? I'm a salesman, travelling a lot. Last
week, in a bout of stupidity fuelled by alcohol, I had a ``one-night stand''
with a young lady who I met at a hotel in the West Highlands.
At least I had the sense to use a condom. But I am frightened by the idea that
I might have caught HIV. Should I go for a blood test?
A. Well, I think that - like many men - you've probably over-estimated the risk
of HIV for heterosexual people in Scotland.
The early publicity about Aids which was put out by the authorities was, of
course, well meaning, but it did give the impression that the danger of getting
HIV from ``straight'' sex was very high. Thank heavens, that just isn't so - at
least, not yet!
Admittedly, there are a few very small areas of the country - like those
infamous drug-ridden estates, I'm afraid - where having casual sex would be
very dodgy indeed. But if you look at the national statistics, the truth is
that the number of Scotswomen who have ever been found to be HIV positive is
fewer than 600.
This means that the proportion of known HIV-positive females in Scotland is
round about one in every 4500. When you compare this with other countries,
that's a remarkably low level. There are all sorts of reasons why it's low -
one of them being Scotland's relative ``insulation'' from the Continent, where
Aids rates can be frighteningly high these days.
Anyway, the point is that an unwise spot of ``hochmagandy'' in rural Scotland
is at present very unlikely to lead to HIV transmission - particularly when (as
in your case) a condom is used.
Nevertheless, if you want a reassuring blood test then go ahead and have it.
But there's no point in doing it for three months - because the test does not
become positive immediately.
Q. FOR some time I have felt that my career would go better if I could
``ditch'' my spectacles and get myself some contact lenses. But are there any
risks in wearing them?
A. Absolutely! I speak as a contact lens wearer of some 30 years' standing -
during which time I've had quite a few minor complications (like
conjunctivitis) myself.
What many people don't realise is that occasionally contact lens wearing can
lead to really serious trouble, like devastating eye infection. I'm sorry to
say that in my experience, some contact lens practitioners don't draw
sufficient attention to these dangers.
In particular, users of soft contact lenses aren't always warned that they are
at risk of a vicious little parasite called acanthamoeba. Acanthamoeba lives in
water - including, slightly unbelievably, tap water - and if it gets on to
lenses it can cause appalling eye damage.
If you genuinely feel that ``contacts'' would benefit your career, my advice is
to go ahead. But please make sure that you understand the risks first. And
follow your practitioner's instruction about cleaning and disinfecting the
lenses to the letter. Your sight may depend on it.
Q. SAD to say, I am beginning to go pretty bald. I have some money saved up,
and I really wonder whether it would be worth lashing out on a hair transplant.
What do you think?
A. You'd be saying goodbye to several thousand pounds. And I'm afraid you'd
have no guarantee that the transplant would be successful.
The usual procedure in ``male pattern baldness'' is to remove hair from the
back of the head, and to try to ``implant'' it across the bald scalp at the
front. This is moderately painful, and there's also a fairly small risk of
bleeding or infection.
The big gamble is whether the implants will ``take'' or not. You will not get
your money back if they don't. So only go ahead if it's money that you can well
afford to lose.
n If you have a query about your health, write to Dr David Delvin at The
Herald, 195 Albion Street, Glasgow G1 1QP. Dr D cannot reply in person, but
will try to respond in this column. Your name will not be published.

ALWAYS look, as they say, on the bright side. Such at least would appear to be
the philosophical attitude adopted by the Student Loans Company, that asset to
Glasgow's Bothwell Street, in the face of adversity.
Writing in the firm's annual report, chairman Kenneth Young says: ``1994/95 was
in many respects a successful year for the company but . . .'' - ``but''? -
``there were also serious problems'' - oh, yes? - ``arising from a new system
for second and subsequent loan applications'' - dear, dear - ``and from an
investigation into alleged impropriety in earlier years within the company.''
Ah.
To wit: ``A full independent investigation, as a result of which it became
necessary, inter alia, to dismiss the chief executive and secure his
resignation as a director.''
If this is what Mr Young calls ``in many respects a successful year'' we await
a bad one with any amount of trepidation.
Technical note: of the 147,459 ``customers'' in hock to the Student Loans
Company for the sake of their educations, 10% were in arrears on their
repayments last year. Directors' remuneration rose between 1994 and 1995,
meanwhile, from #111,000 to #226,000.
Slick operator
ANOTHER example of rose-tinted (or perhaps green-tinted) optimism arrives with
the annual report from Greenpeace, the environmental action group which gave
Shell such bother over the Brent Spar oil storage platform earlier in the year.
Giving his account of events, Peter Melchet, executive director, recalls
Greenpeace's action as ``a logistical masterpiece'', that ``outwitted and
outnerved Shell''.
Melchet was, meanwhile, ``personally shocked'' (yes, personally) by press
reactions to the fact that Greenpeace was completely wrong in claiming that the
Spar was toxic. ``No-one'', he adds gnomically, ``said that breaking into the
establishment would be easy . . .''
The TV companies who believe they were spun an environmentally-friendly line in
Greenpeace-supplied footage of the dispute might just agree with that.
Heart of gold
A TALE to warm the heart, sort of. Residents at the Edinburgh Nursing Home in
the east of the city were more than a little upset when, in the early hours of
Tuesday, two masked intruders broke in looking for drugs but made off with
#1000 which had been set aside to pay for the old folk's Christmas party and a
trip to the panto.
``When I heard about what had happened,'' said Mr Tommy Robertson, ``I couldn't
bear to think of those old folks having their Christmas taken away from them.''
He added: ``I wanted to prove that there is goodness in the world at
Christmas.''
For the record, Mr Robertson, of The Hatman Karaoke, is known as a ``karaoke
king''. While convinced that the old folks have suffered enough, he intends to
dress up as Santa Claus, serenade them, and put ``a smile'' back on their
faces. The sooner someone stops this crime wave, we feel, the better.
Just to complete the treat, residents have been invited to lunch at Hibs
football ground. The Diary understands there is no obligation to watch the
team. One turkey is enough for anyone.
Radio revolution
FROM Shanghai comes the latest news of Brian Anderson, the man, you may just
remember, who back in 1988 launched himself on the airwaves of China from a
cottage in Cawdor. No, it's true.
To be strictly accurate, Anderson asked the Chinese government if it needed
some shows for state radio, bought the air-time, and returned to the Highlands
to put together a demo Chinese ``prog'', as irritating radio types might say,
with a Chinese student supplying the chatter between the songs.
Since then, the huddled masses yearning to be Madonna haven't been able to get
enough of Anderson's output of politically uncontroversial from the likes of
the Carpenters and the Beatles (``Revolution'', comrade?).
The Man from Cawdor, aided by his wife, Maggie, now produces 25 hours of
material a week to 10 cities, including Beijing, Shanghai itself, and Wuhan.
Such is his popularity, indeed, that he even has his own, self-invented
catchphrase. We don't know how it sounds in Mandarin, but in English the snappy
slogan is, ``It's the fool from Britain, Brian Anderson, and Maggie!''
Somehow, we judge, he's nobody's fool.
All red-letter days
WE COME across an advertisement for a product celebrating yet another glorious
moment in Scotland's story. ``April 1996 is the 250th anniversary of the Battle
of Culloden,'' it says, as the heart sinks, ``and this splendid calendar
depicts in glorious full colour 12 of the estimated 33 clans who fought for
Bonnie Prince Charlie.''
Something to hang on the wall, then: January - slaughter; February - genocide;
March - annihilation; April - wipe-out; May - abject defeat . . .
Exemption to
the yule
SOMEONE's not in the mood. From the classified ads of the Inverness Courier:
``7ft Tulsa pine luxury artificial Christmas tree, boxed, brand new, #25.''
Cheaper nonsense
STILL with Christmas, the PNC Bank of Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, has just
released its annual Christmas Price Index. This is a modern price guide for
anyone who actually wants to saddle their true love with all the items
mentioned in The 12 Days of Christmas - partridges, pear trees, and so forth.
Encouragingly, the price of nonsense is going down, with the whole shooting
match - 12 partridges, 36 calling birds, 24 turtle doves, and so forth -
setting you back a modest $51,764.94. Allegedly, this is a 29.4% drop compared
with last year.
What we still can't work out is how anyone arrived at an hourly rate of $34 for
eight maids a-milking (cows not included).
JAMES WESTRAN has ``been cleared at Stranraer Sheriff Court of stealing 120
dozen eggs from a shed at Broadstone Road, Stranraer, on March 15 or 16 while
acting with another person'' (Galloway Gazette).
No, police still haven't cracked the case.
Fuel for thought
WASTE not, want not: the Holy Cross Lutheran Church in Kalmar, Sweden, has
applied for a permit to connect the crematorium in its memorial park with its
other buildings. The church wants to use the cheap, indeed free, heat from the
crematorium to warm the other places the spirit may not reach.
Thought for the day
LOOK at it this way: isn't it just as well the Royal Mail strike ended before
someone called for a postal ballot?

AS hate-figures of the Conservative Party go I reckon Jeremy Paxman of
Newsnight and the entire Radio Four Today team would be much higher on the hit
list than, say, John Prescott and certainly Tony Blair. My lot are absolutely
convinced they receive the rawest of deals from the media.
There is, if Mr Soames will forgive me, a hint of paranoia about this feeling,
though it is not entirely unjustified. I am amused at the chorus of complaints
about the Budget, many of them born out of the fact that the Chancellor refused
to follow the course which had been charted for him by the ``experts''.
As a small example I put forward the interrogation on television by John
Humphrys of Ian Lang last Sunday. Mr Humphrys was seized of the idea that Ken
Clarke was about to steal Labour's clothes and install a windfall tax.
In vain did Mr Lang try calmly to suggest that this was most unlikely; the hare
had been set to run and we even had Gordon Brown rubbing his hands not exactly
in glee, that is a word which will never apply to the Shadow Chancellor, but in
anticipation of being able to say ``I told you so''.
It never happened, of course, but why let the facts spoil a good story? I
suspect there were two sets of headlines ready for the moment Mr Clarke sat
down on Tuesday. One lot would have accused him of threatening the economic
life of the country by cutting tax and public expenditure too severely, the
alternative was to cry that he had done too little, too late. We live in a win,
lose world, subtlety is not to be applauded.
Yet for all that I do not subscribe to the theory that the media is
fundamentally biased against the Tories. The egos of Jeremy, John, and Jim are
far bigger than any one party.
They would like a change of government, mainly because they are fed up with the
old faces. They would like a new set of politicians to ridicule. If and when
the Blair boy comes to power they will turn on him and his ilk like hounds to
the fox.
That's healthy, though, surely? In a lively democracy you need those who will
not take politicians at face value, who are ready to chide, to challenge, to
put the view of the ordinary man in the street. We do not wish to return to the
days of ``is there anything you would like to tell us, Minister?'' Of course
not. Yet we should remember that most of the big stars of air and screen are as
far removed from ordinary people as those whom they question.
Instead of Peter Snow dancing around with his graphics telling us what the
Budget will mean to this family or that, would it not be more interesting for
him to tell us how it affects him. After all, do we not pay his wages?
I just worry a wee bit when the interviewers become more important than their
subjects. Mr David Dimbleby: ``Will you allow me to finish my questions and I
will allow you to answer?'' This to the Deputy Prime Minister. A little
humility might go a long way.
For my part I always thought it totally unlikely that the Chancellor would
produce a gimmicky, electioneering budget - that is not the nature of the man.
Mr Clarke is thoroughly disliked by the starry-eyed right for the very reason
that he does not accept their simplistic notion that everything comes down to
tax cuts. Good governments have to protect the services as well.
Nor do I believe that elections are won by Budgets though they can help to
instil confidence. As for this one I, for once, agree with the assessment of
Norman Lamont when he says: ``It is an honest Budget that a Labour Chancellor
could not deliver.''
I will do what Peter Snow failed to and tell you how the Budget affects me and
those I care about. If my calculations are right, and the maths master did
suggest I miss the exam for the sake of the school's reputation, I expect to be
about #8 a week better off.
This is not a fortune, nor is it to be sneezed at. I shall most certainly enjoy
the cheaper spirits.
But what I am most pleased about is the better deal for elderly people. I
represent the ward with the highest concentration of pensioners than any other
in the city of Edinburgh.
Many of them are worried about having to go into long-term care, and losing the
assets they have so carefully saved with the intention of passing them on to
their families. Until this Budget those who had more than #8000 received no
financial support from the Government.
Now that the upper threshold has been raised to #16,000 and the Inland Revenue
is to be consulted on the possibility of extending the option to take a
variable pension to members of occupational pension schemes. These are
important measures; they are also good politics.
The Conservative Party must never alienate the grey vote. What is required to
retain their support and regain that of the middle classes is not huge
hand-outs, it is reassurance that their lives can be planned with some kind of
order . . . not so much feel-good as feel-safe. The Chancellor must travel
further down this road, and he knows it.
Of course, if we listen to the pundits, the forecasters, and the sound-biters,
the game is over before the whistle blows. This Government, declared that
famous old Highland dancer Lord Healy, is the most unpopular in history and
cannot now recover. It is a recurring theme and, if repeated often enough, may
even come to pass.
In that case, as I watch Mr Blair pout, point, and postulate without saying a
damned thing, I look forward to the day he falls under the arch of Jeremy's
eyebrows.

JOHN Gardiner Environmental Services Limited is actively involved in water
treatment, cold stores, and thermal/acoustic insulation.
Some of these terms may seem a little vague, but basically water treatment
takes in everything from the prevention of scale and corrosion in steam boilers
right through to bacteriological protection of cooling and air conditioning
plant, Legionella monitoring in all types of water-based systems and the
sterilisation of domestic hot and cold water services to British Standards.
On the thermal/ acoustic insulation front, work undertaken can include a
complete insulation service and on-site surveys. Pipe sections, valve covers,
flanges, slabs, trace heating, cylinder covers and colour/flow direction coding
are just a few of the things that are dealt with on a day to day basis.
The company can also construct cold stores and blast freezers in either
traditional in-site construction or composite panel construction.
Ancillaries, such as shelving, heater tapes, automatic release and security
locks are all part of the package, as are repairs to existing units.
To be able to respond quickly to  any of these matters, an Edinburgh base was
established under managers Stuart Cowan and Gordon Thomson. Dave Nixon is
contracts manager at Larkhall and Robert Wallace acts as water treatment
manager.
``We have a solid nucleus of staff who are largely skilled tradesmen in their
own right,'' said Anthony Broadway.
Sheena McCallum, aware of the importance of establishing uniform standards in a
business that was growing and operating in a highly technical environment, was
given the job of putting everything in place for the drive towards ISO 9002.
"With the help of an outside consultant we put the systems in place and were
then left with the homework," she said. "The workforce recognised the
importance of it all and were extremely co-operative. They worked very hard to
get it in the first instance and will do the same to maintain it."

A 28-YEAR-OLD man has been arrested following alleged shooting incidents in
Edinburgh and Dunfermline in which two men were injured, one seriously.
Mr Alexander Telford, 56, was in a serious but stable condition in Edinburgh
Royal Infirmary last night after a firearms incident at his home in Greendykes
Road, Edinburgh, on Tuesday night.
Another man received hospital treatment for a minor groin injury after the
Dunfermline incident at a flat in William Street early yesterday.
Fife Police said the 28-year-old would appear at Dunfermline Sheriff Court
today following the Dunfermline incident. A report had been sent to the
procurator-fiscal.
Lothian and Borders Police said the man also had been arrested in connection
with the Edinburgh incident and that a report was being prepared for the fiscal.

WE'VE been married now for 37 years and it don't seem a day too much, but,
before some of you out there start counting on your fingers, trying to work out
my age, let me tell you that when we were wedded I was 13. My birth certificate
had been altered to make it appear the groom was seven years older. I was
physically precocious and had been shaving since the age of nine. I looked the
part. That's my story.
Now you might find all this hard to believe but clock the coupon at the top of
this column. It's the face of a man who'll never see 30 again, but just. OK,
it's a free country and you can dispute everything else but the 37 years of
marriage is beyond challenge. There were plenty of witnesses to our getting
hitched in the sheriff's office at Dalmuir on the 9/8/58. Witnesses with a
thirst the size of the Grand Canyon.
We ran out of drink at the reception in the Masonic Hall, Clydebank which had a
gripping atmosphere, and had to send for a carry out from the nearest off
licence. The three-piece band was symmetrically composed of three local shop
stewards who played all the time in the key of C and knew only one song - Hey
Jock McCuddy. Their tango to that tune was memorable, so were many other things
that day.
When the best man, my brother John, declared the bar open my teetotal relatives
were trampled underfoot in the stampede by my wife's aunts and uncles,
particularly the aunts. You're being told all this so that you may understand
that my attitude to divorce is somewhat academic, more or less, and more less
if my betrothed continues to rubbish my viewing of Italian Serie A football on
a Sunday afternoon, with asinine comments about 22 men tearing up the grass
with studs on their feet and bolts in their necks.
So it is unlikely, to say the least, that we will ever seek a divorce, but I
can understand others, locked in a marriage that isn't working at any level,
rightly seeking release from what can otherwise only be called, a life
sentence. I find it difficult to understand people who have no need of divorce
for themselves denying others that right. In fact I deny the right of a
majority to deny a minority this right.
Democracy is more than majority rule. In a healthy democracy minorities have
rights. During the darkest days of Stormont rule in Ulster, Catholics were
treated like second class citizens. This repression was spuriously justified by
the principle of majority rule.
Last Friday in the Irish Republic there was a referendum on whether divorce
should be a legal right for those whose marriages had irretrievably broken
down. The All Ireland Roman Catholic Church campaigned for a No vote. The Pope
and Mother Theresa joined in.
A Yes vote didn't mean that Catholic couples would be compelled by the state to
get a divorce, but a No vote meant that all Irish citizens, whatever their
beliefs, could not get a divorce. It is not the function of a state to legally
impose the teachings of a church, any church, on its citizens.
The question of divorce and Catholicism is a matter between the Church and its
members. If the Roman Catholic Church cannot persuade its members of the moral
validity of its teachings then a democratic state, worthy of the name, must not
impose these teachings by force of law.
Then there are the rights of non-Catholics in Ireland. That they should be
denied the right to a divorce, or to family planning, because a church to which
they do not belong dominated the politics of the country, and framed laws to
enshrine their teachings, and nobody else's, was a disgrace. As bad as the
worst ravages of Protestant sectarianism in the North, where home rule was seen
as Rome rule, a claim which had more than a ring of truth.
The failure to disentangle Church and state tarnished the Irish Republic,
subverted its politics, and gradually undermined the authority of the Church
itself. It played into the hands of Ulster Unionism. Devalued the democratic
credentials of Irish Republicanism, and was certainly not the Ireland for which
James Connolly died.
To their everlasting credit a majority of Ireland's citizens voted last Friday
for divorce, not for themselves, but for those who have to decide for
themselves whether to escape from a relationship, which, for all we know, might
be a living hell.
In almost every case where religion or a church has dominated the politics of a
state the consequences have been damnable. Look at those countries in thrall to
Islamic extremism, or to Menachem Begin's Israel.
I will never forget when Calmac first decided to run ferries during the summer
months to the Outer Hebrides. The first cars and buses to land on an island
dominated by some branch of the Wee Frees were confronted by a minister lying
in their path, with rimless glasses, thin lips, and the expression of a man
totally inaccessible to the reasoning or arguments of others.
There was a large photograph of him all over the front page of a Scottish
newspaper. He looked like Lavrenti Beri, the man in charge of the KGB at the
height of Stalin's reign of terror. In fact the analogy is worth exploring.
Leninism was not a political philosophy, in any real sense, but a secular
religion with its own dogma, high priests, and inquisitions. Stalin was
educated in a Russian Orthodox seminary and was an apprentice priest. He
swapped dogmas.
When Lenin died he was made a god, ensconced at the top of a pantheon of
Bolshevik saint and angels. His mausoleum is essentially a shrine reeking with
religiosity. Edwin Muir many moons go even wrote an essay on the theological
and philosophical connection between Scottish Calvinism and Scottish communism.
Harry Pollitt once told me that Willie Gallagher, the bravest of the Red
Clydesiders, was always destined to be either a communist revolutionary, or a
Calvinist minister. Harry's comment itself had a certain resonance of Calvinist
predestination.
I think the lesson of history is that the running of secular society is best
left to those who have principles, and a moral code, but minds still open to
the possibility of being wrong. There is something else it teaches. The one
thing worse than a religion that wants to be a political power is a political
party that wants to be a religious power. God save us from both.

BRITAIN'S biggest building society, the Halifax, yesterday triggered a flurry
of activity in the mortgage market when it announced it was cutting its
variable rate mortgage by 0.25 points from 7.99% to 7.74% while removing
cashbacks for new customers in a move to benefit existing borrowers.
Other lenders soon leapt on the bandwagon, Abbey National almost immediately
announcing a reduction of 0.2% in its variable rates ``in anticipation of a
0.5% base rate cut'', while the Nationwide Building Society reduced its rate by
0.3 points to 7.65%.
Bradford &amp; Bingley said it would at least match the Halifax's move, and the
Woolwich said it would it would review its rates to make sure it remained
competitive. Britannia Building Society sliced 0.25% off its rate from 7.99% to
7.74%, matching the Halifax, while Northern Rock cut its by 0.4% to 7.59%.
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke did nothing specific in the Budget to help the
housing market, despite many calls from the industry for him to do so. Except
for any boost that might be provided by tax cuts and the prospect of a base
rate reduction, now expected either next month when he and the Governor of the
Bank of England meet on December 13 or early next year, there was no artificial
boost for housing.
But since potential borrowers might have been holding off ahead of the Budget
in the hope he would cut stamp duty, lending could bounce anyway over the next
few months.
The mortgage war between the lenders which has now broken out could provide a
fillip to a currently moribund market, and this would also be of help to the
Chancellor.
On the downside, though, it means savers are likely to see some reduction in
their income so margins in the industry are not squeezed too hard. This, of
course, is the usual corollary of lower mortgages - savers, many of them
retired and dependent on income from their savings, have to pick up the tag.
Reductions in the past after the progressive fall in lending rates resulted in
many of them shifting their savings to areas where they could earn more of a
return, such as relatively high yielding PEPs, despite the risk factor.
Mike Blackburn, chief executive of the Halifax, said: ``We want to help
existing borrowers and home buyers. With the housing market poised for an
upturn and combined with tax cuts from the Budget, this measure will help to
encourage a sustained recovery.
``The current trend of interest rates is downward and we believe that when it
is possible to do so, we should pass on lower rates to our customers.''
The Halifax move reduces monthly payments on a #30,000 repayment mortgage by
#4.07 to #206.45; a #50,000 loan falls #15.67 to #352.68, and a #100,000 loan
#15.67 to #734.37. On an endowment or other interest-only mortgage, reductions
are #5.32 to #164.48 on a #30,000 loan, #9.49 to #293.48 on a #50,000 mortgage
and #19.91 to #615.98 on a #100,000 mortgage.
No move has been made yet on returns to savers, but Abbey National said that in
making its decision, it had to balance the needs of its 10 million savers.
``Savings rates will have to come down as well but we do not want to bring them
down any more than necessary,'' Charlie Toner, managing director retail, said.
In most cases the reductions will come into effect immediately for new
borrowers and on January 1 for existing ones, though some will have to wait
until February.

CHARGES against Free Church of Scotland Professor Donald Macleod were continued
without plea for a further two weeks at Edinburgh Sheriff Court yesterday.
Professor Macleod, 55, of Craiglea Drive, Edinburgh, faces six allegations of
assault involving five women over a seven-year period dating back to 1985.
He is accused of carrying out four assaults at the Free Church College on The
Mound in Edinburgh, where he holds the chair of systematic theology, and the
remainder at his home and in a car parked at the Cameron Toll shopping centre
in Edinburgh.
Defence lawyer Eric Scott asked Sheriff Roger Craik, QC, for continuation until
December 13 to allow the defence time to prepare its case.

Judy Mackie reveals how a hospital gives a touch of assurance on pre-natal
care, while Ann Shaw finds that a Glasgow research initiative could save
babies' lives
PREGNANT women waiting for ultrasound scans at Aberdeen Maternity Hospital can
now put their fingers right on the pulse of pre-natal care, thanks to a new
multimedia marvel.
Instead of flicking through magazines in the waiting-room, women and their
partners can discover all they need to know about ultrasound scanning,
pre-natal tests - and even meet the hospital staff - simply by touching a
screen.
The interactive multimedia touchscreen is the first of its kind in Britain,
using full motion digital video and sound to answer the thousand-and-one
questions pregnant women - especially first-time mothers - have about their
unborn baby's health.
A joint initiative by Aberdeen Royal Hospitals Trust and Aberdeen University,
the touchscreen is being piloted in the ultrasound department at the request of
Dr Pat Smith and her colleagues.
``We found that a lot of women were coming for scans with no idea what was
ahead of them, or why they were being carried out. Many did not realise that
scanning can pick up problems. The touchscreen is an ideal way to give them
easy-to-digest information in advance,'' she says.
``It's not designed to replace staff, but to complement our services by giving
women and their partners a basis for asking further questions.''
With the colourful new touchscreen, waiting suddenly becomes a pleasant
pastime, as its wealth of information appears at your fingertips. A basic menu,
which includes "meet the staff", "scans", "blood tests", "some problems", and
"your baby", leads the viewer down a multitude of paths, introducing clips of
individual staff, who tell you about their job; explaining the different types
of scans offered at different stages of pregnancy; giving information about
amniocentesis and other blood tests; outlining possible problems which may be
picked up (while reassuring that these are in the minority), and showing
detailed ultrasound pictures of the baby in the womb, with close-ups of its
face and vital organs.
Kelly and Stuart Stephen, from Aberdeen, have explored the entire programme
during their scanning visits and Kelly, 21, who is 21 weeks pregnant with her
first baby, says she has found it both fascinating and reassuring. ``I've read
books about all these subjects, but the touchscreen brings everything to life.
My favourite section is seeing what the baby looks like at different stages of
its development.''
Stuart, 24, a nurse at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, is impressed by the
programme's simplicity.
``I know how confusing medical language can be, but this programme gives
information - including what can go wrong - in a straightforward, concise way.
The great thing is, people can go over it again and again in a way they feel
they can't when they're speaking to doctors or nurses.''
Dr Smith is delighted with the amount of positive feedback from patients and
visitors to the department and she points out that the new system's
implications may reach far beyond pre-natal care alone.
According to the Aberdeen Royal Hospitals Trust, this type of multimedia
programme, designed under the direction of Dr Neil Hamilton, of the University
Faculty of Medicine's computer-aided learning unit, may also be used in
teaching medical students and training post-graduate, nursing, and paramedical
personnel.
BABIES born prematurely are more likely to suffer from physical and mental
handicap, to be smaller, and to have breathing problems, or even die, than
those born full term. Yet the mechanism that triggers labour remains a mystery.
While enormous strides have been made in paediatric care and babies as young as
26 weeks can survive successfully, medical research is keen to establish why
some women should go into labour prematurely. After all, for the baby to have
the best start in life it should remain within the womb for the full term.
In animals it is known that nitric oxide, a newly discovered substance,
controls the start of labour. But the production of this powerful agent
declines sharply before labour starts. In addition, once the animal is in
labour much larger quantities of nitric oxide are required to stop the womb
contracting.
Now a new research project in Glasgow, based at the Queen Mother Hospital and
Royal Infirmary, hopes to establish if the same mechanism applies to women. If
it does, it will be possible to develop new treatments or drugs to stop labour
occurring before the baby is fully developed.
Dr Jane Norman, a senior lecturer at the Glasgow University of obstetrics and
gynaecology, who is one of the research team, says: ``We know very little about
what triggers the onset of labour except that women who smoke and those from
poorer social backgrounds are more likely to go into labour early.''
The Glasgow study will involve taking small sections of tissue from women
undergoing Caesarean section both at nine months and those having a section
earlier.
If the key to premature labour can be unlocked it means that in the future
suitable drugs could be given to prevent the onset. Meanwhile, the first task
facing Glasgow doctors and scientists is to establish the mechanism by which it
happens in the first place. Ultimately, this could prevent the deaths of around
300 babies a year and prevent handicap in many more.
This two-year research project, jointly funded by Wellbeing (formerly
Birthright) and the Medical Research Council, started a few weeks ago and over
the next couple of years 40 women will be recruited to it.
More than half the required #64,000 Wellbeing contribution has been raised in
Glasgow during the past year, earning the local branch the title of number one
fundraiser in the UK. Chairman Maria Dorrian says: ``We are delighted that
money raised in Glasgow should go to fund research taking place here.''
n Scottish Ballet are staging a gala charity performance of Peter Pan on
Friday, December 15 at the Theatre Royal, Glasgow, in aid of Wellbeing. Tickets
from the theatre box office or phone Maria Dorrian on 01360 620758.

NORTH Sea oil output climbed to its highest level for nearly 10 years in
October and, with four more fields coming on stream this month and next,
production is set to exceed its previous all-time high by the year-end.
The Royal Bank of Scotland Oil Index, published yesterday, reveals that output
rose by 150,000 barrels per day last month to an average of 2.74 million bpd.
Production was only marginally adrift of the record level of 2.78 million bpd
recorded in January 1986.
Mark Shea, Royal Bank's energy economist, said yesterday that he expected oil
production to reach a record level before the New Year.
Two new fields came on stream during October, accounting for nearly half of the
increase in output.
Amerada Hess's Fife added 44,000 bpd to the production total, while LASMO's
Birch boosted output to the tune of 21,000 bpd.
Production at existing oil fields was also buoyant.
The four new fields due on stream are expected to add at least another 140,000
bpd to output.
During October, the average Brent crude price was 0.8% lower than the previous
month at $16.55, partly as a result of unwarranted fears that Iraq might be
allowed to make a one-off sale of oil on humanitarian grounds.
In spite of this, average daily oil revenues were up 3.6% at #28.7m.
Commenting on the North Sea outlook, Mr Shea said: ``I think it is pretty
promising and the figures to date are supporting that.''
As more new projects come on stream, oil output is expected to continue to rise
next year and in 1997, before reaching a plateau.
Part of the rise in production can be attributed to the ever more sophisticated
techniques being used by oil companies, as well as their increasing reliance on
large service companies' specialist knowledge.
However, although this is all generally good news for the local economy, Mr
Shea believes the efficiency drive might see some of the smaller service
companies put out of business.
An increase in heating demand during October pushed gas output up 9.1% to an
average of 5679 million cubic feet per day.
Taking oil and gas together, average daily revenues were 5.2% higher than in
September at #39.46m.

<HEADLINE>Pressure mounts as CBI calls for immediate reduction, while Halifax leads way to cheaper borrowing Clarke plays down rate cut moves</HEADLINE>

THE Confederation of British Industry called for a cut in interest rates and
the Halifax Building Society led the way to cheaper mortgages after the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, played down the chances of an
imminent move.
Mr Clarke denied that his forecast of 3% growth next year was dependent on
rates being cut. ``The one thing I am not going to do is play fast and loose
with interest rates in response to political pressures,'' he said.
He insisted that rates would be decided on the basis of all the evidence
available at his monthly meetings with the Governor of the Bank of England,
Eddie George.
The next meeting is due to take place on December 13, and speculation persisted
that rates would be cut by half a point then.
Mr Clarke told a news conference at the Treasury that rates would continue to
be set with the aim of hitting the Government's underlying inflation target of
2.5% or less.
Speculation about a cut in rates swirled around the City and Westminster and
continued to drag down the pound on foreign markets. Sterling lost ground to
both the dollar and the mark and its trade weighted index dropped 0.5 points to
82.4, close to its all-time low.
Share prices broke fresh records and gilts, hit by the greater than expected
public borrowing figures in Tuesday's Budget, held up well in anticipation of
lower rates. The FTSE-100 Share index closed 6.7 points higher at 3655.5, some
way below its peak earlier in the day of 3671.0.
The Halifax cut its mortgage rates from 7.99% to 7.74% to kick start the
housing market, which received no special treatment in the Budget. As others
followed its lead it became clear Abbey National was anticipating a cut in base
rates.
The mortgage cuts have taken some of the pressure off the Chancellor to deliver
an early reduction in rates, which have been held at 6.75% since February.
The CBI, however, turned up the heat on Mr Clarke. Its president, Sir Bryan
Nicholson, said: ``The CBI believes the conditions are now right for a
sustainable reduction in interest rates.''
The Budget was a responsible one, with falling borrowing, and only a mild
stimulus to the economy, he said. ``As a result the inflation outlook remains
favourable and, in the light of continued slow growth, we believe that the time
is right for a 0.5% cut in interest rates.''
Sir Bryan described Mr Clarke's forecast of 3% growth in the economy next year
as optimistic, but said it was achievable.
The CBI itself is forecasting 2.5% and Sir Bryan said the main difference
between the CBI's and the Government's forecasts was the outlook for consumer
spending, which Mr Clarke is predicting will increase by 3.5%.
Financial markets have been wrong-footed by the Chancellor's forecast of
#22.5bn PSBR for 1996-97, well above City projections, and the strength of his
economic forecasts. The pound has borne the bulk of the strain.
Independent economists are now divided on whether a cut in rates is needed yet,
and the weakness of sterling has persuaded several that any reduction should be
deferred until next year when fresh evidence will be available about the state
of the economy.
The Bundesbank council meets in the morning to decide whether the German
discount rate should be cut from 3.5% to 3%. There was speculation that if
Germany's central bank failed to deliver, the pound could come under renewed
pressure.
The Budget also revised the current year's PSBR from the mid-summer forecast of
#23.6bn to #29bn. The Bank of England announced yesterday that it would need an
extra gilts auction on February 28 to bridge the gap between revenues and
spending.
``The Government and the Bank have reviewed the remit for funding in 1995-96 in
the light of the Government's forecast of the PSBR published in the
Chancellor's Budget,'' it said.
The next auction will take place on December 7 when the Bank will offer #3000m
of 7.5% gilts maturing in 2006.

VIRGIN boss Richard Branson pays a flying visit to Glasgow today to ask what
has become of the great Scottish entrepreneur.
As one of the UK's top entrepreneurs himself, he is expected to tell Scottish
business leaders that they have a key role to play in reversing a negative
attitude which exists in Scotland towards the spirit of enterprise.
``What Scotland needs is more Kwik-Fit and Scottish &amp; Newcastle type companies
if the economy is to prosper, said Mr Branson. ``But the only way that will
happen is to encourage the 18,19 or 20 year-olds to start a new business.''
Mr Branson is expected to repeat his message tonight at a dinner to launch The
Entrepreneurial Exchange, which is being described as the most ambitious bid
yet to turn Scotland into a nation of self-made business people.

SHIELD Diagnostics, the Dundee company which makes specialist kits to diagnose
a variety of medical conditions, is achieving strong sales growth, writes
ROBERT POWELL.
But problems with the supply of raw materials for its successful syphilis
diagnosis kit held back profits in the six months to September 30.
Pre-tax profits rose to #43,600 from #19,500, but were well below City
expectations. The share price, which rose 25p earlier this week in anticipation
of a good result, closed down 6p at 106p.
But with sales growing 21% to #2.73m at the half-way stage and six new products
due to be launched in the second half of the year, the prospects for Shield
Diagnostics look bright.
The hi-tech company was floated on the stock market in 1993 and broke into
profit for the first time last year. Founded by a group of medical researchers
at Dundee University, it has grown by acquisition.
Now Shield Diagnostics is developing a new technology which will allow fresh
blood to be tested for a variety of conditions without being centrifuged first
to produce serum.
Finance director David Evans said this rapid assay technology should reach
commercial production in 12 to 15 months.
In the more immediate future, Shield Diagnostic's commercial success hinges on
the results of a clinical analysis of a blood protein called factor XII.
Shield Diagnostics enjoyed strong demand during the first half for its syphilis
diagnosis kits and its auto-immune products, most of which detect rheumatic
diseases.
Although profits seem unlikely to grow much this year, the outlook for 1995-96
is more promising.
Greig Middleton is pencilling in a pre-tax profit of #900,000 on turnover of
#7m in 1996-97 and expects the company to continue growing by acquisition.

A FORMER minder for footballer Duncan Ferguson was given 200 hours of community
service yesterday for importing 20 stun guns.
Andrew Spence, 24, of Cecil Street, Stirling, was also fined #500.
Sheriff Eric Galt said Spence had tried to hoodwink Customs when he had the
100,000 volt electrical weapons mailed to him.
A jolt from the weapons was capable of knocking a man flat and leaving him
helpless for several minutes, prosecutor Kenneth Donnelly said.
Mr Joe Beltrami, defending, said the guns had no lasting effect on their
victims.
The parcels, from a Washington firm, were described as containing personal
alarms. Spence had asked the firm to say that the guns had been sent by mistake
if asked by authorities.

IT'S that time of year again - the hot breath of Christmas like a charging
rhino on the back of the neck. Auditions have begun for the Baby Jesus. The
limbless and the disfigured have been discarded. Seems hard, I know, but if
you've ever tried scrubbing ball-point pen squiggles off a baby's head you'll
understand. The arms and legs screwed back in, but frankly they weren't going
to rate a chance against fierce competition. Don't want to be stitched up by
someone who's spent an entire weekend hand-sewing sequinned swaddling clothes.
Our main contender, formerly Sadie, now known as The Stump, sadly won't even
get a shot. Her head vanished. We found it, eventually, impaled on a wooden
stake at the back door. A forgotten victim of Hallowe'en, all tangled hair and
washed-out rosebud mouth. Then there's the fear that she might fall apart, lose
her head as it were, at the crucial moment.
Imagine the embarrassment if your star's head bounced down the stage steps?
Only a director of the calibre of Mike Leigh or Tarantino could deal with that.
Whereas Mrs Turner is more into set-piece tableaux, I think. She could always
pretend she was aiming more for Damien Hirst than Nativity Retro. That it was
an ironic stab at Mother and Child Divided as seen through the glistening eyes
of Primary One parents of Stockbridge, something like that.
Safer I suppose to make do with second choice then, one of a set of twins. We'd
like to enter the male, just to keep to Mrs Turner's strict production values,
but we can't remember which is which since they lack anatomical precision and
their matching babysuits, in pink and blue, disappeared ages ago. A broody cat
was implicated.
Dread sets in at the very prospect of auditions for the supporting cast. Look,
I said, this is ludicrous. There's absolutely no way everyone can be Mary, or
The Angel. It's absolutely fine to be cast as one of the crowd. Just so long as
they don't try that one on you. Ho, ho, only joking. Am I hell.
THE panic attacks are late for the time of year. Only, how many days is it
again till Christmas? No, don't tell me. Not yet. Strategic denial, I think is
called for here. I'm too busy dealing with anxiety attacks over the birthday
party next week. Red-ringed panic in on the Filofax for a week on Friday.
That's a lie. I did once own one of those horrible organisers - it was a gift
from another former friend - but I never found the sticky Urgent notes on the
day-by-day diary until it patently wasn't any longer.
Still the party's organised, sort of. The invitations went out yesterday. No, I
said, we can't invite everyone. It's just such a terrible wrench to choose who
should be left out. No, I said, I know I'm being negative but couldn't we just
sort of hide the invitations, you know, in their schoolbags? It's terribly
cruel to those who're left out. As we know, don't we darling, because of what
happened last week.
Here, hang on, you haven't invited her have you? Anyway, I did the sensible
thing. Ran away, left her to dish out the invitations and inferiority
complexes. Plugged fingers in ears dimmed the sound of Ruth's sobs which caught
up with me at the playground gates. Oh couldn't we just sort of slip her in as
an extra . . ? No. You're right. You can't invite everyone. God, it's tough
being only five and being rejected. It's even tougher being to blame.
The party of course happens to be on the same day as the drama show. Well why
not? Why should Sod change his law just to prevent hysteria in overwrought
working mothers? We'll cope. Of course, we will. It only involves some rigorous
organisation. Precision timing, such as Olympic judges only dream of. We will
bring the party forward half an hour, arrange for the Munchkin costume to go in
the boot along with the cake. Oh no. The cake . . .
What you need to do is learn to prioritise, go on a time-management course,
said a friend, who was until she made her suggestion. She's probably right, but
how can I? I don't have time.
If there's one thing I've learned it's how easy it is to push worries away when
you're racked with guilt. Consuming guilt. Ravaging guilt. Such as how can I be
in three places at once, the carol concert, the ballet show, and do the gift
buying? Oh and get to the office. Polishing off 1200 words of budgetary
analysis is a doddle by comparison. Then I only have to pretend it's important.
See Christmas. I love it.

THREE thousand temporary jobs in the voluntary sector will be lost as a result
of the Government's decision to cut the Community Action programme for
long-term unemployed adults, according to the Scottish Council for Voluntary
Organisations.
Community Action, introduced in 1993, is delivered through the Employment
Service and offers temporary work opportunities to adults unemployed for more
than six months.
Work undertaken on the programme has to be of demonstrable benefit to the
community and not a substitute for jobs that existed already in the public and
private sectors. Community Action has therefore largely been sub-contracted out
to voluntary organisations. The move, announced on Tuesday, has angered
voluntary organisations which deliver Community Action, particularly as the
Chancellor did not refer to the move in his Budget statement.
Mr Ian Brown, enterprise and training officer with SCVO, said: ``Kenneth Clarke
barely referred to unemployment in his statement, but Employment Service
officials were press-releasing Community Action's obituary before he had even
sat down.
``The cynicism is even more apparent given last year's Budget, when the
Chancellor promised that Community Action funding would continue until 1997.
There is no pretence that this cut is anything but a Treasury-driven saving to
offset Budget giveaways.''
Community Action providers said the programme was popular with long-term
participants and that its wide range of projects benefited the community.
Margaret Thorne of the Scottish Wildlife Trust said: ``Unless we can find
alternative sources of funding within the next four weeks, our programme of
environmental projects will be cut by a quarter, with a corresponding number of
staff redundancies.''
Mr Jim Cooper, speaking on behalf of the Scottish Council for YMCAs, said:
``Clearly this is a tragedy for the long-term unemployed. Yet again the
Government has spent a lot of time and resources building up a programme, only
to scrap it. This is bound to lead to redundancies among our staff.''

YORKSHIRE Water has increased its half-yearly profits and dividend at a time
when its customers face the possibility of having their supplies cut off
because of drought.
Profits before tax jumped by 48% to #99.5m but that was before taking into
account exceptional costs and the profit from the sale of investment. On an
underlying basis profit growth was 10.1%.
In the first half, coping with the drought occupied both the company and its
customers. Measures to maintain supplies were introduced in the summer
including transportation of water by road into West Yorkshire.
The company also obtained a series of emergency drought powers to extract water
from two rivers to maintain supplies to Bradford and Leeds.
The exceptional operating costs incurred to date - including the #4.6m reported
to end-September - are estimated to be in the region of #20m. The on-going
costs (principally of tankering water into West Yorkshire) are around #3m a
week. These measures are expected to continue until reservoirs reach what are
described as ``safe levels''.
A number of capital projects are being introduced at a cost of #75m to provide
additional resources, principally from river abstractions. Some #13m has
already been spent on schemes to help maintain supplies.
A #12m pilot programme has been established to investigate leakage reduction in
addition to the existing #330m mains and leakage reduction programmes.
Yorkshire rebuts criticism that its under-investment contributed to this
summer's problems. It says investment in both water resources and the
distribution infrastructure has been in line with, or exceeded, the ``K''
investment programme over the last five years.
Non-regulated activities continued to be profitable, albeit at a lower level.
Yorkshire Environmental's profit of #800,000 compares with #1.3m for last year.
Profits were hit by costs and delays in its waste incineration business, White
Rose Environmental. Its turnover rose by 8.2% to #25m.
The group's property interests continue to expand and profits moved up slightly
in the estates business. Yorkshire Water International continues to examine
overseas opportunities within a tightly controlled business development budget.
Group earnings per share jumped by 47.6% and the interim dividend is raised by
10% to 9.1p. The outlook for the second half will be determined by costs
associated with managing the drought situation. However, the group remains
confident of its medium-term prospects, not least because of the expectation of
a growing contribution from its non-regulated activities.
Shares in Yorkshire Water dropped 2p to 612p.
n SWALEC said it would reject an indicative cash and share offer from Welsh
Water at 825p to 840p made at talks yesterday.
The indicative price was for Swalec shares excluding its holding in the
National Grid but with its interim dividend, which will be announced with
first-half results today. Welsh Water offered a full cash alternative at a
discount to these levels.
A further meeting between the two companies today could yield a higher offer.
