We have a VIP salon away from the window which caters to those people
who are shy. But it's surprising how many people don't mind being in the
window
THERE ARE certain functions of human existence that once remained
private, inviolate, and shielded against the gaze of the world. Alas, no
more. The intrusion of the public glare is ever more comprehensive. It
seems there is hardly a place to hide.
Time was a gentleman's club was his fortress, a lady's tearoom was her
cloister. There were places to hide in the world, away from prying eyes.
There was sanctuary.
As aforementioned, alas.
Remember when Parliament was private? When we were not subjected to
the inanity and banality and crassness of our exalted leaders.
The House of Lords was a mystery to us all (and a case could be made
that it still is, despite the cameras) conducting its dry and dusty
business behind heavy oaken doors.
And if any of us wanted a flutter, we could go to the bookie's and
place a bet in the knowledge that whatever we did in the blower would be
considered as sacred as the confessional. The high priest of Ladbrokes
or Joe Coral would take the offering, confer his blessing, and it was a
ceremony in camera.
Now the law has been changed, for whatever obscure reason, that
exposes the gamblers among us to public scrutiny. Betting-shop windows
have been defrosted, and what was done behind the blinds and blackouts,
on the other side of closed doors, is now a public spectacle.
For the first time, passers-by on the street can see what us gamblers
are up to, and if this is set to cast a new light on the betting
industry, much of it will simply be daylight. Betting shops, once dens
of iniquity shrouded in mystery, are now completely unshrouded.
Not a good thing, according to the Church of Scotland who recently
denounced the changes. The Convener of the Board of Social
Responsibility said there was no need for it, but that it's all part of
the Government's move to encourage gambling.
Maybe so, maybe so. Looked upon conversely and the opposite might be
true.
''Were you in that bookie's shop?'' a matron might demand to know of
an errant shilpit spouse.
''Naw hen, ah wisnae,'' he'd no doubt shiftily reply.
''Ye wiz seen, ye lyin' scunner,'' would come the retort nanoseconds
before the centripetal weight of the swung handbag. ''An' I'll be
watching out next Setterday.''
Openness in bookies' shop windows could, under those circumstances, be
bad for the business. The only serious flutter might be the palpitations
of the heart as the compulsive punter braves her wrath to feed his
habit.
Bookmakers have not been steeplechasing to let the sunshine in to
their premises. When the law was changed, a couple of days before the
Grand National, the only one in Scotland with a window on the world was
apparently William Hill's new premises in Glasgow's Tollcross.
Regional Director Ralph Topping said: ''We are introducing a new
design for our premises. But it doesn't mean they will all be thrown
wide open, for we have found that punters don't really want that.
''Most of our windows have valuable display space, and for us the most
significant change in the law is that we can advertise current races and
matches in our own windows.
''In Tollcross, in our new shop, we have semi-open windows. In
general, betting shops will have windows in open areas, but they won't
be completely open.''
Indeed. In the interests of furthering the sum of human knowledge, one
took a trip to Tollcross to see the new glasnost betting shops where
openness has overthrown the decades of oppressive secrecy.
Standing with one's nose pressed up against the glass was an
invitation for immediate arrest, or to be beaten up as an SS snooper,
but none of these things happened on a sunny day in the East End.
Through the window, one could see tables and chairs, ranks or banks of
television screens showing horses and dogs at varying speeds. Through
the glass of the other window, men were hunched over the wall-desks,
eyes glued to the racing pages or the timetables or the odds board. Some
were writing on papers.
There was no compulsion to rush in and join them. Betting is not a
visual art. Spectator sport it ain't. One wouldn't pay money to watch
fellows bet. It is as interesting as watching porridge solidify.
Intrepid or not, this writer hoped he was not observed standing sadly
alone on the outside looking in. He wore an anorak as a disguise.
Yet as one sanctuary yields its secrets, it becomes apparent that the
days of privacy are days gone by. They are no more.
I remember as a youngster, being taken to a tearoom (an exalted
occasion then, possibly financed by an avuncular win at the bookies)
where the treat was a pyramid of French fancies and teacakes on a silver
salver. The light was subtle and indirect, for, like every tearoom, this
place had what they called ''cafe curtains'', green shades suspended
from a polished wooden bar, allowing in just enough illumination to make
sure a child didn't miss his mouth with the cake spoon.
Eating out was a private affair, even in public. Dining was mainly a
function for one's own home and not to be spectated upon. So was
drinking.
No more. Windows are in, and people have to be in them. Where once a
line up of shoes in Saxones showed the goods, or a display of colours in
a fruit shop tempted the buyer, or even the expertise of the fishmonger
with his white signwriting offered his wares, the customer is now the
big attraction.
A generation back people ate behind curtains and wouldn't have dreamed
of displaying their table manners to the world at large. Nowadays you
can hardly eat without putting on a show.
McDonald's were not the first, but they have always been the Big Macs
at promotion, and who better to promote than the munchkins themselves?
An encounter in the street with a punter with chips and vinegar will
spark off an irresistible demand for the product. Standing like orphans
at Christmas, looking through a window while others stuff themselves
with fries and burgers, can make them irresistible, no matter what's in
them.
McDonald's customers advertise the wares, as do Burger Kingers,
Pancake Placers and many more.
Even heading-upmarket boutiques have cafes. There are plenty of folk
who'd rather be seen having a cappuccino in Next's cafe than at What
Every's.
In Glasgow's Glassford Street, The Gallery has taken it a step
further, by siting the benches face-on to the windows so that poseurs
can get down to some serious display. As skirts get shorter, the crowd
of young lads spectating is sure to get larger. This writer wore an
anorak at this scene too.
Pubs have gone for freedom of information. Day was one could go into a
howff sure in the knowledge that it was dark and smoke-filled and awash
with bunnetted punters. Nowadays, especially in the West End, it's
uncannily similar to boarding a plane.
Smoking or non-smoking? Bottle or glass, red or white? Aisle or
window?
On a hot summer nights, all four of them at this latitude, the sight
of a cold lager going down is enough to drive you to drink, and
frequently does. It's getting to the stage where breweries will soon
have to employ someone just to wipe the nose-smudges off the windows.
It doesn't stop at pubs. Hairdressers too are now side-shows in the
commercial street theatre. Those of us follically bereft need not worry,
but for thousands of people, their tonsorial primping is all part of the
act.
Taylor Ferguson, in Bath Street is a confirmed public snipper.
''Some people like to sit in the window,'' he says. ''specially if
they are getting a colour which might take some time. They can watch the
world go by. From the outside, people like to see what the place looks
like.
''Having open windows ensures that salons are clean and bright and
well designed.
''Some folk, however, don't like getting their hair done in public,
including some people from newspapers. We have a VIP salon away from the
window which caters to those people who are shy. But it's surprising how
many people don't mind being in the window.''
Where will it end? Will it end, this continuing and continuous
exposure to the world's eye view? Probably not. Where some things once
sacred are now de-sanctified, the sacred cows of today stand on shoogly
altars.
We follow America on these issues. They have their OJ trial which has
addicted a sizable percentage of the population. They are on the verge
of televising judicial murder.
Television cameras capture us sneaking through red lights or breaking
the limits. Electronic eyes watch us in shopping malls.
Privacy is a thing of the past.
In a recent remarkable documentary in China, a scene showed a crowd of
spectators lounging outside a dentist's open window, expertly discussing
the intricacies of the extraction and filling. That such a thing could
happen here is not only possible, but likel.
As medicine becomes ever more a private matter, it will become a
public affair as Trusts seek new ways of earning a buck.
Roll up for the Appendix Op. Tickets here for the by-pass. Spinal Tap,
The Movie.
There is only one place, it seems, to hide. At least for now.
Hopefully nobody will pass a law that insists that we have the same
glasnost in that smallest room of the house. But don't bet on it.
The only secrets these days are the ones a government wants to keep
from us. Big Brother, very soon, could be watching us all.

THE #620m Electra Investment Trust is linking up with investment house
Robert Fleming to bring together Electra's appetite for investment in
unlisted securities and Fleming's international expertise and
connections.
Fleming is to take a 50% stake in Electra Kingsway Managers Holdings
which will be re-named Electra Fleming Holdings. The cost is around
#29.5m, which values the new grouping at #59m.
The rationale behind the deal is that Electra needs to invest between
#150m and #200m a year in unlisted securities such as management buyouts
which account for approximately 67% of #764m portfolio as of end March.
However, there is severe competition in the UK at present and Electra
is being forced to look overseas. Fleming is represented in 34
countries, thanks in part to its Jardine Fleming joint venture in the
Far East, and it wants to be more heavily invested in unquoted
securities which currently are a relatively minor part of its
activities.
One significant advantage is that Fleming as agreed to put up an
underwriting facility of up to #75m on any one transaction.
In essence, Electra would find a situation and be prepared to put in
#75m with Fleming immediately behind with additional capacity. So in a
large management buy-out deal which could involve both equity and debt,
there would be up to #300m available.
That gives Electra a powerful negotiating position in seeking to
sponsor a deal. The Fleming commitment would be reduced first through
selling on the equity participation to other institutions.
Director Lawrence Banks, who is chairman of Caledonian Publishing,
owner of The Herald, said it would not be the intention of the bank to
hold the investments but to re-cycle the money. Fleming capital
resources amount to #852m.
No indication is being given of the profitability of Electra Kingsway.
The acquisition cost is made up of a direct payment to Electra of
#7.5m for the Electra name and the extension of the management contract
from two to three years.
The major component of #22m is being used to buy out the institutional
shareholders and management.
In 1989, Electra Investment Trust took a 49.9% stake in Electra
Kingsway while 30.1% was taken up by seven institutional shareholders
and 20% by management led by Mr Michael Stoddart which put in #757,000
and are set to receive #8.7m.
Mr Stoddart retired as executive chairman of Electra Kingsway in May
to be succeeded by Fred Vinton but remains as non-executive chairman of
the Electra parent company. They managers will receive #11.45 per share
which will result in Mr Stoddart receiving #1.47m while managing
director Hugh Mumford will be paid #952,000.
Electra's half-time results outperformed in the six months to March
with net assets up 2.57% to 390.02p compared with a 1.83% gain by the
FTSE All-Share Index.
By the end of May, net asset value had advanced to 405.1p and it
further increased to about 2p because of the flotation of the McBride
household chemicals group and 3.8p due to the Fleming deal.
Pre-tax profits declined 28% to #7.9m as the comparable period was
boosted by two exceptionally large disposals. However, the dividend has
been raised 4.2% to 3.7p.
The shares rose 8p to 358p.

SCOTTISH Hydro-Electric chief executive Roger Young saw his total
remuneration package rise 6.3% to #288,047 last year although the
overall cost of the board declined marginally by #4000 to #926,000.
All directors saw a reduction in benefit in kind where they receive
these, in part reflecting the reduced tax advantages of the company car.
Mr Young's bonus payments more than doubled, from #19,642 to #40,545,
equivalent to 20% of his basic salary which rose slightly to just over
#194,000.
The most he can earn by way of cash incentive is 30% above his basic
pay although he has a considerable asset lying in wait in the future
through his share options. These total just under 272,000 with the first
tranche of 221,519 exercisable now at a price of 237p. That compares
with the current Hydro share price of 326p and represents a gross profit
before tax of #197,000.

SCOTLAND has escaped the worst of the housing recession, partly
because when prices boomed down south, those north of the border
remained relatively cheap.
Earlier this week, the Halifax Building Society reported that house
prices in Britain fell by 0.4% in June, the fourth consecutive monthly
fall. And house buyers, it seems, have gone into hiding once again with
the big corporate estate agents reporting a near 7% decline in sales
since the beginning of the year.
This is bad news for the building societies and banks who earn their
living from mortgage lending. Poaching customers from each other is now
their major source of new business. Gone are the days when home buyers
stayed with the same lender from the day they bought their first home,
through various moves, to the time they repaid their loan. Now many more
people are prepared to change lender to get the best possible deal.
But remortgaging is not just a matter of comparing the cost of the
monthly repayments. There are other figures to be taken into account. If
you are changing lender, rather than simply negotiating a better deal
with your existing one, there are legal and survey fees to be paid. And
most special deals charge an arrangement fee of a few hundred pounds.
But worst of all are the penalties lurking in the small print which
tie you to your new lender long after the special deal has expired.
The Britannia currently has one of the best two-year fixed rates at
5.19%. However, you are then tied to it for a total of five years if you
want to avoid a penalty of 180 days interest if you pay off your
mortgage in the first three years, falling to 120 days if you repay in
the next two. The early repayment penalty on a #50,000 mortgage at
Britannia's current variable rate of 8.44% is #2081 in the first three
years and #1387 in the next two.
Until this week, the Yorkshire Building Society offered a rate of 1.9%
fixed until April 1996. That was one of the most attractive deals
anywhere in the market until you saw the size of the penalty if you
failed to stay with it for a full five years. Here the charge is six
months interest in the first two years, three months in the next two and
one month in year five.
The Scottish banks also extract their pound of flesh in redemption
penaltes. The Bank of Scotland has a range of discounts which can cut
the interest rate to just 1% in the first six months, if you are
borrowing less than 95% of valuation, or 1.5% if you need to borrow up
to 100%. However, if you repay your mortgage during the first four years
you repay the discount.
AT the Royal Bank of Scotland the first-time buyer discount, which
cuts its rate to 3.94% until October 1996, must be repaid if you redeem
your mortgage in the first three years. On the one, two and three-year
fixed and two-year capped rates the penalty is three months interest if
repayment is made in the first three years.
There is growing evidence that mortgage lenders are tightening the
penalty screw on their fixed-rate and discounted mortgages.
The country's biggest lender, the Halifax, has extended the tie-in
period on its two-year fixed-rate mortgage from four to five years and
the penalty has been increased from 3.8% to 5% of the loan. This pushes
up the penalty on a #50,000 loan from #1900 to #2500.
And the Leeds, which used to be one of the few big lenders not to tie
fixed-rate borrowers up with penalties at the end of the term, has now
moved into line with the Halifax by also charging a 5% penalty in the
first five years of a fixed-rate mortgage.
The Bradford &amp; Bingley has extended its tie-in period from three to
five years, and where the penalty used to be three months interest it is
now 5% of the loan.

<HEADLINE>Venture capital trusts will be risky but the tax breaks are good. Exciting ventures</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>KEN CLAY</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<TEXT>
IF all goes well, we may see venture capital trusts laid out for our
inspection as early as September, but it may not be until spring next
year. The management groups interested in creating such trusts, and
there are several, are the ones prepared to take the time and trouble to
find and follow unquoted companies which they think offer prospects for
growth.
Venture capital trusts, which will be a new type of investment trust,
will have full Stock Exchange listings. They will have to be looked on
as risky for the simple reason that they will be investing in very small
companies -- up to #10m in gross assets is the Treasury imposed limit.
To get all the attractive tax breaks, they will also have to satisfy
other conditions. Accountant KPMG says the main ones are that they must
invest 70% of their assets in unquoted companies and that, while this
can be a mixture of shares and other securities, 30% of the 70% has to
be in shares.
Finding suitable investments will not be the work of a moment, so each
trust will have three years to spend its money. It will need this time
as there will be an overall limit of #1m per company.
A major attraction of these trusts will be the tax breaks, but a tax
break is no use if your investment goes down the Swanee, so the first
thing for the individual investor to consider will be the credentials of
the trust's managers, who at the moment look like including such names
as 3i, Murray Johnstone and Electra.
Loughlin Hickey, a partner with KPMG Tax Advisers, comments that the
new funds are expected to be able to offer the same tax deferrals on
capital gains and also a one-off initial income tax relief of 20% -- a
total initial tax relief of 60% -- as would be available for individual
direct investors in new issues by unquoted companies. On top of that,
any gain on a rise in value of investments would be exempt from capital
gains tax and dividends from the companies will also be tax free.
Going for companies which will join the Alternative Investment Market
will be an attractive option for these funds as AIM companies, although
hardly regulated at all by the Stock Exchange, will have been introduced
to the market by advisers approved by it. These advisers, if they want
to stay on the Exchange's approved list, will have to keep a close eye
on their companies and ensure they make all the disclosures required.
The tax concessions apply to shares on a new issue by a company and
are conditional on the investor keeping the holding for five years.
Similar provisions will apply to the venture capital trusts, so
outside investors wanting to take a stake in AIM companies by this route
will need to make their investment at the time a trust is floated and
hold the shares for five years. That suggests the after market will be
somewhat illiquid, but sales there will be, if only from deceased
estates. And, although the initial tax breaks will have been lost,
investors may still find such trusts attractive once they have a track
record because future capital gains and dividend payments will still be
tax free.
Either way, they could be an appealing addition to the annual personal
equity plan allowance (assuming that is not removed or reduced by a
future government concerned by the ever-growing flow of dividends
escaping the clutches of the Inland Revenue). Up to #100,000 a year can
be invested on flotation to get the full tax breaks, rolling over
taxable capital gains for five years.
The new AIM got off to a predictably slow start -- only 10 companies
on it on day one -- because of the delays in getting the new public
offer rules from the Government and the list of approved ''nominated
advisers'' from the Stock Exchange. But KPMG predicts that 70 companies
will have joined by the end of this year. Most, it believes, will be
graduates from the ''market'' being conducted under the Exchange's
special rule 4.2.
AIM should get a good deal busier over the next few weeks as the rule
4.2 concession finishes at the end of September, by which time companies
traded under it will have to have joined AIM or made arrangements to be
traded off the Exchange. By the end of next year there may be 200 or
more companies in the market, an ideal place for them to raise money,
and there is already talk of an AIM index to measure their progress.
The tax authorities have been kind to the new market, giving it
various concessions normally restricted to unquoted businesses. While
death is still eventually certain, not all taxes are, it seems. Mr
Hickey sees AIM as ''a very attractive option for family companies and
their inheritance planning, as a quote on it will not cause shareholders
to lose business property relief on their shares. For example, if quoted
on AIM and owning more than 25% of the shares, 100% business property
relief may be available, and if less than 25% of the shares are owned,
50% business property relief may be available.''
The costs of getting a quote on AIM vary, with some estimates
suggesting as little as #20,000, others more like #50,000 or above,
depending on whether and how much new money is being raised. Keeping the
quote looks likely to cost #50,000 a year.
As the number of companies on the market grows, so institutional
interest in it should also increase. It will clearly be a market where
losing money will be as easy as making it, but the venture capital
trusts should at least spread the risk a bit.
Meanwhile, Baronsmead, which specialises in unquoted companies, has
captured the name and plans to launch the AIM Trust within a couple of
months hoping to raise #25m. As this will be a normal investment trust,
it will not have the tax concessions.

HE may not fit the cartoonist's image of a football agent, fat, cigar
chewing, and jangling with jewellery, but Raymond Sparkes has the one
pre-requisite which goes with the label. The man whose best-known
client, John Collins, has been the subject of much transfer speculation,
can talk like a champion.
Sparkes, who recently became only the second FIFA licensed agent in
Scotland -- Bill McMurdo was first -- and is inclined to whip out his
licence in impressive, FBI style, does fit very much the smooth-talking
reputation of his breed, but he argues, inevitably with some passion,
that the new FIFA legislation, which included the posting of a #100,000
bond by prospective licensed agents, will make him and his colleagues
accountable to the ruling body.
''We are bound by FIFA regulations and can be punished if we break
them,'' said Sparkes. ''That would include deliberately planting stories
about players under contract.'' He insists that since he came into this
controversial arena, he has been quite determined to be a ''different''
type of agent.
''I want to be seen doing things correctly by my client, and by my
partners in the business, the managers and the clubs I deal with. If I
don't do that I believe I will have a short-term reign.''
He supervises the affairs of 50 players, with Collins one of seven
from Parkhead, from where his first client came, Derek Whyte, now of
Middlesbrough.
Sparkes is a rarity, not just because he is one of only two registered
and approved FIFA agents, but also because he was once on the other side
of the desk, as a director with Hibs.
In fact, he was able to see, from a short distance, the work of Bill
McMurdo as he dealt with Hibs clients, one of whom was Collins, then an
Easter Road player. Did he learn anything? ''I had a bit part in what
was going on, but the negotiations were mainly between Jim Gray and
Bill.''
Did he learn anything? ''I think I learned that Bill had a style of
man management that I could never agree with. It is a style that has
since blown up a number of times, like the Maurice Johnston and Celtic
affair, and the Frank McAvennie and Partick Thistle one.
''These things have taught me that there is a correct way to do things
and a wrong way.'' All of which might suggest that there is not exactly
a deep comradeship between the two licensed agents of the country.
At anyrate, Sparkes has his own thoughts on how the job ought to be
done. He puts it this way: ''I believe you have to develop a level of
trust with a player and let him develop trust in you, to build up a
relationship that is based on good management principles. It means you
can attach yourself to people who are prepared to listen.''
Sparkes still has a soft spot for Hibs, although he started out life
as a Celtic supporter. However, it was basketball which cultivated his
sporting-cum-business interest in the days when a certain David Murray
was the leading light in that sport.
Sparkes, who had played basketball at schoolboy level for Scotland and
Great Britain, was working for a publishing company and still involed
with his local club. That led to a job in America, where he was coaching
basketball and football (he had been an aspiring player but never got
beyond a trial for Blackpool and one or two others -- ''my career ended
because of a distinct lack of talent'').
He had done that for five successive summers when he was asked to come
back and manage Team Solripe at Coasters Arena, Falkirk. It was then
that he first sighted Murray, who ran what could be called the Rangers
of basketball, MIM.
''There is a lot I see in how David Murray is rocking Scottish
football that I saw, at a different level, when he rocked Scottish
basketball.
''David Murray worked on a budget of probably #250,000 a year at that
time, and Team Solripe were as close as anybody could get to them but on
a #70,000 budget.
Sparkes basketball team, none the less, did have the satisfaction of
winning the national cup and the national play-offs.
''I think I developed a reputation for making ends meet,'' said
Sparkes. He likes to think he and Murray shared a respect born of
competitiveness which is one reason he claims to have been disappointed
many years later when he was kept downstairs at Ibrox while his client,
Fraser Wishart, discussed terms for joining Rangers.
Sparkes, then 23, was astonished that he succeeded in winning the post
as marketing director at Easter Road. At the time he imagines he would
not be ready for such a role until he was about 30. ''I felt that there
would be so much to learn from football as compared with basketball, but
insead discovered that basketball had much to teach football.''
He found the prevailing mood in football generally, where it was the
clubs doing commerce a favour, rather than the other way round, which
had to be changed. ''I was quite appalled, not by Hibs who were trying
to change. It was a real eye opener.''
Sparkes left Hibs after a disagreement over money with chairman Kenny
Waugh, but eight months later was asked back by the new regime, headed
by David Duff and Jim Gray, a regime fated to collapse amid much
controversy. When the next regime, led by Tom Farmer, took over,
Sparkes' ''face did not fit'' but he remains proud that he achieved a
director's post and, he would argue, succeeded, in it before he was 30.
He then decided to follow a notion that had been growing in his
subconscious for some time. He started off with Derek Whyte as his first
client at Parkhead, for whom he would tell you that he negotiated a deal
with Middlesbrough worth four times what the manager at Parkhead, Liam
Brady, offered.
It is no great secret that Celtic boards, new and old, have never been
the greatest fans of agents. Current chairman Fergus McCann has declared
his view that the game could do without them. Sparkes has a ready
response. ''Fergus is only in the game five minutes, and I don't think
he should be making judgments that quickly.
What people have to remember is that the only reason we exist is
because of the way football managers and clubs treated players in the
past. If that hadn't been the case there would have been no need for us
to be here in the first place.''
He knows, as does everybody in the buisiness, that agents are very
much here to stay, but only those who can afford the FIFA licence can
take part in transfer negotiations, a rule that does not seem to have
been fully implemented as yet, at least in the south.
Their place in the game will become even more prominent if the
Jean-Marc Bosman appeal to the EC is successful. The Belgian player
wants transfer fees to be scrapped and players given the freedom
afforded all other EC workers, to move jobs when their contracts run
out, without any money passing between the employers.
Sparkes believes Bosman will win his case, the verdict of which is due
in October, and if so he anticipates even busier times trying to place
players for their own betterment. Sparkes also acknowledges that the
consequence would be beneficial for the top players.
''It will probably mean a different trading system, like they have had
in America in basketball for a long time. There could be a salary
capping system on clubs to try to prevent complete domination by a few
very rich owners. That way a salary budget is set on each club for a
season, which would mean that there would be a limit on the number of
top-priced players who could be brought in because their salaries could
not be met.
''I can remember Magic Johnston temporarily gave up some of his annual
$25m salary in order to let his club, Los Angeles Lakers, bring in a new
player because someone else was injured.''
The likelihood that many small clubs would find it difficult to
survive does not alarm him. He is of the opinion that as many as 22
current Scottish clubs cannot be considered truly professional anyway,
and would weep no tears at their demise.
''As a young man I believe I can see the big picture for Scottish
football. Instead of adding two teams, as we did, we should be getting
rid of 22.''

A FEW weeks ago Superman flew to a new post-modern high. In The New
Adventures Of Superman (BBC1, Saturday) Lois Lane was confronted by a
futuristic villain brought back by H G Wells. The villain explained that
the marriage of Lois and Superman would create utopia in the future, but
she would be ridiculed as the dumbest woman on the planet.
''Why?'' she whined. So, being a villain not entirely unfamiliar with
the term exposition, he explained. It was simple. How could she not have
noticed? Putting on a pair of glasses he said: ''I'm Clark Kent'',
taking them off he said: ''I'm Superman.'' Shock stuck to her face like
a custard pie as he teased: ''Clark Kent, Superman, Clark Kent,
Superman.''
After the attack on the specs, the baddie picked on the Man of Steel's
rather fine wardrobe. Shortly after his capture he asked why Superman
wore such a get-up. We had all wondered for years, but the answer was
sheepishly simple. ''My mom made it for me.''
Of course! Had Superman junked the cape for some cool power-suit of
chrome and black leather, he would never hear the last of it. Over
Thanksgiving dinner with mom and pop in Smallville, it would start
before the gravy hit the turkey. ''Where is that nice one I made you?
The red and blue one with the underwear on the outside. You never wear
it now!'' What's the point of super-strength if you can't keep your
mother off your back?
It's just that sort of confessional humour that has drawn adults to
the show. Yes, The New Adventures Of Superman is so good, I even talk to
my television.
Correction. I don't talk, I shout, usually instructions. It is a true
sign of the show's success that not only do you believe in the
characters, and fear for the future of Lois and Clark's fledgling
relationship -- one date, two snogs -- but you think your advice will be
heeded.
For the unaware it's like this. Clark Kent (Dean Cain) loves Lois Lane
(Teri Hatcher) who loves Superman. I know, a kind of metaphysical
menage-a-trois, but hang in there. Now every time Lois tries to confess
her feelings for Clark, he has to run off to save the world or
something.
She thinks he's scared of commitment. So last week she agreed to date
Agent Scardino, the FBI officer brought in to investigate the death of
Mason Drake -- who also fancied Clark, so she had to die, right? This is
serious. Clark being jilted by Lois -- it's who shot JR coupled with the
Iranian Embassy seige. It is, in a word, unmissable.
Superman fans unable to survive on one hour of mother's milk per week
now stretch their enjoyment on the Internet with discussion groups, such
as LOISCLA which fights for truth, justice, and a spot on the
information highway.
A brief trawl turns up some real web-crawlers. It's been reported that
Lois Lane wrapped in nothing but Superman's cape was the most popular
Internet pin-up. The LCWS hits some people rather hard. That's Lois and
Clark Withdrawal Syndrome. To try and cheer each other up during the
Christmas closed season, fans wrote carols to the tune of Jingle Bells.
Poor young Clark/In the dark
What's a guy to do
Can't disclose to his gal-pal
That he's one guy not two.
Wow!
It's enough to make you reconsider trying to convince your editor that
you would work so much harder if you had a partner like Lois Lane. Yet
the show, like the hero, rises above its fans and into the stratosphere.
Tonight's episode has Superman as a slacker.
Yes, the world's most incorruptible hero succumbs to apathy. It's not
that he doesn't want to fight crime, he just can't be bothered. It would
seem that while green kryptonite can kill the Man of Steel, red
kryptonite turns him into the average American teenager. So when Perry,
The Daily Planet's editor is kid-napped, Superman is a few feet away
asking a gorgeous girl if her name is spelt with an ''i'' or a ''y''.
The situation with Superman is so serious, Lois sets him up with her
analyst. Will Superman ever recover an enthusiasm for wearing light blue
tights and fighting crime? Can his alter-ego Clark sit still long enough
to tell Lois how he feels? Just a minute. Apathy would work wonders for
the romance between Lois and Clark.
''Drat,'' thinks Clark, ''just as I'm about to kiss Lois, my
superhearing has detected Agent Scardino's pitiful cry for help. Think
I'll leave that one to Batman.''
Now that's love.
* IT'S important to remember when watching The Russ Abbot Show
(Saturday, ITV) that this was the man responsible for singles such as
Atmosphere and All Night Holiday. Your laughs at returning favourites
such as Barrat Homes, Vince Prince, and Basildon Bond could crease and
curdle on your face when you remember lyrics like: ''At-mos-phere . . .
I love a party with a happy atmosphere'', and the video of Russ gyrating
on a dance-floor made of coloured lights. Even so, I think Russ a better
singer than comedian, and a better actor than both.
But it's a minority view. The comic muggings of C U Jimmy will always
gain a wider audience than his outstanding performances in September
Song. Cooperman and Julio Doubleglazius are bawdy summertime classics
for those who like humour marked in a neon script which reads: laugh
now. BBC enjoyed the success of six seasons of Russ Abbot's Madhouse
before he defected to ITV. The previous series dropped characters like
Basildon Bond.
Russ explained why: ''I thought it was right to rest these popular
characters for a while when I joined ITV from BBC, though I did keep
them in my live act. I believed with the change of network it was right
to give them a rest to try out some new characters and give the show
some room.
''For this series I thought it was right time to bring them back. They
are sprinkled through the series as a sort of greatest hits, we didn't
want to overkill on them -- I wanted the new characters to have room to
develop too.'' The new brew includes criminal psychologist Fatz, the man
they call Crackpot. Now what's on the other station.
* KIRSTY Wark leaves the politicians in their little puddles of sweat
to grill actor Neil Pearson of Between The Lines and Drop The Dead
Donkey fame in the third series of One Foot In The Past (BBC2,
Thursday). The heritage programme performs a nightmare service by
returning Pearson to his Suffolk school days at Woolverstone Hall. The
school pioneered a novel educational method by allowing ordinary kids to
attend a boarding school in a grand stately home.
''They took boys from Labour-voting homes, put them in a traditional
Tory setting, gave them a liberal education and turned out anarchists,''
said Pearson. It got a C for longevity -- today it's a private school.
* IN ER (C4, Wednesday) Dr Greene (Anthony Edwards), bored by the
thankless task of life-saving, swaps his scalpel and surgical scrubs for
a blood-soaked black suit and handgun then prepares to do some damage.
Will medical student, John Carter (Noah Wyle) manage to change his
mind, or will Carter become caught up in the brewing argument over the
meaning behind Madonna's Like A Virgin. It matter's little to Dr Benton
(Eriq La Salle) who has taken to dressing in black leather, hiding in a
box and answering only to his new medical moniker as Doc Gimp.
Quentin Tarantino, Reservior Dogs director, turns poacher/gamekeeper
when he directs this week's episode of the top American drama series. He
reportedly got the job after he phoned ER's producers earlier this year
and asked for tapes of episodes he had missed, then jokingly suggested
that he direct an episode. They said: ''Let's go to work.'' He said:
''We got to fit in a severed ear!'' Did he succeed?

SCOTLAND's hopes of recapturing the Home International championship
ended in Lllanelli yesterday -- without them throwing a bowl. The Scots,
who finished their programme on Thursday, were left hoping for a Channel
Islands win over Wales and an Irish victory over England to give them
the title. Neither materialized, with Wales winning 142-95 and England
127-104.
Wales' victory gave them the title for only the third time in the last
17 years. Will Thomas showed the way with a 32-11 win over Keith Ellis,
Robert Weale beat Gus McKinnon 24-14, John Price defeated Bernie Simon
28-16, Dai Wilkins edged out Cyril Renouf 19-17 and there were
single-shot victories for both Trevor Mounty and Spencer Wilshire.

MARTINA Navratilova is just one step away from her dream of adding
another Wimbledon title to her haul of 18 after reaching the final of
the mixed doubles yesterday.
Navratilova and American partner Jonathan Stark had to win twice in
the day to reach tomorrow's final. The pair completed their
quarter-final against Sandon Stolle and Mary Joe Fernandez before
winning the semi-final against top seeds Mark Woodforde of Australia and
Latvian Larisa Neiland.
In tomorrow's final they will meet fourth seeds Cyril Suk of the Czech
Republic and Gigi Fernandez of the United States.
Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, singles finalist today, also plays in the
final of the women's doubles. Sanchez Vicario and Jana Novotna face a
rematch of last year's final with top seeds -- and holders since 1992 --
America's Gigi Fernandez and Natasha Zvereva of Belarus.
The men's doubles final will see defending champions Mark Woodforde
and Todd Woodbridge facing unseeded Americans Rick Leach and Scott
Melville.
Britain's Martin Lee and James Trotman reached the last four of the
boy's doubles where they meet eighth-seeded Americans Justin Gimelstob
and Ryan Wolters.

RED Bishop offers better value than the two market leaders for the
Eclipse. He is a game performer who has landed top prizes in each of his
last three races on both sides of the globe against hot company. Sandown
is not foreign territory to him and he won over course and distance two
seasons ago.
Double Quick can add to his impressive tally of wins by landing the
Listed Race. He was only just caught on the line at Royal Ascot under
top weight and can score off his light weight today.
Better Offer could live up to his name at likely odds for the last
race.
Lombardic may be worth a gamble in Haydock's Old Newton Cup. He was
denied a clear run when disappointing in a similar race at Goodwood last
year and ran a much better race next time at York. Top weight Source Of
Light makes each way appeal.
The lightly raced Noble Rose is preferred to Totality in the
Lancashire Oaks. Luca Cumani's charge has improved consistently through
her five-year career and impressed when going down by less than a length
to Dalara at Longchamps last time.

MENTALASANYTHIN, who finished second in the opening race at Hamilton
Park last night, lived up to his name when he dumped his lady jockey in
the car park.
It was an unfortunate ending to her first ride on the Flat for
Hamilton Park chief executive Hazel Dudgeon, but although she suffered
cuts and bruises, she was not seriously injured.
Mentalasanythin (5-1 favourite) finished five lengths behind the
Newmarket horse, Gold Blade (3-1), who went for home two furlongs out
and was never troubled. Miss Dudgeon had difficulty in pulling him up at
the end of the race and came to grief in the car park. She was treated
in the ambulance room before resuming her normal duties on a busy
Ladies' Night.
Kevin Darley, who flew up from Sandown Park where he had an earlier
booking, won the Kay Cassells Claiming Stakes on 8-13 favourite Second
Colours, but the margin was almost too close for comfort.
Second Colours and Sir Arthur Hobbs (2-1) joined issue a furlong out
and were nip and tuck all the way to the line. Sir Arthur Hobbs had won
his last four starts over the course, but was just caught at the post.
Song of Years (6-4 fav), unlucky at Salisbury last week, was
confidently expected to trot up in the Linn Volvo Safety Limited Stakes,
but it was the Mark Johnston-trained Three Arch Bridge who came through
approaching two furlongs out and went on to take it by one and a half
lengths from My Handy Man.
Johnston and Jockey Tyrone Williams completed a near 19-1 double when
Profit Release (5-1) was successful in the Glengoyne Single Highland
Malt Whisky Handicap.
Diet, second in his last two starts, showed tremendous promise in the
early stages of this six furlong sprint, but was overtaken by the winner
two furlongs out and beaten by three lengths.
After a depressing sequence of 21 losers trainer Jack Berry returned
to the winner's enclosure when No Monkey Nuts provided an upset on his
first race, beating 11-2 on favourite Red Acuisle in the EBF Auction
Maiden Stakes.

IRISH OPEN
THE twin Scottish striking force of Sam Torrance and Colin Montgomerie
is poised just one shot behind the leader in the #650,000 Murphy's Irish
Open at Mount Juliet.
Both Scots shot 68 yesterday but could not quite catch the almost
unknown German Sven Struver, who has yet to win a tournament outside his
own country.
Torrance, 41, has a special place in his heart for this tournament.
His victory at Portmarnock in 1981 ''gave me the entry to my first Ryder
Cup''; this year he will almost certainly play in his eighth.
Sam was delighted with his second 68, having had three weeks off to
coincide with the birth of his third child, Anouska. ''It was really
great being at home that long for the first time in 24 years.''
He lit the fire under his round with a birdie at the third, hitting a
6 iron to eight feet and holing the putt. A delightful chip to a foot
set up another at the long fifth but a pushed drive at the seventh cost
him a shot.
Two monster putts from 20 and 25ft were the foundation of his second
half and he capped it with a birdie at the seventeenth, chipping out of
a bunker to 18 inches.
Torrance, sipping a pint of the sponsors' product, did not hesitate to
enter the debate about appearance money -- and to back up his pal
Montgomerie.
''It is basically bad for the game. Two years ago I was leading the
Order of Merit going into the Open.
''If I had led the money-list I would have been entitled to ask for
appearance money. I would not have done so then and would maintain that
position.
''The managers and the sponsors, not the players, are to blame -- they
are the money-grabbers. We are lucky to have a guy like Monty who is
prepared to speak out.''
Anything else, Sam? ''Yeah, the Ryder Cup should come to Ireland and
be staged somewhere like Portmarnock -- in fact it should have come here
before going to Spain.'' This boy knows how to please a home crowd.
Montgomerie put on his happy face as he too carded a second 68.
''I had a six at my opening hole (the tenth) which was not too clever.
After that I played really well and I am looking forward to the next two
days.''
His driver was his key club -- on two holes he used it twice and came
up with birdies both times.
Struver, frankly, was expected to fold like a seaside deck-chair after
his opening 65. Instead, the 27-year-old blond from Hamburg hung on
bravely, climaxing his round of 70 with a 10ft putt for a birdie at the
last.
''This is new territory for me,'' he admitted. ''When I sank a putt on
the fourteenth the crowd made souch a roar I was quite taken aback.''
Gary Orr is another Scot with ambition, having finished only three off
the pace. His 68 contained four birdies and no bogeys.
Sandy Lyle is one further back, not out of it by any means but
disappointed with his 71. A shanked wedge at the fifteenth, the second
time he has done that in two days, cost him dearly.
And what was happening for super-star Greg Norman, already guaranteed
a bigger purse than the winner of the title? Not a lot. He added a 71 to
his opening 70 and that didn't have them dancing in the aisles. Leading
scores (GB and Ireland unless stated):

YOU have to wonder about teenagers. You can retain an image of a
rave-obsessed, vacuous, nineties dead-head generation all you like, but
they'll just let you down time after time. I'm not the kind of guy that
is in any way impressed by teenage angst, but I do like a bit of spark,
a smidgeon of rebellion, which is why I was a bit disappointed at the
results of a recent poll on teen attitudes to their future career.
This survey, carried out on over 1000 teenagers, showed that when
given a choice only one-third of all boys aged between 15 and 18 felt
they wanted to be a top-class footballer. My own feeling is that any boy
who doesn't want to play premier division football should have his
testosterone called into question. But worse is to come.
Second favourite choice out of the line up, beating pop stars,
politicians, and actors, was Richard Branson! Nice guy maybe. Rich guy
certainly, but modern day ''yoof'' icon? What kind of society lies in
wait when the young would rather be a bearded hippy entrepreneur than a
sporting hero (Entrepreneur -- French, meaning ''chancer'')? Only 5% of
the sample wanted to be Hugh Grant, but knowing adolescent boys as I do
(well I used to be one), I suspect a damn sight more than 5% would have
chosen him if they'd known about his extra-curricular activities. The
girls were as bad, most wanting to be Anita Roddick -- the only make-up
girl ever to have made her fortune.
For some reason the survey expressed surprise that none of the females
had said they wanted to be housewives. No wonder. Being a housewife is a
phase, not a career. Kids at home + mortgage manageable on one wage =
housewife.
Many teenagers are keen on the idea of service to the community, with
11% of all kids saying that healthcare is their chosen field of work.
This contrasts with the desire expressed by one-third that they agreed
with the statement, ''I don't care what I do as long as it's well
paid.'' The nurses pay awards and the rash of doctors' scare stories
haven't scared off many youngsters.
These are terrible times for doctors -- or so we're told. For years
now the BMA's junior doctors' committee has hardly let a week go by
without putting out an appeal to the public about the terrible
conditions our junior doctors endure as part of their training.
In such an atmosphere, what must the 200 or so young medical graduates
be thinking as they file out into the Glasgow University Quads later
today, having taken their new, uncontroversial version of the
Hippocratic Oath (dental graduates have their own version: something to
do with keeping their handicap in single figures and not getting behind
with the private work)? Looking further than tonight's party, should
these new doctors be depressed or optimistic?
Graduations are like many of life's more significant events in that
they retain an air of achievement. In reality, they're all just false
ceilings: each exam passed means other, more difficult ones in prospect,
each promotion means more hassle, and each wedding means a lifetime of
marriage. Once the fuss dies down, the same problems remain, dressed in
more sophisticated clothes.
These graduands, who will at this moment be rushing around getting
ready, have managed to withstand the worst financial conditions ever
imposed on students since the days when full grant was a full ration of
porridge. Today, the woeful inadequacy of student grants is such that
most students emerge from their studies (dentists, doctors, and vets
more than anyone) in a level of debt that in ordinary circumstances
could only be attained by the Marquis of Blandford on a busy week.
The main irony is that a party supposedly in favour of meritocracy and
self-improvement has conspired to lay out the climate under which our
universities have become places where thick people can get an education
if they have enough money. This can't continue -- after all, that's what
private schools are for. While the aspirant middle classes, the soft
underbelly of Britain, are ideally placed to take advantage of the
vacant university places, the working classes are scared away from what
is, since the demise of boxing, their only means of escape. The upper
classes, of course, are still too inbred to make sense of anything other
than hunts, shoots, and ceilidhs.
Having braved five years of penury, what faces these medics over the
next 40 years? All this week we've heard scare stories telling us how
horrendous the typical doctor's life is. These have focused on
individuals driven to the brink of despair by the demands of medicine.
Having heard these stories so often, is it the fault of the job or the
people? If Tory policies continue to encourage the selection of
ambitious, over-achieving, middle-class kids, does that bode well for
the future?
At junior level, the ''bright kids'' of the past 10 years are now the
bedrock upon which the profession relies. Are the continual stirrings of
unrest in the junior ranks a result of this selection bias? Why, this
week we've been told how terrible life is for all junior doctors. Having
campaigned successfully for a 72-hour week, we're still hearing how
awful things are. I don't have anything against juniors bettering their
working conditions, but with the rest of the public I'm getting
increasingly wary of the emotional campaign further to reduce their
hours. Things have changed -- and not only for the better.
The problems caused by the ''Not My Problem'' generation are growing.
Doctors may be working fewer hours, but they're covering more patients,
and as soon as you remove the human element from doctor-patient contact,
patients stop being people and start being cases.
All doctors have to realise that constant whingeing will only produce
a public backlash sooner or later. Seventy-two hours may seem like a
long working week, but many other people work 72 hours in a week. If
it's pressure they don't like, these harassed doctors should go and
become a trainee manager for Marks and Spencer like other graduates.
The BMA should note that parents were also questioned in the Mori
poll. Only 40% of all adults believe their work-life has been in any way
''rewarding'' or ''interesting''. It's not only doctors that have
difficult and stressful lives. Other people feel pressured too; other
people become mentally ill; other people have marriages that break down;
and we all have to do jobs that are unrewarding. Doctors are unhappy?
Join the club.
Today my bra'-in-law Steve graduates as a fully-fledged dentist, and
it's one of those occasions where vicarious contentment spills over into
pride. Steven, for today, forget all that false ceiling crap, and have a
great day. You never know, I might even buy you a beer. The same goes
for anyone who has a graduation to celebrate. Er, except the beer bit.

PETE Sampras admitted it had been ''scary'' out on Centre Court
yesterday, but the defending champion should be aware of one thing as he
prepares to return tomorrow. Pete, boy, it could be a lot scarier yet.
The 23-year-old American is hoping to become the first player since
the Bjorn Borg era to win the men's singles championship three
successive times, but Boris Becker senses destiny is at play on his side
of the net, and intends to produce another mighty effort. It has not
been lost on him that this is the tenth anniversary of his first
Wimbledon triumph, and he has always believed a fourth championship
lurked within him.
He won in 1985, '86 and in '88, and tomorrow he will be appearing in
his seventh final here. ''No-one should underestimate Boris Becker at
Wimbledon,'' he said.
When it was pointed out to him that Sampras, who beat Goran
Ivanisevic, 7-6 (9-7), 4-6, 6-3, 4-6, 6-3 yesterday, said he remains not
only hungry for more, despite having twice been champion, but positively
''ravenous,'' Becker said: ''Then I guess we will have two very hungry
boys out there on Sunday.''
Becker's great strength is his refusal to be beaten, and it is this
quality which might prevent Sampras from enjoying what would be the
greatest moment in his career. ''To come back three times in a row and
win Wimbledon would be a dream,'' he said.
So widespread had been the expectation of a final between the No.1 and
No.2 seeds that Sampras actually had been discussing how he would have
to change his game to suit Agassi's baseline game in the final. But the
champ will have to think again. Becker is coming, and he looks mighty
powerful.
There were shades of the old ''Boom Boom'' as he beat Agassi in four
sets after having conceded the first set, and the manner in which he
closed out the top seed, refusing to let him gain any ground after a
poor start, suggested Sampras will have to produce his best tennis again
if he is to become only the seventh player to win three or more
consecutive titles.
He has to face the reality that Becker seems to be more alive on this
Wimbledon turf than anywhere else, and having won the singles crown, it
is of no relevance that Sampras won the only time the pair have stared
across a Wimbledon net. That was in the '93 semi-finals, and of the 11
matches they have played, only five have been won in straight sets.
Becker, after having stunned Agassi -- who had lost his strut and his
smile when he appeared at the post-match conference -- by winning 2-6,
7-6 (7-1), 6-4, 7-6 (7-1), said: ''I had never seen anyone hit the ball
the way Andre did in the first set and a half. I was just trying to hold
on and I was living in hope.
''Then, when I broke back after he had taken a 4-1 lead in the second
set, I could see that little light at the end of the tunnel and I lifted
my game to an incredible level.''
He did, too, and it would be foolish of anyone to believe all Sampras
-- who has been hitting the ball well -- has to do is turn up and claim
his own corner in Wimbledon folklore. He will be playing a legend, a
heroic figure around these parts.
''Always when I play here, I have hope. I can feel it when I come
here,'' the 27-year-old said, ''and I will always fight to the end. No
one will take anything from me without playing hard for it, and Pete
should know that. I don't intend going quietly.''
Before leaving the complex, Agassi, who experienced the bliss of
winning here in 1992 when he beat Goran Ivanisevic, said he felt Sampras
would edge the final because ''he can do everything Boris can do except
perhaps close out an opponent when he is in front.
''Boris does that very well. He just does not let up, and even when he
is behind, you always worry about him coming back. However, Pete moves a
little quicker and has maybe more power in his shots. If both play their
best stuff I'd have to fancy Pete.''
Agassi will not be watching the final because he will be off somewhere
with his actress girlfriend, Brooke Shields. ''I'm out of it now,
watching isn't for me,'' he explained.
Nevertheless, he was reduced to a spectator in the fourth-set
tie-break which was won 7-1 by the Lion of Leimen, who is on the prowl
again.
Sampras described his semi-final as having been like a ''scary
roller-coaster ride,'' and added: ''Sometimes you need luck to win and
maybe the breaks did go my way yesterday, but I'm feeling good about the
final now.''
However, the most confident looking man in Centre Court last night was
Nick Bolletieri, who has been coaching Becker since February of last
year. Bolletieri used to be Sampras's coach and before leaving last
night he said: ''Let's just say there are one or two things Boris will
be working on before he comes back on Sunday.''

Girls' championship
LAURA Moffat won the Scottish Girls' championship yesterday at
Paisley, where she defeated Fiona Lockhart by 2 and 1 in the final.
All-square after 11 holes, Moffat lost the next to a par, but won the
thirteenth and fourteenth to move one ahead, and then birdied the
sixteenth to secure the silverware.
Next on the agenda for the 15-year-old East Kilbride golfer is the
Scottish Under-21 championship at Lanark and then the British Girls' in
Wales next month, but the current Scottish Schools champion has already
planned events even further ahead.
''When I finish school I would like to go to university in the States
on a golfing scholarship,'' she explained, ''That seems to be the way to
go now.''

IT was impossible to sit in the cool splendour of Edinburgh's new
sheriff court building without worrying about the law of supply and
demand. The floors of shiny Columbian marble, the warm yellow stone
walls a washable deterrent to the felt-pen artistry of the Wee Gillie
Terrors: the clever architecture that would almost make you believe this
was an Italian Palazzo instead of a swish Palace of Justice -- except
that the security guards bore the legend Rentokil on their smartly
uniformed shoulders.
There was an air of unreality about this week's formal opening by the
Queen, met as she was by a formidable array of hats and wigged sheriffs.
Something was missing. Of course! No customers. The demand was there, in
the form of lawyers, judges, clerks, and splendid courtrooms. The
supply, the fodder for the industry, had been banished for the day.
Think about it: thanks to crime, we now have the most massive and
splendid punishment industry on Earth. This splendid new court building,
shiny new privatised prisons, the promise of harsh new sentences to fill
them up. We have a larger proportion of our population locked up than
any other nation in Europe, so the only worry is: what if we run out of
crime?
If punishment actually worked, a crime shortage would develop in no
time at all. Would-be criminals would study the available sentences, do
careful cost-benefit analyses, and conclude that stealing mountain
bikes, say, or bank robbery just wasn't worth the candle.
If deterrence worked, as our political leaders seem to think, we would
soon have a vast over-supply of unattractive, heavily-wired buildings to
swell the surplus on the property market. The new sheriff court would,
with few adjustments, have to be turned into a shopping arcade.
If crime frightens you, try to imagine a world without it. It would be
unthinkable: nothing on TV except soaps and quiz shows. No Cracker, no
more Bill, no O J Simpson trial. Because, let's be honest about this,
crime is one of our favourite entertainment spectacles.
Think how many happy hours the average family spends watching NYPD
Blue, or Hamish Macbeth. This is nothing to be ashamed of. Historically,
people have long demanded the pleasure of seeing others punished and
usually in live non-fiction form. Executions were public entertainment.
Historically speaking, the problem has not been to stop crime but to
keep the local punishment industry supplied with victims.
When the Romans ran out of criminals to feed to the lions, they
scoured the world for edible prisoners of war. Civilisation has moved on
since then, of course. Now traffic wardens scour the country for
unsuspecting shoppers who've just stopped for a minute to pick up a
parcel while we spectate, enthralled, as the clampers arrive to carry
their cars off to the compound.
Of course, modern ethical sensibilities restrict us to victims who are
genuine criminals as certified by a court of law. Except in the case of
Daily Mail leader writers. They argued that it was unfair for a man, who
looked quite good in a beret, to be tried under Northern Irish law, with
no jury system, just because he shot a female joyrider. They insisted he
was entitled to the much fairer British system of having his sentence
decided by readers who were invited to use coupons to secure his
release.
One line of criminological reasoning holds that there's nothing wrong
with our present approach to maintaining the crime supply. Just take
one-quarter of the child population, raise them in poverty, and subject
them to commercials, night and day, advising that life without #100
footwear is not worth living. Presto -- little muggers are born, and in
numbers sufficient to stock the punishment industry for years to come.
Of course Conservative criminologists naturally question this.
Deprivation and temptation are not enough, they insist. A good supply of
crime requires technology and global markets too.
But a growing number of experts assure us there's nothing to worry
about.  No matter how fiercely Draconionan it becomes, the punishment
industry will never diminish the supply of crime. On the contrary, there
is evidence that a few years in prison seasons criminals and makes them
more productive. So as long as we do nothing to disturb the synergy of
poverty and temptation, the supply of crime should never fall below the
widespread demand for punishment.

What do you mean, no clubbing in Aberdeen? THOM DIBDIN hits some
venues and discovers the nearest thing to heaven on earth.
YOU'LL find no clubbing in Aberdeen. That's what my pals who spent
their university lives in the city said. Colleagues who have moved down
from the local papers said it. Even the receptionist at the hotel said
it, adding dismissively, ''not unless you want to rave, that is''.
But I don't want the hardcore beats of rave. Not this weekend. All I
want is a club where folk stay up late to dance to house music in any of
its myriad forms. Normal folk mind, not wild-eyed outcasts. People who
shop in the High Street and browse through charity shops, who worry
about dandruff and talk about football, who buy chart music but don't
buy the office disco outing.
Clubs playing modern dance music. Clubs where the DJ blends one track
seamlessly into the next rather than plonking the records down on the
mat. Music of a kind where the beat and dancing go on, and on, and on.
If not all night, then at least until the early hours.
So, on this Saturday night I leave the crowded pubs off Union Street
and make for the waterfront and Joy. It is a well-appointed little club
holding 300 or so. Saturday nights go under the apposite name of
Celebrate Life when the speciality is the mellow groove known as garage
which grew from soul music.
The door staff are polite but firm. Their body search reasonably
thorough: they look through all my pockets for drugs or weapons but fail
to spot my bum bag. Upstairs, the room is just beginning to fill so I
grab a pint and join five lads up from Arbroath for the evening.
DJ Austyn Davidson is just beginning to warm up the early crowd,
laying down one pure soul vocal song after another. Slowly he begins to
harden up the beat into the strict four-four tempo that is dancefloor
happiness. Davidson clearly likes his garage in the New York styles: the
rhythms dancing round the kick-drum's four-four monotone are crisp and
clean as a freshly laundered sheet.
Among the Arbroath posse, he is believed to be an ace DJ, although he
admits only to dabbling in the art. But he certainly likes his soul:
he's up on the dancefloor while most of the punters are still hugging
the edges of the small space. Out in the middle he studiedly grooves
away to the beats.
This is no rave zone. The beats are too mellow, the people too cool,
although their styles are hardly at the cutting edge of sartorial
elegance. Guys in well-chosen check shirts and jeans, girls in
off-the-peg High street designs. But I fancy something with a bit more
bounce, so I make my excuses and leave.
At the seedier end of Waterloo quay, Skank is said to be Mrs Wood's
(of Teaches Techno fame) favourite club outside London, and has a
reputation for playing the hardest house in Aberdeen. A reputation it
almost loses as I walk up the road and hear the jangling commercial
noise of the Rednex Cotton Eye Joe.
No worries on that front, however, as the noise is leaking from a
nearby pub. Another search, effective this time, and I'm soon weaving my
way through the crowded dancefloor. This is an altogether friendlier
crowd. People who trust each other well enough to leave their coats on
the pegs behind the door. Instant friends with big grins which leap out
to you as you dance by.
Allan Strath is on the decks, mixing up the hard house. Although he is
not the world's most innovative DJ -- he allows each song to run its
length before mixing it into the next -- he has a delicious sense of
musical irony. Deuce's Call It Love blends into tunes by bands such as
Leftfield who have made the charts. But in mixes you won't be hearing on
Top of the Pops. Dub mixes with the vocal stripped out and the rhythm
beefed up.
The receptionist would probably call it rave, but not Eileen, a
21-year-old student. ''There's no rave or hardcore in Aberdeen,'' she
complained as we swopped stories of Rezerection before she jumped on the
bus back into the centre of town, another excellent night of
sweat-inducing dance behind her.
Cream has become a Liverpudlian institution. Two thousand people visit
the club every Saturday night. It's also part of a major new sector of
the leisure business which has seen house clubs mushroom in almost every
town in the country and normalised club culture within society.
And now Cream's Sold Out tour has reached Aberdeen. It's Sunday night
at the Ministry of Sin -- a converted church with biblical frescoes
featuring voluptuous nudes -- and Cream is ringing the changes from the
mid-week disco.
The Ministry bouncers conform to the club stereotype: arrogant, slow,
and inefficient. But although the club is packed, Cream has not brought
the legendary queue which in Liverpool winds round two blocks from 9pm.
What is has brought is a couple of the resident DJs and one Jeremy
Healy.
As soon as I enter the dance arena I realise what was missing from the
previous night: bass. Ministry boasts a 12K sound system and the
dancers, dressed to both sweat and impress, can feel the difference as
the four-to-the-floor beat shudders through their bodies.
As Healy takes the decks at 2am, I understand why the readers of the
clubbing magazine, Mixmag, voted him DJ of the year for 1994. His joyous
blend of happy, up-tempo house makes the previous night's efforts, good
as they were, seem positively pedestrian.
Healy melts one record into the next, carefully lining up the right
place on the track and synchronising the beats before fading across to a
vocal stab, or a fresh new rhythm. The only way you can tell the join is
to watch his hands. Sometimes he fuses two records together for 10
minutes, juggling snatches of the one over the other or running the two
together.
All the while he is toying with the crowd. From the DJ box, just above
the dancefloor, he lays down a massive, percussive dub, before mixing in
a tune so uplifting that everyone in the whole room involuntarily raises
their hands in the air and screams in exultation. Grinning, he turns to
the dancefloor, punches the air in time to the beat, grabs a swig of
lager then swings round to pick another record from his box. A new
surprise to delight the crowd.
He does this for two hours. Two hours of bliss. A journey through the
lands of house. Outside it is snowing, but on the dancefloor of this
redundant church we are in the nearest place you can get to heaven on
earth. What do you mean, no clubbing in Aberdeen?* Jeremy Healy returns
to Scotland this weekend, playing out at Triumph (The Tunnel, Mitchell
Street, Glasgow) tonight and Freedom (The Palace, Bridge Place,
Edinburgh) tomorrow.

Alexander Linklater looks at the basis for Zero Tolerance and
concludes that the campaign does a disservice to real feminist
achievements
WHEN she published her classic study, The Second Sex, in 1949, Simone
de Beauvoir posed the question: ''Are there women, really?'' Now, in the
nineties, we might flippantly answer, ''Well, are there men -- really?''
But back then the terms of debate were harder to play about with.
Questioning the treatment of women in society meant tackling the
implicit notion that maleness was a norm, the neutral standard against
which women became an object, something different; an unstable and
seductive ''other''.
Simone de Beauvoir challenged the idea that men and women were
essentially different by exposing the ways in which society denied them
not just equality, but similarity: ''In the midst of an abstract
discussion it is vexing to hear a man say: 'You think thus because you
are a woman'; but I know that my only defence is to reply: 'I think thus
because it is true', thereby removing my subjective self from the
argument. It would be out of the question to reply: 'And you think the
contrary because you are a man', for it is understood that the fact of
being a man is no peculiarity.''
The major achievements of post-war feminism include not just what it
has done for women, but what it has done for men. In gradually shunting
them out from that constricting, neutral centre, it has given them the
opportunity to see themselves in new ways. The capacity to experiment
with and change sexual, domestic, and political behaviour is a freedom
only made possible when you realise that your gender is not a fixed
quantity. To be male is to have a peculiarity which, since it is created
by social attitudes, can also be altered by them.
Or is this just in theory? Is there something about being equipped
with testicles which predisposes half the population to adhere to a
patriarchal culture, while the ovaries of the other half condemn them to
suffer from it? In the history of feminism as I have experienced it,
nothing has forced the gender distinction so powerfully as the
Edinburgh-based Zero Tolerance campaign. Built on the evidence of some
five different surveys into the predominance of male violence, it came
up with the slogans which we began to see after 1992: ''Whoever,
wherever, whenever; emotional, physical, sexual; husband, father,
stranger: male abuse of power is a crime. There is never an excuse. NO
MAN HAS THE RIGHT.''
While this was primarily addressing the urgent need to tackle hidden
problems of domestic violence and sexual abuse on a practical level, it
also contained a definite message about what it means to be a man. ''The
inequalities in society which benefit men at the expense of women are
the root cause of the violence perpetrated by some men against women and
children,'' wrote Women's Aid officer Lesley Irving in a piece about
Zero Tolerance for The Herald last year.
What is odd about this kind of thinking is that, although it seems to
use the familiar idea that society creates unjust attitudes, it assumes
nothing has changed. It says the problems of inequity are
culture-created, yet, in its uncompromising view of masculinity, ends up
by reintroducing the conservative notion that men and women are
fundamentally different. Irving's point was unequivocal: ''The man is
always to blame.''
The Zero Tolerance campaign is rooted in a comprehensive feminist
perspective in which male abuse of power is seen to be ubiquitous. The
message of the advertisements joins with this wider view in its
definition of what constitutes sexual abuse.
Mental cruelty, threats, and flashing, it claims, form part of a gamut
of violence which runs from minor acts of chauvinism all the way through
to physical assault and rape. Susan Hart and Evelyn Gillan, two of the
chief creative minds behind Zero Tolerance, speak of a ''continuum of
violence'' which begins with boys in the playground and connects all
forms of male aggression.
Hart's concern is that a limited view of men's behaviour handicaps
women: ''Rapists begin with the kind of low-level abuse which is not
taken seriously. So where do we start taking it seriously? What we're
trying to do is make the links. Otherwise people will continue only to
condemn the extreme end. The campaign is not just aimed at sufferers of
violence; it's aimed at the majority.''
And Evelyn Gillan points out that the only way to make progress is to
deal with the problem at source and recruit male opinion: ''We know it
is men who are predominantly the perpetrators. We want them to turn
around and say 'I will not endorse this'.''
In other words, men must unite in the knowledge that it is their sex
which is the source of guilt. For men to condemn sexual abuse they must
accept that they are abusers as a group. There is an extremely
uncomfortable paradox here. The nature argument becomes the same as the
nurture one. It says: to make things different men must accept that they
are basically the same.
It argues the contradiction that to change you must realise that
things don't change. It is the same monolithic attitude that Simone de
Beauvoir was fighting against in the forties, except that here it is
being perpetrated from a feminist camp. It says yes, there really are
women. And, yes, there really are men.
Now that Zero Tolerance has brought out a new cinema advert, we should
ask ourselves if this is really true. Is it right to say that all men
partake of the sins of their gender? Or, rather, is this view of men the
most effective way of understanding violence in society? Most people
would be hard-pressed to locate a consensus on the question. Nowhere is
the political more personal than it is with gender debates, and the
arguments rage with bewildering diversity and intensity.
Neil Lyndon (the feminists' whore of Babylon) wrote a feature for the
Sunday Times in January condemning domestic violence statistics as
grossly exaggerated. In the Guardian recently, Suzanne Moore derided the
NSPCC campaign on domestic violence for taking its definition of abuse
too far (to include shouting at and criticising children). And in March
Germaine Greer raised her customary level of controversy by playing down
the importance of rape with the comment that, ''To insist that outrage
by penis is worse than outrage by any other means is to glorify and
magnify that tag of flesh beyond reason.''
However, there has been no place for complexity in the message of Zero
Tolerance. The symbolism of that capital ''Z'' is absolute. And it has
been backed up by figures which, as is the way with polemically
motivated statistics, seems to leave no room for doubt: One in four
children is sexually abused. One-third of all women experience domestic
violence in their lifetime. Two in every five women have been raped or
sexually assaulted. Seventy per cent of all women have experienced
sexual harassment. One in two girls will experience some form of sexual
abuse before their 18th birthday.
Set in black and white, with all the force of irrefutable facts, these
percentages should scare the living hell out of everyone. So we need to
know where they come from, and how certifiable they are, and what they
mean in the context of wider debates about the violent society. If they
are speculative, that must be allowed into discussion of the subject. If
there is disagreement about what defines the nature of abuse,
particularly if it comes from women, this needs to be considered.
Of the three main sources of information used by Zero Tolerance, one
in particular is worrying. A 1990 survey organised by Glasgow Women's
Support Project and the Evening Times produced the figure that 70% of
all women have been sexually harassed.
But the women who responded did so voluntarily after reading the
published questionnaire. It is hard to imagine that a representative
proportion of women would bother to fill in answers reporting the fact
that they had consistently not been abused. And those who did respond
were given the opportunity to class themselves as victims if they had
experienced only rude comments or suggestions made by men.
The methodology of the other two surveys is more reliable, but even
here the situation is not as clear cut as Zero Tolerance would have it.
One is a 1993 report put together by the Centre for Criminology at
Middlesex University. Here a good part of the survey was geared to
extending the definition of abuse.
It showed that 80% of the 571 women contacted in north London agreed
that domestic violence includes mental cruelty and verbal abuse. If, as
they and Zero Tolerance propose, you agree that dealing with domestic
violence means encompassing the whole continuum of aggressive behaviour,
then you can agree that one-third of all women are victims of it. You
can then associate it with the instituted violence of a male-dominated
society. And in this way masculinity equates with abuse.
However, both the Middlesex survey and a 1991 survey prepared by the
Polytechnic of North London tackle the difficult problem of ''hidden
figures''. They are entering a new and uncertain field in which
Metropolitan Police estimates -- even limited and debatable ones -- were
not routinely kept until 1993. Both surveys make the point that their
figures are provisional and not definite. But the Zero Tolerance
campaign translated this into complete certainty.
Of course, the absolute accuracy of numbers isn't the point. Evelyn
Gillan argues that after the posters came down ''people didn't remember
the statistics; they remembered that there was a very serious problem''.
And there can be little doubt that those groups attempting to tackle
sexual and domestic abuse of women are dealing with a large and real
problem and must be supported.
The question, rather, is whether Zero Tolerance has been giving
women's groups the right PR by portraying men as a unified and violent
group. It may be pedantic, even unhelpful, to point out that their
original figures were provisional and not factual. But much more
importantly, what those figures actually come to mean is also
provisional. All that the statistics can properly tell us is that where
abuse does take place it is predominantly carried out by men. To make a
general conclusion about maleness from this point of view is not just
impossible to substantiate but it is also antiquated in a way which does
real disservice to real feminist achievements.
It should be obvious that just as society contains a multitude of
different ethnic, political, and class groupings, so it contains a great
variety of sexual viewpoints and forms of behaviour. But there is a
further, vital point to be made, and it is one that a no-tolerance
outlook will find difficult to absorb, because Zero-style feminism is as
entrenched as it is outmoded. This is the generational one.
It must be remembered that everyone born from the mid-sixties onwards
has been brought up in a climate in which popular dissent against old
preconceptions about marriage, sexuality, and gender has been constant.
For those of us aged between 18 and 30 the assumption about sex is that
there are no fixed and universal assumptions to be had.
If this seems like it might be confusing, it reflects the wider
confusion surrounding the whole idea of defining that age group.
''Generation X'' was the term that Douglas Coupland came up with in the
early nineties. But no sooner was this idea fashionable than it became
the object of mockery. Coupland renounced the term, Richard Linklater
(director of Slacker, the film which supposedly dramatised the
lifestyle) declared it irrelevant, and commentators generally decided
that the only thing which defined twentysomethings was that they didn't
want to be defined. And that certainly includes the kind of sexual
definition which Zero Tolerance has purveyed.
This generation, whatever you call it, has not known the world before
popular feminism, and if it really is no different from previous
generations everyone might as well give up.
If surveys can (as Zero Tolerance believes they can) tell us something
useful, a recent one could perhaps suggest to the people who want to do
something about sexual abuse what kind of general atmosphere they may be
working in. One which was done last year by the Caledonian University
using over 1000 undergraduates found that: ''While 63% of female and 39%
of male students supported the aims and principles of feminism, the
women in particular were keen to qualify their views with the proviso
that they would not want the pursuit of equality to be done in an
extreme manner.''
Helen Wilkinson, co-organiser of the survey, has written that these
kinds of attitudes pose ''a dilemma for many organisations, because
historically they have been based on a separate agenda, setting women's
needs against men's''. It's only a survey, of course, based on a limited
selection, with a certain agenda in mind. But in the same kind of black
and white used by the Zero Tolerance statistics it says that younger
people ''do not identify with feminism'' and they see the present-day
style of the women's movement ''as extreme, man-hating and separatist''.
It is interesting to watch the new Zero Tolerance cinema advert
because, to begin with, it seems to be concise and hard hitting without
involving the old sweeping and regressive claims about men. It works
because it portrays particular cases: a girl who has been molested and a
woman who has suffered in a relationship with a habitual rapist.
The last scene comes up with the cliche that it's all about power and
not sex, but it still seems effective without being hysterical. But then
the ''Z'' logo gets flashed at the audience and we remember what beliefs
lie behind it. As Susan Hart says of this: ''It can now be slightly more
obtuse because people know what Zero Tolerance is about. They know it's
about male violence against women.''
If the beliefs are still the same then for me and, I suspect, for a
good proportion of my generation, the Zero Tolerance flagship acts as
semantic piracy. It represents an abuse of language. I don't for an
instant doubt that the organisation is trying to support the essential
groundwork being done by women's groups all over the country. But the
type of feminism it harbours will ultimately help no-one.
Trying to think of why I found the style of those first billboards so
distasteful, I realised that it was in fact because I associated them
with the worst kind of institutionalised male attitudes.
What is the aim of feminism if not to try to cure injustice? It has to
be concerned with sexual communion as well as gender inequalities or it
is useless. To talk, for instance, about erotic experience is a meeting
point for people of all sexual persuasions and requires a flexible and
responsive language. But how can we talk about sexual passions if we
cannot tolerate the danger of its language, if we fill the bedroom with
zeroes?
The interplay of domination and submission is a prime element of
sexuality, and we need to know how to talk about it precisely so that we
do not damage each other. Everyone experiences sexual pain and it tells
us nothing merely to call this the result of abuse.
I don't, of course, suggest we make abuse acceptable or stop fighting
it. But by calling it universally male, or by saying it covers all forms
of power, is going to limit us and repress us. We are all either women
or men, but of many different kinds. None of these is definitely Woman,
or essentially Man.
I do not believe violence and evil can be called either male or
female, although many religious and political groups have done so.
Rather I believe in the conclusion that Simone de Beauvoir gave her book
during the truly difficult forties: ''To gain the supreme victory it is
necessary, for one thing, that by and through their natural
differentiation men and women unequivocally affirm their brotherhood.''

RANGERS will complete the signing of Paul Gascoigne at Ibrox on
Monday, underlining their commitment to high spending in the transfer
market.
And indications from Barcelona last night were that the Ibrox outlay
will be pushed even higher next week when Romanian World Cup striker
Florin Raducioiou will join Gascoigne.
There has been doubt over the Romanian's move, but from Spain
yesterday the news for Rangers was positive. A club source at Espanol
said last night: ''The club are now resigned to the fact that the player
is leaving. He has said that his time with them is over and he has also
told some of the players that he will not be here next season.
''He has spoken to his agent and this is the outcome. He is on
holiday, but no one in Barcelona expects to see him back here. The club
need the money from the transfer and Raducioiou seems to have sorted out
his own contract problems. He says he is finished with Espanol and that
means he will be with Rangers next season in the Champions' Cup.''
Ibrox manager Walter Smith was optimistic yesterday about the deal and
the fresh word from Spain will bolster that optimism. The Romanian has
been a prime target for Rangers during the summer and constant delays
have caused them concern. If you add the Gascoigne deal, #4.3m, Stephen
Wright, which may be around #1.5m and now the Romanian front man, the
close season spending at Ibrox will be close to #8m with another player
set to come in.
But while Manager Smith looks towards one more big money buy before
the next campaign kicks off, yesterday he was more concerned with the
fitness of the players he has available to him.
''This is the best we have been in the last three years as far as the
fitness of the players is concerned,'' he stressed.''I have to go back
that far before I can remember when we had a squad of players without a
serious fitness problem.
During the past season, Ally McCoist, Andy Goram, Stuart McCall, Mark
Hateley and David Robertson all faced serious surgery. Now these players
are fit again and Smith recognises what that means to the Ibrox club.
Indeed, the last time they were in this position before a competitive
ball was kicked, the Scottish champions defeated Leeds United and then
went on to the Champions' League. Smith must hope there is an omen
there.

ENGLISH singer Tina May's entrancing vocals cut through the humidity
of the City Cafe Bar like a cool breeze on Thursday night. Although her
opener, Well You Needn't, threatened a propensity to scat like a certain
Miss Laine, May quickly -- and thankfully -- proved herself to be no
Cleo clone. Rather, her style seemed to owe more to the influence of
Betty Carter, Anita O'Day and Carmen McRae.
In a non-stop, two-hour set, May barely paused between tunes; hitting
her stride, and really beginning to impress, as early as the second
number -- Miles Davis's All Blues, a perfect vehicle for her breathy,
intimate vocals.
By Ugly Beauty, the voice was positively smouldering -- sultry and
soulful. Ditto for the deeply romantic What's New, the enjoyment of
which was more than slightly marred by the cacophony of conversation
filtering through from the bar -- a racket to which jazz festival staff
seemed entirely indifferent.
May's classy trio also had their chances to shine. Her duet of T'Ain't
Necessarily So with bassist Wayne Batchelor was a definite highlight:
simple, elegant and downright funky.
David Newton's pianistics were consistently complementary and often
dazzling, especially on the Steve Swallow-Norma Winstone bossa nova
number Ladies in Mercedes. Combined with the capable drumming of Clark
Tracey (Mr Tina May), this was a helluva rhythm section, and one which
sounded as if it could have played all night.
Sadly, however, it didn't. And Tina May bowed out with a stunning
version of Peggy Lee's most famous number. Black Coffee was an instant
winner: mean and moody, but mostly magnificent. Second helpings please.

ROB ADAMS looks at a jazz player who loves to disguise the
well-known tunes
JACKY Terrasson is talking about standards, the tunes that form jazz's
lingua franca and have been played by generations of jazz musicians.
''There's really no point in covering them if you're not going to make
them sound fresh or new,'' he says. This Berlin-born pianist of French
and black-American stock is as good as his word. The versions of Bye Bye
Blackbird, My Funny Valentine, and I Love Paris which graced his
eponymous Blue Note debut, released earlier this year, were nothing if
not fresh.
He gets a kick out of mischievously disguising those tunes, he says,
''while staying true enough to the original so people can still
recognise what I'm playing''. Eventually.
Terrasson grew up in Paris and began studying classical piano aged
five. At 15 he went on to Paris's Lycee Lamartine. By this time he was
also studying jazz with Jeff Gardener, an American living in Paris. ''As
soon as I heard jazz, I felt closer to it than classical music,'' he
says.
After leaving Lamartine he studied improvisation and arranging at
Boston's Berklee School of Music. A classmate invited him to Chicago
where they played in a club five nights a week and learned ''three times
faster than in class''.
An obligation to the French army took Terrasson home and he didn't
touch the piano for a whole year. Later he worked with bassist Ray
Brown, saxophonists Guy Lafite and Barney Wilen and singer Dee Dee
Bridgewater in three busy years, before moving to New York in 1990.
Then, in 1993, Terrasson won the prestigious Thelonious Monk
Competition and teamed up with bassist Ugonna Okegwo and drummer Leon
Parker. They are now working on their second album together, which will
feature more of Terrasson's own compositions as well as some standards
including Smoke Gets In Your Eyes.
On previous form, if they play that at McEwan's Old Fruitmarket on
Sunday, the noise at the end won't just be applause -- it'll be a buzz
of recognition among the audience.

Team Championship
SCOTLAND produced a Houdini-like escape at sun-drenched Royal Antwerp
yesterday to overhaul defending champions Wales 4-3 and progress to the
semi-finals of the European Amateur Team championship.
After sharing the morning foursomes 1-1, the Scots looked in deep
trouble as the singles contests reached their conclusions with only
Graham Rankin and Gordon Sherry ahead.
It needed one of the other three players to turn their ties around --
and Stephen Gallacher answered the call by winning the last two holes
against the luckless Garry Houston. Gallacher picked up the seventeenth
with a birdie 3, and a par 4 at the 396-yard last was enough after
Houston carved his approach into the trees.
With Graham Rankin having notched a superb 3 and 2 victory over Walker
Cup player Bradley Dredge, and Hugh McKibbin and Barclay Howard having
narrowly lost, the onus of gaining the final point fell on Amateur
champion Gordon Sherry -- and the big Ayrshireman did his country proud.
One up coming down the last, Sherry's No.8-iron shot found the heart
of the green and when David Park missed his birdie putt, Sherry rolled
his ball to the hole-side to secure the winning point.
The Scots now face France in today's semi-final after their surprise
win over Ireland. In the other semi, England play Sweden. Results:
FIRST FLIGHT
Scotland 4, 3 Wales. Details: Foursomes (Scottish players first) -- G
Sherry and S Gallacher beat G Houston and C Evans, 2 and 1; B Howard and
G Rankin lost to B Dredge and D Park, 4 and 3. Singles -- H McKibbin
lost to Evans, 2 and 1; Gallacher beat Houston, 1 hole; Howard lost to Y
Taylor, 1 hole; Rankin beat Dredge, 3 and 2; Sherry beat Park, 1 hole.
England 5, Belgium; Ireland 3, France 4; Sweden 6, Norway 1.
Second flight -- Denmark 3, Switzerland 2; Spain 4, Finland 1;
Netherlands 3, Germany 2; Italy 3, Austria 2. Third flight -- Portugal
5, Estonia 0; Iceland 3, Czech Republic 2.

A NEW weapon in the non-chemical armoury to combat crop pests was
announced by the Horticultural Research Institute in London yesterday.
Scientists at the institute have discovered that a wild relative of
cultivated brassicas, such as cabbage, cauliflower and rape, is highly
resistant to one of the industry's most damaging pests, the cabbage
aphid.
Current chemical treatments cost field vegetable growers up to #1m a
year but researchers led by doctors Bob Ellis and Rosemary Cole are
confident the natural resistance factor can be bred into cultivated
varieties.
They have identified the key element, a protein called lectin which
binds up the aphid's mouth parts and prevents it feeding, and they have
also succeeded in crossbreeding the wild variety with improved cabbage
plants. These are due to go into trials as part of a five-year, #150,000
programme.
''The protein simply gums up the works,'' said Dr Ellis at the launch
of the HRI annual report. ''The aphids attempt to feed but then they
could remove their proboscis from the plant and find somewhere else to
feed or they die of starvation.''
Development of this technique of pest control is seen as a key to
reducing costly inputs, improving product quality and safeguarding the
environment.
Other scientists at the institute are clarifying the role played by
hormones in stimulating rooting, growth and maturation of horticultural
crops. This, they say, will provide the building blocks for plant
breeders and geneticists to develop new designer varieties and
ultimately manipulate shelf life in supermarkets.
''Hormones are involved in all plant processes,'' said Dr Richard
Napier, who is in charge of the project. ''If we can understand how
plants receive these hormones then we have the potential to control many
aspects of their development.
''For example, flavour and colour development in ripening fruit might
be separated from softening, making a product easier to pick and
transport without damage.''
Cereals boost
THE final assessment of the 1994 UK cereals harvest is 19.9 million
tonnes, 200,000 tonnes higher than the estimate made in February.
Wheat production is put at 13.3 million tonnes, barley 5.9 million
tonnes and oats and other cereals at 686,000 tonnes.

* NAPOLI, who were helped to their first Italian League title by Diego
Maradona, need to find #16m in the next two weeks to stay alive,
according to their major shareholder.
Building magnate Corrado Ferlaino, the club's former president, was at
Napoli during the 1987-88 season when Argentinian Maradona helped them
win the Italian League title for the first time. The club went on to win
Serie A again in 1990 as well as the UEFA Cup in 1989.
But they fell on hard times after Maradona left and have recently
suffered moves to put them into liquidation. They could be expelled from
Serie A if they fail to balance their books by the July 20 registration
deadline.

IN a two-hour Radio 2 arts slot, Angela Rippon presented To Be The
Best which explored the acting profession. I must admit to being a
little resistant to her interviewing manner. Maybe it's because she used
to read the news and hasn't switched styles. When she overstresses key
words in a question, the impression is one of a Sloane Ranger primary
teacher talking to an idiot.
The questions at times tended to brink on the banal but it really
didn't matter as much as it might have because to given Rippon credit
the choice of interviewees was wide-ranging and intelligent.
Actors love talking about themselves and their work as anyone who has
sat in a greenroom can vouch for. I loathe the word ''luvvy'' I find it
cringingly failed-trendy and patronising, partly perhaps because I am
one.
Peter Barkworth was eloquent and detailed. As for a writer, memory is
the actor's fuel and his description of his first performance aged five
was funny and telling. A child's feeling of being lit in front of a dark
sea of strangers, of being applauded after the scary but exhilarating
performance of finding it so exciting that the decision of a lifetime is
made, was fascinating.
You have to be slightly mad to plump for this profession, 1400 young
hopefuls applied for Rada this year -- 30 were chosen. The odds stacked
against fame or even employment are huge -- only one quarter of 43,000
Equity members are in work at one time and two-thirds of the membership
earn less than #3000 a year. Parental warnings and common sense are
knocked back: it is a kind of lust against reason.
Margarita Scott, aged 83, talks with the same passion with which
Barkworth remembered his young self feeling. She recalled played
Desdemona live on television and having to improvise when her Othello
fainted at her feet. The show must go on and for most the determination
never wavers.
Others found that fame coming too early as a child actor brought
little grown-up reward. John Howard Davis, now a successful producer,
was the pretty-faced star of David Lean's Oliver. Being given the
freemanship of Dunfermline when you're a wean made him feel a bit daft
and after National Service he was rejected by the central school of
drama because his child-star fame they deemed had ''tainted'' him. A
crazy business indeed.
Anita Dobson, charming and honest, described her growing uneasiness
with the shape of her life: in her early thirties she looked to the
future and imagined a life of jobbing work and tours and seedy digs and
wondered if she should not change direction before it was too late and
other options narrowed.
Then came EastEnders. That injustice of the arbitrary called luck was
discussed again and again. Michael McLiammor was quoted as saying the
psychological damage can be immense: a diminishing of the soul lost in
bitterness and jealousy. And of course we all adapt upwards. The dole
neurosis switches to the being-recognised neurosis. As Simon Callow
astutely recognised in his writing about the profession, it is not
enough to have talent, one has to have the talent to have talent.
Radio fame is different from being recognised as Angie from EastEnders
in the supermarket. Involving only one week's work a month and not being
typecast by your looks has advantages, although there has been a change.
The publicity machine has strengthened the profile of actors in radio
soaps to such an extent that now people are being cast for radio parts
according to how they look.
In The Girl Can't Help It (Radio 4) Sue Nelson explored what the
scientists make of gender differences. It was refreshing that the
nature-versus-nurture debate was set aside with a sophisticated analysis
of how the brain structure itself is influenced by environment. The
cultural amplification of slight genetical differences were not
forgotten. An excellent educative programme.

John Byrne's fifties carpet factory comedy might be many things, but
it's not really a play. By which I mean it makes no attempt to do the
things that drama does best. There's no character development, for
example, and those few plot events that do take place -- Hector gets
promoted, McCann gets the sack -- in no way serve to elucidate any theme
or to demonstrate any thesis.
We learn nothing about ourselves, about humanity, about anything more
than what life might have been like in a slab room in Paisley during the
winter of 1957. When we return after the interval, it is with no sense
of uncompleted business, no sense of action unresolved, no real clue
about what needs to happen in Act Two.
The great skill of John Byrne is to have constructed such an effective
linguistic camouflage that, apart from the odd longueur in the second
half, you don't notice that his play has nothing of substance to say.
It's successful because it is funny, and it is funny because Byrne has a
wicked ear for abrasive west coast patter.

WHILE double Olympic gold medallist Poul Richard Hoj Jensen completed
a remarkable victory in the Etchells UK National and Open championships
in Danish Blue by winning the final race, local Clyde helm Keith
Lawrence, erstwhile overnight leader, watched his tenuous grasp on his
first major title disappear with a fourth place yesterday.
Hoj Jensen, supported by Scottish 470 coach Hamish Mackay, who is
sailing for the second year with the Dane, led from the first mark and
managed to hold on to his lead despite an unsettled breeze which
switched direction by up to 30[DEG].
''Basically, we just hung on and did absolutely everything we could.
It was a tough, tough race,'' said Mackay.
Lawrence, in his first season in the highly competitive class, could
only equal his poorest score of the week to finish second by a
quarter-of-a-point -- the smallest possible margin.
A last-minute title lifeline appeared as third-placed Adam Gosling,
sailing Yes!, signalled a protest against fifth-placed Tim Law for a
mark rounding infringement. Had Yes! been disqualified, Lawrence would
have won, but Law retired.
After two races at the Ultra 30 Grand Prix at Queen Mary, in Ashford,
Middlesex, Scotland's gold medallist Mike McIntyre lies third in
Orbitel, placing third and fourth yesterday. Series leader Russel Peters
heads the overall standings with two wins. Results:
Race 6 -- 1, Danish Blue (PR Hoj Jensen, Burnham); 2, Jessica (R
Power, Cowes); 3, Yes! (A Gosling, Cowes); 4, Playback (K Lawrence,
Gourock); 5, Baby Doll (G Francisco, Cowes).
Overall -- 1, Danish Blue 10.5pts; 2, Playback 10.75; 3, Katemba (T
Law, Cowes) 11.5; 4, Fiona VI (M Geaves, Burnham) 36; 5, Baby Doll 36.
Other Scots -- 11, Bullet VI (J Watson, Clyde); 13, Fortitude (T Ford,
Clyde).

<HEADLINE>Co-op pleased with progress at Stranraer plant. Creamery needs more investment</HEADLINE>

THE future of the Caledonian Cheese Company's creamery at Stranraer
looks bright with cheese production already at 50 tons per day.
However, more farmer capital is needed, according to Ian Evans,
chairman of the Farmers Creamery Co-operative, the producers
organisation which has already raised #1m in support of the venture,
holding a 20% stake in the business.
''We are delighted with the progress which has already been made
within the Stranraer plant and are highly optimistic about its long-term
potential,'' he announced yesterday.
The creamery is set to handle 100 million litres of milk a year,
making it the second-largest buyer from Scottish Milk and the
co-operative has 650 members as far north as Aberdeenshire. They have
invested an average of #15 per cow and have raised just over #1m of the
investment target of #1.25m.
With a slimmed down workforce of 90 compared to the 130 that were
previously employed, the creamery has a ready market for its output
through Glasgow-based cheese factors MacLelland and Son, which has a 60%
stake, the other 20% held by Cheshire-based traders Murray Vernon.
While the new, young cheeses are finding a ready market the long-term
plans are still being considered. New products are certainly in the
pipeline for both the home and the export markets.
''We are highly optimistic about the long-term potential of the
Stranraer plant,'' said Mr Evans.
He said the re-emergence of the creamery was a factor in holding up
the price for milk in the present market.
''The fact that the Farmers Creamery Co-operative has already
committed a seven-figure sum in support of this venture shows the
commitment which exists at farm level to milk production in the
south-west.
''That on-farm determination is being matched every step of the way by
our commercial partners as we all seek to establish the Caledonian
Cheese Company as a strong force in the UK market.
''There is a long way to go but we have made an excellent start and
have every confidence that the long-term results will be highly
positive.''
He said the former Galloway Creamery, which had a debt of #13m, was
now a viable business operation and in time would pay dividends to
shareholders.
''It is still too early to talk in any detail about the achievements
of the new company but we have reached the end of the beginning and are
very much on target for what we want to achieve.''
The plant is currently handling 500,000 litres of milk a day,
producing quality cheese and butter.
''It is flexible and versatile and we intend to exploit potential in
the production of a wide range of products.''

SCOTLAND'S world champion Peter Haining found himself in the
unaccustomed position of finishing fourth yesterday in his opening heat
of lightweight double sculls at the Lucerne International Regatta.
He and new partner Carl Smith must win their repechage today to stand
any chance of qualifying for tomorrow's final.
Olympic and world champions Steve Redgrave and Matthew Pinsent had a
comfortable win in their opening heat of men's coxless pairs. Britain's
women's eight, with former Edinburgh University captain Dot Blackie
aboard, also impressed in their opening race.
* ROMANIAN Fanica Hanuseac has been banned for life after she failed a
doping test.
The International Rowing Federation banned 27-year-old Hanuseac, a

nandrolon, an anabolic steroid, in two separate tests this year.
Hanuseac claimed that the only drugs she did not inform the team
doctor of were birth-control pills.

* COLIN Mitchell, the captain of Aberdeenshire, knows his side escaped
against local rivals Strathmore in the first championship game of the
season. On a Lochside wicket still drying out from the rain-ravaged
winter, they were chasing only 130. They managed to survive on 81 for
nine.
Things have changed a bit since then -- Aberdeenshire now top the
league, and the sunny weather had hardened the Mannofield wicket.
Mitchell said: ''In that first game, it's obvious we were playing for a
draw. We hope not to have to do that again this time.''
But Strathmore remain confident, especially as Nigel Hazel, Grant
Lawrence, and Mark Kelaher all were in the runs last week against
Perthshire.
West Lothian are on something of a charge -- four wins and a draw in
five weeks -- helped by opener Sanjay Patel, with a couple of 90s and an
unbeaten 70 last week.
Strong-going local rivals Stirling County visit Boghall and will hope
that Willie Morton's form -- he took six for 31 against Ayrshire at
Prestwick last week -- will continue.
Fourth-placed Ayrshire visit the talented but unpredictable Fifeshire
at McKane Park. Forfarshire and Arbroath County meet at Forthill, with
the home side keen to gain a second victory over their neighbours, while
Clackmannan play host to Perthshire at The Arns.

* THE bottom of the East Division One makes intriguing reading.
Despite having won three of their matches, a record bettered only by the
top three, Corstorphine are in last place.
Just above them, Edinburgh Academicals and Falkland have managed only
one win apiece but a points deduction imposed on Corstorphine by the
East Association, for a breach of player-registration rules, accounts
for the anomaly.
All three face difficult away fixtures, particularly Falkland, who
travel to Goldenacre for a tilt at leaders, Heriot's.
Ewan McIntyre's men have tasted nothing but success and there is an
ominous amount of clear water between them and those in pursuit. Cheany
Pandya and Robbie Nellies were in the runs for the Fifers last time out,
but their bowling may lack the penetration to ruffle the home line-up.
Corstorphine are at Grange Loan hoping to catch Carlton on a downer
following their heavy defeat at the weekend. The home side cannot afford
another slip if they are to catch the leaders.
Stenhousemuir is the destination for Edinburgh Academicals. Freuchie
are experiencing their worst league run for several seasons and
Watsonians may sniff a chance to bring home the points, while Grange
need to win at Royal High to keep any hope of the title.

* JOHN Major would be delighted if he had the same kind of
percentage-point lead that Progress Software Clydesdale hold in the DM
Hall Western Union. Not surprisingly, the question is being asked as to
whether this will be the Titwood side's season.
This afternoon, Drumpellier provide the opposition and the tea at
Langloan, as Clydesdale chase win No.7 from 10 starts.
Ayr have lost three times this season, but they remain the side
closest to Clydesdale in the table. And today at Hamilton Crescent, the
holders -- who also have a Whyte &amp; Mackay Scottish Cup semi-final place
in their sights -- face a West of Scotland side still reeling from the
hammering they took against Kilmarnock NK.
Killie found the winning touch last weekend against West. They will
fancy their chances of doubling that tally away to Tilbury Phoenix
Kelburne at Whitehaugh.
Poloc -- who will make it to the last four of the Scottish Cup if they
beat Forfarshire tomorrow -- are away to Ferguslie, who, ironically,
could pip them for a Cup semi-final spot.
Greenock had their copy-book blotted last weekend when they lost to
Ayr. But they will start favourites against basement side, Uddingston,
at Glenpark.

Tour de France
GERMAN Erik Zabel celebrated his twenty-seventh birthday in style by
clinching the sixth stage of the Tour de France yesterday while Dane
Bjarne Riis took over from Italian Ivan Gotti as the new race leader.
Zabel, who had underlined his determination with a third place in
Dunkerque on Thursday, and a second place in Le Havre 24 hours earlier,
won a mass sprint at the end of the day's 126.25-mile run from
Dunkerque.
Former race leader Laurent Jalabert of France was second, and sprint
ace Djamolidine Abdoujaparov of Uzbekistan was third as Riis came in
with the pack to seize the coveted yellow jersey.
Gotti, who had started the day with a fragile one-second lead over
Riis, finished only a few metres back, but nevertheless dropped to
second place overall, two seconds behind the new leader.
Jalabert, who lost his jersey with a dramatic fall one and a quarter
miles from the finish line at Le Havre on Wednesday, moves up five
places to third, eight seconds behind Riis.
The first of three stages in Belgium, culminating with a crucial
individual time trial tomorrow, saw local hero Herman Frison and
Frenchman Francois Simon break away after 57.5 miles to build a lead of
more than four minutes.
But the duo were caught by the pack 17.5 miles from home after having
led for just more than 51 miles. Frenchman Jean-Francois Bernard and
Italians Rassano Brasi and Maurizio Fondriest then seized their chance
but they were soon caught by the peloton.
Today's seventh stage takes the riders to Liege over 126.8 miles on a
route similar to the one used by the Liege-Bastogne-Liege classic.

I LIKED the DJ, he had a wicked sense of humour and prior to the main
event, he issued an ominous warning to the crowd, appealing for some
hush because, ''the guys' voices aren't what they used to be''.
So whether the blues? In bringing Honeyboy Edwards and Homesick James
to Glasgow, what we were promised was the notion of the authentic blues,
and we are expected to buy into the real thing. But legendary status
does not always equate with quality.
Honeyboy shuffled on stage and yelped: ''Everythin's gonna be
awlright.'' It wasn't. He looked good, but his own particular take on
the delta blues consisted mostly of off-key and fluffed notes coupled
with some pretty standard licks. At the end he had to be led off stage
to the cryptic DJ's aside of: ''We're just steering Honeyboy back to a
glass.'' The audience clapped understandingly.
Honesick James brought a promise of better things. Life, and every
inch the image the beer adds would have us believe a blues man looks
like, he sat cross-legged on his chair as if he was sitting on his own
front porch.
Despite his advancing years, he's 85, this older cousin of Elmore
James still managed to produce some inspired playing. His string
slapping and bending techniques were intriguing and he made it all look
so meltingly simple. His 50-minute set was a crowd pleaser, especially
when he played classics like Louise and Shake Your Money Maker.
Whether the blues? In Homesickjames, the legend lives on. He's the
real thing and there's not many left of his ilk. If you're happy to buy
into the heritage, the fact that this is the real blues, then I'm sure
you had a great night.

ITS very name, the Intertoto Cup, may inspire the same kind of excited
anticipation as ''Prisoner Cell Block H,'' but Partick Thistle intend to
keep defying its perceived value by clinching their place in the last 16
tonight in Metz.
With two games to go, Thistle lead their group in this bizarre
competition, and if they beat the team generally regarded as the most
formidable, they would be in prime position to move on to the next
stage.
And such is the mood among the squad which arrived in 82[DEG]F heat
last night, that they may well manage it.
Metz, who have slid down the merit table in France since Eric Black's
days -- the former Aberdeen man is still well thought of here -- have
reputedly bought seven new young players to try to begin the
re-establishment of their former status.
Their current No.1 is under-22 player, Robert Pires, perhaps
ambitiously cast as the next Michel Platini, but they were able to beat
Icelandic side Keflavik only 2-1 in their single game to date and that,
on the face of it, is not a stunning result.
Happily, Thistle, who beat Keflavik last weekend 3-1, had no travel
hitches this week, and arrived in good fettle to train at the stadium in
the evening.
Some of their staff, seasoned pros or not, are enjoying the experience
of European football, which has eluded them in their various careers.
That, and the fact that they have collected four points out of six so
far, is allowing them to believe they could end up in the UEFA Cup, the
prize for the last four in this competition.
They have a ''new'' name in their line-up, Paul Kinnaird, who has
returned to the club for his third spell, and if he enjoys it as much as
defender Steve Welsh, he will be glad of the move.
Former Cambridge United and Peterborough player Welsh can scarcely
believe the change coming to Thistle in January has produced. He ended
the season playing in front of 45,000 at Ibrox against Rangers and ''now
here I am playing in Europe.''
Added Welsh: ''There has been a lot of criticism of us for taking part
in this cup, but we would rather be doing this than running up and down
Ruchill Park.''

GLASGOW International Jazz Festival's composer-in-residence scheme has
had a chequered history, with expensive American imports often failing
to produce the goods.
This year's hot-seat occupant, Bobby Wellins, is more a composer
brought out of exile (from that well-known jazz centre, Bognor Regis)
and returning to his home city. Wellins has set about the educational
side of his task with relish, coaching young players, converting others,
and generally spreading his enthusiasm for the music.
Rather than the grandiose pieces of yore, Wellins kept his ambitions
for his specially commissioned Images of Scotland suite on a small
scale. Its five parts were impressionistic, a piano introduction with a
distinct westering home feel to it, followed by four uncomplicated
themes in a familiar jazz form. The Patter, for example, sounded not
unlike a Scottish cousin of Miles Davis's All Blues.
Each theme gave the Scottish All Stars' front-line players -- Bruce
Adams (trumpet), Gordon Campbell (trombone), and Jay Craig (baritone
saxophone) -- lots of room to stretch out, with Adams taking a
particularly impressive muted solo on the aptly named Ca' Canny.
Wellins, disappointingly, underscored his own part, but on The Wind
That Shakes the Barley, inspired by the second of James Barke's five
books on Robert Burns, his affectingly austere tenor saxophone tone and
economical phrasing reminded us of why this musician should be heard
much more often in these parts.
Another exiled Glaswegian, guitarist Jim Mullen, featured in The
Fishing Fleet with some typically clear, bluesy playing and made a
telling contribution to The Patter before a reprise of The Elements
provided a quiet finale to a low-key work.

In fending off the challenge of Graham Fox, the 18-year-old Stirling

A man is supposed to be everything unto himself: some kind of great,
sturdy, tall-masted boat
It's difficult to be a man in the nineties --
there's flak flying everywhere, and there are
no role models to turn to for inspiration and
guidance. For, as Stephen Ferguson argues,
cynicism is spreading faster than a flu virus
-- and all male egos are catching cold
SOMEWHERE inside every man there is a graveyard -- full of headstones
and weeds and dereliction. The air there is poor, the mood is solemn,
and it always rains. Always. And with every year of life that goes by
another grave is added; another coffin, another wreath, another hurt.
The headstone inscriptions tell of years filled with dreams and
ambitions that came to nothing. Some bear the names of absent lovers
from previous relationships; relationships that failed somehow, for some
reason. Unrequited loves, estranged family members and busted-up
friendships are mentioned there too, with epitaphs that speak of
grievances and misunderstandings, of things never said, and things never
done that should have been done.
Around the graveyard is a high embankment; a border of tight-lipped
regrets, languishing heavy and stale -- frustrated and wordless.
Does it come as any surprise, then, that so many men sport a
grey-granite, weathered, already-buried look?
In recent years new graves have been multiplying: the graves of those
male heroes that, in the past, life could not touch. Heroes who
previously sailed on and on, unblemished by the withering hands of time
and fashion, immortal and fantastic.
Contemporary heroes, though still cast in the mould of the past, now
have the lifespan of sparks -- there one minute with a fierce flash, but
then a bland, disappointed moment follows as the elevated hero tumbles
earthwards.
Hugh Grant's alleged indiscretion with a prostitute is a good example
of how the clean-cut reputation rubs off like fool's gold. Guffawing
Gazza turned speedily from sensitive nouveau homo crying into his
jersey, to farting Neanderthal in stomping studs. The world of pop is
far from immune: the self-styled King of Pop's career nearly popped for
good over allegations of child sexual-abuse. Glance at the cover of a
tabloid and, day after day they abound with the peccadilloes of
clergymen, drug-taking athletes and rumbled politicians.
But are male heroes dying-out just when their sex needs them the most?
Ah, these troubled times for masculinity! Coming under pressure from all
sides, coming under fire from every angle. Surely all the questions of
what it means to be a man in the Nineties could be neatly answered by a
hero who didn't trip over his own boot laces so often -- a hero who
could be a role-model for his gender: unfaltering, indomitable and full
of depth, nuance, sensitivity and strength? Is it all too much to ask?
Is this really cloud cuckoo-land? Is that pig really flying?
The evidence that male heroes are running out of steam and substance
is not only to be found in the chronicles of the media. Ask any man if
he has a hero and most will now answer with a quite simple ''no''. Why?
For one thing, cynicism is setting-in like rigor-mortis as they watch
hero after hero crawl, mortally wounded, into their graves.
For another, admitting to having a hero could now be taken as a tacit
admittance of homosexuality. And a third reason is that for a man to
have a hero is to imply that he might just need some kind of a
role-model for life, that could give the impression that the man is not
quite as complete as he would have people believe. After all, a man is
supposed to be everything unto himself: self-assembly, non-leaking, and
complete with easy-to-use paints and a set of transfers. In short, some
kind of great, sturdy, tall-masted boat.
There was a time when James Dean was enough for a man. Marlon Brando,
Humphrey Bogart, Winston Churchill even. Elvis, Cary Grant, James
Cagney, Jesse Owens, Doug McClure. Fathers used to be acceptable heroes
too, yet now the generation gap interferes with topical demands.
Heroes used to be so simple, because the world knew so little about
them. The fiction, the dream of invincibility was easier to maintain --
now the media sees all, as if the camera lens is made to detect
indiscretions beneath the smile or the sneer, as if ''misdemeanour'' was
merely another colour in the spectrum.Well, thank goodness for Batman!
And Superman, too. Not forgetting Spiderman, Flash Gordon, and the
Fantastic Four.
And yet the problem with fictional heroes transferring to the big
screen is that the mess and debris of reality is never far away, as
proven by the recent tragic accident which befell Christopher Reeves,
the actor who played Superman in four Hollywood movies. After the
household name tumbled from a horse and broke his spine, the world felt
as if it had happened to Superman himself, not the actor. The world
sensed that a super-hero had let them down. How dare he!
But the whole notion of the male hero as a panacea for masculine ills
is a universal, time-served male fallacy-symbol, perpetuated in the main
by the belief that what all women want in a man in the archetypal,
unflinching hero of the silver screen.
But experience shows that although the hero of the big screen may be
sexy and romantic to women (and why not?), they lack the very thing that
only real-life can deliver -- the key ingredient that damns the hero but
elevates the ordinary man to the position of long-term lover or husband:
a vein of uncertainty, an element of insecurity, a glimmer of
self-doubt.
After all, it is an intrinsic human truth that it is rarely the
strength in a person that leads us believe that we are seeing deeper.
Traditional heroes are understood by women to be shallow, devoid of
dimensions and intrigue, and ultimately spurious. But a whole lot of
fun, for that!
In time, perhaps we will concentrate more on acts of heroism rather
than on heroes. The media, at least, has not dismissed the stories of
ordinary men who took charge of dangerous situations and turned them
around, pushing against chaos and personal insecurities. Acts of heroism
are mysterious things; heroes are just plastic and nonsense.
Conventional heroes are regarded as complete, ready-made, men prepared
earlier. When, in reality, real acts of heroism are committed by men in
flux; making heroism up as they go along -- muddling on through; hoping
that, if required, they can muddle on through again. In time, the death
of the male hero will be seen as the best thing to happen to manhood.
Traditional heroes as role-models has always been a prickly
association. But real-life heroes as role-models is more often an easier
equation to deal with. A hero close to home, a hero living and breathing
before our very eyes is surely easier to emulate and understand than one
off a Hollywood conveyor-belt. And the men that boys are surrounded by
as they grow up are always the primary role-models for behaviour in
adult life.
They are the role-models that slip in under the surface and cast
influence even when boys think they are paying no attention. It's a long
line of poor influences that create violent, frustrated and dispossessed
men at odds with the world around them. By tearing down soulless,
one-dimensional heroes, we help to break the malevolent line.
And what of that cemetery inside of all men? What does the future hold
for it? Although male heroes have only just begun to populate the
graveyard in huge numbers, the truth is that they have done much in the
past to create the graveyard itself, and all in it -- by making
unreasonable demands of men, by exposing inadequacies, laughing at
insecurities and fears. Surely, the whole concept of the male hero will
have to change in time, to become a truer reflection of who men are.
This would not be good news for a baying media with a taste for the
blood of the imperfect, but at least the graveyard could be admitted to
and cleaned up a little. It will never be removed, of course, because it
is natural that things live and die within life, and memories of thought
and feelings should be slotted away somewhere. But perhaps a few flowers
here and there. And does it have to rain quite so often?
And a little less mourning would be nice, too. And how about
stone-blasting a few of those mausoleum faces while we're at it. Now,
Michael Jackson -- the fearless hero of plastic surgeons the world over
-- might have some good advice on how that could be achieved.

IT WAS probably the most elaborate stage-set Barrowland had seen for
many years -- the futuristic piano and drum kits, projection screens and
drapes alongside a massive array of lighting effects, would have
eclipsed most performers, but not Bjork, arguably the only bona fide new
star to have emerged so far in the '90s.
Last night's show underlined this: in spite of its brevity (an hour)
and the mixed fare in terms of songs (a conspicuous absence of structure
in some of the newer material, the omission of some of the better, older
ones) it was an overwhelming and sometimes overpowering performance.
Bjork's show is as theatrical as it is musical, the big gestures and
the vast array of facial expressions signify a performance that in every
way matches the intensity and the joyousness of the voice.
She started in seated position, moody and atmospheric, before Army Of
Me and Human Behaviour took things in a crashing, metallic direction.
For a band with no guitar and bass players the emphasis was more on the
textured layers of sound and the beauty of the voice.
Her charisma swamped Barrowland, the show by far the most adventurous,
both musically and stylistically, you are ever likely to see from an
artist who has sold so many records.

TRIPLE jumper Jonathan Edwards led a quartet of British winners in the
KP Games at Crystal Palace last night.
But the Gateshead man pulled out as a precautionary measure after
three jumps, limping off to the physio room for treatment on a sore
ankle. His second leap, of 17.69m, was four centimetres short of his
British record.
Dominant also were Tony Jarrett, with his best 110m hurdles
performance of the season, 13.20sec, Steve Backley, who produced his
best javelin throw for three years of 88.54m, and Kelly Holmes, with an
impressive 800m win in 1-58.77.
A total of #100,000 was on offer, plus bonuses, at Britain's first
meeting to offer prize money. Ireland's Sonia O'Sullivan collected the
biggest cheque with #5000 for her 5000m success. She set another Irish
record with 14-47.64, followed by Paula Radcliffe with an English native
best of 14-49.27. Scotland's Yvonne Murray finished fourth in 14-56.94
ahead of fellow Britons Alison Wyeth (15-00.37) and Jill Hunter
(15-48.16).
There was disappointment also for Tom McKean, who was beaten by more
than three seconds into tenth place with a 800m time of 1-48.07. Winners

IN THE heyday of Scottish men's hockey, France was a happy hunting
ground for the national team but not any more. Scotland were sent
crashing to a 4-1 defeat by France in the first of three Tests at Douai
last night.
The Scots scored a late goal through David Ralph, his first for
Scotland, but this was a rather indifferent French side. The great
Patrick Burchell, the former French captain, must have wondered what has
happened to French -- and Scottish -- hockey. His team of the 1970s
could have given both sides a five-goal start and a beating in the
process.
Scotland's main deficiencies were understandably in defence. The
tackling was weak and the clearances generally went to a French striker.
The Scots outscored 10-6 on penalty corners, reflecting the balance of
play, but repeatedly made mistakes at the back.
Shaun Middleton twice failed to terminate solo runs by the French
strikers, and goals resulted for Bengamin Shindler and Oliver Petit.
Coach Billy McPherson restructured his defence after the interval
around his captain, Duncan Low. This move worked for a time but with 12
minutes remaining, goalkeeper Paul Mellor blotted his copybook when he
was beaten by a straight strike by Ludovic Tissier from a penalty
corner. Two minutes later he was beaten for a fourth time in the game by
Petit.
These goals came against the run of play but Scotland did manage to
salvage something from the night when Ralph converted their ninth corner
five minutes from time. He was one of the few players who came up to
expectations.

STEFFI Graf, unbeaten in 31 matches this year, should win the
Wimbledon title for the sixth time in eight years today. And if she
does, her victim, Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, will be heading for her own,
special, type of Grand Slam.
This year the fleet-footed Spanish girl has already played in the
finals of the first two Grand Slam tournaments but lost each time. She
went down 6-3, 6-2 to Mary Pierce in the Australian Open in January and
was beaten 7-5, 4-6, 6-0 by Graf in the French Open four weeks ago.
So tomorrow, if form runs true, Sanchez Vicario will be runner-up for
the third successive Grand Slam with only the US Open, where she is
reigning champion, to come this year.
Graf was not too impressive in her three set victory over Jana Novotna
in the semi-finals but her suspect back is giving her no trouble and she
seems to hold all the aces against her Spanish opponent.
She has the stronger service, should be less nervous as this is her
seventh final, has beaten Sanchez Vicario 25 times in 33 meetings, and
even on the Spanish girl's favourite clay surface beat her easily enough
at the French Open.
Sanchez Vicario, too, may sub-consciously relax a little now that she
is in the final for the first time. After beating compatriot Conchita
Martinez in the semi-final, she said: ''Reaching the final is a dream
come true.
''My goal when I came here was to pass the quarter-finals for the
first time and, having done that, it gives you greater confidence to go
further.''
This is not quite the same as predicting victory over Graf, who is
much more confident of success.
Graf is too modest and too sensible to make wild predictions, but
there was a quiet confidence in her voice when, asked whether she would
win, she said: ''I'm not going to under-estimate her at all. One thing
I'm not going to do is feel I'm the absolute favourite.''
That was an intelligent answer from the 26-year-old German superstar,
but what she says and what she really thinks are probably poles apart.
Sanchez Vicario is a brainy player who mixes drop shots and lobs with
great ground strokes on both wings, but she has never been one to charge
the net.
This Wimbledon, she has been serving well and volleying more but her
natural home is the baseline and if she stays there long enough she will
be picked off by Graf's superior power.
Sanchez Vicario says that the fact that Martinez, another baseliner,
won the title last year has proved that Wimbledon can be won from the
back of the court.
That could be wishful thinking if Graf has her 110mph service working
well. Even Martinez says that Sanchez Vicario must come to the net far
more than usual.
It will be no disgrace if Sanchez Vicario loses her first final. That
misfortune befell Graf herself when she played Martina Navratilova in
her debut final in 1987.
Graf lost that match 7-5, 6-3 but bounced back to beat the great
Martina in the next two finals. Then she beat Gabriela Sabatini in the
1991 final, Monica Seles in 1992, and Novotna in 1993.
It's a great record so it must be Graf to win an entertaining contest
to collect her sixth singles title, just three short of Navratilova's
record nine.

HERIOT'S have denied reports that their first-team players are to be
paid for playing next season. However, the Edinburgh side are setting up
the first players' trust fund in Scottish club rugby.
Director of rugby Fraser Dall said: ''There is certainly no money
passing hands, nor has there ever been. We are setting up a trust fund
this year for the following season and it will be run under strict SRU
guidelines.''
Given the rapid surge towards professionalism, Dall says limited
financial packages for Scotland's leading club players are probably
inevitable, but he warned: ''Clubs genuinely cannot afford to pay
players on a weekly basis. We would be out of business in six months.
''However, if the players earn money for the club, through sevens
touranments or winning the league, I don't see why some of that money
should not be directed towards a trust fund. There might be enough for a
holiday for each of the players at the end of the season.''
Meanwhile, South Africa's 14 rebel rugby union players agreed
yesterday to suspend their campaign for improved pay and benefits until
the International Rugby Board discusses the issue next month.
''At this stage we have reached an agreement that suits both
parties,'' said centre and fly-half Hennie le Roux, one of the group of
13 Springboks -- including victorious World Cup captain Francois Pienaar
-- and a provincial player, all of whom play for Transvaal province.
The row erupted on Monday when the Transvaal provincial union rejected
the proposals and expelled le Roux and three others, prompting the whole
group to make themselves unavailable for selection for the team that
will open Transvaal's defence of their Currie Cup title today.
The statement said all Transvaal players would attend training on
Monday but the second string team to play Eastern Province would not be
changed. Le Roux said: ''All we wanted was fair representation and for
our views to be heard ... It involves every player worldwide.
''The same issues and problems keep recurring and we would just like
to sort them out. It may be the Transvaal players now, but all the
players in top rugby union want the same thing.''

THE European Union continues to move in mysterious ways after
announcing yesterday that Red Star, Belgrade and FC Obilic would now be
allowed to compete in European competition.
Twenty four hours earlier they had announced that neither team would
be permitted to play until a July 11 meeting of the Competitions'
Committee made the final decision.
Yesterday Red Star were admitted to the UEFA Cup -- not the Champions'
Cup in spite of their pedigree. Obilic will play in the Cup Winners'
tournament but their inclusion is unlikely to change the earlier UEFA
suggestion that the Parkhead side will miss the preliminary round. The
little known Yugoslav side will not be among the seeded teams. That will
leave Celtic high and dry in the first round proper, a bonus they did
not expect.

ENGLAND are down and ready to be counted out inside three rounds at
Edgbaston after another horror show by their top-order batsmen.
Already bruised and battered by injuries and a battling, luck-tinged
half-century from Richie Richardson, they collapsed to 59 for three
during the final 17 overs.
Barring an astonishing change in fortunes, the result is likely to be
a crushing defeat and an inquest into their lack of resolve when under
hostile fire.
Mike Atherton (4) fell for his fifth consecutive low score, middle
stump uprooted by a rapid delivery from Courtney Walsh that jagged back
between bat and pad. Graeme Hick (3) -- again found wanting when the
chips were down -- could only fend Ian Bishop's lifter into the slip
cordon.
Perhaps most disappointingly of all, given his fighting qualities over
the past 18 months, Graham Thorpe was out for nought when he cut at
Bishop's wide ball to present a catch behind.
The wickets had tumbled in just 15 deliveries, and England -- 153
behind on first innings -- were in disarray at 26 for three.
Robin Smith, forced to open again, and Dominic Cork shut the door to
the close of play but with 94 more runs needed even to avoid an innings
defeat, and both Alec Stewart and Jason Gallian handicapped by finger
injuries, it will be a surprise if this match is not concluded before
tomorrow's scheduled rest day.
For three hours or so England had harboured hopes of a recovery. Cork
-- nursing a badly bruised finger of his own -- added three more prize
scalps to the one wicket he had gained the evening before as West Indies
stumbled from 104 for one to 198 for six.
But then Lady Luck turned her back on England. Television replays
suggested that Zimbabwe umpire Ian Robinson should have upheld an appeal
for a catch behind when Richardson was facing Angus Fraser and had
scored only four. On 25, the West Indies' captain was reprieved by
Atherton at slip when Cork found the outside edge to create a low,
right-handed chance.
He went on to make 69, and Bishop helped him to add 62 for the seventh
wicket as West Indies regained control. Scoreboard:

CLOUDS gathered over Wimbledon yesterday and inside Centre Court a
dark, brooding presence took up residence. It was all very apt on a day
when the tennis would be dominated by dangerous serves and killing
volleys.
The top four -- Agassi, Sampras, Becker, and Ivanisevic -- were all
let loose on the same afternoon, which was not for the faint-hearted or
the meek, and even the sun which had bathed these Championships since
day one was afraid to come out.
Yesterday was no time for hesitancy or loss of nerve, yet lose his
nerve Andre Agassi did.
Who could have blamed him, however, given the circumstances and some
of the onlookers. Almost on cue, as the sky grew sullen, the large
figure of Ion Tiriac squeezed into a seat just behind the players' box
without showing a ticket. As Goran Ivanisevic's manager and mentor, the
Romanian had a right to a place in the Centre Court, but no one among
the security people was willing to ask for his credentials.
Tiriac was left to watch and to brood alone until he was joined by one
of his countrymen, Ilie Nastase, who had been lurking in a stairwell for
most of the first Centre Court match, which featured Goran Ivanisevic
and Pete Sampras trying to bludgeon one another into submission.
However, Agassi and Becker offered respite from the thunder of the
first match -- which Sampras won 7-6, 4-6, 6-3, 4-6, 6-3 -- with some
thrilling rallies. It didn't seem as though it would be so exciting,
though, after the first hour, which was so one-sided Agassi was cruising
with Becker on edge.
He served poorly, lost the opening game, and Agassi broke again to
lead 5-2 and although Becker had two break points, he couldn't prevent
the American from taking the set 6-2.
Becker is nothing, though, if not a slugger and after having trailed
4-1 in the next set he staged a truly remarkable recovery to win the
match 2-6, 7-6, 6-4, 7-6 in two hours and 54 minutes.
After having recovered his double break of serve in the second set,
Becker's confidence grew steadily and the acrobatic shots which marked
his play when he first took the circuit by surprise were dragged out
again to everyone's delight.
When Agassi overhit a simple forehand to end a gruelling contest,
Becker turned to the crowd one finger raised as though proclaiming his
return.
While Becker, who won the championship in 1985, '86, and '89, began to
grow in stature, Agassi, winner in '92, was deflating.
Later he said: ''He stepped up a level, I didn't, and when I needed my
confidence it wasn't there. I came here wanting to win and I'm very
disappointed.
''After that second set, I just didn't rise emotionally to the
challenge.''
Sampras and Ivanisevic were first up yesterday, and the opening ball
of their contest was clubbed at 1.08pm. Two hours and 26 minutes, and 59
aces, later -- Ivanisevic hit 38 of them -- it was all over and Sampras
was into his third successive Wimbledon singles final and Ivanisevic,
who lost in three sets to the American in last year's final, was out.
At least Ivanisevic played his part in making the match much more
interesting than that final, which many described as the most boring
they had witnessed on Centre Court. The Croat and Sampras are not among
the great entertainers of the sporting world but occasionally yesterday
they did a little more than try to kill one another with little yellow
missiles.
Goodness, once or twice they almost played a rally!
Also, in the ninth game of the first set, Ivanisevic showed his human
side when, after a Sampras serve had been called out, he walked
purposefully to the opposite end of the court, his body language
suggesting he believed the shot to have been an ace. The umpire, Gerry
Armstrong, over-ruled the line judge and Ivanisevic was given a round of
applause for his sportsmanship.
The first break of serve arrived in the tenth game of the second set
which Ivanisevic claimed, but immediately afterwards his concentration
went for a wander and by the time it had returned he had been broken in
the opening game of the third set, and he would be broken again at the
end of the set.
Sampras was broken again in the seventh game of the next set, but in
the final set Ivanisevic surrendered his serve again just after he had
appeared to be back in a groove.

Deede Cuddihy suggests the ideal way to take the strain out of holiday
gift buying
SOUVENIR buying: does the thought of having to trawl the shops looking
for appropriate mementoes to take to exiled friends and relatives in
Leeds, London or Toronto fill you with dread?
One way around the problem is to postpone purchasing until your day of
departure, arrive at the bus, rail or air terminal in plenty of time
with an empty carrier bag and hit the shops on the station concourse.
This might have been a risky idea in the days when even overseas
travellers were offered little more than 200 cigarettes and a bottle of
whisky (not forgetting the latest Harold Robbins novel for the flight).
Now there are boutiques filled with all manner of souvenirs, cleverly
designed and packaged to part passengers from their money as they wait
for that flight, coach or train.
Glasgow Airport, for instance, has become such a rich source of good
quality Scottish mementoes that people travel out from the city centre
and use it as an alternative mini shopping mall.
The Best of Scotland, with branches at Edinburgh and Aberdeen airports
as well, does offer the best, which is only what one should expect from
an enterprise run by two members of the aristocracy.
On the food side there are kippers from Inverawe, venison sausages and
pate; smoked, sliced duck and salmon, some of it from Scotland's oldest
fish house (in use since 1585), done in your choice of oak, peat or
dill.
Horn ware including combs and spoons come from Irvine; cashmere gloves
(#12.70) and scarves from Elgin; golfing china from St Andrews; fancy
soaps and bath oil from Arran.
Tartan Plus manages to rise above real kitsch while still providing
gifts which are not only recognisably Scottish but are mostly made here
as well. Tartan printed leather wallets; magnetic Scottish castles for
your fridge door; grow your own heather sets (even a tartan air
freshener).
John Menzies, the newsagent, has a commendable selection of Scottish
books at their branch on the first floor: travel, history, biography,
fiction. Everything from McGonagall to John Buchan; tartan to Margaret
Thomson Davis; Glasser to the latest from Booker prizewinner, James
Kelman.
Oddbins at Glasgow Airport claims to have the finest selection of rare
Scottish whiskies in the world, including a 31-year-old Ord at #110.95,
which one American ''with no outward signs of wealth'', as the manager
diplomatically put it, recently bought using his platinum American
Express card.
Strang's the jewellers has an impressive shop here with a small range
of Scottish crystal, while Our Price music offer a not bad selection of
Scottish tapes and CDs, including folk, rock, Jimmy Shand, pipes and
drums, the Glasgow Orpheus Choir; Billy Connolly, Gaelic Psalms and John
Cairney as Robert Burns.
At Central Station, Peckham's is your best bet for Scottish souvenirs
-- all of the eating or drinking variety. There are cheeses,
shortbreads, chocolate truffles and fancy decanters of Scottish
liqueurs.
Buchanan Street Bus Station, recently refurbished and now a delight to
behold, has The Shop which stocks a limited but better than you might
expect range of momentos.

Western open
TOM Watson recovered from a poor start to share second place after the
second round at the $2m Western Open at Chicago yesterday.
Watson teed off with the outright lead at Cog Hill, but things did not
augur well when he bogeyed three of the first four holes in a only light
morning breeze, a far cry from Thursday's howling wind.
However, birdies at the next two holes steadied Watson who, after a
another bogey at his tenth hole, birdied three of his final six for a
respectable one-under 71.
He joined fellow American Steve Lowery (70) at five-under 139, while
compatriot Jay Haas birdied the final two holes to shoot 68 and open up
a two-stroke lead.
''I finished pretty strongly and started off a little shaky,'' said
Watson, winner of eight major championships including five Open titles.
However, he has not won on the American Tour since 1987, and his only
worldwide win since then was at the 1992 Hong Kong Open.
While Watson stayed on course hopefully to break his drought, Paul
Azinger also moved into the picture with a bogey-free five-under 67 that
leaves him only four strokes from the lead.
Azinger has struggled this year due mainly to fatigue caused by the
after-effects of chemotherapy treatment. He was diagnosed as having
cancer in his right shoulder blade in late 1993, shortly after winning
the US PGA Championship, and was out of action for eight months while
beating the disease.
Defending champion Nick Price made the cut, although he trails by nine
shots after a 71. Leading scores (US unless stated):
137 -- Jay Haas 69, 68.
139 -- Steve Lowery 69, 70; Tom Watson 68, 71.
140 -- Brett Ogle (Australia) 68, 71.
141 -- Paul Azinger 74, 67; Justin Leonard 70, 71; John Huston 73, 68;
Jim Carter 73, 68.
142 -- Billy Ray Brown 72, 70; Greg Kraft 71, 71; Scott Hoch 73, 69;
Duffy Waldorf 73, 69.
143 -- Billy Mayfair 73, 70; Scott Simpson 71, 72; Don Pooley 76, 67;
Fred Couples 70, 73; Ken Green 72, 71; Joel Edwards 69, 74; Ronnie Black
71, 72.
Other scores: 146 -- Nick Price (Zimbabwe) 75, 71; Vijay Singh (Fiji)
73, 73. 147 -- Corey Pavin 74, 73; Davis Love 73, 74.
FIONA Farquharson (Camperdown) yesterday won the Women's Highland
Amateur Open at Pitlochry for a record sixth time, beating Claire
Hargan, an 18-year-old Dundee University student from Cardross, by one
hole in the final.
Two up going to the fourteenth, Farquharson lost that hole and the
sixteenth to birdies. The seventeenth was shared in birdies, and
Farquharson's par at the eighteenth proved decisive after Hargan, with
too much club, ditched her tee-shot and finally missed from four feet.
Results:
Semi-finals: C Hargan (Cardross) beat J Taylor (Alloa), 5 and 3; F
Farquharson (Camperkdown) beat R Gilbertson (Prestwick St Cuthbert), 4
and 3. Final: Farquharson beat Hargan, 1 hole.

DEALERS gleefully pushed prices of the 12 English electricity
distributors smartly forward again yesterday on the belief that
regulator Professor Stephen Littlechild had yet again let them off
relatively lightly, which could trigger renewed predatory interest in
the sector.
The one most likely bid candidate, Northern, gained 20p to 858p, for a
rise on the week of 64p, but others were up much more. South Western was
ahead 18% on the week at 793p and Midlands 15% at 726p.
Buyers were after Northern because of hopes that Trafalgar House would
renew its bid for the group. Its first #11-a-share offer was allowed to
lapse and Trafalgar indicated it would be prepared to offer #9.50 after
Professor Littlechild announced in March he would be undertaking another
review of electricity prices. Northern said it would consider such a bid
only after the Professor had pronounced.
Northern originally indicated that #9.50 would not be enough but it
may now be considered more reasonable under the new electricity pricing
formula. Northern will have to reduce its electricity prices in
aggregate by 34% between now and the year 2000, the highest proportion
of all the electricity distributors, possibly in recognition of the
leeway the group has, given its original defence proposal to return
#560m to shareholders.
Trafalgar will be poring over Professor Littlechild's statement to
decide if and how much it will offer. The other bid favourite is
Yorkshire, on the grounds that Lord Hanson will be temped to move for
the distributor which covers his local patch. The shares gained 34p to
770p.
With the pricing regime now presumably certain for the next five
years, the profitability of the electricity sector can be assessed more
accurately. They offer bidders a steady stream of reliable UK cash flow
which could be of interest to an overseas earner. In Trafalgar's case it
could offset Northern's profits against tax losses.
There is also more chance of mergers within the sector as companies
try to cut costs further, though there is doubt in the industry whether
enough savings could be made to justify the bid premium which would have
to be paid.
A more plausible possibility suggested recently by Malcolm Chatwin,
chief executive of Yorkshire, is that a third party, possibly an
overseas utility, could acquire two companies and put them together.

STOCK market screens were a mass of blue yesterday as financial
markets in London, Frankfurt, and Paris were boosted by overnight
decisions to lower interest rates in the US and Japan and the improved
prospects of a reduction in Germany, possibly as early as next week.
By last night the FTSE-100 share index was within striking distance of
its all-time closing high of 3520.3, achieved as long ago as February 2
last year. Yet only last week at the height of the uncertainty generated
by John Major's re-election battle the Footsie had fallen below the 3300
level.
The stock market enjoyed its biggest one-day gain since the two days
immediately following Britain's forced departure from Europe's exchange
rate mechanism in September 1992.
The FTSE-100 jumped 74.6 points to 3462.9, where it is now within 1.7%
of last February's record, but is still around 1200 points adrift from
the Dow-Jones in New York.
The Footsie's 2.2% advance yesterday was bettered by Paris's 3.2%, but
surpassed Frankfurt's 1.5%. Equity strategists, such as those at James
Capel who have been forecasting that the index would rise to 3750 by the
end of the year, are now feeling much more relaxed about the targets
they have set.
Share prices are feeding off the more favourable interest rate
environment around the globe which has boosted bonds and increased the
attractions of buying the dividend stream of blue-chip companies. There
is a feeling too that monetary authorities are attaching a higher
priority to growth at the expense of demanding inflation objectives. If
so, this has to be good for equities.
Following America's decision to reduce the Fed funds rate by 0.25% to
5.75% the Bank of Japan eased short-term money market rates by
half-a-point, though the official discount rate was left unchanged at a
historically low 1%.
The Federal Reserve's move was seen as an insurance policy against
recession returning to the US, but the risks that it would eventually
spark off a fresh bout of inflation were heightened yesterday by an
unexpectedly large jump in June's non-farm payrolls of 215,000.
In Japan the economy has never stirred itself from its longest
post-war recession. The Bank of Japan's credit easing, which may have
been co-ordinated with the Fed, set the severely depressed Tokyo stock
market alight. Share prices gained 6.27%.
The fact that Japan had cut rates by twice as much as the US boosted
the dollar at the expense of the yen and other low-interest currencies.
The Fed in concert with the Bank of Japan gave the dollar further
momentum yesterday by supporting it in the foreign exchange markets.
Attention has now turned to Germany where there are hopes of a cut of
as much as half-a-point in the key discount and Lombard rates from 4%
and 6% respectively. The Bundesbank meets next week, but could decide to
wait until after the summer recess when inflation should be lower. But
it might take the view that there is no time like the present to lend a
helping hand to the dollar and take some of the pressure off German
exporters.
The implications for monetary policy in the UK are more difficult to
unravel. The CBI's economist, Sudhir Junankar, had a good stab at it. He
said the Fed move gave the UK some breathing space on interest rates,
but he still thought a rise before the end of the year was on the cards.
He expected rates to peak at 7.25% to 7.5% or slightly higher.
UK rates have been on hold since May when the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, rejected advice by the Governor of the Bank
of England, Eddie George, to raise them.
James Capel's Adam Cole pointed out last night that US rates had been
increased by twice as much as in the UK and that American primes had
been at 9% (just reduced to 8.75%) against base rates of 6.75%.
It would take a strong recovery in sterling to shut the Bank of
England up, and this would need an extended rally in the dollar. If rate
cuts in the safe-haven countries such as Japan and Germany outpace those
in the US that could occur, but it is unlikely that the effect on the
pound would be sufficient to avert the need for higher UK rates in due
course.
The problem is well illustrated by yesterday's main foreign exchange
movements. Sterling gained 1.04 pfennigs to DM2.2193, but shed
0.31-of-a-cent to $1.5947. As a result the trade-weighted index edged up
just 0.1 to 83.7, where it has still lost 5.4% of its international
value since the start of the year.

SIGNET, formerly Ratners, has at last returned to profits after three
years of losses, making #8.1m in the year to last January, against
losses of more than 10 times this amount last time.
But the jeweller's shares yesterday slipped 1p to 12[1/2]p on a
disappointing performance so far this year.
Though Signet is struggling to maintain its recovery, chairman Jim
McAdam considers the group is fundamentally fit again after
reorganisation. Non-core businesses like Watches of Switzerland and
Salisburys, have been sold and 40 stores have been closed including all
the loss-making Ratners units.
Financially, net debt stands at #333m and there are facilities of
#440m in place. Before capital spending of #25m there was cash
generation of #30m. But the problem of the #93m owed in unpaid
Preference dividends is a millstone.
In the UK like-for-like sales improved 2% in 1994/95 and more at
Christmas. The plan is to develop the H Samuel and Ernest Jones brands
through marketing initiatives, new products and store modernisation.
UK trading profits bounced up to #16.2m but in the US they reversed by
#10m to #30m. In Sterling, the group has the second largest jewellery
chain in the shopping malls but competition intensified and the company
failed to make its sales projections. After a review Signet said
opportunities to improve its performance have been identified and costs
have been cut by $28m.

SCOTTISH Enterprise yesterday put three of its 13 local enterprise
companies up for grabs on the open market, including the flagship
Glasgow Development Agency.
The others are Lanarkshire Development Agency and Dunbartonshire
Enterprise. The trio's combined budget allocations from Scottish
Enterprise are worth more than #127m a year.
Official confirmation that their present boards must tender for
contracts to continue operations -- if bids from rival consortia are
received -- follows The Herald's exclusive report that Scottish
Enterprise was set to seek interested parties to take over Lecs.
It was said the impending trawl might be designed to force critics of
the network to ''put up or shut up''.
But subsequent inquiries suggest the main reason for inviting
outsiders to take over is European Commission insistence on the need for
open and competitive tendering processes.
It is understood the Commission threatened legal action -- and the
withdrawal of #46m of annual support to the Scottish network -- unless
directives on public procurement were followed.
The three Lecs yesterday put on brave faces about facing competition
for the first time. They were adamant the invitations to bid were down
to boundary changes in the areas they cover, and certainly not related
to their performance records. Not one mentioned the European dimension.
Labour Euro MP Alex Smith, who had complained to the EC that contracts
for training and enterprise were not being advertised, last night hailed
Scottish Enterprise's announcement to seek bids as ''a victory''.
He added: ''Rather than retain cosy arrangements with Lecs, it will
now be brought into line by inviting other people to apply for the
contracts to run services. It is a victory for accountability and
openness.''
Mr Smith added that the Commission recently gave Scottish Enterprise a
month to comply with tendering edicts, and went on: ''I welcome the
opportunity for other parties to deliver services in the Lec areas.''
Failure to comply with European directives would have led to the
agency losing 10% of its annual #467m budget, jeopardising 43,000
training places, according to sources.
It is also understood the 10 other Lecs will face competition as and
when their contracts come up for renewal under a three-year rolling
programme.
Question marks over Scottish Enterprise's public accountability were
underlined earlier this year by the Commons Scottish Affairs Committee,
which recommended an overhaul of the Lec boards' membership because they
were self-perpetuating and self-selecting.
Professor Donald MacKay, Scottish Enterprise chairman, yesterday
stressed that invitations to tender were not driven by concerns about
the performance of existing boards, but the agency's desire to be open
and accountable. They also arose from new Lec boundaries coming into
effect in April next year, which will be similar to those of the new
unitary local authorities.
GDA chairman Michael Lunn, whose board receives #61m from
headquarters, pledged to ''compete vigorously'' against any groupings
that might emerge for the contract.
He argued the GDA was professional, cost effective and confident of
its existing strategies and programmes for the city. He added: ''We have
achieved significant success over the past four years, and are now even
better equipped to develop the momentum to drive Glasgow forward
positively into the next century.''
Ian Livingstone, chairman of the LDA, which receives #45.6m, said his
board was a potent force and willing to continue to serve. He added:
''We are confident our track record will put us in an excellent position
to maintain the momentum of regeneration and development throughout the
enlarged Lanarkshire area.''
Dunbartonshire Enterprise chairman Alistair Nicol said of the open
tender competition: ''The board is confident it possesses the skills,
resources and local knowledge to deliver the most appropriate
initiatives for the further expansion of the Dunbartonshire economy.''
Mr Runcie added: ''It is very easy to criticise Lecs, but no-one
should under-estimate the complexity of the challenges they face in the
nineties. However, there is always room for improvement and a fresh
approach. This is as good a time as any to do so, with the advent of the
new unitary authorities.''
No challengers have emerged as yet. The adverts seeking applications
are expected to be published later this week.

IT WAS Strangelove without the jokes. ''I'm not prepared to talk about
the ethics of this matter,'' said the distinguished American woman who
had objected to the tone of a question, ''it's out of my realm.''
The matter in question, as surveyed in True Stories: Deadly
Experiments (Channel 4, Thursday), was the deliberate exposure of human
beings to hard radiation. Men, women, children; British and American;
dead and alive; all irradiated just so inquiring scientists could
establish precisely how revolting the effects of their lethal weapons
might be. But the tetchy scientist was right: ethics didn't come into
it.
What could the moral dimension have been, after all, when the patriots
of the cold war were experimenting on dead babies in order to prove that
their bomb tests were polluting the atmosphere? How did the
philosophical debate go when they were injecting unsuspecting patients
with what was acknowledged to be the most toxic substance known to man?
How Socratic can psychotics get? ''Right, chaps, after thorough attempts
to murder large numbers of citizens, many of them conveniently poor,
inarticulate and non-white, we can now confirm what we already knew:
nuclear weapons are in every respect obscene. Ergo, we build lots more
of them. Bring in the next patient . . .''
Some of it was bleakly comic. Only the stereotypically dotty
eccentrics of the British scientific establishment could, one feels,
have thought up the wheeze of feeding 21 Punjabi women radioactive
chapattis, and then telling them that the Harwell nuclear lab was a
''hospital''. Overall, however, the documentary succeeded in inducing
only nausea.
It was, perhaps for that very reason, a brilliant piece of work from
the Twenty Twenty TV production house. Painstakingly building on the
work of a lone journalist in New Mexico, it picked its way through
American records (freedom of information being closer to a reality over
there) before hacking its way through the equivalent British jungle. It
provoked anger and admiration in equal measure, an admiration that gave
way, in turn, to the kind of sadness you can't easily quench. This is
the species that, in defence of what it calls freedom, treats its own
kind like laboratory rats.
This is the species, too, that comes over all strange when
conversation strays below the waist. Witness: True Love Waits (Channel
4, Tuesday) brought us a slice of life from Nashville, Tennessee, in
which questions of sexual behaviour were shouted loud but never
answered.
The authentic expectant love mentioned in the title involves a
movement founded by Southern Baptists that aims to persuade teenagers to
promise to avoid the dirty deed until they are married. This may or may
not be a fine idea. What this richly comic piece showed, however, is
that the surest way to keep young folks' minds on sex is to go on and on
about them never doing it.
Here we had the sort of grimly jolly, fresh-faced ''counsellors'' who,
had they been working for Alcoholics Anonymous, would have sent you
screaming to the bottle. They were teaching teenagers how to dance while
avoiding one another's ''parts'' and enjoying -- somehow you could tell
-- every second of it. The scene was soaked in barely sublimated
adolescent lust.
It wasn't all a joke, though. The loonies were allowed to speak for
themselves, and some of what they said would chill you to the marrow.
One pretty, weeping girl, we discovered, couldn't come to terms with the
emotional fascism of her born-again family. She had already attempted
suicide once after having been given the choice between chastity and
''sex with Jesus''. Her devout family, dripping ''lurve'', seemed as if
they couldn't have cared less.
Predictably enough, these servants of the Lord, hormones exploding,
were seen at the film's conclusion smashing up tapes and CDs in an
effort to exorcise the twin evils of rock and roll and procreation.
Their mad laughter and blank eyes would have shamed a Satanist. For the
second time this week we ask: and they call this a species?
Still, Frasier (Channel 4, Friday) is back, and right now there is
nothing better on the box. With him returns one of the oldest questions
in the business of TV reviewing: why is that Americans, whose lack of
irony is a critical cliche, always seem to make better sit-coms than the
British? The traditions are different, for a start.
In Britain one, sometimes two, writers will slave away to produce six
shows, the televisual equivalent of a hit-and-run attack. In America
entire platoons of supremely gifted humour technicians -- ''get me a
mother-in-law gag specialist'' -- will turn out 13 and 26-week seasons
which allow a show to grow, deepen and mature.
Another difference is that Americans concentrate less on the
''situation'' to which British writers cling as though their lives
depend on it. In American comedy character is the key. As Chaplin once
noted: ''Comedy isn't a man with a funny door; it's a man being funny
with a door.''
Thus Frasier, the radio shrink with his grouchy pop, anal-retentive
brother, sassy assistant, and Mancunian home-help, has character the way
vintage champagne has character. His show pops and bubbles and rarely
goes flat. What you remember most are the gags, not the situation. These
are, perhaps significantly, mainly verbal.
Which brings us, finally, to Marty Feldman, a British rarity who
handled both sight gags and verbal funnies with equal facility. It's
Marty Resurrected -- Some of the Best of Marty Feldman (BBC2, Tuesday)
was the briefest glimpse of genius. As with last week's Hancock
celebration, it left you wanting more and realising that the BBC, for
reasons best known to itself, isn't going to play.
Jonathan Ross, due praise for once for having put the show together,
described Feldman as the ''forgotten man'' of British comedy. This isn't
strictly true. The bug-eyed one's untimely death meant he never enjoyed
the success of the Pythons -- though he came close while working in
Hollywood with Mel Brooks -- but much of this celebration seemed almost
too familiar, as though you had seen it only yesterday. Feldman now
seems like the link between Milligan and Monty, but in no sense, saved
that the damned BBC won't rerun the shows, is he a missing link.
Put it another way: watch a nine-year-old roll around on the carpet at
his first exposure to The Loneliness of the Long Distance Golfer and you
realise that there might, just might, be something to be said for the
species after all.

ALTHOUGH officially Britain has not been in recession for some time
there is still a huge amount of restructuring going on, in the public as
well as the private sector. This tends to mean one thing -- redundancy,
whether voluntary or forced.
Before deciding to take a voluntary package there are many things to
consider including the proposed payment and the state of the job market.
However, one major factor often ignored is the tax impact. In many cases
people look only at the top line and may even prepare family budgets on
the basis that the gross redundancy payment will be tax free. Although
this can be true in certain circumstances, there are a considerable
number of cases where the lump sum exceeds the tax-free threshold of
#30,000.
Under current law where a redundancy or termination payment is made as
a result of a contractual obligation between employer and employee, the
whole amount is subject to tax. This is also the case if you expect to
receive a payment on termination of employment and your employer has an
established policy of making this type of payment. In practice though,
if it can be shown the redundancy is genuine and not part of a tax
avoidance scheme, the first #30,000 can be tax free.
A redundancy will be considered genuine if:
* Payments are made only on account of redundancy as defined in the
Employment Protection Act of 1978.
* You have been in continuous service with your employer for at least
two years.
* The payments are not made to certain selected employees only.
* The payments are not excessively large in relation to your previous
earnings and length of service.
An employer who may not be certain whether his or her proposed
''redundancy scheme'' will be regarded as genuine, can get advance
clearance from the Inland Revenue.
If you receive a genuine redundancy or non-contractual termination
payment of less than #30,000, your employer is authorised to pay this
free of tax. In addition, where the payment meets the above criteria
there should be no national insurance liability for either of you. This
is important as in normal circumstances your employer could have a 10%
liability on the total payment.
Where the payment is more than #30,000, your employer must apply PAYE
on the excess. In this case, it is almost certain part or all of the
payment will be subject to a 40% tax withholding.
It can be much more effective to make the termination payment after
your employment ceases. Your employer can issue a P45 form when you stop
work so the termination payment is not included on the form as taxable
earnings. On the following day or at some later date the termination
payment can be made and he or she is only required to deduct basic tax
rate, at 25%, on the excess over #30,000.
By making the payment this way, higher rate tax is not avoided.
However, it can provide you with a cash flow advantage as you are not
required to pay the higher rate until you've submitted your next
year-end tax return and the Inland Revenue has made an assessment. In
the meantime, you could invest the lump sum in, for example, an interest
bearing deposit account and at least profit on the tax which would
otherwise have gone to the Treasury.
Similarly, if you have the use of an asset such as a company car and
this is transferred to you on leaving, it will be treated as a benefit
in kind and will not be taxed under PAYE. You will be assessed for tax
after the year-end, on the market value of the asset at the time it was
transferred. This will again give a cash flow advantage by delaying the
payment of tax.
In some circumstances, as part of the termination agreement your
employer can make a special contribution to an Inland Revenue approved
retirement benefits scheme. This should not be taxable on you provided
the benefits are within the limits and in the form prescribed by the
rules of the scheme.
You should bear in mind, however, that in many cases such a
contribution will merely defer tax until an annuity, or pension, is
taken from the scheme. Great care must be taken in considering the
sacrifice of a cash sum for the provision of future retirement benefits.
In the case of cessation of or retirement from employment, the Revenue
will not tax long-service awards provided your service is not less than
20 years, you have not received a similar award within the past 10 years
and the cost to your employer of the article purchased does not exceed
#20 per year of service.
Since the circumstances under which termination payments are made are
often stressful and potentially acrimonious for both parties, it is easy
to overlook basic tax planning. But this can be dangerous, leading to
significant additional costs. It is vital both of you are aware of the
potential tax pitfalls before structuring a termination package and,
despite the understandable friction, work together to ensure a minimal
tax charge.
Don't forget that the receipt of a redundancy package does not prevent
you working for someone else. Indeed, many employers are now offering
job seeking assistance as part of the package. With any luck you could
look back on this difficult experience with some positive thoughts.

If you want to hire a vintage typewriter or a load of fifties
furniture, Alex Gourlay's new firm Propworks can help. But as John
Buchanan discovers, the ex-BBC head of design is not resting on his
laurels -- his latest project could give a major boost to Scotland's
film industry
THE casual passerby could be forgiven for thinking they had wandered
into a junk shop the first time they entered Alex Gourlay's Aladdin's
cave. Shelves are piled high with old crockery; typewriters overtaken by
the computer and word processing sit apparently gathering dust, and
there are faded magazines which even doctors' surgeries would have
thrown out years ago.
But to Gourlay, and Scotland's television and theatre industry, the
seemingly worthless bits and bobs are what turn a piece of drama into
virtual reality. Gourlay and his partner Billy Mitchell are the proud
new owners of BBC Scotland's props. Two months ago the two former BBC
staff established Propworks and purchased, for an undisclosed sum, the
BBC's entire stock of props built up over many years.
Both were familiar with their purchases as they had worked with them
for many years, Gourlay eventually as head of design at the BBC's
Scottish headquarters in Queen Margaret Drive, Glasgow, and Mitchell as
head of scenic servicing.
Gourlay could easily have imagined he was going to be a one company
man, having worked his way up through the ranks of the Beeb, including a
spell in London, over a period of 28 years. ''The introduction of
producers' choice was the beginning of the end,'' he explains. ''We had
to compete with outside contractors but had to cope with BBC overheads
so there was no way we could win.''
Two years ago there were in-house BBC props and design departments in
Belfast, Manchester, Bristol, Glasgow and Birmingham, now only
Birmingham is managing to hold on. ''Less than four years ago, the
London scenic services department employed 3000 but this is now down to
300. I had 100 in Glasgow alone dealing with scenic design, make-up and
graphics.''
He shrugs and grins at the memory. ''That is all in the past. When we
heard that the BBC was planning to dispose of this place we decided to
make an offer, and thankfully were successful.''
Propworks now owns all the former props, scenery and location
servicing equipment such as rain effects and smoke machinery. ''So far
so good,'' he says. ''We have been doing business with the BBC, STV and
some theatres.''
Although the BBC is the company's biggest customer, Scottish
Television has also used it for programmes such as Taggart and Dr
Finlay. When the Rev IM Jolly entertains viewers this Hogmanay he will
also be surrounded by articles from Propworks' vast collection of
bric-a-brac, but Gourlay is not about to spoil the festive surprise by
revealing exactly what is being used.
The new company has also provided props for films presently in
production such as Trainspotting and Easterhouse. ''We supply a wide
range of customers, from major film companies right down to local school
plays and also television commercials.''
Gourlay and his staff of two are still in the process of finding out
exactly what they own -- which does not seem surprising when you walk
down the aisles stuffed with bedding, then candlesticks, followed by
gramophones and television sets whose designs you had forgotten ever
existed. Tucked away in a corner are gas cookers straight out of the
fifties, which he assures me are still in working order, and on the
shelves above them there are biscuit tins that your granny once kept her
buttons in.
''We only stock old items, the television companies can go out and
obtain modern goods in the shops. We are still adding to our stock, and
people phone us up offering the strangest things.''
How does he set a price for the props? ''It is all done based on
replacement value. For the first week we will ask for 10% of this,
dropping to just over 7% for subsequent weeks.'' If a customer breaks
the goods they are charged the full replacement value. The minimum hire
charge is #10, and everything in the giant cavern-like shed is for hire,
even the seats we are sitting on.
Gourlay has not only been busy with Propworks since he left the BBC.
He has also formed a separate company, Soundstage (Scotland) Ltd, to
build the country's largest indoor studio only yards away from
Propwork's premises. Workmen are currently putting noise-proof cladding
round the walls of the former factory. ''It is vital that no sound from
outside gets into the studio during filming,'' he explains.
The idea for the #250,000 studio complex stemmed from his memories of
the time the BBC spent trying to find premises to use as temporary
studios. ''When completed it will be suitable for feature films and
television productions,'' he says, indicating the special sound
insulation on the roof and the power supply designed to cope with the
heavy demands of a working studio. Giant doors are being installed to
allow vans carrying bulky scenery and lighting equipment direct access
to the studio floor.
Gourlay believes that what is taking shape in the industrial estate
just a hundred yards from Glasgow's busy Maryhill Road could be a
catalyst for the creation of a mini film industry complex, which could
prove very useful in attracting movie makers to Scotland. ''We haven't
had in Scotland what in the industry is known as a four-wall facility,
and film companies have had to search for disused factories or
warehouses.''
He points out that scenery manufacturer City Productions has premises
beside the new studio, and that Glasgow Sculpture Studios is on the same
industrial estate. Soundstage (Scotland) hopes to have the 10,000 sq ft
studio available from September, and he has already had enquiries about
its availability.
The existence of such an indoor facility will no doubt make it easier
in future for bodies such as Scottish Screen Locations to bring feature
film makers to Scotland.
Gourlay is confident that Soundstage (Scotland) will be the base for
many film makers attracted to Scotland. And, since film making is a
labour intensive industry, this should prove an economic stimulus for
Maryhill, possibly attracting other related companies to the area to be
on the film producers' doorstep.
Future generations of film goers could become accustomed to seeing the
words ''Maryhill, Glasgow'' appearing at the foot of their screens, just
as past generations grew used to the names Elstree and Pinewood.
Maryhill Road could one day be Scotland's Sunset Boulevard.

MANY a time I've put pen to paper in criticism of John Macleod's
nonsense, but others have usually done so more eloquently by the time I
got my thoughts together which -- on the evidence of his latest ranting
(In a pool of silence all time stops, June 4) -- is a lot more than he
can do.
Either he has got a connection to some seriously good hash or the
psilocybe in the Northern Isles have sprouted really early this year due
to the recent fine weather.
Someone at The Herald should protect the public by exercising
restraint on such delirium. If symptoms of such delirium are needed, the
man's own words diagnose the problem: ''My mind was far, far away,
wandering . . . It was not only absurd, it was incomprehensible. I
needed help.''
Enough said and enough from John Macleod. No more, please.

which carried out the procedure said the surrogacy was ideal because the

PROFESSOR Ross Harper could not be blamed for asking himself whose law
firm is it anyway with the promotion of Gerard Bonnar to the position of
associate.
Gerard, who runs the Bellshill end of Ross Harper and Murphy, is the
son of Brian Bonnar who is deputy senior partner of the legal firm and
runs the East Kilbride operation.
Another member of the Bonnar clan is Kevin Hughes, a partner based at
Hamilton who married Gerard's sister Suzanne in 1990 after joining the
firm.
Brian Bonnar told Business Diary: ''Gerard worked with me at East
Kilbride during his vacations while he was a student but he joined
Bellshill in September 1994.''
Ross Harper may be concerned to know that Brian has another son
Damian, aged 19, who is presently studying law at Strathclyde
University.
No-one is taking any bets on where he might end up once he has
completed his studies, but if I was Ross Harper I would make sure that
control of the firm was not determined on a show of hands.
Let's be franc about lunch
MOST financiers are aware that, despite claims by our politicians of a
UK recovery against our economic rivals, sterling continues to devalue
in relation many other European currencies.
Grant Baird, executive director of Scottish Financial Enterprise,
takes a very practical view of this slide as he frequently pops back to
Brussels to see his wife Glynne who continues to work there as a head
mistress.
On a recent visit the pair were deciding after a pleasant lunch who
would pay the bill, and he won the day when he told her: ''You still get
paid in Belgian francs so you can pick up the tab.''
He explains the economics of this decision very simply: ''When I went
over to Belgium to take charge of the Scotland Europa office four years
ago you received around 60 Belgian francs to the pound, compared to the
present tourist exchange rate of 43.''
Now secretary of the Association of European Regional Finance Centres,
which includes continental regions such as Flanders, Hamburg and
Bordeaux, he denies that his refusal to pay the lunch bill was
ungentlemanly conduct, insisting that it was just good economics.
Charity keeps on truckin'
SCOTTISH International Relief's articulated lorry makes an average of
three trips every two months to Bosnia carrying foodstuffs, clothing and
much needed medical supplies. In between times the charity's workers are
busy collecting more material to send to the stricken country, but the
38-tonne artic is idle.
Now Scottish International Relief has decided to put these fallow
periods to good use by offering to hire it out along with its driver to
any organisation which could use it.
The cash raised from the hires will go towards buying additional
suppies for Bosnia. If you are interested give Magnus MacFarlane-Barrow
a call on 01838 200 622.
Story is right Royal adventure
THE Diary of John Campbell is the stuff dreams are of made of. Who
could imagine it? Bankers going off bearing a white flag to fetch you
money.
It has happened. John Campbell, cashier of the Royal Bank of Scotland,
describes how he with other members of the bank displayed a white flag
as they made their way to Edinburgh Castle to collect gold so that they
could pay some demanding customers.
Mind you, it all happened in 1745, and the customers were Bonnie
Prince Charlie and his Highland army who were threatening to burn down
the bank and the homes of the directors if their notes were not
exchanged for gold.
Campbell describes in the newly published booklet how on Thursday,
October 3, 1745 he ''hoisted my white flag and ushered the rest of the
gentlemen saluting the centinells with it as we past, and as we
approached the Castle gate waved it often. . .''
I wonder if it was such a scene that inspired the composer of Will Ye
No Come Back Again, for there are a few bank customers out there who
would not mind having Bonnie Prince Charlie's pull.
Copies of the 72-page booklet are being donated to schools, libraries
and universities to mark the 250th anniversary of the 1745 Jacobite
rebellion.
Herald is glad to be of help
SOME time ago I told you that Sanmex, the Rutherglen-based toiletries
and household cleaners company, had the prospect of landing an export
order thanks to the Herald business section.
Well, the deal has now come up trumps and Sanmex has recieved an
initial order worth #30,000 for its products, with the possibility of
this growing to #500,000.
The chain of events leading up to the order began when Ray Cheung,
owner of the Purple Palace Restaurant in Uddingston, read about the
company in our business section and contacted his brother who is an
agent in Hong Kong. His brother flew to Scotland, and the deal has now
been concluded. All we can say is happy to be of service.
Desperate for a spot of luck
FED up with being a loser, David Hill of CA Industrial Finance is
threatening to organise a corporate train spotting day at Motherwell
Station next year in place of this year's golf outing on Islay.
Hill, it appears, laid a wager with Hugh Wallace of Arnold Clark that
he would win the prize for his own corporate day out. He didn't. In a
bid to overcome his disappointment on the golf course he had a game of
snooker at the Machrie Hotel before catching the plane back to Glasgow,
and played miserably losing yet another bet.
He then challenged all comers to a game on the smaller pool table, and
lost again. At the subsequent Arnold Clark golf day Hill, believing his
bad form had left him, announced to those who would listen that this was
his day. It wasn't.
He has now decided to give up active sport and taken up train
spotting. He has drawn up preliminary schedule for next year's corporate
day out at Motherwell Station. Guests, we are told, will have to bring
their own pencils and sharpeners, but Arnold Clark needn't bother as he
will not be invited, having led his team to victory in his own golf
tournament.

GENERAL Accident is introducing a ''stone-built'' buildings insurance
policy, in recognition of the fact that the owners of Scotland's 380,000
traditional stone-built properties make fewer claims. Savings of up to
20% may be possible.
BANK of Scotland has lowered interest rates on its car loan until the
end of September. Customers can expect to pay 13.3% APR, non-customers
15.1%. Applicants are promised a decision in principle in 30 minutes.
The bank has also revised its fixed-term mortgage rates, with two-year
fixes from 6.99% to 8.45%, depending on loan to value ratio, five years
from 8.3% to 8.99% and 10 years at 8.85%.
SCOTTISH Building Society is offering discounts and cashback up to 5%
for home loans of up to 90% of valuation. The saving can be taken as a
payment holiday.
LIVERPOOL and Victoria Friendly Society has published a financial
guide for the under twenties. Copies can be obtained free by calling
0800 550050.
GUINNESS Flight is launching a corporate bond PEP with redemption and
running yields of 7.2% and 7.4% respectively. It will have an initial
charge of 2% with no withdrawal penalties after three years, and the
annual management fee of 1.25% will be charged to income. Minimum
investment is #1000.
NATIONAL Provident Life is introducing an income drawdown pension
plan. The plan gives holders the choice of a regular retirement income
from the fund, which remains invested, until the age of 75, or
converting it at any time to an annuity.

* I am irritated by my building insurance renewal note and the way
that the sum insured goes up by the rate of inflation every year
irrespective of what is really happening to building costs or property
valuations.
I queried this with the company and was told that unless I paid the
full revised premium any future claims I made would be scaled back pro
rata. This seems to be unfair. What is your view on this situation?
* Automatic indexation is bound to be a hit or miss form of ensuring a
house is adequately insured. In recent years it has worked in insurers'
favour given the deep recession in the building industry and weak
property prices.
It is, of course, quite possible that a property can be more expensive
to rebuild than its current market value, although one would expect that
over a long enough timescale the two would not be too far out of line.
In many cases, though, the rebuilding cost would be less than the
value because the latter includes the value of the site and connections
to services, and this will not be destroyed by fire.
Various professional bodies such as the Association of British
Insurers produce leaflets to enable people to work out their rebuilding
costs, but these are inevitably approximate and may not be accepted by
the insurer.
However, insurers would be very unlikely to quibble with a rebuilding
cost which had been assessed by a professional surveyor, and it may be
worth your while to obtain this to fix a base value once and for all for
the cover required, from which it can be indexed in future years.

* I have only just found out from the annual report of a unit trust I
hold that the manager of the fund changed a year ago. I bought the fund
on the basis of its past performance. (Yes, I know that should not be
used as an indicator to the future). But now I don't know if this
performance can continue with a new manager. How can I find out about
changes in managers, and should not the unit trust company tell unit
holders when the manager changes?
* It would be a very good idea if unit trust companies did this, but
the industry is unlikely to adopt such a practice because of the rapid
turnover of managers. It would not want to bring the attention of unit
holders to the departure of a top performing manager, though -- as
happened in your case -- a new appointment is often mentioned in the
bi-yearly communication with holders.
The industry maintains the best indicator of long-term achievement is
the overall performance across the range of the management company's
funds. In other words, the pedigree is more important than the
individual manager.
For some funds the committee approach is used, or least the
geographical or sector breakdown is so decided. But however the
parameters are set, invariably the selection of individual stocks is in
the hands of single managers, who appear to be frequent job changers.
Recent figures show more than half have been running their present fund
for under three years and a fifth for under a year.
It is not easy to find out about changes when they occur, though
investing through one of the leading unit trust brokers is a good idea
because they keep a close eye on what is happening in the main unit
trust groups. Another useful source is the trade press for the industry.
* I am due to retire at age 64 in August. I have had a note from my
company saying that on estimated figures I should receive a pension of
#9770 per annum or a tax-free cash sum of #23,200 plus a residual
pension of #7330. The spouse's pension with either option is #4885.
Which should I take?
* The usual advice is to take the lump sum because this leaves you
with more flexibility, is more tax efficient and can enable you to leave
capital to heirs if you want to do so. But it depends on personal
circumstances and on how good the pension scheme is on uprating pensions
in payment.
Initially you would be slightly better off by taking the lump sum and
investing it in an annuity. This would produce net income of about
#2300, which compares with the #2440 gross ''gap'' you have to make up
to match the full pension. When you are 65 you are likely to be only a
20% taxpayer so the difference will be small.
However, at your age taking a level annuity would not be a good idea
as it will decline in real terms. You are only safe from this through an
index-linked annuity and this would drop the annual income down to about
#1500 net. If your pension is likely to keep pace with inflation then
you are clearly better off not taking the lump sum. Another
consideration is your wife's pension on your death. You could take the
lump sum/annuity route to improve this, though at the expense of current
income.
* My wife and I have fairly sizeable estates and, although our wills
take advantage of the nil rate bands which will be available, there will
still be an inheritance tax liability on the death of the survivor. We
are, therefore, considering a with-profits life assurance policy which
will be written in trust for our son and will mature on the death of the
second parent. We will pay the annual premiums which I know may have
some effect on the tax situation, but are there any other factors we
should take into account at this stage?
* By writing the policy in trust for your son it will not form part of
either your or your wife's estate. Each premium you pay is classed as a
gift for inheritance tax purposes and, to the extent not covered by
exemptions, each of the premiums paid within seven years of death will
be aggregated and will use up part of the nil rate bands.
Hopefully exemptions will cover most of the premiums. The obvious one
is the annual #3000 exemption, but if you use this already you should
consider the normal expenditure out of income exemption. A claim for
this to apply will need to be made by your executors so you should try
to document your income and expenditure to demonstrate you have
sufficient surplus income out of which to meet the premiums each year
without affecting your standard of living. Remember if your wife pays a
share of the premiums her exemptions could be brought into play as well.
* I shall be retiring in a few months at the age of 65 with a pension
of around #20,000 after taking a lump sum of a little over #50,000. We
have no mortgage or other debts and over the last 15 years since our
family left home we have been able to build up a substantial portfolio
of investments. In all we have nearly #60,000 of investment trust shares
plus about #35,000 of shares in major companies. The income from these
after tax is not much more than #2000 a year.
This does not seem much of a return as I consider what I should do
with my lump sum. We have made good gains out of our existing
investments, but I wonder if they are suitable for people looking for
extra income to enjoy their retirememt. I would appreciate your advice
on how to increase our income without risking capital.
* You are certainly receiving a relatively low dividend return from
your existing investments. It cannot be any more than 3% gross, which is
well below the market average for equities. This may be because you are
heavily invested in the shares of investment trust companies, which very
often provide low dividend returns. This is in part due to the fact that
many have substantial holdings overseas, where equity returns are less
than in the UK. You have not supplied us with details of your other
equity investments, but it seems likely that these too have below
average returns.
The dividend return on equities is currently around 4%. In all you
have funds of around #145,000 when your lump sum is aggregated with your
existing portfolio. Without taking any risks you should be able to
obtain an income of around #5800 gross or #4640 net.
To get such a return you would have to reduce your exposure to
investment trusts and to build up a broadly based portfolio of blue
chips. Your best course would be to seek the advice of a good
stockbroker on reorganising and expanding your investments. This may
take time as you will not want to pay unnecessary capital gains tax. If
your investments are held in joint names it will be easier to live
within the capital gains tax exemption limits. If your wife does not
have an income of her own, other than the state pension, she ought to be
able to reclaim some of the tax on her share of the dividend income.
So far you do not seem to have given any consideration to investing in
personal equity plans. Given the extent of the funds at your disposal we
think you ought to be doing so. But you must make sure the management
charges do not eat up the tax savings, and that they are sound
investments in their own right.
If our suggestions do not increase your income sufficiently for your
purposes, you might consider investing a proportion of your funds in
gilts, where returns are currently around 8.5%, more than double what
can be obtained from equities. Again a stockbroker is the best person to
advise you on this aspect of investment.

HERE in Devon we are faced with what we are told are the highest water
costs in the country. The explanation for this is that we have to pay
large amounts to keep our beaches up to European standards for the
benefit of visitors as well as ourselves.
Last week I was on holiday in Glasgow (my home town) and spent a day
at Helensburgh. The shoreline there is a disgrace. Nowhere here in
South-west England would you find litter and filth such as lay thickly
along the foreshore.
As long as one kept one's eyes on the glory of the hills and the firth
all was well. But look at sea-level and the first desire is to escape as
fast as possible. Can something be done about it?

DEATHS from China's summer floods surged toward 1200 today with
devastation in 10 provinces, crops ruined, and economic losses put at
#2933m.
As of Tuesday, 1179 people had been killed and 26,115 injured in
central Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces, Fujian and Zhejiang
in the south-east, Guangdong and Guangxi in the south, and Sichuan and
Guizhou in the south-west.
One hundred million people, or one-twelfth of the population, have
suffered in floods caused by torrential rains that have, as they do most
every year, lashed the country since May.
Floods stranded 5.6 million people, and 1.3 million have been
relocated by rescue workers.
About 900,000 homes have been destroyed and nearly four million
damaged, said the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
Some 16 million acres of farmland have been hit, with 2.7 million
acres of crops destroyed.
An initial estimate of direct economic losses was put at #2933m.
Hunan province, birthplace of the late chairman Mao Tsetung, has been
hardest hit by the floods, with 540 people killed and 14,582 injured.
Three million Hunanese have been stranded by floods, about 300,000 of
whom were trapped for up to 50 hours, it said. One million have been
rescued.
Millions of soldiers have been mobilised to fight the floods, rescuing
stranded people on boats and repairing dikes with sandbags.
Each year, spring and summer rains bring calamity to tens of millions
of people in the relatively flat watershed of the mighty Yangtze River
and its many tributaries.
Villagers are forced into shantytowns thrown up along river banks and
city perimeters, where unsanitary conditions and water-borne diseases
kill many refugees.
This year meteorologists have noticed alarming new weather patterns
that could spell greater disaster, with some predicting the worst
inundation of this century.
Global warming is melting the snows on west China's vast Tibet-Qinghai
Plateau, the source of the Yangtze. This has sharply elevated water
levels in rivers and lakes along the Yangtze's central and lower
reaches, threatening dikes that have for centuries protected farmers and
their crops.--Reuter.

Ian McConnell examines the issue of abolishing inheritance and capital
gains taxes
THE abolition of capital gains and inheritance taxes -- which were
marked for extinction this week by Prime Minister John Major -- would
cost the Treasury more than a penny cut in the basic rate of income tax.
Viewed by some, perhaps not altogether fairly, as taxes on the
wealthy, their abolition would not be a particularly cost-effective
means of purchasing the political capital necessary to boost the Tories'
standing in the polls.
Inheritance tax is expected to raise some #1500m in the current fiscal
year to April 5, with capital gains tax expected to swell the Treasury's
coffers by #900m.
The two threatened taxes therefore yield little in comparison with
income tax, worth about #68.9 billion annually, Customs and Excise
duties and value added tax, yielding about #79.4 billion, and
corporation tax, expected to bring in #26.1 billion this year.
But the #2400m they raise is extremely valuable at the margin and
compares with a cost of only #2000m for taking a penny off the income
tax rate.
Tax professionals and economists do not, therefore, expect capital
gains tax and inheritance tax to disappear from the statute book in the
near future.
Major's statement to party workers and MPs on Thursday night, while
far and away the strongest indication to date that he will remove
capital taxes which he considers a drag on enterprise, was vague in
terms of time-scale.
He said: ''It should be set down now, as a clear aim and objective of
any Government I lead, that I wish to see an end to inheritance tax and
an end to capital gains tax. I make no promises when we can (abolish
them), but I do set it as an objective.''
Abolition of the taxes would have some economic advantage. Unlike a
cut in income tax, it would be unlikely to prompt an inflationary surge
in consumer confidence and High Street spending.
And the cost of dispensing with the two taxes need not be #2400m. Some
of the gains currently caught by capital gains tax could instead be
taxed as income. Other capital gains arising out of short-term,
speculative dealings could also be caught by income tax.
The Government could act to reduce the ultimate one-off cost of
disposing of inheritance tax -- which was introduced as capital transfer
tax by Labour Chancellor Denis Healey in 1976, and amended to its
present form by Conservative Chancellor Nigel Lawson in 1986 -- and
capital gains tax, the brainchild of Labour Chancellor James Callaghan
in 1965.
The Government could substantially raise the #6000 annual exemption
for capital gains tax, which is payable at the marginal rate of income
tax, and the #154,000 threshold for inheritance tax, above which tax is
payable at 40%.
A relatively modest house, would take an estate close to or above the
current #154,000 inheritance tax threshold, even before savings and
other investments were taken into account.
Capital gains tax is largely paid on real gains, with indexation of
the original purchase price allowed from 1982. Ironically enough, the
middle-classes are probably less able to defend themselves from
inheritance tax than the very well-off.
Transfers between spouses are exempt. The difficulty arises in passing
wealth on to the next generation. It is easy enough to plot against
inheritance tax providing you are reasonably confident about living at
least another seven years, satisfied you are going to die before your
heirs, and are sufficiently rich to be able to pass on a fair proportion
of your wealth, but still retain enough to see you comfortably through
your twilight years.

<TEXT>
TAPES made by listening devices show that followers of cult leader
David Koresh poured out the fuel that started a conflagration in their
Waco, Texas compound after US agents moved to end a two-month armed
siege.
Federal agents used a tank to throw tear gas into the compound in the
hope of forcing Koresh and his Branch Davidians out of the compound, but
flames engulfed the buildings.
Koresh and about 80 of his followers, including at least 18 Britons
and nine Australians, died in the confrontation as the compound burned
to the ground.
Agents have maintained the cult members set the fire themselves, but
militia groups claim the FBI burned the building to the ground to get
rid of evidence that showed they initiated gunfire at the start of the
stand-off in February.
Tapes of the last minutes in the compound were obtained by lawyer Joe
Turner, who represents one of the cult members who survived the raid.
Excerpts were aired on television.
''They're coming in. They're coming in,'' a woman's voice cries out
inside the compound. ''They're tearing the building down.''
''Have you poured it yet?'' another voice asks.
''We want the fuel,'' a third voice says.
''You got to get the fuel ready,'' says another.
''I already poured it. I already poured it,'' comes the reply.
The voices were monitored by listening devices smuggled inside in milk
shipments.
Former FBI agent Jeffrey Jamar, who oversaw Federal Bureau of
Investigation operations at Waco, said he considered the inside tapes
''absolutely overwhelming evidence'' that Koresh ordered his followers
to set the building ablaze once the FBI tried to end the siege.--Reuter.

ONE of the less endearing aspects of the Scots character is the
tendency to pour scorn on our elected representatives and those selected
for high office. It was certainly in evidence in response to the new
names which emerged this week as a result of the Government reshuffle,
but it is just as evident when it comes to the leaders of the Labour
Party at local government level, despite their greater electoral
popularity in Scotland.
A good example of this occurred when Pat Lally promoted the Glasgow
Royal Concert Hall project and it was dubbed ''Lally's Pally''. Not
terribly unkind, but such reactions are more common than admiration or
praise. When the mural in the said hall aroused fairly universal
revulsion and Councillor Lally expunged it, he was set upon by an angry
mob of trendies. In retrospect his decisions in both matters have
benefited the city and stand as symbols of positive leadership.
Which brings me to two events involving civic pride in Glasgow. The
first is the recent ''mosquing'' of the council and the second is the
development planned on the Clyde's ''left bank'', west of the Kingston
Bridge. On the first it would be easy to take the indignant, knocking
stance which is the knee-jerk reaction of so many to those in public
life. On the other hand we should perhaps ask if this gesture was an
enlightened contribution to better community relations. Or was it a way
of snubbing the council chaplain, the minister of Glasgow Cathedral (who
is not known for his enthusiasm for socialism, or Catholicism, unlike
some of the councillors who made the decision)?
Was it a step towards the recognition of a multiplicity of faiths (and
none) laying claim to the blessing ceremony for the newly elected local
government for Glasgow? We will never know the motives which carried the
day, nor can I comment on the content of the service since I was not
present, but I fear that it was a mistake. Not because Muslim prayers
were said, but because of what it symbolised.
For me, it symbolised a break with the historic site upon which
Glasgow was founded. The cathedral was founded by a pope, and is now
ministered to by a presbyterian. But it is a house of prayer for all
nations. In its shadow is the new St Mungo museum which embodies a
multi-faith perspective. Its fabric is owned and sustained by the state.
It was, and is, ideal for such a service, as the Government recognised
when it held the Gulf War thanksgiving service there.
By taking its show on the road, the council has made a significant
gesture, but it is one which reveals how little respect now remains for
the era in which Glasgow was founded and through which its prosperity
came. They have told us in no uncertain way that that era has ended.
Multi-faith, ethnic sensibilities rule. But where do they stop? Should
we not have a secular service in the concert hall for those who have no
religion? Or why not the synagogue -- and of course the other cathedral
in Clyde Street? Pandora's box has been opened and we will have to live
with the consequences.
Just along the Clyde from the mosque is the Kingston Bridge. Just to
the west lies a prime site, owned by the Post Office, which has lain
awaiting a buyer for two and half years. Ironically, just as Pacific
Quay (the GDA-owned ex-garden festival site) is set to take off as a
major development a few hundred yards downstream, the Post Office site
has acquired a buyer who is wanting to create a major development
including multi-screen cinema, restaurants, and leisure facilities.
The buyer is the Rank Organisation. However, the Post Office site may
be upstream of Pacific Quay but it is certainly not upmarket of it. Part
of the ''leisure'' turns out to be bingo -- that religion practised by
an ethnic minority who bow their heads to Mecca but don't have to face
east to do it. With bingo temples in Lorne Street and Gorbals, the south
bank looks set to become a new kind of Mecca.
Then there are the ''restaurants''. One is ''drive through'', as the
planning application states, and the other three are ''fast food''
outlets. Some restaurants! More like litter factories with junk food as
a sideline. Add to this the fact that they will be right on the river
bank adjacent to two private housing areas which are responsible for
lighting and clean-up in the area and you have a negative contribution
to community relations.
Then there is the multi-screen cinema. When have you seen a cinema
from the outside which has enhanced the street frontage? (Ironically the
only ones which did are the golden oldies which are now bingo halls.)
The prospect is of one of the city's prime sites being sated with the
kind of neon culture which is perfectly well catered for in city centre
areas. So far the bingo licence has been declined (but the applicants
have appealed) and the residents live in hope that the traffic
congestion which the scheme will bring will put an end to it. This
scheme is the kind of difficult decision which confronts our councillors
every day and which they need to decide with fairness and vision.
Our civic leaders deserve congratulations for declining that bingo
licence and for many other things. That is why I hope that the
''mosquing'' will not contribute to the process of denigration which is
so often our attitude. Those of us who were not sympathetic to that
decision could so easily ridicule it, but we should not be drawn into
the malaise of moaning. What anyone with an ounce of religion in them
should not forget is that there is a real need for our civic leaders to
be prayed for. They carry a lot of responsibility and it is better to
bless them than to curse them. Of course it helps if they remember that
it is better if the blessing does not become a source of dissension
among those giving it.

As the O J Simpson saga drifts from reality into theatre, Martin Smith
compares LA law with a basic safeguard to be found in Scottish court
practice
THREE words -- ''The people rest'' -- were music to the ears of the
vast majority of us who have been watching incredulously as the O J
Simpson trial grinds inexorably on in Los Angeles, because with the
conclusion of the prosecution case it must surely mean that there can't
be too much more to endure.
Five-and-a-half months and 58 witnesses later, the rest of the world
sits back and shakes its head at a judicial system which can allow such
a charade to take place. The numerous lawyers participating in the trial
have now taken on the status of soap opera performers, and any viewer
could be excused for coming to the conclusion that the whole saga has
passed from the realms of reality into pure theatre.
As the weeks and months go by, the American public, and anyone else in
the world who is still interested, has been regaled by disclosures such
as the fact that O J Simpson has a professional dress adviser, who
deliberates with him prior to the start of each day's proceedings as to
exactly which suit, shirt, and tie he should wear on the basis of the
type of evidence that is going to be led, and that the latest attraction
being advertised in California is an O J Simpson Cruise.
Passengers are delighted, over a period of five days, with in-depth
analysis of the trial with guest speakers including legal experts and
former members of the jury, not to mention others with fringe
involvements in the case.
That American law allows such courtroom chaos to arise is doubly
surprising because, being late developers, those who framed their system
some 300 years ago had the opportunity to survey the then existing legal
systems of the civilised world before coming up with what should surely
have been a formula that was superior to all. But it has gone sadly
wrong somewhere down the line.
The Simpson saga could get even worse because, having already lost 10
of the original 24 jurors and alternates, they are now in danger of
running out of jurors. If that happens the whole procedure would have to
go back to square one which does not even bear thinking about unless, of
course, you are one of the highly-paid legal participants in the
proceedings.
Lawyers in Scotland are, of course, aware that our system would never
allow such trial procedures to occur in this country, but the sad fact
is that many people now believe that all court proceedings are as
farcical as they are in Los Angeles.
Mind you, no system is perfect. Our American cousins may well cock a
snoot at a system which allows dangerous criminals to walk free purely
on the basis of a jury foreman mistakenly adding the word ''not'' before
the word ''guilty'' at the conclusion of a criminal trial.
They may also mock a system which decides that a newspaper should be
fined a total of #2750 because it publishes an entirely accurate story
along with a picture warning the public that a dangerous criminal,
facing an armed robbery charge at some unforeseen date in the future,
had escaped from custody and might be dangerous.
However, both of these situations have taken place in our own courts
in the past few months, and must be almost as difficult for the layman
to understand as the shenanigans in Los Angeles.
One of the main causes of the chaos in the O J Simpson case is the
American system which seems to allow the media to publish whatever it
wants when a crime is committed, even if the alleged perpetrator is
arrested a short time after the event. We can all remember the coverage
of the chase and subsequent arrest of O J Simpson. It was undoubtedly
gripping television but the price of that is now being paid.
I, myself, find it inconceivable how the court in Los Angeles could
find any jurors at all who could be regarded as uninfluenced by what
they had seen and heard at the time of the arrest. And although they
managed to find the requisite number, and what they regarded at the time
as being sufficient replacements, it now looks as if their calculations
could have been wrong.
Had Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman been visiting Glasgow last
June when they met their unfortunate demise, and if perchance O J had
also been in the city and was apprehended, our media would have been
able to print only scant details of the whole scenario. A Scottish
newspaper report might have read something along the lines of:
''Police have arrested a man following the deaths of Nicole Brown
Simpson and Ronald Goldman. Their bodies were discovered about 2am
yesterday outside a house in the West End of the city. A police
spokesman said last night: 'Following an investigation a man has been
detained as a result of which a report has been prepared and will be
sent to the Procurator Fiscal.' It is understood that a man will appear
in court tomorrow in connection with the matter.''
After the court appearance the next day, the press would be entitled
to name the accused, but their report could only quote the charges that
he faced. In fact, it is probably unlikely that they could even have
said that the man in custody was the husband of one of the victims
unless that fact was narrated in the charge. That would have been that.
There would have been no further publicity on the matter until the
trial and even at that time the media would be restricted to publishing
only fair and accurate details of what was actually said in court.
It is for that reason that in Scotland there is little or no
difficulty in empanelling an impartial jury, because it is almost
certain that the jurors will have little or no inkling of the background
to the case and will try the accused purely on the evidence put before
them.
Have the Americans learned their lesson as a result of O J Simpson? It
would not appear so if the Miami Herald is anything to go by. Between
September 1994 and January 1995 six prostitutes were strangled in an
area of Miami known as the Tamiami Trail. Last week Miami police made an
arrest which was reported under the banner headlines of ''Police --
We've got the strangler'' on the front page of the Miami Herald.
The subsequent article went on to report that the man in custody had
confessed all to the police, and even went on to provide his motive
which was allegedly anger after his wife and children had left him. The
police chief was quoted as saying: ''All the killings were the result of
feelings he had about his wife leaving him. He blamed the prostitutes
for his wife leaving.''
A family friend, when asked how the accused's wife was feeling,
responded by saying to the reporter: ''She had no idea. It's tough when
you discover your husband is a serial killer.''
We know, to our cost in Great Britain, the problems that have arisen
as a result of alleged ''confessions'' made to the police, and it is not
beyond the bounds of comprehension that the methods used by the police
in the United States to obtain confessions may well be even more
sophisticated than our own -- and look at the trouble that we have had
with our own.
One presumes that this hapless soul will shortly be standing trial,
probably for his life, in a Miami courtroom where he will be judged by
jurors who supposedly know nothing about the case -- some chance!
It is a fact that some members of my own profession in Scotland have
the reputation of spinning a trial out for perhaps a little longer than
is absolutely necessary. But you would have to go some to spend 23 weeks
on 58 witnesses only to find that the defence case is still to commence.
Perhaps our system is not all that it might be, but we can rest
assured that our courtrooms will never be witness to what we are seeing
in Los Angeles.

YOUR columns carry interesting correspondence concerning Church of
Scotland assessors and selection schools. But in her reply to Mrs
Maxwell the Rev Evie Young has not really addressed the true issue here
(July 5).
Since she is an able and articulate lady I am sure she is aware that
she has not done so. The men (and women) in mufti are well-known at
selection schools. They even wear identification badges. The real issue
is not that of identity, or concern, or pastoral counselling. The real
issue is why rejected candidates are not given specific reasons for
their rejection.
It is a matter I have sometimes pondered within my own paradoxical
experience of having been accepted some years ago as a candidate for the
full-time ministry, and later twice rejected as a candidate for the
non-stipendiary auxiliary ministry, having first adduced my reasons for
not accepting the Church's initial invitation.
No reasons were ever given for this peculiar state of affairs, only
genuinely sympathetic letters which were appreciated, but were not
really helpful.
I saw no need to consult a counsellor, for even a counsellor is
supposed not to know such answers. And it is answers that really matter,
not consolation.
Being not unfamiliar with the instruments of self-assessment, it may
be that I did not display sufficient vocational impetus or perhaps I
came across as too rigid and traditional in my views (and I suspect it
was the latter). But until I am told, I will never know.
But the men and women in mufti will know sure enough, for that will
have been debated at the late-night enclaves that follow such selection
schools after the departure of the candidates.
In the last group I was in only one out of eight candidates was
accepted and the others seemed of high calibre to me and after all I was
part of that group for two days and so formed some idea of worth and
value.
Personally I do not believe that church assessors are under the
perpetual guidance of the Holy Spirit. Their reasons for rejection are,
I think, much more pragmatic and subjective. And how I wish they would
just say so, for the rejection experience is often part of life's
process and need not be emotionally crippling or cause bitterness.
As a result of my own rather strange encounters what has happened is
that I have lost my respect, but not my love, for a Church that behaves
in this way; not like a selection school, but more like a secret
service.
In a day of openness and public accountability and quality assurance
and all the rest, perhaps it is time the assessors were assessed. I
wonder if some would be rejected?

A BIG thank you to William Hunter for his appreciation of Bert Hardy's
photography (July 5) -- one of the great achievements of photo
journalism which, taking in a wider audience than did Cartier-Bresson or
Paul Strand, is in quality of their company.
One would very much like to see a Hardy exhibition in Glasgow of the
1948 Gorbals Sequence certainly, but casting a wider net to bring out
the full range of his work.
The two Gorbals boys may be the most cheerfully optimistic of Hardy's
Gorbals pictures, and none the worse for that, yet Life in One Room
shows that his was no facile optimism, that he was only too aware of the
high, often unscalable wall that surrounds the underprivileged; poverty
with Hardy is never picturesque.
He came himself from a poor background, as might perhaps be surmised
from such images as an elderly man undressing in a Salvation Army
hostel, but also of the well-to-do in White's Club, Piccadilly, viewed
keenly though without rancour, or the fawning head waiter taking the
order of a privileged guest in Torquay Hotel, pitilessly observed yet
with understanding.
Covering the war in Korea with James Cameron produced one of the most
harrowing of all war pictures -- a close-up of a group of prisoners
roped together, submissive yet apprehensive of their fate (they were
shot minutes later).
Perhaps this and Torquay Hotel could be shown side by side. They tell
us so much about the world we live in.

THE decision by Strathclyde Regional Council to try to remove cannabis
paraphernalia from sale in Glasgow shops may seem a sensible step at
first glance. In fact, banning the sale of these product will result in
increased health risks for Scottish cannabis users.
The various designs of pipes sold allow users to smoke cannabis on its
own rather than mixed in joints with the dangerous and addictive drug,
tobacco. In addition, water-pipes (''bongs'') filter out the
water-soluble carcinogens contained in cannabis smoke while allowing the
fat-soluble active ingredients to pass through.
It is blinkered and thoughtless of SRC to pursue a knee-jerk reaction
when the rest of Europe is slowly moving towards a strategy of
harm-reducation.
The Cut The Grass campaign is only a snappy title concealing outdated
substance, which will have no effect on rates of cannabis usage anyway..

RESEARCHERS trying to determine if Jesse James is really buried where
he's thought to be have won a court order to exhume the grave of the
19th-century outlaw.
Engineering Animation, a company which specialises in computer
visualisation, said the project would resolve lingering questions about
the fate of the legendary bandit.
James was said to have been shot dead on April 3, 1882, in his home at
St Joseph, Missouri. Over the years some have argued that the death was
staged and that James lived out his life in anonymity.
The company said that by opening the grave, DNA tests can be made to
determine if the remains are those of James. If they are,
computer-imaging techniques can be used to determine exactly how and
where he was shot.
The company, in conjunction with George Washington University forensic
scientist James Starrs, has previously investigated the 1953 death of
CIA scientist Frank Olson, who died while being given LSD without his
knowledge.--Reuter.

THE violence and destruction perpetrated in the name of justice in the
wake of the release of Lee Clegg serves to underline the true nature of
the process in which Sinn Fein is engaged.
We have now been treated to the spectacle of those Sinn Fein leaders
whose presence has graced inward-investment conferences condone and
orchestrate the chaos which has so often militated against the economic
development of some of the most deprived parts of Northern Ireland.
Sinn Fein would have the rest of us sit down with its leaders on the
same basis as we would with those of a democratic political party while
its military wing maintains the weapons of coercion which are the very
antithesis of democracy.
The Republican movement which is calling for the early release of
prisoners at one and the same time is seen to oppose the decision of the
Secretary of State to accept the recommendation of the life sentence
review board in the case of Lee Clegg.
It is clearly in the interest of the whole community in Northern
Ireland that the machinery of the criminal justice system is seen to
operate equitably. The whole point of the existence of this machinery is
to avoid the possibility of nakedly political decision-taking which must
be to the detriment of public confidence.
None of us has the benefit of the information upon which the board
made its recommendation and it cannot be in the interests of anyone for
public figures to be commenting publicly on individual cases.
Were the controversy engendered by Sinn Fein in the Clegg case to be
replicated across the community for each prisoner to be considered for
early release or home leave, all prisoners would be likely to forfeit
the opportunity which may otherwise exist to be reintegrated into the
community.
There will be few who are unable to see beyond the cynicism of Sinn
Fein on every issue in which it seeks to engage public opinion.
Ulster Unionists have long recognised the fundamentally reactionary
nature of Sinn Fein which clearly has more interest in punishment
beatings and mob rule than in justice and the rule of law, more interest
in confrontation than n conciliation, and more interest in posturing
than in political development.
It is my own hope that those who have been most vulnerable to
manipulation by Sinn Fein in the past will be delivered from its
machinations in the future. The further exposure of Sinn Fein's lack of
commitment to the democratic process can only be to the benefit of all
the people of Northern Ireland.

FROM what you say in your editorial comments (July 4) it is clear that
were you based in Northern Ireland you would clearly represent the views
of the majority who, taking the events of more recent centuries as their
bench-marks, argue for British rule.
Perhaps you would want it that way. As a regular reader of Herald
leader columns, I find this one more selective and less factual than
usual.
First you state that had Lee Clegg had been a private individual as
opposed to being a soldier he would not have been charged with murder.
Perhaps this is true but I cannot help asking myself how long would
private individuals spend in prison if guilty of firing four bullets
into a car killing a passenger in the process.
Regardless of the charge, they would spend more than four years in
imprisonment. Of course, private individuals would not have the military
and Conservative circles, as you so trustingly put it, ''campaigning''
for them.
Secondly you opine that Irish Premier John Bruton is wrong to argue
that the cases of convicted terrorists be looked at in a similar light.
I would argue that you should take a leaf out of Nelson Mandela's book
and realise that all sides have genuinely to put the past behind them if
peace is to be secured.
You may take the predictable view that South Africa is different --
and I agree that until recently on a minority had recourse to the
ballot-box there -- but if Mandela can wipe the slate clean with
convicted racist killers then there can be a universal amnesty in
Ireland.
Surely such a radical step would be worthwhile if it could help
permanently to put an end to innocent Catholics and Protestants being
murdered, teenagers being knee-capped, and soldiers falsifying evidence.
In the interim uneasy peace traditional allegiances prevail and
colours are still firmly nailed to the mast.

Sir William Fraser warns that more money must be committed to higher
education. Barclay McBain assesses the principal's argument for
investment
A COUPLE of years after Sir William Fraser became Principal of Glasgow
University in 1988, two academics were discussing the impact the former
senior civil servant had on Gilmorehill, and the way it went about its
business.
On the train journey from Edinburgh to Glasgow one of them told a
humorous, but instructive, story about the way the former Permanent
Under Secretary of State at the Scottish Office was perceived by his
academics and his old bureaucrat colleagues.
She recounted: ''If you listen to some of the old guard at the
university they will tell you that he's a typical civil servant. Speak
to the civil servants and they say, 'Oh, he's gone native.'''
Well, there can be little doubt that, based on his pronouncements on
higher education, Sir William has indeed gone native. He has certainly
used the licence which comes with being freed from the civil service
code of silence to air his views about issues in higher education.
But it would be wrong simply to conclude that Sir William's public
statements are about knocking the Government. Like just about everyone
in the sector, he recognises that neither major political party is
committed to putting more money into higher education.
Sir William is a graduate of Glasgow University, is proud of its
traditions, and has been driven by a desire to further its reputation as
a community of scholars, distinguished by its teaching and research.
When he speaks out it is with the interests of the university and its
staff and students at heart.
He has not been slow to speak out when Government policies have not
chimed with these aims, as has frequently been the case in recent times.
At Glasgow University, Scotland's biggest in terms of student numbers,
there are two public platforms for the principal to ventilate issues:
the general council, the bi-annual meeting which is open to all
graduates and staff, and graduation ceremonies. In reality, graduation
ceremonies are the main forum for the public airing of views.
Sir William will address three more ceremonies before he formally
retires in September. Graduation ceremonies have, in his view, four
purposes: to congratulate graduates; thank their nearest and dearest for
their support; charge graduates (''You will be relieved to know that
this is not another demand for the instant payment of money,'' the
principal tells them) to bring credit upon the university; and make
observations about an issue of the day.
Speaking after addressing an arts graduation yesterday, Sir William
said that in his time he had deliberately restricted himself ''to issues
concerned with higher education because I do not want to be a talking
head pontificating on issues generally.''
Yesterday he returned to an old theme, but one which is at least just
as relevant as it was when he first confronted it, resources for higher
education. He said: ''In this country universities like this one occupy
a special place as centres of research and advanced teaching, generators
of economic activity, earners of foreign exchange . . . they provide a
cultural focus. They employ, and give an appropriate environment to,
many of the best brains in the country.
''And in Scotland the universities are particularly significant,
perhaps because we have a traditional respect for what they are and what
they can provide.''
Would it matter if universities, particularly centuries-old ones like
Glasgow, were to go downmarket, he wondered. It was of course a
rhetorical question, and he provided the inevitable answer: ''If we go
on as we are we will inevitably be driven downmarket.
''As student numbers go up and income per student goes down we can, of
course, take measures to relieve teaching loads, to use more and more
information technology for research as well as teaching, we can use more
multiple choice questions in our examinations . . . But this is a
university and not a correspondence college.''
The principal went on: ''Unless the reputation of the place . . . is
maintained we will slide further and further down the slope.'' The
argument was no longer about whether the state should meet the cost of
first-class higher education. Everyone knew it would not.
''At last people inside and outside the universities are beginning to
realise that if standards are not to slip students in this country will
have to do what students all over the rest of the world are doing,
namely contribute a share of the cost of their education. It is either
down payment or downward slide,'' Sir William said in a sound-bite
worthy of a politician.
But the point he was making was far from glib: ''The Government can
decree that the country's universities will provide mass higher
education, or it can decree that there shall be no fall in the quality
of higher education. What it cannot have is both quality and mass higher
education without a greater flow of funds, not necessarily from the
taxpayer into the universities.''
Sir William explained later that any system which involved students
contributing to the cost of their education should be means-tested.
''There is a good deal of validity in the charge at the moment that
higher education is quite a substantial subsidy to the middle classes.
''I am not suggesting that we move simply to the Australian system
involving students paying 20% of the cost. There has to be some
arrangement, for those who would not be able to come because they did
not have the resources or the parental back-up, to be assisted in some
way. The initiative would have to come from the Government.
''It cannot be beyond the wit of man to devise a system whereby
universities get more income to maintain quality and at the same time
avoid disadvantaging those with the motivation but without the
resources,'' he said.
In yesterday's address Sir William touched on the financial prospects
for universities up to 1999, details of which they were expected to give
the Scottish Higher Education funding council. They were deeply
disturbing, he said. Later, he expanded: ''There will be not much of an
increase in student numbers, a reduction in what we get per student head
from the funding council, and meantime we have a backlog of maintenance.
And we cannot further depress academic salaries below what you would be
regarded as reasonable for white-coated workers with university
degrees.''
In a light-hearted aside in his speech yesterday, the principal
recognised that sub-editors wanted news from graduation addresses, even
if the reader had seen it all before and belonged to the millions who
thought that universities and their staff and students were
molly-coddled.
In his graduation addresses throughout the year Sir William has done
the sector, all those involved in it, and the public at large, a great
service by picking up, dissecting, and reaching conclusions about higher
education issues. Very few people surely believe today that universities
are pampered in some never-ending comfort zone.
But the Glasgow University principal has not restricted himself to
issues such as funding and access, as the graduation address he
delivered on Thursday confirms. Then, he expressed his concerns about
perceptions of greed among a small number of businessmen and deceit
among politicians rebounding on industry and politics by harming their
prospects of recruiting idealistic graduates.
Again, he concluded that it mattered -- and hugely -- when students
held politicians and businessmen in low esteem. ''Unless industry and
politics attract people who have fair-dealing, public service, and a
sense of community purpose bound up with the drive and determination and
imagination which leadership requires, this country will decline and
deserve to.''
His point was that it was crucially important that students were not
turned away from such careers, because the country was greatly dependent
on them.
Sir William is a former student activist whose career has been bound
up with serving the public good. We shall miss his trenchant yet
fair-minded, at times angry yet at times laconic, graduation
commentaries. Anyone who can bring a gardening metaphor to the debate
about quality control is worth listening to.
In Jule last year Sir William reported: ''We had a visit in June from
emissaries of the Scottish Office who had begun five months before an
inquiry into the efficiency of the Scottish Higher Education Funding
Council. The council began to operate only nine months before the
efficiency inquiry started. Now I accept that in many cases where the
market does not operate, substitutes for market mechanisms must be
found.
''But if your market happens to be, say spring flowers, it is unwise
to poke around the bulb roots or seeds shortly after they have been
planted.''

A HATCHET-FACED old woman in a woolly hat propped a Russian icon of
the Virgin and Child on a radiator in a Paris clinic, fingered her
rosary, and waited for the police.
Beside her, a tonsured monk and a white-bearded priest locked
anti-theft chains round their necks and prepared to be carried out to
the paddywagon.
As Spain votes to liberalise her abortion laws and 20 years after
France legalised ''voluntary interruption of pregnancy'', obstructive
protests against abortions have become widespread.
What had been an unquestioned feature of 1970s liberalisation has also
become the subject of impassioned debate. Last week, in the wake of a
dozen court cases over recent months against anti-abortion protesters,
Minister of Justice Jacques Toubon demanded an appeal against a
controversially lenient sentence passed by a Paris court.
The members of the anti-abortion groups come mainly from the archly
conservative and schismatic Roman Catholic circles who refuse the
reforms of the Vatican II Council and whose leaders were ex-communicated
a few years ago by the Pope. Assured of their right to defy republican
law in the name of more urgent religious commandments, the protesters
surround their activities with many conspicuous and comforting signs of
traditional catholicism.
Hated with fury by no less self-righteous feminists who turn up at
court hearings with banners and abuse, the anti-abortiion militants
evidently derive not much comfort from their homeopathic doses of
martyrdom.
Monsignor Balland, Archbishop of Lyon, and head of the Roman Catholic
Church in France, said last week he could not encourage the
demonstrators.
''Their spectacular protests have not prevented a single abortion and
have drawn the limelight away from other groups who work with families
and people in distress to ensure the beginning of life is not
interrupted. Conscientious objection recognised by the law and by the
Pope must not be confused with a call for civil disobedience,'' the
Archbishop said.
The law, meanwhile, does not appear sure which way to swing. Last
Wednesday, 45 members of five distinct anti-abortion groups were given
suspended sentences of between 10 and 18 months and fined up to #2500
each for carrying out a number of protests in hospitals in Lyon and the
nearby town of Bourg en Bresse.
To protest against what they considered an unfair trial, all but one
of the defendants -- a retired colonel who was the main organiser of the
anti-abortion raids -- stayed away from the hearings.
Twenty-four hours previously, nine people facing similar charges had
been let off free by Paris courts.
Mr Toubon, who a few weeks previously had bowed to pressure from
left-wing groups and the National Assembly's law commission to exclude
anti-abortion protests from the traditional amnesty of minor offences
following President Chirac's election, instructed the public
prosecutor's office to appeal against the sentences.
''Given the very strong collective impact of this affair, it is
necessary to stop this illegal behaviour from spreading,'' he said.
In Paris, the prosecution based its case on the legality of abortion
according to the 1975 law and the legislation passed in 1993 by
socialist Women's Rights Minister Veronique Neiertz, making it an
offence to hinder an abortion.
The defence, in the person of lawyer Georges-Paul Wagner, who is also
a member of the political bureau of the National Front, based its case
on a penal code article which legitimises certain actions carried out to
preserve a person -- in this case any foetus under 10 weeks, the limit
fixed by the 1975 law -- threatened by ''real or imminent danger''.
The row has taken on a political dimension. The principal French
family planning organisation and the country's leading trade union, the
CGT and the CFDT, described the Paris verdict as ''scandalous'',
''worrying'', and ''inadmissible''.
The Socialist Party expressed its astonishment and said the French
Parliament had systematically refused a number of demands to accord a
legal status to the human foetus. Conservative politicians, frightened
of being tarred with an extreme right-wing brush, have kept mainly
silent, but the National Front has denounced Mr Toubon's ''relentless
leftism . . . against peaceful militants who are hostile to abortion''.

THE electricity regulator, Professor Stephen Littlechild, is beginning
to look accident prone with the leaking of his latest attempt to benefit
consumers of the regional electricity companies' energy. His last foray
had the effect of leaving buyers of the Government's second tranche of
the two English generating companies feeling decidedly sore as they
nursed immediate losses. It left the Government in a hard place as well,
since it had known about his intentions sufficiently in advance for it
to have halted its flotation plans and fixed a lower price. It chose not
to do so, and was open at once to accusations of everything from bad
faith to publishing a false prospectus. The Professor will now have few
friends in high places and even his latest rewards to consumers do not
seem to be enough to their spokesmen. The big surge in the share prices
of the regional electricity suppliers certainly suggests he did them
little damage.
However, his work deserves more than that sort of reaction. He had to
balance the ability of the companies to charge less now with their need
to invest more; certainly consumers will notice the difference his
efforts will make to their next electricity bills. It is possible to
see, with the experience of the water industry, how these two aims can
be incompatible: our great-grandparents invested in water and sewerage
on a gigantic scale but their children and their grandchildren did
surprisingly little to sustain that achievement, which is why there is
so much screaming to be done now. We may all have been distracted from
that necessity by the greed of the new companies' executives and their
excessive pay awards, but the investment would have to take place even
without the ambitions of the EU directives on water quality and on
beaches. Electricity, being a much newer business, has not such a
backlog of work to catch up on, but it still needs to make heavy
investment. Professor Littlechild may have it right this time after all,
and can always tinker again in the future, though his next review ought
to be a few years away.
The stock market leap reflects two things -- past fear and future
hope. The fear was that he might have been too draconian and damaged
tomorrow's investment by favouring today's users too much. When he
avoided that trap there was bound to be some bounce back in share
prices, which had wilted earlier. The hope is that some of the companies
will be taken over, not because they are indisputably cheap but because
their dependable flows of cash can be valuable to other companies
(especially where, like Trafalgar House, they have tax losses to offset)
or because there may really be too many suppliers in what is a small
country. There ought to be benefits from rationalisation both in
electricity and water, something which may reawaken doubts about their
original privatisation.

LIKE Margaret Falconer (July 7), I have done The Herald crossword for
years. I don't entirely share her enthusiasm for the existing team of
compilers as over the last couple of years at least they seem to be
getting a bit tired and repetitive -- I've even seen the same clue with
the same solution on consecutive days.
Having said that, I thought they had improved a bit over the last few
months, especially on Saturdays. However, I certainly agree with
Margaret Falconer on the subject of DKM's efforts this week.
Apart from a few fairly original clues, he or she seems to have no
idea how crosswords work and as a result has produced a quite
unacceptable number of incompatible clues and solutions by a combination
of grammatical errors, redundant words stuck in to make the clue itself
read as if it means something, anagrams which don't work, general
messiness, and even repetitiveness.
I list a few examples.
7547. 10ac. Trees, such as fir, store up energy for colder weather.
Answer, frostier. Messy, but the word energy has been stuck in for no
purpose other than that the clue would look senseless straight away.
7548. 1ac. Bred out a prominent feature. Answer, obtrude (not obtrube
as printed in the solution). OK, bred out is an anagram of obtrude, but
a verb is an impossible answer as the clue stands.
9ac. You funded the beginning. Answer, founded. Why on earth?
16dn. Dismiss after hearing the reasons. Answer, excuses. This might
be acceptable if the first word of the clue was dismisses.
17dn. Arrives at the highest meetings. Answer, Summits. OK, there was
an idea there but the arrives at is doing nothing in this clue.
7550. 1 and 15ac To the east used twice in same crossword to indicate
the leter E.
7551. 23ac. You split the cost of the flowers. Answer, Tulips. U plus
split = tulips, but cost is an irrelevant piece of adding.
25ac. Tail clan to the west of Eire. Answer, Atlantic. Eh?
27ac. A number get into the van to be sent on. Answer, Transmit. M get
into transit = transmit, which means neither to be sent on nor sent on.
Please second DKM to the Herald Diary as an infinite source of
material for the we-think-they-know-what-they-mean feature.

<TEXT>
TWO Britons and two Americans taken hostage by militant separatists in
the Indian state of Kashmir are unharmed, the men's captors have told
Indian Government officials.
The news was announced as the families of the kidnapped Britons waited
anxiously to hear about the fate of Britons Keith Mangan, 33, and
23-year-old Paul Wells.
The Americans are John Childs from Simsbury, Connecticut, and Donald
Fred Hutchings from Spokane, Washington.
The officials, who did not say how the message reached them, said the
rebels claimed all four abducted men were unharmed, but gave no details
of their possible release.
The news came as about 2250 Indian soldiers and commandos continued a
massive hunt in the remote and heavily wooded mountain area of Kashmir
where the four were snatched on Tuesday.
Indian police used a helicopter to survey the Pahalgam area where they
were seized.
Four other members of the tourist party -- Mr Mangan's wife, Julie,
33; Catherine Anne Moseley, Mr Wells's girlfriend; Mr Hutchings' wife
Jane Schelly; and Canadian Bart Imler were also seized, but they were
freed on Wednesday along with two Kashmiri guides and a note demanding
the release of 21 guerrilla leaders.
Mr Mangan sold his electrical contracting business in London to
finance an extended tour of Asia, which started three months ago. He and
his wife had planned to stay at least 18 months.
His mother, Mrs Mavis Mangan, said she was heartened by news that the
hostages were unharmed.
''It's a relief to know they are unharmed but we will not be able to
rest until they are set free safe and sound,'' she said from the family
home at Middlesbrough, Cleveland.
''One thing that worries me is that with all the soldiers searching
the hills, trouble could flare up and the hostages could get caught up
in it.''
Mrs Mangan said she had received a further telephone call from their
daughter-in-law, who was ''out of her mind with worry''.
Mr Wells, a first-year student at South Nottingham College,
Nottingham, was on a six-week trekking holiday after being left some
money in a legacy.
His parents live in Blackburn, Lancashire. His father Robert was
awaiting news while his mother, Diane, was in hospital after an
operation.
Officials from the British High Commission and American Embassy in New
Delhi met the freed group in Srinagar yesterday.
The four hostages were seized by militants of Al-Faran, a little-known
group fighting for an independent Kashmir.
The abductions were the third of Western tourists in the last year.
All previous hostages have been freed unharmed.
In Delhi, a government spokesman for Jammu and Kashmir said the group
which abducted the hostages was previously unknown and appeared to be a
front for Harkat-ul-Ansar, the group which abducted Kim Housego, the son
of a British journalist, and his companion David Mackie in the same area
a year ago.--Reuter.

BOSNIAN Serb troops today fired 105mm shells at a helicopter carrying
EU peace envoy Carl Bildt shortly before it took off from the Bosnian
capital to fly him to Split in Croatia.
The United Nations said two helicopters came under fire at Konjic,
south of Sarajevo, before taking off without further incident. The
second helicopter was carrying two foreign journalists injured last
week.
Bildt later arrived in the Serbian capital Belgrade for talks with
President Slobodan Milosevic.
Meanwhile a senior Bosnian official challenged the UN to make its aid
mission effective or pull out.
''If you are not going to be effective in carrying out your mission,
then I think you should consider the option of leaving,'' Foreign
Minister Muhamed Sacirbey told the UN in Washington.
Withdrawal of the 22,000-strong mission is increasingly regarded as an
option as Bosnian Serbs cripple aid operations and the Bosnian
Government fights to lift the siege of Sarajevo.
Bildt said earlier that peace prospects were bleak after talks with
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic.
Serb artillery attacks on Sarajevo civilians since the spring have
inflicted scores of casualties and turned the clock back to the worst
days of the three-year war.
Peacekeepers have done nothing to relieve the city's plight while
Bildt tries to crank up a fresh peace initiative.
However one small group of Bosnians were flown to safety in Israel for
medical treatment today, moments before Serb rebels bombed the airport.
Six people, including a Bosnian Army soldier burned by a banned
phosphorous grenade, were flown from Split to Israel.--Reuter.

MR FORSYTH, Scotland's new Secretary of State, is a political survivor
of note, as the exiguous majorities of his Stirling constituency
testify. His formidable qualities have not previously been thought to
include personal charm and a willingness to listen but both were
prominently on display at his first press conference yesterday. That bit
of politics to whose success presentation is vital has been well
learned, and while few will imagine that Mr Forsyth's views have
undergone a radical shift, the image of a maturing political figure
would be fair. He can still -- and did -- attack the other Scottish
parties with verve but his offer of an olive branch, when all together
can advance the Scottish national interest, was shrewd and possessed of
an appeal across party lines.
The main danger faced by Scottish Tories is of participating in their
own marginalisation. Like the Russian Mensheviks who allowed their
Bolshevik enemies to consign them to permanent minority status when the
reality was so different, Scotland's Tories are in danger of forgetting
that though they were a minority at the last General Election so were
all of their enemies. Labour, for example, failed to attract as many as
two Scots in five; and the Tories, who did slightly better than one in
four, outpaced their two other competitors. The opinion poll findings
are far more gloomy for them now, but it remains to be seen whether
their apparent confirmation in the local elections will be repeated on
the national stage. Old campaigners will know not to despair until
actual votes are counted.
Scotland's is a fragmented political culture and even their agreement
to some form of devolution does not mean that the three other parties
actually see eye to eye about its nature and preferable extent. There is
still much to be fought over in that sphere and it looks as if Mr
Forsyth may yet move the Scottish Tories to a less isolated position
than they have occupied until now. He certainly indicated that he would
fight strenuously one Labour proposal to provide a Scottish Assembly
with the power to impose a separate and additional tax to that already
imposed on the rest of the country. The consequences of that power, not
to be granted to the Welsh incidentally, may not have been fully
considered. It must be a Labour vote loser in a situation where
hostility to additional direct taxation seems to feature in every
developed country in the modern world. The ''tartan tax'' here (but no
''Taffy tax'' for Wales) has the potential to divert many minds from the
attractions of Labour's main devolutionary proposals. One safe
prediction is that much will be heard of this tax, and its possible
effects, over the next two years.
Mr Forsyth and his new team, whose professional experience is
unusually tailored to their portfolios, are committed to listening and
to consultation. That by itself is a welcome enough change. It is
absolutely necessary when the Government is bereft of the clout which is
conferred by more seats and voters than it at present enjoys. It is a
prudent politician who can eat humble pie with some evident relish. The
fact remains that listening alone is not enough; once specific policy
issues are encountered it is bound to be the case that the Government's
collective opinions do not easily fit Scottish moulds or assumptions.
The structure of power in local government, for example, is such that no
matter how flexible Mr Forsyth can be, he will lack the power base
Labour councillors in particular enjoy. This has already been recognised
in the administration by quango, which Mr Forsyth may be too late to
change in the water boards, for example. To the extent to which he can
alter this policy he will reduce his own power steadily and strengthen
that of his opponents. He faces many difficult choices and will need
luck as well as resource to face them successfully, but at the very
least the new ''nice'' Michael Forsyth is an improvement on his
doppelganger ''nasty''.

PRESIDENT Clinton has decided in principle to recognise Vietnam and
exchange ambassadors, putting a final end to the long enmity between the
two countries. The Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, and other
officials have made a formal recommendation to that effect, and all that
is needed is a final gesture from the president.
The last American ambassador to South Vietnam escaped from the roof of
his embassy by helicopter in April, 1975, as North Vietnamese tanks
rolled into Saigon. There has never been an American ambassador in
Hanoi, now the capital of the reunited country.
A reconciliation between the two countries after the trauma of the
long war has been constantly impeded by the question of the 2000 or so
Americans lost during the war and whose bodies have never been
recovered. For many years there was a large, vocal, and influential
group, including many members of Congress, who believed that Vietnam was
still holding a number of Americans prisoners.
This was always fantasy, but it was persistent. The Vietnamese were
not always helpful in allowing American investigators to look for bodies
at crash sites in the jungle. Over the years, however, it became
increasingly difficult to believe that there were any survivors, but in
1991 President Bush allowed an American office to open in Hanoi to
co-ordinate searches for the ''Prisoners of War, Missing In Action''
(PoW/MIAs).
Early last year President Clinton lifted the trade embargo on Vietnam
and American businessmen flocked to Hanoi, believing that Vietnam would
expand as rapidly as China and other Asian countries that adopted a free
market system.
There remains opposition to normalisation. The pain of losing a war is
still acute, and right-wing Republicans still accuse Mr Clinton of being
a draft-dodger because he avoided the conflict.
Several prominent veterans now in Congress support normalisation,
while other Republicans, like Senator Gramm and Pat Buchanan, who are
running for president, and the Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, who
also avoided serving in Vietnam, are silent on the issue.

Bruce McKain dips into the second
volume of Lord Stott's memoirs
which takes a mischievous look at
his contemporaries
FOR 20 years as Lord Advocate and a judge in the High Court and Court
of Session, Gordon Stott kept a diary. Many who feature in its pages
will wish that he had mislaid his pen, but Lord Stott, still
incorrigible at 85, has performed an invaluable service by lifting the
veil on the normally opaque world of the judiciary.
Judge's Diary, covering the years 1967 to 1973, will certainly
embarrass some members of the legal establishment, but there is much
more to it that. The book paints a memorable picture of the era of the
mini-skirt, beatniks, miners' strikes, power cuts, the three-day week
and the Vietnam war. And a random selection of observations from Lord
Stott's early years on the bench provides a fascinating and sometimes
disturbing insight into Scottish life:
* A desertion case: the pursuer, a delightful old fellow of 76. He had
married 30 years ago and a month later his wife had left him to go to
the toilet and never came back.
* Eleven divorces: one in which the pursuer alleged that her husband,
in order to vex her, had kept a spider in a vase in the living-room and
fed it on bluebottles.
* A cruelty case in which the pursuer averred that her husband
insisted on sleeping with a labrador bitch.
* Divorces, one insanity and six cruelty. The defender in the insanity
case had, in a fit of depression, cut off both of his hands in a
circular saw.
Some of the stories do have a happy ending:
In a custody case involving six children, Lord Stott had a chat with
the four youngest whose future was still in dispute.
He recalls: ''All agreed that Thomas, nine, wanted to stay with his
father. Evelyn, 11, wanted to go to her mother; and after some
cogitation Mary, 10, thought she would like to go with Evelyn. They said
that Lynn, the youngest, was always changing her mind and it did not
matter where she went.''
A week later his decision was vindicated.
He notes: ''In the Daily Record the whole front page is taken up with
two delightful pictures of the Johnson family; Mrs Johnson with the four
children allotted to her, and Mr Johnson with his two. Everyone in both
pictures was beaming with obvious pleasure: a singularly happy
outcome.''
Lord Stott's judgments on his political and legal contemporaries are
never less than interesting, often waspish and sometimes just plain
mischievous.
''It is odd that Ross (Scottish Secretary) who keeps rushing around
doing everything under the sun, gets persisently criticised for doing
nothing, while I, who do practically nothing, am paid tribute for doing
so much.''
''Gordon-Walker (the Labour politician) waffled away as usual,
assuring us with obvious truth that he had a completely open mind.''
An entry for May 13, 1968 relates: ''Panorama had a bunch of Labour
MPs discussing the party debacle. We switched off the sound and were
able to watch Mr Shinwell, Mr Woodrow Wyatt and the rest of them
mouthing away with that egregious ass Robin Day to the accompaniment of
a Brandenburg Concerto on the wireless.''
He recalls the assassination of Robert Kennedy in typical Stott style:
''We had Harold Macmillan, tears trickling down his cheeks as he
wallowed in sentimental recollections of 'Bobby'. It seemed a bit
overdone even for this wonderful old ham actor, but no doubt it was
genuine enough.''
October 27 1969: ''World in Action on ITV tonight dealt with the
training of America's special force, the Green Berets -- the object
apparently being to turn halfwits into lunatics.''
A later entry: ''World In Action was concerned about the fate of
mountain villagers of Vietnam, sitting about in despairing wonder while
illiterate American louts bombed their lovely country into a desert.''
In December 1970 in the midst of a strike by electricity workers the
Government proposed to avoid embarrassment by deferring for six months a
big salary increase for judges. ''I remarked to (Lord President) Clyde
that while I had no objection to what was proposed I objected to giving
any indication of support to the bunch of buffoons who were at present
running the country.''
He summarises 1971 thus: ''Under a Government devoted to the welfare
of the affluent at whatever cost to the community or the concept of a
humane, civilised way of life, 1971 was an easy year for the well-to-do
and so it was for me.''
In 1972 his old adversary, Lord Clyde, retired as Lord President of
the Court of Session. ''There was a farewell ceremony which I was unable
to attend, being away on circuit, so I thought I should write him a note
saying I should miss him about Parliament House, even if only in the
capacity of oldest enemy.''
Lord Stott's general opinion of Clyde can be gauged from an earlier
conversation which took place when he informed the Lord President that
Harry Wilson was to succeed Stott as Lord Advocate. Stott remarked that
Wilson seemed to get a good hearing in court. ''We never give anyone a
good hearing,'' said Clyde, a statement which  Lord Stott wholeheartedly
endorsed.
Lord Emslie succeeded Clyde as Lord President and, according to the
diaries, Lord Stott discovered that ''Lord Avonside was not at all
pleased with Emslie's appointment.''
A clue as to why is provided by a diary entry for January 12, 1973:
''Speaking of recent appointments to the Bench, (Lord) Kissen said that
Shearer (Lord Avonside) would have been Lord President if it had not
been for the affair of Colin Temple, when he wrote to the employers of
one of the witnesses who had appeared before him, suggesting that the
man should be dismissed.
''Kissen said that Wylie (Norman Wylie, the Lord Advocate) had
intended to appoint Shearer but could do nothing for him because of the
public outcry that would have resulted.''
(Colin Temple was a 17-year-old youth sentenced to two years'
detention in 1971 after being convicted of attempted rape in Kelvingrove
Park. He claimed he had a perfect alibi and, on the directions of the
Scottish Secretary, Lord Avonside heard additional evidence in private
but the conviction stood.)
The worry for the great and good in the legal profession is that there
is another decade of Lord Stott's thoughts on his career on the Bench
still to be published.  Once that has been done a long-standing prophecy
may be seen to have been realised.
In 1972 an article appeared in the Journal of the Law Society of
Scotland: ''There has been a persistent tale that the most brilliant
account of Scottish legal life in the twentieth century will come from
the pen of Lord Stott, just as Braxfield and Eskgrove are known to us
almost solely through the account of Cockburn, so will Clyde and
Avonside be presented to the twenty-first century through the mind of
Lord Stott.''
* Judge's Diary 1967-73 is published on Monday by The Mercat Press at
#15.99.

AS the writer of one of the ''contentious letters'' to which Carole
McLean-Smith makes reference I would make two points in reply (July 4).
It is not wrong to contend for what you believe to be the truth
providing you respect the views of people which differs from your own,
and attempt to live peaceably with those who hold them.
Her reference to ''God's unconditional love'' seems to me to be
suspect. Certainly God's love is unconditional in that it is not in any
way dependent on our goodness.
It does, however, express itself in Jesus -- in providing in His Son
the means by which our sins can be forgiven. Thus it calls us to
repentance and faith in Him.
I commend to Carole McLean-Smith and all who are interested in unity
and peace a careful study of Paul's letter to the Galatians 5:16-26
which tells us of the true spirituality to be found in Christ.

A PENSIONER spoke yesterday of why she refuses to budge from a home
closed by Strathclyde Regional Council amid accusations of neglect.
Mrs Cathie Walker, 69, still lives at Caldwell House Residential Home,
Renfrewshire, which lost its registration six months ago following
damning reports from a social worker.
Mrs Walker was giving evidence at Paisley Sheriff Court as the appeal
mounted by the home's owner, Dr Sohail Chaudhry, entered its fifth day.
She criticised a senior social worker, Davina Young, who Dr Chaudhry
had earlier accused of ''hounding and harassing'' him. Mrs Walker said:
''She hasn't got a heart.''
Mrs Walker said Mrs Young was pressurising her to leave Caldwell
House.
She said the only way she would leave was ''in a box''.
Mrs Walker told Sheriff Principal Robert Hay she had chosen to move to
the residential home near Lugton, from her own house in Barrhead, after
she had visited the premises for the day.
She was then suffering from agoraphobia which made her frightened to
go outside.
Within weeks of moving to Caldwell House, she had improved so
dramatically that she was able to mix with other residents and go on bus
outings and shopping trips.
Mrs Walker, who has been a resident of the home for three and a half
years, added: ''We were one big happy family. At one stage they voted me
honorary matron. Life at Caldwell House was good, very good.
''We had our own freedom, I was allowed to help bake in the kitchen
and make my own soup.
''We were taken on outings and entertainment was provided with bands
coming in. They even brought us fish suppers in sometimes.
''Dr and Mrs Chaudhry are very good to me and were always very good to
all of the residents.
''It was terrible the day the others were forced to leave. They were
all breaking their hearts. They didn't want to leave.''
She said Mrs Young continued to put pressure on her to leave, adding:
''She's fighting a losing battle. I love Caldwell House and I have no
intentions of leaving.
''I have told her I don't even want to see her again, but she still
comes back. I've told her she's not a Christian. She doesn't have a
heart.''
Another former resident, Mr Jackie Boyd, 71, said he was a such poor
health before going to Caldwell House he could not walk, but due to the
care and attention he received he was a changed man.
Pointing to Dr and Mrs Chaudhry, he said: ''These people couldn't do
enough for me. It was like living in a hotel. I was so sorry to have to
leave. They brought me back my health again.''
The former seaman, nicknamed Sinbad by his fellow residents, said
during his two and a half years at Caldwell House he had once had to go
back to the hospital from which he had been discharged.
When he arrived, staff did not recognise him and said to Dr Chaudhry
who was with him: ''Where's the down-and-out we sent you?''
Domestic assistant Margaret Corrie, who had previously spent 15 years
working for two health boards, said she had enjoyed her four years at
Caldwell House, where everyone felt ''like one big family''.
She said Mrs Young caused friction every time she arrived on the
scene, adding: ''She was like a ghost. Every time you turned round, she
was at your back.''
Senior care officer Jean Campbell broke down in the witness box as she
recalled the day the home was closed and the residents were forced to
leave.
She sobbed: ''The residents were all crying, they were so distressed.
It broke my heart. It was horrendous.
''They were all lifted like a sack of tatties and herded off like
cattle. I was so upset, I never slept for three nights afterwards.''
Describing Mrs Young's role in the affair, she said: ''She'll never go
to heaven. There's a place in hell for her.''
The hearing was adjourned until August 2.

MRS Winifred Ewing, president of the Scottish National Party, next
week celebrates 20 years as a member of the European Parliament. Madame
Ecosse, mother of the house in Strasbourg, is now Britain's
longest-serving Euro-MP (but not the oldest).
She will be guest of honour at a formal reception on Monday when she
will be on her best behaviour. On the following night there will be a
less formal party when, with luck, the other Winnie Ewing will turn up.
This second, more entertaining Winnie Ewing likes nothing more than a
ceilidh and an argument. This is the feisty political combatant and
nationalist crusader, the Winnie Ewing of the flashing anger with anyone
who criticises Scotland or dares to dispute her opinions. The Winnie
Ewing who picks arguments and celebrates winning them -- which she
usually does -- by breaking into song over a dram. It should be a lively
night.
To call Winnie Ewing a passionate politician is an understatement. The
European Parliament has long become accustomed to her occasional
outbursts -- tantrums would not be too strong a word -- and her cogent
interventions. Most people who challenge her views on Scottish politics
end up regretting it as the President of the Parliament himself, Klaus
Hansch, did recently when he had to offer her a public apology after a
minor misunderstanding.
A few months ago in Brussels Mrs Ewing was taking questions after a
robust speech. A member of the audience rashly suggested that Scotland
might not gain from independence or even want it. Mrs Ewing finds this
sentiment incomprehensible. Rather than explain why she disagreed, she
simply took offence, questioning his patriotism. Baffled that anyone
could even think such a thing, she left him condemned more or less as a
traitor.
This is the style which has served Winnie Ewing well for almost 30
years at the centre of Scottish politics. It might not be logical but,
like the scattergun, it often works. Opponents have learned the hard way
that hitting Winnie Ewing over the head with facts is unproductive. She
responds, usually convincingly, with emotion and the conviction of the
single-issue campaigner.
Winnie Ewing is an old-fashioned nationalist of the romantic and
cultural kind for whom ideological political disputes are secondary --
an approach which helps in the conservative rural areas of Scotland, but
has only fleetingly proved powerful enough in the rough and tumble of
Labour-dominated urban Scotland.
But it takes more than romantic conviction to explain her remarkable
record as an electoral winner during almost three decades in a party
noted for only occasional if spectacular triumphs. Luck has, admittedly,
played a part but only at the start of her career.
Winnie Ewing came to prominence at the Hamilton by-election of 1967
when the local Labour Party, corrupt and incompetent, surrendered the
seat by its own complacency. That amazing result has left the Scottish
Tories and Labour's Scottish unionists paying the price to this day
because it let loose the genie of Scottish nationalism which continually
threatens their precious British nation state.
There had been successes before for the SNP but none quite like this.
Of all the party's charismatics -- Sillars and MacDonald, et al -- none
has managed to stay the course like Winnie Ewing. When two weeks ago she
was honoured by Glasgow University, where she qualified in law, the Dean
of the Faculty, Professor John P Grant, recalled her famous saying in
the aftermath of the Hamilton breakthrough: ''Stop the world -- Scotland
wants to get on.'' Almost 30 years on, the Scotland she yearns for as an
independent member of the European Union is farther down that road but
has still a dauntingly hard journey ahead.
Her other famous victory cry -- ''this is the millennium'' -- came in
the aftermath of the dramatic personal defeat in Scottish post-war
politics when in 1974 she toppled none other than the Secretary of State
for Scotland, Gordon Campbell, to take his Westminster constituency of
Moray and Nairn.
I recall my colleague, William Hunter, having just written a piece
predicting that result in this newspaper, repairing to the pub shaking
his head. ''It's the enormity of what I've just written,'' he fretted.
Next day his story appeared over the headline: ''This is a Campbell who
could be going . . .'' In those days you did not say things like that
about Scottish Secretaries but Winnie Ewing proved that in Scottish
politics the bigger they are, the harder they fall.
Yet the nationalist millennium still has not come. The SNP enjoyed
salad days in 1974 only to fall into disarray over devolution and wither
for almost a decade. Only occasionally has nationalism triumphed in that
time -- in Govan, briefly, and most recently in Kinross and Perth in
Westminster terms; and in North East Scotland in the European elections.
For most of her elected life Winnie Ewing has been exiled in Europe
working in relative obscurity. It was Le Monde which first described her
as Madame Ecosse and although her Labour critics will tell you no-one
calls her that except herself, they are wrong.
Until Allan Macartney won North East Scotland last year Winnie Ewing
was alone in Strasbourg. The Madame Ecosse sobriquet survived because
she had always presented herself as a representative of Scotland as well
as her constituency -- a presumption which causes resentment among her
opponents. When the chair in Strasbourg calls for a distinctively
Scottish voice it usually turns to Mrs Ewing, to the irritation of some
of her rivals.
Harold Wilson, whom she liked and admired, sent her unelected to
Strasbourg in 1975 which meant that for a time she was both MP and
Euro-MP. Later she legitimised this secondary role by winning the
Highlands and Islands Euro-seat for the SNP in the first Euro-elections.
Being from a minority party she landed herself in trouble for a while
when she joined a parliamentary voting block including French Gaullists.
The SNP at home was embarrassed but no-one knew what to do with her.
''Winnie will do as she's telt,'' one of the left's luminaries said back
in Edinburgh.
But making Winnie do as she is telt is never easy. Nowadays she sits
among a group of radicals which includes the flamboyant French crook
Bernard Tapie, now facing a jail sentence for fixing soccer matches. Her
Labour opponents in Strasbourg -- there are no Scottish Tories left to
bother her -- snipe from the sidelines but Winnie Ewing is long since
secure enough to stand aloof.
For most of her life in Europe she has worked on routine committee
duties, trying to improve the lot of the Third World with Euro-aid,
helping youth and other worthy efforts, and throwing some famous
parties. But two concerns have brought particular attention.
The Spanish in Strasbourg could see her far enough. For years she
battled -- ultimately in vain -- against the Spanish fishing fleet's
attempts to gain more access to Scottish waters. Being a lawyer she took
issue with the European Commission's legal base for changing the
Spaniards' terms of accession to the Treaty of Union, to the extent of
producing her own bulky legal judgment. Most independent observers
regarded it as flawless but, this being Europe, it was ignored in the
interest of political expediency, a force which has no respect for
scruple.
Her other campaign -- in which she had cross-party support -- was a
winner but only after many years. Her efforts to win so-called Objective
1 funding -- where the big European aid money lies -- for Highlands and
Islands allowed her to claim a personal triumph.
Mrs Ewing took the case to the very top during the British EU
presidency in 1992. Across the floor of the House in Strasbourg she
asked John Major if he would back the case for Objective 1 for Highlands
and Islands. The Prime Minister promised he would -- and the rest is
history.
Her presidency of the SNP has been eventful and relatively successful
-- given the party's respectable poll ratings -- though it owes most to
Alex Salmond's abilities to keep the warring left and right in his party
away from each other's throats. Winnie Ewing did not help her own cause
with her bizarre and much-criticised recent attack on Roseanna
Cunningham, victor in Perth and Kinross, whom she accused of having an
affair with her present daughter-in-law's ex-husband many years ago.
It was seen as a blatant bid to block Cunningham's candidature for
purely personal reasons but it backfired when someone tipped off the
press. An embarrassed Mrs Ewing put on a brave face and swallowed her
pride, not that she had much option. This curious episode is now buried,
Mrs Ewing must hope, for ever.
Winnie Ewing will be 66 on Monday and is now probably into her last
term in Strasbourg. Before the last election she was told she might have
a serious illness. While waiting for the results of tests she decided
she would stand down in Highlands and Islands if the news was bad. But
it was not. She fought on and won again, allowing the SNP and herself to
breathe a sigh of relief.
She knows that the party has too often seen its power bases in
illusive terms: thus it believed, for example, that Western Isles
belonged to the SNP when in truth it belonged to Donald Stewart. When he
disappeared the seat went to Labour. The same principle could apply in
Highlands and Islands. It looks like the SNP's private property but it
could in reality be only Winnie Ewing's.
In Winnie Ewing's time across the water in Europe a new generation of
Scots has grown up, some of whom don't even know who she is. Winnie
Ewing can walk down a street anywhere in Scotland nowadays unnoticed
(quite an achievement given her recent attachment to clothes of
traffic-stopping colours and a hairstyle which needs kept in place with
concrete).
Yet she is one of a disappearing breed, a Scottish politician of
stature who wins votes because of who she is, regardless of party
politics, and because she is trusted. She has her place in history which
is why hers will be a tough act to follow. If, as expected, she retires
after this term no-one should be surprised if her successor is called
Ewing.

FLAMBOYANT former Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis became the
latest casualty of Italy's corruption inquiries today when a court
sentenced him to four years in prison.
De Michelis and former Transport Minister Carlo Bernini were convicted
of taking bribes from builders in exchange for supporting motorway
construction in the north-east Veneto region, their former political
power base.
Bernini, once a powerful member of the now-defunct Christian
Democratic Party, was sentenced to 3[1/2] years in prison.
De Michelis, whose long hair and disco-dancing made him one of Italy's
most colourful public figures, was accused of violating party financing
laws by taking bribes totalling #346,000 for motorway construction
contracts.
De Michelis, Foreign Minister from 1990-1992, has denied all charges
against him and an expected appeal will keep him out of jail. He did not
attend the sentencing session of the eight-month trial.
The ruling capped a week of frenzied judicial activity in which former
corruption-busting magistrate Antonio Di Pietro was questioned over his
investigative methods and alleged graft, and some of Italy's top fashion
designers were ordered to stand trial on corruption charges.
One of the few to breathe easy this week was former Prime Minister
Silvio Berlusconi.
On Tuesday, a judge postponed until September a decision on whether
Berlusconi should stand trial on corruption charges .--Reuter.

Crown Court yesterday that the mother-of-eight should face a trial on 10
counts alleging murder. She would then face a second trial on four
counts alleging rape and indecent assault against young girls.
Her husband, Frederick West, 53, of Cromwell Street, Gloucester, was
found hanging in his cell at Birmingham Prison on New Year's Day. A full

LABOUR leader Tony Blair yesterday fired his first broadside at the
Prime Minister's new Cabinet.
He dismissed the Tory leadership contest as an event watched by
millions ''with a mixture of horror and disgust'', and seized on
challenger John Redwood's slogan: ''No Change, No Chance.''
Mr Blair targeted the Deputy Prime Minister and First Secretary of
State Michael Heseltine, claiming he would be ''leading the Tory lie
machine''.
In a speech to the Society of Magazine Editors in London, Mr Blair
made plain his determination to contrast ''Tory same-ism,'' with his own
radical agenda.
Amid private fears among Tory back benchers that the Government may be
forced to call a General Election next year, Mr Blair said every
decision taken by the Tories would be with an eye on the next day's
newspapers.
Taxes would be cut, new public spending found and unpopular policies
temporarily concealed, he said.
Labour front bench spokesmen underlined the new plan of attack
yesterday with a series of statements claiming there had been no change
on key policy areas such as education and law and order.
Mr Blair was swift to attack the Cabinet to counter the recent
reversal in poor Conservative opinion poll ratings.
He also made clear he had no intention of relaxing the pressure on the
Government over Europe.
Highlighting the splits within the Tories over the issue, he warned
that the divisions remained and they ''cannot put the genie back in the
bottle''.
In a swift response, the Prime Minister said: ''I do think Tony does
talk nonsense.''
He told ITN News: ''If you take Labour's European policies, they have
more dissidents on European policy than the Conservative Party has
had.''
Meanwhile, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, Foreign Secretary, moved to assert his
Euro-sceptic credentials by warning of the implications of a single
European currency and declaring those with doubts over Europe to be a
''legitimate part'' of the Tory party.
In a clear attempt to bolster the Government's toughened approach to
monetary union, he warned that introducing a single currency would be an
''irreversible'' step.
Mr Rifkind's comments were designed to reassure the Euro-phobic right
of the party which has expressed fears over his previous support for
federalism.
''I think the question of a single currency would be something of
historic significance,'' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
''It would be irreversible, it would have very powerful implications
for any country that moved in that direction.''
Mr Major has refused right-wing demands for an unequivocal declaration
against a monetary union. He argues instead that such a decision would
have to be taken when it arises, based on the circumstances at the time.
But Mr Rifkind's remarks were significant for their conciliatory tone.
However, last night the former whipless Tory Euro-rebels were meeting
in Nottingham to demonstrate that they have no plans to be quiet on the
subject.
The Bruges Group of Tory Euro-sceptics also issued a statement
attacking the lack of their number in the reshuffled Cabinet.
Mr Major completed his Government shake-up yesterday with a new
line-up in the Whips office.
Mr David Lightbown, a senior whip, is replaced by Mr Tim Wood, MP for
Stevenage, who has been a junior Whip since 1992. Also removed is Mr
Sydney Chapman, MP for Chipping Barnet, replaced by Mr Tim Kirkhope, MP
for Leeds and a former Scottish Whip.
Both Mr Lightbown and Mr Knapman receive knighthoods. Two Whips have
been appointed: Mr Roger Knapman (Stroud) and Mr Gary Streeter (Plymouth
Sutton).

THE Three Graces, the famous statue by Antonio Canova, is to be shown
in Scotland for the first time.
It will be displayed in a special exhibition at the National Gallery
of Scotland in Edinburgh from August 9 to October 8.
Its arrival north of the Border follows the combined operation last
year by the National Galleries of Scotland and the Victoria and Albert
Museum in London to save the sculpture from export overseas.
They bought the Three Graces for #7.6m to prevent it going to the J
Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, California. They now own it jointly.
The two museums were helped in the purchase by grants and donations
from the National Heritage Memorial Fund (#3m) and the National Art
Collections Fund (#500,000), and by private donations by Mr J Paul Getty
II (#1m) and Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen Bornemisza (#800,000).
Under the arrangements agreed between the two museums, the statue will
stay at the National Gallery for four years after October.
Then it is likely to travel between Edinburgh and London every seven
years.

THE Scottish Office Ministers set out their priorities yesterday.
Minister of State Lord James Douglas-Hamilton said he would be giving
priority to law and order. He wanted to see far more officers back on
the beat. The new Criminal Justice bill would help to tighten up on bail
provisions, he said. On health, he wanted to see waiting lists cut.
Industry and Local Government Minister George Kynoch said he wanted to
give more help to small and medium-sized business. The amount of time
businessmen had to spend on filling in forms must be reduced and he was
awaiting a report on this matter. He was also looking at toughening up
guidelines on appointments to the new local government authorities.
Education, Housing, and Fisheries Minister Raymond Robertson promised
to lighten the burden of paper work and bureaucracy for Scottish
teachers. He emphasised the importance of combining education with
training and said the priorities were increasing choice and
opportunities.
Agriculture, Forestry, and Environment Minister the Earl of Lindsay
emphasised the importance of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency
-- it would deliver an integrated and cohesive service for the
environment and would be a one stop shop for industry and for farmers.
The framework document on forestry would also be important and the Rural
White Paper for Scotland due this autumn would tie everything together.

THE principal of Aberdeen University, Professor Maxwell Irvine,
yesterday described Shell's decision not to sink the Brent Spar in a
deep-water Atlantic grave as one of ''the saddest days in the history of
environmental debate''.
''It was not the result of careful analysis, scientific reasoning and
rational judgment,'' said Professor Irvine at a graduation ceremony in
Marischal College.
''It was the result of ignorance and one-issue campaign politics, and
I believe it was sponsored by those who wished to draw attention away
from the much more serious environmental issue of continental industrial
pollution.''
He claimed the universities had a major part to play to develop
greater understanding of the issues involved.
Shell Expro has been granted permission by the Norwegian government to
moor the Brent Spar in a fjord east of Stavanger.
The Spar is expected to reach Erfjord in three days but it will take
many months before further studies on decommissioning are completed.
Aberdeen University conferred an honorary Doctor of Laws degree on
Thai Princess Maha Sirindhorn yesterday. An acclaimed scholar, she is a
keen environmentalist and head of the history department at a military
academy in Thailand.
Strathclyde Chief Constable Leslie Sharp also received the honorary
degree of Doctor of Laws yesterday from Strathclyde University. The
59-year-old is due to retire this year.

THE former mayor of a cult commune town told the trial of two British
women accused of plotting murder that the pair were present at a meeting
when the plan to kill a top lawyer was discussed.
However David Knapp, who was known as Swami Krishna Deva during his
time as mayor of Rajneeshpuram, admitted that he had lied repeatedly
under oath in the past.
He claimed that Sally-Anne Croft and Susan Hagan were part of a
conspiracy to kill Oregon state attorney Charles Turner in 1985, shortly
before the commune broke up amid charges of attempted murder,
wiretapping, arson, and immigration fraud.
Knapp was the first of five former followers of the guru Bhagwan Shree
Rajneesh who are due to give evidence for the prosecution.
Hagan, who lives in Abbots Langley, Hertfordshire, with her children
Katherine, 19, and Nicholas, 24, and Croft, a City accountant who lives
in Mayfair, central London, fought a long battle against extradition to
the US to stand trial.
Both deny joining in a conspiracy to kill Turner, who was never
attacked.
As mayor, Knapp said, he gave many statements that he knew were untrue
to further the cause of the commune.
In court, he was confronted with a transcript of his initial interview
with the FBI in late 1985. In it he did not list Hagan among those who
attended a meeting in which the plot to kill Turner was first discussed
and said only that Croft possibly was there.
However in evidence he said he now remembered that Croft and Hagan
attended the meeting in May 1985.
Croft, known as Ma Prem Savita at the time, was in charge of the
commune's finances. When the talk turned to buying guns, Knapp claimed:
''I recall Savita saying that she could provide money for that if it was
necessary.''--AP.

Revelations about human experiments in Aberdeen prompt worried
inquiries.
ABERDEEN Royal Infirmary and the city's university have received calls
from people anxious about their own health and the health of their now
adult children follow revelations about human experiments carried out in
the 1950s and 60s.
Aberdeen was one of the centres where the experiments were conducted,
but last night the Medical Research Council, which has been inundated
with calls, said there was nothing to worry about and condemned a
Channel 4 documentary about human experiments in which radioactive
material was used for causing ''unnecessary alarm and fear''.
Both the university and the hospital have promised to do what they can
to allay the fears of concerned callers, and the MRC has established a
helpline which people can phone.
The programme True Stories: Deadly Experiments, revealed details about
a number of experiments, including two in Aberdeen in which pregnant
women had radioactive iodine injected into their thyroid glands.
It also revealed that thousands of corpses, including those of babies
throughout Scotland, had bones removed without the knowledge of
relatives, to be sent for analysis for fallout levels.
Retired Scottish head teacher Mrs Kathleen Morrison, 62, her sister,
and three friends, were among 91 pregnant women involved in the thyroid
experiment carried out as part of his PhD thesis by Dr Aboul Khair, a
research fellow in Therapeutics and Pharmacology.
Mrs Morrison, from Cruden Bay, believes their trust was ''betrayed''
because although they were volunteers they were not fully aware of what
was involved, and she is concerned about the risk the series of
injections may have placed on their unborn children.
However, yesterday an MRC spokesman said there was absolutely no cause
for concern because the quantities of radioactivity involved were
''miniscule'' and there was no risk.
There was no evidence to suggest any risk in diagnostic doses which
were several times greater than the women received, or from therapeutic
doses which were hundreds of times greater.
He said the thyroid was known to be prone to change and problems
during pregnancy, and the research was to discover what these changes
were.
He said that a Swedish study had been carried out involving 22,000
women who had received therapeutic doses and there was no indication of
any greater risk of cancer to them or their offspring.
He said no follow-up study had been carried out on the Aberdeen women.
It was not deemed necessary because the doses were so low, and in most
cases below the level of background radioactivity which people were
exposed to in their daily lives.
Professor Graeme Catto, dean of the Faculty of Clinical Medicine at
the university, and vice chairman of Aberdeen Royal Hospital's Trust
said: ''We are certainly concerned and we can fully appreciate that
people are worried. We are suggesting that people should contact the
MRC, for whom the research was done.''
He said if Dr Aboul Khair had graduated from the university, it was
possible that they still had his thesis and this was being investigated
by the university.
A hospital spokesman said they had asked callers to write in and they
would ensure their concerns were dealt with.
Dr David Evered, deputy chief executive of the MRC said: ''We are
concerned that the programme and associated press coverage will have
caused unnecessary alarm and fear.
''We would like to reassure all those who took part in MRC experiments
that there was not, and is not, any risk to their health. These were not
radiation experiments as such, although very small doses of radioactive
materials were used in the tests in order to help solve important health
problems.
''Established investigative techniques were used and considerable
research over many years has not shown any adverse health effects from
such tests.
''The assertion that any of these experiments were carried out in
secret is patently absurd -- the results were published in widely
available scientific journals. With regard to consent, since 1953 we
have issued statements clearly stating a requirement that our
researchers obtain consent from volunteers, and in those cases where we
have been able to talk to the researchers involved, we know that this
procedure was followed.
''We regret the distress caused to parents by the revelation that
samples were removed from children's bodies, but question whether it is
in the best interest of those parents to acquaint them with this fact 40
years later.
''The fact that parents were not told about this at the time reflects
concern for the recently bereaved rather than any attempt to mislead.''
The MRC Helpline, which will be open during office hours until noon on
Friday is 0171 637 2425.

THE Queen offered her sympathy to nurses for changes in the NHS when
she attended the official opening of the Scottish headquarters of the
Royal College of Nursing in Edinburgh yesterday.
During a tour of the building in the Grange, the Queen spoke to
several RCN delegates who had travelled from all over the country for
the event.
She expressed sympathy over the many changes that had taken place in
the National Health Service and the hard work faced by nurses to keep
themselves continually updated.
Accompanied by senior RCN officials, including Scottish Secretary,
June Andrews, she also spent some time looking at an exhibition of
nursing in wartime.
Afterwards, she spoke to a large number of residents from a nearby
residential home for the elderly.
She was then driven to RAF Turnhouse where an aircraft of the Queen's
Flight was waiting.

THE public service union Unison claimed yesterday that #14m had been
earmarked for transfer from the Scottish NHS capital projects budget to
make computer centres more attractive to private buyers.
Union leaders said hospitals would be forced to freeze vital building
plans or lose out on life-saving equipment if the move went ahead.
Seven computer centres serving the NHS in Scotland have been scheduled
for privatisation.
Unison regional officer Dave Watson said it was proposed that the
value of computer equipment at the centres should be cut from #17m to
just #3m to bring down the selling price for private bidders.
Companies would be unwilling to pay large sums of money for equipment
they may not want to use, the union claimed.
But Mr Watson said less money would be available for spending on
capital projects if the selling price dropped. He said the #14m
represented some 7% of total capital expenditure.
The Scottish Office has strenuously denied that capital spending would
be reduced to balance the books.
But Mr Watson said sources within the health service were certain of
the plans.
He said: ''There is no doubt about the figures -- the money is being
transferred to balance the books. NHS computer assets are valued in the
NHS cost book at around #17m.
''A requirement to purchase these assets would be a major disincentive
to private contractors, but equally are of no value to the NHS once the
business has been privatised. To get round this it has been arranged for
the assets to be 'revalued' to a new value of around #3m.
''The money has to come from somewhere, and the real effect will be an
overall reduction of #14m in the Scottish NHS capital budget. This means
the real losers are the hospitals, health centres and other vital
facilities.
''To this figure has to be added the massive cost of the whole
exercise in staff and consultant time.''
He warned security may be compromised if computer services were in the
hands of a network of private firms.
Mr Watson said the new Scottish Health Minister, Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton, should stop the ''financial scandal''. He added: ''If
he will not, we will have no hesitation in raising it with the National
Audit Office. It would be dreadful waste of public money and the
Minister would have some explaining to do.''
Labour's Scottish health spokesman John McAllion said: ''It looks like
a sweetener, being paid for by robbing the NHS and it is completely
indefensible. At the same time it is no surprise given the record of
this Government. They are not interested in the NHS, they only want to
get rid of it.''
SNP parliamentary leader Margaret Ewing said she would raise the
matter with Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth and Lord James.
A spokesman for the Scottish Office said: ''There is no question of
reducing the NHS capital provision to fund or balance the books for the
exercise. Overall, this market-testing initiative is expected to produce
significant revenue savings which will more than offset the capital
charge element in any new provider's contract price.''

A FORMER groom has ended a court bid to win damages for injuries
sustained in a riding accident.
Miss Annette Cloughley, 26, had claimed #75,000 from the Fife farm
partnership where she was looking after horses at the time of the
incident in which she broke her pelvis and a collar bone.
However, a jury at the Court of Session in Edinburgh yesterday heard
that after three days of evidence a settlement had been reached in the
case and that Balcormo Farm and the partners in the firm had been
cleared of blame for the accident.
Miss Cloughley, a training officer, from Brackagh Moss Road,
Portadown, in Northern Ireland, had sued the farm, near Leven, and the
three partners in the business: Sandra, Dougal, and Jacqueline
Low-Mitchell.
She had gone to work on the farm shortly before she was injured in
October 1990 when she was due to take part in cub-hunting. Miss
Cloughley told the court that her mount reared up and she fell.
She alleged there was a failure to provide proper training or
instructing in ''cubbing'' or in handling the horse.
She also claimed there was a failure to fit properly a martingale, a
piece of equipment attached from the horse's bridle to the girth, and
that it was not fitted with stops.
The farm said that Miss Cloughley, who was an experienced horsewoman,
had a duty to fit the martingale properly and to keep the horse under
control. It maintained she had failed to do so and caused the accident.
Miss Cloughley told the jury she had not wanted to go cub-hunting and
that Sandra Low-Mitchell called her ''chicken'' when she expressed
reluctance -- a claim which was disputed.
When the case resumed, counsel for Miss Cloughley revealed a
settlement had been reached, which absolved the farm partnership from
blame.
Lord Macfadyen told the jury that in those circumstances they would no
longer be required to decide the case.

<HEADLINE>Fish farming gives a major boost to Crown Estate growth</HEADLINE>

THE Crown Estate which holds properties throughout the UK and almost
300,000 acres of agricultural land -- a third of which is in Scotland --
has shown major growth in its revenue in the past year for the benefit
of the Treasury.
The annual report, published today, reveals that, significantly for
Scotland, investment in fish farming has been one of its biggest success
stories, contributing 29% of the revenue.
The industry is said to have played an important role in the fragile
economy of many remote areas of Scotland although rent increases were
introduced last January.
Referring to the fish farming sector success, the report stated that
further consolidation in the industry had been made with the acquisition
of Scotland's largest producer, Marine Harvest, by Booker McConnell.
Last night a spokeswoman for the Crown Estate confirmed that the fish
farming industry was in a healthy position, exporting regularly to
Europe from the west coast.
Mr William Crowe, chief executive of the Scottish Salmon Growers'
Association, was sceptical last night about the profits being made by
the Crown Estate.
He said: ''Our members are concerned that it is benefiting as a result
of our members' hard work, taking some #2m a year from the industry, as
our landlord in the marine environment.
''It has the benefit of tenants in an industry without any risk on its
part.''
Mr James Buchanan, executive director of the Association of Scottish
Shellfish Growers, said he felt the Crown Estate was ''something we can
live with quite happily''.
He said: ''We appreciate somebody has to be in authority. I would
rather have the Crown Estate than regional councils, because there would
not be an even playing field.''
He said matters would be very differently handled, for example, in
Argyll and Bute compared to Highland region.
''I believe some local authorities are quite hostile to the whole idea
of aquaculture. They want pretty views rather than fish farms.''
He felt that the Crown Estate was not making ''obscene profits'' from
his industry, which was paying a reasonable rent meantime.
The report stated that concerns about falling sea trout populations
around the west coast had led to the setting up of the West Highland Sea
Trout and Salmon Group.
Support of the concept of local co-operation and consultation would
continue, as these had been identified as important elements in working
towards an improvement in fish stocks.
Further funding of research work in assisting the prospects of
commercial farming of halibut was being looked at, providing an
opportunity of diversification in the industry, the report stated.
Overall revenue surplus accounted for #84.8m, an increase of 7.5% from
which the Exchequer will benefit from a turnover of #133.2m, according
to the report. Scotland's contribution was #6.5m, mainly reflected in
commercial property value.
The Crown Estate is part of the hereditary possessions of the
sovereign, managed by its own commissioners, with the net surplus, after
deductions for management expenses, going directly to the Exchequer.
Commenting on the results, Lord Mansfield, chairman and first
commissioner, said he was pleased to report a highly successful year,
particularly in Scotland, because it demonstrated a successful
management technique, and sound investments.
The investments included properties in George Street and Princes
Street in Edinburgh worth #24m.
Lord Mansfield said that despite the downturn in the property market
in the '80s, the National Audit Office found that the commissioners had
successfully enhanced the value of the estate by #486m in real terms in
the 10 years from 1985.
Rents are reviewed by the Crown every five years.

RESEARCH papers kept in the archives of Glasgow's Ruchill Hospital
throw some light on the scientific concerns, about the effects of
nuclear fall-out, expressed during the decade when radiation experiments
were being carried out.
Written in the late 1950s and 1960s by the pioneering Scottish
clinical physicist, Dr John Lenihan, the papers give a snapshot of the
thinking which prompted some scientists to inject radioactive iodine
into pregnant women, for others to remove the bones of unborn children
without the permission of the next of kin, and the feeding of
radioactive chapatis to Asian women in Coventry.
One paper, The Scientific Basis of the Radiation Hazard, written in
1958 while the scientist worked at the Western Infirmary, Glasgow,
outlined new fears about the dangers of radiation.
Dr Lenihan described the risks scientists thought strontium could pose
to the population in the event of nuclear fall-out. There could be, he
suggested, a risk of genetic damage resulting in mutations in future
generations. He also warned of the threat of leukemia and bone cancer.
''One conclusion which emerges from the study of these problems is
that we do not know enough to make any accurate estimate of the dangers
to be faced from the radioactive contamination of food, now or in the
future. A much greater research effort is needed to tackle this
difficult situation before it becomes any worse, as it will if large
hydrogen bombs continue to explode. More work and less talk must be the
policy.''
A paper published almost 10 years later, in 1966, looked again at the
biological consequences of radioactive fall-out and estimated that 500
bone samples obtained during post mortem examinations were being
analysed every year in the UK, with similar programmes under way in
other countries.
The purpose of such experiments, along with tests carried out on
animals and adult volunteers, were, said Dr Lenihan, aimed at finding
drugs which could counter any harmful effects of digesting radioactive
strontium.

* Pringle of Scotland's plant in Arbroath has closed with all 221
employees paid off.
The knitwear factory on the town's Elliot industrial estate had
continued to operate to complete existing orders after the parent
company, Dawson International, announced in March it was closing the
Arbroath plant.
The majority of the workforce left in June with others remaining until
yesterday to meet the orders.
Last night, East Angus MP Andrew Welsh said: ''It is another sad day
for Arbroath. I believe, however, that Scottish Enterprise Tayside are
working with Dawson International to sell the premises as a going
concern. Luckily, quite a number of the employees have found work in
Arbroath and the district.''

THE Automobile Association yesterday announced plans to close 11 of
its retail outlets in Scotland.
Across the UK, 98 shops will shut in the first phase of a programme to
reduce the number of outlets from 253 to 110 by 1997. About 350 staff
are affected, 34 in Scotland.
Mr Ian Morrice, director of AA retail, said: ''Like other retailers,
we are seeing a trend towards buying services, particularly insurance,
over the telephone.
''While we remain committed to a network of High Street shops at prime
locations in major conurbations, and many existing outlets are thriving,
we have identified 98 shops where the level of business handled cannot
justify keeping the shop open.
''Inevitably, our review takes staffing levels into account, and
includes support and administration roles. There will, regrettably, be
job losses, but we shall seek to redeploy as many as practicable of the
staff affected to other parts of the AA group.''
Mr Robert Wann, deputy national secretary of the GMB union, said: ''We
are shocked by the announcement which follows on from 1500 redundancies
in the AA insurance business within the last 12 months.''
He said it ''would do little to lift our members' sprits at a time
when the company has imposed a pay freeze on insurance staff at the same
time as trying to change contracts and hours of work''.
The shops which will close in Scotland in the next four months are at
Cardonald, Shawlands, and Partick in Glasgow, Clydebank, Paisley,
Dunfermline, Inverness, Kilmarnock, Perth, Kirkcaldy, and Leith.
An AA spokesman added that members and customers could continue to pay
membership subscriptions and renew their insurance at other AA shops or
by telephone and mail. He stressed the review was restricted to AA
retail activities only and would not affect roadside rescue operations.

FORMER Labour leader Michael Foot has been paid ''substantial'' libel
damages by the Sunday Times and received an apology from the paper,
which insisted in court yesterday that it never meant to call him a
Soviet spy.
The 81-year-old author, journalist and politician had sued over three
pages of articles published in February under the headline ''KGB:
Michael Foot was our agent''.
Mr Foot originally named the paper's owner, Mr Rupert Murdoch, as a
defendant, but the High Court heard Mr Murdoch was ''no longer a party
to this action''.
Mr Foot's counsel, Mr Geoffrey Robertson, QC, told Mr Justice May the
articles were about how the Soviet intelligence service targeted Labour
leaders and trade union officials in the 1960s, and had regarded Mr Foot
as an unwitting ''agent of influence''.
''To many readers the articles could, or would, have suggested that he
was a spy or influential KGB agent who had knowingly and willingly
supplied inside information on British politics and other matters to the
KGB, thereby betraying his country, colleagues and the democratic
principles he has always upheld, and causing serious damage to the
national interest,'' said Mr Robertson.
Other references to Mr Foot could, or would, have been understood to
suggest that he had knowingly propagated Soviet views in the socialist
journal Tribune for money and had ''thereby debased his high moral
standing as a journalist''.
Mr Foot had always borne criticism of his personal views and political
decisions ''with fortitude''. But, having devoted his life to the
service of his country, in this case he felt he had to take action to
clear his name.
The publishers, Times Newspapers Ltd, said Mr Robertson, were in court
to state ''unequivocally'' that they accepted there could be no truth in
any of the allegations and to apologise sincerely if anyone
misunderstood the intention of the articles.
They had agreed to pay substantial damages and Mr Foot's legal costs.
Solicitor Alastair Brett, for the newspaper, said it believed the
subject matter of its report was of public concern and interest and that
it took reasonable steps to check information it had received.
''But the Sunday Times never intended making any of the allegations,''
he said. ''It honestly believed it had made it clear that the article
did not accuse Mr Foot of being a KGB spy, agent or confidential
contact, or of any improper conduct.''
Afterwards, Mr Foot, who was in court for the brief hearing, said:
''what the Sunday Times said was so serious -- that I was a spy who had
served one of the most wicked organisations that has existed this
century -- I thought it had to be wiped clear, and it has been.''

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth yesterday set out his agenda for
winning back Tory support, and behind the relaxed demeanour lay a
determined sense of the Thatcherite verities of slashing bureauracy and
boosting the private sector.
That he sold this manifesto and introduced his new Ministerial team
while enjoying banter with the press, demonstrated a new confidence. He
emphasised the sincerity of his olive branch to hostile groups and said
others must judge whether he was a changed politician since his last
spell at the Scottish Office.
He attacked the policies of the Labour Party in Scotland and the
Scottish National Party and then offered them an olive branch. He
berated Labour's ''tartan tax'' on devolution and accused the ''extreme
left wing'' SNP of picking up the policies even Labour had discarded.
But he went on to offer to work with them for the good of Scotland.
''I am keen, despite the rude things I have said about them, to work
with the Labour Party and the SNP in partnership. The olive branch is
there. It is up to them as to how they respond.''
Mr Forsyth also gave an indication that as part of his wish to make
quangos more accountable, he is examining the make up of the boards of
the three Scottish public water authorities.
An announcement about membership of the authorities had been expected
in the next few days but a delay is now likely as Mr Forsyth said he was
looking at the matter.
Mr Forsyth accused the Labour Party of the ''worst kind of
opportunism'' over its attitude to the new authorities. It was
continually calling for quangos to be made more accountable but Labour
councillors had turned down invitations to serve on the water
authorities.
Speaking at St Andrew's House in Edinburgh, he also made it clear he
would continue to harry Labour over its plans to allow a Scottish
Parliament to raise income tax by up to 3p in the pound.
''What are we to say to inward investors when they ask why is it that
Wales is having a Parliament but they are not having a taffy tax, but
Scotland is having a tartan tax. I am going to ask that question until
we get an answer.''
Setting out his priorities, Mr Forsyth said the war against forms and
bureaucracy would be stepped up within the Scottish Office. He wanted to
see a lot more surgical tape and a lot less red tape being used in
Scotland.
He knew there was frustration about this within the private and public
sector.
''We want to see our teachers and our doctors and our nurses and our
police freed from form filling and administration to the extent that is
possible.''
He also wanted to place more emphasis on the Private Finance
Initiative which he claimed was ''the most exciting thing going on in
Government at the present time''.
Ways must be found to bring more private capital into public service.
He insisted it was not privatisation but meant Scotland could get better
roads, more hospitals, get drains sorted, by having big capital projects
funded by the private sector.
Another of his hobby horses, he said, was doing something about sport
in schools and encouraging our youngsters to have more access to team
sport.
He also wanted to see more closed circuit television systems in town
centres.
On ministerial portfolios, Mr Forsyth made it clear he would be
responsible for constitutional affairs and Europe.
Introducing his new team, the Scottish Secretary said they had done
something unusual. A teacher was looking after education, a lawyer
looking after home affairs, a businessman looking after industry and a
farmer concerned with the environment looking after these areas.
''So we have Ministers who actually know what they are talking about,
'' he said with a grin. ''Whether this will be something which will be a
success remains to be seen. But I am pretty confident it will''.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson responded later: ''The Tory
lie machine is obviously being cranked up into operation. Mr Poll Tax is
telling porkies and he knows it. Michael Forsyth's 'tartan tax' is pure
fiction. Labour's plans would give a Scottish Parliament the power to
vary revenues down as well as up.
''The Scottish people are not as daft as Michael Forsyth thinks they
are. They know the difference between having the power to raise or cut
taxes and actually doing it. They also know not to trust the Tory party
that gave Scotland the biggest tax rise in its political history.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond called the new team a ''pathetic line-up'' and
claimed the Scottish Secretary had surrounded himself with a team of
lightweights, the better to run a one-man band at St Andrew's House.
Minister of State Lord James Douglas-Hamilton will be responsible for
health, social work, home affairs, and roads and transport.
Mr George Kynoch will stay in charge of industry and local government
with his brief including tourism, planning, water and, for the first
time, the Highland and islands.
One of the new members of the team, Mr Raymond Robertson, will be
responsible for education (including training), housing and urban
policy, fisheries, and sport.
The Earl of Lindsay takes over agriculture, rural affairs, natural
heritage, forestry, and the arts.

IRISH prime minister John Bruton yesterday pressed Britain to act over
the release of paramilitary prisoners in Northern Ireland.
Mr Bruton said the release this week of Lee Clegg, a paratrooper
convicted of murder, after four years of a life sentence, had, ''created
a focus on the need to be compassionate in regard to the release of
prisoners''.
Mr Bruton added: ''They can be released earlier now because there is
less of a risk of re-offence as there is peace.
''I have been putting pressure on the British Government for a number
of months now. It has been raised several times. There is intense work
going on.''
He was speaking after a Dublin session of his Government's National
Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, during which he had a 40-minute
''routine'' meeting with Sinn Fein president, Mr Gerry Adams.
His comments coincided with a strong parliamentary attack by
opposition leader Mr Bertie Ahern on the current approach of both the
British and Irish governments towards the Northern Ireland peace process
after the Clegg move.
Mr Ahern said: ''I am concerned that the British Government is not
paying attention to the views of the Irish Government. We do not have to
go any further than what happened in relation to Private Lee Clegg.
''There is a total frustration developing among the communities in
Northern Ireland that the peace process is producing nothing, that the
British Government is not doing anything, that it is not keeping faith
with what it said before the ceasefire.''
Later, deputy Irish prime minister Dick Spring said he was hopeful of
a British move ''very shortly''. However he would not comment on reports
of a development on the prisoner front within days.
Mr Spring also called for an ''essential'' renewed focus on the peace
process after Mr Major's victory in the Conservative Party leadership
contest.
A plan to permit the release of Northern Ireland's paramilitary
prisoners after the handover of IRA and Loyalist arms to third parties
was submitted yesterday by the Conservative Party's Bow Group and was
detailed at the National Forum for Peace and Reconciliation session in
Dublin.
Meanwhile, five RUC officers were injured, and three people arrested
when trouble broke out at a Republican demonstration in the centre of
Belfast yesterday.
A crowd of 150 protesters, demanding the release of paramilitary
prisoners in the wake of Private Clegg's release, fought with police
trying to disperse a sit-down blockade of Belfast City Hall.
The demonstration had been organised by Sinn Fein's prisoners' group
Saoirse (Freedom) which accused the RUC of being heavy-handed.

A WOMAN told a jury at the High Court in Glasgow yesterday about the
night she was dragged into a common close and raped.
The 31-year-old Miss X was giving evidence at the trial of a
15-year-old boy from a residential home charged with a series of sex
offences in Glasgow's South Side in July and December last year.
The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is accused of dragging
the secretary into a close in Allison Street, Govanhill, on December 2
last and raping her twice.
He also denies attacking four women in the street with intent to rape
them, putting a number of other women in a state of fear and alarm, and
four indecency charges against a 15-year-old girl resident of the home
where he stayed.
Miss X told the court yesterday that her attacker first told her that
he was going to have sex with her and said: ''Then I am going to kill
you.'' When she screamed out, he warned her that he would kill her if
she did not stop.
The jury heard Miss X tell how she was making her way home when she
became uneasy at the sight of a youth in a close watching another woman.
Seconds later, she said, she felt arms encircling her body and was
dragged into close where her half-hour ordeal began.
After being raped for the first time the attacker, whom she identified
in court as the accused, made her perform an indecent sex act.
Miss X described his mood at the time of the attack as ''hyped up and
aggressive'' and said he made several references to the fact that he had
a knife. She told how she was then dragged by the hair barefoot over
gravel into the backcourt and over railings.
She told the jury: ''He never let go of my hair. He said he was going
to take me to his flat.''
At one point she tried to pull away from him and he hit her repeatedly
in the face until she felt her face wet with blood. As she was being
pulled by the hair she put a hand up to her head to see if he had a
knife and touched his other hand. He then punched her in the eye, before
proceeding to rape her again.
Miss X told the court that her attacker also claimed he had been in
prison twice for murder.
She said: ''He said he liked being in jail because he got respect and
asked if I respected him, to which I whispered 'yes'.''
During another point in her ordeal her foot got caught between two
railings. Miss X told the court her attacker had then asked her if the
metal felt nice.
Her deliverance came when he dragged her out into the grounds of the
Dixon Halls. There she screamed to attract the attention of two people
standing at a nearby bus stop.
When a man asked her if she was alright and she replied no, her
attacker put both arms round her body and began to drag her away.
Miss X continued: ''When someone does that to you, you automatically
run. I had to try and stop so I let my body go totally limp so he could
just drag me.
''He was very, very angry. He dragged me some distance and then he
dropped me and started to run away.
''But he only ran a short distance and came back and kicked me on the
head twice.''
Miss X said she went with police to retrieve her handbag from the
backcourts because it contained her keys, and she was scared the
attacker would go back and get it.
In addition to severe bruising, cut feet, black eyes and scratches,
her skull was fractured in the attack. She was detained in hospital for
four days.
Asked by Mr Donald Finday, QC, defending, if she could have been
mistaken about her assailant's identity she replied: ''No. I saw his
face clearly in the moonlight.''
The trial before Lord McCluskey continues.

YESTERDAY was a bit of a cock-up on the listings front. More
journalists than you could shake a stick at turned up to watch the
glittering premiere of the sequel to the legendary horror movie
Nightmare on Elm Street, provisionally entitled The Beast Slouches Back.
No sooner had they gathered in the splendid 1930s palais de plaisir
known as St Andrew's House, swallowed a few Prozac, and shivered
together at the back as the lights went down, than they found themselves
watching a sequel to Four Weddings and a Funeral.
The reviewers were clearly discomfited. Specialists in gore and the
living dead, they found their talents unequal to light social comedy.
The star was unrecognisable, coming across as nothing like his pictures
in the Daily Record where he had been portrayed as horror show freak
Freddy Krueger.
Instead, the new matinee idol of the silver screen of Scottish
politics turned out to be a chap called Michael Forsyth, less suave than
his debonair predecessor perhaps, but a commanding figure at the heart
of the action. Although thinning on top, he had a fine line in flattery
and a droll way with humour.
With him were distinguished faces left and right -- the respected
method actor Lord James Douglas-Hamilton with co-star billing, and the
silver-haired smoothie George Kynoch, on whom we rely for our water
supply.
In the wings were rising star Raymond Robertson, who has taken
exception to previous reviews by this critic, and newcomer Jamie
Lindsay.
Some political-thespians of a female persuasion at Westminster are
know to consider Jamie a bit tasty, and have compared him to Hugh Grant
before the unfortunate business with the mint condom. The entire cast
leapt to the defence of Jamie yesterday, saying that in spite of his
relatively short time treading the boards, he will be an Oscar-winner in
years to come.
Yesterday's award, however, had to go to Michael Forsyth. ''Is there
any legal action pending over the unpleasantness in the Record?'' I
asked an aide as we awaited the arrival of the entourage. ''Yes,'' came
the reply. ''Krueger's suing.''
In fact, Forsyth held the assembled company in thrall. ''You're all
very restrained today,'' he said.
A television journalist of long experience quizzing the Secretary of
State on whether he was a changed man was shamelessly flattered with a
reference to the fact that she had not changed. She accepted this with
perfect grace by later miming throwing up.
The crew from the Record were scuppered in an attempt to fuel their
own headlines by slipping the word ''nightmare'' unnoticed into a
question. And The Herald's own right-wing standard-bearer, columnist
Michael Fry was forced to respond to criticisms of press bias. ''You
can't blame me,'' he said, anguished, ''I've been working for you for
years!''
As for the rest of us, it is clear that while we are still vermin,
whereas in the past we would be beaten like seal clubs on an ice floe,
we will now be subjected to a barely less icy fate of being smothered in
ministerial charm.
Journalists will be tolerated, civil servants will be praised, and the
old world we knew will swing on its axis. ''It's great to be back!''
announced the Scottish Scretary yesterday. ''I am honoured, delighted
and flattered.''
A media groan was strangled at birth but the thought escaped before it
could be reined in. Do we actually want the all-new, Mr Nice Guy
responding to barbed questions with flattery, tough arguments with
charm? Or would we prefer the Monster we thought we knew to the charmer
we can't handle?

STAFF at the Passport Office Agency, including 250 in Glasgow, are to
ban overtime, withdraw goodwill, and work to rule from Monday week. They
are threatening a week-long strike over fears about job security.
The 1200 staff at the six passport offices voted by 410 to 175 for
sanctions short of strike action, and by 339 votes to 254 for a
week-long stoppage in protest at plans to cut staffing levels by 10.6%
and close four of the offices, putting the remaining two on a two-shift
system.
Mr Frank Campbell of the Civil and Public Service Association said
that, although the strike call had been endorsed, action was being held
back pending talks being sought with management to resolve the
differences.
''We hope they will take up our offer of talks in a constructive
manner, in order to avoid a situation where our members have to resort
to strike action,'' he added.
The union's Scottish officer, Mr Michael McCann, said the object was
to defend a public utility which had performed to an excellent standard
over the last five years. He felt it would be madness to jeopardise that
standard and drift back to the bad old days of lengthy delays and long
queues.
Meanwhile, more than 1.5 million white and blue collar local authority
workers, 100,000 of them in Scotland, are to be consulted on whether
they are prepared to accept their employers' refusal to reopen wage
negotiations.
Local government unions, including Unison, the General Municipal and
Boilermakers, and the Transport and General Workers, have claimed a
#5-a-week flat rate top-up increase to new rates which came into force
last month under the second stage of a deal negotiated last year. They
did so under a clause saying that negotiations could be reopened should
inflation or pay settlements elsewhere take ''unexpected turns''.
The second stage gave increases of 1.4% plus a one-off #100, making it
worth an average of 2.2% -- well below the current annual inflation
level of 3.4%.
Mr Keith Sonnet, head of local government at Unison, which represents
860,000 of those involved, maintains that the employers' point blank
refusal to reopen pay talks is completely against the terms and spirit
of the deal reached last year. Inflation was higher than predicted at
the time and other pay settlements were higher than expected.
He accused the employers of discriminating against the workers. They
should not be expected to take a cut in living standards, or to fall
behind the pay of other workers.
''We shall be consulting our members on what action they are prepared
to take,'' he said.

FORMER Celtic footballer Johannes Edvaldsson was seriously ill in
hospital yesterday following a brain haemorrhage, less than four months
after former Rangers player Davie Cooper died from a similar condition.
The Icelandic-born player was shopping with his fiancee and baby
daughter in Inverness when he collapsed.
The incident, which happened at the town's Eastgate shopping centre on
Tuesday, was captured on security cameras. Mr Edvaldsson, 45, was given
immediate medical attention by security staff.
He was then taken to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness, where he was
treated at the accident and emergency unit before being transferred to
Aberdeen Royal Infirmary on Wednesday.
A spokeswoman at the hospital yesterday described his condition as
''stable''. His fiancee, Miss Cathy Bradley, was believed to be at his
bed-side.
Mr Edvaldsson, who was known affectionately by Celtic fans as
''Shuggie'', has run the Poolewe Hotel in the West Highland village of
the same name for the past four years.
The editor of Wester Ross Life magazine, Mr Don Shaw, said: ''He is
very well liked in Poolewe. He is such a warm, welcoming person. The
hotel is renowned for its hospitality. This is a great shock.''
Fellow hotelier Mr Peter Harrison, of the Pool House, Poolewe, said:
''We wish him a speedy recovery. It's all so very unfortunate.''
Celtic manager Tommy Burns, who played alongside Mr Edvaldsson,
contacted his fiancee yesterday to express his concern. He said: ''He
was a real character at Celtic and everyone's thoughts are with him.''
Celtic manager Jock Stein brought Mr Edvaldsson to Scotland after
spells with Icelandic sides Valur and Holbeck. During his years at
Celtic Park, he attained a reputation as a big-hearted and gritty player
who never gave up.
His most memorable games for Celtic included the last game of the
1978-9 season, when, in a Rangers-Celtic decider, Celtic scored two
second-half goals to clinch the title.
He left the club in 1980, after two league championship and three
Scottish Cup triumphs, and then enjoyed a spell playing football in the
United States.
From the US, he moved to Hanover in Germany for a season, before
returning to Scotland to captain Motherwell for two seasons. He retired
from the game in 1984.
Former Scotland and Rangers player Davie Cooper died in March at the
age of 39 from a brain haemorrhage.
He collapsed while filming a coaching programme for Scottish
Television at Clyde's Broadwood Stadium in Cumbernauld, and died later
in hospital.

<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S top policeman faced a barrage of criticism yesterday after
he apparently blamed young black men for most of the muggings on the
streets of London.
An attempt by Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Condon to
involve black community leaders in a plan to curb street crime appeared
to have backfired badly.
A letter inviting 40 black MPs and others to a briefing on the
proposed crackdown caused a bitter backlash. Sir Paul wrote: ''It is a
fact that very many of the perpetrators of mugging are very young black
people, who have been excluded from school and/or are unemployed.
''I am sure I do not need to spell out the sensitivity of dealing with
this crime problem, which is, of course, much more than just a police
problem.''
The commissioner, who is known for his liberal views, was stoutly
defended by Home Secretary Michael Howard and many Tory MPs and by the
Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers.
Mr Howard said Sir Paul ''must be free to air all the issues he sees
fit in the fight against crime''.
He added: ''The criminals do not discriminate in any way. Every
section of the community, black and white, suffers from street
robbery.''
However, black MPs Bernie Grant and Paul Boateng, who both received
the letters, were bitterly critical of Sir Paul's comments.
''People will just think that every young black person is a mugger
because the Metropolitan Police Commissioner says so,'' said Mr Grant.
Mr Boateng added: ''You can produce the same facts that show that the
overwhelming majority of city fraud is committed by white middle-aged
upper class males.
''Are we going to have specific initiatives geared towards that sector
of the community?''
Sir Paul's letter came as relations between the police and London's
black community were already strained.
Tensions have risen since the death of Brian Douglas last May when he
was restrained by officers in Clapham, south London, using the new
US-style batons, and the acquittal of three officers who were charged in
connection with the death of illegal immigrant Joy Gardner.
Recent figures have also indicated a sharp increase in police use of
stop-and-search powers on black people.
Sir Paul came under pressure yesterday to produce figures to back his
claims.
According to reports, a recent survey of mugging victims found that
80% of their attackers were black.
However, Scotland Yard was unable to provide any details of the survey
yesterday, and could only comment: ''Information from a large number of
victims is that a high percentage of assailants are very young black
youths. Arrests reflect this information.''

GOVERNMENT assurances that coastguards do not conceal details of
emergencies at North Sea oil installations were questioned yesterday
when leaked internal documents showed nine serious incidents were marked
''not for publication''.
The Coastguard Agency confirmed the practice but said it was done to
avoid worrying oil workers' families.
Opposition transport spokeswoman Joan Walley said the evidence was
''contrary to assurances from ministers''.
Copies of the telex messages, obtained by the Shetland News Agency,
show that, on nine dates between October last year and March this year,
Aberdeen coastguards wrote on situation reports sent to Shetland
Coastguards in Lerwick: ''For information only -- not for publication''.
The incidents involved gas leaks on the Brent Alpha, Brent Delta, and
Miller oil production platforms off Shetland, a report of fire on the
Brae Bravo platform, heavy weather damage to the oilfield standby
vessels Seaboard Swan, Seaboard Support, and Veesea Garnet, and an alert
when a broken-down fishing boat drifted towards the Beryl Alpha
platform.
The messages were dated, timed, and identified by message numbers. All
were copied to the oil companies and shipowners involved.
Last month, Mr Bob Driver, regional controller of coastguards in north
and east Scotland, flatly denied allegations that coastguards hushed up
North Sea emergencies to avoid embarrassing the oil industry.
In a Parliamentary written question last month, Ms Walley asked the
then transport secretary, Brian Mawhinney, ''if incident reports from
emergencies aboard North Sea oil rigs have been marked 'not for public
reference' by the Coastguard Agency or the Department of Transport''.
Mr Chris Harris of the Marine Safety Directorate replied: ''HM
Coastguards situation reports are official working messages to bodies
dealing with marine emergencies. They are normally copied to Lloyds
casualty information service. It is usual practice for these messages to
be headed 'for information -- not for publication'. This is to avoid
causing unnecessary anxiety to the relatives of those working
offshore.''
A coastguard spokesman yesterday confirmed the ''not for publication''
label applied only to oil installations. He said: ''This is because of
our relationship to the oil companies. They deal with media inquiries in
such cases. If the media want to know if we've sent a lifeboat or a
helicopter we certainly tell them.''
Replying to allegations last month from former Shetland coastguard, Mr
Jim Evans, Mr Driver said: ''If there has been an incident we would say
so, unless specifically asked not to. We now have an offshore liaison
team in day-to-day communication with all the major companies. They
don't ask us to keep things quiet.''
Mr Evans yesterday made new allegations in his campaign against what
he sees as excessive cosiness between the coastguards and oil industry.
He said he knew of 10 other incidents where Shetland coastguards had
either not been informed of incidents or told to keep them quiet. They
ranged from a helicopter swamped by a wave in the Brent field to an
injured oil worker being flown to hospital from the Cormorant field.

AN investigation into a Paisley security firm's contract dealings with
Renfrew District Council has demanded more detailed information from
heads of council departments.
The chairman of the council inquiry into FCB Enterprise Security Ltd,
which is allegedly linked to money-lending, drug-dealing, and organised
crime, made the demand yesterday after the first meeting of a working
party forced on Labour councillors in May by an SNP, Conservative, and
Liberal Democrat coalition.
Councillor Bruce McFee, SNP group leader and inquiry chairman, said he
was seeking answers to several ''very serious and searching'' questions
raised by the Accounts Commission, the council's external auditors, in a
report to the council about the company.
Speaking after yesterday's session, Mr McFee said the Accounts
Commission had asked why, in competitive tendering for the council's
district-wide security contract earlier this year, four companies were
invited to tender, despite the fact two had not wanted the contract then
and had indicated in previous years they had not wanted it.
The Accounts Commission also asked why companies were invited to
tender for council work, but were not on the council's approved list of
contractors and why, in awarding the contract in successive years to
FCB, it had awarded the contract consistently to a company that was not
on the list of contractors.
It further asked why FCB, when it was carrying out the council's work,
had not been financially vetted and noted concern about this had been
expressed at officer level.
Mr McFee said: ''I think it is premature to judge what the answers to
such questions are going to be. However, suffice to say I am
sufficiently concerned to repeat these questions and request more detail
of the appropriate directors rather than the reports they have submitted
so far and their answers which have been too vague.''
He added: ''It seems strange that a company handling so much work for
the district council is not an approved contractor and was not
financially vetted.''
Mr McFee, who has previously alleged some council members have been
obstructive in their dealings with the inquiry, yesterday criticised
what he claimed was an attempt by the inquiry's three Labour councillors
to dissuade members from discussing details of the inquiry in public.
He also criticised a council decision that, because the FCB working
party was not a council committee, its meetings should be held in
private.
The committee of inquiry, which comprises three Labour councillors,
two SNP, and one each from the Tories and Liberal Democrats, is due to
meet again on July 21.

THE decision of the appeal court in England to release Emma Humphreys
marks the latest stage in a debate that began in earnest in Scotland 16
years ago with the case of June Greig.
It now seems inevitable that the law will have to take a long, hard
look at how it treats women who retaliate after suffering years of abuse
at the hands of violent partners.
That raises a number of questions. Should the law treat women as a
special case? How do we define the concept of provocation? Should we
reconsider whether a conviction for murder should carry an automatic
life sentence? In May 1979, 30-year-old June Greig was jailed for six
years for killing her violent husband, at whose hands she had suffered
what was described as a life of hell.
The problem for Mrs Greig was that she inflicted the fatal blow as the
drunken lout was dozing in a chair.
She claimed she had been provoked, which would reduce her crime from
murder to culpable homicide.
The trial Judge, the late Lord Dunpark, instructed the jury in the
following terms: ''In the normal case of murder, provocation only
operates when the accused is either attacked or is so alarmed by the
violent conduct of the other person as to be reasonably apprehensive of
his or her immediate safety -- and I emphasise 'immediate'.''
Lord Dunpark reminded the jury of the evidence that the husband was a
drunkard and a bully, and had made his wife's life a misery -- a fate
suffered by thousands of wives.
''But if one day the worm turns, if I may use that phrase, not under
the immediate threat of violence, but by taking a solemn decision to end
her purgatory by killing her husband, is she not to be found guilty of
murder?''
The jury chose to disregard his clear guidance and convicted her of
culpable homicide, saving her from the automatic life sentence that
follows a murder conviction.
A decade later, Lord Dunpark had changed his mind. In an interview
with The Herald after his retirement, he said: ''If you take a broad
brush look at the whole background and consider whether there was
provocation in the lay, rather than the legal sense, that would include
the fact that the woman had been battered and abused for years and the
worm will turn eventually.
''I think that should be a ground for reducing murder to culpable
homicide.''
There is an argument that introducing a less strict, if commonsense,
definition of provocation will provide a licence to kill, but if juries
think the present law on provocation is inhumane they will not convict
of murder.
A more sensible option might be to scrap the mandatory life sentence
for murder and leave sentencing to the discretion of the judge, so as to
reflect the vastly different circumstances in which the crime is
committed.

Mr Herman Ouseley, chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality,

''We are concerned that the Commissioner's initiative may be a
reaction to pressure from some police officers and others who have
objected to the publicity surrounding concerns about the considerable
over-representation of black men in stop-and-search figures,'' he said.
Sir Paul came under pressure yesterday to produce figures to back his

JOHN Fashanu, the footballer who hosts the television programme The

he was involved in a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.
He must report back to Hampshire police in one month's time, pending
inquiries.
The Aston Villa striker was on police bail in connection with claims
concerning match-rigging when he was arrested at his business office in
London on Thursday morning in connection with fresh allegations.
The officers involved in his latest arrest were concerned over
suggestions that an attempt might have been made to bribe a witness in a
possible trial involving Fashanu and other footballers.
Fashanu, 32, will be told on July 21 whether he will face charges
concerning the original allegations.

LABOUR last night demanded the resignation of the electricity
regulator, Professor Stephen Littlechild, as the power price leak row
deepened.
The Shadow Energy Minister, Martin O'Neill, urged Professor
Littlechild to ''throw in the towel'' after it was disclosed that he had
been warned that his price-cap plans could leak out.
Professor Littlechild was being blamed yesterday for the surge in the
share prices of the English electricity companies which forced the early
publication of his proposals for electricity price cuts.
Copies of his report were forwarded on Thursday morning to the chief
executives of the companies affected ''as a courtesy'' 24 hours ahead of
the scheduled release time.
But rumours started circulating in the stock market early on Thursday
that the price review was not going to be as onerous as feared, causing
big rises in the companies' shares of up to 4%. In the afternoon the
regulator was forced to release his report at the request of the Stock
Exchange.
Stock market dealers said it was naive of the Office of Electricity
Regulation, or Offer, to expect there would not be a leak of such
sensitive information in the circumstances. Yesterday it transpired that
the Stock Exchange had earlier warned it not to release any copies of
the review early.
Mr O'Neill said the head of Offer had made one mistake too many.
''I think considering everything that's happened the only reasonable
thing the man can do is throw in the towel,'' he said.
''We have accused him of being naive in the past and he will not
learn. He should go, and the regulatory system should be overhauled.''
The Stock Exchange chief executive, Mr Michael Lawrence, earlier told
BBC Radio: ''There were discussions between us and Offer on Wednesday of
this week, when they indicated to us that they would be releasing copies
24 hours in advance.
''We actually said that worried us. We said to release it so far ahead
gave us cause for concern.''
Prices in electricity companies south of the Border continued to rise
yesterday as takeover bids became increasingly likely.
Northern gained 20p to register a rise on the week of 64p; South
Western showed an 18% rise on the week; and Midlands 15%.
ScottishPower yesterday put on 3p, and Hydro-Electric 5p.
Professor Littlechild was involved in controversy about the release of
a statement earlier this year. At the time of the Government electricity
share sale in March he provoked fury among investors by announcing out
of the blue that he was looking at electricity prices again, just seven
months after his previous review. This caused the new shares to fall in
price soon after they began trading.
Now the Stock Exchange is investigating Thursday's share movements.
Its findings will be passed to the Department of Trade and Industry,
which will then decide if there is enough evidence of insider dealing to
mount prosecutions.
The Trade and Industry Secretary, Mr Ian Lang, was urged by his
Shadow, Mr Brian Wilson, to set up his own investigation into the
matter.
''It is bizarre that in the name of courtesy this highly sensitive
information should be issued in advance to those most directly affected.
The idea that they need 24 hours to prepare their responses is naive, to
say the least,'' Mr Wilson said.
''In this case there has been massive abuse which has allowed fortunes
to be made on the back of the the regulator's action. That is not just a
matter for the Stock Exchange, but also for the Government who appoints
these regulators.''

EXCLUSIVE
BRITISH Telecom was accused yesterday of raising the charges on cheap
rate calls by up to 24%, while claiming most calls under its new pricing
structure would come down in price or stay the same.
The accusation was levelled by a Scots businessman who makes much use
of the telephone in his computer software company.
Mr Stephen Wilson, who runs Enterprise Computer Software in Glasgow,
said he had looked forward to a big drop in his quarterly bill when BT
introduced its new pricing structure on June 28.
In advance of that date, a BT press release had said: ''Most calls
will either come down in price or cost the same. However, some types of
calls of specific duration might cost slightly more.''
Mr Wilson said: ''I was led to believe from BT advertising that the
price of weekday evening calls, when I make a lot of use of the phone,
would be coming down with the introduction of a charging policy based on
split-second timing rather than units.
''In its advertising BT likes to quote the cost of both three minute
and five minute calls. If you look at the three minute call it actually
remains the same price. However, the five minute call is cheaper by 20%.
But this is fool's gold.
''The cost of a 44-minute weekday evening call has gone up by a
staggering 24%, while the cost of a 29-minute weekday evening call has
gone up by 23%. The same increases, for example, apply to 33-minute and
55-minute calls.''
Mr Wilson said he had tabulated weekday evening calls ranging from one
to 60 minutes. The cost of seven calls had remained the same, while
three had actually fallen. However, the remaining 50 calls had gone up
from between 3% to 24%.
''I would hardly call these small increases,'' he said. ''I believe
that BT may have made a genuine mistake with this one and may well be
prepared to reconsider given sufficient prompting from the press. If
not, I intend raising the matter with Oftel, the telephone regulator.
''People in the UK have been schooled to use the phone after 6pm
because it is supposed to be cheaper, but I wonder how they will feel
now when they see these figures.
''BT has Bob Hoskins on TV saying it is good to talk. The implication
of one of his adverts is that you should . . . stay on longer, but the
longer you are on the higher the price hike. This flies in the face of
the argument that you should be talking longer.
''In the US, customers with A T &amp; T can get local calls for 10 cents,
about 6p. This is regardless of duration so the price is the same for
one minute or three hours. Obviously, privatised BT has some work to do
before it can compete in the land of the free.''
The charges were also condemned by MP Nigel Griffiths, Labour's
consumer affairs spokesman. He said the costs played a cruel trick on
senior citizens and people who rely on doing business in off-peak times
to keep costs down.
Mr Griffiths, who has championed the consumer by campaigning for lower
charges and itemised bills, added: ''I will be raising the matter with
Oftel and Ian Lang at his new post at Trade and Industry. I would urge
BT to bring these hidden charges down.''
Last night, BT responded by saying customers were being given a much
better deal. A spokesman said that under the new policy of pricing calls
per second the UK would save #310m. In Scotland, the figure for savings
was #35m.
He said: ''We've pitched these cuts exactly where they'll benefit our
customers most -- on short, popular duration calls and local calls.
''Some calls will cost a little more but once you add in the cost of
the cheaper calls, the net effect is a 5% reduction in your overall
bill.
''A tin of beans may be cheaper at one supermarket than another, but
this doesn't mean that the one with the cheap beans is cheapest overall.
You have to look in your shopping basket at the end of the day.''

SAFEWAY poisoner Dr Paul Agutter, jailed for 12 years for a plot to
murder his wife, was rightly convicted, three appeal court Judges ruled
yesterday.
Lord Ross, the Lord Justice Clerk, sitting with Lords Johnston and
Murray in the Court of Criminal Appeal, ruled that Agutter did not
suffer a miscarriage of justice.
They rejected his appeal against conviction, and an appeal against
sentence was abandoned.
In February this year, Agutter, 48, was convicted of attempting to
murder his wife, Alex, at their home in Athelstaneford, East Lothian, by
putting a massive dose of the deadly posion, atropine, in a gin and
tonic.
A jury at the High Court in Edinburgh also found him guilty of placing
bottles of tonic contaminated with the poison on shelves of the Safeway
supermarket at Hunters' Tryst, New Swanston, Edinburgh, four days
earlier.
Several Safeway customers became violently ill after drinking from the
contaminated bottles, and shelves were cleared in a nationwide safety
alert.
Agutter claimed that he had innocently bought from Safeway the tonic
which poisoned his wife, but the jury believed the prosecution case that
he had contaminated the Safeway tonic in an attempt to throw police off
the trail of the murder plot.
Yesterday, Mr Neil Murray, QC, defence counsel, asked the Court of
Criminal Appeal to quash the conviction.
He argued that Lord Morison, the trial judge, had failed to give
adequate and full directions to the jury over a conflict of evidence on
the concentration of atropine in Mrs Agutter's gin and tonic.
An ambulanceman who took 39-year-old Mrs Agutter to hospital had
placed in a jam jar the gin and tonic along with ice cubes and lemon
that she had been drinking from before she became violently ill.
Analysis of the drink revealed that there was a much higher level of
atropine in Mrs Agutter's drink than found in bottles bought from
Safeway by members of the public. The Crown's case was that the only
person who could have been responsible for the increased concentration
of poison was Dr Agutter.
In the police forensic laboratory the liquid had been poured into
another container, but when this was produced during the trial, there
was no sign of the lemon, raising doubt as to whether it was in fact Mrs
Agutter's drink. There was also a question-mark over the label
identifying the liquid, raising the question of whether there had been a
break in the chain of evidence.
Lord Ross said that although the trial judge had pointed out the
problems for the Crown, and warned the jury that they must be careful
about this evidence, Mr Murray argued that he had not gone far enough.
In effect, he claimed that Lord Morison should have gone further and
directed the jury to discount this evidence.
However, Lord Ross said the appeal court was quite satisfied that the
directions given by the trial judge were entirely adequate.
''He drew the jury's attention expressly to these difficulties for the
Crown and we are quite satisfied there there is no substance in this
ground of appeal.''
It was also noted that, apart from the analysis, there was other
substantial evidence that the gin and tonic given to Mrs Agutter
contained a much higher level of atropine than the bottles bought from
Safeway by the other members of the public.
The evidence against Agutter was circumstantial, but there was a large
body of circumstantial evidence pointing to his guilt, the appeal court
decided.

THE bulk of the membership of the main rail union RMT has rejected
joining Aslef drivers in a series of one-day strikes over a ''final'' 3%
pay offer.
This leaves Aslef drivers largely isolated, although London
Underground employees look set to embark on a parallel dispute in
protest at their 2.75% final offer. But this should have little initial
effect on the series of 24-hour stoppages Aslef plans to start next
Friday.
By voting down strike action the RMT members have bolstered British
Rail's resolve to stand firm, and last night personnel director Paul
Watkinson said it was now essential that Aslef reconsiders its position.
He had requested an urgent meeting with it to make it clear that the
proposed strike action would be futile.
''The only sensible way to avoid damage to their own members'
long-term interests is to accept the 3% and call off the strikes,'' he
said.
In a complex set of ballot results announced last night, RMT members
at three small BR subsidiaries voted for strike action but the main rail
grades voted against.
Railtrack signal workers who staged their own damaging pay dispute
last summer voted 2-1 against action, and as a result RMT will now
settle on their behalf.
In the light of the confused situation, RMT general secretary Jimmy
Knapp said his executive would reconvene on Monday to reconsider the
situation at BR.
However, London Underground members who voted heavily for strike
action are being called out for 24 hours from 7.30pm on Wednesday, July
26, to coincide with the anticipated strike action by their Aslef
colleagues on London Underground, who are still balloting.
Mr Knapp declared himself disappointed with the overall outcome of the
ballots, which he put down in part to intimidation of his members, many
of whom had been subjected to one-to-one interviews with managers who
had threatened victimisation in the event of a strike vote.
The ballot results did not mean that RMT members on BR were happy to
swallow a 3% increase. Reports indicated that while there was deep
dissatisfaction with a pay offer which meant a reduction in living
standards, there was also growing concern that the industry was being
destroyed by the Government's unworkable privatisation policy, which
could see thousands of further job losses.
Members were deeply concerned about their future job security and the
effect privatisation might have on their conditions at work, said Mr
Knapp.
He also complained at the fragmentation of the industry which meant
that RMT was obliged to conduct six ballots with its BR membership as
opposed to one in the past. In addition, 16 vested companies had to be
given details of the ballots separately.
''If nothing else, this demonstrates the massive changes that are
taking place inside the industry at an enormous cost both in financial
and efficiency terms. The concept of a national, unified railway has
disappeared.''

<TEXT>
PRIVATISATION of Rosyth Dockyard in Fife is still the Government's
preferred option, with a decision due within a crucial three months for
the complex.
Scottish Office Industry Minister George Kynoch, who visited Rosyth
yesterday, said he recognised it was an important employer and also
important to Fife, but would not be drawn on whether its present
management would take over.
Mr Kynoch added that his visit was to examine diversification work now
being done at the yard, and talk to senior management of Babcock Rosyth
Defence Ltd, which he praised for taking on new areas of interest.
He said: ''I have not been disappointed in what I have seen. There are
clearly opportunities, there is enthusiasm, and a management in place to
take the dockyard forward.
''I now have a broad picture of what is going on here, along with the
economic prospects for the Kingdom of Fife, and I believe Babcock are
making a significant contribution.''
Questioned on the possibility of Babcock taking over the dockyard as a
private concern -- a decision is expected by the end of August -- the
Minister said: ''We believe privatisation is the preferred option, but
it is a complex procedure and that is a matter for the Ministry of
Defence, who are looking at the situation, and we will know in due
course.''
Later, Mr David Batty, managing director of Babcock Rosyth Defence
Ltd, said negotiations with the MoD were progressing satisfactorily, and
that he was pleased with the present workload at the yard, which
included extended submarine work.
''All the signs are that we have cause to be optimistic about our
future. In terms of major decisions, this is a key month.''
Mr Batty admitted that there were concerns from the workforce -- 3500
at Scotland's biggest single industrial site -- but said it was hoped
when the future for the yard was known, fears could be allayed.
He added that confirmation was expected soon that Rosyth would be
awarded the refit of the Type 42 destroyer, HMS Newcastle, part of the
allocated surface ship refitting programme it was given after losing the
Trident nuclear submarine refitting work awarded to the Devonport yard
at Plymouth.

<HEADLINE>Emma Humphreys freed in landmark ruling. Killer offers support to other victims</HEADLINE>

EMMA Humphreys, the former teenage prostitute who spent 10 years in
jail for murdering her violent partner, walked free yesterday after a
landmark ruling by three Appeal Court judges.
Amid euphoric scenes over the court's decision to replace her murder
conviction with one of manslaughter, Ms Humphreys vowed to fight for
other women jailed in similar circumstances.
The ruling led to calls for a new defence of ''self preservation'' to
protect wives and lovers driven to kill. Campaigners hope for a spin-off
benefit for all women currently in prison.
After the court ordered her immediate release, 27-year-old Ms
Humphreys broke down in tears and said she would help victims of the
kind of brutal behaviour she endured from drug addict Mr Trevor
Armitage. It included verbal abuse, beatings and rapes when she would
not submit to sex.
In court, appeal judges Lord Justice Hirst, Mr Justice Kay and Mr
Justice Cazalet ruled the jury at her 1985 Nottingham Crown Court trial
was misdirected on the question of provocation.
After reading prison and medical reports, the judges decided that Ms
Humphreys was guilty of manslaughter and should be freed at once.
They heard that she killed Mr Armitage at his Nottingham home with a
single thrust of a kitchen knife after living with him for six months.
Ms Julie Bindel, spokeswoman for Justice for Women, which backed
yesterday's appeal, said: ''There are 70 women like Emma in prisons
across England and Wales and we want the Home Secretary to review all of
them.''
The law should be changed to include ''a new defence of
self-preservation,'' added Ms Bindel, into whose care Ms Humphreys has
been released.
Dr Liz Kelly, whose evidence helped free her, said Ms Humphreys spent
much of her childhood seeing her mother abused and was herself abused as
a child prostitute. She was gang raped and later brutalised by the man
she turned to for help and eventually killed.
Lord Justice Hirst described in court how, on the night in February
1985 when Mr Armitage, 33, met his death, he had been drinking with
three other men and his son. He said they would be all right for ''a
gang bang'', upsetting Ms Humphreys, then just 17 years old, who was
refusing him sex.
Later that night, dressed in nothing but his shirt, he taunted her for
making a ''pathetic'' job of slashing her wrists as she sat on the
landing.
Lord Justice Hirst said the trial judge had failed properly to direct
the jury on the cumulative effect on Ms Humphreys of the ''continuing
cruelty'' she received from ''jealous and possessive'' Mr Armitage.
Mr Justice Jones had also given a ''fundamentally flawed'' direction
when he told the jury to ignore features of Ms Humphreys' ''abnormal
personality'', including her immaturity and attention-seeking habit of
cutting her wrists, when considering the question of provocation.
As she was led out of court Ms Humphreys smiled nervously at people
clapping at the back of the packed court.
She said later her release after 10 years in jail had still not sunk
in but ''it was always in my heart that it was not murder but
manslaughter''.
Now she would fight for her friend Sara Thornton, who is still in
Holloway jail and appealing against a life sentence for murdering her
husband.
Labour MP Harry Cohen, who has campaigned for a change in the law on
provocation, welcomed Ms Humphreys' release.
He said 87 MPs from all parties, had signed his Commons motion calling
for women who had suffered domestic violence, abuse and fear to be
released.
Lord Ackner, a cross-bencher and recently retired Lord of Appeal who
also believes the law should changed, told BBC Radio 4's The World at
One: ''In so far as the Court of Appeal said the judge misdirected the
jury, it does not sound to me as if they have suggested any new law.
''(The trial judge) got the existing law wrong -- which brings one
back to this constant attempt to get away from the crime of murder and
try and get it reduced to manslaughter on very fine distinctions.
''The House of Lords in its legislative capacity has tried again and
again to get the law changed, but the Government won't have it.''
Home Secretary Michael Howard, asked whether there was now a case for
a new law on self-preservation as well as for looking again at the
mandatory life sentence for murder, said: ''I have not yet had an
opportunity to look at the judgments in this case, far less to study
them.''

A FRAIL pensioner was left for dead after being savagely beaten by a
bogus home-help whom she allowed into her Edinburgh council home.
Mrs Margaret Morton, 83, had a piece of material placed over her head
by the woman and was punched and kicked so violently she suffered an
angina attack.
She is being detained in hospital where her condition was described
yesterday as stable.
Detectives said the attack in a cul-de-sac at Clermiston Crescent on
Thursday was ''horrific''. They believe Mrs Morton could have died had
she not been able to pull a cord to activate an alarm linked to a mobile
warden.
They warned that the viciousness of the incident showed they were
dealing with a desperate person.
The attacker had identified herself as a home-help to gain access.
While pretending to write a shopping list in the living room, she
suddenly became aggressive, demanded money, and began slapping Mrs
Morton.
Police believe the woman, who left empty-handed, panicked and fled
when Mrs Morton appeared to show signs of a heart attack.
Mrs Morton's home is one of a row of seven cottages which are normal
local authority tenancies but have alarm systems linked to the warden
service.
Detective Inspector Bob Bell said he believed that without the alarm
Mrs Morton could have suffocated. He said: ''It contributed hugely to
saving her life. She had been badly beaten.''
He added that detectives were looking at recent incidents in West
Lothian and the Borders when a woman of similar description sought
access to houses.
The victim's sister, Mrs May Baxter, spoke last night of the family's
shock.
''How anyone can pick on an old woman living by herself is beyond
me.''
The assailant is described as aged 20-35, 5ft 3ins to 5ft 6ins tall,
of slim build, and with dark straight hair.

SCIENTISTS are to try to create ''no-go'' zones for the midge. They
believe they might have discovered a solution to the plague that
afflicts millions outdoors every year.
Trials with a tiny worm-like creature which devours midge larvae are
to be carried out on the west coast next week.
If successful, midge-free zones could be created by the microscopic
nematodes -- highly specific parasites -- without harmful side-effects
for the environment.
Mr Stewart Heritage, of the Forestry Commission, which is funding the
project jointly with Dundee University, said: ''We will not be
attempting to eradicate the midge, but to develop methods for creating
midge-free zones within limited areas such as camping sites, villages,
and tourist spots.''
Nematodes are used extensively by farmers to prevent crop damage from
other insects, and are readily available in pellet form.
In the trials, they will be put in nothing more sophisticated than
watering cans and sprinkled on to patches of damp ground where larvae
breed.
Research by Alison Blackwell at Dundee University's Department of
Biological Sciences has shown that although swarms of the insect fly in
damp conditions, they do not migrate more than 100 metres.
Mr Heritage said: ''This means that we only need to target a limited
area for spraying to create the midge-free zones. They could make a real
difference to the tourist industry.''

<PAGE>3</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977502445</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Scottish Office is considering a plan to use a contraceptive drug
to control Scotland's grey seal population.
The drug has been developed by a Canadian team led by Dr Don Bowen at
Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, which has been testing the
immuno-contraceptive on Sable Island since 1992.
It is seen as a humane alternative to seal culling, which was halted
in 1978 after a concerted campaign by animal welfare groups. The drug is
administered in pellets which are fired into female seals.
Scottish fishermen have been pressing for urgent steps to control seal
numbers, claiming that the seals consume more fish than the entire
British fishing fleet catches in a year.
There were over 30,000 grey seals around Scotland in the 1970s. This
rose to over 60,000 when the official culling -- carried out by marksmen
-- ended in 1978 because of high-profile disruption of culls by animal
rights protesters around Orkney.
The Scottish Office has now commissioned a report on the contraceptive
drug from zoologist Professor Paul Racey at Aberdeen University. He has
been asked to look at a range of ''non-lethal'' ways of curbing the
growth of the seal population.
The move was welcomed by SNP leader Alex Salmond yesterday, whose
Buchan constituency includes the port of Peterhead.
He said: ''The seals are threatening the viability of one of
Scotland's key industries. History has told us that seal culls are not
an acceptable way of controlling the animals' population to the general
public.
''If there is now a more humane way of doing it then let us give it a
trial as soon as possible. The Scottish Office should act immediately.''
Dr Bowen has reported that between 85% and 90% of seals darted by the
contraceptive pellets fail to calve.

A COUNCIL leader yesterday criticised Safeway for offering #300,000 to
improve playing fields if a rival retailer failed in its application to
build a store there.
Mr Angus Graham, vice-convener of the Western Isles Council, said the
council had responded to the offer ''with the contempt it deserved''.
But the supermarket company last night denied that it had acted
improperly in any way.
Councillor Graham said a letter from Safeway, offering the money to
redevelop the Macaulay Road playing fields in Stornoway, had been
received just before committee meetings to consider an application from
the Co-op for a #5m superstore on the site.
That application was ultimately successful three weeks ago, with the
Co-op agreeing to pay #1m for the loss of the playing field and to
develop other leisure facilities, including a library, for the town.
The Co-op currently has two stores in Stornoway but will shut the
larger one when the new store opens next year. Safeway also has two
shops in the town, both operating under the Presto name.
Councillor Graham said he intended to make public the letter the
council had received from Safeway. ''People can then make up their own
minds whether it was a reasonable offer or not.''
But Safeway spokesman Mr Peter Sitch said last night that there was
nothing irregular about the offer it had made.
''We resent any implication that this was somehow a back-door deal. We
do not believe we acted improperly in any way. We simply gave the
council a greater option about what they might do with that site.''
After receiving an initial reply from the council, the company had
taken legal advice and the advice was that its offer had been proper.
A Co-op spokeswoman said last night: ''We would not want to comment on
any action allegedly undertaken by any other retailer. We are just
delighted that we have planning permission.''

POLICE investigating the death of a hospital patient after a routine
operation had evidence withheld, it emerged yesterday.
The hosital had also failed to circulate a bulletin about safety
measures for the equipment used in the operation.
Sheriff Robin McEwan said in his determination after a fatal accident
inquiry in Ayr that it was beyond his comprehension why senior members
of staff should have decided to withhold evidence.
Divorcee Catriona Henderson, 34, a mother of two, of Barnsheen Avenue,
Patna, Ayrshire, lapsed into unconsciousness after a gall bladder
operation at Ayr Hospital on August 25, 1993. She was taken to Glasgow's
Southern General Hospital, where she died five days later without
recovering consciousness.
Sheriff McEwan found that she died as a result of hypoxic brain damage
after an overdose of the painkiller Fentanyl, which was being
administered to her through a syringe pump at the time of her collapse.
He found that the syringe had been incorrectly resited into the pump,
allowing an uncontrolled quantity of the painkiller to flow into the
patient.
A Safety Action Bulletin about the pump had reached the South Ayrshire
Hospital Trust. But it was never circulated to nursing staff, and in
fact was seen by only five people at the hospital.
Sheriff McEwan found that the hospital had not taken reasonable
precautions to set up a proper system for the circulation of such
bulletins and drawing them to the attention of nursing staff.
He said: ''Such a precaution would have been reasonable at the time
and might have avoided the accident resulting in the death.''
He also said that the system of training nurses in the use of the
syringe pump was ''vague and unstructured''.
There was no system of checking whether a nurse was competent to use
the equipment. He also found that the keeping of records of narcotics
was ''careless and haphazard''.
On the day after Mrs Henderson's collapse Matron Mary Jones and Mr
George McLauchlan, director of nursing, were shown the latest Safety
Action Bulletin on pumps by Senior Nurse Mary McGinn. Neither had seen
it before.
When police arrived at the hospital on the same day they discovered
that material evidence had either been destroyed, removed, or
dismantled, and they found it very difficult to get clear information
from staff.
The sheriff said: ''Faced with that it is not in the least surprising
that crime was suspected.'' He recalled that about that time there had
been national publicity over a nurse in England who had murdered or
assaulted several babies under her care.
Next day, he said, two nurses, Lorraine Skinner, 28, and Lyndsay
Kirkwood, 35, were subjected quite properly to a very long interview.
The sheriff said: ''From what the matron (who was present) said I am
certain that it was an experience neither of these young women will ever
forget.''
He singled out for special criticism the decision of Mr McLaughlan not
to tell police of the bulletin as it was ''not important''.
Solicitor Jim Pettigrew, who acted for Mrs Henderson's children
throughout the lengthy inquiry, said yesterday that he would now raise
an action for damages against South Ayrshire NHS Hospitals Trust.
The dead patient's MP, Mr George Foulkes, said that he had spoken to
both the trust's chairman, Mr Douglas Brown, and its medical director,
Mr Campbell Ferguson. He had demanded action to ensure that such an
incident would never be repeated, disciplining of any management
failures, and an unreserved apology to Mrs Henderson's family with an
offer of substantial compensation for her death.
Mr Brown said in a statement: ''The personal distress of staff
immediately involved has been very considerable.'' The hospital had
amended procedures.Sheriff McEwan, in his findings, contrasted the
submissions of the other parties involved in the inquiry with that of
Mrs Henderson's father.
He said that submissions from the others were designed to exclude them
from any responsibility. Mr McKinnon made his own submission ''with his
common sense highlighted on a single sheet of paper''.
The sheriff said: ''His plea for his dead child was made more in
sorrow than in anger, and at times he was not able fully to trust his
voice. I have to commend his effort.''

EXCLUSIVE
SEVEN Customs and Excise offices in Scotland are to be axed, with a
further eight earmarked for closure, dealing ''a crippling blow'' to the
men in the vanguard of the fight against drugs and VAT fraud, it was
claimed last night.
The cuts, according to union leaders, will leave only three offices to
cover the most remote areas of the Scottish coast against drug smugglers
and give a hollow ring to Chancellor's Kenneth Clarke's promise to give
officers ''all possible support in this work''.
Other proposals, according to leaders of the National Union of Civil
and Public Servants, will lead to an upsurge in VAT fraud by creating
''a charter for cheats''. Yet others call for officers to work from home
after their offices are closed in what the union said was a ''Heath
Robinson'' arrangement.
The plans, which have been laid before the NUCPS, put the flesh on the
bones of proposals to cut 4000 Customs and Excise jobs in the UK,
including 600 anti-drugs officers, signalled by Mr Clarke in his Budget
speech last November. Over the next four years Scotland's 1650-strong
force is scheduled to fall by between 350 and 400.
Last night Mr Bill Johnston, NUCPS representative, said the proposals
were based on political dogma which ''says we should have a smaller
Civil Service and are nothing to do with effectiveness or efficiency''.
Mr Johnston said they had been told that seven offices would close at
Hamilton (with the loss of 23 jobs), Kirkcaldy (14), Stirling (12),
Galashiels (10), Newton Stewart (five), Peterhead (three), and Montrose
(two).
Eight others had been earmarked for closure at Invergordon (eight),
Wick (eight), Kirkwall (six), Campbeltown (five), Islay (four), Fort
William (four), and Portree (one), when their leases run out or staff
leave.
He said that the most worrying aspect for the men at the sharp end of
the war against drugs was that the proposals left only Oban, Ullapool,
and Inverness to cover the whole of the most remote areas of the
Scottish coast using mobile phones.
The department had decided to concentrate its efforts against drugs on
the south coast of England. Mr Johnston said: ''The drug barons will
then go in by the back door. Only today two tonnes of cannabis was
seized in North Wales. Scotland could easily become the back door for
Europe's drugs.''
The plans are not without their element of farce. Staff whose offices
are closed will be given the option of working from home.
Mr Johnston said: ''Given that our department collects something like
45% of the money coming into the Treasury it is a bit ridiculous to
think that we can't afford offices for our staff.''
The union said management had also proposed that VAT officers should
not visit traders whose turnover is less than #100,000 a year.
The majority of jobs to go will involve VAT staff. Yet, according to
Mr Johnston, each officer currently brings in 10 times his salary.
''They are paid about #27,000 a year yet return about #225,000 each.''
Last night Customs and Excise confirmed the closures apart from
Peterhead and Montrose. It refused to discuss other matters saying it
was too early to go into details.

Which releases are worth listening to and and which are not? The
Herald reviewers reveal all about the latest sounds.
Introduction, Rejuvination (Soma)
* UNINSISTENT but still propulsive, Rejuvination's debut album is all
soft washes of sound, plangent tinkles, and inventive beats. The last
time I reviewed one of Soma's products -- unfavourably, it should be
pointed out -- I was rewarded with a very long, very angry telephonic
tirade from Soma's Glasgow HQ. Phone me up and thank me this time,
fellas: everyone should introduce themselves to Rejuvination a.s.a.p.
Freska 2, various artists (React)
* A COLLECTION of 12 upliftingly-mindless examples of happy-clappy
dance-pop robo-thumpery, selected by leading Nu-NRG DJ Rachel Auburn.
Livin' Joy's Dreamer is the only big chart hit among them, but every
track is guaranteed to have you a-boppin' and a-hoppin' with gay
abandon.
Permanent, Joy Division (London)
* SEVEN songs from the two albums recorded during Joy Division's
all-too-brief lifespan, plus three singles, and three tracks from Still,
the posthumous assembly of Joy Division studio out-takes and live cuts.
What do you get? Edgy slashes of guitar; vaulting bass-lines which nag
and cajole; neurotic vocal declamations full of poetic grace. What
should you do? Buy this and indulge the alienated adolescent gloomster
who dwells deep within every soul.
DAVID BELCHER
Holst: The Planets (Deutsche Grammophon)
* POLYMATH John Eliot Gardiner's new recording of The Planets with the
Philharmonia is electrifying. 'Nuff said. But get this disc for the
filler, Percy Grainger's sensational orchestral extravaganza, The
Warriors: 18 minutes of absolute Stravinskian bedlam -- big orchestra,
three pianos, a platoon of percussion. This rarity would make an
electrifying concert piece. It depicts warriors at rest, at play, and in
a series of orgies that will knock your socks off. Turn the volume up
and prepare to be astonished. Hugely original, totally lunatic, great
fun.
Beethoven: Piano Concertos 4 and 5 (Deutsche Grammophon)
* FROM a new DG series called ''The Originals'' -- a set of seminal
recordings that made the yellow label's reputation -- come two of the
all-time great recordings of Beethoven's last two piano concertos.
Wilhelm Kempff made Beethoven sing like no-one before or since; he
didn't have a crude sound in his fingers or soul. I was bowled over by
these when they were first issued, nearly 35 years ago, and, with the
Berlin Phil in mellow form under Ferdinand Leitner, they remain genuine
classics. The CDs in this series are, nattily, ''blacked up'' to look
like miniatures of the old vinyls. Hear it and weep (with joy).
MICHAEL TUMELTY
Love and Peace, Dee Dee Bridgewater (Verve)
* ANYONE worrying whither jazz singing now that Ella et al have left
the scene should check out this tribute to Horace Silver. Adding to the
brace on 1993's superb Keeping Tradition, Bridgewater sings 13 concisely
arranged Silver songs (two featuring his own sparkling piano playing)
with absolute assurance, unstoppable vitality and an innate sense of
style.
So Far, Ian F Benzie (Lochshore)
* OLD Blind Dogs' singer/guitarist traces 30 years of singing
traditional and contemporary folk-songs on an enjoyable if variable
collection. His richly expressive voice is most effective on songs from
his native north-east and The Braes O' Gight and  The Laird of Drum are
particularly strong performances.
ROB ADAMS
West Side Story (Showtime!)
* LOW budget but high entertainment. This is a hugely enjoyable
production of the Leonard Bernstein musical, as performed by the cast of
the Leicester Haymarket Theatre and the National Symphony Orchestra in
1993. Everyone will already have favourites from the score, but this
cast breathes new life into them, not least the exhilarating,
whoop-inducing, America and the spine-tinglingly poignant Somewhere.

It takes courage to throw caution to the wind. Kennedy Wilson
considers the virtues of boldly going for a bright colour.
* THE red room is a classic interior. Warm and festive, the red room
is great for parties and entertaining. Yellow, black or gold used in
combination with red can be most dramatic. The trouble is getting the
right red. A rich burgundy is preferable to a vibrant pillar box.
Red is redolent of plush restaurants and theatres and gives a warm,
luxurious feel to a room. Red is also related to the grandeur of royal
palaces. With white ceiling and woodwork the effect can be striking --
more so than for almost any other colour combination. If that is too
stark, try a soft creamy beige or tobacco colours.
''My own drawing room has got a red, yellow and blue scheme that's
dramatic and French looking,'' says interior designer Joanna Macrae, who
runs Northwood Designs near Auchterarder. ''Red is a colour I use quite
a lot, there's so much you can do with it in terms of fabrics, paint and
carpeting, partly because I find it exciting and terribly opulent. You
can get a rich feeling with red, it's a lovely dining room colour.''
Red has associations with womb-like security and warmth, although red
carpets should never be used in a red room. It's almost impossible to
match two reds, and the overall effect would be too overpowering, like
sitting inside a hot water tank.
The best colour for floor coverings would be dark grey or olive green.
A red room is always welcoming, never cold, and red is the ideal colour
for a room with a lot of cold northern light. The welcoming nature of
red means that it's particularly good for halls -- the hallway of 10
Downing Street was painted bright red during Margaret Thatcher's
administration.
Psychological tests have shown that when offered a palette of
different colours people often chose red as their favourite. Research
has also shown that exposure to the colour red can increase blood
pressure, heighten pulse rates and stimulate brain waves. Vivacious
Nancy Reagan's favourite colour was red and she always had official
photographs taken in the Red Room in the White House.
A red room is enlivening, not relaxing. Some people find it difficult
to relax in a red room while for others with a bold, theatrical and
confident attitude red is the only colour; so unlike insipid neutral
backgrounds. Red is particularly good for a large room as it makes the
walls ''advance'' and seem cosier. Some people criticise red as an
unsuitable colour for displaying pictures, but gilded frames always work
well on a red backdrop.
Famed decorator David Hicks' most famous project was for an apartment
in the Albany, a posh London apartment building. It had a bright red
bedroom including a four-poster bed with red hangings.
Lighting can be particularly important in a red room. You get a better
glow from red than you would from a dark blue or dark green. Although
red is bright, it absorbs light and therefore requires fairly high
levels of light. Red rooms look best with table lamps with large white
shades which illuminate the red with cool clear white light.
Red was the first pigment used by man to decorate his abode. In the
famous caves in Altamira in Northern Spain, murals done around 12,000BC
predominantly used red. Ancient Egyptians, Greeks and Romans used red in
their home interiors and temples. The Sphinx at Giza once had a red
face.
Many Greek and Roman sites were not white, unadorned marble but
painted in lavish hues of red -- this red colour scheme can still be
seen on the pillars of the Minoan palace at Knossos on Crete.
''Red has to be carefully used,'' says Joanna Macrae. ''You've got to
know what you're doing when you use red because it's a strong statement
and you can go very wrong.''

* IF you are proud of how your garden has grown but still realise that
there is trimming to be done, keeping records is a sound idea. Make
notes, or have a loaded camera to hand, especially for shrubs or
anything particularly colourful.
There is sure to be hedging work at the moment. It could be beech,
privet or others. A formula that saves a lot of time and effort is to
use an electric cutter with a safety cut-off.
Lift the trimmings with a Flymo Garden-Vac. It gets the job done
quickly and efficiently. It also surprises the neighbours to see you
vacuuming the garden.
Many people try growth-retarding materials such as Cutlass. They say
it reduces the number of times you have to cut hedges. It sounds
tempting.
This is the time to colour up hydrangeas, to make them blue if
desired. There is a misconception about the business, however.
Pink ones flourish in alkaline soil and blue in acid. There are
certain varieties which can be coloured. Others resist it.
All you do is make the soil more acid. Aluminium sulphate is the
chemical. Failing that, iron filings seem to work fine.
In the vegetable garden, now is the time to make plans for winter.
This includes January king cabbage, purple sprouting broccoli, and late
crops of leeks.
You may have difficulty getting these items now. Shop around. If you
are very quick off the mark, you can still raise your own winter, or
indeed spring, crops.
Meanwhile, check on your plants and whether they are needing watered.
This means lawns, bedding plants, newly-planted shrubs, fruit, and
vegetables.
Some people claim to get better results by mulching moisture-loving
crops such as runner beans with grass cuttings. This is fine, if you
don't mind a crop of grass weeds later on.
What not to do is to use grass cuttings for mulching where the lawn
has recently been treated with hormone weedkiller. That can be dangerous
for plants.

* GARDENERS across the country have been invaded by aphids. These are
winged or wingless pests commonly known as greenfly. They attack a wide
range of plants at all stages of growth, in the open and in the
greenhouse.
They may be green, black or some other colour and there are a number
of different species, with life cycles that may be very complicated.
Basically, they start life as eggs laid on host plants which hatch to
immature females called nymphs, which grow and shed their skins, finally
becoming wingless adults.
They are called viviparous, which means they produce living young. In
time, they produce more young. Finally, winged females are produced,
which can migrate to other plants and lay eggs.
Aphids feed by sucking the sap of plants, usually attacking tender
young shoots and leaves. Various parts of plants may be affected, and
symptoms vary according to the species of aphids.
Some cause extreme leaf-curling. Others cause distortion of shoots,
stems and flowers. Some may even cause galls and swellings, while others
infect roots.
Aphids weaken plants by depriving them of valuable sap and open wounds
which can let in disease. One nasty thing they do is excrete honey dew.
This attracts sooty moulds, which also weaken and disfigure plants.
A major problem is that they can carry certain virus diseases. When
they feed on diseased plants, they carry virus-infected sap to healthy
plants.
Why there should be such a heavy infestation is linked to weather
patterns, and especially mild winters. There are always fluctuations in
numbers from year to year. This is related to numbers of predators.
Many people do not use pesticides, in case they destroy predators like
ladybirds. Use a chemical which controls only the problem pest or has a
short-term effect.
Products with pirimacarb will control only aphids and have negligible
effect on other species. Derris dust and pyrethrum, and those based on
natural fatty acids, have a short-lived effect. They are relatively
harmless to predators.
If you think aphids must be controlled at all costs, you may decide to
go for one of the wider-spectrum insecticides. Alternate sprays of
Tumble Bug and malathion can do the trick.
Tumble Bug is a systemic and contact insecticide. Malathion is contact
only. It seems also to have systemic action. At any rate, it is highly
effective used at the main seat of attack.
The effects of a bad aphid attack can be very serious. For any method
you do adopt, act swiftly, using a good pressure sprayer.

* AS you travel around this and other countries, one of the most
fascinating things to do is bedding-plant-spotting. Keep an eye open for
exotic floral displays. A combination of enthusiasm and more colourful
plant varieties, plus expert maintenance, has lifted the standard of
bedding displays. You don't need to go far afield. There are magnificent
displays in many of the Glasgow parks -- in particular at Victoria Park,
Whiteinch -- and pretty admirable shows at Renfrew and Paisley. We have
magnificent displays at Edinburgh's Princes Street Gardens and the
Duthie Park in Aberdeen; not to mention some remarkably exotic plantings
in many coastal towns such as Ayr and Dundee. In the south, holiday
towns like Blackpool, Bournemouth and Brighton seem to vie with one
another. And it all makes for great viewing. Keep your camera at the
ready. You are certain to get some wonderful pictures. Indeed, we would
be happy to see some of them here.

* MY apple trees had white patches last year, which -- I was told --
were caused by woolly aphis. I brushed them with tar oil wash, but it
did no good. I cut the branches back, and this year I still have the
same trouble. What can I do now?
* You have been troubled by little sucking pests, which secrete a
protective covering (like wool) and are very persistent. The scars and
bumps they leave can let in canker and other troubles. Try a wire brush,
and paint them with meths or an insecticide like Malathion. You may have
to ask your neighbour to do some tar oil wash in winter as well as
yourself. There are apple trees now, grafted on to resistant root stocks
-- that could be an alternative move.
* I HAVE two paeony rose plants and I want to move them to another
place in the garden. Is there any special time of year for this?
* Paeonies don't like being moved about, especially when they are well
established. In any event, the best removal time is September/October or
February/March. Prepare the new ground well. Put in compost or
well-rotted manure. Try to avoid an east-facing site. Keep the plants
from drying out, and beware of slugs: put down pellets.

Saying it with flowers? Be sure it's the right message you're sending,
warns Myra Pater.
* KINGS and commoners receive them. Ballet dancers and opera singers
are weighed down with them, and boxers, footballers and rugby players
look decidedly uncomfortable with them.
Most of us enjoy giving -- and certainly receiving -- the gift of
flowers, whether it is a single red rose, token of undying love,
ready-assembled sprays of blooms or an ornately fashioned floral
confection which threatens to topple off the coffee table.
With more outlets than ever before, not only in florists' shops but
supermarkets, corner shops, street stalls and filling stations, it's
never been simpler to pick up a posy to express your emotions.
You know exactly what you mean to say with flowers, but are your
flowers saying what you mean?
Take a typical bouquet of yellow roses and chrysanthemums, pink
larkspurs, anemones and some double dahlias. Well-presented and
sweet-scented your offering may be, but according to the symbolism of
flowers which reached its height during the Victorian era, you have just
declared the following sentiments:
Jealousy or a decrease in love, slight affection, fickleness, weakness
and instability.
Nor may a quick foray into the garden to make amends turn out
according to plan as you pick whatever comes to hand. A careless choice
could result in:
I'm being blunt (borage) and really couldn't care less (candytuft) for
you're foolish, malevolent, presumptuous and a hindrance (columbine,
lobelia, snapdragon and ox-eye daisy). And by the way, the sweet peas
mean departure, so farewell.
If all else fails, you could take a walk in the country and make a
peace offering of iris, ivy, heartsease and lily-of-the-valley, which
will smooth the path of love with the message of the iris, ivy's
declaration of friendship and fidelity, the thoughtfulness of heartsease
and a return to happiness with lily-of-the-valley.
The Victorians had a way round the occasional faux pas -- if the
bouquet offended or upset, offering it stems first would reverse the
meanings.
Just as one should beware of Greeks bearing gifts, so should one be
wary of presents of fruit, berries, vegetables and even fungi.
Eve started it all, naturally, with the apple of temptation whose
trait is more than compensated for by the generosity of oranges, the
affection of pears and the zest of lemons -- zest as in joie de vivre.
Water melons and gourds not surprisingly represent bulkiness, while the
whortleberry, bilberry and cranberry are steeped in treason, treachery
and hardness. Brambles, the most cheerful of autumn fruits, have been
unfairly accorded lowliness, envy and remorse. Persimmon, one of the
exotics now available in the supermarket, makes the rather peculiar
request -- Bury me among nature's beauties.
The cold-heartedness of lettuce, the profit of cabbage and the charity
of turnip make strange bedfellows indeed, but it should come as no
surprise that the truffle is just that -- surprise. Presumably that
refers to the high price of this commodity.
Hop, that rather useful constituent of a certain liquid refreshment,
seems unjustly named injustice; more apt, if you have ever contemplated
a fungi expedition not knowing your botelus from your amanita, is the
mushroom's moniker of suspicion.
Don't stop saying it with flowers -- just make sure they're taking the
right words out of your mouth.

* THIS water sprinkler might look like any other, but it is a
revolutionary model -- in that it uses just four litres of water an hour
compared to 900 litres for a conventional sprinkler. Developed by
Sandvik, the Pulsator achieves this remarkable water saving by means of
a special silicone membrane inside its head. A fine mist is sprayed over
a distance of up to four metres and the soil seems appreciate its
relative gentleness. The Pulsator kit costs #41.98. For more details,

If you think your own input would increase your home's vulnerability,
think again. You really can build a system from a kit, says RICHARD
SPENCER.
THE routine of arming a burglar alarm is becoming familiar to more
families every week as crime increases. There is no doubt that an alarm
does deter the opportunist thief -- the sight of the siren box is enough
to send him off in search of easier pickings -- but the it is no
substitute for more basic security measures such as effective door and
window locks.
If the insurance company demands that you have an alarm to protect
valuables, you will probably have to summon a specialist firm to put in
one with a telephone connection to a central monitoring station.
This reassurance -- and insurance cover -- will prove expensive, but
if you decide to improve your security yourself it is easy to fit an
alarm system in a few hours and at a reasonable cost.
The typical system comprises three main elements: the detectors, the
control panel and the external siren box.
Until recently the only systems available were hard-wired -- that is,
all three elements were physically connected by wires. Installing the
system took time and trouble and a little ingenuity to avoid unsightly
wires spoiling the appearance of a house.
Now home-owners have a choice because, over the last few years, new
wire-free alarms have become available. With these the detectors are
fitted with tiny transmitters which communicate by radio signal with the
central control unit. Installing these systems is obviously much simpler
but they are usually more expensive.
Whichever system you opt for, the easiest way of getting an alarm
system is to buy a kit with all the components you need included in it.
But you can also make up your own system using individual components.
That might be the best approach if you live in a an unusual property
which needs special measures to cover all areas.
The simplest kind of detector is the magnetic contact, which comes in
two parts and is fitted on doors and windows. Break the contact and the
alarm sounds.
The other main kind of detector has a passive infra-red sensor (known
as a PIR) which detects the body heat of anybody moving within the field
of view.
You can also get glass detectors which react if the window is broken,
and some systems have pressure mats which fit under the carpet and
personal alarms and panic buttons.
Fitting a hard-wired system requires careful planning. The main
problem is to choose the best route for the wire to run from the sensors
and siren box to the control unit.
Inside the house you may find that it can be tucked away out of sight
on top of picture rails, or clipped to the top of skirting boards and
around architraves. It may be possible to find a moulding with a rebate
to the top of the skirting and hide the wire inside.
No particular skill is required and most kits come with clear
instructions but the job is fiddly and requires care.
The trickiest part is fitting the siren box, which will involve you
working at the top of a high, well-secured ladder and drilling a hole
through the outside wall using a very long masonry drill.
You will need to work out where the drill will emerge inside and if
anything vulnerable -- like pipes or wires -- lies in its path.
A wire-free system poses fewer problems. You simply install the
control box and position the sensors -- with PIR detectors two should be
enough to protect an entire house.
You may have to tune the sensitivity of the sensors so that they
''see'' the whole of the area to be protected.
The only task left is to run a wire from the control box to the siren
box -- a challenge if you are to make a neat, unobtrusive job of it.
A wire-free system may also give you the option to mount a sensor in
the garage or shed to extend the protection afforded by the alarm.
Think about fitting a dummy siren box on the back of the house as a
visual reminder to burglars that you have fitted an alarm.
Then all you have to remember is to arm the alarm every time you leave
the house.

UNTIL recently, the idea of the submarine home seemed perfectly
viable. This was one of the brainwaves put forward by American research
scientist Stephen Rosen in a book called Future Facts, a forecast of the
world as we will know it before the end of the century.
As land prices soar, he said -- and he wasn't wrong about that --
people will turn to the sea for living space. His submarine home,
protected from waves and storm by being anchored under the surface,
would be topped by a floating dock for the family motorboats and a
helipad for the family choppers. Below on the seabed would be a
stabilising mat which would also become an undersea garden, attracting
plants and fish.
He didn't mention the home security angle, but just think about it.
Any landlubber whose home has been broken into, looted and vandalised,
can understandably think of little else. By moving offshore and
undersea, the suburban homesteader would at last be beyond reach of the
opportunistic pillagers and property recyclists, the people who kick
down doors and head straight for the video recorder and the low-tech
family silver.
For a start, it's probably impossible to kick in a submarine hatch,
although that's difficult to guarantee until somebody tries it. But
assuming that the hatch or the glass observation port is kickable, what
happens then? Correct: the submarine house fills with water and sinks to
the bottom, its video recorder rendered useless and its family silver
silted up. You might have lost your home, but at least nothing was
stolen.
So you could probably say that the submarine bungalow is an inviolable
proposition security-wise, although there might be some shortcomings.
One is that you'd have to wear an aqualung to weed the garden: another
is that you'd need a periscope to discover whether you were having a
nice day. But it's the current saga of the Brent Spar that throws the
whole idea into doubt.
The Brent Spar might be a funny shape, but its specification bears
more than a passing resemblance to Stephen Rosen's ideal submarine home.
Most of it floats underwater, yet it has a helideck and docking
facilities. But as we've seen, the Brent Spar can be occupied by total
strangers and can be towed away by tugs.
We anxiety-stricken landlubbers know the score. We go off on holiday
and -- all too frequently -- the back door is kicked in two nights
later. Think what it would be like to learn instead that your entire
home is being towed away into the Atlantic and sprayed with sea-water to
discourage your righteous return.
The good news, though, is that the end of this century approaches fast
without any sign that Stephen Rosen's offshore suburbs will come to
pass. Swimming across to the neighbours' for drinkie-poohs is still a
distant prospect: and this is a relief when you think of the problems of
swimming back afterwards.
The best option still lies with sound locks, good alarm systems and
watchful neighbours. The day of the housebreaker wearing flippers hasn't
arrived.

on the experience of being burgled.
* IT WAS a sunny Easter Friday afternoon. My husband and son left the
house at 2.30pm to dump garden refuse at the municipal skips. I left 10
minutes later, to visit an elderly aunt in a nursing home, carrying a
bunch of flowers.
The menfolk returned in just over an hour. The five-level lock opened
smoothly, but the small lock seemed to have jammed. With tools from the
car, they managed to free the lock and open the door. All was revealed .
. .
Cupboards and drawers lay open. The lock hadn't been jammed, the snib
had been slipped. An early warning system for the burglars. Had someone
noticed our departure? Who knows.
I returned within 10 minutes, vaguely wondering why the family rushed
out to meet me with such tenderness.
In our bedroom, the drawers on both sides of the bed had been emptied,
the bed itself had been turned over, and my jewellery box lay bare. It
wasn't Aspreys, but everything in it had been precious to me. The worst
aspect was that my mother had died about 10 weeks earlier, and her
jewellery, apart from two items -- one on me, the other in the jewellers
for repair -- had gone, along with mine. Thankfully, my rings from my
husband were on my finger.
Clearly, nothing can replace people. Possessions, at the end of the
day, are merely that. But when those we love are gone from us, things
they have owned and which were important for all sorts of reasons to
them, become objects of great sentimentality. In some strange way
comforting, a tangible link that joins us still to the one we have lost.
Silly maybe, but true. An adult comfort blanket . . .
The police weren't surprised -- as we were -- that the thieves had got
in through a small astragal window pane around 15 inches by 12 inches.
''I've seen them get in smaller than that,'' commented one.
Ironically, the house was so well locked, doors and windows with
security locks -- they were forced to leave the way they got in. At
least that restricted them to small items. But since virtually
everything they took had either been given to us by family or friends
over the years -- wedding presents, legacies, whatever, they were
irreplaceable, certainly in terms of their sentimental value.
While I felt pathetically grateful that they hadn't inflicted much in
the way of damage, indeed were quite careful -- ''professionals'', said
the police -- the rest of the family, especially the men, felt
positively murderous. For me, like most women, there was the hideous,
lingering feeling of violation.
Advice? Don't do the usual, which is to wait to be burgled before
having an alarm installed. Talk to the police, get them to conduct a
security check in your home, which they'll do free, act on their advice,
and check out a few alarm companies to find one which can give you a
good system at a competitive price.
It may not be a 100% guarantee, but at least you'll know you have put
up the maximum resistance, and made it a more dangerous task for the
opportunist -- which most thieves are -- to tackle.

* FEW of us are so foolish as to leave ladders at large in our gardens
as an invitation to the passing thief, but are we as careful with our
garden tools? ''If you want to be really helpful to the criminal
fraternity, then leave a garden spade unsecured,'' says community
policeman Willie Mair. ''It makes a great jemmy.''
The buzz-word among crime prevention officers at the moment is
''insecurities'', by which they mean the kind of soft summer target
presented by a house where the door is left unlocked, or windows are
left open, while the householder sunbathes or snoozes in the garden.
Make sure your windows cannot be opened more than 4in, which is enough
to air the house -- and that applies to third-floor windows, too.
''Professional burglars are usually specialists,'' says Willie Mair.
''Some take pride in shinning up pipes to windows on upper floors.
Others are quite brazen about daytime break-ins.''
The warning from the police is: ''Check, check, check''.

Every university in the land is plotting ways to win the battle
against insects. Joe Donnelly reports on natural methods hoped to rid
our land of the creatures.
THERE are millions of them . . . . in virtually every square mile of
land on Earth. Some scientists have worked out that their total weight
is many times that of the world's human population. They live on us and
drink our blood. They give us diseases and eat our food.
We've been at war with these aliens for a long time, and lost almost
every battle. Now it seems that every university in the land is getting
in on the fray.
A team at Glasgow's Caledonian University is helping fight the war
against insects . . . . with flowers. It's not some crazy old hippie
scientist at play. Dr Mike Hepher and his team are helping to show that
flower extracts, good natural insecticides, are ecologically sound.
Using modern synthetic compounds of the chemicals found in
Chrysanthemums, the insecticides are popular because in sunlight they
naturally degrade so that they have a limited active life and are hazard
free as long as the correct treatment times have been used.
Because of growing awareness of the environment and increasing concern
about the use of pesticides, tougher legislation has been introduced to
keep contamination to a minimum. One problem is how to monitor chemical
use and then take accurate measurements which will stand up in court.
Until now this has been slow and painstaking, involving sample
collection and hours of lab time, which means the pollution can be gone
by the time the analysis is complete, making prosecution difficult. Mike
Hepher's team has come up with a new idea that could make it easy to
kill insects and keep within the law . . . or put an instant spotlight
-- quite literally -- on the contaminators.
They discovered that most of the insecticides give off a fluorescent
light when beamed with ultra-violet radiation. When lit it can be
measured to give an accurate reading. This allows the use of advanced
opto-electric chemical sensors or real-time monitoring in the
environment. Not only can it be used on site for instant measurements of
insecticide pollution, but, as an additional bonus, if the pesticide
chemicals are added to waste holding tanks and discharge pipes, simple
UV test will immediately spot leaks of untreated waste.
The only problem with going out into the field to monitor the
situation is that there's a greater risk of getting bitten by . . . .
insects.
But hopefully they'll all be dead by then. If they're not, then it's
possible to bring up another ecological big gun to back up the
Chrysanthemum fly killers. American scientists have discovered a fungus
that's deadly to some insects.
Special formulations containing selected strains of the fungus,
Beauveria bassiana, appear to be a safe and effective control for filth
flies in dairy and poultry facilities, a study in Cornell's Veterinary
Entomology Program in New York has found. If commercially produced, the
fungal treatment could replace insecticides which are harmful to the
environment and wildlife. ''There's really nothing new about Bassiana,''
Dr Wes Watson, veterinary entomologist told us. ''It's a common
soil-inhabiting fungus that was first observed attacking silk worms, and
it caused great losses to the silk industry in the 1860s. There are
hundreds of strains of it, but few really work on house flies.''
The mould, like other pathogenic fungi, invades the fly host by
penetrating the exoskeleton or by ingestion, Watson said. Flies can pick
up fungal spores just by walking on a fungus-treated surface, and they
inadvertently spread the spores over their bodies by grooming.
Germinating fungal spores produce an enzyme that allows them to
penetrate the flies' bodies. Once inside, the fungus replicates and
consumes the insects' internal organs and blood-like fluid.
Revenge for the bites and stings. But will it work on the ferocious
Scots midgie? Bigger insects are upsetting the Forestry Commission.
They've declared war on Ips Typographus, the bark beetle which poses a
threat to more than half of Britain's coniferous forests. In the past
month or so, more than 120 beetles have been caught in special traps
using a sex attractant hormone. That compares to only 45 in 1994 and a
mere three every year in the past decade. It doesn't sound like much,
but the beetles can breed faster than rabbits and a population explosion
could devastate much of our forests.
Now forest authority inspectors are using medical technology to help
prevent the spread in infected timber. Unscrupulous exporters have been
hiding infested timber in bulk loads, but endoscopes -- camera probes
more often used to inspect internal medical problems -- are being used
on quaysides to see into the middle of packs of timber.
Using this method, they've found enough contamination to destroy 6500
cubic metres of wood -- one mature conifer is only a quarter of a cubic
metre -- from Baltic states, and turned back other infested cargoes.
On the brighter side, the insect world has provided a model for
revolutionary new ''hard-coat'' paints.
A project at Southampton University is trying to develop water-based
paints which mimic insect shells. Because the massive paint and coatings
industry is a money spinner but a major atmospheric polluter, finding
water-colours which are water-proof is a major winner.
The research team is synthesising polymers which turn themselves
inside out as they dry, giving them a tough outer coat. The idea comes
from bio-mimicry. In insect coats, nature has formed a water-based shiny
coating which starts out soft and pliable, but hardens to a tough,
impermeable shell on contact with air.
Using insect technology, we could see new chip-proof, waterproof
paints in blue-bottle blue, ladybird red, and beetle black. Next step
would be to find a way of scraping it off the wall when it dries.
Getting insects of the windscreen is bad enough.
Last word on insects. Edinburgh University psychologist Dr Barbara
Webb is studying the mating rituals of some of the noisier ones,
crickets in fact. To do this, she's designed and built her own model
cricket from Lego. It's got a computer chip for a brain, microphones for
ears and is helping her learn how females respond to a male's mating
call. Crickets rub their legs together to make a chirruping sound, which
is the apotheosis of smooth talking to a receptive female.
Dr Webb, who is studying perception mechanisms says she is
investigating comparisons between animal and robotic perception. A
particular frequency gets the computer model to sit up, take notice, and
look for some fun.
If only it was as easy as that for humans . . .
Meanwhile, FatMAN meets JANET in a new high-speed interplay by east
coast Universities, Dundee, Abertay and St Andrews.
The threesome are involved in creating a new ultra-fast computer
network called FatMAN -- Fife and Tayside Metropolitan area network,
costing more than half a million pounds. The first phase will set up new
computer links between the three universities on a fibre-optic cable.
The new links, going live in September, will let the three seats of
learning get hands on Super Janet, which should be fun for all
concerned. Super Janet, the prim will be delighted to learn, is a
development of JANET, the Joint Academic Network which provides
connections between all UK universities, research centres and the
Internet. FatMAN will apparently allow for new co-operative links
between the three scholastic centres including distance learning,
multi-media teaching, collaborative research and other functions
including electronic publishing.
The network is one of four MAN's being built by Scots universities.
The others are centred on Aberdeen, Edinburgh and of course, Glasgow,
but the eastern triumvirate will have the longest connection of its
kind. Size, it seems, counts.
FaTMAN convener, Dr Malcolm Bain, tells us: ''Scotland is leading the
way in the advanced wide area network.''
Students will now be able to work closely -- from a distance -- on
major projects. Having said that, they won't be able to access the beer
bar, which might take some of the fun out of learn by wire.
Sharp enough for the cutting edge? Pushing back the frontiers in
science, technology, research? Tell us about it. News, views and ideas
for the future to Joe Donnelly, The Herald, 195 Albion Street, Glasgow,

* THIS keyboard has not been left too close to the stove. It's that
shape because it was designed that way, and Microsoft have designed it
to make it more user friendly.
The Natural keyboard is aimed at providing a more comfortable
alternative to the standard 101-key pad used with most PC's. After 18
months of ergonomic and user research, this is what they came up with.
It's features include a static split keyboard design, three new keys,
adjustibility through a hinged rail and built-in palm rests.
Microsoft says the basic querty design on most keyboards has stayed
the same for a century while keying habits have changed dramatically
because most office tasks are now done on computer, adding to the
repetitive nature of the work.
Research showed that users' positioning cramps the shoulders and arms
which can cause strain on hands, wrists, arms and shoulders. The shape
and positioning of the new keyboard is designed to eliminate this
problem.
* JOHNS Hopkins Scientists in Maryland have worked out a method for
predicting powerful magnetic storms caused by the sun -- information
that could help prevent damage to orbiting spacecraft and to electric
power lines on Earth.
Even a 30-minute warning could provide enough time for technicians to
take precautions to avoid damage to satellites and to groundside
electrical transformers.
The dangerous storms originate in the sun's atmosphere. These solar
eruptions of mostly hydrogen gas speed away from the sun at more than a
million miles per hour.
At that speed they can reach Earth within four days. About three times
a month, one of these magnetic clouds comes close enough to Earth to
disturb the planet's magnetic field. The eruptions generate highly
energetic subatomic particles that would be potentially lethal to
astronauts working in deep space or on the moon. The Earth's own
magnetic fields normally protect the space shuttle astronauts.

* PICTURE the scene. Everybody's lined up, the focus is right, the
light's just so, everybody is saying cheese, watching the birdie,
mother-in-law finally has a smile on her face . . . and the camera
simply whines and grinds to a halt.
Batteries are the bane of any photographer's existence, whether
amateur or professional. Now there's an answer. Canon has just launched
what they tell me is the world's first solar-powered 35-mil compact
camera.
The Sureshot Del Sol charges itself from a solar array on its
distinctive front cover which apparently operates even without direct
sunlight, which should make it ideal for the Scottish summer. The new
fully-automatic will soak up as much sun as a beach bum which the
inbuilt lithium ion batteries stores as energy to give enough power to
shoot up to four 24-frame films. Canon say it will still shoot two full
rolls if using flash at night.
The solar panel also acts as the on/off switch. When shut, power is
off and the compact will absorb energy even from artificial light to
continually charge the reserve battery. On searing hot days if the
sunlight causes the internal components to overheat, the panel
automatically opens to let them cool.
Power is switched on when the cover is opened and the Del Sol is
operational with an array of functions including autofocus, flash, wind
and rewind, red-eye reduction, and timer.
* WITH listeria in cheese much in the Scottish news, scientists in
Porton Down have found that soft cheese is best kept cool to avoid a
build up of the bacteria. A team at the Centre for Applied Microbiology
and research say that Listeria cultures multiply at a phenomenal rate at
room temperature if they have been chilled for a while.
* SWEDISH biotechnologists have been able to regenerate tooth roots
and jawbones of people with advanced gum disease by using a protein that
helps children's teeth to grow. They've found a way of extracting the
protein from pigs, making it into a gel and applied surgically to
remaining tooth roots. Trials have already shown a high success rate.
* US scientists are working on ''smart guns'' which use sensors to
recognise its owner's grip . . . . and won't fire for anyone else. The
research is spurred by the number of gun accidents involving children,
and the worrying number of policemen being shot by their own guns. The
detection methods include finger and palm print detectors and voice
recognition systems.
* THE UK and Israel are collaborating on 20 new research projects. Two
Scots Universities are involved in the #1.8 million deal. Dr J.S.
Aitchison of Glasgow University and Dr Ivan Andronovic of Strathclyde
University will work with Israeli counterparts on electro optics and
lasers, according to Minister for Science, John Horam.
* IS your house going to fall down a hole? Or slide over a cliff? We
certainly hope not, and probably you're of the same opinion.
But can you ever be sure of such an irritating occurrence? Yes, you
can be, thanks to a new package developed by the British Geological
Survey.
The UK insurance industry is facing a substantial increase in claims
for ''subsidence'' -- when the house begins to sink -- thanks to changes
in moisture conditions of soils caused by drought or spells of heavy
rainfall. With the global climate changing, freak weather patterns will
be less freakish, and more ground changes can be expected.
To help show where the hazards lie, BGS developed a package called
GHASP, which does not represent the householder's response to the
knowledge that his home has disappeared. It stands for GeoHAzard
Susceptibility Package. GHASP uses geotechnical, mineralogical and
geological information to interpret the susceptibility of geological
formations to geo-hazards. In our language, they've found out where
danger is likely. Remember Halbeck Hall Hotel in Scarborough when it
fell over the edge of a crumbling cliff? GHASP could have predicted
that. Anybody with an ounce of common sense might have guessed, however
that a house on a crumbling cliff was on the slippery slope, to mix a
metaphor.
Covering the whole of Britain, the GHASP package, financed by Lloyds
in return for a share of the revenue, contains a map showing danger
areas and a database giving precise local hazard ratings.

TOURISM researchers believe Northern Ireland could become one of the
top holiday destinations in the UK. The province could eventually rate
with the likes of the Channel Islands and the Lake District -- if the
terrorist ceasefires hold, according to research by ARTAC World Choice,
the UK's largest consortium of independent travel agents.
Northern Ireland Tourist Board chiefs are expecting a 20% increase in
holidaymakers this year -- up to 1.5 million -- and they are predicting
a million more each year by the turn of the century. Hotel occupancy is
at an all-time high, with the growth rate beating England and Scotland,
according to board officials.
ARTAC World Choice chairman Colin Heal said: ''There is no doubt about
the growing interest in Northern Ireland. The political situation
appears to be under control and a lot of people are quite keen to visit.
It's such a beautiful country with enormous tourist potential. Some of
our members took the view that the potential growth in popularity of
Northern Ireland will be greater in the coming year than places like the
Channel Islands . . . provided the peace holds.''
Tourist chiefs believe the province will need up to 18,000 new
accommodation beds to cope with the anticipated demand. In a move to
find extra rooms, home-owners have been urged to consider turning their
houses into B &amp; Bs.
* MEANWHILE, more tourists are coming to Britain and spending much
more money, according to recently released figures. There were 5.6
million tourists in the first three months of 1995 -- an 8% increase on
the same period in 1994. They spent #2.35 billion -- 18% more than in
the same period last year, according to the International Passenger
Survey. Both the numbers and, more specifically, the spending, were
boosted by a rise of 12% in the number of visitors from North America.
Their spending power was illustrated by statistics for March 1995 which
showed that although visitor numbers were down 3% to 1.5 million, their
spending was up 18% to #775m.
''These figures are encouraging evidence that Britain continues to be
a popular and attractive place to visit,'' said Tourism Minister
Viscount Astor.
* HISTORIC battlefields, including Hastings, Bosworth, and Marston
Moor, have been given protection from developers and a chance to be
transformed into tourist attractions. A total of 43 sites, encompassing
600 years of colourful and bloody history, have been included in an
English Heritage Battlefields Register designed to conserve and enhance
them.
The listing gives the sites a special status that will have to be
taken into consideration in any future planning process for new roads or
development.
The list also includes the Wars of the Roses battlefield of Towton in
Yorkshire (in 1461) reckoned to be the bloodiest engagement ever fought
on British soil; Flodden in Northumberland (1513) where the English got
revenge on the Scots for the battle of Bannockburn; and Sedgemoor in
Somerset (1685), the last battle on English soil where invader Monmouth
was routed by James II's troops. English Heritage chairman Jocelyn
Stevens said the register had ''lit a torch for this country's
battlefields and we now look to landowners, developers, and local
authorities to help us carry it forward''.
* NEW YORK is still the big apple of the eye for air travellers. The
city took top spot in the league of most-requested destinations for
bargain flights for the first five months of this year. The league was
compiled by travel company Going Places who found:
* More than half of flight-only inquiries were for North America.
* 25% of these were for New York fares from Gatwick or Manchester.
* Australasian destination requests were second in popularity, with
Sydney the most favoured spot.
* Top short-haul destination was Paris which accounted for 30% of
European inquiries.
''The leisure flights market is booming, fuelled by low fares as
airlines cut prices to shift unsold seats. Those prepared to be flexible
and travel at short notice can grab some real bargains,'' said Going
Places marketing manager Andrew Jones.
The top 10 bargain flight destinations were: 1. New York; 2. Sydney;
3. Los Angeles; 4. Orlando; 5. Toronto; 6. Paris; 7. Amsterdam; 8. San
Francisco; 9. Miami; 10. Boston.
* THE Scottish tourist trade's national training programme Welcome
Host has exceeded its first-year target by 7000. Organisers of the
scheme had hoped to train some 3000 people in the first 12 months, but
have catered for 10,000.
The programme was launched in February of 1994. It was designed as a
one-day training initiative for people from all walks of life to promote
best practice in customer care.
Personnel from stations, airports, and taxis have joined workers from
the hotel and hospitality trade on the courses.
''First impressions can make or break a holiday,'' said Scottish
Tourist Board chairman Ian Grant. ''The growing number of Welcome Hosts
across Scotland will help ensure that visitors to Scotland enjoy the
highest standards of service and go away with a lasting impression of
quality.''
A similar scheme by the Welsh Tourist Board has trained 22,000 people
in three years and the English Tourist Board's venture has trained
11,000 in two years.
* FOR couples who are looking for something more active than slumping
on a beach for a week, Headwater Holidays are offering breaks exploring
the French countryside by two-seater canoe. The trip covers parts of
both the Cele and the Lot rivers, paddling through wooded valleys and
stopping off at traditional French villages. Based at Bouzies, the
holiday is available until September and prices start at #558 per
person. Call 01606 48699 for more information.
Meanwhile, honeymooners have also been targeted by Oakley Court Hotel,
a country house hotel near Windsor, which is offering a special package
for couples who are flying off on honeymoon from nearby Heathrow. The
deal includes one night's half-board accommodation in a suite with a
four-poster bed, champagne on arrival, and flowers and chocolates in the
room. Up to 15 days free parking is also included. The package costs
from #145 per person. Call Oakley Court on 01753 609988.
For the more adventurous traveller, Waymark Holidays are offering a
walking trip to the Transylvanian Alps. The holiday explores the
Carpathian Mountains and visits the castle made famous by the Dracula
legend. There is a good network of paths in the area but the organisers
say a reasonable level of fitness is required. Cost from #675. For more
information call Waymark on 01753 516477.

* Top Scottish hair stylist Rita Rusk tells ANN DONALD about her
favourite reading material.
TO be honest the only time I get to read is when I'm travelling and
doing long-haul journeys or when I'm on holiday and I pick up something
then. I do love thrillers though and I've just finished The Firm by John
Grisham. I haven't seem the film yet but the book was all about a team
of lawyers and the corruption that was going on in their law firm.
It was such a super book that I went straight out and bought The
Pelican Brief, which was also by Grisham. This is about two Supreme
Court justices who were murdered and the connections and clues that link
their deaths. Again it is based around two legal students and their
quest to find out who is behind the murders and mystery. I've only just
started it but it seems to be an interesting one so far.
I've also just finished reading a very intriguing American book called
The Emotions of Normal People by William Molten-Marston which was
recommended to me by a friend. It's quite an interesting book and is
basically an observation of normal people and an explanation about why
they act and react the way they do in everyday situations. The author
lists lots of different examples that have been accumulated by various
well-known doctors' surveys in the subject. It's actually quite deep and
a bit heavy at times but overall it's a very good book. Even though he
talks about perception and analysis you don't really need any kind of
psychology background to understand it. On the whole he uses
self-explanatory terms aimed at the layman.
One of the reasons I found this book such compulsive reading was
because I would like, when I retire, to write an amusing book myself
based on people's behaviour patterns. In this business you meet so many
different people -- both in the salon environment and then because I
teach, in the seminar environment as well -- that you can't help but
observe people.
The only hairdresser's autobiography I've read is Vidal Sassoon's
Sorry I Kept You Waiting Madam and that was a long, long time ago. It's
very much a ''hairdresser's book''. I think that we (hairdressers) can
relate to it better than anyone outside the business.

IT is Friday evening, the sun's still high and the weather promises a
shimmering heat. Out of that cloudless bowl of blue the impulse arrives
to pack a bag and head for some rural retreat. Only one snag bedevils
the perfect escape; what to throw into that weekend hold-all?
Since there is no time for deep deliberation, the trick is to have a
few indispensables at the ready. And here simplicity is the soundest
rule although, that said, it's important to differentiate between the
simple and the prosaic.
Simple items, although straightforward, possess an upbeat versatility.
When imaginatively chosen, they allow you to rework a look by layering
on some clever bits and bobs: a patterned silk-scarf wound round the
hips of a full, plain skirt fetchingly transforms an image in seconds.
At other times the same scarf can be twisted into a useful and
flattering Romany turban.
Always take a plain sweater in lambswool, cashmere or chenille.
Classically narrow or baggy, this sits well above jeans, skirts either
short or long, or the fluid line of light palazzo pants. Thus, it works
as an efficient day job while providing an ideal escort after dark. And
who knows? In a chilly B&amp;B, it might even find a valuable role as a
bedjacket.
Of course the sudden chill factor is the trouble with spontaneous
Scottish getaways. Even the most benign weather has a malicious
uncertainty about it, so a lightweight hooded, drawstring jacket or
cagoule in microfibre is essential; something that can be rolled up and
squashed in the corner of a grip but still emerge with elan on a leafy
ramble, even if only tied about the hips.
Unfussy in shape, solid in colour, the leotard or body is another
worthwhile accompaniment. In a country hotel no-one may be expecting you
to burst into aerobics before a kipper breakfast, but that little
stretchy number can double as an extra sun-bathing outfit, or act purely
as a sculpted camisole, changing its degree of formality depending on
what goes on top. Which brings us to the sarong.
This is probably one of the most waste-resistant garments in the
world. Folding concisely as a shawl, the sarong requires next-to-no
luggage space, and, on most women, it provides a flattering silhouette:
graceful and casual in linen or jersey; exotic and delicate in airy
batik silks, and always comfortable no matter what the fabric. So, take
a wrap, be it mini or long, styled either in the rich designs of central
Asia, or sprinkled with the little meadow flowers of the season.
Fashion's China syndrome has revived the mandarin shirt and jacket,
sometimes sleeveless and gently fitted, and often with embroidery down
the front. It is a clever item to include in any package deal because it
fits well over T-shirts, relieving something of their plainness, but on
its own with loose plain pants ending just on the ankle and in the same
colour, it evokes that delicate oriental chic which appears special
without being over-dressy.
As for footwear, pack the dancing stilettos if you must, but they'll
be the curse of the night at any ceilidh, or tramping up a gravel path.
Better instead to stick to rope-soled espadrilles with linen or denim
uppers, neutral-coloured or two-tone plimsolls, or this summer's
low-heeled mules in dolly mixture shades.
One last hint from the modelling circuit: never fold T-shirts and
trousers or straight skirts, when stowing them in a grip. Instead, roll
them, perhaps with one or two items inside one another to keep creases
to a minimum. And take along a couple of padded coat-hangers which will
keep what you hang on them in better shape than those hunched-back wire
models that so often dangle, like the spectres of forgotten lives, in
the dark recesses of old, off-track hotels.
THREE VIEWS ON LIFE'S ESSENTIALS
Louise Naftalin, Scottish arts consultant and
regular traveller to London:
* I ALWAYS try to be organised with a standby set of makeup, tights
etc already in a bag. Indispensables include a black skirt, black
trousers, and a selection of bodies, and if I'm going to be away for any
length of time, some favourite non-crush shirts. I've also rediscovered
the trouser suit. It's both smart and comfortable for travel, and I
change the look of different outfits just by adding a beautifully
coloured handerchief from a collection given to me by a friend. If I'm
going to something like a concert I take one pair of strappy shoes.
Otherwise I stick to flats. But I do take lots of earrings although I
never travel with good jewellery. And I never wear linen because it
creases and I feel it looks untidy. I never use a suit bag -- somehow
the scale of them just doesn't work for women, so everything goes into a
black canvas bag shaped a bit like a gladstone.
Rita Britton, owner of Pollyanna fashion store:
* IF I say 'Well, I might wear that', I leave it out. I take half a
dozen Muji cotton knickers (three white/three black) because they are
absolutely plain -- no bows or rosettes at the waist which might show
through your most slender clothes. I also take one of Lainey Keogh's
marvellously baggy chenille sweaters in either navy or black which I
wear with a pair of silk Comme des Garcons pants during the day. At
night I dress it up with a long stretch skirt and some jewellery --
Indian-style earrings by Rema Pachachi or plain gold hoops from Spain
which my husband gave me years ago. I take a pair of pumps in beige
linen inside and out by Palladium, fabulously comfortable and smart, and
I also take one really nice pair of black court shoes with a small heel
but stiletto shaped for delicacy. I don't worry about things crushing
and I never bother ironing linen because my philosophy is if you don't
like it crushed you shouldn't be wearing it in the first place. I always
wear the same lipstick, a smokey pink by the Canadian company, Mac,
which I deepen in the evening, with a brown pencil. And all this gear I
just squash in a great leather bag which I bought about six years ago
from Paul Smith. So, that's it -- minimalist packing, minimalist fuss.
David Finlayson, Cruise director:
* PRESENTABLE clothes which remain presentable all through a holiday
or hectic buying trip are vital from my point of view, so I go for
microfibre and wool suits which don't crease. Those from Girbaud, a
French range, are ideal and also Donna Karan's designs: relaxed and
comfortable but still sophisticated. I take two suits -- one in a
suiter, the other I wear -- and two waistcoats, one for evening, which
look good either with collarless shirts or T-shirts. I also take a nice
Armani scarf for evening. I pack no more than four shirts, getting them
landered while I'm away, but I avoid cufflinks which are too fiddly when
travelling. In fact I avoid packing anything that I might leave behind.
I take two pairs of shoes, Patrick Cox's Wannabes in black and brown,
and as for toiletries I keep them in those little Muji dispensers inside
a small Prada bag. Apart from the suiter, my only piece of luggage is
one of Paul Smith's brown leather bags.

WHEN a video comes bearing blurbs like One Of The Greatest Movies Of
All Time! and One Of The Best American Films Of The Decade!, Couch
Potato is just naturally sceptical; we've been this way before. Throw in
the fact that it isn't even a feature film -- just a documentary -- and
Couch Potato really begins to wonder.
Yet everything they say about Hoop Dreams (retail/rental, cert 12) is
almost true: we're all familiar with the Hollywood sporting melo (Rocky,
etc), and its cheesily predictable all-American plotlines, but Hoop
Dreams is something else entirely.
Simultaneously celebrating and subverting the American Dream of
climbing out of the ghetto by one's sporting talent, Steve James and
Fred Marx's five-year, three-hour story of the high school career of
poor-black Chicago teenage basketball prodigies Arthur Agee and William
Gates is a film that soars and dives and flies, a touching but realistic
portrait of what it's like to live in a Chicago housing project and bear
the whole weight of your family's lost ambitions every time you step
into the arena.
If this were a feature film, the heroes would always win; but being a
documentary, things ain't quite so neat. Basketball is fairly
incidental, anyway, to the family stories of black lifestyle -- poverty,
drugs, divorce, and institutional racism -- that touch the heart and the
mind. Bring on the sequel: these people are all so interesting and sweet
that Couch Potato wants to know how they got on after high school.
Cult Corner: The Wicker Man (1973, Fox Video, #10.99, cert 18), an
archetypally British rural horror movie that -- despite an almost total
absence of spectacle and gore, and some unintentionally comic moments
with Britt Ekland in a kit-off situation -- is up there with Don't Look
Now, Eraserhead, and Witchfinder General among the most desolate and
frightening films ever made.
Edward Woodward stars as a devoutly Christian Scottish policeman
dispatched to the idyllic and flagrantly pagan Summerisle to
investigate, without much help from the locals (who all dress like an
English hippie folk-rock group c. 1972), the disappearance of a young
girl. Disgusted by the islanders' hedonistic carnality, he begins to
suspect a ritual killing; and he's right, but not in the way he thinks.
Firmly insistent on the essential viciousness of paganism in a world
where God is dead or gone away, The Wicker Man is a fiercely
rationalist, anti-mystical film with an unfashionable message for these
days of nouveau-hippie New Age nature worship: nature is cruel, and so
are its worshippers. Harvest festivals will never seem the same again.

The Irish Country House, A Social History by Peter Somerville-Large.
Sinclair-Stevenson. #20.00.
* THE ruination and the ruined . . . so often in Ireland the relic of
the Great House stands for it all. Hated as a symbol of the Ascendancy,
the mansion or the castle cast shadows of menace and cruelty across the
land for 700 years. Then, with the twentieth century, the masters of
oppression vanished, leaving behind demesnes to be ransacked in the
brutal fight for Independence, and by nature's punishment as well. But
today the echoes of tyranny are silent and the glorious, restored
masonry of the overlords often earns its keep either as a museum or a
hotel. In his impressive study Peter Somerville-Large traces, through
memoirs and inventories, a story of conquest and loss which is shameful
and grim but in its very Irishness not without its own hilarious ghosts.

LOST COWBOYS: from Patagonia to the Alamo. Hank Wangford. Victor
Gollancz, #16.99
STALIN was a cowboy but nobody figured him for a Western fan.
Wittgenstein too loved the gunsmoke of a good shoot 'em up. Now, decades
after the Russian leader insisted on private screenings before banning
them and our greatest philosopher traded language for the lawman, the
horizon is filled with dust clouds, tumbleweed and cordite's sweet
scent. Hank Wangford, Britain's most famous gynaecologist/country and
western star is riding the range to separate cowboy fact from fiction.
Wangford's literary debut is a travel diary along South America's
spine in search of the gauchos of Argentina, Chile and Uruquay; the
Venezualan llaneros and the vaqueros of Mexico. In truth the lost
cowboys of the Americas. The only problem is he fails to find them. The
book is littered with sentences such as: ''I was trying to find some
urban cowboys on the city scene. It was not to be'' and ''we seemed to
be drawing blanks everywhere we looked''.
But, undefeated, he borrows the travel writer's poncho and begins
filling the pages with the detailed descriptions reserved for royal
commentators with acres of air-time to fill before the carriages or even
cavalry arrive. Which they do not. But then there are the jokes. In
Mexico he nervously eats spinal chord soup. ''No backbone, that's my
trouble.'' No, that's our trouble, Hank! Here's another culinary
classic.
In Uruguay it's the genitals of bulls which he must munch, as he
describes it ''a plate of dickhead''. The laughs eventually arrive with
the story of Santa Anna, the president/dictator of Mexico. During a
battle with the French his leg was blown off by a cannonball. To raise
his ratings he buried his leg with full military honours and erected a
statue to it. The leg was exhumed by his enemies and had to be
re-buried. The statue was rubbished.
Mexicans called Santa Anna ''The Immortal Three Quarters''.
Between the literary burbs and window dressing lies the threads of the
past lives of forgotten cowboys such as the gauchos who despised guns as
the coward's way out. They lived and died by the facon, the long knife
with which they would either protect the honour of women and children or
rape and pillage depending on whose account you believe.
In many ways Wangford's mission is an honourable one. The myth of
today's cowboy was born in South America when the Spaniards arrived with
Columbus and began hunting wild cattle. However like the American
Indian, the original cowboy has been dismissed to the reservations of
distant memory, trampled on by Hollywood as grubby, distrustful and
filthy. There has always only been room for one image -- that of the
American hero.
Critic Phillip French wrote that the mythic West of celluloid fame was
to be found west of the Mississippi, south of the 49th Parallel and
north of the Rio Grande. Wangford's journey end touches this time with a
look at Mexico's victory over America at the Alamo. Here he finds the
MacGregor Society of Texas celebrating John MacGregor, the Scots unsung
piper hero, who succeed in raising men's spirits.
I didn't enjoy this book. I wanted too, badly, but couldn't. The
reason was my submission to the American myth. In an early chapter,
Wangford visits a log cabin where Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid hid
in 1902 from Pinkerton's men. These few paragraphs had more weight and
personal worth than what was to follow. As Wangford illustrates history
is always written by the winners.

Lady Claire McDonald adores the combination of fine weather and a
barbecue to liven up any social occasion.
THERE has been a tendency this year among writers -- not just food
writers -- to sneer at barbecues and barbecued food. Well, I love
barbecues and I love the taste of char-grilled food. What appeals to me
about a barbecue is the inevitable informality of a social occasion
where the food is barbecued -- it can be an elegant event, with
wonderful and unusual dishes, but it will still be informal because of
the very nature of cooking outside.
With the school holidays already in full swing any fine weather brings
on a rash of barbecues, and, providing you have the charcoal, a simple
barbecue lunch or supper can be a very spontaneous affair. After all,
good sausages and chicken joints can be bought anywhere, and buns can be
buttered, bowls of salad produced, and, the inevitable tomato ketchup
brought from the cupboard.
The range of food which can be cooked on a barbecue is endless. It
needn't all taste the same, if the actual grilling is carefully done.
The one chief thing to bear in mind when cooking on a charcoal grill or
barbecue is that it is a very drying form of cooking. Any potentially
dry food, such as fish or shellfish, therefore needs insulation from
direct contact with the red-hot grill.
You can do this either by stretching rashers of streaky bacon with a
knife on a board -- this elongates each rasher by half as long again --
and wrapping the food in this stretched bacon, or loosely wrap it in
foil. But how then do you get the flavour of the charcoal through the
foil? Just slash the foil in several places on either side of the
parcel. It would be hard to win prizes for presentation and appearance
with fish cooked like this, but it certainly wins on taste.
Cooking a whole fish takes a bit of prodding with a fork within the
foil parcel to test whether or not the fish is cooked -- it is hard to
be precise with cooking times per pound when the heat of a barbecue
varies so much. With filleted sides of fish, a surprisingly short time
is needed on either side -- about 3-4 minutes. I rub the foil with
butter, season with a little salt and lots of pepper, put handfuls of
parsley and some sliced lemon down and then lay the fish on top. Wrap
the foil tightly, slash it in several places on each side and then all
that is required of the cook is to wait until the barbecue burns through
the red leaping flames and dies down to a white heat before laying the
parcel of fish on the grill.
You can treat any fish the same way, or you can wrap scallops, pieces
of monkfish, or any other firm-fleshed white fish in streaky bacon and
push the wrapped fish or shellfish on kebabs. Beware using ordinary
kitchen skewers as kebabs -- the food on them tends to swivel around
maddeningly as it cooks and shrinks very slightly; proper barbecue
kebabs have flat blades and the food stays obligingly in place as you
turn it over during its cooking time.
There is another way to prevent drying out -- a marinade. The longer
the food stays in the marinade the better, from 24 to 48 hours, but do
remember to turn the food, be it meat, fish or chicken, in the marinade.
A marinade can be very simple and consist of just oil, chopped garlic
and salt and pepper, but it is much more fun to incorporate lots of
other flavours. I like the spiciness in the marinade in today's recipe.
FILLET OF PORK KEBABS
Serves 6
2lb pork fillet: cut the fillets into pieces.
18 rashers of streaky bacon stretched until half as long again. Cut in
half. Wrap pork in bacon and push on to skewers.
For the marinade:
[1/2] pint olive-oil -- extra virgin
1 red-skinned onion, skinned and finely chopped
6 ready-soaked prunes, chopped finely.
2 teaspoons powdered cinnamon
2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar
[1/2] pint dry cider or apple juice
Once the skewers are assembled lay them in a shallow dish. Mix
together the marinade ingredients, and pour this over the kebabs. Leave
as long as possible, turning often. Before barbecuing, pour the marinade
into the saucepan and simmer until reduced by about half. Grill the
kebabs, and when cooked serve with a spoonful of the reduced marinade
over each.

SID JAMES
Cliff Goodwin
Century, #15.99
THERE really is no polite way of saying this but there was apparently
a point in Sid James's life when he was in danger of having his penis
cut off. According to the author of this revealing, if (at 184 pages)
somewhat flimsy, biography, an angry father-in-law, on discovering that
the actor was playing around behind his wee girl's back, planned to put
a contract out on him. He didn't want him dead; he just wanted him
neutered.
Certainly, someone should have put bromide in Sid's tea. He was an
incorrigible rogue and a rascal. A serial womaniser who was constantly
as randy as a goat. A man who enjoyed nothing better than a wee game of
tonsil hockey with a young actress, preferably one who was well-endowed.
Into this category, most assuredly, came Barbara Windsor. In the
beginning it was a case of unrequited lust. Sid was obsessed with the
woman and, without thought for his own personal safety (she was married
to gangster Ronnie Knight, after all) he pursued her with a vengeance.
His efforts were not in vain; Windsor eventually embarked on a loveless
affair with the actor whom she regarded more as a father-figure than a
sex object.
But there was much more to Sid than simply prune-faced Lothario. He
was also a heavy drinker/smoker/gambler. He was extraordinarily
parsimonious and, for fun, he was not averse to the odd stand-up fight
in the pub. Oh, and he suffered from piles. In short, he was the same in
life as he was in the 19 Carry On films in which he starred.
To a generation, he was the cheeky corner-boy Cockney who laughed with
a ''yak, yak, yak''. Only he wasn't. It was a convenient affectation
because Sid, born to Jewish parents and raised in South Africa, was one
of life's great Boers. He was also economic with his personal truth,
creating a past life from his own fertile imagination.
Popular legend has it that Sid acquired his trademark battered face
and mushy ears during a career as a semi-pro boxer. ''I used to fight
middle-weight,'' he told one interviewer. In reality, his fighting
career was confined to bar-room brawls.
Publicly, Sid James cultivated the image of a rough, tough, man of the
world. An ex-pugilist, soldier, and diamond miner. In fact, before the
war Sid was a hairdresser who ran his own salon in the basement of
Johannesburg's most fashionable hotel, the Carlton. He married (young)
and had a daughter. But he drank like a haddock and, when drunk, became
violent. He had a string of affairs with pretty girls who worked in his
salon. Not surprisingly, his first marriage ended in divorce.
He arrived in Britain in 1946, determined to advance an acting career
which had started with the Jo'burg Repertory Players 10 years earlier.
His (continuing) reputation as an obsessive Lothario was counterbalanced
by the high regard in which he was held by his fellow actors.
But he persistently pulled a veil over his former life in South
Africa, disguising it with lies and half-truths. Not even his closest
family was aware that Sid James left behind him a string of illegitimate
children.
In his 30-year career in Britain (he died of a heart attack on stage
at the Empire Theatre, Sunderland, in 1976) he made 457 radio,
television, and film appearances. Though best remembered for his Carry
On performances, he was also the unforgettable feed to Tony Hancock and
the middle-aged dad in the ITV sitcom Bless This House.

MRS OLIPHANT: A FICTION TO HERSELF by Elisabeth Jay, Clarendon Press,
#25
* ''IT IS the sad fate of gifted women in general never to be
appreciated,'' the Victorian novelist Margaret Oliphant wrote to her
Edinburgh publisher John Blackwood in 1866, defending the central figure
in her novel Miss Marjoribanks against Blackwood's criticisms. Oliphant
was also making rueful reference to herself, however; and indeed she has
always been undervalued. In her time, she was popular, but felt
overshadowed by writers more generously rewarded. Elisabeth Jay, who
edited Oliphant's poignant Autobiography, has written a scholarly
account of the woman and her work that is a serious and welcome
contribution to the study of a still unjustly neglected writer.
Comparing herself to Charlotte Bronte in 1864, Oliphant described her
own work as ''perfectly pale and lifeless beside hers -- but yet,'' she
added, ''I have had far more experience and, I think, a fuller
conception of life''.
Oliphant's writing is far from pale and lifeless, but her life was
certainly interesting, and as with R L Stevenson, it can tempt attention
away from the literature. Born into a Scottish family which moved south
to Liverpool, Oliphant married an artist and, widowed young, raised and
supported a family alone on the strength of her writing.
Of her six children, only two much-loved but disappointing sons
survived to adulthood; they, too, predeceased her. She also supported
one brother, an alcoholic, and the family of another. The sad facts of
this life are not, says Jay, remarkable in themselves for Oliphant's
time. What is remarkable is ''the degree and range of her success as a
professional woman writer and the way in which she coped with,
evaluated, and viewed her life: in short, 'her character' both as a
person and as a writer''.
As a person Oliphant was exceptional; as a writer, astonishingly
prolific, publishing almost 100 novels, 50 or more short stories, and a
great deal of non-fiction. Her work is generally regarded as uneven, but
at its best is very fine.
The novelist with whom she is most often compared is George Eliot, but
while, as Q D Leavis observed, Miss Marjoribanks (1866) may foreshadow
Middlemarch, it has different qualities: comic verve and a sharp wit. J
M Barrie remarked that Oliphant had ''an intellect so alert that one
wondered she ever fell asleep'', and this intellect informs her fiction,
from realist novels of English provincial life (The Carlingford
Chronicles), through Scottish novels like Kirsteen, to taut, powerful
''Tales of the Seen and the Unseen''.
Like most previous critics, Jay examines Oliphant's literary work in
the context of her life, although, like Oliphant in her own
autobiography, she rejects a linear method, as ''peculiarly ill-suited
to deal with the cyclical rhythm of women's lives''. The three main
sections of Jay's volume, each further divided and sub-divided
thematically, provide an excellent sense of the social, cultural, and
religious context in which Oliphant lived and worked.
Yet while there are some tantalising summaries of forgotten works, and
some interesting discussion, Jay's analyses of novels like Miss
Marjoribanks, and stories like the marvellous ''The Library Window'',
offer little that is new, and the conclusion that Oliphant is ''worth
reading'' seems a lukewarm verdict on a writer on whom such care has
been lavished.
Elisabeth Jay's book will be of interest to those who already love
Oliphant; for new readers the novels and short stories themselves should
be the first priority. Unfortunately only a bare handful of the works
are currently in print. Publishers please take note.

Boswell: Citizen of the World, Man of Letters. Edited by Irma S
Lustig, University Press of Kentucky, #25.
* AS A near-perfect model of the contradictory Scot Boswell stands
amid issues of the Enlightenment like a rough-cut crystal, refracting
light all over the place but clarifying no single view. It is the
largeness and bizarreness of the personality which dominated his
attempts at being prodigal son, politician, laird, lawyer, and thinker,
and made him a dramatist rather than an illuminator of his times.
Journals and biography allowed him what life could not: a means of fully
indulging the unpredictable abundance of character.
Even in the specialised themes of this excellent collection of essays
Boswell's personality is constantly directing the analysis. Whether it
is his travels, his relationship to legal and political contemporaries,
his qualities as a landowner, his responses to landscape or to
philosophy, psychological insights keep emerging.
Marlies Danziger mentions an incident where Rousseau declared that
atonement could be achieved not by suffering but through doing positive
good. Boswell, although appreciative, could not forgo the notion of
''satisfaction by punishment''. Richard Sher tackles Boswell's other
surrogate father; not Johnson but Lord Kames. And Michael Fry discusses
the almost sibling jealousies provoked by the political success of Henry
Dundas.
Boswell the man is just as inseparable from the work in the second
part, an analysis of The Life of Johnson. For the centenary of Boswell's
death and as an addition to existing scholarship, this book does the man
justice both by painting a big picture of the times and by examining
previously untouched particulars.

LIFE WITHOUT ARMOUR: An AUTOBIOGRAPHY, Alan Sillitoe. HarperCollins,
#18.99.
L P HARTLEY spoke for many when he opened The Go-Between (1953), his
nostalgic account of Edwardian England, by observing: ''The past is a
foreign country: they do things differently there''. To middle-class
novelists the post-1945 present was a distressingly alien England, as
Mollie Panter-Downes implied in One Fine Day (1947) and Angela Thirkell
lamented in Love Among the Ruins (1948), books popular with those who
thought the country had gone to the dogs when proles asserted themselves
after the Second World War. For oldish middle-class novelists all, apart
from profit from royalties, was lost. For a new generation of English
novelists there was money in muck and in mockery.
The fiction of the 1950s is usually defined as the collective culture
of Angry Young Men and in The Angry Decade (1958) Kenneth Allsop wrote
angrily of novelists demonstrating their ''resentment against the
cultivated''. Much of the anger amounted to envy as Somerset Maugham
noted in attacking the hero of Lucky Jim (1954) as ''mean, malicious,
and envious''. Kingsley Amis's Lucky Jim Dixon just wants a better job.
John Braine's Joe Lampton, in Room at the Top (1957), wants ''an Aston
Martin (and) a girl with a Riviera suntan''. Kingsley and John and Jim
and Joe aspired to affluence and the rituals of the right and it was
left to Alan Sillitoe to express authentic anger rather than bitter
envy.
Sillitoe stops this story of his life in 1961 as after that year he
felt he only had to struggle with success whereas before his first novel
was filmed in 1960 he felt he was fighting against failure. He writes as
a man who began his life as a no-hoper, identifies with folk who are up
against it. He believes ''the occupation of a novelist is a lonely one:
labouring like the coalminer far underground''.
Artistically he is a winner famous for his fiction about losers --
most famously Arthur Seaton, the tamed teddy boy of Saturday Night and
Sunday Morning (1958), and Colin Smith, the shamed Borstal boy of The
Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner (1959). Like Seaton, Sillitoe has
lived ''a dangerous life''. Like Smith, he wants to show ''what honesty
means''.
His dangerous life began in 1928 in a council house on the outskirts
of Nottingham. His father, a labourer, could not read or write but made
his mark with his fists and feet. He battered Sillitoe and savaged
Sillitoe's mother: ''He often hit my mother, and an early memory is of
her bending over the bucket so that blood from her cut head would not
run on to the carpet''. Unlike Seaton, who is physically and
psychologically battered into submission, Sillitoe learned how to
survive suffering.
Like Smith, Sillitoe learned how to pace himself. ''Cunning is what
counts in this life,'' says the long-distance runner. ''Cunning was the
policy,'' says the long-distance writer in his autobiography. Cunning
meant avoiding street fights with physical superiors, meant reading in
peace to escape from the ferocity of his father, meant making money by
working in factories, meant enrolling in the Air Training Corps, meant
riding high with the RAF, meant wireless operating in Malaya.
Having gone through that, Sillitoe had to cope with this on returning
to England from Malaya in 1948: ''It was found beyond all doubts that I
was 'TB Positive' . . . What had to be accepted, and took much doing,
was not being recognised any longer as in first-class health. People who
had TB, if they hadn't died of it, were regarded as finished off, or at
best as unemployable pariahs.''
While convalescing, Sillitoe concentrated on writing. Most of his
stuff was rejected but he managed to place a story, ''No Shot in the
Dark'', in the Nottinghamshire Weekly Guardian in 1950. At last he was a
name in Nottingham and felt fit enough to become famous, like his local
hero D H Lawrence. In pursuit of the poetry of life he met Ruth
Fainlight (the American poet he married) in a Nottingham bookshop in
1951, then went out of his way to meet Robert Graves in Deya in 1953.
When Sillitoe showed Graves the typescript of an exotic novel, the poet
asked him to write a novel set in Nottingham. Hence Saturday Night and
Sunday Morning.
Before W H Allen bought the book several publishers rejected the saga
of Arthur Seaton which eventually sold more than five million copies.
Sillitoe was financially made by the movie of his novel and was offered
big bucks to go to Hollywood to script films but he refused as he wanted
to write fiction that would give him more than monetary success.
Looking back in anxiety to his triumph over the traumas of his life,
Sillitoe feels he survived by the exercise of his imagination. Born an
Arthur Seaton he became a better man than that bitter man.

The Invisible Circus by Jennifer Egan. Picador, #15.99
PHOEBE O'CONNOR is a day late for the revival of the Festival Of
Moons, which was held 10 years previously. It was attended by her
sister, Faith, who died in mysterious circumstances while travelling in
Europe.
The first person Phoebe meets is one of her dead sister's boyfriends,
whose initial reaction is similar to our own: ''I can't believe this,''
he said.
Kyle was called Catnip because girls found him irresistible. He is 26
and she is 18. It is 1978 so Phoebe also missed a decade of love and
peace and dropping out at open-air rock festivals, protests and Red Army
factions.
Back at Kyle's place they have a joint and a wee love-in interrupted
by something Phoebe ''needed to remember . . . It was always this way --
something she needed to remember pulling her back like an undertow. A
white door sealing her off, reminding Phoebe that her present life was
unreal and without significance. What mattered was hidden from sight.''
Later they discuss their individual perspectives on Faith's death.
''Sometimes I feel like she's still back there,'' says Kyle.
Phoebe has recently graduated from a San Francisco high school and
sometimes wears her dead sister's clothes. Her childhood was
overshadowed by their father's indulgence of Faith's hedonistic
wildness.
She tries to impress Kyle by saying she's leaving for Europe, the
money coming from her father's will. With a gift of grass to deliver to
Kyle's friends in Munich, Phoebe retraces her sister's steps using her
postcards home as an itinerary guide.
But times have changed, and eventually Phoebe is forced to acknowledge
that things may not have been as exciting as they appear to a child, nor
that her sister's life and times were all that wonderful. She has the
obligatory acid and heroin trips in an attempt to emulate her sister's
lifestyle. Another meeting in Munich with another of Faith's boyfriends,
Wolf, takes her to Corniglia in Italy where her sister died.
Their journey, its trials, detours, and final destination, help Phoebe
accept the truth of Faith's life and its consequences as well as
tempering her notion of the more popular mythologies of the times.
The 1960s overlay masks an occasionally moving, uncomfortable account
of family tensions, parental squabbles and sibling rivalries, the quest
for love in a dysfunctional environment. Every once in a while a
serious, well-intentioned novel struggles to escape from the sentimental
haze and stereotypical language which overshadows what could have been a
shocking and realistic story of self-discovery and myth.
The narrative mingles past and present and the technique of sudden
flashback is rarely convincing. Jennifer Egan tries to recapture the
atmosphere and mood of the time by injecting an unrealistic dialogue on
to the text, the way one would imagine they spoke in the 1960s if
research consisted of pop films and music videos.
People tell each other what they might reasonably be expected to know
or elaborately describe their drug-induced philosophies. There is a
tendency to over-explain and re-emphasise, which detracts from the pace
and force, the real sense of hope that generates the second half of this
book, when everyone seems out to discover rather than impress.
Nor is there a realistic sense of place. For all that London, Paris,
and Amsterdam are important, they and almost everywhere else, including
San Francisco, come across as a series of tourist locations, stops along
the way, which questions their necessity especially since Phoebe finds
what she is searching in time, but only by learning from her mistakes
and avoiding short cuts.

The rugby world cup has produced exciting new heroes like Lomu,
Kronfeld, and Joubert, but once-great players like Campese, Lynagh, and
Dean Richards have been shown to be well past their best and their
recent on-field activities to be a poor reflection of their past
glories. They should have retired gracefully before the new stars
exposed their limitations.
In the world of literature similar cliches can be uttered in relation
to writers, who are always only as good as their last book.JOHN LE
CARRE'S latest novel, Our Game, has received a great deal of publicity,
but very little of it is to do with its literary merit. The novel, in my
opinion, is easily the worst he has ever written. There is no hint of
the subtleties of characterisation so redolent of the Smiley novels; the
reader experiences a novelist going through the motions to fulfil his
contractual obligations to his publisher.
A sports person may often redeem a poor showing on the next outing. A
writer will lose new readers, because the introduction to their writing
is Our Game. The new reader will have no desire to try previous or
successive novels; the faithful adherent just becomes depressed!
Le Carre's publicity has emanated from his publisher's view that extra
sales would be generated if the book could be sold more cheaply in
supermarkets than in traditional bookshops. Stores like Asda, Safeway,
and Sainsbury have sold more copies of le Carre than they would
normally, but bookshops have sold far fewer copies than they would have
expected. Unfortunately, the sales have very little bearing upon the
book's worth, but rather a lot to do with its price, because the
supermarkets have been selling it as less than the cost price to
booksellers.
Two hundred superstores selling two or three thousand copies, at a
loss, are not going to radically affect their profit margins. The loss
of these sales to traditional booksellers is much more damaging, as this
type of potential best-seller, regardless of literary merit, could mean
the difference between survival and closure. Most bookshops are small
businesses, catering for a local market and eking out a miserly profit.
They are unable to compete with the giants on price, but can and do on
service. Unfortunately, in the short term, it is price that wins the
argument; in the long term the consumer regrets not having the choice of
outlets they once enjoyed.
The supposed argument at the heart of the sales of Our Game is over
the conditions of sale most publishers impose on retailers as defined by
the Net Book Agreement. Briefly this is a publishers' voluntary
agreement ensuring a consistent retail price for their book throughout
all retailers. Asda are challenging this agreement as they believe it to
be a restrictive practice and if annulled, books would be cheaper. They
claim that by pricing le Carre at #8.99, as opposed to the publishers'
deliberately inflated cover price of #16.99, they are widening the book
market. Asda have a total range of 1000 titles of which their stores may
stock up to 600. Most small bookshops have over 10,000 titles in stock,
and are willing to order any of the other 800,000 currently in print. I
cannot see how the supermarkets can claim to be widening choice.
If asked the question, ''would you like cheaper books?'', most people
would answer yes. If asked ''would you like cheaper baked beans?'', I am
certain the answer would be the same. Affirmation of a simplistic
question is easy. The ramifications of such an answer, without
understanding the complexities behind the question, are not so
straightforward. A few books would be cheaper, but they would be the
works of writers like Jeffrey Archer, who don't exactly need to make
another fortune. Other books, by lesser-known mortals, would increase in
price to compensate for the loss in gross profit due to the discounting
of the mega-seller. Booksellers and publishers would then be loath to
experiment with authors whose track record would not be guaranteed.
The supermarkets' claims of fighting a restrictive practice are
spurious. They have seen an excellent opportunity to gain column inches,
and they have exploited this exceedingly well. All of them are
campaigning for greater market share; John le Carre's aptly titled novel
has been a simple pawn in a much wider game. Booksellers have
successfully argued their case around the range of different titles they
have on offer as opposed to those on the few metres of supermarket
shelving. The supermarkets are making the same defence, of range of
stock, in their fight against the discount stores like Kwiksave,
Shoprite, and the warehouses like Costco.
Range and choice are important to retailers, because that is what
ultimately you, the consumer, wants. The bookshops in Scotland, whether
they be in Glasgow, Ullapool, or Huntly do ensure the survival of
Scotland's literary heritage. That is also important.

THE MACMILLAN YEARS 1957-63
-- The Emerging Truth
Richard Lamb.
John Murray, #25
HAROLD MACMILLAN, who succeeded Eden as Tory Premier after the Suez
debacle of 1956, seemed to many contemporaries to enjoy the effortless
superiority said to be associated with some Balliol men. He cultivated
an image of ''unflappability'', seemingly immune from the stress of the
highest office: when he lost his financial team to resignations over
very serious differences of view, it was ''a little local difficulty''.
His calculated insouciance was seldom better demonstrated than in his
reply to Kruschev who interrupted one of Mac's speeches at the UN by
beating his shoe against his desk: ''I shall have to have that
translated!''
Even the barbs of enemies were absorbed with no apparent pain -- and
even turned back on them. When a left-wing cartoonist sought to dismiss
Macmillan in the sarcastic sobriquet ''Supermac'', it failed to survive
as a jibe but was worn as an accolade. It was Supermac who after Suez
sought to repair the Anglo-American ''special relationship'' and was
successful in doing so with President Kennedy who quickly came to accept
Mac's sympathetic, not to say avuncular, role during the Cuban missile
crisis, for example.
Richard Lamb, who has had the opportunity to look through the British
public records now available under the 30-year rule (though not all are
actually open yet) and has added research in the more accessible US
archives, seeks to re-assess the man. He has also benefited from a
wide-ranging correspondence with survivors of the era on both sides of
the Atlantic and interviewed many directly.
His chapter on the Macmillan Government's negotiations to join the
Common Market, as it then was, is greatly aided by this technique. It is
a great read and will show at once no mention whatever of the grandiose
assumptions now inseparable from ''the Europeans''.
Lamb's subtitle, ''The emerging truth'', suggests an ongoing process
as well as major revelations. There are some new things here. Mac often
gave tendentious reports of his role and his successes -- even to his
diary. The reality was often different from the image, and this account
is most enjoyable, with a quite different flavour from Alistair Horne's
official biography.
Yet there is a strong feeling of deja vu -- the new material is seldom
charged with significance. Most political contemporaries, including
commentators, knew that far from being unflappable Mac was prone to
panic -- to sack a good slice of the cabinet, even to give up the
premiership without properly considering the consequences. Few accepted
his version of the relationship with Kennedy.
Many readers will recognise the accuracy of Lamb's description of him
as a Presidential Prime Minister, but again the fate of Selwyn Lloyd and
Derick Heathcote Amory was seen at the time as proof of Macmillan's
overweening role in economic policy. (On the other hand the activities
of Roy Harrod, Mac's maverick economic adviser a la Alan Walters are
here catalogued to an extent that is new.)
Mr Lamb has sufficient examples of failed Mac policies for a reader to
understand why the great man could privately have called himself
''Macblunder''; and his view that Mac is the greatest post-war premier
is simply bizarre (better than Attlee? better than Thatcher?). But he
shows him to have been highly intelligent as well as highly strung and
explains his relentless desire to expand the economy in the same
convincing way as it has always been understood, in the memories of
Stockton in the 1930s.
Mac did wonders in promoting detente between East and West and
beginning the process of controlling and confining nuclear capacities.
And he did re-establish good relations with Ike after Suez, though
Kennedy was prone to regard him and Douglas-Home as ''fuddy-duddy''. Mac
played no important role in the missile crisis, as Lamb shows.
If this account is too generous to him, it is none the less always
interesting, not the least in the concluding re-examination of the
Profumo affair and the author's sharing of Bill Deedes's sympathetic
reconsideration of that unfortunate's minister's fate.

Many foods now give fat, sugar and even calorie content, but, as
Catherine Brown discovers, without accurate comparisons these figures
mean very little.
REACHING for the ready-prepared is irresistible. Tonight, it's a
carton of ready-chilled soup. Energy input: open carton, pour into bowl,
add ice cube. It's only later, glancing at the small print on the label,
that I discover the calorie overload from cream and butter. A good thing
for winter warmth, but who needs an extra layer of fat in summer heat?
Chilled soups and ready-made meals have developed into a major growth
area for the food industry. And who can argue against their performance
as brilliant kitchen-liberators when the going gets tough? Keeping
control of the calorie intake, however, while reaching for the
pre-prepared is another matter.
You might imagine that the nutrition information on the label would be
the way to work out the calorie load. Not so, says Professor Mike Lean,
of the Department of Human Nutrition at Glasgow University.
''It may be called 'nutrition information' but it's not written in
nutritional language,'' he says. ''Nutritionists do not talk in 'mg per
100 g'. This is the language of the food scientist. Of course, it's
important for consumer protection to know what's in the food, but
because nutrition involves a balance of nutrients, it's wrong to single
out any one nutrient without considering it alongside the others which
are making up the dish or meal.
''In the case of ready-made foods, it's the percentage of each
nutrient in relation to your daily intake which counts, not the mg per
100g. I would need to sit down with a calculator to work out the
percentage of fat in your ready-made chilled soup, which would then give
you some idea of whether it was higher than you wanted.''
For real nutritional labelling we must rely, not on professors of
nutrition with calculators but on a limited amount of selected
information which the food industry uses to promote their products with
a ''healthy'' tag. ''Low fat'' has become an attractive selling point
but the idea of giving the ''high fat'' facts is not so appealing.
While other multiples make what profit they can out of our confusion,
only the Co-op has so far taken the honest and useful tack of providing
a guide to both low and high percentages of nutritional values on its
own-label foods. It is a step which Mike Rayner, of the Department of
Public Health at Oxford University, sees as a bold move into a
complicated and difficult consumer issue which badly needs sorting out.
Some scientific research, funded by MAFF in the early nineties, which
he carried out on consumer perception of labels (Just Read the Label,
HMSO, 1992) showed conclusively that words rather than numbers provide
the clearest, fastest, most effective message. Yet the Government and
the food industry have been incredibly slow, he says, to do anything
about improving nutritional formats on our packaged foods.
Sainsbury's has its blue triangle on its own-brand foods which it
wants to highlight as positively healthy. Tesco has its recently
re-launched Healthy Initiative with the Leonardo man logo on foods it
deems ''healthy''. But only the Co-op has risked telling the whole
story.
''What consumers really want, according to our research,'' says
Rayner, ''is information which helps them to compare two brands of the
same product for nutritional values. So if they have a choice of
breakfast cereals they can make some quick judgment between them on,
say, the percentages of sugar and fibre in each one. Just telling us
that one food is healthy, without being able to compare it with another
similar food, is useless and misleading.''
Legislation, it seems, is the only way forward. Something which Rayner
thinks will come eventually. The American government has just introduced
a Nutrition, Education, and Labelling Act which means that nutrition
labelling is compulsory for all packaged foods, and even for some
unpackaged foods.
While nutrition labelling continues to be non-compulsory in the UK --
unless the product makes a health claim -- in the US it has progressed
from numbers to percentages. What will now appear on all labels is the
percentage of the daily recommended value of the nutrient in the food so
that it can be related to the rest of the diet.
It is a major step forward compared with what we have in Europe. At
present the MAFF-funded Nutrition Task Force is looking at recent
research and trying to work out a way forward. But progress has been
incredibly slow, says Rayner, because the food industry has refused to
come to a consensus.
So until it does, in future I'll pass on the calorie-loaded chilled
soups. Instead, read: take one packet of de-frosted peas, put into food
processor, plus bunch of mint and half a cucumber. Whiz until a fine
puree. Serve with ice cubes.
Result: double the taste at half the price and quarter the calories.
SEASONWATCH
* OUTDOOR strawberry picking in Scotland is now in full swing with the
first rasps, gooseberries, blackcurrants and redcurrants ripening about
the middle of next week. The best pick-your-own farms rotate the picking
so that you are not put into fields which have been almost cleaned out.
At the Cairnie Fruit Farm, just outside Cupar in Fife, they also have
a field-plan of varieties: for dessert, Elsanta, Pegasus, EM227 or Hapil
(a huge berry which should be picked and eaten as soon as possible) and
for jam-making Tamella and Cambridge Favourite. Among the rasp varieties
look out for the new Glen Lyon variety. A dark red, round-shaped berry
with a deeply citric tang which is the perfect foil for mellow cream and
sweet meringue in a pavlova. There are strawberry-teas at the farm and
preserves for sale. Mrs Booth, jam-maker at the farm for 10 years, has
also just published a book of recipes -- Mrs Booth's Preserves.

There is rivalry in the Border towns, usually friendly enough but
there nevertheless. However, let strangers come into their midst and
they'd meet a united front. Doreen Taylor-Wilkie and photographer Jeff
Mitchell enjoy the different characters of each of the towns on their
journey through the Borders.
IN the half-light of the early morning, the eerie notes of the silver
band echo along the old streets of the Border town of Selkirk. They are
a summons to the Souters to celebrate the Riding of the Marches, an old
practice that once ensured that no hostile party had encroached on the
boundaries of the town lands during the previous year.
There are four ancient Common Riding festivals celebrated along the
once hostile borderland between Scotland and England -- Selkirk, Hawick,
Lauder, and Langholm which is further south and now part of Dumfries and
Galloway.
Other towns, such as Jedburgh and Coldstream, both closer to the
actual Border, have also revived or started similar ceremonies. They
mark what was a necessity for the safety of a town in the days when a
band of horsemen coming over the hill could mean reivers (cattle
thieves), feuding neighbours, or hostile English soldiers. To
distinguish the Common Riding party, the rider of old carried the Burgh
Standard and this is still carried proudly today.
What makes these Common Riding days different from the usual town
festival is that they link directly to the past, in some cases going
back as far as the Battle of Flodden Field. Underlying the merriment,
and liberal supplies of drink, is a seriousness and a sense of the
honour done to them still noticeable in the modern young men elected to
carry the flag and lead the town as Cornet or Standard Bearer. With
several hundred horses, crowds, flags, and ceremony, the festivals are
great spectacles but designed for the local folk, and not just to draw
in tourists.
All communities are influenced by their past; none more so than the
people of the Borderland on whom hundreds of years of danger and
fighting have left their mark. Borderers have a wariness of opening up
to strangers, an ironic sense of humour, and an astonishing ability both
to criticise one another and yet stick together in times of trouble, and
against the outside world.
I had lived in Lauder for more than 18 years before, almost overnight
it seemed, I had ceased to be ''Mrs Taylor'', and became ''Doreen''.
There is a deep mistrust of the newcomer who moves in and immediately
takes too active a role in local life . . . a decent interval is
expected.
Though the Borderland is hilly rather than mountainous, it encompasses
almost every type of landscape. In the east are the great cliffs of the
Berwickshire coast, with fishing villages such as Eyemouth, which holds
a Herring Festival each year. Where the tops of the Cheviots line the
Border with England, sheep farming is the way of life. There are many
forests and the heart of the Borders centres around Galashiels, Selkirk,
and Melrose.
Jedburgh is less than a dozen miles from the great rise of Carter Bar.
Going south-west from Hawick through the pass of Mosspaul, the empty
hills press close to the road to Langholm, and roll on to Newcastleton
in Liddesdale. This isolated village has been holding its agricultural
Holm Show and sheepdog trials (on the last weekend in August) for more
than a century.
All this remote land to the south changed hands so many times that it
became known as the Debatable Land. It also made fine reiving country,
where cattle were herded in at dead of night. Even today, you sometimes
hear a black night called a ''reiver's night''.
The horse's importance may have changed but it is still part of Border
life, particularly in the farming areas. Here, there is hunting, and,
arising out of it, Point-to-Point race meetings in spring. All the
competitors must have had at least seven days out during the previous
hunting season, and they are fine horsemen and women who tear over the
jumps. Especially at Mosshouses, between Lauder and Galashiels, and at
Kelso, these are great days out when people take picnic hampers in the
boots of their cars, meet friends, and wander around among the horses.
Kelso Racecourse has held race meetings since 1882 and won the title
of ''The Best Small Racecourse in Britain'' in 1994. Nor is a day at the
Border races the usual snobby parade of clothes and money. It is a place
for farmers and families, and always has a sprinkling of first-timers.
There are Border Horse Shows in many areas but the biggest by far are
the British Horse Society's Scottish Championship Horse Trials at
Thirlestane Castle in Lauder. The small Royal Burgh is the Borders'
northernmost town. The exciting August weekend brings in top riders from
many lands. Sunday is the great day with a gruelling cross-country event
over dikes, gates, water, and huge immovable hazards.
As well, there is the beautiful Thirlestane Castle to see. The
architect was William Bryce, who also built Lauder Kirk (the only
cruciform kirk in Scotland). Once a defensive Border peel tower, the
shape of which is clear from the far bank of the Leader, Thirlestane is
now famous for its elegant interiors and dazzling white plasterwork.
The River Leader runs into the great Border artery, the River Tweed,
which rises at Hart Fell, not far from Moffat and the Devil's Beef Tub,
and alternately rushes and dawdles its way 90 miles down to
Berwick-upon-Tweed. For centuries it has been a link between the
communities and brought prosperity to the farmland along its banks.
Later, the Tweed and its tributaries turned the mill wheels in
Peebles, Innerleithen, Galashiels, Selkirk, Jedburgh, and Hawick and
made the Borders world-famous for their knitwear and tweed. Not only did
this bring wealth; it also gave a pioneer equality between the sexes in
such unlikely places as the great male, rugby town of Hawick, which
still does not include women in its Common Riding ceremonies. Even its
redoubtable Provost, Myra Turnbull, has been unable to crack that one.
Nevertheless, when I first went to Hawick at the end of the 1960s, I
had never seen so many men pushing prams, out shopping on a Saturday
morning long before such scenes were common elsewhere.
The reason was that their wives worked too and needed the weekends to
catch up at home -- catch up, that is, on what their menfolk had not
been able to contribute in the way of home care during the week, for the
men worked shifts and the women worked days.
In the last decade, there has been a decline in the importance of the
woollen industry to the Border economy, but the Woollen Trail, which
tours both working mills and those that are now museums, is a fine way
to learn about the industry and, incidentally, to pick up some good wool
bargains.
One of the most famous houses beside the Tweed is twelfth-century
Traquair, near Innerleithen, Scotland's oldest inhabited house. In 1745,
after a visit by Bonnie Prince Charlie, the laird of the day closed
Traquair's Bear Gates and vowed they would not be reopened until a
Stuart sat on the Scottish throne. They are still resolutely shut.
The grounds hold many special events and Traquair makes its own
popular Traquair Ale in an eighteenth-century brewhouse.
Another beautiful Tweedside house is Floors Castle, the home of the
Duke of Roxburghe, just north of Kelso. The Duke and his family have
their private family wing, and the massive castle, full of priceless
furniture and decoration, surrounded by 56,000 acres, is run as a
business, with a strong sporting side.
There is a garden centre in the big walled garden, and nearby is
Sunlaws House Hotel. An old house in peaceful grounds, Sunlaws was once
the estate office, and still has much of the atmosphere of a private
house. The huge open area in front of the castle makes a fine setting
for pipe-band music and displays throughout the summer.
Between Thirlestane and Floors castles is another famous house,
Mellerstain, the home of the Earl of Haddington. Built in the eighteenth
century by William Adam and his son Robert, like Thirlestane it has
magnificent interior decoration and plasterwork. In the grounds, a
well-established Vintage Car Rally is held each year, as is carriage
driving.
Bowhill, one of the homes of the Duke of Buccleuch, near Selkirk, has
a lovely small theatre, popular for plays and recitals during the
winter, especially during the Borders Festival.
But the best-known Border house has never belonged to nobility, but to
a novelist and sheriff. Abbotsford, the great dream of Sir Walter Scott,
looks over green lawns to the Tweed; it is still the family home of the
Maxwell-Scotts, and Patricia Maxwell-Scott is happy to show visitors the
study and desk where her illustrious ancestor struggled back to
solvency, his library with 9000 books, and the little chapel.
There are more houses like these all over the Borders, opening their
doors to the public and hosting outdoor events. Several of the peel
towers that defended the territory stand as historic monuments, some
like Smailholm, a few miles west of Kelso, dominating the surroundidng
area.
Before the Reformation, the Borders was a great religious centre
though, even then, all four abbeys had suffered during English
invasions. Not far from Abbotsford, Melrose's Cistercian Abbey in red
sandstone is famous for its beautiful stonework -- particularly in the
nave and choir which were partly restored in 1385 -- and for the sense
of humour of the statue of a pig playing the bagpipes on the roof. The
Abbey Gardens are a place of peaceful beauty.
People argue about which of the four is the finest; Jedburgh Abbey, on
the edge of the town, is undoubtedly the most impressive, and has
managed to retain a beautiful rose window despite its closeness to the
Border.
Several other domestic abbey buildings have been unearthed more
recently. Jedburgh also has Queen Mary's House, named after Mary Queen
of Scots. Here, Mary lay ill following a long ride to the bleak
Hermitage Castle to meet the fierce Borderer, James Hepburn, Earl of
Bothwell, whom she married. Later in her troubled life, she is quoted as
saying: ''Had I but died in Jedburgh.''
Dryburgh Abbey is further north, and stands solid by the Tweed, not
far from the famous high road from Earlston that affords Scott's View.
This was one of Walter Scott's favourite places to stop and watch the
three tops of the Eildon Hills, with the great river winding far below.
Close by is Dryburgh Abbey Hotel, a big riverside red-stone house. Near
here it is well worth seeking out the astonishing and hidden statue of
William Wallace, towering above the river.
Kelso Abbey, right in the heart of the town, makes up the abbey
quartet.
As well as the many historic buildings and traces of history,
Borderers and visitors alike prize this wide, lightly populated area for
its outdoor life. The Southern Upland Way starts near Eyemouth, strides
through the Border uplands and on into Dumfries and Galloway for more
than 200 miles to the west coast near Portpatrick.
Cycling and mountain-biking are popular, with the main centre at
Glentress Forest near Peebles, where Scottish Border Trails arrange
tours, rides, and cycle hire.
The most surprising aspect of the Borders is the way in which each
small town has kept its distinctive character. At the heart of a farming
area, Kelso is a market town with a big cobbled square that gives it
something of the air of a small French community. As befits its farming
background, important events are the ram and horse sales and the big
annual agricultural show, as well as Kelso Races.
St Boswells has a spreading village green and, unusual in the Borders,
an almost English-style cricket ground beside the Buccleuch Arms Hotel.
Further north, Lauder has a fourteenth-century royal charter. It was
that rare thing in southern Scotland, a walled town. Today, the lines of
the old walls remain, and its best-known small hotel, the Black Bull,
was once a stage-coach inn.
Borderers describe Melrose as being ''very residential'', and despite
its old abbey, there is a sense in this pretty town that people moved in
to live further away from Galashiels and Selkirk, in the days when the
woollen mills were at their busiest and most prosperous. Close to the
Tweed, it is renowned for good fishing, and has a hilly golf course that
tests the bravest.
The other town that has something of the same quality is Peebles, but
the reason there may be its closeness to Edinburgh, which has turned it
into something of a dormitory town for the city. Innerleithen and
Walkerburn, only a few miles east, are very different, and Innerleithen
has one of the most fascinating museums -- Robert Smail's Printing
Works, with a Victorian office and original old machinery, still used
for printing by organisations such as the National Trust for Scotland,
which has a shop there.
The three towns that show this contrast and competitiveness most
clearly are the three that everyone associates most closely with the
Borders -- Selkirk, Galashiels, and Hawick, the old wool towns. Selkirk
was once the home of shoe-making, hence the term ''Souter'' for its
citizens, and can claim the oldest Common Riding which, within it, has a
ceremony that marks the carnage of Flodden. From the Selkirk contingent,
only one man, Fletcher, returned alive from that dreadful battlefield.
He carried the town flag. As he staggered into Selkirk the old story
goes, he raised the flag above his head to show that it came back
''unsullied and untarnished'', circled it round his head and fell dead.
Today, the phrase is used in all the Common Ridings, and casting the
colours is part of Selkirk's Day. His statue stands outside the town
hall.
The distinctive Border tongue is slightly different between the
communities, easily distinguished by anyone who lives here, and nowhere
is the traditional rivalry shown more clearly than between Galashiels
and Hawick. Where the saying comes from nobody knows, but a favourite
Border quip is: ''Better a lamppost in Galashiels than the Provost of
Hawick.'' It is said tongue in cheek and often in reverse but there is a
grain of real feeling in the joke. Hawick, with a population of 16,000,
is the largest Border town; that may be the reason why it is most often
the target.

THE Orangemen were coming. It was a coup for Kildonnet, a modest
ornament of the Clyde's Riviera, for they would spend a lot. The
prospect excited Major Pringle, the head of the town council.
There might, however, be trouble; but when he discussed matters with
the local police none predicted any.
''They've been here on the Twelfth before,'' said Sergeant Ian
McPhail, his tongue caressing a film of saliva in the manner which gave
his nickname, Juicy Lips.
''They simply parade from the pier to Dhu Park, wi their bands and
banners. It's like Dunoon's Cowal Games, without the games. They hear
speeches, say prayers, eat pieces, pray again, and then go back tae the
boats.''
''I've heard they drink,'' said the Major. ''Aye,'' said the sergeant,
''bit so dis half Kildonnet.''
''Ah. Well, the whole force will need to be out,'' the Major said,
feeling a surge of confidence in his powers of command. ''I know they're
law-abiding folk, but no-one's ever the worse for seeing the police.''
''They're bigoted bastards. They'll veneer a' ower the place,
three-quarters cut,'' said Sanny McGilp, but only to himself. He was a
mere constable and a Barra Catholic to boot, a rare enough specimen in
Kildonnet itself, but in its police then unique. He had, however,
married Jinty Harkness, a member of McDade-Weir Memorial, a fact which
allowed many to give him the benefit of the doubt.
IT WAS possible to hear the bands, even before the Marchioness of
Lorne could be discerned approaching the pier out of a warm July mist.
Flutes and drums drowned engines and paddles. Behind her, but moving
more slowly, as if gliding without mechanical need, was her sister, the
Marchioness of Graham. Accordions, bagpipes, and brass made her sounds
more resonant. All, boats and passengers alike, seemed sustained by the
Firth, cool, and swelling its own cadence.
And when they landed, Sanny, watching from the public gardens, had to
give them a commendation. Their voices almost rivalled the flutes,
cutting the air; and their features, he thought, had all the hackit look
which is the badge of poor Ulster, even when transplanted back to
lowland Scotland whence much of it had come.
His sense of identity with them rose up and overcame his prejudice
completely. Many were young. All seemed happy. None was drunk. Their
noise bubbled, like champagne.
In gaggles, groups congregated, forming into bands, each with a clutch
of adherents. The Major, also watching from afar, admired the speed with
which these assemblies became facsimiles of platoons and companies.
The leaders, to the front, were older men in white shirts under dark
suits, all sashed in orange silk, much be-medalled. Ahead of these in
each unit, a couple of younger fellows paraded little velvet-covered
trays displaying an open Bible, a Crown.
After the leaders came youthful musicians, their collective identity
proclaimed on big drums: ''Coatbridge Hope'' Sanny read on one. Behind
them were women and children, mostly in white shirts and blouses --
sometimes crossed with the same orange silk of the front ranks.
Interspersed were to be banners, and these too were assembled with
military precision. Poles of well-polished wood slipped into harnesses
worn by strapping young men. Cross-pieces elevated 10 feet into the air
exposed more silk: William III resplendent on a white horse by the
Boyne; joyful Londonderry men and women from walls espying vessels of
relief.
It was an impressive display of popular art, of a kind entirely
ignored by academic students of graphic expression. The Major saw it
through military eyes, approving ranks, columns, colours of rally, music
of war, and triumph.
As McPhail had known, they all moved off peacefully with clamour and
clash, advertising in their inability to maintain any military step the
holiday their outing was.
THE WAY BACK in late afternoon was different. All were happy still,
but most were tired and some were drunk. The spirit was different, far
more aggressive, Sanny thought, as he walked with the eight-strong
Kildonnet force, dispersed to represent the law and hold the peace if it
were threatened.
The peace was almost disrupted and the marchers challenged by a
countervailing force. At a natural gap in the procession, where Down
Brae met the main street at Kildonnet Cross, a figure familiar to many
in the town, but entirely unknown to the visitors, appeared suddenly.
Black, mystic, and clad in wool, it was Paramount, a huge ram, the pride
and joy of Denis Louden, a local farmer. Paramount had a wanderlust and
a self-confidence which allowed him to go anywhere. He was an imposing
animal and to those who knew him surprisingly benign, if anything but
sheeplike.
''Oh Christ,'' thought Juicy Lips who was at the Cross as the beast
appeared, ''he'll charge them,'' and sure enough the ram which had
trotted forward into the path of a banner was suddenly transfixed as he
contemplated its advancing bearers. Then, like a Spanish bull in a ring,
he scratched the street with a front paw and lowered his head. ''At
least he has nae horns,'' the Sergeant thought.
The bannermen stopped, apprehensive and almost transfixed themselves,
but people behind were marching still and crowding in on them. Since the
musicians could see nothing, their noise still rose. The banner flapped,
flaunting itself before the animal, which was confused and probably
apprehensive itself. Guessing its doubt, the big policeman stepped right
up to its head and saying quietly, ''Come on, son,'' took a handful of
wool and walked it away down towards the shore road and the police
station. It went like a lamb, its arrest adding to the Sergeant's local
fame; though at the time he was red with embarrassment, and certainly
felt something of a fool when he had to lock Paramount in cell where it
proceeded to pee in a fashion fully commensurate with its size.
AFTERWARDS, Major Pringle said to McPhail: ''You were brave, and
lucky, Ian. It might have ruined a perfect day which went without a
single hitch.'' He could have been wrong, as Sanny McGilp might have
told him. After Paramount and his captor had moved off the whole
celebration began again.
The drums now beat frantic rhythms, flutes squealed beyond reason. The
columns had lost regularity. Banners dipped and swayed as their bearers
executed serpentine movements along the route, while their followers
shuffled in exotic fashion, at once risible and compelling.
Sanny, enjoying himself in spite of himself, was suddenly taken by a
sight and a voice he knew well. A few paces away, the apple of his eye,
11-year-old Dairmid McGilp, was swaying in step beside a large female
youth. One of her hands held a cone whose ice-cream she licked, the
other was laced to a long ribbon-rope which in turn lent some support to
the banner pole which displayed our greatest-ever King.
Sanny could hear their conversation, warm and affectionate. It went on
as he drew nearer to his son, the product of his mixed marriage, a boy
of some religious awareness but of uncertainty and ambivalence.
He heard her: ''Son, dae ye want a shot o ma string?'' and his ''O
aye.''
''Is that awrigh', Wullie?'' she asked the man, who panted as he bore
the pole.
''Sure, hen,'' he answered.
The string was transferred.
He heard her, ecstatic, her cheeks banner-bright: ''Are you no gled
yur no a Cathlic?'' and Dairmid, out of innocence or devilment, Sanny
never knew which: ''Bit A um wan.''
In an instant, bloom vanished, face whitened, lips contorted, she
yelled, as she grabbed the ribbon: ''Wullie! Look at that wean.''
Wullie's pole twisted, the banner wavered, but before anything else
transpired, Sanny had stepped forward and given his favourite what Juicy
Lips would have called ''a thick ear''. As Dairmid ran off into
onlookers lining the street, the once-again-happy string-holder
whispered to his father: ''A'm fer relieved fur the Protestant polis.''

Michael Collins has been described as the really effective Irish
revolutionary. Now, as peace lays down fragile roots, he is being
singled out for star treatment. Eamonn O'Neill examines the man behind
the legend.
LIAM NEESON is certainly a man of many parts these days. Scottish
audiences have been watching him in Michael Caton-Jones's Rob Roy
wearing yards of tartan and addressing fellow stars John Hurt and Tim
Roth in a Scottish accent that sounded like Sean Connery's equally dodgy
Irish accent in The Untouchables. Facts about Rob Roy, though, are thin
on the ground. The same can't be said about the man whom Neeson is about
to play in a new big-budget Hollywood film set to begin filming in the
next couple of weeks in Dublin: Neil Jordan's long-awaited epic Michael
Collins.
This is the film that Ireland has been awaiting for decades and one
senses that Jordan is staying even more tight-lipped than usual about
his pet project. He is only too aware of the great directors who have
fallen by the wayside in the past trying to haul the same story out of
the history books and on to the silver screen. Most agree that Neil
Jordan, with his impressively rich cinema achievements and his
enormously talented literary abilities, is the man to direct the equally
suitable Neeson in the role.
At this point I should confess a personal stake in all this. Since
last year I have been writing a play based on Michael Collins's last
night before he was assassinated in his native Cork in 1922. Plans are
in place for the play to be staged in Edinburgh later this year.
A few weeks after I had launched myself into researching the project,
called God Save Ireland Cried the Hero, I was informed that Jordan's
film would begin production this year. Downhearted, I thought of
scrapping the project, not wanting to be accused of jumping on the
bandwagon. In the end I decided to keep going, not only because close
friends told me the idea of a one-man, one-act play would work but
because I had to admit that I loved the character of Collins and the
period of Irish history in which he lived.
I was born in Scotland to an Irish mother and a first-generation Irish
father, and I am an Irish citizen. My grandfather on my father's side
fought alongside Michael Collins in the Irish Free State Army which was
set up after the signing of the Treaty with Britain in 1921. One of my
earliest memories consisted of seeing a portrait of a handsome soldier
which hung inside the family farmhouse where I spent holidays in the
Irish Republic. I never knew that the young soldier was Michael Collins
nor that the painting was based on a picture of Collins standing at the
graveside of his friend, the Irish President, Arthur Griffiths.
Only my play research would reveal that Collins was a tortured, ill,
young man at that time and would himself be dead a week later. Indeed at
that same graveside a bishop had whispered into his ear the prophetic
words ''Watch, Mick, or you could be next'' as the coffin of the tragic
Griffiths was lowered into the ground.
My family were decidedly pro-Collins so I was brought up with a
somewhat distorted, one-sided picture of the man and his life. Many in
Ireland, though, will await Jordan's film with a different kind of
anticipation. Michael Collins, Eamon de Valera, and the Civil War are
still touchy subjects in Eire. Its no secret that most people in the
powerful Dublin circles who drink in the Shelbourne Hotel bar agree that
there would be no film about Collins without a cease-fire in Northern
Ireland.
In the past year there has been a sense that Ireland has cast off some
of its bloody and bruised past and emerged as a more self-confident
country ready to come to terms with all its faults and flaws. A film
about Collins is seen by many as a small but significant step in that
direction. Certainly the parallels between the story of Michael Collins
and the current political situation can be seen.
Everything from the blood spilt against the British forces by the IRA
during the Black and Tan war, to the mediated cease-fire in 1921, the
acceptance of Collins by British ministers and the subsequent debate
about arms surrender strike chords of familiarity in even the most
casual reader. But that's where the similarity ends. Collins was without
doubt a one-off, an original who wrenched respect from the unlikeliest
of sources among whom an Irishman was as foreign as the man from the
moon.
Michael Collins was born in 1890 in County Cork, only miles from where
he would be killed by an Irish gunman during an ambush in 1922. He first
came to prominence during the 1916 uprising when he served as an aide to
one of the signatories of the proclamation, Joseph Plunkett. By this
time 26-year-old Collins had already lived for five years in London
where he'd worked as a clerk in the Post Office Savings Bank and later a
well-known stockbrokers.
One of the curious facets of Collins's personality was his distinct
lack of overt contempt for the English as a race considering the role he
played in killing many of their number, and the fact that British Forces
burned down the Collins family home as a deliberate act of vengeance
when he was on the run.
In the wake of the 1916 rising Collins made two decisions which were
to seal the fate of the British Empire and Ireland. First, he decided to
organise the Republicans in a much more sophisticated manner than the
appallingly disorganised way in which they had gone about their Easter
assault on the GPO. Collins would later describe this rising as having
''the air of a Greek tragedy about it''.
The second decision was equally important -- he decided to never again
allow the Irish forces to fight from a static military position. He
believed that blood sacrifice was all very well and good in poetic
orations but that in reality it served little real purpose for a
non-professional army which was heavily outnumbered and out-equipped.
Thus the IRA concept of ambush, hit-and-run was born.
Robert Kee in his revered TV series on Irish history described Collins
as Ireland's ''only really effective revolutionary'', a statement which
even the most grudging commentators agree with. His own personal guile
and attention to meticulous detail are beyond doubt and the records
which exist are chilling in their portrayal of a man who could organise
a group of Dublin Republicans into a selective killing machine.
Their actions were enough to frighten the British into a truce and
turn Collins into nothing short of a living legend. Terms in British
prisons after the uprising in 1916, leadership of the secret Irish
Republican Brotherhood, political agitator, financial magician who
raised thousands for the republican cause, cold-blooded ruthless
mastermind behind countless ambushes, and rabble-rouser were all faces
that Collins wore comfortably.
British records from the period show just how easily he ran rings
around them. The British, using a range of highly dubious Irish
informants in Dublin, had convinced themselves that Collins was
travelling around Dublin in heavy disguise with an armed bodyguard of at
least a dozen men. During this time-frame Collins was in fact cycling
around the city on a bicycle wearing nothing more than a grin and a
smart two-piece grey suit for protection.
He cultivated contacts at the highest level within the British forces
and on one occasion spent the night inside Dublin Castle raking through
the British files for their records on him and his men. On the way out
of the door he stole the day-book as evidence that he'd been there.
But that was only one side of Michael Collins. My research has
uncovered many other faces. He was a man capable of bullying and
bragging, who was driven by a blinding sense of duty and
self-righteousness to his vision of a united Ireland. He had an
affection for Eamon de Valera, but certainly felt out-manoeuvred by the
intense, self-conscious American-born Republican who was revered by his
peers who felt left behind when he worked out his thoughts on people and
situations using obscure mathematical doodles.
Archives reveal that Collins was furious at being sent to London in
1921 to negotiate with Lloyd George for a treaty. Collins felt that de
Valera should have gone. However, his IRB brothers-in-arms urged him to
go but were equally keen to get him back alive. In London during the
treaty negotiations he stayed in a separate house from the rest of the
delegation, travelled secretly back to Dublin most weekends to report to
the IRB leadership, and had an aircraft, which had been purchased
surreptitiously, on standby at Croydon airfield in case he had to leave
London at speed.
Reading between the lines one senses that Collins was as afraid of an
Irish attempt on his life as a British one. His final words on signing
the treaty were directed to Lord Birkenhead with whom he'd become
friendly during the negotiations. ''I've just signed my own death
warrant,'' remarked a pale-faced Michael Collins. One year later he
would be dead.
This time next year Neil Jordan's film will be hot news. He still
makes the headlines in Ireland. Only last week some letters between
Michael Collins and a girlfriend were auctioned off in Dublin for
thousands of pounds. There are many who would rather Collins was
forgotten, remembered only as the man who, by signing the treaty with
Britain, more or less started the Civil War which split friends,
families and the whole country down the middle. Certainly Eamon de
Valera went out of his way to bury the legend of the Big Fella during
his lifetime, allowing his mask to slip only once when he remarked that
''History will record the greatness of Collins and it will be recorded
at my expense''.
Others dismiss Collins as a hypocrite who attended mass as easily as
he hopped beds with women. By late twentieth-century moral standards his
behaviour with women seems more stupid than bad. He himself was well
aware that his undoubted affection for Hazel, the wife of English
painter Sir John Lavery, could land him in hot water with the boys back
home. He took steps to discourage her from writing to him and believed
that her mail to him was being intercepted by anti-treaty forces.
None of this diminishes the fact, however, that at the age of 30 he
was in charge of no less than 14 government departments and would
eventually become Commander-in-Chief of the Free State Army. His
military planning ability was terrifyingly imaginative and accomplished
-- at one point he even held a secret meeting with Lawrence of Arabia
who was keen on coming to Ireland to head a Free State flying-column.
The fact remains that the deal he brokered with Britain for 26 of the
32 Irish counties has never been improved upon since his death. He saw
this deal as a ''freedom to achieve freedom''. In his final year he was
already thinking beyond the Civil War and was planning Ireland's future
within an international context. He was a ruthless, scary man but there
is, curiously, no hard evidence that he ever personally killed anyone in
his life.
When he was shot during an ambush by anti-treaty forces in Cork on
August 22, 1922, he was probably handling a rifle in a combat situation
for the first time. It was a tragic, although typically Irish, way to
die at a time when many families, including my own, were watching sons
walk out of their rural homes wearing Irish uniforms with a cause on
their young minds.

In the midst of many re-releases and compilation albums, Ken Gallacher
puts the case for a classic clarinettist.
BROWSING through the new biography of Kingsley Amis it was no surprise
to find his love of jazz mentioned, albeit briefly. The novelist was,
after all, jazz critic of the Observer for a period in the fifties just
shortly before his Oxford contemporary, the poet Philip Larkin, peformed
the same function for the Daily Telegraph.
It wasn't surprising, either, that the clarinettist Pee Wee Russell
was given honourable mention. The surprise came in the literary allusion
used by Amis and Larkin in those undergraduate days they shared together
in the thirties.
Russell was, they enthused ''our Swinburne and our Byron''. On another
occasion Amis described the clarinettist as ''the greatest lyric poet
since Yeats''. You wonder what the man himself would have made of such
talk.
It's doubtful if he would have tried to understand it all. But, Pee
Wee being Pee Wee, he would have enjoyed the adulation he received from
two of Britain's major men of letters.
Russell, of course, was used to the company of writers and artists. In
his most Bohemian days he would hang out in the Cedar Tavern in
Greenwich Village with painters such as Jackson Pollock and Stuart
Davis, both of whom were enthralled by the sounds he produced on the
bandstand at Nick's.
Later in his life Russell would paint and what he heard in the Cedar
may have helped him with his primitive-seeming canvases.
I can remember visiting Russell back in l966 at his New York apartment
and his feisty wife, Mary, had all his available paintings strewn around
the room to let me see them.
He offered me one but because I faced another four or five weeks on
the road with Celtic I declined, thinking there would be another chance
in the future. There wasn't to be one and it's a decision I regret to
this day.
Strip away the literary allusions and the one thing Amis and Larkin
had right about Russell was that he was a true original. Listen to any
of his records today and you will find that out. They remain as valid
now as on the day when Amis described him as ''wielder of the wildest
measure ever moulded by the lips of man''.
It was late in his career before he found critical acceptance. When he
moved into the company of mainstreamers such as Buck Clayton in a heroic
session on Swingville; or with Coleman Hawkins and Bob Brookmeyer, among
others, on an album for the Candid label.
Predictably, Russell never enjoyed any great financial success. Much
of that was his own doing. He drank heavily for most of his life. Tales
abound of his exploits and one story sums up his lifestyle in the
thirties.
He was a sideman with Louis Prima, then a decent New Orleans trumpeter
rather than a Las Vegas entertainer. Prima tried to stop him drinking.
It was impossible, of course. Russell used to keep a quart of whisky on
each side of his bed in the hotel because, he explained, if he wakened
during the night he would't have to go through the agonies of trying to
remember where he had left his booze.
Even in the sixties it was clear that old habits died hard. He took me
to a recording session -- a Yank Lawson album titled Ole Dixie.
I picked him up at his apartment and before we got a cab he went into
the local liquor store and collected a bottle of vodka, admonishing me
-- ''Don't tell Mary''. He needed his ''jug'' just as he had done when
he started recording in New York with Red Nichols some 40 years earlier.
But, for all his problems, the music he played was sublime. The work
on the Condon Commodores will never be surpassed but Amis, who still
listens to his old favourites, will no doubt prefer Billy Banks's
Rhythmakers from l932 when Russell was memorably paired with Henry
''Red'' Allen. These tracks provided Amis and Larkin with a lifelong
affection for the man from Muskogee, Oklahoma. An affection I have
shared since I first heard him on a Muggsy Spanier 78 on Tempo while I
was still at school.
It's time, surely, for some of his gems to be re-issued on CD instead
of the endless stream of material from less original musicians. The
irascible Amis would surely agree with that.

FISHES smell. Especially if they have been passed through the bodies
of thousands of guillemots, mixed with feathers and salt spray and sun
baked on to a sea cliff. Yet how evocative that stench is. Lie among sea
pinks and white campion peering down to the crowded ledges, the birds
coming and going like Jacob's angels and the shifting sea below. Close
your eyes. Close your ears. If you breathe in, you couldn't be anywhere
else.
A happy guillie aways faces inwards. The first thing the rows of birds
do when they see your face against the sky is to turn round -- ready, of
course, to fly. This is why those old prints of castle-crowned sea
stacks were always wrong, for you can't etch a brown back against a
black cliff. They nest in biggest numbers where the rock is bedded
horizontally. The long ledges of Handa or Copinsay are the archetypal
breeding ground. The further north you go, the higher proportion have
the white spectacles known as bridling. And yes, those eggs really are
pear-shaped to stop them falling off the ledges, an explanation too
simple for researchers originally to credit.
There are 70,000 on Noss near Lerwick, 40,000 at Fowlsheugh just north
of Inverbervie -- more than half a million birds in Scotland. You could
not get a more sensitive barometer of the health of the sea. That is why
it is always good to see the young birds in July, swimming on the water
far from their birth ledge, calling incessantly while a single parent
dives for fish around them. It's their dad, not their mum, incidentally.
Young birds head across to Scandinavia first, then down the north sea.
You often see them in winter floating offshore or whirring between the
wave troughs on their penguin wings. Thousands, especially first winter
juveniles, are ''wrecked'' when their food supply fails -- and we have
all seen what an oiled guillie looks like since the Braer disaster: an
image of human carelessness and not happy at all.

With the Open almost upon us, Liz Taylor finds a series of golfing
memorabilia sales which are well above par.
GOLF enthusiasts are in for a treat next weekend. Not only do they
have the Open to look forward to at St Andrews on July 21, but on July
14, 15, and 16 there are three special golf sales in Scotland.
The sales tee off in Glasgow on Friday the 14th, when Christie's are
holding a golf event at their Bath Street rooms in which they are
offering a painting entitled A Golfing Party, the South Downs by George
Henry, RA. This picture was exhibited in the Royal Academy in 1930 and
Christie's expect that it will now fetch between #25,000 and #30,000.
Another valuable painting in the sale is J F Macintosh Gow's watercolour
On the Links at St Andrews which carries an estimate of around #10,000.
Two less expensive items are bronze figures of golfers -- one by Hal
Ludlow of Harry Varden (#700-#900), and the other an Austrian
gold-painted bronze of an anonymous golfer which is expected to sell for
about the same price.
On the following day, enthusiasts will travel to St Andrews where
Sotheby's are holding their golf sale in St Mary's College. David Neech,
Sotheby's golf expert, waxes enthusiastic when he describes the delights
on offer: ''We have some wonderful pictures including a superb
watercolour by Hassall. It was done around 1910 and is called The Missed
Putt. He treats the subject jokingly.'' Joke or no joke, the picture is
expected to sell for around #8000.
David Neech is also engagingly enraptured by a set of 18 original
watercolours painted by an artist called Michael Brown for the Life
Association of Scotland who used them as calendars for the years 1892
until 1916, when their production of golfing calendars ceased.
He thinks that because of the difficulty of printing from original
colour, the first 14 pictures were done en grisaille (in grey), but for
the last four years they were done in full colour as printing techniques
had improved. He has estimated the pictures at between #15,000 and
#50,000.
The top price will be paid for what Neech considers to be the best of
the lot, what he calls ''a collective portrait of the surviving Open
Champions in 1906 posed outside the Royal and Ancient clubhouse. The
likenesses are photographic, absolutely stupendous! They look more like
themselves than they do in old photographs.''
Another coup for Sotheby's is the sale of the Open Championship medal
won by Max Faulkner in 1951 at Portrush, which was the only time the
Open has been played off the main island of Great Britain. It is
expected that the medal will sell for at least #20,000 and David Neech
said the reason Max Faulkner was selling was that he is now elderly and
worried about security. ''He doesn't want to keep it at home in case of
burglars, and he doesn't want to lock it up in the bank, so he is
reluctantly selling it,'' he said.
A pair of blacksmith-made irons dating from between 1750 and 1810 are
also coming up for sale with amazing estimates of between #30,000 and
#40,000 each. These old clubs both bear labels saying that they were
exhibited as golfing antiquities in the Glasgow Exhibition of 1911.
At the other end of the price scale is a little copper kettle on a
tripod stand made of crossed golf clubs. Neech thinks it would have been
used by golfers around 1910 for brewing a cup of tea half way round the
course, but, he speculates: ''It must have taken a long time for the
kettle to boil because the burner's very small.''
The last event of the great golfing weekend is to be held in Edinburgh
on Sunday, July 16, at Phillips in George Street, where it will be
possible for patrons to park -- a rare event indeed.
Bob Gowland, Phillips' golf expert, listed the attractions they are
offering, beginning with a couple of eighteenth-century irons at between
#5000 and #8000 each, and a play club by Hugh Philp at around #8000.
There are also some feather golf balls -- so called because they were
filled with feathers -- one of which was signed by Tom Morris, the Grand
Old Man of Scottish Golf who ruled the roost at St Andrews in the
mid-nineteenth century. His golf ball should fetch around #12,000. A
high-flier indeed.
Feather golf balls appear regularly at golf sales and on their Friday
event Christie's are also selling two, but, though they are as old as
Phillips', their estimates are only between #1500 and #2000 because they
are not signed.
Phillips are also offering a set of scorecards from the archive of
Prestwick Golf Club relating to Open Championships held there in the
late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. These cards are expected
to fetch up to #1000 each depending on the fame of the player.
Another set of different cards -- cigarette ones this time -- are also
in the sale with an estimate of around #3000 for the set. They were
issued by the firm of Cope in 1905 and show 50 famous golfers.
In the painting section there is a set of 12 portraits of Royal and
Ancient members and captains of the 1880s and 1890s. They are small
watercolours, only three inches by two, painted by Thomas Hodge. A
larger oil painting of golf on the Braid Hills, by W B Melrose in 1895,
is estimated at between #10,000 and #12,000.
Enthusiasts are prepared to pay high prices for all sorts of things
connected with their favourite sport and a bound set of Golf Magazine
for the years 1890 until 1898 is expected to find a buyer at around
#8000.
MARKET TIP
* Hunt around at car-boot sales and charity jumble sales for bargains.
They are still to be found. Recently a browser at the car-boot sale held
every Sunday on Kelso racecourse paid #10 for a box of junk which
contained a nineteenth-century French ivory figure on Benjamin Franklin.
Last week it came up for auction at Phillips in George Street,
Edinburgh, with an estimate of #800.
Even more surprising was the #6 which a customer at a ''Help The
Aged'' sale in Jedburgh recently paid for a Wemyss pig. She even queried
the price and was told, ''Yes, it's #6''. The pig could be worth more
than a hundred times that sum.

I STEP into John Buchan country this morning to explore Broad Law
(2756ft), southern Scotland's second highest mountain. Buchan, Lord
Tweedsmuir, was a ''man for all seasons'': soldier, statesman, lawyer,
poet, writer, angler. He was born in Perth in 1875, educated at
Hutchesons' Grammar School, Glasgow, and ended a long and distinguished
career as Governor-General of Canada.
I remember Buchan most fondly as poet and angler: his memorial, Fisher
Jamie, written for a friend who died during the First World War: ''Puir
Jamie's killed, a better man you would'na find to busk a flee or wield a
gad or burn a pool frae Berwick tae the Clints o' Dee . . . '' Jamie was
in my thoughts on a bright morning when I parked by Hearthstane on the
A701 Broughton/Moffat road, ready to climb the hill.
The River Tweed margins the road; a bustling, busy little stream here,
bordered by rowan and whin, dimpled with rising trout, hurrying east to
grander things at Melrose, Kelso, and Coldstream.
Broad Law is the ideal introduction to hill walking: easily
accessible, safe, approachable, welcoming, offering a wonderful day out
amid splendid Tweedsmuir Hills. Be as energetic as you choose. Spend a
couple of hours or the whole day wandering along the surrounding tops:
Cairn Law (2352ft), Porridge Cairn (2490ft), Cramalt Craig (2723ft).
A track leads south-west from Hearthstane, following the line of
Hearthstane Burn, up the glen between Hogg Hill (1560ft) and
conifer-packed Great Hill (1478ft). Three easy miles, past Geddes's
Well, brings you to the top of Broad Law which is crowned by a radio
receiving/transmission station: a tangle of jagged wire fences
protecting the dull-grey receiving dish.
There are several options. Walk east and descend from Broad Law to the
south of Polmood Craig. Cross the Linghope Burn and follow the fence for
one mile to reach the summit of Cramalt Craig, an ascent of 500ft. From
the cairn on top of Cramalt Craig continue north-west over a grassy
ridge, descending into the glen of the Polmood Burn. A track leads back
to the A701 in two miles.
Alternatively, from Broad Law, walk south over a fine plateau to
Porridge Cairn and Cairn Law. The ridge then swings, overlooking the
silver/blue of Talla Reservoir, reaching Talla Cleuch Head (2264ft),
unnamed on the OS Map, after half a mile. The descent from Talla Cleuch
Head down Muckle Side is steep and should be approached cautiously,
particularly in wet weather.
Once down, turn right along the reservoir road and continue to the dam
at the north end of Victoria Lodge. After leaving the dam, watch for a
gate on your right leading to a bridge across Talla Water. Cross the
river and stumble through the undergrowth to find the line of a disused
railway. This convenient route winds round wooded Cockiland Hill and
brings you back to the main road via an old bridge over the River Tweed.
Those with less time to spare can attack Broad Law from the car-park
by the Megget Stane in the steep-sided glen between Talla Linnfoots and
St Mary's Loch at Cappercleuch. This is the most direct approach and the
round trip takes about two-and-a-half hours. Simply follow the fence
line north to the summit which is reached after a vigorous hike of a
couple of miles.
But it would be a pity to rush this expedition. The view from the top
embraces a matchless, gentle, green wilderness, and the sheer joy of
striding over the springy moorlands is worth a full day out. The
Tweedsmuir Hills may lack the majesty of Scotland's northern peaks but
their grace and beauty ensnare the soul and the sweet sound of ''Talla
loupin ower its linns'' stays in the heart forever.

A Hebridean war galley is not the most usual vehicle for raising
funds, but, as Peter Evans discovers, that very fact is the key to
success.
HEBRIDEAN war galleys are pretty thin on the water in the Clyde these
days. But any good Glasgow citizen a little the worse for drink will not
be seeing things when just such a vessel drifts up the river on July 10,
making for the quayside at the Moat House Hotel.
The Aileach, as she's called, is really a Celtic longboat or
''birlinn'', but Hebridean war galley sounds much more romantic for the
purposes of sponsorship and publicity.
When she wends her way up the Clyde, the Aileach -- the only
square-rigged, 16-oar galley of her kind in the world -- will be at the
end of a voyage that started at Port Askaig on Islay, took her across
the Sound of Jura to West Loch Tarbert and over the narrow neck of land
at the head of the Mull of Kintyre; back in the water at East Loch
Tarbert and down through the Sound of Bute to enter the Firth of Clyde
for the final stretch to Glasgow and a rousing reception at the Moat
House.
Organisers of the trip, retracing in reverse the fourteenth-century
voyage of a fleet commanded by Robert the Bruce, hope it will raise
#20,000 to aid research into the crippling disease cystic fibrosis.
The scheme is the brainchild of Andrew Murray, from Ashgill, near
Larkhall, whose five-year-old daughter Fiona suffers from the disease,
so he is personally acquainted with its life-threatening and
debilitating effects.
One in 25 people carries the faulty CF gene, and if both partners in a
relationship are carriers, there is a one-in-four chance of a baby being
born with the disease. When Fiona Murray was born, her parents were told
she might live into her early teens.
But Fiona Brennan, Scottish regional director of the Cystic Fibrosis
Trust, says research into the condition has led to a gradual increase in
life expectancy. ''When the trust was founded 30 years ago, a baby would
be lucky to survive the first few years. Now children can look forward
to reaching adolescence, and in some cases they are living into their
early thirties.'' That's possibly because researchers have isolated the
faulty gene.
Cystic fibrosis is a condition that causes body fluids to become more
viscous than normal. All the vital organs are affected, but
significantly the respiratory system, and sufferers have to undergo a
rigorous routine of physiotherapy, two or three times a day, to disperse
the fluids.
''It's something that seems to strike at the Celtic fringe of Europe,
and we are at the sharp end of that fringe in Scotland,'' says Andrew
Murray. He and his wife Allison have two other children besides Fiona --
Kenneth, aged seven, and Shonagh, three -- neither of whom is affected
by CF.
This latest project with the Aileach is not the first zany
fund-raising idea Murray has dreamed up. Not for him a walk along the
West Highland Way or a run round the houses -- the more unusual the
scheme the better. ''You can think of lots of ways to do it, and some of
them are dead easy. I just thought it was more interesting than a
tea-party,'' he said.
Two years ago, Murray organised a sponsored cycle ride, to raise money
for Yorkhill Children's Hospital in Glasgow. An ordinary enough event on
the face of it, except the ride was done on a wooden velocipede -- a
replica of the world's first bicycle.
The route from Dumfries to Glasgow retraced that taken 150 years
previously by the bike's designer, Kirkpatrick MacMillan, who cycled to
Glasgow to show his new invention to his brother, a teacher at the high
school.
When he arrived in the Gorbals he was involved in an accident and
nearly knocked over a little girl. As a result he was fined five
shillings by a local magistrate for travelling at high speed. The event,
supported by The Herald and Evening Times, raised more than #12,000.
This time, Murray's sights are set even higher.
He's not absolutely sure where the latest notion sprang from, but puts
it down to ''ploughing my way through Nigel Tranter's books'' on
Scottish history. ''I think the idea of retracing a route that had been
taken by Vikings and Scotsmen for centuries was attractive,'' he says.
The historical setting is 1315, when Robert the Bruce was king in
Scotland, while his brother was king in Ireland. On Islay, John of Lorne
was attacking vessels passing between the two countries. Bruce decided
he had to be dealt with, so with Angus Ogg, Lord of the Isles, he
assembled a fleet on the Clyde to address the problem.
The fleet set out with Ogg taking the main part south to round the
Mull of Kintyre and head north towards Islay. Bruce took a smaller
section of the fleet up the Kilbrannan Sound to the west of Arran as far
as Tarbert, where his men dragged their boats across the Mull of Kintyre
to West Loch Tarbert. From there he sailed to Islay, where the forces of
John of Lorne were outflanked and destroyed.
Celtic longboats like the Aileach were the main form of transport in
the Western Isles up to the sixteenth century. After this many were
destroyed by the crown in numerous wars with the Lord of the Isles. They
were also outclassed by the three-masted sailing ships with guns that
were developed in later years.
The Aileach, owned by the charitable Lord of the Isles Galley Trust,
was built in 1992 in Ireland, from drawings made from carvings on Celtic
standing stones. She will be crewed on the voyage from Islay to Glasgow
by 60 people at various stages, all of whom are being encouraged to
raise #300 in sponsorship.
Skipper for the trip is Wallace Clark of County Derry, Northern
Ireland. His vessel this time is a mite more substantial than the
leather boat he sailed from Ireland to Iona. He has also sailed the
Aileach before from the west of Ireland to the Hebrides and written a
book about it -- The Lord of the Isles Voyage.
Fiona Brennan, who co-ordinates all fundraising efforts north of the
Border to aid cystic fibrosis research, says 600 families in Scotland
have to deal with the disease. ''To have a major event like this is
crucial to keep us in the public eye. It helps us immensely, not only
because it's going to be a great money-spinner but also because it's
going to involve so much publicity and will heighten awareness of the
disease.''

* AFTER almost a century of claims that it is a major pollutant, the
motor car might soon be joining the green brigade as an active member.
Ford are teaming up Engelhard, a catalyst system developer, in a bid to
produce the first ever smog-guzzling car.
The two companies will be working closely for the next nine months on
a test fleet using new technology which has the potential to turn car
radiators into pollutant-destroying air filtration systems. The
intensive research programme will include studying the durability of
catalytic coatings and its effect on radiator performance.
The joint research programme will test more than 30 types of Ford cars
in nine countries including the UK where the Ford Mondeo will be fitted
with the technology later this year. Ford say that the co-operation with
the catalyst company will help save time and development costs. They
also claim they will share their findings as they proceed, with other
car makers, industrial companies, regulators, and the public.
''Our global reach gives us the opportunity to evaluate this
technology in key markets, which is a valuable tool since pollution,
particularly low-lying smog, is not a problem unique to any one
company,'' chief technical officer Lou Ross says.
Engelhard's new catalyst system converts ozone, a main component of
smog, into clean breathable oxygen. Current auto catalysers destroy high
percentages of pollutants like organic compounds, nitrogen oxide, and
deadly carbon monoxide from combustion engine exhausts before they are
emitted into the atmosphere. The residual pollutants, together with
industrial emissions and naturally occurring compounds, can form
polluting ozone through atmospheric photochemical reactions in the
presence of heat and sunlight.
Engelhard's initial testing shows their PremAir systems destroy up to
90% of the ozone they scoop from the air. The system involves a
catalytic coating on a radiator and possibly the air-conditioning
condenser. As air passes over the radiator the catalysts convert ozone
to oxygen.

YANKS. Dontcha hate 'em?
Scots students have to beaver away, cramming for exams, huddled in
cold and dingy tenement lofts eating baked beans and porridge, and
wondering where their next student loan will come from.
American students? They're different, if this latest piece of news
from Purdue University, Indiana, is any yardstick. This university has a
class of aviation students, no less. To teach them to fly, they've just
bought a Boeing 727-200 Level C flight simulator. It's a high-fidelity
replica of the cockpit of a Boeing 727 aeroplane. Seniors in the
professional pilot programme use the simulator as a learning laboratory
for their flight-engineer certification and corporate flight training
without having to risk getting off the ground.
* IF anyone fancies a vacation with a difference, consider a stay at
the Institute of Food Research in Norwich which extends a warm welcome
to healthy specimens. This may interest those bored with the Costa and
may help increase the level of human understanding.
The IFR want to attract volunteers for two projects funded by the
Ministry of Agriculture and Food aimed at improving diet and health. The
first study will investigate how glucose is used by the body, the second
the absorption and metabolism of copper.
For the glucose research, volunteers much be aged between 18 and 60,
be non-smokers, have no record of coronary heart disease, diabetes, or
high blood pressure. One more thing. They will have to be able to
swallow a narrow tube and undertake a series of tests in a special
accommodation unit at the IFR lab.
Team leader Dr Geoff Livesey says: ''The results will help identify
which types of starchy food we should eat. The information will
contribute to better dietary advice and ultimately improved health for
the UK population.''
The volunteers will live in the Human Nutrition Unit at IFR for three
periods of eight weeks. Food and accommodation are free and all
reasonable expenses will be reimbursed.

MYTHS: You are now a fugitive, a leader without an army, but only a
few hours ago on the braes of Bennachie you almost succeeded in leading
the combined tribes to a victory over the Romans which surely would have
had the whole of Europe sitting up and taking notice.
Calgacus: Yes, it's hard to believe that in a contest where we
dominated for long periods we have come away utterly defeated,
empty-handed, and with great loss of life. Having gathered the
Caledonian host and girded ourselves for a supreme effort, we really
thought we could send the legions south to think again.
Myths: What, if anything, can you learn from the battle which we
understand the Roman historian Tacitus has styled Mons Graupius but in
the glens is being talked of as the greatest disaster of the modern era?
Calgacus: I'm certain that this was one of the most severe tests which
the Romans have had to face since coming to these shores. No doubt their
histories will speak of the mountains of Caledonian dead but the Roman
losses were also heavy. There has always been a debate here among the
northern tribes and in the joint command about how best to meet the
Roman threat -- by force or arms or stealth. Now, we are of one mind.
Never again will we attempt to confront the Romans head-on, in line of
battle.
Myths: But surely the efficiency of the Roman armies was legendary.
Was this not a tactical blunder?
Calgacus: As I say, there were two schools of thought about how to
damage the enemy. Now everyone has seen that in a pitched-battle
situation the Romans are all but invincible. Their discipline,
determination, and qualities of leadership combine to make them the most
difficult of opponents. Even when we thought we had taken the day with
our war chariots, the Batavian and Tungrian cohorts regrouped as if by
sorcery.
Myths: What then will be the future strategy of the combined tribes?
Calgacus: Simply put, it will be to hit and run, to strike and fade
from sight. We now want to make life as uncomfortable as possible for
the occupiers, so miserable, in fact, that they will venture only
reluctantly beyond the security of their encampments. In this we will be
assisted by our formidable allies, the weather and the terrain. We want
to create an atmosphere where the Senate will question expenditure on
this northern adventure, to draw a line, build a wall or whatever, and
say enough is enough. Our contacts within the Roman administration
suggest there is no real desire to press Roman order in the far north,
certainly beyond the Forth and Clyde.
Myths: Clearly, you are talking about a lengthy campaign?
Calgacus: I fear so. Many of us who fought yesterday will not live to
see the departure of the legions from the Highlands. It may take
generations. Already there are signs south of the estuaries that people
are happily being absorbed by and accepting the Pax Romana. For us in
the north they have created a desert which I'm sure they will call
peace. Yesterday we learned a painful but important lesson. We must use
our wild countryside to harry the Roman wherever he appears and make
this a land of misery for the occupier.
Myths: Can you take anything positive at all from the sad events of
the past 24 hours?
Calgacus: Of course we can. After centuries of squabbling and feuding
the combined tribes have shown a unity of purpose which bodes well for
the future. It will take us months, perhaps years, to regroup but by
then we will have developed a style of resistance which invaders, Roman
and otherwise, will learn to dread.

* THE recipe for holiday peace of mind is simple, writes ERIC KENNEDY.
It would appear to come from some bloke at the Scottish Office who sees
life as a mix of Neighbours, The Beechgrove Garden, and Crimewatch.
Take one camera (for photographing your valuables), add a set of
lights (for your time switch) and bring in a bit of action (your
neighbour willingly mowing your lawn while you are away) and you're off.
Not, of course, before securing the garden hut with proper security
locks, bolting the ladders to the wall with a close-shackle padlock and
heavy-duty chain, alerting the police and Neighbourhood Watch to your
absence, doing a deal with the Post Office to keep your mail, and making
sure you have ''Postcoded Property'' warning stickers all over the
windows.
That will alert the man in the mask and striped sweater to the fact
that you have security-marked your valuables. He won't be able to see
through the window in any case. Even if he did, you will naturally have
moved all items of value out of sight, taken jewellery to a safety
deposit box, or even ''considered installing a small floor safe''.
The Scottish Office booklet, somewhat alarmingly entitled When You
Steal Away, is clearly aimed at a nervous race, albeit one blessed with
excellent and industrious neighbours. This new safety campaign, launched
along with the Royal Mail, even suggests the chap next door could sweep
up leaves while you are away.
He might as well, because you will already have asked him to cut the
grass and generally make the place look lived-in.
So here's the checklist, omitting only the items already mentioned:
* Make sure your house looks occupied.
* Arrange for curtains to be open in daytime.
* Use automatic time switches to activate lights and a radio.
* Move TVs, videos and hi-fi away from windows.
* Put all outside tools away.
* Don't leave home address showing on luggage for outside journey.
* Lock all outside doors and windows.
* Set burglar alarm if any and tell police who keyholder is.
* Don't put surname or address or even house number on set of keys you
leave with neighbour or relative.
* Don't lock internal doors or desks -- they might be forced if
someone does break in.
* Cancel milk, newspapers, etc. Do so discreetly: a burglar may be
listening.
* Get Royal Mail to hold your post for you under its Keepsafe scheme.
* Get your neighbour to push circulars and freesheets through the
letterbox and well out of sight.
* Cut the lawns before you go.
* Arrange for pets to be properly looked after.
The last one presumably removes the possibility of your cat dropping
its guard and letting a burglar in, or carelessly telling other cats or
even cat burglars that the house is empty.

If Edward Baird's works last forever, Patrick Elliott suggests it
might be because he seemed to take forever.
EDWARD BAIRD died at the age of 44 having completed less than 30
paintings. The son of a sea captain, he was born in Montrose in 1904.
Apart from his studies at Glasgow School of Art and a brief foray into
Europe on a travelling scholarship, he rarely left the town. His chronic
asthma anchored him to his studio where he painted at a tortuously slow
pace: he constantly reworked paintings, rarely regarding them as
finished, and was loth to part with any.
A private, droll man, who was by all accounts difficult to get to
know, Baird was irritated by the ostentation of the art world and by the
verbosity of modern art theory. All this did his career no good, of
course, and he remains a largely unknown figure, a maverick in Scottish
art.
At Glasgow School of Art, where he studied from 1924-27, Baird struck
up a close friendship with James McIntosh Patrick. Patrick recalls that
even then Baird distinguished himself by the slow tempo of his painting
and by the meticulousness of his approach, but it was an approach which
suited him, for in 1927 he won the Newbery Medal awarded to the best
student of the year.
Returning to Montrose, Baird settled into an unglamorous routine,
spending most of his time in the studio painting, passing the evenings
with his few close friends, and then returning to his mother's home
where he lived for all but the last four years of his life.
His friends were mainly staunch socialists and nationalists. In the
1920s Montrose was home to lively cultural and intellectual forces: the
nationalist writers Hugh MacDiarmid and Fionn MacColla lived there, as
did the Paris-trained sculptor William Lamb and the architect George
Fairweather.
Fairweather, whom Baird painted in 1935, was his closest friend. The
portrait is typical of Baird's work, displaying an almost photographic
realism combined with a measured if slightly quirky sense of
composition. For this portrait, as for others, Baird used photographs to
help register precise details.
Other paintings of the period are franky surreal. One, The Birth of
Venus, shows a fetching nude washed up on Montrose beach, with a giant,
suggestively erotic, shell placed in the foreground alongside a curious
array of objects which include navigational instruments and an antique
sculpture. This saucy picture was given to McIntosh Patrick as a wedding
present!
Another, Unidentified Aircraft (Glasgow Art Gallery), painted during
the war, is a magnificent Montrose townscape featuring three disembodied
heads in the foreground. Their eyes nervously scan the ominous, inky
blue sky, as if they had heard an aircraft and are waiting to catch
sight of it. Perhaps Baird's greatest portrait is the extraordinary
intense one of his uncle, Walter Graham, now in Dundee Art Gallery: for
hard-edged, ''count-the-bristles-on-his-chin'' realism, Baird had few
equals in contemporary European painting.
From 1938-40 Baird taught at Dundee College of Art -- the first time
he had earned a regular income -- and in the early 1940s worked as an
official war artist. He spent half of 1944 in hospital, suffering from
pneumonia, but on his discharge the following year almost immediately
married Ann Fairweather, George's sister.
He then began a huge painting of The Howff, a Dundee cemetery. Ann is
shown sitting on a tombstone, wearing a distant melancholy expression.
The choice of subject surely connects with the artist's frail grip on
life and with Ann's approaching widowhood. Baird seems to have wanted to
leave behind one masterpiece, a figure composition on a grand scale. But
ill-health cruelly frustrated his ambitions and Baird died in 1949
leaving the painting unfinished and his life's work scarcely known.
Patrick Elliott is an assistant keeper at the Scottish National
Gallery of Modern Art. A Thomas Annan photograph was incorrectly
captioned, last week, as a self-portrait. The subject was, of course,
David Livingstone.
