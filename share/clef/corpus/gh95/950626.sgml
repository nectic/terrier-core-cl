WHEN the Arran Banner broke the story, it shook the world. Well, it
rattled a few cages in London, Paris, and Seattle, which is not bad for
a weekly island journal with 620 subscribers.
The news that local authorities were planning to build a tourist
attraction on the tranquil west coast of Arran provoked howls of
protest, notably from England and overseas.
Officials of Cunninghame District Council in Irvine, as masterminds of
the project, received almost 100 letters expressing varying degrees of
outrage -- although less than half of them were from Arran.
Ms Angela Delaforce, from SW10, registered her shock at this ''act of
vandalism''; Mrs J T Millington-Drake, from SW11, said she was appalled
to think that the peace and beauty of the west of the island was under
threat, and urged the council to ''please listen to the voices of
dissent now''; J Beckwith, in SW3, dismissed it as ghastly and
ridiculous, and growled: ''Why can you never leave things be?''
Ms Sharon Burgett was sleepless in Seattle at the prospect of ''yet
another part of Britain's natural heritage falling prey to those who
would make a fishbowl of this untouched landscape, for a cast of
thousands to peer into, leaving their sweetie wrappers behind on this
lovely sacred ground.'
An old soldier wrote from England to say he had fought fascism from
North Africa to Berlin, and he was disgusted to find it alive and well
in Irvine.
So what is all the fuss about? A theme park at Machrie? A leisure
centre in Blackwaterfoot? Hardly. The council's scheme is more modest.
In association with Scottish Natural Heritage and the Scottish Tourist
Board, which are providing the core funding, the council is proposing a
small information centre for people visiting archaeological sites around
Tormore.
It envisages a circular timber frame building clad in Douglas Fir,
with windows of non-reflecting glass and a conical roof of blue-grey
Cumbrian slate. The structure will measure 20 metres in diameter, and
7.5 metres at its highest point, and be set in a conifer plantation.
Within, it will offer exhibitions, audio and visual displays, and
hands-on computerised systems explaining the development of human
settlement on Arran over 8000 years.
It will also, to the ire of its critics, have a small cafe. The cost
is estimated at #500,000, with half of the amount coming from Objective
1 Euro-funding.
The architects, Brooke, Millar and Peden, of Glasgow, says its
''Discovery Centre'' has been designed to blend into the landscape. It
will complement the nearby archaeological sites, encourage visitors to
explore the island, and benefit the local community.
The district council planning department agrees. ''We feel it has been
carefully designed and located so as not to cause any adverse impact on
the environment,'' a spokesman said last week. ''The whole idea is to
inform the public about the fragility of the landscape, so that they
care for it rather than harm it.''
Not so, cry the objectors. It is just another gimmick dreamed up by a
free-spending quango, that will bring busloads of careless day-trippers
tramping over sites of major importance, ruining the charm and character
of the area. Nor will it benefit the locals, because the visitors will
spend all their money in the tearoom and then go back to Brodick.
The planning spokesman replies: ''We think there may have been some
misconceptions about the scale of this project. We do not believe it
will bring significantly more people to the area, it is more a question
of providing a facility for those who already visit it.''
The site of the controversy is Torr Righ, the Hill of the King, which
lies on the coast between Machrie and Blackwaterfoot, in the south-west
of the island. It is covered with pine forest, and from a clearing near
the road a footpath follows the upper contours of the hill to the coast,
and then along the shore to a series of sea caves in the sandstone
cliffs.
The principal attraction is the King's Cave -- named after a highly
dubious association with Robert the Bruce -- which has a number of
important early Christian carvings.
More spectacular vestiges of early human settlement lie scattered on a
moor a couple of miles to the north-east of the hill. At the end of a
cart-track through farmland, are six stone circles erected about 1750
BC, when this was one of the most important ritual landscapes in Bronze
Age Britain. All around are cairns, some of them Neolithic, dating from
before 3000 BC.
There is no question that the standing stones are magnificent, rising
starkly from the moor in a haunting, enigmatic tableau of ceremonies and
rituals lost in the mists of time.
The question now is whether they are likely to be swamped by hordes of
tourists. It seems unlikely and, in contrast with the shrill chorus of
disapproval from outsiders, local opinion on the Discovery Centre is
divided.
From one of his meadows on the slopes of Torr Righ, farmer Angus Smith
can see visitors walking to and from the standing stones across another
part of his land.
''You'd hardly credit the damage some of them do,'' he says. ''It's
not deliberate I suppose, it's just careless, damaging gates or leaving
them open, and letting their dogs foul pasture land. But it costs us a
lot of money and trouble.''
Mr Smith is not opposed to the Discovery Centre as such but he would
prefer it to be sited somewhere else.
''I don't want to sound like a 'not in my backyard' kind of person but
there's an element of that. My main concern is that it will encourage a
lot more people to go to the stones and damage my farm. I lodged an
objection, but I don't suppose it will have much effect.''
A few miles up the coast at Whitefarland, design consultant Charles
Anderson expresses a common view: ''We don't really see how this centre
will benefit those who live here, and we think it's a huge waste of
public money, when there are other things, like sewage treatment, crying
out to be done.''
In the post office at Blackwaterfoot, however, grocer Angus Cameron is
enthusiastic. ''This is not Blackpool,'' he says, ''and it's not a
fairground they're building. I think it's a wonderful idea, because
they're bringing people to this side of the island for the right
reasons. People should be encouraged to see all of Arran, not just spend
a few hours in Brodick and the castle.''
A local woman enjoying a quiet drink in the Blackwaterfoot Hotel,
takes a similar view. ''It's not a bowling alley or an ice rink they're
planning, it's something of interest. I can't understand what all the
fuss is about.
''The people that complain are the ones that come up here in the
summer to their idyllic wee country cottages and hang up 'do not
disturb' signs as if they own the place. Well Arran's for everybody that
likes it, not just them.''
Not everybody on the island has taken sides on the issue. An elderly
man emerging from Mr Cameron's shop says: ''A discovery centre, ye say?
I haven't heard about it, myself.'' In the bar of the Kinloch Hotel,
where the local Shiskine football team is celebrating a 3-1 victory over
Lamlash, the prevailing wisdom is that there are more important things
to worry about.
A builder quenching his thirst after a long day's work in the sun says
it's about time the council repaired the roads and did something about
the ferry fares. ''This discovery centre won't really affect us, but the
prices of the ferry do. They're killing the place.''
In Brodick, island tourist chief Charles Currie regards the project as
ecologically sound tourism in sympathy with the environment. He also
thinks it will be a good place for families to visit when it's raining,
as it often is on Arran.
He says it is reckoned the centre will attract about 30,000 of the
island's 200,000 visitors per annum, which is not much more than the
number estimated to be visiting King's Cave presently.
''The idea is not to swamp our archaeology with people, but rather to
provide an interesting and educational interpretation for those who are
interested in it,'' he says. ''I would hope that people's fears will be
allayed by the building when they see it.''
They will soon have that opportunity, for the battle of the Hill of
the King is effectively over.
Last week, Cunninghame District Council concluded that the proposed
centre will not detract from the wild character of the west coast, or
attract a large numbers of tourists who would not otherwise visit the
area. Accordingly, the planning application was approved. Work is due to
begin on the site in the autumn, with completion scheduled for next
Easter.
The letters pages of the Arran Banner in the next few weeks are
expected to make interesting reading.

IT WAS mission accomplished at the European Cup in Lille yesterday
when Liz McColgan got the precious world championship qualifying time
that she needed to take her to Gothenburg in August when she will
attempt, to regain the 10,000 metres crown she won in 1991.
McColgan, running her first track race since the 1992 Barcelona
Olympic final, was single-minded in her approach to the 25-lap event,
ignoring the fast pace set by the German and Italian runners, and
instead churning out steady but lonely 78-second laps to get inside the
32min 30sec target time, as she placed fourth in 32-22.09.
Those points helped the Great Britain women's squad to finish third in
a match dominated by Russia, but in which there were three individual
wins for Britain, including the outstanding 400m victory on Saturday for
Glasgow's Melanie Neef.
Yet Neef surpassed even that 51.35sec personal best when she led off
the British 4 x 400m relay team yesterday to be clocked unofficially at
51.1 as the quartet placed fourth.
For McColgan it has been a long road back from illness and injury.
Even now, the 31-year-old mother from Arbroath trains on the track by
running anti-clockwise, the opposite direction to normal, in order to
protect the knee injury which nearly ended her career.
''I couldn't expect much more today,'' said McColgan, dripping with
sweat after her effort in the 25[DEG] heat. ''I'm probably a month
behind in my training and I've only done track work for four weeks, so I
am very strong but slow.
''It was a steady run, but it was a bit disheartening only finishing
fourth. The main thing was to run 32-30 as easy as possible, and I've
done just that.
''Now I can concentrate on getting ready for Gothenburg.''
To do that, McColgan will probably race at Sheffield next month and
have a spell training at altitude in the French Alps.
Neef's season takes on a totally new aspect now that she has stepped
into world class with a performance that ranks her just outside this
year's top 10.
''I can't believe it,'' the 25-year-old City of Glasgow athlete said
after having won her European Cup gold medal on Saturday. ''I broke 52
seconds for the first time only the other week.''
Britain's Jonathan Edwards produced the longest triple jump ever in
Lille yesterday.
The Gateshead Harrier came up with an astonishing 18.43 metres with
his second jump, but a wind of 2.4 metres per second ruled it out as a
record -- the legal limit is 2.0. However, he then broke his own British
record with a lega1 7.72m.
Linford Christie, the men's team captain whose two individual wins and
relay anchor-leg boosted the team to finish second in the cup behind
Germany, said after the competition finished that he would not go back
on his decision to retire without defending his Olympic 100m title in
Atlanta next year.
Despite setting cup records of 10.05 in the 100m on Saturday and
20.11, his fastest 200m for seven years, Christie could not be persuaded
to go back on what he announced in a tearful television interview a
fortnight ago.

BURTON Group plans to follow a #3m-#4m refit of Debenhams in Glasgow
(pictured right) with similar improvements to its department stores in
Edinburgh and Stirling, writes IAN McCONNELL.
Only five of Debenhams' 83 stores are in Scotland, but they account
for just under 10% of the chain's turnover. This was 4.2% higher at
#539m in the first half of the current financial year.
Work on the top floor of the flagship 165,000sq ft Glasgow store
should be complete by September and will bring Debenhams' World of
Bright Futures concept to the fore.
This encompasses children's clothing, snack bars and electronic and
computer products.
Detailed plans for Edinburgh and Stirling have not yet been finalised.
Debenhams' stores in Aberdeen and Dundee will remain unchanged for the
time being.
Burton employs more than 2000 people in Scotland, where, in addition
to Debenhams, it has 150 Dorothy Perkins, Evans, Top Shop/Man,
Principles and Burton Menswear shops.
Last month, Burton announced a 91% increase in first-half pre-tax
profits to #67m.

MANY years after having raced on the Tay in the Squib national
championships with his father, Russell Peters completed a
second-successive title win on the Vauxhall Ultra 30 Grand Prix circuit,
taking victory from Lawrie Smith's Frontera on the finish line of the
deciding final race by just six feet.
Peters rounded the final mark 50 yards behind Frontera. While Smith
elected to bear off at the turning buoy towards the shore and set his
spinnaker, DBS's tactician, Jeremy Robinson, called on former 505 world
champion Peters to sail the offshore jybe.
Although this was against the ebbing tide, DBS picked up a solid gust
which they held for a thrilling final 400 yards, while the pressure on
Smith's Frontera crew told and they fluffed their penultimate jybe,
losing valuable seconds.
''All down that last stretch I was screaming at Russell to steer down
and stay with the gust to close on Lawrie, and then in the last seconds
to just point the boat at the line when I knew we could get the bowsprit
over first,'' said Robinson, who came to Dundee following victory in the
505 class at Kiel week.
The weekend's six races treated the spectators to some nail-biting
racing.
Saturday's second and third races brought spectacular capsizes. Glyn
Charles' Cable &amp; Wireless was dragged over by their half-hoisted
spinnaker, while Eddie Owen's Last Second avoiding action to prevent a
rules infringement caused his Mobil Team a chilly swim to shore.
Results:
Race 4 -- 1, Cable &amp; Wireless (G Charles); 2, Frontera (L Smith); 3,
Orbitel (M McIntyre); 4, DBS (R Peters); 5, Debra (R Yeoman); 6, Mobil
(E Owen).
Race 5 -- 1, DBS; 2, Mobil; 3, Frontera; 4, Orbitel; 5, Cable &amp;

Race 6 -- 1, Frontera; 2, DBS; 3, Mobil; 4, Debra; 5, Orbitel; 6,

3i, Britain's largest venture capital group, is expected to announce
its move into the personal finance market next month with the launch of
its Personal Equity Plan (PEP) and a regular savings scheme.
This comes just a year after the group was successfully floated on the
London Stock Exchange.
The decision to launch the new products follows the news that Inland
Revenue rules for corporate bond PEPs now allow the inclusion of
preference shares and convertibles.

Linzer ASK 2, Partick Thistle 2
AT times it may have been more like a close season practice match in
front of 1500 people than a European tie, but Partick Thistle did not
let themselves or Scotland down in their first foreign adventure for 23
years.
Some of us were hanging our heads in fear of embarrassment when they
went two behind within six minutes of this Intertoto Cup tie, but the
men from Maryhill know a thing or two about recovering from adversity
and they were soon about to defy forecasts of doom yet again.
By half-time they had cut the deficit to a single goal, when Rod
McDonald scored, and midway through the second half they completed a
fine comeback by equalising through Derek McWilliams.
Unlike any other Scottish team in European history, Thistle had the
considerable burden of not knowing who they were playing until about 10
days before this tie. That left little time to make travel arrangements
or find out anything about the opposition. Manager John Lambie was
offered help with a video of the Austrian team, but discovered it was a
film of the wrong side, city rivals Linz.
Typically, he merely shrugged his shoulders and got on with it. The
team got on the plane without their baggage and that was after
inadvertently delaying the Lufthansa flight from London when they caused
great consternation at Gate 6 in Heathrow's Terminal 2.
The story, I think, goes this way. After their British Midland shuttle
from Glasgow they were sent on a circular tour of the Chiltern Hills
awaiting permission to land. The party, all of whom -- directors,
management and players -- were in track suits, arrived at Terminal 1
half an hour late.
They made their way dutifully to the correct terminal, but something
went wrong between check-in and departure gate, perhaps best summed up
by the distress of one of the Lufthansa ground staff.
As the plane, filled with passengers anxious to leave around the
scheduled departure time, was kept on hold awaiting the Jags, she did
her best via intercom to establish what had happened.
Just before director Brown McMaster, who struggled manfully to defeat
the inevitable, appeared carrying a bundle of passports, she lost her
previous cool authority.
''This is chaos,'' she shouted in a shrill voice, suggesting that the
strain was beginning to tell.
Thistle supporters could have been useful counsellors at this point,
but they might have been stuck at the immigration desk along with nine
of the players whose passports were now apparently inside the
international departure lounge where they had hoped to be.
Eventually, half an hour late, flight LH4017, with Thistle comfortably
aboard, left for Munich, where the squad was to take the
three-and-a-half hours bus journey to Linz. It didn't work out that way.
The entire team kit, strips, et al, had not made it from Terminal 1 to
Terminal 2, perhaps reluctant to leave Old Blighty.
Again, the reason was one of those unforseeable snags that lie in wait
for the best intentioned. It appears that a dispute between the
respective baggage handlers caused the delay, the German plane was not
waiting any longer and Thistle arrived with the prospect of taking on
Linzer ASK without their boots.
The kit finally arrived late on Saturday night, but too late for the
directors to change from their tracksuits as they were taken out for
dinner by the Austrian club officials.
The players took it all with an admirable pragmatism but they may
still have been dreaming of the summer hols they missed because of this
competition when they were caught flat-footed.
Within four minutes Steve Pittman fouled Thomas Weissenberger and
Anton Haiden fairly rammed in the free kick, although Nicky Walker
seemed to slip.
Two minutes later the hundred or so fans in the meagre crowd were
tempted to head for the bars. Mark Weissenberger, who was having his
first game for ASK, took a pass from his brother Thomas in a breakaway
and beat Walker.
There were a few further alarming moments before the Firhill side were
able to demonstrate that they were seriously involved in the game. Then
they took almost complete control and when they pulled a goal back in 32
minutes, it was well deserved.
A cross by Alan Dinnie was headed against the bar by Roddy Grant and
there was McDonald in the right place to manoeuvre it over the line.
Thistle replaced McDonald, who had taken a foot injury, with Wayne
Foster before putting on Andy Gibson for Stewart Ayton. Foster was
involved in the equaliser in 66 minutes when he flicked the ball to
McWilliams who hit a tremendous shot into the net.
Albert Craig who was booked for dissent, twice had the ball in the net
but was offside on each occasion and in the last couple of minutes
Thistle replaced McWilliams with Kevin McKee.
Naturally, Thistle were both delighted and relieved. Said Rod
McDonald: ''We had a nightmare start, but you must remember we have not
played for six weeks. If we can beat Keflavik on Saturday we will have a
great chance of topping the group. We can still get AC Milan in the UEFA
Cup.''

GREG Norman, runner-up at the US Open a week ago, won the Greater
Hartford Open yesterday to complete an astonishingly profitable month of
golf.
Norman, who has made a career of second-place finishes, had an eagle
at the fifteenth to close with a one-over-par 71 for a two-stroke
victory that yielded a first prize of $216,000.
That raised his winnings for June alone to $781,780 and pushed his
earnings for 1995 past $1m.
He started this lucrative string by winning the Memorial ($306,000),
finishing fourth in the Kemper Open ($52,780) and taking second at the
US Open ($207,000).
''Golf's a wonderful game,'' said Norman, who injured his back at
Hilton Head in April and took six weeks off. ''You never know what's
around the corner.''
Norman, who lost his lead to Fuzzy Zoeller at the thirteenth, finished
with a total of 13-under 267, setting a course record by a stroke.
Zoeller was bidding for his first title in nine years until a
double-bogey at the seventeenth at the Tournament Players Club at River
Highlands.
Leading scores (Americans unless stated):
267 -- G Norman (Australia) 67, 64, 65, 71.
269 -- K Triplett 64, 67, 69, 69; D Stockton 65, 68, 68, 68; G Waite
(New Zealand) 66, 67, 67, 69.
270 -- B Henninger 66, 67, 72, 65; D Pooley 67, 72, 66, 65; F Zoeller
70, 63, 66, 71.
Other scores included: 272 -- C Pavin 70, 67, 66, 69. 273 -- V Singh
(Fiji) 68, 66, 68, 71.
* PAUL Broadhurst, the former Ryder Cup star who at the start of this
year feared for his future, won the Peugeot French Open in dazzling
style in Paris yesterday.
Twenty-five months on from his last victory, the 29-year-old from
Atherstone in Warwickshire sank a 15-foot birdie putt on the final green
for a course record 63 and an eight-stroke victory over Cheshire's Neal
Briggs.
But while it was ecstasy for Broadhurst -- the #91,660 first prize was
more than twice what he earned all last year -- it was agony for
Costantino Rocca. The 38-year-old Ryder Cup Italian, three clear
overnight, finished 11 shots behind. From the moment he double-bogeyed
the first two holes it was an X-rated Rocca horror show.
Broadhurst became the forty-second member of the European Tour's
millionaires' club. Leading scores (British or Irish unless stated):
274 -- P Broadhurst 67, 75, 69, 63 (#91,660).
282 -- N Briggs 73, 69, 68, 72 (#61,110).
284 -- P Fulke (Sweden) 69, 76, 71, 68 (#34,430).
285 -- S Lyle 75, 69, 70, 71; G Turner (New Zealand) 70, 70, 71, 74; C
Rocca (Italy) 69, 72, 66, 78 (#23,350 each).
Other scores included: 289 -- J M Olazabal (Spain) 69, 79, 71. 290 --
A Hunter 69, 73, 76, 72. 294 -- P Lawrie 77, 72, 74, 71. 295 -- G Brand
Jr 74, 76, 75, 70.
301 -- S McAllister 76, 73, 75, 77.
* TONY Jacklin shot a closing 75 for a three-round aggregate of 224,
eight over par and 21 shots behind Bob Murphy in the US Senior PGA
Nationwide Championship in Alpharetta, Georgia. Leading scores:
203 -- B Murphy 71, 64, 68.
205 -- H Irwin 70, 65, 70; B Summerhays 63, 71, 71.
206 -- I Aoki 69, 70, 67.
207 -- T Weiskopf 75, 66, 66; G Marsh 69, 67, 71.
Other scores included: 216 -- G Player 75, 71, 70. 217 -- L Trevino
72, 74, 71. 224 -- T Jacklin 75, 74, 75.
* LORA Fairclough, from Lancashire, came from behind to clinch her
third Tour victory and her second of the season when she shot a closing
round of 68 to win the European Masters at Cleydael in Antwerp
yesterday, writes Bill Johnson.
With a 10-under-par aggregate of 206, Fairclough finished two strokes
clear of Federica Dassu, from Italy, and Yorkshire's Alison Nicholas to
earn a #22,500 winner's cheque.
Fairclough started the day three behind Nicholas.
Cathy Panton-Lewis was the best of the Scots after a closing 74 left
her on 220, one ahead of Dale Reid, with Lindsay Irvine on 222. Leading
aggregates (British or Irish unless stated):
206 -- L Fairclough 71, 67, 68 (#22,500).
208 -- F Dassu (Italy) 66, 72, 70 (#15,225).
209 -- A Nicholas 66, 69, 74 (#10,500).
211 -- N Fink (Austria) 74, 68, 69 (#8100).
212 -- L Maritz-Atkins (S Africa) 76, 70, 66; M Hageman (Holland) 72,
71, 69; K Orum (Denmark) 71, 70, 71.
213 -- K Webb (Australia) 72, 73, 68; R Hetherington (Australia) 70,
71, 72.
Scottish scores: 220 -- C Panton-Lewis 73, 73, 74. 221 -- L Irvine 77,
72, 73. 222 -- D Reid 76, 72, 73.
* BETSY King completed the last step of her 18-month quest to enter
the LPGA Hall of Fame by shooting a four-under-par 67 and capturing the
$650,000 ShopRite LPGA Classic. In winning her thirtieth title, King
ended a stretch of 41 tournaments without a victory and automatically
joined 13 other greats in the hall. Leading scores (Americans unless
stated):
204 -- B King 66, 71, 67.
206 -- R Jones 68, 71, 67; B Daniel 68, 70, 68.
207 -- V Skinner 72, 68, 67; T Green 69, 70, 68; M Redman 68, 68, 71.

TOM McKean will know today whether he faces another nightmare start to
an athletics season.
The stampede of photographers and sports writers at Saturday's
Scottish Athletics Championships told the story . . . McKean had once
again failed to win a championship for which he had appeared a dead
cert.
Despite reaching the 800 and 400 metres finals, McKean and Scotland's
other best-known athletics son, Brian Whittle, left with not a title
between them, and with a question mark over their ability to win a race
against time.
McKean, 31, and chasing his seventh senior two-lap title, was driven
home by his wife, Yvonne, clutching an ice pack to his right calf after
having failed to finish. Whittle, also 31, withdrew before the 400m
final, his hamstrings too tight to race.
The demise of the two most consistent Scottish male athletes of the
last decade, with 12 titles between them, drew the final sparkle from a
championship which produced not a single senior record. Half of the 24
finals contested on Saturday's concluding day went out of Scotland --
five of them to Ireland.
McKean had appeared in control of the 800m final, poised to cut down
teenager Des Roache, who had had the temerity to grab the lead before
the bell. But he caught his toe, accidentally, on a rival's foot, he
believes, throwing all his weight onto his right leg.
''I felt a spasm at the top of the calf and stopped in case I tore
something,'' McKean said. ''Joan Watt, my physio believes if I had
continued I would have torn something badly and my season would have
been over.''
He had delayed the start of his season until Friday's heats because of
a problem in the same calf, but on the opposite side.
''There is no question of it being a recurrence,'' he added. ''The
race was too slow and that was my fault. I see Joan again on Monday, but
she believes I should be OK. I hope to run the Lanarkshire League on
Wednesday -- I promise you it will be the fastest one ever -- and then
race in the Gateshead Games on Friday.''
There he will face Curtis Robb, Britain's fastest man this year, in a
race which will confirm how sound are McKean's prospects of qualifying
for the World Championships, via the AAA Championships, which are less
than three weeks away.
Paul Walker, second last when McKean stumbled onto the infield with
180 metres remaining, powered through to take the title in 1min
49.71sec.
With Whittle a reluctant sideline observer, Ireland's defending
champion, Paul McBurney, held off Fifer James Beattie to take the title.
''I still believe I can make the worlds in Helsinki,'' insisted Whittle,
who was also having his first run of the season.
Graeme Croll won the steeplechase for the third successive year,
completing a unique championship double and laying claim to the title of
iron man of Scottish athletics.
Less than 19 hours earlier, the Cambuslang man had won the 10,000m
title. He now plans to run the 'chase at the AAA Championships, provided
he can get time off work.
Phil Mowbray, who lost a debut UK vest to a virus during the winter,
showed he has completely recovered by out-sprinting Grant Graham to win
the 1500m in a time almost a second-and-a-half faster than Gary Lough,
Britain's European Cup runner, achieved in Lille.
Hailey Haining was hailed as the new Liz McColgan when she finished
seventh in the World Junior cross-country, then Britain's best ever
placing. But she had not raced on the track for three and a half years
until she won the women's 5000m on Saturday -- her first ever race at
the distance.
That Jocelyn Harwood could win the title at the age of 37 says
something abouth the quality of women's sprint hurdling. But the
defending champion, Sarah Richmond, was absent, denied the right to
start even though she insisted she had posted her entry and there was a
vacant lane.
Pamela Anderson set a Scottish under-20 record in the women's triple
jump with 11.91m, and Fiona Hunter an under-17 best with 11.81m. The
Fife under-15 relay squad also set a Scottish age best in the 3 x 800m.

JURGEN Kohler, joining Borussia Dortmund in a #1.5m deal from
Juventus, yesterday predicted that Italian football will no longer
dominate Europe.
The last of 12 Germans to play in Serie A, Kohler said that the mass
exodus of foreign players would shift the power to England and the
Bundesliga. ''Serie A is finished as an attractive and effective
league,'' he insisted.
''Players have come and gone without being able to change the
Italians' defensive mentality, which will now become much worse.
''I am happy to be returning home where football can be enjoyed.
Crowds are at record levels there and it is the same in England. Teams
from these two countries will rise to the top.''
Dortmund, the new champions of Germany, have also targeted the
controversial Columbian striker Faustino Asprilla. He has been fined
#20,000 and transfer-listed at #7m by Parma for criticising coach Nevia
Scala.
* BAYERN Munich have come under fire for offering a cut-price transfer
deal for Borussia Monchengladbach to win the German Cup.
Before yesterday's victory over VfL Wolfsburg, Bayern had promised
they would slash #1.5m off the price of Michael Sternkopf if Borussia
won, which they duly did.
This guaranteed Bayern a place in the UEFA Cup, but Wolfsburg have
protested to the German FA. A spokesman said: ''These are the tactics of
a bully. How can little clubs succeed against such methods?''
* CZECH keeper Jan Stejskal has resigned from international football
as a protest against corruption in his country.
The captain of Slavia Prague accused the FA of instructing referees to
favour Sparta Prague to ensure they won their championship. Slavia were
six points clear in mid-season but were overhauled by their city rivals
for their twenty-first league success.
* TURKISH media magnate Cen Uzam is determined to emulate Silvio
Berlusconi by turning his club, Istanbulspor, into Europe's top team.
The first step to rivalling the exploits of AC Milan has already been
achieved by taking the club back to the first division after an absence
of 23 years. Former Dutch national coach Leo Beenhakker has been
installed with Fritz Korback being lured from Swiss champions,
Grasshoppers, as his assistant.
Beenhakker, who has acquired the Ajax pair, Peter van Vossen and John
van den Brom, is confident Uzam's ambitions can be achieved. He
insisted: ''It has been proved in several countries that a new team can
be built and become a power within four years. Blackburn Rovers, Parma
and Deportivo la Coruna have all shown what can be done.''
* FIFA state that heading the ball back to goalkeepers will be
disallowed as part of the campaign to make football more attractive.
* MARCO van Basten will re-launch his injury-plagued career when he
reports for training with AC Milan on July 20.

CARNWATH'S Jenny Armstrong and Greta Scott, aided by Mount Vernon's
Ann Spence, carry Scotland's hopes into today's British championship
triples final in Portrush after a disappointing weekend.
The Scots had to settle for second place in the Home International
championship on Saturday and yesterday lost out in the semi-finals of
the singles, pairs, and fours.
The makeshift Scots trio came about after the death of Carnwath's
Margaret Shearer since last year's Scottish championship finals and,
with the rules determining that a player from the runners-up club take
over, Spence stepped in to fill that role.
The Scots staged a great recovery to run out 21-13 winners over Wales
after trailing 8-0 after four ends. Providing the opposition in the
final are the English champions from Surrey, Chrissie Winter, Pam Garden
and Doreen Hankin, who beat Ireland 23-11.
In the singles, Betty Smith was beaten 25-8 in 17 ends by Welsh
champion Betty Morgan, while in the pairs May Crossley and Jean Roberton
surrendered with just 18 of the 21 scheduled ends completed.
In the fours, the Glengowan rink were beaten 21-12 by the English side
from Huntingdonshire.

SCOTTISH internationalist John Sherban clocked 30min 8sec to win
yesterday's Vale of Leven Polaroid 10k road race at Alexandria.
Tommy Murray was just six seconds adrift while third-placed Steven
Wylie held off the challenge of Alan Puckrin to clinch the Polaroid race
series title.
Commonwealth Games representative Vikki MacPherson was an easy winner

57sec.

Dunbar, are understood to have been away on holiday for the last 10

YOUTH homelessness in Scotland is rising sharply because of conflict
within the family, according to a pioneering study, published today,
about young people's patterns of leaving home.
The breakdown of marriages and the shifting of responsibility for
supporting young people from the state on to families are among factors
cited for the tensions which drive increasing numbers of youngsters from
their parental homes.
In Leaving Home, by Dr Gill Jones of Edinburgh University's Centre for
Educational Sociology, 60% of homeless young Scots blame family conflict
for their plight and a quarter report living with a step-parent at the
age of 16.
Once they leave home, youngsters with step-parents also receive less
financial help and find it more difficult to return, the report
concludes.
The 12-year study is the first to compare the growth of youth
homelessness in Scotland with the rise in under-18s who opt for
independence.
Dr Jones said: ''The changing of family structures is likely to
continue the trend toward youth homelessness. When there is marriage
breakdown, the conflict between partners rubs off on the children and
affects at least one parent's relationship with the child.
''You also find the extended family suffers in such cases and young
people who in the past could have gone to aunts and uncles or
grandparents now lack this option.''
Dr Jones said she was most concerned that while the risks of leaving
home were increasing, the trend towards doing so continued to rise.
Another problem she identified was that more youngsters leave home to
seek work or take up training places without adequate public housing or
benefits provision to support them.
''One the one hand the Government promotes an 'on your bike' mentality
towards jobs, while on the other its benefits policies encourage staying
at home. Youngsters find themselves pulled in two different
directions.''
Leaving Home concludes that more respite care should be available for
young home-leavers and calls for a more flexible housing and benefits
network.
A Scottish Office spokesman said yesterday: ''The Government provides
very substantial sums of money every year to local authorities to tackle
housing problems. Until we have seen the report we would not wish to
comment further.''
The study was welcomed by the homelessness campaigners Shelter. Ms
Kate Caskie, deputy Scottish director, said: ''The increase in divorce
rates has resulted in more young people walking out, particularly where
there is tension between step-parents and teenage children.''
Mrs Nicola McInulty, the single persons manager of Glasgow District
Council's homeless persons unit, said that even in families which stayed
together, there were other tensions which prompted youngsters to walk
out.
She added: ''In my experience of dealing with the young homeless, many
come from homes where the entire family is unemployed and the youngster
and parents are living on top of each other all day. Young drug use is
also a problem for which there is inadequate support to help families
cope.''
More than 10,000 people between 16 and 25 apply to Scottish councils
for housing every year under the homeless persons legislation.
Meanwhile, Mr Bill Speirs, the STUC deputy general secretary,
yesterday called for a national minimum wage to wipe out youth poverty.
Addressing the annual STUC youth conference in Stirling, he said:
''Scotland's young people are being consistently cheated. Far too many
young workers are in jobs in hairdressers, bars, hotels, shops and
restaurants where they are cruelly and simply exploited, some for less
than #1.50 an hour.
''That's why we have to campaign for every working person to have the
legal right to have their wages and conditions of work negotiated by
their chosen trade union.''

MORE crime has been committed at this year's Glastonbury music
festival than at the 1994 event.
As the festival began its third and final day yesterday, police said
252 people had been arrested -- 60 up on last year -- including 40 for
drug dealing and eight for other drug offences.
Avon and Somerset Police said 238 drug seizures had been made -- more
than twice as many as last year. A total of 650 crimes had been
committed -- 50 more than in 1994 -- including 23 robberies and 490
thefts.
The crackdown on drugs involved searches of vehicles coming on to the
site and a hotline for information about dealers. Substances seized
include amphetamines, heroin, ''magic mushrooms'', ecstasy,and LSD.
Earlier in the sell-out festival near Shepton Mallet, an illegal music
factory was raided at the site. More than 300,000 bootleg CDs and
cassettes worth more than #500,000 were seized. The factory operators
had equipment capable of recording music being played at the event.
A production line had been set up in two caravans capable of turning
out up to 50 bootleg cassettes every two minutes.
Tapes of live performances of bands playing at the festival were being
sold to queues of rock fans for #5 each. Counterfeit CDs imported from
the Continent were also on sale at #15 to #16 a time.
More than 80,000 fans enjoyed a programme of 1000 acts on 17 stages
around the 600-acre site at Worthy Farm. Organisers will give #250,000
in profits to Greenpeace, Oxfam, Water Aid, and local charities.

<TEXT>
MILLIONS of motorists are unaware of the punishments if they get
caught driving over the alcohol limit, a report says today.
One in four does not realise there is a fine if caught drink-driving,
while six in 10 do not know that jail is a possibility.
Two in three people cannot state the minimum length of a road ban,
with a third thinking it is six months instead of 12.
Ninety-eight per cent of the 1000 people questioned did not know that
it is virtually impossible to hire a car for 10 years after a
drink-drive conviction.
Only one person in 20 was aware that penalty points stay on a licence
for 11 years.
Many underestimated the cost of insurance once a driving ban is lifted
-- nearly half believed it doubled while only seven percent knew it
often jumped five-fold.
The statistics are in a report called Crime and Punishment by the
Portman Group, a drinks industry body working against drink-driving.
It says that, despite public awareness campaigns over the past 15
years, many motorists are unaware of the consequences of drinking and
driving.
The Portman Group is urging key players in the motor and insurance
industries to back the Government's campaign against drink-driving.
It is pressing petrol firms, car makers, and insurance firms to
include a warning of the consequences of drink-driving on forecourts and
in brochures.
Home Office figures show that nearly 2000 drivers a week are
prosecuted for drink-driving. Last year, police tested nearly 700,000
drivers suspected of being over the limit.
Dr John Rae, director of the Portman Group, said: ''Widespread
ignorance of the drink-drive laws demonstrates that there's still much
to be done to educate the public that alcohol and driving don't mix.
''I am not really surprised by our report's findings. Many motorists
are dimly aware of the penalties of drink-driving.
''Our research shows that with greater awareness of the penalties for
the crime, many drivers would be persuaded to think twice before risking
it.
''We believe that drink-driving is an issue for industry and the
community as a whole.
''The Government's campaigns already receive strong support from the
media and from the Portman Group on behalf of the drinks industry.
''But we believe that there should be additional support from the
motor, transport, and insurance industries to widen the alliance against
drink-driving.''

TEENAGERS at an illicit drinks party threw a roll of discarded carpet
on their camp-fire -- unaware there was a corpse wrapped inside.
They watched in horror as the wool burned away to reveal the blazing
body underneath.
The youths, aged 14 to 17, battled to extinguish the fire they lit to
keep warm in a wasteland wood before fleeing in terror and calling the
police.
Last night, police hunting a suspected killer said the remains were so
badly charred they could not tell the unknown victim's sex, age, or
cause of death.
The victim appeared to be a small adult. A Home Office pathologist and
forensic experts were carrying out tests in a bid to give detectives a
clue to the person's identity. The youngsters, who have not been named,
were being offered counselling to help them come to terms with their
experience.
On Saturday night, the youths went to a copse known locally as the
Ditchy on the site of a former quarry at Carley Hill, Southwick,
Sunderland, Tyne and Wear.
Detective Chief Inspector Keith Atkinson, in charge of a team of 60
investigating the case, said: ''The fire had been going for up to 25
minutes before the youths realised there was a body on fire.
''We believe they became aware of what was inside when the carpet
burned away to show the body. They immediately tried to put the fire out
and then left to phone us.''
He said it was not clear why the youths failed to spot the body when
they lifted it from the ground near where they were sitting drinking.

A CELTIC board game has found new enthusiasts, 4500 years after it was
invented by a Druid.
Dun, pronounced ''doon' and known in legend as the ''game of life'',
has been resurrected by the Celtic association An Ceile De.
Retired academic Dr Tom McGregor spent eight years researching the
''Celtic chess'' and traced 2000 references to it in folk-tales.
Now the game, played by two players on a board carved with Celtic
engravings and with two ''armies'' of minature standing stones, is
taking off in his local pub. There is even a waiting list to join the
next tournament.
Dr McGregor explained: ''We believe that Dun is as close to the
original as it is possible to achieve, unless an archaeologist digs up a
set of rules.
''The level of enthusiasm and enjoyment of the game is far higher than
expected. We have taken out a patent on the game and would like to see
it produced commercially. About 50 hand-crafted sets have been sold and
there is clearly a market.''
An Ceile De wants to see the game go into mass production with profits
going to the creation of a centre to further Celtic studies.
Twenty-six regulars at the Kings' Arms pub in Perth are playing in the
current tournament and a further 14 have put their names down on the
waiting list.
Mr Ralph Bright, who produces the games, said: ''I think that part of
the game's appeal is that it is easy to learn and can be played at
different levels.''
Dun, a gaelic word for fortress, is a game of strategy. Players have
to win the best of three games and play is centred around the Ruler who
has to negotiate the trials of life and make it to a corner square to be
reincarnated.

SECURITY chiefs are preparing to clear Northern Ireland's streets of
anti-bomb control zones.
Parking bans which have been in force in Belfast, Londonderry, and
other towns for more than 20 years are to be lifted by the end of next
month.
Restrictions have been eased since the start of the IRA ceasefire, but
now the RUC is getting ready to remove all the warning signs by August
1, Government sources confirmed yesterday.
Civilian search teams in Belfast and most of the security gates in and
around the city centre are to go as well.
The control zones were introduced at the height of the IRA car bombing
campaign on streets in the early 1970s.
Owners of vehicles parked illegally faced maximum penalties of up to
#5000 and six months in jail. Scores of cars were blown up by the Army
without warning.
No final decision has yet been taken on scrapping no-parking zones
close to police and military stations.
Belfast Chamber of Trade's chief executive, Mr Frank Caddy, said
yesterday: ''The end of the control zones is undoubtedly another sign of
the steady return to normality and we are looking to see the remaining
vestiges of the troubles removed and, God willing, never to return.''
Troops are now off the streets completely and a battalion is about to
vacate a base on the peaceline between the Catholic Falls and Protestant
Shankill areas of Belfast. It is to be demolished.
However, a Government source stressed: ''We are not dropping our
guard. Anything being done can be reversed, and reversed very quickly.''
Meanwhile, Northern Ireland is set to become one of the top holiday
destinations in the UK.
The province could eventually rate with the Channel Islands and the
Lake District if the ceasefires hold, according to research by ARTAC
World Choice, the UK's largest consortium of independent travel agents.
Northern Ireland Tourist Board is expecting a 20% increase in
holidaymakers this year -- up to 1.5 million -- and is predicting a
million more each year by the turn of the century.
Hotel occupancy is at an all-time high, with the growth rate beating
England and Scotland, according to board officials.
Mr Colin Heal, chairman of ARTAC World Choice, said: ''There is no
doubt about the growing interest in Northern Ireland. The political
situation appears to be under control and a lot of people are quite keen
to visit.
''It's such a beautiful country with enormous tourist potential.
''Some of our members take the view that the potential growth in
popularity of Northern Ireland will be greater in the coming year than
places like the Channel Islands, provided the peace holds.''
Tourist chiefs believe that the province will need up to 18,000 new
accommodation beds to cope with the anticipated demand.
In a move to find extra rooms, home owners have been urged to consider
turning their houses into B&amp;Bs.
* Police have given the go-ahead for military bands to march through a
town centre for the first time in seven years.
The Band of the Coldstream Guards and the Light Division will parade
through the streets of Shrewsbury in Shropshire in August for the annual
flower show, the biggest outside Chelsea.
The marches date back to the first flower show of 1875 but were ended
in 1988 because of fears of a terrorist attack.
Now that the threat from the IRA has apparently gone, police believe
it is safe to resume the marching.
The Coldstream Guards will parade on the first day of the show, August
11, and the Light Division on August 12.
The flower show is costing #600,000 to stage and is expected to
attract a crowd of 100,000 over the two days.

<TEXT>
NET cord judges will wear goggles for the first time at Wimbledon
today to protect their eyes and temples from high-velocity serves.
The men and women who sit almost directly in the firing line will wear
wrap-around protective spectacles, similar to those worn by squash
players, to prevent injury from the balls that fly past their noses at
more than 130mph.
The move by the British Tennis Umpires Association, with the agreement
of the All England Club, came as fears increased that cannon-ball tennis
was making the game too boring.
Wimbledon authorities have already decreed that slightly slower balls,
with compression reduced by 2%, will be used in all matches this year.
Players, including Martina Navratilova, now believe that tennis has
become too tedious following the introduction of hi-tech equipment.
Hard-hitting servers such as American Andre Agassi, this year's
defending champion, have dominated the game in recent years, especially
on the fast grass surface at the All England Club, turning the game into
a rally-less power struggle.
Last year's final between Pete Sampras and giant Croatian Goran
Ivanisevic was viewed by many as the most boring yet.
The All England Club is keen to play down the introduction of the new
tennis balls and, on the evidence of the Stella Artois tournament at
Queens Club earlier this month, the change should not make a great deal
of difference.
Only when the weather was overcast and chilly did the new balls seem
to come off the racket more slowly.
By the end of the tournament, won by Sampras, the tennis was as high
velocity as ever in the June sunshine.
The weather forecast for Wimbledon, at least for the first week, is
good and Sampras is again the bookies' favourite.
Ladbrokes said yesterday it expected to handle more than #1m in bets
during the championships, while rival William Hill predicted #5m would
be gambled in total.
Sampras is odds-on favourite at 10/11 to clinch a hat-trick of men's
singles titles, while Steffi Graf is an even stronger contender at 1/2
to carry off the women's singles crown.
William Hill quoted Sampras at the same odds as Ladbroke and Steffi at
8/15.
A Ladbrokes ''speciality bet'' even offers 11/10 odds against a smile
from the intense Croatian, Goran Ivanisevic.

A ROW over claims of racist abuse in a West Lothian village has
prompted an English family to consider leaving after six months.
The Mullens, who moved to Bridgend from Nottingham, maintain they are
being hounded out by neighbours.
Villagers have presented a petition to West Lothian District Council
asking that the family be removed. The complaints against the family
centre around noise nuisance.
Mrs Barbara Mullen, 38, claims that she and her four children, Alison,
18, Charlotte, 15, Stuart, 11, and Danielle, nine, cannot walk down the
street without people suggesting that they go back home.
Mrs Mullen said that if her neighbours were desperate for her and her
family to go, they should have a whip round, adding that #1000 would be
enough for the family to resettle south of the Border.
She said she wanted her neighbours to leave her family alone. ''We've
had stones thrown at our windows and been pelted with water bombs. It's
not fair. We would gladly go back to England if we could.''
The family said anti-English taunts were particularly unfair as Mrs
Mullen's husband, Daniel, 54, originally came from the village.
Mr Mullen said he was brought up in Bridgend and had thought the
family would be welcomed back. ''It's not the original people of
Bridgend who are the cause of any problems. It's people who have moved
into the village since I left to join the Army.''

BILL Bryden, director of the loss-making First World War epic The Big
Picnic, has blamed local government reorganisation for Strathclyde
Regional Council's unwillingness to back his production of The Cherry
Orchard in The Shed, the former Harland and Wolff building in Govan.
Strathclyde sources have indicated, however, that its cultural
development sub-committee had ''no enthusiasm'' for giving approximately
#50,000 to Promenade Productions after having to pay a further #30,000
on top of its initial investment of #100,000 when The Big Picnic ran
into financial trouble last year.
Members also appeared to have doubts whether Chekhov's
twentieth-century classic, even if set in such an imposing venue as The
Shed, would attract the broad-based audience of Bryden's previous
Scottish-set works of The Big Picnic and The Ship.
Mr Bryden said he was quite happy to postpone until next year as he
would be directing Dennis Potter's work Son of Man with the Royal
Shakespeare Company this autumn.
''Strathclyde region was not the specific reason why we have
postponed. I am hoping that all the people behind The Big Picnic will be
back there again. We have got to give ourselves a little time for The
Shed to be roofed and made more comfortable. We want to do The Cherry
Orchard when everything is just right,'' he said.
The opening night of The Big Picnic had to be postponed twice because
Glasgow District Council officials found that it did not meet safety
standards. Subsequently, partly because of the cost to bring the Harland
and Wolff building up to fire and safety standards, Promenade owed
creditors a total of #400,000 and had to offer a number of contractors
and supporting cast a ''50p in the pound'' deal.
Both Strathclyde region and Glasgow District Council had to give
additional funding to bail out the company.
Glasgow District Council has since approved grants to turn The Shed
into a permanent theatre complex, but further funding is still needed.
Mr Bryden said: ''We have managed to put all that behind us. We are
not going to go into anything without being fully funded. They were
quite difficult times but we are through that now and all the better for
it.''
He said that around #500,000 had already gone into turning The Shed
into a performance theatre. ''I think that when it is finished its
uniqueness and the industrial cathedral feeling about it will make it
even more marvellous than it is just now.''
Mr Nicholas Newton, producer of Promenade Productions which put on
Bryden's previous two productions in The Shed, confirmed yesterday that
The Cherry Orchard had been put back from this autumn to next spring and
that he was pursuing lottery funding through the Scottish Arts Council,
and had also applied to the European Union and Glasgow Development
Agency for financial grants.
The company is also involved in talks with a major sponsor for the
production, but he said: ''I am confident that the money will fall into
place.''
A spokeswoman for Strathclyde Regional Council said the cultural
development sub-committee had continued consideration of Promenade's
application at its last meeting, but it had not been recommended by the
council's officers.
''Because of reorganisation, the cultural committee has allocated
pretty well all of its cash now. There is not going to be much more. The
structure is being dismantled. I couldn't say who by the autumn will be
around to run it and what the situation will be,'' she added.
She said that the council had limited money available for projects,
particularly for those of this size, and that the application had not
been submitted to the committee in the first round.
Sources within the council also suggested that the committee felt that
The Cherry Orchard was not the type of play to attract large audiences
to make it financially successful. In addition, other applicants were
seen as having managed their grants better in the past and were
therefore more deserving.
Mr Newton said: ''Obviously it is a disappointment not to be going
back into production this autumn. We will be using the year to
consolidate our position, get ourselves fully financed, present that and
other plays next year, and go forward with refurbishing the Harland and
Wolff shed.
''We need to be absolutely confident that we are fully funded and
secure on that funding so no problems for sponsors or contractors and
the company arise as we go into production.''
Mr Newton denied that potential backers might now be ''cautious'' in
the light of the financial problems that hit The Big Picnic last year.
''It is always important to recognise that funding shows can always
create problems for the producers, even if they are properly and fully
supported.''

THE four ''rebel'' Labour members of Monklands District Council
yesterday attacked its rejection of the main findings of the inquiry
carried out by Professor Robert Black QC.
Councillor Peter Sullivan, speaking on behalf of four councillors who
have criticised the way the council was run, said the decision at a
meeting on Friday to ask Professor Black for ''clarification'' on a
number of points and ''corrections'' was tantamount to procrastination.
The council had hoped the inquiry would disprove allegations made over
several years. However, the report found that a ''jobs for the boys''
policy had operated and that there had been a spending bias in favour of
Coatbridge and against Airdrie.
Councillor Sullivan said of the latest move: ''They are living in hope
that they can put it back further and further and that everyone will
forget about it.
''I am astounded that Councillor Jim Brooks (leader of the council)
and his colleagues have taken this course of action. It is cheeky to
say, after initiating the inquiry, that they now reject its findings.
''If the findings had gone the other way and had not vindicated us
(the rebel councillors), they would have been calling for our
resignations.''
Councillor Sullivan said the rebels had not attended Friday's special
council meeting to discuss the report because they believed the meeting
was ''premature, ill-considered, and merely a point-scoring exercise.''
He added that he expected a meeting of the Labour Party's National
Executive Council on Wednesday would extend the suspension of 15 Labour
councillors in Monklands to include those from the council who are also
on the new North Lanarkshire authority.
The entire ruling Labour group at Monklands was suspended by the party
last Tuesday, the day after the report was published.

THREE teenage girls spoke yesterday of their terrifying experience at
the weekend when their horses were caught in quicksand.
As two of the three horses got bogged down in the treacherous mudflats
of the Clyde estuary at Cardross, Dunbartonshire, rescuers fought a
desperate race against the incoming tide to save them.
Firemen, helped by members of Rhu inshore lifeboat crew, had to hold
up the head of one of the terrified animals as the water washed over it.
Emma Norval, 13, from Helensburgh; Melanie Ward, 14, from Cardross;
and Iona Cummings, 13, from Dumbarton, were riding on the beach on
Saturday evening when they decided to take their horses -- Mucsha,
Calypso, and Echo -- for a swim in the river to cool off.
However, after leaving the firm sand on the beach, the horses bolted
and galloped towards the water.
Emma, who was riding Mucsha, said: ''When we got to the water, Echo
and Calypso went right into the quicksand and Iona and Melanie fell off.
''My horse went down as well but I managed to get back up. But I knew
looking at the other two we would need to get help, so I galloped back
up the beach to get a phone.''
Melanie said: ''I fell with Calypso, and then Iona went down with
Echo. The two of them were just lying there, sunk in the mud. We were
all crying, because we knew the tide was coming in. We were really
scared we wouldn't get them out in time but then the firemen arrived and
we got Echo freed.
''But I really didn't think we would get Calypso out. The water was
coming over her head -- and I just couldn't watch any more. But then the
lifeboat arrived and, with everyone pulling, they finally managed to get
Calypso out.''
Fire station sub-officer Sam Earl said: ''It really is a dangerous
place out on the mudflats, as there are lots of bits with quicksand. At
times we were sinking in right up to our waists, so you can imagine what
like it was for the horses with their weight.
''I've been in the fire brigade for 25 years and have never come
across a situation like this, and it really ended up needing just brute
strength to get the horses dragged out -- and all the time we knew the
tide was coming in.
''We really thought we had lost the last one, as we had to hold its
head out of the water, and towards the end the groans coming from it
were terrible. We thought it was just giving up.
''We got a lot of help from the Rhu inshore lifeboat crew as well.''
Iona said: ''I thought we would never get Echo back out. We just
didn't know how dangerous the beach was. We certainly won't be going on
the sand again.
She added: ''All the firemen and the lifeboat crew were really
great.''

SOBA Up, 20-1 winner of the recent Edinburgh Gold Cup, returns to the
Musselburgh track this afternoon for the Moorfoot Hills Handicap in
which she will start a short-priced favourite.
Although carrying 5lb extra for last week's success and now racing
over a slightly shorter distance, Tim Etherington's five-year-old does
not have much to beat. The top weight, Denys Smith's Imperial Bid, is a
course-and-distance winner guaranteed to run well round Edinburgh's
tight bends and should be the biggest danger.
Linda Perratt's horses also are on their toes and Runrig, second to
Acquittal over this distance here a week ago, must have an outside
chance.
Leading Scottish athlete Yvonne Murray is honoured with a one mile
seven furlongs handicap in her honour. Local trainers' interests are
represented by Peter Monteith's Monkey Wench and Susan Bradburne's
Amnesia, but the one they will all fear is Vain Prince.
Nigel Tinkler's eight-year-old had Hit the Canvas, a winner at Ayr on
Saturday, in third place when he landed the Park Hotel Redcar Handicap
last month. Kildrummy Castle, third at that meeting when 11-4 favourite,
must also be considered.
Mark Johnston, who sported a tartan waistcoat at Royal Ascot when
welcoming his Ascot Gold Cup winner Double Trigger, sends four runners
from his Middleham yard.
Although all of his horses are running very well at present, those
with the best chance would appear to be Mary's Case, in the Linlithgow
Claiming Stakes, and Russian Heroine, in the Firth of Forth Handicap.
Milngavie has been off the course for eight weeks, while Everyone Can
Dream is racing for the first time in 83 days.

GAMBLING owner Hugh O'Donnell admitted he got it wrong when his wife
Marion's two horses, King Curan and Askern, finished first and second at
Ayr.
O'Donnell piled into Askern (3-1), who had won his last two races, but
it was King Curan, a 6-1 chance, who made every yard of the
mile-and-a-quarter to come home half a length to the good.
The Airdrie entrepreneur, said: ''I'm pleasantly surprised that King
Curan won. I had a saver on it, but I bet Askern to win.''
The O'Donnell's other horse, Persian Affair, was well beaten in a
previous race and the owner admitted: ''I'm well down on the day.''
If her husband was out of pocket, Marion was in the money, receiving
more than #4000 for first and second in the Sunday Express Best for
Sport Qualifier, which has its final at Goodwood's Sunday meeting in
August.
Jim Goldie's Keep Battling, runner-up to Soba Up in Monday's Edinburgh
Gold Cup, was sent off 7-4 favourite. Held up by Neil Varley for his
usual late challenge, he found the pace too hot and finished a well
beaten third.
Mrs O'Donnell, with eight winners from 37 runners, is Scotland's top
owner on the Flat, having earned #40,800, mainly through the efforts of
the consistent Mentalasanythin.
Another woman with cause to celebrate, although not present in person,
was Mary Reveley, whose Hit The Canvas (2-7) landed the Doonfoot Limited
Stakes over a mile and seven furlongs for her 1000th winner in a
sparkling career spanning 16 years.
Leith Academy is not a name or an institution much associated with
horseracing, but thanks to a former pupil, June Doyle, and her husband,
Kevin, that is about to change.
The Doyles named their two-year-old bay filly, purchased in Kentucky,
after her old school. Trained by Barry Hills at Lambourn and ridden by
Hills' son Michael, she was a comfortable winner of the Belleisle
Auction Maiden Stakes.
The Edinburgh couple, breeders and owners, had earlier won the
Longhill Maiden Fillies Stakes with Lucky Soph, completing a
short-priced double for Michael Hills and the connections.
Lindsay Charnock bounced several times on the turf when the saddle
slipped on Rossini Blue in the Roman Warrior Shield Maiden, won by Brett
Thomson on Khamseh.
Although he injured his left hand in the fall, Charnock came back to
win the Rothmans Royals North South Challenge Handicap on Hi Nod (15-2),
beating Tom Dyer's fast finishing Al Wujid by a length.
Linda Perratt was unlucky in the last when Tedburrow edged out Mister
Westsound by a short head.
* HANDICAP specialist Reg Akehurst could be double-handed in
Saturday's Northumberland Plate at Newcastle. The trainer, who landed
the Wokingham Stakes at Royal Ascot with Astrac, may run Latahaab and
Shadirwan in the two-mile event.
''Latahaab won well at Kempton last time,'' said Akehurst, ''and I
hope one of mine will be thereabouts on Saturday.''

THE REGIONAL electricity company reporting season gets under way in
earnest this week. Although the City will be looking closely at the size
of any dividend increases the shares are expected to be out of favour at
least in the short term amid the political uncertainty surrounding the
future of John Major.
In addition, the RECs are awaiting news next month from the industry
regulator Offer on price controls. City analysts expect that the RECs
will receive a modest tightening of prices with a price cut of about 5%
and in addition there is thought to be the possibility of a customer
rebate.
Eastern Group announces its 12-month figures today which are expected
to include exceptional charges of as much as #60m to cover retail
closures. Excluding these charges and tax, profits may climb to #257.1m
against #176.8m previously.
Similar retail provisions of #19m-#46m are expected to be made at
Midlands Electricity, which reports annual results tomorrow. Excluding
tax and exceptional charges profits are forecast to rise 13% to #220.4m.
Northern Electric reports its yearly figures on Wednesday which are
predicted to show a #21m increase in profits to #150m. The dividend is
forecast to rise by 33% to 33.1p.
The food retailing sector has been unsettled recently by the success
of Tesco's loyalty card. This has prompted Sainsbury to launch a major
marketing campaign aimed at winning back market share.
Asda, Britain's fourth biggest food retailer, prides itself on
offering young families good value merchandise, particularly in fresh
foods.
On Thursday, it is expected to report strong growth in underlying
sales of as much as 8% putting it at the top of the food retailing
league. Annual profits are forecast to be in the range #220m-#240m.
In the previous year, profits were depressed by exceptional charges
and the group made a loss of #126m. The dividend is expected to rise by
19% to 2.1p.
BPB Industries is expected to have made #157m in 1994 helped by 5%
higher volumes in the UK, good utilisation levels and higher prices.
Business in Germany and South Africa is also thought to have been good.
Within the paper and packaging business, margins are thought to have
improved helped by better pricing, lower costs and an increased capital
expenditure programme geared to capacity and improvement of paper
quality.

TETLEY, the tea bag company, is expected to move to a new home this
week with owners Allied Domecq selling the business to a mangement
buy-in team for about #190m.
The deal is being led by Leon Allen, chairman of Devro, and is being
financed by Prudential Venture Managers and Schroder Ventures, which
will hold around 60% and 40% of the equity respectively. The buy-in has
been organised and underwritten by UBS Phillips and Drew.
The total cost is expected to be closer to #250m including assumed
debt and stocks. Tetley, known for its round teabags, has annual sales
of around #450m and is thought to have made a profit of #23m last year.
It is the world's second largest tea producer. Various suitors had
been mentioned for the tea business including the Swiss food group
Nestle and the Tata conglomerate of India.
The disposal is the latest by Allied-Domecq which wants to focus on
its drinks business following the #739m merger of the two businesses in
March 1994.
In the past year, it has sold its food ingredients division, its
biscuit company and Lyons Cakes. Its European bakeries remain up for
sale.

RONNIE Scott's is a louche Soho jazz club not readily associated with
academia, the late-night pursuit of bohemianism always having been a
homework-challenging occupation. Nevertheless for the London showcase
debut of Edinburgh acid-jazzers Captain Shifty, the lair of the lounge
lizard was partly transformed last week into a school assembly hall on
open day.
The catalyst for this metamorphosis was the group's nascent record
company, Different Class Records, a unique outfit entirely staffed and
managed by students of Music Business Administration at Bathgate's West
Lothian College. This HNC course has long given youngsters hands-on
experience of the pop business, focusing on contracts and contacts while
down-playing the quixotic -- not to mention narcotic -- excesses more
commonly associated with certain sectors of the industry.
Fresh from a year of celebrity lectures from such doyens as
entrepreneur-producer Pete Waterman and A&amp;R chief and ex-Undertone
Feargal Sharkey, the students enlisted a phalanx of corporate sponsors
to underwrite last week's launch party.
Captain Shifty has a dressing-up-for-the-end-of-term-play look about
it which at first serves only to underscore the school-room ambience.
Typically eye-catching, the sax player and keyboardists sport
violently-clashing tartan trousers which go some way towards making up
for Ronnie Scott's paucity of psychedelic lighting.
Goatee beards and questionable garments to the fore, the funky
eight-piece is soon into its collective stride, however, and as soon as
the three-man horn section connects with shuffling drums and liquid bass
on Wonderland, it is clear that this is no school band.
For a relatively youthful combo the Shifties play with a confident
zeal that belies the nature of the invited audience. It is not a crowd
that many funky fusion outfits would choose.
Singer Nicola King's request for the assembly to ''put your hands
together'' met with a withering silence that was as much the result of
the event's lunchtime scheduling as perennially-blase London scepticism.
King remained coolly unphased and launched into the band's bluesy
Different Class single Whatever You Do, her Joplinesque voice
surprisingly issuing forth from an elfin frame.
The more meditative Winter utilised a langorous Isley Brothers feel,
with Gus Colvin's baritone sax much in evidence and King essaying some
suitably languid larynx-work. Here the band showed themselves capable of
a sinewy subtlety.
For Different Class, the lack of the latter might be a serious
challenge to Motown-style world domination. For Starsky-cardigan-wearing
fans of an authentic James Brown-style pulse, however, Captain Shifty
could be the JB's knees.
Perhaps if the venue hadn't been seated, the band's danceable charms
might have been more persuasive but even on last week's sedentary
evidence they proved themselves capable purveyors of suitably studious
soul.
The next step for the band, and the budding Bransons of the West
Lothian college, will be a stiffer examination. With a little revision,
it's still distinctly feasible that the Captain could graduate to
shifting plenty of units.

<TEXT>
WE have known for a couple of years that it was coming -- but here it
is. Five-day settlement for share deals -- the so-called T plus 5 --
starts today.
If you buy or sell shares from now on the rule is that you have to
settle up -- deliver cash or certificates -- five business days later.
Deal today, settle on Monday next week for instance.
It is a major change but it is all part of going paperless and moving
into the modern electronic world. The big institutional investors are
happy with the change, the big stock exchange firms of market makers and
institutional brokers are delighted with it.
The tightening up of the settlement timetable reduces the period
during which these firms, virtually all owned by big banks and doing
deals involving hundreds of thousands or even millions of pounds a time,
are at risk of something going wrong.
The small private client broker doing deals measured in hundreds or
thousands of pounds was happy enough with the old ''account'' system
where settlement could be three or four weeks after the deal was struck.
But the big ones worried. Also most other exchanges have speedy
settlement so London felt it needed to come into line.
There has been a soft run-up to the new system because we have been
trading with a T plus 10 deadline for the past year. Most investors seem
to have been able to cope with getting their cheques or certificates in
within 10 days but five will be a whole lot more testing.
A bright little booklet from the Stock Exchange explaining it all says
the change to 10-day settlement was ''welcomed by investors.'' Most do,
in fact, seem to have coped with the 10-day change although it had
worried a fair number ahead of the event. Latest statistics from the
Exchange show that 90% of private client deals were settled on time.
But meeting the new deadline means more than getting your cheque to
the broker on day five. What he needs is your cash in his hands by day
five. That is the day on which he has to transfer cash to pay for your
shares on your behalf.
So some have made arrangements for clients to be able to pay them by
Switch or Delta cards and a lot have been suggesting nominee accounts
for them to hold the shares you buy, or already own, plus deposit
accounts for cash. The cash would be invested in the money market to
earn interest on your behalf.
Very active investors may find this attractive as the broker will be
responsible for moving shares and cash in and out of your accounts --
acting on your instructions and notifying you what he has done each
time.
The strict theory of it is that if you fail to deliver cash or shares
on the due date you stand the risk of being charged interest until you
do complete the deal.
That could be a powerful argument in favour of signing up to join a
broker's nominee if you were not certain of being able to provide the
certificate on time, which really means parting with it as soon as you
have done the deal, and sending a cheque in time for it to be cleared by
day five when you buy.
Some brokers have set out the charges which they will make for holding
shares in nominee accounts. A fair number say they will make no charge
at all although a spokesman for a leading stockbrokers points out that
nominee accounts do cost money to run and have to be paid for.
For the time being, the good news is that it will not be compulsory to
meet the T plus 5 deadline. The rules do not insist on this yet.
Stock Exchange chairman John Kemp Welch told a recent conference of
the Association of Private Client Investment Managers and Stockbrokers
(APCIMS) that while the ''overwhelming majority'' of market participants
were confident of meeting the new deadline some of the smaller retail
brokers and their clients would have difficulty.
''Not all will be bale to meet T plus 5 and will need to continue
settlting at T plus 10,'' he said.
You do need to tell your broker from now on if you want to settle
other than on day five. For a while yet that should not cost you any
extra. Mr Kemp Welch told the APCIMS conference he was ''pleased that in
an attempt to ease the situation some of the leading market makers have
agreed to make the same prices whether settlement is taking place at T
plus 5 or T plus 10.''
Let's hope everyone is as helpful and understanding of problems when
the new CREST system of computerised settlement being organised by the
Bank of England comes into being around this time next year. The T plus
5 settlement system may become T plus 3 not long afterwards.

HOUSING consultants Chapman Hendy Associates have recently opened a
new office in central Glasgow at 29 Vincent Place. The independent group
provides specialist advice and assistance to a range of clients
including local authorities, housing associations, tenants groups and
financial institutions. It has other offices in London, Leeds and
Cardiff.
Chapman Hendy has had a base in Glasgow for a number of years but
decided to move to a more central location in order to better serve its
growing client list.
It has worked on a number of assignments for Scottish Homes, SFHA and
several new town development corporations. It is lead consultant to
Berwickshire Housing Association which is poised to accept the first
Large Scale Voluntary Stock Transfer from a Scottish local authority.
Richard Beal, director of Chapman Hendy Associates said: ''We've
always recognised that the social housing sector in Scotland is
significantly different to England and so we have had an office in
Scotland practically since the company was formed.''
He added that the new city centre office ''emphasises our commitment
to the Scottish housing scene''.

THE DISCOUNT on new shares issued by UK companies is up to four times
greater than that offered by US firms, says a report published today by
the Foundation for Manufacturing and Industry, (FMI).
The comparative study on the cost of raising capital, shows that the
average discount at which rights issues were made to existing
shareholders in the UK between 1990 and 1994, ranged from 9.5% in 1992
to 17.3% last year.
Average discounts in the United States for secondary offerings over
the same period ranged from 3.56% in 1991 to 3.86% last year.
The report was compiled by two professors from the Department of
Banking and Finance at London's City University. The researchers are not
clear why such an anomaly exits although they suggest that it may be
regarded as the price of certainty.
Under the UK system, companies know in advance of the issue what they
will raise. This is not the case in the US. Alternatively, the report
suggests that the difference may result from UK shares having to be
offered to a smaller group of investors -- those who already hold shares
in the company.
Whatever the reason, the professors suggest that both systems could
operate alongside each other on either side of the Atlantic. ''If you
were risk averse, you would want the UK system. But, if not, the
American system would seem to be preferable''.
In their research, UK underwriting costs, which total 2% of the amount
to be raised, were excluded. In the US, brokers' charges, which are for
a negotiable portion of an uncertain amount -- since the shares are not
priced in advance of the day of issue -- have also been set aside.
The researchers found that in the UK there was no obvious difference
according to size of company or sector in the UK. Nor was there any
relationship between the size of company and the cost of raising
capital. In the US, offers in excess of $500m (#312m) are less
discounted than smaller offers.
In conclusion, the report states that in every year and in every
sector mean discounts were lower in the US. The difference did tend to
close as company size fell.

PETER Savill is ''still hopeful'' that his Celtic Swing will run in
Sunday's Budweiser Irish Derby at The Curragh.
Firm ground could cause the owner to take his Prix du Jockey Club
winner back to France for the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud on the same day.
However, his racing manager, Nick Babington, said yesterday: ''Celtic
Swing is very well and we are hopeful of running in Ireland.
''Mr Savill has said he will run at The Curragh if it is good ground.
The alternative is Saint-Cloud but it is also quite firm in France.
''They are still watering at The Curragh. Mr Savill is in Ireland and a
decision will be made towards the end of the week.''
A spokesman for Irish course said: ''The going is good to firm but we
are watering. The forecast is for a continuation of dry, sunny weather
until Friday at least. I'd hope for good-to-firm ground for the Derby
with no jar -- we're aiming for safe ground.''
If allowed to take his chance on Sunday, Celtic Swing is set to face a
clash with Derby winner Lammtarra, making it the third time in the four
years that the winners of the Derby and the Prix du Jockey Club had
clashed at The Curragh.
In 1991 Generous beat the Chantilly winner, Suave Dancer, while Epsom
form came out on top again two years later when Commander in Chief saw
off French challenger Hernando.

NEWLANDS and Dunfermline emerged as the respective men's and women's
champions after yesterday's Scottish Inter-Club Cup finals, played in
scorching conditions at Newlands Tennis Club.
The hosts clinched their first cup victory since 1975 when they upset
the holders, David Lloyd Club, Renfrew, 5-2 while Dunfermline claimed a
record eighth successive title with a 5-1 win over surprise finalist
Cults.
Graham Reid, who played in the 1975 winning team as a 24-year-old,
guided 18-year-old Leon Smith to a crucial 6-2, 7-6 victory over the
opposite third pair, Sohail Shah and Derek Lauder, as Newlands took a
2-1 lead after the first round, but the outcome of the match was to
hinge on the clash between the top pairs in the second.
Newlands captain Malcolm Watt and Calum McKnight survived a 4-1
deficit in the final set tie-break against Donald Watt and Martin Kilday
and reeled off the next six points to clinch a 6-4, 4-6, 7-6 victory
with a stunning McKnight top spin lob.
A 6-2, 6-2 win for Ronnie Terras and Ian MacAulay over Shah and Lauder
cancelled out a 6-3, 6-3 victory for Lloyd's second string, Blane Dodds
and Jimmy Wood, over Reid and Smith to give Newlands a 4-2 advantage
before McKnight and Watt clinched the trophy when they dismissed Shah
and Lauder for the loss of one game in the only completed rubber of the
third round.
Dunfermline's victory was achieved in two rounds with Cults only
success coming in the first from a 6-2, 7-6 win for top pair Karen Ross
and Vicky Lakin over Jane Russell and Janet Henderson.
Sisters Alison and Fiona Reid won two matches for the loss of just
three games while Allison Wood and captain Judy Murray clinched the
winning rubber with a 6-2, 7-5 victory over Lakin and Ross. Results:
Women: Dunfermline 5, Cults 1 (Dunfermline players first ). First
round -- A Wood and J Murray beat G Archbold and A Christiansen 6-1,
6-1; A Reid and F Reid beat L Smith and C Smyllie 6-0, 6-1; J Russell
and J Henderson lost to V Lakin and K Ross 2-6, 6-7. Second round --
Murray and Wood beat Lakin and Ross 6-2, 7-5; Reid and Reid beat
Archibald and Christiansen 6-1, 6-1; Russell and Henderson beat Smith
and Smyllie 6-0, 6-0.
Men. Newlands 5, David Lloyd Club 2 (Newlands players first). First
round -- M Watt and C McKnight beat B Dodds and J Wood 6-3, 7-6; L Smith
and G Reid beat D Lauder and S Shah 6-2, 7-6; R Terras and I MacAulay
lost to D Watt and M Kilday 3-6, 2-6. Second round -- Watt and McKnight
beat Watt and Kilday 6-4, 4-6, 7-6; Terras and MacAulay beat Shah and
Lauder 6-2, 6-2; Smith and Reid lost to Dodds and Wood 3-6, 3-6. Third
round -- McKnight and Watt beat Shah and Lauder 6-0, 6-1.

THE north's second successive victory in the Grampian Cup was achieved
as much thanks to the south's inability to find the net as any great
sense of domination by the north.
Both north goals came against the run of play. Stewart Ferrier latched
on to a well taken free hit 20 yards out. His crisply-struck drive gave
goalkeeper George MacRae no chance.
Mark Stewart gave the north a comfortable cushion by rattling home the
second goal when he found himself completely unmarked.
The second half was virtually all south, but brilliant defence by
north captain Michael MacKintosh and Neil Robertson kept Garry
MacPherson and Scott Robertson at bay, and the more the game wore on,
the more apparent it was that the south were not going to score.
They even squandered a penalty chance in the seventy-first minute,
when MacPherson was up-ended in the box. His poorly hit attempt failed
to trouble Kevin Hunter.
The players who performed near miracles in the blazing sunshine and
fiery conditions now await the deliberations of Scotland's under-21 team
manager Burton Morrison. He will shortly announce a pool of players for
the challenge against Ireland in October.
Meanwhile, in Oban, 43 teams contested the national under-14
six-a-side championships which saw Lochnell Primary, from near Oban,
once again came out on top, winning their second competition in
successive weeks on penalties. They defeated Inverlochy 2-1.
At Inverness, the senior tournament was completed in more clear-cut
fashion with Glenurquhart winning the Jubilee shield, defeating Lovat B
3-1 in the final.

<TEXT>
SCOTLAND'S John Cleland extended his lead in the Auto Trader RAC
Touring Car Championship with a pair of dominant victories at Donington
Park yesterday.
The Vauxhall team leader led both 15-lap events from pole position to
chequered flag, and set the fastest lap in each into the bargain.
His Donington double-top extends his lead over Renault's Swiss driver,
Alain Menu, to 28 points as the championship heads towards its most
important race of the year, the British Grand Prix supporting event at
Silverstone on July 16.
Cleland made the first of the day's two races look easy. Starting from
pole position -- his first top qualifying slot for two years -- the Scot
beat off a brief first-lap challenge from the Honda Accord of David
Leslie to assume command of the race within seconds of the start,
trailed by his championship rival Rickard Rydell (Volvo).
Leslie, who had started from an impressive third place on the grid,
was beaten back into third place by the end of the opening lap, then
slipped to fifth behind Menu and Paul Radisich (Ford) a lap later.
Cleland, meanwhile, was easing into a lead he never looked in danger
of losing, with Rydell shadowing him all the way to the chequered flag.
Menu came under intense pressure in third place in the closing stages
from Cleland's Vauxhall team-mate James Thompson, who made a disastrous
start from second on the grid, slipping to seventh on lap one and being
forced into a dramatic fight to get back on terms with the leaders.
Thompson finished fourth, half-a-second adrift of Menu and just ahead
of Kiwi Radisich. Julian Bailey was sixth for Toyota, with Leslie
hanging on for seventh.
If anything, Cleland's second win of the day was even more impressive.
By mid-distance, he had eased out a three-second lead over Radisich,
who had started from third on the grid, and by the end of the 15 laps
the Scot was six seconds clear of the Kiwi.
Third -- and taking his third top-three placing of the year -- was
Radisich's Ford team-mate Kelvin Burt, who kept Menu at bay for the
duration.
Thompson beat Rydell to fifth place on the last lap, ahead of Bailey,
Will Hoy (whose Renault started seventeenth), and Leslie. Details:
First race -- 1, J Cleland (Britain) Vauxhall Cavalier, 25min
01.93sec, 89.88mph; 2, R Rydell (Sweden) Volvo 850, 2.67sec behind; 3, A

HOLLAND regained their standing as the leading European women's side
when they won the Nations Cup for the third time in four tournaments,
defeating Olympic champions Spain 4-1 on penalties after having drawn
2-2 in regulation time in Amsterdam last night.
Defending champions England failed to win a medal this time, losing
their third-place match to Germany by 1-0.
With Ernsting-Frienke unable to add to her tally of eight goals,
Scotland's Susan MacDonald took home the top scorer's award.The centre
forward found the target twice in Scotland's fifth/sixth place play-off
match against Russia, which finished 2-2 with the Russians going on to
win 6-5 on penalties.

BRIAN Lara and Lord's history combined menacingly to leave Mike
Atherton wearing a haunted look last night.
The little Caribbean master is in the mood to make a mockery of
England's 296-run victory target, judging by his flying start.
Lara, who strode majestically to 38 not out off only 44 balls, has all
of today -- if he needs it -- to supervise a success that would knock
the stuffing out of Atherton's team. And, from a home point of view, the
situation is alarmingly similar to that which confronted David Gower's
England 11 years ago.
Then, needing to score 342 in the fourth innings to win at Lord's,
West Indies stormed past the post with nine wickets and nearly 12 overs
of the final day to spare.
It was Gordon Greenidge's unbeaten 214 which destroyed England on that
occasion. This time, Lara poses the huge threat having guided his team
to 68-1 by close of play.
Whatever the result, the second Cornhill Test should go down in
history as a little cracker, having ebbed and flowed for four days.
But that will be no consolation to England if they lose -- and go two
down in this six-match series -- after fighting like tigers to avenge
their nine-wicket hammering at Headingley a fortnight ago.
Darren Gough gave his captain an early boost by having Carl Hooper
caught at wide mid-off via a sliced drive with only 15 runs on the
board. But that only let Lara loose.
The world record-breaking batsman soon crashed Gough high over point,
took three boundaries in quick succession off Angus Fraser and collected
his seventh boundary in all by despatching spinner Richard Illingworth
to the fence.
He has already dominated an unbroken stand of 53 with Sherwin Campbell
and the 228 runs still required by his side could come all too quickly
if Lara carries on where he left off.
Defeat would be so cruel on England. They have shown real character
here -- and their spirit was typified by Robin Smith and Graham Thorpe.
Smith, happily restored to the middle order after his twin first Test
failures, added a high-class 90 to Thursday's 61 while Thorpe --
hospitalised on Saturday by Courtney Walsh's 'beamer' -- returned to
make a brave 42.
Thorpe had little time to dwell on his earlier misadventure. He was
pressed back into service almost immediately this morning after Mark
Ramprakash's third-ball dismissal.
The talented youngster, who just cannot make a go of it at Test level,
completed a sad 'pair' by edging Ian Bishop to third slip.
At 155 for four, England were only 114 runs ahead. But with Smith and
Thorpe then adding 85 in calm and confident fashion, home hopes steadily
rose.
Thorpe's contribution was ended by Curtly Ambrose and Richie
Richardson, the latter throwing himself low and right to hold a fine
catch in the gully.
But Dominic Cork, who has made an encouraging debut, then joined Smith
in another half-century stand until pushing fatally at Bishop's widish
delivery to snick a simple chance to wicketkeeper Junior Murray.
Even at that stage there seemed no danger of the sudden collapse that
was to see England slip to 336 all out. But when Richardson took the new
ball eight overs after it was available, Ambrose clinically claimed
three for nought in 10 deliveries. Smith, having shone as brightly as
the day's sun for six hours in all, striking 11 fours, fell lbw on the
back foot; Gough was bowled for a breezy 20; and Peter Martin clipped a
catch to square leg.
When Walsh then trapped Illingworth lbw, England's final four wickets
had gone down for 16 -- and the door was invitingly open for Lara.

''THAT was a great result,'' proclaimed skipper Colin Mitchell after
Aberdeenshire had hammered Ayrshire, who came to Mannofield as leaders
of the Caledonian Counties championship.
On a day when not one of the leading four won, the table imploded. The
exception is poor Perthshire, beaten on the North Inch by Arbroath and
now truly detached.
Strathmore now lead Ayrshire by a whisker. Aberdeenshire lie third,
similarly ahead of Forfarshire.
''The boys knew this was round one,'' remarked Mitchell. ''We now go
to Forthill next week. A win there and the season opens out for us.''
Ayrshire found themselves inserted on a flat track and, in the face of
tidy bowling from Andy Bee and Willie Park, dismissed for 105. On his
county debut, young wicketkeeper Shianthan Shay held three catches and
had a stumping.
On the opening day of the season, Aberdeenshire dismissed Strathmore
for a low total and then found themselves skittled out.
''I was particularly pleased there was no repetition,'' pointed out
Mitchell. The star of the show was Mike Smith, who finished the game
with a 6 on to the adjoining house roofs.
West Lothian were another side needing to win. At home to Forfarshire,
Steve Crawley harvested 24 runs from Bryce Robertson's opening over.
West Lothian then slumped to 26 for two after five overs but were
rescued by David Fleming, who was last out for 78 of his side's 161
runs. Robertson recovered from his early mauling to bag five wickets.
Forfarshire lost openers Mike Cousin and Graham Garden in the eleventh
over and it was downhill to oblivion.
A second-wicket stand of 64 from Nigel Hazel and Mark Mudie for
Strathmore preceded a slump to 94 for four. However, 73 from Mark
Kelaher saw them to 220 for seven.
For once Ashok Malhotra played fourth fiddle in Fife's reply. The lead
was taken by Wayne Sullivan with a half century.
Light in bowling, Stirling County caught a batting track at the Arns.
Having dropped home professional Malcolm Howell early, they saw him
hammer an unbeaten 131 out of Clackmannan's 238 for five. When
Stirling's pro Kyle Wealleans was first out at 33, they were happy to
find a draw.
Arbroath introduced Mohamed Zaheed, whose left arm spin took three
wickets as Perthshire were all out for 101, and that total owed much to
31 late runs from Jack Ker.
Arbroath were far from relaxed at 50 for four, but Zaheed and George
Salmond steadied the ship.

WHEN the winning ticket was drawn in the post-match raffle at Raeburn
Place on Saturday, it was inevitably held by one of the Falkland party.
They were already celebrating their first win in the East League top
division and the prize of a bottle of champagne was just what the doctor
ordered. The cork was popped and their landmark achievement toasted in
style.
It wasn't just that they had beaten Edinburgh Academicals -- they had
also conquered something in themselves. ''This was a very important
result for the club,'' said bowler David Brown, ''because we have proved
to ourselves that we are capable of holding our own at this level.''
There was no fluke about their win. An all-round bowling effort,
spearheaded by Alan Hamilton with 4-29, restricted Accies to 186.
Falkland wobbled as four wickets fell before the hundred was up, but
then came a crisp match-winning stand of 89 in only an hour, with
handsome shots from unbeaten pair Cheany Pandya (68) and Stuart Lyndsay
(46).
It may have taken some of the gilt off the gingerbread when they
learned that at Union Park Corstorphine also had won, a magnificent
undefeated 135 by Shahid Saeed enabling them to overtake Stenhousemuir's
daunting 215, of which Graeme Gardner made 72.
Saeed narrowly shaded Gordon McGurk for batting honours, the Grange
opener hitting a dazzling 133 off 126 deliveries including a 6 and
fifteen 4s. His partnership with Alec Davies (40) realised 118 in 83
minutes as the Freuchie attack, badly missing Dave Cowan, was pasted all
around the paddock. The homesters declared at 258-6 after 48 overs.
Freuchie could hardly have made a less auspicious start, losing two
wickets in Graham Hurlbatt's first over and another in his third. Then
Ian Gavin dislocated his shoulder. But Russell Jones (62) and Blair
Forrester (31) dug in, allowing Freuchie to escape with a draw.
All-conquering Heriot's run continued at Watsonians' expense despite a
fine 91 from Mike Leonard. Shahid Aslam took eight of the home wickets
and then supported Jim Love (68 not out) with 47.
But Carlton are still on their tail after an excellent eight-wickets
victory at Barnton, where Royal High's Manzoor Elahi scored 128. He was
outgunned by opposite number Robin Singh, who had five wickets and an
unbeaten 77, while Bryn Lockie chipped in with yet another half-century.

WHILE Clydesdale may be used to winning, it was a whole new experience
for Uddingston on Saturday. Halfway into the season, neither they nor
opponents Kilmarnock NK had managed a victory this term.
At the weekend, however, Uddingston broke that duck with a win earned
thanks to some of the unsung heroes at Bothwell Castle Polocies.
The home side batted first, and rattled up 206 for six from their 50
overs.
Graham Robertson was promoted from the middle order to face the new
ball and took full advantage of his status. He knocked up 83, and with
John Donnelly and Colin Cruikshank chipping in, Uddy always were in with
a chance of that illusive maiden win.
Enough of the Killie batsmen got started to keep the result in doubt.
Asif Mujtaba hit 53, Zubadhir Dadaboy made 48, and Muzamil Malik 32, but
the supporting acts failed to contribute.
George Reifer, having failed with bat, picked up four wickets for 30
runs, and Donnelly recorded three for 36, although it was left to John
Crichton to snap up the last Kilmarnock wicket to start the
celebrations.
Nine games from now, Clydesdale, too, could be cracking open a few
bottles.Defeat at Hamilton Crescent last week seems to have been no more
than a hiccup in their chase for the title.
The side that collected that prize twelve months ago, Ayr, found that
out on Saturday.
Bruce Patterson and Albert Simpson both made 40-odd, but Aamir Hanif
kept the dressing-room door swinging with six for 61.
The holders made 178 for nine, but rumours that circulated other Union
venues that Clydesdale were struggling with the task before them proved
wildly inaccurate.
Not for the first time, Aamir settled down to play his shots and make
runs.By the ninety-second over, the championship leaders had wrapped up
another win, seven wickets the margin, with Aamir having clocked up an
undefeated 116.
Drumpellier's advance, meanwhile, was halted by Greenock at Langloan.
While his countrymen were coming second best to South Africa in the
Rugby World Cup final, Kiwi Mike Sears made Drumps suffer.
On a lively strip, Sears removed Zulphaqar Shahid and Scott Dempsie in
the first over, finishing with six for 22, ably backed up by Peter
Duthie, who took four for 37.
Although it took 36 overs, Drumpellier were all out for just 86, a
target which was easily surpassed by Greenock for the loss of just four
wickets.
West of Scotland beat a Ferguslie side who seem intent on doing things
the hard way.
Having been inserted after losing the toss, Ferguslie made a good
start, reaching 50 in no time.On 59, they lost skipper Iain Kennedy,
then, on 88, Dougie Arnott went.But from then, Ferguslie went mad.
Mark Gilchrist took three for 21, but he was fortunate, to say the
least, as no fewer than four of Ferguslie's last five batsmen managed to
run themselves out.
To win, West were set 165 off 46 overs, and achieved that with four
overs to spare.
Alastair Storie and Mark Harper added 74 for the first wicket. Harper
went on to make an unbeaten 84 with Alan Williamson ending the contest
with a 6 off Justin Gayfer.
Dougie Wylie top-scored with 61 as Kelburne made 163 for seven against
Poloc.And that proved a winning tally, with the Paisley side knocking
the visitors over for 113.
Roger Telemachus removed Said Ali, one of three wickets for the South
African pro, but it was Gregor Maiden with four for 23 who did the real
damage.

DRUMPELLIER'S undefeated run in Section 3 of the Whyte and Mackay
Scottish Cup ground to a halt at home against Kelso.
The Borderers' hero was Craig Friebe, who top scored and picked up
five wickets. Friebe's stand of 109 for the second wicket with Dougie
Wilson was the foundation of Kelso's 242 for nine.
Drumpellier's lost opener Alan Henderson in the third over and they
were 73 for six after 23 overs. Steve Allison, who had dropped Friebe
before he was in double figures, put on 49 for the seventh wicket with
Alan Campbell and then saw the score mounting as he shared with Stevie
Carr a final-wicket partnership which had reached 50 when he was bowled
with eight overs left -- by Friebe!
Ayr took a big step towards winning Section 3 when they easily won the
shoot-out with equally unbeaten Carlton. Chasing Ayr's 198 for eight,
Carlton opening batsman Hugh Parker ran himself out.
Ayr's attack of Andy Baird and Adrian Holdstock then had Carlton on
toast. With Iain Masterton picking up four scalps behind the wicket,
Carlton nosedived to 49 for eight.
Section 2 also came closer to a decision with undefeated West of
Scotland's victory separating them from Strathmore.
Craig Wright pulled round West's batting, coming in a 61 for three and
stroking an unbeaten half-century to set Strathmore a target of 190.
The Forfar side soon found themselves on 47 for six. Wright ended with
three wickets as Strathmore expired on 100.
Poloc moved ahead of Ferguslie in Section 1 with a 31-run home win.
They reached 242 for five thanks to a second-wicket stand off 133
between David James and Sajid Ali. The former was run out for 37, but
Ali went on to hammer 94 off 89 deliveries.
In the face of tight bowling from the home spinners, Ferguslie had
reached just 67 for three at midway. Only Ian Kennedy (67) made notable
runs and as Ferguslie tried to raise the run rate they lost wickets,
dismissed for 201 with three overs left.
In highlights of other games, Freuchie v GHK produced three centuries.
Those by Scott Gourlay and Robbie Birrell was the story of Freuchie's
260 for two. GHK opened with pro Zaheed Ahmed, who powered them to
victory with a magnificent 163 not out.
Aberdeenshire kept their hopes alive in Section 4 with a seven-wicket
home win over Inverurie. A feature of their 180 for three was the
contribution of extras -- 47.

A SIX-YEAR-OLD girl who underwent four liver transplants has died.
Tamara Rainey, of Graymount Terrace, north Belfast, had a rare liver
condition, biliary atresia, and was under intensive care for most of her
life.
She had her first operation when eight months old and her second liver
transplant at Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, in February 1991. Her
fourth transplant was last January.
Her Belgian-born mother, Marina, was not at home yesterday.
Even though the child had been desperately ill, neighbours said they
were shocked by her death.
The principal of nearby Cedar Lodge Primary School, Ms Zoe Vallely,
said: ''She was a tremendously courageous and plucky little girl.
''I know her teacher and classmates are very saddened, and our hearts
go out to her family.''

<TEXT>
ITV chiefs meet today to discuss advertisers' worries about increased
costs and falling audiences -- but the issue of changing the time of the
flagship News at Ten bulletin is unlikely to be on the agenda.
Reports that the ITV Council is to talk about moving the main evening
news programme -- or even scrapping it -- were dismissed by an ITN
spokeswoman yesterday.
She said that, under the terms of the Broadcasting Act, ITV was
obliged to screen a news programme during prime viewing hours. No-one
from ITV network centre was available for comment.
Some ITV companies would like to move News at Ten to another slot so
that blockbuster films could be screened without a 30-minute break.
However, the ITV Council is likely to be re-thinking parts of the
schedule and considering ideas to ease the concerns of major advertisers
who feel they are paying more for less.
''Advertisers have complained that costs have risen and there was a
slight drop in ratings during May, so we want the autumn schedule to be
strong,'' said a spokesman.
A possible solution has been put forward by the advertising buying
agency, CIA Medianetwork, which represents Wrigley, Weetabix, Fuji, and
Microsoft.
It suggests legislation so that ITV and Channel 4 can spend more on
programmes and end the rebate scheme which meant C4 had to pay ITV #57m
last year.

<HEADLINE>Reported deal frees Michael from long-disputed contract</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>977698965</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
POP star George Michael is said to have agreed a deal to end his
long-running dispute with music company Sony, allowing him to release
his first record for five years.
The 32-year-old singer is set to sign a multi-million contract with
Virgin and Dreamworks SKG, the new entertainment group set up by film
director Steven Spielberg, according to a report in the Sunday Times.
The star is reported to be already preparing his debut for the new
company -- a set of recordings he has been working on in secret in Los
Angeles.
As the lead singer of Wham! and as a solo performer, Michael became
one of the world's top-selling pop stars. However, in 1990, he declared
he would never release another record for Sony because it was treating
him as a product rather than an artist.
After failing in the High Court to break his contract last year, he
has been courted by all the world's major record companies. The new deal
was drawn up by American music mogul David Geffen, a partner of
Spielberg's in Dreamworks SKG, and Ken Berry, head of Virgin Music.
The companies, it is reported, will pay Sony #10m to ''buy'' the star.
It is thought Sony wants a royalty of 2%-3% on all future sales of
Michael's records as part of the terms.
Final negotiations are reported to be still taking place but Michael
is said to have agreed in principle to a split deal that would see his
records sold by Dreamworks in the US and by Virgin in the rest of the
world.
Following Michael's pledge to stop recording for Sony, the Japanese
giant agreed to accept offers for his six-record contract.
The row reached a peak when, in October, 1992, the singer took Sony to
court after two years of wrangles. The 75-day legal battle cost Michael
#3m, ending in defeat at the High Court when his contract was declared
valid.
Michael's threat, following his High Court defeat, to take the case to
the European Court is understood to have played a key role in Sony's
climbdown.

<HEADLINE>Watchdog censures 'suicide pact' ad</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>5</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977698966</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A SATELLITE TV advertisement which appeared to show two teenagers
dying in a ''suicide pact'' has been condemned by the Independent
Television Commission (ITC).
The watchdog ruled yesterday that the Pepe jeans commercial on music
channel MTV was ''not acceptable''.
It showed a young boy arguing with his father then drive to a building
site with two girls.
One girl kissed her two friends before leaving them in the car holding
hands. She then hooked the car to a crane, and viewers saw it being
hoisted high and dropped.
Just one viewer complained -- but the ITC said that was probably
because the commercial was only shown on MTV.
Officials from MTV told the ITC it had ''not occurred to them'' that
the scene might be interpreted as a suicide pact.
Advertising agency Leagas Delany also said any implication of a double
suicide was unintended.
However, it was ruled that: ''The ITC could not agree it was
acceptable for television advertising, particularly that targeted at
young people, to condone (and even appear to celebrate) destructive and,
on one interpretation, self-destructive behaviour of the kind shown in
this commercial.''
The ITC also upheld complaints from 26 viewers over a Croft Original
Sherry advert which was said to have made ''insensitive'' references to
bereavement.
It featured a woman saying funerals provided good opportunities to
drink sherry. It then became apparent that she was mourning the death of
a freshly caught fish.
Richard Branson's Virgin Radio station was cleared of ''ridiculing''
fat people in its TV commercials.
Forty-five viewers complained about advertisements which showed an
overweight American disc-jockey dancing and ended with the line --
''listen now or next time he's naked''.
But the ITC dismissed the complaints, saying the campaign was
light-hearted.
It also dismissed complaints about a TV commercial featuring
Manchester United soccer star Eric Cantona.
Eighteen viewers objected to sports firm Nike's advertisement which
showed the Frenchman and black England striker Les Ferdinand condemning
racial hatred and violence in sport.
It was shown shortly after Cantona had been convicted over his kung-fu
style attack on a Crystal Palace fan.
Complainers claimed the advertisement was an attempt to glorify and
exploit Cantona's infamy and labelled it ''insensitive and
inappropriate''.
But the ITC dismissed the complaints, saying the commercial was part
of a ''Kick racism out of football campaign'' which had received
positive reactions from the soccer authorities and supporters.
Meanwhile, the Video Standards Council (VSC) is considering whether to
allow posters for a soccer video-game which have also come under fire
for allegedly glorifying Cantona's assault on a fan.
Posters for Fever Pitch Soccer show a caricature of Cantona aiming a
flying kick at a shaven-headed lout.
The VSC says it will examine the posters, and may ask the Advertising
Standards Authority to investigate.

When thrown in with big-hitters . . . the English would really need
Norman Bates on their side rather than poor little Jeremy and co.
QUICKLY, clasp your hands together and offer up prayers to the
Wimbledon gods.
Promise not to misbehave in the miles-long queues outside the grounds
of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club or make fun of the
retired military types who parade up and down jabbing with their
brollies those who break ranks.
Oh yes, and do swear you will not try to start a Mexican Wave on
Centre Court.
Indeed, do whatever you feel will sway the powers that be to look
after and deliver safely unto Wimbledon the five-times champion Steffi
Graf. Her presence will be absolutely essential.
Graf, who has just won the French Open championship despite a bad
back, went home to Bruhl towards the end of last week saying she needed
treatment to a wrist injury. She has returned and says she is fit enough
to attempt to collect her sixth Wimbledon championship.
''Don't worry,'' she said, ''I've tried the wrist and I'll be there.''
Don't worry? We have to, Steffi. You are just about all we've got, so
do be careful.
Graf may believe she has a point to prove after last year, when she
became the first defending women's champion in 32 years to be beaten in
the first round.
That humiliation, engineered by Lori McNeil, pained deeply, and
despite her back problem, which will not be cured until she agrees to
surgery to remove a bone spur from her spine, her triumph at Roland
Garros suggests she has forced herself back into a groove. Just as well,
too.
With Her Majesty, Martina Navratilova, a wonderful memory and the
baseline slugger in little girl's clothes, Monica Seles, still trying to
free herself from a mire of self-doubt and fear, competition and flair
has ebbed from women's tennis.
In fact, it is a measure of how desperately short of characters are we
that Seles has been persuaded to emerge from the isolation into which
she retreated two years ago when she was stabbed in the back by an
unhinged Graf fan.
The former world's No.1-ranked player will meet Navratilova in
Atlantic City on July 29 when, with a typically healthy smattering of
American hype, their exhibition contest will be billed as ''The Return
of The Champions.''
The significant and disturbing aspect of Seles' return to court is
that the public are already excited by the prospect, and if Graf were to
make another early exit from the championships, or if her wrist or back
does not hold out, the women's singles would be devoid of, well, women
really.
Mainly children would be left and one of them, 14-year-old Martina
Hingis, will play Graf in the first round.
Hingis, a Swiss prodigy named after Navratilova, has risen already to
No.19 in the rankings and, while the Graf frown might be slightly more
severe than normal, the latest little escapee from the creche is
relishing the prospect.
''If I have to play Steffi then I'd rather do it in the first round,''
she said. ''Besides, I love playing at Wimbledon.''
She does, too. Hingis is the current Wimbledon and also French Open
junior champion and is capable of damaging veterans like Graf who,
having just turned 26, must sometimes feel like an intruder among all
the spindly waifs.
Graf has come through 12 difficult months, during which she had to
cope with persistent rumours that her career was over because of her
back injury.
She lost to Arantxa Sanchez Vicario at the US Open and also her world
No.1 ranking, but the French tournament proved she is still capable of
playing a mean game.
''I discovered that not only could I still play well, but that I could
also win again and there is no better feeling,'' she said. She is
beginning to sound like a champion again, and Hingis should use her time
in the presence of Graf to learn.
Defending champion Conchita Martinez, who has had to settle for a No.3
seeding, is in the opposite half of the draw to Graf, but she has
fifth-seeded Mary Pierce in her section and the American-based
Frenchwoman could be troublesome. Pierce is very much an unknown
quantity because, until now, she has preferred to shun Wimbledon.
Last year, she pulled out of the tournament only 48 hours before she
was due to hit a ball, adding to the belief that her style, while
effective and potent on slower courts, is simply not compatible with
grass. However, she insists that she will cope.
''The surface is a rare one for me, but my game is one which I can
enjoy on any surface,'' she said during a break from preparing for her
first-round match against Austrian Sandra Dopfer. ''I've just got to
practise a lot and and treat the surface like a hard court with a few
dodgy bounces.''
Jana Novotna, who will forever be remembered for having dried her
tears on the shoulder of the Duchess of Kent after having lost to Graf
in the '93 final, is one of the few genuine fast-court specialists
around in today's game, and she will be anxious to have another
opportunity play again in a Wimbledon final.
Provided she keeps a fragile temperament under control, she must have
a chance, although if the Duchess sees the Czech girl strolling on to
Centre Court two weeks today for women's finals day she might want to
rush back to the royal pad for the plastic mac, just in case. She'll cry
you a river, Jana will, when things don't go her way.
Hangdog Pete is likely to dominate the men's section and Sampras is
fresh from a win at Queen's Club. He is feeling good, although you would
never know it by looking at the way he skulks around court studying his
racket strings and rarely looking up.
Nevertheless, he'll have knocked the fur off a few balls before this
fortnight is over and could bludgeon his way to a third successive
Wimbledon championship.
In the final of the Stella Artois last weekend there was only one
10-shot rally and that match, against Guy Forget, was indicative of the
way Sampras will behave over the next couple of weeks.
Boris Becker, who became the youngest winner of the men's singles
crown and the first unseeded player to go all the way when, as an
awesome 17-year-old, he beat Kevin Curren in 1985, can be relied on to
add a splash of colour and excitement to the green backdrops. He is
scheduled to meet top seed Andre Agassi in the semi-final and that would
be decent tussle.
However, Agassi, who became champion three years ago, has a difficult
path with Andrei Medvedev and either Michael Stich, another former
champion, or Wayne Ferreira lurking in wait.
There is no doubt that of the top two seeds Agassi has the most
difficult draw and Sampras, seeded No.2, would have been even more
relieved to hear of the withdrawal of Sergi Bruguera, who might have
been a threat to the American's progress.
And, finally, what of the Brits? Will they give the patriots who flock
to Wimbledon something to smile about this year?
Unlikely, although someone like terribly English Jeremy Bates or Mark
Petchey might do their duty and win a couple of roller-coaster matches
before the nerve and stamina give out.
You know, when thrown in with big hitters like Sampras, Goran
Ivanisevic, Stich, and Becker, the English would really need Norman
Bates on their side rather than poor little Jeremy and co.
You never know, however, and Scotland might be given something to
shout about if Ross Matheson and Miles MacLagan, who play David Wheaton
and Renso Furlan on Courts 4 and 3 respectively today, can come up with
big games.
However, it might not be pleasant viewing for the ladies and gentlemen
who flock through the gates. Most likely they will be reduced to
squirming in their good frocks and suits as the chaps are given what for
by Johnny Foreigner.
Too late now, though. The blood-letting is about to begin.

THIS afternoon a group of young hopefuls, some beset with nerves and
others full of expectation, will step out on to the hallowed courts at
Wimbledon in a bid to make their dreams come true. But last week, almost
unnoticed, a new chapter opened in a familiar fairytale . . .
ONCE upon a time, in a land far away, a young prince was born.
His mother, Queen Gloria, doted upon her handsome son, as did the
Queen Mother, and they hatched all kinds of plans to help the boy endure
the trials and tribulations of life.
They were determined to instil self-belief and motivation in the
innocent prince so that no ogres would scare their precious boy.
Sometimes, the prince was bowed down by the pressures but the Queen
kept her temper. No locking her boy away in an attic. But when the
prince was bad he was very, very bad and when he was good he was playing
tennis.
The Queen seized on this and decided to move the court to the west
where she found two new mentors for the prodigy. The two good fairies
were called The Two Panchos.
Under their good influence, the young prince's tennis improved
dramatically and they decided to display his talent where all could
marvel at his never-say-die attitude, his stunning service returns, and
his magical passing shots.
But there were hobgoblins at work. The prince didn't like this, he
didn't like that, and he couldn't agree with anyone at all. He fell out
of favour -- but he carried on winning.
He set out to conquer the world and his first victory in a Grand Slam
event came in 1973 when he teamed up with the The Dark Prince, Ilie, and
they beat all-comers in the men's doubles at Wimbledon.
The following year he was back in Britain with his doubled-handed
sword and reached the final of the singles.
This time, he was up against an older prince from a land even further
away. The older prince was much more popular with the serfs than the
21-year-old. But, on the day, his armour was not strong enough to
withstand the heavier range of weapons produced by the young pretender,
who huffed and puffed till he blew the people's champion away (6-1, 6-1,
6-4).
His victory was particularly sweet for our hero because by this time
he had met a sweet natured, fair-haired princess from his own land and
she, too, had been victorious at the British court.
The regal pair planned a grand wedding, but the course of true love
doesn't always run smooth.
The prince carried on winning but his aggressive, street-fighter style
did little to endear him to the public although there were a host of
young female acolytes.
In 1977, he failed to appear in a Parade of Champions and boos echoed
round Centre Court for his first-round match. Things had reached an
all-time low and some were nicknaming him the Prince of Woes.
At the same time a new star had emerged from a cold land far to the
north.
The Ice King's steely determination was chilling and he slew all who
stood in his path. The prince stomped off in a tantrum in 1979 after his
semi-final defeat by the Ice King. He vowed vengeance.
By this time he had found a new princess, who had different talents to
his. The fact that she had displayed her charms in Playboy did little to
endear her to Queen Gloria. But the prince married her and she bore him
a son and a daughter.
Eventually, in 1982, he emerged triumphant at Wimbledon again with a
victory over an even more volatile pretender, John of New York.
The prince could be found staring at a wall, saying:
''Mirror, mirror on the wall,
Now, I'm the very best of all.''
And, indeed, he was. For, to this day, he holds the record for
tournament wins, at 109, and was the world's No.1 for 263 weeks.
Then, last week, the prince, now 42, re-emerged in Germany and reached
his first quarter-final in four years. But he came up against a giant
from a land of high mountains and was defeated 7-6, 6-3.
But again the proles rose up as one in support. They gave him a
standing ovation and when he left court it was more like a victory march
than someone leaving in defeat.
The only dissenting voice was from grumpy Baron von Stich, who said it
was good that he had lost so that the younger ones could have a chance.
The public have already tired of the robotic youngsters with their
crashing serves and their po-faced tennis. Having forgotten his
less-endearing traits, they are pleased to welcome the prince back among
them.
For sheer entertainment value alone, Jimmy Connors deserves to live
happily ever after.

<HEADLINE>Union leader condemns breakaway by nurses</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE launch of a ''breakaway'' nursing body in Scotland was condemned
by a union leader last night.
Mr Jim Devine, Scottish regional officer for Unison, dismissed the
Independent Federation of Nursing -- which is to be launched publicly
tomorrow.
Mr Devine said: ''This seems to be coming from the Norman Lamont wing
of the RCN.
''None of our activists are identified with it. We had a meeting of
160 shop stewards from Glasgow and nobody even mentioned this.''
Unison represents around 35,000 nurses in Scotland. Those involved in
the breakaway move are said to have been unhappy with the RCN's plans to
end its no-strike pledge and to feel that the main nursing unions, the
RCN and Unison, are too large and London-orientated.
Mr Devine said the health service had a history of similar groups
springing up during disputes but, every time, they quickly ''faded
away''.
''I think it is very sad, because at a time like this the last thing
we need is splits,'' he said.
''Obviously we are not complacent but our recruitment and retention of
members is increasing and our recruitment figures are up 20% in the last
few months, the bulk of it from nurses, because we articulate their
concerns.''
Weekend reports said the new union would be headed by a former
Scottish area officer with the RCN.
Supporters said they felt the RCN had become too ''unionised'', and
criticised last month's conference decision to end the traditional ban
on industrial action.

TEMPERATURES in Scotland soared into the 80s this weekend. The weather
centre predicts that the hot, dry spell could last until next Friday.
''It is looking very settled and we don't expect much change until
then,'' a spokesman said. Tulloch Bridge, north of Fort William, became
the hottest place in Scotland, recording 29C, 84F.
One youth drowned when swimming in the River Strontian in Lochaber.
Allan Smith, 16, of Dal na Each, Strontian, had taken a dip on Saturday
in a bathing spot known as The Rock Pool. Friends were unable to reach
him before he drowned.
An Englishman had a narrow escape while taking part in a sponsored
hang-gliding event on Ben Nevis. Joiner Austin Haines, 37, of Portslade,
Sussex, crashed into the North Face and fell 40ft. He was flown to
Belford Hospital, Fort William, and treated for minor injuries.
Hospitals, particularly in the west of Scotland, were inundated with
people suffering from heatstroke and sunburn.
Scots are more likely to get sunburnt at home than on holiday abroad,
Government research confirms today. June is the most likely month for
Britons to get burnt, with 32% of recorded cases according to the report
commissioned by the Department of Health.
It dispels the myth that a Spanish Costa or a Greek island poses a
more serious health risk than the back garden. The report, published in
the Journal of Public Health Medicine, is part of the Government's
Health of the Nation strategy which aims to stop the annual increase in
skin cancer cases.
It reveals that around 54% of recorded cases happened at home in
Britain. Men, who are less inclined to seek a tan, were more likely to
have been burnt in the past year than woman -- 39% compared with 34%.
Dr Andrew Bulman, co-author of the report, said: ''Our research
clearly links the desire for a tan with a doubling of the risk of
burning in the sun. The idea that everyone looks better with a tan is
damaging many people -- particularly the 12% whose skin does not tan.
Ms Katie Aston, of the Health Education Authority's skin cancer
campaign, said: ''People often think that the sun in the UK somehow
doesn't count, yet this research shows that more than half the sunburn
happens at home rather than abroad.''
She said people were more aware of safety in the sun but added: ''The
challenge is to get them to put this into action, to do something about
it.''
Researchers interviewed 2025 adults for the Office of Population
Censuses and Surveys Omnibus survey in England, Scotland, and Wales.
Meanwhile, in Madrid, a torrential rainstorm left residents of the
normally bone-dry Spanish capital pumping water from their basements
yesterday. Nearly 100 vehicles were swamped when the Manzanares River
poured over its banks on to a four-lane highway.
The overnight torrent and accompanying wind and hailstorm set off
almost immediate flash flooding throughout the city centre, flooding at
least one subway station and inundating the city's rescue and emergency
services. The deluge turned the 107,000-seat Santiago Bernabeu stadium
into a shallow pond in barely 30 minutes, forcing the unprecedented
suspension of the Spanish King's Cup soccer match with 11 minutes
remaining in the game.

FIRHILL on Friday saw youth football in the first annual 11-a-side
football tournament for fourth to sixth-year schools. Boys and girls
played, and it was grand.
Last week I spoke of the skills which are yet there in football at the
early levels. Now we are seeing the responses to that need.
One of them actually is women's football. And certainly girls, for the
women's game can only develop with major responses from the clubs at
juvenile level.
For children's football to stay the dead hand of Scottish footy
paternalism we have to look towards the idea of football as a game and
sport and art and entertainment which goes over the heads of gender.
Indeed, if it comes to that, class, discrimination.
The days of rugby schools and soccer schools have got to be over.
When I wrote last week that the skills were still there among the
youngsters, I was not speaking only of working-class kids, their dreams
tied to their buttoned-up boots or wee dirty boys from the Gorbals or
Toonheid with cowlicks.
If we want to get football the way it is meant to be played we have to
think beyond such stereotypes. Posh boys in Hutchie blazers could end
up, if we coach properly, as the Johann Cruyffs of the future. More is
to come, if we get it right.
I was there on an unbelievably sunny day out at Cumnock. There were
eight small pitches in perfect condition for the fourth year of the
Kingsmead, Cumnock and Doon Valley East Ayrshire Soccer Sevens
Tournament.
On Saturday, the finals of the under-11s, there were 37 teams, each of
nine players, of which seven would be playing at any one time. As always
seems to occur, the home team, Kingsmead, beat Glasgow's Mearns on
Saturday by penalties after a nil-nil draw.
The Kingsmead is a prestige tournament, but tournament it is and we
have perhaps another question to be asked here.
Scandinavian countries and some Continental football associations --
notably Holland I may say -- do not approve of competition. They think
it leads to the kind of professional venality which has encouraged the
paucity of footballing ability and art which is, indeed, exemplified by,
say, Scottish football. They want their youngsters to grow up talented,
but not absurd. Scottish children's football is well aware of that, and
so were the organisers of this Ayrshire jamboree.
Bill Alexander, manager of the Kingsmead under-13s, expressed his own
concern, as are so many of us who are involved at some stage in children
and youth football, at spurious ''S'' forms and the like, from senior
football clubs, who do so little at the end of the day to promote the
art they live off.
''Look at the wee lads,'' said Bill. ''They are showing off their
individual skills, but learning to be part of a team. And what a goal
that was from Auchinleck Talbot.''
It was against his team the wee lad had scored, a volley in the back
of the net, two shimmies against a couple of 11-year-old giants by the
black and gold-clad striker. It hit the net and hit the back of my spine
with the splendour of it all. This is football being played the way the
big boys should attempt it. This was Sunday, the under-11s.
We will be back about this at a later date. Glasgow Schools Football
Association have been in contact with The Herald, and with me. The
launch of their new venture for what match secretary Angus Johnston
tells me is about real football, is in September.
Scotland manager Craig Brown is working in close harmony with this
initiative, for I know this to be dear to his heart. One of football and
Scotland's greatest scholars and gentlemen, Jimmy Crawford, is the
President of the Glasgow School FA and you cannot believe how proud I am
to be asked to help myself. What the hell: I wisnae a bad wee player
myself. No' as good as some the wee boys and girls at Cumnock at the
weekend at that.

OLYMPIC champion Marc Rosset held his nerve to defeat Michael Stich in
the final of the Halle Open yesterday.
Stich broke Rosset's serve in the second and seventh games of the
first set to take it 6-3. But Rosset picked up his play in the second
set which he won 13-11 in a tie-breaker.
In the third set, Rosset got his first match ball with the second
tie-breaker score at 6-5, but Stich held his serves to gain his fourth
match ball at 7-6. Rosset again pulled even, gained match balls at 8-7
and 9-8, then fired a hard serve that Stich could not control.

A SPECTACULAR sea of saltires, tartan, and bagpipes brought the
re-enactment of Bonnie Prince Charlie's Jacobite march of 1745 to a
close yesterday in Edinburgh.
Around 200 footsore walkers descended the final few hundred feet to
Holyrood Park, led by the Drambuie Pipe Band to the strains of Scotland
the Brave.
Unlike his eighteenth century predecessor, who refused to acknowledge
the prince, Edinburgh's Lord Provost Norman Irons warmly greeted the
royal visitor, alias 37-year-old Alex Cameron, who was astride a white
charger.
In August 1745, Bonnie Prince Charlie and his army marched by
Duddingston and through the royal park -- avoiding cannon fire from
Edinburgh Castle -- to the Palace of Holyroodhouse.
He took up residence in the palace, despite fierce opposition from the
capital's business community, including the Bank of Scotland, which
gathered in and destroyed its bank notes ahead of the Jacobite army,
thus depriving the Highlanders of credit.
Mr Cameron, of Aberdour, Fife, was one of 45 marchers who had
completed the entire 240-mile walk, which started in Glenfinnan a
fortnight before.
They were presented with a commemorative certificate by the Lord
Provost to mark their achievement.
Among the 45 who completed the entire course was Mr Bob Wylie, 34,
from Johnstone, Renfrewshire. The unemployed father-of-two pulled on his
walking boots when his four-year-old son, Dean, suffered a serious lung
problem and Mr Wylie then learned of the lack of research cash
available.
''I decided to do it as a way of raising money for research. I'm glad
I've done it,'' he said.
Organisers, Bighearted Scotland, hope to have raised thousands of
pounds in sponsorship and collections for nine Scottish charities.
Meanwhile, a scrap of material which has been hidden in a public
school vault for half a century has been identified as part of the
Prince's kilt.
The piece of tartan was ripped off as the Prince fled from the
battlefield of Culloden. The Museum of Scotland has authenticated the
cloth and has now accepted it as an exhibit.
Fifty years ago, the scrap of tartan was passed to the Roman Catholic
public school Stoneyhurst College, near Preston, Lancashire.
It was handed over by a Scottish family together with a note stating
its importance.
It is a blue-green tartan with red, black, and yellow stripes.
In honour of the cloth, the school has had the tartan made up and it
has been used to cover chairs in the college's Stuart Parlour.
Mr Peter Anwyl, director of admission and development at the school,
said: ''When the museum authenticated the tartan, it was a very exciting
moment. An old boy called Tom Massey-Lynch had started the investigation
eight years ago and the Museum of Scotland joined in.''
It is thought the scrap comes from a kilt given to Bonnie Prince
Charlie by one Catriona McDonald.

BRITAIN'S Jonathan Edwards produced the longest triple jump ever at
the European Cup in Lille yesterday.
The 29-year-old Gateshead Harrier came up with an astonishing 18.43
metres with his second jump of the competition.
A wind of 2.4 metres per second ruled it out as a world record -- the
legal limit is 2.0 -- but Edwards, who once refused to compete on
Sundays because of his religious beliefs, promptly broke his own British
record with his next jump, 17.72m, as the wind reading showed 0.5mps.
The previous longest leap in history was the wind-assisted 18.20 of
American Willie Banks in 1988. Banks holds the official world record at
17.97, set in 1985.
Afterwards, Edwards set his sights on Banks's official world record.
''I'm not saying it's there for the taking,'' he said.
''But on the right day, I must be in with a chance. I would love it to
happen in this country and it would be a dream come true if the record
came at next Sunday's meeting at Gateshead.
''I was there when Steve Backley broke the world javelin record at
Crystal Palace and that was tremendous. Abroad wouldn't be the same.''
Edwards, third in the 1993 world championships and now a strong
contender for this year's title in Gothenburg, said: ''I was suffering
from the effects of a virus last year and I wanted just to re-establish
myself this season.
''I knew I was in pretty good shape, but I certainly wasn't prepared
for anything like this. The British record jump felt like a sack of
potatoes. It seemed more like 16.20. But obviously the team effort
behind me is paying off.''
Edwards, whose coach Carl Johnson is supplemented by a technical
adviser and weights man, opened with 17.90 (wind 2.5), followed his big
one with the new British mark, then jumped 18.39 (3.7) before calling it
a day.

THE HOLLOW YEARS:
France in the 1930s
by Eugen Weber
Sinclair Stevenson:#20
PERHAPS one reason why the French regularly render themselves so
objectionable is that, for much of the past two centuries, they have
been pretty much of a failure as a nation.
Their monarchy collapsed in revolution. The greatest figure thrown up
by that cataclysm, Napoleon, led them to defeat. There were further
revolutions, then a second -- absolutely humiliating -- defeat in 1870.
Victory against the same enemy came in 1918, but at a cost that made it
scarcely better than defeat. And yet another defeat was on the way, but
in the meantime victory improved scarcely anything, as is well
illustrated in this excellent new book by Eugen Weber, who has made a
specialism of this sorry period, among others.
These were hollow years in several senses; hollow because they only
filled a gap between two disastrous wars, hollow because they seemed in
themselves so lacking in significance and direction. What was the
country for? Where was it going?
France's rivals as great powers on the European continent -- Germany,
Italy, even Russia -- thought they had the answer to such questions. Her
rivals beyond it, Britain and the United States, felt less certain,
though they were never as completely dispirited as France. Their
complacent assumptions were caught short by the Depression, but they set
to with some energy to get themselves out of it.
There was nothing similar to bring France to her senses. Much less
developed industrially, she did not suffer the same crash in 1929. By
the same token, she did not benefit from its shock value. Her
unemployment rose as her trade with stricken countries fell, yet there
was no urgent search for solutions, and little enough sense of any
political responsibility for finding them. Weber remarks acidly that
French politicians did not enter the twentieth century till the 1950s or
1960s.
He is concerned not so much with comparisons as with finding out what
was rotten in the state of France. This offers his readers a varied and
colourful, if unappetising, repast. There was scarcely a fertile or
flourishing field of the country's life: barren decay meets his gaze on
every hand. The nation seemed almost to be preparing to make its defeat
explicit in 1940.
When we look at France's smiling landscapes today, we may find it
difficult to conceive what a place of physical squalor it was little
more than half a century ago. French cities had their slums, like every
city, and the misery that went with them. But it was hardly better in
the countryside, where many peasants still eked out an almost
unimaginably primitive existence.
Amid all this there were stark contrasts. Weber's book has striking
photographs, one series showing the plutocrats at play. His caption
reads: ''The rich are seldom richer than when the poor are poor -- at
least visibly. They gathered at garden parties, whose informality looks
very relative; for late evening drinks or dinners providing
opportunities to show off bodies, gowns, and evening wear as sleek as
money could buy; and at functions like the annual competitions of
automobile elegance, where beauties and their pets teamed up with their
pets to demonstrate stylish wealth.''
The whole naturally made for extreme social tensions. In 1934, Paris
saw riots at least as severe as those of 1968. They followed the affair
of Serge Stavisky, a swindler of uncertain origin caught embezzling the
municipal funds of Bayonne. His subsequent death was officially
described as a suicide, but many suspected that the police had not
balked at murdering a friendless crook.
The scandal broke just as, on February 6, one of the interminable
series of weak governments was being formed under Edouard Daladier,
something of a progressive. ''Two hundred families are masters of the
French economy and, in fact, of French politics. These are forces that a
democratic state should not tolerate,'' he had declared.
That could not save him now, as a provincial affair brought the
country's troubles to a head. Communists descended on the Place de la
Concorde to make their views forcefully known to the National Assembly
on the other side of the Seine. Fascist and royalist thugs arrived in
their wake, along with old soldiers protesting at cuts in their pensions
and ''down-at-heel taxpayers''. A pitched battle broke out; 15 were
killed and more than 1500 wounded.
Daladier, having just been voted into office, promptly resigned. His
thickset build had won him a nickname, the Bull of the Vaucluse, but he
was, in one of Weber's happy phrases ''a bull with the horns of a
snail''. Yet he could also be counted among France's more upright public
figures, a man of the people, a war veteran and conspicuously honest.
One may well imagine what the rest were like.
What could be done? Weber's overall message, delivered at once with
nice irony and unsparing perception, is that nothing could be done. This
was a society hopelessly sunk in corruption and incompetence, its
burdens unfair, its rewards unjust, every reform blocked by vested
interests and political fecklessness. Hardly anybody wanted to defend
it.
Frenchmen's travails had made them hate foreigners: Jews and
immigrants were abused, often physically, with little less virulence
than in the countries that went fascist. In the end they preferred to
submit to a conqueror's yoke rather than sort themselves out. Some did
fight bravely in 1940; others just marched into German captivity.
All this may help us to understand a little more clearly the
less-pleasant traits of Frenchmen that we can observe even now. We still
see the egotism, the incessant, ruthless, calculating concentration on
Number One, exactly reflected at a political level in France's
no-less-cynical pursuit of her own interests, the more offensive when
dressed up in abstract rhetorical persiflage.
Yet perhaps the origin of these traits lies in a deep historical sense
of inferiority. Nowadays, amid the evasions and repressions steadily
coming to light, it is less easy to believe that France fully purged
herself through the resistance and liberation of 1944. In fact, the 10
years after the war were not much better than the 10 years before it.
The real difference was made by General de Gaulle's second and third
presidencies, and to some extent by the Gaullist movement he created
(now back in power after a long time in the wilderness).
The general was no less an egotist than the rest of his countrymen
but, seeing France incarnated in himself, he could elevate that egotism
into a great principle which put France first. ''Toute ma vie je me suis
fait une certain idee de la France,'' is certainly an egotistical
statement; yet it at last gave Frenchmen something to be believe in, and
France's friends something to admire.
Jacques Chirac's prompt explosion of a nuclear bomb in the Pacific
serves notice that the lesson has not been forgotten. Neighbours would
do well to mark that in him France remains determined to preserve her
independence. At any rate, none of this could have happened in the
hollow years.

IT'S rugby, Francois, but not as we know it. It's rugby out of Africa
and it may have changed the face of the worldwide game for all time.
Fly-pasts, sky-divers, a stadium bathed in sunshine, the head of state
adorned in Springbok colours, and the winning captain sinking to his
knees at the moment of victory to thank the Lord for delivering the
William Webb Ellis trophy to die Bokke.
It was Ellis Park, Johannesburg. It was the Rugby World Cup final and,
as we suggested beforehand, the danger for New Zealand was always going
to be that the fervently patriotic atmosphere within the country as a
whole and within the claustrophobic stadium itself would act as an extra
man for the Springboks.
When Francois Pienaar accepted the glittering trophy from Nelson
Mandela, he said it had been a triumph not just for the team and not
only for the 60,000-plus who were fortunate enough to have been there.
It had been a triumph for 43 million South Africans.
They have called the team the Rainbow Warriors and, as unbelievable as
it might have seemed a month ago, the game of rugby union which hitherto
has been the privileged pastime of the Afrikaaner elite has galvanised
the nation, the entire nation, in a manner that few thought possible.
President Nelson Mandela was wearing Pienaar's No.6 Springbok shirt.
He had on, too, a bokke baseball cap. It looked faintly ridiculous, but
such is the towering stature of the man on whom South Africa's future
rests that he, and he alone, could carry it off.
Pienaar was asked what his feelings were when he saw Mandela wearing
his shirt.
''I can't express myself. What can I say? He's wearing my jersey on to
the field. It is one of the biggest thank-yous I have ever received in
my life and it will always be a part of me.''
Mandela had visited the team in the dressing room prior to kick-off.
Pienaar said: ''He said that we all looked calm and he liked that. Then
when he presented me with the trophy, he thanked us for what we had done
for our country. I said we could never have done as much as he has for
South Africa.''
After 104 minutes of rugby, and with the Springboks 15-12 to the good,
Pienaar sank to his knees and clasped his hands in front of his face at
the moment of victory.
What had he been doing? ''We are all Christians. I got down on my
knees and I started praying. Then everybody came in. I thanked the Lord
for giving us the talent to play in a World Cup final and for giving us
the strength to win it,'' he said.
Sitting alongside him in the interview room was match-winner Joel
Stransky, who is of the Jewish faith. The Springbok captain looked
sheepishly to his left for a moment and added with a wide grin before
embracing Stransky in a bear-like hug: ''I should correct myself and say
that we all believe in something. Joel is of the Jewish religion. We all
know that the Jewish religion has a little bit of luck, but what Joel
did today wasn't luck. It was pure skill.''
Stransky was dismissive of his match-winning drop-goal. ''I just said
to Joost van der Westhuizen: 'Give it to me deep and I'll hit it.' On
another day it might have missed.''
Coach Kitch Christie, the Leith Academy old boy, announced within
hours of his side's victory that he was quitting the job. Christie, who
took over only last year, said: ''I was asked to step in and do an
ambulance job. I think my task is complete.'' However, he will be under
heavy pressure not to retire.
Christie said that his side had managed to tame the Jonah Lomu menace.
''We just played our normal defensive patterns, but Francois said at his
team-talk that if one player missed him, the next guy up had to take him
out. He got the ball eight times and we took him out eight times.''
The Ellis Park final was an occasion, an event, which the rugby world
has never seen before. From the fly-past by the South African Airways
Boeing 747, which passed so low over the stands that the rivets could be
counted on the wings, to the post-match sky-diver bearing heraldic
congratulations for the Springboks, the afternoon was a glitzy
spectacular.
The two Springbok anthems, Shosholoza and Hier comme die Bokke,
blasted out over the stadium tannoy system whenever there was a lull in
play for treatment to an injured player.
Pienaar -- diplomatically, because in all likelihood it did --
considered the public address barrage had not lifted his side when heads
were down. ''No, I didn't even notice it. When the game is on, you shut
everything out.
''But it was a rugby match. Do you want people in the stands to keep
quiet? They're South Africans.''
The Springbok skipper was backed by his All Black counterpart. Sean
Fitzpatrick, who said that defeat hurt badly, added that that the
atmosphere and the occasion had been ''just great.''
It was left to du Morne du Plessis, the manager and former Springbok
captain, to underscore what the victory had meant to the South African
nation.
''Three weeks ago we felt the surge of this nation. We felt them all
getting behind this team and I was as convinced yesterday as I was three
weeks ago that the surge of the nation and the emotion of the nation
would carry us through.
''Without taking anything away from these magnificent men who played
for the nation, there was just this unbelievable force and that was what
carried us through.''

A COUPLE set off yesterday to paddle a kayak from Shetland to the
Faroe Islands to remind the British Government of a promise made by Sir
Winston Churchill after the Second World War.
Mr Dan Trotter, 33, a former solicitor, and his wife Karen, 32, of
North Queensferry, hope politicians, particularly from Scotland, will
take up their plea for recognition of the Faroese and their forgotten
contribution to the Allies' victory over the Nazis.
Mrs Trotter said: ''The Faroese lost 132 fishermen under enemy attack
in the last war making the much-needed fish runs to Scotland. They
supplied up to 20% of the protein the Scots consumed during the war.
Churchill said those people would never be forgotten for what they
sacrificed.''
When the couple set off from Walls on the west of Shetland
yesterdaymorning in the 22ft kayak they built themseles, conditions were
ideal with sun, little wind, and a calm sea. They are being accompanied
by friends in a yacht on the journey, which may take up to three days
even in good weather.
Mr Trotter is Tasmanian-born and, until a few years ago, practised law
in Edinburgh while Karen was a child care assistant. After becoming
disillusioned with city life and selling their flat a few years ago, the
Trotters paddled around Tasmania, the Great Barrier Reef, and explored
the fjords of New Zealand.
Edinburgh-born Mrs Trotter said: ''When we came back, we began to look
to our nearest North Atlantic neighbour. We wanted to explore our own
ocean. The Faroese are so similar to the Scots. They've retained their
way of life, reinstated their language, and have won a greater measure
of home rule from Denmark.
''Those islands are only so far north of Cape Wrath as Glasgow is
south of it yet we never hear of these near neighbours.''

THE biggest rail union yesterday pledged to resist any ''mad'' plans
to make railway staff pay to travel to and from work on trains.
Companies bidding to run railway lines when BR is privatised were
thought to be in favour of scrapping the practice of free travel for
drivers and other staff.
The prospect was likely to be attacked at the annual conference of the
Rail Maritime and Transport Union opening in Swansea today.
A union spokesman said last night: ''This is another example of the
madness of privatisation. We will resist very strongly any attempt to
make our members pay for the stupidity of privatisation.''

* BUSINESSMAN John Connor has deferred a decision on whether to invest
#200,000 in Watsonians or Boroughmuir pending the outcome of two crucial
meetings this week.
At Murrayfield tonight, Scotland's senior clubs will tackle the
Scottish Rugby Union about the terms of the recent seven-figure,
three-year sponsorship deal struck with Tennent Caledonian Breweries.
On Friday, the SRU's general committee will move a motion to make it
mandatory for overseas players to reside in Scotland for three months
before they could play for a Scottish club.

AUSTRALIAN media magnate Rupert Murdoch yesterday taunted
northern-hemisphere countries that they would have to play better if
they wanted his company to offer them lucrative contracts.
Murdoch's News Corporation announced a 10-year broadcast deal worth
#366m with South Africa, New Zealand, and Australia on Friday.
But he said yesterday that France, England, Scotland, Ireland, and
Wales would have to wait. ''They will have to learn to play better rugby
in the northern hemisphere if they want to sign up,'' he said.
Southern countries dominated the World Cup, with South Africa and New
Zealand contesting the final.
Murdoch, in northern Italy for talks with fellow media tycoon Silvio
Berlusconi, said he was delighted with the result of Saturday's final,
which South Africa won 15-12.
''We were thrilled. This means we have signed up all the three teams
to have won the World Cup,'' he said.
Under the terms of Friday's agreement, seen as a giant step towards
professionalism, the three southern teams agreed to play an annual
home-and-away Test series through the next decade.
There will also be a new provincial competition involving 12 teams
from the three countries.

ENGLISH champions Blackburn Rovers announced yesterday that Kenny
Dalglish, who guided them to the title just two months ago, will take a
different role at the club next season.
In a statement from Ewood Park, Dalglish was named as director in
charge of football with his assistant Ray Harford being given more
control with regards to the day to day running of the side.
Dalglish, himself, said he wanted to ''ease off from what was
virtually a seven-day-a-week commitment'' while a club spokesman said:
''Jack Walker and the board see this as a natural progression,
maintaining both continuity and stability at the club.''
Essentially, however, the announcement will change little at
Blackburn.
Dalglish, who remains Scotland's most capped international player, has
always given Harford his head in the team training and coaching. The
Blackburn operation has always been about the two men and that will
continue.
Effectively, of course, it also ensures that Harford, a close-season
target for several clubs without managers, will remain in place.
He was a Dalglish appointment and has always maintained: ''I could not
get better working conditions than I have here. Kenny simply lets me do
what I think I do best -- coach.''
Harford was the first signing made by Dalglish when he took over at
Blackburn. That was three-and-a-half years ago, and within half a season
Dalglish had guided the team into the Premiership, via the play-offs.
Backed by local man Jack Walker's millions Dalglish built on that
early success, improving continually until he was able, at last, to
snatch the title from Manchester United last season.
In doing so he became one of only three managers who have guided two
different clubs tok championship victories.
Dalglish, of course, won the FA Cup and league double with Liverpool
during a five-year spell as manager there. Then he walked out of Anfield
amidst rumours over his health.
Less than a year later, though, he returned to the game and success
has followed him, carrying Blackburn, so long unfashionable, all the way
into the European Champions' League next season.
Dalglish returned from a holiday in the United States last weekend. He
has been involved in discussions with the clubs over the direction they
will be taking and yesterday's announcement of a change of title for
himself, and for Harford, was just one of the changes mooted.
Alan Shearer, one of his first major signings, has also agreed to stay
with the Lancashire club.
The England striker signed another four year deal which was also
announced yesterday.

* TREVOR Steven could be set to leave Ibrox for a second time with
Sheffield Wednesday wanting to take the player south.
Paul Gascoigne will be the latest player to join the Ibrox foreign
legion and they still hope to bring in the Romanian Florin Raducioiu,
despite problems surrounding his transfer from Espanol.
Steven, who is in his second spell with the Scottish champions, has
one year remaining of his contract.
He signed from Everton for #1.7m and was sold to Marseille for a
#5m-plus fee. After a year in France he returned to Rangers in 1992 in a
cut-price #2m deal, but has been hampered by injury.
Sheffield are currently involved in a wrangle with Luton over David
Pleat, the man they have named as manager. Luton have slapped a court
order on Pleat to prevent him working in his new post until compensation
has been agreed.

A DOUBLE glazing chargehand has been awarded #5830 for being unfairly
constructively dismissed.
Mr Thomas Robertson, of Dean Park, Penicuik, worked for Penicuik
Advanced Window Systems Ltd, at the firm's Sherwood Works.
An industrial tribunal heard that, during the first half of last year,
the company's factory was operating at a loss and it was decided to
introduce a new management structure.
This involved replacing three chargehand posts with two line
supervisors.
The tribunal noted that on August 12, 1994, one chargehand, Mr D
Mitchell, told Mr Robertson that he, Mr Mitchell, was being promoted to
line supervisor. Several employees told Mr Robertson he was being
demoted.
On August 26, Mr S Henderson, the operations manager, told the
chargehands they were being demoted to fabricator grade, but they could,
with 28 other fabricators, apply for the supervisor posts.
Mr Robertson, 41, said he wasn't prepared to accept the demotion and
said he already knew Mr Mitchell was getting one of the posts. This was
denied by Mr Henderson.
That afternoon Mr Sclater, the third chargehand, heard Mr Mitchell was
getting one of the new jobs. Three days later Mr Cornwall, one of the
foremen, said he had been offered one of the jobs. Mr Robertson resigned
last September because he felt his employer had betrayed him.
The tribunal concluded there had been a fundamental breach of contract
because trust and confidence had been undermined.

Bonn, Sunday,
ARTISTS Christo and Jeanne Claude finally presented their
controversial work ''Wrapped Reichstag'' to a waiting world today.
More than 100,000 people flocked to see what has become one of
Europe's strangest sights -- Berlin's huge Reichstag building enveloped
in silver fabric and tied with blue rope.
Undaunted by an attempted arson attack yesterday, the artists ordered
barriers to be taken away and invited the public to come up close for
the first time.
Sightseers were guided by 150 officials with 60,000 to 70,000 fabric
samples to hand out each day to prevent visitors snipping holes in the
metallic cloth.
Helicopters and small planes hovered overhead and boats packed with
visitors chugged along the nearby Spree River.
The artists have earned notoriety over the years with bizarre projects
such as lining a stretch of Australian coastline with fabric,
surrounding Florida islands in pink plastic, and opening 3000 blue and
yellow umbrellas in Japan and California at the same time.
Wrapping the historic Reichstag building took a week and fulfilled a
long dream for the couple.
The scheme had provoked strong opposition from Chancellor Helmut Kohl
and conservatives who believed it was disrespectful to a building which
had been inaugurated in 1894 as the German Parliament, gutted by fire in
1933, and heavily bombed in 1945.
The project was only narrowly approved last year after a 70-minute
debate in Parliament.
''Christo and Jeanne Claude are very pleased with the project,'' said
their spokesman. ''It's on such a vast scale, they have to absorb the
art piece first before assessing it.''
Delayed by high winds and storms in unseasonly wintry weather, it took
a team of 92 climbers three days longer than scheduled to cover the
101-year-old grey stone edifice with one million sq ft of fabric.
Describing the attack, a spokeswoman for Christo said: ''They fired a
burning arrow at the front portal. It burned for a while making a small
hole and then fizzled out. The silver fabric is flameproof so it doesn't
burn long.''
Bulgarian emigre Christo and his French wife Jeanne Claude, who have
become Germany's celebrities of the moment since they started wrapping
the building due to house Parliament by the year 2000, are always
prepared for attacks, she added.
Germans are divided over whether the artists are using the Reichstag
for self-publicity or whether the wrap can genuinely be called art.
Many, however, are enthusiastic about the creation of such a
controversial work of art right on their doorstep.
''The 'Wrapped Reichstag' has already captured the imagination of many
people,'' said Rita Suessmuth, president of the German Parliament, on
Friday.
She thanked the artists, who spent #7.2m of their own money on the
project.
''We've not paid a penny and have been given the art work as a
present. Christo and Jeanne Claude have made the Reichstag into a
monument,'' said Berlin's mayor Eberhard Diepgen.--Reuter.

South Africa 15,
New Zealand 12
(after extra time)
THE All Blacks saved their worst for last and it cost them the Rugby
World Cup.
That is a harsh judgement on a young side who have played, by far, the
best rugby of the tournament. But when it counted most at Ellis Park on
Saturday, the youngsters in the New Zealand side failed to perform and,
most importantly of all, Jonah Lomu was tackled and shackled out of the
game.
No praise is high enough for the Springboks. In front of a fervently
patriotic capacity crowd of 64,000 they defended as no team has done
throughout the entire tournament.
Lomu was to have been the key to Kiwi success. His devastating
finishing, allied to the all-round ability of his team-mates, was what
got the New Zealanders to the final. If the Springboks could stop Lomu,
then Francois Pienaar and not Sean Fitzpatrick would be in receipt of
the William Webb Ellis trophy from President Nelson Mandela.
This was Test match rugby at its most intense, its most impelling.
There has probably not been a game like it in the history of rugby union
football. The pre-match festivities, the charismatic presence of
President Mandela (complete with baseball cap and Pienaar's No.6
jersey), the notion that here was a Springbok side playing not just a
game of rugby but acting as a bright new catalyst for a unified South
Africa -- one nation, one team.
There were no tries, but the game suffered not from that. The two
sides were tied after 80 minutes and still inseparable after the first
half of extra time. Joel Stransky's drop-goal in the ninty-fourth minute
was all that separated the sides after 104 minutes of rugby.
The first half was an enthralling spectacle. In the second period the
game died just a little. But in those 20 minutes of extra time 43m South
Africans held their breath as the Boks strove to make history and to
atone for those years of diplomatic and sporting isolation.
The Springbok pack was the bedrock of success. The experiment of
playing lock Mark Andrews out of position at No.8 worked well and, for
the first time in the tournament, the Kiwi pack -- Ian Jones at the
lineout apart -- was forced to accept second best.
Zinzan Brooke, the All Blacks' gifted No.8 was palpably unfit. He has
been carrying an Achille's injury and was dramatically off the pace. The
forward effort was disrupted, too, by the injury-induced replacements of
both Mike Brewer and Craig Dowd, an indication of just how hard fought
the battle up front had been.
The eagerly awaited confrontation between James Small and Lomu never
materialised in a straight, one-on-one situation. But Small, emotions in
overdrive and in tears as the teams lined up for the national anthems,
did the job which coach Kitch Christie had allocated to him. His
bristling presence on the right wing kept Lomu in check, and whenever
the big Tongan turned inside he was chopped down by Mulder and le Roux
or by the inestimable Andrews and Ruben Kruger.
Christie had intimated that he wanted to pressurise the All Black
half-back combination of Graeme Bachop and Andrew Mehrtens. Well,
Bachop, who was in the wars throughout, had to retire for near enough 10
minutes for repairs to a heavy head knock and Mehrtens missed four
drop-goal attempts, so that strategy obviously worked.
It was young Mehrtens, though, who kicked New Zealand into a lead in
the fifth minute after South Africa were penalised on their own
twenty-two. Momentarily, the huge Ellis Park crowd was silenced.
Five minutes later the Springboks equalised, van der Westhuizen, le
Roux and Andrews setting up the ruck at which the All Blacks, this time,
fell foul of referee Ed Morrison, and Stranksy speared the ball between
the uprights.
Mehrtens kicked New Zealand back in front with a penalty goal after 13
minutes. Lomu, intruding down the middle of the park was brought to
earth by a splendid van der Westhuizen tackle but, again, the South
Africans were penalised for going over the top at the ruck.
As the first quarter came to an end the Springboks mounted a period of
sustained pressure. From a lineout on the New Zealand line Hannes
Strydom plucked a perfect ball and van der Westhuizen, Stransky and
Mulder attacked the Kiwi goal-line. Next, Chris Rossouw threw himself at
the Kiwi defenders, but the All Blacks held firm.
A scrummage five metres out saw first Andrews and then van der
Westhuizen launch ferocious attacks. Kruger was next, and he actually
made it over the line, but Morrison deemed that the ball had been held
up.
Scrum 5 and put-in to South Africa. The Kiwis creaked backwards,
Andrews had the ball at his feet and a try seemed in the offing when the
scrummage went down. A penalty try was a possibility, but Morrison opted
to give Stransky a shot at goal. The ball flew sweet and true and the
Springboks were level-pegging once again.
The Springboks took the lead after 35 minutes with a Stransky
drop-goal which followed a fearsome four-ruck sequence by the South
Africans, and a frantic five minutes before the interval saw the ball
played from end to end.
The South Africans had shaded the first half and in the second period
began to drive home their advantage. The All Blacks were looking
decidedly ragged as unforced errors began to creep into their game.
Lomu failed to hold a simple mid-field pass and the crowd jeered. The
role that the crowd played cannot be underestimated. This was a truly
hostile atmosphere for the All Blacks, the intimidation even extending
to the public address system, which boomed the home team anthems
whenever there was an injury-induced lull in play.
After 55 minutes New Zealand equalised, Mehrtens kicking the penalty
goal which followed a lineout ruck. The South Africans would be happy
enough to have conceded only a penalty, though, for once again Lomu had
been unleashed down the left touchline and Mulder had cut him down into
touch.
Later, Christie was to observe that eight times Lomu had been given
the ball and that eight times he had been driven to the deck. It always
took at least two men, the first tackler taking the sting out of the
attack and the second finishing off the job. The important thing was to
prevent Lomu re-cycling the ball and, invariably, this was achieved to
outstanding effect.
For the final 20 minutes of regular time the two sides were
deadlocked. Then it was down to extra time.
Within a minute New Zea land had gone ahead through a Mehrtens penalty
goal. That silenced the crowd, but not for long. Stransky put up a
steepling up and under, le Roux chased like a greyhound from the trap
and New Zealand were penalised at the ruck. Stransky kicked the penalty
goal and the teams were tied once again.
Then, after a month of rugby, it all came down to 10 minutes of play.
Stransky put up another high ball, the New Zealanders knocked on and
Morrison whistled for a scrummage on the Kiwi 22-metre line.
The New Zealanders knew what was going to happen next, the crowd knew.
The whole world knew. Stransky lined up for the drop-goal. At the first
time of asking the scrummage slewed around and Morrison ordered the ball
to be put in again. Stransky was still waiting, perfectly positioned.
The ball was in and out of the scrum in a flash. Van der Westhuizen
whipped it out to Stransky, the fly-half swung the right boot and South
Africa had achieved the impossible dream.

YOU know, this article is for rugby players only, and it just goes to
show that sometimes, no matter how hard you try in life, it is still
possible to fail. Stories don't always have a happy ending.
This particular All Black campaign had a sick ending, but history will
only record that they lost. There is no second prize in the World Cup.
Losers are losers. Watching Sean Fitzpatrick and his side look on as the
South Africans receive their prize from Nelson Mandela was a learning
experience, I can tell you.
The All Black campaign to win this World Cup started last October,
when a squad of 50 players was split into two groups, one of 30 and
another of 20, with only the top group attending the week-long training
camps.
At the first camp the management, who had invited along the players'
wives and girlfriends, explained to the ladies that they would be the
ones to suffer the most in the lead-up to the World Cup.
It was they who would be left alone for days on end as the men trained
and then left for South Africa. They were asked for their patience, and
for those that cooked, diet sheets were given out.
That first training camp lasted four days, and like all of the camps
to come -- ending at Tapoe -- it was chosen because the conditions were
like those the team would come across in South Africa.
To hone ball-handling skills all of the players were encouraged to
play in the many summer touch rugby tournaments that abound in their
country.
Fitness specialist Martin Toomey was consulted and the players'
programmes meant they would be expected to train for 20 hours a week
outside their normal routines.
The 1991 World Cup had been a disaster for New Zealand, so Brian
Lochore was determined to regain the support of the New Zealand public.
To increase their profile, the squad undertook a bus journey through
their land that lasted for the month of February, stopping off every day
in both scheduled and impromptu venues.
Jonah Lomu was the biggest beneficiary of the trip as the players
trained twice a day during the excercise which was called ''Black on
Track.'' It got the team back to the people.
Splitting the preparation squad into two separate groups was the most
significant aspect as a level of competition arose that even the most
cynical All Blacks had never seen before. Both squads were fitness
tested and the results of one group immediately relayed to the members
of the other for comparison. It spread panic. The players who were not
invited to join the top group's training camps had the added urge to
prove that they should be there.
I've said before that the All Blacks are a competitive bunch, and as
part of gathering the information for this piece I've also found out
just how much winning means to them.
Everything on the training pitch is competitive, but the All Blacks as
individuals do nothing but compete all day long. They race eating their
food, they have press-up competitions, they race to get their laundry
back. It's just part of them. And I like that.
To put the lid on things they played Canada and stuck 73 points on
them. The A squad banged in 70 points over the B squad, then put 50 past
a President's XV. Then came here to South Africa.
Lomu was deliberately witheld from the press, because they wanted him
to appear superhuman. They did not want the world to know that he is
just a nice young lad with an amazing physique and mind-blowing
capabilities with the ball in hand.
They deliberately took their foot off the pedal when the game with
Scotland was won. They did the same with England. Then they got sick and
came up against a highly motivated and shoulder-padded South African
side who played like demons.
Can you ever, any of you rugby players, imagine what it must be like
to be an All Black today? Can you imagine putting in all of that work
and then losing? I would cry for a week.
It goes to show that you really have to lose to know just how sweet it
is to win.

CULLODEN will be celebrated in London. Naturally. Bonnie Prince
Charlie never reached the English capital but his exhibition will.
Called Bonnie Prince Charlie: Fact and Fiction, the exhibition is at
Kelvingrove Art Gallery, Glasgow, until late summer. Then it tours to
Derby -- the fatal turning point in 1745. By April 16, the 250th
anniversary of Culloden, it will have moved on to the National Army
Museum for its London showing.
''It's quite unlike almost every exhibition dealing with the subject
before,'' says Robert Woosnam-Smith, who put the show together.
''Previous exhibitions have been very much a matter of 'what a shame the
Stuarts didn't get the throne of Britain, or aren't the Stuarts
wonderful people'. But there are two sides.
''As far as three-quarters of Britain was concerned, Culloden was a
good thing, even for Glasgow -- which was threatened with being sacked
by Charlie. Glasgow was a town of about 8000 inhabitants, and here was
the Jacobite army, Gaelic speakers from a different culture, coming its
way and threatening to burn it down. Glasgow said thank you, we're doing
very well under the Union.''
Not that Butcher Cumberland, the brother of King George II, who
crushed the impetuous Jacobite clansmen at Culloden, and harried them
mercilessly after the battle, comes out of it in a better light. The
exhibition takes a level-headed view of what Woosnam-Smith sees as the
last civil war on British soil.
Woosnam-Smith (a Welshman) scathingly dismisses the idea that ''it was
Scotland v England, the last match''. His aim has been to put the events
leading up to Culloden in context.
Charles Edward Louis James Casimir Sylvester Xavier Maria (called
Carluccio by his doting father) was born in 1720, launched his uprising
at the age of 25 in hope of setting his father on the throne, and died
drink-sodden and embittered 43 years later.
An early portrait, one of several in the exhibition, shows him at the
age of 11, already a handsome lad and showing the arrogance that would
lead him and his too-trusting followers to disaster.
Clear captions tell the story, and among the exhibits are paintings,
engravings, maps, medals, banners, glass, silver and arms. On the blade
of a Jacobite basket-hilted sword the (mis-spelt) motto is engraved:
''Prospiretty to Scotland and No Union'', with ''God bless King James
the 8'' on the other side. Who knows whether the message was ever driven
home? No bloodstains remain.
Defeat is always a powerful emotive force in art and some of the most
striking pictures are high romantic pieces like Disbanded, by John
Pettie, showing a scantily clad clansman trudging through the snow. But
victory has its icons too, including a vast Dovecot tapestry made in
1933 showing the Jacobite army at prayer before Prestonpans.
* Bonnie Prince Charlie, Fact and Fiction, is at Kelvingrove Art
Gallery, Glasgow, until August 27. A book of essays, 1745: Charles
Edward Stuart and the Jacobites is available, price #11.95.

CELTIC are confident that their problem with television companies over
the siting of cameras at Parkhead will be resolved before the season
kicks off in August, writes Ken Gallacher.
Reports yesterday suggested that the club could be blacked out by BBC,
STV, and Sky because of the lack of ''suitable facilities.''
But yesterday, club spokesman Peter McLean insisted: ''We are still
talking about this matter to the TV people. We are sure that we will be
able to reach agreement.''
Traditionally, the Glasgow club housed the cameras on a gantry above
the fans in the old Jungle, and that was still the situation when seats
were put into that area. Now, however, a new stand has risen there --
without facilities which would suit the cameras.
It is understood that the television negotiators have insisted that
their new position should be in what was once the press box, on the roof
of the main stand. That, though, is now used as a hospitality suite.
Offers of alternative placements have been turned down. A new gantry
atop the Sky box has been deemed unsafe, for instance. Even an area
close to the directors' box has been turned down for the moment. Yet,
while there is disagreement over that position, it may well be that the
cameras will end up in an area similar to that one.

Clare Henry reports that the buzz is still around at Glasgow School of
Art's degree show
IF only I had a fiver for each time I attended a degree show and was
then asked: ''Any stars this year? Is painting dead? What should I be
buying? Is it a good year? A bad year?'' Unfortunately degree shows
can't be pigeonholed as easily as that.
It's hard to build a reputation; harder still to keep it. Glasgow
School of Art, celebrating its 150th anniversary, has established its
name around the globe. Mackintosh put Glasgow's artistic achievement in
the 1890s spotlight. During the past decade GSA has once more become a
name to conjure with on an international scale. This year's graduates,
all 229 of them, have not let us down.
What is sadly missing is good old straightforward painting or
sculpture. Cross fertilisation of departments and integration of
subjects has opened things up so much that one painter creates an
architectural computer installation, another a walk-in maze; a
printmaker and sculptor both grow alfalfa grass; a photographer encases
snails.
As all 101 fine art students are exhibited as a job lot (studios often
contain a painter, photographer, printmaker or sculptor and
environnmental artist), this is confusing for the public. On their
behalf I beg for basic signage, (nothing fancy, just name and
department) next year.
But what a privilege degree show time is. High spots? Photography has
blossomed and for once there is no house style. See Roche Gordon's
cleverly posed pulp-fiction glossies; Rothera's children, Blair's
daffodil salad and witty tin tree; Burnett's dark woods, Timmerman's
lilies, and Gotto's birds and beautifully etched snail trails. Even
Ashford's catalogue cover is an artwork -- it glows in the dark.
Sculpture is on the up, with a wonderful aromatic room from MacLean.
Klooster's cast doll heads and rubber glove toys are quite remarkable;
so too Shaw's shrivelled turnip gargoyles. Carter's clever trees grow
axes and billiard cues while Payne's balancing acts give pause for
thought -- but Mackinnon could have done more with her boat.
Printed textiles is also a good year with not a dud in sight. Of 20,
four got firsts, five go on to postgrads in London and 13 already have
cloth in production. Here elegance and kitsch can both succeed with
Russell, Mann and McGhee unforgettable. A recent trawl through graduates
from the past five years found almost every one working, which speaks
volumes for the success of Print &amp; Knit.
The best drawing I saw was in printmaking. Both Conacher and Newman
are powerful etchers; Taylor has atmosphere while Barrowman's seed head
is superb. His boxes of light sensitive grass are a brain wave and
should take him far.
The most enthused-over painter was Lucy Williams whose veiled oils
barely hint at imperceptible light and window panes. I also like her
subtle, sophisticated Interact etchings.
Artist/teacher Callum Innes has a herd of followers; so too Andy
Warhol by the looks of Thompson's skilfully textured portraits. I
enjoyed Sharpe's drawings while Lockhart and Kirsop look good. Jewellery
sports an exquisite silver dish from Cameron, plaited bracelet by
McGuinnes and cactus necklace while Neville's woven dandelion and seed
textiles demonstrate the welcome alliance of ideas and skills.
There are notable environmentalists in the Master of Fine Art at the
Barnes Building with Forde's incandescent white room installation a
must. Heaven.
Don't miss Grierson's saturated colour videos, Currall's gripping
video monologue, McCourt's flowers, Stevenson's cowpats and chewing gum,
and Teehan's tantalising reinterpretations of Paul Reymond's nudes which
leave plenty to the imagination. That Morton has survived six years and
emerged as a fine romantic abstract painter says a lot for her
determination in the face of overwhelming odds. Painting is no longer
fashionable here.
So you won't find a Steven Campbell or a Jenny Saville -- but the buzz
is still around, albeit in different spheres.
With so much talent on display nationwide, it's a fight to ''get
visible'' -- but here product design students score a first. The 15
students have gone global, promoting themselves and their products
successfully on the Internet. The response has been immense with
inquiries from the States, Japan, Australia and even England. -- in fact
a better response from abroad than from slow-witted Scottish industry.
Their external examiner, Cologne's Professor Thomas Bley, was
impressed. ''I tell you these students are special.'' All 15 worked on
the Internet but Hugo Manassei, soon off to LA, created the site
interface. Together with Ed Whiting, he also won prizes for finding new
uses for that old fashion material: wood. His shelving system and
Whiting's elegant beech laminate chair show boundaries are there to be
pushed. Stevenson is making Norman Buchan's memorial, the first time in
decades there has been a GSA commission for the city.
Overall there are faults, practical and philosophical. Videos
everywhere are ''not working''.
Olivia Reynolds doesn't favour secrets. She has the courage not just
to overcome mental illness and talk about it, but to research it,
produce a leaflet -- and make paintings. Her Positive Guide to Mental
Health, sponsored by Strathclyde, is a tour de force. It gives the
facts, and communicates in an easy, friendly, youthful, straight way.
''It takes a combination of heart and eye to make art work,'' said one
examiner. So what's the biggest problem? Student poverty. Why do
graduates persevere? They have big hearts.

ANY day, somewhere in Morocco, the sun is shining. And within hours of
feeling the sand of the Sahara between your toes, you can be ski-ing in
the Atlas mountains. This diversity is just one of this country's
fascinations.
It is a land of legend and allure, two oceans lapping against endless
beaches, an Africa that is an extension of metropolitan France, and an
independent Arab state without Islamic fanaticism. Weatherwise the
holiday season starts in December and goes right through to November.
Down on the Atlantic coast, the town of Agadir attracts 300 days of
warm sunshine and lies alongside a wide, tide-washed beach that is the
ultimate dream of the beach-lounger. The desert approaches, the
mountains and the historic city of Marrakesh are all within a day's
excursion.
The town itself -- destroyed in the 1960 earthquake -- may be
flamboyantly un-Moroccan but it has pleasing modern architecture, top
class hotels and a westernised promenade sporting all tourist
facilities. It does have districts, however -- such as that around the
bus and taxi terminus -- that are as Moroccan, or Arab -- as anywhere in
North Africa or the Middle East.
On the edge of the Sahara, Tiznit brings to mind a fortified desert
oasis in the Beau Geste mould, encircled by a crenelated red wall.
Silver is its business and old Berber brooches and ornaments are
displayed for all to buy. Beyond Tiznit lies Goulimine where the ''blue
men'' of the desert gather with their camels to trade with all-comers.
The end of the road southwards is Laayoune and the last urban centre
before the Mauritanian border.
If deserts are not your scene, try going east to the mountains. The
first town of interest along the road from Agadir is Taroudant, another
walled urban centre, its battlements the pride and joy of the citizens.
From the outside these lowering bastions seem to guard some cruel
fortress but, within them, is a friendly mix, the sweet-smelling spices
laid out for sale overcoming more pungent odours. Not far distant is
Tafraout which boasts a landscape of mammoth rose-red boulders with the
pink kasbahs of the town perched on spurs of rock or clinging
tenaciously to the cliff walls.
To the north are the imperial cities, the nearest being Marrakesh, an
imposing city from the time of the Almoravides, the Almohades and the
Saadians with buildings that inspired Sir Winston Churchill to reproduce
its scenes on canvas.
Back in Agadir, the mix of two worlds remains enchanting. Walk or take
a taxi to the kasbah at the top of the hill overlooking the town, from
which the view is magnificent. Should the tourist restaurants and bars
pall try the little fresh eateries near the port where fish straight
from the sea can be enjoyed at communal tables.
Moroccan cuisine need hold no qualms. Its surprises are more sweet
than fiery hot. Preceding the fish a soup such as harira made from
lentils, onions, mutton, veal, lemons and tomatoes is often served.
Chicken is a staple diet though the scrawny birds make indifferent
eating. And when you think the meal is over along comes that plate of
cous-cous, the national dish, you had probably imagined to be a Moroccan
myth.

YES, surf's up, the sun is shining from a clear, blue Californian sky
-- the lazy, hazy days of summer have officially arrived -- and
Hollywood is all hope.
And hype.
Between now and Labour Day weekend, which ends on September 4, there
will be a celluloid glut with the release of 54 films. It is a complex
time for those in front, behind and paying for the cameras. At it's most
simple it pares down to Lights! Camera! Money! That is what the action
is all about.
Incredibly, of that half-century-plus of movies, five of them add up
to almost one billion dollars in production and marketing costs. Overall
cost increases have resulted in slim profit margins -- about 4% -- and
it is becoming increasingly difficult for companies to see their
products land on the right side of the ledger. A film given wide
exposure in cinemas has a 1-in-14 chance to gross more than $100m during
the American summer.
Profits can be huge. But so can losses.
Despite frantic attempts to discover one there is no formula.
Audiences are always unpredictable. Big names, big budgets, and big
action do not automatically endorse big expectations. Or cheques.
Studios release their most expensive films in the summer parameters
because these weeks account for 40% of the annual box office revenue.
''It's the longest sustained movie-going period of the year -- 15 weeks
of seven days a week movie-going.
With so many films juggling for attention, more and more money goes
into marketing. This is going to be Hollywood's costliest summer ever.
The competitive climate has pushed marketing costs to a high of between
$25m and $30m for every movie. And that is just in America. That cost is
doubled for international sales.
Which is how you easily reach the billion-dollar-bunch. Kevin
Costner's Waterworld, which at $175m is the most expensive film ever
produced, easily boosts the sums. Batman Forever with Val Kilmer as the
Caped Crusader joined by Chris O'Donnell as Robin and some new villains
adds $100m.
Bruce Willis's Die Hard: With a Vengeance adds $90m; Sylvester
Stallone's Judge Dredd puts $85m in the kitty and Steven Seagal's sequel
to Under Siege contributes $70m.
That is before marketing costs which could run at $60m a time and
probably more for Costner's wait-and-see Waterworld and the supercharged
sales drive planned for Batman Forever.
John Krier's organisation, Exhibitor Relations Company, tracks box
office results and he says: ''So far there is only one picture -- Batman
Forever -- that looks to be a $200m film. It's the unanimous choice of
cinema owners.''
Willis's third Die Hard adventure -- again the British fill the bad
guy spot with Jeremy Irons being oily and evil -- did exemplary business
when it first opened in the US.
But will the numbers finally cover the costs and slip into that tiny
profit margin slot?
Peter Chernin the chairman of 20th Century Fox said: ''I think you
have more big-bet movies than last year. Overall productions costs of
this summer's slate is more expensive than last year. The money
questions are how elastic is the marketplace, will it expand to
accommodate all the pictures, and how far?''
There is likely to be room for Apollo 13 which is one of the most
anticipated upcoming pictures with Tom Hanks as Commander James Lovell.
The $60m space adventure about the agonies of the aborted 1970 manned
moon mission is launched in America next month. Already, there is talk
of an Oscar hat-trick for Hanks to follow Forrest Gump and Philadelphia.
Even an Oscar nomination, his third consecutive one, would put him in
the record books.
The more investment, the more marketing dollars will be spent. If a
film fails to flourish in its first American weekend or audiences drop
off a week later, the marketing money dries up and the video store
shelves are the next stop.
The dollars are mostly spent on action movies which are proven
international audience-pleasers.
Last year the box office broke records with revenue of $2.2 billion.
Disney's The Lion King and Forest Gump each grossed more than $200m. But
at the same time Kevin Costner's $70m Wyatt Earp flopped earning only
$26m.
Now, Universal Studios -- already banking on Apollo 13, a true story
that is stranger than fiction -- is nervously waiting the reaction to
Waterworld. In the futuristic thriller the polar ice caps have melted
and Earth is pretty much covered with water. The Jolly Roger has made a
revival and the pirates are led by -- yes, it's him again -- perennial
bad boy Dennis Hopper.
Universal hopes the film is as scary as it's budget. But such is the
concern that the project has found itself in choppy waters. That in turn
has made Waterworld a must-see movie.
Mel Gibson this summer is in a kilt as William Wallace in Braveheart;
Richard Gere in armour as Lancelot to Sean Connery's King Arthur in
First Knight and Jeff Bridges as Wild Bill Hicock.
Stallone's outing to the twenty-second century as the futuristic
British comic strip lawman Judge Dredd. Hotly tipped as a ''sleeper'' is
Mall Rats which stars Shannen Doherty from television's Beverley Hills
90210 and also Kids which deals, without gloss, on the disenchantments
of a group aged under 18 who are into drugs and casual sex.
Sex is also a big issue for Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep in The
Bridges of Madison County. In Forget Paris Billy Crystal and Debra
Winger are the lovers while Meg Ryan and Kevin Kline do the honours in
French Kiss.
Disney with its fabulous money-making animation record have another
licence to make money -- Pocahontas. This is the tale of a New Age
Indian princess who meets a seventeenth-century English settler who has
Mel Gibson's voice.
Other children's movies include Casper the friendly ghost, and an
adaptation of the popular children's book The Indian in the Cupboard.
For all ages there's Babe which is about a pig that wants to be a
sheepdog.
All the films want to earn more than $145m which will place them in
the Top 50 grossing movies of all time. The odds are against the
majority and even some of the high-profile projects.
While You Were Sleeping proves the point. It is a ''little'' film
starring Sandra Bullock and Bill Pullman. The romantic comedy involves
Bullock's Lucy saving the life of a handsome man who falls promptly into
a coma. Enter Pullman as the man's brother and Lucy falls promptly in
love. Complications all around.
It sounds slight. It is a major box-office success. Sandra Bullock,
who drove the bus in Speed, is now asking $5m a picture.
Luck? Happenstance? No-one can tell why the sun shone so brightly on
the film. More than 50 other movies are waiting for the summer jury's
verdict. For many it will be the cinema version of capital punishment
and sentence to where the sun doesn't shine -- a little black video box.

NEWSVIEW: an exclusive interview with Yasser Arafat, warmonger turned
peacemaker.
Yasser Arafat's PLO has publicly renounced terrorism
and recognised Israel's right to exist. But violent
outrages by radical Arabs have persisted, and many
Jews have become sceptical about any further
concessions. As the prospects for peace become ever
more fragile, he talks to Paul Gendelman about
the pressures of carrying the hopes of millions.
JOGGING along the beach in Gaza, I was suddenly surrounded by a swarm
of children. They shouted and threw stones at me, as they had at Israeli
soldiers during the intifada, or uprising. One hit my back. Another
struck my neck. ''You must understand,'' an Arab friend explained later.
''They've lost their target. Now they even throw stones at each other in
school.''
Soon afterward, I spoke with Yasser Arafat in his office in a former
beach club on the Gaza waterfront. Here, the PLO chairman has set up a
mini-government, the Palestinian National Authority, with limited
self-rule in the Gaza Strip and the sleepy city of Jericho -- a small
beachhead to a future Palestinian state that is to include the West
Bank.
Arafat was wearing a khaki sweater and black-and-white Arab
head-dress, its crown folded to resemble the old map of Palestine. He
has a strong, virile presence, and there is a latent ferocity in the
face. But his 65 years lay upon him in the lined features, greying hair,
thinning beard stubble, and spreading paunch.
For millions, he is a hero -- a wily freedom fighter who, like some
other leaders of national movements, chose terror as the last resort of
the powerless. For millions of others, he is the enemy -- an
international terrorist responsible for the massacres of innocent men,
women, and children that occurred under his chairmanship of the PLO: an
American ambassador and aide riddled with bullets in Khartoum; 11
Israeli Olympians murdered in Munich; a crippled American Jew thrown
from a boat off the Syrian coast. To many, because of his past, Arafat
inspires only moral outrage and distrust.
Yet Israel decided finally to deal with this man, and other nations
were committed to trusting him. Could he be counted on?
At this moment, the Palestinian leader was very angry -- and very much
alone. He had just received an urgent call from Prime Minister Rabin. A
double-suicide bombing by Islamic militants had killed 19 Israelis --
all but one were young soldiers -- and wounded 65. Three months before,
21 civilians had been blown up on a Tel Aviv bus. Israel was in shock,
and Rabin had retaliated.
''They did it again,'' snapped Arafat. ''They closed our borders.'' He
stared angrily at me. ''Do you know what that means?''
I knew that in the Gaza Strip about 900,000 people are squeezed into
90 square miles -- while Gaza's remaining third is still occupied by
Israeli settlers and the army units guarding them. Up to 50,000 workers
would be cut off from Israeli jobs, with a $1m daily loss. Extended
closure would result in rotting produce and lost trade, increasing the
loss to $2m. And a million West Bank Palestinians would suffer similar
damages.
Arafat nursed his rage, staring at his desk. Finally, Nabil Shaath,
his senior peace negotiator, broke the silence. ''Now the peace talks
are stalled,'' he said. ''Just when we were close to a major
breakthrough.'' He noted that at the last meeting with Rabin, they had
discussed the release of 1700 of the 6000 Palestinian prisoners held by
Israel, plus the creation of a ''safe corridor'' from Gaza to Jericho
and a freeze on Israeli settlement-building in the West Bank.
''Have you understood?'' Arafat asked. ''They're bombing Israel to
destroy us. Iran is funding this. Also, the Gulf States and people in
the US are sending money to Jihad and Hamas.'' He returned to the
Israelis. ''With their army, they couldn't stop our people from throwing
stones,'' he said, recalling the 1987-94 intifada in the Gaza Strip.
''For seven years, they couldn't stop them. So now Rabin says, 'Stop
them (the Islamic martyrs) from blowing themselves up. And he closes our
borders.''
''Which only makes it worse,'' added Shaath. ''Collective punishment
harms the innocent, not the guilty ones. It only drives people to more
violence.''
That was the heart of the problem. Rabin's Cabinet, responding to the
fear and anger of the Israelis, wanted to keep the borders closed until
Arafat got control of the terrorists -- no small task. Hamas, through
its propaganda, schools, clinics, worker-factories, and extensive
welfare system, had the sympathies of a quarter of the people, most of
them living in squalid refugee camps.
''Rabin waited too long,'' Arafat said, sighing. ''Now his public has
turned on him. He has no room left to manoeuvre.''
Shaath suggested we adjourn our talk to another day. ''You can see why
the president is so upset,'' he said.
''Upset? Upset? I'm furious!'' roared Arafat, slamming the table, his
eyes red with anger, his thick, purple lips moving wordlessly. His
entire life had come to this desperate moment. He was fighting to retain
his leadership -- in effect, his life.
Today, there are about six million Palestinians. Close to five million
live in Gaza, the West Bank, Israel, and Jordan. The rest are scattered
around the world, mostly in Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, and the US. For many
of these people, Arafat's image brings visions of former homes, orange
groves, wheat-fields -- and memories of lost ones fallen in their
national struggle. But his failure to deliver on these dreams has
brought disenchantment with him.
Beneath the mock military garb and Arab head-dress, Arafat remains
hidden, equating secrecy with survival. His women, however, do somewhat
lift the veil. His wife, Suha Tawil, a Christian-born feminist (now
converted to Islam) who is 31 and half his age, said he is ''gracious,
gallant, and very amusing''. She added: ''But he's also a Leo and has to
control everything. You live in his shadow.'' It isn't a bed of roses.
At the close of a 16-hour day, he sends for her at 3am or 4am to join
him at one of several safe-houses -- their few private moments to be
enjoyed within a cordon of security guards. Their first child is due
next month.
Umm Nasser, 70, and one of five women in Arafat's life before Suha,
said Abu Ammar (his nom de guerre) was ''a very good man, gentle and
sensitive''. She added: ''He loves people, especially children.''
The love appears to have included an inculcation of hate. ''When I saw
that he was nervous and tired,'' she recalled, ''I would find a
Palestinian kid, and tell him, 'Go to Abu Ammar. He wants to give you a
Kalashnikov assault rifle to fight the Jews.' The kid would go and ask
for it, and Abu Ammar would forget his worries and smile and kiss the
child, saying, 'Look at them. They are our hope.'''
Arafat's past offers further clues to his complex personality. In a
way, Abdel Raouf Arafat al-Qudwa al-Husseini (he picked up Yasser,
meaning ''carefree'', during his student days) began life as a refugee.
Four years after his birth in Cairo, on August 4, 1929, his mother died.
His father quickly shipped him off to an uncle, Selim Abu Saoud, in
Jerusalem. One night, during the Arab revolt against the British
mandate, he watched soldiers wrecking his uncle's home: ''I'll never
forget it,'' he said.
Jerusalem is fiercely present in his dream of the Palestinian
homeland. This was evident a few days later when, on the outskirts of
Gaza, he laid a cornerstone for a Palestine Labour Union headquarters.
Arafat arrived in his bullet-proof Cadillac, flanked by wailing sirens
and a military escort. The crowd, freely mingling in an empty field,
lined up to shake his hand. From there, he took his place under a
flag-decked canopy, facing 300 seated spectators. Scores of others
watched from nearby buildings.
His speech opened routinely enough, calling upon Palestinian labourers
to join hands in building a new nation. But then he told them to keep
building until they got to Jerusalem. His voice rising, he said: ''All
of us are willing to be martyrs along the way, until our flag flies over
Jerusalem, the capital of Palestine! Let no-one think they can scare us
with weapons, for we have mightier weapons -- the weapon of faith, the
weapon of martyrdom, the weapon of Jihad!''
It was, some would say, a discourse for a larger audience. Arafat was
telling his enemies -- the Islamic Jihad and Hamas -- that he wanted
credit for any eventual release of their prisoners. He also was helping
Palestinians, wherever they might be, to keep alive their dream of
return. And he was speaking to those battle-worn comrades who had
deserted him after the Oslo and Cairo accords, insisting that he had
betrayed the revolution and waiting now to see how he would settle
scores with the Israelis.
Yet the PLO leader appeared unaware of what effect his words would
have in Israel, where Jihad and Hamas bombs had killed 67 and injured
239 in the past year, and where Jihad means ''holy war'' against Israel.
''Arafat doesn't realise that in this world you cannot have secret
talks, then declare something else in public,'' observed Dr Eyad Sarraj,
a psychiatrist who directs Gaza's community mental-health programme.
''You cannot talk about peace, then stir up violence in any way.''
Shortly after this, I joined Arafat for a late-night supper. When I
arrived, the waiting hall was packed with bankers and investors from all
over the world. The Arab boycott was fading, the Mid-East gates were
open, and everybody, it seemed, wanted a piece of the pie.
We met finally at 1.30am. Supper had been set on the conference table
in his office: soup; vegetables; cheese; pitta bread, and fruit. Arafat
doesn't smoke, and he avoids meat, coffee, and alcohol. He takes
lukewarm tea with honey, believing heat destroys vitamins. Five aides
sat with us. As my host, Arafat rose to serve me some vegetable soup.
Then he passed some poppy-seed rolls.
''From Jerusalem,'' he announced. I noticed that the skin on his arms
was turning white from loss of pigment. Oddly, it made his small hands
appear to belong to someone else.
Our talk began where it had left off. What could he do about stopping
the terrorists from blowing up all chances for peace? ''We're making
progress,'' he said.
In secret talks, both sides had agreed that Palestinian elections had
to be held as soon as possible, prior to expanding self-rule on the West
Bank. To achieve this and save the peace process, Israel would redeploy
security forces from six major urban areas. Arafat, in turn, would seek
an agreement with Hamas and Islamic Jihad to hold off their attacks:
would begin military trials against extremists and conduct arms
roundups. Further, Arafat and Rabin would anticipate next year's
negotiations on the ''permanent status'' of such critical issues as
settlements, borders, Palestinian statehood, security and, eventually,
Jerusalem.
I showed Arafat a photo: a handsome youth of 23 who had participated
in a recent suicide attack in Israel. He touched the face with one
finger. ''They distort our religion to do this, tempting these young
boys into killing themselves,'' he said sadly.
Did Arafat foresee a day when Jewish and Arab children would play
together without inherited seeds of hatred?
''I have always wanted a unified state of separate nationalities, as
in Switzerland,'' he said. An aide removed a silver menorah (the
eight-branched candelabrum, symbol of Judaism) from a cupboard and
placed it before us. Then Arafat pointed to a large picture on the wall.
It showed the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, Islam's third holiest site.
He drew a figure of the three great religions of the Holy Land in their
historical order -- the Jewish menorah rising into the Christian Cross
which in turn led to the crescent of Islam. ''This is the emblem of our
Fatah movement in the PLO,'' he explained. ''You see how the religions
should coexist?''
Between Palestinians and Jews, he said, he saw a special affinity. The
Jews were very intelligent. They were the elite. But so were his people.
''And we have the same ancestor in Abraham,'' he said, referring to the
belief of Arabic descent from Abraham's first son, Ishmael, whom he had
by Hagar -- Egyptian handmaid to his wife, Sarah.
I recalled that after the birth of Isaac, Abraham's first legitimate
son, Ishmael and his mother were driven into the desert wilderness. So
Arafat's ancestors began as refugees.
''No!'' he replied, amused. ''Abraham was also a refugee, driven out
of Ur into Canaan and Egypt. We both began that way. But for us, it's
not over yet.''
They distort our
religion to tempt
these young boys
into killing
themselves

Rennie McOwan brings together the strands of Clackmannan's many
attractions
''Oh, Alva's woods are bonny,
Tillicoultry's hills are fair,
But the bonny braes o' Menstrie,
They make my heart aye sair.''
SO said the miller's wife in the village of Menstrie, in Clackmannan
district -- her jingle comes in different versions -- when she was
spirited away by the faeries. It is understandable she was homesick
because the small grey towns and villages, the green wooded glens and
the steep southern face of the Ochils have a great appeal.
The name of the hills derives from the Celtic ''uchel'', the high
ground, and at one time the sea lapped against forest-clad slopes. The
bones of whales and other sea creatures have been found where there is
now drained farmland.
The soaring front of the Ochils excites geologists and the Ochils
Fault occasionally results in mild earth tremors which can set vases and
glasses rattling on shelves.
The old sea god, Manannan Mac Lir, was once worshipped here and the
striking Stone of Mannan, in Clackmannan village, may well take its name
from him. The cult was removed by incoming Christianity and particularly
by the shadowy Celtic saint, St Serf, the apostle of the Ochils, who may
have been more than one person.
The Hillfoots, as the quiet villages and towns between Stirling and
Alloa are known, have a special attraction of their own. I once had
bother with the staff of a London-based magazine who were convinced that
the name should be the Hillfeet and I had to send them a photograph of a
local bus with ''Alloa, via Hillfoots'' on it to persuade them of its
accuracy.
The old road at the foot of the Ochils has known the tramp of clans
people, drovers, royalty riding from Stirling Castle to the palace of
Falkland, packmen, shepherds, poets and falconers.
Sir Walter Scott liked the Ochils and brought them into some of his
poems. Robert Louis Stevenson and his family climbed Dumyat, the
prominent rocky hill at the western end of the hills (and just into old
Stirlingshire) and his mother wrote a funny poem about it. Some
authorities say he brought the peak into the map of Treasure Island.
The poet John Davidson, greatly admired by Hugh MacDiarmid, spent
holidays in the conservation village of Blairlogie -- once a spa where
people came to drink goat's milk -- and witches, warlocks and faeries
repeatedly haunted some of the glens and crags.
The old county of Clackmannanshire was once the smallest in Britain,
but had a great spirit. It took its motto, ''Look Aboot Ye'', from a
story about King Robert the Bruce losing a glove and chiding his staff.
Sheep have grazed on the Ochils from the time of Mary Queen of Scots,
and the tumbling burns turned the wheels of the mills which sprang up in
the Hillfoots communities.
Hand-loom weaving became common, then water powered mills and modern
factories took over. By the mid-nineteenth century Alva alone had ten
mills and Tillicoultry had 18. Woollens, tweeds, tartan, and serge went
from there all over the world and the weavers sometimes tramped across
the Ochils on attractive passes -- still regularly walked -- to trade
goods with the villages on the northern side.
After the 1745 Jacobite Rising failed, the wearing of tartan was
banned, but eventually the proscription was lifted and it is nowadays a
design that is almost automatically associated with Scotland.
The local authority and the tourist board have organised a Mill Trail
in the area, with a visitor centre in Glentana Mill, in the town of
Alva. The trail includes seeing a modern mill at work and listening to
the story of a little girl who worked in a mill 150 years ago and whose
daily work hours lasted from 6am until 10pm.
You can browse in a mill shop, examine local factory bargains, and
study the history of weaving and tartan which includes the machines
which changed the face of social and industrial history.
There are also plenty of other attractions. The village of Muckhart,
on the old cattle route at the east end of the hills, has been a top
award winner as Scotland's best kept small village.
Menstrie Castle is also worth visiting. It is not large and only two
rooms are open to the public, but it is a conservation success story.
When the castle had become ruinous, actor, writer and conservationist,
the late Moultrie R Kelsall, of Blairlogie, began a campaign to save it
which was taken up by the old county council and the National Trust for
Scotland. Part of the castle was turned into flats and a room
temporarily became the public library and featured the shields of the
baronets of Nova Scotia.
Sir William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling, owned the castle in the
seventeenth century and encouraged James VI to found the Order of
Baronets, a scheme devised to help the crown try and make a fortune out
of the new colony. Two rooms have now been renovated and are in the care
of the National Trust for Scotland.
At the head of the narrow and steep gorge of Dollar Glen stands Castle
Campbell, one of the Lowland homes of that clan. It was originally
called Castle Gloom, but nearby burns called Care and Sorrow are partly
near-modern inventions as names.
The castle and the glen are owned by the National Trust for Scotland
and the castle itself is in the management care of Historic Scotland. It
is one of the best of its kind. Take care on the narrow paths if you
decide to walk up the gorge. There are car parks within reasonable
striking distance.
The Mill Trail and the two castles (seasonal times change) can be
comfortably done in a day or two. Pull the threads together and enjoy
weaving the past with the present.
Menstrie (top left) not only offers peaceful gardens and a stunning
view of the Ochil hills, but there are rooms in Menstrie castle which
are well worth visiting. Tillicoutry (above right) has a welcoming
tourist office, housed in the old church tower

ALL this week (hurry while stocks last) you have the opportunity to
enjoy the fruits of several years labour at the Glasgow School of Art
Degree Show. One hundred and fifty years ago GSA was set up as a modest
design establishment geared to the needs of manufacturers.
Now it encompasses fine arts, graphics, photography, interior design,
product design, silversmithing, and ceramics. Its architecture course is
one of just two to have been categorised as excellent under the new
quality assessments.
Boldly going where nobody else in the UK has yet managed, its product
design show has been put on the Internet, already attracting several
international inquiries by phone and ''snail mail''.
Every year 600 students fight for 150 vacancies and, more unusually,
its engineering course run in conjunction with Glasgow University is
similarly over-subscribed. The campus sprawling out from the Mackintosh
building in the city centre has acquired an international reputation
because it has married creativity to relevance and enjoyed the fruits of
cross fertilisation over so many different disciplines.
And how will it celebrate this anniversary year? Almost certainly by
having to make some of its core staff redundant. And the reasons lie in
the systematic rape of our higher education system -- a crime not just
perpetrated against institutions like our art schools, but felt
especially keenly by them given the lack of elasticity in their budgets.
It's three years now since the Further and Higher Education Act put 21
of Scotland's higher education institutions under the fiscal control of
a quango. Most universities and colleges accept that the the people
charged with running the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council are
not the guys in the black hats. They don't feel inclined to shoot the
Government's messengers. But they profoundly resent the message.
Because at one and the same time the Government seems to be saying
that it wants to open up further education to more students, yet is
driving down the amount of money to be spent on educating them, and
giving applicants minimal financial support and incentive.
At no extra charge the academic staff are sinking under a sea of new
administrative burdens. Or, in the words of Dugald Cameron, GSAUs feisty
director, they're being ''audited to death and assessed to a
standstill''. Interestingly this obsession with fiscal accountability is
just a one-way street. While the teaching bodies have to count every
paper clip and microchip, the Government gives no reason for demanding
annual ''efficiency gains'' of around 3%.
That is because they have not attempted to detect any inefficiency.
They just want to make a funding cut and ''efficiency gain'' has a
rather more friendly semantic ring to it.
At least it does if you're not on the wrong end of one of them.
Because over the past few years these ''gains'' have meant cuts of
around a quarter of the previous budget.
Last year the Government demanded a 2% cut, this year it's 3%, next
year it's 2.5%, and the year after that over 3.5%.
Meanwhile the money still available for teaching (you remember
teaching, it's what academics used to do before they metamorphosed into
administrators and fund raisers) has been further eroded by adding other
financial burdens to the equations.
To go back to our art school example. The Treasury used to pick up the
tab for insurance. Now it doesn't. The Education Department used to be
responsible for essential repairs. Now it isn't. The school didn't used
to be responsible for any capital building or purchase costs. Now it is.
The funding council used to pay the validation fees. That support has
been withdrawn.
And so it goes on. And the scope for cuts in an institution where 72%
of the budget goes on staff costs is not wide. Neither is that staff
exactly mollycoddled in the finance department. Their current pay award
runs at less than inflation which means they can look forward this
coming year to less money for more work.
Neither is the type of teaching done in our art schools the kind which
can be made more economical by throwing fewer staff at more and more
students.
So many of the skills acquired by our art school graduates are of
necessity the product of one-to-one tuition. You can't give a lecture
about how to throw a pot.
The awful irony of this dilution of our once much-vaunted higher
education system is that the system has willingly responded to the
imperatives of the market-place. Go to any of our universities or
technical colleges and you will find precisely that synergy with
business and industry which the Government has urged upon them.
There is no failure to be relevant, no room for self-indulgence. But
if we continue to drive down the cost which these institutions can spend
on each student then the bleak corollary is a driving down of standards.
If we force universities to make ever more frenzied pitches for
overseas students and distance-learning degree packages then we risk
excellence being sacrificed for fees. Similarly the acute financial need
to keep indigenous students on board for four years is bound
psychologically to affect assessment of their work.
What is happening to Scottish education at tertiary level is little
short of vandalism.
And it is being perpetrated on the back of a totally false economy.
Education is not an oncost; it is the most vital investment any
Government can make in future prosperity. And the reputation of a
country for providing a decent education, like most things in life, is
very much easier to destroy than to rebuild.

PERHAPS one reason why the French regularly render themselves so
objectionable is that, for much of the past two centuries, they have
been pretty much of a failure as a nation.
Their monarchy collapsed in revolution. The greatest figure thrown up
by that cataclysm, Napoleon, led them to defeat. There were further
revolutions, then a second -- absolutely humiliating -- defeat in 1870.
Victory against the same enemy came in 1918, but at a cost that made it
scarcely better than defeat. And yet another defeat was on the way, but
in the meantime victory improved scarcely anything, as is well
illustrated in this excellent new book by Eugen Weber, who has made a
specialism of this sorry period, among others.
These were hollow years in several senses; hollow because they only
filled a gap between two disastrous wars, hollow because they seemed in
themselves so lacking in significance and direction. What was the
country for? Where was it going?
France's rivals as great powers on the European continent -- Germany,
Italy, even Russia -- thought they had the answer to such questions. Her
rivals beyond it, Britain and the United States, felt less certain,
though they were never as completely dispirited as France. Their
complacent assumptions were caught short by the Depression, but they set
to with some energy to get themselves out of it.
There was nothing similar to bring France to her senses. Much less
developed industrially, she did not suffer the same crash in 1929. By
the same token, she did not benefit from its shock value. Her
unemployment rose as her trade with stricken countries fell, yet there
was no urgent search for solutions, and little enough sense of any
political responsibility for finding them. Weber remarks acidly that
French politicians did not enter the twentieth century till the 1950s or
1960s.
He is concerned not so much with comparisons as with finding out what
was rotten in the state of France. This offers his readers a varied and
colourful, if unappetising, repast. There was scarcely a fertile or
flourishing field of the country's life: barren decay meets his gaze on
every hand. The nation seemed almost to be preparing to make its defeat
explicit in 1940.
When we look at France's smiling landscapes today, we may find it
difficult to conceive what a place of physical squalor it was little
more than half a century ago. French cities had their slums, like every
city, and the misery that went with them. But it was hardly better in
the countryside, where many peasants still eked out an almost
unimaginably primitive existence.
Amid all this there were stark contrasts. Weber's book has striking
photographs, one series showing the plutocrats at play. His caption
reads: ''The rich are seldom richer than when the poor are poor -- at
least visibly. They gathered at garden parties, whose informality looks
very relative; for late evening drinks or dinners providing
opportunities to show off bodies, gowns, and evening wear as sleek as
money could buy; and at functions like the annual competitions of
automobile elegance, where beauties and their pets teamed up with their
pets to demonstrate stylish wealth.''
The whole naturally made for extreme social tensions. In 1934, Paris
saw riots at least as severe as those of 1968. They followed the affair
of Serge Stavisky, a swindler of uncertain origin caught embezzling the
municipal funds of Bayonne. His subsequent death was officially
described as a suicide, but many suspected that the police had not
balked at murdering a friendless crook.
The scandal broke just as, on February 6, one of the interminable
series of weak governments was being formed under Edouard Daladier,
something of a progressive. ''Two hundred families are masters of the
French economy and, in fact, of French politics. These are forces that a
democratic state should not tolerate,'' he had declared.
That could not save him now, as a provincial affair brought the
country's troubles to a head. Communists descended on the Place de la
Concorde to make their views forcefully known to the National Assembly
on the other side of the Seine. Fascist and royalist thugs arrived in
their wake, along with old soldiers protesting at cuts in their pensions
and ''down-at-heel taxpayers''. A pitched battle broke out; 15 were
killed and more than 1500 wounded.
Daladier, having just been voted into office, promptly resigned. His
thickset build had won him a nickname, the Bull of the Vaucluse, but he
was, in one of Weber's happy phrases ''a bull with the horns of a
snail''. Yet he could also be counted among France's more upright public
figures, a man of the people, a war veteran and conspicuously honest.
One may well imagine what the rest were like.
What could be done? Weber's overall message, delivered at once with
nice irony and unsparing perception, is that nothing could be done. This
was a society hopelessly sunk in corruption and incompetence, its
burdens unfair, its rewards unjust, every reform blocked by vested
interests and political fecklessness. Hardly anybody wanted to defend
it.
Frenchmen's travails had made them hate foreigners: Jews and
immigrants were abused, often physically, with little less virulence
than in the countries that went fascist. In the end they preferred to
submit to a conqueror's yoke rather than sort themselves out. Some did
fight bravely in 1940; others just marched into German captivity.
All this may help us to understand a little more clearly the
less-pleasant traits of Frenchmen that we can observe even now. We still
see the egotism, the incessant, ruthless, calculating concentration on
Number One, exactly reflected at a political level in France's
no-less-cynical pursuit of her own interests, the more offensive when
dressed up in abstract rhetorical persiflage.
Yet perhaps the origin of these traits lies in a deep historical sense
of inferiority. Nowadays, amid the evasions and repressions steadily
coming to light, it is less easy to believe that France fully purged
herself through the resistance and liberation of 1944. In fact, the 10
years after the war were not much better than the 10 years before it.
The real difference was made by General de Gaulle's second and third
presidencies, and to some extent by the Gaullist movement he created
(now back in power after a long time in the wilderness).
The general was no less an egotist than the rest of his countrymen
but, seeing France incarnated in himself, he could elevate that egotism
into a great principle which put France first. ''Toute ma vie je me suis
fait une certain idee de la France,'' is certainly an egotistical
statement; yet it at last gave Frenchmen something to be believe in, and
France's friends something to admire.
Jacques Chirac's prompt explosion of a nuclear bomb in the Pacific
serves notice that the lesson has not been forgotten. Neighbours would
do well to mark that in him France remains determined to preserve her
independence. At any rate, none of this could have happened in the
hollow years.

THIRTY-THREE years after his previous Glasgow visit, Ramblin' Jack
Elliott returned to a hero's welcome, if not a standing-room only one.
Wearing his trademark stetson -- its brim so wide his face was
constantly in shadow, he instantly reminded us that he not only knew the
writers of those old songs, he was often around when they were written.
Jesse Fuller's San Francisco Bay Blues prompted some mischief about
Jack influencing Paul McCartney and Eric Clapton -- to copy his
mistakes. And Woody Guthrie's Buffalo Skinners was prefaced by a tale
about his son Arlo's passion for throwing toys at a sleeping Jack.
Every song Jack sang, and the explanation behind it, could have been a
chapter out of his life story. Some of them could have been whole books.
But although a dozen songs in 75 minutes might suggest that Ramblin'
Jack was verbally living up to his nickname, it would be churlish to
complain.
It would be a churl also who criticised Jack's singing. Forget
technique; this is about getting the narrative, the feeling, the
atmosphere across. His guitar picking had its moments of relaxed
clarity, too.
He has a lovely dry wit, best summed up by the story of a promoter,
irate at Jack phoning to say he'd be late, ''asking my advice'' on what
to do with a hall full of people. An entertaining evening with a man
who, if not at the cutting edge can still cut it, was topped by a word
and accent-perfect I Belong Tae Glasgow. Does that mean that, through
Jack, Will Fyffe influenced Bob Dylan et al? Surely not!

MIDSUMMER past and the nichts will fairly be drawin' in again already.
The year's on the turn and where's the summer?
I have had the sprayer full for six days to spray the setaside and it
has rained on each day. Now it is fair but it is far too windy to spray
weedkiller, especially as one field is right next to a row of houses.
I once let some of that drift into a row of very fancy gardens and I
don't want to do that again. It was no good telling them that the
round-up wasn't a persistent chemical, or that the roses looked quite
attractive with all those little brown holes on the petals, or that the
lettuces wouldn't actually be poisonous just because they were a bit
burned.
In fact, my neighbours were very reasonable about it though you
couldn't say they were pleased. Another time and they might not be so
understanding.
So there is a change of plan. I am going for the head-spray on the
winter barley first.
Despite the cold and sunless weather the barley could be a
most-rewarding crop again this year. And not least of that success could
be the straw, that by-product that some among us used to harvest with a
matchbox.
Last year's straw was worth up to #100 and more per acre and looks
good for this year again. All that rain having upset the timing of the
straw-shortener will mean more straw. Mine is almost up to my chest and
I have to put the sprayer booms full up to get the head-spray on.
And the demand for feeding straw is bound to be high again. You see
the first cut of silage in the North-east has been a disaster. It is set
and it is light. Brace yourself, banker.
But this long straw will only be a bonus if we get it safely at
harvest time and the Red Rooster has already got 30 acres flat. He made
the mistake of asking Mossie what the problem would be. Why had his
barley gone flat?
''Management,'' said Mossie without a moment's hesitation. It really
is a wonder he has any teeth left.
And Mossie's been diversifying again. The yellowhammers having made
off with nearly all his sunflowers, our man has invested in a most
extravagant toy.
It is a Starshot, which is an imaginative variation of clay pigeon
shooting. It is favoured by those who have acquired all the gear for
shooting clays and have then got fed up shooting them (a very easy thing
to do).
Starshot is like an enormous dartboard in the sky, or to be more
precise, half a dartboard. Clays come flying skyward out of the
bulls-eye and the shooter has to hit them when they are opposite certain
areas of the board.
The shooter shouts ''pull'' and a clay pigeon comes winging out of the
bull and proceeds skywards. The shooter has to wait until it is in the
area valued at one point and then, if he hits it he gets a point. Then
he shouts ''pull'' again and this time he has to shoot when it is in the
area worth two points. It gets progressively more difficult until, for
12 points, you've got to fire as you shout ''pull''.
The 50ft monster is mounted on a trailer and Mossie's idea is that his
poor son will pay his way through university by taking the Starshot to
the shows. It looks as though it could maybe pay Mossie through the
university, too (though that would be a bit of a waste) for, at the Game
Fair at Straloch at the weekend, they were queuing all the two days at
#3 a time.
''Mind you, I need it aa,'' says Mossie.
And it is a big investment, including the little plywood hut behind
which, but in direct line of fire, sit two lads who have to keep loading
new clays into the traps. ''Are you sure that's safe,'' asked the Red
Rooster when they were setting the Starshot up?
''I dinna ken but let's find oot. Stand back.'' With that, Mossie let
the back of the shed have it with both barrels. It made a lovely pattern
but it was thought wise to clad the plywood with a sheet of 3mm steel.
It was in the further interests of safety that our man was so grudging
about the young lad who appeared at the head of the queue. He looked
nine but might have been small for his age. A wiser man might have said
he was too young and left it at that but Mossie doesn't like to refuse
anybody's money. ''Can ye shoot? De ye ken what to dae? Haud the gun
tight to your shoulder. Watch and nae hit onybody!''
''Aye, aye, aye,'' said the wee boy. ''Pull,'' bang! ''Pull'', bang!
''Pull'', bang! and the top row was demolished. When he got three of the
more difficult second row, Mossie was embarrassed. ''That's the last
time I'll ask onybody if they can shoot,'' he said.
Three pounds every four minutes looks good but that is only a start.
You see the Starshot is the most unstable affair reaching as it does far
into the sky. It has to be tied down.
And that's another financial opportunity for our man.
He sells the right to let him have a lorry to attach to the wire rope
to support his dartboard. His victims were Nicol from Keith and Butcher
Bain who each lent him about #60,000 worth of artic. The last I saw they
were still arguing the price.
''Fantaastic value at a thoosand pound a piece,'' was Mossie's
valuation. There was much room left for negotiation for the boys thought
he'd done well to get all that plant for nothing, but just to shut him
up they were willing to go to #100 between them.

MATINEES and mixed bills are, I reckon, useful indicators of a
company's strengths and weaknesses. If, like London City Ballet, you
have a clutch of up-and-coming young soloists -- and eager, able bodies
in your corp de ballet -- then an afternoon programme of shorts provides
extra opportunities for them to share centre stage with established
principals and outshine them if possible!
If, however, like London City Ballet, you have a fairly small company
-- a mere 35, as listed in the brochure -- then such matinees can test
your resources almost to breaking point, especially when injuries force
last-minute cast changes as they did on Saturday. Mind you, LCB seem
determined to thrive on adversity.
The matinee turned out to be a real, and happy, reminder of the
pleasures to be had from seeing mainstream repertoire presented in an
honest, straightforward, and caringly conscientious way. My initial
regard for Tracey Newham Alvey's exquisite Odette -- the programme
opened with Swan Lake Act II -- was immeasurably heightened by her
consummate composure after a hapless swan clattered to the ground in a
dead faint. She has superbly long, expressive arms, an ethereal quality
that catches the very nature of Odette's enchanted being.
Company numbers somewhat sadly curtailed the effectiveness of ensemble
symmetries, but at least there's no missing the graceful rigour of those
swans who do materialise. They really are hearteningly well-rehearsed.
Other delights? The merry rendering of Ashton's Tweedle Dum and
Tweedle Dee (Simon Smith and Darren Panton) and the equally bright
revival of Lichine's Graduation Ball -- lovely touches of humour (Emma
Hyatt) and a breathtakingly evocative cameo of pure Romanticism with
Elizabeth Josey and Gregory Gage as the Sylph and the Scotsman.
Added to these were some sparkly executed pas de deux, making in all a
thoroughly entertaining programme that would not have disgraced a gala
first night: LCB really do deserve support to enable them to extend and
develop the existing company and its repertoire.

OCCASIONALLY a snatch of overheard conversation gives a snapshot of
someone else's life. Thus it was on Saturday morning as I entered the
Royal Highland Showground at Ingliston.
Ahead of me were the players in this little domestic drama, whose
lines were as follows: Wife -- (somewhat sharply) -- ''Is it sore
then?''
Husband (resignedly) -- ''Well, I wouldna' be limping if it wasna'
sore.''
Not wishing to intrude in an obviously private conversation I
quickened my pace and left them behind.
Later, as the temperatures soared and even the strongest men finally
gave in and shed their jackets I wondered how that couple were getting
on. Were they still there?
That will be one memory of the 1995 Highland Show.
Early on the first day I saw suction revivers on offer but by
yesterday morning, when that kind of kit might have been useful, I swear
the stall had moved.
This year's show will surely be remembered, above all, for the weather
-- said by some to be the best since 1949. There can have been be few
other years in which outside events conspired quite so much to
overshadow what was happening at Ingliston.
First there was the Brussels agreement on new rules for animal
transport and then, later that same day, the announcement that the Prime
Minister had stepped down as Conservative leader.
The following day Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd announced that he was
retiring. By the time our own Agriculture Minister, Sir Hector Monro
arrived on the scene there was speculation that he must be standing by
for a call from Downing Street to step up into the Cabinet.
The Tesco supermarket group had good cause to regret the timing of Mr
Hurd's resignation. They had chosen to stage a food conference at
Heriot-Watt University to coincide with the show aimed at ''anyone who
has an interest in farming and the role of the food industry.''
On top of the competition from the Highland Show they had to cope with
the fact that many of the journalists who turned up at the conference
were more interested in getting reaction on Mr Hurd's resignation from
the principal speakers -- Alex Salmond of the SNP, Labour's George
Robertson, and the Liberal Democrats' Jim Wallace.
The Scottish Agricultural Organisation Society -- an umbrella body for
Scotland's co-operatives -- remains convinced of the importance of the
co-operative principle, especially for milk producers.
James Graham, projects director with SAOS, said it was absolutely
essential for milk producers to retain their ability to market their
produce collectively.
If they lost that bargaining counter each producer would become a
small individual business pitched against the buying power of the large
national and multi-national businesses, he said.

THE principal attraction during the weekend in the livestock judging
was the Inter Breed competitions which led to the selection of the
overall champions in the beef, dairy and sheep sections, writes DAN
BUGLASS.
A larger than normal crowd congregated to view the former Scotland
rugby stalwart John Jeffrey in the beef ring where he cast his expert
eye over no less than 13 teams comprised of four of the best from each
special beef breed.
These teams were first reduced to a short leet of seven which the
judge then proceeded to place in reverse order with the Galloway team
standing third, the much-favoured Charolais in second spot, while the
Simmentals took the top award -- The Royal Bank of Scotland trophy.
The final task for Mr Jeffrey was to choose the best beef animal in
the show from the long list of champions.
It came down in due course to a straight choice between James Biggar's
Beef Shorthorn bull Tofts, and Tofts Romany, and the five
year-old-Simmental cow, Tillylair Angela, from Robert Crawford,
Tillylair, Lumphanan, Aberdeenshire.
To no one's surprise, the cow came out on top to give a special
birthday present to the Simmental Society, which this year is
celebrating its 25th anniversary.
Mr Jeffrey said: ''She's a superb cow who struck me right from the
start. I would love to have one like that at home. She's smooth-fleshed
and can walk, but it was good to see the size back in the Shorthorns.''
A delighted Robert Crawford, who has been in the breed since the first
importation, said: ''I'm just over the moon -- this is a lifetime's
ambition.''
In the neighbouring dairy ring, the competition was equally close but
the judge Jim Lawrie, from Kinross, showed a little hesitation in opting
for the six-yar-old Holstien Friesian cow, Adamdale Starbuck Mag, from
John Loftus, Preese Hall, Kirkham, Preston, as the best in the show and
the winner of the Queen's Cup ahead of the Jersey champion from Robert
Graham, Airthrey Carse, Stirling.
Describing his champion which in her last lactation gave over 11,000
litres, Mr Lawrie said: ''She's an outstanding cow, sharp and good on
her legs with excellent teat placing.''
In the team competition the Ayrshire's led the way in front of the
Holstein Friesians.
The sheep Inter Breed title went to a two-shear Suffolk ram --
Stockton Ace -- from John Sinnett, Stockton Court, Worcester.

THE trouble with concert programming for most Viennese Evenings is
that, in drawing too heavily on the music of the Strauss dynasty and
their contemporaries, the musical palate becomes satiated and exhausted
-- far too much of the same thing: too sweet, too cloying, like eating
one portion too many of one of those extremely rich Viennese cakes.
The Royal SNO Prom on Saturday, conducted by James Loughran and given
before a near-capacity audience, successfully avoided this tendency by
taking a broader view of Vienna and confining the confection to the
second half. Not that the first half contained exclusively red meat.
Each of the openers, Emil Reznieck's Donna Diana (one of those pieces
with an unfamiliar name and a very well-known tune), and the Entr'acte
from Schubert's Rosamunde, featured -- at radically different speeds --
its own charm, a charm heightened by the urbane, sophisticated delivery
characteristic of James Loughran's style.
The meat -- though that's a bit crude -- in the programme was Mozart's
great A major Piano Concerto, with young British pianist Julian Evans as
soloist. Evans has an aimiable and unpretentious manner with the
concerto, coupled with some elegant phrasing. He marred his own style
however by an over-reliance on the pedals for expressive effect. On the
one hand -- foot -- this blurred melodic lines, while on the other it
muffled the bass. It's a cheat; too obvious; didn't work.
Thereafter it was into a string of Straussian perennials which --
though they should have fizzed like champagne -- were a wee bit formal,
enlivened by the occasional outbursts of orchestrated anarchy (throat
clearing, stamping, singing) from within the ranks. Went down well,
though.

IT was probably just as well that a TV repeat of War of The Worlds
delayed this incongruous package of cross-generational rock.
It did take some acclimatisation: both Lindley's
explosion-in-an-acid-factory outfit and the 13 guitars stacked on stage
were as far removed from the rock'n 'roll excess of Glastonbury as you
could get. This was an all-seated (on-and-off stage), low-key affair. In
short, virtuoso busking.
For two men whose greatest triumphs have been in film soundtracks and
on the periphery of West Coast rock respectively, it was difficult to
preconceive how it would sound and whether it would make an engaging
spectacle.
Ultimately it just about truimphed, but the sheer eclecticism served
as both the show's great strength and weakness. Covering folk, blues,
country, and world-music styles on a variety of guitars and other
stringed instruments made for an erratic hotch-potch of styles.
A cover of Woody Guthrie's Vigilante Man highlighted the triumph of
the playing over the paucity of the voices: Cooder's the more
interesting, Lindley's the more prominent.
With Cooder's son Joachim already on stage, salvation came in the form
of Lindley's sibling Roseanne, whose soaring vocals and harmonies added
a much-needed vivaciousness to the latter part of the show.
If it was more workmanlike than inspired then there were still some
sublime moments, usually when they tackled a great song like Doc Pomus'
Little Sister, Merle Haggard's The Highway Is My Home and Warren Zevon's
Play It All Night Long or when Lindley junior's voice carried the likes
of How Can A Poor Man Stand Such Times.
This was serious musicians at work: at times overbearing but always
admirable and occasionally beautiful.

BRITAIN'S biggest supermarket group, Sainsbury, yesterday hit back at
suggestions that it will be blocked from expanding into Northern
Ireland. Sainsbury wants to invest #100m in the province, creating 2000
jobs over the next couple of years.
There have been suggestions that local stores in Northern Ireland are
mounting a campaign to foil Sainsbury with protracted planning appeals.
''Clearly we are confident. We are expecting our applications to go
through,'' a spokesman for Sainsbury said.
''We are not aware of any applications for retail use having been
already refused,'' a Sainsbury spokeswoman said over plans for seven new
store sites. ''We have asked no favours and have been given no
favours,'' she added.
Wellworth, one of the existing biggest stores in the province, is
thought to be hostile to Sainsbury moving into its trading territory.
One of Sainsbury's sites at Ballymena has been promoted by the town
council and so will not be subject to planning. A second, at
Sprucefield, is next to existing Marks &amp; Spencer and a Texas DIY stores.
At Londonderry, there have been no previous applications and at
another site in Tillysburn the only use was industrial in the past. At
the Newtonbreda site, plans are said to be at an advanced stage. Two
other store locations have not yet been identified, the spokeswoman
said.
When Sainsbury unveiled expansion aims last week chairman David
Sainsbury said: ''The current political situation takes away away the
security worries. Northern Ireland was the obvious next stage in our
development. We got into North-east England in the last 1980s, Scotland,
and Cornwall in the early 1990s.''
Faced with increased competition from its arch rival Tesco in England
and Scotland, Sainsbury is keen to expand its supermarket business into
new geographic areas.

David Belcher argues that a new book fails to explain the role of
women in 70 years of popular music
SEASONED rock scribe Lucy O'Brien has set herself a vastly ambitious
task with her new book, She Bop, which bills itself as ''the definitive
history of women in rock, pop and soul''.
What are her qualifications for attempting to document, analyse, and
explain more than 70 years of disparate popular music, united by their
having sprung from a female source?
Having worked full-time for the New Musical Express for a number of
years in the eighties, O'Brien brings a wealth of journalistic
experience, as well as a goodly number of interview transcriptions with
her as she seeks to cover the length and breadth of the waterfront from
Paula Abdul to X-ray Spex, Tina Turner to Doris Day, Phranc to Madonna,
Ma Rainey to Peggy Seeger and Angelique Kidjo.
Capable of wielding a feminist critique with insight and aplomb, she
additionally brings a powerful and incisive urge to confront the
undoubted inequalities of gender politics which more greatly affect
women in the music business than they do men.
Because the pop music business is one which, in being uniquely based
on raw sex-appeal, always views women performers in the shadows cast by
what, according to O'Brien, Suzanne Vega has called ''The Cleavage
Factor''. A male-dominated business which sees the female record-buying
public as the most passive of passive consumers, compliant cash-cows
waiting to be milked by the next set of male heart-throbs off the pop
conveyor-belt.
So how well does O'Brien address the issues on her socio-political
agenda? Not quite persuasively enough that she's going to win any
unconverted floating voters, unfortunately. Take She Bop's chapter on
Madonna, which bravely addresses a central feminist conundrum -- how can
it be possible to wring your hands in an all-encompassing lament over
women's sexploitation and at the same time laud other women for
successfully sexploiting themselves? -- but then fails to resolve it.
Tellingly, O'Brien fudges her own verdict on Madonna and the
implications of Ms Ciccone's once-successful sex-based sales strategy.
''As the various wannabes in her wake found out, there is a thin line
between provocation and pandering'' comes across as a pretty limp,
non-judgmental resume to me.
At least O'Brien counter-balances this excess of neutrality to some
extent by flying the flag for Cyndi Lauper. As O'Brien rightly points
out, Cyndi Lauper pioneered song-topics and stage-imagery which Madonna
took years to discover. Lauper also provided O'Brien's book with its
title, She Bop being a minor hit which addressed the subject of female
masturbation six years before the idea occurred to Madonna as just
another soft-porn video-promo scam to shift more album-units.
But sadly it's in the self-same Madonna chapter that the most damning
evidence of the book's failure is plain: here is a work which is too
often skimpy, episodic, and written in the po-faced, purple prose of a
sixth-form sociology student.
Read the following gullible gush and weep for Barbara Cartland's
forthcoming assumption of a job on the NME: ''The new colour of
(Madonna's) hair spoke volumes; growing out the blond to become dark
reflected an inner tension and the surfacing of brooding emotion. The
break-up with Sean Penn devastated her, but from that trough and loss of
control there emerged a nascent, human, artistic self.''
To which one can only mutter a sceptical ''Oh aye?'' The same phrase
applies to ''working-class Glaswegian'' Sheena Easton, who crops up with
tragi-comic brevity two pages later, getting stroppy with O'Brien,
mistaking one of the latter's questions for an enquiry as to whether oor
wee Sheena had slept with her mid-eighties song-collaborator Prince. As
if, hen -- to employ another quizzical Glaswegian colloquialism.
But why is Easton present at all, along with a great many other justly
unsung figures? In her quest for definition, O'Brien blurs the view with
needless detail, too many baseless assertions, and a stultifying
humourlessness.
The latter two deadly traits unite in one memorable phrase: ''Women
didn't fully investigate the false phallus in pop until the cultural
mix-up of the eighties.'' Whit? Ultimately, this is a history which
doesn't tell a her-story, music's story, anyone's story.

Juan Les Pins, Sunday
THIS column is all about what John Major called the fault line which
runs through Europe. The Cote D'Azur, where the EU summit begins today
is as agreeable a place as any to examine it. Timely, too, for reasons
to be explained. Over the years your overworked correspondent has been
around a bit, usually at other people's expense -- which is always the
best way. This has brought much good company and conversation -- witness
the dateline above -- but has also involved writing about the world's
horrors which reporters must cover.
Famines and wars in Africa, Bloody Sunday and assorted battles in
Ulster, major disasters (from Cheapside Street to Piper Alpha),
political assassinations, coups and scandals -- all of the daily mayhem
which keeps us journalists in gainful employment. I have seen my share,
I suppose. But I had never experienced an earthquake. (Come to that I
never expected Greenock-style rain, thunder, and lightning on the French
Riviera, but there you go.)
Reporting earthquakes from a safe distance is easy, of course. In East
Africa many years ago I covered several -- from a telephone in the
comfort of a newsroom miles away in Nairobi. Later, in Tashkent in
Uzbekistan, which can claim to be the earthquake capital of the world, I
had an insight into how terrible the force of nature can be.
There is an unforgettable sculpture there which commemorates one of
the worst earthquakes in history -- an expressive but grisly piece of
work which is no more than a rock with the fault preserved in it for all
time. But from the depths of the crack reaches a haunting, helpless,
hand.
In that earthquake in 1966 the death toll was mercifully small, but
the entire city was destroyed in a few seconds. Even the mechanism for
measuring the force of the movement on the Richter scale was destroyed.
It was the sort of catastrophe which makes you reflect there is much to
be said for living in a temperate climate, despite the rain. (In
Tashkent the temperature routinely hits 50 degrees Centigrade at the
height of summer, which is no fun.)
My record of earthquake-dodging lasted until precisely 3.55am last
Tuesday. I was fast asleep in the Brussels flat when the bedroom began
shaking. It was an extraordinary experience. As the bed started to tap
dance, the commotion even woke herself, who usually needs to be kicked
awake.
We could hear rumbling sounds and cutlery rattling in the next room.
It was scary to remember we were on the fourth floor of a block of flats
built long before those fancy floating mechanisms were invented for
buildings in earthquake-prone areas (which don't appear to work if the
recent Kobe experience is anything to go by).
This was worth 4.5 to Richter, we learned next day, but no-one was
hurt because the epicentre had been 23 kilometers below the Mons, in
southern Belgium. Even so, it was enough to damage buildings and give a
rude awakening to most people in Belgium and parts of Netherlands,
Germany, and France. Later that morning it was the sole topic of
conversation along with predictable questions like: ''Did the earth move
for you last night?''
And so to Cannes, and earthquakes of the political kind, as produced
by Mr Major on Thursday, which has brought sudden interest to this
otherwise unchallenging summit by the beach.
Mr Major is correct when he describes the British Government's
difficulties with the European Union as a political fault line. He now
recognises that the after-shocks will kill his Government and party
unless he does something now. Margaret Thatcher's going showed the
future.
Europe understands from her experience what Major is up against. His
sotto voci aside to Chancellor Kohl that he runs a coalition in
Westminster came as no surprise to eavesdroppers. What has caused most
headshaking is his appeasement of the Eurosceptics in the party and his
apparent willingness to establish Britain as an offshore adjunct of the
European Union. No-one in Europe wants this. Douglas Hurd certainly did
not. We forget sometimes that only the federalist fanatics really want
EU members pitchforked into a superstate, and in Brussels the zealots
are equal in proportion to Tory Eurosceptics. In other words, they fuss
and fiddle but make noise beyond their numbers.
It is, as ever, all a matter of interpretation. Federalism to a
Belgian or a German is just commonsense co-operation and
decentralisation. You will be hard pushed to find anyone who seriously
believes that a more unified Europe automatically means the end of
national self-determination for Germany or Netherlands.
So why Britain? Now that Mr Major has decided to stand and fight --
and he should have done so long ago -- it will be instructive to see how
much he has really changed from the days when he saw Britain ''at the
heart of Europe''. His choice of new Foreign Secretary should speak
volumes.
This summit, some diplomats believe, will be dull, because the really
big issues are for later this year and next, when a British General
Election will be closer. Already the EU looks like helping Mr Major's
fightback, having admitted that the next move to single currency must
probably be delayed until 1999. This means the Tories can fudge the
issue beyond the election.
Mr Major is desperate to get close to the French, his potential allies
in areas ranging from defence (Bosnia is the best current example) to
voting in the council. He wants to build British-French solidarity to
resist the German-Benelux push for closer union.
So far Mr Chirac has told Mr Major everything he wants to hear on
issues such as the veto and the single currency. The trouble is, he has
done much the same with Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn.
After narrowly winning an election by pledging to make Europe work for
more jobs, Mr Chirac will be anxious to make his late appearance at the
centre of the European stage voter-friendly at home. A French
initiative, suitably doctored for domestic consumption, could be coming.
Mr Major would go along with that, preferring to leave tougher talking
for another day. He has, after all, got plenty on his mind just for the
moment.
Me? I just want the Riviera weather to pick up.

THE only economic statistics this week are due today. The national
accounts for the first quarter are expected to confirm that gross
domestic product grew by 0.7%, after 0.8% in the final quarter of last
year.
In April, the Central Statistical Office provisionally estimated
growth of 0.8% in the first quarter, with the National Lottery
contributing 0.1%.
But last month this was revised down to 0.7%, providing partial
justification for the decision by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to
rebuff the Governor of the Bank of England over interest rates.
The other statistic today covers the balance of payments in the first
quarter. Economists at James Capel are forecasting a current account
surplus of #1000m, made up of visible deficit of #2000m and an
invisibles surplus of #3000m.
But invisibles figures are notoriously erratic and consequently
extremely difficult to forecast.

Anvar Khanpops out for a flutter at a Glasgow bingo hall, and
discovers that the game is very much in the blood, passed down the
generations, and an integral part of the social fabric
Local bingo halls have a stake in the welfare of their members
EN ROUTE to the Paramount Bingo complex in Possilpark, Glasgow, my
taxi-driver averred: ''They'll be swapping drugs in the toilet.'' A
cynical young gitwho obviously regards any building in a deprived area
as a much-needed venue for a fix.
Bingo is ahead of the two biggest religions in this country. In terms
of weekly support, it exceeds five times the attendances of all football
matches. Like the Church and football clubs, bingo doesn't advertise. It
can't. Bingo is legally restricted, unlike the Pools, which can now
advertise on TV. But its halls are havens from a nasty world, which
accounts for the high number of elderly women who play. Any person who
drinks to excess at the bar or is under the influence of drugs, is asked
to leave at the management's discretion.
Bingo halls also work to the budget of their customers. It is not
physically possible to spend more than #15 a night on books. On food and
drink, maybe. But even then, the price of fish, chips, peas and a coffee
is only #1.65. No. Bingo is cheap. Casinos and bookies want your
life-savings, but bingo just wants your custom. This a shrewd move, and
indeed, the only way the majors, such as Rank and Mecca, have survived
for so long without the democratic option of being able to sell
themselves through the media.
If bingo isn't in your family, it won't be in your blood. The urge to
play travels by osmosis through each generation, and, like in-breeding,
the practice remains undiluted by outsiders. In bingo you can gamble
within your means. This is Socialist fun -- no-one is ripped off. But,
given their clientele, the Bingo Association of Great Britain can't
afford to be anything else. Bingo halls can't price themselves out of
the pockets of their only market.
Local bingo halls have a stake in the welfare of their members. They
practise care in the community. The Paramount, for example, is holding a
charity cabaret next week to help a wee boy from Kilmarnock get over his
cancer. But playing bingo is a commitment. Bingo is the Miss Jean Brodie
of the working class. Give the game a girl at an impressionable age and
she's theirs for life.
If you live in Glasgow long enough, the missing roofs of the boarded
up blocks in Possil actually begin to add character to its red blaze
wastelands. At 6pm Possil has a sun-dried stillness. No-one is coming
back from work, because most don't have any. But the Paramount car park
is full. Its customers seem to be a dwindling population, militant in
their defiance of a bad area, with enough life left in them to venture
outside.
The comparison between the calibre of the bingo complex and local
housing is too much of a cliche to even go into. From the outside, the
Paramount looks like a fifties-style Las Vegas drive-in pool emporium.
Inside there is air-conditioning, deep carpeting, and the pink and
pastel blue seats and cream tables are a measured, corporate distance
from each other, to provide deluxe elbow room.
The Paramount bingo complex is a ''state-of-the-art'' club, specially
built, complete with a food bar, a ''puggy'' pit, and a substantial
non-smoking area. It opened in 1993 and has a membership of 46,000.
There's a card game section too, where some of the women who make up the
80% of bingo-goers can sit and play for household items. Yes, in a
corner beside the hot food bar, there sits a statuesque, art deco
arrangement of Andrex toilet rolls, Fairy Liquid and cans of Heinz
tomato-soup.
''You're not allowed to play card games for money in bingo halls due
to the Gaming Act of 1968,'' explains Ewen Blair, the general manager,
in black tuxedo and bow-tie, who is showing me round, ''so we allow the
women to gamble for their groceries. At least they might go home with
some toilet roll.''
I think this is pretty smart thinking. It has to be one of the most
exciting ways of getting the shopping in. In fact, it cancels out going
to the supermarket altogether. Maybe this is the point. There isn't an
M&amp;S installation in Possil, or a Tesco or a Safeway. I'd rather gamble
for the messages than tramp the township dust for them any day.
Most bingo is played in the north of England or in Glasgow. In this
way, it deserves the title of culture. Bingo-punters of all ages are a
closely-knit bunch who appear slightly alienated from any other class.
It really does seem as if this is the only time they get out, both
physically and spiritually.
But the Paramount must continue to deserve its status within the
community. The club is open from 10am, and last game is around 10.15pm.
The cleaners are in the club at 8am and are on call all day. A clean
environment is important, it lends professionalism. ''The local people
don't abuse the facilities,'' explains Blair. They wouldn't. His
statement verifies how local punters feel about their bingo hall, and
verifies a Conservative ideology. The thinking behind home ownership was
that you don't mess up your own place.
Any mess is a practical vandalism. Tables are merely littered with Irn
Bru or tins of Diet Coke, crisps, wee tin doilies for fag ash, ticket
books and fat finger felt tip pens. The tanned, blond couple at the
adjacent table have even brought a mobile phone. On the subject of
communication, bingo lingo, such as ''Legs Eleven'' and ''Two Fat
Ladies'' is no longer in operation.
''The customers didn't appreciate it,'' says Blair. ''The showman side
of bingo has been replaced with cabaret.'' Lena Martell and Voulez Vous,
the Abba impersonators, go down well with members. And even when there's
entertainment on, entry is free.
Bingo is methodical (the concentration of a player has been compared
to that of a Cambridge student sitting an exam); its closest living
relative is the crossword for attentiveness, and the stamping of a
cheque stub for speed. As for intellectual gravitas, let's not get into
that. Intelligence hasn't got much to do with pleasure. The whole point
of having fun is to forget about being regarded as sensible or smart.
Smart fun is going to the Edinburgh Fringe, and we all know how boring
that is.
In an hour and fifty minutes, armed with #4.50's worth of numbers, I
had five near misses. Bingo simply involves marking the numbers on your
tickets which correlate with the caller's. But it becomes your ambition
to shout ''House!'' and sit with your hand up like you did at school,
waving a lucky ticket. Every time a winner shrieks, the rest of the hall
sigh, stretch, and generally grump about how close they were, until the
next number is called.
In gambling, a win is never guaranteed. In order to win you must be a
loser first. It's a strange discipline. To gamble it is imperative you
get used to the idea that money can disappear, and get over the fact
that its transience is stupid. The gambler wants to spend, not horde,
and that is indeed a trait of the less affluent. After all, you're only
poor until you win. But no-one really gambles on losing, pessimism has
no place in a bingo hall.
To gamble you must actually believe in the futility of money, really
believe in using it to the full. If you have a respect for money then
you won't make a good gambler. You'll want something tangible in return
for your cash. Gamblers believe that life can change, they have a
touching faith in the unexpected.
It may be green, the idea that money brings happiness, but it's also
pompous to say it can't. A surprising amount of people would settle for
a less than passionate life as long as they had plenty of money to
cushion minor feelings of sadness or irritation. Playing bingo is a
means of excitement, with the added bonus of a win, and everybody needs
their kicks -- especially those with no other privileges.

William Russell reports on the plight of Aung San Suu Kyi, Burma's
elected leader who is a prisoner of conscience in her own home.
THE Burmese politician and 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu
Kyi, who has been under house arrest in Rangoon for the past six years,
was 50 last week. The occasion was marked by Amnesty International with
a birthday cake, the candles of which were lit by MPs at a party at
Westminster.
It was part of world-wide celebrations organised by Amnesty to draw
attention to the plight of a woman, a symbol of her country's struggle
against a despotic military regime which the West, by and large,
ignores. Burma is in many respects the Albania of Asia. Aung San Suu
Kyi's only crime has been the peaceful expression of her political
views, and she is regarded by Amnesty as a prisoner of conscience.
Once part of the Commonwealth, Burma became an independent republic in
1948 and changed its name in 1989 to the Union of Myanmar. But the old
name lingers.
In 1962 the army, under General Ne Win, took power and suspended the
parliamentary constitution. After rioting and months of political
instability in 1988, General Saw Maung, leader of the armed forces,
assumed power and set up the State Law and Order Restoration Council
(SLORC). In May 1990 multi-party elections were held which resulted in
an overwhelming victory for the National League for Democracy, led by
Aung San Suu Kyi, who had been under house arrest since July the
previous year. The SLORC refused to recognise the result, and the
generals still rule the country.
John Boorman's latest film, Beyond Rangoon, screened recently in
London for Amnesty, deals with the events of 1988 and includes the
famous incident when Aung San Suu Kyi confronted the army and walked
past their guns to join her followers.
Boorman shot the film in Malaysia, but came up against Burmese
hostility. ''Malaysia has cosied up to Burma in recent years, because
she wants to get into that market,'' he said. ''We had permission to
film, but the Burmese made diplomatic representations, and it was
suddenly withdrawn. I had to make up a phoney script setting the story,
which is about what happens to an American woman caught in the riots of
1988, in an imaginary country. It was quite clear to the Malaysians that
this was a farce, but they were embarrassed about throwing us out and
went along with it.''
His greatest worry was that Burmese intelligence agents, who had
infiltrated the set, would plant drugs on somebody because possession is
a hanging offence in Malaysia. The authorities also proved difficult
about allowing Burmese actors into the country and he was forced to buy
false passports for them in Bangkok.
The Burmese government arrested and jailed three Burmese actors who
returned home after making the film. Four others are going through the
procedures to enable them to settle in America as political refugees.
''I think Aung San Suu Kyi is a great heroic figure, on a par with
Gandhi,'' Boorman said. ''She is free to leave, if she wishes, to join
her husband and two sons in England, and yet she stays. The generals are
terrified of her. When you pass her house you can be arrested if you
turn your head in its direction. She sits there and they are afraid. She
cannot accept money from her husband and lives by selling her furniture.
She will not accept food from the authorities because she does not
accept she is a legal prisoner -- and she is afraid they might try to
poison her.''
He believes it is ''almost inevitable'' the regime in Burma will
collapse because that is the nature of totalitarian regimes. But, for
the present, Aung San Suu Kyi remains under house arrest.
* Beyond Rangoon goes on general release on Friday, June 30.

PAY rises in the manufacturing and service sectors have held steady
but they are ''significantly'' lower in the public sector compared to
private industry, separate sets of figures revealed yesterday.
The CBI's Pay Databank showed that deals in manufacturing averaged
3.3% in the three months to the end of May -- the same as in the quarter
ending in April -- while service sector awards averaged 3.4% against
3.3% previously.
The main constraint on pay in both sectors was the inability of firms
to raise their prices, followed by low profits and low cost-of-living
increases, said the CBI.
CBI director general Howard Davies said: ''These new figures show that
manufacturers are not allowing employment costs to accelerate. That
discipline is absolutely imperative if we are to enhance our competitive
edge.''
However, he warned that manufacturing earnings were still rising
faster than those of all Britain's major overseas competitors and that,
with productivity growth slowing, firms had to be sure performance
awards were justified.
A report by pay analysts Incomes Data Services showed that most public
sector settlements this year have been between 2% and 2.9%, while
workers in private firms have struck deals of at least 3%.
It found there was still a strong link between private sector
increases and the rate of inflation.
Meanwhile, another report showed that the gap between thepay of men
and women has closed by just 7% in the past 20 years.
Women's hourly earnings are 79% of men's and it will take another 55
years before equality is reached, said the Labour Research Department.
Managers received an above-inflation 5% pay rise last year but many
lost out on perks including a company car, according to another report
published yesterday.
Some managers and directors also had their holidays cut, the Institute
of Management survey found.
Managers in smaller companies had a 5% pay rise while directors
received 6.6%.
The percentage of managers with company cars fell from 60% to 51% and
holidays were cut from six to five weeks or less.
The number of smaller firms providing free private health insurance
for their senior staff fell for the third successive year.
Managers in small firms now earn an average of #28,800, which includes
a bonus of #1100, while a director earns an average of #54,600,
including a #4500 bonus.
Mr Roger Young, director general of the institute, said many
organisations were finding that they must cut costs without cutting
corners.
''Perks have clearly been trimmed to give organisations scope to
reward excellent achievement through performance-related pay,'' he said.

Retired Judge Michael Argyle and Felix Dennis will switch places in a
libel re-run of the Oz trial. Twenty four years ago Felix was a young
co-defendant in the controversial case and today he is a
multi-millionaire publisher determined to clear his name, as Roger
Hutchinson reports
IN THE sultry early afternoon of Thursday, August 5, 1971, the
56-year-old High Court Judge, Michael Victor Argyle, peered over the
rims of his half-moon spectacles in Court Number Two of the Central
Criminal Courts at the Old Bailey, and passed his sentences on the last
of the three editors of the underground magazine Oz.
''You are younger than the other two,'' pronounced Argyle to a
24-year-old Londoner named Felix Dennis, ''and very much less
intelligent. Nine months.''
''I am very sorry you had to do that,'' said Dennis as they led him
away.
What does it mean in Westerns, when the reluctant gunslinger utters
those words? It means: ''This may take some time, but watch out.''
Last month the papers were finally served. The street-selling hippie
who disappeared from Justice Argyle's sight 24 years ago, who was hauled
off by uniformed officers to serve a jail sentence which Argyle said he
felt he had to impose because the defendant could not possibly afford to
pay a fine, re-emerged into the retired judge's life.
Having spent the intervening years amassing, through publishing, a
personal fortune of #155m, the 48-year-old Felix Dennis engaged the most
expensive and successful libel lawyer in the country and issued a High
Court writ against the 80-year-old Michael Victor Argyle. It conjured a
gorgeous, improbable analogy: like some latter-day lost Dickensian hero,
Felix Dennis had burst back into the drawing room to avenge his family's
name, do down the erstwhile persecutor of his friends, and claim his
inheritance.
It has been a long haul. Three years after the trial Oz closed down,
and Felix Dennis began to lay the foundations of his own independent
publishing empire.
He started with a poster-magazine based on the popularity of the film
star Bruce Lee. Kung Fu Monthly enabled its publisher to branch out into
the vulnerable young world of personal-computer magazines, and to
establish himself in New York. By 1983 he had sold his first title, and
had become a millionaire. By 1991 Paddy Ashdown was presenting him with
a UK Magazine Publisher of The Year award, and by 1995 he was allegedly
the 56th richest British citizen.
He has a condominium in New York, a mansion and 450 acres near
Stratford-on-Avon, an apartment in the West End of London, a large chunk
of the Caribbean island of Mustique, and a helicopter and Rolls-Royce to
get about in. Felix Dennis has played the money game on both sides of
the Atlantic, and won.
It has become a popular received wisdom that Dennis was prompted to a
single-minded pursuit of wealth by Justice Michael Argyle's unpleasant
dismissal of his intelligence back in 1971.
But Dennis was a natural businessman. When he started hand-selling Oz
on London's King's Road its sales rocketed; when he progressed to
selling advertising for the magazine, Oz found itself with money in the
bank. Those streetwise qualities, coupled with the crash-course facility
in hands-on publishing which the underground press gave most of its
graduates, was enough to make his millions. No gratuitous insults,
however publicly announced, were needed to make this man rich.
And since becoming rich . . . well, he has had a busy life to lead.
There are plenty of stories about Felix Dennis late at night, but none
of them involves him sitting around obsessively swearing vengeance on
the judge. The legal papers which have just been served on Michael
Victor Argyle are, rather, the retired judge's own doing.
After the Appeal Court judges had quashed the Oz convictions
(''because of the serious and substantial misdirection of the jury by
Michael Argyle,'' said Lord Chief Justice Widgery), Argyle continued on
his kenspeckle way. The Scottish adjective is appropriate: Michael
Argyle claims direct descent from a member of Charles Edward Stuart's
Jacobite army who was supposedly marooned in the English Midlands in the
winter of 1745. This ancestor and his kin, says the retired judge, went
on to become highwaymen . . .
He has survived more than one scrape with the libertarians of the
national press, raised minor furores for freeing rapists and issuing
racist comments, but they were comparatively small beer. There would
never again be an event so suited to Justice Argyle's temperament as the
Oz trial. Michael Argyle had peaked early. And he has spent the
subsequent years fine-tuning, in after-dinner talks and lectures to
public schoolboys, his own instructively idiosyncratic version of what
was happening at the Old Bailey in the summer of 1971.
In 1988 Michael Argyle retired from the Old Bailey bench. He continued
to be active in a number of his favoured causes, most notably the
campaign to restore the death penalty. In 1992 he travelled to Australia
to visit some members of his family. Alerted to his arrival, the
Australian press waylaid him at the airport and asked him about one of
their own, Felix Dennis's co-defendant Richard Neville, who was, by
then, settled back in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
''Richard Neville was a card-carrying communist,'' Argyle told them,
blithely ignorant of the fact that Neville was incapable of joining a
bus queue, ''and the Oz trial was about a dirty little magazine being
peddled to children -- but it was a front for pornographers and drug
barons.''
To those who did not frequent Michael Argyle's social evenings, this
latest departure into the realms of fantasy came as something of a
shock. It had long been realised that the judge had been uncomfortable
with the rude ingredients of Oz magazine. But drug barons? Where did
that come from?
Far from being ''drug barons'' themselves, the editors of Oz had
campaigned against drug barons. Far from being ''card-carrying
communists'', they had argued, in true hippie fashion, that the
established right/left political polarisation was anachronistic.
But Richard Neville had neither the inclination nor the money to take
Argyle to court three years ago, and there the whole, odd story might
have foundered if Neville had not decided to publish his reminiscences.
Last month Hippie Hippie Shake was indulgently reviewed in The Spectator
magazine by the former defence counsel at the Oz trial, John Mortimer.
And this brought Michael Argyle snarling once more from his lair.
In the very next issue of The Spectator he offered his own version of
events. It made sensational, jaw-dropping copy. ''Behind the Oz
magazine,'' offered Argyle, ''was a conspiracy of criminals who were
selling it, together with soft drugs, at the entrance to state schools,
youth clubs and such. The stuff (drugs) was pouring in by ship . . . ''
When, he continued, he had put the Oz editors behind bars, ''the
imports seemed to slacken''. But after the Appeal Court had quashed
their convictions ''the traffic picked up again''.
Felix Dennis promptly hired the #3000-a-day QC, George Carman, and
issued High Court writs for libel against the editor of The Spectator,
Dominic Lawson, against The Spectator itself, and against Michael
Argyle. Carman's reputation is such that -- with the notable recent
exception of Graeme Souness -- his opponents tend to settle quickly and
out of court.
It is said that Dennis has no real interest in taking Argyle all the
way to court, that he is not about to make of the judge a hoary martyr
of the right. After 24 years, it seems that Felix Dennis just wants to
stop all of the nonsense. And sure enough, the latest issue of The
Spectator contains the grovelling apology which Dennis had demanded.
But Michael Argyle is being less than co-operative. He refused an
invitation to attach his name to The Spectator's disclaimer, and told a
photographer that he looked forward to ''taking Felix Dennis'' in a
counter-action ''for five million pounds . . . ''
After all of the threats, the court cases, libels, after-dinner
speeches and pronouncements to the press, there are still outstanding
questions concerning the trial of Oz, which might ironically only be
answered from the witness box if Michael Argyle proceeds with his
counter-action.
Where, for example, was his Apocrypha born? He was obviously under the
impression, in 1971 and ever since, that rather than merely presiding
over the ridiculous prosecution of a harmless and impecunious hippie
magazine, he had been detailed to stamp out a major threat to
civilisation in Britain.
The judge was working to a different agenda from anybody else at the
Old Bailey. He was locking away ''communist drug barons'' and ''a
conspiracy of criminals''. He was, by his own admission, trying and
sentencing the three men not for the mild offences of which, after his
misdirection of the jury, they had been found guilty, but for other
rumoured activities of which they had never been accused or charged.
That was in itself a disturbing interpretation of the judicial
process, and it begs further questions. Did he invent those fantastical
activities of the three Oz editors all on his own? Or was he briefed
about them? If it was the latter, who whispered such extraordinary lies
into his receptive ear, and why? If this latest retrial of Oz magazine
collapses after an apology in The Spectator, Michael Victor Argyle may
take the fascinating answers to those questions with him to the grave.

I AM A MIDDLE-OF-THE-ROAD Tory MP in a marginal seat with a majority
of fewer than 5000. The Prime Minister wants me to ''put up or shut
up'', or back him or sack him. My concern is who will be the best leader
to give me the best chance of holding on to my seat.
I would not be in Parliament now had it not been for Margaret Thatcher
and/or John Major. Thatcher says she backs Major, but he is not
sufficiently Conservative. I agree with his stance on Europe and
disagree with hers.
My main constituency worries are homes and job stability, which we
have failed to deliver so far on collectively agreed Cabinet policy. I
am tempted by the charismatic Heseltine who, so far, supports Major, as
I might do if he is unopposed. But I might abstain to get more choice.
* I AM AN OUTRIGHT OPPONENT of Major, and always have been since he
replaced my heroine Margaret Thatcher. I am deeply suspicious of his
European policy and fear that he will fudge this and abandon more
British sovereignty.
I have been a rebel in the division lobbies and I have had great
pressure put upon me, but up to now my local party has seen me through.
I want Major out, but I have a problem. If I force a second ballot by
either abstaining or voting for a stalking horse, I might let in
Europhiles Heseltine or Clarke. Where would that leave me? My candidate
would be Portillo, who is precluded from standing until there is a
second ballot.
If Redwood announces today that he will stand, I will back him. If not
Redwood, Lamont. Despite the dangers of Heseltine, I must force a second
ballot and see what happens then.
* I AM A EUROPHILE and my heart leapt when Major said he wanted to put
Britain at the heart of Europe. I ackowledge that the Maastricht
compromises were expedient, although I would have been more positive in
tone about a single currency. There is sense to Major's claim that a
decision on this is a long way off, and I go along with it.
But I have been alarmed at his increased scepticism to please the
rebels, some of whom want us out of Europe altogether. Heseltine or
Clarke might be better at articulating our cause, but both could do so
in their present positions, or if Heseltine is shifted to party
chairman.
What really horrifies me is the prospect that a Portillo or a Redwood
should take over. We Europhiles might then have to be the rebels in
division lobbies, or even in a confidence vote. My best plan is to hope
that Major is unopposed, and if he is not, work as hard as I can for a
derisory vote for the opponent in the first ballot.
* I AM A GENUINELY SENIOR TORY BACK BENCHER, sometimes described as a
''grey suit''. Not many of us left. I am getting on in years but I would
like another Parliament, even in Opposition, before I retire. I have
been passed over by both Thatcher and Major for office, but I feel no
great chagrin about that.
For me it is important that the party pulls itself together in
preparation for an early return to office, should it lose the next
General Election. This, it seems most likely to do. But if we go on
divided as we are, there could be a Labour landslide.
This, in turn, could endanger even my relatively safe seat. This is
not a convenient proposition for me, so I am going to vote for unity and
rallying round the Prime Minister in these dark days. I agree with
Thatcher. He is the best man for the job until the electorate has
decided between Tory and Labour.
* I AM A DISCARDED MINISTER. I think Major is weak and unappealing to
the country. If he thinks I was incompetent, then I reciprocate this
feeling. I was not forced to resign, like some, for their personal
indiscretions. I was doing a reasonable, supportive job at the ministry
and all of a sudden I was surplus to requirements.
My sacking upset my family and friends greatly after all our
sacrifices for the Tory Party and Government. I am looking for a chance
to take revenge. I have a grudge against Major and I will pay it off if
I get the chance. If nobody opposes him for a first ballot, I will be
devastated. I might even have to stand myself to force a contest.
What I need is a second ballot in order to have a chance of voting for
another candidate of Cabinet rank who might bring me back into office as
a matter of gratitude. I could then look my wife in the face again.
* I AM AN AMBITIOUS TORY BACK BENCHER. I am able and energetic and I
have given up too much of my young talents to lose out now. It is
probably already too late to return to my earlier profession, and I
don't fancy being thrown out of the Commons.
I have invested too much of my precious time there to see it
jeopardised by a fool at the top. Mind you, I think I should be at the
top, but nobody has ever heard of me and I need more time on the greasy
pole.
What I want is a more colourful, populist leader who will also
recognise my talents. I really want to back whoever is going to win. I
suppose I will have to go with the pack if Major is unopposed, but,
ideally, I want several candidates in the fight to see if any of them is
prepared to bring me on. Thank God it is a secret ballot and I can offer
them all support.
* I AM A NON-VOTER (this is me talking now) in this election on July
4, which will decide who is to be the Tory leader and the Prime Minister
up to the next General Election. I have tried to give you the various
main categories of Tory MP who are the sole electorate on this issue.
Each category has its own dilemmas, and these may increase by this
time next week. Furthermore, there are no clear delineations between the
categories, the membership of which have varying political views within
their groupings. It is not as simple as pro and anti-Europe, for
example.
What the Tory Parliamentary Party really needs now is a category of
MPs who can vote together on the simple issue of what is best for the
country. They might find that this is best for their party too.

I HAVE been listening with increasing incredulity to Labour's response
to the Black Report.
It seems that when there is seedy, corrupt and unacceptable behaviour
in the Conservative Party we blame the Tories and when there is seedy,
corrupt and unacceptable behaviour in the Labour Party we have to blame
the Tories.
Apparently the continuing sleaze factor in the Monklands Labour Party
stems from the fact that the Tories did not set up an inquiry. But what
of the inquiry actually set up by Labour?
The past Chairman of the Labour Party in Scotland, Ann McGuire,
apparently thinks there was ''confusion'' over the remit of their
inquiry. I don't think there's any confusion any longer -- its remit was
obviously a whitewash and brush-under-the-carpet job.

IN response to an advert in your newspaper I applied to the Scottish
Office to be considered for membership of one of the new water
authorities. I had fairly unique experience and qualifications which I
believed would allow me to make a substantial contribution in such a
position.
I was not too disappointed this week when I heard from the Scottish
Office that I had not been successful as I was told that over 750
applications covering a wide range of skills had been received.
I was therefore astounded to read the article by Councillor Jean
McFadden telling us that Mr Lang had offered her membership of the West
Water Authority (June 22).
One must assume that Mrs McFadden did not apply for this. Even Mr Lang
must be aware of the implacable opposition to the new authorities voiced
by Mrs McFadden and her party ever since the move to set them up was
announced. And yet, in spite of that, he makes this offer to her and
very probably to others of similar persuasion.
I wonder how many of the other 700 or so unsuccessful candidates who
put their names forward in good faith feel like me just a bit insulted.

A RETIRED major is facing an anxious wait to discover if he has
contracted HIV after tackling two men during a break-in at his home.
Major Roy Bannister-Parker, 65, is also waiting to discover if will be
prosecuted.
He was disturbed in the early hours of Monday, June 5, by the latest
in a series of break-ins at his home in Higher Walton, Lancashire.
He says both intruders were heroin addicts and one was HIV positive.
One managed to escape, after throwing a drill at him in his garage,
but he cornered the second, who hit him.
''I hit him back in the mouth, purely to subdue him. Then I dragged
him indoors to the phone. As I was alerting police, he fought to
struggle free so I clipped him across the face with my open hand,'' he
said.
However, when he got to the police station, he found himself arrested
when the burglar complained about the incident.
His firearms certificate was revoked, although he claims he only
protected himself with an unloaded gun which was dropped during the
struggle.
After the major was released on bail, Lancashire Assistant Chief
Constable Gerry O'Connell wrote to him: ''I was most concerned to learn
of reports of your subsequent conduct and behaviour, particularly as it
is alleged that this involved unnecessary threats, violence, and the use
of a shotgun.''
The major said yesterday: ''I have no regrets about what I did and I
would do it again. I am a man who does things and thinks about it
afterwards.
''It was a most distressing thing to have to get up at 2am and face a
gang breaking into your home. A lot of people would have had a heart
attack.
''I was lucky to be able to catch one of them. What is a man to do?''
A Lancashire Police spokeswoman confirmed yesterday: ''We have
received a formal complaint and we are obliged to investigate it.
''It is now up to the Crown Prosecution Service to decide if he is to
be charged with any offence.''
Two men have been remanded by Preston magistrates charged with
burglary and other offences. One is on bail and the second in custody.

WITH the ''mosquing'' of the council Glasgow goes too far in pandering
to a vociferous and pretentious cultural minority.
In our culture none is denied the right to profess and proclaim his or
her faith; and that is as it should be. However, in the ''mosquing''
Glasgow Council accords a significance to Islam which is neither
deserved nor satisfactorily explained and will do nothing to ease
tensions, which are cultural rather than racial.
Quite the contrary, for there will now be demands from that clamorous
section of the Islamic community for its ''rightful place'' in the
establishment -- a situation neither sought by nor given to other
minority cultures who have settled happily throughout Scotland over many
generations.
Or perhaps the naive, woolly-thinking, would-be do-gooders of Glasgow
Council are seriously contemplating the ''synagoguing, Sikh-templing,
and covilling (Hindu-templing)'' of the council -- all of which would
recognise religious minorities whose precepts and doctrines are much
less at variance with Christianity (the foundation of our civilisation
and culture whether Glagow Council likes it or not) than is Islam.

I HAVE read with amazement the reaction of some of my fellow believers
to the ''Mosquing of the council''. Personally, I can see no reason why
a secular body on which different religious beliefs, and in some cases,
no religious beliefs, are held, should not attend different places of
worship -- that is assuming that any religious service is deemed
necessary.
The Church of Scotland has, in any case, no monopoly of the council.
A far greater threat to the Church comes in my opinion in the form of
multi-faith services and through the ecumenical movement, since in the
first the uniqueness of Christ is undermined and in the second genuine
doctrinal differences are simply papered over.

UNLIKE John R Stephen's somewhat bitter letter I do not intend to
personalise the issue of law and order and while I acknowledge his point
of view the various misquotes do his letter little service (June 20).
Strathclyde Police have striven to maintain the ''reassuring image of
the traditional British bobby'', albeit such an image owes more to Dixon
of Dock Green than reality.
Despite the proliferation of dedicated community officers the facts
are that in current times modern methods are also required with
intelligence-led proactive targeting of criminals that has been so
successful at detecting offenders and reducing crime.
Despite the release of a considerable number of officers to street
duties with the ongoing civilianisation programme, we would require to
increase our establishment about 10-fold to provide the ''postman''
coverage as equated by your correspondent whose views are an anachronism
reflecting apparent prejudices which are best consigned to history.
Fortunately the public and many of the ranking officers he so
denigrates are more supportive of our young officers of both sexes
alongside whom I am privileged to serve, who so bravely guard, watch,
and patrol on the public's behalf, sometimes at great cost to
themselves.

SPRINGBOK rugby's greatest moment was soured yesterday after the
losing All Black team walked out of a formal World Cup dinner in protest
at remarks by South African rugby supremo Louis Luyt.
South African officials have apologised to the All Blacks after Luyt
said: ''There were no true world champions in the 1987 and 1991 World
Cups because South Africa were not there. We have proved our point.''
New Zealand were world champions in 1987 and Australia in 1991.
New Zealand captain Sean Fitzpatrick and his team walked out after
some had approached the top table and abused Luyt. He said: ''It's
disgusting. I cannot believe what he has said.''
New Zealand manager Colin Meads told his opposite number, Morne du
Plessis: ''I am sorry we cannot stay any longer.''
Welsh referee Derek Bevan, who controlled the key World Cup semi-final
between South Africa and France in Durban, also found himself at the
centre of controversy. Bevan, who waved away French claims of what would
have been a match-winning try, was singled out from all the officials at
the banquet and presented with a gold watch by Luyt.
The referee said he was ''a bit surprised and embarrassed'', adding:
''If he had done it quietly, it would have been better for everyone. It
could be misconstrued and, if that is the case, it leaves a bitter
taste.''
It also emerged yesterday that some of the All Blacks team, which lost
to South Africa 15-12 in Saturday's final, were suffering from suspected
food poisoning. Eighteen of the party fell ill soon after eating a meal
in their Johannesburg hotel on Thursday night and four of their leading
players were doubtful starters on Saturday.
The food poisoning revelation may go some way towards explaining why
the All Blacks, the clear pre-match favourites, were unable to recapture
their earlier sparkling form.
Brian Lochore, the All Blacks' campaign manager, indicated he would
not be registering a complaint, describing the incident as ''an
unfortunate coincidence and no reason for an excuse''.
Team doctor Mike Owen has sent faecal samples from some players to a
local laboratory for analysis but it is understood this was motivated by
medical, rather than legal, reasons.
However the coach, Laurie Mains, later said in Wellington: ''It was
just an amazing sequence of events and coincidence that, of our 35-man
party that ate at that particular lunch venue in the hotel, about 27 of
them went down in the space of 12 hours. You can read what you like into
that, but I don't think it was coincidence. We certainly have our
suspicions.''
The only items the New Zealand party had in common during the lunch
were tea and coffee.
Four of the New Zealand party were physically sick on Thursday while
the other 14 complained of nausea and other symptoms. Worst affected
were stand-off Andrew Mehrtens, winger Jeff Wilson, prop Craig Dowd, and
team manager Colin Meads. Wilson was unable to finish the match after a
low-key performance and was violently ill after coming off. Dowd was
also replaced while Mehrtens's kicking fell short of his normal
standard.

RECENT letters to the editor have called for a widespread legalisation
of illicit drugs. The consequences of such action need to be examined in
much more detail.
The reduction in criminality expected to follow such action was not
seen in America in the 1920s when prohibition on alcohol was lifted. On
the contrary the criminals merely diversified their activities and
continued to commit crime.
It is highly likely that drug dealers would follow a similar course of
action, perhaps into more violent crime, to maintain their lifestyle.
The second important issue is the effect on the health of our young
people. One inevitable consequence of making illicit drugs, in
particular heroin, cheaper and more widely available would be an
increase in consumption.
The health consequences of having more heroin addicts, whether this
was obtained legally or illegally, are very grave indeed, as is the
probable increase in drug deaths this would lead to.
I have yet to meet anyone working in the drugs field who advocates
such a policy. The police should be congratulated for taking on such a
difficult task and empowering the local community to act against those
who are involved in the distribution of illicit drugs.
There are no simple solutions to this problem. We should all lend
encouragement to those who continue the fight against drugs.

THE leadership campaign ofJohn Major received a boost at the weekend
when key Tory Party activists in Scotland passed a motion unanimously
supporting his re-election.
This was welcomed by Scottish Secretary Ian Lang at the Major campaign
office in London last night. He said: ''I welcome the extremely strong
support that the Scottish Party has given to the Prime Minister from the
very moment he took this decision to stand for re-election.''
About 75 delegates from constituency associations and affiliated
organisations attended the meeting of the Scottish Conservative and
Unionist Association at South Queensferry on Saturday.
SCUA president David McLetchie said their motion commended the Prime
Minister for the courage he had shown in calling the leadership election
at this time to resolve divisions within the party once and for all. It
also pledged full support for Mr Major as leader of the party and as
Prime Minister.
The motion was put forward by past president Adrian Shinwell and
seconded by Mr Martin Robb, of Perth and Kinross constituency
association. It was passed with no votes against and no abstentions.
Although SCUA has only advisory status, it was emphasised by both the
national party chairman Jeremy Hanley and his Scottish counterpart Sir
Michael Hirst that when MPs come to vote a week tomorrow, they should
heed the clear calls coming from the grassroots in favour of Mr Major.
A source at the Major campaign office picked up on this last night.
''There is no doubt that the views of ordinary party members up and
down the country are very strongly behind the Prime Minister and MPs
should listen to these views carefully and reflect on them before
voting,'' he said.
Sir Michael Hirst said after Saturday's vote: ''The view that was
expressed was consistent with the warm support that the Prime Minister
has had from the Scottish Party. When John Major wins this leadership
campaign, his hand will be strengthened immeasurably.
''The unedifying spectacle of public divisions within our
parliamentary party has dismayed the rank and file and they want to see
an end to it.''
Mr Hanley said all parties had splits, none more so than the Labour
Party, but the fault lines in the Conservative Party were simply more
visible. Unity was now vital, he said, not just for the sake of winning
the next General Election but so that the Prime Minister could represent
Britain in Europe without the national interest being endangered.
Mr McLetchie revealed that, since last Thursday, four constituency
associations which happened to have meetings scheduled had all backed Mr
Major. These were Edinburgh West, Banff and Buchan, East Kilbride, and
Kincardine and Deeside.
Once it was known whether a contender was declared against Mr Major,
there would be a further round of meetings to sound local opinion.
However, he pointed out that at Saturday's meeting not a single person
present had spoken in favour of any candidate other than the Prime
Minister.
''It is these people at the grassroots of the party up and down the
country that put MPs into Parliament and their views should be listened
to,'' said Mr McLetchie.

THREE men and a woman from the same family have been arrested in a
police raid which recovered cannabis with a street value of #13.2m.
Detectives, who had been carrying out an investigation in
Nottinghamshire, Yorkshire, and Liverpool, were amazed at the haul,
believed to be one of Britain's biggest involving cannabis.
The drugs were handed over at motorway service stations after being
smuggled from the continent by a ''family gang'' based in
Nottinghamshire, police said.
Other suspects were being interviewed in different parts of the
country while detectives were liaising with police forces in Europe.
Four people were expected to appear before magistrates in Nottingham on
Wednesday. Some would also face allegations relating to a loaded pistol.

TRAVEL and airline representatives were abused at Glasgow Airport last
night by passengers whose flights were delayed for more than 30 hours by
strike action in Malta which closed the airport there.
Some who had been due to leave on an Air Malta flight for Luqa at
9.55pm on Saturday were told that the earliest they could hope to travel
would be 4am today.
''The place is an utter shambles,'' said Iain McKenzie, Servisair duty
officer. ''Scenes like this are being repeated at airports across
Europe.
''An A320 aircraft, with a capacity of 168, had been expected, but the
one which arrived could take only 138. A total of 26 people booked on
the flight have had to be excluded.''
They were told that room would be found for them on a scheduled Air
Malta flight which ''should be airborne by 4.30am''.
Another Servisair official confirmed that scheduled Air Malta
passengers on that flight (which had also been delayed) who had paid
more than #500 were being removed to accommodate the 26, some of whom
had travelled from Aberdeen and had checked in by 7.30pm on Saturday for
the 9.55pm flight.
Police were on hand as Cosmos tour representatives were harangued by
holiday-makers who complained they were losing a day-and-a-half of a
seven day trip. Tearful passengers who asked about compensation were
told that none would be paid except through insurance policies.
Representatives of Avro Tours failed to respond to requests to answer
customers' inquiries.
Although some passengers were accommodated in hotels, others with
young children had already spent one night sleeping on chairs in the
airport concourse.
In Manchester, frustrated holidaymakers were waiting at a hotel after
a flight to Ibiza was held up overnight by a missing spare part.
The 359 passengers had been due to fly on an A300/600 Airbus at
11.45pm on Saturday, but a faulty instrument halted the take-off.
Police said they dealt with an incident involving rowdy youths from
the Monarch flight in terminal 1B at the airport at about 1.15am
yesterday, but there were no arrests.
A Monarch spokesman said that a small jet had flown to Cyprus to
collect a replacement part for the aircraft, and it was hoped that it
would be ready to fly by last night.
Two hundred travellers from Edinburgh took advantage of a new
once-a-week Sunday service to New York operated by an Edinburgh-based
tour operator, Globespan.
Edinburgh Airport's managing director, Mr Ron Wallace, said: ''We're
in discussions with a number of companies as we're looking to increase
our charter flight traffic to European destinations and also to North
America.
''We're also talking to companies in a bid to have a charter aircraft
based at Edinburgh.''
Globespan's return to John F Kennedy Airport is #349 at the summer
peak, #179 low-season.
Ms Karen Brown, director and UK sales and marketing manager for
Globespan, said: ''We pioneered the first charter between Edinburgh and
Toronto in 1984. Now we're making history again with the first charter
between Edinburgh and New York.
''Remember we're bringing in 200 American visitors a week direct to
Edinburgh. That's a boost for the city's tourist industry.''
The flights are operated by American Transair and Globespan claim they
undercut scheduled services by around #150.
Meanwhile, moves towards privatising airports in the Highlands and
Islands have been described as a waste of public money by a union.
The Civil and Public Services Association will hold public meetings in
nine locations affected by the proposals to gather support for their
campaign.
The first will be held in Inverness on July 31 and Inverness
councillors will be urged tonight to back the campaign.
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang recently announced a review into possible
private sector involvement in Highlands and Islands Airports Ltd, which
runs nine airports throughout the area.
Mr Michael McCann, Scottish regional officer of the CPSA, said: ''The
strategic importance to the economic and social well-being of the
Highlands and Islands of the overall transportation infrastructure,
which includes the nine airports in HIAL, should be obvious -- even to
an administration blinded by dogma.
''However, recent history tells us that this will not stop them
attempting to try to privatise the airports.''
Mr McCann said the union believed it was vital to keep the HIAL in
public ownership and added: ''There is no further scope for cutting the
services that HIAL provides and, therefore, the review that the
Government has undertaken is a complete waste of taxpayers' money.''
He said Mr Lang has not called the review a privatisation study
because the Government would face an embarrassing U-turn if it failed.
''However this is clearly on the agenda,'' he said.

I WOULD like to protest very strongly at your publishing, on June 20,
The face of token religion, by John Macleod, a most calumnious article
about the Glasgow councillors' visit to the mosque.
This highly insensitive and totally irresponsible piece of gutter
journalism has offended thousands of Muslims and other tolerant and
decent citizens of Scotland. I have received hundreds of calls from
people of all creeds and colours to protest vehemently at this wanton
attack on Islam and our elected representatives on the city council.
May I be allowed to point out that such hysterical journalism does not
inform or even entertain the readers? Instead it generates myths,
misconceptions, and hate in society.

ALISON KERR travels to a Highland village which boasts its connection
with Barbara Cartland
BURIED deep among the Highland hills is a village with a shrine to one
of England's national treasures -- the most prolific pedlar of plush
pink prose in existence, Barbara Cartland. For the inhabitants of
Helmsdale, BC does not connote a period of history, but the walking
(well, teetering) 94-year-old legend who comes to stay in the village
for a few weeks each summer.
Cartland's connection with Helmsdale goes back to 1927 when she first
married into the local McCorquodale family. (She divorced her first
husband, Alexander, in 1933 and married his cousin, Hugh, three years
later.) That link has always been Helmsdale's main claim to fame, and by
way of a tribute to the Dame who has lent them her celebrity, a room
dedicated to her was set up in the village museum, the Timespan centre,
in 1988.
The ''BC room'' has to be seen to be believed. The last stop on the
guided tour of the tardis-like museum, it takes even the least
unsuspecting visitor by surprise. Flanked by chintz curtains, and
cordoned off so that over-enthusiastic fans won't make off with Miss
Cartland's very own bottle of Norfolk Punch (she swears by it,
apparently) or the first salmon she caught in the Helmsdale river, the
room has been decorated to correspond with the great dame's own
guidelines.
Indeed, all the ''exhibits'' have been donated by her: from the
gilt-framed pictures of her grannie, Flora Faulkner, and her
great-grandmother, Mary Anne Hamilton -- both of which look like 1970s
Hallmark greetings cards, rather than nineteenth-century portraits --
through to the floral wallpaper and the framed family tree.
What's most striking as one approaches the Cartland corner (discreetly
housed at the back of the museum shop, behind rows of jars of preserves
and bath oils), is the life-sized figure of Dame Barbara in her youth.
At least, I think it's meant to be in her youth: there are certainly no
wrinkles on the face.
Concessions to reality -- and there aren't many in this rather spooky
(as another more antipodean dame would say) spot -- have been made with
the pancake-like make-up and the white, upswirling, candy-floss hair.
Dummy Barbara is dressed, of course, in her finest pinkery -- a
sequined evening gown, which looks like a Norman Hartnell creation. Her
diamante jewellery includes rings, a necklace, and a pair of heavy
earrings -- one clipped on to her ear, and the other, when I visited
her, nestling in the padding of her alleged cleavage.
As the visitor absorbs all the attention to detail that's gone into
this lovingly recreated boudoir, it's easy to be oblivious to the aural
authenticity of the room. It's only when you stop and pay attention to
what appears to be muzak, that you realise that what you're listening to
is actually Barbara Cartland warbling her way through A Nightingale Sang
In Berkeley Square, accompanied by strings and voices.
This Hilda Ogden-like abuse of melody plays continuously, introduced
each time by the twittery announcement that Miss Cartland did, indeed,
fall in love at that famous address. The whole experience is quite
overwhelming (and rather worrying).
Barbara Cartland: The Nightmare, continues across the road at the La
Mirage restaurant. Run by Nancy Sinclair, who -- from a distance --
bears an uncanny resemblance to Dame Barbara, this is Cartland's other
favourite haunt when she's up staying at Kilphedir Lodge (the
McCorquodale family home).
La Mirage isn't quite as posh as it sounds. For a start, its fare
isn't French -- it's fish and chips. The decor -- pink down to the sugar
-- consists of garden furniture and huge, framed photos of Barbara,
Nancy, and various celebrity visitors to the village.
They're all there: Sally from Coronation Street, Sydney Devine, and
Alan Douglas from Reporting Scotland. The week before my visit, Jimmy
Tarbuck's daughter, Lisa, had been filming a portion of The Weekend Show
from the pink premises. Barbara Cartland is big business for this wee
village.
Over the years, Nancy Sinclair has got to know Barbara Cartland well.
For a start, the painted fingernails on the Cartland effigy were her
work (the chipped bits being the work of over-familiar tourists), and it
was she who inherited the first dress that the model wore.
Nowadays, she and Cartland are such friends that Cartland phones her
regularly and takes afternoon tea at La Mirage every day when she's up
at Kilphedir. The resemblance between Cartland and Sinclair becomes less
apparent the nearer you get to Nancy, and she herself claims that it's a
coincidence that they do their make-up in a similar way.
She is quick to point out the differences between herself and
Cartland: ''Barbara dresses for dinner every night whether she has to or
not''. Furthermore, Cartland, who only ever dresses in pink or ''Nile
blue'', will not even be caught dead in black or in trousers (Nancy
wears both), and she certainly would not approve of Nancy's smoking.
''Barbara blew up the lookalike thing so that she could get me to
deputise for her.''
A typical Cartland visit to Kilphedir involves a few jaunts in her
Mercedes to the Timespan, where she delights tourists (many of whom come
specially to catch a glimpse of her) by signing autographs beside her
dummy. Then she totters across to La Mirage.
Nancy Sinclair is aware that the rest of the country might find her
village's apparent Cartland obsession a little peculiar, but says:
''Anything that brings in people is good. There's a great deal of extra
trade in the restaurant in August when she's here''.
Indeed, for someone who's mostly famous for being old, Cartland has
rejuvenated and revivified this Twin Peaks-like village. What next, one
wonders: a Barbara Cartland theme park? Maybe my nightmare of seeing
pink elephants is about to come true.

THE Scottish Clothes Show-Show has highlighted that Scotland has no
shortage of talented, young, Scottish designers. However, if Scottish
designers and garment manufacturers are to benefit from this potential
resource they must develop better links with both the London-centric
fashion industry and design education.
The Scottish fashion industry must adopt a collaborative approach with
the national fashion industry. By rejecting adversarial culture it will
be better able to generate the growth in local industry that is vital if
it is to prevent the exporting of these talented designers.
This inclusive approach has also been pinpointed by the Royal Society
of Arts' inquiry, Tomorrow's Company, recently unveiled, as that which
British industry in general should be approaching if it is to achieve
sustainable growth.
The schools of design are already collaborating to launch a national
initiative aimed at greater links between design education and industry.
Industrial Design Education Action for Scotland (IDEAS) is being
developed for launch in October. Its aims include the establishment of a
strategic approach to collaboration and research in design to enable the
formation of strategies.
Ultimately it will provide design manufacturing industries with the
opportunity to liaise with institutions offering design courses,
creating a plan of action which identifies the requirements of industry
for designers who are graduating.
Undoubtedly, the fashion show and initiatives like IDEAS are
increasing Scotland's design education profile. However it is clear that
only through a national (perhaps ultimately European) partnership
between the fashion industry and design education will Scotland maximise
the resource its talented young designers represent.

THE photograph, The Tartan Army, had to be seen to be believed (June
19).
To describe the student designers as stepping out in style was an
exaggeration indeed. If this is a sample of the seven Scottish colleges'
work in design, it leaves one speechless. My first thought was that
Hallowe'en had come early.
The ill-fitting tartan garments and the unlaced tackety boots no doubt
covered handsome young men and lovely girls but what haute couture of
the future will be like, beggars description.

MUCH has been made recently over the decision by the Labour Party to,
finally, take action over the alleged abuses of power within Monklands.
However, it is worth remembering that Monklands District Council will
cease to exist after March 31 next year and so the electoral damage to
the Labour Party within that area has been minimised due to the fact
that the unitary authority election has already been held.
It is also worth recalling that the Labour Party have had access to
most of the information contained within the report by Professor Black
for almost two years and yet many of these same councillors were passed
by the Labour Party as suitable candidates for the unitary council
elections in April of this year.
Abuse of power has become the trademark of the Labour Party at local
government level and it will take more than the suspension of a few
councillors to eradicate what has been inbred for many years.
For example, despite the claims of a brave new Labour, we are still
witnessing the same old antics with the Falkirk Unitary Council.
The denial of democratic proportionality for opposition SNP members
within the Executive Committee, the rejection of the right to have
dissent registered and the refusal of accept a named substitute for the
one place offered to the opposition within the Executive have led me to
the belief that while Labour have jettisoned socialism they most
certainly have retained their hunger for absolute power.
The saddest part of all is that Labour's main reformer within
Scotland, George Robertson, MP, has been made aware of these facts and,
to date, has failed to condemn the actions of his party representatives
within this authority.

Cannes
LABOUR leader Tony Blair waded into the convulsed Tories last night,
accusing them of allowing their disarray over Europe to damage Britain's
standing in the world.
Mr Blair, in Cannes for a summit of EU socialist groups, told a
television audience that the Tories were engaged in ''duplicity and
double-dealing and intrigue and hypocrisy of an enormous order'' as they
sought to resolve their leadership crisis.
He later told reporters: ''Unless we can restore a strong sense of
direction, it is Britain which will be the loser.''
He made a point of standing back from questions about who would
challenge the Prime Minister as Tory leader, claiming he was more
concerned at the damage the Conservative crisis was causing in Britain.
''My point is that, as the Conservative Party becomes increasingly
ungovernable and indeed unfit to govern because of its divisions, it is
essential that the Labour Party does not either become complacent or
simply sit there revelling in the spectacle, but puts forward a clear
agenda for the future of Britain that represents the voice of the
British people,'' Mr Blair said.
''The Conservative Party has become to me, at any rate, increasingly a
mystery, and what will happen over the next few days I cannot say. What
is important is that the interests of Britain are not any more damaged
by these fundamental divisions, that certainty and clarity are restored
to the conduct of our Government, for the sake of Government and our
country.''
Sounding almost Euro-sceptic on the thorny question of future European
integration, Mr Blair -- who has been accused to stealing Conservative
clothes on the issue -- said Labour was in agreement with the European
socialists on the way forward for the European Union.
''We agree where the national veto must remain in matters like defence
and security,'' he said.
His contribution to the socialist summit brought praise from Germany's
Social Democrat leader, Mr Rudolf Scharping, who told reporters that all
European socialists hoped Mr Blair would soon be Britain's Prime
Minister.
''Then we will have a partner who will bring Britain and Europe closer
together,'' he said, adding that Mr Blair would not ''use Europe as a
kind of doormat''.
Mr Major arrives this afternoon for the summit which, if he loses his
premiership, will be his last big EU occasion. Diplomats were at pains,
however, to deny reports that the British summit team led by Mr Major
and Mr Douglas Hurd, who has said he will quit in the summer as Foreign
Secretary, was a ''dead duck delegation''.
Mr Major could still capture the prize of moving forward the peace
process in Northern Ireland. Tomorrow, he will hold bilateral talks with
Mr John Bruton, the Irish Prime Minister -- attending his first EU
summit -- who is reportedly putting pressure on Sinn Fein to coax the
IRA into decommissioning some weaponry.
Mr Bruton was reticent about plans yesterday, saying only: ''We want
to move the peace process forward and to advance the start of all-party
talks.''
British-Irish bilateral discussions on Northern Ireland are now a
fixture at EU summits -- where the peace process began -- and Mr Major's
domestic stock would rise he if could take credit for breaking the
decommissioning deadlock.
Mr Bruton is said to be seeking at least a token handover of IRA
weaponry to the Irish Republic's armed forces so that all-party talks
can begin at last, almost a year after the IRA ceasefire.
Sinn Fein's hardening opposition to decommissioning in recent days has
alarmed Mr Major and Mr Bruton. Mr Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein deputy
to Mr Gerry Adams, said in Brussels four days ago that even the
slightest token decommissioning gesture would be a ''surrender'' and
could destroy the peace.
EU leaders are braced for a French initiative from President Jacques
Chirac, also attending his first summit as French leader, who is anxious
to make his mark as chairman. He is expected to back up his election
promises on tackling unemployment with a package of suggested measures.
However, Mr Chirac will be embarrassed by his country standing
condemned by some of those round his table today for his decision to
resume nuclear testing in the South Pacific.
Socialist leaders including Mr Blair and some who will be leading
national delegations at the summit yesterday demanded a French change of
mind on the decision to carry out eight tests between September and May.
Britain will be at odds with its EU partners on the issue of Europol,
the fledgling cross-border EU police agency set up in The Hague to
combat international drug trafficking and organised crime.
Mr Major does not want the EU's Court of Justice in Luxembourg to have
any role, preferring to keep judicial involvement for domestic courts.
However, Britain is in a minority on the issue, with possible support
from only Denmark and Sweden.
In London today, Mr Major will address a ceremony to mark the 50th
anniversary of the United Nations.
The signing of the San Francisco Treaty on June 26, 1945, will be
commemorated at Westminster Hall with full pomp and splendour to
underline the importance the Government attaches to the UN in the
current climate of world instability.
In a foreword to the official programme, the Prince of Wales says the
UN is unique as a forum for ''building a sense of common responsibility
for the world's resources, for the rule of law and the human rights of
men and women, and for the promotion of social and economic
development''.
UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali praises Britain's steadfast
commitment to the work of the UN and pays tribute to the 81 British
personnel killed on UN operations.
Britain was one of the original 51 founder members of the UN and
retains a permanent place on the Security Council. It is the sixth
largest contributor, with a budget of around #31m.

A HIGH-rolling political punter has bet #6000 on John Major leading
his party into the next General Election, it was revealed yesterday. As
a result bookmaker William Hill shortened Mr Major's odds in the Tory
leadership contest from 4-6 to 1-2.
The #6000 stake from an unnamed credit client is the biggest bet taken
since the books opened when Mr Major resigned as party leader.
William Hill has taken other bets on John Major leading the Tories of
#1000 and #2200.
The odds on Welsh Secretary John Redwood have been cut from 33-1 to
25-1 amid growing speculation that he intends to put himself forward as
a leadership candidate. Michael Heseltine is at 5-2, Michael Portillo
6-1, and both Kenneth Clarke and Gillian Shephard are 16-1.
However, Norman Lamont appears to be a rank outsider. Just #47 in bets
have been taken for the former Chancellor, whose odds are 66-1.
William Hill spokesman Mr Graham Sharpe said people who bet on
political events generally knew what they were doing. ''They're the best
informed punters of the lot,'' he said. ''They're much shrewder than
most people who bet on horses, and don't make a habit of throwing their
money away.''
He added: ''All the big bets have been for John Major, but you'd
expect that this early in the contest.''

DESPAIR turned to joy for 250 twitchers at the weekend as a ghostly
shape emerged from the mist on Orkney. The rare bird watchers had all
but given up hope of spotting the pallid harrier they had travelled from
all over Britain to see.
After driving through the night from as far away as Devon, they had
caught the early morning ferry from John O'Groats and then spent hours
peering into the gloom through telescopes and binoculars.
By lunchtime, most were sitting in deep depression on the side of a
remote moorland road.
Then a shout went up and they stampeded along the road to get a
glimpse of one of the rarest birds of prey ever seen in Britain.
Mobbed by curlews, the slim, pale bird zig-zagged along the valley
below the road as the twitchers shouted directions to each other and
smiled for the first time that day.
''We're on a high,'' said Mr Gerry Owens, 39, of Grangemouth. ''For a
lot of people here -- me included -- this is a once in a lifetime
experience, so we're well chuffed.''
Mr Ally White, 40, of Greengairs, Lanarkshire, added: ''I've been here
for hours, I've run out of fags, and I'm knackered. It just suddenly
appeared then disappeared into the mist again. It looked like a ghost
and it's a sight I'll never forget.''
Pallid harriers are normally found on the Steppes of central Asia and
have been seen in Britain on only seven previous occasions.
Mr Eric Meek, Orkney's Royal Society for the Protection of Birds
officer, said: ''I'm relieved that it put in an appearance. You don't
want to see people spending an awful lot of money to get here and then
have to go away disappointed.''

<TEXT>
ONE of the men at the heart of the Conservative Party establishment
yesterday warned Prime Minister John Major that ''he may have a shock''
in the leadership battle.
MP David Evans, a member of the highly influential backbench 1922
Committee executive -- the so-called ''men in grey suits'' -- said Mr
Major could not take his vote for granted.
Mr Evans, in an interview with BBC1's On the Record programme,
insisted he had not been present at Thursday's meeting of the executive
when Mr Major's leadership re-election bid was disclosed.
Following that meeting, committee chairman Sir Marcus Fox announced
that all 18 members of the executive would be signing Mr Major's
nomination papers in a demonstration of solidarity.
However, Mr Evans, who claimed he was one of two executive members not
at the meeting, said Sir Marcus had no right to speak for him.
''I don't like people putting my name forward without asking me,'' he
said. ''I am quite prepared to say that I will not be endorsing the PM's
candidacy.''
Asked if Mr Major could take his vote for granted, he replied:
''Absolutely not.''
He said his gut feeling was that Mr Major could be beaten in a
contest.
''MPs now have the opportunity, which the PM has given them, to say:
'Can we win with this man? Can we win with this Government?'
''And if they come to the conclusion that they can't win with this
man, they can't win with this Government . . . he may have a shock,'' Mr
Evans said.
Campaign managers for Mr Major yesterday remained cagey about
discussing the number of firm pledges of support they have received.
They refused to be drawn on specifics but said steady support
continued to come into his campaign headquarters at Cowley Street,
Westminster, following an initial surge.
Transport Secretary and leading campaign figure Brian Mawhinney
predicted that the Prime Minister would ''win big'' if it came to a
leadership contest.
However, many backbench MPs put the lack of detail down to more
sinister reasons than the fact that no challenge has yet been declared.
''There is a lot of lying going on,'' said one MP, who asked not to be
named.
Backbenchers were more than usually reluctant to place their views on
record but there was no shortage of off-the-record speculation about the
Prime Minister's chances of victory.
Another MP said: ''Cowley Street are in a frenzy of phoning round but
I am getting the impression people are rather over-estimating the
support he has got.''
It is widely expected that at least 30 hardliners -- and probably more
-- would vote against Mr Major, but dozens more dissatisfied with his
leadership may abstain.
If the number of abstentions takes the non-Major vote much above 100
of the 329 MPs entitled to take part, the Prime Minister is in serious
trouble.

THE Government is expected to give the go-ahead for the withdrawal of
all British forces from Bosnia by the end of September unless a
miraculous diplomatic settlement to the 38-month war can be found,
according to senior military sources.
A decision will be taken within the next four to six weeks to begin
the mammoth task of extricating almost 10,000 men and hundreds of
vehicles before the onset of winter traps them deep in the mountains of
central Bosnia until next spring.
It will follow the rubber-stamping later this week by alliance leaders
of a Nato contingency plan for withdrawal. Up to 60,000 Nato soldiers,
including 25,000 US combat troops, are to be deployed to cover the
retreat to the Croatian coast.
Staff officers from each of Britain's six military districts and a few
hand-picked officers on the reserve list have already been placed on
alert to cover key posts at the headquarters of UK Land Forces in
Wiltshire when the pull-out order comes.
This will free planning, logistics, and intelligence experts to
oversee the operation in the former Yugoslavia. A number of these
officers will be flown out to air bases in Italy and to a command ship
-- probably the aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious -- off the Adriatic
coast.
A source said last night: ''Considerable pressure has been exerted to
get the Government to make up its mind. Politicians are only just
becoming aware of the immense difficulties of moving thousands of men,
armoured and tracked vehicles, and other equipment over a road system
which is little short of a nightmare in summer and often impassable in
winter.
''The simple choice is leaving isolated garrisons at the mercy of the
Serbs and others throughout the winter or pulling them out before the
weather closes in. From September onwards, even air support would be
doubtful. Cloud cover blankets the areas of greatest conflict.
''The British troops already in Bosnia as part of the United Nations
Protection Force are extremely vulnerable at any time. The recent
hostage-taking demonstrated that fact. In winter, without fighter-bomber
cover and with movement limited to a few, easily blocked roads, they
would be totally helpless.
''They could still be withdrawn by helicopter in winter but at
considerable risk. That would also involve the unacceptable option of
destroying tens of millions of pounds-worth of vehicles and equipment to
prevent them falling into hostile hands.
''The decision to despatch 24 Airmobile Brigade, armoured engineers,
artillery, and 70-plus helicopters two weeks ago was the first step
towards a covered disengagement.
''Anyone looking at the composition of the force can see what it was
intended to achieve. It has not been put there to protect convoys. Its
function is to protect troops falling back down difficult and dangerous
mountain roads. Its capabilities are high mobility and striking power
combined with the combat engineering potential to repair roads and
bridges under fire if necessary.
''The stark reality is that we are running rapidly out of time to
implement withdrawal this year. It would take two months minimum from
the green light to completion. The logistical problems are enormous,
even if the Serbs decide not to contest withdrawal.''
A joint Franco-British planning cell has been working at UKLF
headquarters since last year on plans to extricate the peacekeepers of
both nations if necessary. The UK and France are the largest
contributors of troops for the UN mission in Bosnia.
A 100-strong reconnaissance detachment of 24 Airmobile Brigade flew
into Split in Croatia last week to pave the way for the arrival of the
other 5400 members of the unit.
They were preceded by 1000 men drawn from the UK and Germany equipped
with helicopter-portable artillery guns and armoured engineer vehicles
specialising in mine clearance and combat repairs to roads and bridges.
When the entire force arrives over the next few weeks, it will deploy
two additional infantry battalions, a regiment of artillery, additional
engineers, and about 70 to 80 transport and attack helicopters.
About 2600 British servicemen are currently based in Bosnia, with a
further 700 to 800 in supply and support roles within Croatia. Almost
10% of the force consists of engineers. There are also two mechanised
infantry battalions equipped with 30-ton Warrior fighting vehicles.

DESPITE much talk of his chilly demeanour, lack of smalltalk, and
over-intellectual approach to politics, Mr John Redwood should not be
underestimated.
The Secretary of State for Wales is highly intelligent, clear-minded,
and speaks lucidly. His speeches are usually sharp and classy and he is
a good Commons performer, although he certainly does not disguise the
fact that he does not think much of the calibre of Opposition.
Initially, he may have delayed voicing his unqualified public support
for Mr Major more out of distaste for lining up with the Cabinet chorus
of approval which, in some cases, it is hard to believe were totally
sincere.
Reactions over the weekend must have driven him to realise that he
would be by far the most dangerous first ballot antagonist for the Prime
Minister -- not because he is a popular figure in the party, which he is
not, but because he is a substantial one and in the Cabinet.
His weekend deliberations may have convinced him that his delay in
rallying to the Prime Ministerial standard may, in any case, cost him
his Cabinet place. There is the danger from his point of view, indeed
the likelihood, that a good performance by him could end up giving the
Tory leadership to Michael Heseltine.
However, with a strong showing, he would have beaten Mr Portillo as
the leading figure on the right perhaps with a claim on the Treasury,
the job he most wants apart from No 10 in a Heseltine Government.
One of the Cabinet's three ''bastards'', as Mr Major memorably, if
inadvertently, publicly branded his right-wing critics, he has used his
position in Wales -- one of the Cinderella departments of state -- to
pursue post-Thatcherite ideas with vigour. He recently made a series of
speeches seeking to redefine Conservatism's role in the future.
Since becoming Welsh Secretary two years ago, he has successfully
frozen the expansion of health service bureaucracy and helped to provide
more places at the best Welsh schools.
He struck a chord with many party activists by criticising the
benefits system for encouraging girls to become single mothers. He also
let Tory MPs know that he had opposed raising VAT on domestic fuel from
8% to 15% in Cabinet before Tory rebels managed to block it in the
Commons.
He was born in 1951, the son of a deputy company secretary and a shop
manageress from Dover. Before going up to Oxford, he attended fee-paying
Kent College in Canterbury and has been an active Conservative since the
age of 15.
He was an investment advisor on the board of N M Rothschild, where he
met Margaret Thatcher during a visit in 1978. She was impressed and in
1983 he became head of her policy unit at 10 Downing Street where he was
influential in pushing radical policies, at one time gaining the
nickname among Tory wets of ''The Pol Pot of Privatisation''.
He is a hard-liner on law and order, maintaining his support for the
death penalty despite evidence in recent years of errors in trials for
crimes which were previously capital. He argued that the prospect of
accused being hanged would ''concentrate the minds'' of both police and
juries.
He is scandal-free. His wife, Gail, is company secretary for British
Airways and they have a son and a daughter in their teens.
He does not lack a sense of humour, although it is not the
joke-cracking kind. If teased about his nickname, The Vulcan, after Star
Treck's super-rational Mr Spock, he will reply: ''Well, it's time to
return to my UFO.''
As far as the Major campaign is concerned, he is an identified flying
object they may not have moved swiftly enough to neutralise.
If many think he lacks political personality, one supporter yesterday
suggested he had more than Mr Major and that, like Lady Thatcher, would
be seen more clearly as a substantial politician the higher he climbed.

IT is unfortunate that A T Katte in his response to my letter has
based his defence of John MacCalman's article on a book published 79
years ago (June 9).
Research into early transport history has moved on a bit since then,
and much more is now known of the early days of railways and tramways.
The Guinness Book of Rail Facts and Feats is entirely based on verified
facts, not hearsay, and indeed it is now known that it was not James
Outram who introduced iron flanged rails or ''plates'', but a John Curr
of Durham in 1787, as viewer for the Duke of Norfolk's collieries at
Sheffield.
The first recorded use of the work ''tramroad'' is in the minutes of
the Brecon and Abergavenny Canal Company, in South Wales, in 1798.
I have been a lifelong tram enthusiast, and remember the Glasgow trams
with great affection, but although the idea of Glasgow giving the word
''tram'' to the world may have local appeal, well-researched historical
facts clearly indicate otherwise.

You report a case of health and safety contravention by one of the
country's prominent building contractors with an otherwise exemplary
safety record (June 21). The report mentions that the work on site was
six weeks behind and there was pressure to get it back on schedule.
Recently three men were killed on a building site in Dundee.
Allegations were made that the contractors were behind and were trying
to get back on programme.
In recent years the shortage of work available for design teams and
contractors has been so marked that, grateful for any work, those
concerned have accepted clients' programming requirements even when
these have been impossibly tight. Those responsible for procuring
building projects must now be made aware that adequate time must be
allowed for design teams to carry out their pre-contract work properly
and contractors for building.

Cannes
THE Government found itself in more Euro-trouble last night, this time
from outside the party.
Denials that it misused European aid in Scotland by spending it to
fatten up public utilities ahead of privatisation have been found
unsatisfactory by the European Commission.
Mrs Monika Wulf-Mathies, regional aid Commissioner, launched an
investigation earlier this year into possible misuse of #93m from the
Commission in Scottish projects.
The money, part of a larger UK package, was meant to help the
development of areas in need.
Much of it was spent over a four-year period on BT, electricity and
gas industries, airports, shipping ports, and buses.
Mrs Wulf-Mathies told The Herald at the EU summit in Cannes last
night: ''We have had a reply from the British Government with which I am
not content.''
She said the Government had responded by simply sending a list of
privatised utilities on which the money had been spent. The Commission
wanted more information so that it could be sure the money had been used
to achieve the desired objectives laid down under EU structural funding
requirements.
The aid at issue is from the European Regional Development Fund
(ERDF). EU rules stipulate it is illegal to use ERDF funding simply to
fatten public utilities for sale. If the Government is held to have
broken the rules it could have to repay the money.
Mrs Wulf-Mathies launched her investigation after a similar inquiry
was ordered by former Scottish Secretary, Mr Bruce Millan, her
predecessor, in his final act as a Commissioner.
Mr Millan wanted to known how #3m of European funding was used in the
privatisation of ClydePort and how other money was used in the sale of
assets in four new towns. The Scottish Office and ClydePort denied
misusing the money.
Labour's Arlene McCarthy, party regional policy spokesman in the
European Parliament, has accused the Government and Scottish Office of a
''clear misuse'' of funding because the money was spent in a way which
did not help jobs. She said #400m worth of Euro-aid throughout Britain
was involved.
She was backed by Labour's Peter Crampton, who said the money had
boosted profits and gone towards ''outlandish'' salaries for managers in
privatised utilities while the jobs of ordinary people were lost.
''We know this was done, the Government has admitted it,'' Mr Crampton
said. ''What we want to know now is if it was an illegal act.''
Mrs Wulf-Mathies said: ''I hope we can resolve this matter by the end
of the year. There will be further discussions.''
She made it clear the Commission did not bar the use of structural
funding in privatisations. However, the money had to be spent in a way
which genuinely gave public benefit and did not conflict with EU
competition law. It should not be used simply for fattening-up purposes.
''We shall be asking the British Government to give us some further
information to clarify the situation. We shall report the result to the
European Parliament,'' she said.
Under EU rules, money which is held to have been ''grossly'' misused
for other than its original purpose must be repaid to the Commission.

THERE is something deeply unnerving about shadow boxing. The
one-and-only contender stands there, thrashing away at insubstantial air
while endeavouring all the time to convey the impression of resolute
effectiveness. The inevitable impulse for the onlooker is to giggle, but
there is nothing funny about the position in which Prime Minister and
would-be pugilist Mr John Major finds himself. He is doing his best, of
course, in a situation of conflict which he has allowed to develop over
many months and in a leadership competition which he initiated and which
is about to enter a new and more testing phase. His tactics in the
absence of a challenger have been fairly predictable, apart from his
lamentable error at the weekend when he spoke coarsely and dismissively
of moves to a single European currency. That will not have endeared him
to Tory Europhiles who will be alarmed at his willingness to express
those views to a large and private meeting of Tory local leaders.
Nevertheless, by yesterday afternoon he was the epitome of tough
pragmatism. No, he would not rule out a single currency in principle
because, in any case, our Maastricht veto was still in place. No, he
would not help the many thousands of impoverished householders with
negative equity because that would be unfair to others. Neither of these
opinions will endear him to the right-wingers in the party, but he
probably believes that they are past convincing anyway.
The point is that it is not just right-wingers who must be wooed by Mr
Major but, and this is his principal task, the panic-stricken on the
back benches. It is true that the interlinked issues of Europe and Mr
Major's chronic indecisiveness are the main reasons for the current
mess, but his survival will rest on the assessment by those in wobbly
seats as to who will be the best leader to keep them in those seats. To
say this is not to be overly cynical about politicians; after all, what
is the practical usefulness of being an ex-MP? Yet Mr Major's
unwillingness to help beleaguered home-owners will not have impressed
Tory MPs who see home-owners as their natural constituency and who will
need every vote they can get in a General Election.
None of this answers the question of the identity of Mr Major's
challenger or challengers, although it seems likely that Mr Lamont and
Mr Redwood will make statements today. Hard as it is to agree with
anything that Mr Edward Leigh MP might say, he does have a point when he
insists that any leadership election should be a serious one and not a
sham. By that he means that Mr Major should be confronted by a colleague
of sufficient weight to make a real contest in which a decent debate can
be aired and viable options offered to the party. Mr Leigh's own
preference is for Mr Redwood but, failing that, he will be happy to
support Mr Lamont. Mr Redwood's current position is intriguing. He has
allowed himself over the weekend to be advanced to the position of
senior putative challenger when he could have ended speculation by a
brief but definite statement of support for the Prime Minister. This he
has not done, thereby making it clear that he is at least thinking about
running, and thereby also doing himself no good at all if Mr Major
should win. On balance he would be unwise to run, but Mr Lamont does not
impress as a serious candidate. From courageous beginnings this election
affair is beginning to look distinctly ragged and there is nothing that
anybody can do about knitting up the loose ends until the battle is
over.

THE mist was clearing over London and the forecast promised a glorious
day. But a sadness descended over the breakfast table as I read the
obituary of Group Captain Peter Townsend, the man who should have
married Princess Margaret more than 40 years ago.
As the story was retold for a new generation -- and those of us who
knew it were trying to reconcile the missing years -- I remembered
another morning in this same St Ermin's Hotel, 22 years before, when I
finished a similar breakfast and went to dress myself as I had never
been dressed before.
In top hat and tails, as if ready for a Fred Astaire musical, I then
casually walked the half-mile to Westminster Abbey, through crowds who
had camped out all night to see the morning bride. Princess Anne would
be there to meet her bridegroom, Captain Mark Phillips, as the first of
the Queen's children to marry.
At the Abbey door I had teamed up with colleague Jean Rook and
together we would paint a word picture of the ceremony for our readers
next morning.
There was enough pomp and deep emotion to seal a union for ever; or so
you would have thought. Yet that marriage disintegrated in a manner
which would become all too familiar in the House of Windsor.
So the ritual was repeated for Prince Charles and Prince Andrew and
the damage to the monarchy is recent enough for all to know.
Now, as I strolled to Westminster once more, pausing by the Abbey
door, my thoughts went back to Princess Margaret.
My first editor, Donald Noble, liked to recall one of his early jobs
as a reporter on the Dundee Courier -- waiting outside Glamis Castle,
that August day of 1930, to break the news that Princess Margaret Rose
had been born.
Fifteen years later I came face to face with the young lady during a
Scout inspection at Dyce Airport and realised, from my 6ft height, not
only how tiny she was but what a flash of life came burning in those
eyes.
It was much later before we actually spoke -- at a party in Singapore,
where I breezed in from a jungle adventure in Malaysia and began to
learn about her lively wit, her skill on the piano, and her capacity for
fun.
In the years between, she had fallen in love with her father's
equerry, Peter Townsend, a dashing hero of the Battle of Britain, one of
Churchill's ''few'' and a young man of impeccable character.
Who better for the royal princess? Except that he had figured in a
divorce, albeit as the innocent party who sued over his wife's adultery
and gained custody of their two sons. He had done no wrong.
But that passionate romance, nurtured across a number of years, was
doomed to failure, outlawed by the weight of an establishment typified
by the awsome figure of the Queen's Private Secretary, Sir Alan
Lascelles, who warned off Townsend with the words: ''You must either be
mad or bad.''
Peter Townsend was neither. If he had been less of a gentleman he
would have told the silly old coot where to get off. Or perhaps jogged
him more gently with something like: ''How about Cupid, stupid?''
In the end he was virtually sent into exile and the Princess,
bombarded with reminders that Christian marriage was indissoluble and
that she would be largely ostracised, made her heart-rending
announcement of October 1955 that she was putting duty before personal
feelings and would not be marrying Group Captain Townsend.
So ended a beautiful love story. And all for what? In time, along came
another suitor, Antony Armstrong-Jones, a man without impediment to
royal marriage, -- except that his union with Princess Margaret was to
end on the matrimonial scrapheap.
Anything that could happen to Aunt Margaret now became the pattern for
her nephews and niece in more direct line to the throne.
Yet, in throwing scorn on the establishment for destroying a
potentially happy marriage, the rest of us face one uncomfortable fact,
illustrating clearly the social revolution which has overtaken this
country.
Whereas today we would uphold Princess Margaret's right to marry the
love of her life, the majority opinion of 40 years ago was almost
certainly that what she was doing was right.
From the wreckage of her marriage, the lady herself proceeded to a
quiet and dignified life, no doubt with many a late-night sob for the
man who should have been beside her.
He, in turn, behaved with equal dignity. No rushing off to the nearest
tabloid with royal revelations to titillate the sleaze-buds. (In that
respect at least we could learn a lesson from bygone days.) Just a later
marriage, spent at exiled distance, and eventually a fatal illness which
was borne with customary dignity.
Now he's gone, the romance already part of history. It was all in my
thoughts as I reached Westminster and repaired to the terrace for a
glass of wine with Lord Carmichael. Familiar faces were out enjoying the
summer warmth as well as the gossip of the House.
Not one of them, however, had anticipated that another piece of
history's jigsaw was about to jump into place. MrMajor's step did seem
particularly purposeful that morning. But he managed to guard his secret
for another 24 hours.

THE United Nations is 50 years old today. It has easily outlived its
original model, the League of Nations, founded after the First World War
but crippled by the 1930s. The League was weakened from its inception by
the non-membership of the United States (despite its being President
Wilson's idea) and by later defections from countries like Japan and
Germany which were unwilling to accept its hostility to international
aggression. The UN has been far more successful in that it has not
suffered defections: the 51 states which founded it by the San Francisco
Treaty of June 26, 1945, have been augmented by others, partly in
response to the creation of independent states following the liquidation
of the European empires, so that there are now 185 members. Its main
troubles are not the threat of defection but the unwillingess of some
countries to meet their financial obligations, the main culprit being
the United States which is vital to the organisation's success but is
deeply in the red in its UN account.
Mr Boutros Ghali, the present Secretary-General, has called for a
rekindling of the spirit which conceived the organisation and
characterised its earliest years. Such a revival is hardly likely. It is
not so much that the world is more cynical, though international opinion
is, possibly, more realistic. It was not devoid of a sense of reality,
and especially not of realpolitik, in 1945. The Great Powers' special
place was recognised in their dominance of the Security Council and
their permanent membership, as well as in their possession of the power
of veto. The UN's ability to compel peace by declaration, and keep peace
by ad hoc international volunteer force, has also long been exposed as
an illusion, witness its agony in Bosnia. Nor can majority resolutions
of the General Assembly settle much -- indeed they have been devalued by
the way in which they have been far more likely to demonstrate group
prejudice than sound or objective judgment (as a quick glance at the
history of resolutions affecting the Middle East would show at once). In
such matters not too much is expected of it. That it is a talking shop
should not be to its disadvantage when there is always much to be said
for talking about international affairs. It is the only world talking
shop and, now that global problems are steadily growing in numbers and
significance, it will become ever more important to achieve a consensus
among governments on how to deal with issues which transcend
internatioanl boundaries and cannot simply be settled by reference to
any one state's national interest. Global warming and oceanic pollution
are examples of this sort of problem, though the convening of special
world conferences is an alternative way to considering such challenges.
The UN's advantage over that approach is, however, that it already
exists and is a permanent body with an agreed structure from which no
state is excluded.
There are aspects which are not potential but extant: the real
achievement of the UN lies in its specialised agencies and their
undramatic but indispensable role in areas, for example, like world
health and provision for refugees. These cost a lot of money, and
finance is one of the UN's worst problems, that and its internal
efficiency. These are well enough known but one other weakness is its
slowness to change. It is time, for example, that the membership of the
Security Council was reconsidered with a view to making the likes of
Japan and India permanent members and rolling the British and French
membership into one for Europe which would give the Germans a share in a
direct say. Reform is always life enhancing, and at 50 the UN might
benefit from a tonic.

From STEPHEN WEEKS, Athens, Sunday
DEEP divisions are re-emerging in Greece over the deposed monarchy,
prompted by the ''royal'' wedding of ousted Crown Prince Pavlos in
London this week.
While the Greek socialist government fumes, European royalty is
preparing to descend en masse for the July 1 marriage at the Greek
Orthodox Cathedral in London.
Pavlos, 28, a former British army officer who starts work soon for a
US shipping firm, will marry Marie-Chantal Miller, 26, the American
daughter of a British millionaire.
The Greek monarchy was abolished in a 1974 referendum but the royal
fanfare being drummed up around the wedding of the ''Crown Prince''
suggests that hopes may linger for a restoration of King Constantine.
''The ex-king is definitely using this wedding to present himself as
the King of the Hellenes. His goal is to claim his right to the throne.
This is unacceptable,'' said Socialist MP Evangelos Yannopoulos.
King Juan Carlos and Queen Sophia of Spain, Pavlos's aunt and uncle,
will attend. The royal houses from Denmark, Sweden, and Jordan will also
fly in.
Royal-watchers are whispering about the representation from the house
of Windsor, which has direct blood ties to the defunct Greek royal
family.
A member of the ex-king's entourage said the Duke of Edinburgh and the
Prince of Wales would attend, and hinted that the Queen might join them.
Despite King Constantine's protests that this is a simple family
affair which need not worry the Athens government, all signs are to the
contrary.
A private Greek television station will broadcast the wedding live,
and 49 Greek and international channels have signed up to cover it.
About 2500 people, including dozens of Greek MPs, have been invited.
Some 500 will pack the church and 2000 others will watch the wedding
live on giant screens.
Word that a number of conservative MPs would attend has set off a
storm of protest.
''The former king is trying to use this wedding to create a political
issue and we are not going to assist him,'' said Apostolos Kaklamanis,
Socialist president of Parliament.
The government says that attending the wedding is tantamount to
questioning the validity of the new republic set up in 1974.
Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos, who denounced the former
royal family as ''museum pieces'', accused Constantine of milking the
wedding for his own designs and said flatly that the ''monarchy issue is
closed''.
He also slammed the door on any plans Pavlos and his young bride might
have to honeymoon in Greece, saying: ''The government will not allow any
member of the former royal family to enter Greece.''
Diplomats in Athens said the strong reaction to the ex-King reflected
just how sensitive the country remained to events surrounding the
colonels' coup in 1967 and their fall in 1974.
''These are turbulent times in the Balkans and anything can happen.
The King has made it clear on several occasions that he wants to remind
the Greek public he is still around,'' said an EU diplomat.--Reuter.

From NICHOLAS KOTCH, Addis Ababa, Sunday
THE Organisation of African Unity is making desperate efforts to
prevent Burundi from following its sister state Rwanda down the road to
genocide, a crisis underlined by the resignation of the country's
foreign minister.
The conflict between Tutsis and Hutus in Burundi was shaping up as the
top issue at the OAU summit opening in the Ethiopian capital tomorrow.
Burundi's Foreign Minister Jean-Marie Ngendahayo told Belgian radio
today that he had resigned because he had lost faith in the government's
ability to protect its citizens.
''I have resigned because I felt completely useless working within a
government that could not guarantee the most basic right, which is the
right to life for all Burundian citizens,'' he said.
The worsening bloodshed in the tiny central African state comes a year
after Hutu extremists massacred up to one million Tutsis and allied
Hutus in neighbouring Rwanda.
The OAU, like the rest of the world community, failed to intervene in
time to stop one of the century's greatest genocides. Some African
leaders appear determined not to fail again in Burundi.
''We are making desperate efforts, and I use the word desperate
deliberately, in an attempt to avoid the repetition of the catastrophe
that happened in Rwanda,'' said OAU secretary general Salim Ahmed Salim.
Salim wants the three-day summit to endorse his plans for a standing
African peacekeeping force, able to step in quickly before crisis turns
to carnage.
''Right now we are not equipped to mount a major peacekeeping
operation,'' he said.
Burundi is a test case for Salim's campaign. Tens of thousands of
people have died since October 1993, when Tutsi soldiers assassinated
the country's first democratically elected president, a Hutu.
In the Burundian capital Bujumbura today, aid workers said between 30
and 40 civilians had been killed by mortars fired by the Tutsi-led army
in a crackdown against Hutu militia groups.
The OAU is raising the number of its military observers in Burundi
from 47 to 67 but the group can do little more than monitor the daily
toll from tribal terrorism.
The UN Security Council has so far refused to send a peacekeeping
force.
''Our fear is total. There could be an explosion in Burundi,'' said
Rwanda's Foreign Minister Anastase Gasana.
''We are appealing to them to avoid the same catastrophe as us . . .
We are saying 'please, wasn't Rwanda's example enough for you? Do you
want to commit the same madness?' ''
The impunity of killers in Rwanda and Burundi prolongs the cycle of
revenge. Gasana accused all African countries, except Cameroon, of
abysmally failing in their international duty to apprehend genocide
suspects he called ''African Nazis''.
He said they were free to stroll in and out of African capitals,
notably Nairobi, while Western countries have arrested suspects ahead of
the international genocide tribunal which will try Rwanda's worst
criminals in Arusha, Tanzania.--Reuter.

Karachi, Sunday
AT LEAST 27 people were killed in Karachi today as violence and arson
paralysed Pakistan's southern city for a second day.
Police said 24 people were wounded in central, western, and eastern
Karachi and several vehicles were set on fire on the second day of a
three-day strike called by the opposition Mohajir National Movement
(MQM), locked in confrontation with Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's
government.
A rocket-propelled grenade was fired at the state television station
to coincide with the main evening news. It exploded outside the building
without causing damage.
Karachi commissioner Ziaul Islam told reporters at least five of the
dead were kidnapped and tortured. Their bodies, with hands tied on their
backs, were found in the central district.
Also among the dead were two doctors and former hockey player 0Muqeem
Khan, 45, younger brother of former Pakistani hockey captain Hanif Khan.
He was killed as he stopped to buy at a pavement stall in the central
district and a relative claimed he was hit by a bullet from a police
armoured vehicle.
Young militants roamed the streets firing in the air and forcing shops
to close.
The MQM called the strike in protest against the alleged gang-rape of
the sister of a party activist and the killing of a faction leader.
The government has ordered a judicial inquiry into the rape
allegation, which the MQM blamed on Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party
(PPP).
The PPP denied the charge and a police medical report said no signs of
rape were found on the girl's body.
Bomb hoaxes spread panic at newspaper offices, banks, and the Karachi
Stock Exchange, which suspended trading.
An MQM ultimatum last night gave the government 48 hours to arrest
those guilty of the two attacks, to release arrested activists, and to
find an MQM woman activist and a provincial MP who went missing earlier
this month.
MQM said that unless these demands were met by noon tomorrow, it would
announce further, unspecified action.
More than 800 people have been killed in ethnic, sectarian, and
political violence in Karachi this year, overtaking the total for the
whole of last year. The death toll for this month alone stands at more
than 200.
Bhutto blames much of the violence on the MQM, which is fighting for
the rights of Karachi's majority Mohajirs, or Urdu-speaking Muslims who
fled from India at partition in 1947.--Reuter.

Sarajevo, Sunday
A SHELL slammed into a grassy hill next to a playground in Sarajevo
tonight, killing three children and three adults and wounding four other
people.
Moments after the blast, a pair of slippers and some toys lay among
pools of blood, shattered glass, and bits of masonry beneath a
basketball hoop in the city's old town.
''I saw them carry two little girls away and they were ripped apart,''
said a woman in a building overlooking the play area.
Besides the six dead, two children and two adults were wounded in the
attack.
The uncle of one of the wounded girls helped doctors identify the
bodies of three dead children and three dead adults, all of whom lived
within a few yards of the blast.
''That's little Ljiljana from down the hall,'' said the man as he
pulled a blanket back from a teenage girl the right side of whose head
had been smashed by shrapnel.
''Get out, get out,'' a nurse screamed at reporters whom she had
invited in moments earlier. ''You bastards take pictures of this but it
doesn't make a f***ing difference to anybody in the world except us.''
Bosnian Serbs have besieged Sarajevo for 38 months and recently
resumed shelling civilian targets.
''This was intentional, this was a mortar called in by someone in the
city who told the Chetniks (Serbs) that the children were outside
playing,'' said Jadranko Skoric, whose 11-year-old daughter Maja was
wounded in the blast.
Other parents wailed in grief as they learned their children were
dead.
Police said a total of nine people were killed today and 30 wounded.
Five of the dead were children. A 16-year-old boy was killed and four
friends were wounded by a shell in the Dobrinja suburb and a boy on a
bicycle was shot dead by a sniper.
Tonight's shell landed less than 100yd from the Sarajevo market where
a mortar bomb killed 68 people in February last year. It led to the
creation of a heavy weapons exclusion zone around Sarajevo, but this has
collapsed since the UN abandoned arms depots run by Bosnian Serb
troops.--Reuter.

From ROS DAVIDSON San Francisco, Sunday
THE United Nations celebrated its 50th anniversary today amid concern
about its tattered finances and growing scepticism over its
effectiveness.
As dignitaries from around the world gathered for events commemorating
the signing of the UN Charter in San Francisco in the final days of the
Second World War, it was a time for reassessing the body's achievements
and future.
The anniversary was overshadowed by the perilous financial state of
the 185-nation body and by growing hostility towards the UN in the
Republican-led US Congress.
Madeleine Albright, US ambassador to the United Nations, said today
that a sustained effort to reform the UN was essential.
''Our goal must be a UN that wastes less and produces more, that is
free from the shackles of duplication,'' she told a conference drawing
up reform plans.
President Bill Clinton delivers the keynote speech tomorrow at a time
when US xenophobia is rising and many Americans want out of the UN
entirely.
An opinion poll published yesterday found that most Americans think
the UN is doing a good or fair job, but also believe that the US pays
more than its fair share of UN costs.
A strong majority also supported sending UN troops to help
peacekeepers under attack in Bosnia, but was against sending in US
troops.
The US is ironically the worst delinquent among member nations behind
in their annual UN budget contributions.
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali was today expected to say that
the UN was bankrupt and to press for nearly #1800m in arrears.
Only 48 of the 185 members are up to date with payments and as of May
31, with the US alone owing $1.2bn (#800m).
As it grew from its original 50 signatories to its current 185
members, the UN has seen a mushrooming of its staff and agencies,
leading to strong criticism in the US of bureaucracy, mismanagement, and
waste.
Boutros-Ghali said that action was being taken to tackle this problem,
adding that staff were being reduced and UN structures streamlined.
''New emphasis is being placed on doing more with less,'' he said.
Celebrations were set to culminate tomorrow, the anniversary of the
signing on June 26, 1945, with a ceremony attended by Clinton,
Boutros-Ghali, more than 150 UN ambassadors, and four Nobel Peace Prize
winners.
Today Archbishop Desmond Tutu and President Lech Walesa prayed for
world peace at San Francisco's Episcopalian cathedral.
Princess Margaret and Boutros-Ghali attended a concert by the Royal
Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Sir Yehudi Menuhin, who was brought
up in San Francisco.
Peace prize laureates, including Betty Williams and Oscar Arias,
debated the challenges of the next century.
Poet Maya Angelou, who spoke at Clinton's inauguration, is to unveil a
poem she has written for the occasion. Others are here to press their
own causes, such as Sir Peter Ustinov promoting world federalism.
The year-long commemoration is not over until October 24, the
anniversary of the charter's adoption, when a special session of the
General Assembly in New York will draw many world leaders. They will set
guidelines for the future of the UN, which was almost entirely an
American concept when founded.

THE Prime Minister's campaign team was last night braced for a battle
from within the Cabinet, with Welsh Secretary John Redwood believed
ready to throw his hat in the ring.
Such a move would blow apart Mr Major's strategy of a decisive first
ballot win over a ''stalking horse'' candidate.
Mr Redwood will make a statement on his intentions today: last night
he was keeping his own counsel at his Berkshire home while apparently
receiving several telephone calls from Major aides. A number of other
Cabinet Ministers have urged him not to stand.
Mr Redwood spent the day playing cricket. Standing in his driveway,
still wearing his cricket whites, the smiling Wokingham MP said: ''I've
had a great game of cricket with 237 runs to each side. It was a perfect
day and we had a wonderful time . . . I will be in good voice tomorrow
when I will talk about my plans for the future.''
The Prime Minister, during a television interview, had to admit he did
not know what these plans would be.
He said he would not be seeking to speak to him on the basis of
newspaper speculation but would be ''very surprised'' if Mr Redwood
opposed him. They had, he said, been discussing policy initiatives for
the Government earlier last week.
There were also indications that Mr Redwood and former Chancellor
Norman Lamont were in touch with each other, at least through
intermediaries, trying to decide whether two challengers might pull in
more votes against Mr Major or whether Mr Lamont should give Mr Redwood
a clear run if he decided to take the plunge.
One MP with no doubt about whether Mr Redwood should enter the contest
is the Isle of Wight's Barry Field. He has abandoned his expected
challenge to support the Welsh Secretary. Mr Field said he would be
meeting Mr Redwood today to urge him to enter the first round ballot.
Mr Major's team who, early on, were talking about a walkover with
either no contest or one against a fringe lightweight figure are now set
for a genuine fight.
More so as the Prime Minister refused to make more concessions to his
Euro-sceptic critics during a BBC TV On The Record interview. He would
not rule out Britain joining a single European currency during the
lifetime of the next parliament (1997 to, theoretically, 2002) and
failed to promise a referendum if the Cabinet decided to join, though he
did say ''it may very well be necessary''.
The time factor may also be working against Mr Major. If it had proved
possible to complete the election within seven days his victory would
have been assured. But, with 13 days between his throwing down the
gauntlet and the first ballot, opponents have been given time to rally.
Although still likely to win the first ballot by the required majority
of all Tory MPs plus a 15% lead over his nearest challenger failure to
do so could result in a further break in Cabinet ranks with other
Ministers standing in the second ballot. If more than 100 Tory MPs
refuse to support him, it could be difficult for him to hold on to
power.
The Prime Minister seemed tense during his television appearance which
saw him and interviewer John Humphreys frequently talking over each
other. At one point Mr Major said: ''I am going to tell you the
questions you should be asking.''
He made clear that speculation that he might be proposing action to
help home owners suffering from negative equity was misinformed. As the
Government was not planning to apply capital gains tax to those who sold
their homes at a profit, there was no case for tax help for those whose
homes had dropped in value, he said.
Indications that the leadership election will turn out a bruising one
publicly as well as privately piled up yesterday.
Former Prime Minister Sir Edward Heath launched ferociously dismissive
attacks on both the main potential challengers.
He said Mr Lamont should have resigned after Britain left the European
Exchange Rate Mechanism. ''But he did not carry out that honourable
course. He was a grossly incompetent Chancellor of the Exchequer.''
Of Mr Redwood he asked ''Who knows anything about him?'' And claimed:
''He has made blunders all over the place and in Wales he is
disrespected.''
Education Secretary Gillian Shephard said that on Thursday Mr Redwood
told her he would support Mr Major and ''I assume that is still his
position''. The Major team will use this reported pledge ruthlessly to
stress Mr Redwood is not a man of his word if he does stand.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, the National Heritage Secretary, said all the
Cabinet had given their support to Mr Major willingly.
Tory elder statesmen Lord Whitelaw forecast that it was ''absolutely
certain'' that the Tories would lose the next election if Mr Major were
challenged.
Others like Mr Edward Leigh, MP for Gainsborough, sacked as a junior
Minister by Mr Major, said the election would be ''a farce'' unless
there was a serious contest.
There was also an ominous sign from the heart of the Tory
establishment when a leading member of the back-bench 1922 Committee
warned that the Prime Minister could not take his support for granted.
MP David Evans said his gut feeling was that Mr Major could lose.
''MPs now have the opportunity which the PM has given them to say, 'Can
we win with this man? Can we win with this Government?' And if they come
to the conclusion that they can't win with this man, they can't win with
this Government . . . he may have a shock.''
Mr Major, meanwhile, firmly rejected Mr Lamont's claim that when
Chancellor he prevented the Prime Minister from agreeing to a treaty
obligation for Britain to sign up to a single currency at some point.
That was not the case he said. He had made clear to other European
leaders that he must have a British opt-out. ''Norman negotiated the
details,'' he added.
Several right-wing Euro-sceptics have given public backing to Mr
Major. Mr Michael Forsyth, MP for Stirling and a Home Office Minister,
has been helping at the Cowley Street campaign headquarters and calling
for any challenger to be given ''a bloody nose''.
He could become Scottish Secretary in a post-Major win reshuffle if Mr
Malcolm Rifkind succeeds Mr Douglas Hurd at the Foreign Office and is
followed at Defence by Mr Ian Lang, one of the Mr Major's key advisers.
Supporters of possible contenders like Mr Michael Heseltine or Mr
Michael Portillo are, at least publicly, in a state of suspended
animation. They are stymied unless Mr Major is badly hurt in the first
ballot.
Today Mr Major and Mr Hurd leave for the Euro Summit at Cannes where
some socialist participants were speculating that Mr Major might use the
conference for electioneering purposes.
Mr Tony Blair, attending a socialist leaders' conference along the
coast at Antibes, said the leadership contest would solve nothing as
long as the Tories remained bitterly divided about Europe with a large
section wanting to withdraw altogether from the EU.
Last night, the apparent division in the Cabinet was the main Tory
concern, with Ministers determined to do all they could to leave the
Welsh Secretary room to express unequivocal backing.
Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney said John Redwood ''is an
honourable man. He has indicated his support for the Prime Minister and
I am prepared to take him at his word.''

Nablus, Sunday
ISRAELI soldiers shot dead two Arab demonstrators and wounded 50
others today during protests in the occupied West Bank for the release
of Palestinian prisoners.
The clashes, the latest West Bank violence recalling the seven-year
Palestinian uprising, coincided with high-level Israeli-PLO efforts to
meet this Saturday's deadline for agreement on a troop pull-out from
cities in the West Bank.
Witnesses said soldiers near Jneid prison warned thousands of
demonstrators -- mainly students and prisoners' relatives -- not to
advance on the West Bank's largest jail.
Troops then lobbed tear gas and percussion grenades and levelled their
rifles, opening fire on stone-throwing protesters. The dead were a
23-year-old student and a 21-year-old labourer.
Political factions for and against peace moves with Israel jointly
declared tomorrow a day of mourning in Nablus and urged Palestinians to
observe a general strike on Tuesday.
Yesterday, at least 12 Palestinians were wounded in clashes with
troops throughout the West Bank. The protests erupted in solidarity with
Palestinian prisoners on a week-long hunger strike.
PLO leader Yasser Arafat said he raised the violence at the marches at
talks in Gaza with Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres.
They met for three hours in an attempt to achieve an accord by a July
1 deadline on wider Palestinian self-rule -- elections and an Israeli
troop redeployment in the occupied West Bank.
Arafat said they also discussed the prisoner issue and that he had
thanked Peres for his efforts ''to release some of our prisoners
gradually''.
Peres told reporters an Israeli committee would meet at the end of the
week to try to release some prisoners.
Shortly before today's clashes, a suicide bomber detonated a cart
laden with explosives near an Israeli army jeep in the Gaza Strip,
killing himself and his donkey.
The Israeli army said three soldiers in the jeep were slightly hurt.
His family said the bomber, 22-year-old Ma'wya Roka, was from Hamas, the
Islamic Resistance Movement.
About 5000 Palestinians are in Israeli jails. Israel has released 4000
prisoners since self-rule was launched last year in Gaza and
Jericho.--Reuter.
