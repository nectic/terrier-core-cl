ANEW yoghurt-style food being launched in the UK is claimed to reduce
the levels of LDL-cholesterol in the blood, and with it the risk of
heart attacks.
LDL -- Low Density Lipoprotein -- is the element of cholesterol that
leads to the build-up of constrictive atheroma on the walls of blood
vessels.
Since dairy products are implicated in the build-up of cholesterol,
any claim for a product that can lower it must be regarded as
remarkable.
Equally interesting is the origin of Gaio, a Danish product which will
appear on the shelves in tubs like any other fruit-flavoured yoghurt
(the makers can't simply call it yoghurt because it contains soya as
well as milk).
The researchers at Aarhus University Hospital, who established its
lipid-lowering qualities, came across reports from Kiev of a new
fermented milk product with significant hypocholesterolaemic effect.
The product was fermented with bacteria allegedly isolated from the
intestinal flora of elderly people from Abkhasia in the Caucasus, an
area reputed for the longevity of its people.
''Fermented milk is a major part of the traditional diet in this
particular area,'' said Dr Bjorn Richelsen of the Aarhus group.
He and his colleagues tried the product on a group of 44-year-old
Danes, 29 of whom were given the test product and 29 who were given a
similar but conventional yoghurt.
Over six weeks the test product demonstrated a 10% fall in
LDL-cholesterol. Other elements -- HDL cholesterol and triglycerides --
were unchanged.
The bacterial culture used to ferment Gaio, called Causido, contains a
strain of Enterococcus faecium (human species) and Streptococcus
termophilus. Before swallowing a spoonful of Gaio you may well ponder on
how intestinal bacteria from elderly Abkhasians made the transition to a
pot of yoghurt.
A spokeswoman from MD foods, which is marketing Gaio, said: ''It is a
culture just like any other used in yoghurt -- it was made from the
original culture they use in Abkhasia, but I don't know how they got it
in the first place.''
Perhaps it is better not to know. Or perhaps, if you visit Abkhasia,
you could look out for one of those legendary 110-year-olds . . . and
ask his father.

By Christmas, there will be a Welshman in the White House -- as Sir
Anthony Hopkins takes on the part of Richard Milhouse Nixon in Oliver
Stone's biopic of 'the Godfather of his generation'. Douglas Thompson
tells the story behind the multi-million-dollar project that became a
fight to the bitter end.
AT the Library of Congress in Washington there are more than 100 books
about the life, liaisons, loathes, loves and legislature of Richard
Milhouse Nixon. The baby-boomers' bogey-man is, like schoolroom frogs, a
favourite for dissection. There have been few leftovers.
The film-maker Oliver Stone, whose celluloid rants have helped assuage
his anguish about Vietnam (Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July) and the
sixties (The Doors), political conspiracy (JFK) and troubled today
(Natural Born Killers), now has the chief executive of America's most
catatonic era in his sights.
Nixon, with whom pompous patrons of a Manhattan apartment house didn't
even want to share their rat and mugger-plagued environment, is going to
be a bigger deal in 1996 than Bill Clinton or Bob Dole or California
Governor Pete Wilson, who will all be bidding for the home that Nixon
craved and ultimately betrayed.
At the ShoWest convention in Las Vegas last month the most popular
pick-up was a ''Nixon in '96'' campaign button. The publicity ploy by
Disney Studios, which is bankrolling Stone's $62 million biographical
film Nixon, was a winner. President Clinton has one of the bogus buttons
with his collection in the Oval Office.
It may not be his endorsement of the movie, but it reflects the
fascination with a man who couldn't win a war or shave properly. We
still don't know which made him more paranoid.
Jason Robards cleverly portrayed Nixon in the television series Behind
Closed Doors, which told the Watergate scandal pretty much from the
front pages of the Washington Post, coloured by the sudsy stuff from the
diary pages.
It's more than 20 years since the Nixon scandal. He died, aged 81, in
the spring of 1994 and all the rumblings of yesterday, much as they did
following the death of Harold Wilson, were gone over.
Now, we have left-leaning Oliver Stone's view of the 37th President of
the United States. His JFK played with so many theories about the
Kennedy assassination -- Stone called Kennedy ''the Godfather of my
generation'' -- it scrambled many minds. It was Kennedy who trumped
Nixon in TV debate.
But it was Nixon who elbowed his way to the top only to prove that
when you get there the fall is harder. Stone sees him as something of a
character from I, Claudius -- a man being dealt his hand by fate.
''He's a classic, tragic character, probably the most dominant
politician in America in the last half century after Roosevelt. The
toughness that it took for him to rise to the top as an outsider and
take the knocks was the very qulaity that made him cynical and bitter
and defeated him.''
Stone was not defeated in his own wars to get Nixon made. It's fair to
say the film-maker has his own obsession with American history in the
second half of this century. Hollywood's money men were never so sure.
Warner Brothers, who released Stone's recent movies, were the first in
line. And passed. So did Columbia Pictures and 20th Century Fox after
both showing initial enthusiasm. Disney Pictures went for it.
At the same time Sir David Frost was involved in a Nixon movie for
America's HBO cable television and Anglia TV. Producer Nick Wechsler was
also developing a Nixon project. Both, however, would be swamped by a
Stone production involving major studio financing and marketing. And
they were.
Interestingly, Stone, like Nixon, always believes it is his game, that
he has the ball. He kept quite quiet about his Nixon project. The focus
was on his Evita which was -- and still might -- star either Madonna,
Michelle Pfeiffer or Meryl Streep. And there was Noriega, a film about
Panama's most notorious nasty which, when the budget went above $40
million dollars, was dropped. But Stone being Stone, that might still
happen and he has Al Pacino's pledge for the title role.
All of that made Nixon a priority and one that Stone will deliver in
cinemas before Christmas, making Nixon eligible for next year's Oscars.
Apparently, from those who have seen footage, Sir Anthony Hopkins, who
has the title role will be a certain nominee. He is, they say,
mesmerising from the hairline to the jawline to the lawyer's suit.
Two-time Oscar-winner (Philadelphia, Forrest Gump) Tom Hanks, who is
likely to make it a hat-trick with this summer's Apollo 13, was the
first choice as Nixon. ''Tom was definitely intrigued,'' say the
producers. But Hopkins was not at first. He was involved in another film
biography, Surviving Picasso. The determined Oliver Stone sent Hopkins
another -- rewritten by Stone -- script. This time Hopkins couldn't say
no.
But the role is, he says, the most difficult of his long career. He
is, after all, a Welshman in the White House. ''I never feel I can get
the accent right. I can do Nixon, the essence of Nixon, the tortured
man, but the technical stuff is the hardest. I've got the mask but it's
the accent. Everyone knows what he sounded like. The voice. I've just
got to grab on to it like a fireman's pole, hold on to it and let it
carry me. Oliver says: 'Be bold, be bold, do Nixon, just do it.' I feel
I'm just keeping my head above water. I sense I know him. I sense he was
run out of his job by his own demons. I understand the rejection he
felt, the isolation. And I feel compassion for this man.''
Whether compassion is the view moviegoers will take away from Nixon is
to be seen later this year. But like most of Stone's projects, there is
a need to see the film just to find out what the maverick who has
survived so many Hollywood High Noons can do.
He has had inside help from some of the Watergate mob. Also Alexander
Butterfield, a one-time specialist assistant to Nixon, has worked this
year as the film's technical adviser.
Butterfield, who first revealed that Nixon kept tape recordings of all
his conversations, is at present writing a book about his former boss.
That has been on hold in recent weeks as he has collaborated with Stone.
''Oliver has had to take some creative licence to cut and paste, but
he's been very fair.''
The former White House confidante, who is now a businessman in San
Diego, California, coached Hopkins about the way Nixon spoke and his
gesticulating behaviour. ''I remember (H R) Haldeman once saying that
Nixon was the strangest man he ever met and I felt good when he said
that because I agreed. He gestured like no-one else I ever knew. He was
always a little off balance.
''No finesse. So unathletic, so pitifully unathletic. Even after his
last maudlin and stupid speech to his staff -- why everyone was crying I
never understood because it was so fragmented, so discombulated -- he
walked to the South Lawn and gave this almost enthusiastic wave. It was
so incongruous, like he was going on another trip. That's what was so
strange about him.''
What is eerie about the film is how close Stone's actors are to the
real-life players in one of the century's most intriguing dramas.
Hopkins does look like Nixon: you can see the insincerity. Joan Allen as
the tragic Pat Nixon is just about a double. And some of the best actors
in America fill pivotal roles including Cockney Bob Hoskins who takes on
the evil, manipulative figure of FBI boss J Edgar Hoover.
James Woods -- who worked for Stone in Salvador -- is the hardman H R
Haldeman with a crewcut as short as his fuse. Powers Boothe -- one-time
Chandler's Philip Marlow -- is General Alexander ''I'm in Charge'' Haig.
Paul Sorvino is Henry Kissinger, Ed Harris brings Howard Hunt to the
screen and E G Marshall provides yet another historical cameo as
Attorney General John Mitchell. Sam Waterson is CIA director Richard
Helms and Madeline Khan is motormouth Martha Mitchell.
Sir Anthony Hopkins, who won an Oscar for playing that other American
fascination -- the serial killer -- with his Hannibal Lecter in Silence
of the Lambs, uses mostly body language to be Nixon. He has a wig and
false teeth but Stone says: ''I didn't want make-up to get in the way of
his ability to allow people to look in on him.''

THE LATE arrival of summer coupled with continued weak consumer demand
continues to test the trading strengths of UK retailers. Sears, which
trades under a number of retail formats including the Selfridges
department store, Warehouse, Wallis and Dolcis, yesterday warned that
its profits for the first half of the current financial year would be
less than the #53.8m made last year.
The company added that although expectations for the second half
remain positive, progress over the year is expected to be slower than
anticipated. Trading is said to have been particularly difficult in the
last two months.
The poor trading statement added to the already negative stockmarket
sentiment saw the shares drop 3p to 97[1/2]p amid talk of possible
downgrades to full-year analysts' forecasts. The City had been expecting
annual pre-tax profits to advance from #140m to around #165m.
Like-for-like sales are said to be 2.6% ahead of the same period last
year but the company was hoping for sales to be up a further 1.5%. Gross
margin is in line with last year although again the company had hoped to
be able to nudge it higher.
Stock clearances at British Shoe and Olympus are to blame for the
margin pressure. However, Sears said its strategy for repositioning the
group is moving ahead. Turnover has risen by between 20% and 50% at the
revamped British Shoe Corporation, Shoe Express, Shoe City, and Hush
Puppies stores. The company is focusing on four shoe brands rather than
the 12 different outlets it used to operate three years ago.
The loss-making Olympus sportswear chain continues to cause problems
with some City analysts believing that it could be a candidate for sale
at some point in the future. The business is being restructured with the
closure of 40 town centre stores.
Its problems lie with expensive rents taken on during the boom years
of the late 1980s and a change in fashion in the under-20s athletic shoe
market. The larger out-of-town Olympus Sportsworlds and Millets camping
outlets are said to be trading strongly.
The Freemans home shopping business has seen a 0.8% increase in gross
margin and a rise in net margin to 7.9%. Further cost efficiency
projects are expected to produce further gains in margin. The womenswear
chains, with the exception of Miss Selfridge, are said to be performing
well with improvements in margins.
The best performers within the group are Adams childrenswear and
Selfridges which have both been the subject of investment aimed at
improving the product mix, store environment, service and marketing.

TWO players who have known the joy of winning the men's singles crown
at Wimbledon, and who harboured notions of parading again around the
most famous tennis arena in the world, were shown the door after
yesterday's first-round matches, writes James Traynor.
Michael Stich was beaten by Jacco Eltingh on Centre Court and outside,
on Court 3, Pat Cash hobbled out after only one set against Dick Norman.
Cash's demise was the most upsetting of the two, because he is one of
the few players around able to add a touch of colour and genuine
excitement to tennis. The Australian, who won the championship in 1987,
when he beat Ivan Lendl in straight sets before climbing over the heads
of the Centre Court audience to embrace his parents and friends, has
been troubled by various injuries since his triumph and he started
yesterday's match against his Belgian opponent with a damaged knee.
From the beginning, Cash was treading gingerly, and after having lost
the first-set tie-break he had to hold up his hands and admit defeat.
Wimbledon -- and perhaps also his career -- was over and as he limped
away from the complex he looked a broken man.
Stich, the winner four years ago when he beat Boris Becker, has had a
miserable time since then and has never progressed further than the
quarter-finals here. Yesterday was his third first-round defeat, but
given the year he has had it was hardly surprising that he would be
beaten by Eltingh, who won 6-4, 7-6, 6-1.
There was not much between these two big hitters with Stich rated
tenth in the world and his Dutch opponent 17 places further back. ''He
was better than me in every aspect,'' said Stich, who was seeded ninth.
''I had no rhythm and I didn't have my serve working properly.''
Eltingh had no such problems and said he felt Stich had appeared
sluggish and out of sorts. ''Towards the end he wasn't hitting his shots
with the proper accuracy,'' he said.
The No.10 seed from Switzerland, Marc Rosset, was dismissed by Michael
Joyce on Court 4, which was more of a shock than the passing of Stich.
Rosset won the gold medal at the Barcelona Olympics and was expected to
use his opponent for practice, but it was Joyce, ranked only 119, who
went away for his evening meal feeling on top of the world.

FORMER SFA secretary Ernie Walker will name his soccer think tank at
Hampden today and outline the three-year programme he hopes will be able
to turn around the Scottish game.
Walker was handed the job some months ago but delayed any announcement
of his plans until the new SFA committees had been formed following the
annual meeting of the association.
Since leaving his post at Park Gardens, Walker has taken an
increasingly important global role with both UEFA and FIFA and the hope
is that he will be able to bring on board influential soccer thinkers .
The committee will sit for a three-year period but Walker, a man who
likes to see action, will look for ideas quickly .

HIS head swathed in a bandana which could easily have been mistaken
for the world's first designer knotted hanky -- the sponsor's logo was
strategically placed on front of the headgear -- Andre Agassi strolled
into the afternoon sunshine, ear-rings sparkling brilliantly in both
lobes.
The top seed and current world No.1 lifted his right arm and
nonchalantly acknowledged his public.
Wearing a pair of knee-length baggy shorts Agassi, who looked as
though he should have been carrying a skateboard instead of a racket,
appeared precisely the type Wimbledon's authorities would not wish to
encourage through the gates. Yet, there he was, the kid from Las Vegas,
again being applauded by the Court 1 customers.
Yes, the sun, tennis and feel of the grass does strange things to
people, and even old gents in Panama hats, jackets, collars and ties
offered the former champion an enthusiastic welcome back to the show
courts.
He arrived without having had much sleep because of a hip muscle
injury which restricted his grass-court practice, but he was hardly
required to break sweat against his first-round opponent.
The unfortunate Andrew Painter had survived the qualifiers to suffer
this? The 19-year-old from Tasmania must have wondered why he had
bothered struggling through from the minor shows. After all, he was in
the competition for only 77 minutes, just long enough to be whacked 6-2,
6-2, 6-1. When it was over he trudged off behind Agassi, who left as he
had come, waving to the crowd and smiling through his goatee.
Poor Painter. He was thoroughly forlorn and stunned by the experience
of playing one of the sport's foremost shot-makers, an essential quality
at Wimbledon, whose authorities have decided to allow the International
Tennis Federation to conduct doping tests on the players this year.
Perhaps Painter should have slipped a little something into his
opponent's juice during one of the change-overs.
Afterwards Agassi, who now plays Patrick McEnroe, John's younger and
much more civilised brother, in the next round, fielded questions about
his girlfriend, Brooke Shields, his gear, and his sore hip. ''Brooke is
working and won't be able to come over until later,'' he said, ''and I
only wear the bandana to keep my head from getting burned by the sun.''
It's only three years since the 25-year-old bounded into Wimbledon and
won the title with his long, blond ponytail bobbing out from the back of
his baseball cap, but the locks have been shorn and much more of his
scalp can be seen these days. He's still scruffy, though. ''But there
are a lot of people who might like to wear this kind of stuff,'' the
champion of the grunge look countered, while hiking up those baggy
shorts a la James Cagney.
In fact, his sponsors are hoping milions buy the Agassi look, and it
was rumoured yesterday that he has been offered as much as #5m to wear
the gear for many more years.
Agassi believes he can win the championship again, although he doesn't
think he should have been seeded above defending champion Pete Sampras.
''It doesn't really matter, though. Being one or two here makes little
difference, because it all comes down to what a player does on the
court,'' he said.
''I didn't want to come here when I was younger and maybe I said some
things about Wimbledon which weren't very nice, and then I decided to
come and I admit I was humbled. That sort of got me a place in the
hearts of the people here.''
However, if he wants to remain there he will have to refrain from
saying things like ''my lack of grass practice doesn't bother me,
because I believe that the more you play on the surface the worse you
become.'' After he had said it he realised some people round these parts
might be none to pleased, and he added quickly: ''But I think that one
grass tournament among the Grand Slam events is fine.''
As for his injury, he pointed out: ''It hasn't bothered me at all
today, and as for the heavier balls we've all been talking about? Well,
having won 6-2, 6-2, 6-1 I'd have to say I like them.''
There was nothing uncertain about Boris Becker's progress to the
second round, and although he took 123 minutes to ease Emilio Alvarez
towards the Court 1 exit, the three-times champion looked pretty
ominous.
He beat the Spaniard, whose enthusiasm -- he launched himself into the
air several times to hit volleys -- won him many friends yesterday, 6-3,
6-3, 6-4.
Becker hopes to celebrate the tenth anniversary of his first win here
by doing exactly the same again, and he added: ''This is actually my
twelfth time here and you need nerves of steel to play well when it
really matters.
''Also, to win here again I have to have nerves of steel. It has
always been like that and I believe I still have everything it takes to
win again.''
Henri Leconte, who plays only for fun these days and to keep his
tennis vaudeville act on the road, was beaten 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 by
Argentinian Javier Frana on Court 14. It was a pity, the Frenchman said
afterwards, that he would not be playing singles at Wimbledon anymore.
''It is too tiring now at the age of 32,'' he said. ''This was my
thirteenth time here and at my age you have to be reasonable.''
Reasonable? Henri Leconte? Yes, maybe the one man who could always be
relied upon to bring a smile to the tennis has become too old for it
all.

MANCHESTER United chief executive Martin Edwards last night poured
cold water on the latest rumour to hit soccer's transfer grapevine,
writes Ken Gallacher.
There have been repeated suggestions that the Old Trafford giants are
ready to hijack Paul Gascoigne, although he has committed himself to
Rangers. Yesterday the speculation reached fever pitch before Edwards
insisted: ''There is no truth whatsoever in this story. I have heard it
myself today and I can deny it totally.
''There are so many rumours surrounding this club that you should not
believe any of them. But, in particular, you should not believe this. It
just is not true.''
Edwards was the Old Trafford spokesman as manager Alex Ferguson is
still on holiday in the United States.
My understanding is that United, along with Rangers, were among the
British clubs targeted by Gascoigne's agents when the player became
available. But Fergie decided that his midfield was strong enough
without adding Gazza at a cost of more than #4m pounds. That view has
clearly not altered even though, since then, Paul Ince has been sold to
Inter Milan for #7m.
Rangers, meanwhile, simply await the arrival of Gascoigne for training
on July 10. Some of the first-team squad will report earlier -- next
Wednesday in fact -- but others, including their major signing from
Lazio, will report the following Monday.
It is only two weeks since Gascoigne was at Ibrox, went through a
medical, and told the world that he was joining Rangers. I believe that
this has been confirmed by his advisers as the rumour factory went into
overdrive yesterday.
Gascoigne will be at Ibrox on the appointed date and he will probably
make his debut on the pre-season tour of Denmark which kicks off with a
game on July 21.

DID you notice the tale of the chap who fell asleep while fielding at
long on in a village cricket match in Dorset?
Apparently, he had dozed off for quite a while before a ball hit him
on the boot on route to the boundary. His skipper moved him to first
slip just to keep his eyes open.
Then there was the young woman who suffered sun-stroke playing tennis
down the east coast of Scotland. This manifested itself when she was
found ready to receive service on the same side of the net as her
opponent.
This warm weather is definitely not good for us sporting types, you
know -- we are just not equipped to deal with it.
In my golf bag I have almost every kind of element repellant: the full
double-knit jumper for the snell wind, the red balls in case of summer
snow, the galoshes for crossing the marshy bit at the fifth, a light and
heavy set of waterproofs to be used depending on whether the rain is
warm or cold, a sponsored umbrella big enough to double up as a tent, a
cashmere scarf, handwarmers, a woolly hat, and a tot of brandy in case
it is the St Bernard's night off.
In temperatures of 70 degrees and upwards I can hardly carry the
bloody thing, with or without the extra sun-tan lotion.
I played in East Lothian earlier this week and, by the time we had
reached the fourteenth, which was well past many people's bed-time I was
reduced to a greasy spot.
The clubs were slipping from my sweat-soaked hands, my throat was as
dry as an AA meeting, and my dogs were barking.
This is supposed to be fun? Any moment now we can expect a hose pipe
ban. In fact, I am surprised it has not been announced already which
will turn fairways, cricket pitches, bowling greens, racecourses, and
grass tennis courts into rock hard fields of brown. This will not be
good news for the Brits.
It is a well-known fact that the main reason our brave boys and girls
head for the early exits at Wimbledon is that the weather is almost
always too good.
After three days under natures floodlights Batesy was usually ready
for El Collapso -- he's gone already this time -- while Jo Durie and the
other English roses were visibly wilting.
Mike and the lads may have toppled the mighty West Indians at Lord's
but what we need now is a cutting breeze and a drop in the temperature.
The Windies don't like it when it's windy, everybody knows that.
Golf is the same. What has happened to the European challenge on the
US circuit so far this season? Bombed away.
Remember when big Colin just about won their Open in a force nine gale
-- that's the conditions we like. The Yanks are used to the heat. When
you play on many of their courses you are not even allowed to walk, it's
so hot. As you come off the ninth green there is usually an
air-conditioned bar where you can have half-an-hours respite before
continuing; get really lucky and you might not have to go out again.
At the ninth at my club, the only bar is likely to have been made by
Mars and, currently, it would have melted in your pocket.
From time to time good-hearted folk, like Sir Gavin Hastings -- well,
he made it on my honours list and who knows, I could be the Prime
Minister in a couple of weeks -- suggest that traditional winter sports
like rugby should be switched to the sunny season. Have they stood under
too many high balls, I ask myself.
Who would like to tackle players of the build of Jonah Lomu on the
current concrete? How would you feel if he picked you up, a la Underwood
Jr, and tossed you into touch like a discarded fag packet? Sore, that is
how you would feel. Believe me.
Even racehorses hate the hard ground. I was at Musselburgh on Monday,
chatting to the respected Duns trainer, Tom Kemp, and he pointed out a
poor beast scratching its way down to the start.
''When they move like that you know they are not appreciating the
going,'' he opined sagely.
The horse won, mind you, but that was just because it was so eager to
get back to its stable.
We don't want our sportsmen or women or animals to suffer in the sun.
Let's not see our cricketers sporting white noses, bowlers in pith
helments, the women's captain in those enormous shorts. We will be
buying barbeque kits next.
No, I'm sorry, I'm not playing golf again tonight. I am taking the

LENNOX Lewis is ready to fight Frank Bruno again -- this time in
court.
The former World Boxing Council heavyweight champion, who beat Bruno
in seven rounds in 1993, is unwilling to stand by while Bruno gets a
fourth world title chance against Oliver McCall on September 2.
Lewis, winding down his preparations for his 10-rounder with Los
Angeles-based Australian Justin Fortune in Dublin on Sunday, has vowed
to take ''whatever steps are necessary'' to ensure his sole conqueror,
McCall, does not defend the WBC crown against Bruno in just over two
months' time. And that could mean taking his claim on a rematch with
McCall into the legal arena.
''It's way over the due date for my rematch, and I'm going to put
various motions into action and push for the rematch with McCall to be
sanctioned as soon as possible.''
Frank Maloney, Lewis's manager and promoter of Sunday's show, was even
more blunt. ''The Lennox Lewis team will take every necessary action
they have to to ensure the rematch contract is honoured,'' he said.
''We're waiting on the WBC's response to our request to order the
rematch immediately. When we get their reply, we'll decide just what
action to take.''
Asked if ''action'' might include the legal kind, Maloney repeated,
''Whatever is necessary,'' and then made a pointed prediction: ''I
believe Lennox Lewis will be in the ring with Oliver McCall again before
Frank Bruno is.''
Lewis regards Sunday's date with Fortune as an ideal opportunity to
cement his developing relationship with new trainer Emmanuel Steward.
Lewis said: ''The main reason for taking the fight is just to stay busy,
to keep active while we're sorting out the world title situation.
''But it's also important for Manny and I -- our relationship is still
pretty young and there's a lot of things about each other that we're
still getting used to.''
* RICHIE Woodhall has been ordered to defend his European middleweight
title against British champion Neville Brown.
The Telford boxer's Commonwealth crown will also be on the line to
make it one of Britain's infrequent three-title bouts. The deadline for
purse offers is August 3.

BATTERED and bruised, the old girl soldiers on. Jo Durie, at 35,
continues to shoulder the burden of British tennis -- and that says as
much about the poverty of tennis in this country as it does for her own
resilience.
Durie, whose name has been dropped from the official reference books,
is playing in her final Wimbledon championships because of a promise she
made to the surgeon who last operated on her damaged left knee.
She said she wants to be able to walk when she is older and her
surgeon made her concede that this would be her last trip to Wimbledon
as a player. ''I've had three operations on the knee already and, if I
keep going, I would have to get an artificial knee cap and I don't want
that,'' she said.
Perhaps because she has made the decision to leave someone else to
carry the English banner she dragged from somewhere within herself one
more effort and beat Alexia Dechaume-Balleret 6-2, 7-6 on Court 2.
Durie has always taken her supporters on emotional roller-coaster
rides during the Wimbledon fortnight and they were with her every
limping step of the way yesterday, when she won a first-round match for
the first time in four years. She will need every one of them behind her
when she meets Jana Navotna, a finalist here two years ago, in the next
round.
Nevertheless, she has already done her bit again for the English, who
don't often get much chance to cheer their own to victory. ''I wish I
could carry on, but physically it is just too much for me now,'' she
said. ''I hope to be able to help bring through younger players, but
stoppiing will be very difficult. This has been my life.''
While one familiar face was playing in her final Wimbledon two
newcomers, whose combined ages don't even add to up to Durie's 35 years,
were feeling their ways into the most prestigous Grand Slam tournament
of them all. Mary Pierce, aged 20, and Martina Hingis, a precocious
14-year-old Swiss girl, played on grass for the first time.
Pierce, seeded No.5 and ranked No.4 in the world, finally showed up at
the championships after having ignored them since her arrival in the big
time. Last year she entered for the first time, but withdrew at the last
minute, and it was thought she would have to be dragged in kicking and
screaming.
However, after a couple of points on a real, living surface for the
first time she admitted to having enjoyed the experience. Her opponent,
Sandra Dopfer, didn't have such a good time, losing 6-1, 6-2 in 58
minutes and left the premises shaking her head in disbelief that someone
who had been so reluctant to perform on grass could look so comfortable.
Pierce, in fact, played an excellent match and moved around Court 14
with an elegance which has all but gone from the women's game. She even
dresses like the players of old, shunning the skirts and tops favoured
by most of the women, preferring to wear a more traditional dress.
''I've been wearing this dress for just over a year,'' she said --
hopefully she's had it laundered since then -- ''and I just feel better
in it. I have to say
''I always thought that I wouldn't like grass, but it was something
that was in my head,'' said Pierce later.''I enjoyed this afternoon and
you never know what might happen. I have a similar game to Andre Agassi
and he came here thinking he didn't like grass and won.''
Hingis, the latest sensation to bounce on to the circuit, lost 6-3,
6-1 to Graf in 50 minutes on Centre Court, but the Swiss child, who won
junior Wimbledon last year and is already fourteenth in the world, did
give the five-times champion some difficult moments.
Indeed, Hingis, who was younger than even the ballboys and girls, had
the audacity to take Graf's serve three times in the two-set match, but
each time the German woman sucked in fresh oxygen and made the little
girl suffer.
* MARTINA Navratilova and Steffi Graf last night withdrew from the
women's doubles. No reason was given, but 38-year-old Navratilova's
fitness may have swung the issue. The ''dream-team'' pairing of the
women who have won 14 of the last 17 Wimbledon singles titles had
created a huge wave of interest.

SCOTTISH No.1 Senga Macfie faces the prospect of dropping out of the
world's top 20 if she fails to get past the first round of the Women's
World Open Squash Championships in Hong Kong.
But the London-based 26-year-old will need to produce a career best
performance today if she is to overcome the English second seed, Suzanne
Horner.
Macfie suffered a disappointing defeat from Australia's Vicki Cardwell
in the first round of the Malaysian Open last week and will need to
employ all the positive thinking techniques that she has been working on
with a sports psychologist if she is to clear today's hurdle.
However, Horner, the former British Open champion, also had a
disappointing run in Malaysia, losing to eventual winner Liz Irving in
the second round.
Meanwhile, defending champion Michelle Martin, of Australia, yesterday
breezed through her first-round match against New Zealand qualifier
Sarah Cook 9-2, 9-1, 9-6 in less than 23 minutes.
Martin showed no signs of a hangover from her surprise defeat by
compatriot Irving in the Malaysian Open final last week. a defeat that
brought to an end Martin's 14-month, 10-tournament winning run.
''I am hitting the ball a bit crisper than last week. I always seem to
have bad weeks before the World championship,'' said Martin, who is
bidding for her third straight title.
In the second round she will play England's Jane Martin, who beat
South African Carla Venter 9-1, 9-0, 9-6.
Cardwell, world champion in 1983, had a comfortable 9-4, 9-2, 9-1 win
over Tegwen Malik of Wales. Cardwell now meets Sue Wright of England,
who scored a 9-4, 9-3, 9-1 victory over Natarsha Tippett of Australia.
* SCOTLAND'S Stuart Cowie maintained his recent fine form with victory
in the Toulouse Open in France last week. The 19-year-old, who was
unbeaten in making his international debut for Scotland in the European
championships in April, should be rewarded with a climb from his current
No.74 place in the world rankings.

<TEXT>
FRENCH referee Patrick Robin yesterday claimed in a newspaper
interview that the victorious South Africans received favourable
treatment during the Rugby World Cup.
In an interview with French sports daily l'Equipe he slammed the
refereeing system at the finals and also hit out at what he described as
a ''British mafia'' influence in the appointing of officials for vital
matches during the tournament.
Robin, who is retiring from refereeing, also claims one supervisor
made an assessment of a referee while drunk in front of a television
set.
''One has the impression that not everything was very clear during
this World Cup in terms of refereeing and that it was very hard to beat
South Africa,'' says Robin.
''In the semi-final against France I noted four doubtful situations.
All four decisions were favourable to South Africa.
''In the final there were 10 contested situations and all those went
in favour of South Africa as well. There were too many discrepancies.''
Robin said it was ''very significant'' that South African Rugby Union
federation president Louis Luyt presented Welsh referee Derek Bevan with
a gold watch at the post-final banquet and described him as the best in
the world. Bevan refereed the France v South Africa semi-final.
The French official said rules made before the finals were not
respected. He claims seven of the 26 referees failed physical tests, yet
four of those were still allowed to officiate at the finals.
He added that a points system for referees was set up in the group
matches, in which Robin finished second behind Bevan. But the
supervisors then changed the system to base it on experience and dropped
him down to fifth place -- giving him no chance of refereeing one of the
final games.
''It was no use arguing,'' he said. ''The British form a terrible
mafia. The referees themselves did not respect the rules of the sport.
''Argentina were robbed in their three group games, and I wonder how
one of the supervisors could have had any idea of the quality of Steve
Hilditch's refereeing of the semi-final at Cape Town between New Zealand
and England, when he was in a state of advanced inebriation in front of
his television in Johannesburg.''

IHTIRAM can continue John Dunlop's terrific run of form by winning the
#18,000-added Gala Stakes at Kempton.
The colt has proved very consistent and opened his account in good
style when easily beating Steady Ready Go at Thirsk last month.
Subsequently stepped up in class to contest a Listed race at Kempton,
Ihtiram enjoyed no luck in running.
He was putting in a challenge a furlong out when he hit the inside
rail, lost his momentum, and was unable to catch Peace Envoy, going down
by two lengths.
Regardless of whether Ihtiram would have won given a clear passage,
that was a solid effort which proved he is up to this level.
He faces a good test here against last year's winner Young Buster and
some other useful animals.
But Ihtiram, who comes here in fine fettle and is favoured by the race
conditions, can gain the day in an intriguing contest.
Varvarka is an interesting runner in the Sun Life of Canada Fillies'
Conditions Stakes.
Admittedly, she did not beat that much when seeing off Feinte by three
lengths on her Carlisle debut.
But she did it in good style and it is rare for Bill Watts to venture
this far south with a horse unless he feels it holds a live chance.
Watts holds Varvarka -- one of nine he trains for Sheikh Mohammed --
in high regard and she can reward his faith.
Apprentice Paul Fessey's career is on the up at present, thanks
largely to five wins aboard Jimmy Harris' prolific scorer Vindaloo.
And he is not just an armchair pilot, as he showed when giving Suedoro
a forceful ride to dead-heat with Birchwood Sun at Hamilton last time.
He galvanised improved form out of the five-year-old there and again
teams up with the mare for the C G Truck Handicap at Carlisle.
Suedoro has been left untouched by the handicapper and can gain an
outright win this time.
Mark Johnston looks to have unearthed a real bargain in Russian
Heroine.
The three-year-old only cost 1700 guineas as a yearling but gained her
sixth success when beating Tinklers Folly by three lengths at Edinburgh
yesterday.
She can make her quick reappearance pay by defying a 6lb penalty in
the Midsummer Handicap at Chester.
Best bet of the day, however, is Chatham Island in the preceeding
Kidsons Impey Handicap.
The Clive Brittain-trained seven-year-old is at his best when he can
dominate and he will be able to do just that as they race on the turn
throughout on the Roodee.

THE fate of the Italian Grand Prix was back in the balance yesterday
after eight hours of talks between local and government officials failed
to give the go-ahead for safety work at the controversial Monza circuit.
Milan forestry corps commander Alberto Guzzi said the meeting at the
Environment Ministry broke up with a request to local authorities for
work to be carried out with less impact on the environment.
Current proposals envisage felling 185 trees at the circuit, which
lies inside a protected park, to meet additional safety changes sought
by the International Motoring Federation (FIA) to allow the race to take
place on September 10.
Monza circuit manager Beghella Bartoli said last week that FIA would
cancel the race unless it had an answer ready in time for a meeting of
its world council in Paris today.
Italian newspapers yesterday claimed the fate of the race, one of the
major dates in Italy's sporting calendar, now rested with Prime Minister
Lamberto Dini.
The Italian Grand Prix was almost called off last year after
environmentalists protested at a plan to chop down 100 trees. A
compromise was eventually agreed in which most of the trees were spared.
Safety has become a major issue in Formula One since drivers Ayrton
Senna and Roland Ratzenberger died in separate crashes at the 1994 San
Marino Grand Prix at Italy's Imola circuit.
* TOURING car championship officials yesterday announced an expanded
programme of races for next year.
The 1996 Auto Trader RAC Touring Car Championship will feature an
unprecedented 26 rounds, including for the first time two races at the
British Grand Prix meeting.
Highlights include two visits to Thruxton, the fastest circuit on the
current championship calendar, and a trip north of the Border on July 28
to Knockhill.
Although exact formats are still to be confirmed, all meetings will
again feature two touring car races.
Silverstone's timetable for the 1996 British Grand Prix will include
touring car races on both Saturday (the final day of Formula One
qualifying) and Sunday.

Trent Bridge
ONLY a fortnight ago against the West Indies, all indications were
that Scottish cricket had turned a corner. Yesterday at Trent Bridge,
the Scots found themselves back up a dead end, comfortably beaten by
Nottinghamshire by 8 wickets, with 24 overs in hand, to end our NatWest
Trophy interest once again at the first hurdle.
It took only a handful of overs for the Scots to find themselves
toiling with Notts seamer Andy Pick chipping out the top of the Scots
batting order with a hat trick of lbw decisions, ably assisted by the
trigger-finger of umpire Peter Wight.
With the score on 6, Bruce Patterson -- on his recall for the
international side -- was adjudged leg before to the last ball of Pick's
third over, although even to neutrals, the Ayr opener looked both
outside off stump and a big step forward.
When Pick took delivery of the ball again, the Scots total had moved
on by two runs. Gordon McGurk though, wasn't off the mark when he was
struck on the pads and told to walk. And, next ball, Pick removed George
Salmond in identical fashion to leave the Scots down -- and effectively
out -- on 8 for 3.
Malcolm Marshall entered the scene, and almost departed just as
quickly. Having made three, Marshall was dropped by Notts skipper Tim
Robinson at extra cover.
But, after surviving that scare, the former West Indian Test star went
on to share a stand of 80 for the fourth wicket with Alastair Storie.
Just when it looked as though Scotland would make it through to lunch
without further heartache, Marshall picked out Graeme Archer, ending his
best ever innings for his adopted country on 45 from just 98 balls
faced.
The Scots rested on 96 for 4 at lunch after 37 overs with Storie on 34
and Greig Williamson on just a single. However, though Scotland reached
reached three figures in the thirty-ninth over, Williamson was another
to fall leg before without adding to his tally.
Wickets continued to fall at one end. At the other, however, skipper
Storie was grinding his way towards a painfully slow half century.
Storie's 50 up in the fifty-sixth over -- yes, less than a run per
over -- with the West of Scotland batsman eventually out in the
penultimate over for 56. The stats of Storie's mini-marathon are almost
as gripping as his knock; in for 221 minutes, 159 balls faced, and just
five boundaries.
The Scotland captain survived while others failed. Nevertheless,
regardless of the occasion or the situation he found himself in, to see
out almost an entire innings and finish with less than a hundred is
difficult to defend.
Man-of-the-match Pick finished with 5-23 to restrict the visitors to
171-9, a total that never looked likely to trouble the senior county
seriously.
There were two minor successes, with Keith Sheridan and Jim Govan
taking a wicket apiece -- the latter thanks to a good catch from Salmond
-- to remove Paul Johnson for 0, although he did make #366 for his
benefit fund.
But left-hander Paul Pollard and hard-hitting Kiwi Chris Cairns made
certain of an early finish. As if to sum up Scotland's afternoon,
Nottinghamshire clinched victory with a no-ball from Mike Allingham.

NATWEST TROPHY
ADRIAN Pierson was the hero as Leicestershire snatched a NatWest
Trophy first-round victory over Hampshire at Grace Road yesterday.
Off-spinner Pierson claimed three for 36 as Hampshire were restricted
to 204 for nine off their 60 overs. Then he defied the pain of a
fractured finger to hit an unbeaten 20 as the home side replied with an
identical score -- Leicestershire progressing by virtue of their faster
scoring rate in the first 30 overs.
Elsewhere, there were no shocks as all minor opposition fell by the
wayside, but Holland pushed championship leaders Northamptonshire all
the way on their Trophy debut at Northampton.
Northants opener Fordham (99) teamed up with Richard Montgomerie (69)
in an opening stand of 124 as Northants sentenced the Dutch to a
seven-wicket defeat.
Holland had totalled an impressive 267 for nine, but could have posted
a more daunting target had they capitalised on the fine start given to
them by openers Nolan Clarke (86) and Peter Cantrell (47) in a stand of
88.
Warwickshire, last season's beaten finalists, went on a run rampage
against Somerset at Edgbaston, rattling up 357 for three -- their best
one-day score against first-class opposition -- but they were made to
fight for their 18-run win.
Andy Moles hit 90 in an opening stand of 178 with Nick Knight, who
went on to score 151 and share in a second-wicket stand of 146 with
Dominic Ostler (76).
But Somerset set the nerves jingling with fine knocks by Richard
Harden (104), Keith Parsons (48) and Piran Holloway (50no) as they
replied with 339 for nine.
Durham openers Mike Roseberry and Stewart Hutton shared a record
255-run partnership in a 207-run thrashing of Herefordshire at
Chester-le-Street.
The stand was a new competition first-wicket record, with Roseberry
hitting 121 and Hutton 125 as Durham totalled 326 for four before
dismissing the visitors for 119.
Former England skipper Graham Gooch inspired Essex to a 64-run victory
over Cheshire at Chester with a burst of five for eight in just 16
deliveries.
Derbyshire 289-3 (D J Cullinan 119no, W A Dessaur 85, C M Wells 51no),
Cambridgeshire 132 (P A J DeFreitas 5-28). Derbyshire beat
Cambridgeshire by 157 runs.
Essex 265-8 (P J Prichard 81, M C Ilott 54no, A J Murphy 4-48),
Cheshire 201 (R G Hignett 55, G A Gooch 5-8). Essex beat Cheshire by 64
runs.
Middlesex 304-8 (P N Weekes 143no), Cornwall 200-10. Middlesex beat
Cornwall by 104 runs.
Durham 326-4 (S Hutton 125, M A Roseberry 121), Herefordshire 119 (J
Boiling 4-22). Durham beat Herefordshire by 207 runs.
Dorset 191-4 (J J E Hardy 89no), Glamorgan 192-0 (H Morris 105no, S P

Gloucestershire 301-5 (A J Wright 142no, R C Russell 59no), Suffolk
177 (D J P Boden 6-26). Gloucestershire beat Suffolk by 124 runs.
Norfolk 188, Lancashire 190-2 (J E R Gallian 101no). Lancashire beat
Norfolk by 8 wickets.
Hampshire 204-9, Leicestershire 204-9 (C A Connor 4-41).
Leicestershire won due to higher run rate.
Holland 267-9 (N Clarke 86, A Kumble 4-50), Northamptonshire 269-3 (A
Fordham 99, R R Montgomerie 69). Northamptonshire beat Holland by 7
wickets.
Kent 349-8 (N R Taylor 86, G R Cowdrey 65, T R Ward 53, P F Ridgway
4-62), Staffordshire 258-6 Innings Complete (L Potter 105no). Kent beat
Staffordshire by 91 runs.
Berkshire 148 (J E Benjamin 4-20), Surrey 151-1 (M A Butcher 79no, D J

SCOTLAND'S Robert Millar has been denied the chance of a British
record thirteenth ride in the Tour de France after the withdrawal of
French team Le Groupement.
Millar, who won the British championship in the Isle of Man last week,
is contracted to the company, who have been forced to pull out because
of financial problems.
The 36-year-old was set to break Barry Hoban's record of 12 Tour de
France rides in the 1960s and 70s.
Millar, who finished fourth in the 1984 race when he became the first
British rider to win the King of the Mountains category, is still some
way behind the overall record of 16 held by Dutchman Joop Zoetemelk.

ACCESS to finance is a strong determinant of the potential to become
an entrepreneur. This is the key conclusion of an ongoing New Venture
Finance survey under the Scottish Enterprise Business Birth Rate
Strategy for Scotland.
Results from a special MORI survey suggested that difficulty in
raising finance for a new venture was by far the greatest reason for
choosing not to set up a business, among those who declared an interest
in setting up on their own but had chosen not to.
This in turn suggests that finance -- or rather the lack of it -- is a
constraint on the business birth rate. But this is more than anything a
reflection of the ability of would-be entrepreneurs to secure finance,
and determined by factors like personal wealth and home ownership.
The key issue therefore is to improve access rather than availability
of cash. The birth rate enquiry suggested these problems were
particularly acute among women, under 35-year-olds and ''blue collar''
social groups.
This was confirmed by other evidence from the survey which suggested
that the perception that raising finance is a problem appeared to
diminish, the closer one gets to setting up in business.
Actual entrepreneurs saw it as much less of a problem than potential
or latent entrepreneurs. There was therefore an opportunity to persuade
more people in Scotland to ''have a go'' by convincing them that raising
finance was less difficult than it might appear.
The survey's conclusions included the fact that the venture capital
sector had maintained its gradual shift away from start-ups in the UK,
with a clear focus on later-stage investments, turnarounds, and
management buy-outs and buy-ins.
The specialist start-up and hi-tech venture capitalists found in parts
of the United States appeared to be rare in the UK environment and,
outside the public sector and quasi-public sector, almost entirely
absent in Scotland.
With the dominance of later-stage skills among British venture
capitalists, prospects for recreating a focus of start-ups from among
current active players appeared poor.
The survey did add, however, that venture capital was constrained from
supporting smaller start-up companies by a number of reasons: cost of
due diligence, appraisal and monitoring was proportionally higher for
smaller investments; securing significant returns from small start-ups
often required a longer term horizon than many of the funders of venture
capital were prepared to tolerate; and most UK venture capitalists
lacked the necessary skills to nurture and develop investments in
specialist fields such as high technology and university spin-outs.
This latter conclusion was particularly the case in an area like
Scotland where the size of such specialist niches was small.
Nevertheless, evidence from survey research suggested scope for action
with greater partnership between public and private sectors possible.
One such niche work which is both growing in importance and is now
well developed in the investigation stage, is a planned collaborative
venture between Scotland's burgeoning biotech company sector and the
Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering at University College
London. The centre's manager of industrial collaboration Dr Tony
Bradshaw is a former graduate of Heriot Watt University.
Other survey conclusions included: business advisers in Scotland
should be encouraged to pay greater heed to the heterogeneity of new
ventures and the fact that there is an abundance of means to develop a
business.
There was a great need to increase the knowledge of potential and
existing entrepreneurs of financial issues, both in obtaining and
managing external funding. Related to this is the need to improve the
quality of advice and training given to would-be entrepreneurs on these
issues.
Greater effort was needed to improve awareness of new firms as a
business issue throughout the financial and business communities.
Referring on cases between potential funders should be encouraged, if
necessary by addressing regulatory or professional constraints. Advisers
and funders should also play a bigger role in encouraging start-ups to
network more effectively.
Much could be done to improve awareness and attitudes towards new
ventures throughout the banking community, part of this involving
information on performance of new firm loans, as opposed to small firms
as a whole. Improvements were also required in integrating financial and
business services provided by banks with the support provided by
private, public and quasi-public networks.
As part of the ongoing strategy, Scottish Enterprise and the clearing
banks have been working on a series of initiatives to address some of
the identified issues.
Results from a special MORI survey suggested that difficulty in
raising finance for a new venture was by far the greatest reason for
choosing not to set up a business

* HERE is a heavenly place in which to live. Church House, Raemartin
Square, West Linton, is a converted kirk -- and its selling agents are
singing its praises. Although its exterior design and Gothic windows
make it look much older, the church was built in 1840 and has now been
converted to provide three public rooms, a large country-style kitchen,
and four bedrooms (two with en-suite bathrooms). The centrepiece is a
lounge which comes with its own minstrel gallery. Edinburgh solicitors
Olivers WS are praying for offerings of over #170,000.

ARGYLL PARK
HELENSBURGH was originally a planned village, laid out in 1777 by Sir
James Colquhoun of Luss and named after his wife. After starting life as
a popular retreat for wealthy Glasgow merchants, its role changed to
upmarket holiday resort and commuter town with the coming of the railway
in 1857.
Popular with professional footballers who are not pestered by its
douce inhabitants, Helensburgh is also a haven for Glasgow's
professional classes who enjoy the fresh air, easy access to Rhu Marina,
and the wide choice of housing.
Argyll Park is a good example of the type of property available. An
elegant two-storey period home with landscaped gardens, it dates from
around 1832 and has changed hands only seven times, each owner staying
an average of 25 years.
Sympathetically maintained and enhanced by its current owners, it
still boasts many period details and comprises: lounge with feature
fireplace, dining room, family room, large sun lounge extending to 27ft
with french doors to the garden, fitted dining kitchen with utility. On
the upper level there are four bedrooms and a bathroom. There is also a
double garage.
Slater Hogg &amp; Howison invites offers over #190,000.
SOMERLED
* IT'S a long way from the Norwegian fjords to Alloway, but the memory
of a Viking king is kept alive in one of the largest modern houses in
Ayr's leafy suburb -- Somerled, in Greenfield Avenue, a fine property
overlooking Belleisle golf course.
At the centre of the house is a large reception hall which also serves
as a dining room. It has three public rooms, four bedrooms, and three
bathrooms, and stands in landscaped gardens. It contains an interesting
elliptical staircase as well as many ash wood finishes.
Selling agent Donald Ross of Ayr says Somerled ''provides very high
standards of modern accommodation in a delightful environment''. There
could hardly be a more appropriate time to travel to Alloway to confirm
that view. The Norse name Somerled means summer rover -- the Vikings
preferred to do their pillaging and plundering when the weather was
fine.
The Viking of that name played a key role in the history of western
Scotland. Born in 1126 of a Norse mother and a father descended form the
ancient kings of Dalriada, he forged a close-knit society from competing
Norse and Celtic elements, and was a predecessor of the Lords of the
Isles.
Donald Ross is seeking offers over #335,000.
RHU LODGE
* RHU Lodge enjoys one of the most scenic positions in the West of
Scotland, which probably explains why royalty, industrialists, and an
actor have owned it. Standing on Rhu Point just north of Helensburgh, it
has outstanding views northwards into the Gareloch and southwards to the
open waters of the Clyde. The narrows created by Rhu Point's shingle
bank create a dramatic tidal flow.
About 150 years ago several country houses were built around the point
for Glasgow's wealthier merchants. Rhu Lodge was probably a shooting
lodge for the Duke of Argyll. Former owners include Princess Louise,
Queen Victoria's daughter, several leading military men and
industrialists -- and Noel Coward. When first built it was thatched with
heather, but the single-storey building now has a substantial slate roof
and is set in two acres with glorious views.
The house has cloakroom, reception hall, drawing room, dining room,
breakfasting kitchen, laundry room, shower room, games room, bathroom,
inner hall, and four bedrooms. A self-contained annexe has a reception
hall, living room, shower room, dining kitchen and bedroom. Clyde
Property is seeking offers over #325,000.

GLASWEGIANS who bought their homes since the 1990 property slump have
a much more realistic attitude to the market value of their homes than
their neighbours who bought before the crash.
Particularly when selling their homes, those who bought recently tend
to be relatively sensible about price expectations. With sales still
moving slowly, people putting their houses on the market are aware that
they are unlikely to achieve a quick sale and have adjusted their
expectations accordingly.
Home-owners who are aiming to move up to their second or third buy
have also become more canny about the different forms of mortgage and
are wary about borrowing too much.
These indications of a sophisticated home ownership market in a part
of the UK which has traditionally had a low level of owner-occupation,
are revealed in the first stage of a major study into trends in the
buying and selling of property.
Clodagh Memery, a researcher with Glasgow University's Centre for
Housing Research and Urban Studies, has persuaded a number of would-be
sellers to keep detailed diaries of their experiences. The results
provide revealing insights into the attitudes of a group of sellers
whose homes have not increased in value since they were bought.
All her respondents are people who bought their current home since
1990. While those who bought in the mid-1980s can expect to see a
profit, those who purchased in the last five years are not so lucky.
But these children of the property recession are not allowing
themselves to be grounded by the sluggish market and low uplift in
property values, they are still prepared to sell their home when they
need something larger.
And their expectations are refreshingly realistic compared to their
older brothers and sisters who bought their homes ten years ago.
Ms Memery's research indicates that people who bought since 1990 can
expect to just about break even on their house sale, probably making
enough to cover the cost of moving as well as paying off their previous
mortgage.
This would indicate that people are moving home because they need more
space, rather than simply trading up for investment reasons. ''People
who purchased their current home in the post-boom period expect to break
even, rather than make a big profit out of selling their home.
''I've been quite struck by the number of people who are willing to
sell their home at a little less than the agent's suggested price.
Glaswegian sellers are very realistic -- they've got their feet on the
ground. They can also look forward to spending less on the purchase of
their next home.''
Her research reveals that many would-be sellers have a very shrewd
idea of what is going on in their part of the market, especially if they
have always lived in one particular part of town.
''People are very tuned in to their local area. They know whose house
has sold and whose has been taking longer to shift. People don't fool
themselves, if they live in a part of town where the market consists
mainly of local people they will expect the sale to take longer.''
Glasgow has always had a low level of home ownership compared with
other parts of the UK. But Ms Memery's research indicates that the
expansion of owner occupation in recent years has brought a new
sophistication into the West of Scotland market.
Her respondents seem more conservative in their approach to borrowing
than the banks and building societies which provide the loans. ''Quite a
few people mentioned that they were offered rather high loans based on
their salaries -- but decided to borrow a bit less than they were
offered because they were very conscious of the importance of meeting
their monthly repayments and did not want to overextend themselves.''
They are also choosy about what type of mortgage to take out. Some
were opting for fixed rates, especially in the first couple of years of
a new mortgage. Recent publicity had made them all wary about the value
of endowment mortgages.
''Some people complained about having had poor mortgage advice when
they bought their first home, but most seemed happy with the quality of
the advice they were getting when they were buying for the second or
third time.
''They had become more sophisticated -- and many felt that their
mortgage advisers had become fairer in explaining the advantages and
disadvantages of different types of mortgage.
''They have also become much more aware of the impact of reductions on
tax relief on mortgages and take their own job security into account
when deciding how much to borrow.''
The next stage of the research will compare the attitudes of
Glaswegian buyers and sellers with their counterparts in Bristol, a city
still deeply affected by the 1990 property crash.

VENTURE capital can often take on a European dimension. The first
investment fund aimed specifically at smaller listed and unquoted
companies in the insurance sector is up and running.
Hodgson Martin, independent investment manager to both institutional
and private clients, has designed the new Euro fund. The sum of $100m is
being raised.
Around 100 smaller listed companies with a market cap of less than
$750m have been identified, although the unquoted side of the business
is expected to provide the main interest.
Hodgson Martin is using as a model its Saltire Trust successfully
launched and eventually bid for by Aberdeen Trust.
The venture is genuinely unique with no-one else in Europe having
launched such a fund although in the United States there are several
insurance company specialist funds.
Subscribers to the Scottish fund involve a geographic spread of
Scottish and rest-of-UK, plus United States and from within continental
Europe.
Enormous European cultural differences are taken into account. Hodgson
Martin has identified that whatever the country, it will have to have
some kind of private sector solution necessary, to overcome a massive
pension-provider funding crisis developing due to an ageing population.

ON July 1 Avonside will open the doors of the most luxurious and
expensive property it has ever built. The four-bedroom Ptarmigan
showhouse will be the jewel in the crown of its Westward Rise
development.
At a selling price of #202,250 the Ptarmigan offers the ultimate in
luxury living. Built to a unique split-level design, the property
features four spacious bedrooms, lounge, living room, dining room,
utility room and cloakroom, and has a large balcony to the front
elevation.
For more than 22 years, Avonside has been renowned for its spacious
quality homes built in low-density prestigious estates, and has earned a
reputation for distinctive design, reliability and attention to detail.
The company's Westward Rise development is the embodiment of its
commitment to this philosophy. When complete, the estate will consist of
39 three and four-bedroom detached homes, ranging in price from #165,000
to #205,000.
A distinctive collection of five new housestyles has been introduced
at Westward Rise, all built to a split-level design over two, or
sometimes three floors. This feature enables maximum appreciation of the
views from this beautiful hillside location.
The new designs include the Swallow, which starts at #165,500. It is a
three-bedroomed detached property with large lounge (25'6" by 13'9"),
living room, dining room, study, utility room and cloakroom.
The four-bedroomed Jay which starts from #178,750, and the
four-bedroomed Tern which starts from #167,500, both include lounge,
dining room, utility room and store room. The Tern also has a sunken
dressing room in its master bedroom.
The Heron house style starts from #170,500 and provides four bedrooms,
a lounge, dining room, utility room and study.
All of the properties are being built on spacious plots, ensuring
ample garden areas. In addition, they have double garages, pavioured
driveways and turfed front gardens.
Included in the specification are quality hardwood doors, moulded
skirtings and facings and the plenty of cupboard and wardrobe space. All
of the master bedrooms have en-suite facilities and there are mirror
doors in the majority of the additional bedrooms.
Each new home comes complete with a range of quality fixtures and
fittings. Purchasers can make their selection from a variety of fitted
kitchens and bathrooms with ranges of complementary tiling which can be
colour co-ordinated to suit their chosen interior design.
Avonside has fitted smoke detectors and alarm systems as standard. And
every home comes with a 10-year NHBC guarantee.
The attention to detail is combined with the benefits of high
insulation/low running costs.
Avonside's managing director, Robert Gillespie comments: ''Westward
Rise is a clear demonstration of our sincere commitment to excellence.
The Ptarmigan showhouse will, I believe, give potential customers a
superb illustration of our architectural flexibility which allows us to
adapt our designs to suit the surrounding environment as well as
catering to individual tastes.
''We are delighted with the level of interest which has been generated
by this development and attribute it to the immense individuality and
quality of the homes and their excellent location.''
The interior of the showhome has been designed by one of Glasgow's
leading designers, Alexis Leech. And the fabrics and colours chosen to
decorate the house reflect an opulence in this spacious property.
Elegance begins in the vestibule where the carpet throughout the house
is in an unusual shade of gold. The theme continues in the downstairs
shower and cloakroom with a luxurious combination of black, gold and
white plaid on the walls with border and black marble tiles.
The lounge, which has patio doors opening on to a balcony, features
autumn shades of gold, burgundy and green with fabric from the United
States
The warm and inviting family room has been decorated in an informal
Aztec theme, yet parents with young children will appreciate its
practical dark green walls and cane furniture.
A bright and summery kitchen has been created with a pleasant use of
apple green and salmon pink to complement the quality limed oak units.
Upstairs, the ensuite master bedroom decor is in sumptuous blues and
yellows. The room has a large, bay window which has been designed as a
relaxing breakfast area with two sofas and a breakfast stool.
The fabric for the guest room is the creation of students at London's
Royal College of Art.
The remaining two bedrooms have been designed for teenagers. One of
the rooms will be fitted with captain's cabin furniture and feature
antique style hot air balloon fabric.
The final bedroom is bright and cheerful with wallpaper, curtains and
bedspread in the primary colours.
Westward Rise is ideally situated, with Glasgow's city centre a
15-minute drive, making it an excellent base for commuters. Families
will also benefit from the range of facilities available in the Bearsden
area; excellent schools, leisure and shopping complexes.
The advantages of the location of Westward Rise are clear. The
development's new showhome will be open Thursday-Monday, from 11am until
5.30pm from July 1, 1995.
For further information on the Westward Rise development please call
Avonside Homes on 0141 942 9076 or 01324 840909.
Avonside is also building developments at Biggar, Erskine and
Stewarton.

* THE Water of Leith weaves for 18 miles from its source in the
Pentland Hills to Leith Harbour and over the centuries has packed in the
provision of food, industry, jobs, and (more recently) walkway
relaxation. But above all, it is pretty -- and there can be no more
enticing prospect than living in the luxury housing built on the
waterfront by John Birnie Ltd.
Completed in April, Coltbridge Millside consists of 12 flats -- most
with south-facing lounge overlooking the river. It comes as no surprise
to learn they have sold quickly. One second-floor flat remains and it
will be a fortunate buyer who (for around #85,000) bags this last chance
to move into a property which impresses by its clever use of space.
''Arcade Architects' brief was to come up with a traditional building
with modern features,'' says Eddie King, Birnie's surveyor. ''Each house
has either a balcony or a conservatory extension to the dining room.''
Situated in the heart of Murrayfield, the Amsterdam-like development
is on three floors, with upper flats entering off a mutual carpeted
stairwell with secure entry-phone system. The flats represent this
20-year-old family firm's first venture into residential housing.
Between 1975 and 1992, the site was the scene of its own yard, and after
moving to Sighthill, it decided -- since it still owned the land -- to
set up the small development.
Built to a high specification, each flat has a lounge, dining area,
kitchen, two bedrooms (the larger with en suite facilities) plus shower
room/bathroom. Kitchens -- in dove grey and cream -- are fitted, with
stylish sink and tiled breakfast bar. Fitments include Neff oven and
hob, Ariston washing machine and drier and a recess for a
dishwasher/fridge freezer. Low-voltage spotlights add to the thought
behind the overall design.
Particularly effective is the way the architects have created an
impression of airiness and space by glass doors and high ''cathedral''
ceilings. Ground-floor flats have a penthouse feel with split levels,
galleries and irresistible exits to outdoor riverside terraces.
Lightness is achieved through pale colour schemes and mirrored wardrobe
doors.
But Coltbridge Millside's greatest asset has to be its location. Stand
at the french windows in the master bedroom, drink in the view -- the
willows dipping into the water, the ducks drifting by -- and all seems
well with the world.

VENTURE capital is here to stay in the overall financing scheme of
things. The industry has well and truly matured with the marketplace
currently awash with cash.
However, the traditional high degree of risk element is paradoxically
diminishing as venture capitalists demand more reward from companies
with less actual risk involved.
And knowledge rather than cash is now even more than before a source
of success and the real oracle for the industry as the millennium
approaches, according to experts in the field.
Also, there are indications that the bigger venture capital houses are
now taking a more serious look at the smaller company market.
Setting the scene, Tim Noble, Director of Noble &amp; Company, and a
specialist in corporate finance, said: ''It all started after the war
with 3i and there was a great expansion in the seventies, then falling
away but from the eighties onwards venture capital has gone from
strength to strength.''
It had to be remembered that venture capitalists were dependent upon
other people's money. They had to maintain performance in order to gain
more funds to manage. The practise had to be therefore, by its very
nature, highly selective.
So selective nowadays that a venture has to increasingly be virtually
risk free. The industry looks very carefully before going into a deal.
It turns down 80% of proposals received and then subsequently invests in
two-thirds of the remainder, and of those only 1-in-10 turns out a real
winner.
Peter Smaill of NatWest Ventures said that from the viewpoint of
buy-out teams this relatively new market had proved excellent gains.
Heightened competition to fund really strong corporate opportunities
with serious capital backing had become the order of the day.
However: ''The new key to investor differentiation is thus no longer
having cash, most will have that,'' he added. Rather, it is access to
research depth, and the ability to find out, work with, and
appropriately reward high quality management teams.
Tim Noble added that enterprises often forgot about the ''thinking
process'' that had to occur before a venture went ahead. Of the UK
abroad, he forecast: ''There will be more growth in the concert of
Europe rather than the UK because of starting from a lower base.'' Yet,
very few venture capitalists were looking at that area.
Meanwhile back home, Bank of Scotland structured finance reports
highly significant venture capital deals. Donald Stark, associate
director, said they always adopted what they termed a sensible approach
towards clinching a deal.
With a team of eight he reported an extremely active market in MBOs,
MBIs and acquisition finance for existing clients: ''We constantly look
at how to go forward,'' he explained. Work had doubled during the bulk
of the 1990s, as the bank jealously guarded its specialist MBO position.
Venture capital is not always of course about the big deals which do
tend to dominate the headlines. Scotland also sees its fair share of
investments at the smaller end of the market.
British Steel (Industry) has been involved in hundreds of investments
over the past decade. Together with British Coal (Enterprise) these
important bodies help fill the #40,000-#150,000 equity funding gap.
BS(I) has reacted over the years to the growing realisation that small
businesses have particular requirements when it comes to venture
capital.
John Fairlie, Scottish manager, said: ''People are becoming more aware
that this sector is important to the Scottish economy, hence the recent
announcement of the Scottish Enterprise strategy to improve the
country's business birthrate.''
Financing of small start-ups and early stage businesses has never been
easy and it is probably more difficult now than at any time in the
recent past. Larger venture houses have traditionally tended to avoid
the smaller sector, perhaps regarding it as too expensive and riskier
than involvement in more established companies.
Additionally such investments require longer-term horizons than the
bigger houses are perhaps willing to accept. Yet, realistic investment
opportunities do exist, especially if traditional venture capital rules
are adapted to meet smaller business needs.
Yet, one of the so-called bigger boys, Dunedin Enterprise Investment
Trust does claim to specialise in provision of development capital to
small and growing companies. This perhaps augers well for the future.
Dunedin says it exists to achieve long-term growth in its assets
through capital gains from investments and net assets increased by 40%
from #34.9m last year, to a record #48.8m at April 30 last. A sign of
things to come?
Back to the banks, and Royal Bank Development Capital was the latest
arrival on the UK and Scottish venture capital scene when it was
established in Edinburgh in the early autumn of 1993.
Since then Scottish-based RBDC has invested more than #70m in a wide
range of companies and focuses especially on servicing local firms.
Earlier this month a #10m-plus project represented what is believed to
be the largest development capital deal in Scotland this year.
The deal has enabled George and Jim Lindsay, founders of Lindsay
Plant, one of the country's leading plant hire companies, to realise
part of their shareholdings, while simultaneously providing shares for
other members of the senior management team. New Lindsay Plant managing
director Paul Garvey said: ''The transaction provides the company with
finance for significant expansion.''
To conclude, a recent review of the buy-out market by KPMG Corporate
Finance contained a warning of dual reasons for overpaying. First,
venture capital was awash with cash: at the last count #3.75bn may find
its way into buyouts this year alone; and secondly, an aggressive wave
of competing in general takeover activity was afoot.
Venture capitalists could therefore be heading for auction fever but
as for the past, it appears Britain has moved away from the ''Beaujolais
Nouveau'' culture of the eighties and on to a slower harvesting and
holding of older portfolios.

THE recent launch of AIM (Alternative Investment Market), the Stock
Exchange's new market for smaller growing companies, has been hailed as
the start of a new era in raising capital for the smaller business.
Venture capital will form a central component of AIM which is designed
to create a new public market for young, expanding firms that lack the
required track record to gain access to the full list.
According to a recent CBI/Pannell Kerr Forster economic report, while
entry requires a full commitment in the early stages, small company
directors should not be put off.
''Much of the process is handled by the advisers who will be on hand
to guide directors on AIM obligations, ensure compliance with rules and
provide continuing advice,'' the report advises.
Gavin Don, a partner with Equitas ''business angel'' management
consultants and former Hambros corporate finance man, was instrumental
in setting up AIM on the reference group technical side through Scottish
Financial Enterprise.
He said: ''The key factor is that AIM provides for an uncomplicated
introduction to the smaller company as a way of attracting the
attentions of prospective investors.''
Reference group colleague Graham Watson of Touche Ross corporate
finance, said that regardless of the speed of evolution, it was
essential that the Stock Exchange ensured AIM's success.
''While I welcome the inevitable flow of new business which AIM will
create for my firm, I am nevertheless concerned that the market could be
something of a poisoned chalice if it is not promoted carefully.''
Mr Watson added that he was, however, willing to accept the challenge
of playing a full role in making the new concept work to ensure it
became a suitable vehicle for funding corporate development.
Scotland still needed to support growing companies however the funding
was provided.
The CBI report concludes that any company, whether well established or
with little or no track record, should take advice and assess whether it
is suitable to participate in AIM.

HERE is a stinker for the sports round of your pub quiz: Who carried
Britain's flag at the opening ceremony of the Barcelona Olympics?
Answer: Steve Redgrave, Britain's most successful oarsman, who then
went on to win his third successive Olympic gold in Spain. He now looks
well on the way to gold in Atlanta next year, which would make him
Britain's most successful Olympian and only the fourth person to take
titles at four successive Games.
Along with his young partner Matthew Pinsent, Redgrave, who will
retire after Atlanta, sets out on his last competitive campaign in
Britain at this week's Henley Royal Regatta, which gets under way today.
By the time next year's Henley comes round, this seemingly invincible
partnership will be embroiled in a pre-Olympic training camp in North
America, so while most of the massive crowds that line the Thames this
week will not realise it, they will be witnessing the domestic swan song
of one of Britain's most talented athletes.
Not surprisingly, Redgrave will be setting records at Henley this week
if he delivers his expected victories on Sunday. He will win the coxless
pairs event for a record seventh time and if, along with three Leander
clubmates, he and Pinsent also win in coxed fours, that will give him a
record 15 Henley titles.
However, while he is glad to win prestigious titles on his home patch,
Redgrave is focused on the biggest prize of all. ''I'd trade it all for
the Atlanta gold,'' he confirms.
Although the next Olympic Games is over a year away, all other
forthcoming events, including this year's World championships in
Finland, are just milestones on the way to what Redgrave sees as sport's
greatest prize. ''Mentally, I feel switched on,'' he confirms. ''I don't
want to blow it at the last hurdle. I feel very motivated and I think we
can go faster than we have done.''
This philosophy is more than just bravado. In a sport where top
athletes can join together in various combinations, Redgrave and Pinsent
see part of their job as making other nations believe they are an
invincible pair, thereby persuading other squads to put their best
athletes into different boat classes. Redgrave is clear on this point:
''Our aim is to win in style and comfortably, to make our opponents
believe they can't win.''
Redgrave and Pinsent are both giants, capable of looking All Black
Jonah Lomu in the eye, and they will be virtually untroubled this week
at Henley. With the top pre-World championship event at Lucerne just one
week ago this year, most of the world's top crews are staying away from
the Edwardian riverside tea-party.
The British pair's final opposition look likely to come from Japan's
lightweight squad, who made it to their first ever world final last year
in Indianapolis. However, in other events this week, world-class
competitors will fight out the finals, including Vaclav Chalupa of the
Czech Republic and Switzerland's Zeno Muller in the diamond sculls, and
the USA world champion eight in the Grand Challenge Cup.
The Scottish entry to the regatta this year comes from Castle Semple,
who race Germany's Favorit Hammonia in the Queen Mother Cup for quad
sculls, St Andrew (Edinburgh), who have drawn Oxford outfit Nephthys in
the Thames Cup for eights, and London in the Britannia Cup for coxed
fours.
In the small boats events, Aberdeen's Richard Harris and Drew Hendry
face a York City duo in their opener. Success this week would give them
the dubious honour of facing Redgrave and Pinsent in the semi-finals,
while Commonwealth and World bronze medalist Fiona Freckleton faces
Sweden's Maria Brandin in a testing opening round encounter in the
women's sculls event tomorrow.

PARTICK Thistle players, unhappy at the lack of bonus money for their
frontier-breaking Intertoto Cup appearances, can surely take some
consolation from the words of their caring chairman, Jim Oliver.
With all the generosity of a Victorian colliery owner, the Firhill
supremo dismisses the complaints of the players and points out: ''The
club takes them abroad, feeds them, clothes them and gives them money to
spend.''
Now, what workforce could ask for more than that from a benevolent
boss?
There they all were, dragged away from their close season to take part
in a tournament that no-one in the country had heard of until last
season, making a gruelling journey across Europe, and then playing
against an Austrian team with a European pedigree which probably matches
their own.
Their reward for all of that was food and board, track suits to travel
in (which the club probably get free) and #20 spending money after they
had managed to draw 2-2 with Linzer ASK to keep a place in the UEFA Cup
within reach.
The players may well have looked forward to a taste of European
football, even though it was coming at the bottom end of that often
lucrative market. But the decision to take part was surely made by the
chairman and his fellow directors.
If Thistle have any desire to aim for the big time, and by putting
themselves forward for this strange tournament they suggest that is
their desire, then surely the club have to act like big-timers.
Telling players they are being fed and watered for all their efforts
on behalf of the club is hardly the way to do that.
I would suggest that Mr Oliver take a look at REALLY big clubs and see
how their players are treated. He would be in for a major surprise.
I recognise that the Firhill club cannot pay vast bonuses the way
Rangers or Celtic would in Europe. But there is no need to talk of the
players as virtual serfs who should be grateful for any crumbs which
fall from the boardroom table. These days are over, and rightly so.
I have travelled with most of the Scottish sides who have been in
European competition over the past 30 years and in every case the
efforts of the players were recognised by the directors as being
absolutely vital in raising the stature of the clubs involved.
Mr Oliver will have to depend on his players if he is to hit the hoped
for bonanza of a UEFA Cup place. He would do well to remember that
before he tells them how lucky they are to get a bed for the night when
they go abroad next time.

Edinburgh journalist JAMES ROBERTSON charts the progress businessman
Jim Glass is making in his attempt to wrestle control of Heart of
Midlothian football club from the hands of the present incumbents, Chris
Robinson and Leslie Deans, and the influence that former chairman
Wallace Mercer may or may not be exerting on affairs.
THE phoney war over the future ownership of Heart of Midlothian FC is
about to develop into real confrontation if Edinburgh property developer
Jim Glass lives up to his declared intention to translate his recent
sabre-rattling into action.
Glass has said that he will back up his verbal interest in taking over
the Tynecastle club with a formal, written offer, to be delivered this
week.
The comments over the four weeks since he revealed his desire to
unhand the reins from Chris Robinson and Leslie Deans, who have held
them for a year, have remained muted, restrained and, some might say,
very Edinburgh.
Perhaps the expectation of more acidic exchanges lies in the
perception of the audience, yet to become accustomed to the fact that
Wallace Mercer no longer rules at Tynecastle. The script so far would
have been more trenchant were he still principal.
The absence of drama, however, could prove a mere lull. After all,
Glass has only started his run-up to the ball. And Robinson and Deans
are not types to dive before the striker has connected.
It will only be once Robinson and Deans know the power of his shot,
with the arrival of an offer document, that their script can be expected
to liven up.
''It certainly won't happen before the middle of the week, not before
Wednesday,'' said Glass last week. At 62 he professes to be occupying a
back seat in his property development business, Glassedin Commercial
Ltd, based in Charlotte Square, Edinburgh, and delegating more and more
to his two sons.
He was not showing his hand and was unwilling to clarify the verbal
proposal he outlined to Robinson on June 1. That, reportedly, involved
an initial investment of #2m, to be ploughed immediately into new
playing talent, a matching sum soon afterwards, and, eventually, a new
shares issue.
The closest to a progress report he would give was that there was ''a
lot going on behind the scenes.''
Since then, he has been silent. But a source very close to Glass said
that there was no indication that the developer's timing had changed. So
the incumbents at Tynecastle do not have long to wait to gauge the
strength of the threat.
Glass is no novice at attracting investment. He was joint developer
for a giant edge-of-town retail complex east of Edinburgh and is
currently involved in a #20m extension. ''It's a good scheme and it will
be open for Christmas 1996,'' he enthused.
Hearts fans are more concerned with the state of the club a Christmas
sooner than then.
Glass' success as a property developer does not endear him to cynics
among the Tynecastle support, who have an in-built suspicion of the
breed and their possible designs on the ground. Some harbour further
suspicions about Glass' previous connections.
They recall Wallace Mercer's property interests and his theory that
Hearts could be transported from Gorgie to a greenfield site.
Those fields of dreams were conceived by Mercer in the early nineties.
There was the Millerhill plan to flit to the eastern outskirts of
Edinburgh, too close for many to Hibbie badlands, in which Glass would
have been the developer. And there was the vision of a new Tynecastle at
Hermiston, on the opposite extremity, but no more acceptable to
tradition-hugging punters.
Those grand designs -- like Mercer's bid for city rivals Hibernian FC,
which proved a disastrous personal public relations -- petered out.
There was opposition from planners to the scale of the non-football
commercial elements, the costs -- and the thumbs-down from the
turnstile-users.
Glass scoffs at the suggestion that a buck could be made from an
alternative use for the hallowed ground. ''Tynecastle has little or no
value for property development,'' he insisted.
He is dismissive of the suggestion that he cannot be considered a
dyed-in-maroon Jambo because of an apparent allegiance to Hibs in the
sixties when he was at Easter Road and Tynecastle on alternate
Saturdays.
''If Hearts were playing Hibs in those days, I did have a slight
preference for Hibs,'' he conceded. He said, however, that he has long
since been more inclined towards Tynecastle.
Glass brushed off fearful speculation among fans that Mercer figures
in his aspirations and that success would involve the former chairman,
who retains a 25% holding in the club and left a #1m guarantee with its
bankers, as a major influence again.
He has been adamant that Mercer is not in the plan. Mercer himself has
reiterated his lack of ambition to make anything resembling a comeback.
Hearts' Shareholders' Association dread the resumption, even in a
watered-down form, of the former supremo's 13-year reign. When Glass
came into the frame, they stated that minority shareholders would want
to be free to sell if Mercer was to return from self-imposed exile in
the South of France.
Mercer was welcomed with open arms 14 years ago as a white knight come
to rescue Hearts from the verge of bankruptcy by buying it for #350,000.
Robinson, managing-director of Wheatsheaf Catering, who with solicitor
Deans made an initial #1.27m payment to allow Mercer to bow out this
time last year, takes the attitude that the board will believe Glass'
offer when they see it.
Meantime, he is concentrating on the job in hand.
Despite close to #4m debt, he speaks confidently of the club being in
''good heart'' and progressing with the development of the stadium to
meet Taylor Report requirements.
''The board are united and we have our plans to get some fresh
investment into the club,'' he said.
''That will be done quietly. Our policy will be judged by our actions
rather than our words. There will be no great announcements. We will go
out and do it.''
Robinson has no intention of becoming prematurely involved in a
slagging match. He prefers to talk about how well season-ticket sales
are going and about progress in the building programme, on schedule to
provide 3600 more seats for the new season.
''It will eventually be one of the best stadiums in Scotland,'' he
said.
He does have other things on his mind -- such as the recent flurry of
litigation involving himself and Deans on the one hand and Mercer on the
other.
Last June, as Mercer handed over the reins to the pair, he was lauding
them as ''suitable incumbents in a financial and personal sense.''
The pleasantries are past. Robinson and Deans have raised an action
for #1.2m against Mercer through his company, Cosmopolitan, over alleged
breaches of warranties involved in the sale to their New Hearts company,
through which they bought control.
And Cosmopolitan have launched an action against New Hearts, Robinson
and Deans, complaining at their failure to pay a #125,000 instalment of
the deferred price for control.
A courtroom tussle is not what really concerns Hearts fans. Their
interest lies in the outcome of any bid for Hearts and its effect on the
club.
Most would share the views of prominent Hearts fan Eric Milligan,
convener of Lothian region and convener of the new authority that takes
charge of Edinburgh next year.
He, naturally, wants Hearts to enjoy the benefit of a management that
can afford to splash out on the playing side and make the trophy room
appear better dressed and worthy of its long history, which began in
1874.
''If there are people in the streets with more money to give than the
people running the club at present, I would like to think that they
would get sympathetic consideration,'' he said.
Milligan worries about the club's ability to trade itself out of its
indebtedness and continue to meet the challenges of recreating the
stadium and, simultaneously, boosting the playing strength.
He is delighted with the progress on the stadium and only hopes that
Robinson and Deans can continue the momentum.
Like other Jambos, he is awaiting to see Glass' hand with interest,
but is concerned that uncertainty and perhaps a change of ownership
might mean an unsettled period for manager Tommy McLean and his squad.
As far as he and others who follow Hearts through thick and thin are
concerned, the sooner the takeover business is settled, one way or the
other, the better.
They want no major distraction from efforts to re-establish Hearts as
a force on the field. And who would deny that the Gorgie faithful
deserve to be spared a long, hot summer that might take the edge off the
club's determination to live less dangerously next season.

THE world's biggest relocation company has appointed two prominent
estate agents to act as its representatives in central Scotland. After
anonymously surveying services of several agencies in the Glasgow area,
PHH Relocation Centre network selected Clyde Property and the Robb
Agency.
PHH moves over 40,000 families a year world-wide and its criteria for
licensing local estate agents focus on owner-involvement, local
knowledge and experience, dedication to quality, and ability to sell
more houses.
Bill Cullens, managing director of Clyde Property, says: ''I am
delighted that the quality of our service has been recognised and
selected by PHH, particularly as it was judged from anonymous visits and
assessments. We have always tried to provide an outstanding personal
service to our clients and it's great to have our efforts independently
acclaimed like this.''
A sentiment echoed by Ian Robb, MD of the Robb Agency -- ''We had no
idea we were being checked by PHH, and we are delighted that our service
is seen to be worthy of such an acknowledgement.''
Membership of the PHH Relocation Centre will enable the agents to
introduce cash buyers from PHH clients moving into the area.

TRADE talks tend to be dull, and negotiations over the tariffs on car
parts must be about the most boring imaginable. As one paper reported at
last Saturday's Geneva talks between Japan and the US, two of the
lower-level Japanese officials sitting behind their principals could be
seen sound asleep. They were awoken abruptly when one of the Americans,
perhaps also dropping off, fell off his chair.
But these are crucial talks. If they are not resolved by midnight
tonight American time, the US will begin a trade war with Japan. It will
slap 100% tariffs on $6000m of Japanese imports, 13 types of luxury
motor car, effectively excluding them from the American market.
Japan might retaliate. If it did, the repercussions would be enormous:
President Clinton would retaliate and the whole dispute could escalate.
On the other hand, since Japan has a $60bn a year trade surplus with the
US, it would obviously suffer more.
It would be fruitless to guess how this will work out, but there are
strong political reasons why neither side wants to back down. President
Clinton has a hard-earned reputation for wishy-washiness. This time he
has nailed his colours to the mast and expects to win the plaudits and
cheers of American workers.
Others, of course, will be hurt by a trade war. If Japan now cuts off
wheat or apple imports, American producers will protest vigorously.
In 1980, in protest against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan,
President Carter banned the export of wheat to the USSR. His Republican
rival for the presidency, Ronald Reagan, denounced him simultaneously
for being soft on communism and hurting American farmers -- and won the
election easily. He then lifted the grain embargo. Someone at the White
House ought to remember the unhappy Carter experience.
On the other side, the chief Japanese trade negotiator, Ryutaro
Hashimoto, who arrived in Geneva on Monday evening, wants to be Prime
Minister when the present Japanese Government collapses. Facing up to
the US is an excellent electoral gambit.
The President's critics say he is too ham-fisted, that he ought to
take the dispute to the new World Trade Organisation (WTO). It has all
sorts of regulations against unfair trade practices, and it might very
well rule against Japan, one of these days.
But this is a dispute that goes back 20 years, and the key to it all
is beyond dispute. The Japanese cheat on tariffs.
They claim they have open markets, but they don't. On the contrary,
there is a vast conspiracy between the Japanese Ministry of Trade and
Industry (MITI) and its industry to keep out foreign competition.
Japan is the most protectionist major country in the world. The
American photo-film giant, Kodak, has just produced a comprehensive
report to demonstrate the fact.
Kodak is by far the world's biggest producer of film, with 70% of the
American market and 40% of Europe's. In Japan it has less than 8% of the
market.
The new chairman of the company set his sleuths to work to discover
why, and they reported that MITI and Fuji, the Japanese film-makers, use
every trick in the book to keep Kodak out of Japan.
Naturally, the Japanese consumer suffers severely. Film is far more
expensive in Japan than elsewhere. The same thing applies to a whole
slew of other products. Catch a plane at a big airport with flights to
Japan, and you will see the duty-free shops selling beef.
Japanese flying home take their allowance, five or 10 pounds, pay
American prices, and the meat is shipped for them in their plane's
freezer, to escape the astronomical duties that the Japanese beef
industry imposes on meat imports.
Japan pursues the same policies of ruthless selfishness towards all
its other trade partners, including Europe and developing Asian
countries like South Korea or Indonesia. It uses the enormous income
from its trade surplus to buy the raw materials it needs, stripping
Borneo or Brazilian jungles of hardwood at prices only Japan can afford.
Finally there was a small breakthrough last year when Japan imported a
small quantity of rice. It now buys American apples and wheat, too, but
essentially it remains a closed market.
Mr Clinton concluded that the time had come to insist that Japan lives
by the rules obeyed by the US, the EU, and most of the rest of the
world. America is the only country big enough to take the lead and
insist -- provided it does not blink at the last moment. We will see.

With Sir Gavin Laird set to retire on Friday, Roy Rogers charts the
life and times of the union leader who earned the respect of industry
and politicians of all persuasions.
THE retirement this week of one of Scotland's best-known and most
influential trade union leaders, Sir Gavin Laird, represents the end of
an era for Scottish engineers, the Amalgamated Engineering and
Electrical Union, and the Scottish trade union movement.
Sir Gavin was in his office in Peckham, South London, for the last
time yesterday before his official retirement, three years early, on
Friday at which time he will have served the AEEU, or AEU as it was for
most of his period, for some 33 years.
During that time he has proved a shrewd negotiator and administrator,
never ducking a challenge that needed to be confronted, and if he upset
people in the process so be it. Gavin Laird has never courted popularity
in the way that some do but he has earned the respect of colleagues and,
more than any other trade union leader of his time, of industry and
politicians of all persuasions.
Packing away his effects at the Peckham Road offices which are soon to
be vacated by the AEEU after a history-laden 95 years, Sir Gavin
reminisced over his humble origins in Clydebank where he attended the
local high school before starting work at the giant Singer factory which
sadly is no more.
His potential was apparent and he was soon elected shop steward, which
led on to him becoming full-time convenor of the huge Singer site before
he was 30.
Full-time union office beckoned 10 years later and within a further
three he was elected on to the AEU executive representing Scotland in
succession to John (later Sir John) Boyd who he subsequently succeeded
as AEU general secretary.
From that key position he successfully managed the depletion in
membership which hit many unions while avoiding the financial disaster
which has often accompanied it. He also played a pivotal role in the
prolonged amalgamation negotiations with the EETPU electricians and did
more than anyone to ensure they succeeded and that the amalgamation went
ahead bringing the EETPU back into the TUC fold, from which it had been
expelled five years earlier, in the process.
AEU membership peaked at 1.2 million in the late 70s, but as the
recession took hold it plummeted to some 500,000 today which with the
electrical section (the old EETPU) gives the current combined AEEU
membership of 800,000.
Gavin Laird, who was made a CBE under the Thatcher administration and
knighted earlier this year at the behest of the Prime Minister, has
always been his own man ploughing his often-innovative furrow and taking
lots of flack in the process only for his ideas to be accepted later.
As he reminded me yesterday he was the first to advocate taking state
funds for ballots and to support single-union agreements -- two issues
which almost saw the AEU thrown out of the TUC at the time. Both are now
commonplace.
He has also fostered the concept that unions and employers really have
much more in common than that which divides them: successful and
profitable companies being the best type for unions to deal with.
In line with this concept Gavin Laird stunned many of his trade union
colleagues by addresssing the CBI annual confence in 1986. Others
including TUC general secretary John Monks have since followed suit.
And for more than a decade he has been promoting a modern relationship
between the unions and the Labour Party, including the ending of union
block voting at Labour Party conferences and the introduction of a more
''arm's length'' approach to the unions which has since been taken up by
the Labour leadership.
''What Tony Blair is saying must happen should have happened a long
time ago'', he maintains, adding that he had never believed in union
barons trying to dictate to Labour.
Probably the most striking aspect of Sir Gavin's career is the extent
to which he was welcomed by private industry, commerce, and the arts,
not to mention his very successful eight-year stint as a governor of the
Bank of England. He has been a part-time member of the SDA, a director
of BNOC, the Arts Council of Great Britain, and the Forrestry
Commission.
His impressive list of non-executive directorships still includes
Scottish TV, GEC, Scotland, Britannia Life, and Edinburgh Investment
Trust, while he is also non-executive chairman of employee buy-out
Greater Manchester Buses North.
As if this was not enough to keep him busy in his ''retirement'', Sir
Gavin begins a new, and unpaid, venture next month when he is due to
join the Armed Forces Pay Review Body.
Finding sufficient time to pack in all these activities would seem to
be his main problem. Money seems less of one because, in addition to
what he picks up from his non-executive directorships, Sir Gavin will
receive a one-off payment of around #30,000 and continue to receive his
AEEU salary until he is 65 in three years' time under the terms of an
early retirement package on offer to all AEEU executive members and
national officials over 60.
Five have now taken advantage of the offer and a further two or three
are expected to do so over the next year under a plan to reduce the
22-strong executive to a more manageable size. Only then can full
amalgamation proceed.
The pay-offs were not extortionate, were ''no more and no less than we
are negotiating for our members out there'', and would save the union a
lot of money, says Sir Gavin.
The retirement of Sir Gavin, who intends remaining in Bromley because
his wife Reena likes the warmer weather in the south, although he also
planned to buy himself a flat in Glasgow as his Scottish base, leaves
the AEEU without a Scottish top official for the first time in more than
20 years.
He leaves the union in good financial shape -- the AEU section has a
surplus of some #5m -- but regrets the unavoidable fall in membership,
especially in Scotland, where AEEU members have been hit harder than
elsewhere in Britain and the fact that there remains no breakthrough
into the ''Silicon Glen'' electronics sector.

WEIRD vibes from the Glastonbury festival where, as usual, police were
tireless in their efforts to track down people selling or ingesting
chemicals whose legal status is a mite questionable.
The odd part was, the plods found themselves accepting the surrender
of numerous, panicking victims of an impure drug. This toxin had the
effect of rendering them utterly paranoid, so much so that they became
absolutely convinced they were being followed. Which, given the fact
that the cops made some 700 arrests, they were.
Ears to the ground
WHAT chance, after everything else that's happened to the Tory party,
of Mr Spock suing John Redwood for bringing Vulcans into disrepute?
Actually, as movie analogies go, the Star Trek thing isn't up to much.
Contemplating the erstwhile Welsh Secretary -- must all Tory leadership
challengers possess the eyes of Glastonbury drug victims? -- The
Invasion of the Body Snatchers seems much more apt. News coverage on
''stun'', Captain . . .
Plug pulled on Xmas
SOME among you will be relieved to hear that a couple in President
Clinton's home town of Little Rock, Arkansas, have just lost their
battle to be allowed to celebrate Christmas all the year round.
Last week the Supreme Court, no less, rejected a request from Jennings
and Mitzi Osborne for review of lower court decisions against their
Christmas display. Not just a fairy and a plastic tree, you understand,
but an exhibition containing millions of bulbs. This being America, the
Osbornes -- he a Baptist, she a Catholic -- were appealing on religious
grounds.
Their lawyers argued that the display contained important religious
symbols which were ''manifestations'' of sincere beliefs. The couple's
neighbours said the light show, which had been going on since 1986, was
just a damnable nuisance, having grown from 1,700,000 bulbs in 1992 to
3,200,000 in 1993. The Osbornes were also in the habit of providing loud
festive music for the many brain-dead people who came, even in June, to
gawp.
As for the line about religious symbols, the neighbours offered the
legal equivalent of ''Oh, yeah?'' and pointed out that God appeared on
the scene only after they filed suit. The part in the display occupied
by a Nativity scene and a choir of angels, they said, had previously
been filled by Saint Mickey Mouse driving a steam train along the top of
a wall.
As the Americans like to say, the lights were on but there was no-one
home.
Situations vacant
A LATE entrant for our Sensible Things Said About the Legal Profession
slot.
What do you get when you hammer the crap out of a lawyer? Answer: an
empty suit.
Take it as Red
NICE to see the Labour left hasn't given up the fight. Here's Ken
Livingstone, once known to capitalist leeches everywhere as ''Red'',
really putting the boss class in its place in a hard-hitting article for
Esquire magazine: ''My guest had the pressed guinea fowl with
caramelised shallots, which could have been a main course on its own,
and I chose breast of duck on a bed of couscous with a maize pancake. My
guest tucked into best end of lamb and we both demolished a huge portion
of mashed potatoes . . . After nougat glace with raspberry sauce and
caramelised apple-tart we staggered out into the night #70 lighter but
much happier.''
All together now: ''To secure for the workers by hand or by brain the
full fruits of their industry and the most equitable distribution
thereof that may be possible . . . Failing that, a table for two at
Simply Nico.''
Up and atom
WE can't imagine why, but British Nuclear Fuels Ltd feels you should
know it has just spent #5m refurbishing the visitors' centre at
Windscale.
Sorry, Sellafield.
The 10 ''exhibition zones'' include ''the Reactor'', described as ''a
light-and-sound drama creating the sensation of being in the heart of a
reactor''. Can't wait, eh? Then there's ''Recyclorama'', in which a
''Mighty Atom character rides overhead on a nuclear transportation
flask, telling the fascinating facts on the safe recycling of nuclear
fuel''. Anyone interested in unsafe recycling can apply elsewhere.
If that isn't enough, you can also ''have a go at generating your own
electricity by pedal power''. It might just be us, but isn't that
precisely the opposite of what the nuclear industry is all about?
What we really want to know, and have thus far failed to find amid the
bumff and glossy pictures supplied by BNFL, is why the nuclear industry
is obsessed with advertising itself. Apart from Sellafield there are now
seven ''Nuclear Electric Power House Visitor's Centres'' in the UK, each
busy educating people about a process that is squeaky clean, wondrously
cheap, and never known to go wrong in any way whatever.
You'd almost imagine they thought people didn't trust them.

PARKLIFE: in the early hours, before the milk float begins its hum,
before the commuter traffic starts its buzz, and long before this
columnist begins to brush her teeth, and sometimes before she's even
gone to bed, a white tunic'ed individual pads into the local park and
begins his morning meditation.
He's been glimpsed on occasions through the bleary haze of all-night
revelry, a calm and solitary figure totally absorbed in his yoga
contortions, hands slicing through the air with great deliberation and
elegance. As he strikes his Buddha-like poses he radiates an awesome
serenity, gazing out across the expanse of parkland like a monarch
surveying his domain, yet clearly seeing something more meaningful than
the fussy shrubs, duck pond, and skateboard park beyond.
His park is a tranquil one, unlike the seedy terrain prowled at night
by assorted miscreants, clutching bottles of cider, lovers, or
themselves. And quite unlike the noisy, bustling hotbed of flesh the
dear green place becomes in sunny weather. Normally used only by
keep-fit enthusiasts, dog-walkers, teenage lovers, and deviant old men,
Scotland's parks are suddenly more over-populated than a Manilan garbage
dump.
The seemingly simple expedition to the park becomes fraught with
anxiety on arrival as you face up to the gangs of city dwellers who have
decanted from their sweaty tenements to stake out their space. They
claim their territory by stretching out across the ground, leg and arms
spread, like faded butterflies pinned to a board.
It's like arriving in a cinema and trying to work out the perfect seat
for optimum viewing and listening pleasure -- should it be the middle
row dead centre, or will a bunch of younsters spend the whole film
climbing over you to go to the toilet? Sit at the front and strain your
neck or sit at the back and strain your eye? Behind the woman with the
big hair or beside the canoodling couple? Thank goodness the trailers
give you time to work it out.
Choosing your sunbathing position is a similarly vital and terifying
decision. That nice shady spot over by the swing-park where even the
best headphones on your Walkman won't drown out the wails and whines of
knee-grazed tots? Settle on the hill beside the bunch of jakies, the
squad of oafs who have clearly paid their New Lads dues, or the giggling
teenage girls, daring each other to strip down to a bra?
You settle for a spot beside a tranquil New Agey family, who present a
perfect vision of pastoral charm; cute dippy hippy mum, cute earinged
hubby, cute near-naked baby, and cute doggie. Two hours and six cans of
Special Brew later and they're the sunbathing neighbours from hell; mum,
who's swearing like a well-seasoned trouper, has changed the shrieking
baby's nappy, leaving the contents to fester in the heat in an
over-demonstrative statement of earthiness, dad's guffawing oikishly as
he aims some ''playful'' kicks at the raddled mongrel who is spitting
and snarling with such rabid fury that you're too terrified to move a
muscle and creep off to a calmer spot.
Forget tranquillity. The park has become a dangerous zone; one false
move and you could be the victim of someone else's hobby. Those French
kids behind you are waiting to slice through your skull with their
Frisbee, the New Lads are amusing themselves by continually pitching
their footie uphill into the gaggle of girlies, and a trip to the
ice-cream van involves negotiating assembled packs of skateboarders,
rollerbladers, and mountain bike riders whose mission in life seems to
be to run you to the ground.
It could get worse. If you're with mates someone will invariably
suggest getting a picnic. Sounds simple, turns out to be traumatic. You
end up in the nearest and most expensive delicatessen handing over a
week's grocery money for stuff you don't normally eat, like jars of
capers and apple woodsmoked cheddar. By the time you get back to the
park it will have either melted into a gooey, cheesey mess or look
half-cooked, with lumps of salami sizzling unappetisingly in the plastic
carrier bag.
You sigh, drink the fizzy, vinegary screw-top wine (you forgot to pack
your Swiss Army knife with its useful bottle opener and child torturing
implements) and put on your Walkman, humming along to the appropriate
tune of Blur's Parklife. A passing Mr Blobby gives you a baleful glare.
Oops! You've been singing along -- ''You should cut down on your
pork-life mate -- get some exercise.''
Certainly, you can't move for tripping over chaps, and chapesses, who
have been over-indulging on the old pork pie front. Or maybe that should
be mince pies (''och, ye should cut down on yer mince-life, son -- get
some exercise''). For a nation customarily characterised as having a
chip on our shoulders we're surprisingly unabashed about parading
ourselves in public, showing off a largesse of flesh to go belly up and
bake.
All over the park people are roasting away nicely. By the evening the
pinkish shade settling over the duck pond is not from the sun setting
but from the radioactive glare coming from the hundreds of barbecued
chest and shins. We finally pick up our dusty tartan shawls, our
Frisbees and our Walkmans and depart. We don't pick up our empty wine
bottles, crisp packets, steaming nappies, and mangled cans. Pity the
poor parkies who have to clean it all up for the next day, in time for
the dawn meditator who finds it afresh.

Two teenage girls hang themselves at Scotland's only women's prison:
James Freeman reports that it is time for a fresh examination of how
vulnerable inmates are received.
PRISON suicides are complex, and there are no easy solutions. That
much everyone knows, and there has been extensive research both here and
abroad in recent years reaffirming that view.
It is, however, deeply distressing not only to immediate family but to
society as a whole when a young person reaches such a point of despair
that their only way out is to take their own life. When it happens to
two 17-year-old girls in Scotland's only women's jail -- a modern, airy,
well-appointed, liberally-run establishment with an enlightened governor
-- then it is surely time for swift action.
Political pressure is already building for more urgent action than at
present appears to be taking place in the Scottish Prison Service. Moves
are already being considered which will redraw regimes for women in
prison in Scotland. That will include more refined approaches to the
assessment of the vulnerable.
The first call for more urgent measures surely came 10 years ago with
the Glenochil suicide cluster but, while Scottish prisons in general
have seen many signal improvements, and much innovative thinking since,
it might appear to the uninformed that there has been a certain amount
of hand-flapping in relation to prisoner suicides.
Against a background of a record 16 such deaths last year, a full
review of suicide prevention procedures is being undertaken by a
professor of forensic psychiatry from London University who will report
in the autumn. At the same time, Dr Kevin Power, a Stirling University
consultant clinical-psychologist, was commissioned to review SPS current
policy. He has researched the deaths and has sought the opinions of 200
staff and 200 prisoners. Scottish prisons have been caught out by recent
events. Now they are seeking the outside view.
Yet 10 years ago, in investigating a cluster of hanging suicides among
youths at the section of Glenochil Prison reserved for young offenders,
an eminent forensic psychiatrist, Dr Derek Chiswick, remarked that the
only way to prevent suicide at the prison would be to stop vulnerable
offenders reaching there in the first place.
Nothing has changed in that respect, and what was true then of
Glenochil is just as true of every other Scottish jail, including
Cornton Vale Women's Prison, today. It seems obvious that many
vulnerable people are not being filtered out by present procedures.
At that time Dr Chiswick also pointed out that the prison had no power
to select its inmates, requiring to take everyone the courts chose to
send. That included many young people showing varying combinations of
emotional immaturity, social incompetence, and borderline degrees of
mental handicap.
Of the people he looked at, many had unstable family backgrounds, and
he used an unusually vivid phrase which encompasses much of the
hopelessness and despair inherent in the situation, describing them --
even at the age of 16 -- as ''adrift in society''.
Dr Chiswick returned to his theme more recently in the McClintock
Lecture, organised by the prison reform body Sacro, in October last
year, when talking about mentally disordered offenders, who, he said,
were ''inevitably ensnared in the institutional anxiety about suicide''.
They were likely to find themselves in a regime little changed from that
described by him in 1985 at Glenochil.
He said, perhaps harshly, that there had been one innovation, a
bureaucratic exercise in form filling. The prisoner would not notice any
change.
''He remains clad in canvas gear, isolated in a strip cell in the
hall, not in the prison hospital, subject to 15-minute observations but
minimal enduring contact by staff. The regime is oppressive and
dehumanising to the prisoner and often demoralising to the staff
required to operate it. It seems to have little to do with caring for
people in distress and more to do with back covering . . .'', stated Dr
Chiswick.
Detecting those at risk was rarely an easy task even of an experienced
psychiatrist, he said, but urged that it was a task for a psychiatrist
and one familiar with the various options. That view is largely echoed
by Sacro's John McNeill who says his organisation is deeply concerned
about the prison suicide increase in the last year.
''It is not just a problem for the SPS. We have to step back a bit,''
said McNeill.
''It is to do with the very large numbers we are now imprisoning,
especially those held on remand or given very short sentences. There is
overwhelming evidence that remand is the time of greatest risk. Reduce
those numbers and you will filter out a large group of people who are
vulnerable and also make it possible for prison staff to concentrate on
those who remain,'' he added.
Sacro also identifies the increasing number slipping through the
''care in the community'' safety nets and finding their way into jail,
particularly those with alcohol or drugs withdrawal problems, as being a
high-risk group now making up a significant proportion of the vulnerable
population.
McNeill stressed: ''There is a strong case for getting people out of
observation cells and into ward conditions, a point made 10 years ago by
Dr Chiswick. The SPS must also devote more resources to the screening
mechanisms. People are obviously slipping through the present procedures
with fatal results.''
McNeill and others recognise that suicide among the young in society
in general is rising dramatically, and that this is reflected inside
prisons here, in England, and in other Western countries. As suicides
among the young are increasing, so they are decreasing in older age
groups.
Measured in deaths per 100,000 population, suicide in the 15 to 24 age
group in Scotland has leapt by 149% when 1971-3 figures are compared to
those for 1991-3. In the 25 to 34 age group the rise in the same period
is 145%. Inside prison, the numbers have risen by 117% in the first age
group and by 47% in the second in the same period.
Sacro said recently that it believed that female offenders are a
special population and therefore require a different approach from male
offenders. The situation is complicated by a greater incidence of
psychological disturbance.
A recent study by psychologist Professor David Cooke indicated that
two-thirds of female prisoners have more than one disorder and
consistently display greater levels of psychological disturbance than
male offenders.
All the available evidence points to female offenders being harder to
treat and having a greater risk of self-inflicted injury and recidivism.
In the latest Cornton Vale incident there are early indications from
inside the prison that, after the first suicide, the second girl's death
was not an intended suicide but rather an attempt to seek attention, a
theory that remains for the fatal accident inquiry to examine.

ALTHOUGH the demise of the on/off road vehicle, or 4x4, has been
widely and often touted by industry pundits, registrations keep on
rising.
This is a situation that should prevail for some time, despite the
inescapable fact that the 4x4 is environmentally unfriendly, not at all
fuel-efficient and -- in the wrong hands -- can be more difficult to
drive safely than an ''ordinary'' car.
That's the down side. Plus factors include the higher stance that
gives the 4x4 driver a better view of the road. The vehicle is also
exceptionally strong, having been built to shrug off treatment that it
only ever gets in the hands of farmers, estate workers, and others who
do have to answer the call of the wild on a regular basis.
In other words, look after your 4x4 and it will last for anything up
to twice as long as a saloon -- and with less maintenance along the way.
Status comes into it too, of course. City dwellers in particular like
to give the impression that their town flat is really only a temporary
base. Weekends are spent in grander surroundings.
But for the vast majority of owners and aspirants, four wheel drive
means security, safety and rugged dependability.
Hence the fact that an astonishing 71,000 of us took delivery of a new
on/off roadster last year, business fought over by no fewer than 20
manufacturers offering a bewildering array of derivatives.
Since our previous review the sector has become even more competitive
with the arrival of more contenders.
Emerging Pacific Rim manufacturers, drawn by the lure of low
volume/high margin business have pitched in with some interesting cars.
The Asia Rocsta may have a ride so bouncy that first-time drivers
automatically check for over-inflated tyres, but its traditional
Jeep-like appearance has an appeal for the younger driver. At under
#10,000 it is cheap and cheerful -- and ideal for High Street cruising.
As yet its off-road capability has not been fully tested by us, but the
high stance, tough chassis and torquey diesel engine are all clues to a
useful potential.
Bigger, better and much more modern in style is the curiously named
SsangYong Musso. Hailing from the same part of the world, the
SsangYong's body was styled in Britain and it uses well-proven
Mercedes-Benz diesel and petrol engines to provide the perfect balance
between motorway cruising and shouldering its way through overgrown
trails.
In this respect the SsangYong operates in Land Rover Discovery and
Range Rover territory, but its importers hope to take a slice of this
cake courtesy of high equipment levels and a lower price.
No such pretensions where the new Kia Sportage or Toyota RAV4 vehicles
are concerned. They have been developed purely as recreational cars, the
F-factor in this instance meaning fun. Big fun.
The RAV4 isn't a ''proper'' 4x4 as such, but the Sortage come with the
full works, including a low ratio option.
With newcomers arriving on a regular basis, the market is now
beginning to separate into easily defined categories, from basic to
sophisticated, workhorses and boulevard cruisers.
At the top of the heap, 25 years old and still without a serious
challenger, is the stately Range Rover. Given a facelift and a BMW
engine implant for some models last year, the Range Rover has shrugged
off serious challenges over the years. First came the Mercedes-Benz
G-Wagen. Some models were even more expensive that their British rival,
but dated looks and less than generous levels of interior equipment
restricted its appeal.
Mitsubishi has done rather better with the excellent Shogun.While
other Japanese manufacturers attempted to gain entry to the club
courtesy of a ''less car, less money'' approach, Mitsubishi went
straight for the top.
They made a tremendous job of it too, managing to capture almost all
of the Ranger Rover's mud-plugging ability and then creating an even
more luxurious driving environment, albeit within more modest
dimensions.
Quality counts for a great deal in this sector of the market, which is
why the Shogun, price for price, isn't outsold by anything other than
the Range Rover.
It also accounts for the huge success of the Jeep Cherokee. A
tremendous performer over rough country, the Cherokee is equally at home
on fast motorway runs or hacking through crowded city streets. Like the
Shogun its only real flaw is the restricted legroom offered to rear seat
passengers.
Straddling the middle ground are the contenders from Ford, Nissan and
Vauxhall. The Ford Maverick and Nissan Terrano are essentially the same
vehicles, built in the same factory. The confusing difference in prices
is explained by differing trim levels, engines and number of doors. In
other words compare specifications to make sure you get the one you want
-- and ignore the badge.
Vauxhall's Monterey and Frontera models existed in a previous life as
Isuzus, but now the Frontera -- despite its archaic fascia -- is selling
like hot cakes and is second only to the Discovery in overall units
shifted.
Early models had patchy build quality, a problem rapidly rectified,
and the Frontera now represents good value for extrovert drivers.
The Discovery itself has been prettied up for 1995. Most of the
changes are cosmetic, but a new vehicle, the XS has joined the company
catalogue. Based on the 5-door, 7-seat configuration, it boasts alloy
wheels, white lettered Goodyears and is again pitched squarely at
younger drivers with around #25,000 to spend.

THE answer has to be Falkirk, say two local estate agents when asked
about the ideal place to rent. ''It's an ideal place for a house. Good
facilities in itself. And convenient for both Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Couldn't be better,'' says Colin Payton of CMS.
He and Sandra Miller of Gair and Gibson, who both deal in properties
to let, are quite convinced no-one need look much further afield.
''We get a steady interest across a very broad range,'' says Colin.
''I think one of the important things is that prices here are very
attractive. Certainly compared to the big cities, you can get a bit
more, for a bit less.
''There's not really any unique type of person looking for a place in
this area. People going abroad, people relocating, people building their
own house and needing a place to stay meanwhile.''
Prices start at just under #200 a month for furnished properties,
rising to #600 or above, so it's clearly not aimed solely at one end of
the market.
''We just offer a straightforward deal,'' Colin adds. ''If we are fair
to people, and they are fair to us, we can all get on together.''
It's an admirable sentiment, echoed by Gair and Gibson.
''Actually, we probably have more inquiries than we have properties,''
Sandra Miller says cheerfully. ''There is a mixture of people here --
those looking for a first-time flat, moving into the area, that kind of
thing.
''Broadly, we are dealing with property in the #350-400 a month range.
It takes in places like Falkirk itself, Camelon, Polmont, Denny,
Stenhousemuir, Banknock. There is a good rail system, and that makes
commuting quite attractive.''
CMS has a detached cottage at Airth, a quiet rural area, but handy for
transport. It has a lounge, bedroom, bathroom, kitchen and utility area
on the ground floor, and upstairs is the master bedroom with en-suite
shower room, and a third bedroom. Gas central heating, large gardens
with brick-built barbecue area, timber garage for #445 a month.
For #600 there's a detached property in Falkirk. Large lounge and
dining area, kitchen, bathroom and shower, downstairs toilet and four
bedrooms. Gas central heating, garage and nice gardens.
A bungalow in Stenhousemuir costs #485, with lounge/dining area,
kitchen, three bedrooms with fitted wardrobes, gas central heating,
double glazing, off-street parking and gardens front and rear.
A second-floor flat with lounge, kitchen, two double bedrooms,
bathroom and gas central heating costs only #290.
Bo'ness has a second-floor flat, with lounge, kitchen, bedroom and
bathroom for just under #200. Handy for the Grangemouth area or for
commuting.
Gair and Gibson offer a two-bedroom flat in Polmont for #350 a month,
fully-furnished with lounge, kitchen, bathroom, gas central heating,
double glazing, off-street parking and pleasant gardens.
For the same price in Falkirk there is a two-bedroom traditional flat
with a garden but no garage.
A large stone-built semi, however, could go up to #600, with larger
lounge, sitting room, dining room, kitchen, toilet, four bedrooms,
bathroom, gas central heating, garden and parking space.

EAST Kilbride-based Robert Wiseman Dairies has won a contract to
supply 26 Tesco stores in England.
The company already supplies Tesco's Scottish stores with more than
600,000 litres of milk a week and the new contract will add a further
300,000 litres to that weekly total.
Wiseman will fulfil the new contract from its #10m depot in Manchester
which is due to begin operating in August.
Alan Wiseman, company chairman, said the Manchester processing
facility had been specifically developed to increase their penetration
of the UK market and to meet the demands of the multiple market.
''The UK market for liquid milk is highly competitive, but by ensuring
that quality is inherent in all aspects of our business we are well
placed to take advantage of further opportunities to increase our market
share,'' he added.

THE Inverurie-based ANM Group, which pioneered electronic livestock
auctions in the UK, is merging that side of its business with the
satellite sales operation of the Midland Marts Group of Banbury.
The two leading livestock auction companies will be partners in a new
#500,000 venture -- Agvision Ltd -- which will offer farmers a choice of
selling by satellite or computer.
Under the satellite system, operated by Midland Marts through its
subsidiary, Satellite Livestock Auction Marketing, animals are filmed
on-farm by an agent who also compiles a description. The various shots
are put together to form a programme which is transmitted by satellite
on Thursday mornings.
Potential bidders, with the appropriate addition to their TV reception
dish, can view the programme at home or in the office and make their
bids by telephone as each animal is featured on screen.
The company promises ''all the excitement of the auction with neither
the stock nor people having to move from farm or office.''
The electronic system, pioneered by ANM, is more akin to buying by
mail- order catalogue. A representative of the electronic auction
company will write a description of the animals including an estimate of
how he believes they will kill out in terms of confirmation, fat cover
and weight.
They are then sold on an ex-farm, deadweight basis with a grading
system which makes provision for premium payments or discounts as
appropriate.
The descriptions can be viewed on a personal computer and potential
purchasers make their bids via a modem telephone link. The system has
been used since 1989 for selling prime stock and is also extensively
used for quota trading and for marketing agricultural commodities.
The computer-based buying method has been attractive to
slaughterhouses and the ANM subsidiary, Electronic Auction Systems
Europe, claims to have 20 abattoirs throughout the country buying
regularly through their system.
In general the electronic method suits purchase for slaughter and
satellite is more attractive for store animals or breeding stock where
the potential buyer is interested in having sight of the animal.
The ANM system has a current throughput of about #20m a year and
Midland Marts satellite subsidiary has sale of between #25m and #30m.
Under the new arrangements Agvision services will be operated in
Scotland by ANM and in England and Wales by the Midland Marts. The new
company will appoint a number of agents to operate the service on a
franchise basis but the money will be handled and guaranteed by ANM and
Midland respectively.
Mr Brian Pack, ANM group chief executive, said the combination of
satellite and electronic systems represented an important step in the
overall development of alternative marketing methods. Already about 6%
of cattle and 15% of sheep were sold through electronic systems.
''Customers must have choice,'' he said. I do not have any feat for
the future of the live auction but I do see the potential for these new
systems to market a lot of stock. The whole live auction scene is
changing very fast.''

ASTRATHCLYDE estate agent is setting new standards of excellence in
the profession by becoming Scotland's first such company to earn their
spurs, and a kitemark, with international quality assurance accreditors.
Clyde Properties, which have two outlets in the Glasgow area, were
awarded the international trading standards qualification, the BS EN ISO
9000 which has replaced the old BS5750 kitemark, last week.
It gained the accreditation for its standards of company conduct and
procedure in servicing clients. The accreditation was completed in an
unusually short six-month period and involved a two-day audit of all
employees' working practices and standards.
Mr Bill Cullens, the managing director of Clyde Properties said:
''There is so much bad press for estate agents which might not have been
necessary if all companies had maintained high standards in the past.
This was a chance for us to prove that not all of us are sharks.
''It was a fantastic way of bonding our whole team of employees
together as each member of staff knew that if any one let us down it
would spoil the chances of the whole company.
Company accountant Mr Alan Burke said that it had cost Clyde Propeties
#6000 to register for accreditation and participate in the scheme but
that it represented a worthwhile investment. He added: ''Rather than us
saying how much quality of sevice we offer, we now have had it confirmed
by rigorous independent accreditors. We will now be able to display the
kitemark prominently in our shops and on our letter heads.''
Clyde Properties reported they had sold #14m of property to April/May
this year, which represented a 48% sales increase in one of their
outlets in Bearsden. The company now plans to expand by opening a
letting agency in Glasgow's lucrative west end in the autumn.
Estate agents have faced a spate of negative publicity in recent
months over the problem of negative equity.
A spokeman for the British Standards Institute, which accredited Clyde
Properties said that the quality assurance kitemark, once the preserve
of engineering and manufacturing workplaces, was now increasingly sought
by white-collar businesses and professionals such as doctors and
dentists. He added: ''It is highly encouraging that a whole range of
businesses are becoming aware of the need for quality assured
practises.''
Many estate agents are already members of the Ombudsman for Corporate
Estate Agents, instituted as a monitoring and arbitration body in 1990.

Sue Tranter reports on a family concern with decking the halls, walls,
and kitchen with flowers.
''JANET made it up one afternoon,'' says Martin Grant airily, as if
talking of a pleasantly fluffy Victoria sponge cake baked by his wife.
He is actually referring to an intricate, four-foot garland of dried
flowers and leaves hanging over the fireplace in their cottage.
Mrs Grant is a dab hand with the wire and oasis, it seems. All over
her pretty home are dazzling creations including some made of
freeze-dried vegetables like broccoli.
Thanks to her talents her business, which started in a rather humble
fashion in a spare room, has grown till it seems to be taking over the
Grants' delightful cottage at Drem near Dunbar.
The beams in the kitchen are hanging with dozens of bunches of dried
blooms, all neatly done up in brown paper cones. It isn't unusual to
find a customer sitting having a cup of coffee beneath this unusual
canopy.
The idea of using the house as a showroom and workshop where clients
could see displays in a proper setting came to the Grants when they
decided to move out of Edinburgh. They began hunting for a cottage but
finding one proved almost impossible.
''There was a huge demand for country homes within commuting distance
of the city,'' says Janet. ''We spotted this one advertised privately in
the paper, an even though the advert made it sound dreadful, we came to
see it one night.
''It was described as fully modernised and semi-detached, which wasn't
actually what we wanted but it was in our price range and in the right
area and, frankly, we were desperate.
''We didn't even know the house had a garden or a pantile roof when we
bought it; we only saw it briefly and at night, before making an instant
decision.''
In broad daylight, Janet and Martin were delighted to find that their
new home was tucked away down a lane on the edge of open countryside,
with fields adjoining their small back garden.
Built 100 years ago as a farm cottage, the field beyond is thick with
pea plants.
Janet and Martin made plans to remove some of the modernisation to the
house, which included masses of pine cladding at 45 degree angles.
Their aim was to keep everything simple and as much as possible in the
tradition of a small farm cottage. Having found their idyllic retreat,
both were loath to spend every day working in the city, so Janet, who
had trained in decorative arrangements, decided to convert one of the
rooms into a workroom. She soon found that passing customers couldn't
resist taking a peak at the displays in the rest of the house.
To accommodate their new enterprise it was decided to build on a
larger kitchen. Janet found a local architect and gave him some drawings
of how she wanted the extension to look.
''He followed her plans exactly and we were delighted with the
result,'' says Martin.
The old, very small kitchen was incorporated into the sitting room,
making a much more comfortable space. The floor was tiled in terracotta
and a double-glazed door gives plenty of light and a view over the
garden and the fields beyond. Pine furniture completed the country look,
while the fitted cupboards were painted pale green.
The old kitchen window in the sitting room has become an added
attraction, and the walls were colour-washed in soft yellow.
However, much as they love their cottage, the Grants have decided the
time has come to move to something a bit larger to accommodate their
growing business.
Moving out of the city has obviously been the best move the Grants
have ever made. Even though it was literally a leap in the dark for this
enterprising couple.

Martin Grant on 0131-554-2046.

THE London Stock Exchange has established in Glasgow a strong
Alternative Investment Market (AIM) presence, Scotland with its
primarily niche players has much to offer.
Scottish Financial Enterprise represents and promotes a sector which
includes a strong complement of brokers and dealers who together handle
about half the settlement of the UK retail market and around one-fifth
of overall settlement business.
Meanwhile, Scottish finance consists of the triple central pillars of
banks, composite and life assurance companies and independent fund
managers.
All three require a fully supporting infrastructure and SFE's
membership includes numerous companies providing services covering
corporate law, accountancy, global custody, performance measurement and
financial information.
In short, Scotland has a genuine financial community, fully rounded,
comprehensive and mutually supportive. It is a sector of long standing
with a high reputation for quality, prudence and honesty and one very
much with international horizon.
The venture capital industry works confidently with the knowledge that
Scotland's financial services sector plays a key role in the nation's
economy, providing jobs for well over 200,000 people, around 1-in-9 of
the working population, and around 15% of the country's GDP.
Now the community's key involvement with the Scottish Enterprise
Business Birthrate initiative is bringing to bear a joint influence, to
make things happen on the economic front.
Reading the runes they indicate that finance as a sector in Scotland
will continue to grow rapidly, just as it has done over the past decade.
Grant Baird, SFE chief executive, said: ''The performance of the
sector cannot to a degree be divorced from the well-being of the
economy. Many of our members, those in London, earn their living by
selling their services abroad.
''At the same time and in particular with banks and venture
capitalists, as opposed to insurers and funds managers, you have to look
to your domestic base.
''If Scotland does not prosper as a whole, it is rather difficult for
the banks to prosper. This has led to a lot of new and innovative
products from the banks and venture capitalists, in particular for
financing new and small businesses.''
This represents the centrepoint of SFE's partnership work with
Scottish Enterprise, with the past year seeing the launch of a New
Venture finance scheme, rate capping, and AIM which has just come on
stream for smaller companies with the Stock Exchange.
Many, including Grant Baird, have described the sector as Scotland's
''jewel in the crown'', while Sir Iain Noble, chairman of Noble &amp;
Company and Noble Securities, prefers to describe the country as the
''Boston of Europe'' in terms of financial excellence.
SFE member and Bank of England Scottish agent, David Shilson summed
up: ''There are a significant number of niche players in Scotland's
financial sector, with centres of excellence benefiting the country's
economy as a whole.''
Scotland's economy is in good hands as SFE members continue to exploit
niche markets and capitalise on a wealth of expertise and experience.

THERE was an unintentional irony in the title of last night's Royal
SNO Prom; an evening at the movies is exactly what it was not. It would
have been interesting to note any difference if the film scores of
Glaswegian-born composer Patrick Doyle could have been presented with
some visual image to recreate their original context -- whether clips or
stills from the movies concerned.
As it was, the music -- presented bald by the orchestra with conductor
Robert Ziegler -- raised again the perennial issue of incidental music.
For centuries composers have produced incidental music to plays and, in
this century, to films. It's always been a fascinating (if minor)
tributary of their output. Even the greats have produced music that,
somehow, fails to survive as a musical entity. (Yes I know there are
honourable exceptions.)
The same applies to film music. How many movies have you seen where
you know the score has supplied a quintessential element to the
effectiveness, colour, pace, and atmosphere of the film? And how many of
those scores, when you've gone out to buy the tape or disc of the
soundtrack, seem strangely dislocated, detached, and even anonymous as
musical works?
It's actually a big debate; and as an issue it haunted last night's
Prom. Despite the personable, anecdotal, and descriptive introductions
by Doyle himself, his evocative scores from films such as Much Ado About
Nothing, Indochine, and Henry V, failed to take wing. The exceptions
were Carlito's Way, with its haunting string intro (a bit like Barber's
Adagio) and bustling action sequence, and the ominously pounding
sections of Frankenstein. Otherwise, a good idea that didn't ignite.

Venture capital is a vital component in the Scottish financial
marketplace. And the market is responding to new moves with the advent
of the Venture Capital Trust being introduced, within the backdrop of a
New Ventures major initiative tied up in the recent Business Birthrate
action plan for Scotland. But what does all this mean for tomorrow's
budding entrepreneur or an already established business now wanting to
grow? In this report Bill Magee reviews the Scottish venture capital
market.
VENTURE capital trusts (VCTs) are set to dominate the market once
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke's Finance Act is made law.
Equivalent to a quoted investment trust and loaded with tax
incentives, this new global finance-raising vehicle will be invaluable
to smaller companies as the equity gap is finally plugged.
Businesses with expansion on their minds have often encountered
financing problems and VCTs are designed to fill the space between the
#100,000 bank loan and venture capital #1m limits. Yet, a trust will
provide opportunities for venture capitalists to gain profitable
success.
A #100,000 VCT investment can cost around #40,000 after using all
equitable tax reliefs. Higher-rated taxpayers pay only the tax on any
capital gains made before investing in the trust upon disposal.
Even that can be deferred indefinitely if it is rolled over into
another unquoted company through the recently launched Alternative
Investment Market (AIM).
Individual subscribers, but not companies, now invest up to #100,000
annually to receive 20% income tax relief, up to 40% capital gains tax
relief, tax-free income and tax-free capital gains thereafter.
In exchange for all of this, a VCT must invest within three years, 70%
of its assets in shares of qualifying holdings. This represents a target
of 35 investments over this first three years and an average investment
of #600,000.
There are, of course, eligibility requirements and restrictions
imposed upon both investor and fund manager. Another important aspect is
that smaller companies represent a high risk/high reward sector, with
price volatility and illiquidity greater.
Already a number of fund management groups have indicated their
intentions to set up VCTs. These include Murray Johnstone, Rothschild
Asset Management and Northern Venture Managers.
Graham Miller, director of Murray Johnstone Private Equity, said that
there will be an increasing concentration of venture capital. His firm
plans a September launch of a #20m-#30m VCT, with a large chunk to be
invested in a host of smaller early-stage companies.
He added: ''Venture capital is set to become more of a niche industry.
There are too many houses at present who are playing at it, and there
has to be a network to offer a proper service.''
''It was a good time to raise money but there is a danger,'' he
warned, ''in particular in the MBO market of silly prices being paid for
companies.''
The VCTs market is set to become a frantic market once the Finance
Bill is passed with the danger that demand may outstrip supply.

Can John Redwood be taken seriously as a contender for the top job?
Let us start by observing that he's not the perfect candidate. He is an
idealogue. He turns gangling and awkward when he tries to be nice. He is
easy to caricature. Till two days ago nobody had heard of him except the
Welsh, and they do not seem best pleased at the privilege. This is not
much of a launching pad.
For a Fellow of All Souls who has reached the Cabinet in his early
forties, Redwood has in fact travelled rather light. Compare Michael
Portillo, of almost the same vintage, and only slightly less
intellectual distinction. His oratory, his bonhomie and his hidalgo's
quiff has made him almost a popular figure. We know, or think we know, a
good deal about his strengths and his weaknesses, his aims and his
methods.
The comparison is instructive. It reveals how sensible Redwood has
been to travel so light, to keep his powder dry, and to maintain his
room for manoeuvre. Now he has seen an opening and, unencumbered, has
been able to push at the door, and find it swinging back before him.
Boldness is then necessary: he shows it and steps in. As he does, who
can doubt that he also has in him that ultimate political attribute, the
killer instinct? In other words, he has at a crucial moment demonstrated
courage, resourcefulness, and ruthlessness. Even after we subtract from
them his less than perfect stock in trade, these are not trivial
qualifications for the Prime Minister's job.
And that is, of course, the comparison we must make -- not with
Portillo or with any other undeclared competitor, but with John Major,
the man whom Redwood now directly challenges. Perhaps, in fact, the best
comparison is with Major at a similar stage in his own career, the Major
of five years ago, the unknown quantity elected to save the Conservative
Party from itself.
We should recall, too, that he was elected as the candidate of the
right, with the full backing of Mrs Margaret Thatcher and every
expectation that he would carry forward her radical agenda, if more
gently and slowly. It does not seem to me that the Conservative Party in
Parliament or in the country has become markedly less right wing since.
I cannot therefore see why it should not be led from the right again.
The essence of British Toryism is not any grand theory but the
overwhelming desire to win, to stay in power, and to continue guiding
the country's destinies as it has done for most of the modern age.
In all that, effective leadership is much more important than any
particular ideology. By the same token, lack of effective leadership is
the ultimate sin. It is a sin steadily sapping, as sin does, the
vitality of John Major. In my view, he proved that he was now beyond
redemption in the rose garden of No 10 Downing Street last Thursday.
Ideology ought not in principle be a bar to any man who thinks he can do
better.
In any event, there are times when ideology can read the real world
better than pure pragmatism, which easily gets lost amid immediate
impressions and pressures, to end up going nowhere at all. That, I
should have thought, is the lesson that emerges if we contrast
Thatcher's leadership of the Conservative Party with that of the two men
who preceded and followed her.
Major has moved with exemplary pragmatism in two fields. One is what
might be called non-fiscal domestic policy, or everything that the
spending departments do. Here we see a mess, a catalogue of hesitations,
evasions, reversals, and failures, with nothing for anyone to believe
in. This, apparently, was the problem that Redwood tried to address in
the memorandum presented last Wednesday to the Prime Minister, which he
so fatefully spurned.
The second object of his pragmatism has been Europe. There, without
doubt, he has done a lot of good work, steering a tricky course between
the national interest and the placation of our partners. He has been
politic, in the strict sense of the word. But in his absorption with the
task in hand he has lost touch with the popular mood, not to mention the
mood of his own back benchers. Redwood believes he can give the people
what they want without breaking Britain's existing obligations, and he
may well be right.
To become somewhat more ideological in these two crucial areas would
hardly be a rejection of pragmatism -- indeed Major has been
contemplating as much himself. But anyway, the pragmatism of the present
public mood may have been exaggerated. The country may have needed a
rest after Thatcher vanished from the scene. But going back on her
principles has not been of conspicuous benefit either to Britain or the
Tory party.
It would be a mistake to regard what she achieved as a
once-and-for-all revolution, which took us so far and then stopped. It
would be a mistake because the other parties have recognised that
revolution, which now indeed is world-wide rather than merely British.
They have moved on to the same ground. In all social and economic
essentials the Government and the Opposition have the same policies. It
is leadership that makes the difference.
On the other hand, what is happening in America demonstrates that
while pauses for breath may be necessary, it is possible to renew
popular, pariotic, right-wing policies and make progress with them. But
that needs ideas and leadership.
In Britain the Government has run out of ideas. Its lack of
leadership, something of a problem since 1990, has been for some time
set on a course of disastrous miscalculation. The events of last
Thursday crowned it. I believe John Redwood can supply what John Major
lacks, and that he should be given his chance.

Ross Finlay find the Fiesta simmering away nicely
IN the heyday of the hot hatches, one of the most desirable -- at
least, to the sticky-fingered characters whose constant thefts of these
vehicles were the main reason why the insurance premiums soared to
unacceptable levels -- was the Fiesta XR2i. Since abandoning that model,
Ford has split its efforts in providing tuned-up Fiestas between the
rarely seen but extremely potent 130bhp RS1800, and the 1.6-litre Si
which is one of the current ''warm hatch'' brigade.
Some of the magazines make unparliamentary remarks about the Si, on
the grounds that it is neither fish, flesh nor fowl, and is not as
fire-breathing as they would like it to be. Of course, such comments
ignore the fact that the next car up the Fiesta price scale is that
RS1800 which will give you every bit as much power as a car of this size
can easily handle.
My first proper drive in an Si was a pretty daft one for the kind of
car it is -- a long motorway hack from Scotland to Paris and home again.
More recently I was driving one on local roads, at a time when the car
was also here for a colleague to twizzle around the pylons, stop lines,
handbrake turns and front-end throws of an autotest competition.
The 1.6-litre Si comes as a three-door at #10,010 or a five-door at
#10,430, the two versions being identical mechanically. While the 1.4
peaks at 75bhp, the 1.6 has 90bhp to play with, and its 16-valve engine
has noticeably more poke than the smaller-engined car's eight-valve. You
can expect a 0-60mph sprint time of about 10.5 seconds, reasonable
mid-range torque and a test track maximum around 110mph.
In its latest styling update, the Si is quite different looking, with
revised front and rear appearance, from the first versions of 1994.
There is no doubt that the front end, as is the case with so many Fords
these days, takes some getting used to.
The problem here is that the designers keep having to put new
extremities on to the same familiar mid-section, and these exercises do
not always work too well. The new sweeping rear, however, is quite
impressive.
Roomy enough in front, the Si does not offer much passenger space in
the back seats. Apart from the fact that newer designs beat it in
packaging, it is fitted with bulky front seats which take away from rear
legroom. For their own occupants, though, they are comfortable, offering
plenty of support in all the right places, with twin ''wings'' on each
side to hold you in during brisk cornering.
Ford gets some things in the front cabin just right, others dead
wrong. The Fiesta has one of the most practical fascias in the small-car
business, and that remains the case even though there is now space for a
passenger's-side airbag. It is grafted in very neatly, to the extent
that there is still room for both a fascia-top tray and a locker
underneath.
On the other hand, this is another of those annoying cars in which
provision of a driver's airbag means that there is no provision for
steering wheel height adjustment. The Si wheel is too high for my taste
and comfort.
Out on winding roads the latest Si was a lot more fun than the
previous one had been on the long motorway drag to France. Ford retained
the XR2i suspension for the 1.6-litre Si, and tinkered with it further
in terms of anti-roll bar provision. But the most enjoyable thing about
the latest car is the direct and responsive steering, with standards of
turn-in which must be the best in the whole Fiesta range. Cornering is a
matter of weighing up the bend, turning into it aiding an instant
response. There is no lost time or motion, and that agility is not
scored highly enough by the Si's critics.

RESTRICTIONS on the import of premium chilled lamb from New Zealand
have been lifted following an agreement between the EU and NZ government
representatives.
But this will not mean a flood of imports of this product from July 1,
competing home-grown fresh lamb, said Neil Taylor, European director of
the NZ Meat Producers' Board yesterday. ''Chilled lamb is a high cost,
high risk product and we anticipate only a relatively gradual growth in
the volume sold here in Europe and that will be in response to market
demand.
Under the old GATT agreement, NZ was allowed to export 245,000 tonnes
of lamb a year to Europe at 10% levy. This included 15,000 tonnes of
chilled product. However it had imposed a voluntary restraint agreement
limiting exports to 205,600 tonnes.
Under the new GATT/World Trade Organisation agreement the European
import quota has been set at 225,000 tonnes at zero levy with no limit
on chilled supplies.

THE National Farmers' Union of Scotland has sought to de-fuse the
controversy over Scottish Pride share dealings by organising a meeting
to which they have invited representatives of Scottish Pride, and the
dissident shareholders' group.
The meeting will be held on Friday of this week at NFU headquarters at
Ingliston.
The emergence of a shareholders' association which has submitted
critical resolutions for consideration at the Scottish Pride annual
general meeting next month has been an irritation to the company's
management and also caused concern to the NFUS.
Lord Sanderson of Bowden, company chairman, explained last week that a
human error by a member of staff in the company's stockbrokers had led
to a potential buyer being told on one occasion that shares in Scottish
pride were not available when in fact they were. The company has issued
a detailed explanation of how shares are bought and sold through their
stockbroker on a matched bargain basis.
At a meeting on June 7, the NFUS milk committee agreed unanimously
that it would not be appropriate to support any action which might
destablise Scottish Pride -- formerly the manufacturing wing of the old
Milk Marketing Board -- ''during this critical phase of its
development.''
Tom Reid, the vice-convener of the milk committee, had been involved
in the formation of the shareholders' association, which later published
five resolutions for consideration at the Scottish Pride agm. These
raised questions over share purchases by directors and the future of
some Scottish Pride creameries.
Mr Reid stepped down as interim-chairman of the association in view of
the possible conflict between his two leadership roles.
The NFUS, in a statment issued last night said: ''It is preposterous
to suggest that Mr Reid has in some way been demoted. He is a well
respected and prominent member of the NFU. The decision was entirely his
own.
Tom Brady, chief executive of the NFUS, said it was normal practice
for people holding leadership positions in the union to avoid taking on
any other role which could cause a conflict of interests. That had been
explained to Mr Reid.

A RAPIDLY-expanding Dundee-based seafood exporter, with its eye on
Japanese sushi bars, is receiving #350,000 of growth finance from
investment capital group 3i.
Formed only three years ago by joint managing directors John Brennan
and Tony Horner, Taymar International Foods expects to turn over about
#5.5m in the 12 months to end-March next year.
The equity funds from 3i will finance Taymar's drive into sushi bars,
where langoustine tails are much in demand, and allow the company to
further push its SCOMAC brand in Italy.
Taymar, which successfully promoted its products at recent seafood
exhibitions in Brussels and Tokyo, also plans to upgrade its processing
factory at Eyemouth, near Berwick.
The company, which made pre-tax profits of #74,000 on sales of #3.8m
in the 15 months to end-March, exports about 85% of turnover.
Operating profits of #135,000 were reduced by charges for the
factoring of debts. The 3i injection provides cheaper, longer-term
financing.
Taymar buys and sells a variety of fish and shellfish, principally
langoustine and crab, and plans to develop specialist products such as
cooked crab livers and cooked velvet crab.
In the UK, Taymar, which may increase its 44-strong workforce,
supplies soup, pate, baby food, and frozen recipe dish manufacturers.
The company also does business in Spain and France.
Hazel Leishman, at the Edinburgh office of 3i, said: ''Taymar is a
dynamic young business which has grown impressively in the last three
years and forged a strong presence in an attractive niche market.''

TESCO, Britain's second largest food retailer, is seeking new store
sites in Britain and Europe, but it refuses to say whether it is
planning a move into the Northern Ireland market. However, it is thought
to be in negotiations with Associated British Foods to buy its 21
Stewarts supermarkets and four superstores.
Rival J Sainsbury has already disclosed plans to move into northern
Ireland with a #100m investment programme. It plans to open seven
stores, creating 2000 jobs.

BANK of Scotland is backing an Alternative Investment Market debutant
set up by former employees of its cash-flow finance subsidiary, Kellock,
even though the new company will offer a similar service.
The bank leads a syndicate which has provided Euro Sales Finance (ESF)
with #20m of senior debt.
ESF's chief executive is Ian Fitz-Harris, who gave up his directorship
of Kellock to set up on his own. He also took James Bland and Raymond
Wise, executive directors of the new company, from Kellock.
Like the Bank of Scotland subsidiary, ESF will provide working capital
for growing businesses through invoice discounting, which involves
''buying'' clients' trade debtors and providing cash up front, and
factoring, where it actually runs the sales ledger.
However, Mr Fitz-Harris said ESF would be targeting a niche market,
providing working capital to rising stars which were making inroads into
Europe and needed support.
He argued, therefore, that his new company would not be in direct
competition with Kellock because the Bank of Scotland subsidiary's
business was more broadly based.
Mr Fitz-Harris said: ''We are taking a slightly different angle with
our European dimension. I have a good relationship with the bank and
they are happy to support us.''
ESF raised #5m with a placing of 4.5 million shares, at 111.5p,
through the Scottish office of broker Williams de Broe.
Launched on AIM yesterday, the shares had risen to 120p by
mid-morning, taking the company's market capitalisation to #5.4m.
Edinburgh-based fund management group Ivory &amp; Sime, through its
Enterprise investment trust, has taken a 20% equity stake in ESF.
''Illustrative financial projections'' contained in ESF's placing
document are for pre-tax profits of #2.1m in the year to end-June 1998,
although such forecasts are more likely to be on the bullish side.
The company anticipates a loss of #451,000 in its first financial
year.
Although ESF will operate out of London and Manchester, it will cover
the whole of the UK.
Mr Fitz-Harris has experience of the Scottish market, having helped
set up Kellock's Glasgow office about five years ago.
Former Ivory &amp; Sime chairman Alex Hammond-Chambers is a non-executive
director of ESF.
* THE first investment trust to specialise in the Alternative
Investment Market is already on the drawing board, even though there are
as yet under a dozen shares to choose from, writes CHRISTOPHER SIMS.
Smaller company specialist Baronsmead is aiming to launch a #25m fund
within a few months and has stolen a march on possible rivals by
registering the name as the AIM Trust. It will be listed on the main
stock market, not AIM itself.
The number of shares listed on the market is expected to grow rapidly,
with Baronsmead projecting 300, with a capitalisation of #3500m, on the
market within two years.
''The market will largely be made up of small fast-growing companies
and as the first investment trust specialising solely in the new market
we feel there is tremendous scope for outperforming the other collective
investment schemes in the UK,'' said Richard Hargreaves, managing
director of Baronsmead.
Sponsor to the issue will be Adam &amp; Partners (London) and syndicate
brokers will include Allied Provincial (Glasgow) who will have the
prospectus for the trust in due course.

MURRAY Smaller Markets Trust suffered at the hands of the Mexican
crisis last year, but is confident of a rebound as US investors rebuild
their portfolios in overseas markets.
Net asset value fell 7% to 445.2p per share in the year to May 31
after soaring 40.1% in the previous 12-month period.
The trust, managed by Murray Johnstone in Glasgow, said the upset was
a consequence of Mexico's sharp devaluation in December. This sent share
prices tumbling throughout Latin America and much of Asia.
But fund manager Roger Scullion said Latin America was already
recovering from the crisis and Asia remained ''the growth powerhouse of
the world.''
Mr Scullion said the Mexican crisis had not revealed any fault lines
in emerging markets as a whole and confidence was returning.
''Investor sentiment has stabilised. You have definitely seen a flow
of money back to the Pacific region and to some extent into Latin
America,'' he said.
''Since the end of May quite a few of these markets have gone up
whereas the UK, the US and Japan have gone down,'' Mr Scullion said,
noting a 6% improvement in Mexico alone.
He said it was difficult to compare the Murray Smaller Markets Trust
directly with any benchmark index, because all the main international
indices include weightings for Japan and the United States, where the
trust has no investments.
The FT Actuaries World Index rose 4.3% in the year to May, but that
index has a 38% weighting for US stocks which rose 15% during the
period.
Murray Smaller Markets Trust has a tradition of high returns.
According to the Association of Investment Trust Companies, #1000
invested 10 years ago would show a total return on the share price of
#6065 today -- more than that of any other internationally diversified
trust.
But the trust slips into fifth place on a five-year comparison and to
third place when measured over the last three years.
Mr Scullion said the trust's performance was always subject to
fluctuation because it deliberately invested in smaller more volatile
markets. Investors should therefore take a long-term view.
Murray Smaller Markets Trust declared a final dividend of 3.04p,
making 4.60p for the year, a 5.3% increase over 1994.
This was covered by earnings of 5.75p per ordinary share.
The trust has sold several of its more vulnerable stocks in Mexico,
but plans to maintain its exposure in the country at current levels.
Mr Scullion noted bright prospects in Argentina and Chile and said
Mexico would be poised for full recovery next year.
Nearly 12% of the trust's #249.8m portfolio is invested in Latin
America.
But the lion's share -- 46% -- is invested in Asia and Australasia,
where there was ''technical change of portfolios'' last year.
Some funds were switched from established markets seen as vulnerable
to a slowing of the US economy, such as Hong Kong and Singapore, into
others with better growth prospects, such as South Korea and the
Philippines.
The trust has placed 30% of its investments in Europe, where it did
particularly well in Scandinavia last year.

THE pound fell further yesterday as fears grew in the City that the
battle for the leadership of the Conservative Party would result in a
significant easing of fiscal policy.
Rumours circulated in financial markets that Michael Portillo, the
Employment Secretary, had resigned from the Cabinet, but these were
denied by No 10 Downing Street and Mr Portillo's own office.
After lunch the pound's traded weighted index fell to 82.7, equalling
its all-time low recorded on May 9 in the aftermath of the refusal by
Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to raise interest
rates.
Later sterling recovered some lost ground, but its effective rate was
0.4 points lower on the day at 82.9. Since Thursday night when the Prime
Minister put his job up for grabs the pound's international value has
fallen by 1.4%. So far this year it has dropped 6.2%.
At one point sterling fell below key support levels of DM2.19 and
$1.58, but it remained above its all-tme low of DM2.1755, also recorded
on May 9.
By the close of business the pound was 0.07 cents down at $1.5850 and
1.41 pfennigs down at DM2.1925.
Later today financial markets may have to cope with an upward revision
to the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement in the current fiscal year.
In the Budget the Treasury forecast a PSBR of #21.5bn, but the City
believes this will be revised to around #25bn in the summer economic
forecast.
The Treasury is also thought likely to tone down its 1995 growth
forecast from 3.25% to around 3%, but to increase its fourth quarter
inflation forecast from 2.5% to 2.75%.
James Capel's Adam Cole warned that John Redwood's leadership
manifesto added to the risks of ''a cut and run easing of fiscal policy.
''While he cited the need to finance any immediate tax reductions
through savings in public spending, the route he proposes -- lower
staffing costs and administrative savings -- leaves little room for
manoeuvre,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>Building Societies' Ombudsman receives complaint a day. Too many horror stories continue</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>CHRISTOPHER SIMS</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>19</PAGE>
<FLAG>COMMENT</FLAG>
<RECORDNO>977666208</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
ONE good thing to come out of the latest report from the Building
Societies' Ombudsman is that societies are getting better at resolving
disputes with customers internally.
Before resorting to the ombudsman, complainants have first to go
through the society's own complaints procedure and two-thirds of
problems are dealt with to the satisfaction of the complainant. This
compares with just 27% in the previous year.
So, as the ombudsman Brian Murphy points out, many societies have
streamlined their procedures, which is a welcome development.
Yet too many horror stores continue to come into the ombudsman's
office. In particular, Mr Murphy is receiving an average of a complaint
a day over endowment policies, or rather the lack of such policies.
Typically, the borrower thinks he or she is paying an endowment policy
premium with his monthly payment on his mortgage. Then he discovers to
his horror -- some times only shortly before the maturity of the loan --
that the endowment policy, which was supposed to have been arranged by
the society when the mortgage was set up was never actually put in
place. Instead of looking forward to the day when the loan would be paid
off he finds it exactly the same as when he started.
Similarly it can happen that someone who thinks he is on a repayment
mortgage suddenly discovers he has in fact an interest-only mortgage
which remains constant in size.
As one would hope Mr Murphy takes a dim view of societies who make
such errors. The society may argue it should be obvious that the
appropriate payment was not being made and the borrower should have
spotted it at the outset. As Mr Murphy points out, societies have
substantial resources and are experts in the field, whereas their
borrowers are not. So the onus is on the society.
Another example of poor communication between society and borrower
comes in mortgage indemnity guarantee policies (MIGs in the trade), in
which insurance companies have lost so much money in recent years. These
policies are anomalous in that they are a contract between the insurance
company and society but the premium is paid by the borrower. The insurer
agrees to make up the difference if on repossession there is a gap
between the loan value and the amount the property can realise on sale.
There is surprise and anger on the part of the borrower when the MIG
is triggered and the insurer tries to recoup the sum he lost from the
borrower. Not unreasonably the latter assumed that having paid the
premium the policy covered him as well.
The answer is for the society to spell out the situation at the
outset, instead of merely telling the borrower to sign on the dotted
line.
The ombudsman says he is becoming increasingly concerned that most if
not all societies, far from trying to come clean over these policies are
actually refusing to provide copies for borrowers. The societies claim
that disclosure in itself could be taken as admission of entitlement by
the borrower and that the information contained in the policy documents
is commercially sensitive.
Problems with mortgage payment protection policies are also worrying
at a time when they are becoming much more common. These policies are
tightly worded and it is essential that the policyholder is aware of all
the conditions. Yet some societies are not doing this.
Initial complaints coming into the ombudsman on all matters rose 15%
to 10,431, but 90% of these did not go beyond the initial stage.
Investigating complaints is a time-consuming process, though the average
time taken to resolve them has been reduced from 12 months to just over
four. Last year the ombudsman came down in favour of complainants in 57%
of cases.
The number of complaints has to be seen against a background of
literally millions of transactions carried out by societies for
customers. But this does not excuse some of the disgraceful things that
can occur.
There was a case involving repossession where the borrower had found a
buyer for his house in a difficult market. The society refused to accept
this and insisted on going through with repossession. The buyer was lost
and the house sold at a lower price.
The end result was an arrear of #40,000 rather than the #3500 it could
have been. Such intransigence is plain stupid and Mr Murphy ensured the
borrower was not out of pocket.
Errors and idiocies may be few and far between but they will probably
always occur and the ombudsman performs a vital role in correcting them
and also showing societies where they are going wrong. They should pay
due attention to Mr Murphy's report.

THE City took one look at the results from John Redwood's old company
Norcros and shuddered.
Then it began to read the small print and cheered up a little as the
building materials to printing group said the value of the print and
packaging activities is not fully reflected in the overall stock market
rating.
Mr Redwood was a director between 1985 and 1989, the last two years as
non-executive chairman.
Norcros is determined to separate the division from the rest of
Norcros and, encouragingly, within the current financial year which runs
to next March.
The shares shed 2p to 80p for a market capitalisation of #143m.
There is no final dividiend but the market had been forewarned that
the final was in danger. That is after a swing from a pre-tax profit of
#17.1m into a #51m loss after charging a total of #30m for
reorganisation and #22.9m of asset write-downs.
In the last financial year, printing and packaging in brought in
pre-interest profits of #10.6m after about #2.1m of exceptional costs on
turnover of #116m. The underlying profits increase was 18%.

DEPOSITORS will be better protected in the event of a bank failure
from July 1 under new European-wide rules. At present, a depositor with
an authorised bank in the UK is paid 75% of amounts up to a maximum
deposit of #20,000 if a bank goes into liquidation or receivership.
Thus, the maximum payout under the Deposit Protection Scheme, which
was launched in 1979 to cover small depositors, is #15,000.
If a bank fails from July 1, however, the payout will rise to 90%,
taking the maximum to #18,000 and bringing it into line with a similar
scheme for building society depositors.
Only deposits with authorised banks are covered and the advice from
the Bank of England is to check with a bank before opening an account
that it is part of the protection scheme.
Banks must include a paragraph about deposit protection in explanatory
literature sent to depositors and potential customers and must provide a
summary of the scheme on request.

IT worries me the way words have been ruthlessly devalued by the
twitterings of political commentators. For example, Tory Chairman Jeremy
Hanley states that Major's act of resigning was ''one of the most
courageous acts I have ever seen''.
What an abuse of the word ''courage''. The incompetent ass had no
option to save his worthless political skin.
Courage is when ordinary people spend decades in poverty bringing up
families decently; old age pensioners struggle to keep going on a
pittance of State old age pensions; people fight for years (not just
weeks) in wars caused by the incompetence of politicians; etc.
Also, you'd think Douglas Hurd had deigned to come down from Heaven to
deal with international affairs to judge by the over-the-top praise of
this old Etonian dissembler who, more than anyone, is responsible for
the slaughter of the Bosnian Muslims by his refusal to allow themselves
arms to defend themselves.

ROBERT Wiseman Dairies has raised #14m from a placing and open offer
share issue aimed at financing new acquisitions. The Wiseman family,
which owned 74% of the East Kilbride company before the June 2 offer,
abstained from its entitlement to buy seven new shares at 130p for every
40 held.
The shares were sold to institutional investors instead. As a result,
the family's stake in the company has declined to 62% and the
shareholder base has been widened.
Nearly half the net proceeds from the share issue will be used to
finance Robert Wiseman's #6.2m purchase of Scottish liquid milk business
from the Co-operative Wholesale Society.
The rest will be held in reserve for further acquisitions, but Robert
Wiseman finance director Billy Keane said no announcements were
imminent.
Just over 8.2 million of the 11.2 million new shares were sold to
institutional investors, including some who had not previously held
shares in Robert Wiseman. The rest were taken up by existing
shareholders.
The share issue raised the company's market capitalisation to #110m
from #65m when it was floated at 100p per share in March last year.
Robert Wiseman shares closed unchanged at 150p.

KEN HITCHCOCK, a plain-speaking Australian, is set to provoke a
revolution in the conservative and gentrified Scotch whisky industry
when he settles in as the new boss of Whyte &amp; Mackay.
''The industry has failed to address the younger generation,'' he told
the Herald bluntly after meeting company executives in Glasgow on day
one of his new job as the head of Scotland's third-largest distiller.
''The rebellious younger generation do not want to do what their mums
and dads are doing,'' said Mr Hitchcock, who spent five years making Jim
Beam bourbon and coke a top-selling drink in Australia.
''They have the same aspirations around the world. They are into
things like Levi jeans and Coca-Cola whether they are in Shanghai,
Barcelona or Sydney,'' he said.
''You have got to give a unique story about Scotch whisky that is
unique to the younger generation and forget about the heather and haggis
image,'' said the man brought in to revive Whyte &amp; Mackay's flagging
fortunes.
And although Mr Hitchcock personally drinks whisky with a dash of
water, he doesn't care if the rest of the world sloshes coke into it,
like 90% of Australians.
''We are not selling the whisky. We are selling the image,'' he
stressed.
Prompted by an aide, Mr Hitchcock hastened to add that Whyte &amp; Mackay
would not be forgetting traditional consumers in its global campaign to
boost sales.
The new chairman and chief executive of Whyte &amp; Mackay said it would
take him a couple of months to devise a new strategy for boosting the
company's meagre profits.
American Brands, Whyte &amp; Mackay's US owner, has poured #600m of
investment into the Scotch whisky industry over the last five years, but
have seen scant returns.
Mr Hitchcock made clear that his brief was to squeeze more profit out
of the company. ''The shareholders are looking for substantial
returns,'' he said.
But the 53-year-old executive appeared to reject the high-volume
low-margin approach, which many in the industry feared he might bring.
Mr Hitchcock said that while distillers had to produce good value at
constant price it was essential to avoid discounting.
Invergordon Distillers, which Whyte &amp; Mackay bought for #350m in 1993,
produces a quarter of all whisky sold by supermarkets under their own
brand name. It could be tempting for the company to pour even more cheap
whisky into an already flooded market.
American Brands brought in Mr Hitchcock this week to kick new life
into Whyte &amp; Mackay, booting out Michael Lunn, its former chairman and
chief executive, who had been with the firm for 18 years.
Mr Hitchcock is no stranger to Scotland or to Whyte &amp; Mackay.
He has visited the country several times and his grandmother came from
Greenock. He also sold Whyte &amp; Mackay whisky alongside Jim Beam bourbon,
while he was head of American Brands Australian subsidiary, Fortune
Brands.
Born and bred in Sydney, he trained as a teacher and worked at schools
in Papua New Guinea for seven years before joining the Royal Australian
Air Force as a special duties officer.
This involved him in administration, intelligence and legal work.
Resigning his commission in 1977, Mr Hitchcock became a personnel
manager for accountants Ernst &amp; Young in Sydney, but was headhunted to
become chief executive of Carlton and United Breweries two years later.
He switched to Fortune Brands in 1988 and was appointed managing
director of the firm in 1991.
Mr Hitchcock is married with a 2[1/2]-year-old son and plans to bring
his family over to Scotland during the summer.
He will not be joining the golfing fraternity since an air crash in
Papua New Guinea many years ago has left him with back trouble, but he
is an avid follower of cricket and rugby.
Much of his spare time will be spent walking -- he walks for 40
minutes every day before work -- and travelling around Scotland to get
to know it better.

THE Irish take their food and drink seriously. No Guinness-swilling
stereotype, but an economic realism which threatens to leave Scotland at
the starting gate in the increasingly competitive food export market.
And their success is not down to the luck of the Irish, or even ''pure
genius'', but good old common sense.
''Money makes money'' -- and the Irish certainly take this truism to
heart. While Scottish food producers and processors plough on with #30m
in Scottish Office and European grants, the Irish are pumping a massive
#641m into their food industry over the next five years. Their ambition
is to create 2000 jobs every year, and push ''Made in Ireland'' to the
top of every Euro-consumer's shopping list.
The Government of the Republic knows on which side its bread is
buttered. Ireland has a number of key selling points -- many of which,
such as beautiful scenery, clean environment, and fine produce, it
shares with Scotland -- and it invests in these strengths. Over and
above the food industry, I bet the Scottish Tourist Board wished it had
half the budget and backing of its Irish rival!
The Irish also know how to stand up for their key industries -- and
they speak loud and clear at the heart of Europe. A case of putting the
mouth where the money is.
While Scotland's voice is heard maybe once a quarter in Brussels, the
Irish are at every Council of Ministers meeting -- backed up by a
permanent committee of civil servants. Ireland is directly represented
on all key backroom agriculture, fishing, and food sub-committees, and
with the clout of a Cabinet Minister when it comes to the hard
bargaining at the top table.
Ireland in Europe is visible, participating and positive. Scotland is
Europe's ''invisible nation''. In European terms the bad jokes are
Scottish not Irish. Irish officials ask pittyingly: ''How does Scotland
cope?''
The answer is simple, we don't.
Ask David McCarthy, former boss of Marine Harvest, the world's largest
salmon farming enterprise. He is clear -- Scotland gets second best in
Europe because we are not there to speak for ourselves.
Scotland's processors and producers, outflanked in Europe, are also
undermined on the home front.
Last week when I spoke to the Tesco-sponsored Scottish Food Conference
I chose as one of my themes the low percentage of Scottish goods stocked
in Scottish supermarkets.
But when you ask the supermarkets about their percentage of Scottish
stock, the first reaction is one of ignorance -- most simply do not have
the figures, or come out with the rough estimate of 15-30%. When you
press the matter, some become prickly and defensive, and fire out
examples of a cheese producer here or a fish processor there who has
been successful in catching the eye of the largely English based
overcentralised supermarket purchasing departments.
But achievement of individual Scots is never good enough on its own.
What needs to be created is a situation where every Scottish producer
can flourish, and not be overwhelmed by the system.
As a first step I would suggest greater purchasing flexibility from
the main supermarkets. Why should a middle manager in middle England
decide what is stocked in stores in Buchan or Glasgow? Let's give
greater freedom to local store managers to bring in locally produced
products. You immediately increase the local, as well as Scottish,
percentage on shelves and boost the small, highly skilled local
producers who simply cannot provide for 40 plus nation-wide stores.
We should not be frightened of promoting our Scottishness. The
journalist Dorothy-Grace Elder has been a long ''Stock Scottish''
campaigner, and she tells of Irish stores with 80% of local produce,
stores which actually detail the amount of Irish goods purchased by each
customer, and reward those who come out with high levels of
home-produced food.
The power of the consumer has been amply demonstrated by Shell's
shambolic U-turn over the dumping of the Brent Spar. The threat of lost
revenue can provoke even the mighty to think again, and in the tightly
competitive supermarket business, the power of your Scottish pound could
be substantial.
The 1980s saw the advent of Green consumerism, now perhaps it's time
for a little Scottish consumerism. Above all it is time to think of
Scotland as a first-rate European nation, not a second-rate British
region.

JAMES SHAW GRANT, down in the Glens of Academe (June 24), argues that
the proposed University of the Highlands and Islands is the only way to
exorcise the ghosts of past failure and presumably usher in a rational
appraisal of future prospects.
From his Olympian viewpoint he clearly disapproves of the many
''intelligent and well-meaning men and women'' who have called for the
removal of the first Duke of Sutherland's effigy from Ben Bhraggie as a
symbol of change for the better in the North. Aren't these the very
people who seek a break with the ghosts of the past by the early
establishment of a modern sustainable land-use system?
As one of these land reformers and proponents of the statue's removal
I can assure Dr Grant that we were early in this campaign for the
Highland University as well. For what would be the use of this seat of
higher learning if its curriculum cannot be used to empower the very
people among whom its colleges are sited?
He makes great play of his claim that ''the Clearances have done even
greater damage to the Highlands as a memory than they did as a
historical fact''. Sadly this rhetoric blinkers his vision. How can the
resident population benefit from the university's work if they are
denied universal access to land, sea, and air resources for work, homes,
and recreation?

WHY do we need critics?
I have long been of the opinion that the reviews by critics are
meaningless. If I go to a show or concert and enjoy it I am quite happy
until I read comments, usually illfounded, which condemn the event out
of hand.
If the event is a ''one off'' concert then it is truly of no interest
to anyone and possibly does little harm.
If however it is a criticism of a show which will run for a while then
people might take the critic's view seriously and not go to the show,
thus depriving themselves of a pleasant evening.
By ''panning'' a show a critic is in effect preventing theatres from
being well-attended.

UNLIKE Elizabeth Clark (June 22), I thoroughly enjoyed the RSNO's
Mozart concert. Judging by the good turnout I reckon the programming was
to most people's taste and the RSNO in its chamber orchestra format (32
strings plus wind instruments when scored for) do get a very good sound.
The RSNO's interpretation of Mozart is a lot better than it used to be
and the area where there is perhaps scope for reflection is in slow
movements where more animation could be considered.
A thing that puzzled me about Elizabeth Clark's review was that she
seemed to be seeing more players than there actually were. In the
Sinfonia Concertante she talks about five of the RSNO principal wind and
brass players and passages for solo quintet.
Oboe, clarinet, bassoon and French horn make a total of four soloists.

I CANNOT understand how any politician, or commentator, can express a
view on Europe without taking into account three major events since the
end of the war in 1945, which have had a fundamental effect in Europe.
First, the agreement between France and Germany on steel and coal,
which led to the forming of the EEC, ended for all time the traditional
policy of Britain for the past 200 years, of maintaining the ''balance
of power'' as the main plank of foreign policy.
Secondly, the demise of the British Empire, coupled thirdly with the
rise of the dollar to be the supreme world currency medium. This
happened because Britain was broke after the war, and saved by the
dollar lend-lease agreement, which, nevertheless, gave the dollar
supreme power over sterling. Since then, of course, we have had the rise
of the German mark, again against sterling.
The blunt truth is that Britain needs Europe far more than Europe
needs Britain.

I READ James Shaw Grant's article, The Glens of Academe (June 24),
with great interest since I have long been a supporter of a University
of the Highlands. I cannot, however, understand his complaint that
''well-meaning men and women are still motivated by what happened to
their ancestors . . . six generations ago''.
By what are we to be motivated if not by the lessons of our history?
Many well-informed Scots would say the problem is quite the reverse: we
do not know enough of our own history.
Is Dr Grant saying we should forget what the Presbyterian Society for
the Propagation of Christian Knowledge did to the Gaelic language and
culture in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries? Is he suggesting
that Highlanders should forget the destruction of clan society by
Butcher Cumberland in the eighteenth century? Should we not read James
Hunter's splendid book, A Dance Called America, on the Clearances for
fear it may embitter us?
To the contrary, I would suggest that one of the most important things
a University of the Highlands could do would be to restore that history
in all its details so that we may never forget what the Rev Professor
Donald Macleod calls the ''Highland Holocaust''.
I am also worried by Dr Grant's enthusiasm for computers and his
eagerness to get rid of what some call ''campus dependency''. He seems
to fall completely for the PR verbiage of the submission to the
Millennium Commission.
Let me assure him, as a retired academic, that we can never, and
should never, be ''liberated from the chore of soaking up knowledge''.
The whole value of knowledge lies in the ''soaking up''.
No computer can ever provide a short-cut to wisdom just as nothing can
replace the companionship of staff and students on a campus, which has
been one of the chief glories of university life since Bologna eight
centuries ago.
Finally, I dispute his claim that what the monks of St Columba did in
the sixth century is ''intellectual history'' and ''carries no emotional
charge''. For me it carries a very powerful emotional charge and I
happily join Dr Grant in his call for a University of the Highlands that
will bring about a Highland Renaissance.

JAMES SHAW GRANT is, indeed, mistaken when he suggested in The Glens
of Academe (June 24) that Sir Robert Grieve had to pay his own fare when
he held his first press conference as chairman of the Highlands and
Islands Development Board.
According to Highlands and Islands -- A Generation of Progress, edited
by Alastair Hetherington, Scottish Office officials said the press
conference announcing Sir Robert's appointment as HIDB chairman should
be held in Edinburgh or Glasgow and that as he was not yet employed,
they could not pay his expenses, when he argued it should be in
Inverness.
Sir Robert insisted that it must be in Inverness and threatened to pay
his own fare, but a compromise was reached when a press officer from
Edinburgh used his own car to drive him to Inverness and charged the
mileage to St Andrew's House.

IN Clare Henry's review of the Gray's School of Art student degree
show she asserts that Edinburgh College of Art goes ''over the top with
13 painting firsts and 21 design firsts'', that the college ''always
dishes them out in handfuls'', and that if first-class degrees rise
above her ideal of 5% ''they mean nothing and devalue the entire degree
structure'' (June 19). These statements are respectively prejudicial,
inaccurate, and highly tendentious.
A reference to the Times Higher University League Tables (May 19)
shows that eight Scottish universities award between 9% and 13% of
graduands first-class honours; only Napier and Paisley are below 5%. In
Clare Henry's view, it appears that the vast majority of universities,
both north and south of the Border, devalue the entire degree structure.
She would clearly have a very low opinion of Cambridge, Oxford, and
Imperial which regularly award 16% of more of the graduands with
first-class honours degrees.
Clearly there are fluctuations in the calibre and performance of year
groups and it is certainly true that for Edinburgh College of Art 1995
has proved an exceptionally good vintage with some 20% of students being
awarded first-class honours degrees.
It is, however, worth reminding your readers if not Clare Henry who
will be well-acquainted with the assessment processes, that in all cases
the external examiners, approved and appointed by the Heriot-Watt
University Senate who award degrees at Edinburgh College of Art, have
recommended the awards.
The external examiners are people of considerable experience of art
and design education in the tertiary sector in their specialist field.
They come largely from outwith the Scottish sectors. The examiners look
at each student's work independently of the internal assessors and a
board of examiners then meets to agree the degree result.

Performing at the Istanbul Festival is something the Scottish Chamber
Orchestra and conductor Sir Charles Mackerras take seriously. SVEND
BROWN reports that the commitment goes as far as haggling in the streets
for instruments.
IMAGINE the opening night of an Edinburgh Festival. A packed Usher
Hall greets Sir Charles Mackerras who, with barely a pause for hush,
brings down his baton for the opening bars of . . . Brigadoon?
Impossible, I know. Yet this is the closest analogy I can draw to what
the Scottish Chamber Orchestra has just been doing on the other side of
Europe. It is virtually the artist-in-residence at the Istanbul
Festival, playing Turkish music and working with local musicians. At the
opposite end of the diplomatic spectrum it has also been involved in a
piece which is so full of gross caricatures of Turks it makes
Brigadoon's tacky tartanalia seem like photo realism: Mozart's opera Die
Entfuhrung Aus dem Serail -- The Escape from the Harem.
This is the latest in a series of Mozart's operas that Mackerras and
the SCO have performed together. Don Giovanni in the Usher Hall is one
thing; Entfuhrung in Istanbul is quite another. After all, this is a
city with an Islamic fundamentalist mayor. Melih Fereli, director of
Istanbul's Cultural Institute, is sanguine about it. ''I believe there
are more misconceptions about Turkey floating about Europe today than
there were when Mozart was writing the piece.''
Mozart's 1782 opera is typical in its blend of fear and mockery and
great tunes. The piece has two Turkish characters. One is an out-and-out
cartoon baddy, a sadist with snappy comic timing. The other -- a Pasha
-- is more subtle and civilised, but not above threatening torture when
he can't have his way with our plucky heroine.
So, why give them an outing in Turkey? The problem is that it simply
is the ideal place. For one thing, Istanbul has the breathtaking venue:
the plot is about an escape from a harem, so they stage it in the open
air right by the biggest and most famous of them all -- the Topkapi
Sarayi. It's not ideal for sound (everything is amplified) but it's
visually stunning. It is a place of blood and diamonds: it holds enough
jewels to dull your senses.
This opera, with its cruelty, its glorious music, and its farce, is a
perfect match for the place. To hear the overture ringing out as dusk
fell in the perfumed garden was a magical experience. A lot of the music
Mozart wrote for the piece would be called ''crossover'' music today.
The only Turkish music he knew was battle music which, even today, you
can hear daily in Instanbul.
So Mozart spiked his Vienneserie with wild piccolo writing and
percussion -- triangles, cymbals and drums. Now, most conductors have
been happy to leave it there, but Mackerras actually went to hear the
military band and saw their instruments. Before the next performance was
under way the SCO's percussionists were out combing the city for exactly
the right kind of drum. They found it, haggled, and even got an
impromptu lesson from a man who owned a nearby clothes shop.
Audiences in Glasgow and Edinburgh will be able to hear it, probably
for the first time in the UK, this autumn when the orchestra perform
Entfuhrung to celebrate Mackerras's 70th birthday. So, with this mix of
East and West, the piece is almost symbolic of the festival's desire to
be a meeting place of music from Europe and Asia. After all, Istanbul
has a foot on each continent; no piece could be more perfect.
What about that political dimension though? Fereli, himself, has no
qualms: ''Culture and art must always be separated. The politicians must
not be allowed to set an artistic agenda.'' Brave words which he is able
to stand by largely because he is virtually independent of state funding
-- only 6% of the budget is raised that way.
He is free to screen a Greek Film Festival, even at a time when
relations between Greece and Turkey are strained, to say the least. Or
show a retrospective of Derek Jarman's films in a land which officially
frowns on homosexuality. Or he can stage a Mozart opera which lambasts
Islam in the very heart of the former Ottoman empire. As he says: ''You
must always learn what people say about you to understand why they say
it.''

I WOULD echo all the comments made in your editorial (June 16) and
also the strong case put forward by Ina Taggart in respect of the
Millennium bid for Easterhouse in Glasgow.
One of the aspects of this bid was for the recruitment and training of
over 100 adult apprentices from the long-term unemployed in the
Easterhouse area. It was done for two reasons, first to get the
community directly involved in the construction of the centre, but more
importantly to reverse the serious skill decline in the area.
What better way of looking forward to the new Millenium than by
employing and training those people who have been forgotten by society?
Surely if there is going to be any credence given to the community
based bids then the Millenium Commission should be at least
reconsidering the proposals put forward for Easterhouse, otherwise the
whole concept of community involvement will be lost.
I notice from your report that Lord Dalkeith has reportedly said that
the project is not rejected. Hopefully this will mean an early
reconsideration of the bid submitted by the Greater Easterhouse
Initiative.

IF WE are to believe the propaganda, Mr John Redwood mastered calculus
at the age of three and the intricacies of Virgil, Horace, and Ovid in
primary school. That was not the impression given yesterday on Day Two
of his campaign for the Tory leadership. Day One, announcement day, was
greeted by choruses of amazement from commentators. Why, he actually had
a sense of humour and could smile (albeit jerkily) at will. By yesterday
morning the jokes were flat and it became clear that Mr Redwood's
approach to political campaigning was not dissimilar from painting by
numbers. It is impossible to doubt his sincerity, but Mr Redwood does
not have a natural bone in his body. His approach to the broad canvas of
policy is to colour in the relevant blocks for the day. Thus,
announcement day was the day of smiles and jokes. Yesterday, proclaimed
as the day of the Redwood agenda, was similarly a matter of following a
carefully pre-arranged plan to present policies which would appeal to
the widest cross-section of Tory MPs. To this end we had a caring
Redwood insisting that those living on the streets must all be given
refuge and that the disabled and elderly needed more help with shopping
and cleaning. Fiscal Redwood demanded swift reductions in taxes, though
the colours began to run together when he inexplicably linked this with
the section on more pay for doctors, nurses and teachers and the
retention of local hospitals. Mixing red and blue paint inevitably gives
purple. Mixing tax cuts and more spending inevitably brings confusion.
Defensive Redwood demanded the retention of all regiments, but again
the colours ran when he suggested that the Royal Yacht should be
retained (at a cost of #17m for a re-fit and #10m per annum running
costs). Scrapping royal yachts is another thing, it seems, that Tories
do not do. On the subject of Europe, Mr Redwood's brush flew busily. A
referendum should be held on the ceding of any further powers to Europe,
the European Court should be rebuffed, and a single currency is, of
course, an impossibility. As ever, the British public was dragged into
the affair with the confident assertion that the masses shared Mr
Redwood's distaste for involvement with Europe. Actually the masses are
agnostic and more concerned with the housing, education, and the
feel-good factor that will not return in the foreseeable future. Mr
Redwood's performance does not ring true, especially as none of it
suggested fresh thinking or really radical policies. This is because, as
the Major camp was only too keen to point out, it was remarkably similar
to the policy picture painted by the Prime Minister and the Cabinet,
including Mr Redwood, over the past two years.
The explanation for this is simple. Mr Redwood knows that, like art
historians examining the work of an ancient master, many Tory MPs are
well aware that another picture lurks underneath the one he is trying to
paint for the election. It is a more ideological picture and it involves
a minimalist State, an insurance-based national health system (it could
not be called a service), and the marking of a clear line between the
deserving poor and the undeserving poor, with the precise definition of
these unhappy states defined, of course, by Mr Redwood. It is obvious
many Tories could not stomach a Redwood government run on these lines.
It is equally obvious that, in his unsubtle way, Mr Redwood is prepared
to be pragmatic and to cast his net wider than ever before. How his
electorate will react to this attempt at broad populism is only one of
the factors in the election, but as an attempt to foster unity it has
the ring of tin.

IT MAY be an inappropriate metaphor in the circumstances but, by
putting some flesh on the bones of student hardship, university chiefs
have given us plenty to chew on. Let us first attempt to digest the
evidence, unpalatable as it may be. The Committee of Vice-Chancellors
and Principals had an excellent 80% response rate to its questionnaire
on student hardship and its impact on universities. Of about 40,000
students who dropped out in 1992/93, 15,000 left because they failed
exams. Of far greater concern, 25,000 quit for other reasons. Anecdotal
evidence, says the CVCP, strongly suggests that financial difficulties
were responsible for what was a 30% increase on the previous year of
students in this category. Or, to put it another way, students are
having a bad time and more are dropping out. And things are getting
worse as the consequences of the Government's policies to reduce the
maintenance grant to 50% of its 1990 cash value, with student loans
making up the balance, work through.
It all means more students going into debt and taking part-time work
to make ends meet. Hardly ideal preparation for the tutorial and the
exam hall, as the CVCP has found. Student leaders are surely right when
they say they detect a hidden financial pressure even in the data for
those who drop out for academic reasons. But the trouble with drop-outs
is that they are, by their nature, not around to be interviewed about
their reasons for quitting. Universities are doing more to establish the
causes of dropping out. After all, it is in no-one's interest when
students fail. We should not lose sight of the fact that a university
education is a good thing. The better your qualifications, the more
likely you are to find a job. And the lifetime earnings of graduates are
much greater than those of non-graduates. These are facts. Here also are
some figures, from the student welfare and advice centre at Glasgow
University, Scotland's biggest in terms of student numbers. On a
term-time weekly income of just over #84 it estimates the basic cost of
living -- rent, fuel, food, books, telephone, insurance -- at between
#79 and #77, depending on the type of accommodation. With a few pounds a
week left over for ''luxuries'', is it any wonder more students are
turning to part-time work and the grossly inadequate Government access
funds intended to ease the most severe hardship?
The CVCP found nearly one-third of students were unsuccessful in their
access fund claims, while one-third of universities now run job clubs,
demonstrating that part-time work is a fact of life. University is such
a good thing that the Government quite rightly wants mass participation
in the sector. But, with the relentless pressure on public expenditure,
the money is not there to meet current needs, far less fund future
expansion. Neither will the prudent red rose of Labour bloom on students
and the costs of their education. Another source of funding has to be
found. Proposals from the National Union of Students' leadership for
maintenance costs to be met by students repaying loans through income
tax and national insurance, coupled with an employers' contribution,
will eventually become policy. HE principals in Scotland already accept
the need for a student contribution. In the meantime we guddle along
with a system which, at best, gnaws at the edges of students' academic
and social existence and, at worst, proves indigestible to the point of
rejection for a growing number of undergraduates.

Why do so many want to be part of a company which does not pay? All
for the love of opera, as Michael Tumelty discovers.
THERE are around 20 small to medium scale opera companies touring
Britain at the moment. Most of them pass by without causing a ripple.
Every so often, one of them causes a bit of a stir, attracts media
attention, and the ripples begin to spread.
One such outfit, unprepossessingly called The Opera Company and billed
up here as Opera of the South, is about to make its first trip north of
the border, bringing two productions to the Edinburgh Festival Theatre
next week. To say that the company has caused a bit of a stir would be
to understate.
Audiences down south have been lapping up the two productions -- of
Verdi's Rigoletto and Mozart's The Magic Flute -- that The Opera Company
is bringing north. On the media side of the fence, the London heavies --
and, interestingly, several of the most notoriously impossible-to-please
critics -- have been singing the praises of the company and its work.
So what is The Opera Company? Who are its administrators? Its singers?
Its orchestra? Its technicians and stagecrew? Where are its home-base
theatre, workshops and administrative offices? How is it financed?
There has to be -- you might expect -- a punchline answer to all of
these questions. And there is. The Opera Company has one full-time
employee, and he is unpaid. The company is based in Tunbridge Wells, but
there is no home theatre, no in-house singers, orchestra, or technical
crew. There is a committee of volunteers, and administrative meetings
take place in whoever's house happens to be available. Oh, and the sets
for each production are stored on a farm in Sussex, owned by one of the
committee who has set aside a barn for the purpose.
The entire enterprise is the vision of John Marshall, a 33-year-old
music graduate out of Hull and Leeds universities. ''I suppose it is a
bizarre set up,'' said Marshall of his company. ''I do the artistic
administration, I'm the only full-time employee -- except I've never
been paid -- and I have a voluntary committee of between six and eight.
We spend zero on administration, and all monies go straight into the
company.''
Marshall founded The Opera Company in 1989. He had taken a master's
degree in opera at Leeds, and while there had directed The Magic Flute.
Though bitten by the opera bug, he couldn't get a job in production, so
worked as a hospital porter for three years while he cultivated the
dream of his own company.
Brass neck is one commodity Marshall is evidently not short of: in the
first year of his company, he placed an ad in the paper, auditioned 18
singers, auditioned and appointed an orchestra, got some sponsorship,
and did the whole lot without having to pay anybody a fee.
The next year the number of singers auditioned went up to 50, the year
after to 100, and the year after that to 200. ''Now we're getting about
500 applications per year,'' he said. His orchestra of about 33 is
formed from young freelances and London-based musicians who've just left
college.
Technical staff, from carpenters to lighting men, tend to arrive by
recommendation. ''We appoint one, and then use their network of
contacts,'' said Marshall.
Following a fallow year in 1994 -- ''we had no funding, so did
nothing, and took the year to plan and regroup'' -- this year, with
funding from (for the first time) the Arts Council, the Foundation for
Sport and the Arts, and from South East Arts, Marshall has a budget of
about #250,000. Ergo the first national tour of the company. ''Touring
and accommodation costs are expensive, so we're heavily dependent on box
office,'' he said.
The Marshall philosophy for opera is straightforward. Accessibility
and comprehensibility are all; everything is sung in English. And he is
on the hunt for new talent. ''One of our roles is to nurture young
talent. I know that this is often an excuse to exploit young singers,
but we do offer them good opportunities to work with quality directors
in productions where they will be noticed by agents.'' (Coincidentally,
one of the young singers who has worked recently with The Opera Company
last week won the Cardiff Singer of the World Competition.)
And somehow -- persuasive advocacy or brass neck? -- without being
able to offer hefty fees, Marshall coaxes interesting directors to work
with the company. Clare Venables, formerly of the Crucible Theatre,
Sheffield, is responsible for what has been hailed as a remarkably fresh
production of The Magic Flute, while the young Lithuanian director,
Dalia Ibelhauptaite (who has been appointed to produce Madam Butterfly
for Opera North next season) is in charge of Rigoletto.
Conductors will be (for Rigoletto) Roy Laughlin, head of music at
Opera North, and (for The Magic Flute) Nicholas Kok, familiar in these
parts, and also associated with English National Opera.
The Opera Company operation grows, and John Marshall reckons they are
being taken seriously by the big companies now. There's still no money
in it for him, however, so what does he get out of it? ''I go to every
performance; I never miss a show. I do it for kicks . . . and the kicks
get bigger all the time.''

IF Offenbach, in Rossini's famous phrase, was the Mozart of the
Champs-Elysees, the same could be said of delightful Delibes. Why then,
has Le Roi l'a Dit -- the most masterly of his comedies -- been allowed
to languish, in Britain if not abroad?
As an amiable send-up of the aristocracy it is admittedly one of many
of its kind, but its endearingly preposterous plot, its apt and charming
music, and its irresistible Frenchness place it in a class apart. In
this week's witty staging by the RSAMD's opera department, at the New
Athenaeum Theatre, its quality shines through clear and true.
Delibes was an engaging melodist, and the score of Thus Saith The King
-- as the RSAMD has translated it -- is finely worked. With eight female
roles and six male ones (sometimes singing simultaneously) it makes an
excellent student piece. While savouring its humour Mark Tinkler's
production wisely does not transform it into slapstick or coarsen the
complications of the story of a Marquis, father of four daughters, who
by a slip of the tongue informs Louis XIV that he has a son.
By updating the action to 19th century Belgium, Tinkler does it no
damage. The fun grows naturally from the music, and never seems
superimposed. The young cast look good and cope well. As the housemaid
heroine with the courage of Mozart's Susanna, Joan McKay sings her
coloratura lines brightly and nimbly. Timothy Dean draws graceful,
spirited accompaniments from his student players, and Julian Crouch's
quick-changing cut-out designs add their own merriment to the evening.
Two more performances, with differing casts, tonight and tomorrow.

Frances Horsburgh reports on how an eye is being kept on the new
unitary authorities as they appoint senior staff
LOCAL government in Scotland -- or at least in some parts of it --
hasn't exactly been covering itself with glory recently. And that
doesn't just mean Monklands District Council.
Since the local elections for the new single-tier councils were held
on April 6, a growing number of ''jobs for the boys'' stories and claims
of ''political carve-ups'' have surfaced about the procedures being used
to appoint some of the senior officials to the new authorities.
It was agreed that the jobs should be ring-fenced initially for those
in local government, although councils could agree to advertise more
widely. But the elections were no sooner over before some of the new
chief executives were in place with what seemed to many to be unseemly
haste.
Recently complaints have been made of favouritism, of jobs being
filled without competitive interviews, and the process of appointments
becoming part of internecine warfare between councillors whose
allegiances are still with the region or district.
The man on whose desk a number of such official complaints have ended
up is Robert Peggie, chairman of the Local Government Staff Commission
which was appointed by the Secretary of State Ian Lang to safeguard the
interests of the 300,000 staff caught up in the upheaval of
reorganisation.
Not only does he read the complaints but he hears all the rumours,
too, as his five fellow members of the commission keep close contact
with the 29 shadow councils many of whose members remain until next
April as councillors with the present regional and district councils.
Last week at an Edinburgh meeting Peggie had the opportunity to
express his ''disappointment'' about the conduct of some of those
involved to the 29 chief executives of the new authorities.
Speaking to The Herald at the commission's Edinburgh office yesterday,
Peggie stressed that fair play must be seen to be done over the filling
of the remaining 250 to 300 council jobs at director and depute director
level.
He said: ''There was an expectation that the authorities would act
with good professional practice and they would ensure that there was
fair play in relation to those seeking appointments, but a number of
problems have been thrown up in the process.
''The staff commission have expressed their view to the chief
executives and implored them to examine their professional practice and
invited them to discuss with the politicians the procedures being
used.''
Peggie said councils should remember they had a duty to comply with
the rules the commission had issued after consulting with local
government. The commission had the full support of the Convention of
Scottish Local Authorities (Cosla) in attempting to get authorities to
adopt proper procedures.
For example, making appointments without holding interviews broke the
rules put forward by the commission.
He also warned that the new council leaders should remember that the
Secretary of State had a reserve power to direct councils to comply with
the commission's advice where he felt it necessary. Peggie added: ''The
new councils must remember that they will be judged by the practices
they have adopted in the appointment of staff, which is one of the most
important tasks they have been given to do.''
The commission was alarmed at the speed with which some of the new
chief executives' appointments were made and wrote to the shadow
councils saying three weeks should be allowed between the time the job
was advertised to council staff and interviews being held.
Peggie admitted it would be very difficult now for the commission to
take action over appointments which had already been made. But he
revealed it was currently discussing what redress individuals might have
with regard to this kind of situation.
The problem was that mechanisms were not yet in place at the new
councils to deal with such complaints. However the law stated that
appointments had to be made on merit and the Scottish Secretary could be
asked to investigate on this basis.
Many senior posts remain to be filled at the new councils by the end
of the year, and the commission hopes standards will now be raised where
necessary. The majority of councils, it acknowleges, have acted
responsibly and professionally.
Peggie, a former chief executive of Lothian Regional Council, recalls
that after the last re-organisation 20 years ago the new regional and
district councils got off to a disastrous start by levying large rate
increases. This was largely due to high inflation, but the public
perceived them as profligate and their staff as too highly paid.
Peggie warned councils, ''to be mindful of their public responsibility
in conducting the whole of the appointments process on a professional
basis which is beyond reproach and is seen to be fair to those who are
currently employed in Scottish local government''.

Dubai, Tuesday,
QATAR'S Crown Prince ousted his father in a bloodless palace coup
today, but the deposed emir declared defiantly from Geneva that he
remained ruler of the wealthy Gulf oil state and would return ''whatever
the cost''.
''I am not happy with what has happened but it had to be done and I
had to do it,'' Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani said in a 90-second
televised speech after announcing he had taken over.
His father, Sheikh Khalifa bin Hamad al-Thani, called his son an
''ignorant man'' and, in a statement issued in Geneva, said he was still
the legitimate ruler and would return.
In the Qatari capital Doha, the move appeared to go smoothly and to
have the backing of the ruling al-Thani family, whose members along with
the Consultative Council pledged allegiance to Sheikh Hamad.
Television for most of the day showed the new Emir receiving members
of the ruling family, the Council, and tribesmen.
Residents said troops ringed the deposed emir's Rayyan Palace, where
members of Sheikh Khalifa's 2000-strong personal guard were based. No
incidents were reported.
Sheikh Hamad told an emergency Cabinet meeting that his action had
been dictated by what he called the country's situation: ''God knows
that I was not seeking power by this method for the love of power. It is
rather a heavy responsibility and a great trust, and I beseech Almighty
God to guide us.''
The coup followed several weeks of a power struggle in which Sheikh
Khalifa, 63, apparently tried to claw back powers he had passed on to
his 45-year-old eldest son in the past three years.
The deposed emir, who himself came to power in a coup in 1972 when he
ousted his uncle, said in Geneva, where he went last week after state
visits to Egypt and Tunisia: ''I am still their legitimate emir, whether
it is for the royal family, for the people, or for the army, and I will
return home whatever it costs.''
Qatar's interior and foreign ministers left Doha for Saudi Arabia
where Gulf diplomats said they were expected to meet the deposed emir at
the request of Riyadh.
They said Interior Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Khalifa al-Thani,
brother of the new emir, and Foreign Minister Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr
al-Thani, a member of the ruling family, were asked by Saudi Arabia to
go there to meet the ousted emir.
''They will either meet the (deposed) emir or his representative,''
one diplomat said.
The Qatari news agency had earlier said that Sheikh Hamad sent the two
ministers to his powerful neighbour with a message for Saudi King Fahd.
Saudi Arabia, the dominant Gulf Arab state, and most other Gulf states
have yet to react to Sheikh Hamad's takeover.
The deposed emir said he had contacted leaders of the five other
states in the Gulf Co-operation Council -- Saudi Arabia, Bahrain,
Kuwait, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates -- and that they and other
Arab leaders ''all expressed their total support for the legitimate rule
and they denounced what has happened''.
Oman, however, in later said Muscat ''considers the change . . . an
internal affair concerning only the government and the people of
Qatar''.
Like Qatar, Oman has shown itself minded to be independent of Riyadh.
Outside the Gulf, Jordan's King Hussein became the first Arab ruler to
congratulate Sheikh Hamad while an Arab League spokesman said the coup
was an internal affair.
The Foreign Office wished the new government well and said it did not
want to intervene in internal political matters. A spokesman said the
3000-strong British community was ''fine and well'' and the situation
was calm.
Qatar, about half the size of Wales and with 500,000 people, is a
small oil producer but sits on one of the world's largest natural gas
reserves.
Qatar has under the guidance of Sheikh Hamad befriended Iran, restored
ties with Gulf War foe Iraq, and gone further than other Gulf states in
normalising ties with Israel -- all largely at odds with Saudi
policies.--Reuter.

Helsinki, Tuesday.
EUROPEAN Ministers today vowed to do more to help men exercise their
right to a full family life, saying this must be equal to women's rights
to take on paid work.
''It is not sufficient to achieve the equal participation of women in
the world of work,'' said Claudia Nolte, German Minister for Women,
Youth, Family, and Pensioners.
''We must, by the same token, afford fathers the opportunity to live
in and with their families,'' she said in a speech to Ministers from 35
European countries at a three-day conference on family affairs.
After decades of campaigning for women's rights, experts are now
worried about the status and role of men. Sociologists say more men want
to be closely involved in raising their children but are often held back
by work and rigid social attitudes.
Daniel Tarschys, secretary general of the Council of Europe which
organised the conference, urged governments and fathers to take more
action to boost men's involvement in the family.
A father figure was essential to keep young men from violence like
hooliganism in sport and inner-cities, he told the two-day conference.
''Close involvement in a child's early life is a major life experience
for men,'' said Tarschys, the first Swedish MP to take paternity leave
from the House.
Efforts to boost flexibility in the work place -- for instance through
paternity leave and more part-time work for men -- should continue,
Tarschys said. And fathers must keep sharing financial responsibility
for children if a family breaks up.
''Even if women don't always feel they need men, men do need women,
and children need fathers,'' Tarschys told delegates.--Reuter.

Providence, Tuesday.
A RABBI who stood by President Nixon throughout Watergate said he
believes journalist Diane Sawyer was ''Deep Throat'', the source who
helped the Washington Post to uncover the scandal.
Sawyer is one of America's best-known broadcast journalists today. She
was an assistant in the Nixon press office when the scandal that drove
Nixon from office was developing in the early 1970s.
She said through a spokesman that the claim was laughable.
And Bob Woodward, the reporter for The Washington Post who has never
revealed the identity of his source, said there was no truth to the
story.
''For 20 years we've always said that the source 'Deep Throat' was a
man,'' said Woodward, now an assistant managing editor at the Post.
''There is no evidence that Diane Sawyer in her kind of subsidiary
role in the Nixon White House would have that kind of knowledge.''
Rabbi Baruch Korff, 80, said he based his opinion on Sawyer's
''special relationship'' with press secretary Ron Ziegler, and his
observation that Sawyer had advance knowledge of what was going on at
the White House.
''I believed it was her,'' Korff said from his home, where he is ill
with pancreatic cancer. ''I have no solid evidence of it, but everything
points to it.''
Sawyer's agent, Richard Liebner, said Woodward and his former Post
colleague Carl Bernstein ''would probably have a good laugh'' over the
story.
Korff did not reveal his suspicion in his 1994 book The President and
I, which chronicles his relationship with Nixon. He did not say why he
had kept his suspicions quiet until now.
People have speculated that Deep Throat may have been L Patrick Gray,
then acting FBI chief, or Alexander Haig, who worked at the time for
National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger. Other names have also been
mentioned.
The famous source led Woodward and Bernstein to the discovery of
financial discrepancies and attempts to cover up criminal activity among
the president's top staffers. Nixon resigned on August 6, 1974, and died
last year.--AP.

Addis Ababa, Tuesday,
ETHIOPIAN police named the suspected mastermind behind yesterday's
failed attempt on the life of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
A TV statement appealed to the public for help in apprehending Muhamed
Seraj, whose nationality was not given. It screened a photograph of a
fair-skinned man of Arab appearance.
Ethiopia offered a large reward yesterday for information about the
whereabouts of Mubarak's surviving would-be assassins.
Two gunmen, both of Arab origin according to the Ethiopian government,
and two local policemen were killed during the attack in Addis Ababa.
Mubarak was unhurt.
Police were hunting five escapees.
Thousands of Egyptians flooded a reception at Mubarak's palace in
Cairo this morning in a pubic outpouring of relief at his narrow
escape.--Reuter.

Moscow, Tuesday
A FACE-SAVING compromise took shape in Russia today to avert the fall
of the government and stave off possible early elections.
After a week of wrangling between the government and the fractious
State Duma (lower house), MPs said a ''zero option'' deal was being
worked out to avoid a vote of confidence scheduled for Saturday.
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's government is very unlikely to
secure the 226 ballots needed to survive such a vote since the Duma
bristles with opponents.
Under the compromise, MPs would exercise their option of holding a
vote of no-confidence -- as opposed to a confidence motion.
This would enable opposition MPs, such as the powerful Agrarians, to
abstain without losing political face.
The balance of forces in the Duma means it is far easier for the
government to survive a no-confidence vote than to win a confidence
ballot.--Reuter.

THE campaign to stop the threatened closure of Aberdeen's Food Science
Laboratory intensified yesterday, with the fight being taken to London.
A delegation from the 100 staff handed in a petition with 18,000
signatures to the House of Commons and also met an all-party group of
MPs.
Those fighting for the Aberdeen centre say it plays a vital food
health role.
A letter urging retention of the Torry laboratory also was handed in
to the Fisheries and Agriculture Minister, Mr William Waldegrave.
The staff had travelled to London depite a warning that they would
lose a day's pay if they took part.
SNP leader Alex Salmond met Mr Waldegrave yesterday when he sought
guarantees over the funding offered to Torry's rival laboratory at York.
''There are big question marks over some of the figures being offered
by the Ministry and doubts whether Torry is competing on a level playing
field,'' said Mr Salmond. The bulk of the jobs at the Torry centre would
be transferred to a new laboratory in York.
While the political pressure to keep the Torry centre open is being
maintained, a task force is preparing a rescue package to be presented
to Mr Waldegrave next week.
The Minister has said he will consider any alternatives produced.

HELEN LILLIE takes tea with the First Lady at the White House, and is
impressed with the soon-to-be newspaper columnist.
FIRST Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton is going to write a weekly column.
It will appear in 2400 newspapers worldwide by way of the Creators
Syndicate, starting on Sunday, July 23.
When she joins the ranks of professional journalists, ''I'll be more
than an 'Honorary' member of the club,'' she told the prestigious
American News Women's Club here, to whom she made the announcement at
the White House on Monday. When someone remarked: ''I can't wait to see
your copy!'' Hillary responded frankly: ''I can't wait either!''
She won't, she freely admits, be breaking new ground as a syndicated
First Lady. Eleanor Roosevelt, her self-confessed role model, wrote a
daily piece. ''She was always there before me!'' Hillary confessed.
Her approach, however, will be different from Eleanor's My Day which
took the form of a personal diary. Hillary plans to deal with ''the
issues on people's minds'' interspersed with stories about innumerable
individuals, many of them leading ''truly heroic lives'' and involved in
unpublicised but worthwhile projects. Through describing their
activities she hopes ''to bring people a little bit closer. Because
democracy,'' she wound up, her blue-green eyes flashing, ''is us.''
Although she was careful to name no names, Mrs Bill Clinton contrived
to let her feelings be known about critics of her husband's
administration.
Talking at some length about the statistically established usefulness
to pre-school children of juvenile public-television programmes,
comparing this with the dire effects of those evil, violent shows on
commercial stations, Hillary suggested that ''research'' was preferable
to ''an ideological battle'' in evaluating worth. This was a direct shot
at Newt Gingrich who wants to cut out government funding for the
so-called ''public'' broadcasting system.
She also quoted from conversations she'd held with women whose
mammograms had shown suspected cancer but who couldn't afford biopsies
or surgery because they had no health insurance.
The News Women -- among them some pretty tough cookies -- were charmed
by her. They also appreciated her approach to entertaining them at the
White House, which has become a Washington tradition. Instead of the
usual hand-addressed formal invitation to afternoon tea, we received
typed letters reinforced and, since notice was short, in some cases
replaced by a telephone call.
Upon arrival, we had a few minutes to gawk at the beautiful rooms on
the main floor, and discover that the few changes in decoration were
unobtrusive. We were then served coffee and tea.
Then we waited and time passed . . . We photographed each other in
every room, including the Ladies'. Rumours began to fly that the First
Lady's tight schedule was running late and maybe, just maybe, she
wouldn't have much time to talk with us. There were two reactions. One
group didn't care, they just enjoyed being in the White House and seeing
old friends who hadn't been to a club meeting in years. The rest of us
wanted to hear what Hillary had to say.
And we did. At 3pm we were ushered into the huge East Room where rows
of gold-painted chairs were set up, each one with a thick folder full of
Mrs Clinton's speeches on major policy issues.
Then she made her entrance, a small, straight graceful figure in a
plain but beautiful pale-green silk jacket and skirt. Her hairstyle of
the day was loose, feminine, and becoming. She wore small pearl-earrings
with a modest diamond, and a triple-strand pearl choker strongly
reminiscent of Barbara Bush.
Seen up close, she has a beautiful complexion. She also has a clear
and remarkably accentless voice which sounded a little hoarse, her only
sign of tiredness though she had had a busy day. Everyone remarked,
later, how young and pretty she looked, and how poised and at ease with
everyone -- for we all met her and had our moment of conversation.
Every First Lady since Mrs Calvin Coolidge has been an honorary
American News Woman. So is the Queen Mum who visited the clubhouse, as
did Betty Ford. Since then, we've been to the White House during every
administration, but with very different styles of entertainment,
possibly reflecting our hostess's attitude towards the press. Hillary's
was, to date, the most professionally oriented, although Rosalyn Carter
came close to it.
Nancy Reagan waited until her last week in residence before she
entertained us. By then, stringent security was in force at 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue and, as happened this week when we arrived at the
designated entrance all our handbags went through the kind of scanner
airports use. Mrs Reagan provided an elegant afternoon tea of tiny
sandwiches and calorie-laden cakes served buffet style in the two
beautiful public rooms on the main floor, while the Marine band played
in the entrance hall.
Nancy only appeared in person briefly, when she received us in the
little Red Drawingroom. Before going through the door, we were
courteously relieved of our purses by Secret Service women who assured
us we'd get everything back on our way out. Sure enough they were
waiting for us on a table in the lobby.
We guessed the reason behind this procedure when, less than a year
later, Barbara Bush entertained us to a less ostentatious tea. We were
still carrying our pocketbooks when we came into her presence and, as we
waited our turn to meet her, nearly every newspaperwoman produced a
camera to take some unofficial snaps of the First Lady.
On each occasion, including the latest one, we were photographed
individually shaking hands with our hostess. When we got our copies from
the Reagan visit, those of us who, like me, towered over the tiny Nancy
were surprised to find that she looked taller than we did. Her face also
appeared young and unlined. Well, as a former movie actress she
appreciated the importance of camera angles.
But of those two events what stayed in my memory was the delicious tea
and various other incidents and comments involving my colleagues rather
than the brief encounter with the First Lady. I don't think that will be
my recollection of Hillary Rodham Clinton. I think I'll retain a mental
picture of a good-looking, smart woman standing up and talking to a
highly intelligent audience on their own level -- and being accepted by
them as a fellow professional.

EURO-MP Bill Miller has complained that a Scottish Office reply to his
questions about an Italian consortium's A74 upgrading debacle reads like
a scene from Yes, Minister.
He is so bemused by the perceived gobbledegook that another
explanation from Scottish Office Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton
will be sought -- this time, one ''which can be readily understood''.
The Glasgow MEP has alleged that a Scottish Office reduction in a late
completion penalty clause against Castelli Girola has cost taxpayers
#400,000.
The consortium was already four months behind schedule in February --
and facing a #1m bill for delays -- when it called in Edinburgh-based
Morrison Construction to complete outstanding works between Eaglesfield
and Kirkpatrick Fleming for #4m.
Since then, original penalties in meeting the contract have been
reduced from #250,000 a month to #150,000 a month after a Scottish
Office ''reassessment'' of the liquidated damages clause.
Mr Miller sought a full explanation for the Milan-based firm's being
charged only #600,000 in damages for delays to a contract which he had
warned could not be met by the Italians because the winning #23.4m
tender was so low.
It is suspected the reassessment of damages was due to Scottish Office
fears that costs of forcibly removing Castelli Girola from the job and
bringing in another contractor would have hit the public purse even
more.
In his reply, Lord James admits the contract was ''in a perilous
state'' from November to February. He regretted the delays, but
considered the rescue package had been remarkably successful.
The letter from Lord James contains a lengthy and complex explanation
for reducing the liquidated damages, which includes:
* Applying ''a formula to the total estimated contract value, despite
the fact that 40% of contract value would not be used until the adjacent
contract was also completed,'' and:
* The contractor being able to challenge that the liquidated damages
''were in effect a penalty being well in excess of what the client could
claim was a genuine pre-estimate of his potential loss to the delay''.
Mr Miller will now tell Lord James that the reply was ''written in
typical Yes, Minister language . . . but, no matter how hard you try to
hide it, there has been loss to the Scottish Office and ultimately the
public purse''.
The MEP is particularly concerned that it would appear Castelli Girola
had been vetted a second time by the Scottish Office and found to be
sound after concerns were expressed by suppliers and others.
Lord James, in his letter, is adamant that the contract was
administered with absolute correctness and fairness as the Scottish
Office strove to recover from a difficult position, particularly for
sub-contractors and suppliers.
He said objectives to get the contract back on the rails; limit the
cost to the public purse; get sub-contractors and suppliers paid, and
the new road opened as soon as possible, had been achieved, and added:
''In all this, the protection of the public purse has been the foremost
objective.''
The cost of removing Castelli Girola and getting another contract to
complete the works -- then pursuing the consortium through the courts --
would have been considerable ''and not assured of success''.
The 20-month contract to build a 1.4-kilometre section of motorway at
Annan, Dumfriesshire, was supposed to be completed last November. It is
still ongoing.
One Italian sub-contractor is involved in a #5m dispute with Castelli
Girola.

PEACE campaigner Gordon Wilson, whose words of forgiveness after the
death of his daughter in the IRA's Enniskillen bombing moved the world,
died yesterday from a heart attack.
The 67-year-old Irish senator and retired draper was taken ill at his
home in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, yesterday morning. He was rushed
to the local Erne Hospital but doctors were unable to save his life.
It was the latest tragedy to hit the Wilson family. His daughter,
Marie, died at his side in the Remembrance Day bombing which killed 11
people in 1987 and his son, Peter, died in a car crash last December.
His wife, Joan, was in Galway when the news of her husband's death was
broken to her.
Mr Wilson, appointed as an independent member of the Irish senate in
1993, had the media spotlight turned on him when, hours after the
Enniskillen bombing, he forgave the IRA killers of his daughter and said
he bore them no ill-will.
Once in the spotlight, he stayed there in a bid to win peace for
Northern Ireland. In April 1993 -- just after the Warrington bombing --
he met, at his own request, with the IRA and begged them to call a halt.
At that stage, they were not ready and sent him away from a
two-and-a-half hour meeting empty-handed. ''I got nothing from them. I
thought I would get something but this meeting has not brought us any
closer to peace, not one inch,'' he said.
But it was his words of forgiveness after the Enniskillen bombing that
won him notoriety and worldwide acclaim. ''I have lost my daughter and
we shall miss her but I bear no ill-will, I bear no grudge,'' he said.
''Dirty sort of talk is not going to bring her back to life. Don't ask
me, please, for a purpose. I don't have a purpose. I don't have an
answer. But I know there has to be a plan.
''If I didn't think that, I would commit suicide. It's part of a
greater plan and God is good. And we shall meet again'', he said.
His account of how father and daughter lay trapped under the rubble
holding hands after the bombing, and her last words, ''Daddy, I love you
very much'', made the world weep.
A deeply religious Methodist, Mr Wilson could not condemn and could
not call for revenge. His belief assured him that there had to be a
reason for the death of his daughter.
His absence of bitterness moved Presidents and Prime Ministers to
write, and royalty to visit Enniskillen. The Queen offered a personal
tribute to Mr Wilson in her Christmas address weeks after the bombing.
The ordinary country draper, who ''out of common courtesy'' could not
refuse an interview request, found himself sucked into the media
mainstream. Never publicly identifying himself with any party, he sat in
the Irish senate as an independent after being nominated by former Irish
Premier Albert Reynolds in 1993.
Mr Reynolds said yesterday: ''He personified peace and reconciliation.
He went among the people, both North and South, and carried his message
to both North and South in the same gentle manner, and undoubtedly made
his own singular contribution towards the start of peace and
reconciliation on this island.''
Mr Reynolds also appointed Senator Wilson to the Forum for Peace and
Reconciliation, which was established after last year's IRA ceasefire.
Sinn Fein chairman Mitchel McLaughlin said: ''Sinn Fein has learned
with deep regret of the death of Gordon Wilson. Despite the tragedies
that affected his life, he contributed positively to the dialogue and
debate about the future of this island.''
Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew said Mr Wilson was ''a
unique figure in public life'' who held a reputation around the world as
a man of integrity, compassion, and tremendous moral courage.
Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring said: ''As a distinguished member
of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation and a member of the senate, he
has made an invaluable contribution to building a new Ireland based on
tolerance, forgiveness and mutual respect, virtues which he embodied as
few others have done.''
Labour leader Tony Blair said: ''One of the great architects of peace
in Northern Ireland, Gordon Wilson showed that a small voice could
change history.''
Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown said: ''I am very sorry to hear
we have lost a man whose personal courage and deep humanity was an
inspiration to all, especially to those who seek peace in Ireland.''
The father of Warrington bomb blast victim Tim Parry described Mr
Wilson as an inspirational man of ''stature, dignity and great
commonsense''. Mr Colin Parry and his wife Wendy met Mr Wilson when he
visited their home the day after their 12-year-old son died in hospital
in 1993.

Sarajevo, Tuesday
BOSNIA'S government met Western threats to withdraw United Nations
troops today with an offer to exchange the mission for an end to the UN
arms embargo crippling its army.
Foreign Minister Muhamed Sacirbey accused the UN force of serving
Western political interests despite a demand by the European Union
summit in France for the lifting of the 39-month Serb siege of Sarajevo.
The killing continued in the Bosnian capital today as witnesses
reported that a child was killed and four other people wounded when a
shell landed between two buildings in central Sarajevo.
Meanwhile Nato prepared to unveil a contingency plan tomorrow for
60,000 troops to go Bosnia to protect any withdrawal of the 22,500
peacekeepers.
Sacirbey said: ''I don't think the international community, or certain
world leaders, get it. They think we are begging for (the UN) to stay.
The message is clear . . . you may leave.''
He said Sarajevo was not pressing the UN force to pull out, but was
ready for their departure if that was the price for access to the modern
heavy weapons it needs.
The embargo has damaged the Bosnian army's ability to defend itself
against Bosnian Serbs, who inherited an arsenal of tanks and artillery
from rump Yugoslavia.
Britain and France, who provide the backbone of the UN mission, have
repeatedly threatened to pull out their troops if fighting escalates
again as the Bosnian army tries to ease the siege.
However the emphasis at the summit was on fresh diplomatic pressure on
the Serbs, backed by a 10,000-man Rapid Reaction Force due to be
operational by the middle of next month.
The EU asked its new mediator, Carl Bildt, to negotiate the lifting of
the siege and the opening of a supply corridor for Sarajevo's 380,000
population.
With the city enduring more of the Serb shelling that has killed or
maimed dozens of people this month, Bildt said: ''In my view, we are
more likely to head for war than peace in the immediate future.''
Reporting on his first round of talks with Bosnia's war leaders, Bildt
called the siege ''unacceptable to the conscience of Europe . . . this
is not warfare, this is savagery''.--Reuter.

<TEXT>
FORENSIC scientists were yesterday searching a fire-damaged house for
clues to the killings of two elderly sisters found battered to death.
Miss Elsie Gregory, 72, and her widowed sister, Mrs Aileen Dudhill,
80, had been bludgeoned around the head in their semi-detached home in
Rotherham, South Yorkshire, before the house was set on fire.
The killings have shocked detectives and neighbours in the quiet
residential area around the house in Herringthorpe Valley Road.
As more than 60 officers began house-to-house inquiries, the man
leading the hunt, Detective Superintendent Bob Purdey, branded the
murders an ''atrocity''.
''I have told detectives this morning that it is one of the worst
crimes I have ever had to deal with,'' he said yesterday. ''It is the
double killing of two completely defenceless old ladies.''
He said the blaze was most likely started in an attempt to conceal the
murders but fire damage had been confined to the dining rooom where the
sisters were found on Sunday evening and forensic experts were hopeful
of being able to find some clues.
Police have not yet found a motive but have not ruled out robbery.
There were no signs of forced entry to the red-brick house where the
sisters had lived for more than 10 years.
Detective Superintendent Purdey said an intruder could have entered
while the pair were in the garden in the sun during the afternoon, or
could have been let into the house. Why the house was targeted is not
known.
''It is a normal semi-detached in a normal residential area,'' said
Detective Superintendent Purdey. ''It is not a house of any splendour
and neither would you pick it out as one that two elderly ladies lived
in. It is a mystery.''
The sisters were known in the area as a caring couple who helped run a
Neighbourhood Watch scheme. Together with Mrs Dudhill's husband, they
had run a wholesale greengrocery business in Rotherham before retiring.

FRENCH Defence Minister Charles Millon yesterday warned Britain to buy
the Franco-German Tiger helicopter gunship or face exclusion from future
defence and aerospace collaborative projects in Europe.
A decision on the British Army's first dedicated gunship purchase,
worth up to #2500m is expected by mid-July. More than 90 attack
helicopters are to be ordered as ''flying tanks''. Three consortia are
bidding for the contract.
The Army and the Defence Ministry's equipment acquisition committee
favour the Westland-McDonnell Douglas Apache, the US aircraft which won
its spurs in combat during the Gulf War.
The third and cheapest option comes from GEC-Marconi and the US Bell
corporation with an updated Vietnam-era Cobra gunship known as the
Venom. The British end of the operation would supply a new cockpit and a
four-bladed rotor which would enable the helicopter to fly missions from
aircraft carriers.
GEC-Marconi claim their bid is up to #500,000 cheaper than those of
their rivals, and would create up to 250 new jobs in Scotland as well as
safeguarding 250 others at the company's Edinburgh site.
Mr Millon told Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind in London yesterday
that France and Germany expect the UK to give preference to European
designs in defence procurement to help stabilise the ailing defence and
aerospace industries.
The Germans have also said they will block British participation in
future ventures unless the Tiger wins the competition. The Franco-German
bid is being supported by British Aerospace, which stands to gain
millions of pounds in offset production deals.
Mr Millon said later: ''I cannot see the point in joining a European
armaments agency and then buying elsewhere. European preference, by
definition of membership, must be implemented.''
Defence procurement Minister Roger Freeman said last night that he was
keeping an open mind on the contest.
Senior Army sources fear that French and German pressure will lead to
a compromise solution in which numbers of both Tiger and Apache
helicopters will be bought for political reasons. This would add to the
Army Air Corps' training, support and maintenance problems.
A spokesman for GEC-Marconi added: ''Our amended bid has been made
possible through collaboration with the US Marine Corps, which already
operates a version of the aircraft.
''The US would supply the amended airframe, and we would supply the
integrated cockpit technology. The Venom would then represent the best
value for the British taxpayer, combining lowest procurement costs with
lowest operating and life-cycle costs.
''It would create or secure up to 500 jobs in Scotland, and would also
be the only one of the three contenders with the flexibility for
operations from an aircraft carrier in crises such as that in the former
Yugoslavia.''
A final decision on the purchase may be postponed because of the
leadership election in the Conservative Party.

Singapore, Tuesday
A BRITON on the run from prison will face trial in Singapore in
September accused of murdering a South African tourist, his lawyer said.
At a closed-door pre-trial conference, Supreme Court registrar Chiam
Boon Keng set September 25 to October 6 as the tentative dates for the
high court hearing of 35-year-old John Martin Scripps.
Lawyer Edmond Pereira did not say how Mr Scripps would plead and gave
no details about the possible line of defence.
Mr Scripps faces 13 charges, including the murder of a 32-year-old
South African tourist, Gerard George Lowe.
Various parts of what was believed to be Mr Lowe's dismembered body
were found floating in bags in Singapore harbour in March.
Mr Scripps is also a suspect in the murders of a Canadian woman and
her son in the Thai island resort of Phuket and has been linked to
grisly murder cases in San Francisco, Mexico, and Belize.
He had been jailed in Britain for drug possession and absconded when
he was released on parole last year.--Reuter.

THE crew of an RAF Nimrod escaped injury yesterday after a fire
started under the floor of their aircraft.
A fire warning light came on in the maritime reconnaissance plane as
it flew south-west of Tiree on a routine sortie just before noon.
The Nimrod, from 120 Squadron at RAF Kinloss, Grampian, made an
emergency landing at Stornoway Airport 20 minutes later.
Flight Lieutenant Simon Collier, of RAF Kinloss, said: ''The fire was
extinguished very quickly by the crew.
''Diverting to Stornoway for an emergency landing was purely a
precautionary measure.'' None of the 12 crew were hurt and the Nimrod
landed at Stornoway accompanied by the local coastguard rescue
helicopter.
Flight Lieutenant Collier said there was ''absolutely no connection''
with the fire in two engines which resulted in another Nimrod making an
emergency landing in the Moray Firth, near Kinloss, on May 16.

A YOUTH who admitted causing a blaze at a school which resulted in
almost #1.5m worth of damage had sentence deferred for reports at the
High Court in Glasgow, yesterday.
Ladyton Primary School, in Bonhill, Dumbartonshire, may now have to be
demolished and rebuilt because of Khristopher Duncan's prank with a
lighter, the court was told.
Mr Hugh Matthews, QC, prosecuting, said the 17-year-old had been
playing with two young friends, aged 13 and 11, on the school roof
during the holidays last July.
Duncan of Ladyton, Bonhill, noticed a hole in the roof with a piece of
polythene sticking out of it. He put his lighter to the polythene and
then dropped it back through the hole.
He thought it had stopped burning and had no idea, until he and his
freinds climbed down, that it was smouldering in the roof. When they
looked back they saw the school engulfed in smoke and flames.
Yesterday, he admitted that on July 22 last year, he culpably and
recklessly set fire to the polythene vapour barrier and placed it
through a hole in the roof space, whereby fire took effect.
Four fire engines were called to the scene and, when the wind suddenly
changed, the flames swept the school and burst through the roof. A fire
engine was also damaged by flames and the intense heat.
Mr Matthews told the court that 60% of the school was destroyed. To
demolish and rebuild would cost an estimated #1.2m, although no decision
has yet been taken.
Meanwhile, #150,000 has been spent adapting the rest of the building
for classrooms. He also revealed that damage to contents totalled more
than #200,000.
Defence advocate Gerald Carroll described Duncan as an immature youth,
and added that while he accepted responsibility for what happened he did
not appreciate at the time that his actions would lead to such extensive
damage.
Lord McFadyen decided to call for reports before sentencing him, and
continued his bail until the case comes before him again on July 18, at
the High Court in Edinburgh.
As he walked from court with his mother Duncan said: ''I'm really
sorry to this day for what I did. But I honestly didn't mean it, and had
no idea that such a thing would happen.''

A NEW steam service between Fort William and Mallaig was launched
yesterday with pipes and drums and even a mock battle to mark the
occasion, but the locomotive was only allowed to move one mile along its
45-mile route in case it set the heather on fire.
It was then replaced by a diesel engine which pulled the specially
liveried coaches and their 330 passengers to Mallaig and back.
The train is called The Jacobite to commemorate the 250th anniversary
of Bonnie Prince Charlie's rising and it passes Glenfinnan, where the
Prince raised his standard on August 19, 1745, and Loch nan Uamh where
he first landed on mainland Scotland and from where he was to leave for
ever on September 20, 1746.
The temperature in Fort William was 82 degrees when the train set out
yesterday and Railtrack and the private operators, the West Coast
Railway Company, agreed that the fire risk presented by sparks from the
steam engine was too great.
Earlier this year the steam service faced withdrawal in the
pre-privatisation reorganisation of Scottish rail services.
The train will run Tuesday to Friday until September 22, leaving Fort
William at 10.30am and returning at 4pm. Return tickets #18.

THE Prince of Wales criticised a concrete office block when he
officially opened a #127m regeneration programme in Dundee yesterday.
The Prince, who has often spoken out about modern architecture, remarked
on City House when he unveiled a plaque to mark the completion of the
refurbishment of the city centre area.
Pointing to the 10-storey high office block which towers over an
improved area of the centre, he commented to one bystander: ''What do
you think of that? It's a bit of a shame isn't it?''
The woman pensioner, who declined to be named, said later: ''He asked
me what I thought should be done about it and I said they should knock
it down like they did with the multi-storey flats recently.'' She added:
''He just smiled and nodded his head. He had obviously noticed that
eyesore as well.''
The Prince was confronted with a dragon when he visited a centre for
the homeless. He stopped to ask eight-year-old Ryan McPhail outside the
centre about the primary pupil's favourite toy.
Ryan, who was with his class from Our Lady's Primary when he went to
see the Prince visit the centre, said: ''I told him that it was called
Gumble the dragon and that it was my favourite toy.''
The Prince also revealed to the crowd that he does not play the
National Lottery. He was asked by Mr Jimmy Walsh, 35, and was told
''no''. Mr Walsh told the Prince that he had won two #10 amounts and the
Prince replied: ''You must have the technique.''
A spokesman for London-based Molyneux Estates, which owns the City
House, last night defended the building. He said: 'I suppose Prince
Charles is entitled to his opinion. We're used to it, aren't we?''

COUNCILLORS in Shetland yesterday reprieved two primary schools due
for closure in Britain's most northerly island.
They voted 14-10 to reverse an education committee decision to close
Uyeasound and Haroldswick primaries in the island of Unst (population
950) and bus the 30 pupils to the primary school in the village of
Baltasound on the same island.
Education experts had maintained that amalgamating the three primaries
into a single school was best from an educational point of view and
would also save the cash-strapped islands council #71,000 a year.
Education director Jim Halcrow told the meeting in Lerwick that
amalgamation would allow children to be taught in year classes instead
of in composite classes and make it easier to teach the new 5-14
curriculum.
Unst councillor Mrs Joan Easten, who led the six-week fight against
closure with the school boards and the Unst Community Council, said
there had been no criticism of the schooling the children received
already and the amount of money saved would be ''negligible'' in the
overall education budget.
When news of the decision reached Uyeasound, parents descended on the
classroom with champagne, to celebrate victory for the tiny community of
crofters and fish farmers.
Last night parents and children from both schools were invited to a
celebration beach barbecue.

UNTIL now, Sub Couture has been one of fashion's best-kept secrets.
The name is just beginning to feature in style magazines, although it
has been on the lips of young clubbers here and across Europe for the
past three years. Without hype, Sub Couture's reputation has blossomed.
The reason is a simple dress, produced this season in lilac, jade, and
aqua that is made from heavyweight swimwear Lycra.
Cut in a number of brief, beautifully finished styles, such a dress
not only refuses to bag at the back, but the fabric reacts to heat and
moisture. So even after an energetic half-an-hour on the dance floor it
looks fresh. The idea of using swimwear fabric for dancewear comes from
Debbie Brand, 27, the name behind Sub Couture. Inspired by Azzedine
Alaia and Liza Bruce -- the king and queen of cling -- whom she cites as
her gurus -- Brand set out to make her mark using this cloth in an
idiosyncratic way.
As an ex-model Brand was searching for something new. She wanted
clothes that nestled between the High Street and designer labels. And,
because she couldn't find it, Brand set out to deliver it herself. Grit
and determination took the place of design training and in 1992 the
first Sub Couture dresses were being snapped up for the big night out.
It is a lot cheaper to produce swimwear than tailoring, so Brand
applied a little lateral thinking: why not get swimwear manufacturers to
tailor sophisticated dresses in smooth, stretchy swimwear fabrics? The
current collection is full of styles from slip dresses to Jackie Onassis
shifts and lattice-bustiered pussycat numbers priced from #60 to #100.
It's a philosphy Brand is expanding now to encompass more classic
tailoring for autumn. She has brought in Trevor Harrison -- ex-MaxMara
and Rowland Klein -- to give extra finesse to a line of glamorous
satin-back crepe frock coats and boucle suits with fake beaver collars
which have been inspired by wartime movie stars like Joan Crawford and
Rita Hayworth.
Although she had no training, Debbie Brand has a natural aptitude for
fashion. She studied maths and computer sciences yet ended up modelling
and launching a fashion label. ''I am porous by nature,'' she says by
way of explanation.''
By the mid 1980s she found herself with a problem. She was tall and
rake thin, and couldn't find any clothes to fit. This prompted her to
make her own. Then she found only expensive designer clothes would fit.
''At 16 I was going to Browns (a top London designer store) to look and
copy what they had in there to make up for myself.''
So Sub Couture was born. ''It's not couture, it's sub couture. I'm a
perfectionist . . .'' The French haute couture collections next week
prove there is a market for luxurious quality, but Brand's spin on the
words shows it is possible to produce such polish at High Street prices.
* Sub Couture is available from a selection at Tutti Frutti in
Glasgow, and Stons in Glasgow and Aberdeen.

incinerator to deal with clinical waste at St John's Hospital in West
Lothian.
The board unanimously rejected the plan at a meeting yesterday.
Friends of the Earth Scotland later called for a thorough review of
clinical waste management throughout the country, pointing out that most
incinerators will have to close down in the near future, when new EU
guidelines come into force.
The decision means that waste from Forth Valley and Edinburgh Health
Boards may now go to the municipal waste incinerator at Baldovie in
Dundee -- although another suggestion has been made that the
recently-opened Queen Margaret Hospital in Dunfermline could also deal
with it on a commercial basis.

OKLAHOMA CITY: The Duchess of York yesterday visited survivors of the
April 19 bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City. She began
with a visit to a children's hospital and announced a donation of almost
#100,000 from her Chances for Children foundation to a new child health
care centre in the city, saying that the plight of the chidren rescued
from the blast had prompted her to start a campaign for the new
facility.

FINANCIAL hardship is causing a growing number of students to drop out
of their courses, university chiefs have found.
Lecturers and student leaders said the findings of a survey
commissioned by the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals were
''alarming'' and called on the Government to ease the money pressures on
students.
More than 70 of Britain's 90 universities responded to the CVCP
questionnaire on student hardship and how it affects institutions.
The data shows that about 40,000 students dropped out in the 1992/93
academic session, about 5% of the student population. An increase to
about 15,000 in the numbers quitting because they failed examinations
was in line with a rise in student numbers.
But there was a 30% increase in one year in the 25,000 who left for
''other'' reasons, representing twice the rate of growth in student
numbers.
The CVCP said: ''Although it is not possible to calculate precisely
the importance of financial hardship in a decision to leave, anecdotal
evidence strongly suggests that financial difficulties are responsible
for much of this increase in students leaving courses.''
The deputy principal of the National Union of Students in Scotland, Mr
Keith Robson, said: ''The overall picture is of tens of thousands of
students leaving education or failing to make the grade due to the
hardship they experience.
''Until the Government recognises the problem and adequately supports
students, academic careers will continue to be wasted.''
The survey is the first of its kind and provides some confirmation of
anecdotal evidence that more students are dropping out because they
cannot cope with financial pressures.
Edinburgh University, Scotland's second biggest in terms of student
numbers, will take the survey a stage further next year when it will
interview students about their reasons for dropping out.
Mr Stephen McGee, president of the university's student association,
said: ''The survey backs up what we have found, and I suspect that
things have got worse since 1992.''
Hidden financial pressures also affected ''academic'' drop-out rates
by affecting students' exam performance and their health, he said.
The Association of University Teachers said some students were under
more pressure because of cuts in maintenance grant and problems with
student loans, while they also suffered because they no longer got
housing and unemployment benefits and income support.
The AUT general secretary, Mr David Treisman, said: ''Students go to
university to study. They should not need to work half the week to
survive . . . The investment in a student who leaves is wasted.''
The CVCP survey also confirmed suspicions that the Government-funded
access funds, intended to help students in the worst financial
circumstances, are inadequate. About 30% of applicants for help were
unsuccessful.
Universities must meet the costs of administering the funds
themselves, and this amounted to about 10% of the value of support paid
out.
About one university in four advises students to limit the amount of
part-time work they do to about 10 or 12 hours a week. But the CVCP
said: ''Some universities have regulations forbidding students from
working during term, but increasingly a blind eye is being turned to
those who do.''
In recognition of growing hardship, Aberdeen University has augmented
its annual access fund of #220,000 by more than #500,000 a year but the
Principal, Professor Maxwell Irvine, said it was still not enough.
It is seeking to raise more funds through its quincentenary appeal.
''We are heavily over-subscribed and I believe the situation will get
worse,'' said Professor Irvine.
* Lecturers are to step up a campaign against compulsory redundancies
in further education by demonstrating outside Jewel and Esk college in
Dalkeith today.
And they will be balloted on strike action in the new session
beginning in August unless settlement can be reached.
The college is seeking 21 redundancies to offset the impact of funding
cuts. Eighteen staff have accepted voluntary terms but, to meet its
target, the college has identified three staff for compulsory
redundancy.
Mr Jack Dale, Educational Institute of Scotland assistant secretary
responsible for further and higher education, said yesterday: ''We do
not accept that the finances of the college are so restricted that these
people cannot be retained for a further period.''
The EIS is also in dispute with Falkirk College about the number of
redundancies it is seeking.

AN air of resignation descended on Tory MPs yesterday as the
leadership election manifestos of Mr Major and Mr Redwood descended on
them like a blanket. There is so little between them that the City might
consider restoring sterling and #12 billion to share values.
Along comes young Redwood to rehearse Cabinet policy which he has
helped to draw up. He has stuck some Thatcherite knobs on, which is
attractive to some and the anti-Europeans, like the echo of Thatcher's
''No. No. No.''
However, those on the left who say they will support Mr Major
(although they hanker for a second ballot and a Heseltine intervention)
were reinforced in their view that they did not go to all the trouble of
getting rid of her only to lay out a carpet for her political sibling.
Yesterday's mood indicates that there is a big following for Major on
the left and centre left.
However, these people tell you this with a shrug of the shoulders, as
if to say this is not the kind of contest we want. They are not sure
that, if they dare abstain next Tuesday, it will sufficiently wing the
Prime Minister and force a second ballot.
The centre-right and anti-Euro fanatics speak well of Mr Redwood. They
like his brains and his convictions, but they do not seem to be
canvassing support for him with any air of urgency.
The right are worried too, that, if Mr Major is fatally damaged on
July 4, their bete noir Michael Heseltine, Mr Charisma himself, and
restored darling of their constituency parties, will make his long
awaited move.
Redwood vs. Heseltine would be no contest. This to them means that the
hard-right hero Michael Portillo, with his supposed boyish charm would
have to enter the lists in a second ballot. Where does this get them? --
a split vote and an easier ride for Mr Heseltine.
No, Mr Redwood would have to stand down for Mr Portillo and deliver
his following. There are not many people who would bet on such gallantry
taking place.
Mr Major, in Cannes yesterday, is fighting his campaign at arms'
length. He is taking an obdurate stance on items such as more power to
the European courts, to remind the Euro-sceptics that he is no baby at
the top tables of Europe.
He has warned that he will not bow out from fighting any opponent from
whatever quarter. It is very likely that he means it and that, if
advised by his Cabinet to quit after Tuesday, he would defy them.
This too is a quandary for the Tory MPs on all sides. How many votes
for Mr Redwood and abstentions could break his heart? Calculations are
that it would need about 100 or so to galvanise another Cabinet Minister
into launching a stop-Redwood campaign.
Mr Major tells them that his policies are working and what is required
is unity and patience to gain the political reward. At the same time,
his Ministers moved into a spasm of activity.
Home Secretary Michael Howard yesterday promised to strip away police
bureaucracy to help them combat crime. Environment Secretary John Gummer
published his White Paper targeting more than 1.5 million more
home-owners over the next decade involving the privatisation of council
estates.
Both items are popular throughout Tory ranks and indications that
Thatcherism is not dead in Mr Major. What does Mr Redwood tell us? Well,
he agrees with all that and pretty well everything else the Cabinet he
left on Monday is doing.
However, he has more passion and vigour and altogether a tougher
outlook on restraining Europe and achieving the Holy Grail of both
trenchant tax cuts and reductions in state spending?
How is he going to do this if elected? Why, cutting out waste and
bureaucracy. This raises a hoarse laugh, this old saw, because everybody
knows that cutting waste and bureaucracy is not enough to deliver to
taxpayers what they want.
Mr Redwood promises in ascending order that he would immediately
reject a return to the European exchange rate mechanism, a single
currency, and a diminution of Britain's veto.
This has a macho sound about it and nobody believes that he does not
mean it. However, so far he says nothing about negative equity and the
continuing repossession of homes or mortgage tax relief.
The real electorate wants to hear about these things rather than the
endless jumping at shadows imagined to be falling on Britain from the
tower blocks of the Brussels commission.
Force me to define the way it's going to go on Tuesday and I would
guess that it will be a matter of ''stick with the devil you know''.

THERE could be resignations among Ministers at the Scottish Office if
a summer Cabinet reshuffle sees Stirling MP Michael Forsyth become
Secretary of State for Scotland, an opponent within the Conservative
Party claimed yesterday.
Mrs Susan Bell, the Scottish Tory Reform Group vice-president, said
that she believed the return of the right-winger to St Andrew's House
would be difficult to accept for a number of existing Ministers there.
Did she believe there would be resignations in protest? ''I cannot
pretend to speak on behalf of Hector Monro, Peter Fraser, and James
Douglas-Hamilton, but I believe they will be unable to forget the last
time Michael Forsyth was there,'' she said.
''He burned a lot of bridges which he has still not done nearly enough
to rebuild. In any event, Michael Forsyth as Secretary of State for
Scotland would be a gift to the Labour Party.''
However, one of those named, Home and Health Minister Lord Fraser of
Carmyllie, was scathing last night. ''I don't know where she gets that
from,'' he said. ''Whoever it was, coming in to a post in whatever
circumstances, I would not offer any comment.''
Neither Lord James, nor Sir Hector was available for comment last
night.
Mr Forsyth himself said: ''I don't want to get into all that. That's
up to her. It all strikes me as being rather premature.
''Quite frankly, what we are doing now is fighting to ensure that John
Major remains leader of the Conservative Party.
''I would have thought that when the Prime Minister does come to
reshuffle his Cabinet, it will be up to him to appoint to any post the
person he thinks is best for it on merit.''
Mrs Bell is unhappy about what she believes is a campaign being
orchestrated to make it seem inevitable that Mr Forsyth is heading for
St Andrew's House. ''He is not the sole heir,'' she said.
''There are others there who could serve equally well, some with much
longer experience, such as Lord James Douglas-Hamilton. You cannot lead
without the goodwill of people. Michael Forsyth hardly has a reputation
as a conciliator.
''Under Michael Forsyth last time, we had all-out war in education and
in the health service. When he left, we got things done, not by
rescinding our policies, but by being less confrontational and abrasive
in implementing them.''
Meanwhile, rank-and-file Scottish Tory Party members appear to be
backing John Major, according to officials in Conservative-held
constituencies contacted by The Herald yesterday.
In the Glasgow Eastwood seat, represented by former Scottish Office
Minister Allan Stewart, constituency association chairman Ian Muir said:
''The phone calls we have had coming into the office are totally in
support of John Major. To my knowledge, we have had no calls in support
of John Redwood.''
In Lord James Douglas-Hamilton's Edinburgh West constituency,
association chairman Mrs Jane Slater said that some of the points in Mr
Redwood's manifesto were ''quite interesting''. But she added: ''We
think John Major is outlining the kind of position we would want put
forward on our behalf.
In Kincardine and Deeside, represented by Scottish Office Minister
George Kynoch, constituency agent Mrs Linda Pursley reported
''absolutely total support'' for Mr Major.''
In Scottish Secretary Ian Lang's seat of Galloway and Upper Nithsdale,
agent Ian Mackie said: ''We have been getting a lot of phone calls from
people in the constituency backing John Major.''
Mrs Liz Rixon, agent for Scottish Office Minister Sir Hector Monro's
Dumfries constituency, said: ''Of the people I have spoken to so far, I
would say about 98% are for the Prime Minister.''
* There was never any question of Bill Walker being deselected as MP
for North Tayside for backing John Redwood's campaign, his constituency
chairman Mr Michael Macphail said yesterday.

A SPIRITED John Major last night predicted victory over Cabinet
''malcontent'' John Redwood in the first ballot for the Tory leadership
and spoke of his vision of Britain's living standards being doubled
within 20 years.
Flanked by Douglas Hurd, Foreign Secretary, and Chancellor Kenneth
Clarke, the Prime Minister denied he had asked for any loyalty oath from
members of his Government or Cabinet.
''I have put no impediment in anyone's way,'' he declared, ''except
myself. I am the only impediment.''
Mr Major emerged late yesterday smiling and cracking jokes after two
days of what he called ''crisp speaking'' with EU leaders at the summit
on the Cote d'Azur.
''Elections are fun,'' he told reporters. ''Brighten up.''
Mr Major claimed successes at Cannes which should play well with
supporters of his ''distinctive'' policy on Europe. He prolonged a
bruising debate over dinner late on Monday by resisting proposed new
powers for the European Court of Justice in security affairs.
Mr Clarke, tipped as a possible candidate in any second leadership
ballot, dodged questions about declaring himself as a contender,
preferring to attack Mr Redwood.
''The Cabinet has been badly damaged by this speculation,'' Mr Clarke
said, ''because it undermines its authority. It is rather surprising
that a member of the Cabinet has declared himself a candidate. It is
quite clear that no other member of the Cabinet agrees with Mr Redwood's
decision.''
Mr Major dismissed the Redwood election manifesto set out yesterday
saying he had ''glanced at it'' and found a great deal which was
familiar. ''I will glance at it more carefully in the next day or so,''
he smiled.
He brushed aside Baroness Thatcher's ambiguous comments on the
leadership issue and denied he had asked anyone for a pledge of loyalty.
Doubling living standards was a worthwhile aim, he said. His policies
would achieve this transformation. ''We have not had this prospect
before,'' he said, quoting a stream of economic statistics and claiming
Britain had been first out of the worldwide recession because his brand
of Toryism was working.
''We won't turn turtle on policies which put us on stream to double
living standards in 20 years,'' he pledged.
Mr Major returned to his attack on Mr Redwood's ''borrowed'' ideas for
future Tory policies. ''He sat there in Cabinet and contributed to
policy development,'' Mr Major said. ''It would be quite extraordinary
if he sat there and did not agree with the policies we had all
developed.''
He said he now understood Mr Redwood was advocating greater individual
freedom. ''How many times have you heard me say this?'' the Prime
Minister asked, presenting himself as the Tory who had cut unnecessary
bureaucracy.
Laying out his manifesto in Cannes and in a newspaper article Mr Major
said:
''I believe it is vital that we unite as a party and focus our guns on
the huge policy gulf that still lies between us and Labour. I intend to
be the man who does that.
My policy agenda is built on enduring Conservative principles --
principles I have believed in and campaigned on all my life. We have
achieved a lot over the last few years. Yet we still have more to do.
''I want a country in which every person, every family, has more power
and choice over their own lives. A country in which people feel safe,
feel secure, feel they can pass on more of their inheritance to their
children.
''First and foremost that means a low tax, enterprise economy. To
create a climate in which people can save, manufacturing industry can
grow and successful enterprise can create jobs for the future.''

THE Provost of Hamilton is set to resign over an allegation that he
voted against the Labour-controlled district council group leader's
selection to stand for a new shadow authority -- after nominating him
for selection.
The latest episode of party in-fighting will be seen as a further
embarrassment for Labour in Lanarkshire after the Black report which
raised serious concerns earlier this month over the running of Monklands
District Council.
It is claimed that Provost Sam Casserly nominated Labour group leader
Councillor Tom McCabe as Labour's candidate for election to a seat on
the new South Lanarkshire authority.
However, it is alleged the provost proceeded to vote for Strathclyde
regional councillor Jackie Burns, who was vying with Councillor McCabe
to represent Labour in the Larkhall ward of the new authority.
Councillor McCabe was selected by four votes in a secret ballot of
Labour group members and won the actual election on April 6. He was in
London yesterday and was not available for comment.
Provost Casserly confirmed yesterday that he would tender his
resignation on Friday at a special meeting of the district council. He
said there was no suggestion of any impropriety. However, he declined to
comment further on the matter, and would only say: ''I am preparing a
statement which I will present to the district council.''
A council spokeswoman said: ''This is a political matter and is not a
matter for the district council.''
A source within the local authority said: ''As far as I know, Provost
Casserly is just resigning to keep the peace. It has not been proved
beyond doubt that he voted against Councillor McCabe. But he insisted
that he would step down if that is what the majority of the Labour group
demands.''
Provost Casserly's resignation could go some way to appeasing the
estimated 10 of the 15 Labour district councillors who are said to have
been ''appalled by his actions'' and called for him to step down.
However, the undoubted friction left in the wake of his resignation is
unlikely to abate. Provost Casserly intends to remain as convener elect
of the South Lanarkshire authority, while Councillor McCabe will be
leader of the Labour-controlled council.
It is expected that the deputy provost, Councillor Bobby Newberry,
will replace Provost Casserly in Hamilton.
A spokesman for the Scottish Labour Party in Glasgow said it had not
been notified of any problems within the operation of the Hamilton
District Council Labour group.
''There have been no suggestions that any party rules have been
contravened or that there was anything improper in the conduct of the
selection process,'' he said. ''It is not therefore appropriate that we
should become involved.''
Councillor Margaret Mitchell, leader of the two-strong Tory group,
said she was not aware of the circumstances of the provost's
resignation, but added: ''I would have thought in any democracy you vote
for the person you think is going to do the best job.
''If that was the case in South Lanarkshire, Provost Casserly should
have been free to vote for the best possible candidate without having
any fear of retribution.''

LEADING politicians on Glasgow City Council, the largest of the new
unitary authorities, are to pay themselves #24,000 a year, plus
expenses, in a package approved yesterday.
A councillor's basic allowance varies between #5000 and #6000
according to the size of the new authority. The bonus for leading
councillors comes through an upgrading in the Government-approved
formula for ''responsibility payments''.
These payments go to those holding key political positions in each
council and are on top of their basic allowances.
Councillor Bob Gould, the leader of the new Glasgow City Council, will
qualify for #18,000 as special payment. Councillor Jean McFadden will
collect a similar bonus as the council convener.
Five other Labour councillors in the city will collect total pay
packets of #19,500 each. They are: Councillors Gordon Macdiarmid (depute
leader); James McCarron (housing convener); Des McNulty (Labour group
secretary); Mary Beckett (social work convener); and Dr Malcolm Green
(education convener).
The new council yesterday agreed a long list of special payments
dwindling right down to a token #2400 for vice-chairs of minor
committees.
A total of 57 of the Labour group's 77 members qualified for a slice
of the year's #363,000 share out.
The sole, non-Labour recipient was Councillor John Young. He received
#5400 extra for filling the role as leader of the three-member Tory
opposition.
Councillor Gould reminded yesterday's meeting that the actual sums
were in line with a formula agreed between the Scottish Office and
Cosla.

after a sheriff heard that officers ''went over the top'' when they
arrested him. Sheriff Brian Kearney was told how Mr John Linton had been
in the Barge pub in Garthamlock, Glasgow, in July 1989 when a fight
spilled outside and developed into a riot. Mr Linton had gone outside to
watch when two constables came up behind him.
In a written judgment from Glasgow Sheriff Court, Sheriff Kearney
found that the two officers knocked Mr Linton's legs from under him so
that he fell on to concrete injuring his nose. The sheriff also found
that the two officers had handcuffed Mr Linton's hands behind his back,
dragged and carried him 20ft letting his face scrape along the ground,
grabbed him by the ankles and arms and heaved him face down into a van,
pushed his nose and face to the floor with boots on his neck, and kicked
him in the ribs.
Mr Linton, of Otterswick Place, Craigend, Glasgow, was taken to
Easterhouse police station by the two officers, Constable Allan
MacMillan and Constable Gordon Alexander, and charged with assaulting
another officer, breach of the peace, attempting to rescue a man from
custody, and butting Constable MacMillan.
Mr Linton was locked in a cell but collapsed unconscious and was taken
to hospital. He was later acquitted of all charges except the butting
assault and raised an action against Strathclyde's chief constable for
damages.

A HOME Office review of the role of the police has listed a series of
tasks which outside firms could handle, but has stopped short of
recommending wholesale privatisation.
Among these duties are the escorting of wide loads on motorways, the
control of stray dogs, tackling noise pollution, delivering court
summonses, and escorting illegal immigrants.
The Police Core and Ancillary Tasks review, commissioned by Home
Secretary Michael Howard, also recommended that police made greater use
of their telephones when investigating crimes, a move which could draw
criticism for reducing contact with crime victims.
Mr Howard's writ does not run to Scotland, but his review will be
studied by the Scottish Office. It will decide in about six months where
it can be applied to the distinctive requirements of the different
Scottish system of policing and different legal system.
Scottish Police Federation general secretary Douglas Keil said
yesterday: ''I am very pleased that the report has confirmed the
federation's view that there is no scope for the police to withdraw from
large areas of current police work and for that work to be transferred
to the private sector. I hope the Government listens to its own review
group and accepts that the police service is not a candidate for
privatisation.''
Mr Howard, launching the review, said he wanted to ''maintain the
human and humane face of British policing'', and added: ''There is no
scope for the police to withdraw from any major area of work.''
The review's aim was to identify policing activities which could be
transferred to other bodies to allow officers more time to fight crime.
Mr Howard said: ''We spend over #6000m on the police every year . . .
I wanted to make sure that the money was being spent on the tasks that
people want the police to carry out -- catching criminals and protecting
the community.''
The review lists 26 proposals covering a wide range of tasks, the vast
majority of which would be handed over to local authorities.
On crime prevention, the review recommends greater civilian
involvement and also calls for consideration of moves to make it a legal
obligation to include crime prevention measures in the development of
new housing.

TOKYO: A song praising the guru of Japan's doomsday cult suddenly went
on the air in two Tokyo subway stations, unnerving commuters. The song
started ''Shoko, Shoko'', repeating the first name of guru Shoko
Asahara, indicted earlier this month on murder charges in connection
with the nerve gas attacks on the Tokyo subway which killed 11 people
and injured 5500. A spokeswoman said subway operators suspected a

VILLAGERS who have been campaigning for a by-pass for 30 years
yesterday took to the street and stopped more than a mile of traffic.
Schoolchildren, pensioners, and the local minister waving 30mph signs
were among residents of Eaglesham who lined the busy B764, which links
the M74 and A77, in the hour-long protest. Tankers, cars,and lorries,
which the protesters claim speed through their main street -- sometimes
three abreast -- were halted and several vehicles turned back.
Eaglesham, one of Scotland's first designated conservation villages,
contains 25 listed buildings and a nursery school lines the road which
carries up to 1200 vehicles per hour at peak times. In 1992, the
Scottish Office identified the need to by-pass Eaglesham, Busby, and
Eastwood. Residents claim that Eastwood District Council has
subsequently blocked plans to build the road.
Mrs Edith Wallace, one of the protesters, said: ''We have got what
amounts to a motorway going through a conservation area. We need a new
road and something done about the speed of traffic.'' Another villager
said: ''When you open the door in the morning, the first thing you get
is a mouthful of traffic fumes, and in some rooms in the house the
vibrations make conversation impossible.''

THE Tory leadership election is causing ''despair and disgust,'' said
Mr Tony Blair somewhat sanctimoniously yesterday. He was thinking of the
British people, but it certainly applies to the Conservative MPs.
Back benchers wanting rid of Mr Major but appalled at the thought of
getting Mr Heseltine are grappling with the tactics needed to dispose of
one and avoid the other. Others, wanting rid of Mr Major but appalled at
the thought of boosting Mr Redwood, are pondering lemming-like mass
abstentions. If all the backstairs plotting misfires, the Tory Party
would be led next week by Mr Abstention, about whom nothing much is
known except that he is preferable to any of the better-known
possibilities.
In the Commons Chamber, though, the Tories tried to close ranks and
served up questions inviting Mr Tony Newton, Leader of the House, to
admit that Government policies on just about everything were absolutely
wonderful.
In the face of cheerful derision from the massed Labour ranks much
enjoying the spectacle of their opponents in convulsions, Mr Newton did
his best.
His usual explanation of why he was standing in -- ''My Right
Honourable Friend is in Cannes,'' got a laugh, perhaps conjuring up
visions of Mr Major with his bucket and spade, idling on the beach after
his fellow leaders had thoughtfully stripped their agenda of anything
that could embarrass him. ''We all go through it sometime, John.''
''Gee, thanks, Jacques.''
Mr Blair declared that Labour was in touch with the nation and ready
to serve. Mr Newton reminded him that the nation returned the
Conservative Party to power in 1992, not just John Major.
Sir David Steel also suggested that the Tories had lost ''any
lingering claim to govern the country.'' However, he described himself
as ''an innocent bystander'' and was smashed off the court by Mr Newton
who told him: ''I'm not sure about innocence but you are certainly a
bystander.'' A few more like that and they would be urging the modest
Commons Leader to stand in the second ballot.
Attempting to continue the serving of gentle lobs for him to put away,
Dr Robert Spinke (Castle Point) asked him to praise the Tory policy of
offering ''choice and diversity''. The current choice being offered from
a diversity of political leaders was far from his innocent mind but
Labour roared like louts turning a polite observation into a naughty
double entendre.
Was not the Cabinet ''well rid'' of Mr Redwood, demanded Mr Hugh
Bayley (York -- Lab.) a question calling for careful handling. Mr Newton
is a dedicated Majorite, indeed a personal friend, but one cannot simply
rubbish a man you have previously praised at constituency chicken
dinners in Wales or Wokingham.
Stepping neatly between condemnation and unconvincing fake praise, Mr
Newton chose ''puzzlement.'' He was puzzled, he said, about why Mr
Redwood had left the team. A perfectly good choice, although we all know
that Mr Newton is not really puzzled. Mr Redwood left because he thinks
Mr Major is not a very good Prime Minister and that he would be a better
one.
The line from the session, though, which should have cast a chill over
Tories of all tendencies was Mr Blair's dismissive reference to their
party's ''warring factions.''
How often in the past half-century has that taunt been hurled at
Labour from the Tory benches, how truly and with what dire effect at
elections?
Now it can be thrown back in the Tory teeth by a Labour Party better
disciplined through the aftermath of four lost elections. Whether Mr
Major stays or goes, they reckon the next election will bring sweet
revenge.

GLASGOW councillors yesterday gave the go-ahead for a #170m
redevelopment of the former Glasgow Garden Festival site ending years of
uncertainty over the future of the prime Clydeside location.
Miller Developments has been given outline planning permission to
build a leisure and business complex, including a national science
centre and millennium tower.
The council's decision will significantly improve the prospects of the
43-acre site being brought back into use. It has been empty since the
festival finished in 1988 and a number of competing projects have been
proposed for its future.
A spokesman for Miller Developments said the decision was a milestone
in the transformation of the once derelict site. ''We expect to start
work on site later this year and expect to have the first leisure phase
open for business in 12 months,'' he said.
''We are confident that rapid progress can be made and aim to have
developed the entire site by the millennium, creating 2000 jobs in the
process and delivering a development of which Glasgow can be proud.''
The #90m science centre and millennium tower part of the Pacific Quay
development is being handled by the Glasgow Development Agency. The
Millennium Commission has recently given A listing status to funding
proposals for the project.
Mr Stuart Gulliver, chief executive of the GDA, said the project would
provide a major economic boost for Glasgow and Govan in particular.

IF a slogan, a logo, and a promise to save the royal yacht were the
only qualifications necessary to be leader of the Tory Party, then step
forward Prime Minister Redwood. The second day of the Vote Vulcan
campaign produced all three, but little else: John Redwood still looks
and sounds like an unelectable alien.
Mr Redwood's team passed around a sheet of paper with ''The John
Redwood Campaign'' arcing in a grey rainbow across the top. Information
Sheet no.1 -- shades of a military communique -- offered details of the
campaign's headquarters above the slogan ''No change means no chance'',
an unsubtle reminder to wavering MPs of the other election expected in
18 months.
The inmates of Broadmoor -- one of the few printable descriptions
offered by the Major camp for the Euro-sceptic MPs who are backing Mr
Redwood -- were replaced on the platform yesterday by unfamiliar and
uninteresting MPs in sober colours, designed to reassure.
Buoyed by the success of his earlier forays into human humour,
Candidate Redwood -- dark suit, red stripe down his nose -- prefaced his
policy statement with a joke. Those wondering how Tory MPs will vote
might like to know that ''so far all those intending to vote are voting
for John''. Silence.
His list of solutions for Britain stretched to 69 lines. The overall
effect was of a pasteurised policy, dreamt up in Happy Land, where money
is free, everyone agrees, and controversy is best left to nasty
extremists.
''We should reinforce our policies to deal with crime; Everyone living
rough on the streets should be offered a hostel place or given suitable
help; The disabled and the elderly often need more help with cleaning
and shopping rather than another assessment meeting,'' he said.
Europe was the predictable centrepiece, but the only subject on which
Mr Redwood made an unequivocal commitment -- besides promising lots more
closed-circuit television cameras in our city centres -- was safely
minor: ''Tories keep royal yachts not scrap them''. Few will care and
the Queen can't vote.
The statement was delivered in a range of voices, from harsh -- on
crime -- to soft -- on the poor -- to firm -- on defence, as if prove he
can offer more than just the Major monotone.
The experimental voice and forced humour did little to dispel Mr
Redwood's apparently unshakeable tag as the only Vulcan Toryhis
solutions sounded just like Mr Spock coming up with a last-ditch wheeze
to save the Starship Enterprise from attacking aliens.
Avoiding difficult spending cuts? ''I have worked on a device for
dealing with that''. Fending off the encroachment of the European Court
of Justice? ''There are a number of devices which I think could work''.
As if a tricorder and some dilithium crystals will save the Tories.
Mr Redwood said in his statement:
''May 4 showed we should listen and learn from the electorate. I
disagree with John Major's statement in this leadership election that
there is no need for any change of policy.
''The Conservative Party is the party of low taxation or it is
nothing. We stormed the country with that message at three General
Elections and won a fourth term despite the odds on the same platform.
It is time to deliver.
''The immediate task of the new administration will be to tighten up
on the waste and unnecessary expenditure that is still apparent in the
#303 billion budget of local and national government.
''We should clarify our policy on Europe. The Government's stated
position has been rightly based on the idea that we should trade in
Europe and co-operate with our friends and partners, but not build the
superstructure of a superstate.''

HADRIAN'S Wall, that ancient symbol of national division, could become
a bridge linking conservational strategies and a vast tourist expansion
between Scotland and England, under a 30-year heritage initiative
launched yesterday.
The Hadrian's Wall Military Zone Management Plan will promote the
73-mile, 1873-year-old ruin as a single tourist site and offer
environmental protection to areas surrounding the wall.
It hopes to capitalise on the wall's designation as a World Heritage
Site by Unesco in 1987, ranking it alongside the Taj Mahal and the
Kremlin as a place of outstanding historical importance.
The strategy, launched by English Heritage, encompasses the Solway
Firth strip of Dumfries and Galloway, from Gretna to Annan.
At the launch, Mr Jocelyn Stevens, chairman of English Heritage, said:
''The plan defines, for the first time, the full extent of the World
Heritage Site, and examines the implications this may have for
planning.''
Director of the wall Dr Christopher Young said the strategy would ease
applications for European and National Lottery funds.

Malcolm Dickson points to weaknesses in the constitution that the Tory
crisis has exposed
JOHN REDWOOD'S claim that John Major's resignation had left the
Conservative Party in limbo begs a wider question about whether
government, and indeed the democratic process, itself are not also in
limbo.
Opposition politicians have rightly posed the question: ''Who is
running the country?'' The Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons, Dame
Janet Fookes, answered this last Thursday by drawing attention to the
fact that John Major had not resigned as Prime Minister; the offices of
leader of the Conservative Party and that of Prime Minister were
separate.
However, this is a demonstration of the difficulty that can be caused
by the unwritten constitution of the UK. It is not simply the case that
the two offices of party leader and Prime Minister are separate. In our
evolution to a democratic party system, the latter has become dependent
on the former.
After a General Election, the monarch by convention invites the leader
of the largest single party in the Commons to form a Government. Holding
the office of leader of a party is thus fundamental to achieving the
second appointment of Prime Minister.
The events of the last few days also show the weakness of a party
system which is supposed to function on the principle of a party
presenting a clear manifesto to the electorate at a General Election. If
John Redwood, or indeed any other alternative to John Major, were to win
the leadership contest then the country would see a change in manifesto
without consultation.
In fact, consultation would only extend to the parliamentary
Conservative Party, and not to Parliament itself. This is in total
contrast to the supposed centrality of parliamentary sovereignty that
the right of the Conservative Party holds so dear. It seems there is one
set of rules for certain circumstances, and an alternative for different
circumstances.
John Major's actions remain unprecedented. In 1990, when Mrs Thatcher
was challenged, she initially remained both leader of the Conservative
Party and Prime Minister until resigning both offices. Indeed all
previous Prime Ministerial resignations involved the resignation of both
offices.
It could then be argued that John Major's actions are the most
undemocratic seen in the history of UK government. He retains the
highest political office in the land -- while stepping away from the
very office that democratically put him there.
Of course, the business of government does go on, despite the
uncertainty. It is not the case that government is in limbo, although
major policy initiatives certainly are.
On a day-to-day basis, a week is not a long time in politics, as far
as the functioning of government is concerned. It has a momentum of its
own. Ironically, many of the reforms that recent Conservative
governments have achieved in the machinery of government have made
pilotless government easier to achieve.
Reforms within the Civil Service through programmes such as ''Next
Steps'' have pushed many government functions into semi-autonomous
agencies with their own decision-making structure. This 'quangocracy'
clouds the lines of accountability.
Are Ministers then an irrelevance to the actual day-to-day workings of
government? A Minister simply cannot oversee every day-to-day aspect of
the running of his or her department. Many policy decisions are taken by
officials, the Minister alone, or a small Cabinet sub-committee rather
than the full Cabinet itself.
This was clearly in evidence when Michael Heseltine resigned as
Defence Secretary in January, 1986, when confronted with Mrs Thatcher's
decision not to have the Westland Helicopter takeover discussed in full
Cabinet. What the Westland affair also demonstrated, was how much
government was keen to keep a grip on civil servants. The Commons
Defence Select Committee was denied the right to question certain
officials in their inquiry into the affair.
The Westland affair showed that the relationship between a
policy-making elected government and an appointed Civil Service
bureaucracy is an uneasy one. The business of policy-making by its very
nature must involve knowledge of the feasibilty of implementation. This
gives considerable power to Civil Service officials. John Redwood's
policy statements made yesterday do not have that backing.
The idea then that the whole direction of government policy can be
changed by as little as 180 or so MPs cannot be good for our democratic
well-being. While the day-to-day business of government functioning may
not be much affected by this leadership contest, the process sends out
political signals about the sometimes precarious nature of UK politics
and government which does not serve our interests at home, or abroad.
It further points to the fundamental weakness of our current
constitutional arrangements that allow one governing party, and indeed
one individual in the shape of the Prime Minister, to make decisions
about the make-up of our government, and the timing of general
elections, at will.
Lord Hailsham, in the mid-1970s, referred to our governmental
arrangements as approaching an ''elected dictatorship''. He quickly
back-tracked on this when his party won power in 1979. Power, it seems,
makes a difference.
And if the power of parliamentary sovereignty is, as it seems, so
crucial to this campaign, then it is only right that Parliament as a
whole should give its verdict.
What is problematic is that our democracy is no longer parliamentary
government, but one-party majority government, whichever party that may
be. If changes in our constitution warrant a referendum, as Mr Redwood
has said, then surely changes in the make-up of our government should
also go to the people's verdict in a General Election.

DESPITE the campaign hype, there are many similarities in the Major
and Redwood policy plans published yesterday. They enable clear
comparisons to be made between what the challenger advocates and where
the Prime Minister stands.
Europe:
Major -- Despite calling himself the ''biggest Euro-sceptic,'' John
Major refuses to commit himself one way or the other on a single
European currency. He says the time to choose will be when more is known
about how it will work, perhaps some time in the life of the next
Parliament. He has hinted that he might support a referendum if the
Cabinet decided to go for a single currency.
Redwood -- Refuses to abolish the pound because a single currency
would transfer many economic powers from Parliament to European
institutions. He seeks to reduce the powers of the European Court which
makes laws for the UK without reference to Parliament. He would
repatriate powers from Europe to national and local governments and
believes any proposals to give fresh powers to Europe should require
referenda.
Spending and Tax:
Major -- Wants to cut the standard rate of income tax to 20p. First
reduce then abolish inheritance tax. Lays great stress on keeping
inflation down with the current long term target 2.5%. Plans to bring
public spending below 40% of GDP. But has promised to increase nursery
education spending and raise health spending every year. Has in the
Parliament increased the tax burden and cut mortgage tax relief.
Redwood -- Would curb waste and unnecessary spending in both national
and local government budgets. Staff levels, consultancies, quangos,
regulation must all be looked at ''with fresh eyes''. A freeze on
staffing in most areas of government. But the armed forces must be kept
strong and more medical staff recruited. Savings should be spent
supporting ''the traditional family'', prudent pensioners and small
business through tax cuts.
Health:
Major -- Has presided over major reforms such as trust hospitals, GP
fundholding, and a drive for value for money.
Redwood -- Supports the reforms but wants to cut back on the
bureaucracy created and more frontline staff recruited. Would leave many
hospital closure decisions to patients and staff. rather than
''administrators trying to create monopolies.''
Social Policy:
Major -- Has made substantial changes in the social security budget
recasting incapacity, unemployment and housing benefit and his
Government launched the Child Support Agency. Considering tax breaks to
help people insure for care in old age. New flexibility in pensions
which could be drawn on early in the case of sickness or unemployment.
Redwood -- Has criticised benefits aiding single parents more than the
traditional family and would reform benefits to favour it. Those living
rough on the streets should be offered hostel accommodation or help.
More practical help for the disabled and elderly -- with cleaning,
shopping, to stay at home as long as possible etc -- and less paper
work. New housing association properties should be let with the right to
buy.
Education:
Major -- Has slimmed the national curriculum and championed
grant-maintained schools; is supporting nursery education vouchers and
more competitive sport in schools. May give parents and governors power
to set up new state ''charter'' schools with maximum local independence.
Redwood -- Advocates extra funds to enable popular schools to expand
their buildings to take more pupils. Wants all schools to set targets
for examination pass rates.
Industry:
Major -- Possible changes in capital gains tax to encourage people to
invest long term in British companies. Plans to privatise railways and
the nuclear industry.
Redwood -- Backs privatisation and wants more competition in the
English water industry and probably, though not stated, the Scottish one
too.
Defence etc:
Major -- Having slimmed the armed forces, has promised there will be
no more frontline cuts.
Redwood -- No more regiments should go. The reserves should be
strengthened. The royal yacht should be kept.
Crime:
Major -- Tougher powers to reverse over lenient fines and sentences on
violent criminals. Claims that a continuing policy of anti-crime
measures is beginning to have effect.
Redwood -- Police should be able to use alternatives to the Crown
Prosecution Service in courts. More concern for the victims of crime
less for ''so-called victims of the criminal justice system''. Extend
closed circuit TV to more areas.
The Union;
Major -- Made defence of the status quo a linchpin of his last
election campaign. Initiated the Taking Stock proposals to handle more
Scottish Commons business in Scotland. Willing to look at further
proposals if they do not damage the Union. An architect of the peace
process in Northern Ireland.
Redwood -- Opposes ''new Assemblies and Parliaments''. The kingdom
should remain united. Stands by Major's Northern Ireland policy.

A JUDGE yesterday took the exceptional step of granting a perpetual
court order banning parents from any future contact with their daughter.
The interdict granted by Lord Johnston was the latest development in a
bitter legal dispute between Georgina Robertson, 22, and her mother and
father.
In November last year, when Georgina was in hospital suffering from an
eating disorder, her parents, James and Maria Robertson, of Woodhill
Farmhouse, Oldmeldrum, Aberdeenshire, feared she was starving herself to
death.
They were granted an order at the Court of Session appointing them as
tutors in law to their daughter, which gave them the power to instruct
medical treatment in their daughter's best interests.
Lord Abernethy was told that Georgina had a history of mental illness,
had made several suicide attempts, and was trying to kill herself by
starvation.
The court heard that she weighed less than four stones, was drifting
in and out of lucidity, and might lapse into a coma at any time.
It was alleged that Georgina's involvement with the Jehovah's
Witnesses from the age of 17 had driven a wedge between her and her
parents and that she was suffering from a mental condition, which made
it impossible for her to make rational decisions about her treatment.
The following day Lord Prosser overturned the order which had given
the parents the right to control their daughter's medical treatment.
He was provided with information which had not been before Lord
Abernethy, that Georgina was being drip fed and that her life was not in
any immediate danger.
The judge was also told that she had particularly requested that her
parents, with whom she had a particularly difficult relationship, should
not be involved in her medical care.
Georgina, who is still in hospital, also complained that her parents
had disowned her on a number of occasions and had harangued her about
her religious beliefs.
Yesterday, Mr Robert McCreadie asked Lord Johnston to take the unusual
step of granting a permanent order banning Georgina's parents from ever
approaching her, visiting her in hospital, or intefering with her
affairs against her wishes.
The judge said he was being asked to grant an order which would
permanently separate a child from its parents and once a permanent
interdict was granted it was not possible to come back to the court to
have it lifted.
Mr McCreadie pointed out that the ''child'' was 22 years old and
added: ''This is a woman who has expressed her own views as to how she
wants to live.''
Lord Johnston said the court order provided a shield and, if by some
miracle, the relationship between Georgina and her parents improved in
the future, she might not need the protection provided by the court
order.
Mr Paul Arthurson, for the parents, informed the court that they were
not opposing the order sought by their daughter. They felt that they had
taken matters as far as they could through the courts.
''They have really reached the end of their tether and their wits'
end.''
The judge said that the odd thing about the case was that there was no
opposition to the request for interdict.
He granted an order which interdicts Mr and Mrs Robertson from
approaching their daughter, visiting her in hospital, verbally abusing
her or placing her in a state of fear and distress, or from interfering
with her affairs against her express wishes.
Yesterday speaking at her home, Mrs Robertson said she and her husband
would abide by the terms of the interdict.
However, she added: ''I am broken-hearted, but I am not suprised.
Nothing Georgina does surprises me any more. It is her decision, not
ours. I am not going to take any steps to change it.
''If she ever wanted us or needed our help or support in any way, we
are here for her. But due to her past record, the interdict would have
to be lifted otherwise I could find myself in contempt.''

William Russell indulges in a guessing game about how the leadership
contest will develop if the champions of the right and left emerge
THE Tale of Two Johns now unfolding so dramatically is not the story
we expected to be reading.
As Harold Wilson wisely said, a week is a long time in politics.
Everyone who was anybody running through the list of likely stalking
horses after King John threw down his gauntlet failed to spot John, the
Young Pretender, Redwood lurking in the shrubbery, a smiler with a
knife, poised to strike.
So who knows who will emerge from the woodwork in the days to come?
Will the Young Pretender succeed in winning the throne? Or will he
simply open the way for others to grasp the crown? King Michael, King
Ken, King Kong? After all, nobody spotted Queen Margaret either. It is a
bit like playing fantasy football.
So what hurdles must one of the two Johns overcome to win round one of
the leadership battle and presumably stop the Tory rot?
To win outright, either John must scale Hurdle 1 -- he must get an
absolute majority, not just of those voting, but of all the 328 Tory MPs
entitled to vote, that is 165 votes.
But there is also Hurdle 2 to come.
His majority over his nearest rival must also be 15% of those entitled
to vote, which makes the minimum winning margin 50 votes. One vote in
this election is not enough.
In other words, what the Tories have embarked upon is a psephologist's
minefield and the task of the two Johns' supporters as they try to
navigate it is rendered all the trickier because there are no accurate
charts. The electors being canvassed will lie in their teeth, giving
pledges of loyalty with their right and left hands, while doing whatever
suits their interests best on the day. The maps to this minefield cannot
be trusted.
On July 4, King John's hope is that he will win outright in round one,
despatching Young Pretender John back to obscurity, although not the
obscurity from which he came -- the principality of Wales -- because his
Cabinet career is over for as long as Mr Major is making the
appointments.
Had the stalking horse been one of the loony right, King John's gamble
in calling the contest early might have paid off. However, Mr Redwood is
a heavyweight right-winger, whose intellectual achievements are
formidable.
The scenario then is that Pretender John, with the help of his
supporters and those who abstain, will fatally wound King John in round
one. King John will then retire from the lists.
On July 11, round two takes place without him, which is what happened
last time when Queen Margaret was prevailed upon not to risk humiliation
at the hands of her footsoldiers. However, King John is made of
different stuff, as she reminds us from time to time, and might just
decide to take on all-comers. After all Queen Margaret won, but not by
the necessary margin.
Let us assume, though, that King John has left the field, because it
is the only decent thing to do. Young Pretender John must decide whether
to stand again. But is he really the darling of the Euro-sceptic right?
Or will Crown Prince Michael Portillo tell him to get lost, it was
sneaky to do what he did, and raise the right's standard himself?
Will Young Pretender John, having got this far, let him?
Will the Old Pretender, Michael of the Golden Hair now turning Grey,
the Sean Connery of British politics, actually past it but still
politically sexy, enter the lists? He has in the past, and played the
role of regicide when Queen Margaret was defenestrated. He has not been
disloyal to King John, and will have allowed him to fight round one with
his full suppport. Why, after all, should a chap stop someone intent on
a suicide mission when the outcome of that mission will suit a chap very
well?
If the Young Pretender and Prince Portillo both enter the lists and
effectively spike one another's guns, the Old Pretender could win by
default, which is not what the Euro-sceptics want. There is, however,
everything to be said for the Tory left and all those with marginal
constituencies letting the Old Pretender stand.
He is a favourite with the constituency parties, his hands are clean
of this latest murder, he is charismatic, has vision, and while the
Euro-philes will trust him, he is so anxious to get the job he may well
toss some carrots to the Euro-sceptics which could persuade them that he
is at least a devil they know.
Not all on the right will prove apostates, but enough might to suit
his purpose. However, he still has to overcome those election rule
hurdles. As for the rest of the left, Prince Ken of the Hush Puppies
looks like standing by.
If it proves to be King Michael, he can afford to wait as Heir
Apparent, although if it turns out to be a short reign, like that of
King Callaghan, which was terminated by the electorate, he could have
inheritance problems.
However, let us suppose the unthinkable. Round two is also deadlocked.
The Old Pretender fails and must retire from the fray, partly because it
is the only decent thing to do, partly because, if he cannot persuade
the parliamentary party to back him the second time around he is never
going to do so.
Which brings us to:
July 13, round three. By this time either Prince Portillo or Young
Pretender John will be the right's only man. The left's man, though
could be pretty well anybody. Prince Ken may stand, but he is anathema
to the right. Now is the time for the Great Conciliator to emerge. There
is no shortage of candidates.
Ian Lang, Secretary of State for Scotland, is much admired south of
the Border, and the fact that he is a chum of the deposed King John will
not be held against him. He has style, ablity, hands that are spotlessly
clean, is young, and makes Tony Blair look like a wimp.
There is also the Great Conciliatrix herself, the Education Secretary,
Gillian Shephard, who will have lost no time bustling on the scene
mouthing wise words like Nanny Knows Best.
The question is, should we have to abide by the result? If it was a
trade union deciding who should be Prime Minister think what the Tory
right would be saying. Enoch Powell pointed out yesterday how
unconstitutional it was for King John to vacate the party throne while
stubbornly staying seated on the Downing Street one. After all it is we,
the electorate, who put him there, not the Tory MPs. In the light of all
that, round four is inevitable.
Sooner rather than later comes a General Election, and the coronation
of King Tony.

<HEADLINE>Breakaway union for nurses launched. Federation of Nursing in Scotland says it is prepared to negotiate on local pay.</HEADLINE>

A NEW trade union for nurses launched yesterday is ready to negotiate
with NHS Trusts on local pay, according to its founders.
The Independent Federation of Nursing in Scotland claims to have 100
members so far, mainly in the Glasgow, Lanarkshire, and Argyll and Clyde
areas.
The new rival to the Royal College of Nursing and Unison has emerged
in the midst of the most serious dispute between health workers and the
Government since the early 1980s.
The federation said that industrial action was neither ruled in or
out, but should be used only as a last resort. The IFN would be
non-political and would not be affiliated to the Scottish TUC.
Former RCN and Unison activists were among the panel of office-bearers
at yesterday's launch in Glasgow. Absent was one of the principal
guiding hands behind the new union, Mrs Irenee O'Neill, who was
dismissed by the RCN a few months ago from her post as area officer for
Glasgow and the Western Isles.
This was ostensibly over her car mileage expenses, but took place
against a background of acrimony between herself and the RCN hierarchy.
The founders of the IFN said that Mrs O'Neill had agreed to be general
secretary of the union, unpaid for the time being at least.
Mr Alan Fleming, a community psychiatric nurse and chairman of the
federation, said it would be happy to sit down and negotiate with trusts
as soon as possible.
''We are employed by trusts and every trust is a separate employer.
There is no way you can force them into a cartel with a universal pay
rise. No other industry forms cartels to set employees' pay,'' he said.
The reasons cited by the founders for their action ranged from
dissatisfaction with what they saw as unresponsiveness to the members on
the part of the big two unions, to the desire to have a distinct
Scottish identity.
''People do not want a group of executives sitting round a table
dictating what the members will do,'' Mr Fleming said.
The treasurer, Mr Paddy McQuillan, who works at Leverndale Hospital,
said: ''I don't think it is a good idea to start out from the position
that we will go on strike. Our constitution does not mention industrial
action -- that would be very far down the road. We are unclear as to
what precisely the RCN position is.''
The result of the RCN ballot on the constitutional change which would
clear the way for industrial action will be announced tomorrow. In the
event of industrial action occurring -- which would be the subject of a
further ballot -- the question of whether IFN members should work
normally would be a local decision at each workplace, said Mr McQuillan.
The federation, costing #60 a year for membership, will be open to
both trained nurses and nursing assistants. Health care assistant James
Millar said: ''The representation of auxiliary nurses has not been high
on anyone's agenda. They do a lot of great work and that should be
recognised.''
A spokesman for the RCN, which has more than 30,000 members north of
the Border, said the college was the voice of nursing in Scotland.
''We are growing steadily and, certainly since the launch of our pay
campaign to win 3% for every nurse, our membership and recruitment has
increased dramatically. Recruitment is 50% up on the same time last
year.
''There is no question of our ballot being for strike action. The new
clause commits us to putting the care of patients first, and any
industrial action will have to be consistent with that.''
Unison, which has 35,000 nursing members in Scotland, dismissed the
new union as ''totally irrelevant''.

HOLLYWOOD is providing a big boost for one of Scotland's traditional
industries, making the kilt the delight of the Americans.
The demand for Highland dress, with all the trimmings, has reached an
all-time high on both sides of the Atlantic in the wake of the
Scottish-based hit movies Rob Roy and Braveheart.
The Inverness-based firm which boasts of being Scotland's biggest
kiltmakers is set to open its first shop in the United States and an
Edinburgh firm has just apppointed its first agent in America. Shops are
reporting that the hire of Highland dress here has surged to record
levels.
Mr David Sutherland, of Hector Russell Kiltmaker, Inverness, which has
18 shops in Scotland, said: ''We have noticed a surge in interest since
the film Rob Roy was released. We are almost ready to open our first
American retail shop in Seattle. We now need a base in the USA, because
we believe there is a huge market there for our products.''
Mrs Alison Ross, of Macpherson's of Edinburgh, said: ''We have always
had a steady demand from America, but things are definitely on the
up-and-up there just now and I am sure we have Hollywood to thank.
Because of transatlantic demand we have just appointed a sales agent in
Georgia.''
She added that her firm is enjoying an all-time peak demand for
Highland outfits for hire for weddings in Scotland.
Mr Duncan Chisholm, of Duncan Chisholm kiltmakers, Inverness, said:
''It is early yet in the holiday season, but there are definitely more
Americans around in the Highlands this year and I think that is due to
the films.''
Yesterday Mr Albert Russ, a school teacher from Minnesota enjoying his
first visit to Scotland, was being measured for a kilt at Chisholm's. He
said: ''I have been to see Braveheart and it is definitely stimulating
interest in Scotland where I come from.''
Every kilt takes eight yards of woven tartan worsted woollen cloth and
makers say that it should last a lifetime if it is properly looked
after.

Cannes
WHEN Mr John Major proclaimed at the EU summit in Cannes that he
wanted an election ''to clear the air,'' he was unwittingly acting as
spokesman for the rest of Europe.
Other summit leaders sympathise with their beleaguered British
colleague. Chancellor Kohl put a friendly arm round Mr Major -- a
personal friend whom he invites to his home for holidays -- and gave him
private words of support. President Chirac has played the part of the
kind and accommodating host.
Others, mainly Scandinavians, have expressed a measure of broad
sympathy for Britain's increasing scepticism on some of the touchier
issues and, reportedly, given Mr Major some private messages of good
luck in the battle against the Tory Euro-sceptics.
But enough is enough. Throughout the European Union, there is now an
unspoken but unmistakable belief that Britain is now a write-off in the
EU integration process. A change of Tory leadership will make no
difference. Our EU partners have come to accept that they simply cannot
do business with a British Conservative Government.
Major, Heseltine, Redwood, Clarke, Portillo -- the names are
irrelevant. What counts in Brussels is the colour of the British party
in power -- and Brussels is counting on change.
Under Margaret Thatcher, there was much fulmination and rhetoric, but
at least she mostly played the game, giving her grudging support to the
general thrust of Europeanism, signing the single market legislation and
putting the pound into the European exchange rate mechanism.
The fact that she gave voters the impression she was a Euro-sceptic
did not matter outside the UK. Europe's partners knew where they were
with Margaret Thatcher.
Under John Major, the rhetoric has become ridiculous doubletalk as he
has assumed the Janus mask and tried to be all things to all factions of
his imploding party. Brave try, nice chap, victim of his times, but not
a serious negotiator -- that is the European view of John Major these
days. Best that the air was cleared quickly and completely.
This disillusionment with the British Government could, theoretically,
carry a terrible price for the European ideal. Europhobes in the
Conservative Party would love a British withdrawal from Europe which
could potentially destroy the integration process.
The general feeling in Brussels is that Britain is now a semi-detached
member of the European Union and a pain in the neck. Impatience with
British intransigence is tempered by understanding that Mr Major is in
deep domestic trouble.
Fortunately for the European Union -- and probably for the Labour
Party -- there is a brutally simple alternative to the paralysis which
Britain threatens to inflict on Europe. Community heads of state and
government spotted it perhaps a year ago as Major's troubles mounted.
Now the European Union puts its faith and expectation in John Major's
Government being hammered in a British General Election.
Some, like Kohl and Chirac, will regret his passing and salute his
memory before welcoming Tony Blair as a serious European with whom they
can do business. Others, like Jean-Luc Dehaene of Belgium -- blocked by
Major for the presidency of the European Commission -- will dance on his
grave.
This is not just wishful thinking by the Euro-groupies. Europe's next
epochal event is just around the corner and is the focus of everyone's
thinking. The Maastricht revision super-summit beckons next year and
Britain's Conservative Government is sworn to stand against the tide of
integration. Deadlock and frustration beckon.
There was a glimpse of British attitudes again yesterday when the UK
alone stood out against having the European Court of Justice as arbiter
in disputes involving Europol, the new cross-border criminal
intelligence agency.
This is exactly the kind of frustration the EU wants rid of. Europe
now wants to kill off the flea in the cat and to kill the flea you must
first destroy the carrier. And the carrier is Mr Major's divided party.
That is why the European Union is now straining to show some vestige
of public sympathy for John Major, the good European who was rerouted by
his own party malcontents, and why his colleagues at the top table in
Cannes this week were simultaneously praying that their British problem
will soon be gone, courtesy of the British electorate.

THE heatwave is also being blamed for a problem which will severely
disrupt rail services using Glasgow's Central Station until tomorrow.
ScotRail has appealed to passengers to check their local stations
before setting off, to ensure trains are running normally, after an
overhead electrical line near the rail bridge over the River Clyde was
pulled down by a train last night.
A spokeswoman for ScotRail said that some services would be diverted
into Glasgow's Queen Street low-level station, and buses would cover
some other services.
The incident occured as the 18.54 Motherwell to Central Station train
snagged an electrical line, bringing it down and causing a power
failure.
The spokeswoman said: ''When it gets hot, the overhead lines do expand
and this causes them to droop.''
She added: ''This is a difficult area for engineers to work in because
there are a lot of overheads, and every line is electrified into
Central. Engineers cannot work on one without isolating others because
of safety regulations.
''It is likely to be a big job as the overhead may have to be replaced
in its entirety.''
Passengers on the Motherwell train were taken into the station by a
replacement diesel train.

A WAREHOUSEMAN from Condorrat described last night the desperate
struggles of a workman who drowned in the cold water of Broadwood Loch,
near Cumbernauld.
Mr David Walker, 30, of Rose Street, helped another man, who was near
collapse, from the loch.
But still shaken from the accident, Mr Walker talked of his regret at
not being able to save the dead man, even though he knew that by the
time he arrived, it was too late.
Police confirmed last night that one workman, employed as a landscape
gardener by a Kilmarnock-based sub-contracter, Murdoch Landscaping, at
the Barratt construction site at Broadwood, had died after getting into
difficulties while swimming during his lunch-break.
Two other workmen managed to reach safety.
The dead man lived in Kilmarnock with his partner, and had two
children from a previous marriage.
Mr Walker was walking near the man-made loch with his wife Linda and
sons Marc, four, and Paul, 13, at lunchtime, when he noticed people
struggling and screaming in the water.
''I just ran right into the water, but by that time one of the guys
had started towards me. He stood up and then fell into the water again.
I sat him on the bank. He kept on at me to let him go back in, but it
was useless. The other guy had already gone under, and he was
exhausted,'' said Mr Walker.
It is understood that the three men, all gardeners, had swum to a
small island, only 50 yards from the shore, but one tried to swim the
further 200 yards to the north side of the loch.
Inspector James Logie, of Strathclyde Police, said: ''There was a 999
call telling us there was a man in difficulty in the water. For some
reason he had decided to swim right across the loch and got into
trouble. One of the gardeners tried to help his chum, but it was no use.
There were also bystanders who tried to jump in.''
Mr Walker, describing the man's attempts to save his friend, said:
''If he had stayed, he would have gone down too.''
People at the scene had suggested that the dead man had been wearing
his workboots when he went swimming, said Mr Walker. In addition, the
water was very cold, even in hot weather, he said.
Over the weekend, a number of people had been in the water, added Mr
Walker.
''After this today, I think there should be warning signs,'' he said.
Police said yesterday that their underwater unit had recovered the
man's body. His name was not being released until members of his family
had been informed.
Mr Logie advised members of the public to take extreme care over
swimming in unknown waters during the hot spell.
''It is a very foolish practice. Even while we were waiting for the
underwater unit to arrive, some lads were about to go into the water,''
he said.
Last night, Ms Stephanie Dodds, 21, who lives at Netherwood Place,
Westfield, near the loch, said: ''This has been an accident waiting to
happen. They just constructed this loch and left it, not thinking about
the number of kids who jump in and paddle there.
''Even in this weather the water is very cold, and nobody knows quite
how deep the loch is,'' she added.
* In Bathgate yesterday, the heatwave was blamed for a fire which set
two homes alight.
Strong sunlight ignited accelerants stored in a shed beside one of the
houses in Beecraigs Country Park, and the fire spread to an adjoining
home.
No-one was injured, but the occupants had to be rehoused because of
damage to the interior of their homes.
Police and Fire Brigade officials warned of the danger of sunlight
shining directly, or indirectly, on to flammable substances and causing
them to ignite.
* In Edinburgh, police are investigating a sexual assault on a
17-year-old student as she sunbathed near the summit of Blackford Hill,
about 12.15pm yesterday.
The girl, who is not being named, was unhurt, but shaken. Police want
to trace a man aged in his late forties, of medium build with a slight
paunch. He had short grey hair combed back at the sides, and was wearing
blue jeans and a light coloured shirt rolled up at the sleeves.
Blackford Hill, in the Morningside area of the city, has become a
popular place for walkers and sunbathers, particularly in the recent
good weather.
A Lothian and Borders Police spokesman said yesterday: ''We need to
speak to anyone who was on the hill on Tuesday, who may have seen this
man. We cannot rule out the possibility that he may have attempted to
approach other sunbathers prior to this incident, and we would appeal to
them to come forward.''
The man police are anxious to interview is reported to have made his
way down the hill in the direction of Blackford Pond, near Charterhall
Road.
* Edinburgh Royal Infirmary said yesterday that seven people suffering
from the effects of sunburn had been treated successfully at its
dermatology unit since the weekend.

SEAN Connery yesterday dismissed any prospect of his retirement in
August when he turns 65, and declared: ''I can't afford it''.
The Hollywood star played up to his image as a cash-conscious Scot
while looking forward to a bus pass and free cinema admission.
''I'm discussing the bus pass with my lawyers to see if it intrudes on
my earning capacity,'' he joked in London.
The former 007 plays King Arthur in Hollywood's latest Camelot film,
First Knight, which opens on July 7 and co-stars Richard Gere and Julia
Ormond in the eternal love triangle. He was said to have had furious
rows with Gere during shooting of the #40m film, and reportedly objected
to the American's lax time-keeping.
''I did get a few things straightened out,'' was all Connery had to
say about his time on location in Wales.
However, he was more explicit in his criticism of the Government for
failing to match the film tax breaks that have attracted productions to
Ireland.
''It's a pity they can't get it right like they do in Ireland,'' he
said. ''There's #100m of money going into Ireland. Braveheart (the Mel
Gibson film) moved to Ireland -- quite rightly -- because they got a
better deal. But, of course, they are so smart here they didn't do
anything about it.''
Connery said he had been offered parts in Rob Roy, starring Liam
Neeson, and Braveheart -- but other work commitments prevented his
accepting. However, he said he would be filming in Scotland this Friday,
with a schools appeal aimed at improving diet.
''I'm appealing into the schools about the dangers of bad diet. We
have probably the worst heart problems and cancer, with bad food and bad
education,'' he said.
Connery denied rumours that he would have a cameo role in the new
James Bond film, Goldeneye, but said he would ''adore'' to do a fourth
version of the Indiana Jones adventure films with Harrison Ford.
He also gracefully conceded his status as the world's sexiest man to
the heart-throb, Brad Pitt. ''I didn't want to defend my title anyway,''
he joked, when told that Pitt was now the holder. ''I have got to pass
on the baton.''

LABOUR'S approach to devolution could seriously affect inward
investment in Scotland and lead to major companies transferring their
headquarters south of the Border, the director general of the Institute
of Directors warned yesterday.
Mr Tim Melville-Ross said the likelihood of heavier tax burdens would
be bad news for the Scottish economy and would be ''likely to destroy,
rather than create, jobs''.
The director-general of the right-wing group also cast serious doubts
on whether the Scottish economy could survive separation. ''To
disentangle it, to tear it apart and go back to the drawing board, would
be very damaging because important parts would cease to exist,'' he
said.
The comments by Mr Melville-Ross, made at a Glasgow news conference
before he went on to address business leaders at an IoD lunch in
Edinburgh, were immediately dismissed by Shadow Scottish Secretary
George Robertson and Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond.
Mr Robertson, who earlier this month addressed the IoD in the capital,
said: ''The IoD would command greater respect if, before attacking
Labour's devolution plans, it bothered to find out what they are.
''Dogmatic opposition based on a deliberate ignorance of what is
proposed simply tells the Scots and Scottish business that these
southern-based politico-business pundits have nothing to offer them.
''A devolved Scottish parliament will not change the rules for
Scottish business but it will bring government much closer to hearing
what the real business community wants.''
Mr Salmond was equally vociferous in his condemnation of Mr
Melville-Ross's comments. He said: ''Scottish businessmen and women are
not as flighty as Mr Melville-Ross seems to think. Indeed, it may come
as a surprise to him to learn that increasing numbers involved in
business in Scotland are recognising the benefits that independence
could bring to their companies.
''It is the union, not independence, that poses the threat to Scottish
jobs and future inward investment. The Scottish people know that to be
true. They have seen it all around them.''
Mr Melville-Ross, who claimed his views were broadly representative of
Scottish businesses, warned that major constitutional change, with quite
different powers both in terms of limited tax raising and legislation,
as proposed by Labour, would almost inevitably lead to ''more difficult
rather than easier business conditions''.
''What the Scottish business community has to do is create conditions
in which people actually want to come here to do business,'' he said.
''If you are discouraging inward investment by a different and less
business friendly approach, that clearly has to be bad news for the
Scottish economy.''
He said Scottish business such as Scottish and Newcastle, Morrison
Construction Group, Standard Life, and Scottish Widows were very closely
integrated with the rest of the UK and their ability to create and
maintain wealth depended on this. But devolution could result in them
moving their headquarters south of the Border, he claimed.
''The impact would not be immediate. Clearly, if you have made an
investment of say #60m, you are going to stay with that. But over a long
period, you would see a gradual drain of investment away from Scotland.
After all, why have your main base in Scotland when the tax regime is
more favourable in England?''
A statement from Scottish Widows appeared to broadly support the IoD
chief's comments. It said its overriding priority was to protect the
interests of policyholders and added: ''Any assessment of the impact of
constitutional change on our policyholders is bound to be purely
hypothetical at the present time. However, if constitutional change were
to come about with a consequent impact on our policyholders'
investments, we would respond to the situation accordingly.''
Morrison Construction Group said: ''We have not had any discussion
with the IoD which could have prompted Mr Melville-Ross's comment
concerning Morrison. We don't base corporate decisions on hypothetical
situations and would just add that we place great value on our Edinburgh
group office presence.''
Mr Scott Bell, Standard Life's group managing director, said: ''We
have continued to speak to politicians of all political parties and we
have told them again of the sensitivities of the financial services
sector in particular to constitutional change.'' No-one from Scottish
and Newcastle was availabe for comment.

Cannes
PRIME Minister John Major and Irish Taoiseach John Bruton last night
signalled optimism about a breakthrough in the stalled Northern Ireland
peace process.
Meeting on the fringe of the EU summit, the two leaders agreed to
formulate a package of measures aimed at coaxing the IRA to drop its
total refusal to hand over weaponry.
At the heart of the proposals is believed to be the question of early
releases of some convicted paramilitaries from both sides of the
Northern Ireland divide.
But neither Prime Minister would talk about the contents of the latest
initiative which is now being put together in strict secrecy by
officials from both governments. ''These are not for public discussion
at the moment,'' Mr Major told reporters.
The two met for more than hour -- longer than expected -- after the
summit had ended, and both leaders brought separate proposals to the
table. They are anxious to break the deadlock in moves to all-party
talks caused by Britain's insistence on the IRA first decommissioning
weaponry and the IRA's refusal to make even token concessions.
Mr Martin McGuinness, deputy to Sinn Fein's Mr Gerry Adams, adopted a
noticeably tougher stance on the issue in Brussels last week when he
described even a symbolic handover of weapons as a ''surrender''. Sinn
Fein has said that such a climbdown by the IRA could cause the death of
the peace process.
But Mr Major yesterday used a phrase which some regarded as
significant. He said there ''must be some form of substantial gesture''.
Mr Major and Mr Bruton are now working on a plan which is believed to
involve mainly the Irish Government in a deal with the IRA which would
allow the British Government to claim it was not making concessions.
Mr Major said the ''who, where, and how'' questions were being
tackled. ''But the 'when' is a big problem.'' He described the plans
being drawn up as very detailed and technical. ''Progress is not easy,''
he said.
With more than a little help from his political friends at the summit,
Mr Major can claim to have safeguarded national sovereignty, saved
Britain more than #100m on its payments to Brussels, and seen off
difficult decisions on a single currency.
Summit host Jacques Chirac gently reminded the Prime Minister: ''We
are only doing this because of you and the position you are in.''
Mr Chirac told a news conference: ''Given the difficult political
situation in the UK at the moment, we felt we could not make life more
complicated for John Major . . . we didn't wish to force him into a
corner.''
Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, the man Mr Major vetoed as
Commission president because he was too federalist, also said
concessions were made at the summit precisely because Mr Major was
having a difficult time at home.
The summit ended with a decision to go ahead and set up Europol, The
Hague-based EU criminal intelligence gathering agency designed to help
tackle cross-border crime, drugs trafficking and illegal immigration.
But, in deference to Mr Major, a key element of the deal was postponed.
EU leaders agreed not to press for the European Court of Justice to
have jurisdiction in any disputes between European citizens or member
states over the way Europol information is used in legal proceedings.
The issue is crucial for Britain. Even the token involvement of the
Luxembourg court would amount to a transfer of sovereignty, giving the
EU rights for the first time to oversee national police matters.
Mr Major also convinced his colleagues to reduce the financial burden
on Britain of contributing to the Brussels development aid budget for
Third World countries.
They reluctantly agreed to cut more than #100m off the UK contribution
this year, reducing it to #1300m.
And on a single currency, the final declaration omits all reference to
agreeing the name, the denominations of notes and all other technical
details which must be agreed before a one-money Europe can become a
reality.
Originally the text made it clear that these issues must be decided at
the next summit in Madrid. Now the member states have merely reaffirmed
that January 1, 1999, remains the latest launch date -- a timetable set
out years ago in the Maastricht treaty.
But all reference to 1997 as the earlier target date has been dropped
and Mr Major can tell his Euro-sceptics he has conceded nothing new,
neither committing Britain to joining a single currency nor ruling it
out for all time.

GOVERNMENT housing proposals for England and Wales -- to create 1.5
million more home owners, to further limit council housing, and prevent
leap-frogging housing queues -- last night ran into widespread
opposition.
Local authorities, with the agreement of tenants, will be encouraged
to transfer housing to new landlords, unlocking private funds to improve
homes under a White Paper published yesterday.
It will become compulsory for housing associations to allow tenants to
buy their homes, as a central part of meeting the Government's target of
1.5 million more home owners by 2005.
The Government also intends to eliminate the automatic right of some
groups of people -- such as the homeless and single mothers -- to
leap-frog the housing queue.
Earlier, the Archbishop of Canterbury Dr George Carey attacked
Government housing policies and accused Ministers of ''loading the
dice'' in favour of home ownership.
The Archbishop, in an address to the Institute of Housing Annual
Conference in Harrogate, also criticised plans to end homeless people's
rights to a permanent home.
The Government's plans, which offer no help for people in negative
equity -- despite pressure from Tory back benchers to boost the housing
market, were immediately attacked by charities and housing pressure
groups.
Shelter claimed they were ''devastating news'' for struggling home
owners and thousands of homeless people.
It claimed the Government's White Paper threatened to turn
homelessness into a ''long-term tragedy, with homeless families never
knowing when or if they will get a permanent home''.
The Association of District Councils said it would ''vigorously
oppose'' the changes, which would do nothing to halt the plague of
widespread homelessness and millions of unfit homes.
The National Council for One Parent Families warned that Britain's 1.4
million one parent families would be driven into ''insecure, unsafe, and
unaffordable'' accommodation if the proposals became law.
Shadow Environment Minister Frank Dobson said: ''This White Paper does
nothing to restore faith in the mortgage market. It does little or
nothing to end the crisis in housing investment. It does nothing to help
the homeless or people who are overcrowded, and indeed is likely to make
matters worse.''

LABOUR put control of inflation at the heart of its economic policy,
unveiled yesterday.
The party repeated its pledge to be tough on inflation as an essential
way of avoiding the boom and bust cycles of the past and providing the
stability business needs to plan ahead.
But it refused to fill in details of its tax, spending, and inflation
plans. Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown said Labour's inflation target
would be set out only ''after proper consultation in government''.
On tax, the party said it was in favour of a fair and progressive
system geared to boosting investment and would take immediate action to
close loopholes and tackle abuse.
Mr Brown said it would be irresponsible to be specific about tax rates
at this stage. ''All the information required will be known before the
General Election. We will make our position clear in our manifesto,'' he
told a news conference to mark the launch of A New Economic Future for
Britain.
The document, which represents the final report of Labour's economic
policy commission, draws together previously-floated ideas and will form
the basis of the policies the party would follow in government.
On spending, Mr Brown repeated that the party would be responsible and
abide by the golden rule of borrowing -- that is borrowing only to
finance public investment and not to fund consumption.
The ratio of government to gross domestic product would remain stable
over the economic cycle, he said.
Labour would have a statutory framework to encourage employers to
invest in training and skills. The public sector would not be able to
fund all the necessary investment in infrastructure so the gap would be
filled by greater use of private finance in partnership with government.
Board of Trade President Michael Heseltine dismissed the document as
''rekindled Labour policies of interference and control. Far from
improving the prosperity of people, they represent a massive threat to
Britain's competitiveness and would lead to devastating job losses,'' he
said.
Plans for a national minimum wage, the level of which Labour has not
yet set, would add an estimated #5000m to the national wage bill and
cost hundreds of jobs, he said.
Support for European social legislation would open the door to a wide
range of employment regulation which would undermine Britain's ability
to cope in world markets. A training levy would amount to extra taxes
for business.

THE death of a teenage girl in Cornton Vale prison only days after
another girl hung herself in the same block prompted angry calls last
night for reform and sharp criticism of the remand unit.
Arlene Elliot, 17, of Partick, Glasgow, was discovered in her cell on
Monday evening in the young offenders' and remand block of Scotland's
only women's prison, near Stirling. It is believed she had hanged
herself.
She had been remanded in custody by Hamilton Sheriff Court for
background reports last Wednesday on two charges of theft. She had four
previous convictions, including shoplifting and attempted robbery. She
was not under observation in Cornton Vale and had seemed normal only
hours before her death.
On Friday, Kelly Holland, 17, of Hillhouse Road, Hamilton, was found
dead in her cell. It is believed she had hung herself with a sheet. She
had been in custody for less than 24 hours and was awaiting trial at
Hamilton Sheriff Court on breach of the peace and assault charges. She
and Arlene had become friendly in the remand unit.
Yesterday, Mr Clive Fairweather, chief inspector with the Prisons
Inspectorate for Scotland, said his organisation had carried out a
three-day inspection of Cornton Vale last month. ''The regime there
needs to be improved,'' he said. ''Staff are carrying out their
statutory duties and little else.''
In his annual report, Mr Fairweather will tell Scottish Secretary Ian
Lang that the rise in suicides is the most worrying problem facing the
Scottish Prison Service. There have been several recent clusters of
suicides in Scottish jails with three in less than three months at
Greenock, three in one month at Barlinnie, and three in two months at
Perth.
''In April alone this year, there have been five suicides. It is a
problem that is on the increase and the prison service don't really know
how to deal with it,'' said Mr Fairweather.
Kelly's parents also demanded answers from the prison service, saying
they had told the prison their daughter was depressed. Edward and Isobel
Holland said they could not understand how she could have taken her life
if she was supposed to be under observation.
At their home in Blantyre, near Hamilton, the Hollands said they did
not know Arlene Elliot and denied reports that their daughter had killed
herself because she was grieving over the death of a youth murdered in
Hamilton on Friday.
The couple, who have five other children, attended their daughter's
funeral on Monday but said they had not been contacted by the prison
service nor had they been given back Kelly's property.
Mr Holland said Kelly had been severely depressed and had telephoned
the remand centre to tell them. ''They said they would keep an eye on
her,'' he added. ''We want to know why Kelly was not checked every 15
minutes.''
Mrs Holland said her daughter had written a letter trying to explain
why she took her life. She said Kelly had been in Cornton Vale before
but added she believed her daughter had been ''picked on'' by the
police.
''She was a bit mixed up but she was only 17. On the news it said she
was under supervision, then in the papers it said she hadn't been. We
don't understand how she had the means to be able to kill herself. Two
wee girls have died. There have got to be answers somewhere,'' she said.
The two deaths prompted a call for a change in the way teenagers are
dealt with from penal reformer Mr Drummond Hunter, of the Howard League
penal reform charity. Dumbarton MP and Labour's shadow home affairs
spokesman, Mr John McFall, said he would be writing to Mr Lang on the
issue.
Scottish Prison Service chief executive Eddie Frizzell said any death
in custody was of great concern. Fatal accident inquiries into the two
deaths, the second and third suspected suicides in Cornton Vale since it
opened in 1973, will be held following a police investigation.
He confirmed the remand complex currently holds around 33 girls
although it is designed for 21. Girls did share cells but he denied the
unit was overcrowded.
No-one was available for comment at Arlene Elliot's home in Dumbarton
Road where she lived with her grandmother.

<HEADLINE>Major hints at tax cuts in bid for early knockout as Redwood suggests right-wing pact. Portillo poised for round two</HEADLINE>

THE Prime Minister set out to crush rival John Redwood yesterday as
rumours grew in Westminster that his Employment Secretary, Mr Michael
Portillo, has struck a pact on behalf of the hard right to enter a
second ballot.
As Mr Major, still in Cannes at the European Summit, divulged Cabinet
discussions about tax cuts and other radical proposals, Mr Redwood
revealed he had met Mr Portillo on Monday and significantly indicated
they might still be working together after a fortnight.
The Major camp is now going all out to achieve a two-to-one majority
on Tuesday and therefore prevent a second ballot which might indeed
bring in the President of the Board of Trade, Mr Michael Heseltine, and
Mr Portillo.
Mr Redwood questioned on BBC Radio yesterday as to whether he had
reached an agreement with the Employment Secretary, replied: ''He is an
extremely talented politician and I look forward to working with him
whatever the future might bring over the next two weeks.''
The phrase ''two weeks'' may have been mischievous, but the former
Welsh Secretary admitted he had talked to Mr Portillo -- who is supposed
to be supporting the Prime Minister -- on Monday, the day he resigned
from the Cabinet.
''I have seen Michael Portillo since announcing my leadership bid,''
he said. ''I told him I was going all out to win in the first round. I
don't expect him to suddenly make a public statement in my support
because I understand his position.''
This last phrase alone is deeply embarrassing for Mr Portillo who has
not yet emerged as a front-line canvasser in the Prime Minister's cause.
Everybody at the Commons, including the Opposition, realise that if Mr
Major cannot win substantially on Tuesday, other candidates for the
leadership will emerge.
This prospect is the one Mr Major has to kill. Last night his team
were playing some of his trump cards indicating a radical shake-up for
schools, tax, and pensions. At the Commons his Ministers were revealing
as much as they could about his intentions without actually breaking
Budget secrecy.
The emphasis was switching from ''when we cut tax'' to ''how we cut
it''. One scheme is to permit the elderly to take out some kind of
annuity to provide for sickness in old age without losing all their
savings. There could be tax relief for the individuals and for the firms
that might provide such cover.
Mr Major's team say the Government is going to redeem its pledge to
cut inheritance tax and eventually abolish it. Teachers and school
governors, including parents, may be given power to set up new
''charter'' schools, protected by the State with maximum independence.
Many other proposals about redeeming the Tory pledge, essential for
survival, to reduce taxation are in the pipeline. No formal Cabinet
discussions have taken place yet because Ministers, including Mr
Redwood, have only just agreed the State spending target.
Wrapped up, this is Mr Major's pre-emptive strike against the Redwood
manifesto which is so far unspecific about how he would cut taxation.
Yesterday he confined himself to stating that the funds for tax cuts can
be provided by ''cutting out bureaucracy and wastage''.
Mr Redwood said he would divulge more detail later. The dance of the
seven veils, he said, is more exciting when the veils are not discarded
all at the same time.
Mr Major's aim is to blow his rival's economic alternative out of the
campaign as soon as possible. Tory MPs are to be persuaded that Mr
Redwood has nothing more to offer in policy terms than the Prime
Minister, except his strident denunciation of a single currency for
Europe and the promise of a referendum on sovereignty issues.
Mr Redwood is expected to retaliate quickly, as best he can, because
until Monday he was part of these Cabinet committee discussions,
planning how to defeat Labour rather than Major.
However, the rumours about Mr Portillo's conduct behind the scenes are
causing concern although the Major camp scoff at any idea that the two
men might have reached a pact. As one Cabinet Minister pointed out:
''Portillo and Redwood are actually rivals for the Thatcherite
inheritance.''
Although such rumours could be damaging for Mr Major, any sign of a
right-wing pact like this might also drive more of the 239 voting MPs
into the Major camp. Heseltine supporters warned of this last night,
partly because they would like it to happen to give their man an easier
ride in any second ballot with a split right-wing vote.
Deputy Labour leader John Prescott set out to exploit the right-wing
pact rumours. He said: ''It appears from the BBC News and from other
information in our possession, that Michael Portillo is telling
journalists that the Prime Minister will win against John Redwood but
that he and Michael Heseltine will force a second contest in the autumn.
''This exposes the two-faced, cheating nature of the various
contenders.
Mr Prescott demanded that Mr Portillo explain himself or immediately
deny the BBC reports.

THE man at the centre of the growing ''jobs for the boys'' storm in
the new unitary authorities has warned he could call on Scottish
Secretary Ian Lang to take action against councillors.
Mr Robert Peggie, chairman of the Local Government Staff Commission,
yesterday spoke exclusively to The Herald about his ''disappointment''
over the way some councillors have behaved.
There has been rising concern among those appointed to oversee local
government reorganisation that rules and recommendations are being
broken and bent over the appointments of some senior officials to the
unitary councils.
Mr Peggie said his ultimate weapon was calling for Mr Lang's
intervention to make a council comply with commission rules.
He said he would have thought that in the wake of the Monklands
affair, the new councils would have been bending over backwards to
ensure their activities were not open to criticism in this way.
He warned: ''The new authorities must be mindful of public perceptions
and public attitudes. If they are seen to be falling down over the
process of appointments then they will be judged by these actions and
may well take quite a time to establish their own credibility in the
public mind.''
Mr Peggie said the commission was deciding what action to take over a
number of complaints received. As he spoke, another jobs row broke out,
this time in Labour-controlled Edinburgh, with complaints from
opposition Tories and Liberal Democrats over apppointments procedures.
Tory leader Daphne Sleigh confirmed she had written to Mr Peggie
expressing concern about a lack of professional guidance for councillors
over the procedures. She said the Tories were unhappy about the short
leeting for the education director's job on the new city council as some
applicants were not allowed to make presentations to the committee on
the ground they had been interviewed for the post two years ago by
Lothian region.
The present regional director of education, Ms Elizabeth Reid, was
recommended to the city post without an interview and her appointment
now awaits confirmation by the next council meeting.
Liberal Democrats have also complained to Labour leader Keith Geddes
about the fact no interviews were held. Their leader, Councillor Donald
Gorrie, has alleged such procedures ''give out all the wrong messages
about favouritism, political carve-ups and jobs for the boys/girls''.
Mrs Sleigh also claims a situation has arisen over the appointment of
the property services director, where an applicant who has been selected
for interview has as a referee a councillor on the interviewing panel.
Mr Geddes said the Tories on the committee voted unanimously with the
others to recommend Ms Reid's appointment.
Meanwhile, Labour's national executive in London today is to consider
taking further action against the Monklands councillors suspended last
week in the wake of the Black report. It is likely that those
councillors who sit on the new North Lanarkshire unitary authority will
also have their Labour membership suspended.
Details of the new Labour Party investigation into the affair will
also be agreed today.

FILM star Hugh Grant was arrested after ''having sex'' with a
prostitute in a car, according to police in Hollywood.
The actor, star of the recent Four Weddings And A Funeral, has been
charged with ''lewd conduct in a public place''.
He later described his action as ''insane'' in a statement released by
his publicist in Los Angeles. He said: ''Last night I did something
completely insane.
''I have hurt people I love and embarrassed people I work with. For
both things I am more sorry than I can say.''
A spokeswoman for Los Angeles police said she could not specify what
he was charged with, other than it was ''a sex act''. She said the case
would be heard on July 18.
Grant, 34, whose girlfriend is actress Elizabeth Hurley, was spotted
by vice officers picking up a woman on Sunset Boulevard, according to
the Los Angeles Police Department.
''They drove a short distance to a residential street and engaged in
an act of lewd conduct,'' said police spokesman Officer Eduardo Funes.
''Vice officers walked up to the car and observed the act. Both
prostitute and Grant were taken into custody.
''He was booked for lewd conduct at a Hollywood jail and released
under his own recognisance.''
Officer Funes said lewd conduct covered various offences. ''They were
having sex in public,'' he said. ''We can't yet be any more specific
about what exactly the officers saw.''
He said Grant ''could be sent to jail for up to six months or have a
fine or both. It's up to the judge and depends on whether there is a
track record.''
The alleged prostitute, Divine Brown, 23, was charged with soliciting,
he said. The incident happened at 1.30am.
Police said Grant would not have to appear at his hearing. He could be
represented by a lawyer.
Grant is thought to have been in Hollywood for media interviews to
promote his latest film, Nine Months.
Film director Michael Winner said: ''Compared with what goes on in
Hollywood, he should be given a good housekeeping seal.''
He said he did not believe the publicity would damage Grant's career.
''Although there is a moral backlash in some parts of America, they
would be hard pressed to picket the theatres,'' he said. ''People talk a
lot of rubbish about his nice clean image.''
He added: ''The police should really have better things to do in one
of the most vice-ridden cities in the world -- where mugging and theft
and rape are of an outstanding quantity -- than to be snooping around
two individuals in a perfectly normal act.''
He said that ''even people with beautiful girlfriends'' may wish to
have sex if their partner is unavailable.
Hurley, who has a #1m contract to promote Estee Lauder, was in New
York.
A spokesman for the actress said she was expected back in London
today.
Grant and Hurley have been together since 1986 when they met in Spain
on the set of Rowing With The Wind, in which the actor played Lord
Byron. The couple have always evaded the question of marriage.
Grant was the first man to feature in both the beauty and glamour
section of Madame Tussaud's annual popularity poll earlier this year.
