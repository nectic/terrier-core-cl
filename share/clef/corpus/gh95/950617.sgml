IN THE tongue-in-cheek which was part of the initiation ceremony for
the Detection Club formed by crime writers in the thirties, new members
had to forswear a long list of cheap tricks deemed to bring the genre
into disrepute. The list, compiled by among others Dorothy Sayers,
banned such spectacular plot devices as divine revelations,
coincidences, and acts of God. It also included feminine intuition.
The question of whether there was such a thing as a specifically
female hunch was of particular interest in a genre in which women become
noticeably successful both as creators and created. Agatha Christie, for
instance, has Hercule Poirot and Ariadne Oliver argue the matter, with
Mrs Oliver in favour and Poirot, needless to say, remaining unconvinced.
On the face of it, it seems surprising that women writers should have
taken so enthusiastically to a genre whose raison d'etre, in the main is
death. Aren't women supposed to be the life-givers, after all?
One theory, advanced by Alison Hennegan in her introductory essay to
the collection of short stories by women crime writers Reader, I
Murdered Him, is that it's not the business of killing which lies at the
heart of women's feeling for detective fiction but the search for
justice.
The justice she has in mind, however, is not the high-minded
abstraction represented by a police force which has still to properly
value women, and a heavily male-dominated judiciary which can still on
notable occasions fail them.
Instead this is a natural justice belonging to those who, by virtue of
their status, find themselves in that grey area outside the reach of
abstractions which deal only in black and white. It's the sort of
justice dispensed, for instance by P D James's youthful private
investigator Cordelia Gray in An Unsuitable Job For A Woman, who ends up
covering up a murder carried out by a mother on the man who has killed
her son.
Women's crime fiction is a kaleidoscope, each turn revealing a female
sleuth of a different hue. Miss Marple, on the surface at least the
standard-bearer of Home Counties Tory-voting England, would doubtless be
scandalised by Loretta Lawson's lefty Guardian views, particularly her
views on the police.
Neither would Miss Marple's opinions on working mothers and the sexual
licence allowed to young girls endear her either to Jane Tennison or V I
Warshawski. Still, they all have one thing in common. They are all
female and single, and by virtue of their sex and status, all
marginalised in some way. All in some way, as Hennegan suggests,
outsiders.
It came as no surprise to fans of Jane Tennison that the recent Prime
Suspect trilogy opened with the newly promoted superintendent preparing
to terminate the pregnancy we left her with at the end of the last
series.
For while Ruth Rendell's Wexford can work the hours he does and still
boast a family, it's hard to imagine under what circumstances the same
luxury could be extended to Jane Tennison. Even the most competent
nannie, after all, can't take the place of a long-suffering wife.
In the world of detective fiction, the words female and single seem to
go together, well, like love and marriage. And it was thus, right from
the beginning.
Half of male Victorian England fell in love with Marion Halcombe when
she first appeared in Wilkie Collins's The Woman in White back in 1859.
Thackeray sat up all night reading her adventures. Gladstone put off
going to the theatre to find out what happened. Swinburne, a man who
always went for masterful women, pronounced her ''a glorious female''.
And Marion is masterful. Sara Paretsky's Warshawski would have been
proud of her, slipping out of her incommodious dove silk to clamber
across the roof-tops in the rain in petticoat and cloak to spy on the
arch-villain Fosco.
Even her adversary is in love with her by the end. ''The first and
last weakness of Fosco's life,'' is what he calls her, a worthy tribute.
Yet in the age and class into which Marion has been born, she is worth
very little. Courageous and capable, amusing and graceful she may be,
but she is also ugly, a failing that blots out all those other good
graces in the Victorian marriage market. Marion, we have no doubt, is
destined for spinsterhood.
It's an old-fashioned word spinster, no longer in tune with the times.
It scarcely seems to fit today's Golden Girls. It belongs to a dim and
distant past where women, robbed of their menfolk by war, went on to
live out their lives insufficiently appreciated despite all their best
efforts, patronised and faintly scorned.
On the face of it, Miss Marple would appear to be the archetypal
spinster, one of those old maids of which John Major still dreams,
bicycling through the early-morning mist to communion.
Miss Marple, however, can surprise us. Some of her opinions for
instance turn out to be not what we expect at all. On being told in
Nemesis for instance that a woman friend is to marry a younger man, she
says: ''Much better . . . much better . . . In these days men age so
much quicker than women . . . they get more things the matter with them
. . . I think perhaps they worry and work too much . . . I think we're
the tougher sex . . .''
In fact, upon closer inspection Miss Marple turns out to be a very
tough old bird indeed; her misleading appearance as the very caricature
of the daffy old maid is shamelessly part of her and her creator's
design.
For while the ever-resourceful Warshawski must get herself done up as
an electrician in a boiler-suit and baseball cap to get into the office
whose files she needs to raid, Miss Marple's disguise is simpler.
When Miss Marple needs information, she merely clothes herself in the
world's preconception of spinsters, playing upon them and turning their
own discriminatory and patronising attitudes to her own advantage.
In Nemesis, for instance, intent upon finding out if the murderer has
parcelled up and dispatched incriminating clothes, she pretends to be a
forgetful old woman who believes she has posted a package to the wrong
destination.
The woman at the Post Office tells her all she needs to know, moved as
she is ''by Miss Marple's patent incapacity and general state of
senility and dither''.
Thanking her, Miss Marple clasps her hands in an ecstasy of relief.
''How clever of you . . . thank you . . . thank you . . .''
The ease with which Miss Marple can find things out lies less in
herself than in the world's view of her as ''one of those chatty, fluffy
old ladies whom other people expect to talk, to ask questions that were,
on the face of it, merely gossipy questions''.
Hidden behind her pink fluffy cardigan, her lap full of camouflaging
crochet work, Miss Marple's brain ticks away like a computer. Apparently
absorbed in her needles, she drops the name of a dead girl into the
assembled company with a soft sigh and the deadly aim of Rambo hurling a
hand-grenade.
''Although her face registered nothing, the keen eyes behind her
glasses had watched three people in a simultaneous manner as she had
trained herself to do for many years now, when wishing to observe her
neighbours either in church, mothers' meetings, or at other public
functions in St Mary Mead when she had been on the track of some
interesting piece of news or gossip.''
Miss Marple is chosen for the job of finding the murderer in Nemesis
by a millionaire who divines in her what he terms ''a natural flair for
justice''. She allows, to another character, that she may have a
peculiarly strong recognition of evil, something akin to a ''very keen
sense of smell''.
In Miss Marple's world, capital-letter concepts like Evil and Justice
are still recognisable. It's still essentially a black and white world,
unlike Warshawski's modern-day Chicago where grey is the order of the
day, and wickedness may not even be against the law, or at worst
something a good lawyer can get you off.
In some sense, Sara Paretsky's Warshawski is the ultimate outsider, a
private investigator, living literally on her wits, divorced, only just
the right side of 40 and the law as well.
In Guardian Angel her sexual and economic marginalisation is
underlined by a comparison with her ex-husband, an upwardly mobile
lawyer, and his new Miss America wife.
The marginalisation, though, is also moral, and Warshawski's sense of
smell for Evil, as highly developed as Miss Marple's and even more
necessary in a blurred and grey world, allows her to sniff out the shady
share-dealing and corporate crime which for her former spouse and his
clients are nothing more than good business.
Paretsky's novels are the current classics of the genre, parables of
their time in the same way as Raymond Chandler's were.
In fact the ghost of Philip Marlowe hovers behind Warshawski in
everything she does. But he is no more than that. He is the template,
and it's not an overstatement to say that Warshawski is a feminist
reincarnation of the old hard-boiled private eye with all the ironies
and poignancies which that invokes.
They patrol the same beat. They're down on the streets in the same
way. Warshawski's penurious, idiosyncratic, and slightly solitary
life-style mirrors his. Her two-week-old dirty washing piles up in the
same way.
She even explicitly refers to him at one point. She berates herself
with the thought, lying bruised and broken after a beating at her
adversary's hands, that Marlowe would have been up and about already and
bent on revenge.
The super-physical Warshawski, taking her beatings like a man, giving
as good as she gets, would appear to be just about as far as it is
possible to get from Miss Marple tucked up in bed with her cocoa, her
hot-water-bottle at her ever-present bad back. Still, what unites them
may be more than what drives them apart.
For Hercule Poirot intuition, if it exists, is merely the conscious
manifestation of subconscious observance. But a person's ability to
observe and what they see depends very much upon the position from which
they're looking.
As Alison Hennegan says: '' . . . those who observe from the
sidelines, from a position of exclusion or subordination, see more, see
differently, see different things . . . '' For just this reason servants
are best placed to know the true character of their employers.
For women, particularly single women, such things as expressions,
inflexions, body language that signals the difference between the spoken
and the thought can all be important. Skilled, by virtue of social and
sexual nicety in play-acting themselves, they are more likely to be able
to spot it in others.
All of which goes some way towards explaining why, when Jane Tennison
says of her prime suspect for no good reason but in the finest tradition
of detective fiction, ''I just don't think he did it,'' we sit up and
take note. Detection Club oath not withstanding.
Carol Clewlow is a novelist. Her latest book, One for the Money,
(Michael Joseph) is out in paperback in August.

WHEN I tapped ''Jacobite women'' into the computer at the university
library, it gave me a succinct answer. There were no entries for that
particular combination. Not even Flora MacDonald was deemed worthy of a
reference.
With all due respect to that lady, the concentration on her story
implies that she was unusual. She was not. Hundreds of women were
actively involved in the Jacobite Rising of 1745.
Some were guilty of nothing more than showing mercy to the wounded. In
the days and weeks following Culloden, every house and cellar in
Inverness was stuffed full of Jacobite prisoners. Anne Leith from
Huntly, a widow with a young son, was scathing about those who were so
''chicken-hearted'' that they were afraid to be seen helping them.
She visited as many as she could, taking food and bandages and
badgering her influential relatives to get better conditions for them --
''demanding the usage due to prisoners of war''. She was arrested at the
point of bayonet, body-searched and interrogated, but she continued with
her visits.
John Gray wrote to her in September 1746 from Southwark Jail, thanking
her for her care of him. His health was better, but the fetters bothered
him and he had the toothache . . .
Anne McKay from Skye had no influential relatives. She also took
succour to the prisoners in Inverness. A plot was hatched by a group of
ladies to rescue Robert Nairn, a prisoner in the cellar of Anne's house.
She decoyed the sentry, and Robert Nairn escaped. In custody in the
guardhouse, Anne was at first offered a bribe of five guineas to tell
who else had been involved. When she contemptuously rejected the money
she was ordered to be kept on her feet in the guardhouse for three days
and three nights, and not allowed to sit or lie down. She told her
interrogators nothing.
The Stuart Cause seems to have had an especial appeal to women. More
than one emulated Isabella Lumsden, who told her lover Robert Strange
that the engagement was off if he didn't join the Prince. Robert went
only to please his beloved, but she did at least save his life
afterwards.
Women at that time wore enormously wide hooped petticoats. The fashion
became so exaggerated that it affected furniture and even architecture.
Inveraray Castle, built in the 1740s, has a staircase on which the
banisters bow out at the bottom, specifically designed to allow the wide
skirts the space they needed. Men ridiculed the fashion, complaining
that it was designed to keep them at a distance, and the Scots Magazine
of June 1745 advertised a pamphlet entitled ''The enormous abufe of the
hoop-petticoat''. Robbie Strange had reason to be grateful for the
vagaries of fashion.
Surprised by a platoon of redcoats at the door and with no time to
find a hiding place, Bella lifted her hooped petticoats and he dived
underneath them. She then sat calmly at her spinning wheel while ''the
confused soldiery ransacked the house.'' He survived to marry Bella and
became Sir Robert Strange, the famous engraver.
Lady Anne Mackintosh was 22 years old at the time of the '45, married
to Aeneas, 22nd Chief of the Mackintoshes. A contemporary observer said
that Anne was ''head over heels'' in love with her husband. Despite
this, when Mackintosh decided to throw in his lot with the Hanoverians,
Anne raised his clan for the Prince.
She criss-crossed the countryside on horseback for a fortnight during
the raising of the regiment. With a pistol in one hand and a bag of
money in the other, and using a mixture of threats and promises, she
managed to persuade 300 men to join up, acquiring the nickname of
''Colonel Anne'' on the way.
She reviewed the men before they left for the Battle of Falkirk in
January 1746. In February she entertained Prince Charles at Moy and it
was here that the famous Rout of Moy took place.
The Dowager Lady Mackintosh, a cousin of the Laird of Mackintosh, sent
word to Anne that Lord Loudon, just 12 miles away in Inverness, had got
wind of the Prince's arrival and was sending a large force to apprehend
him.
Anne sent the blacksmith out to see what could be done. Donald Fraser
had only four men at his disposal, but managed to fool Loudon's troops
into thinking they were up against an army. It was a wild night, thunder
and lightning adding to the atmosphere. Donald Fraser took up his
position by some stacks of peat and got his four comrades to move in and
out of the stacks, calling on imaginary reinforcements to join them.
The ruse worked. The government troops not only retreated, 200 of them
deserted, alarming their officers so much that they retreated over the
Kessock Ferry to wait in Whig-held Ross and Cromarty for the arrival of
Cumberland. Inverness was left wide open and Charlie walked into it
without a shot being fired.
The Jacobites sent out various sorties from Inverness. On one of these
they defeated Lord Loudon's troops near Dornoch, taking the Laird of
Mackintosh prisoner. The Prince released him into Anne's care, saying
that he could not be more secure or more honourably treated. When he was
brought to his wife it was reported that she greeted him ''with military
laconism''.
''Your servant, Captain,'' she said. Her husband was equally polite.
''Your servant, Colonel,'' he replied. After the Rising they lived
together apparently happily for the next 24 years, until Aeneas died in
1770.
A few days after the battle Anne was arrested. She was struck by one
of the soldiers, but another dragged him off, threatening him with
violence, ''if he touched that lady''. As Miss Farquharson, Anne had
once interceded to save him from a flogging.
Another party of dragoons arrived under the command of Sir Everard
Fawkener, Cumberland's secretary and an old admirer of Annes. ''Is that
Anne Farquharson?'' he asked. None the less, he did his duty and
arrested her. She was kept prisoner in Inverness for about six weeks but
was not badly treated. She was, after all, a lady.
Mere women were not so lucky. John Prebble quotes the story of Lord
George Sackville, son of the Duke of Dorset. A ragged band of clansmen
raided his baggage train as he was making his way through the Highlands
in the week after the defeat. Lord George gave vent to his aristocratic
temper at the next clachan. The soldiers were instructed to rape every
woman there while their menfolk were forced to watch. Then, in their
turn, the women were held to watch as their husbands, fathers, brothers,
and sons were shot and bayoneted by the army's finest. Similar stories
abound. Rape was used quite deliberately as a weapon of war, to
humiliate the country and its people.
One lady did, however, suffer physical violence for the Jacobite cause
-- but at the hands of the Bonnie Prince himself. Clementine Walkinshaw
was a Glasgow girl, the youngest of 10 daughters of a fiercely Jacobite
family. She was named for Prince Charlie's mother, the Polish Princess
Clementina Sobieska. The Walkinshaws were an old Renfrewshire family,
''weel connecktit'' and proud of their ancestry, claiming descent from
Robert the Bruce. The family home was the Camlachie Mansion in the
Gallowgate, pulled down in the late 1960s.
Clementine was 25 when the Jacobites occupied a fiercely Hanoverian
and hostile Glasgow over Christmas and New Year 1745. John Campbell,
later fifth Duke of Argyle, and the dashing ''Colonel Jack'' of the
Hanoverian Argyle Militia, is said to have been in love with her but
politics and religion stood between them.
Legend has it that Clementine met Prince Charles at the ball he gave
at the Shawfield Mansion which stood at the foot of present-day
Glassford Street. They became lovers a week or so later at Bannockburn
House, where ''Clemmie'' nursed the Prince when he had a bad cold,
ordering up cinammon and mustard to help alleviate it.
The facts of Clementine's life with Charlie are difficult to
disentangle and shrouded in mystery. Stories are told of a daughter born
from the liaison at Bannockburn House, who died as a young woman in
Finsthwaite, a village near Newby Bridge at the bottom of Lake
Windermere. Known locally as the ''Finsthwaite Princess'', her
gravestone names her as Clementina Johannes Sobiesky Douglass, an alias
often used by the Prince himself.
What we do know for certain is that Clementine did not begin living
with the Prince on the Continent until 1752. She bore him a daughter
Charlotte, later created Duchess of Albany by her father. Clementine
lived with Charles for eight years, until increasingly verbal and
physical abuse forced her to run away, taking Charlotte with her.
Clementine Walkinshaw has had a bad press -- both then and now. Some
Jacobites of the time believed her to be a Hanoverian spy. This
suspicion arose because one of her sisters was employed at the court of
the Hanoverian Prince of Wales in London. Given the impeccable Jacobite
credentials of the Walkinshaw family, the idea that it might have worked
the other way seems not to have occurred to any of her critics. Isabella
Lumsden, in later years Lady Strange, and always a besotted Jacobite,
refused to receive Clementine and Charlotte, called Clementine a ''vile
jade''.
With the honourable exception of her biographer Leo Berry, historians
have been unkind to Clementine. It has been suggested that her
relationship with Charlie turned sour when he found out that she had had
other affairs. There is no historical foundation for this allegation.
Considering Charlie's numerous affairs, the fact that so many (male)
historians offer this almost as a justification for his brutal treatment
of her, is a breathtaking example of the good old double standard in
operation.
He beat her frequently with a stick and was insanely jealous of her.
He also had a nice line in verbal abuse in public, on one occasion
calling her a slut in front of their friends. Clementine's answer has a
quiet dignity. ''Although you are a prince, you are not worthy to be
called a gentleman.''
She died in Switzerland in genteel poverty in 1802, outliving both
Charles and their daughter Charlotte, who lived with her father for the
last three years of his life. Charlotte's son, Count Roehanstart, is
buried in the nave of Dunkeld Cathedral. His grandmother sacrificed
everything for his grandfather -- her good name, her reputation, her
country, and her family, who never forgave her for the disgrace she had
brought on them.
Isabel Haldane was the wife of Charles Stewart of Ardsheal. He was
initially reluctant to lead the Stewarts of Appin to war. She offered
him her apron. He could stay at home and keep house, and she would bring
the men out. Both Isabel and Appin were to suffer greatly for their
support for the Jacobites.
''Green Appin by Loch Linnhe'' was just too close for comfort to the
military garrison at Fort William. Ardsheal, skulking near his house for
some months after the defeat, was an attractive prize, particularly for
the ambitious and sadistic Captain Caroline Frederick Scott. An
Edinburgh man, John Prebble wrote of him that he would not have been out
of place in the Waffen SS.
His cruelties eventually were too much even for some of his own
officers who remonstrated with him. Scott offered the Nuremberg defence.
He knew very well what he was doing, ''which was not without orders''.
Isabel Haldane stood up to him.
No time had been lost in plundering the cattle and sheep of Stewart of
Ardsheal. Isabel appealed to Major-General John Campbell, later fourth
Duke of Argyle, and father of Colonel Jack. A harsh enough man by modern
standards, he returned some of her milk cows, as well as sending her
some oatmeal, ''which I desire you to accept for the use of yourself and
little ones''. Isabel's unhappy situation, John Campbell declared,
''makes my heart aik''.
Caroline Scott returned to Appin in August, when Major-General
Campbell was busy elsewhere, and stripped Ardsheal House bare.
Everything of any value was looted, even the children's school books. He
had the wood panelling taken off the walls and the slates taken off the
roof. Isabel, standing bemused while her house was dismantled about her
ears, was asked for her keys. The gallant Captain then offered her his
hand, led her out of the house, and told her to go. The house was no
longer hers.
She was, however, made of stern stuff. She stayed at Ardsheal and
wrote an impassioned letter to John Campbell, complaining of Scott's
treatment. Her fury shines through as she details all the things that
Scott took, horrified that ''any man especially bred in a civilised
country and in good company could be so free of compassion or anything
at all of the Gentleman to descend to such a low degree of meanness''. A
postcript asks Campbell to excuse the rough paper, ''my friend Captain
Scott having left me none better''.
Ardsheal, father of Isabel's nine children, was meanwhile hiding in a
cave hidden by a waterfall on the hill behind the house. He managed to
spend the odd night with his wife in the barn at Ardsheal. On one
occasion, the warning of approaching redcoats was given too late. Isabel
covered her husband with straw, spread a blanket over it and was sitting
calmly on top of the blanket by the time the soldiers arrived.
Even after Ardsheal left Scotland on a French ship in September 1746,
Scott did not leave Isabel alone. He returned in the December of that
year and put the house to the torch. The only shelter left to Isabel was
a boathouse down by the loch. The night after the burning of her home
she gave birth to a daughter there.
Scott and some of his officers went in to see her the next day. Scott
told her: ''I do think your husband was a great fool to join the rebels
and to leave you and your children without a home.'' Isabel treated his
taunting with the contempt it deserved. Later she was able to rejoin her
husband in Sens, near Champagne. Ardsheal House was rebuilt and is now a
hotel.
Around 80 women were arrested by the authorities after the '45,
including Flora MacDonald, who spent almost a year in custody. Some,
along with their children, were transported to the West Indies. Others
were released, others escaped.
A modern woman might wonder how Colonel Anne dealt with her
conscience. The Mackintoshes were slaughtered at Culloden. Modern woman
might also have qualms about sending her lover off to battle -- or maybe
not. (Remember the send-off when our boys went off to The Falklands?)
We might agree, however, that the strength and dignity with which the
women of the Jacobite era participated in, and coped with, their
turbulent times is worthy of our remembrance and our admiration.

He is without academic honour in the land he has embraced, but John
Prebble is a superb and accessible historian, writes David Ross, and his
contribution deserves recognition.
IN JANUARY Brian Wilson used his column in the West Highland Free
Press to pay tribute to the historian, writer, and broadcaster Ian
Grimble who had just died. He argued that Grimble, author of such works
as The Trial of Patrick Sellar and The World of Robb Donn, had not
received sufficient recognition in Scotland '' . . . where there is
little academic honour awarded those who have preferred truth to the
cover-up, particularly over the history of the Highlands''.
Wilson concluded: ''I was reminded by Grimble's death of a
conversation I had a while back with Jim Hunter, about the similar lack
of recognition accorded to John Prebble -- and in particular the fact
that no Scottish university has had the vision to award him an honorary
degree for his immense services to historical knowledge.
''As a matter of principle, it is long past time for that omission to
be remedied and all of us who care about these matters should say so
with one voice.''
Historian Hunter and MP/journalist Wilson have themselves been
outstanding Highland champions in modern times, but they do not always
agree. On the issue of the hugely popular Prebble, they do speak with
one voice, as Jim Hunter is happy to confirm: ''There is no writer
living who has done more to introduce people, in Scotland and all over
the world, to Scottish history and Highland history in particular.
''John Prebble is a quite marvellous writer, a great stylist whose
work is so accessible. He is a superb historian.
''I have raised the question of an honorary degree at fairly high
levels within our Scottish universities, and I have never received a
satisfactory answer. I simply do not know why John Prebble has not been
honoured.''
Dr Hunter, whose own work has ranged from the seminal The Making of
the Crofting Community to his most recent A Dance Called America, said
that there is hardly an academic historian in Scotland who would admit
Prebble's name to their bibliography. He always does and others, further
afield, are now beginning to as well.
''What has been interesting recently is that Linda Colley, Professor
of History at Yale and widely regarded as an outstandingly original
historian, has produced her marvellous work, Britons Forging the Nation
1707 to 1837.
''In this she draws on John Prebble's work, particularly The King's
Jaunt about George IV's visit to Scotland in 1822. She isn't embarrassed
to admit to having read Prebble.''
In the end, however, it has been John Prebble's preference for
dramatic reconstruction to the systematic analysis demanded by
established traditions of historical scholarship, which has offended.
Earlier this month The Herald caught up with John Prebble, who will be
80 next month. He was holidaying as he has for the past 17 years at Loch
Melfort in Argyll. There, with the islands of Luing and Scarba pointing
south to the Sound of Jura, his obsession with the past was as
infectious as it is in print. But talk about honorary degrees, he said
was both embarrassing and touching.
He thought it would be presumptuous of him to assume that the Scottish
universities should recognise him. He was unrepentant: ''I don't think
of myself as an historian, I am a writer. I write about what interests
me.
''I admire academic scholarship. But I think they can be a bit
arrogant about it and can be their own worst enemies. In order to write
history they scrupulously avoid all the opportunities that literature
gives them.
''They will not use what I call deductive assumption, they will not
use words that arouse emotions in the reader. What they want is an
intellectual reaction. But history has a longer record than that. Julius
Caesar was not beyond writing phrases that aroused the spirit.
''What terrifies me is how historians will treat people like Stalin
and Hitler 200 years from now, dispassionately and bloodlessly, trying
not to raise anger.''
It is Scotland's history which has embraced him, and he it. It has
been good for him. Culloden (first published 1961), Highland Clearances
(1963), and Glencoe (1966) remain the most popular. They have all been
in Penguin paperbacks for the best part of 30 years, and have sold
millions.
They continue to sell: in craftshops; bookshops; chain stores; every
imaginable tourist outlet. But there have been other important books in
which he takes some pride: The Darien Disaster; Mutiny: Highland
Regiments in Revolt; The Lion in the North; and The King's Jaunt.
There was nothing in his own background which would have pointed to
such a life. Indeed, the first he heard of the Scottish Highlands was as
a small boy in a classroom in Sutherland, Saskatchewan.
His parents moved there in 1921 when he was just six. But the better
life proved elusive. The Prairie Provinces were already sliding into the
Great Depression by the time they arrived.
The young Prebble's schooling there was at the hands of a Scots
Canadian, Miss Campbell, whose hero was James Wolfe, ''The Conqueror of
Canada'', and who never tired telling of the role played by the Fraser
Highlanders: ''Although Miss Campbell had never been to Scotland she
spoke of it with an intense pride. Undoubtedly it was in these childhood
years that my interest in the country formed its first imaginative
roots, if only because all that she told us about that far land of mist
and mountain was in so great contrast to the familiar world about us . .
. ''
The family were to return to London, and therafter, as he recalls in
his autobiography, Landscapes and Memories (McVitie book prizewinner in
1993), he was to extend his reading. In 1933, his last year in school he
came across The Lyon in Mourning in which Episcopalian priest, later
Bishop, Robert Forbes painstakingly recorded in 10 volumes the suffering
at Culloden and in its aftermath.
Forbes was a dedicated Jacobite and his work is partisan, exactly the
sort of source material viewed so suspiciously by academic historians.
Prebble defends it to this day. Sixty-two years ago it had a profound
effect on him: ''I read it in the British Museum beneath the awesome
dome of the library. I had early abandoned the bold reason I gave when
applying for a reader's ticket, a proposed biograpghy of Titus Oates,
and I do not think I took out another book during that first year.''
He remembers that by the end of that year ''I was already in love with
a country I had yet to see, and inspired by a history I had yet to
understand''.
There was no reason why he should. His mother had been a London
factory girl and his father a sailor. Neither knew much about their own
past and accepted a High Anglican/Tory tradition. But Prebble came to
look further back. He saw his roots deep in many generations of rural
labourers, his father's people in Kent and his mother's in Hertfordshire
and Essex.
He looked even further back across five-and-half centuries and came to
identify with the agrarian radical tradition, the Peasants' Revolt, even
then one of the few left in England to do so. His empathy for those on
the land is a constant feature in his work whether in Kent in the
fifteenth century or Strathnaver in the nineteenth.
It is part of the man still: ''I would hate to be a farmworker but I
believe that people who have a union with the soil and the country, no
matter how painful or onerous, have a spiritual strength which a nation
loses at its own risk.''
It is hardly suprising that he said he felt ''a very warm glow'' when
he heard that the Assynt crofters had bought the North Lochinver Estate
two-and-a-bit years ago. ''But I would advise the people of Assynt to
look behind every rock because what they are up against is so big, so
implacable.''
From Assynt in the 1990s to Kent of the 1380s and back again, it is
just one of the historical threads that Prebble can spin with such
warmth and humanity. He is always on the side of the common, ordinary
people as they wrestle with the murderous forces of history.
The Glencoe MacDonalds in 1692, the native North Americans in the
nineteenth century, or the children of Europe 50 years ago -- he sees no
difference. Just people who didn't matter.
Despite this he displays an extraordinary empathy for the common
soldier, be he in the Duke of Cumberland's army on its way to Culloden;
a black regiment in the Union Army driving the Comanches from their
homelands; or with him in a truck at the gates of Belsen in 1945.
''Soldiering is a filthy trade, you give it your youth. I gave it six
years.'' His youth had been overshadowed by the prospect of war and the
memory of the Great War. ''What I knew of that obscene struggle, vividly
illustrated in the Photographic History and in the stunning agony of
soldiers' prose and verse, was so terrible that I believed that it could
have been endured by exceptional men only.
''The omnipresent survivors of its horror and betrayal -- a gassed and
yellow-skinned uncle gently coughing over his watch-repairing,
blue-coated and maimed figures seen across the green parks of military
hospitals in the Home Counties, kerbside buskers with greasy ribbons and
tarnished medals -- all these must be superior men from a now broken
mould.''
Hardly surprising, then, that he, like so many of that generation who
refused to accept the established order of things, was to join the
Communist Party, or indeed later that he was to leave it. He didn't
greatly suffer from his period as a party member, although the matter
was raised by Lord Beaverbrook while Prebble was in his employ as a
journalist.
Many of a radical bent found themselves in that state. But while A J P
Taylor was moved to write: ''Beaverbrook's friendship enriched me. The
joys of his company are beyond description'', Prebble could only manage:
''I cannot say I ever liked this man. His generosity was calculated, and
his use of power was accompanied at times by a childish spite which
cured any warmth.''
But a decade before he took the Canadian's shilling, he had finally
made it to Scotland and to the Highlands. At 21 he taken a ship from
Wapping to Leith, a tram to Edinburgh, and a train to Fort William and
then Mallaig. For two weeks he walked around Sunart, Ardnamurchan, and
Moidart. These lands have stayed with him.
In 1959 he came north to Inverness ''to write an article for the
Reader's Digest about tartan or something. It wasn't accepted.'' But he
took the opportunity to visit Culloden battlefield and on impulse
resolved to write about those who had died around him. And the rest is .
. .
So what, if anything, is next? ''I don't know whether I have written
myself out or whether I am getting old. But the last three years have
been stressful. My first wife had Alzheimer's disease and it was very
difficult. I am married again now.
''I have got two books in mind. One is an editing job. My sainted
mother died at the age of 96; when she was 92 she wrote an
autobiography, which I want to put together. She was a little cockney
girl who left school at 11[1/2] and never made a spelling or a
grammatical mistake. I am not altering a word of it, although she didn't
know what a paragraph was.''
The other project he has in mind is a novel about the last day or 12
hours in the life of Mary Queen of Scots ''What happened? Probably not
much.''
That should leave a little time free for the odd graduation ceremony!

DWARFED by the magnificent Minster, and still encircled by its ancient
walls, York is a microcosm of history, architecture, and religion. It
was King George VI who declared that ''the history of York is the
history of England'' and up until the Industrial Revolution it was
second only to London, both in population and importance.
Today, as you walk among the narrow winding streets and lanes of this
wonderfully haphazard city, it becomes evident that this fortress has
been a key player in many major historical events.
The list of characters connected with the city reads like a Who's Who
down the centuries. One of the first was Constantine, who was proclaimed
Roman Emperor of Western Europe at York, the first Christian to hold
such a position. The founder of Constantinople set the trend for the
city's attraction to the notable, and down the centuries both famous and
infamous have passed through the ancient gates or ''bars''.
Guy Fawkes was born here and Dick Turpin was executed here, and the
virtuous Margaret Clitheroe spent her living days in the city. She saved
the lives of many Jesuit priests by harbouring them in her house, which
is now a museum in the ''Shambles''. She was finally canonised in 1970
for her actions, but 400 years earlier her fellow citizens condemned her
to be pressed to death with rocks on the city's Ouse bridge for this
heinous crime.
York is a wonderful city to explore on foot; everything you could wish
to see is a short walk from the Minster, which towers over the city, one
of Northern Europe's largest Gothic cathedrals. From outside, the
structure, which took 250 years to build, is colossal; viewed from the
quiet green oasis of Deans Park it is simply breathtaking.
Inside, however, the spirituality of the place is somewhat muted, with
its spotless interior, uniformed security personnel and an individual
entrance fee for almost everything from the crypt to the tower. In spite
of being over-packaged as a tourist trap, the Minster does have some
remarkable treasures, none more so than the majestic East window, which
at 78ft by 31ft is the world's largest area of medieval stained glass in
a single window.
If you return in the evening, when the crowds have departed and
darkness is spreading within, you will be treated to the sound of choral
evensong as it echoes with the slumbering giant managing to evoke an
atmosphere unobtainable during the garish day.
Beyond the Minster, snaking around the town, are the ancient
fourteenth-century walls which have survived almost completely intact.
Walking round the two-and-a-half mile length of these gives a superb
view of the layout of the city, offering the incongruous experience of
watching twentieth-century life going about its business within a
cramped medieval setting.
The city spreads out in a maze of narrow, twisting streets which are
interwoven in a complex pattern of architecture dating from Roman to
Georgian times. Here you will find the Stonegate, Shambles, Petergate,
Micklegate, and Colliergate, all linked by the Snickleways, a timeless
set of dark passages and alleys that connect the web of streets.
Leaving the wall at Fishergate Tower allows you to return to the city
via the mighty Clifford's Tower. Standing dramatically on an earthen
mound dating from the eleventh century, this stark structure, which
comprises the Keep of York Castle, had a turbulent history. Deriving its
name from Roger de Clifford, whose body was hanged from the battlements
after his execution, it was the tragic setting for the culmination of a
period of shameful anti-semitism in the city.
More than 150 Jews who had sought refuge in the tower chose to die
among the flames which engulfed the keep rather than face starvation or
slaughter at the hands of a rampaging mob.
York has been rightly described as a ''layer cake of architecture'',
for beneath the city's foundations there lies a wealth of history. Early
visitors to the city who have left behind their indelible mark include
the Romans, Vikings, Saxons, and Normans; the hordes who invade the city
walls today are more likely to be sophisticated Japanese, American, and
European tourists.
A visit to Coppergate brings you to the very origins of York at the
highly imaginative Jorvik Viking Centre. Here you can step aboard a time
car and drift back through centuries to experience the sight, sound, and
smell of Jorvik, the Viking Age city uncovered by archaeologists beneath
York. You pass through a bustling market and a busy wharf, and enter a
dark, smoky house where the murmuring sound of Nordic conversation can
be heard. Re-created on the site of the original archaeological dig, it
is a brilliant innovation for young and old which vividly brings history
to life.
The city makes a wonderful destination for a weekend break, with its
numerous hotels only minutes from the city walls. With direct InterCity
rail links from Glasgow and Edinburgh getting you there in three hours
or so, it is maybe best to get there before the July and August crowds
take over, and relax in one of the many famous tea-shops and experience
York at its unhurried best.

MIKE McIntyre would make no claim to poetic prowess, but his nostalgic
sentiments scanned flawlessly: ''I had to get in a boat again, or I felt
that I would die,'' unwittingly evoking echoes of John Masefield's Sea
Fever:
I must go down to the seas again, to the lonely sea and the sky.
The former Olympic yachting gold medallist, McIntyre, from
Helensburgh, who with Bryn Vaile won Star Class gold in the waters off
Pusan at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, had clearly been too long away from
the water.
European Finn champion, and thrice British champion in that class, he
finished seventh in it at the 1984 Olympics. He was mainsheet trimmer on
the crew of Harold Cudmore's 1986 America's Cup yacht, White Crusader;
and after Seoul there was another flirtation with the cup before the
Findhorn club's bid fizzled out; an Admiral's Cup campaign, and then an
attempt on the World Cup for 50-footers, all during holidays.
''But I have hardly been in a boat at all for the past three years,''
confessed McIntyre. ''It was overdue that I concentrated on my career,
so I have been working hard. But sailing is something you cannot give up
lightly or easily. It's such good fun, and I'm quite good at it.
''1991 was the last year I sailed. I did 43 weeks' work, and apart
from a few days at Christmas, all my holidays were spent competing. I
was knackered, and my career was suffering, so I stopped.
But now he has been tempted back, to skipper a yacht in the Vauxhall
Ultra 30 Series which, for three days, beginning on Friday, is being
staged on a spectator-friendly course, between the Tay road and rail
bridges, at Dundee.
The series, three races each day at four venues, involves crews of
nine racing over a tight, one-mile, figure-of-eight course, close to
shore. Collisions are frequent. Following the opening round, at
Portsmouth, McIntyre is lying fourth, behind leader Russell Peters, and
Lawrie Smith. McIntyre won his first comeback race, but managed, like
most of the yachts, to capsize.
''I've watched the event on TV, seen Lawrie winning every year, so I
thought I would come back and try to put one over him,'' said McIntyre.
The 38-year-old Scot never has previously tried to cash in by
obtaining sponsorship on the back of his Olympic title. But Orbitel, the
mobile communications company of which he has been marketing manager for
the past 18 months, own the boat which he has entered.
''We have looked at it as a commercial operation,'' he says. ''The
press and TV coverage, and the fact that I am sailing her, should
justify it.''
McIntyre, 6ft 3in and 14st, is accustomed to sporting success. Though
born in Glasgow, he spent his early years in Kenya, where his father, a
professor of veterinary medicine, was working. He became national
under-11 back-stroke champion there, and when the family moved back to
Scotland, he won the national under-12 title, and was a schoolboy
swimming internationalist.
He learned rugby at Hutchesons' Grammar School, and played flanker or
No.8, for Helensburgh, Dunbartonshire, and Glasgow District. His sailing
career began at 17, in Mirror dinghies, with Helensburgh Sailing Club,
under whose burgee he still sails.
He graduated with honours in electronics from Glasgow University, and
after having moved south to further his sailing, was twice selected for
Dorset and Wiltshire's under-23 XV.
Success in Seoul was one of the more magical Olympic stories, but as
it occurred on the same day as Ben Johnson's drug positive was
announced, it was somewhat overshadowed.
He and Vaile had to win the final race, with the USA and Brazil no
better than fifth and fourth. A 30-knot wind and 10-foot waves lashed
Suyong Bay, and a full moon was shining before McIntyre helmed the boat
to victory by just two lengths, with the crucial opposition sufficiently
adrift.
Vaile, who suffered from a rare eye disease, was almost blind until he
received a cornea graft. He wore protective goggles to prevent heavy
seas crashing into the eye.
McIntyre had been helming the British one-ton Admiral's Cup yacht,
Juno, in pre-Olympic season when his two-year-old son, Angus, developed
a brain tumour. Devastated, McIntyre did not sail again that year.
It was already well into Olympic year before Vaile asked McIntyre if
he would helm a boat he had managed to borrow -- a class McIntyre had
never sailed. Yet with only months' experience together, under-funded,
and as the only wholly amateur crew in that class at the Games, they won
the sport's biggest prize.
Weekend yachtsmen love them because they showed that one can win at
the highest level without going full-time. But McIntyre has often
agonized subsequently over the attractions of a professional sailing
career. ''I figured there really wasn't much scope -- not the right
market in the UK, and that with what there was, I wouldn't make much of
a living.''
''Even when Bryn and I tried to mount an Olympic bid in 1992, we could
not raise the funds. It would have cost us a minimum of #15,000 each.
''Besides, I'm a bit canny -- a percentage player. That's the way I
win my races. Trying to make a living as a sailor is a leap into the
abyss -- a hand-to-mouth existence. It has its attractions -- it's fine
when you are in your twenties, single, and have nothing to lose or
sacrifice. But with a family, mortgage, and responsibilities, it's
different.
''I couldn't say there are no regrets about not having tried -- there
always will be, I guess. You wonder what might have happened if you had
followed another tack.''
Angus is 10 now, and, thankfully, in good health. Mike and his wife
have two other children, Gemma, aged seven, and Eilidh, one.
Such complications do not guarantee McIntyre's future absence from
sailing. ''I could see myself getting involved in an America's Cup
campaign, if Britain could put a viable one together. But it's a 12-year
learning curve, as New Zealand have shown.
''Dundee is just me putting my toe back in the water. I'm not
navigating to part of any grand plan. An Olympic campaign for Atlanta is
most unlikely.''
McIntyre is the Royal Yachting Association's chairman of the British
Olympic Association steering group, effectively the man in charge of the
UK sailing team. He has given a four-year commitment to the job. To
become a team contender, would have to jump ship.
The Ultra 30 Series in Dundee begin at 11.45 on Friday, 12.45 on
Saturday and 1.30 on Sunday.
''I could see myself getting involved in an America's Cup campaign, if
Britain could put a viable one together''

ENGLAND wing Tony Underwood is squaring up to the biggest physical
confrontation of his career as he prepares to take on giant Jonah Lomu
in tomorrow's World Cup semi-final with New Zealand.
0 The younger Underwood brother has known for a week that he would be
matched with Lomu, who has the dimensions of a lock at 19st and 6ft 5in.
But the England man said: ''We all have the right mental attitude for
this match. I have been never been physically intimidated by anyone and
I won't be now.
''I am looking forward to taking on the All Blacks and Lomu, and if he
is in front of me when I have the ball in my hands he will have problems
of his own.
''I am boosted by the fact that I have the confidence of my peers and
the selectors. I have talked with my brother, Rory, and the other
players in the squad.
''Of course it is a challenge, but you don't back down from challenges
in Test matches. Extra confidence is added because England are playing
the best rugby since I came into the side two-and-a-half years ago.''
Underwood was given a public boost by captain Will Carling, who said:
''Tony has always enjoyed it when he has got the ball in his hands and
Lomu will be fairly worried if Tony starts using his electrifying pace
at him.''
Forward Tim Rodber added: ''Tony is a world-class wing. We have tons
of plans for dealing with Lomu, including stopping him getting the ball
or forcing it back inside where some of our big forwards will be waiting
for him.''
England manager Jack Rowell said: ''Our aim is to impose our style on
New Zealand, including Lomu.''
That means plenty of kicking from man-of-the-moment Rob Andrew, whose
boot was responsible for 20 points against the Wallabies.
Andrew said: ''We don't fear anybody. We are getting our game together
at the right time, though New Zealand are the form team of the
tournament.''
England's forwards, led by Brian Moore, will have an overall physical
advantage -- not in the front row, where it seldom matters, but
certainly in the back five where the four big men, Martin Johnson,
Martin Bayfield, Tim Rodber, and Ben Clarke, will outweigh their rivals.
Clarke or Rodber running the ball at one of the All Blacks' newer
stars, stand-off Andrew Mehrtens, will be a key area of the game.
But it is all likely to come down to penalties on the day and England
need Andrew to retain the phenomenal form he has shown with 227 of
England's last 393 points in his most recent 13 matches.
Andrew yesterday dismissed speculation that he will be quitting
international rugby after the World Cup.

SHIRLEY Robertson, likely to be the first Scot named for the Olympics,
is already preparing in a heat chamber, which she has christened the
Savannah Sauna.
Sailing, whose Olympic trials are at Weymouth in August, will then
name its squad for next year's Games. The 26-year-old from Menstrie has
been ranked world No.1 for most of the past 20 months, partly thanks to
backing from Pringle, and Miller Engineering.
She has slipped back to second recently. ''I haven't contested world
events, because it is important to prepare for domestic conditions at
the trials,'' she says.
Robertson has already made a pre-Olympic trip to the Savannah venue.
''Heat -- at 100[DEG] -- and humidity, 80%, were horrific. So I've been
training on a bike in an acclimatisation chamber.''
She currently is contesting the Eurolymp Regatta at Hayling Island,
the last domestic pre-trial event, and with three wins from six starts,
and the final two races today, tops the standings.

But there's nothing sleepy about these bold and distinctive new bed
designs, says Wendy Jack
AND so to bed . . . The end of another frantic day should, ideally,
herald retiring to a bedroom which is a pleasure to be in -- attractive
to look at, comfortable and relaxing.
Too often, bedrooms are the Cinderella rooms in houses -- which
doesn't make much sense considering that we spend about a third of our
lives in them. Frequently, a bedroom is not merely a place where we
sleep, but a refuge where we can sit, or read or watch TV in peace and
quiet.
The bed of course, is the important piece of furniture in the room.
Its suitability to the individual's needs will dictate to a large extent
whether he or she rises refreshed and free of aches and pains each
morning.
Never buy a new bed without lying on it, along with the person who
will share it, to make sure it feels right in terms of firmness, support
and so on.
Aesthetically, the bedstead as a piece of furniture can be in any
style from the simplest cottagey pine, through solid, handsomely carved
wood to plain or ornate metals, as just a few examples.
Recently introduced to Scotland and exclusive to Sterlings at
Tillicoultry, is the Lineage (pronounced linnege) range of American
furniture, which includes some unusual and striking designs for
bedrooms.
A couple of its four-posters are innovatively styled to dispense with
drapes -- which some find claustrophobic. Instead, they have either the
unadorned framework, or important-looking elongated ''bedposts'' at each
corner.
From the same store, Timberlake is another American designer offering
highly distinctive pieces of great elegance and character, well worth a
look.
Totally different again is Isle of Bute-based Bear Factory's
four-poster bed, in steel tubing and steel flat bar, which is exposed to
the elements before being specially treated by owner Jules Goss, to give
it a distinctive aged patina.
David Howell, design director at Linda Reid Plus, says: ''We wanted
away from more conventional four posters, and Jules makes beds to our
exclusive design, to suit different clients. The Sunburst motif for
instance, at one bedhead, is also a light, and there's a range of
matching accessories from mirror and screen to a TV and video stand.''
Creating a brilliant bedroom is clearly a matter of personal taste.
While one person will love the traditional solidity of mature timbers
polished to a warm glow, another will fall only for delicate lines and
pale tones, or the undemanding simplicity of light, plain wood such as
pine with its fresh, country appeal. Pay your money and take your pick.
But when space allows, adding a couple of chairs or a sofa, perhaps a
desk or table to write at, a bedroom can become an intimate, private
sitting room. Scottish interior designer Pat Moretti and her husband
have just such a bedroom, with a cosy, living flame fire and a sofa to
snuggle into on chilly winter nights.
Bedlinen too, is largely a matter of personal preference. Some people
never go past florals, while others can't bear them. Stripes and checks
usually look fresh and crisp and have the advantage of bridging gaps,
often marrying happily with other patterns, as well as appealing to
single men who usually want to avoid the more feminine designs at all
costs.

Their chalet-style homes are not mobile anyway. But even if they were,
the residents of Craigendmuir Park would be happy just to stay put,
writes Beverley Brown
* WHAT would be your reaction if you heard of a detached home with
large lounge, fitted breakfasting kitchen, three bedrooms, one with
en-suite bathroom, family bathroom, central heating and double glazing
for #17,500? Probably disbelief.
Yet that is what Jim and Anne Connor have just paid for their
residential mobile home in Stepps, on the outskirts of Glasgow.
Theirs is one of more than 100 residential houses in Craigendmuir
Park. But the term mobile home is misleading. With not a wheel in sight,
these pristine houses look very similar to chalet-style bungalows. Each
is situated in its own fenced-off area of ground, on the edge of open
countryside, and every one is different.
Many of the park's residents have lived here for years and few would
even consider leaving what has become a very close-knit community. The
Connors' new house is their third move within the park. ''After we sold
the last one we did move away, but came back eight weeks later when we
realised that everything we wanted was right here,'' says Jim.
Moving up instead of out is a regular trend at Craigendmuir. Harry and
Catherine have been on the site for 15 years. With five children, they
started out in a two-bedroom mobile home, moved to a three-bedroom and
then bought the largest one on the park -- a four-bedroom house with
separate kitchen, en-suite bathroom, family/TV room, bathroom and large
lounge with patio doors. Their present home is valued at #36,000.
''Living in the park is just like being in a small village,'' says
Catherine. ''Everyone knows each other and it's a very safe environment
for children. When my mum comes to visit, she always says she feels as
if she is on holiday -- and she only lives a few miles away,'' she
laughs.
The park attracts all age groups, from young first-time buyers to
retired couples. And it has its own amenities; a large site shop is open
every day from 7.30am until 9.30pm, 8am to 8.30pm on Sundays, and stocks
everything from tinned/frozen food, newspapers, videos, lampshades and
knitting wool, to an off-sales.
They also have their own football team, Garnkirk United.
Bill and Isobel Clelland moved into the park in 1992 after Bill
retired. They sold their stone-built home in nearby Cardowan and bought
a mobile home in the park for #9500. A further #3000 was spent fitting
out the kitchen, installing gas central heating, double glazing and
having a porch built.
Now they have a comfortable, two-bedroom home that's easy on housework
and very economical to run. ''Our heating bills are now half what they
were in our previous house,'' says Bill, ''and these homes are so
versatile. With no supporting walls, you can change the internal layout
to suit your needs,'' he added.
Maintenance is essential, as without care, the lifespan of a mobile
home could be as little as 20 years. ''That's if you were to do nothing
at all,'' says Bill, ''but provided you keep the roof and external
woodwork in good condition, they will last 30 years or more.''
Help is never far away either, as many of the locals are tradesmen and
everyone mucks in to lend a hand if a job needs doing.
The Clellands have opted for an immaculate, easy-to-keep garden that
is paved and chipped, with pot plants providing colour. But the gardens
are just as individual as the houses; a few doors along from Bill is
what's fondly known as gnome city -- a manicured garden with literally
hundreds of gnomes.
Nearby is Sheila and John Kormoski's pretty blue-and-white home, which
sports an American eagle on the front wall. After spending most of their
lives in the USA, the Kormoskis decided to retire to Scotland. Sheila's
family live in Muirhead, and as residential parks are widespread in the
USA, they had no hesitation in snapping up their present two-bedroom
mobile home for just #13,000.
Craigendmuir Park's success is largely due to its resident owners;
Martin Moore and his sister took over the management of the park when
their father, Peter, died two years ago. Their mother, Martha, is 77 but
still plays an active role in what has always been a family business.
She lives in a mobile home herself.
The Moore family bought the land in 1952 when it was a pig farm. A few
years later they obtained a license for 14 mobile homes and the numbers
have steadily grown over the years. ''The residents own their own homes
but each pays #40 a month ground rent,'' says Martin. ''It's a large
site and it takes a long time to do everything, particularly as we now
also cater for touring caravans and campers.
''But it's a family business and we are always on hand, just as my
father was.''
Martha and Martin personally interview buyers before they will
consider the sale or re-sale of a mobile home and in over 40 years, only
two families have been asked to leave the park.
With these mobile homes, seeing is believing. Each has all of the
features you would expect in a luxury property, but at a fraction of the
price. Add peaceful surroundings, easy commuting and the type of social
environment reminiscent of Glasgow tenements, and it is easy to
understand Craigendmuir Park's appeal.
Harder to understand is why this particular recipe has remained
unique.

* IT'S moving towards the summer and the nights are getting balmier.
You, on the other hand, are getting barmier. Suddenly, you seem to be
sharing your bedroom with things that fly, flit, hum and hover. Insects,
aka creepy crawlies. You know that they are just waiting for you to turn
unconscious so that they can . . . aargh!
As you slide into sleep, a piece of useless information resurfaces in
your twitching brain. It was Louis Pasteur, the father of modern
bacteriology, who scientifically refuted the principle of abiogenesis.
He proved that living things cannot rise without feeding from other
living things. This theory is still argued against by other theosophists
and sectarians, but nevertheless (buzz) . . . aargh!
Bugs are only one of the pestilences of the average Scottish summer.
No summer seems to be so bad that the bugs fail to hatch out, to
side-step the principle of abiogenesis, and to feed on whatever living
things take their fancy and are to hand. This often means you.
Particularly at night.
Normally the average sleeping Scot's response to the circling, buzzing
night-insect is red-blooded. It is to get up, roll up a newspaper (and
Scots being avid readers, rarely go to bed without a newspaper) and blat
the insect out of existence.
For this they need a wall, against which the beastie can be blatted.
This is where the red-blooded bit comes in. It is the mark left on the
wall. The only way to counteract this is blood-coloured wallpaper in the
bedroom; but unfortunately one of the downsides of blood-coloured
wallpaper is that it's not inducive to a good night's sleep in the first
place.
Then there's the commandment that ''Thou shalt not kill''. This is a
hopelessly open-ended contract. It doesn't specify exactly what thou
shouldst not kill, while other commandments (againt adultery,
covetousness etc) go into detail about neighbours' wives, oxen, asses
and so on.
I have heard of people who are so conscientious that they will kill
nothing, and will empty their bath rather than allow the inevitable
spider to drown. But I have yet to meet one. In particular, I have never
met anyone who -- waking up in the middle of the night and finding a
mosquito on their nose -- will let it take its beastly fill rather than
swatting it into the hereafter.
But I have heard of somebody who designed a device to deal with this
intractable problem. It was a schoolchild, of course, and therefore an
idealist as well as an inventor. The idea was to couple a small
lampshade, and then a fine-mesh net, to the hose of a vacuum cleaner.
When a flying bug is detected in the bedroom, the potential meal
should rise from the bed, switch on the vacuum cleaner and direct the
lampshade towards the insect, which would then be sucked into the fine
mesh net, alive. The insect could then be, as they say, released into
the community. Although outside the window.
All right; I do see the problems. One is that the solution does not
give you an unbroken night's sleep; and the other is that the neighbours
will speculate unfavourably about you when they hear the Hoover starting
up at 3am. But there is an eleventh commandment: You can't win them all.

* THE only thing wrong with azaleas is that, while they flower
magnificently, it is all over far too quickly. Then, all you have to
look at is leaves. This is not true of a great many shrubs. The trick is
to select a range of them, so that you have something in flower for
every month of the year.
This opens the door to a fascinating range of possibilities. Many
years ago, if you wanted to do anything about shrub-planting, you had to
wait for autumn or early spring for bare root specimens. Now there are
container specimens all the time. Here is a selection for year-round
colour:
* December/January -- Chimonanthus fragrans, brownish-yellow (6-8ft);
Daphne mezereum, purplish-red (3-4ft); Erica carnea, rosy pink (1ft);
Erica carnea alba, white (1ft); Garrya eliptica, silvery yellow,
greenish white (10-12ft); Hamamelis mollis, yellow (8-10ft); Jasminum
nudiflorum, yellow (6-10ft); Viburnum tinus, white or pink (8ft).
* February/March -- Azara microphylla, yellow (6-10ft); Berberis
japonica, yellow (10ft); Cornus Mas, yellow (10-25ft); Cydonia japonica,
scarlet, yellow, pink, white (4-9ft); Magnolia stellata, white
(10-12ft); Ulex europaeus, golden (3-5ft).
* April -- Berberis Darwinii, yellow (8-12ft); Cytisus praecox, yellow
(6ft); Forsythia intermedia spectabilis, yellow (8ft); Prunus triloba,
pink (10-15ft); Viburnum Carlesii, white (3-4ft).
* May -- Berberis stenophylla, yellow (6-10ft); Ceanothus dentatus,
blue, lilac (12-20ft); Deutzia, white, rose, purple (3-12ft); Diervilla,
white, pink, rose, crimson (4-6ft); Kalmia glauca, purplish-rose (2ft);
Laburnum alpinum, yellow (20-30ft); Rhododendron/azalea, various
(1-18ft).
* June -- Berberis polyantha, yellow (5-9ft);Clematis, various
(5-20ft); Philadelphus, white (3-15ft); Rosa, various (1-10ft); Viburnum
tomentosum pileatum, white (5-10ft).
* July -- Calluna vulgaris, crimson, white (2ft); Ceanothus Gloire de
Versailles, lavender (4-5ft); Cistus, red, white (2-8ft); Erica
ciliaris, mauve, white (2-4ft); Potentilla, white, yellow (1-4ft);
Senecio compactus, yellow (2-23ft); Spiraea discolor, creamy-white
(10-15ft); Veronica Traversii, white (to 5ft).
* August -- Buddleia variabilis, lilac (10-20ft); Hydrangea
paniculata, creamy white (3-6ft); Spiraea japonica Anthony Waterer,
crimson (2-3ft); Yucca gloriosa, greenish white (6-9ft).
* September/October -- Ceanothus hybrid, red, blue (3-8ft); Fuchsia,
purple, red (5-7ft); Osmanthus aquifolium, white (4-10ft); Romneya
Coulteri, white, (5-8ft).
* November/December -- Arbutus unedo, white, pink (10-30ft); Erica
darleyensis, rose (1-2ft).

* EVERYONE, it seems, would love to have an extra room in their home,
especially during the summer when friends and their families come to
stay overnight or for a few days.
One way round this is to buy a sofa bed, so that a sitting room or
study can quickly become a guest bedroom.
Originally made with fold-out foam seats, sofa beds were developed
into metal-framed designs which at least meant you didn't have to get
down on your hands and knees to go to bed. These designs still exist, of
course, and you will find a good selection at the budget end of the
market in stores such as Ikea, whose prices start at under #200.
But sofa beds have come a long way in recent years, and if you plan to
use the bed for anything other than the odd night, you should consider
spending more money. And if, like many continental Europeans, you use
the bed day in and day out, then dig as deep as your pocket will allow,
and find yourself a bed as comfortable and long-lasting as any
single-use bed on the market.
Sofa beds tend to be somewhat firmer to sit on than ordinary sofas,
because of the substructure. Check first that you will be comfortable
enough sitting on it -- that, after all, is likely to be its main use.
But the main problem is size. Start with a sofa that measures 5ft 6in
across including, say, scrolled arms. Deduct a foot for the arms, then
another three inches either side to allow for the bed's swing-out
mechanism, and suddenly you are down to a meagre four feet. This is
narrow for a couple, especially if they are used to a modern king-size
bed.
One of the neatest solutions to this problem which I have seen is the
Ligne Roset design, Multy. Its simple, clean lines would look good in
many rooms, but it is the ease of conversion and the comfort of the
night-bed which attract.
Simply pull out a sliding extension -- which converts the sofa into
the intermediate stage of a chaise longue -- then click back the
mechanism and the bed folds flat. The cover unzips and becomes a duvet,
the back cushions become your pillows.
Underneath the 3in-dense foam mattress are beech slats for real
comfort. This is modern design at its best -- ingenious, simple and
totally functional. The width of the sofa -- 5ft -- is also the full
width of the bed. Multy comes in a wide range of fabrics, some
completely washable so that you can simply throw them in the machine.
You can also buy side tables and arms for the complete look. The small
sofa (131cm wide) costs from #900 and the large (166cm wide) from #1200,
depending on fabric, and may be ordered through Tony Walker Interiors.
Similar in concept but lacking the elegance of the French design is
Atlanta by Slumberland, one of the few sofa beds on the market actually
designed by a bed manufacturer. Atlanta has a fully sprung mattress but
is rather narrow at 4ft. It works by squeezing the folded back parts
together, then releasing them, and is somewhat awkward to manipulate. It
costs from #442 through Lorimer and Beetham, Churchill, Edinburgh.
There are few single chair beds available, though Lorimer and Beetham
have a good selection. The same problems tend to occur as with sofa beds
-- the width of the mattress is often on the skimpy side, 2ft 6in
instead of 3ft. However, the Nehl Cindy incorporates the same excellent
design features as the larger bed, and the chair is very comfortable to
sit on. Prices start at #498.
When you are choosing the covering fabric, give some thought to the
wear and tear of constant movement. Slight creasing can occur which can
look unsightly with a plain fabric. It is less noticeable with
patterened fabrics though perhaps the ideal solution is to plump for
shabby chic, the fashionable casual look.
If you choose Alston's Nevada sofa bed, for example, you can order
from an excellent range of fabrics from traditional brocades to
contemporary stripes and checks -- or even denim.
The Rousseau and the Hogarth by Duresta, available from John Lewis,
are traditional sofas on a grand scale, available in a range of fabrics
including damask and complete with tassels and trims. If you have a very
large room -- and a good budget -- this could be the answer. The
three-seater will give you a good size bed, but it measures 7ft 5in
across and could cost up to #2075 depending on your choice of fabric.
Both models also come in a smaller, two-seater, size.
One of the most elegant solutions to the double-use problem I have
come across is Laura Ashley's Milton Daybed, a dream of a design with
elegant black metal ends and back.
This is not a pull-out or a fold up, it is, just as it says, a day
bed. Heap it with cushions and you can use it quite comfortably as a
sofa during the day. Toss them into a corner and add a duvet and you are
all set to snuggle down for the night. The price looks good at #395 for
the frame, but add on #150 for the mattress, anything from #115 to #165
for the mattress cover and up to #105 for a pair of bolster cushions,
and it all begins to look costly.
I would also hesitate to use it where there are small children around
-- but for sheer elegance, it gets my vote.

They don't burst and they don't leak. WENDY JACK finds out about water
beds
* IF long nights on the ocean wave appeal to you, how about drifting
off to sleep on a seven-foot circular water bed?
Interestingly enough, Ian Johnston, who owns Waterbed World in Glasgow
-- which specialises in water beds -- reports that most of the
grand-scale round beds that he sells go to single girls . . . an
innovative update on viewing the etchings, perhaps?
But the main demand for beds which offer nights afloat comes,
apparently, from those with bad backs. ''Water beds are,'' says
Johnston, ''the only type of bed which can be VAT zero-rated for those
who are registered disabled or are on immobility benefit.''
Hospitals use them, he explains, for patients with a variety of
medical conditions, including severe burns. Medical studies have shown
that the equal distribution of body-weight, as occurs on a water bed, is
beneficial to all -- especially arthritics and rheumatics.
''People don't toss and turn on them in the way they do on ordinary
beds,'' Ian Johnston says. ''The water supports the body weight -- much
a Lilo on water. People have to get used to the weightless feeling when
they first buy a water bed; it is really comfortable for anyone and
adjusts to individual body contours.''
Johnston's range, for double or slightly larger beds, is priced from
around #450 to #1500 for a seven-foot circular model. Of old rumours,
such as modern homes being unable to take the weight, or beds springing
leaks, he laughs: ''Such fears aren't founded on fact. They can never
burst, and each bed is surrounded by a vinyl safety liner to contain
water should the bed be punctured -- which is rare -- and the mattress
can be repaired.''
The beds arrive flat-packed and are filled with about 120 gallons of
water for a double, in situ. The only maintenance required is a
six-monthly top-up with a bottle of condition.
There are two types of water bed: hard sided, which incorporate a
rigid frame usually made of either wood or medium-density fibreboard, or
soft-sided with a foam cushion edge.
Water beds will never sag, nor will they produce problems such as dust
mites, making them well worth considering for asthmatics.
Finally, Ian Johnston recalls one couple who bought a water bed from
him and were later unfortunate enough to have their home destroyed by
fire. ''The only piece of furniture that survived was their water bed.''

JOHN Salako yesterday shocked Newcastle fans by pulling out of his
proposed #2m move to St James' Park at the last minute.
The 26-year-old former England winger had travelled to Tyneside for
talks with Newcastle manager Kevin Keegan.
Salako's decision stunned the Newcastle fans, some 80 of whom had
already gathered at the club to welcome the new man to the North East
and who were left wondering what had happened.
Keegan, having already landed Les Ferdinand for #6m from Queen's Park
Rangers and Warren Barton for #4m from Wimbledon, saw Salako -- whose
career has been plagued by injuries -- as the ideal man to restore the
shape of his team.
That might have spelled the end of Ruel Fox's St James' Park career
only 16 months after his #2.25m arrival from Norwich, with Blackburn or
newly-promoted Middlesbrough understood to be keen on him.

NICK Faldo and Bernhard Langer breathed some life into the European
challenge yesterday in the second round of the US Open Championship at
Shinnecock Hills. With scores of 68 and 67, they were within five and
six strokes respectively of the leader, Greg Norman, whose own score
Langer matched as the day's best.
Norman, who nine years ago here led after both the second and third
rounds, returned to the head of affairs with his total of 135, five
under par -- two strokes ahead of the least likely of possible pursuers,
the 48-year-old Japanese professional, Masashi ''Jumbo'' Ozaki, the
winner of no fewer than 88 tournaments in his native country.
Had Faldo not pulled his final drive into deep rough he probably would
have equalled the scores of Norman and Langer. But in his quest for this
title, as if it was a personal holy grail, Faldo was able to go into the
weekend believing that his game was improving all the time as his
collection of four birdies suggested.
Langer, eighth in 1986, scrambled effectively and putted more
consistently to achieve that rare feat, a bogey-free round. He had one
decidedly fortunate escape, hitting a recovery through a gap in a bush
at the fourteenth to within 12 feet of the hole and making the putt to
save par.
As Nick Price, the Open and USPGA champion and the leader overnight on
four under, declined to a 73 to lie four strokes behind Norman, the
left-hander Phil Mickelson and Bob Tway, a former USPGA champion who was
a winner again this season after five barren years, were on 138, a
stroke ahead of Bill Glasson, the only other player below par.
Faldo believes that as the course continues to firm up under hot
sunshine, strategy will be all-important during the last two rounds. So
far, Norman has shown all the qualities necessary to negotiate the
6944-yard course with its inherent hazards of wonderfully strategic
bunkering and dense rough reinforced by the sea winds.
Norman has had only two bogeys in 36 holes, both yesterday, and if he
cannot now achieve his maximum performance rating of 10 -- completing
four rounds without loss -- that would hardly matter if he won the
title. That flat out swing was under control and he patiently waited and
took his openings for five birdies.
Two of these were particularly impressive. At the last, Norman, using
a professional's technique that would frighten the life out of any
handicapper, bladed the ball resting against fringe grass with his sand
iron and it ran down a slope 20 feet into the hole.
The other was the No.7 iron that he hit 20 inches from the third hole.
Ozaki finished his round with a birdie but whereas Mickelson, a
notoriously streaky player, has had nine birdies against five bogeys and
a double bogey, Tway has been more disciplined with four birdies to
offset only two bogeys.
Glasson's 69 included a 40-yard pitch holed for an eagle 3 at the long
fifth.
While Mark Roe, in his first appearance, surprisingly joined Faldo on
140 at a slightly greater remove Jose-Maria Olazabal, with a 70, and Ian
Woosnam, another former Masters champion, with 71, moved up into
contention. Miguel Angel Jiminez, also in his first appearance, and,
somewhat less convincingly, Colin Montgomerie and Barry Lane, survived
the cut which fell at 146, six over par.
Montgomerie had one of those days when nothing went right. ''I didn't
drive or hit my irons well and my chipping and putting were no better,''
he acknowledged and, as if this was not enough to bring an audible cry
of frustration when a seven-foot putt at the third refused, Montgomerie
also was involved in a slow play warning.
''With my being in trouble at the second and fourth, our group (which
also included Mickelson and Tom Lehman) fell seven minutes behind,''
Montgomerie explained. ''Unaware of this, Tom answered a call of nature
at the fourth and when he lost a ball at the next we had lost another
five minutes.''
At that juncture Michael Bonallack, the secretary of the Royal and
Ancient Club, who is on rules duty this week, drove out to issue an
official warning. But this was subsequently withdrawn at the eighth
hole, by which time the group had caught up and recovered their position
on the course.
Olazabal completed a remarkable salvage operation and then disclosed
he will need further surgery on the foot injury which has been causing
him discomfort this season. Apparently self-destructing after he had
begun his first round with five successive bogeys, he turned in 41, came
home in 32, and continued the good work with a 70 comprising a birdie, a
bogey, and 16 pars.
Among those who did not survive the cut were the defending champion
Ernie Els, Severiano Ballesteros, and Jack Nicklaus, whose 81 was 10
strokes higher than his opening round. Els was never in sight of staying
alive but perhaps the conditions meted out the cruellest punishment of
David Gilford.
The Ryder Cup player was one over par at the turn, out in 32 and
comfortably in sight of qualifying, when the wheels spectacularly came
off. A quadruple bogey 9 at the twelfth was followed by two double
bogeys, a 6 and a 7 at the fifteenth and long sixteenth and the addition
came to a demoralising 44 home.
Ballesteros was, in fact, simply relieved to have been able to
complete 36 holes, for on Friday of last week he developed a painful
back and considered withdrawing. ''I was quitting on almost every
shot,'' he said in explaining this lastest performance in an event that
has never suited his flamboyant style of play.
Elsewhere, Tiger Woods, the US amateur champion, withdrew because of a
wrist injury after five holes, at which point he was eight over for the
tournament. The 19-year-old player, the youngest in the field, is,
however, expected to be playing again in a week's time and his visit to
Scotland next month should not be affected.

It's not easy to set up the help network before you go, warns Ian
Walls
* HOLIDAY time is fast approaching -- if you are not already away --
bringing with it not only heady anticipation but also the tricky
headache of what to do about your garden while you live it up for a
couple of weeks.
It's tempting to enlist the help of a neighbour -- on a reciprocal
basis, of course -- but you might have to be just as trusting as you are
grateful. If the neighbour is no expert who is confident about little
more than keeping the lawn in check (though this is important) he or she
will have to be briefed in some detail about the unique quirks of your
garden.
And some things are a lot to ask as favours. You can't expect a
neighbour to toil at your edges for hours, for instance. So hired help
might be most honourable way out -- a small price to pay, perhaps, for
an easier conscience as you turn on the beach.
A combination of neighbour, paid help, family and a trusted friend can
spread the load, though the work rota could be a little tiresome to set
up. A good friend who is mobile and able to call round regularly, for
example, can overcome the real challenge of keeping the greenhouse
running.
It doesn't take more than a day of drought in a greenhouse to bring
about disaster. With tomatoes or cucumbers, a day or so without water
can mean the end of their useful lives.
Automatic vents help greatly and you can get away without any help if
you have watering systems. A modern time-controlled system is the best
answer, managing the plants without human intervention. It is a
long-term investment, but most watering equipment will last for years.
As for any fruit, flowers and vegetables which become ready for use
during the holiday -- this is where the family helpers come in, as you
won't mind their harvesting and consuming the goodies . . . will you?
Pot plants are better gathered together, in a shady spot. Some people
put them into the bath, lined with very soggy paper.
If it is reasonably shady, the paper should not dry out too quickly.
The problem of putting water into the bath is its sloping nature, which
means the water is not an even depth.
If you can't get someone to come to the garden, perhaps the you can
find a volunteer to take your plants away during your absence. Your
garden will still be there when you get back. A lot weedier, but still
there.

* I WAS consumed with gardener's envy -- of someone else's climate --
when a splendid box labelled ''Guernsey Flowers'' came by post the other
day. Just lifting the lid brought back distant memories of the warm and
wet island of Guernsey, writes LEILA AITKEN.
Guernsey is dripping with flowers at this time of year, and you can
now enjoy them by ordering direct from Guernsey Flowers Ltd, which has a
special offer from now until the end of September of a Summer Pastels
Bouquet. It contains 5 alstroemeria, 5 freesia, 10 spray carnations, 10
luxury carnations, gypsophila and fern. It costs #16.99, which includes
postage and co-ordinated ribbons.
Although the blooms are packed with their stems in damp wadding and
are wired so that they cannot slide around inside the box, like anyone
else after a long journey, they need a long drink. Cut about an inch
from the stem ends, dissolve the flower food provided in tepid water,
and stand the flowers in this for at least two hours.
A raised container such as a candlestick or small pedestal shows off
summer flowers really well, and gives a light, airy effect.
To make the arrangement in the picture you will need: a tall
candlestick; a candlecup; half a large rectangular block of oasis and
oasis tape.
Foliage: Escallonia, apple blossom; Senecio greyii; variegated ivy;
fern; hosta leaves.
Flowers: those listed above.
Wedge the candlecup in the neck of the candlestick. Press the soaked
oasis firmly into the candlecup, trimming off the corners. Secure with
oasis tape.
Insert curving sprigs of Escallonia to each side of the oasis to form
an inverted crescent. Add shorter lengths to determine the height at the
top. Add the senecio, following the outline, with some sprays drooping
to the front and back. Tuck in three or four hosta leaves to the centre,
back and front.
Once you are satisfied with the foliage outline, start adding the
flowers. Shorten the stems of the five freesia and insert these to
follow the top of the curve. Remove some flower heads from the
alstroemeria to use singly and add the rest of the stems following the
outline. Nip off any alstroemeria leaves which are obscuring the flower
petals.
There are always too many buds on spray carnations. Snip off the
tiniest buds and discard them. Insert trails of carnations to the sides
and back.
Shorten the stems of the large carnations and add these towards the
centre. Finally, add trails of fern and ivy.

THE WEEK'S WORK:
* THE main worry now in some areas is lack of rain. The situation is
one where there is a variety of plants, in beds or in a patio, and
struggling to survive. Just because there is no rain.
Obviously, things vary according to the type of soil you have. One
that is well enriched with organic matter will hold moisture better than
a light, free-draining kind.
Anyway, whatever the situation, make sure plants do not go short of
water. Otherwise, your losses could be high.
You might be lucky enough to be picking strawberries in your area. If
so, be careful to avoid damage from rough handling. At the same time,
remove any damaged berries, especially those pecked by the birds.
Suckers of raspberries can be a real nuisance, coming up metres away.
They do this often in the middle of the strawberries, just to be
awkward.
If you are pulling them out, wear a pair of gardening gloves. The
thorns can easily get into your fingers and cause a possible infection.
Annuals of the hardy group sown earlier may by now require thinning
and supporting. There is some virtue in letting them remain fairly
dense. They support themselves better this way.
If you have a rockery, have a good look over the plants. Cut back any
over-vigorous growth. This should induce fresh new growth.
Thinking ahead, it is now time to sow for winter pansies -- Canterbury
bells, wallflower, sweet William, and forget-me-nots.
A point of some importance is not to sow wallflower seed in any areas
that are suspected of being infected by club root. This is particularly
true of the vegetable garden, where brassicas have been grown for years.
Any shrubs which have finished flowering should have the old flowering
growth removed, to induce new shoots for next year's flowering.
This pruning is often made to appear complicated. A little commonsense
goes a long way. On light and fresh looking wood, this means shrubs
flower on new wood.
I suggests you need more of this to get more flowers next year. So cut
out some old wood.
In the greenhouse, tomatoes should be well-formed. For those planted
in late April or early May, fruits could well be about the size of
marbles.
If you are considering growing tomatoes out of doors, do so by all
means. Make sure the ground is well prepared, with a sheltered spot,
south facing. Some kind of polythene cover will give extra protection.
It is not that you won't get tomatoes forming. It is getting them ripe
enough to eat that is the problem.

BEST of luck to former Scots champion racing driver June
Henderson-Laird who set off yesterday to try to break the Royal Scottish
Automobile Club's Scottish coastline record in aid of charity.
The current record of just under seven days was set in 1923 and she
plans to follow the original coastal route used by Scots car
manufacturer Arrol-Johnson of Kircudbright and Renfrew when the record
was set.
She is being sponsored by Maclay Murray &amp; Spens and has just won her
own personal battle against cancer.
The money raised will go to the Cancer Relief MacMillan Fund and
Enable, the Scottish organisation which represents the interests of
people with learning disabilities and their families.
She will be driving a modified Opel Manta 2.0 litre GTE in her
attempt.
Wherever you are when you read this, June, safe driving -- and we all
hope you raise plenty of cash for worthy causes as well as breaking the
record. Watch out for the sheep.

<HEADLINE>A little piece of England is hidden in historic Fife village Having fun off their own bat</HEADLINE>

THE local worthies will not appreciate the suggestion, but it is
difficult to resist the impression that a little piece of England
thrives deep in the heart of the kingdom of Fife, in Falkland. If you
turn left beyond Glenrothes, drive past the historic Falkland Palace and
through the prettiest of villages, with its fountain in the square,
meander through white gates into the Estate, you will emerge from the
trees into a clearing where cricket is the name of the game.
The English connection is undeniable, because it was the immigrant
workers on the Falkland Estate, employed by the wealthy Crichton-Stuart
family, who began knocking a ball about with makeshift bats in the
middle of the nineteenth century, the pastime that led to the foundation
of the Falkland Cricket Club in 1860.
Nobody has been able to teach them the error of their ways since.
Cricket is an obsession with a great number of the village's population,
even if most are passionately Scottish.
There are exceptions, like ground convener Tom Watson, who comes from
Lancashire but has never played any serious cricket in his life. His
intention to convert the local populace en masse to the
leather-and-willow business becomes apparent when you discover that, on
an average weekend, around 20 of the Watsons turn up at Scroggie Park
for the cricket.
The family line, if I have it right, goes something like this: one son
is captain of the First XI, another is vice-captain of the Second XI,
another plays for the First, and a fourth is former Second XI captain;
two grandsons play for the under-15s, and Mrs Watson Sr, along with her
three daughters, help in the clubhouse on match days. Other relatives
turn up for the hell of it.
It is entirely apposite, therefore, that their match today is against
Watsonians. Everybody should feel at home.
Like Watson, many of the other committee men of this remarkable little
club, which has reached the first division of the East of Scotland
League for the first time in its long history, are retired and immensely
dedicated.
No-one is more so than the president, 74-year-old Bob Nellies, who has
been in that role since 1984, and, according to his colleagues --
treasurer Jim Grant, and vice-president Charlie McGarrie -- is likely
still to be the man in charge when he is 90.
Once he gave up the local licensed grocer's which he ran for most of
his adult life, Nellies, who was born in the village, was able to
indulge completely his love of cricket, and the club in particular. His
application and energy leave even his younger and equally enthusiastic
colleagues breathless in admiration.
''Every Saturday and Sunday he is out there scoring, the same with the
under-13s or under-15s, wet or dry, cold or hot,'' says Grant, a retired
bank manager. ''He is incredible,'' says McGarrie, who was a headmaster.
Nellies is also doing his bit to keep the game in the family. His son,
Robert, is vice-captain of the top team, and his two grandsons, Paul and
Graeme, play for the younger teams.
It is all of this family and hereditary tradition that has enabled
Falkland to survive when many of the old Fife clubs have had to abandon
play and it will be the legacy of the current leaders that the younger
generation will have to pick up.
The proudest moment for most of these villagers was promotion to the
first division after having moved from the fourth division to the
second, where they had been stuck since 1982. Life has not been too
comfortable in the higher league, however, as the village lads find
themselves up against more accomplished and experienced top league
players. In fact, they have lost six of their seven games to date. The
one afternoon of satisfaction came when they drew with Freuchie, the
village team which had more than its 15 minutes of fame when it won the
UK Village Team Trophy a few years ago.
Not losing to Freuchie, the rival village three miles up the road,
meant a great deal to the locals. There is a hereditary dislike of each
other which manifests itself when the usual 200 swells to 800 or so when
the teams meet. ''The players don't have any great animosity for each
other, but it is the fans of both villages who get worked up,'' said
Grant.
The intense rivalry is believed to date to the times when the servants
who worked in the Falkland Palace and Estate lived in Freuchie, which
perhaps took on the image of a lesser status than the other place.
At any rate, the competitiveness is real enough and the trip to
Freuchie might be worthwhile to see the two meet again on July 22. Maybe
a hard hat is advisable.
Falkland have managed their finances so well that their income in
1985, which was #2500, had risen to #18,000 last year. It is all down to
the inevitable fund-raising tactics, barbecues, dances etc, but they
have been so successful that they dug into their resources to appoint a
professional in 1988. Indian Manoj Parmar has been a great help in the
development of the club and even managed to return after having spent a
year with Freuchie. The club has a huge list of sponsors, mostly for
small sums, but Glenrothes car firm Forrester's has promised them #1000.
It was in 1948 that Major Michael Crichton-Stuart laid the Scroggie
Park square for the club and the ground is still leased from the
Falkland Estate, for a penny a year.
The current chief patron, Ninian Crichton-Stuart, keeps a low profile
but, although not a huge cricket fan, turns up occasionally to see the
lads in action.
It was his mother who opened the current pavilion, which cost #840 in
1957, built with the help of the Crichton-Stuarts and another admired
patron and former player, the late Alex Bonthrone. Three senior teams
play every weekend at the park, which belies its unflattering name and
where there has been a recent extension to the pavilion, including a new
bar.
Sitting in the sunshine amid the greenery, with the Lomond Hills in
the background, it was easy to imagine a lazy afternoon sipping a gin
and tonic and offering the odd ''well played, sir'' to encourage the
lads. Very English, although it would not be advisable to exaggerate
that aspect of the old ball game within the earshot of some of the
committee. ''You wouldn't think that if you came here when we play
Freuchie,'' said one, with a fair degree of Fife passion.
It may well be so but Scroggie Park and its setting reflect many of
the delightful aspects that are associated with the game as it once was
south of the Border.
In his odd visit to the dear, green place, Ninian Crichton-Stuart can
see for himself what his antecedents started 150 years ago. Like the men
who work tirelessly to keep the game flourishing, he will hope that the
team can do enough to establish itself in the first division. They
deserve that much after all this time.

TIME is running out for Scottish innovators and companies who would
like a share of the #35,000 which is up for grabs in the John Logie
Baird Awards for Innovation.
The awards, organised by Scottish Innovation are in their seventh
year, and the closing date for entries is June 30. For the first time,
entry forms are available on the Internet, opening the competition up to
more than 50 million people around the world.
Brian Wilson of Scottish Innovation has already received 120 ideas --
40 of them from Edinburgh, with Glasgow trailing far behind with just
over 20 entries. A Scottish Innovation spokesman commenting on this
apparent lack of innovation in the West of Scotland said: ''Perhaps
firms are in the huff because the awards ceremony is held in the
Edinburgh International Conference Centre.''
But Russell Griggs, director of business development at Scottish
Enterprise, told Business Diary: ''There have already been many
excellent entries this year, but I would encourage anyone still thinking
of taking part to submit their ideas, no matter how big or small.''
The aim of the awards is to help ensure that ideas generated in
Scotland become commercial reality here, rather than being lost
overseas. Last year's winner was Award Plc which employs 60 people in
Livingston manufacturing disposable contact lenses.
For those without access to the net, entry forms can be obtained from
Scottish Innovation on 0141 554 5995.
Tricky question
of winning
DM Hall failed to make it three in a row when it competed in this
year's Bonnington Bond Quaich quiz competition. Having won for the past
two years the firm of chartered surveyors fielded its strongest team in
Max Mendhelsson, Tessa Leddingham and Bob Mowat in a bid to retain the
trophy.
Grimley, however, collected an impressive 87 points from a possible
100, forcing DM Hall to be content with second place on a total of 80
points.
The event, which was held at Bonnington Bond in Leith, attracted 21
teams, with DTZ Debenham Thorpe taking third place on 79 points. Knight
Frank Rutley will have to send its team to tutorials if it wants to
improve its position in next year's competition -- it came last with
just 46 points.
A quiz in the offing is the Moores Rowland night at the Moat House
Hotel in Glasgow on Tuesday in aid of Erskine Hospital. A table for a
team of four costs #30 and the accountancy firm hopes to raise #2000 for
the hospital.
Managing partner Iain Paterson and his colleague Kirsty Gray will be
chairing the evening, and any firm which would like to go along should
gives Moores Rowland a call on 0141 221 6991.
Paterson is looking forward to an enjoyable evening, although it will
not be quite the same as the one he spent in the company of arch rival
Frank Blin of Coopers &amp; Lybrand and a few others when they were guests
of Lithgows at the Rod Stewart concert in Ibrox Stadium.
Lithgows produced a surprise birthday cake to celebrate his 50th
birthday, but it could not organise the other 49,992 fans in the stadium
to sing Happy Birthday. Paterson enjoyed his impromptu party with
special guest Stewart, but he denied he had tartan scarves attached to
either wrist.
Children called
to account
PROFESSOR Ian Marrian, deputy chief executive of the Institute of
Chartered Accountants of Scotland, attended a small dinner party in
London last week to mark the first birthday of ICAS' joint education and
examination venture with the Association of Corporate Treasurers.
The cosy dinner party would certainly have been a lot bigger if those
sitting round the table had brought their children along. Instead of
counting beans as accountants and treasurers often do, the guests began
counting offspring. It transpired that the outgoing president of ACT,
Gerry Leahy, is father of six; his successor Jeremy Wagener also has six
children, and two other ACT officials round the table matched the six
figure.
Marrian, who can only boast a family of three, could be forgiven if he
had asked to be allowed to get in on the ACT, but instead he refrained
merely saying . . . ''Of course it is quality that counts.''
Standing up
for good design
RICHARD Bissland of 999 Design Group is on a certain loser when the
Clothes Show Scotland opens today at the SECC in Glasgow. Despite having
designed stands all over the world for companies such as Reebok,
Bissland knows the stand his company designed for Scotland's seven art
schools and colleges will not be in the race for the best designed stand
award Clothes Show presenter Jeff Banks will be helping judge.
However, this fall from grace has nothing to do with the quality of
the colleges stand and everything to do with the fact that 999 Design
agreed to be the award's sole sponsor, effectively putting itself out of
the running.
The 999 sponsorship also meant that Brian Godbold, the divisional
director in charge of design for Marks &amp; Spencer, will be able to join
the judging team, as M&amp;S is sponsoring the combined colleges stand.
The seven Scottish colleges on the stand being organised by Scottish
Design are: Glasgow School of Art, Edinburgh College of Art, Grays
School of Art in Aberdeen, Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art in
Dundee, the Scottish College of Textiles in Galashiels, and Glasgow's
Caledonian University and Cardonald College.
To help the students, 999 Design waived all its design and project
management fees so the colleges' total budget could go towards providing
the best possible fashion platform for the designers of the future.
Bissland's fellow director Bill Gaughan will miss the Clothes Show as
he is in California supervising a photo shoot for a Reebok International
sportswear catalogue. Poor fellow, it probably means that he missed our
summer as well.
Two powerful
points of view
FOR a passing second while reading the Irish News I thought Struan
Stevenson had given up his ambition to succeed Sir Hector Munro as
Conservative MP for Dumfries, and instead had decided to stand in the
Down by-election in Northern Ireland which was held earlier this week.
The paper quoted Stevenson as stating: ''This interconnector is a bad
deal for Northern Ireland, a bad deal for jobs in Northern Ireland and a
bad deal for the environment in Northern Ireland.''
Strong stuff, but then I read on and discovered he was speaking in his
capacity as a consultant with PS Public Affairs, the Edinburgh-based
company which acts for the North Island-Magee Action Group, a Northern
Ireland protest group which is against the proposal for ScottishPower to
supply power to Northern Ireland Electricity via an interconnector.
When Campbell Christie, general secretary of the STUC and also a
director of Scottish Coal, heard about Stevenson's apparent concern
about jobs in Northern Ireland he posed the question: ''What about the
Scottish jobs in the Scottish power and coal industry which depend on
ScottishPower being able to export electricity to Ireland and England?''
No doubt Stevenson will address this question nearer the General
Election.

ENGLAND step on to the Newlands stage tomorrow as marginal favourites
to extend their RWC campaign to next week's final and try, just as they
did four years ago, to become the first Northern Hemisphere side to
carry off the William Webb Ellis trophy.
Will Carling's men are better equipped now to win rugby's ultimate
prize than they were in 1991 when, goaded by David Campese and the
domestic Press into playing for the first time in the tournament a game
which involved more than numbers 1 to 10, they fell at the final hurdle.
But before Carling and his men can even think about the final at Ellis
Park next weekend, first they have to dispose of the All Blacks.
The exercise of comparing two sides, man for man, is often a
worthwhile indicator of how the adversaries will fare in a collective
sense.
The heavyweight England pack have the edge in just about every regard.
Leonard, Moore and Ubogu are not so overtly aggressive as Dowd,
Fitzpatrick and Brown (Brian Moore, who may be enjoying his swansong
season, will probably sue for that remark), but they will more than hold
their own in the tight.
New Zealand's problems begin, and may well end, in the second row. The
two Martins, Bayfield and Johnson, are currently the world's top lineout
duo and Ian Jones and Robin Brooke will have their work cut out to
nullify the threat which they represent.
The English back-row unit of Ben Clarke, Tim Rodber and Dean Richards
are an awesome trio. Very few sides, if any, have been able to find the
answer to those powerhouse short-yardage runs which are the mainstay of
England's mauling game.
Michael Brewer, Josh Kronfeld and Zinzan Brooke are powerful players
in their own right -- the shaven-headed and scrum-capped Kronfeld being
one of the new breed of All Blacks and one of the finds of the
tournament.
Dewi Morris is a dog. He will yelp and snap and generally be about the
ankles of the opposition all day long.
New Zealand's Graeme Bachop is a more cultured player, with a whiplash
service, but for the game that England have developed over the years,
Morris is just what the doctor ordered.
The game will be won and lost at fly-half. Rob Andrew will play the
devastating touchline and long-ball game that has tortured England's
opponents for longer than most of them care to remember. He will also
kick his goals and the ability to do so is an invaluable weapon.
His opposite number Andrew Mehrtens could well be the key to New
Zealand success. The young Canterbury student possesses scalding pace
and he will surely seek to test the English defence, and in particular
the rather leaden-footed back-row (so admirable in all other respects)
with some of those lightning breaks which have become his trademark.
In the centre, too, New Zealand have the wherewithal to cause England
concern. Frank Bunce and Walter Little have been a proven unit out here
in South Africa -- and before that -- while, to my mind, Jeremy Guscott
is not the player that he was before injury kept him out for an entire
season last year. Carling is still a damn fine rugby player and what
better way for him to close this particular chapter of his long career
than by leading England to the glorious sunlit uplands of Ellis Park.
The Lomu factor looms large. So large in fact that it is in danger of
blotting out the sun. He is undoubtedly a monster with ball in hand and
there isn't a player in the world who could bring him down in a
one-on-one situation. But he is no rugby player, in the all-round sense,
and Tony Underwood must fancy his chances.
On the other touchline Jeff Wilson, who had such a marvellous tour in
Britain two years ago, has not fulfilled that early promise in this
tournament and the other Underwood, Rory of that ilk, will not be losing
much sleep.
Glen Osborne provides for New Zealand an attacking dimension at the
rear which, perhaps, is not quite of the same calibre in England's Mike
Catt.
Probably, England come out ahead in the game of individual
comparisons. Probably, too, they are the more settled side with a tried
and tested game-plan which they can stick to.
The odds, then, are stacked in favour of the lilywhites but the
collective will of the men in black can never be discounted. They are
always, as they say in the Borders, gey ill tae bate.

* PAUL Ince yesterday insisted it had always been his intention to
return from Italy without signing for Inter Milan in order to mull over
his proposed multi-million pound move.
The England midfield player dismissed as ''nonsense'' suggestions that
the delay in joining the European giants came because his wife, Claire,
could not find anywhere she wanted to live.
In a statement issued through solicitor Henri Brandman, Ince and his
wife spoke of their ''shock'' at United's willingness to sell -- and
said a decision on the move will be conveyed to Inter ''in due course''.
''Until about 10 days ago Paul was happily contracted to Manchester
United. He had four years left on his contract and had no reason to
believe he would be leaving,'' said Brandman. ''It came as a tremendous
shock to him to learn that Manchester United had agreed to sell him to
Inter Milan.
Under-pressure United chairman Martin Edwards said: ''We are not
banking on Paul going. If he stays, it just means we will not be in a
position to spend heavily in the transfer market over the short-term
future.''

* YOUR own bed slave -- that's virtually what you get with one of the
luxury adjustable bed models, writes WENDY JACK.
Take Sleepeezee's range, for example. By remote control, you can raise
the top end of the bed, or the foot of it when you feel so inclined, or
even programme it to give yourself a gentle massage. By setting a timer,
it's possible to gently soothe yourself to sleep, without the fag of
having to break the spell of relaxation to switch off the massage
function.
This particular manufacturer's range has pocketed spring mattresses
which contain wool. They don't come cheap -- at #1739 for the three-foot
wide by six-foot-six long model, and #3349 for the five-foot width, but
from June 20, Frasers in Glasgow is offering substantial discounts in
its sale.
Another (this time highly customised) adjustable bed -- particularly
suited to those suffering from any one of a wide range of ailments -- is
offered by a company called Adjustamatic.
It supplies beds to the professional market such as hospitals, and
will make them to order in width from 3ft-9ft, at prices starting from
#2300.
This highly personalised service sees one of the company's 120
consultants visit your home with a miniaturised demonstration bed of
5[1/2]ft x 2[1/2]ft, fitted with all the features of the real thing,

LUTON Town chairman David Kohler last night won a High Court
injunction banning David Pleat from becoming manager of Sheffield
Wednesday.
Pleat was appointed by the Premiership club this week after having
walked out of Kenilworth Road when the clubs failed to agree
compensation for the final year of his contract.
Kohler had threatened to take legal action -- and now Pleat has been
forced to promise that he will not work for Wednesday until at least
June 28 when Luton will be back in court.
He hopes Wednesday will see sense and increase their ''derisory''
offer for Pleat and the matter can be resolved without further
litigation.
Otherwise he is prepared to fight them all the way ''to set an
example'' after what he calls ''irresponsible and unnecessary
disruption.''
Kohler, confirming Luton's High Court success, said: ''The result is
that for the time being David Pleat cannot work for Sheffield Wednesday,
Wednesday cannot employ David or interfere with his current contract
with us, and David cannot give away our confidential information.''

THE presence of Walker Cup selectors at today's Scottish Stroke-play
Championship at Renfrew and Paisley has produced one of the highest
calibre fields seen in Scotland this season.
British Amateur champion Gordon Sherry attempts to get his feet back
on the ground following his weekend win and the Kilmarnock Barassie
golfer is joined by Tennant Cup winner Stephen Gallacher, Barclay Howard
and Graham Rankin as front runners to make the Great Britain and Ireland
team for the biennial clash with America in September.
From further afield Welshman Bradley Dredge and English Stroke-play
and Match-play champion Mark Foster will also compete with an
international field boosted by entrants from 16 other countries.

MELANIE Neef is ready to break the 15-year-old Scottish record for 400
metres, said her coach, Bob Inglis, yesterday.
Inglis was speaking a day after the City of Glasgow had sprinter
carved .39 from her lifetime best, with 51.70secs in Nuremberg. Next
weekend, for the second successive year, Neef will be Britain's
first-choice 400 metres runner at the European Cup final, in Lille.
There, Neef may have a chance of challenging the Scottish best, of
51.16 -- then a UK record -- set by Linsey Macdonald when she qualified
for the Moscow Olympics.
''I am very confident of Mel getting to that level,'' said Inglis, who
coached Elliott Bunney and Jamie Henderson to European junior 100m
titles.
''Mel trained twice on Saturday, again on Sunday, did a weights
session on Monday, and speed work on Tuesday -- not the way you prepare
for a big race. So I see no reason why she should not give the record a
serious challenge this year.''
Macdonald, 16 years ago, won the Frances Barker Shield, the trophy for
the most meritorious girls' performance at the Scottish Schools
Championships. Neef never had the chance, because her school took no
interest in what is the highlight of today's domestic programme.
A total of 179 schools have entered the TSB girls' event at Meadowbank
(10am to 5pm), where sprinters Gillian Hegney, Natalie Hynd, and Mhairi
McEwen can stake claims to being the Neefs or Macdonalds of the future.
A vintage year in the boys' event at Grangemouth (9am to 5pm) is in
prospect, with 700 athletes from 191 schools in action, and Bunney and
Henderson's records under threat from Scott Fraser, Adam Lowles and Andy
Lees.
* THE Scottish Athletics Federation is holding four seminars to
investigate the decline in the standard of women's 800 and 1500m
running. Athletes and coaches with any interest in these events are
invited to attend.
The plan is to stage a national conference in September.
The seminars are at Chris Anderson Stadium, June 26; Meadowbank, June
28; Kelvin Hall, July 3; and David Keswick Centre, Dumfries, July 5, all
starting at 7.00pm.

A CALL for the winding up of the Scottish Seed Potato Development
Council was made at the annual meeting of the Scottish Early Potato
Growers' Association.
Chairman Douglas McCrone said the SSPDC should be wound up as a potato
development council was phased in to replace the Potato Marketing Board.
''We cannot afford two bodies,'' he said.
Jim Cruickshank, vice-chairman of the marketing board, agreed that
growers could not afford to pay two levies to two different bodies.
The future, he suggested, lay in the creation of a numerically small
organisation as a successor to the board -- underpinned by sector groups
which could represent different interests such as early growers, seed
growers and processors.
The role of the sector groups would be to send very strong messages to
the top on the specific interests of their own part of the industry.
Growers at the meeting expressed concern about the collection of levy
payments under the new arrangements. There were fears that with the
demise of quotas and acreage controls people could drift in and out of
potato growing without ever making a contribution to the industry.
John Duncan asked if the successor body to the board would have access
to Integrated Area Compensation Scheme returns as a means of checking
acreage planted in potatoes.
The Scottish Office had refused to give such access, said Mr
Cruickshank. ''They say it is privileged information and they cannot
disclose it to a third party.''
The National Farmers' Union in Scotland had also expressed concern at
information from the returns -- on which subsidy payments are based --
being passed to other parties.
Mr Cruickshank said that some consideration had been given to asking
farmers to fill in a duplicate form on a voluntary basis. ''Even if we
only got a 75% voluntary return we would then only have a balance of 25%
to check,'' he argued.
Andrew Kay, potato marketing board member, said he sometimes wished
the civil service was more privatised. ''We could then ask them to do
the checking for us and we would pay them for it,'' he said.
Mr Kay promised to take up a complaint from one grower who said that
after being four days' late in making his first levy payment this year
he was told he had forfeited the right to pay in two instalments. The
next approach he had was from sheriff officers, which he described as
''a shabby way to treat someone who had faithfully paid his levy for
years''.
Mr Kay said he had been very unhappy at the way such matters had been
handled this year. It was extremely heavy-handed, although the board had
agreed to take a tough line in the wake of what appeared to be
inefficiency in previous years. ''An instruction was given to tighten up
-- but I think the degree of tightness was extreme,'' he said.

Salt Lake City have won the race to stage the 2002 Winter Olympics --
after three decades of campaigning to be a host city.
Members at the International Olympic Committee meeting in Budapest
voted in a secret ballot for the American city ahead of three other
candidates -- Oestersund (Sweden), Quebec City (Canada) and Sion
(Switzerland).
IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch announced the victory of the
American city amid jubilant scenes of celebration by Utah supporters in
the Hungarian capital.
The Americans, bidding for the fifth time for the right to host the
Olympics, and just edged out by Japan's Nagano for the 1998 Games, began
as overwhelming favourites.
The IOC's own evaluation commission had come out enthusiastically for
Salt Lake, which, unlike its rivals, has already built almost all of the
venues needed for the Games.
It will be the fourth time the United States has staged the Winter
Olympics, and the first time since Lake Placid hosted the Games in 1980.
The Americans took 54 votes followed by Oestersund and Sion, who each
had 14. Quebec City polled seven.

THE British Wool Marketing Board has extended the deadline date of its
offer for Scottish, English and Welsh Wool Growers to June 26 -- two
weeks beyond the original date for acceptance.
A board spokesman said yesterday that it had acceptances for 76% of
the co-operative's share capital, and the figure was growing daily.
The board is aiming for a 90% acceptance which would enable it to
acquire the outstanding 10%.
The board is offering #4.10p for each #1 of capital held by the 1400
members, most of whom are sheep farmers in Scotland and Wales.

SCOTTISH Pride has promised to make a direct response to all
shareholders following the submission of critical resolutions from a
ginger group which has called on directors to sell back to the company
blocks of shares which they acquired earlier this year.
The resolutions, to be considered at the company's annual general
meeting next month, claim that directors, or members of their families,
were succcessful in buying shares at a price of 38p during February and
March. On Monday of this week the shares were quoted at 52p.
The company declined to make any formal statement, saying only that a
response would be made ''at the appropriate time.''
Scottish Pride was formerly the retailing arm of the old Scottish Milk
Marketing Board, before de-regulation. Its chairman is Lord Sanderson of
Bowden, a former Scottish Office Minister and former chairman of the
Scottish Conservatives. Jim Hosea is chief execiutive and is also a
member of the board. The majority of shareholders are dairy farmers who
were allocated shares on a pro-rata basis when the company was
consitutued as a plc.
Shares are traded on a ''matched bargain'' basis through the company's
stockbrokers Allied Provincial.
Michael McCreath of Garlieston Home Farm, Newton Stewart, secretary of
the shareholders association said that he had been told on a number of
occasions that although some people wanted to buy shares no one was
selling and that prices were steady at 38p per 10p share.
''I found it hard to believe that the price could remain steady if
there was competition to buy and very limited selling,'' he said.
One of the resolutions which the shareholders association wants to be
put to the annual meeting seeks a change in procedures so that sales
could be made without going through Allied Provincial.
In addition to their concern about share dealings, the association has
called for assurances on the future running of the company's creamery
business. It will press at the annual meeting for an undertaking that
none of the creameries at Kirkcudbright, Rothesay, Kilmory or
Campbeltown would be closed, disposed of or run down without the prior
approval of a general meeting of the shareholders.
A statement accompanying the resolutions said dairy
farmer-shareholders fear that the knock-on effect of a closure policy --
which might make economic sense for Scottish Pride as a company -- could
be a collapse in the price of raw milk.
Mr McCreath said that the resolutions had been signed by about 200
shareholders who were anxious to ensure that the company did not base
its policy on attempting to undermine the price of raw milk.
''Although we have been advised not to rock the boat, in view of the
fact that the company has only recently been privatised, our opinion is
that the sooner these matters get sorted out the better.
''We need to ensure that all those on board are working together. I
think we should all agree that, rather than rocking the boat we have
gently lowered an anchor.''

TENNIS: STELLA ARTOIS
PETE Sampras moved into frightening pre-Wimbledon tempo in the Stella
Artois Championship at Queen's Club yesterday.
Sampras stepped up a gear to crush Australian Sandon Stolle 6-2, 6-3
in just 53 minutes of a one-sided quarter-final.
The big-serving American bombarded Stolle with 13 aces and looked much
more assured than he had in previous victories over Britain's Jeremy
Bates and Jonathan Stark of America.
Sampras has won only one tournament this year, but was back among the
prizes for the first time since he beat Andre Agassi in the Indian Wells
final more than three months ago.
To mark his 500th professional match, tournament director Ian Wight
made a presentation -- and gave Sampras his most uncomfortable moment of
the afternoon.
He gratefully accepted a bottle of champagne but recoiled in mock
horror when he was handed a special Stella straw boater.
''I don't have to wear that thing, do I?'' he asked anxiously.
Then the twice Wimbledon champion relented and posed briefly for
photographs.
''It just came together,'' said Sampras with masterly understatement.
''I hit some really good shots and won convincingly. It was a pretty
smooth day.''
If Sampras wasn't stretched by Stolle on court, he caused a flutter by
stretching afterwards. He sent a message to the media saying his news
conference had been delayed while he received treatment.
But when he arrived, he explained: ''I was just having a stretch on
the treatment table.''
Sampras will face Germany's unseeded Marc Goellner in today's
semi-finals of a tournament he has yet to win.
Goellner followed up his win over Switzerland's Olympic Champion Marc
Rosset by toppling American Derrick Rostagno 7-5, 6-4.
At one stage Rostagno became so frustrated he was warned by the umpire
for swearing in Spanish.
Boris Becker showed no hint of the calf muscle strain he sustained on
Thursday as he swept through to a semi-final meeting against France's
Guy Forget with a 6-4, 6-1 win over Australian Jason Stoltenberg.
Forget beat Croatian Goran Ivanisovic 6-3, 7-6.

THE agrochemicals industry made some major mistakes 20 years ago in
failing to get its message across to the general public, a senior
industry figure has admitted.
These should provide some clues for the emerging biotechnology
industry in tackling public perceptions, said Don Taylor, managing
director of CIBA Agriculture.
Speaking at an industry forum at Cereals '95 in Bedfordshire, he said
the industry had to take the debate to the people and explain it in
layman's language. ''We made mistakes 20 years ago with pesticides and
we are paying for this now.''
Predicting yield gains of between eight and 12% as a result of
biotechnical manipulation of crop gene structures, he said that hybrid
wheat would almost certainly be on the market by the year 2000. One
company was reportedly looking at 1998 for a modified variety launch.
''We have to start preparing now for biotechnology in a big way to
ensure that the public is ready. We have a lot of work to do
particularly in view of the current reaction to chemicals usage.''
The new technology would enable breeders to use chemicals to build on
the natural defences of new variety. It would also enable them to
manipulate quality traits. This would be tied in to greater precision in
the use of fertilisers and chemicals through, for example, satellite
field mapping.
He was backed up by Professor Ben Miflin of the Institute of Arable
Crops Research, Harpenden Hearts, who said that cereals transformation
was already a reality with transgenic crops having undergone at least
two years of field trials. He believes farmers would be able to adapt
readily to these new technologies. The major difficulty would be in
influencing public perceptions.
Both speakers revealed a strong interest in progress in China which
was setting the pace. Mr Taylor said that more than a dozen major
companies had invested in joint projects in that country which had about
22% of the world's population and which had shown an unprecedented
growth in gross domestic product. Professor Miflin said there were more
transgenic crops being grown in China than in the whole of the rest of
the world.

FOR whatever reason, Heriot's have played only one league game at home
so far this season, and tomorrow they are on the road again defending
their 100% record against Corstorphine.
Notwithstanding a big success at Falkland last week, it would be a
major upset were Corstorphine to repeat that performance against the
leaders, and that must be of concern to the chasing pack, with a
preponderance of fixtures at Goldenacre to be negotiated by the
Herioters after the halfway mark.
Leading the chase are Carlton, who travel to Freuchie for what would
normally be a daunting prospect but which has lost something of its
mystique following Royal High's success there last week.
High are at Edinburgh Academicals who scored plenty of runs last time
out but were unable to contain Watsonians response. Veteran David Fraser
drops out of the visitors' attack to attend a wedding.
Falkland have an opportunity to restore morale after last week's
defeat but Watsonians are unlikely to allow them to exploit home
advantage.
Stenhousemuir and Grange need victory to keep alive their title
challenge after defeat last week, and the outcome at the Tryst is
anybody's guess.

SCOTLAND had a point snatched from their grasp last night in the
European Nations Women's Hockey Cup in Amsterdam when, after matching
Holland for 65 minutes, the hosts won a corner and their captain,
Wietske De Ruiter, made the conversion to register the only goal of the
game.
The Scots excelled themselves throughout the 70 minutes.
They edged the first half when they won the only two penalty corners
of that period, but unfortunately for them the Dutch goalkeeper Stella
De Hey was equal to both their efforts.
Then six minutes after half time Scotland carved out an excellent
scoring opportunity.
Susan McDonald found her captain Pauline Robertson with a pass and the
Bonagrass Grove player set off on a 35-yard solo run which ended with De
Hey making a superb save.
After that the Dutch began to win the duel in midfield and soon the
Scottish defence was put under considerable pressure with De Ruiter
leading the Dutch advances.
Tracey Robb saved her best effort in the 10th minute and then 10
minutes later the goalkeeper did exceptionally well to block an effort
from Ellen Kuipers.
Robb pulled off a string of fine saves as the Dutch fought back,
including foiling four penalty corners.
Then with six minutes remaining Jill Messenger, who had been immense
in the heart of the Scottish defence, was harshly penalised for
allegedly lifting the ball with a clearance out of the circle.
From the award the Dutch forced a second corner and then De Ruiter hit
the target with a brilliant drive when she saw a gap on Robb's left-hand
post.
This was a cruel ending to what had been a magnificent performance by
Scotland.
They will however come out of this contest with their image enhanced,
but now they must beat Spain tomorrow if they are to have any chance of
qualifying for the semi-final. Results:
Group A -- Germany 4, Ireland 0. Group B -- Spain 4, Sweden 0; Czech
Republic 0, Russia 5; Holland 1, Scotland 0.
Today's games: Group A -- France v Italy; Belgium v Ireland; England v
Germany. Tomorrow: Group B -- Scotland v Spain; Holland v Czech
Republic; Russia v Sweden.

ENGLISHMAN Joe Higgins maintained his superb recent form at Nairn to
beat Steve Martin in a play-off to win the #22,500 BBA Northern Open
yesterday.
Both players had ended their four rounds on 12-under-par 276, Higgins
having rolled in a superb 20-foot eagle putt on the 554-yard final hole
for a closing 67 which booked his place in the shoot-out.
He then proceeded to break the Dundee company director's heart at the
first extra hole, punching an approach into the heart of the green
before holing the resultant ten-footer for the title.
Four strokes clear at one point in the final stretch, the crucial
spell for Martin came at the twelfth and thirteenth where he dropped
three strokes, three-putting the twelfth and having to take a penalty
drop from a bush at the next.
Coupled with Higgins' birdie 3 at the fifteenth, it meant his lead had
evaporated and, indeed, he had to get down in two from the back of the
final green for a birdie to make the play-off himself.
276 -- J Higgins (Patshull Park) 73, 68, 68, 67 (#3250); S Martin
(North Engineering) 67, 69, 71, 69 (#2500). Higgins won at first
play-off hole).

Ferry) 70, 69, 70, 71 (#1800 each).

GRAEME Obree will be one of the star attractions in the Isle of Man
international week, which starts tomorrow. The former world champion
continues his build-up to the world championships later in the year with
a series of races in this popular festival of cycling.
Obree, who is training intensively at the Manchester Superdrome track
every week, will make the mountain time trial his main target in the
Manx races. But he expects to complete in other events.
The 28-year-old from Irvine is very much a hero with young Scots
riders, who find his laid-back style refreshing. Seven of them will be
in action over the week, starting with the Onchan Cup, a 32-mile road
race on Monday.
They are James McCallum (Erskine CC), Craig Holmes (Nightingale), Lee
Anderson (Glenmarnock Wheelers), Peter Murdoch (VC Astar), Alan Barr and
Martin Lonie (Glenmarnock), and Craig McQueen (Falkirk Bicycle Club).
The young Scots are being sponsored by the Isle of Man Tourist Board
and the Scottish Cyclists' Union.

There's more to a good night's rest than meets the shut-eye, writes
Sue Hancock
* WE spend around a third of our lives in bed, but have you ever
thought about how well you sleep when you are in bed? Think back to when
you woke up today. Were you raring to go or did you wake up feeling as
if you hadn't had enough sleep, too tired to face the day?
Good-quality sleep is vital to us all. While you are sleeping you are
not only relaxing, but allowing your body to regenerate by producing new
cells and giving your brain time to sift through all the information it
has received during the day.
In an ideal world we would get all the sleep we need, but sometimes
this is easier said than done. Your sleep can be affected by a variety
of factors including worries, stress, your partner snoring, noises
around you or even the quality of your bed.
Now help is at hand from a new organisation called the Sleep Council,
which has been launched to raise awareness of the benefits to health and
well-being of quality sleep, enhanced by the support and comfort of a
good bed, regularly replaced.
Sue Sapsford, a director of Howard Bedding in Dixon Street, Glasgow,
and joint chairman of the Sleep Council, says: ''We spend more in the UK
on sleeping tablets each year than we do on beds, and we are trying to
redress the balance.
''We are trying to reduce the replacement cycle of beds. People are
keeping their beds for far too long. The UK average is 17 years, and by
that time beds no longer give proper support.
''We want people to check whether their beds are sagging or dipping,
and if they are, to think seriously about replacing them.''
The Sleep Council has produced the Sleep Good Feel Good Guide, a handy
leaflet filled with tips to help you get a good night's sleep. The
leaflet also features a simple MOT (Mattress Obsolescence Test) that you
can carry out to see if your bed could be affecting your quality of
sleep. For anyone looking for a new bed, the leaflet offers advice on
how to choose one which will provide correct support.
Jessica Alexander, also of the Sleep Council, says: ''We all sleep,
but the chances are that we don't get the quantity and quality of sleep
we need. In many cases we are so busy with our lives that we forget just
how important sleep is to our waking hours. The Sleep Council has been
set up to help us look at the way we sleep and to find ways of improving
the quality of sleep we get.
''All too often when we are having trouble sleeping we fail to notice
that the bed we sleep on might actually be causing some of the
problem.''
The Sleep Council is being supported by a the majority of bed and
furniture retailers, which can be identified by looking for the blue
Sleep Good Feel Good sign displayed on shop windows and doors.
A national newspaper advertising campaign is planned for next month to
raise awareness of the issue.
* The free Sleep Good Feel Good Guide can be obtained from your local
Sleep Council stockist, or by sending an sae to Sleep Council, High Corn
Mill, Chapel Hill, Skipton, North Yorkshire, BD23 1NL.
HAVE A NICE NIGHT
* We spend around a third of our lives in bed. That's eight hours a
night, almost 300 hours or four months a year.
* You may think you sleep like a log, but in reality the average
person moves maybe 60-70 times a night -- with up to a dozen full body
turns.
* Most GPs surveyed agree that a good, comfortable and supportive bed
will improve the quality of sleep.
* A new #500 bed, over 10 years, will cost just 14p a night -- 7p per
person for a double.
* 15% of people who visit their GP do so because of sleep problems.
* In a survey the most popular ways of relaxing and getting to sleep
were reading (51%), a hot bath (38%), sex (34%), a warm drink (33%),
watching television (30%) and alchohol (25%).
* A second-hand bed will have absorbed other people's skin scales and
sweat at a rate of up to one pint a night.
* Nearly 40% of new beds bought (well over one million) are replacing
beds which are more than 10 years old.
CHOOSE A GOOD BED
* JUST what should you look for to ensure you have a bed which
provides you with support and comfort? Here are a few points to bear in
mind when choosing a new bed . . .
* Choose a reputable retailer with a wide selection of beds and staff
who really know about beds.
* Always try before you buy. In a showroom try to spend at least 10
minutes trying the bed. If the bed is for two, try it with your partner.
* Choose a mattress which is neither too hard nor too soft. Lie on the
mattress on your back and slide your hand under the small of your back:
if the hollow is empty of mattress, it's too hard; if it's full, it's
too soft. Lie on your side too -- you should be able to turn easily and
comfortably.
* Make sure the bed fits not only the bedroom but also you and your
partner. The bed should be at least 15cm (6in) longer than the sleeper.
Also try to allow at least 90cm (3ft) per person.
* Have you enough room to move without disturbing your partner?
TAKE MORE EXERCISE
* THE Sleep Council has the following advice to make it easier for you
to get a restful night's sleep.
* Take more exercise during the day -- and don't be tempted to take a
nap. If you feel sleepy go for a walk.
* Have a hot bath just before you go to bed. The heat will make you
sleep.
* Eat enough -- but not too much. Try to leave at least three hours
between a meal and going to bed.
* Avoid stimulants -- coffee, tea, cigarettes -- just before bedtime.
A hot milky drink or herbal tea will relax you.
* Make sure you sleep in the dark. If light mornings wake you, hang
heavier curtains.
* Stick to a routine at bedtime -- go to bed and get up at the same
time and you'll programme your body and sleep better.
* Make sure your bedroom is cool and well-ventilated. A hot stuffy
room will give you a headache.
* Make sure your bed and bedding provide the right support and
comfort.

JANICE Moodie, of Windyhill, now has sole responsibility for
Scotland's hopes at the British Women's Amateur Championship after her
Curtis Cup team-mate Mhairi McKay and Haddington's Lesley Nicholson
failed to negotiate the fourth round at Royal Portrush yesterday.
The 22-year-old defeated Cathy Schmitt, of France, 3 and 2, finding
her form at the twelfth where she holed an 18-foot putt from off the
green for a birdie to go ahead for the first time.
Moodie, who has finished in the top five at 10 tournaments in America
this year, made the most of Schmitt's mistake at the fourteenth, aptly
named Calamity Corner, when the French girl drove short of the green and
plummeted down the embankment which edges it.
She then won the fifteenth with a par and halved the next to book her
place opposite English champion and former winner Julie Hall, who
defeated Lesley Nicholson 7 and 6 in five under par figures.
Dubliner Hazel Kavanagh defeated Turnberry's Mhairi McKay, the runner
up in the qualifying section of the tournament. McKay, 20, pulled back
from three down with four to play but lost out to a birdie at the first
extra hole. Results:
Third round: J Hall (Felixstowe Ferry) bt M Alsuguren (France) at
20th; L Nicholson (Haddington) bt H Jones (Strabane) 1 hole; J Moodie
(Windyhill) bt A Berg (Sweden) 3 and 2; C Schmitt (France) bt S Beautell
(Spain) 3 and 2; K Mourgue D'Algue (France) bt J Busuttil (France) at
the 19th; M McKay (Turnberry) bt A Armas (Spain) 1 hole.
Fourth round: Hall bt Nicholson 7 and 6; Moodie bt Schmitt 3 and 2;
Kavanagh bt McKay at the 19th.

DOESN'T it make you groan when you see someone described in the
newspapers as a ''millionaire businessman''. No matter whether the
victim actually owns that amount of dosh, the consequences of being so
labelled are too awful to contemplate.
First, the price of anything will immediately rise. People will become
blind to the fact that no-one acquires seven figures without being
extremely cost conscious, if not positively mean.
Then all manner of individuals and organisations will thoughtfully
file away this information for their future benefit. One of those is
likely to be the Inland Revenue -- it is known to scour the media for
clues to undisclosed wealth among its ''clients''. Ex-wives also tend to
take a deep interest in the financial affairs of their former partners.
I well remember an anguished phone call several years ago from the
chairman of a North-east company which had achieved such rapid growth as
to place this gentleman within the orbit of our annual survey of
Scotland's corporate elite. While appreciating his elevation he was
desperate to stay out of the limelight. It emerged that he was going
through a messy divorce and the last thing he wanted was to see his
earnings and equity stake published for the benefit of the world and its
lawyers.
Occasionally we contemplate a research study to identify Scotland's
true millionaires. But each time the idea resurfaces we shudder and
force it back into the bottom drawer. How do you assemble a viable set
of criteria against which to assess the wealth of individuals? How do
you value property assets, for example? What about partners in
professional firms and the value of their equity stakes? And what
valuation can you place on equity holdings in private companies bearing
in mind the lack of a market to set a price?
Yet if you adopt the simple measure of calculating realisable assets
worth a million pounds or more at current market value, there must be a
few thousand genuine millionaires in Scotland today. Finding out how
many would indeed be one useful measure of the growth and dynamism of
our business economy.
Another measure of economic performance is the number of growth
companies that we have as measured by their ability to reach specific
turnover and profit targets within a certain period. Scottish Enterprise
has researched a list of more than 200 companies started within the past
10 years that have broken the #1m turnover barrier. Collectively they
now generate annual sales worth close on #500m and have created more
than 5000 jobs.
More facts will be revealed about this useful piece of research by SE
business development director Russel Griggs at the Year of the
Entrepreneur conference at Glasgow's Royal Concert Hall on Monday.
Another interesting straw in the wind about the process of continual
culture change surrounding us in Scotland today is the attitude of young
entrepreneurs. SE recently held an equiry among 50 of our under-30
owner-managers to find out how best to encourage more young people to
start their own business, and it came across strongly that young
entrepreneurs positively hate the term ''small business''. As one said
firmly: ''I run a growing business and I'll decide how big it gets.''
That ties in with my own view that ''small business'' accurately
describes many thousands of sole traders and #100 companies, which after
surviving the tough early stages settle down at a level with which their
owners are comfortable. They may only offer a living for the owner, and
have no jobs to create, but there's nothing wrong with that.
But at any one time there are literally thousands of other businesses
that are ambitious and growth orientated. Some will make mistakes and
fall by the wayside, while others will reach a higher level of
competence or ambition. But that still leaves lots of others to push
forward.
The difficulty is that although these growth businesses are
substantially large contributors to economic growth and the creation of
new jobs, they receive little special attention from national Government
or business lobby groups. And if those driven souls who own and manage
such businesses do appear in the public limelight they run the severe
risk of being labelled with the politically incorrect title of
millionaire and suffering the consequences.
For myself, that's probably a risk I could take. There are just a few
details to sort out first.

RONAN Rafferty is hoping to beef up his earnings on the Volvo European
Tour -- after having timmed down.
The Irishman has picked up more than #2m in prize money since turning
professional, but he has had a lean spell this season, slumping to
ninty-eighth in the order of merit.
Rafferty, however, showed glimpses of his best form yesterday to move
into the lead after the second round of the DHL Jersey Open at La Moye.
He chalked up five birdies to shoot a 69 and move to nine under, one
stroke ahead of overnight leader Malcolm Mackenzie and Scotland's Dean
Robertson.
Rafferty, who uses Ian Woosnam's physio, Paul Darby, revealed: ''I
have lost one-and-a-half stone in the past nine months and taken two
inches off my waist.
He added: ''When it gets windy like that, all you want to do is keep
the ball in play. It is always nice to play as well as this.''
Mackenzie's form has picked up in recent weeks. He came twentieth in
the German Open last week after having finished thirteenth in the
Murphy's English Open at Forest of Arden.
But he was disappointed to follow his opening 64 with a level-par 72.
He said: ''It is a bit sad. I think I have wasted three or four shots.''
Robertson, who started the day at six under, moved into contention
with another mature performance.
He almost grabbed a sensational hole-in-one at the 363-yard eighteenth
when his drive landed six feet behind the hole. Unfortunately he missed
for an eagle.
Robertson said: ''I've had four top-10 finishes but I have not been in
contention before. It is a great feeling.'' Leading aggregates (British
and Irish unless stated):
135 -- R Rafferty 66, 69.

WE spend #400m each year on holiday insurance, but are we getting
value for money? The Office of Fair Trading doesn't think so and, just
as an estimated 14 million of us get set to head for the sun, it is
launching an investigation into the way holiday insurance is sold.
What is worrying the OFT -- and bugging many holidaymakers -- is the
lack of choice we're given when it comes to buying this type of
insurance.
It is, of course, very tempting to accept whatever cover your travel
agent suggests, especially when you've spent ages wading through
different brochures before finding the holiday you want. But if you are
concerned about getting value for money you need time to look around at
the various options available, especially when surveys suggest it is big
travel agents such as Thomas Cook and Lunn Poly which sell the most
expensive policies.
''Our initial work has revealed several potential consumer problems,''
says the OFT. ''Many travel policies are sold only on a 'tied-in' basis,
where the consumer must buy a specified insurance policy to get a
particular holiday package or discount. Even when there is no formal
tying-in of insurance, relatively few travel agents offer a choice of
insurer.''
That is unfortunate because a family of four could typically save #100
or so by passing up the travel agent's offer in favour of organising a
policy independently.
Another problem is that it is not always clear from the glossy
brochures exactly what is -- and perhaps more important, what isn't --
covered. Often you only realise exactly what you've bought when the
detailed documentation arrives.
Some insurers now give you the chance to change your mind and get a
full refund of your premiums within, say, 10 to 14 days if you find the
policy does not suit your needs. But this is not a legal requirement. So
make sure there is a cooling-off period available before signing on the
dotted line.
Cutting the cost of holiday insurance need not mean compromising on
the protection you have. Policies that include cover for the US at #40
to #50 per adult can be twice as expensive as those which cover trips to
Europe. So don't sign up for a worldwide policy if you don't need one.
Look too for a relatively new idea in the holiday insurance market --
the annual policy. These can produce big cost savings if you take more
than one foreign holiday during the year and can even work out cheaper
than single trip cover from the most expensive companies. Perth-based
General Accident Direct, which sells insurance by phone (0800 121007),
has a yearly policy to cover a family of four at just over #128 to
include the US, dropping to #87 if you only need cover for Europe.
Ask your own insurance company if a travel policy is available. Some
offer holiday cover at very competitive rates, but only to their
existing policyholders. Banks and building societies have some good
value policies too. Lloyds Bank Insurance Direct (0800 750750) and
National &amp; Provincial's yearly family travel policies give you the
chance to opt out of baggage cover which brings the cost down to around
#108.
But why on earth would you want to do without baggage cover? Surely,
apart from medical expenses, that is about the most important part of
your holiday insurance? The answer is that you may already have paid for
it through your household insurance and don't need to pay again when you
go away.
Some holidaymakers have been forced to pay higher premiums on their
home contents policies as a result of claiming on their travel policies
-- and many more could lose newly introduced no claims discounts on home
policies because of travel claims.
That is because the ''all risks'' cover included in many contents
policies also covers possessions when they are out of the home,
including trips abroad. If you claim on your holiday policy the travel
insurer will share the burden with your household insurer -- and your
premiums could go up as a result.
The right of the travel insurer to obtain information and share claims
with your household insurer is now often enshrined in the conditions of
your holiday policy. ''In most cases people are completely unaware of
having claimed against their home and contents policy, which is even
more annoying,'' says Mike Escott of Club Direct, a telephone-based
travel insurance specialist.
Club Direct believes it is unique in deciding not to share claims with
customers' home contents insurers. ''It's much fairer,'' he says.
''Policyholders can be sure there'll be no unexpected financial
penalties in the future.''
Club Direct (01730 817533) has also introduced just one excess for its
travel policies -- that is the amount of any claim you have to pay
yourself. Travel policies usually specify an excess for each section of
cover, typically #25 to #35. So, if you are robbed and injured in the
process you could pay three lots of excess -- one on your stolen
possessions, one on stolen cash and one on medical treatment -- and that
could amount to #105.
''We take the view that this sort of incident should represent a
single claim and only one excess should apply,'' Mr Escott says.

By sailing from Greenock and Belfast once a week to US eastern
seaboard ports such as New York and Baltimore Scotch Line could offer
delivery times comparable to the big boys, but at a significantly lower
cost.
SCOTLAND, ministers are fond of reminding us, is a nation of
exporters. We export more per head than the Japanese. In selling
overseas, we leave our English cousins standing. Of course, a lot of
that export trade is focussed on a few dominant sectors -- computers,
whisky, chemicals. But a Government-backed drive is on, through Scottish
Trade International, to broaden that base and attack more foreign
markets with more products and services from a wider range of Scottish
companies.
These exports, whatever they may be, all have to get to their
destination markets in the quickest, most cost-effective ways possible.
But, given Scotland's geographical peripherality and the smallness of
our population, our direct transport links to some of our biggest target
markets are sadly lacking. As with personal air travel, in too many
instances we have to piggy-back onto hub services in the South, at
considerable extra cost of cash and time.
Calls for better direct transport and communication links from
Scotland are now firmly on the Scottish business agenda. They were a
main focus of the major transport conference convened by Glasgow Chamber
of Commerce in March. They are a central plank of CBI Scotland's current
business agenda exercise. One of the CBI agenda documents says: ''For
Scotland to remain a competitive location for exporters it must offer
transport and communications links which provide first-class access to
markets.''
A second major theme of the moment is encouraging more Scots to take a
risk and start their own businesses. The promotion of personal
enterprise is Scottish Enterprise's current big idea. The drive to
improve Scotland's business birth rate has set the highly ambitious
target of creating an additional 25,000 new starts by the end of the
century.
That strategy is spawning a host of downstream initiatives. Yesterday
industry minister George Kynoch launched the SE-funded University
Entrepreneurship Programme, which will see four Scottish campuses start
to offer course electives to students designed to help them start
businesses when they graduate. On Monday, Glasgow's Royal Concert Hall
will be taken over for the day by Scottish Enterprise for a major
conference for entrepreneurs and would-be entrepreneurs. The talk is of
awakening Scotland's business superstars.
I know that individual cases can make bad case law. But let's test
both these big issues against the experience of one man's business idea.
Exactly one year ago this week, The Herald's Thursday business section
carried news of a new containerised shipping service, linking Scotland
and Ireland directly with North America. Scotch Line is the brainchild
of Andrew McLean, a man with more than a quarter of a century's
experience as a shipping agent and broker, including a business he ran
on his own account for 10 years.
McLean's past experience includes the start-up of an earlier Atlantic
service, liner services linking Europe with the Arabian Gulf and West
Africa, and the first ro-ro service to Shetland.
The core logic behind Scotch Line is hard to fault. Current container
services between Europe (including the UK) and North America are
dominated by a cartel of major shipowners, persistently under
investigation in both Brussels and Washington for alleged
anti-competitive practices. As the ships used by the cartel members have
grown in size, the ports they serve have shrunk in number.
For a time, as they concentrated on fewer and fewer ports, these
shippers offered subsidised inland transport to customers, such as those
in Scotland, who found themselves more and more remote from the
remaining trans-shipment ports, like Felixstowe, Thamesport and
Liverpool.
But, in recent years, these subsidies have evaporated while freight
rates have risen. Over the past three years, McLean argues, the costs of
shipping containers from Scotland to North America via a southern port
have gone up by between 50% and 100%. The impact on United Distillers,
our leading whisky producer, has been put at an extra #1.4m a year.
With Scotch Line, McLean wants to offer Scottish exporters a cheaper
and equally efficient alternative. He wants to charter modern
fuel-efficient vessels of up to 6000 tonnes deadweight, capable of
carrying up to 200 40-foot containers across the Atlantic at speeds of
around 14 knots. By sailing from Greenock and Belfast once a week to US
eastern seaboard ports such as New York and Baltimore, the shortest
crossing, Scotch Line could offer delivery times comparable to the big
boys, but at a significantly lower cost. The savings could run to nearly
#500 a container on current rates.
Although precise statistics are hard to come by, McLean believes that
Scottish exporters send at least 30,000 containers a year to North
America. The UK as a whole sends some 200,000. According to Scotch
Line's financial projections, the business could cut prices to exporters
but become soundly profitable in year two of its operations if it
captured just a third of the Scottish market or 5% of the UK market.
Last year's press reports about Scotch Line produced a flurry of
interest from potential customers, the whisky companies, papermakers and
others who are chaffing against the premiums they are having to pay to
get their American-bound goods away through southern ports. McLean has a
thick sheaf of letters to prove that interest is real. But, a year on,
Scotch Line is still a paper idea seeking the financial support needed
to get it into the water.
THE money McLean is seeking is not huge by the standards of todays'
Lottery jackpots and High Court libel settlements. Scotch Line is
looking for #200,000 in equity, a further #200,000 in working capital,
and #120,000 to finance capital costs including office equipment,
computer systems and cars. So far he has promises of #60,000 in equity
backing from private investors, significantly investors with inside
knowledge of the shipping business.
But, although the public structures which are ostensibly there to
promote enterprise and a more wealth-creating Scottish economy have
helped him put his business ideas together and research his targeted
niche market, they are proving reluctant investors in an idea which, if
it delivers what it promises, would contribute significantly to the
economic goals they claim to have set on our behalf.
When I wrote a column recently about the attitude to risk taking in
this country, prompted by the Government's latest blockbuster
competitiveness white paper, Andrew McLean wrote to me to say: ''Your
article . . . only too well sums up British attitudes to anything
riskier than a post office savings account.''
His own business plan clearly acknowledges the risks involved in what
he proposes with Scotch Line. ''The major risk is securing enough cargo
to keep initial losses within resources. Start up volumes will be low
whilst the operation is proven and customer confidence increases.
However, with the risks well understood and managed, the rewards are
high.''
McLean knows at first hand about risks and rewards. ''I've made a lot
of money out of shipping for others, and for myself at times,'' he says.
He burnt his fingers on one earlier shipping venture. And, more
recently, he lost money on an ill-timed property venture. In more
entrepreneurial cultures that would be seen as good lessons learned, a
route map to how not to make the same mistakes again. I ask him if these
experiences are being held against him as he seeks backing for Scotch
Line. ''No-one's said it to my face,'' he replies.
One of the first reasons given to him by Government officials for not
supporting Scotch Line was that EU directives prohibit support for
shipping businesses. That line has now been rescinded. But he has since
been told that regional assistance would be inappropriate because it
might put Liverpool dockers out of a job. He has also been told there is
insufficient demand for what he's offering, and there has been official
nervousness about the ''significant degree of risk'' in the Scotch Line
concept.
McLean does not dissent from the view that shipping ventures can be
high risk. He points out that two of the most recent attempts to put
independent container services on the North Atlantic failed, in one case
because of those running it, in the other because its vessels were
barely sea-worthy.
''Scotch Line will not start trading until it is properly financed,''
he says emphatically. He has now assembled around him a tight team of
advisers and a small but growing group of private backers. ''I'm a
shipping man. I'm no expert at raising money,'' he adds. But he is
learning fast. He's having to.
If he finally gets all the money in place to launch Scotch Line -- and
I sincerely hope he does -- and it delivers what he says it can,
Scotland's exporters will be that bit better placed to compete
effectively in North America.
Scotch Line's success will also pose some serious questions for the
public authorities promoting entrepreneurship and for those who purport
to back risk. ''There must be dozens of people out there with good ideas
who don't know how to raise money to turn them into reality,'' he muses.
Indeed there must. And when they look for backing, particularly at the
start-up phase, too many of the promoters turn out to be oddly risk
averse.

BILLY Kirkwood, the Dundee United manager, made his first signing for
the Tannadice club when he bought out-of-favour Rangers keeper Ally
Maxwell in a #250,000 deal.
Now, Kirkwood will try to follow up by taking another former Ibrox
player, Scotland Under-21 defender Steven Pressley, to Tayside. I
understand that the one-time Rangers' coach, who worked closely with
Pressley, is pursuing his earlier interest in the player.
He remains hopeful that he can persuade Coventry manager Ron Atkinson
to allow the youngster, who captained his country in the recent Toulon
Tournament, to return north.
And after having sorted out the Pressley situation, Kirkwood could
then divert his attention to yet another ex-Ibrox favourite, Derek
Ferguson, the Sunderland midfield player.
Yesterday, though, the Maxwell deal reached completion and gives the
30-year-old keeper the opportunity to make a new beginning after having
apparently dropped to the third keeping slot with the champions.
When the season ended, Maxwell looked to have lost his place to Billy
Thomson, while international keeper Andy Goram will begin the new season
free of the injury problems which plagued him throughout the last
campaign.
After having joined up on Tayside, Maxwell said: ''I want regular
first-team football and I will get it with Dundee United. Billy Kirkwood
knows me from his time at Ibrox and I know him.
''He is a demanding taskmaster but that suits me. What I want to do
here is help the club back into the premier division where they belong
and resurrect my career. I have been in Scotland international squads
and also have played for the country's B team against Wales. I want to
get back up there.''
Added Kirkwood: ''We are delighted with this signing. I know what he
can do because I worked closely with him at Ibrox. He has the right
attitude and I know this move will work for him and for this club.''
Kirkwood now will aim to bring Pressley to Tannadice in a deal which
could cost him around #500,000.
Again he will be getting a player he knows well after having worked
with the defender at Ibrox.
Meanwhile, Rangers remain certain that they will complete the signing
of Romanian internationalist Florin Raduciou next week. The #2.7m deal
has been agreed with his Spanish club, Espanol, and while the player has
suggested that he may be happy to remain in Spain, the Glasgow side are
ready to welcome him to Ibrox. They reckon the deal will be concluded by
midweek.
* ST Mirren will travel to Northern Ireland next month for a
four-match tour. The Paisley side will play Glenavon, on July 25,
Ballinamellard (26), Derry City (27), and Ards two days later.
General manager Jackie Copland also is hopeful of attracting an
English side to Love Street before the start of the new season.

UNEXPECTED letters from lawyers announcing that you are the sole heir
of a wealthy long lost relative, recently deceased, tend to exist only
in the imagination of novelists, but the fact remains that many people
do inherit substantial wealth when a relative dies. Some well-off
relatives may even gift assets before they die. If you are the recipient
of such a gift or legacy, the tax implications can be daunting.
With gifts made during lifetime, there is usually no capital gains tax
problem if the gift is cash. If an asset is given instead, the donor may
face a capital gains tax bill on the difference between what he paid for
it and its current value.
To avoid this he may ask you to sign a holdover election. This is a
claim for relief from capital gains tax and only applies to gifts of
business assets or assets which are subject to inheritance tax. To be
valid the claim must be signed by both donor and donee.
While the election will save the donor tax, you should remember that,
as donee, you will acquire any tax liability attaching to the asset as
well as the asset itself. This is because you are deemed to acquire it
at a cost equivalent to the donor's base cost, adjusted for inflation.
So if you subsequently sell it, you will have to pay capital gains tax
on the gain between the notional cost at which you are deemed to have
acquired it and the proceeds you receive.
A gift from one individual to another usually attracts no inheritance
tax at the time it is made. But it can do if the donor dies within seven
years. What happens if that befalls your benefactor? First, the
responsibility to tell the Inland Revenue about the gift and to pay any
tax due falls on you as donee. You can't recover the tax payable from
the deceased's estate and you must pay it within six months of death.
In working out the tax due you will have to liaise closely with the
executors. This is because the tax rate applicable is determined by
adding together the value of all gifts made within seven years of death
together with the value of assets retained at death to establish the
total estate taxable. The first #154,000 of the combined estate is taxed
at a nil rate.
Thus if your gift is worth less than this and there were no other
lifetime gifts within the seven-year period, you will get the benefit of
that nil rate band at the expense of the rest of the estate and will not
have any tax to pay. But if earlier gifts were made they will rank in
priority to you in taking up the nil rate band and to the extent it is
not available, or to the extent your gift exceeds #154,000, tax will be
due at 40%.
If more than three years have elapsed since the gift was made, any tax
payable is abated by 20% a year. So after three years 80% of the tax
otherwise payable is due, after four years 60% and so on until after
seven years it is free of inheritance tax.
It's obviously not possible to judge how long someone will survive, so
if you are offered a large gift but are concerned over how you will fund
any tax liability, one option to consider is insuring the life of the
donor. You can obtain insurance for a sum that decreases over the
seven-year term in line with the tax liability, known in the trade as
decreasing term insurance. While the premiums payable will vary with the
age and health of the donor, this can often be worth considering.
If you inherit a legacy from someone who has died, the executors will
have paid all inheritance tax due before you receive it and you will
acquire the asset at its market value at date of death, eliminating any
capital gains tax problems. You should, however, still think about the
inheritance tax consequences on your estate of accepting the bequest.
If you don't need the money, you might want to pass it on to your
children or grandchildren. You can, of course, do this by a direct gift
which has the advantage of simplicity. But if you, in turn, were to die
within seven years the funds would suffer a further inheritance tax
charge.
You can avoid this risk by drawing up a deed of variation. Effectively
this can overrule any will or intestacy provision that passes the
inheritance to you and redirects the legacy to the beneficiary you
specify. Provided the appropriate formalities are observed, the result
is that the gift by you is ignored and is treated for inheritance tax
purposes as though the deceased made it. In addition, the same rule can
be applied for capital gains tax purposes if necessary.
To be effective for tax purposes, you have only two years from the
date of death to sign a written deed of variation. In addition, you must
lodge an election for the tax consequences described above to apply
within six months of signing the deed, so you must put arrangements in
motion fairly quickly.
As well as possible tax due on capital you receive, you must remember
that there may be income tax consequences of receiving a large gift. If
it produces income it will increase your tax liability, and if the extra
income pushes you over the limit into higher rates of tax, you will need
to save this to meet your tax bill. Even if the Inland Revenue does not
send you a return, if you owe tax it is your responsibility to tell it
within 12 months of the end of the tax year, otherwise you could face
penalties and interest charges.
If you inherit an asset that produces income there may be a time gap
between date of death and the date when the executors pay the
inheritance to you. During that period the executors will receive
income, which they will eventually account for to you, having paid tax
on it at the basic or lower rate. If any higher rate tax is due you have
to pay this yourself, or you may be due a repayment of tax, and you
must, therefore, include this income on your tax return.
If any payments you receive on account of your inheritance are less
than the income arising you will not be taxed until payment is made, but
any payment you receive is taxed as income first regardless of whether
it is paid on account of income or capital. The executors will normally
tell you what figures to include on your tax return.

EUROPE, parts of it anyway, looks like coming back into favour with
fund managers. The latest survey of opinion for broker Smith New Court
shows a significant swing in popularity, with 22% now in a mood to
increase their holdings of European shares compared with only 4% in May.
This change is accompanied by a less optimistic view of the UK
economy, where forecasts of gross domestic product growth for the
current year have been trimmed to 3%, down from 3.2% a month earlier. So
those of us who do not relish the thought of higher interest rates can
heave a sigh of relief -- the fund managers are forecasting that
interest rates will be 7% in 12 months time against an expectation of
7.5% last month.
A favourable view of continental Europe had already been taken by
broker Credit Lyonnais Laing in April in its 1995 Investment Trust
Yearbook. After a year in which most European markets struggled, it felt
the economic recovery in Europe, particularly northern Europe, had been
firmly established and that, after a year in which actual growth had
already been better than forecasts at 2.5%, the prospects were good for
growth of 3%-plus this year.
In a separate note issued around the same time, it spotlighted France
and Holland as the two European stock markets it believed offered
prospects for ''significant appreciation'' over the following six to 12
months. For France, once the uncertainty over the presidential election
was out of the way, which it now is, it considered there could be a rise
in the index of the top 40 companies of 20% to 25% over the following 12
months. Some of this has already happened.
The case for Holland was that companies there had a low dependence on
their domestic economy and were set to continue to benefit from the
international recovery still hopefully going on.
The broker highlighted three investment trusts with relatively high
exposure to these markets -- Abtrust European Index, European Assets and
Fleming Continental Europe. All three have increased in price since
then, but still trade at a discount to assets. This is around 11% for
Abtrust Index, little changed from April, 14% for European Assets
against 16%, and just over 6% for Fleming Continental against 8% back in
April. It also retains Mercury European Privatisation (discount 15% or
so) on its buy list.
In addition, it rather fancies Germany, not everyone's top choice,
where its favourite specialist trust would be F&amp;C German.
In the June issue of its Trustwatch, Credit Lyonnais Laing turns its
attention to values it sees in the Far East. It notes: ''Encouraged by
the growing belief that US interest rates have reached a peak, optimism
regarding Far Eastern markets is building rapidly.''
Looking at Hong Kong, where the market fell almost 35% in sterling
terms last year, it says it has recovered 14.7% this year, and ''pundits
expect the market to move yet higher on the back of the prospect of a
return to negative real interest rates and a wave of funds flowing from
the US market which many deem as being fully valued''.
The optimism is also based on the fact that the prospective
price-earnings ratio of companies in the Hang Seng index is around 11.2
times, which puts it ''still at the lower end of its comfortable range
of 11 to 13'', and earnings forecasts are being revised upwards.
In this area it likes the look of Drayton Far Eastern Investment Trust
which is being split into two trusts, one specialising in Japan and the
other in the rest of the Far East. The price of this trust's shares has
already risen by around 11% since the broker drew attention to the
situation some two months ago, while the average Japan trust dropped by
3%.
Now the manager has stated that the two new trusts, Invesco Tokyo and
Invesco Asia, will both be issuing warrants, it sees ''a further buying
opportunity''. This is because it believes the value of the warrants has
not been fully reflected in the Drayton Far Eastern share price.
It says that pricing of shares in a trust which is about to make a
free issue of warrants ''more often than not seems to compound the
market''. It backs up this comment by pointing out that since Investors
Capital units traded cum warrants in February, there has been a rise of
13.7% taking the value of the units together with the now separately
priced warrants, against a gain of 8.8% in the All-Share index.
For Drayton Far Eastern it calculates that the shares have been
trading at an effective discount of 11.5%, which is very high for the
sector. It recommends ''continue to buy Drayton Far Eastern''. Smith New
Court in its latest look at warrants also notes this situation and says
they should make the trust's paper ''more valuable in split form''. The
split comes on July 11.
The ink was hardly dry on the two circulars before the Japanese stock
market was again doing its best to wipe out any feeling of optimism.
Mark Jeffries of Credit Lyonnais Laing is bearish about Japan but
justifies the Drayton Far Eastern recommendation by drawing attention to
the technical situation with the warrants and the fact that some 60% of
its assets are in the Far Eastern sector outside Japan, which he likes.
Among the trusts Laing analysts believe currently offer best
fundamental value in their categories are Hambros Asian Small Companies,
a Far East excluding Japan trust, where the discount was 12% and the
relatively new issue appears to have been overlooked. In international
capital growth they like Greenfriar, discount 14%, seeing the trust as
technically depressed following the expiry of its warrants in April. In
the venture capital sector they pick Electra, discount 13%, and as a UK
trust Legal &amp; General Recovery, discount 8%.

SCOTTISH COUNTIES
NEW Zealander Kyle Wealleans plays and talks about cricket in the way
in which his countrymen play rugby -- straight, and very much to the
point.
So when a 26-year-old who has three years' experience playing in the
heartland of cricket -- the South-east of England -- as well as
previously in the Northern Districts in New Zealand, propounds a theory,
the least you can do is listen. Wiser men even may think seriously about
it.
Wealleans has had a superb season since taking over from Bruce Russell
as the professional at Stirling County. Russell's form seemed to suffer
last year with the added responsibility of being pro. This year, he is
back to his best, which merely emphasises the Wealleans theory: ''Up
here in Scotland, you rely a lot on overseas players to win matches. It
does not do a lot for your own cricket.''
The man's right. How often has been heard the almost immortal
cricketing phrase at the scoreboards: ''Beat the pro, beat the team.''
Wealleans is fair in his criticism when he adds on Stirling's behalf:
''We practise well, but there's no substitute for going out into the
middle. But if you are relying on the overseas player, you cannot
improve.''
Certainly, with Wealleans at Stirling this year, and a much more
relaxed Russell, the Williamfield side have shown a marked improvement
-- as in their victory over champions Strathmore last week.
Today they are at Williamfield again, this time facing a Perthshire
side also determined to improve on last season's wooden-spoon place.
Unfortunately, though, that is the spot they occupy at the moment after
five matches in the Caley 80/- Scottish Counties Championship. However,
it's early days yet.
Strathmore's defeat last week took them off joint-top spot along with
Ayrshire -- who now are out on their own -- and the visit of Arbroath
County to Lochside will be another stern test.
Ayrshire, meanwhile, face West Lothian at Prestwick Oval. The home
side's form speaks for itself, but if there was to be a danger round
about August in the race for the league title, West Lothian have the
line-up to cause more than a bit of bother.
Clackmannan County make the trip to Forthill to face Forfarshire, in
third place, while the Partick Thistle of the Counties, Fifeshire -- you
never know what they'll do next -- entertain Aberdeenshire at McKane
Park.
Smart money would be on the unbeaten Aberdeenshire, but the old
unpredictables are perfectly capable of altering that on their own
patch.

FRENCHMAN Fabrice Tiozzo last night won the WBC light-heavyweight
title when he beat Jamaican Mike McCallum in Lyon.
Tiozzo floored McCallum in the second round and kept the upper hand
throughout thanks to his fine physical condition. It was the first time
in McCallum's 14 years as a professional that he had been down.
The Jamaican, fighting in his seventeenth world-title bout, had the
better start and Tiozzo suffered an injured eyebrow in the first. But
despite his experience, McCallum was too slow.
''The legend is over,'' said Tiozzo, refering to McCallum's 48
professionnal victories. ''It was hard but I like these type of
fights.''
On the same bill, American Carl Daniels won the vacant WBA
super-welterweight title when he beat Dominican Julio Cesar Green on
points.

* GARY Jacobs will spend a month training and preparing in the
Catskill Mountains, New York for his tilt at the WBC welterweight title.
It is all part of the former European champion's plan to spare nothing
in the build-up to his challenge against Pernell Whitaker at the
Atlantic City Convention Centre on August 26.
Jacobs must get everything right in his attempt to overturn the clever
former Olympic champion Whitaker, who must rate as one of the the best
pound-for-pound fighters in the world.
''Of course, Gary can win, but if you read the papers you think he
ought to be sending a surrender note in advance,'' said his manager,
Mickey Duff.
''Even if he doesn't come home with the title, a good performance will
make him a very viable contender for one of the other versions of the
title.
''But the important thing is that Gary is sure in his own mind that he
will win against Whitaker.''
Duff's Commonwealth lightweight champion Billy Schwer will have a new
opponent at York Hall, Bethnal Green next Friday.
Robert Gilpert, of New Orleans, has pulled out and Schwer will now
meet the seasoned Mexican Bruno Rabanales over 10 rounds.

PICTURE this. Andre Joubert is to play against France with three wires
inserted in a hand to stabilise broken bones, a legacy of the match with
Western Samoa.
Joos van der Westhuizen cannot sleep at night because a piece of neck
cartilage, dislodged by a high Mike Umaga tackle, protrudes into his
throat and affects his breathing. ''It's annoying but that's all,'' he
says.
Joel Stransky has a damaged retina, Ruben Kruger an unstable shoulder,
and James Small has performed miracles to cure a hamstring. But they
play for their country here in Durban today as driven young men,
desperate for success with the new South Africa.
Perhaps it is self sacrifice that, more than anything, sums up the
will to win of the XV in green and gold. Two more games to go for the
winners and rugby's biggest prize beckons at last.
Morne du Plessis calls his team's match against France: ''one more
step on our great journey.'' And it has been a voyage of epic
proportions for this South African side which has ridden a wave of
well-being from its support to the limit. What Francois Pienaar's men
lack in technique they make up for in blind dedication -- injuries or no
injuries.
Technically the match will be utterly intriguing as the French, who
have so far failed to convince, could well turn the corner in the Natal
heat, while the South Africans, who lost a Test series the last time the
two sides met, have, as winger James Small has said:, ''. . something to
prove . .''
There were moments against the Irish when the two Oliviers, Roumat and
Merle, along with Abdelatif Benazzi were just too much to handle, and
add to that one of the world's most creative wing forwards in Laurent
Cabannes, and the French forward pack starts to have a well-settled
look.
The French, despite playing only steadily, have seldom been troubled
in the scrums and still like to send their forwards charging to the open
side of their scrum half to set up mini rucks before releasing rapid
ball to their backs.
Which is why Kitch Christie has picked such a gargantuan South African
outfit to unsettle, and if possible physically dominate, our French
friends, especially in the lineout. Everyone, by now, knows that it will
all be won or lost in the forward battle, and the selection of Mark
Andrews at ''eighth man'' must mean that they will want to take a leaf
out of England's book and play power rugby in the pursuit of victory.
France will want to crash at the South African back row or run them
around the pitch, but the South Africans look set to maul and drive
their lineouts and get points in whatever way they fall.
Scrums should be even, the French might have the edge in mobility, but
the South Africans should win their own possession and some of France's
which will put the French in the kind of tricky position that they have
not faced this far in the tournament.
The back divisions are populated, frankly, by a galaxy of stars fit to
grace any rugby occasion, but it's a contrast in style between the old
French masters, Phillipe Sella perhaps past his best, and Christophe
Deylaud at stand off, against the more bruising contact of South African
back play and the likes of Hennie le Roux and the abrasive city kid on
the wing who has yet to prove himself fully fit, James Small.
Chester Williams, as the lone non-white in the South African team,
will be idolised each time he touches the ball but, just to confuse the
racial issue entirely, six of the South African team are descended
directly from the French Huguenots, the original settlers to the Cape in
1686.
If ever a team was made to upset the South Africans and knock them out
of the competition then it is this unfancied French side, and their
unpredictability in the face of oppression. If that were to happen then
a nation's hopes would be dashed. Whatever, this is a hard game to call,
but the ramifications of South Africa losing, practically as individuals
and monetarily as a group, could just help them to edge a win.

MURRAYFIELD ice rink directors last night pledged to ice a team next
season, despite a snub from the fans.
Only two out of 140 supporters' club members at Thursday night's
annual meeting in Edinburgh said they would go to watch first-division
ice hockey.
Following the sudden collapse of Edinburgh Racers, the fans still want
a premier-division team, but rink directors say that is impossible
because of cost.
The rink hope to call the club Murrayfield Racers, its old name, and
last night started searching for a coach, players, and imports.
The new team will play in the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup and travel to
Kirkcaldy on Saturday, August 26, to face arch-rivals Fife Flyers.
Meanwhile, Paisley Pirates' hopes of taking Racers' place in the
premier have been dashed. The vacancy was offered to Peterborough
Pirates, who turned it down, but Milton Keynes Kings have grabbed the
chance.

FACED by a few thousand as he stood on the steps at Raeburn Place
following Thursday's Scotland-West Indies international, Scottish
Cricket Union president Jack Kennedy, microphone in hand, joked that now
he knew how Rod Stewart felt.
Sadly, while Kennedy Sr has stars in his eyes, Kennedy Jr -- Iain --
feels like Mike Atherton, looking for one star to help turn Ferguslie's
season around.
''We've fielded well, and bowled well. But the batting has been
abysmal,'' admitted the Ferguslie captain, whose side sit third-bottom
in the DM Hall Western Union.
''This season, we have bowled sides out for about a hundred, then
messed up. Just no-one in our top five has hit runs so far, and that's
the reason we're at the opposite end of the table to what we've been
used to in the last few years.
''Right now, I'd settle for fifth place in the table and a Scottish
Cup place for next season -- and that's extremely disappointing, because
we should be aiming higher.''
The Meikleriggs club face Drumpellier today. At the sharp end, leaders
Progress Software Clydesdale will be involved in a cracker against West
of Scotland at Hamilton Crescent, while second-placed Ayr, chasing a
second successive title, visit Uddingston.
Tilbury Phoenix Kelburne are away to Greenock, while Kilmarnock take
to the road once again, for a trip to Poloc.

DARREN Gough was back to his all-round best at Headingley, claiming
the first hat trick of his career -- with a burst of four wickets for no
runs in five balls -- and hitting a quick-fire 60 as Yorkshire forced
Kent to follow on.
Earlier, team-mate Martyn Moxon had given a reminder to the Test
selectors with an unbeaten double century.
Essex seamer Mark Ilott followed up Thursday's nine for 19 by grabbing
five for 86 -- but could not prevent a Northants win by two wickets at
Luton. Allan Lamb struck 50 not out to guide the leaders to their target
of 189 after they had been 56 for four and 161 for eight.
Tom Moody struck 110 and Graeme Hick 152 in a third-wicket stand worth
250 for Worcestershire, Alec Stewart and Graham Thorpe both bagged
centuries for Surrey, while Jack Russell, hoping to take over the gloves
from Stewart for the second Test at Lord's next week, hit 82 not out for
Gloucestershire.
Middlesex piled on the agony at Colwyn Bay, with Jason Pooley (125),
John Carr (129) and Keith Brown (104 not out) helping them to 459 for
six in reply to Glamorgan's 276.

* CONNECTIONS of Celtic Swing are concerned about the lack of rain as
they prepare the colt for the Irish Derby at The Curragh. ''It hasn't
rained in Ireland for two and half weeks,'' said owner Peter Savill,
''but surely it can't go on like that for another two and a half
weeks.''

PERRYSTON View and Stylish Ways, unbeaten this season, are vying for
position at the head of the market for today's William Hill Trophy, but
there is good reason to oppose both with Bold Effort.
Tony Ives' mount was half a length behind Perryston View when they met
at Newmarket earlier this month, but Bold Effort is 7lbs better off and
also can benefit from today's better going. Five of his other rivals
here were down the field that day.
Stylish Ways is well bred but a line through Welton Arsenal gives him
a lot to do with Bold Effort.
Amancio looks the one to be on in the Queen Mother's Cup. Although
usually a front-runner, he was held up before cruising past the
opposition for a very easy success on Sunday at Epsom. That flexibility
will stand him in good stead in this small field, and Amanda Harwood
looks set to carry off her second women's race in a week.
Charm Dancer can prove the best bet on the Sandown card by taking the
Berkeley Square Stakes. Martin Pipe's runner has won her only race to
date, at Beverley in May, and should have come on for that run. By
contrast, the runner-up, Gentle Irony, now looks exposed and should not
prove capable of pegging back Charm Dancer, despite a large turnaround
in the weights.
A flutter on Boldina Bay in the Rothmans Series may prove profitable.
The daughter of crack sprinter, Never So Bold, got to within five
lengths of Celtic Swing last season, and although that result may
flatter her, she looks the one on form in this field.
Mary Reveley can take advantage of summer jump racing to land the
biggest prize at Market Rasen, the Roseland Group Hurdle. White Willow
was first past the post in his last three races in big fields such as
this, and although he was disqualified last time out he can gain
compensation.
* LES Eyre has laid out Tethys for the Queen Mother's Cup this
afternoon at York, the richest women riders' race in Europe, writes
White and Gold.
The trainer is right to believe that his four-year-old is up to
winning a race of this nature -- she won a good handicap on this course
last term before running a good third in the Jockey Club Cup at
Newmarket.
Tethys will have come on from last month's reappearance at Doncaster
where she was considerately handled after having led to three furlongs
out. The booking of Diana Jones increases the filly's chance.

JACK Berry's followers started the evening in style at Edinburgh last
night when Frans Lad (11-2) won the opener, John Carroll driving the
gelding through a gap between China Hand and Sunshine Belle inside the
last before running on to win well, writes Tom McConnell.
Imp Express (evens) was an impressive winner of the selling race. The
two-year-old, trained by George Moore, led at the half-way stage and was
never threatened, coming home a length clear of Miletrian Refurb.
Jockey Kevin Darley had another two winners when Giggleswick Girl
(12-1) was successful in the cup event before Mick Channon's Morocco
(8-1) landed the mile race.

FORMER ScottishPower chief executive Ian Preston netted about #280,000
before tax last year from share options, it was revealed yesterday.
The Glasgow-based electricity company's latest annual accounts show
that Dr Preston, who retired in February, exercised options to buy
211,453 shares at 227p on November 18, when the market price was 360p.
He subsequently sold the shares.
However, with the current public outcry over directors' pay focusing
on utilities, ScottishPower has gone out of its way to ensure it does
not become embroiled in the controversy by publishing a detailed
four-page note on directors' emoluments and interests.
Michael Kinski, executive director of corporate resources, said: ''We
have gone for full disclosure because we think it is important that the
basis of how we pay the senior people is explained to our
shareholders.''
He added that ScottishPower needed to attract and retain people but
had to balance that with a prudent policy.
Total directors' emoluments rose 37% to #1.49m in the year to
end-March, as a result of new executive appointments and associated
relocation expenses, increased employer's pension contributions and
salary rises awarded on April 1 last year.
New chief executive Ian Robinson thought the 71% pay rise which took
British Gas chief executive Cedric Brown's total salary and benefits to
#492,602 last year, at a time when the gas company was laying off staff,
was excessive.
Commenting earlier this month, he said: ''I do not think the pay issue
is doing the industry any good and I think some people are taking fairly
outrageous steps.''
Mr Robinson, who joined ScottishPower in March, earns a basic annual
salary of #240,000. Given that he was recruited externally from
conglomerate Trafalgar House, it could be considered surprising that
ScottishPower managed to secure his services for only about #30,000 a
year more than Dr Preston, who served the company right through from its
nationalised days as the South of Scotland Electricity Board.
Dr Preston is being paid #40,000 for consultancy advice given between
March and next month.
Finance director Ian Russell, who joined from conglomerate Tomkins
last April, was the highest-paid director. He earned #234,015 in salary,
bonuses and benefits, and was also paid #60,167 in respect of his
relocation from the London area. Mr Russell also received pension
contributions of #18,154.
The company is gradually moving from three-year to two-year rolling
contracts for directors, which will reduce the size of ''golden
parachutes'' for any board members who fall from grace.
ScottishPower managed a 7% rise in pre-tax profits to #375m in the
year to end-March, in spite of a fall in electricity sales at home
because of the mild winter. An increase in the capacity of the
transmission link to England and Wales, however, resulted in a #41m
advance in wholesale electricity sales outside Scotland.

THE David Lloyd Leisure centre in Renfrew has been such an outstanding
success that membership lists had to be closed for 2[1/2] months while
three new tennis courts are being built to complement the existing
eight, writes ANDREW ILSON.
Interest from family members has boosted the client list from 2500 to
3900 and once the extension is finished, another 600 members will be
taken on. That is out of a total membership which overall in the past
year has risen 9% to just under 24,000, implying about 35,000 people on
the basis of 1.5 participants for every name on the list.
The company is currently in talks to finalise the purchase of another
site on the other side of Glasgow although the exact location remains
under wraps.
A tender offer has also been made for a 115,000 sq ft development in
Edinburgh to develop council-owned land.
In the half-year to March, pre-tax profits rose 18% to #3.5m on
turnover 30% greater at #14.3m. Margins have been held back by the costs
of developing three new centres to add to the existing 18 while a golf
course development has been hard hit by the poor spring and will not
make any meaningful contribution for the full year.
The former Wimbledon tennis player has 10 live sites under discussion
at any one time and expects to open three each year at a cost of about
#6m each.
Membership renewal is good at 84%. There is a fairly hefty joining fee
and at Renfrew, a monthly charge of #42. Failure to turn up for a booked
court results in a fine of up to #50.
Encouraging parents is the development of the nursery school where
children can be dropped off for a full week although charges vary
substantially with Renfrew being markedly cheaper than the Birds of a
Feather Chigwell, in Essex.
About 55% of income comes from subscriptions and the rest from food
and beverage, facilities, guest fees and gaming machine income and the
like.
Gearing is currently 63% and seems set to rise to over 90% as the new
sites are brought onstream. But interest cover is high and there seems
little risk of a rights issue for a company which is unique in the
sector in that it has multiple sites which can be expanded by adding on
facilities.
The interim dividend has been raised a sixth to 1.7p.
Full year-profits look like emerging a fifth higher at around #9.1m
which points to the shares at 264p trading at 17 times likely earnings
with a 2% yield. The Lloyd formula looks right for the UK as there are
only 800 leisure clubs in the UK compared with 3000 in Holland which has
a population only a fifth as large.

TEABAGS, I don't know what the country's coming to. Amazing isn't it,
how 10 minutes of luxury turns you into a smug git? There we are,
pouring the Earl Grey amid the muted hubbub and time-scoured elegance of
a five-star hotel lobby and there's a label on a string dangling from
the teapot.
Could have stayed at home and had that. Came out instead to conduct
some field research, some evidence to bring us closer to the spirit of
the times, one small sip across the divide, a feel for how the other
half live, specifically when they fancy a nice cup of tea, and what
happens? Phut goes the thesis. You feel cheated. The teabag has taken
over the asylum for afternoon tea drinkers. The posh with the dosh have
no more taste for a true brew than the rest of us.
It's an enduring human wish to give a moral meaning to everything, so
the foiled quest for leaf tea leads to one inescapable conclusion: the
love of money may not be the root of all evil, it may not buy you love,
or even a decent cup of freshly-brewed tea. It can, though, on other
abundant evidence this week, go a long way to salve hurt feelings,
stroke wounded egos, and shore up inadequate emotional retards.
Take, first, the case of a double-crossing double-glazing salesman:
''#22m lottery winner revealed as a loser in love'' trumpets the
headline, above a strumpet pose from one of the many marital discards in
the life of the latest winner to discard his shellsuit for a
hand-crafted place in the pantheon of global multi-millionaires,
courtesy of good fortune and some rich men who devised a wheeze to make
surrogate taxation immensely popular.
One minute you're struggling with the VAT returns and the zip on the
back of the head, and suddenly your five minutes of fame arrives in
crashing waves of gossip and rumour and revelations of dysfunctional
domesticity. He should worry. In stoic pose, a winking leer and a new
suit from Next, he confides that there is, indeed, another story to
tell. But why should he bother? If Donald Trump can handle it . . .
Invading the lives of the famous, or even briefly infamous, and
revealing their secrets is a way of bringing them to heel. You may be a
winner, they are told, but we know you now. Gossip is a heavy weapon of
empowerment, especially sharpened for all those who fail to win the
roll-over. Or the sympathy of the tabloids.
The match made in Hell between a man from a prefab who wed the
daughter of a multi-millionaire offers further confirmation that it may
be tough out there, on the golden pavements, but there is some
consolation to be found in libel suits. A jury awards three quarters of
a million pounds to a former footballer whose sensitivity and finer
feelings about his intended eviction of his family from the matrimonial
home were obscured in a kick-and-tell tale by his estranged wife.
Obscene? Well, the going court rate for the loss of a child in an
accident is running somewhere around #5000 at the moment, or so I was
told, somewhat forcefully I thought, by our esteemed legal correspondent
Bruce McKain, last spotted with steam coming out of his ears, muttering
something about comparisons with the meagre awards won, or not, by those
seeking damages for more obvious signs of suffering than a wounded
reputation. Such as Scotland's highest award of #120,000 to the
quadriplegic victim of a road accident.
Last, but certainly least, comes his bleached Royal Jacko-ness, the
man who fell from grace or possibly the Planet Tonto, Michael Jackson.
The rehabilitation has begun, with the mega-rich entertainer given
prime-time television rehabilitation space, softly interrogated by a
$4m-a-year interviewer, and allowed to squeak outrage at charges that he
used his millions to pay off those who accused him of interfering with
children in Neverland.
Sitting alongside him was another from the celebrity hall of fame,
with all its disorting mirrors, Lisa Presley, his wife. Allegedly. And
did they look happy? Was Leonard Cohen on Prozac?
Maybe there's some consolation for the rest of us in a study of 22
major lottery winners in the US which found that winners are no happier
than non-winners. They take significantly less pleasure from everyday
events, such as talking with friends, watching television, falling about
at a joke. It seems the peak experience of winning makes all other
experiences pale by comparison.
Maybe we should be secretly relieved when our number doesn't come up.
Have a nice cup of tea to celebrate. But I doubt it somehow.

* I have cash of about #40,000 in four accounts (a little more than
half in my wife's name as a non-earner for tax purposes). My company
pension and retirement pension are approximately #11,000 and #5000
respectively. I also have #23,000 in a London Life personal pension plan
to which I am contributing #800 a month until April next year. This
money is in trust for my two daughters.
In addition I have two endowment with-profits insurance policies with
Scottish Amicable which will mature in 1996 and 1997 with possible
values of #15,000 and #5000.
My investment portfolio consists of TSB Harvest Trust (maturity value
#5000), 5000 ScottishPower and 500 National Power and PowerGen. Last
year I invested #15,000 in Skandia Growth and Income Trust, #6000 in a
Skandia PEP, #5000 in Foreign and Colonial Investment Trust, #5000 in
Save and Prosper Emerging Markets, #5000 in Templeton Emerging Markets,
#2000 in Templeton Latin America, #2000 in a Prolific PEP, #2000 in
Mercury New Europe, #2000 in Invesco Japan and #2000 in TR European
Growth. This year I invested #6000 in Scottish Amicable Guarantee PEP.
I have been advised by an independent financial consultant to invest
#36,993 (not included above) in a Scottish Amicable Income and Growth
Fund, but I have reservations on the amount and the performance of
Scottish Amicable European Fund.
I do not at present require additional income as I am self-employed
and will be at least until April 1996. I would be grateful for your
comments on my general cash holdings, including maturing insurance
policies; the advisability of placing #36,993 in the Scottish Amicable
fund, and my portfolio of existing investments.
* You have substantial funds at your disposal, but even so it would be
foolish to put #36,993 in a single investment. Your own instinct here is
correct, but in your existing portfolio you have invested too much in
electricity shares. This is most obviously true of your very large
holding in ScottishPower, worth nearly #17,000. It is a pity too that
your only other direct equity investments are in the same sector.
In all, you seem to have about #150,000 for investment, and this will
increase by a further #20,000 when your Scottish Amicable policies
mature. We would, therefore, strongly suggest that you consult a
stockbroker about your portfolio. Apart from indicating that you do not
require further income in the next year, you have not made clear what
your investment aims are.
The portfolio you have assembled would suggest the emphasis is on
capital growth. Much of your money is allocated to specialist sectors
such as emerging markets, Latin America, Europe and Japan. This is all
very well if the sector is in favour. This has hardly been the case with
emerging markets, Latin America or Japan. On the whole, we would rather
you used general internationally diversified funds such as Foreign and
Colonial Investment Trust, which cuts out the risk of being unduly
exposed to a sector which is in the doldrums.
Your portfolio should be more broadly based and contain a higher
content of equities with, perhaps, some gilts to take advantage of your
wife's tax status. Hence our recommendation that you seek the advice of
a stockbroker.
* I have had a mortgage protection policy since 1987 when I was in
full-time employment. I was made redundant in 1994 and since then have
had three temporary jobs. Can I still claim on the policy if I am
unemployed for more than 90 days? No claims have been made since the
effective date.
* Mortgage protection policies are usually subject to tight conditions
which vary from insurer to insurer. The answer to you question should be
in the policy small print and you will have to plough through it. If it
leaves you none the wiser you will have to seek an explanation from the
company. If in the end you consider you have been hard done by, you can
ask the Insurance Ombudsman to look into the case.
* For a number of years I have paid contributions to my church under
deed of covenant receivable each four years. We have recently been
discussing covenants under the deposited scheme and it would be helpful
if you could outline this.
* Individuals and companies can give a charity the benefit of an
immediate lump sum while retaining the tax advantage of a convenant. The
deposited covenant is in effect two transactions, one an interest-free
loan repayable in four equal instalments and a deed of covenant for four
annual payments, the net amount of each being equal to a quarter of the
loan. The annual loan repayments cover the amount due under the
covenant.
The charity benefits because it has the use of the money at the outset
then reclaims tax each year on the covenanted payments. However, where
the payments are #250 or more they could be made under the gift-aid
scheme where all the tax reclaim could be made in the year of payment.
The Inland Revenue has very good leaflets on payments to charities.
* My husband has been informed by his pension provider that he has to
bear a 25% deduction of tax and any overpayment must be claimed at the
end of the financial year. This means he has to lend the Revenue a
quarter of his pension each year.
He has been told the reason is that his life-long self-employment
provided the money for his pension contributions. Is this correct?
* The answer your husband has received is the usual response from
insurance companies which do not have the administrative procedures to
pay the pension through the PAYE system giving him the benefit of his
full allowances.
It is, however, possible to request that it does so. Your best bet
would be to get in touch with your tax office. If it writes to the
pension payer and asks that PAYE be operated it may be willing to do so.
* I have recently taken premature retirement. I am 50 years old and
have sufficent income from pensions. I have #50,000 of savings. How can
I invest this in low-risk investments to gain capital growth over the
next five to 10 years?
* You have sufficient capital to have a spread of investments and this
could include a proportion in investment trusts or unit trusts, possibly
through a low-cost PEP. Then you could switch the investment for
tax-free income if you needed to boost your pension in the future. In
the context of the timescale involved this would constitute a rather low
risk, though not as low as a with-profits bond which could also be
considered.
Part of the money should go into a no-risk investment such as National
Savings certificates. Almost in the no-risk category would come a lump
sum Tessa account. Historically, equities have provided the best return
over the long-term unless the exit point coincides with a period of
particular weakness in markets. So only a proportion of capital should
be invested in them, and care should be taken if the investment has to
be realised at a particular time.
* Could you please advise me of brokers offering low cost (execution
only) means of selling shares. I have recently obtained a small number
of Glaxo shares, and a large proportion of their value would be used up
in the sale fees.
* Sharelink has a postal service which is called ''EasiDeal''. This
charges just #7.50 for sales of small holdings of popular shares. This
is believed to be the cheapest service available. The firm can be
contacted on 0121 200 2242.

SCOTTISH bus operator GRT completed its merger with England's
Badgerline yesterday and immediately announced plans for further
expansion, writes ROBERT POWELL.
''We are now in a stronger position to go after further acquisitions,
not only in the UK but also in Europe and further afield,'' said former
GRT chairman Moir Lockhead who becomes chief executive of the new
company, FirstBus.
The new group has 5600 buses, 14,500 employees and 13.5% of the UK bus
market.
This makes it a close second to Perth-based Stagecoach, the largest UK
bus company, which has a 15.1% market share.
FirstBus shares launched into the stock market at 146p yesterday,
unchanged from Badgerline's closing price on Wednesday.
''An adjustment took place when we announced the merger in April so we
didn't really expect any change,'' Mr Lockhead said.
Badgerline shares were converted on a one-for-one basis, giving
Badgerline shareholders 63.6% of FirstBus.
GRT shareholders got 1.9 FirstBus shares for each GRT share to end up
with the remaining 36.4% of equity.
FirstBus has a small and decentralised management structure, with its
operational headquarters in Aberdeen, the former GRT base and its
executive and financial headquarters are in Weston-super-Mare, where
Badgerline was based.
Mr Lockhead repeated assurances that there would be no redundancies as
a result of the merger.
But he said the new group was looking for savings of more than #1m per
year on the centralised purchasing of up to #100m of fuel and vehicles.
Mr Lockhead said FirstBus was looking to buy bus companies elsewhere
in Europe, following the example of Stagecoach's venture into Portugal
last month.
''The commercialism which has shown itself very successful in the UK
can also be successfully applied in other European countries where until
now buses have been heavily subsidised,'' he said.
FirstBus was also on the lookout for opportunities in Australia and
New Zealand, the chief executive said.
In the UK, FirstBus aims to improve the operating margin of all its
20-plus bus companies to at least 15% within a year.
Some of its subsidiaries have already achieved this target, but last
year GRT as a whole only managed a 14.5% margin, while Badgerline was
just under 10%.
''It is a tight and ambitious programme, but I am confident we can
achieve it,'' Mr Lockhead said.
FirstBus is also venturing off the road into rail privatisation.
The group has prequalified in the bidding for three rail franchises in
southern England and Mr Lockhead said it would look seriously at
Scotrail when it comes up later this year.
He said FirstBus was keen to develop ''intermodal transport'' offering
a seamless integration of bus and train services.
''People should be able to buy a single ticket for buses and trains
and make a journey without having to look at two or three different
timetables,'' Mr Lockhead said.
''We have got to provide systems that are easy for people to use and
easy to understand,'' he added.
But Mr Lockhead said buses would remain the core activity of FirstBus
and a rail operations would remain a small part of the overall business.
The group may fund its expansion with new equity, but Mr Lockhead said
it has no plans to issue more shares yet.
Badgerline made a #16.7m pre-tax profit last year and GRT has
estimated an #8m profit for the year to March 31.
First Bus said it was too early to draw any conclusions about its own
likely performance during its first year of operation.

THE increasing pressures on the Government as well as the PSBR figure
for May, well above most expectations at #4148m, had no effect on
sterling yesterday.
Against the dollar, it closed more than a cent higher at #1.6071,
while it was effectively unchanged against the German mark at DM2.2537.
The trade-weighted index recovered 0.3 to 84.8, its highest level since
June 1.
Attention centred on the dollar ahead of the formal G7 statement from
Nova Scotia with the lack of decision other than the commitment to
closer co-operation on currency between the main industrial powers
taking second place to speculation as to what could happen next week.
Some dealers have already priced in a cut in US interest rates but
data suggesting the US economy is still expanding rapidly could lead to
some turmoil.

YORKSHIRE Electricity has bowed to the strident pressure to reduce
directors total remuneration by introducing a new package which will
stop the issue of share options to executive directors.
It is also reducing the three-year rolling contract of employment to
two years ''in line with current best practice.''
It follows a similar move by Boots, which earlier this month said that
it is going to reward the board on a long-term incentive scheme based on
total shareholder returns over a three-year period. This should ensure
that rewards are geared more directly to performance and also that the
contract will be limited to two years.
But this still seems unsatisfactory because the rewards for failure
will still remain high as has been seen recently in the case of Dawson
International. Four departing Dawson directors received #2.17m and one
individual got #1.36m. Shareholders were left with a bruised investment
and a two-thirds reduction in dividend over the last two years and the
employees who were made redundant face long queues at the dole office.
Perhaps a line can be drawn between the pay of those working for
utilities where the general public has effectively no choice of supplier
and the remainder of the private sector where there are usually several
alternative vendors. One should perhaps take with a pinch of salt the
argument that it is necessary to pay huge amounts to stop talent moving
overseas because there is little real proof of any discernible exodus
even to the US.
But a distinction should be drawn between the highly rewarded who were
often incumbents at the time of privatisation or who have come into a
company from outside, perhaps from the Government or the Civil Service,
and who bring contacts rather than managerial capability to a firm and
the entrepreneur who has built up a business.
Kwik-Fit's Tom Farmer is an outstanding member of the entrepreneur
category. His package rose last year by #125,000 to #737,000 -- and good
luck to him because he has transformed a vision into hard reality.
Likewise, Peter Wood of Direct Line whose large remuneration is still
small in comparison with the benefits derived by the motorist and
householder through lower insurance premiums.
Certainly, Yorkshire is setting an encouraging example. Directors will
be paid a cash bonus capped at 20% of basic salary when earnings per
share show real growth over the previous year with the four-year
incentive sheme also based on a 20% limit.
In the year to March, chief executive Malcolm Chatwin saw his total
package increase 20.5% to #316,900 but about #38,000 is being put aside
for the share incentive scheme and will only be paid in 1998 if the
performance targets are met. The targets include Yorkshire
out-performing other electricity distribution companies in England and
Wales. If a director leaves before the end of the target period, the
share entitlement will lapse.
Yorkshire's pre-tax profits jumped 45.6% to #217m thanks chiefly to
lower operating costs.
The dividend total has been raised from 26.7p to 30.42p excluding the
special 90p one-off distribution paid earlier this year. There has been
a 3.5% reduction in tariffs for domestic consumers as from April 1 and a
#10 rebate. It is expecting a further tightening of the regulatory screw
when Professor Stephen Littlechild publishes his proposals on pricing
next month.
Together with the slightly less adventurous steps being taken by
ScottishPower, Yorkshire has bent to the wind and will earn some
deserved plaudits.

THE Public Sector Borrowing Requirement figure for May was a little
higher than the City had expected at #4148m, but the April figure was
revised down by #450m to #3810m.
In the first two months of the fiscal year the PSBR has totalled
#7958m, a modest improvement on the 1994-95 total of #8424m at the same
stage. But there have been no privatisation proceeds yet against #392m
in April and May last year.
There has been some talk on the City that the Treasury will have to
revise up its estimate of a #21.5bn PSBR this year on the basis of the
figures so far.
In the last week of June the Treasury will publish its mid-year
economic forecasts. The most likely reason for revising up the PSBR
figure would be a reduction in the growth projection, which would
automatically lead to lower revenues.
Neither April nor May is an important month for the PSBR since
corporation tax receipts -- the most difficult component to forecast --
are low.
So far cash receipts are 10% ahead of last year. The Inland Revenue is
taking 13.5% more, Customs and Excise 5.5%, and Social Security
contributions 7%. Net departmental outlays are 5.5% ahead.
Last year the PSBR totalled #35.29bn. So the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, is going for a big improvement on the back of
tax increases, tight control of public spending, and an expanding
economy.
If the PSBR looked like being significantly higher than the official
forecast it would make make it more difficult for Mr Clarke to deliver
the tax cuts his party wants in November.

FOUR Scottish universities -- Aberdeen and a consortium of Stirling,
Robert Gordon and Napier -- have been chosen to set up the first centres
of entrepreneurship excellence, backed by Scottish Enterprise as part of
its business birth rate strategy.
The centres, modelled on the approach to entrepreneurial education at
Babson College in Massachusetts, were chosen after a competitive pitch
involving Scotland's other universities.
Welcoming the winners, Scottish Office Industry Minister George Kynoch
said: ''It is a popular misconception that entrepreneurs are born rather
than made.'' The minister also relaunched the graduate enterprise
programme, pioneered at Stirling University, on a national basis. That
programme offers students half-day briefing sessions and two-day
workshops to encourage students thinking of starting businesses of their
own.
Russel Griggs, Scottish Enterprise's director of business development,
said: ''The business leaders of the 21st century are in the education
system now. It is vital they are given an insight into the processes,
risks and rewards of entrepreneurial careers.''

IF these hippy nutters obsessed with veal calves wanted a cause that
would unite the public behind them there are far more popular causes to
fight. Never mind these manky cows, what about transport conditions for
any airline passengers over 6ft? Recently, I've become convinced that
everyone involved in plane design should be made to undergo a course of
root treatment without anaesthetic.
For anyone built more heavily than the average jockey, being squeezed
into an airline seat feels as bad as being forced into a crate, although
the food is admittedly slightly better.
Airline travel is something that exposes ''classless'' society as the
sham we all took it for. Like London society, passengers get split into
three groups: Economy (Fairly cheap. For People paying their own fare);
Business (Quite expensive. For when the company are paying); and First
Class (Extortionate. For those with too much money to care who's
paying.) Trying to disguise Economy with euphemisms like World Traveller
Class or Premium Value Class is exceptionally naff. It would be more
accurate to call it ''Keep Your Arms In, Ignore The Screaming Child
Class''.
On booking any flight you should remember that fares are directly
proportionate to both the legroom and the quality of the booze. Even
Economy passengers are stratified among themselves! The international
travel code states that no matter how many Economy passengers are on the
same plane, no two will have paid the same price for their ticket.
Only people with a root vegetable for a brain ever pay full Economy
fare, as most will have bought a late ticket from a bucket shop
(''Bucket''. Old Indian word, meaning ''12-hour refuelling at
Jakarta''), while others will have bought a Hoover. For a minority, the
Hoover Free Flights Scandal has been a source of great anger. The
majority of the population, in contrast, find it hilarious when
Doncaster's Bill and Edna, having bought a #69 Hoover, can't get to
Budapest without running up a #500 lawyer's bill.
The airlines try to make excuses for their price valuations. You can
get specials like a Saturday Stop-over (the Lighten Up, Have A Few Beers
And Hit The Town Fare), or the ''Slim Man's Leaving On A Tuesday,
Non-Smoking, Won't Eat The Dessert Special Fare.''
I don't trust any airlines, but British Airways is the one that I feel
even less comfortable with after hearing all these stories about it
being ''The World's Favourite Intimidatory Organisation'', er . . . I
mean ''Airline''. Any subversives trying to sabotage the airline's
reputation by, for example, asking for an aisle seat, were receiving
visits from people called Big Nev and being offered assistance in
becoming eligible for Disability Living Allowance. ''Yes sir, we've got
a seat near the front. Will that be with or without kneecaps?'' As a
cowardly male, I usually find that the best way to ''enjoy'' your flight
is to avoid thinking that the only thing supporting this massively heavy
vehicle are a few air molecules bouncing off the wings. Airlines try to
get you nervous before the plane even takes off, by giving you a safety
demonstration. I often wonder is this would be any use at all in the
event of an accident.
Apprehensive individuals like me always listen avidly, taking a mental
note of escape routes, where the lifejackets are, who could be pushed
out of the way in a hurry, etc. Experienced travellers never listen:
they're too busy reading the flight magazine, and seeing how much a VE
Commemoration Rolex would cost on duty free. These guys, since they're
up the front are exactly the ones who should know about safety
procedures.
Executives should be forced to sit an exam on the subject during the
flight to make sure they've picked up the main points. Failure would
mean they get all their Air Miles converted to Air Yards. All that
business flying would only get them a Glasgow to Wishaw return. That'll
teach them.
This column, being an example of responsible reporting journalism,
strongly recommends that everyone should pay attention to the
demonstrations -- if only so they can smirk when the hostess shows you
how to inflate the lifejacket manually.
What use is a lifejacket anyway? If we land on the water, it'll be
after dropping from a great height. You're not going to flop gently on
to the surface of the sea, you're going to go right under. Never mind a
lifejacket, let's have some scuba equipment and some anti-shark weapons!
If anyone has ever survived a plane crash into the sea, it'll be no
thanks to the whistle attached to the lifejacket. Anyone who fails to
notice a flaming Jumbo Jet diving into the sea is hardly going to take
note of a whistle. Rescue helicopters aren't exactly the most ideal
vehicles from which to hear whistles.
Pilot: ''George, was that a whistle I heard?''
Co-pilot: ''I don't know. Let's turn off the engine and see.''
Both: ''Aaaaaaaaaaaaargh!''
This comedy may be perceived as lacking a cutting edge, I mean, you're
not going to get biting social satire out of the old ''So There I Was In
The Departure Lounge'' routine. For anyone who feels excluded and who
wants an in-house flight simulation, just take your favourite armchair,
and put a telephone directory inside each arm rest.
Relax back into that cavernous space! For maximum reality value, place
the seat eight inches from the wall, and stay there for eight hours with
the telly tuned to The Shopping Channel. To simulate Business Class,
repeat the above with two Jeffrey Archer novels. (In the chair. Whatever
you do, don't read them). For First Class simulation take the books out,
drink a bottle of champagne, and have one of the neighbours come round
and patronise you intermittently.
In real airports, the main thing to avoid is the Duty Free. You'll
only get depressed when the only thing you'll be able to afford is the
giant Toblerone. Who buys that stuff?
''Hi, I'm home. Guess what I brought you!''
''Oh George, a giant Toblerone! You shouldn't have.'' (Cue sound of
large, oddly shaped chocolate bar inflicting soft tissue damage on
George's face.) Having dodged the Toblerone, you can smugly indulge
yourself by reading the in-flight magazine. These are bland mags written
by experts in euphemism management.
Every single place reviewed in the latest BA rag managed to be a
combination of ''interesting'' (no-one speaks English), ''exciting''
(you'll be mugged even in broad daylight), ''beautiful'' (it's got palm
trees), ''vibrant'' (pubs stay open until midnight), ''friendly'' (the
pubs never close), or ''historic'' (no proper plumbing). These writers
could write an article that makes Greenock sound like EuroDisney. Well .
. . not such a tall order . . .
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for reading this column. I hope that
you have enjoyed the experience, and I hope that you will join us again
soon. Would any readers who find their punchlines have been taken to
Amsterdam, please see one of our representatives at the terminal.
If you have any complaints about this service, please feel free to
write us a letter in green chubby crayon. We will then book Big Nev to
come round to your house to rearrange the furniture, just as soon as
he's sorted out the bastard that wanted another cup of coffee. Mesdames

YOU would think that knowing the facts and knowing the play there
would be a kind of distance which would stop emotionalism, but listening
to Oh! What a Lovely War (R3) beggared distance of the heart.
Joan Littlewood's extraordinary achievement is that she remarried such
astute political satire with proper sentiment: the powerless who can
laugh at the generals, the complete upfront derision of the idiot
establishment slaughtering the innocents.
At the beginning of Malcolm McKee's re-dramatisation of the play the
nonsense of the Windsors pretending not to be German, the appalling gap
between the cynical lies of the London Times and the derided lives of a
generation, are clear as Bob Dylan singing Oh Ye Masters of War, and
painful as my generation's memories of Thatcher's delight at the sinking
of the Belgrano.
And like the Holocaust which our children must know about without
frightening them into disillusion, we need -- through art as well as
documentary -- to remember.
Oh, the shiver of radical delight on hearing Britannia's Hope and
Glory flimmed into the truth: Onward Christian Soldiers made into a
cabaret of the real. ''There must be no squeamishness over losses'':
that was what they thought, and that was how they operated, and while
looking after their own, they allowed massacres, no, worse, they
hallowed them, thinking with the uneducated disgust of the English upper
class that there would be no redress.
I was thinking listening to it -- Thatcher is a Baroness in my world,
and Littlewood is an artist. Well, who would you bow to?
She did so much that might seem unimportant to people who are not
involved in the arts, but there is nothing marginal about a woman who
can take the vaudevillian tradition, recognise its latent anarchy,
celebrate its articulacy, place it historically, and without any
patronisation, make us laugh.
There is such a danger in forgetting: the churches won't do it for
you: I had forgotten that Jewish men in the trenches were given
dispensation to eat pork, Catholics were allowed to eat meat on Friday,
and labouring on the sabbath for king and empire was OK for the
Calvin-stained boys as long as you forgot you were dying for nothing.
And then, to listen to her voice: what a Book at Bedtime (R4) to
listen to, when the imbecilities of our xenophobic Government have
hassled your consciousness from Frosties to Newsnight, there is a voice
of sane and humane recollection. We have so much to protect: that's the
inspiration. Our children from ignorance, our canto from the
philistines.
We can only guess at medieval angst through art and imagination, but
while there are within recent memory the known voices through the blues
of our hope, we'll be fine. We are blessed to be able to listen to her
as she describes her grandfather's love affair, his aspirant triumph
over despair.

Michael Tumelty reviews the career of tenor Jose Carreras, the most
enigmatic but not by any means the lightweight of opera's celebrated
threesome
TWICE upon a time there were Three Tenors. Each was a superstar. At
least one was a megastar. Then one of the three came up with the idea of
burying rivalries and combining for an occasion. And the world looked on
in awe as Team Tenor took the stage in Italy during the 1990 World Cup.
Millions of records and videos of the event were sold; zillions of
dollars were pocketed.
At the very least it provided a unique opportunity to hear the three
greatest living throats in rapid succession and close proximity. It was
also an intriguing display of the vocal characters and temperaments of
the three: Luciano Pavarotti, Placido Domingo, and Jose Carreras.
Except it wasn't to remain unique. And when Team Tenor II came round,
four years later in the States, it became a grotesque, three-sing circus
which generally demonstrated that two doses of this, even four years
apart, is one too many. The only song they missed that night was, We're
in the Money.
Again, the undeniable fascination was to observe, at close quarters,
the Big Three, their differences, and how they do what they do.
Especially, to my mind, Jose Carreras, who will be in Scotland this
Saturday for a huge open-air concert to a crowd of 9000 at the
Gleneagles Hotel. In Three-Tenorland, there's something very different
about Carreras. He is with them, but he is not entirely of them. He is
the man apart, l'etranger, the outsider. Last week a colleague described
Carreras as the Third Man.
I'm not sure exactly in what sense he meant this: perhaps a
hierarchical sense, perhaps in career development -- Domingo has
broadened, moving into conducting and directing; Pavarotti -- who has
also broadened, so to speak -- has become a one-man, multi-national
commercial empire.
But Carreras is notably different -- separate, even -- from the other
two in his artistic temperament. Think of them for a moment: Pavarotti,
large and full of largesse, plays no role better than he plays the role
of being Pavarotti. Singing, he gets that slightly wide-eyed look,
stares into the middle distance, and the sound streams from him,
apparently effortlessly. A molten sound, at its peak it melts listeners
and opens tear ducts.
There's a different quality of effortlessness about Domingo. He is the
sophisticated, seamless one, always smiling, avuncular, super-urbane of
style, relaxed, confident and laid back in composure and sound.
Jose Carreras is none of these things. Carreras always -- always --
sounds as though he is singing for his life. His voice is suffused with
a focused intensity, a smouldering, pent-up quality, a concentration so
ferocious that it can be almost discomforting to experience. Carreras
communicates a sense of utter commitment with an urgency that suggests
nothing is taken for granted.
And it isn't. Carreras has said himself that he is not, and never has
been, one of those ever-ready tenors who can jump out of bed and belt
out a couple of high Cs before breakfast. ''My problem is uniquely my
own. To have my voice always ready, to make it flow at the drop of a
hat, was, and is, still a challenge for me.''
The supercharged intensity that characterises Carreras's performance
can be appreciated even more if you infer a little inner tension from
his own self-analysis. To be a singer, he said in his autobiography,
requires ''a certain streak of exhibitionism''. He confesses he does not
naturally possess this streak. ''Basically, I'm an introvert, and
singing is an anomalous trait in my personality make-up.''
If that is true, it perhaps helps to explain the quietly fierce
determination that seems to epitomise the man and his singing. It's a
quality he has needed to call on at key points in his career: at the
beginning when backstage bitching accused him of having an easy ride
into the profession on the back of his friendship with diva Montserrat
Caballe; at his debut at the Vienna State Opera, where his voice fell
apart during performance; at his debut rehearsal with Herbert von
Karajan when he completely dried up, and -- most famously -- in the
graphically recorded battle, eight years ago, with the leukemia that
almost killed him.
Carreras plunged into music after being taken, as a young child, to
see Mario Lanza in the film The Great Caruso. It revealed an uncanny
ability for recall -- he could repeat the arias instantly, and in the
style of the singer.
He was sent to the Municipal Conservatory in Barcelona, saw his first
opera at eight -- a seminal experience for him -- and gave his first
public performance at the same age, singing on radio in a benefit
concert. He was immediately engaged by the Teatro Liceo (the great
Barcelona opera house, destroyed by fire last year) for a boy role in an
opera by de Falla. Other boy roles followed.
Serious training only began in his early 20s, when Carreras was about
to decide to go to Italy, the home of opera. He was dissuaded after a
meeting with the remarkable Juan Ruax, who became his teacher. Ruax, a
wheelchair-bound dental technician, happened to possess a fine tenor
voice. He was neither a professional singer nor teacher, and had no
academic credentials. ''But he had an instinct, a gift, and seemed to
know exactly what was right and what was wrong for my voice,'' said
Carreras.
The Carreras career took off in 1970 after he appeared at the Liceo
with Montserrat Caballe (where gossip suggested he got the role with her
sponsorship). The next year he won the Verdi International Singing
Competition in Parma.
Over the next three years a stream of international debuts followed at
opera houses in London, Paris, Prague, Italy, Marseilles, New York and
Berlin. In 1974, during his debut in Verdi's Rigoletto at the Vienna
State Opera, his voice fell apart during La Donna e mobile. The
Viennese, he said, remained ''stoically silent''.
The pinnacle, he felt, was reached in 1975, at his debut appearance at
La Scala, Milan, with its ''mercilessly critical'' audience. In that
audience were two artistic henchmen of the great conductor Herbert von
Karajan. Carreras immediately received an offer to sing Verdi's Requiem
with Karajan in Salzburg in 1976. Karajan himself was so impressed with
the recommendation that he waived his customary audition and proceeded
directly to the rehearsal.
This was a nightmare for Carreras. His voice dried up. ''I opened my
mouth; nothing came out. I couldn't produce a single note, not then and
not later.'' Karajan must have seen something: he didn't sack Carreras,
the performance went ahead, and thus began what the Spanish tenor has
called ''the most extraordinary and important relationship of my
artistic life''.
Carreras never looked back. Karajan, autocrat, dictator, and the most
influential conductor in the world, moulded him. ''I was virgin clay,''
said Carreras, ''the elemental material from which he could build.''
Karajan stretched Carreras, made him produce his best, and took him to
the peak of fame with international appearances and a historic series of
recordings. Carreras has candidly admitted that the association with
Karajan could only have enhanced his own career and reputation.
In 1987, Carreras's world fell apart when he was diagnosed as having
leukemia. His battle with the disease, which lasted a little under a
year and entailed an excruciating bone-marrow transplant, is graphically
recorded in his autobiography, Singing from the Soul. It was no
coincidence, when he beat the disease and made a triumphant ''second
debut'' in Barcelona in 1988, that he chose Puccini's Nessun Dorma --
two years before Pavarotti made it a universal hit, and two years before
the birth of the Three Tenors -- as his closing number. As he sang the
triple repetition of Vincero -- I will win -- that finishes the aria, he
was singing for himself. ''With my Vincero,'' he wrote of that
performance, ''I want to say that I never gave up hope . . . I'll do
what must be done; I will not let myself be intimidated''. As I said
above: singing for his life.
* Jose Carreras appears with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra at
the Gleneagles Hotel on Saturday at 7.30pm.

CLUBBING for grown-ups came to Edinburgh on Thursday night. Clubbing
where you don't have to worry about returning home in time to pay off
the baby-sitter. Clubbing for those who need to get up early for work,
but for whom the full-on dance-floor experience still holds its
hedonistic attractions.
With new clubs springing up like mushrooms on a well-manured pasture,
Baby Boom's gimmick is an early start with a midnight finish. Such a
club is bound to attract the sort of clientele who first stapped on
their dancing boots in the eighties.
The atmosphere, however, was uncompromisingly nineties, swirling
lights, strobes and dry ice enhanced the pounding house beats, while the
bar area -- set apart from the dance-floor -- was tastefully turned out
with tendrils of ivy, paintings, and giant wire sculptures.
For the first few hours, blunted hip hop provided the soundtrack for
some after-work drinking until Ross Keddie took over the decks. By 10
o'clock, he was spinning a friendly blend of disco-orientated garage and
happy, uplifting house tunes. Although not a big name on the Edinburgh
DJ circuit, Keddie knows his trade. He soon worked away from the handbag
arena and was dropping the acidic squelch of classic hardfloor remixes
into the mix with the best in Scottish underground house.
As the club scene matures, there is certainly room for the likes of
Baby Boom. However it will always be a victim of its own concept. No
matter how good the ambience, presentation or sounds, a midnight finish
simply misses the raw hedonism which a frenzied dance-floor reaches in
the early hours of the morning.

KEITH Khan's excursions into the world of multi-culturalism are always
a rare feast of visual extravagance mixed with affectionate irreverence
for the kitschier, Bollywood end of Asian culture. Khan's own background
is a rich one -- Trinidadian Indian -- which gives him a foot, as it
were, in both West Indian and Indian camps.
Making his name first as a designer of Carnival costumes, Maa is the
second part in Khan's epic exploration of Indian women spanning two
centuries and three continents (Moti Roti, Puttli Chunni was the first)
-- this time using a dizzying array of artforms from scratch music to
animation to classical Indian dance -- sometimes to winning effect, at
others with a roughness that feels as if it's come from amateur's night
out.
What can't be denied is either Khan's ambition or Maa's overall
vitality. Not only does Khan have great fun with the spirit worlds of
both cultures in the guise of Caribbean devils and Indian guardian
angels, he also sets it, bravely, against an outspoken story of modern
wife-bashing and domestic violence -- a problem still largely denied in
the Asian community.
Ashish Kotak's story-line may not be the most polished in the world
but Mamta Kaash and Sakuntala Ramanee as two contrasting sisters who,
having bought into idolisation of their husbands find themselves
physically punished for it, carry the weight of the story with
conviction and considerable skill.
Short perhaps on political context, with its magnificent Carnival
plumes, glittering bead-work, and cross-dressing (and traditionally
Indian) transvestite dancers, Maa is however, ultimately, an
overwhelming validation of Khan's belief in cultural diversity and
emancipation in all its forms -- including both sexes.

He's the kind of steady bloke in whose hands you'd leave your life
Real doctors like the spirit, the energy and the feel of the series.
IT becomes immediately apparent when you meet him that Anthony
Edwards, the bespectacled and follicularly-challenged actor who plays Dr
Mark Greene in Channel Four's high-speed medical drama ER, could, in
fact, be a qualified surgeon in real life. The dead giveaway is the
gasper in his hand. As everyone knows, the only people still smoking
nowadays are doctors and nurses.
And actors, of course. A fact which rather destroys the argument I
suppose. Still, he's a nice man that Dr Greene. The kind of steady,
straight-up, no-nonsense, bloke in whose hands you'd be prepared to
leave your life lying on the operating table, in the certain knowledge
that you won't wake up on the mortuary slab.
Curiously enough, he doesn't really need the specs. He's neither short
nor long-sighted. He has, however, astigmatism, which makes his eyes
rather tired after a while. So the Gregorys are not a complete
affectation.
In London this week for a short visit, The Herald tracked him down to
the boardroom of C4's futuristic headquarters. The interview, it has to
be said, was not entirely exclusive. It was shared with perhaps 30
dewy-eyed women, most of them with their tongues hanging out in the
presence of this unlikely object of sexual desire.
And that's the odd thing about Dr Greene. He does for bald men who
wear glasses what NYPD Blue's Andy Sibowicz does for fat men who wear
City Cash Tailors' suits. In short, he gives them new hope in the
pulling-birds department. This, believe me, is a public service the
value of which can never be under-estimated.
And yet it wasn't supposed to be like that. When the ER ensemble was
first put together Anthony Edwards' character was not intended to be
sexy. He was to be the Captain Sensible of the crew. The steady hand at
the tiller. Goody Two-shoes MD. The James Stewart of the casualty
department. Lust on a stethescope was supposed to be provided by George
Clooney (Rosemary's nephew), who plays the hunky, handsome, womanising,
Dangerous Doctor Doug.
But the makers of the series had not taken account of the fickle
nature of female viewers who found baldy far more attractive. The
casting director had clearly forgotten to take account of the sympathy
vote; the fact that women would want to mother Doctor Greene; would want
to take him home and make him his tea.
Before ER, Santa Barbara-born Anthony Edwards, who is 33, was one of
those jobbing Hollywood actors who made a steady, decent, if
unspectacular living from movies and television work. The kind of chap
whose face was familiar but whose name was not. He had minor parts in
films like Fast Times At Ridgemont High, Heart Like a Wheel, and Revenge
of The Nerds.
He was a doomed fighter pilot in Top Gun. More recently, he played
Susan Sarrandon's earnest paralegal in The Client. C4 viewers may well
be familiar with him through Northern Exposure, in which he had a
recurring role as a hypoallergenic lawyer.
So why, he is asked, does every woman in the world want to be Dr
Greene's private patient? ''Mmm,'' he ponders before replying, not
entirely seriously: ''Because I'm a good kisser?''
''Actually, one of the great things about the show is the strength of
the characters. Noah Wyle (who plays student doctor John Carter) is an
incredible character. And the women are all extremely attractive,
strong, intelligent and not your typical television women.
Fine, but what about Doc Greene? ''Well, I think he's the type of guy
who likes what he does and he's good at it. He's the kind of doctor we
all hope we'd get if we were in that kind of situation. It's like when
you get on a plane you always hope that the pilot likes flying -- and
that is very important in medicine,'' says Edwards.
He explains that the response the show has had from real doctors has
been extremely positive. They like the spirit, the energy and the feel
of the series. More importantly, it accurately reflects what it is like
in a busy county hospital where no one gets turned away.
''We get criticised because the board of physicians would like it to
be portrayed as a little more friendly, and they don't like the way it
concentrates on the hours doctors work -- 12 hours on and 12 hours off.
But ER tells the story at a fast pace because that's the way it is. Cook
County Hospital in Chicago runs at that pace -- and the show just
reflects that,'' he says.
Edwards then goes into some outspoken criticism of America's health
care system. ''The health service in America is pretty shameful. It's
horrific that we have so many homeless people in our cities and it's
depressing to go into an inner city trauma centre and there are so many
people there because they can't afford health care and who should have
been able to see a doctor a year earlier.
''I don't understand how a country with the resources and the money we
have will still value the individual's desire to be successful over
taking care of the group. But look what happens when Hillary Clinton
tries to get a health care service. The insurance company says: 'You are
infringing on our right to make money.' It is very American.''
While researching his role, Edwards spent a great deal of time in the
casualty unit of a Los Angeles hospital. The experience was everything
from boring to gruesome, he says.
''LA is gun-wound capital of the world, and I was amazed at what
happened. The good thing that struck me was that there was a real sense
of collaboration between the nurses and the doctors. They work together
to do what they have to do and they are silently proud of that,'' he
explains.
The actor, who is about to start filming the next series of ER,
describes the work as ''really like going to war every day.'' For him
one of the highlights of the current series was working under the
direction of Quentin Tarantino in one episode (to be broadcast soon on
C4). So impressed with the show was the Pulp Fiction maestro that he
phoned up the network and asked if he could direct it.
Edwards says: ''It was episode 23, the second last in the first
series, and we'd been working for 11 months so everyone was pretty
burned out by that time. But Tarantino is such a star in his own right
that we got very excited about it. We wondered if he was going to blow
up the place. It was just about the best show for us.''
He has an enormous respect for British television which, he says, is
far superior to its American counterpart.
''This is because great writers like Dennis Potter said, 'Will I write
for film where maybe people will see my work, or will I write for
television where there is a giant audience?' I honestly believe that you
have set the high standards to which other people can aspire.''
Considering the huge success of the series, is he worried about
becoming typecast? ''I suppose you're always remembered for what you did
last. But being typecast means that at least you are being cast, and
that is a positive thing if you want to be a professional contender. In
the end it is really up to you to make the changes. This might last for
four more years, and in the past I have never thought more than three
months ahead.''
Is he perhaps afraid of the show's quite phenomenal success? ''Well,
only in the sense that we only have one way to go now. You can only go
down from number one and then you have to deal with the criticism. The
challenge is to keep it as good as possible.''
In this week's episode, House of Cards, (C4, Wednesday) Dr Greene's
misdiagnosis of a pregnant woman returns to haunt him, while Dr Benton
(Eriq La Salle) is finally forced to commit his mother to a home.
* THERE are mean streets in every city -- and a television cop to walk
the length of every one of them. Morse in Oxford, Taggart in Glasgow,
Fitz in Manchester, Spender in Newcastle, Resnick in Nottingham. Then
there are the ones who pound fictional beats. The Wexfords and the
Frosts . . . we don't know precisely where they ply their trade, but we
can hazard an educated guess because the urban disguise is often a loose
one. Northampton perhaps? Norwich maybe?
The odd thing about them, of course, is the fact that, in most cases,
their mothers failed to provide them with Christian names. Take Wycliffe
(ITV, Sunday) for example. His given name is Charles, but you would
hardly know it from the dialogue. Charlie? Chic? Chas? No, he is simply
Wycliffe. Or Detective Superintendent if you prefer.
As portrayed by Jack Shepherd, he is a sombre, solitary, taciturn
brand of detective. Not the cheeriest copper in Cornwall. In fact, he's
an old misery guts. Perhaps that explains why Wycliffe is one of the
duller cop shows.
Shepherd himself admits that the programme didn't start brilliantly,
but he believes that it has been improving and developing all the time.
After the first pilot episode, the actor was concerned with playing a
convincing policeman. Then he talked with John Burley, the Cornish
author who writes the Wycliffe crime novels, who advised him to be more
like himself in the role.
''There are two kinds of actors,'' says Shepherd. ''The kind who
research things ruthlessly and would have gone out in a squad car and so
on. Or there are those who follow my route, which is through my
imagination. I go into myself.''
In All For Love, the opening episode of the new series, Wycliffe is
heading the search for a dangerous criminal who has escaped during a
routine prison transfer. Then a cold and calculated murder reveals an
elaborate drugs racket and turns the case inside out.

THE title is Batman Forever but that could fairly be changed to
''Batman Everywhere''. It was the talk of the town following the
Hollywood premiere and it's still the hot buzz. Val Kilmer, new father
and Caped Crusader, is involved in negotiations about two new pictures.
One is co-starring with Marlon Brando in a second remake of 1933's The
Island of Dr Moreau which involved Charles Laughton and Bela Lugosi.
Kilmer will play the shipwrecked sailor who tries to foil Moreau's
experiments with genetic mutation.
The other is The Ghosts and the Darkness based on a true story of a
rampage by two Tsavo lions which killed 130 men during the construction
of the East African railway at the turn of the century. Kilmer is the
young engineer who takes on the lions . . .
* MEANWHILE, his Batman Forever co-star Jim Carrey who plays The
Riddler will soon have the answer for this question: who is the
highest-paid comic star in Hollywood? He is seriously talked about to
take the starring role in Cable Guy and the final pay-day could be as
much as $17m up-front. That will not count percentage profits of the
box-office.
Cable Guy would involve the star of Ace Ventura and Dumb and Dumber as
a lonely television cable channel installation man who haunts one of his
customers -- and makes his first friend. He's also signed to make a
sequel of The Mask but he's only getting $13m for that.
* DESPITE all of that, it would be no surprise if Chris O'Donnell, who
takes on the role of Robin -- a very different Robin from what you might
expect -- becomes a hugely popular star. When he and Batman click the
film roars into an even faster and more furious gear.
* THE enormous interest in Batman Forever -- Warner Brothers are
ploughing more than $35m into marketing to ensure that interest holds --
is also having spin-offs for stars from the 1960s regularly repeated TV
series. Frank Gorshin, who played the wiry, giggling Riddler on TV, has
been getting many offers for stage work. But the clever impressionist is
not just a nostalgia item. Ex-Python Terry Gilliam cast Gorshin in his
latest film, Twelve Monkeys, which stars Brad Pitt and Bruce Willis.
* DIRECTOR Quentin Tarantino, who helped Willis to establish critical
acclaim in Pulp Fiction, was named Best Director at the MTV Movie
Awards. At the hip, young awards the director explained: ''When I go to
Europe I don't watch anything but MTV. That and Baywatch.''
* BUT America is watching Congo. The action-adventure movie based on
Michael ''Jurassic Park'' Crichton's bestseller received a disdainful
welcome from the critics. But that did not deter audiences going to see
Dylan Walsh as a primatologist who gets caught up in a jungle mystery.
''Paramount did a spectacular job of marketing a movie that isn't there,
a movie with no stars and bad reviews,'' said analyst Martin Grove.
''They made it look like Indiana Jones.''
* FILM biographies are now, it seems, what becomes a legend most. Two
are at present being made about James Dean. One stars Leonard DiCaprio
-- he was in Gilbert Grape and Sharon Stone's The Quick and the Dead --
and the other Damian Chapa who is in the authorised version. It is
sanctioned by the foundation set up to protect -- and market -- the name
of the actor who died on September 30, 1955, after making only three
movies: East of Eden, Rebel Without a Cause, and Giant.
''You can rest assured there will be nothing about being a
homosexual,'' said the foundation's lawyer, Mark Roesler, referring to
recent books which have talked of Dean's gay encounters.

HOW to choose? The courtly but professionally anodyne Sir David Frost
helping the aged, or the achingly stupid (but well turned out) Dame
Selina of Scott with her Trump card?
Not a difficult decision, in the end. Both programmes were a disgrace
of sorts; both were TV as public relations; both went to lengths to
perpetuate myths rather than pursue any sort of truth; both were
risible, fundamentally dishonest, and (worst of all) boring. Neither
should ever have reached the screen.
It was clear that Frost was going nowhere with Thatcher: The Path to
Power -- And Beyond (BBC1, Monday) when she stamped on a gentle question
about the Boy Mark with some claptrap about her offspring being entitled
to their privacy (not a view being taken by the American courts) and
Frostie offered not a whimper in return.
Was it she, with her known preference for lightweights such as Jimmy
Young, who demanded this particular interviewer? Did she vet the
questions? Did she inform the BBC in advance that this unedifying
example of naked book-plugging would be both partial and deeply party
political? Probably not.
The best guess is that the corporation felt able to anticipate her
ladyship and accommodate her by giving Frost the job. Hard questions,
never mind straight answers, were never on the agenda, and like citizens
of the old USSR trying to read between 625 lines, we had to work out
from her alarming looks and grating, disconcerting sound, what was
really being said. It was state television at its best.
My dictionary reminds me, meanwhile, that ''trumpery'' derives from
tromperie -- a French word for deceit -- and is defined as ''worthless,
paltry (though often showy)''. As a review of the Selina and the Donald,
that about wraps it up. An hour of pictures of rich people presided over
by a woman disproving that nature, if not reviewers, abhors a vacuum.
This reviewer's nature also abhors aged men setting out to recapture
your past in order to sell it back to you. The Rolling Stones were
beyond a joke 15 years ago, but that news has yet to reach the BBC.
Therefore, and for the second time in a week, the corporation lent its
name to corporate advertising and gave itself over to The Rolling
Stones: European Premiere Live (BBC1, Wednesday).
It wasn't ''live'', of course, any more than the Stones are, or ever
were, ''the greatest rock and roll band in the world''. It was a handy
plug for the band's upcoming British dates, however, and a chance to
judge what kind of embalming fluid Keith is drinking these days. As has
been the case for almost half of my lifetime, the music was so bad
Americans liked it.
After all the fuss over casting, Alan Plater's Oliver's Travels (BBC1,
Sunday) meanwhile went some way to demonstrating that irony has become
the vice Anglais; a way of avoiding direct speech; a kind of mannered
eccentricity; a too-familiar method of probably saying what you probably
meant in a gentle, no-hard-feelings, sort of way.
Jazz, crosswords, redundant academics and murder? Who needs it? Alan
Bates did his stuff sufficiently well for you to wonder what extra
dimension Tom Courtney (Plater's original choice) would have brought to
the part. Sinead Cusack was allowed to be luminously charming and Wales
looked very pretty. But this was aimlessness as an art form; mild social
comment tricked out as a mild mystery. Not once, as Bates tootled along,
did you feel that this was drama demanding to be watched.
The same was true of Screen Two: Bliss (BBC2, Sunday). The warning
that Les Blair's script had been ''improvised'' by the cast ought to
have been enough. The news that it also centred on a prat of a civil
servant (stereotype anyone?) who couldn't get laid, and a writer of porn
who couldn't find love, should have done for the attention span what
Thatcher had already done for credulity.
But no: we ploughed on, increasingly aware that what improvisation
really means is actors taking three sentences to say what anyone else
would convey in one. With the sort of narrative rhythm to which the
late, great Frank himself aspired, the piece was a little nugget of
gold. Just poetry, just art, just people talking about what made a
writer tick.
''The spent purpose of a perfectly marvellous life suddenly glimmers
and leaps into flame,'' O'Hara wrote. What are we going to hate with The
Late Show gone? Castles (BB1, Tuesday and Thursday) no doubt. Thus far
we have been lucky enough only to glimpse this ''middle class soap
opera'', but indignation will doubtless soon get the better of us and
we'll actually watch the cursed thing from beginning to end.
So pernicious have soaps become, that otherwise serious people are
mounting honest defences of these dramas designed by committees.
Claptrap is being talked of Dickens, narrative traditions and social
comment. It is an argument for another day, perhaps.
In the meantime, the one good question to be asked of a BBC embroiled
in yet another row over cutbacks is simple: What's the excuse for
another Eldorado?

WHEN Jerzy Maksymiuk conducts it, there is no doubt about what Lyell
Cresswell's A Modern Ecstasy is telling us. Even without the abrasive
eloquence of Patrick Maguire's words, and the way Susan Parry and
Stephen Richardson sang them last night, this was the music of war and
obliteration and the end of the world.
Though others have conducted it, Maksymiuk is the one who dots its
indelible ''i's'' and strokes its indelible ''t's'' in a manner that
leaves you bruised and numb.  He even, on this occasion, knocked what
felt like at least five minutes off its running time, pushing it towards
annihilation with the perception that perhaps only a Polish conductor of
a certain age could bring to it.
If this was a war requiem, it was one that provided no hint of
Britten's final balm. Once the strings had stopped keening, the brass
had stopped obscenely blustering, the alarm bells had stopped ringing,
what was left was the same sense of convoluted desolation with which the
music had begun.
In comparison, Martin Dalby's Tower of Victory, at the start of the
concert, sounded positively lush, even though it exploited the darkest
reaches of the orchestra in its evocation of a mysterious Indian legend.
Maksymiuk probed its sombre timbres with startling clarity before being
joined by Rolf Hind in a bright-toned, brittle account of Dominic
Muldowney's piano concerto.
Here again a fierce light was shone on what turned out to be a nervily
fragmented experience. The work's roots in Ravel and Gershwin were
restlessly uncovered, and its taut, sharp rhythms made an apt prelude to
the bigger issues of the Cresswell.

FUN and frolics on the concert hall stage last night for the first of
the Royal SNO's Glasgow Prom concerts. The fun came from conductor Carl
Davis whose choice of waistcoats raised more than a few eyebrows; and
the frolics came from host Nick Bailey who was intent on manufacturing
some romantic liasons within the large audience to feature on his Sunday
morning show!
Musically, the Prom offered a neatly packaged selection of pieces
associated with romance though not necessarily dating from the romantic
era. The overall feel was not unlike a couple of hours of Classic FM
although thankfully Bailey was unable to interrupt the movements of
Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto which received a fabulous airing by
Dong-Suk Kang.
Kang made his name in performances of Sibelius and his poetic touch is
perfectly apt for Mendelssohn. An emotional melting pot of a piece, he
chose to tease out the principal melodic motifs, bending and stretching
the phrases with startling results. Cadenzas revealed an incredible
command of his instrument, furthered by an unbelievably fast finale
threatening to burn out the orchestral gear box.
Ravel's Bolero was the second-half feature. Here Nick Bailey went a
little too far in suggesting that the piece is an ideal aphrodisiac.
Contrary to his belief, this controlled and perfectly paced
interpretation had a deeply hypnotic effect, triumphant rather than
orgasmic in conclusion.  Davis's affinity with American music was
crystal clear in an exquisite airing of Barber's Adagio. Universally
understood as a sublime exploration in counterpoint, the Royal SNO
strings delivered a breathtaking performance. A promising start to the
Prom season. Gerswhin, Ellington, and Orff's Carmina Burana tonight and
thankfully no Nick Bailey.

JACK McLEAN writes (June 15) about the first time women had a drink in
Tennent's Bar in Byres Road, Glasgow. Clearly he wasn't there at the
time or if he was he was under the influence of too much of the amber
stuff to remember anything about it.
I was there and I was in fact the first women to buy a drink in that
very pleasant establishment. It was the day the Sex Discrimination Act
came into force, December 29, 1975, which among other things, made it
unlawful for public houses to discriminate against either sex. A gallant
group of us gals decided to go on a pub crawl, visiting only
establishments which previously had refused to serve women. Our first
stop was to be Tennent's.
We were not from ''Queen Margaret Union of Glasgow University''. We
were all in paid employment and were aged between about 23 and 32. We
were not ''cheered to the rafters'' and were certainly not ''bought
drink by the boys''.
When we went in the barmaid gave us a welcoming smile and said it was
about time. Some of the men in the bar nodded in agreement with her.
There were neither cheers nor jeers. I bought the drinks out of our own
kitty. We wore our normal clothes and dressed neither up nor down.
Later we went to some other male-only howffs in the city centre where
our reception was less relaxing. In one pub the barman refused to serve
us but we insisted on staying until he checked out the law. Eventually
the manager said we could be served but that he would get legal advice
in the morning.
We were accompanied throughout by a young Herald reporter (well, he
was young then) and I am sure that he can verify my account of events.
His name was Allan Laing.
The Herald's coverage of our gals' evening out was accurate and good,
though I did take some offence at being described as ''pretty'' because
I thought it was irrelevant to the story. Now I realise he probably just
meant to be chivalrous.
Nor did I like the inaccuracy about me buying 13 ''half pints of
lager'' in Tennent's. I doubt if any of the women in our group were
interested in half measures of anything.

I AGREE with almost everything Mr Andrew A Reid says on finding money
to pay our nurses (June 14). Particularly that NHS trusts should not
receive financial supplements from their parent health boards. As one of
the first trusts in Scotland, with a success record over our first three
years, our increased income has come about by treating more patients,
exactly as it should be.
Of our 2000 staff, some 50% are already on locally negotiated pay;
this includes 25% of our nursing staff. The increased flexibility and
cost improvements this has brought about are significant factors in us
realising the benefits of our major investments in, for example, day
surgery (#3.7m) and patient-focused computer technology (#1m plus).
To maximise this investment, all staff really need to be on local pay.
By paying all our staff 3% -- the going inflation rate -- we were
confident of securing this objective by local negotiation.
Our health care contracts were concluded with our health board on this
sound premise. To be subsequently informed that some 40% of our staff
(those on national pay) are ring-fenced from this strategy raises real
issues that must be discussed with our health board.
Cost improvements are exactly that. It is not all about savings.
Increased patient activity and resultant enhanced income, combined with
full staff co-operation, bring real benefits to patients and taxpayers.

THE Herald Essay has been a welcome addition to the paper. While I
enjoyed Malcolm Dickson's contribution (June 10), I would have to
question one element of his analysis.
He states that ''not all SNP supporters want independence'' without
offering any evidence. I suspect he is referring to polls where a
sizeable number of people who identify themselves as SNP voters go on to
say their first choice for constitutional change is devolution. This is
not the same, as Dr Dickson implies, as opposing independence.
Indeed, given the pundits' presumption that Labour will win the next
election, this is a section of the population the SNP must target. There
is a possible scenario that an incoming Labour government might wish
quietly to forget about devolution as too awkward and time-consuming.
To be fair to Mr Blair, after almost 20 years of immensely damaging
Conservative rule, all Labour MPs will have a list of legislation they
would wish to see enacted. For the vast majority, representing English
constituencies, devolution for Scotland is unlikely to be high on the
agenda.
If we still only have three or four SNP MPs after the next election,
it is easy to see how the commitments will be set aside. The paradox is
that for people whose first choice is devolution, the best way to make
sure it is delivered is by putting their cross against the party which
promises independence.

ALLAN LAING, reporting BBC Scotland's plans for its own Six O'Clock
News (June 12), writes that such a programme ''would put paid to the
natural English bias on the national news'' and would also avoid the
duplication where ''important Scottish stories are covered in depth in
the main news and . . . again -- in depth -- in the regional bulletin''.
If important Scottish stories are covered by the main news where is
the English bias?

THE war for Bosnia, as it now must be called, has lasted since 1992
and has found the international community conspicuously ineffective. The
latest pronunciamento from the G7 meeting in Halifax is sadly familiar:
all the warring parties need to exercise restraint, and negotiate. That
may be sound advice -- indeed it is -- but there seems no chance of its
being accepted. The Bosnian Serbs hold nearly three-quarters of the
former Yugoslav republic. They have besieged its capital, Sarajevo, for
longer than the Nazis besieged Leningrad.
Only an umambiguous military defeat will make the Bosnian Serbs change
their minds, and there is no way of predicting whether or when that
might arrive. They enjoy a preponderance of weaponry and, though the
support of the main body of Serb people in the Serbian Republic itself
has now been withdrawn, the weight of sophisticated armament has so far
remained sufficient to counter the numerical superiority of Bosnia's
Muslims.
That was the position until late this week when a new Bosnian
government (mainly Muslim) offensive was launched to break the siege of
Sarajevo and disrupt Serbian communications between the ring of steel
which they have thrown round the city and their main supply bases to its
east. It looks like a classic case of men against metal, and the
offensive's outcome is anybody's guess. It will, however, almost
certainly be clear before the lapse of the month still required for the
new UN combat force, including its large British contingent, to deploy
on the ground.  This new body, designed to protect the UN peacekeepers,
may arrive to protect their withdrawal. A military decision at or around
Sarajevo could signal, if not the end of the fighting, the end of the
UN's humanitarian intervention. The new forces may be redundant, though
that would be better than their being sucked into the war. Meanwhile,
the offensive has again exposed the deep divisions within the UN and
even within the Western allies. The Chinese and Russian governments have
not backed the new combat force, whose precise role anyhow remains
unspecified.
The US government, which has consistently sought a major say in the
whole Bosnian imbroglio, wants to remain militarily uncommited, except
in the air; and it is unwilling to meet any share of the UN's additional
costs. President Clinton may have wanted to pay but has been overruled
by his own Treasury: he has failed consistently to carry Congress, or
domestic opinion, with any kind of forward policy in a region which has
no obvious American interest at stake.   Western governments, including
our own, feel that they have a humanitarian interest and a focused one
as near neighbours of what was Yugoslavia. This interest has been
embodied in the UN's peacekeeping role. So far the peace has been too
fragile to be kept. There may be an opportunity to do so -- to hold the
ring, in effect -- if the Serbs suffer a serious setback at Sarajevo,
but the worrying probability is that were they to grow more
accommodating the Bosnian government would be ever more intransigent.

TWO curious and perhaps related developments have been taking place in
British society in the nineties. The first is the scramble for the
middle ground in politics. Mr Major with his classless society and
Citizen's Charter at times seems to want to be the People's Party, who
in turn have turned to glitzy PR initiatives culminating in the launch
of New Labour and ditching of Clause 4. The messages seems to be that
spin doctors win elections, not splits over doctrine. Neither party
leader seems to wish to promote sectional interests.
Yet the second discernable trend in the past five years seems opposed
to this web of consensus which has fallen over political leaders. It is
a polarisation betwen rich and poor, between those with independent
means and those caught in a dependency culture.
Last week's review of the social security system simply underlined
what political leaders are now agreed upon -- that the welfare state is
in urgent need of reform. Created to bridge poverty gaps, it has become
a source of grumbling resentment for those who count themselves neither
rich nor poor, namely those in the middle ground to whom the
aforementioned political leaders appear to be appealing.
The response to the growth of social security expenditure by Tory
Governments (Thatcher and Major) has been to increase the role of means
testing. It has proved to be in vain. First, because means testing tends
to cost more to administrate. Second, these means tests create new
poverty traps because those who only just fail to qualify for benefit
are cast into a wilderness of private-sector pricing which they cannot
afford. Third, means testing tends to hurt those who occupy precisely
that middle ground in society, the middle classes upon whom the Tories
have always been able to rely for their strongest support.
Perhaps now the new political consensus can be used to reform the
welfare state, but it will not be easy. There are bold and imaginative
schemes on offer which integrate income tax, national insurance, and the
benefit system into a single public service. The Liberals have long
espoused such a system in which the needy pay negative income tax.
It also has the advantage of efficiency as people move from one
category to another in changed circumstances. It is also easier to
detect fraud. The trouble is that savings from computerisation and
rationalisation in this sector would create another avalanche of
unemployment -- the very civil servants who at present administer the
separate tentacles of the tax and benefits leviathan.
If consensus politics cannot tackle this problem, there are those who
are willing to advocate more radical solutions. Reviewing Mrs Thatcher's
latest book The Path to Power this week, Simon Heffer is in no doubt
that Mr Major has unlearnt the lesson of propitiating the middle
classes.
He goes on: ''Epic amounts of money contributed to the Treasury by
natural Tory supporters are being spent to maintain, in dependency,
millions who would not vote Tory if their lives depended on it, yet
ironically those millions have more reason to love this Government than
most.''
With relentless logic he argues that those who believe in a classless
society cannot therefore believe in a middle class and so cannot appease
it and will therefore be doomed to fail to appeal to the middle-class
voter who demands his/her interests be respected. It is what many people
are thinking and craving in private, even if the political leadership of
Government and Opposition are talking up a middle ground of consensus.
I am fairly certain it will result in severe punishment being
inflicted at the General Election on the Tory Party by its traditional
support. But my reason for choosing this topic has nothing to do with
politics. It is to raise the religious/moral issues arising from our
drift into a two-nation society while proclaiming one-nation values.
Traditionally in such matters the churches were on the side of the haves
and the have-nots rarely crossed a church door.
In more recent times the churches have tried to be the conscience of
the nation, urging a bias to the poor in social policy and attacking the
politics of self interest.
Where will the churches stand in the debate about the future of the
welfare state? In recent times leading churchmen have implied that
increasing the social security budget would cure many of society's ills.
Alas, that thinking is woefully inadequate when it is increasingly
emerging that the cure is part of the illness.
The role of the churches in this debate on the future of our welfare
state could be enormously influential. It will not be if they continue
to pipe the same tune as they did in the Thatcher years (when social
security spending actually increased in real terms), for they will be
seen as increasingly perverse.
Yet, the churches know what it is to be a mainly middle-class
institution whose natural support has deserted them. They know that
tinkering with doctrines or worship does not actually bring their
supporters flooding back.
The only thing that a church or political party can do in such a
situation is to stick by what it believes in and hope that the years of
famine will pass. That may not be much consolation for those trying to
hold the middle ground in politics or religion, but it sometimes proves
to be the higher ground when the storms and floods arrive.

I READ two amazing articles on women's representation in Parliament:
the first was in Unicef's The Progress of Nations 1995 Report, the
second in The Herald (June 9).
The latter, by Ken Smith, provided a fascinating insight into the
myopic world of one of Labour's male economists, Jim Stevens. It seems
that he really does believe that ''there is now a level playing field
for women'' and that the ''glass ceiling is shattering all around us''.
The reality is that the glass ceiling is still firmly in place. He
offers the false premise that, just because one or two women make it to
the top of their professions and a few women make it to Parliament,
equality has been reached. Far from it.
How does his claim of equality stand up to a scrutiny of the number of
women at the top in local government or teaching, two areas where women
dominate in the ranks? Or where, indeed, are the women judges in
Scotland?
In looking at ''the wider changes taking place in society'', Jim
Stevens would do well to look at how women are the new poor; how women
as single mothers have become society's scapegoat; and how women still
have to juggle three day-jobs of carers, domestics, and low-paid
workers.
What I and others want to see is significantly more than three extra
Scottish women MPs. I want to see sufficient women MPs to begin a
transformation of our society. This demand is echoed throughout the
world. There is a growing recognition that only by having more women in
parliaments will we see a real challenge to the imbalance of economic,
political, and social power that throughout the world has feminised
poverty.
Frene Ginwala, MP, Speaker of the South African Assembly, argues in
Unicef's report that increasing the number of women in parliament is not
an end in itself. ''The point of having more women MPs is that women
bring different experiences, perceptions, and priorities to the
decision-making process -- which leads to different decisions being
made.''
As a result, the whole of society will benefit, but it will take more
than the handful of women MPs we have at present to begin to make a
difference. South Africa, with 25% of its new parliament being women,
stands more of a chance than us.
At the heart of Jim Stevens's myopia is his belief that we have an
open and fair society; that our political, legal, and other structures
really are equal. Women worldwide know differently and women worldwide
offer the same analysis of why this is so.
Two questions should be asked by men like Jim Stevens. First, why, if
our society is really open and fair, are there not more women in
Parliament, more women in top jobs, more women earning more than the
average male wage? Secondly, why are we arguing for more women in
Parliament?
To finish, I'd like to take up the much argued point that women-only
shortlists will not give us the ''best person for the job''. Women's
experience is that we need to be better than our male counterparts in
every way. As Helena Kennedy, QC, said at a conference on women's rights
in Glasgow recently, ''As women we will know we are equal when we are
allowed to be mediocre (like the men) and still get to Parliament.''

LOS ANGELES: Actress Elizabeth Taylor is to undergo hip replacement
surgery at a Los Angeles hospital on June 19, her spokeswoman announced.
Chen Sam said the 63-year-old star injured her right hip recently
while doing water aerobic exercises in her pool at her Bel Air home.
''Miss Taylor's doctor had told her that hip replacement was
inevitable some time in the future. The water injury hastened the need
for the procedure,'' she said. The actress had hip replacement surgery
on her left hip in March last year.--Reuter.

IT WASN'T until Linda Arthur married a Scots chap that she found the
inspiration for her knitwear designs. It wasn't that she was viewing the
world through rose-coloured glasses, it was that he brought her to
Glasgow to live. Here she was introduced to the 'Wally Close'. It was
the distinctive ceramic tiles which decorated the closes of Glasgow
which became the basis for her jumpers.
''Since day one when we were house hunting I've been fascinated with
the tiles in tenement buildings and the fact it used to be a status
symbol to have tiles in your close. The whole thing, including winching
in the closes, totally fascinated me. It seemed logical if I used the
tiles to inspire my patterns that they would stand out and be different
from all the other knitters in Scotland.''So on the back of this, Wally
Jumpers was born.
Her first tile design was from her own close in Deanston Drive in
Glasgow, but her technique hasn't changed much. ''Some are pictures,
others are rubbings in the close and superimposed onto graph paper. One
square of graph paper represents one stitch and from there you will see
if the design will work in knitting.'' However some of the most
beautiful tiles don't make stunning knitwear . . . because the tiles
contain circular designs.
The initial designs were laboriously hand knitted by Linda herself but
she soon realised the only way to make Wally Jumpers a financial success
was to go mechanised and that meant training. The raw material Linda
uses is home grown Shetland wool and she is a self-confessed colour
freak. Linda has now progressed to add a new line of 'designer Wally' to
her collection. Still staying with the same tile designs she has opted
for longer cardigans and waistcoats with matching wraps. Some of these
garments are ankle length which meant initial pocket problems. ''Where
to put the pocket? There is a height everyone likes their pocket but
everyone's arms are at different levels. I gave up trying in the end and
put the pocket at the bottom of the cardigan mid ankle length and that
seems to be a talking point.''
The designer Wally is soon to be seen on the catwalk as Wally Jumpers
take part in the Clothes Show Live coming to Glasgow, June 17-19, and
she faced tough competition for her clothes to be modelled. It's an
exciting time for this Glasgow designer but she knows that when people
pull on her knitwear they are getting more than just good quality and
design. ''For a lot of people their primary concern is not for a piece
of knitwear, but a piece of history. What draws them has to be the story
of the wally tiles.''

If the Tories are to be precipitated into a bitter leadership contest
this November, the key man will almost certainly be the Scot Norman
Lamont. Not only is Lamont the most likely candidate to stand against
John Major; he might just, the first time around, win the contest, thus
wrongfooting the more canvassed candidates such as Heseltine and
Portillo, waiting in the wings
TWENTY-THREE years ago I sneaked into a Tory candidate selection
meeting to stand, unobtrusively at the back, as a vastly experienced and
bewhiskered headmaster (now Sir Robert Rhodes-Boyson) competed with a
lithesome young eagle, a fledgling merchant banker, Norman Lamont, for
what was then a safe seat in Kingston-Upon-Thames.
Before I was thrown out, I listened to them both perform.
Rhodes-Boyson, who had taken over a grotty London comprehensive school
and turned it into a disciplined by-word for academic achievement,
seemed to me the man for middle-class Kingston. They chose Lamont.
Now, the constituency disappears in boundary changes. Now, your man
Lamont, former Chancellor of the Exchequer and no longer a fledgling,
hovers at the periphery of the political scene. He searches for a way
back into the limelight. He requires to influence events again.
My 1972 crime as a reporter conning my way into that members-only
selection meeting was nothing compared to Lamont's misdemeanour earlier
this year when he voted with an astonished Labour Party against Mr Major
in a key Commons vote. This is a bitter and vengeful Lamont.
You would be entitled to think that he has been nourished over the
years by the loathing of Ted Heath of Thatcher and the disenchantment of
Thatcher for Major. He believes that Major has made a fool of him and
this he cannot abide.
He thinks that Major -- the man he campaigned for as a replacement for
Thatcher as Tory leader -- ditched him. As Chancellor, he took the
discredit for ''Black Wednesday'' devaluation when he was doing nothing
more than implementing the Exchange Rate Mechanism policy of the Prime
Minister and his Cabinet. He was not allowed to resign because Major
would have had to resign too.
He was left hanging on the wire for a damaging year, a Chancellor
without credibility at home or abroad. Not for him the grace of a
Chancellor Callaghan resignation after devaluation and a return to high
office as Home Secretary, and, eventually, Wilson's successor as Prime
Minister. Lamont was fatally damaged by Major in 1992/93.
Major sidelined him with the offer of Environment, instantly refused,
and Lamont has been brooding on the back benches ever since, nursing his
wrath in just the way you might expect of someone who spent the first 10
years of his life in Shetland. As it turns out, Major damaged his own
credibility even more than Lamont's. Now Lamont seeks to exploit this.
You might describe it as a blood feud.
Major seeks to transform the bigoted politics of Ireland; so Lamont
aligns himself with the ultra-Unionist cause. Major looks for a middle
way in Europe; so Lamont poses the ''unthinkable'' question -- why don't
we just get out of the increasingly federalist European Union?
Norman Lamont is not so much a ''stalking horse'' for an autumn
challenge to Major's leadership as a stalking idea, an alternative
strategy for Tory General Election survival. As such, he is becoming
much more dangerous to Mr Major. Three nights ago Lamont used a meeting
with the Prime Minister and more than 50 Euro-sceptic Tory back benchers
to demand that he come off the fence and say ''never'' to British
participation in a single European currency.
Major has spent the past two years avoiding such a commitment in the
full knowledge that if he gave it, he might lose five members of his
Cabinet. Lamont knows this well, but Lamont wants to prick Major. If
Major does not turn his way on this issue, Lamont will feed inclinations
to ditch him as Prime Minister.
There is justification for his feeling of betrayal. Lamont was one of
the first of Thatcher's Cabinet to spot that she could be finished. He
was perhaps the first to put his weight behind Major to succeed her. He
led Major's leadership election campaign and when it was won, he
demanded the top job as Chancellor.
He may have sensed that this reward was not whole-heartedly given. If
this was indeed the case, Major was wrong to post him for this crucial
position. Well before this, Thatcher had agreed Chancellor Major's
disastrous ERM policy of binding the pound to the Deutschmark at the
wrong rate at the wrong time.
Lamont faithfully pursued this policy for Major until the markets
dumped sterling. In the meantime, personal embarrassments (over-spending
on his Access card and a lady of dubious propriety renting his London
property) had rendered him vulnerable. His judgment was questionable, as
was Major's increasingly tenuous loyalty to him.
The feline Lamont was intellectually affronted. The Brixton boy Major,
whose academic achievements might be mocked by, say, Sir Rhodes-Boyson,
had despoiled the amoure-propre of the Loretto scholar who got to
Cambridge and, nursed through finals by a gaggle of female fans,
achieved a 2:1 Honours degree in economics and politics.
Lamont at his best can see off anybody in debate, including his
Cambridge contemporaries Kenneth Clarke and Selwyn Gummer. And he had
the looks to go with his talent.
Lamont is no snob, but his intellectual arrogance cannot suffer what
Major has done to him. The political gloss that Lamont puts on it is
that Major is incompetent and is about to lead the Tory party into the
wilderness. No more, apparently, is required to justify his present
challenging conduct. This man's resolve is now as remorseless as the
winter storms of Shetland and the Firth of Forth.
Even if Major were to give him what he wants (on Ireland and Europe)
tomorrow, I suspect that Lamont would find something else even more
impossible for the Prime Minister to deliver. Seasoned Tory politicians
believe that Lamont's judgment has been taken over by his bruised ego.
And this demands that he prove to the world that Major is, after all, a
lesser species.
Those who judge him thus envisage a Lamont game-plan like this: he
stalks Major for the leadership, forcing the Prime Minister to resign
after a first ballot in November. The successor (whoever it is does not
matter), reinstates Lamont to the top echelons of Cabinet Government. A
grateful Tory party finds him another safe seat in which he can survive
the electorate's retribution on the Tories at the next General Election.
An important element of this scenario is that while Lamont profoundly
believes that he could lead the Tories better than Major, leadership
does not matter to him so much as the restoration of his credibility as
a serious politician. This makes him exceedingly dangerous to Major in
rather the same way that Michael Heseltine was fatal to Margaret
Thatcher. Lamont is not satisfied with his directorships -- Rothschilds
and others. Lamont is concerned about what the history books are going
to say about him.
Some colleagues, particularly those who think that he has been badly
treated by Major, calculate that Lamont has become obsessive. He
believes that he befriended Major and helped to make him a Prime
Minister -- only to be spurned. Lamont will not be satisfied until he
has been vindicated.
Other Tories, Euro-sceptics included (do not forget that as
Chancellor, he was at Major's side in the Maastricht Treaty
negotiations), are beginning to mock him. He does not fit into their
schemes concerning whether Major should be brought down, and how, and
when. They might well use Lamont -- and discard him, much as Major has
done.
There is a deep suspicion about what is regarded as his posturing.
When the Tory right look to Margaret Thatcher and Norman Tebbit to check
their feelings about Norman Lamont, they receive a wince and a sigh. If
things are really that desperate for Major, they feel, there is little
point in looking to a discredited ex-Chancellor for remedy.
The fight for the soul of the Tory Party is about to begin and, so
far, Norman Lamont is still at the back of the hall without a sufficient
following to give him a role. He can create havoc, but they can't throw
him out.
This man's resolve is now as remorseless as the winter storms of
Shetland
It is believed that Lamont's judgment has been taken over by his
bruised ego

William Russell assesses the form of candidates who, would, given the
chance, gallop into No 10
IF it were done when 'tis done, then 't were well
It were done quickly; if the assassination
Could trammel up the consequence, and catch
With his surcease success; that but this blow
Might be the be-all and the end-all here,
But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,
We'd jump the life to come.
WHO will play Archibald Bell the Cat? Who will succeed to the throne?
Those, one might well say, are the questions? When the Cat's back is
turned, who knows what the mice may get up to. Margaret Thatcher found
out in Paris, to her cost, John Major may discover it in Halifax.
Successors? Stalking horses? A leadership challenge, or a leadership
resignation? There is a choice. Stand and fight, or say enough is
enough. Everyone who knows John Major would say the second option is not
one he will take up, which leaves the question of who will bell the Cat
come November, when the Conservative leader automatically faces
re-election.
The question all would-be stalking horses have to answer is what is
their purpose in assuming the role? It is not enough to want to dispose
of a bad leader. They have to know who they wish to put in his place,
and have some certainty that they can manage to do it. Getting rid of
Major just to put a genuinely pro-European leader like Michael Heseltine
in the job would cutting off one's nose to spite one's face. And is
there any need for a stalking horse? Maybe this time round the real
candidates should enter the first ballot.
Assuming the stalking horse procedure is followed, however, the front
runner would be Norman Lamont, MP for Kingston Upon Thames, Chancellor
of the Exchequer from 1990-93.
He is bitter at his sacking by John Major, the wounded feelings he has
flaunted since, matching those of Ted Heath in their nakedness. He has
waged a skilled guerrilla war from the backbenches, even voting once
with the Opposition. A leading Euro-sceptic, the cleverest of them all
in fact, he has been putting the anti-Europe (some would say little
Englander) case powerfully in a series of cogently argued speeches.
He has an acid turn of phrase, which he is not slow to use, and his
protestations about not being the man who will do the dirty deed have
sounded as implausible as his claims about those green shoots of
recovery he used to perceive popping up all over the place when
Chancellor.
Lamont, who is profiled opposite, has little to lose politically by
standing, since his chances of securing another seat -- his present one
vanishes under boundary changes -- seem slim.
Lamont would be the most dangerous of the stalking horses because he
might just, with a fair wind, win the first time round, thus
wrong-footing the real aspirants should they chose to wait in the wings.
He believes his record as Chancellor should stand him in good stead.
But Lamont is not as popular as all that with his colleagues, being
your typical wee man with a big head.
Possible stalking horses pure and simple are:
* John Carlisle, MP for Luton North. A right winger, he has made no
secret of his disapproval of Major and was prepared to stand last year.
He has been in the Commons since 1979 without getting a job and is an
archetypal backbencher, a politician whose political prospects are
remaining on the back benches. He is not a prominent Commons figure,
having served on only one select committee -- Agriculture from 1985-88.
But he does belong to the ranks of the rent-a-quotes, which is why
people have heard of him. Pompous, not much fun, a candidate who would
vanish from sight once he had fulfilled his kamikaze purpose. Said
yesterday on the Today programme that high noon for the Prime Minister
was approaching in ''days now rather than weeks''.
* Tony Marlow, MP for Northampton North, a leading Euro-rebel and, to
put it politely, a prominent parliamentary eccentric who has ranted and
raved from the back benches since he was elected in 1979. He makes a lot
of noise, and, although the sound and fury often does not signify very
much, it can be highly entertaining.
He has been secretary of a series of Conservative back-bench
committees and is a member of the Select Committee on European
Legislation. Nobody could conceive of him as a potential party leader,
which might make him an ideal stalking horse.
The stalking horse having ensured a contest, and in the first round
having wounded the Prime Minister, there would then be a second ballot
when the real wannabes would emerge from the woodwork. They are actually
not all that deeply hidden in it. They would almost certainly be:
Michael Heseltine, President of the Board of Trade; Kenneth Clarke,
Chancellor of the Exchequer; Michael Portillo, Secretary of State for
Employment.
They could include: Gillian Shephard, Education Secretary, and, if the
stalking horse scenario does not operate, Lamont. A rank outsider is Ian
Lang, Secretary of State for Scotland.
Heseltine is the man who killed the last Cat, although he did not
inherit her job. He is dangerous, but he has many enemies. The Tory
right, which finds John Major insufficiently sceptic on Europe detest
him, and abhor his pro-European stance.
Lord Parkinson, a former party chairman, who appears to be emerging as
some kind of eminence gris in the crisis, warned yesterday that those
who would topple Major risked dragging the whole party into the abyss.
He pointed out the obvious truth -- Heseltine, the alternative to Major,
would not ''deliver'' to the John Carlisles of this world.
The Tory right will do its utmost to stop the Heseltine bandwagon from
gaining any momentum, but the Tory left will be equally intent on
stopping any Portillo push.
Ian Lang, MP for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale isthe rank outsider.
Highly regarded in the party and the Commons, but with a 2468 majority
would they be choosing a leader who would be around after the next
General Election? He is also a friend of the Prime Minister, loyal to a
fault, and so unlikely to be challenger if there is only one round --
although it is possible, should Major be fatally wounded by a stalking
horse, that he could be drafted since nobody has doubts about his
abilities.
* William Hill offer the following odds: Major to stay: 4 to 6; Major
to go by the time of the next General Election: 11 to 10; Heseltine: 7
to 4; Portillo: 2 to 1; Clarke: 11 to 4; Shephard: 10 to 1; Dorrell: 16
to 1; Lamont: 20 to 1; Lang: 50 to 1.

Stephen McGregor reports that the process to select a new commander is
not as easy for MPs as it used to be
FOR all the high-blown pomposity of ministerial office it is, at the
end of the day, what the back benchers, the front-line troops, the
infantry, feel that actually counts.
Once the men in grey suits begin to think that just possibly the man
at the top is not cutting the mustard, there are perceptible rumblings
in the ranks and we are into a leadership election.
There is no doubt that such an atmosphere is building at Westminster.
The Prime Minister may put on a brave face about what is happening but
he is deeply entrenched in his battle-bunker and now looks almost
certain to face some sort of leadership challenge in the autumn.
This is not as easy as it used to be, but with a number of senior back
benchers now openly saying that they believe a leadership challenge is
inevitable, the likelihood of backing from enough MPs to make it a
reality is increasing almost by the minute.
The difficulty they have was, not surprisingly, caused by That Bloody
Woman, perhaps better known as the Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven. The
party rules provide that there can always be an election within the
first four weeks of each parliamentary session -- in other words about
November -- but in Mrs Thatcher's case this was a formality.
Until, that was, a certain Sir Anthony Meyer came along in 1989 with
his token challenge which paved the way for the full-blown contest of
1990.
Men in suits again, but this time they decided that this sort of thing
really could not be allowed to happen again and something would have to
be done.
An internal review was set up in January 1991 after several MPs
complained that the rules at the time made it far too easy to challenge
the leader. A few names on a bit of paper -- basically a mover and
seconder -- were enough, and it was felt this was not right for a
serious party.
The review body was set up under the auspices of the back bench 1922
committee, and what happens now is that 10% of the parliamentary party
-- more than 30 MPs at the moment -- would have to notify the chairman
of the 1922 committee that they believed an election was necessary.
Once the election was underway, it remains the case that the names of
each candidate's proposer and seconder would be published, but the names
of the MPs who had said there should be an election in the first place
would remain confidential. The idea behind that is that it ''should
allow the threshold to be raised without increasing the divisive effect
within the party''.
Balloting would take place over one or two days in one of the rooms
off the committee corridor in Westminster. Under the Byzantine system
the successful candidate will not only have to secure a majority of
votes, but will have to be 15% ahead of the nearest rival to win on the
first ballot. Lady Thatcher, vowing to fight on and fight to win before
eventually accepting that the fight was over, failed to do this by only
two votes.
The 15% rule, however, remains, and while there are some technical
bits on third and fourth ballots should these prove necessary, the
experience is that by that stage a clear winning candidate has emerged
and it is obvious who the leader is going to be.
Toughening up the rules has, in a way, made the system more
democratic. The review body came out against extending the right to vote
in leadership elections beyond the parliamentary party, but it decided
on a very full and detailed consultation exercise and agreed that it
would be undemocratic to eliminate the possibility of an annual contest,
whether the party was in government or opposition.
In the period between the close of nominations and the date of the
first ballot, the constituency association in each area has to establish
the views of the membership on the candidates.
The chairman of the Association of Conservative Peers and the Chief
Whip in the House of Lords will make ''such arrangements as
appropriate'' to obtain the views of Tory peers, while the leader of the
Conservative Members of the European Parliament will be charged with
obtaining the view of the Tory MPs.
In Scotland, the area chairmen will consult at local level and report
back to the president of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist
Association, and MPs also will be made aware of the views of
Conservatives in areas not actually represented by a Conservative MP.
All of this consultation will be submitted to the executive of the
1922 committee before the first ballot, and it will be the
responsibility of the chairman and other members to ensure that all
these views are available to the MPs before they cast their votes.
By that time, however, it is likely that various factions will have
had fierce arguments and in-fighting, and the MPs will have decided
which candidate to favour with their vote. After that, it is up to the
poor soul who wins to try to unite a party suffering at the moment from
what appears to be an incurable case of self-destruct.

A WOMAN who slipped under a train as she ran alongside saying goodbye
to her boyfriend had to have her right leg amputated.
Last night, she was in a critical condition.
Charity worker Jennifer Dean, 33, was trapped under the train carriage
for more than an hour at London's Paddington Station while medics
treated her and firefighters struggled to jack up the train.
Miss Dean, a graduate who lives in Balham, South London, had been
running alongside the 11.40pm InterCity service to Cardiff on Thursday
night when she plunged under the wheels. According to unconfirmed
reports, she had been reaching out to kiss her boyfriend.
One of the doctors who rushed from nearby St Mary's Hospital to offer
first aid said she was conscious throughout the ordeal.
''Although she had been heavily sedated, she seemed to be aware that
her leg had been seriously injured,'' said Dr Adrian Fogarty.
Fire service assistant divisional officer Ian Saunders, who supervised
the operation to free Miss Dean, said she had remained remarkably calm.
''Her thigh was trapped between the track and the wheel,'' he said.
''Our task was to jack up the train so that the paramedics could get to
her.
''She was very quiet, very calm.
''She was conscious all the time, although she did start drifting away
towards the end because of the sedatives.''
Mr Saunders said the rescue operation had to be carried out extremely
carefully with the medical team stabilising Miss Dean first so she did
not haemorrhage when the wheel was finally lifted off her leg.
He said there was very little blood at the scene, probably because the
pressure of the wheel helped stem the flow.
Dr Fogarty said the right leg was all but severed and a team of
surgeons who operated at St Mary's were unable to save it and had to
amputate above the thigh.
Last night, Miss Dean was in a critical but stable condition on a life
support machine at the hospital.
Her parents John and Annette Dean, who travelled from their home in
York to be at her side, were said to be ''extremely distraught''.
Her boyfriend, who has not been named, was treated for shock but was
later discharged.
A British Transport Police spokesman said: ''It would appear that Miss
Dean was running alongside the train as it reached a curve in the track
towards the end of the platform where a gap opens up between the train
and the concrete.
''She must have failed to notice the gap. It's just a very unfortunate
accident.''

WHAT is Mr Major to do? As he struggles for his political life, with
the chances of a leadership challenge in the late autumn now probable
rather than possible, he displays in public at least a curiously
touching dignity. His instinct is to plod on, marching doggedly towards
the not-so-distant sound of gunfire. In private there may be more
twisting and dodging but he is not good at it, as was only too evident
in his confrontation with Euro-sceptics this week which resulted in him
being harangued by pipsqueak back benchers. He should have told them to
be quiet until they knew what they were talking about but he cannot do
this successfully, if at all. It is obvious that the situation in which
the Prime Minister finds himself this weekend has been approaching
stealthily for some time, but matters have worsened in the past seven
days.
Many Tory MPs, let us say those with majorities of 10,000 or under,
are seriously worried about their chances of surviving an election.
Nothing concentrates the minds of these back benchers more than the
prospect of unemployment. Most of them expected that the poll ratings of
the party would bottom-out at the local elections; nothing of the sort
has happened. The polls simply get worse and there is no consolation to
be found in the fact that Labour discounts most of them and is preparing
to fight a close election. Mrs Thatcher did not help. Fed by the oxygen
of publicity, she hyper-ventilated this week, reaching dizzying heights
of abuse of her successor and doing absolutely no good to the party they
both profess to love. The confrontation with the Euro-sceptics was the
last straw. The Prime Minister failed to deal with them, and in his
weakness became that much more vulnerable.
All of this is bad for Mr Major. It is not necessarily bad for the
Tory Party, and it might not be bad at all for the governance of the
country. The first thing to note is that there is no need to deny the
Tories a new leader. They have been rather miserly in this respect in
recent times (just two leaders in 20 years, compared with Labour's six)
and we should remember that our Governments are collective rather than
presidential. If they must have a new leader, so be it, for other
advantages would accrue. The present disarray in their internal affairs
is probably not important enough to have a direct and deleterious effect
on the national economy. Those who determine such things are relatively
unmoved by personalities, and appear to be increasingly confident that
they can do business, if not share much brotherly love, with a Labour
Government.
The danger to the nation of the debilitating struggle within the
Conservative Party rather comes from the damage done to the way in which
the British Government is perceived abroad. The world leaders at the G7
conference in Halifax know that they are discussing vital issues with a
Prime Minister who, if not exactly a lame duck, is waddling badly. Nor
will our preparations for the inter-governmental conference next year
proceed smoothly if nobody in Europe is confident of what stances we
will take, and whether we can stick to them.
Uncertainty could be removed by a change of leadership in the
Conservative Party, though it is difficult to see who could replace Mr
Major effectively. It would, in coldly pragmatic terms, be the perfect
moment for the Tories to change horses. A new leader would benefit from
the positive reaction to change (any change) and would have sufficient
time before the election to make an impact without necessarily enduring
the rancid effects of factionalism. Who could this be? Mr Heseltine who
would at least restore the party in the country and revive the loyal
workers who display acute disenchantment at the moment. It is not
possible, or wise, to discuss his, or anybody else's chances in detail
now. Yet one further point is important. Politics in Britain is in deep
disrepute. A contest between, say, Mr Heseltine and Mr Blair, both of
whom are politicians of style and substance, would revive matters
greatly. As for Mr Major, the best he can do is to hold his head high
and waddle onwards.

* FOUR into one WILL go, according to Mercedes Benz . . . and the
picture shows just how it's done.
It has developed a car which can be transformed from a saloon to an
estate or a pick-up or a cabriolet to suit the driver's mood, or his
purpose. The Merc Vario research model can be changed within minutes
from an estate car to a four-seater open-top tourer and even into a
pick-up truck.
The firm says each quick-change conversion is made possible because of
new panel structures using lightweight materials including carbon-fibre
and aluminium. Because the structures weigh no more than 110 pounds they
can be easily handled.
The superstructures are securely attached to the basic body by
electric magnets and a special hidden locking system. One option the
company is considering is renting the superstructure to owners so that
they can swap the different bodies as the seasons change. In Scotland,
however, that might mean renting by the hour.

RECENTLY returned from an interesting and delightful holiday in
Scotland, may I offer some observations?
First, it is not true, as one partisan acquaintance in Edinburgh
alleged, that you shouldn't bother going to Glasgow because there is
nothing there. With Edinburgh's tradition of ironic humour, perhaps what
he meant was that nothing in Glasgow is identified by signs, plaques,
captions, making it difficult for a visitor to find and confirm certain
places and things which indeed are there.
Try finding the People's Palace Museum from the stop on the
Discovering Glasgow tour. (''Just through the arches''); alas, most of
the exhibits were closed off anyway.
Nowhere in Glasgow, it seems, is a portrait of Adam Smith to be found.
Is that the Adam and the Smith of modern economics staring across the
room at James Watt midst the perfume exhibits in the University Visitor
Centre (''there used to be a sign next to the statue telling who it is,
but it fell off and was never replaced'')?
In the bowels of Glasgow Cathedral stands the shrine of St Mungo (by
inference from a purchased postcard), but only the financial contributor
of a kneeler is named at the site. Et al.
My visit to Scotland was prompted by interest in professional and
family ancestors. What a surprise to find their paths intersected at
Canongate Church in Edinburgh: Adam Smith's grave in the kirkyard and a
colourful inscription above the church entrance acknowledging the
financial contribution of a namesake of my great-great grandmother
Moodie, who came to America din 1833.
I was most surprised to note such little awareness and recognition,
both in Glasgow and Edinburgh, of the intellectual legacy of one of
their greatest citizens. No canvas of Smith hangs in the National
Portrait Gallery, only a small medallion displayed among others
honouring the artist while damning with faint praise this particular
subject: ''Smith is still honoured, particularly in Japan . . . '' Few
people seem to ken the name.
The cultural phenomenon which dominates the world today is surely the
ethos and institutions of the market society, warts and all, legitimated
by Adam Smith's 1776 book, The Wealth of Nations.
Professor Smith, the man who made the world safe for greed -- never
his intent, of course, as one knows from his classic Theory of Moral
Sentiments. (A Glaswegian acquaintance reminded me that today's vices
are but yesterday's virtues.)
How fitting at this dramatic stage of history (post-Soviet, with the
People's Republic of China roiling in flux) for Glasgow to establish a
Museum of Market Culture, not only honouring Adam Smith but tracing the
evolution of market ideology and practice during the 225 years since
publication of his celebrated blueprint for capitalism.
And, to give this gentle genius his due, pointing out that Smith
championed a market system as a more efficient socio-politico-economic
institution which, of course, would be guided by appropriate ''moral
sentiments''.
Little could he guess that under siege from technology and generations
of academic, business, and political popularisers, the market would
ascend to the status of secular monotheistic god, no longer ''only in
America'' but worldwide.
It seems a story worth telling to young and old alike, and where
better to tell the tale than from the Glasgow of Smith and Watt?

THIS boost for diabetes sufferers and one which offers them a
lifestyle not completely dictated by their condition, has won a medical
diagnostic company the Queen's Award for Technological Achievement.
Made by MediSense of Oxfordshire, it's a home-use blood-glucose
tester, which they say is the smallest and fastest, and frees diabetics
to test their blood levels anywhere. Many diabetics have to measure
glucose levels several times a day. The convenience and simplicity of
this tester makes it easier and more convenient for patients and
provides a more effective management of the condition.
The biosensors include an electronic meter and a disposable strip
which only needs one tiny drop of blood from a finger. The amount of
glucose in the blood is measured and displayed by the meter, which can
either be pen-sized or similar to a credit card, within 30 seconds. The
disposable strip is produced by a screen-printing process and contains
an enzyme which reacts in direct proportion to the amount of glucose in
the blood sample. An electical current is produced which is converted by
the meter into a meaningful reading.

JOHN MACLEOD in his article, Lost cause of a Scottish hero (June 13),
raises an interesting point when he asks the classic ''what if'' --
whether the Bonnie Prince would have won if he had staked everything on
an advance to London from Derby.
In some ways it would have been a repeat performance of Edinburgh and
Stirling, with the Jacobites seizing the town but failing dismally to
take any of the Government's fortified places.
They would then have found themselves outnumbered and surrounded in an
alien and overwhelmingly hostile capital, with powerful Government
forces of seasoned veterans closing in for the kill. Having ''taken''
London, furthermore, any later decision to escape from this untenable
position would have been seen as an admission of defeat.
The main thing the Jacobites learned on their march south was that
there was to be no English rising for the Stuart cause, just a few
hapless recruits. When that much had become obvious, the cause was truly
doomed, and even with a military mediocrity like Cumberland in command
the end result could never be in doubt, only the time and the place.

I WAS interested in the article, Britain helped cover up Katyn
massacre (June 9). In it reference is made to a document, D/CE2 of the
Special Operations Executive.
The last two paragraphs of your report refer to a letter which reveals
that, in July 1944, the Polish Secret Army had laid its hands on one of
Germany's V2 rockets. An operation was laid on to bring it back to
Britain but there are no further details in the file.
You might be interested to know that Henri Michel, in his History of
The Second World War, records that Hitler had set up a secret weapons
establishment in Poland, beyond the reach of Allied bombers.
The Polish Secret Army was vigilant. In January 1944, when new weapons
were being tried one fell on the banks of the River Bug. The Poles
reached it first and rolled it into the river, leaving secret marks so
that they could find it again. After the Germans searched
unsuccessfully, the Poles salvaged it by night.
Its sections, and the Polish engineer who had dismantled it, were
picked up by an RAF Dakota on January 24, 1944, and flown to England.
There it was reconstructed and analysed at the Royal Aircraft
Establishment at Farnborough.
It was the first such weapon to fall into British hands.

MAY I correct a minor inaccuracy in Liz Taylor's article in Weekender
concerning furniture by Thomson of Kilburn?
St Ninian's Church in Troon possessed one of the largest collections
in Scotland of furnishings by Thomson the Mouseman, eight pieces in all.
These include the main front door (with a mouse on either side); the
bishop's chair, a box for communion wafers; a small altar and prie-Dieu
with two matching chairs which together form the children's corner; and,
the most recent addition, a large reception desk and book cupboard
installed just last year as a memorial to a much loved former rector.
St Ninian's is usually open every day between 9am and 4pm and visitors
are very welcome to come in and see the Thomson furniture and some fine
stained glass windows, one of which includes the signs of the zodiac.

JOHN MAJOR faces a summer of political pitfalls before a possible
leadership challenge in November. The chances are that Tory fortunes
will get worse before they get better. That will leave Mr Major in a
more perilous position than ever.
One of his first hurdles is the Euro-summit in Cannes on June 26 and
27 which could well prompt a fresh bout of fighting between Tory
Europhobes and Europhiles.
The Commons is expected to rise for the long summer break around July
20, giving Mr Major fewer than a dozen Question Time sessions to stamp
his authority visibly on his unruly party.
After that, the Tories face the prospect of yet another humiliating
by-election defeat in Littleborough and Saddleworth, where polling is
expected to take place on July 27.
The party has not won a seat in a by-election since February 1989.
A Cabinet reshuffle, due around mid-July, may give him a short
breathing space by enabling him to rid himself of some of his most
unpopular ministers.
The Tory right will, however, be keeping a sharp eye on any moves, to
ensure their Cabinet representatives -- Michael Portillo, John Redwood,
Peter Lilley, and Michael Howard -- are maintained in key positions.
The thorny issue of Europe is back on his agenda in late September,
when Mr Major attends another European summit in Majorca.
The Tory conference in Blackpool between October 10 and 13 will
provide Mr Major with a platform to woo the Tory faithful.
But attention will focus on Norman Lamont -- widely tipped as the man
likely to challenge Mr Major -- who has the capacity to overshadow the
event with loaded speeches on the conference fringe.
After the Queen's Speech, probably on November 15, Mr Major's foes
have just 14 days to raise the 33 names they need for a challenge.
Noon on November 29 -- the deadline for a leadership challenge -- is
the crucial time when Mr Major will know if he faces the biggest
political fight of his life.
The Budget, expected on November 28, with the prospect of tax cuts,
could be Mr Major's last chance to rally support. But by then the
Chancellor may have been forced to raise interest rates by another 0.5%.

George Hume reports on America's lack of commitment to the United
Nations
AMERICAN President Bill Clinton's inability to pledge cash support for
a United Nations rapid reaction force in Bosnia should have come as no
surprise to the G7 leaders as they wrestle this weekend with the
apparently intractable problem of the former Yugoslavia and the shaky
future of the UN itself.
For even as President Clinton suffers frustration from Republican
hard-liners in his bid to commit American ground troops in Bosnia, a
list of debtors shows America at the top of the league of countries that
do not pay their way in the United Nations.
Of a total of $2.75 billion owed by member states, America is due the
organisation more than $1 billion -- over half of it money that should
have been paid over to fund special peace-keeping projects.
When the line was drawn in the middle of last month the United Nations
found that not a single cent had been paid by America so far this year
towards its Regular Budget contribution of $315,027,985. Including
contributions for prior years as yet unpaid, Bill Clinton's government
is due the United Nations $527m on the Regular Budget and $652m towards
peace keeping.
Although apparently agreeing with the other leaders of the world's
wealthiest industrial nations at their summit in Halifax, Nova Scotia,
that the European rapid-reaction force should be UN-funded, President
Clinton has made it clear that he cannot deliver America's share of the
cost.
Leading the block on President Clinton's ability to take America into
Bosnia -- either militarily or financially -- is the Speaker of the
House of Representatives, Newt Gingrich, who has called the United
Nations a failed institution with ''grotesque pretensions''. The United
States, he insists, should rethink its commitment to the world body.
''The United Nations is a totally incompetent instrument any place
that matters,'' Gingrich said recently on American television. ''When
you get to a serious problem with serious violence the United Nations is
literally incompetent and it kills people by its behaviour.''
Specifically on Bosnia he said that the United Nations and the
international community ''look pathetically helpless'' there. ''The
United Nations,'' he added, ''is a failed institution in its current
form. It has grotesque pretensions to be a world government.'' Of
President Clinton's policy toward American intervention on a world
scale, Mr Gingrich said: ''This administration's determined
multinationalism is a disaster.''
Of the 15 major contributing countries to the UN four, in addition to
America, are in arrears. The Russian Federation owes $599m of which
$558m is for the Peace-Keeping Budget. The Ukraine, which has so far
this year paid just $5m -- under a third -- of its Regular Budget
demand, and not a rouble towards peace keeping, owes the UN $216m . . .
$163m of it for peace-keeping arrears. Japan is in debt to the sum of
$118m and Brazil $28m.
The prompt payers include Britain, sixth-largest contributor to the
United Nations: commitment this year on the UN's Regular Budget of
$57,589,390 paid in full and with no debt from previous years but, as at
May 15, still with $28m outstanding on our peace-keeping account.
America's lack of commitment to the United Nations, and the
Republicans' determination to extract America from the UN and scupper
President Clinton's attempt to walk tall in international peace keeping,
could possibly result in the Halifax summit achieving a radically
reshaped UN: more likely, increasingly niggard funding for a largely
discredited organisation creaking under a mountain of debt.

Liz Taylor reports that auction rooms across the country are marking
the anniversary of Josiah Wedgewood
JOSIAH Wedgewood died 200 years ago and the anniversary of his death
is being marked by exhibitions and auctions across the country.
Wedgewood was a great entrepreneur who in his lifetime made English
pottery as covetable around the world as anything that came out of
China, and the techniques he developed helped found the modern
Staffordshire pottery industry.
He was born in 1730 to a family that was already active in the Burslem
potteries, but when he went to work he introduced wares of stunning
originality, many of them based on antique pots. Perhaps his best known
design was his unglazed blue Jasper ware decorated with raised designs
in white.
Success came to him quickly and in 1769 he opened a new works near
Hanley and named the site ''Etruria'', a tribute to his fascination with
classic styles. When he died in 1795, his name was famous and crowned
heads all over Europe clamoured to own pieces that bore his mark. An
example of the work he produced is the most prominent item in the
exhibition of Wedgewood currently running in the Victoria and Albert
Museum in London, (till September 17). It is called the Frog Service
because it was made to be used in Catherine's Chesmenski Palace near St
Petersburg which was built on what was once a frog marsh.
Each item in the creamware service is beautifully painted with a
different view of some picturesque place in Britain. The selection in
the museum has been lent by St Petersburg's Hermitage Museum and it has
never been out of Russia since Catherine received it.
Also on show is Wedgewood's copy of the famous Portland Vase which
took him years to perfect.
As well as the Victoria and Albert exhibition, another entitled
''Josiah Wedgewood, the Man'' is running at the Wedgewood Visitor Centre
in Barlaston, Stoke on Trent, from today till December 15. Another
entitled ''Josiah Wedgewood, the Man and His Mark'' also runs from today
till October 31 at the City Museum and Art Gallery, Hanley, Stoke on
Trent.
The salesrooms, too, have marked the great man's anniversary with
special sales -- on Thursday of this week Christie's in London had good
results with items like a black basalt teapot dating from 1770 and other
pieces which carried on the story of the Wedgewood production on from
the time of Josiah's death to the present day.
Yesterday, Bonhams held a Wedgewood sale which included a black basalt
Griffin candlestick which they estimated to make around #1500.
Another attraction running in London next week is the long established
and prestigious Grosvenor House Art and Antiques Fair which goes on in
the Great Room of Grosvenor House, Park Lane, until June 24.
More than 90 dealers from all over the world are taking part and
showing a dazzling dispaly of paintings, furniture, silver, jewellery,
textiles, ceramics, glass, watches and scientific instruments.
Among the highlights is the picture Armistice Night, Amiens which Sir
William Orpen painted to mark the end of the First World War. It is
being shown by the Pyms Gallery.
Among the furniture on Mallet's stand is a rare Queen Anne red lacquer
kneehole desk which once belonged to Sir Philip Sassoon and then to the
Marquess of Cholmondeley. Pelham Galleries are showing a harpsichord
what was formerly in the collection of Rudolph Nureyev.
Prominent among the porcelain are 24 Sevres dessert plates and two
bowls which Louis XV111 ordered in 1823 as a gift for Vicomte de
Chateaurbriand -- he who gave his name to the vast steaks which were
served up by his chef Montmireil.
The fair is open every weekday from 11am and 6pm. Admission costs #12
but that also entitles you to a handbook.
MARKET NEWS
NOW an item that will interest would-be treasure hunters. Spink and
Son, the coin dealers of King Street, St James, are offering for sale on
July 4 the largest hoard of Civil War coins ever discovered.
They were found by a metal detector enthusiast called William Caygill
in 1993 in a field at Middleham in North Yorkshire. He first found a pot
filled with silver coins and then subsequently, within three days,
another two pots full of coins. Altogether there were 5098 silver coins
-- halfcrowns, shillings and sixpences -- dating from the reigns of
Edward V1, Philip and Mary, Elizabeth 1, James 1 and Charles 1. The pots
had been buried around 1647.
What is interesting is that the find was declared to be Treasure Trove
and it was lucky for Mr Caygill that he found them in England and not in
Scotland.
By English law, Treasure Trove, the owner of which cannot be located,
is divided between the finder and the owner of the land, after the Crown
has taken what items it particularly wants from the hoard. In this case
5000 coins were left to go into Spink's where they are expected to sell
for around #70,000.
In Scotland however, everything in a Treasure Trove reverts to the
Crown, even if it is of little value. Because of the increased use of
metal detectors, the archaeological lobby in England is trying to have
the rules of Treasure Trove adapted to coincide with the law in
Scotland. There are pitfalls in the Scottish law however because, if
rigorously interpreted, it means that even items dumped on pavements
cannot be removed without the owner's permission.

HOUSING association chiefs in Scotland were urged yesterday to welcome
rather than oppose the Government's idea of allowing privately-funded
local housing companies to take over public-sector housing.
The controversial call came from Glasgow University housing expert
Professor Duncan Maclennan, who told The Herald earlier this month of
his support for what is claimed to be the Conservatives' latest ''big
idea'' on housing.
A housing White Paper due soon is expected to propose the housing
companies, but only for England and Wales. So far there are no plans to
introduce them in Scotland.
At the annual conference of the Scottish Federation of Housing
Associations in Perth, Professor Maclennan said the new companies would
promote variety and could involve ''partners'', including local
businesses.
If they did emerge in Scotland the federation should try to make sure
they had the virtues of housing associations.
''Rather than fearing local housing companies, at least those that
involve public representatives and tenants, the association movement
should expand its frontiers to embrace and welcome them,'' he said.
He told the conference it was likely that the type of companies
proposed for England would have only a fifth or less of their members
nominated by councils. This model would have little appeal for many
Scottish councils.
But the Labour Party in England saw local companies as potentially
major owners of not-for-profit housing. It favoured the idea of
companies with boards consisting of one-third councillors, one-third
tenants, and one-third others.

A MEETING to decide on the future of Scotland's largest fishing body
yesterday broke up in disarray.
The Scottish White Fish Producers' Association had been due to decide
whether to break away from its parent body, the Scottish Fishermen's
Federation, but ran into constitutional difficulties.
It follows the SFF's decision not to align itself with the anti-common
fisheries policy campaign, Save Britain's Fish, which the SWFPA supports
wholeheartedly.
Over the last few months, the SWFPA conducted a ballot among its 500
members. A split like the one envisaged would cause grave damage within
the increasingly fragile Scottish fishing industry.
But yesterday, after a heated four-hour meeting in Banff, delegates
emerged without having taken a decision and refusing to comment on the
proceedings.
TheSWFPA secretary Mr Roddy McColl said: ''At the end of the
discussion, the SWFPA board decided that there had to be an adjournment
to enable each branch to come back with the proper democratic views of
their members.
''There is a need for the board to ensure that they get the correct
view of every member as far as that is possible,'' he added.
Asked if ballots of certain branches had not been conducted properly,
Mr McColl replied: ''I cannot comment on that at all. The whole exercise
has not been satisfied.''
Now each branch must start the whole ballot process over again.

<HEADLINE>Scots farming couple lose marathon fight over Bonnybridge incinerator emissions. Rechem is cleared in cattle case</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<TEXT>
AFTER one of the longest and most expensive cases in English legal
history, Rechem International has finally fought off a Scottish dairy
farming couple's claims that their pedigree Ayrshire herd was ''wiped
out'' by toxic incinerator fumes.
In their David and Goliath battle, Andrew and Irene Graham alleged
toxic emissions from the incinerator at Bonnybridge, Stirlingshire,
between March 1982 and its closure in October 1984 caused catastrophic
illness in 300 of their pedigree Ayrshire cattle.
However, Mr Justice Forbes, at the end of a 323-page written judgment,
said: ''I am left in no doubt that Rechem is not responsible in any way
for the ill-health that afflicted the Grahams' dairy herd in the
1980s.''
The case had lasted 198 days in court spread over 14 months and ran up
a legal costs bill estimated at #3m -- half of which falls on the Legal
Aid Board.
Permission to have the case heard in England was obtained after the
Grahams ran into trouble obtaining legal aid in Scotland.
After the judge had handed down his judgment -- he said it would have
taken him 12 to 13 hours to read out -- Mr Graham, 61, said he was
''fairly disappointed''. He added: ''Twelve years of fighting has been
worth it to get it into court.''
His wife, Irene said: ''We are extremely disappointed. This is our
life. I definitely felt someone had to do something. We stood up for
what we believed in.''
Their solicitor, Mr Anton Bates, said the judgment would be studied in
detail to decide the prospects for a successful appeal and to see how it
affected other cases pending against Rechem.
He added that the Legal Aid Board, in agreeing to back the Grahams'
case, had recognised the public interest in the safe incineration of
toxic waste.
Rechem's parent company, Shanks &amp; McEwan, said: ''We have been very
confident right from the outset and, of course, we are delighted with
today's outcome.
''It confirms that there was no link between the operations of the
former Bonnybridge plant and Mr and Mrs Graham's farming and livestock
problems of over a decade ago.
''On a personal level, we can sympathise with the stresses the Grahams
have been under but earlier detailed studies and eminent scientific
evidence stated that there was no basis for their assertions that the
Bonnybridge plant had been responsible for illness among their cattle.
''Despite this, the claim, funded by legal aid, proceeded, culminating
in an extremely time consuming and costly trial. We are very satisfied
that, in the end, the Grahams' allegations and their claim for damages
have been proved to be unfounded.''
Mr Graham and his 44-year-old wife, based at Tambowie Farm, Milngavie,
near Glasgow, also grazed livestock at West Bankhead Farm, Denny, two
miles from Bonnybridge.
Suing Rechem for negligence and nuisance, they alleged that fall-out
from the incinerator containing toxins such as PCBs and dioxins was
ingested by their cows which developed illnesses including as eye
defects and died or had to be destroyed.
Rechem argued that the problems arose from poor husbandry. It alleged
that the Grahams ''wrought havoc with the health of their herd'' by
grossly overfeeding the cattle in an attempt to boost milk yields and
alleviate their debt crisis, resulting in ''fat cow syndrome''.
The company, which said it closed the plant for economic reasons,
insisted it took the greatest care to incinerate waste at very high
temperatures to destroy chemicals, and stringent measures were taken to
contain harmful effluent.
Mr Justice Forbes held that the incinerator did not emit toxins ''in
anything other than negligible quantities throughout its operational
life and certainly not in sufficient amounts to pose any kind of risk to
either animal or human health''.
The judge said he was satisfied that, on a broad view, the incinerator
was operated and managed by Rechem in a ''generally satisfactory
manner''.
He accepted Rechem's contention that the Grahams' herd was afflicted
by an outbreak of ''fat cow syndrome'', largely as a result of excessive
feeding of concentrate to lactating animals.
The main, if not exclusive, reason for the over-feeding was the desire
to boost milk production and increase income.
''There was also the need to ensure that the farm obtained a high milk
quota,'' he said.
The Grahams claimed other farmers in the district had also suffered
unusual problems.
However, the judge said the evidence demonstrated ''beyond any shadow
of a doubt'' that none of the neighbours suffered any significant or
unusual health problems in the period 1980 to 1984, let alone any
problems that could plausibly be attributed to chemical contamination.
The secretary of local pressure group Scottie -- the Society for the
Control of Toxic and Troublesome Emissions -- said that, despite losing,
the Grahams had done a great service to Scotland.
Dr John Wheeler, a science teacher at Grangemouth High School, said
that by bringing the case they had highlighted the disposal of hazardous
waste as an area for public vigilance.

EDINBURGH council yesterday launched the first campaign of its kind in
Scotland, to alert restaurants, hotels, and school kitchens to the
potential dangers for some customers of nut allergy.
Environmental health officers will be delivering posters and leaflets
to every caterer in the city to hammer home the message that, for a
small percentage of the population, consuming even a single small nut
can prove fatal.
Peanut allergies have already claimed six lives in Britain in the last
two years, and can cause a violent reaction in others.
The leaflets have been translated into Arabic, Chinese, Bengali, Urdu,
and Hindi to warn the capital's hundreds of restaurateurs of the dangers
for allergy sufferers, and stressing they should follow strict hygiene
rules to prevent tragedy striking.
Director of environmental health Richard Carson, said it was important
to make caterers aware of the risk to those suffering from the most
serious form of the allergy.
''Some people are highly sensitive to nuts or nut products, which can
cause them to suffer anaphylactic shock, a condition which can be fatal.
''We aim to alert all food premises to be aware of this risk by
clearly listing all ingredients in their products. We also demonstrate
that an indirect risk can also be caused by preparing or storing food in
containers or utensils that have previously held nuts or nut products.''
Even a single drop of a nut-based oil could contaminate food for
sufferers, said Mr Carson.
The campaign has been welcomed by Mrs Jennifer Mitchell, of Edinburgh,
whose 16-year-old son Edward, suffers from a nut allergy.
''This sort of information is vital and can save lives. I would
welcome anything which can help,'' she said.

Los Angeles, Friday
THE prosecution in the O J Simpson double murder trial sought to
control damage today after a dramatic demonstration backfired on them
when the football hero could not get his hands into a pair of
bloodstained gloves.
Those were the infamous gloves Simpson is alleged to have worn the
night his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman
were murdered.
One glove was found at the murder scene and the other at his mansion
two miles away.
When prosecutor Christopher Darden asked Simpson to put them on in
front of the jury yesterday, it was obvious they did not fit. Simpson
showed the panel how the glove fingers were empty because he could not
get his hands fully inside.
''This demonstration by ambush can and does frequently backfire,''
defence lawyer Johnnie Cochran commented to Judge Lance Ito out of the
presence of the jury today.
The prosecution recalled glove designer Richard Rubin in an attempt to
explain why the gloves did not fit. Rubin, formerly a vice president and
general manager of the Aris Isotoner glove company, said all leather
gloves would shrink when exposed to liquid.
Normal exposure would result in shrinkage of 2% to 5%, Rubin said, and
if the gloves were saturated there would be 15% shrinkage.
He added however that if gloves had only 3cl of blood on them when
they were found, as defence evidence suggests, they would not be
affected.
A previous witness testified yesterday that Nicole Simpson bought two
pairs of extra-large Isotoner gloves at Bloomingdale's department store
in New York in December, 1990, as a Christmas present for her
then-husband.
The prosecution contends that Simpson wore one pair when he stabbed
his ex-wife and Goldman to death outside Nicole Simpson's luxury
condominium on the night of June 12, 1994. Simpson has pleaded not
guilty to the murders.
DNA experts testified last month that blood on the gloves contained
the unique DNA of Simpson and the victims.
The defence says the glove found on the former football star's estate
was planted there by Detective Mark Fuhrman, who they have portrayed as
a white racist cop out to get Simpson.
Either Fuhrman or other detectives, the defence has said, put
Simpson's blood on the gloves from a sample he gave police.
Pleased defence lawyer Johnnie Cochran told reporters at a news
conference that it was ''a very important day for the defence''.
He noted the prosecution had claimed the left glove had slipped off
Simpson's hand during the attack outside Nicole Simpson's home. ''You
think anybody in America now believes those gloves just fell off?'' he
asked.
Outside the court, Darden told reporters he thought Simpson had
crooked his thumbs to make it more difficult to get the gloves on.
However Cochran, when asked if Simpson was feigning difficulty in
getting the gloves on, replied: ''I don't think you can act the size of
your hands.''--Reuter.

A DETECTIVE yesterday told how drugs police tracked the son of former
Rangers and Scotland footballer Sandy Jardine -- and said it had led to
a stake-out and raids on two houses.
Detective Constable Robert Cowper, 32, of the Scottish Crime Squad,
told the High Court in Edinburgh that two men had been under
suveillance.
One was Mr Steven Jardine and the other was Mr Kevin Peters.
DC Cowper said that he had been involved in a search of a top flat at
10 Dalgety Avenue, Edinburgh, after it was raided in February.
The detective said that in the flat, earlier described in court as
having been like ''a tropical nursery'' of cannabis plants, he found a
book titled The Marijuana Grower's Handbook. He alleged that sections of
the book had been highlighted.
He said that he had taken it to be a manual on how to propagate
cannabis on a large scale.
He said police had also found a catalogue featuring industrial
lighting such as fluorescent lamps and power units. They had also found
a large number of pots for plants, seed trays, and electrical equipment,
a ''hemp seed guide'' and dried branches of cannabis, he claimed.
He told the court that he had come across similar items before in the
production of cannabis.
Detective Constable Veronica Jackson, 30, of the Scottish Crime Squad
told the High Court that she had become involved on January 26 this year
in a drugs investigation into the production of ''skunk cannabis'',
centred on Mr Steven Jardine and Mr Peters.
She said that two people had been detained after police raided a top
flat at 10 Dalgety Avenue, Edinburgh.
She told the court that she had gone with other police officers to the
home address of Mr Steven Jardine at Orchardhead Road, Edinburgh, on the
same day, February 16 this year. Only Steven's father was at home.
She said that during a search of Steven's Jardine's bedroom, she had
found a piece of brown substance similar to cannabis resin.
The officer claimed she also had found two pieces of a dried plant
which looked like cannabis plants and two pieces of ''plant stock''.
She said she later went to the top flat at Dalgety Avenue where all
the windows were boarded up to keep out the light.
The detective spent over an hour in the witness box identifying
hundreds of items, including cannabis plants, electrical equipment and
kits for testing the acidity of soil, said to have been taken from the
flat at Dalgety Avenue.
She told the court she thought there had been an ''operation for
growing cannabis plants'' in the flat.
On trial are Steven Jardine, 22, of Orchardhead Road, Mr Peters, 24,
of Restalrig Road South, both Edinburgh and Mr Calum Slythe, 29,
described as a prisoner.
All three deny being concerned in the supply of cannabis and deny
possessing cannabis with intent to supply it at various addresses in
Edinburgh and Scotland. They also deny growing cannabis.
The trial before Lord Kirkwood continues.

* THRUST SCC, the world's first supersonic car, has zoomed onto the
information superhighway. Tech freaks can follow the development of the
new car from the workshop to its record-breaking attempt on screen via
an Internet Webserver designed by Digital. Later in the year, Internet
users will even be able to ship in the Thrust Cybermarket for official
merchandise like prints and posters. The Digital webserver, capable of
handling more than a million accesses every day, provides more than 200
photos and images, the history of the land speed record and high tech
specs. The sound barrier attempt will be seen -- and heard by sound-card
users -- live on the Internet. Richard Noble, holder of the world land
speed record and a driving force behind the Thrust SCC, said the UK
project had become a global one through Digital's server.

IN spite of yesterday's judgment, Rechem's waste disposal plant at
Pontypool, near Gwent in South Wales, is likely to remain the focus of
concern.
The Grahams' solicitor, Mr Anton Bates, acknowledged that the judgment
would have implications for a Welsh farmer making a claim against the
company. Mr Bates said he would be advising his Welsh client once he had
studied the judgment. He would also consider the implications for
children born in the area with eye defects.
The company's last surviving solid-waste high temperature incinerator
lies in Glenys Kinnock's Euro-constituency, yards from the River
Afon-Lwydd. Mrs Kinnock has already demanded a public inquiry.
In 1993 an independent study of grass, air, milk and egg samples from
near the Pontypool plant found above-average levels of dioxin and PCB
contamination after a long-running campaign by local householders.
Two years earlier, however, the Welsh Office commissioned an
environmental survey, carried out by East Anglia University, the results
of which were deemed ''reassuring''.
That report followed complaints by campaigners over a series of
incidents at the plant, including an explosion in 1990.

AID worker Dennis Rutovitz was making preparations to return to
war-torn former Yugoslavia when he found out about his MBE.
Mr Rutovitz, 66, who founded Edinburgh Direct Aid three years ago,
returns to Bosnia later this month to deliver supplies. It will be the
latest trip to the strife-torn land for Mr Rutovitz, who was shot in the
chest on his last visit
He learned of his honour as he continued to scour the country for
items to take to Bosnia. His latest priority is a much-needed industrial
washing machine for a centre for 300 handicapped children near Sarajevo
which has no washing facilities.
So far his organisation has taken 23 convoys to Bosnia.
Tragedy hit his group two years ago when EDA volunteer Christine
Witcutt was killed by a sniper's bullet on the road out of Sarajevo.
Mr Rutovitz said: ''This is not an honour for me but for Edinburgh
Direct Aid. We continue to uphold the ideals which Christine Witcutt so
tragically made her own.''

THE bitter battle to decide who will lead the Transport and General
Workers' Union, traditionally the largest and most influential Labour
Party affiliate, ended yesterday.
It will be next Friday, however, before incumbent general secretary Mr
Bill Morris hears whether he has beaten off the firm challenge of
national officer Mr Jack Dromey and the lesser threat from 43-year-old
Kent tractor driver Mr Norman Davidson.
Jamaican-born Mr Morris, 56, who four years ago became Britain's first
black union leader, called a snap election a year before his term was
due to expire.
Four years ago he had the firm support of the left but he has since
seldom seen eye to eye with them.
When ''moderniser'' Mr Dromey threw his hat into the ring most of the
TGWU left reluctantly backed Mr Morris, whom they perceived as the
lesser of two evils.

Los Angeles, Friday
POP superstar Michael Jackson apologised today for using song lyrics
in his latest album that Jewish groups said could promote anti-Semitism.
He agreed to include an explanation of the offending words in future
copies of the collection.
The singer backed down after criticism of the song ''They Don't Care
About Us'' from both the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith and the
Simon Wiesenthal Centre.
In it, Jackson sings: Jew me, sue me
Everybody do me
Kick me, kike me
Don't you
black or white me.
He at first said the song from the album HIStory was supposed to draw
attention to the pain of prejudice and hate, and to social and political
problems.
However the groups feared young people would hear what they felt was
offensive language and not understand the claimed nuances.
Jackson said today: ''I very much regret and apologise from the bottom
of my heart if I have hurt anyone's feelings in conveying my own.''
Meanwhile Oscar-winning director Steven Spielberg issued a statement
saying that his sleeve notes for the album were by no means an
endorsement of its songs.--Reuter.

Paris, Friday
FRENCH scientists today condemned President Jacques Chirac's decision
to resume nuclear testing and said they were planning to leave their
laboratories in Paris for a protest on July 1.
The National Union of Scientific Researchers (SNCS) said the planned
eight underground nuclear blasts in the South Pacific were unnecessary
from a scientific point of view and would undermine world moves towards
disarmament after the Cold War.
''The SNCS condemns without reservation the decision of President
Chirac to resume nuclear tests in the Pacific,'' the scientists said of
Tuesday's announcement, which triggered outrage around the globe.
The SNCS challenged Chirac's assertion that competent civil and
military experts were ''unanimous'' in saying France had to carry out
the final tests at the Mururoa site to ensure the safety of its nuclear
arsenal.
''By acting in this way, he makes the policies of France subservient
to the narrow interests of nuclear weapons technicians and the
military-industrial lobby,'' it said.
Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans warned that the decision to
resume testing risked French international credibility and damaged
prospects for non-proliferation control.
''The decision involves a really quite fundamental breach of faith
with all those countries who worked so hard to secure the indefinite
extension of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) just a few weeks
ago,'' he told a news conference in Tokyo.
Indeed India said today that the French move justified New Delhi's
stand in refusing to sign the NPT, under which it would have to open all
its nuclear facilities to international monitoring.
After two days of meetings with Japanese politicians, Evans was to
depart today for Paris as the head of a delegation of the 15 nations of
the South Pacific Forum. New Zealand Disarmament Minister Doug Graham
was also joining the protest mission.
Japanese Science Minister Makiko Tanaka said France should detonate
its nuclear weapons in suburban Paris rather than in the South Pacific.
Hundreds of anti-nuclear campaigners, including atomic bomb survivors,
staged a sit-in near the Hiroshima memorial to condemn the French
move.--Reuter.
Forum members on Wednesday made their own individual protests to the
French, with New Zealand suspending military ties with France and
Australia freezing defence links.

A GAMBLER who lost money at a seaside casino later stole a 29-tonne
lorry then demolished a set of traffic lights and smashed into 24 parked
cars.
David Haughton, 30, caused thousands of pounds' worth of damage after
leaving a trail of destruction through the car park at Blackpool's
Castle Casino.
When driving the lorry from the car park, Haughton also demolished a
10ft section of wall.
He flattened the traffic lights as he drove in to the car park after
taking the lorry.
Haughton, from Fleetwood, who is a lorry driver, admitted criminal
damage, aggravated vehicle taking, and driving with more than the legal
limit of alcohol in his blood and without insurance.
Police found him to be three times over the drink-drive limit at the
time of the incident on December 11 last year.
Preston Crown Court heard that Haughton had gambled away #800 over the
previous two nights at the casino and had lost #7000 over the previous
12 months.
After leaving the casino, he had gone to his employer's haulage firm
in Fleetwood and driven off in the Mercedes lorry after drinking a
bottle of wine.
Miss Samantha Birtles, prosecuting, said some of the cars were
slightly damaged and others totally written-off. The damage to 14 of the
vehicles amounted to #23,000 and #4500 to the lorry.
Mr Stephen Rothwell, defending, said Haughton -- who had now joined
Gamblers Anonymous -- had checked the cars to make sure no-one was in
them. He described the incident as a cry for help.
Haughton was jailed for 18 months and banned from driving for a year.

TERRIBLE scenes were described by Mr Andrew Graham and his wife Irene
at their former Bonnybridge farm during the two-year High Court hearing.
In the early 1980s, they said, their 296-strong herd of Ayrshire
pedigree cattle had been reduced to crippled specimens, forced to crawl
on their knees with their tongues hanging out before finally being
humanely destroyed.
As the couple's 12-year battle to blame emissions from the now-closed
Rechem waste disposal plant ended yesterday, the death of their cattle
was being attributed to fat cow syndrome -- a condition said to be
caused by overfeeding to boost milk yields.
Rechem International, which in the past had denied links between its
Bonnybridge plant and eye deformities in three local children, was again
vindicated.
From the brief statements the Grahams made outside the London court,
where one of the longest and most expensive cases in English legal
history had been played out, it was clear that the 323-page judgment was
a bitter blow and one which, they said, could spell the end of their
farming business.
The Grahams now run Tambowie Farm at Milngavie, on the outskirts of
Glasgow.
The court case came over a decade after the couple first claimed to
have observed the effects of highly toxic dioxins allegedly present in
emissions from the plant.
Over 80 witnesses were called and legal history was made with the use
of a video link between Grangemouth and the High Court in London after
the Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, ruled that it was
constitutionally impossible for an English court to sit in Scotland to
hear evidence.
Mrs Graham's family had farmed land on West Bankhead Farm at
Bonnybridge in Stirlingshire for 60 years. During the winter of 1978-79,
four years after the opening of the Rechem plant at Roughmute, Mrs
Graham's father fell ill and, in the run up to taking over the farm, she
volunteered to help feed the cows.
Mrs Graham recalled going into the byre and being shocked at the state
of the beasts, whose bones, she said, were sticking through their skins.
From that time onwards, she said, she began to note a catalogue of
alarming phenomena.
She said that by June 1983 cows were stumbling in the calving shed
unable to stand up and calves were born dead with blue mouths and red
teeth. Some were born a dirty orange colour, others greeny black, and
one with one eye.
In the fields, cows shed clumps of hair, aged rapidly, and suffered
from arthritic symptoms. Finally, the Grahams claimed, the cattle were
unable to move properly and had to crawl about.
They also claimed that people coming into contact with the herd
complained of streaming eyes, burning throats, and the overpowering
smell of chemicals.
A German Greenpeace activist, Ms Dagny Radek, took away samples for
analysis and found dioxins in the soil. Another researcher found dioxins
in the milk, halting the farm's production.
Rechem's defence lawyer countered this description of events with the
suggestion that the milk side of the farm was losing money long before
anyone imagined a connection with Rechem and cited a Glasgow University
veterinary school report advancing the fat cow syndrome theory.
When the Grahams' cattle were destroyed in 1984 and the Rechem plant
closed, the couple decided to sue for compensation. Having failed to get
legal aid in Scotland, the couple took their case to the English courts
where they won the right to legal aid.
Throughout the early 1980s, local opinion over the Grahams' claims
remained divided. Some people described how thick plumes of smoke rising
from the plant had coated the area with an oily deposit. Others said
plant and bird life vanished from the vicinity of the Rechem plant,
backing the Grahams' claims about dying crows and the absence of flies
and worms on the land.
A golfer from the Bonnybridge Golf Club, Mr James Keilt, claimed
emissions from the plant had blistered golfers' mouths and made their
eyes water.
Three years after the plant closed, suspicions were still being voiced
about the death of around 60 cattle on another farm near Kilsyth amid
claims that poisons from the Rechem plant had found their way into the
Carron Reservoir.
However, two neighbouring farmers, Mr William Robertson, of Middle
Bankhead Farm, and Mr Alexander Stevenson, said the plant had not
affected their farms and animals.
But since the 1970s, when Rechem convinced local councils that
high-temperature incineration was an ingenious method of transforming
poisonous chemicals into carbon dioxide and water, it has been dogged by
claims and counter claims.
By the 1980s, scientists were writing reports about the discovery of
dioxins in smoke particles and waste ash from incinerators. Communities
in the Bonnybridge area and around another Rechem plant in Pontypool,
South Wales, expressed fears about eye deformities in new born children.
In Scotland, links between illness and the plant were dismissed by one
leading scientist in a 1986 report while Department of Agriculture and
Fisheries assured residents that all animal problems in the area could
be attributed to disease.
Environmental groups and many local people condemned the report as a
''whitewash''.

Jacob More created landscapes for the cream of Europe, reports James
Holloway
AT the time of his death in 1793, Jacob More was considered one of the
greatest landscape painters in Europe and his work was to be found in
many of the most distinguished collections. Goethe visited him and
admired the excellence and originality of his paintings; Canova
marvelled at the amazing beauty of his landscapes.
He was born in 1740, the son of an Edinburgh merchant, and he served
his apprenticeship as a painter in the city.
In 1767, More painted a set to scenery for the New Theatre which was
so well received that he is said to have determined to make landscape
painting his sole career. More than any of his other paintings it was
his views of the Falls of Clyde -- Bonnington, Corehouse and Stonebyres
Linn -- that established Jacob More as one of Britain's leading
landscape artists. He painted at least two sets of the Falls of Clyde,
one of which was brought to London where it so impressed the President
of the Royal Academy, Sir Joshua Reynolds, that he bought a view of
Corehouse Linn for himself.
Buoyed up with this success, Jacob More left Britain in 1771 for Rome.
He sent nothing back to the London exhibitions for four years but then
he dispatched a group of pictures, the subjects of which were views in
the vicinity of Rome. A Storm with a view of the Lake of Albani, A Calm
with a bridge on the road to Rivoli, A Sunset with a distant view of
Rome sound as if they were deliberately chosen to show off his range;
storm scenes contrasted with peaceful landscapes.
They were popular and by 1782 More was successful enough to be able to
charge 100 guineas for his largest paintings, which were 5'2'' high and
6'9'' wide. His middle size paintings cost 60 guineas and the smaller
size 30 guineas. This was the same price Gainsborough charged in London
for his portraits and about double, size for size, as their Roman
contemporary Pompeo Batoni charged for his portraits.
An exceptionally important commission was the Landscape with the
metamorphosis of Daphne painted between 1783 and 1785 for the Villa
Borghese. The room which More decorated held Bernini's great sculpture
of Apollo and Daphne. More's painting was part of an extensive scheme of
redecoration in the most up to date neo-classical taste.
Gavin Hamilton painted in the room adjoining More's and in 1793 the
Scots Magazine described their work with undisguised patriotic approval:
''The Prince of Borghese, as if with a view to do honour to Scottish
artists, had the adjoining apartment painted by Jacob More, who excels
as much in landscape as Hamilton in historical paintings. These
apartments are conceived to exhibit the finest specimens of modern art
now in Italy.''
More also undertook another ambitious project for the Borghese family,
landscaping part of the extensive grounds of their Roman villa to create
an English garden. He was commissioned by the Royal family in London to
paint a panorama of Rome for Buckingham Palace.
Another patron was the Pope. But most important of all for Jacob More
was the patronage of Frederick Hervey, fourth Earl of Bristol and Bishop
of Derry. From 1778, when it is recorded that they first met, until
More's death in 1793 the artist supplied the Earl Bishop with at least
14 paintings.
The two contrasted landscapes Morning and Evening painted in 1789 for
the Earl of Breadalbane, now in Glasgow Museum and Art Gallery, show the
artist at his finest, formal, controlled and spacious. When Sir Joshua
Reynolds commented that More was the finest painter of air since Claude
Lorraine, he was describing the purity and clarity of light that More
could depict and which helped make him Europe's greatest neo-classical
landscape painter.

Gallery.

welcomed with relief in Hong Kong as a sign of a thaw in Sino-British
relations after last week's long-awaited agreement on a Court of Final
Appeal for the handover back to Chinese rule in 1997.

TOKYO: Fears that life could imitate art prompted a Japanese film
company to scrap plans to make a thriller movie about a plot to
assassinate the manager of the Tokyo Giants, Japan's favourite baseball
team. The Shigeo Nagashima Assassination Case was scrapped after angry
Giants fans flooded producers with letters warning that it could incite
someone to kill their hero.

There are still Greek Islands where disco music does not drown out the
cicada. Jill Crawshaw found peace on two of them
SYMI
IT'S a simple enough equation; find an unspoilt Greek island, add a
couple of modest hotels, and holidaymakers will rave about its unspoilt
charm. But the tourist authorities build an airport for easy access by
charter flights from Glasgow, Gatwick, Geneva, and Germany -- and quick
as a flash a coastal fringe of concrete emerges, closely followed by
darkened discos, and restaurants with flambe dinners.
That's the end of our unspoilt island!
Nature seems to have protected Symi; on the barren, rugged mountains
which sweep right down to the sea, there's scarcely room for a road, let
alone a runway, and the only way to get there is by boat, on the daily
two-and-a-half-hour crossing from the sleek harbour at Rhodes.
In our case, the wrong boat.
A career in travel has still not unravelled the eccentricities of the
Greek ferry system -- which is why my two young sons, a grumbling
husband, and I were decanted at the wrong end of the island.
It sure was unspoilt, I mused, having little more than a monastery,
the inside an ornate clutter of marvellous Byzantine icons, candles,
censers, and silver, tended by a pigtailed cassocked priest . . . but
perhaps a little daunting as a holiday spot for my two active
youngsters?
Later, as we found out the state of roads on Symi, we were glad to
have visited the Great Monastery of St Michael at Panoramitis, albeit by
accident.
We had no doubt at all that we had arrived at the right place when a
later boat we managed to pick up nosed into one of those stunningly
picturesque harbours that can perhaps only be found in Greece. Up on the
hill, a row of windmills stood sentry above the old huddled capital of
Chora, its houses almost tumbling down into the harbour at Yialos, their
fine balustrades and pediments reminders that Symi was once a wealthy
island of boatbuilders and sponge divers, with a population of 30,000,
larger than even that of Rhodes, despite its diminutive 35 square miles.
Now only about 3000 souls live on the island, and most of them seem to
gather several times a day on the quayside to meet the ferries and the
sprinkling of visitors who navigate the jumbled quayside cafes and
chaos, and set off on foot for the studios, private apartments, and
couple of tiny hotels that are the sum total of tourist accommodation.
I can think of many holidaymakers for whom Symi, and indeed many of
the ''unspoilt'' Greek islands, would be torture -- they are not for the
youngest bucket-and-spade brigade, since there is little sand; the jet
set looking for discos and sophistication would scream with frustration.
But we've discovered after several visits that it suits us. We quickly
settle into a simple routine . . . the days starting with the usual dawn
reveille of mules, cocks crowing, dogs barking, and the chugging of
fishing boats returning with their meagre catches.
For our early morning dip we walk down 20 steps and dive into the
clear water in front of the Hotel Aliki, an old captain's mansion, the
ideal Greek island hotel, with ceiling fans, an old staircase heavy with
wood and character.
Generally we make for Pedi, the only ''resort'' with a beach; the
local bus provides the adventure, the narrow road up to Chora and down
the other side to Pedi marked as a motorway on the map, and the driver
believing the classification, hurtling round bends, scraping the white
walls of Chora's impossibly narrow streets, and terrorising the mules
laden with grapes.
Pedi has a lazy, ramshackle charm, with a pension, a pier, a few
taverna -- and not much else. For the price of a gritty coffee we lay
claim to a table and parasol in ''our'' taverna, and from there, dangle
our feet in the water and pass the day doing nothing much. Lawrence
Durrell paperbacks bleach in the sun, the boys snorkel off the bay, the
taverna owner's brother creates a brief ripple of excitement when he
rows in with a fair-sized squid which merits a glass of retsina or two.
Every day our waiter presented us with the same menu with ''shrims'',
''gropes'', and ''squits,'' bearing no resemblance to the fish we
inspected in the kitchen. If we worked at it, we paid as much as #3 a
head establishing our squatting rights for the entire afternoon.
Back in Yialos, the pace did actually quicken in the early afternoon,
though the major event was selecting the eating place for the evening.
There seemed to be more restaurants than people, yet somehow they all
get customers. My sons became adept at choosing from moussaka, fish
stew, ''big fish'' or ''little fish,'' all rather bony and grilled by
grandfather on an oil-drum barbecue. Whatever we chose, the bill always
came to #3 a head.
One day we hired our own caique for #15, and the boatman took us to a
secret bay with white sand and crystal-clear water. On another, I left
the family behind, and set off on the Walk of the Chapels, from Yialos
past the builders' yard, whose ancestors had built ships for the sacking
of Troy -- Symiot boatbuilding prowess is mentioned in Homer.
Later, the Knights of St John allowed Symians to do more or less as
they pleased, as long as they provided them with fast, well-built ships,
and Symi produced 500 ships a year until the age of steam.
There are 63 churches on Symi, one for every 50 head of population,
often in the most unlikely and inaccessible places -- the first on my
route was on an empty beach, apart from a couple of sponge boats pulled
up on shore. Another was hidden in a shady churchyard of pines. I only
reached a couple of simple, dazzling white shrines, tucked away in rocks
overhanging the sea, by scrambling up a hillside littered with different
herbs that are dried and sold along with sponges and honey in the
souvenir shops in Yialos.
The last chapel defeated me -- perched inaccessibly on a high
pinnacle. Across the water rose the craggy silhouettes of Turkey's
mountains -- only four miles away. I could almost have nipped across for
a quick raki.
Back in the harbour, the ferry had come in from Athens, and the
tourists looked hollow-eyed at the thought of the overnight journey, as
well they might. These long-distance ferries are rarely fun.
Still, I thought selfishly, I was glad there was no airport.
An Isle of revelations
PATMOS
TOURISM is no stranger to Patmos; foreign visitors -- pashas, popes,
pilgrims, and privateers -- have been arriving on the island for
centuries, often without invitaton, since 95 AD, when the exiled St John
the Divine had his vision here and wrote the Book of Revelations.
But nothing happens very fast, and it took a thousand years more to
build the great monastery founded in his name, since when it has been
sacked, pillaged, annexed, and occupied by the Venetians, Italians, and
Germans.
Shimmering in the sky like a great fortress in the heavens, the great
monastery dominates the island and the sea around it, yet it is
curiously intimate within its small courtyards and cells where the monks
still live and worship. They've accumulated some rich treasures over the
centuries, a library of 300 rare manuscripts including a fifth-century
version of St Mark's Gospel, and a manuscript of Aristophanes' comedies,
plus a great collection of icons and jewellery, with a 62-diamond mitre
from Istanbul.
Modern-day tourism has added its own contributions -- and problems.
The famous roof from which so many travellers have written or
experienced arguably the best view of the Mediterranean has had to be
closed off, after it became a favourite haunt for nude or topless
sunbathing, and the new road is filled with diesel fumes from the
coaches that replaced donkeys by way of progress.
Those with time to spare take the old steeper cobbled Roman road that
winds among the pines and eucalyptus, stop off at the cave where St John
received the Revelations from God through three cracks in the ceiling
(which many day visitors miss in the rush to the Monastery), and then
climb up to Chora, the old capital.
In the shadow of the monastery, the maze of streets are now crumbling
and overgrown, but as in Symi, the elaborate doors, arches, and crests
show that Patmos was home port for one of the wealthiest fleets in the
Aegean.
Visitors who have realised that there is much more to Patmos even than
its Monastery and history, fascinating though they are, usually stay in
the port of Skala in one of the small hotels on the waterfront. As
befits a port, the rhythm of Skala is dictated by the arrival and
departure of the boats -- a flurry in the morning where the caiques are
due to leave for trips to nearby islets, the cafes overflowing, and it
seems impossible that everyone will get into the right boat, but
magically they do.
The souvenir shops wait for the cruise ships to hang out their worry
beads and icons, though the shops that sells nothing but coloured
wellies opens early if there's as much as a puff of cloud in the sky.
You learn to recognise the regular holidaymakers who know the timetables
and make sure they're at their taverna tables before the big ferry docks
in the afternoons and evenings. You also see them setting off each
morning for the beaches -- there are stony ones near the port, but the
real treasures can only be reached by boat or on foot across the tiny
seven-by-three-mile island.
It was on such a walk that I discovered one of the best beaches in the
Aegean, though it took me most of the morning to get there. I was
tempted to stay for the day in Grikou, the first village I stumbled
across en route, which sits in a perfect landlocked little bay, its
white cube houses reflected in the most translucent water I'd ever seen.
My track petered out somewhere in the hills, leaving me only with the
scent of thyme and rosemary, and a flock of baby goats and sheep
rambling among the figs and pomegranates.
But the gods were protecting me after all, in the form of an old man
who gesticulated that by following the goat droppings, scrambling over a
drystone wall and climbing a steep hillside, I would at least reach
somewhere for lunch. And so I did.
There was the beach at Psili Amos, long, sandy, and uncrowded. And
there was a taverna under the tamarisk trees -- alas they had no
calamares, but they did have meat balls, which in that setting didn't
seem quite as gristly as usual, and the tomatoes tasted like sunshine,
the wine ambrosial.
And somewhere all there waiting for me were a host of little dots on
the horizon, Agathorissi and Arki, Lipsi and Leros, plus 1000 or so
others out there ready to be explored. It was a truly wonderful thought!

Days Like This, Van Morrison (Polydor)
* ANOTHER easy-oasy instalment of horn-driven Celtic soulfulness.
There's nothing on this album that seasoned Van fans won't have heard
before, but it's always nice to hear The Man slur and growl his way
through it again, ain't it? Nice is probably the most apt word for this
LP, in fact. Nice, but far from compelling.
Macro Dub Infection Volume 1, various artists (Virgin)
* AN intriguing if far-from-propellant two-CD, 23-track set of
exploratory echoes and bass-heavy reverberations. Among the better tunes
receiving a tweaking are ones by the awesome Earthling, On-U Sounds'
melodic high-steppers Two Badcard, and the dubtastic Mad Professor. In
contrast, hear Ambient Pumpkin and know that there is less to Tricky
than meets the ear and eye.
Between The Wars, Al Stewart (EMI)
* NOT to be confused with the ghastly Rod or the stentorian Andy, Al
Stewart is a jaunty cross between folk and swing, as well as Django
Rheinhart and Cole Porter. As such, he should be hotly clasped to every
sentient bosom. Al is also an enthusiastic and wise social historian, as
this evocative album shows in providing a flavour of the years 1918-39.
Ever wanted to fly with Lindbergh or wondered if any single generation
had a monopoly on self-delusion? Ever sought confirmation of how little
goes on in the heads of politicians of all eras? If you have, or even if
you haven't, this is the LP for you. Now scoot off in order to purchase
your tickets to see Al Stewart on June 29 when he makes an all-too-rare
visit to Glasgow's Royal Concert Hall. An uplifting and dust-free
history lesson is guaranteed.
Head First, Vertical Hold (A&amp;M)
* A PLEASANT example of the melting creaminess of the new R&amp;B -- not
so much Memphis Slim as Barry Love-Mountain White. Synthesised
bass-lines stutter and ooze; the tempo is set at a confident yet relaxed
lope; swoonsome and jazz-inflected female voices adopt a courtly
Anglophile tone as they assert their love-rights.
Infernal Love, Therapy? (A&amp;M)
* THE earnest guitar-crunching trio squeeze out an overly-polite
nu-metal racket, journeying through Misery, Epilepsy, and -- ahem --
Bowels Of Love, where they sing about having ''Eros maggots'' and
''Satan's spit'' poured down their throats. Yeccch. Fittingly, this
album demonstrates the malodorous waste-product which emerges when
half-digested pabulum is processed through the bowels of the rockbiz.
DAVID BELCHER
A La Gloire de Dieu (Collins Classics)
* IMPORTANT new series here. Harry Christophers's immaculate
cult-choir, The Sixteen, has linked up with the BBC Philharmonic to
undertake a series of recordings of twentieth-century masterpieces for
chorus and orchestra, alongside relevant pieces for either choir or
orchestra alone: rich pickings. The first disc is a cracker, with a
superbly stylish -- austere and dignified -- performance of Stravinsky's
Symphony of Psalms, and polished accounts of Tippett's Negro Spirituals
(from A Child of Our Time) and Poulenc's Sept Repons de Tenebres. The
orchestral work -- atmospherically played by the BBC Phil under Harry
Christophers -- is Charles Ives's classic, The Unanswered Question.
Witness, Volume One (Collins Classics)
* ONE for specialist tastes, methinks. This is the first of a four-CD
survey of Afro-American music devised by Philip Brunelle, founder and
director of the Plymouth Music Series of Minnesota, whose chorus
features on this CD. The series will range from spirituals and gospel
songs (the subject of Volume One) to contemporary black American music.
Personally, I find the spiritual singing here rather academic and
four-square, lacking the raw edge I'd have expected from such emotional
music. And the disc is an odd mix, containing also jazz-blues versions
of some songs, performed by a group called the Moore by Four Vocal Jazz
Ensemble.
MICHAEL TUMELTY
John McCusker, John McCusker (Temple)
* Five years globe-trekking with the Battlefield Band has turned
McCusker, at 22, into a fiddler of considerable maturity. His playing
has a delightful lilt on waltzes and slow airs and a steely
percussiveness on reels. He can also turn out a good tune and while
there's admirable help from fellow Batties, plus and concertinist Simon
Thoumire, it's McCusker's interplay with guitarist Ian Carr that really
grabs the attention. More, please.
Rule of Thumb, Jim Mullen (EFZ)
* It doesn't say so on the sleeve but the impression gained here is of
a thoroughly prepared quartet rolling up to the studio, setting up, and
running through its repertoire in a oner. It's intimate, compact, and
direct electric jazz. The rhythm section changes gears effortlessly and
saxophonist Dave O'Higgins and guitarist Mullen, particularly, solo with
that classic combination of freshness and logic.

THE principal keeper at the Mull of Kintyre lighthouse, Mr Hector
Lamont who has maintained a long family tradition of maritime service,
becomes an MBE.
Mr Lamont, 59, who is due to retire next March when his lighthouse is
automated, was first on the scene of last June's Chinook helicopter
crash in which 29 people died on a hill nearby.
He and his wife were returning by Land-Rover to the lighthouse when
they heard the Chinook pass overhead and crash in thick fog. They raised
the alarm and rushed to see if they could help.
Mr Lamont is the son and grandson of a principal lightkeeper, and the
youngest of three brothers, all principal lightkeepers, while his wife,
Esther, almost comes from a lightkeeping family.
Mr Lamont said: ''It's an honour for me to receive the award from Her
Majesty on behalf of all lighthouse keepers, whose jobs will disappear
in the next three years because of automation and demanning.
''It's also an honour for my family, who have given a total of 170
years' service to the Northern Lighthouse Board.
''My grandfather began his career here at the Mull of Kintyre light in
1904 and I will end mine here when I retire next year.''

Nearly 80,000 acres of fine Highland land, with pheasants, deer and a
half timbered mansion- that's what John Fowler was pleased to hear had
been neglectful, not to say churlish, if he had not donned his walking
boots to inspect the property
This was mid-May but winter was having its last fling and ahead were
snow-clad hills, blindingly white in the morning sunshine
On either side of the water, hundreds of gaunt and leafless trunks,
decaying with age, were stretched out among green survivors
WHEN I heard that Mar Lodge Estate was mine I thought I'd best take a
look at it. A word of explanation: strictly speaking Mar Lodge now
belongs to the nation. It's mine and yours. Our new laird is the
National Trust for Scotland, a quango which theoretically acts on our
behalf.
Mar Lodge Estate, near Braemar, is a huge slice of the Highlands which
was owned most recently by mega-rich American John Kluge. Before Kluge
the owner was a ditto Swiss. After hard bargaining, a deal was struck
and the property will pass into the hands of the National Trust for
Scotland on July 1.
Since our National Trust is financially strapped, the cash enabling it
to buy and run the estate will be provided by others, principally the
National Heritage Memorial Fund (the Lottery) and a mysterious group of
wealthy backers called the Easter Charitable Trust, so shy in their
well-doing that they prefer to remain invisible.
Cock pheasants strutted on the lawn in front of the big house when I
crossed the white bridge over the Dee to meet Toby Metcalfe, whose firm
factored the estate for Kluge and has been retained by the new owners.
Mar Lodge is a large pink granite mansion -- more mock Tudor than
vernacular -- with mullioned windows and red-tiled, half-timbered
gables. It was built exactly a century ago for Princess Louise,
granddaughter of Queen Victoria. Within it the National Trust intends to
create a dozen upmarket flats which you or I, or any member of the
public, may rent for our holidays, given the right kind of wallet.
Mr Kluge had laid down that I shouldn't pass over the doorstep. But I
peered through a window or two and saw some bits and pieces of
furniture, the odd stag's head, and -- guarding a staircase -- a
life-size model of a Highland soldier in feather bonnet, scarlet jacket,
kilt, and diced socks. It's well known that all the panelling and ornate
plasterwork, destroyed in a disastrous fire four years ago, have been
meticulously restored.
Close by are the air-conditioned stables where Kluge's dancer wife
(they are no longer together) kept her horses before she decided she
didn't like the place. These, too, I didn't see.
So Toby Metcalfe and I lounged against a windowsill outside while he
ran smoothly through the principles of new management: conservation of
landscape and wildlife to have absolute priority; the public to roam
freely anywhere at any time (even in the shooting season); no
concessions to the tourist industry; some vehicle roads to be
downgraded; deer numbers to be severely reduced, especially in the
vulnerable Caledonian forest where remaining pine trees will be
encouraged to spread.
Next day I set out to tramp over my land. A quick look at the map was
enough to show that I'd see only a small part of it. Mar Lodge estate
extends over 77,000 acres or 117 square miles of mountain and moorland.
On the north-east corner of the estate are three mighty hills, the
rocky circlet of Braeriach and Cairn Toul, with Ben Macdui looming
across the Lairig Ghru (a famous high-level pass). They are the highest
hills in Britain after Ben Nevis. A whole clutch of Munros (mountains
more than 3000 feet in height) guard the northern fringes of the estate.
Apart from the wild cliffs and gullies of the northern hills, much of
the terrain is desolate moorland.
The wildlife is rich and varied. Ptarmigan and eagles are at home on
the high plateau, capercaillie nest in the forest. Rare plants take root
in the nooks and crannies of the higher reaches where winter weather
becomes almost arctic. ''Mar Lodge Estate is a crucial and pre-eminent
item from the very top drawer of the UK's treasury of natural
heritage,'' according to a document published two years ago by the
consortium of ''green'' organisations which tried vainly to acquire the
land for conservation before the intervention of the National Trust.
Most people who venture on to Mar Lodge estate start at the Linn of
Dee, six miles west of Braemar where the public road terminates at a
car-park. Family parties can wander in the woods or picnic by the Linn,
a gorge through which the young River Dee surges. More adventurous souls
head towards the mountains -- though rock and ice climbers and ski
mountaineers are more likely to approach from the Aviemore side.
Four cars converged on Linn of Dee just as I was about to set off. Out
tumbled a band of greyheads cheery as boys on an outing. There was a
babble of north-east voices as they pulled on woolly hats, shouldered
rucksacks, and strode off -- a bunch of enthusiasts from a club for
retired business and professional men in Banchory who head for the hills
once a week. I talked with them on the track through Glen Lui before our
ways parted.
The Lui Water flows through a wide flat-bottomed glen, crowded that
morning with a vast herd of stags. A scruffy, dun-coloured, shaggy lot
-- these were not Landseer's monarchs of the glen. They looked in need
of a brush and shampoo.
Some 3300 red deer roam over the estate, too high a number either for
their own good (they'll starve over winter) or for the survival of the
old forest, whose seedlings they munch. The red-deer question is a vexed
conservation issue in the Highlands and a key problem in the management
of Mar Lodge. Conservationists argue convincingly that deer numbers
should be greatly reduced. In the meantime, my ragamuffin neighbours
browsed in peace. Come August and the stalking season, it will be a
different case.
Approaching Derry Lodge, a two-storey gabled cottage with boarded-up
windows, I was passed by a Land Rover carrying National Trust staff on a
guided tour of the estate. Hitching a lift clearly wasn't on. Anyway, my
role was to demonstrate the sacred principle of ''the long walk in''.
This robust ethic of the outdoors demands that if you want to enjoy
yourself you have to work for it.
It's rather a long walk in to Derry Lodge and even further to the
hills, but there are compensations. The lodge is set among open
pinewoods and from there on a track leads pleasantly through shadowy
groves of craggy old pines. Virtually all are old stagers -- which in
pine-tree terms means 200 years or more -- but I passed a patch where a
knoll and a dell had been fenced in, and within the enclosure a healthy
crop of young trees was growing up. Given a chance, there's life in the
forest yet.
It was fresh in the shade and thin ice flecked the pools. This was
mid-May but winter was having its last fling and ahead were snow-clad
hills, blindingly white in the morning sunshine, though storm clouds
were approaching. Great cusps of bare rock showed where corries bit into
the mountainside of Derry Cairngorm.
Where Glen Derry opens into boggy green flatlands I veered away
towards a lesser hill. Beinn Bhreac is a Munro, but at 3051 feet or 931
metres, only just. It's a heathery lump presenting no challenge, but
it's a splendid vantage point.
I crossed the Derry Burn, clear water running over golden sand and
gravel, using a metal footbridge built in 1959 by the former Nature
Conservancy ''for the convenience of visitors to the Cairngorms Nature
Reserve'', and soon after passed a lone, stocky pine tree, last and
highest in the neighbourhood, along with its ghostly dead companion.
Then I followed a broad heathery ridge to approach the mountain from the
rear.
The straight-forward way would have been to hike along the bulldozed
track from Derry Lodge, but that was too much like a roadway for my
taste. Besides, my chosen route gave views to the core mountains of the
Cairngorms, with Macdui visible beyond Derry Cairngorm, and a cleft
showing where the Lairig an Laoigh, the second great pass of the region,
cuts through. Gradually the white bulk of Beinn a' Bhuird hove into view
to the east. To the south and west, a welter of cloud and shafts of
slanting grey showed squalls coming my way. Already pellets of snow were
spitting in the air.
The approach to the summit cairn (in fact cairns -- Beinn Bhreac is
double domed) provided good walking over stony ground with patches of
gravel and pads of moss, and luckily little snow at that level. From the
top I could see both arms of the old forest stretching far down the twin
glens Derry and Quoich.
By now the sun had disappeared. I zipped up my fleece jacket and
descended towards Glen Quoich, a vale of gloom, past a dark little pool
in the lap of the hill called Poll Bhat. The heather was thick and high,
and for a time it was easiest to hop down on dry boulders where a burn
ought to have been. Inexplicably, the stream suddenly disappeared below
ground and then, further down, issued quietly into the open again.
Another puzzle: a glossy brown lizard wriggled across a stone at my feet
-- what on earth brought this sun lover out in a snowstorm?
By the time my burn joined the Quoich Water, by now a wide and
swift-flowing river, I was back among pine trees again. Some past
catastrophe had knocked many of the forest giants down like nine-pins.
For a mile or so, on either side of the water, scores -- even hundreds
-- of gaunt and leafless trunks, decaying with age, were stretched out
among the green survivors.
According to Dr Adam Watson -- biologist, conservationist, Cairngorms
expert, and scientific adviser to the aforementioned consortium -- a
death-dealing hurricane occurred on the night of December, 28, 1879. The
same winds which swept away the first Tay Bridge also felled the
Caledonian pines of Glen Quoich.
I left the riverside and traversed a high gorge called Clais Fhearnaig
where steep slopes above a narrow loch were brown with heather. In
autumn it must be a fiery sight. Several star-shaped stumps poked out at
the waters' edge where trees had once grown -- but no more.
Restoring the old forest to good health has been one of the prime
objectives of the various conservation bodies interested in Mar Lodge
estate. At the moment the forest is slowly dying back, as trees succumb
to accidents and old age, and seedlings are eaten by deer as soon as
they show.
Young trees will grow behind fences, as I saw on my walk through Glen
Derry, but deer fences are unsightly, they cordon off the ground from
walkers, they kill the birds which fly into them in great numbers, and
above all they are unnatural. Nature doesn't build fences. Most
conservationists strongly oppose their use.
The preferred option is to cull the deer population. The Royal Society
for the Protection of Birds uses professional stalkers to reduce deer
numbers in Abernethy, the great forest it owns near Aviemore, with the
result that young trees are growing there again. The National Trust
states unequivocally that this will be the case at Mar Lodge, where deer
numbers -- thanks to management for sport, they have at least doubled in
the last half century -- will be cut progressively by half during the
next five years.
The controversial aspect of this policy is that, unlike the RSPB, the
trust will allow stalking for sport to continue over its ground. People
will pay to shoot deer, and the money will go to the upkeep of the
estate. Not only is stalking for sport at variance with the trust's own
practice in the past, but it offends many of the outdoors people on
whose goodwill the trust should depend.
How this about-face happened is one of several shadowy aspects
surrounding the Mar Lodge sale. Douglas Dow, the trust's director, said
the terms were laid down by the Easter Trust, which put up most of the
#5.5m it cost to buy the estate.
Few people know anything about the Easter Trust and those who do won't
talk. Even in the National Trust only one man, chairman Henry Leslie
Melville, is said to be in the secret. Rumours had circulated that
Prince Charles was involved but this is unlikely. There is speculation
that it may even involve a covert operation by some important members of
the National Trust, an organisation top-heavy with landowners (which
means sporting interests). For lack of any information, all sorts of
byzantine motives may be attributed.
Whether the Government has been involved behind the scenes is also
unknown. Before the National Trust came to the fore, Scottish Secretary
Ian Lang made it clear that no public money would be put up to buy Mar
Lodge for the nation. But if Mar Lodge had been controlled by yet
another millionaire from America or Switzerland or wherever, the
resulting popular outcry would have been highly embarrassing to a
Government already defensive in Scotland. Acquisition by the National
Trust must have been a congenial solution -- possibly more gratifying to
a Tory Government than if the consortium had succeeded in its earlier
bid.
This is by far the biggest wedge of wild country the National Trust,
best known for its care of stately homes, has taken into its care. And
while it has appointed a small specialist management committee to
supervise the estate, it has resisted pressure to invite nominations
from interested outside organisations. The voice of the people will not
be heard. Only time will show whether Mar Lodge is in safe hands.

The past five years have been tumultuous for Marina Mowatt. As Anvar
Khan reports
MARINA Mowatt has always been willing to put her public life on view.
She is Hello!-magazine friendly. She is populist. In the late eighties
she was nominated Rear of the Year, and the tabloids were saturated with
pix of her backside in a tight pair of jeans, earning her the title of
''Royal Rebel''. The spin-off being that she was suddenly regarded as
someone who showed the more human side of the Royal Family.
It was a family rift which catapulted Marina Mowatt into the public
eye. In 1989 she approached the press with the story that her parents,
Princess Alexandra and Sir Angus Ogilvy, had issued ultimatums regarding
her pregnancy by ''commoner'' boyfriend, Paul Mowatt. She alleged they
told her to have a Harley Street abortion or be married by special
licence. The Ogilvys returned that they had definitely not threatened to
cut off their only daughter whom ''they loved very much''.
From then on, the two factions operated through the media and the PR
officers at Buckingham Palace. Marina pleaded with tears in her eyes
during a TV interview with Robert Kilroy-Silk for her parents to call
her, to use the birth of her child as a new beginning for the family.
''I wish my mother would ring me. I love my parents. My parents are my
flesh and blood. I regret the fact that they do not feel that they can
stand by me, tell me that the door is always open and that I could
always contact them. I am not talking about financial support or asking
them for this and that. I just want their love.''
Princess Alexandra and Sir Angus Ogilvy responded that night to her
plea. A one-line statement issued through Buckingham Palace illuminated:
''Marina's parents would love her to get in touch with them.''
Marina and Paul eventually married in February 1990, when she was five
months pregnant. In an interview with Hello! magazine much later on,
when daughter Zenouska had been born, Marina took back all she had said
about her parents obdurance. She stated she and Paul had been under no
pressure at all to marry.
A talented pianist, Marina gave up her place at the Guildhall School
of Music in 1989 to set up home with photographer Paul Mowatt, a
non-royal, who at that point still lived with his mother in a
semi-detached in Kingston. From then on, she made much of the fact that
she did not approve of the Royal family. The Queen's cousin, 26th in
line to the throne, publically announced that neither she nor her
husband could stand the British class system.
''We both consider ourselves classless. I have no title, I've always
just been Miss Marina Ogilvy. Now I'm Mrs Marina Mowatt,'' she said.

HEN-HARRIERS fly with a floating, wavering buoyancy, seeming to slide
across the roll of the landscape like a kite. In the 1840s, Charles St
John remarked on how they ''quarter the ground as regularly as an old
pointer.'' He also noticed how late they could catch rats in the
stackyard. Hen-harriers hunt with their ears. After locating their prey
they pounce with a graceful, stalling pirouette and grasp it with long
yellow legs.
Females and the young used to be called ''ringtails'' for the white
rump conspicuous on their dark brown plumage. The males were ''blue
gleds'' or ''gull hawks,'' pale grey blue with the same white ring and
black wingtips. In past centuries hen-harriers were almost shot out of
existence.
In Orkney they maintained a stronghold, as they do now. After the
gamekeepers went to war, harriers have slowly recolonised the low moors
of Scotland. Though they are still killed in places where Parliament's
law does not run, it is a pleasure to find out they are less rare than
thought. One reason for this is the discovery, largely by biographer
Donald Watson, of their communal winter roosts. At the cold last light,
a scattering of birds will float into a marsh from their hunting
grounds. They are gone by dawn. Polygamy, most common in Orkney, means
that you're most likely to see a ringtail. But the biggest thrill is to
see the blue gled himself, rising and diving in his sky-dancing display
or flipping on to his back to pass a mouse to his mate in mid-air.
May the proscribed flourish and multiply.

* THE University of Aberdeen has announced plans to create one of the
UK's most advanced medical research institutes. The Institute of Medical
Science, planned as one of the largest hospital complexes in Europe,
will cost #25m and bring more than 150 jobs to the city.
The IMS will cover a wide range of medical spheres including genetic
causes of asthma, diabetes, and kidney disease, the causes of heart
attacks and strokes, and analysis of bone disease. It is planned that
medical advances resulting from the research work will be effectively
delivered to the community in the north-east of Scotland.
* ALMOST #50m has been awarded for 473 new research projects in the
UK. The ''Realising Our Potential Awards'' are given to researchers in
universities who are doing co-operative work with industry. One award,
worth #74,500 from the BASRA, was won by Professor Nial Bromage at
Stirling University to study the impact of the varying length of
daylight on Atlantic salmon. The fish spawn in early winter and the
project could find ways to increase the breeding period ultimately
leading to selling fresh fish for longer periods during the year.
* AT the San Pedro Research labs, a team has developed a new method
using magnets to detect salmonella in poultry egg supplies. The process,
which can be automated, could become an important tool in industry or
regulatory setting. It uses commercially available magnetic beads to
which salmonella antibodies are attached. Beads are placed in pooled
samples of eggs. Salmonella ''sticks'' to antibody-coated beads; magnet
pulls beads from pool; immunoassay detects any ''magnetised''
salmonella. Now if only the magnetic Edwina Currie had known that.

BILL McLaren, the BBC's Voice of Rugby, and a Herald columnist since
1961, has had his lifelong services to the game rewarded with an OBE.
McLaren, who is commentating at the Rugby World Cup in South Africa
for BBC Radio Five, is the doyen of rugby broadcasters and the soft
lowland tongue of his beloved Borderland is as well known in Cape Town
and Dunedin as it is in Kelso or Dunfermline.
In his youth, McLaren was a promising player and played at centre,
stand-off and, latterly, wing-forward for his home town of Hawick. He
turned out in a Scottish international trial before his playing days
were cruelly curtailed by illness.
It was in a Mansfield Park encounter with Glasgow Academicals in 1948
that he first felt the symptoms of what was later diagnosed as pulmonary
tuberculosis.
Doctors told him that he would spend four years in a sanatorium with
no guarantee that he would recover. However, he was treated with a
revolutionary new drug and made a full recovery after spending 20 months
in hospital.
As a reporter on the Hawick Express, McLaren made his commentating
debut on BBC radio at a South Africa v South of Scotland match at Hawick
in 1952. Seven years later, he made the transition from radio to
television and he has been the BBC's front-line commentator ever since.
The corporation offered him full-time employment, mixing rugby with
athletics, but Bill had by that time trained as a PE teacher and the
prospect of full-time television work did not appeal.
In his capacity as a PE teacher and rugby coach in Hawick's primary
schools, McLaren has seen many of his proteges go on to international
success.
The former Scotland captain Colin Deans, centre Jim Renwick and 1990
Grand Slam try scorer Tony Stanger, are just three of the McLaren old
boys who have made the grade at international level.
Meanwhile, there will be further celebration in Scottish rugby ranks
today as SRU president Ken Smith has been made a CBE.
Born in Edinburgh, he played for both Kelso and Watsonians, going on
to win 18 international caps. He moved into the union's administration
after acting as tour manager to New Zealand in 1981.
* J. Duncan Lowe, who is made a Companion of the Order of the Bath,
has been Crown Agent since 1991. He was previously procurator-fiscal of
Lothian and Borders. Educated at Hamilton Academy and Glasgow
University, he joined the procurator-fiscal service at Kilmarnock and
was assistant fiscal in Glasgow from 1980-83. He became deputy Crown
Agent in 1984.
* Mr Timothy (Robin) Cutler, CBE, has been director general of the
Forestry Commission since 1990. Born in India, and educated at Banff
Academy and Aberdeen University, Mr Cutler, 60, served with the colonial
forest service in Kenya, before working in forestry in New Zealand from
1964 to 1990.
* Mr Tom McCool, CBE, has been chief executive of the Scottish
Vocational Education Council (Scotvec) since 1986 and was formerly
depute director of education and divisional education officer for
Strathclyde Regional Council. Educated at Glasgow University and
Jordanhill College of Education, Mr McCool taught in several secondary
schools before entering educational administration in 1971.
* Mrs Rosemary McKenna, the president of the Convention of Scottish
Local Authorities and a Labour councillor in Cumbernauld and Kilsyth, is
made a CBE. Mr James Braid, a councillor in Fife, is awarded an OBE,
while Mr Ian Frain, a councillor in Kincardine and Deeside, is made a
MBE.
* Mr Charles Tyrrell, CBE, is a former chairman of the National Trust
for Scotland. Mr Tyrell, 64, farmed near Moffat in Dumfriesshire before
his appointment to the chair of the National Trust in July 1989. He
retired in April, and now lives in Suffolk with his wife, Lady Caroline.
* Mr Ernie Walker, CBE, past chairman of the Health Education Board
for Scotland, is probably better known as the former secretary of the
Scottish Football Association. Previously awarded the OBE, he has
recently been appointed to head a think-tank to guide the future of
Scottish football.
* Judith Weir, CBE, has achieved national prominence as a composer of
operas. Born in Aberdeenshire, she was educated in London and Cambridge,
and taught in Glasgow University's music department from 1979-82. She
served as composer in residence at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music
and Drama from 1988-91.
* Mr John Ashworth, OBE, is regarded as one of the main players in the
Scottish whisky industry and is chairman of Renfrewshire Enterprise.
Born in Yorkshire, he moved to Scotland in 1974 to head up Chivas
Brothers' operation in Paisley, before becoming managing director of its
parent group, Seagram Distillers.
* Mary Rose Caden, OBE, principal teacher of guidance at St
Augustine's High in Edinburgh, has been active in promoting teachers'
rights and conditions for many years. She is a former national president
of the Educational Institute of Scotland and is convener of the General
Teaching Council.
* Mr Neil Galbraith, OBE, has been director of education with the
Western Isles Council for the past 16 years. Born in Govan, Mr
Galbraith, 54, was educated and taught in Glasgow before moving to the
Hebrides to become principal history teacher at the Nicolson Institute
in Stornoway in 1968.
* Mrs Gillian Morbey, OBE, is now director of the organisation she
helped to set up, Sense Scotland, the national deafblind and rubella
association. A nurse, Mrs Morbey is married with two grown-up children.
* Mr David P Webster, OBE, is former chairman of the Commonwealth
Games Council for Scotland, and still serves on its executive, having
led the Scottish team to Victoria last summer. He is a former Scottish
weightlifting record holder and wrestler.
* Mr Fordyce Maxwell, MBE, is a former Herald columnist who now writes
for the Scotsman. He worked on a farm for several years before beginning
his career in journalism with the Farming News.
* Mrs Catherine Cunningham, MBE, is a laundry worker and seamstress at
Strathcarron Hospice in Denny. She was originally taken on as a
volunteer cleaner but so impressed the matron that she was invited to
take on her present post. Mrs Cunningham, 56, of Fankerton, has also
worked with Oxfam in a voluntary capacity.
* Michael Hart, MBE, is director of the Edinburgh International Jazz
Festival. Mr Hart, 61, began his music career as drummer with the band
of clarinettist Sandy Brown, making his first broadcast when he was 17.
* Peter Haining, MBE, of Dumbarton, has become Scottish rowing's most
successful competitor. At the 1993 world championships in Prague he
became the first Briton ever to win the lightweight sculls title, and
was only the third person to achieve a successful defence of that title
at Indianapolis last year.
* Mr Donald Ritchie, MBE, is Britain's most prolific breaker of world
long-distance athletics records. His exploits include world bests on the
track at 30, 50, 100 and 150 miles.
* Mr James Slater, MBE, is honoured for services to the fishing
industry. After 40 years at sea as a skipper, Mr Slater has been
chairman of the Scottish Pelagic Fishermen's Association, based in
Fraserburgh, since 1990.
* Mr David Whittick, MBE, has been involved with Riding for the
Disabled at its St Mungo Group in Glasgow since the early 1980s,
initially as a helper at classes and a fund-raiser.
*TWO of the three new Privy Councillors  are Scots. David Maclean, MP
for Penrith and the Border, is a junior Minister at the Home Office.
Lord Strathclyde, a former Scottish Office spokesman on agriculture and
fisheries, is now Government Chief Whip in the House of Lords.

men because they are not objective, they are very subjective!'' His head
emerges from a pile of paperwork on his desk, through which he has been
frantically rummaging in the quest for the piece of paper his hand now
eagerly clutches.
''Designers of men's clothes must never forget that they are
interpreters of tradition,'' he reads. Who wrote that, Sir Hardy? ''I
did! You see women don't understand that, but men do it instinctively.''
Is he seriously suggesting that there are no women designers who can
achieve a decent menswear collection?
''Certainly, I am talking about the suit with its appropriate coats,
such as blazers, sportscoats and evening coats. Women just can't do it,
their finished articles look as though they've drawn them with their
hands tied behind their backs.''
The fact that Savile Row has become synonymous with tailoring is
widely accepted. Its reputation as the place to go for the ultimate suit
is acknowledged worldwide and has largely been gained through more than
two centuries of maintaining the traditional standards of quality
bespoke tailoring.
Indeed, the street has even permeated and established itself in
Japanese. The Japanese word for a man's suit in English is sebiro.
Having licensed Hardy Amies Menswear in Japan for more than 20 years,
its expansion into Korea, Thailand and recently China has meant that in
the Far East, Amies feels that ''menswear is to us what the scent
business is to the French''.
He believes that the real business is to supply advice, designs and
sample suits to large menswear firms in the US, Canada, Australia, New
Zealand, Japan, Korea and Singapore, where reputation, the prestigious
Savile Row address and the value of a Royal Warrant all contribute to
making Hardy Amies Ltd a serious spinner of export revenue. It has 53
licensees operating in 14 countries producing an annual turnover in
excess of $US 150m.
The Oracle speaks again: ''There are two types of casual wear. One is
the sports coat and trousers and the other is the anorak brigade, and
the latter can go and do what they . . . I was going to say a rude
word.'' The thing about Sir Hardy is that he is a one-man show in
himself. It is highly amusing to watch this impeccably-dressed
86-year-old pontificate on the rights and wrongs of his business with
such unashamed dogma. Beginning most sentences with ''Now remember
this,'' intoned with the stern authority of a schoolmaster, at the same
time he exudes an air of childlike wickedness. With the flicker of a
grin playing upon his lips and a know-all glint in his eye you know that
as you bend your head to write copious notes he is making rude faces at
you to his long-time chum, Peter Hope Lumley, who is sitting with us.
Born in 1909, Amies lived and worked in France and Germany, becoming
fluent in both languages before returning to England to work as a
salesman for the weighing machine firm of W &amp; T Avery. Amies recalls his
days of ''staggering about with these monstrously heavy cast-iron
contraptions'' as particularly grim. However, selling scales to
butchers' shops was a pivotal point in learning the art of selling.
''Sell the weighing machine first of all to the salesman. I often think
of these words to this day when I bring down a new dress from the studio
to show it to my vendeuses.''
After Avery, Amies joined the House of Lachasse as a couturier in
London where he worked from 1934 to 1939 as manager. During the war he
served as an intelligence officer in the SOC. ''In the summer of 1945 an
old friend, Geoffrey Houghton-Brown, said over dinner to go and look at
a house in Savile Row. He, I and another old friend Alexis ffrench went
to inspect it. There was no need for keys. The first landmine to fall on
London had exploded where Savile Row police station now stands,
shattering the windows of number 14. We pushed open the door and walked
in.'' With the backing of #1000 each from 10 friends Amies bought number
14.
In his book Still Here, Amies records his illuminating experiences of
working with Stanley Kubrick on his famous film 2001. As the film was
released in 1968, Amies was set the task of designing clothes for a
period 33 years ahead.
Looking back over the previous 33 years he realised that because
clohing hadn't changed a great deal the costumes for the film need not
be dramatically futuristic. Kubrick, however, baulked at the suggestion
that the astronauts should wear disposable underclothes, commenting:
''Oh no, I shall have every housewife in the audience wondering if she
has made a mistake in ordering a new washing machine . . . ''
Amies delights in confiding to his reader the occasion in the film
when several airlines are travelling to the moon, Mars and other
planets. ''When I suggested that each airline should have its staff in
different uniforms, Mr Kubrick said: 'Oh no, in the year 2001 all
airlines will be owned by PanAm!'''
The method of looking back in order to proceed, as when thinking of
designs for the film 2001, is stressed by Amies in his book The
Englishman's Suit. By careful study of the past and appreciation of
tradition ''you cannot truly design or redesign a garment, the basic
shape of which is already determined by history. If you don't follow
tradition in a design of a suit inherited from the past, you have no
suit.'' He is quick to point out that the Italians, ''clever and
successful as they are'', have no tradition of great tailoring.
It is Amies' view that at about 20-year intervals the design of the
suit has to make a new statement. He explains that the double-breasted
suit that dominated the eighties has given way to the three-buttoned
single-breasted suit which is the most enduring style in the 100-year
life of the modern 'lounge' suit.
His prediction for the year 2000 is a high-fastening single-breasted
five-buttoned coat, with Ghillie collar, similar to the Deeside coat of
the 1860s. His vision for the girls is of a darkly-coloured short raglan
coat to-the-knee. ''She doesn't look as though she has any skirt on
underneath, she might have woollen tights the same colour as her coat
and she has this wonderful air of the 'I hope I'm not going to be late
secretary'.''
Of the man on the street, Amies is thankful that he sees ''an
improvement in general workwear in that we have said goodbye to bowler
hats and old gentlemen's suits''. He is less impressed by what he
glimpses in today's fashion magazines. ''I'll read possibly four pages
and shut it again. The standards are appalling, there are no ladylike
ladies in there anymore, I'm just not interested.
''Everything should always look as though it's been custom made.
People obviously bespeak clothes from us but it is also possible to have
a machine-made suit which looks like a bespoke suit.'' He concedes that
Armani has made an important contribution to the ready-to-wear market,
giving attention to comfort and style and perhaps coming closer to this
hint of something rather superior on the ready-to-wear market. He
believes British designer Paul Smith is ''generally going in the right
direction''.
''Now hear this,'' he reads. ''A dress is not a dress until it is sold
and rather than fantastic catwalk creations, one of the strengths of
this firm has always been in making clothes for the lives that people
actually live. I like to think that this has something to do with the
fact that the House of Hardy Amies has survived and flourished for 50
years.''

THE pundits had predicted a ''Chirac effect'', an increase in support
for the Gaullist RPR, a run-on effect of last month's presidential
election. It has failed to materialise.
In first-round voting in municipal elections last Sunday we
experienced instead a ''Le Pen effect'', a surge in votes for the
extreme right-wing National Front which blames everything from high
unemployment to bad housing, law-breaking, and drugs on the country's
well-established if not well-integrated immigrant population.
The secound-round vote, which will settle half a million jobs as mayor
and town councillor on candidates who emerged with more than 5% of the
vote in last week's poll, takes place tomorrow. And the far right is
perched on the threshold of unprecedented power and influence in local
politics.
All week long there has been breast-beating and anguished analysis
among the pollsters and media people in Paris who fool themselves into
thinking they influence opinion in the country. Why did they get it
wrong?
In 18 large towns and cities, the National Front scored 30% or more
last Sunday. In Dreux, a town to the west of Paris with a large
immigrant population and a particularly bad record of unemployment, one
of the party's stars, Marie-France Stirbois, scored more than 35%. A
national record was established in Noyon in Picardy where the National
Front candidate got 44% of votes. Bruno Megret, the organisation's
balding and baby-faced deputy leader, polled 43% in Vitrolles near
Marseilles, of which by tomorrow night he will almost certainly be
mayor.
The first division hand-ball team in Vitrolles, managed by Jean-Claude
Tapie, the brother of disgraced former Olympique de Marseilles chairman
Bernard Tapie, even took a noble albeit pathetic vow last week to
disband their club and move elsewhere if the National Front gains
control of their town this weekend.
''In our heads we've already left Vitrolles. It's hard, but it's
impossible to stay here with Megret. It's so much against our values,
what we stand for, comradeship and respect for the opponent,'' said the
team's captain Philippe Gardent yesterday.
Politicians also reacted sharply to last weekend's results. President
of the National Assembly Philippe Seguin, a man close to President
Chirac, called last Sunday for the creation of a ''Republican front'',
an alliance between established parliamentary parties which would have
allied lists of candidates in the municipal elections to bar the route
to the National Front. This impressively naive proposal, sympathetically
received by some senior Socialists, was thrown out of court by the new
RPR leader, Jean-Francois Mancel.
''We have two opponents, the National Front on one side and the
Socialists and the Communists on the other,'' Mr Mancel said.
National Front propaganda, meanwhile, seized skilfully on Mr Seguin's
idea to refuel their age-old paranoid accusations that the established
parties in France -- ''the gang of four'', as Mr Le Pen terms them --
have always persecuted the right-wing organisation. It is an argument
which goes well with the massive chips on shoulders of so many National
Front voters.
Founded nearly 23 years ago by Mr Le Pen, the National Front remained
an outsider organisation, with only around 1% of support, for a decade.
President Mitterrand, who saw in it a means of dividing and weakening
traditional right-wing parties, introduced proportional representation
and requested better television coverage for the National Front which
promptly went on to score 11% in the European elections of 1984, 14% in
the presidential election of 1988, and more than 15% in this year's
presidential poll.
During the 1980s, Mr Le Pen became a prized television performer. His
lies were outrageous, his arguments both irrational and immoral, but he
boosted ratings and producers loved him. Constantly encouraging and then
exploiting the fear of immigrants, the National Front put itself forward
towards the end of the decade as a force for moral renewal when the
Communist party was losing its grip in working-class areas and the
Socialist government was enmired in a never-ending series of corruption
scandals.
The very question of how the National Front acquired such influence
seems curiously useless now. All that matters is that in 48 hours' time,
in a significant number of large towns, the National Front will have
acquired a grip on housing, social services, special child allowances,
and much more -- the only extreme right-wing party in the whole of
Europe to have enjoyed such sinister and spectacular success.

The River Spey has been a source of success for many fishermen. Paul
Young writes of his love affair with the river despite its reluctance to
provide him with a pot of gold
IT is odd how a river can hold a warm place in your heart without
having ever delivered its bounty to you. So it is with my love affair
with the Spey. I have read lovingly about its magnificent fly water, I
have seen anglers take fish from it, but I remain a Spey virgin. I have
never hooked a fish from it over the years, though I have had my
chances.
Like the time we were filming with Arthur Oglesby. It was prime time,
May, and the fish were running. Under the trees on the far bank, I rose
two fish to the fly but neither took hold, or came a second time. The
only satisfaction I had was to net a split-fresh fish for Arthur. He had
only one take, the fish stuck and a bright springer was on the bank.
Vicarious pleasure that, to see the quality of the fish that I hadn't
caught, and a doubling of determination to land a catch of my own.
My chance came at the end of last month. May again, fish running, the
water in magnificent condition just dropping off after a rise of a foot
or so. Driving up to the river, the skies were magnificent. Lots of
cloud, with the occasional shower. Rainbows to the north-east, in the
direction of Grantown-on-Spey, as we passed Aviemore. Could the pot of
gold, or preferably, the bar of silver, be lying in wait?
A floating line, 12-pound nylon and a Munro Killer was the gillie's
suggestion, and who was I to argue? The Spey is a demanding river. You
have to cast long and wade deep, so you are asked to wear a flotation
collar -- which I did happily -- and had the added security of a wading
stick as I ventured out into the head of the pool.
It was eight o'clock and the evening was stunning. On the bank, a hen
mallard ushered six chicks fussily away from me, swifts were screaming
overhead and small trout, or perhaps smolts dropping down to sea, were
grazing happily on a copious hatch of flies. A salmon splashed at the
tail of the pool and I was shaking with expectancy. I managed to get the
fly over the taking spots as I fished the pool down twice. A sea trout
jumped noisily as darkness fell but I didn't get a bite from the fish.
Midges yes, fish no.
A bath back at the digs, a discussion of what went wrong and to bed
with even more determination for the 'morrow.
Another good fishing day. High cloud, air temperature above that of
the water . . . just right. The morning was spent like the previous
evening, marvelling at the river and the perfection of the fly water,
and once again, not an offer.
We took a wander to some of the other beats at lunchtime. There was a
10-pounder that had been landed minutes before we arrived and a
12-pounder taken by another angler moments after starting. Both were
without sea-lice, clean and beautifully proportioned. Another spur to
open my account.
Before long I was back up to my waist in the fast-flowing Spey. I had
to tread carefully. Make my cast, fish it out, and gently wade my yard
downstream, negotiating the boulders to find the haven of the sandy
patches behind them before making the next cast. I had fished the gurgly
water at the head of the pool and the fly was coming over one of those
lovely black, flat patches towards the tail where a fish might stop for
a rest after coming through the rough water below, when there was a
movement on the surface. With a lot of line out, it was difficult to see
if it was actually at the fly, but it certainly wasn't far away. John,
the gillie, had seen it too.
''Don't move, and try him again,'' was his advice. I pulled the line
back, cast again, and the line went out towards the same spot. It fished
over the black patch and I was fizzing with expectancy. Nothing.
''Again,'' I was told. Out the line went and at the expected spot, the
fish showed, coming at the fly, but not touching it.
''Cast your fly to me, and we'll try him with something different,''
said John. I threw the fly to the bank and he tied on a shrimp-type with
a fairly long tail. Into the water it went, and as it came over the fish
there was an aggressive boil and a sharp pull. I waited for a
micro-second for the line to go, but no. That was it. I tried the fish
several times more, but it had lost interest. Perhaps it had just pulled
the tail of the fly, or flet the hook. It didn't want to play any more.
But those few moments made the trip, the adrenalin had flowed . . .
they encapsulated what salmon fishing is about. The few seconds that can
alter your life. It only takes a second to hook a salmon. You just have
to be there at the right second.
And so far as the Spey is concerned, I'm happy to wait for that
specific second for as long as it takes.

JANE SMILEY and I are dining in Edinburgh. The Pulitzer Prize-winning
author of A Thousand Acres is paddling her digits in the finger-bowl.
The langoustines are long gone, the leg of lamb awaits, and I'm smiling
a deeply ironic smile. I have ordered steak. Will she understand my
tongue-in-cheek tribute to her new novel Moo? She must do. She has a
PhD, she has written seven novels, she teaches creative writing.
Besides, there is a cow on the cover.
But Jane Smiley is not falling for my basic dot-to-dot humour. Not
today -- instead she's impersonating crime maestro James Ellory, the
night owl with the death growl, in his agent's office. ''I heard he was
just standing there going, 'Jane Smiiiiley, Moooooo!' '' Her
impersonation hints at Ellory's demented sex obsession. She's never met
him and though they both tower above six feet, they don't see
eye-to-eye.
''I picked up a collection of his short stories.'' Did she like them?
''I didn't finish them.'' But she did finish Jeff Torrington's Swing
Hammer Swing which she reviewed in the Washington Post, though she did
request a two-week extension to negotiate round the dialect. ''But the
beauty of the style was the reward. I loved it.''
Other critics have been equally effusive about Jane Smiley's work.
Alison Lurie called her ''the Balzac of the Midwest'' in her New York
Times review of Moo, which sold 120,000 copies in it's first month. A
Thousand Acres sold 700,000 copies following it's praise by the Pulitzer
committee. Unlike our own Booker prize which is kicked round the media
like touch football, the Pulitzer is prized.
''The great thing about the Pulitzer is that it's mostly a journalism
award and so the newspaper people are always trumpeting the Pulitzers
because they are trumpeting themselves. So all the book people get a
huge free ride on the backs of the newspaper people and it makes a big
change in your sales. It was great.''
The free ride began with an early-morning breakfast call to Jane
Smiley's home in Ames, Iowa, where she lives with her third husband and
three children. What she thought of as a joke mushroomed into her
biggest moment in 1992. The ceremony, where she collected her abstract
crystal prize, was held at Columbia University and was tinged with noble
pathos.
''It was wonderful, partly because the man who won for autobiography
was Lewis B Puller, the son of a marine general, who served in Vietnam.
He was the most injured survivor. He was essentially blown up, so he
wrote a memoir about his father, his experiences in the war and
afterwards as this crippled person.''
She adds that he has since committed suicide.
Tragedy runs like a dark spring through all her work, including her
epic The Greenlanders in which almost all the 51 characters with names
like Asgeir Gunnarsson and Steinumn Hraensdottir die. However, it
reached it's nadir in the lyrical beauty of A Thousand Acres in which
the tragedy of Shakespeare's King Lear was transported to rural Iowa.
Tragedy has also stained her own life. Though her mother was a
newspaper reporter, her father returned from the Second World War with
post-traumatic stress disorder. He left his wife when Jane was one. The
last time she saw him was when she was five. In 1982 she tracked down
his address and posted him her first two novels; they were found by his
bed when he died of cancer shortly afterwards.
As a child, when she couldn't sleep she would imagine disasters and
how she would escape them. When she had figured a way to cope with each
new trauma, she slept easy. Fear still flows through her life, but not
of performance, writing or people. ''I imagine horrible things happening
to my children . . . a number of years ago I decided that was the price
of having an imagination.
''A friend of mine said there are two kinds of fear . . . one is fear
of performance and the other is physical fear. I have no fear of
performance, no fear of public speaking, no fear of writing, no fear of
having a book come out, but I have always been afraid of physical
things, afraid of car accidents, plane crashes, men's faces appearing in
the window on a dark night.''
The faces peering through the window in Moo are either bovine or
bacon. Cows and pigs, as well as chickens, form the prominent debates at
Moo U, a huge agricultural college in rural Iowa. It's David Lodge's A
Small World with corn stalks behind its ears and a gallery of rascals
and rogues you'd never skewer on a meat-hook.
There is Earl Butz, a 700-pound pure white hog locked in the basement.
There is Lionel Gift, an economics professor with an insatiable desire
for consumer goods. There is Mrs Walker, secretary to the provost and
power behind the throne. And there is Chairman X, an eccentric former
radical who plans to quash the non-environmentally sound as it emerges.
There are plots like Dr Gift's conspiracy to aid a jug-eared
billionaire to mine gold under Costa Rica's last rain forest, and a
farmer's need to reveal his secret plans for a machine to revolutionise
American agriculture as he lives in terror of the FBI. Oh, and the Dean
of Extensions, Nils Helimich, is being told by God to marry the dinner
lady, breed six kids, and move to eastern Europe.
It is a novel to love. Moo fires a quiver-full of cupid's arrows at
your funny-bone, all bull's-eyes. It's laugh-out-loud funny but
continually raises the question of agricultural mismanagement.
''You can trace the rise of the right-wing hate groups to bad farming
policy,'' explains Ms Smiley over her main course. ''It stems back to
the early to mid-eighties when there was a land boom and banks were
offering loans using land to secure it.
''Well, eventually that went belly-up. A great deal of consolidation
took place. Farms were taken over and went into the hands of a small
group, the same happened with banks, and people became very bitter. They
couldn't see their own error, all they could see was conspiracy.''
There is little evidence of hate groups in Iowa as its flat landscape
does not allow the kind of camouflage which the mountains of Michigan
and Montana offer to anti-American activities. But a rumour is sweeping
the state that the first bank which the Oklahoma bombers robbed was in
Smiley's home town of Ames.
Since her first novel Barn Blind, Smiley has skipped through the
genres. ''No form of literature expresses all forms of your personality
so no forms are perfect.
''Every time I'm writing a novel I think, oh, this is the best genre.
When I was writing The Greenlanders, I would say to myself all novels
are historical novels, and then when I was writing Duplicate Keys I
would think well, really all novels are mysteries. Now when I was
writing Moo, I didn't think all novels were comic, but I did think all
novels should be comic.''

Ten years after Antony Farrell began plans to build The Lilliput Press
in Dublin, the publishing house is enjoying award-winning success.
Hayden Murphy looks at the celebrations planned to mark the boom decade.
ARCHITECTURE provides a sitting parallel for the activity that is
publishing. These are the words of 44-year-old Dubliner Antony Farrell,
founder-director of The Lilliput Press which celebrates its tenth
anniversary this weekend. To mark the decade it has produced a boxed
four-cassette tape of Patrick Healy reading Finnegans Wake (#19.99).
There is also a complex but intriguing study of Joyce's Textual Diaries
(#18) by the American scholar Danis Rose, and later in the year it will
publish John Kidd's ''Dublin Edition'' of Ulysses (#19.99). To complete
the Joyce connection, the man himself appears doing a serious but
secretive pub-crawl in Dublin in 1929 researching for his ''work in
progress'' (Finnegans Wake: 1941) in one of David M Kelly's superb
literary fables in A Night In The Catecombs (#7.99).
All of these titles are launched this week to mark a day celebrated
liquidly by Dubliners, comparatively dryly by critics, and fluidly by
Joyceans. June 16, 1904, is the day Leopold Bloom, a Jewish citizen of
Dublin, stepped out in Joyce's novel Ulysses (1922) and wandered around
the city, uneasily aware of his wife Molly's infidelities, generously
prepared to protect another family's derelict Stephen Dedalus. Stephen
is a warped alter ego for Joyce. Leopold is a European Everyman tortured
into constant mental exile. Both are central to Bloomsday.
This has in recent times become somewhat of a commercialised literary
event, but for those of us who project fun from page to pub it becomes
an occasion to eat Gorgonzola at lunch, back a grey horse in the
afternoon to recall Throwaway's Gold Cup win in 1904, and at nightfall
read aloud the affirmation of lust, vulnerability, and expansiveness
that are Molly's last words: ''Yes, I said yes I will, yes''.
All of this is shared enthusiasm with Farrell in his tiny office house
in Arbour Hill, on the north side of Dublin, just down the road from the
quicklime graves of those executed in Easter 1916.
Farrell is dapper and studiously polite. Waistcoated, with a slightly
accented edge to his Dublin accent giving a hint of his Harrow
schooling. He read history in Trinity College Dublin and during the
seventies was apprenticed in publishing with Orbis. During the eighties
he worked for Irish publishers O'Brien and Wolfhound. Late in 1984 he
''began to build the House of Lilliput'' with a pamphlet by Tim
Robinson. It sold to Penguin, as did Stones of Aran (1986). Farrell
moved in 1989 from his Mullingar home to the present address, and now
has a staff of four and successful connections in Britain and America.
''High literary standards and tangible quality are by tradition
obligatory bedfellows'' is his mild explanation for Lilliput's
award-winning critical and commercial success.
There is more. An enduring and endearing willingness to take chances.
Hubert Butler (1900-91) has yet to be recognised for the great essayist
that he is this side of the Irish Sea. Yet as the imploding violence in
the Balkans gets uncomprehending headlines, he is the writer who exposed
the divisions beneath the present crisis as far back as the late 1940s.
Single-handedly he explored the complicity of the Catholic Church with
fascist nationalism in Yugoslavia.
Condemned, and almost silenced, by the Irish clergy, he yet persisted.
Now his collected writings, Escape From the Anthill (#5.95), The
Children of Drancy (#14.95), Grandmother and Wolfe Tone (#16.95), and
the forthcoming ''Final Essays'' A Prayerful Project (#16.95), are
challenging evidence that secular independence can and will outlast
self-protecting interference and censorship.

Beijing, Saturday
CHINA today announced that it was recalling its ambassador to the
United States, plunging troubled relations to their lowest ebb since
ties were established 16 years ago.
''The Chinese Government has decided to recall Ambassador to the
United States Li Daoyu to report on his work in view of the current
state of Sino-US relations,'' the Foreign Ministry announced.
Beijing had threatened serious consequences after the US edged open an
effective 16-year ban on any visits by leaders of rival Taiwan this
month by allowing a private trip by Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui.
China furiously denounced the visit, saying US permission for Lee's
trip had gravely damaged relations, begun on January 1, 1979, after
Washington switched recognition to Beijing's communist government from
Nationalist-ruled Taipei.
In Washington, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said: ''We
very much regret that the Chinese Government has chosen to withdraw its
envoy from Washington and we hope that his absence from Washington will
be temporary.
''We continue to seek a constructive relationship with a strong,
stable and open China.''
Li told Under-Secretary of State Lynn Davis, who is acting secretary
while Secretary of State Warren Christopher is in Canada for the G7
summit, that he was being recalled.
US officials appeared privately to be taking heart that Li did not say
he was leaving his post permanently.
However China's decision to withdraw its ambassador, even temporarily,
signalled a sharp deterioration in ties between the two Pacific giants.
Relations have often see-sawed, rocked by trade disputes, human rights
issues, and rows over arms sales.
However, it was the first time Beijing had taken such drastic action
since ambassadors were first exchanged as a result of seven years of
tortuous diplomatic negotiations.
China has issued a string of vitriolic attacks in the last few days,
warning repeatedly of further retaliatory action and telling Washington
it was ''playing with fire''.
Beijing cancelled visits by US officials, called off a high-level
military mission to the United States, and postponed talks on missile
controls after Lee's visit was announced.
''The basis of the relationship between China and the United States
has been damaged,'' a Foreign Ministry spokesman said last week. ''And I
believe that is really something grave.''--Reuter.

Strawberries can so often disappoint, but Lady Claire MacDonald argues
that, in the right circumstances, they are without parallel
STRAWBERRIES are a very emotive subject for me. I feel strongly that
their year-round availability has led to the downfall of their
popularity and certainly their image. I utterly deplore their
availability outside the natural season in this country. I have always
been a seasonal cook, and one of the joys of eating and cooking is the
way foods come round in their seasons. But when you can buy items like
strawberries all year round, and when people do buy them and find they
are tasteless, they tend to assume that that is how strawberries taste
always, and they cease to be the seasonal treat they deserve to be.
I won't even buy English strawberries. I wait until Scottish
strawberries can be found, and better still, the berries grown in
Insches fruit farm outside Inverness where I buy most of my soft summer
fruits.
A certain number of strawberries are grown here on Skye. These and the
Insches fruit have the true taste of strawberries -- they taste as
strawberries should, not the watery acidic taste of strawberries grown
in Chile in November or December. Don't be taken in by huge strawberries
-- I'm sure that some growers aim for size, but this by no means equals
flavour. When strawberries first become available locally, for my own
use I just hull them, pile them on an ashet, and dust them with caster
sugar. Some insist on thick cream, or whipped cream, to eat with them,
but I much prefer fresh orange juice.
When I was growing up and living in Rome for two wonderful years, I
learned that the flavour of strawberries is best complemented by fresh
orange or lemon juice. They are also good tossed in a small amount of
balsamic vinegar, and I know that some people love them with freshly
ground black pepper. Much as I adore black pepper, I personally don't
like it with strawberries.
The other combination I dislike is chocolate. I can't understand how
anyone can mix the two. The acidity of the strawberries kills the
flavour of the chocolate, and the chocolate just accentuates the acidic
side of the strawberries.
On the other hand, and perhaps surprisingly to some of you who may not
have discovered this for yourselves, coffee and strawberries are a
delicious combination. One of the classic puddings using strawberries is
Strawberry Japonais, where two meringues made with ground almonds are
sandwiched together with strawberries and whipped cream, and the top
covered with coffee icing.
Strawberries are also good served with coffee ice-cream. A spice which
also greatly complements the taste of strawberries is cinnamon. Cinnamon
can be used to flavour pavlova or sponge cake, and either of them served
with strawberries and cream. Cinnamon is a widely useful spice, because
it goes very well with coffee, too, and you can put cinnamon into coffee
ice-cream and then combine both with strawberries.
Of all the complementary tastes with strawberries the best, for me, is
elderflower. This exquisite flower, its tiny and creamy clusters in
season from towards the end of June through till mid-August, can be used
to enhance the flavour of strawberries (and gooseberries) via an
infusion in a lemon syrup. You can freeze quantities of this syrup for
use in the later part of August or even September for late-cropping
strawberries, but I have tried freezing the flowers themselves and this
just doesn't work -- they lose all their flavour.
I just marinade the sliced strawberries in an elderflower syrup for
several hours. I know that you can buy elderflower cordial, but it is no
substitute for homemade elderflower syrup, which I make using one pint
of water to 8oz granulated sugar, the pared rind of one lemon, and when
the sugar has dissolved completely I simmer the syrup gently for five
minutes, then add the juice of the lemon and the elderflowers and leave
till the syrup has cooled. Strain the syrup, and you are ready to
marinade your strawberries.
Strawberry Terrine
* HERE is a recipe using fresh orange juice, lemon, and sliced
strawberries in a jelly set in a terrine mould. Served with a salad of
strawberries and sliced oranges it makes a very refreshing finale to a
summer lunch or dinner.
Serves 6-8
1 pint freshly squeezed orange juice (you can use the bottles of
freshly squeezed orange juice from Marks &amp; Spencer)
Juice of 1 lemon
[1/2] pint of water and orange liqueur -- I leave the ratio up to you!
1-2oz sugar -- depending on how sweet is your tooth
2 sachets gelatine, or 8 leaves of Costa's gelatine
1lb strawberries, hulled and chopped
Start by measuring the water into the saucepan and adding liqueur.
Stir in the sugar over gentle heat till the sugar has dissolved.
Sprinkle the gelatine into the hot liquid and shake the pan gently,
which should dissolve the granules or the leaves. Stir in the lemon
juice, and then stir together this gelatine liquid with the fresh orange
juice. Put the chopped strawberries into a terrine mould -- I use Pyrex
for this, 28cm long; as I bought these Pyrex terrines in the hardware
shop in Kyle I'm sure they will be easily found elsewhere, and they are
most useful.
Pour the orange juice and gelatine liquids in with the oranges and
leave a spoon in the terrine to remind you to stir the contents as it
sets, otherwise the strawberries settle down in the jelly and you have
about an inch of orange jelly on the bottom, once the terrine is turned
out.
Dip the Pyrex terrine in hot water for a few minutes, then turn out
the jellied orange and strawberries. Surround with orange and strawberry
salad.
By the way, Lakeland plastics sell packets of strawberry hullers, and
they are very useful and save my thumbnails from pain which is
inevitable if I am hulling any quantity of strawberries.

Escape from domestic violence can be almost impossible for women
isolated in remote areas. Research, as Jean West reports, shows that
victims unable to run often suffer in silence or commit suicide
These villages are so small, everyone notices everything
IN NEED of rustic retreat one weekend last year, I headed south of the
border with a group of like-minded friends. As we entered the sleepy,
pretty village of Bishop's Castle, burning wood smoke from cottage
chimney stacks wrapped the place in a cosy blanket.
A picturesque B&amp;B had a vacant sign in the window and a white-haired,
kind faced landlady came to the door after we rang the bell. She showed
us the rooms, which were spotless, and we immediately snapped them up.
Everything seemed perfect.
Our fond imaginings were soon shattered. As we wandered past the
kitchen on the way out to the pub we were party to the furious rantings
of an angry man. ''Where's my f****** tea?'' yelled our landlady's
ingracious spouse, banging his knife and fork on the table-cloth like
some demented cartoon character.
When it was duly served, there ensued a further tirade -- ''I wouldn't
feed this to the dog. It's a tough as boot leather. I bet you wouldn't
feed them upstairs this.''
The humiliated woman was on pins. With tears in her eyes she begged
him to keep his voice down -- ''There are people staying. You can't let
them hear this.'' Perhaps this wasn't the get-away-from-it-all escape we
had envisaged.
A new report compiled for the relaunched Zero Tolerance Campaign,
which since 1992 has been confronting violence against women, highlights
the truth about abuse of women in rural communities. Physical, emotional
and sexual violence in these areas has been identified as a significant
problem needing a separate specialist approach.
Little work has been done to chart the degree of domestic violence in
the British countryside and there is nothing to suggest it is worse than
anywhere else. But isolation can paralyse rural women and make it easier
for perpetrators to hold them hostage.
Janette Forman, of the Women's Support Project in Strathclyde, helped
compile the study after Zero Tolerance recognised that material and
literature used for the initial city-based Edinburgh drive would have to
be adapted for rural areas. Based on the information from women's
organisations and others living and working in remote parts of Scotland,
it found victims geographically and socially on their own. Forman says:
''It is difficult to pinpoint the extent of the problem. What is clear
is that these women have more difficulty accessing information, help,
and people to talk to. In one area women were quite fearful of a heavy
presence of Zero Tolerance without consultation and proper resources.
Women would, they said, be in a vulnerable position.''
Transport is an obvious stumbling block to country women needing to
escape abusive partners. Lack of cash if the purse strings are
controlled by a selfish husband makes fares an issue and in very small
communities there is always the chance that the bus or taxi driver will
be an informing friend of the man the woman is trying to escape. Not
only do transport difficulties keep her from running away, but they
forbid access to the already sketchy help networks and agencies that
exist.
A spokeswoman for Cunninghameshire Women's Aid said: ''When you are
talking about leaving a place like Arran where, on some days, there may
only be one ferry off the island, the ferry port is the obvious place a
man would go to find his partner.''
The Zero Tolerance report echoes these difficulties: ''The woman may
not be able to drive or has no access to the car, no neighbours to hear
cries for help, no phone at home, no phone boxes.'' One example
highlighted in the report was of a woman who lived with her husband,
daughter, and his parents. He took the telephone away when he went out,
superglued the windows and left his wife no means of contacting help.
Her sources of support were her daughter and a friend who occasionally
visited the house. The woman and her daughter planned to escape while on
a shopping trip with her husband. When the car slowed down at traffic
lights in a nearby town, both threw themselves out of the car and ran
for help to the social work department. But being in a small town, it
was obvious to the husband where they would go and he found them. New
data released by the Samaritans suggests suicide is even more prevalent
among country dwellers than their urban counterparts. So much has rural
isolation concerned them that they have started a new drive to encourage
those affected to talk.
A spokeswoman for the Samiritans says: ''You may get two female
victims of domestic violence, one would cope and the other would become
suicidal. It depends on how they cope with isolation. If they have no
outlet for their feelings, the pressure can become too much and take
them to the brink.''
A spokeswoman for Wigtownshire Women's Aid adds: ''Isolation is a
terrible thing but leaving can be almost impossible. We are in
Stranraer, if women head here questions are asked. You have to have a
reason for leaving. These villages are so small, everyone notices
everything.''
Social needs in rural communities also have a bearing on the
protection of the perpetrator. It may be difficult for them to take
action because he has particular skills they require or holds a
prominent position in the district.
One woman contacted for the report remembered an event where a woman's
husband was dragging her along by her hair in full view of everyone in
the village main street. She ran into a local shop for help and the
police were called. Her husband was a local councillor -- the incident
was not recorded.
Elderly women in the community tend to accept the ''you've made your
bed, you'd better lie in it'' philosophy. So what, if anything can be
done?
Forman says: ''Services need to be tailor-made for different regions
as far as possible. The church and health service could be brought
together to tackle the issues. Consultation is vital.''
Some of the more practical difficulties like transport, lack of
privacy, access to information and services may be harder to resolve.
But at least they are being brought into the open for debate.
One woman mused that farm animals were treated better by men than many
rural woman. When they are sick a vet is brought in, when they are
hungry they are fed, when they are hurt they are treated.
* A Zero Tolerance cinema advert has just been launched across
Scotland to highlight the problem of violence against women. For more
information about the campaign contact the women's unit at your local
council.

Budennovsk, Friday
CHECHEN gunmen today freed two children whom they had held hostage
along with hundreds other people in the southern Russian town of
Budennovsk.
The gunmen, who demand that Russia stops its violent military
operation in the breakaway republic of Chechnya, are holding up to 2000
people in the Budennovsk hospital.
Russian television showed telephone negotiations between a Russian
official and the gunmen on the possible release of a two-year-old child,
reported to be suffering from an infectious disease.
Chechen field commander Shamil Basayev, who heads the attackers, told
a news conference yesterday that five hostages had been killed and
others would be shot dead if Russia failed to meet all demands set by
the gunmen.
At least 117 people, including police, troops, and civilians, have
been killed since about 200 fighters launched their attack on
Budennovsk, north of the rebel Chechnya, on Wednesday.
Russian officials seemed to be at a loss over how to handle the
crisis.
Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev said the only way to save the
hostages was to use force ''as soon as possible.''
However Deputy Prime Minister Nikolai Yegorov argued that any attempt
to storm the hospital where the hostages are held could be disastrous.
''The use of force is inappropriate because the lives of hundreds of
innocent people held at gunpoint by bandits are involved,'' he told
Tass.
The rebels renewed their threat to blow up the hospital with their
captives and themselves inside after new talks with Russian officials
failed.
Russian officials said they had offered the Chechens ''any amount of
money'' in exchange for the hostages and would provide a plane to allow
the fighters to leave the country.
Stavropol regional governor Alexander Korobeinikov, appointed by the
government to head negotiations with the Chechens, acknowledged the
talks had so far proved fruitless. ''Everything depends on Moscow now,''
he told Tass.
The Russian Parliament, outraged by what it views as the negligent
handling of the crisis, urged President Boris Yeltsin to fly home
immediately from the G7 summit in Canada.
The State Duma also asked Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to head
negotiations with the rebels. The Duma leadership will discuss whether
to hold a no-confidence vote in the government.
The gunmen today released the bodies of 50 people, most of whom were
thought to have died of wounds after the original raid on Budennovsk,
Tass said.
Basayev said he and his men were prepared to die. ''It does not matter
to us when we die, what matters is how we die. We must die with
dignity,'' he told a news conference yesterday. ''If we have to we will
shoot the hostages.''
Stepashin said Russia had already met several demands. ''We are
dealing not with simple terrorists, but political terrorists,'' he said.
The Budennovsk attack may turn out to be a sign of desperation from
the Chechen fighters, who have basically been defeated by
better-equipped Russian soldiers in six months of bloody fighting in the
breakaway region.
The Chechens swept into the town of 100,000 people 50 miles from
Chechnya on Wednesday in a commando-style raid, bringing the nightmare
of a Chechen terror campaign on Russian soil home to Moscow.

Egion, Friday
RESCUE workers reached an eight-year-old boy buried alive for more
than 40 hours after a powerful earthquake reduced his apartment block in
the Greek town of Egion to rubble.
Andreas Bogdanos, whose grandmother died in the quake, was brought to
safety through a long, narrow tunnel burrowed into a mass of concrete
and debris by Greek and Swiss rescue workers.
''Until a few hours ago I could not believe that Andreas would make
it,'' said the boy's tearful mother, Roula Bogdanos. ''I can't wait to
hold him in my arms.''
Bystanders in Egion, hit yesterday by an earthquake measuring 6.1 on
the Richter scale, cheered and clapped as the boy was carried to an
ambulance. The last hours of the laborious rescue were televised live by
most Greek stations.
''It's the first good news in all this tragedy,'' said Education
Minister George Papandreou. ''He's a fighter, full of life and energy
and that's why he survived.''
Rescue workers, who dug three 5yd tunnels to reach the boy, hugged and
cried after Andreas was pulled out. They said he was a brave boy who
even joked with them during his ordeal.
''His vital signs are good. He had some pain in his leg but I could
not tell if it was broken,'' said medic Dimitris Pyrros before rushing
Andreas to hospital.
Andreas's father Andris had kept a constant vigil at the site, coaxing
his son to be brave.
At least 20 people, including 10 French tourists and an Italian woman,
were killed and about 60 injured by the quake which struck the coastal
region on the Gulf of Corinth, 90 miles west of Athens.
All deaths were in the Eliki hotel or the apartment block where
Andreas was found and his aunt, a mentally retarded mute who is confined
to a wheelchair, was still trapped.
The woman, Maria Elvira Frangonikolopoulou, was located by sniffer
dogs along with the boy. The discovery raised hopes that about 10 people
buried in the rubble of the apartment block might still be alive.
Rescue workers said tunnelling through the heavy debris was laborious
and tiring work.
''We're advancing very slowly with hammers and chisels,'' said Thierry
Angeretas, a member of the Swiss team. ''We're afraid the vibrations
would bring down the whole area.''
The earthquake caused widespread destruction throughout the western
Greek region near the port of Patras and more than 15,000 people were
forced to abandon their homes.
Civil engineers have daubed more than 1000 houses and buildings with a
red X, marking them as uninhabitable through damage. Most shops were
closed with smashed windows or other damage from the tremor.--Reuter.

THE only whisky distillery in Scotland with an English name is to be
sold to a Scottish company by its English owner.
The Pulteney Distillery in Wick, named after Sir William Pulteney, a
19th century herring magnate, will soon be the property of
Scottish-owned Inver House Distillers, of Airdrie, Lanarkshire.
The present owner, London-based Allied Domecq, controls the Caithness
plant through its Allied Distillers subsidiary.
All 17 jobs at Scotland's most northerly mainland distillery are said
to be safe, and its famous Old Pulteney malt whisky -- a key ingredient
of Drambuie liqueur -- will live on.
Inver House was bought out by its managers from the previous American
owners in 1988, and its latest aquisition means the Lanarkshire firm
will soon own three Scotch whisky distilleries.
Although Sir William -- a pioneer of the British Fisheries Society
which established Wick as the world's busiest herring-fishing port in
the nineteenth century -- was born a Scotsman, he adopted the Pulteney
surname of his wealthy English bride.
After his death, his fellow-directors of the society gave the name of
Pulteneytown to their new settlement and harbour at Wick, which catered
for a fishing fleet which peaked at 1200 boats during the 1860s.
The distillery there was set up in 1826, to cater for the demand from
many of the 10,000 who were employed at Wick's herring fishery

* THEY call it the superhighway, which is just another buzzword like
''Big Bang'' for the big crash when the stock exchange went electronic.
Highway it is not. The Internet is like a vast canal system round the

maze of off-shoots and tributaries and all interconnected. There's
plenty of traffic on it and some people know their way around it.

thousands of groups offering information on a vast range of different
topics.
To join the net, you must contact an access provider, like CompuServe
or BT Net. They link the computer to the net, for a set-up fee and
normally a monthly charge. It's best to choose a local provider because
to link in to the net, you only pay local telephone charges. Once
linked, the provider gives the user and ''E-Mail'' address to which
electronic information can be sent. From there, the user can decide what
access is needed. A simple bulletin board gives limited facilities but
does not open up the World Wide Web where organisations publish
multi-media pages. The access provider will also supply the software
program which lets the computer use the net. Once connected users can
browse bulletin boards and, with practice, connect and communicate with
other users around the globe. The system allows you to access vast
amounts of information and even download them onto the computer in a
matter of seconds for later reading.
A word of warning though. Once on the net, it's difficult to get off
again. Open one file, it leads to yet another file area which opens
doors to more and more, and yet more, information. It's easy to get lost
in the system, and as we said, it is no superhighway and everybody with
a minority obsession or point of view has an address and wants to send
their message across the web. There's a never-ending supply of
information about almost any subject under the sun. It's fun, but it
takes a while to learn one's way around.

A MURDERER has been found hanged in his cell -- hours before he was to
have been told that the Life Sentence Review Board had recommended his
release.
The 40-year-old man was found dead at Maghaberry Prison, County
Antrim, on Thursday morning. The Northern Ireland Office said that foul
play was not suspected but a police investigation was being carried out.
The man died some time between being locked up on Wednesday night and
unlocking on Thursday. He was to have been told that day about the
board's recommendation.
The man had his case considered on the same day as the jailed
paratroper, Lee Clegg. However, it is understood that Clegg has not been
told of any board recommendation yet.

ROBERT MAXWELL angrily accused directors of forming a cabal against
him when they questioned multi-million pound loans to his private
companies, an Old Bailey jury heard yesterday.
At a hastily-called board meeting to discuss the issue the media
tycoon banned anyone present from making notes or minutes. Businessman
Mr Peter Laister told the jury that was unique in his experience.
When the directors consulted outside lawyers about the position the
publisher again went into a rage and accused them of jeopardising the
share price of Maxwell Communications Corporation.
The jury was told his youngest son Kevin wrote a memo assuring the
directors that the private Maxwell companies' assets were worth three to
four times the level of loans and warning ''a house divided is a house
destroyed''.
Mr Kevin Maxwell, 36, his brother Ian, 39, and two former financial
advisers, Mr Larry Trachtenberg, 42, and Mr Robert Bunn, 47, deny
conspiracy to defraud the trustees and beneficiaries of the group's
pension funds by misusing #22m worth of shares in the Israeli company
Teva to prop up the ailing Maxwell empire after its founder's mystery
death at sea in November, 1991.
Mr Kevin Maxwell alone denies a similar charge of conspiring with his
father to misuse #100m worth of shares in another Israeli company to pay
private Maxwell company debts.
Mr Laister, who was invited by the publisher to become a non-executive
director of MCC in the mid-1980s after his retirement as chairman of
Thorn EMI, briefly became chairman of MCC after Robert Maxwell's death.
Mr Laister said that in August, 1991, he and fellow non-family
directors, including Lord Rippon, became concerned about the level of
inter-company loans between MCC and the private Maxwell firms.
It emerged that the private companies owed MCC well in excess of
#200m.
Mr Laister said the directors were concerned at the size of the loans,
the lack of proper information about them, and the fact they had not
been approved in the proper manner.
When Mr Laister met the publisher, he was very angry and ''he accused
me of leading a cabal of the directors and said that I should not have
done so and it was not a matter that warranted the action that I had
started and put in place.
''I very strongly refuted that and it led to heated words.''
Later that day, there was a hastily-called board meeting chaired by
the publisher and including his two sons to discuss the issue of the
outstanding loans.
At the meeting the directors said they were concerned about the level
of the private companies' debt to MCC and about unapproved foreign
exchange transactions totalling around #100m, which could have placed
MCC's funding at risk.
Kevin Maxwell told them the private companies' debt would soon be
reduced from the proceeds of the sale of Scitex shares -- the shares
which are now the subject of the charge he faces alone.
In the following days the non-family directors drew up a list of
changes they wanted to be incorporated in MCC but these included the
removal of Robert Maxwell's right, embodied in the company's articles,
to be the sole signatory on cheques.
He went on to say this was because as he was chairman of both the
public and private companies, there was ''clearly a conflict of
interest''.
The directors also wanted all foreign exchange dealings to be notified
to the finance director and all inter-company debts to be monitored by
the finance committee. They also required a debts repayment schedule.
When Robert Maxwell received this list of the directors' requirements
''he was extremely angry and again went over this business of a cabal''.
The publisher expressed concern that the use of outside lawyers could
lead to a leak of information which could cause ''untold damage'' to
MCC's share price.
By October Mr Laister said Kevin Maxwell told him the private
companies' debt to MCC had been reduced to zero, although this turned
out not to be accurate.
The trial was adjourned until Tuesday.

THE transfer dealings of former Liverpool and Rangers manager Graeme
Souness were yesterday given the all-clear by Rangers Football Club.
Mr Campbell Ogilvie, secretary of the Ibrox club, dismissed
allegations that Mr Souness took ''bungs'' during two transfer deals. He
said: ''The documentation is there. It is in order. This is just press
speculation.''
The claims were made in court by Mr George Carman, QC, during Mr
Souness's successful libel action against the People newspaper but were
never heard by the jury.
Mr Carman, representing the newspaper, alleged Mr Souness received
around #50,000 for transfer deals which brought Israeli internationalist
Avi Cohen and Everton defender Gary Stevens to Ibrox. He also claimed
that Inland Revenue investigators had interviewed Mr Souness's first
wife, Danielle.
The judge refused to allow the claims to be put to the jury and
therefore Mr Souness was not given the opportunity to challenge their
accuracy in court. Yesterday, however, he attacked the claims in a
statement made through his solicitors Lipkin Gorman.
He said the allegations made during the High Court case were totally
false and that ''he did not expect newspapers to take the defeat of one
of their number gracefully''.
He warned that two further libel actions concerning the ''bung''
allegations were under way. The statement said: ''Mr Souness's only
object in bringing the proceedings for libel against the People
newspaper was to correct the false picture which the newspaper painted
of him as a father and as a man.
''That object has now been achieved and Mr Souness has been fully
vindicated by the jury's award of damages against the People of
#750,000.
''Mr Souness did not expect the newspapers to take the defeat of one
of their number gracefully and that has proved to be the case.
''In this country, fortunately for private individuals, we have trial
by jury, not trial by newspaper.
''This morning, further allegations have been made against Mr Souness
in the national press. These allegations are totally false. They are not
new but are the subject of two further actions for libel which Mr
Souness has been forced to bring. He has no doubt that he will receive
further vindication from the juries which deal with those actions.''
Mr Souness's solicitor, Mr Gerard Cukier, said the latest press
reports were also being studied closely. ''We're looking at them. It is
a question of degree of reporting. They are entitled to report what
happened in court but it has got to be a true and fair picture.''
Yesterday, the Scottish Football Association confirmed that no
investigation was underway in Scotland into allegations that Mr Souness
had received secret payments. The SFA said it had received no complaints
and was not looking into the issue.

Two Scottish University teams are breaking ground in laser technology.
Their designs could revolutionise long-distance communication and
biomedical research
MANY hands make light work, says the old Chinese proverb. Two teams at
Scots Universities are making lights work better than ever before.
They're at the forefront of laser technology. In St Andrews, Dr Bruce
Sinclair and Dr Neil MacKinnon have invented a new type of miniature
laser system so small it would fit into a matchbox.
Further south, in Strathclyde University, another team led by Dr
Walter Johnstone and Dr Kevin McCallion, have developed a type of
''tuneable'' fibre-optic laser which has just won a Department of Trade
SMART award of #45,000.
The St Andrews development is a significant advance in laser
production and is almost certain to be a money spinner in bio-medical
research, printing and silicon chip technology. Dr Sinclair and Dr
MacKinnon have designed a laser that is simple to mass produce and gives
a powerful beam at very low power.
Powered by a diode laser like the one used in a CD player, the beam
generates a ''microchip'' laser to produce an infra-red beam which is
reflected back and forth through a crystal which converts the infra-red
light to green laser which makes it visible.
While there are a wide range of lasers around, the St Andrews
microchip beam is unique in producing coherent light in a small package.
It is 100 times more powerful than conventional red laser pointers and
the different, much finer wavelength opens up a whole new range of
applications.
Dr Sinclair said: ''This is a low-powered laser which produces a
visible beam which as potential for reprographics. The beam can be used
to etch on printing plates.
''In biomedical research, a fine visible beam is needed for cell
counting and sorting and even labelling cells with a particular chemical
or drug. In the semi-conductor industry it could be used for wafer
inspection at high speed. There are many possibilities. The advantage of
this new laser is that it is solid-state rather than gas-powered which
enables us to make it so small.''
In Strathclyde, Dr Johnstone and Dr McCallion have developed a novel
electronic tuning device for optical fibre lasers which they believe is
the key to widespread commercial exploitation of the technology.
Most of the world's long distance communication is done by laser
pulses carried on glass fibres thinner than a human hair, but the
messages need to be amplified every 50km or so. That amplification has
been used to create glass fibre lasers, but until now the commercial
development has been hindered by the lack of a cheap and simple
component to tune the wavelength of the beam.
The Strathclyde team has devised a new range of wavelength selectors
which is formed directly on the wire which are electronically tuneable
and have no moving parts. This allows an infinite variety of wavelengths
to be selected. Sounds complex, and of course it is, but basically the
application is a revolutionary advance in the telecommunications
business and more besides.
A ''tuneable'' laser will multiply dramatically the amount of
different messages transmitted down one fibre-optic cable which will
probably also be a huge boost to the already burgeoning world-wide web
system.
Walter Johnstone, however, who has now co-founded a new company called
OptoSci to develop the system, said that a variable wavelength laser
holds the promise of an important application in gas and chemical
sensing. Since gas absorbs light at a specific wavelength, a variable
beam could be used for instant gas and chemical sensing. In other words,
it could immediately identify toxic gases like carbon monoxide in an
enclosed space.
The St Andrews team has won a grant of #127,000 from the Engineering
and Physical Sciences Research Council to take its advances further,
while the Strathclyde laser has the #45,000 Small Manufacturer Award for
research and technology, giving both the opportunity to use laser beams
to put their names in lights.

A SHELL filling station in Hamburg was firebombed yesterday in protest
against the planned dumping of the Brent Spar in the Atlantic. The
attackers threw petrol bombs into the sales room, which was gutted, and
sprayed ''Don't sink the oil platform'' on the wall.
The station was unstaffed at the time and firefighters prevented the
flames reaching the petrol pumps and causing a major explosion.
German environmentalists and politicians across the spectrum have
united to protest against the dumping at sea by the Royal Dutch/Shell
group of the rig, which they say contains hundreds of tonnes of toxic
chemicals.
Ecologists and churches have already hit Shell petrol sales in
Germany with calls for a boycott. Chancellor Helmut Kohl has said he
will raise the matter at a summit of the Group of Seven industrial
powers in Halifax, Canada.--Reuter.

Halifax, Nova Scotia
GERMANY'S anger at the proposed deep-sea sinking of the Brent Spar oil
platform was turned on the British Government at the G7 summit last
night.
There was a sharp exchange between Ministers and a personal appeal to
the Premier John Major from Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
At a meeting of the Group of Seven Finance Ministers, Germany's Theo
Waigel attacked Treasury Minister Anthony Nelson for the Government's
refusal to block the disposal of Shell's installation.
His outburst was followed by an impromptu encounter between Mr Major
and Dr Kohl at the conclusion of the G7 leaders' plenary session, during
which the Chancellor expressed his concerns at Shell's plans for Brent
Spar.
A British source said the discussion, which had earlier been ruled out
by German officials, lasted five minutes. Mr Major had listened
''politely'' but made clear the Government's belief that the sinking of
the Brent Spar was the ''best practicable environmental option'' and was
fully in line with Britain's environmental commitments.
Earlier, in a confrontation that reportedly left Mr Nelson ''shaken''
according to summit sources, Mr Waigel said: ''What's the point of
having meetings about the environment when something like this
happens?''
Shell's decision to tow the disused platform from the North Sea to the
north Atlantic and sink it in 2000 metres of water has sparked furious
reactions in Germany, where environmentalists have called for a boycott
of Shell products and a Shell petrol station was firebombed.
Taking Mr Nelson aside at the plenary session of Ministers who had
gathered to discuss reforming international financial institutions, Mr
Waigel told him: ''There are 50 oil rigs from the Gulf of Mexico which
have been disposed of on land. If they can do it like that there why
can't it happen in Europe?''
Last night, the Government said it saw no need to change its position
on Shell's action. On Thursday, Mr Major said he was willing to discuss
the matter with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl but insisted that the
disposal was in accordance with international regulations.
Environmentalists claim that Brent Spar contains chemical and
radioactive waste which will seep out when it is sunk. Greenpeace wants
the rig to be dismantled on land.
Shell in Germany has admitted embarrassment at its British
counterpart's plans. Yesterday, the corporation's Dutch headquarters
indicated that it would be prepared to submit its plans to the scrutiny
of independent scientists.
Mr Major played down his encounter with Dr Kohl and said: ''Even the
best of friends disagree.''
He emphasised that the rig would be dismantled ''in accordance with
safety and logic''. He added: ''To try and bring something of that size
inshore with the danger of it breaking up might be a greater
environmental danger.''
Yesterday, Shell said it might delay the sinking to explain why it was
needed but would not drop its plan.
The British unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group issued a statement in
Hamburg saying: ''Shell UK remains convinced that the sinking in the
deep Atlantic is the most responsible way of disposing of the Brent
Spar.
''It is clearly important that we should take time to more fully brief
all concerned of the reasons for our decision in the hope that . . .
those governments and organisations which have criticised the disposal
so forcefully will again consider objectively the circumstances of this
particular case.''
Mr Peter Duncan, the chief executive of Shell Germany, said this would
involve ''a certain delay'' but declined to say if this meant days or
weeks.
Mr Duncan said critics were unfairly attacking Shell without knowing
the facts. He also appealed for rational discourse and an end to violent
protests and bomb threats.
''Let us return to a factual discussion of the Brent Spar problem,''
he said. ''Things cannot go on this way.''
Greenpeace said volunteers were distributing leaflets at 250 Shell
stations in Germany encouraging motorists to think about filling up
elsewhere and to send protest cards to the company.
Shell's German sales have fallen 10% to 20% this week after boycott
calls, said Manfred Genske, a Hamburg dealer, on behalf of Shell station
operators. Some fuel stations had seen up to half their sales dry up.
Mr Duncan said: ''The short-term impact on the business is as serious
as anything that has happened in the recordable history of this
company.''
Meanwhile, one of Shell's main offshore contractors yesterday broke
ranks with the oil giant and said the Brent Spar should not be dumped in
the ocean.
According to a Greenpeace translation of a Dutch language press
release from Heeremac, a consortium involving the Dutch firm Heerema and
the American company McDermott, the contractors said: ''In our opinion,
the buoy should be towed in a vertical position whereby, for example,
the radioactive waste could be dealt with in a responsible manner.
''There are no environmental, safety, or economic reasons not to tow
this old platform ashore,'' they said.
Heeremac agreed with Shell that dismantling on shore was four times as
expensive as the dumping at sea but said they ''did not recognise''
their own bid in the figures Shell had published for onshore disposal.
They said they bid #19m to do the job, less than half Shell's reported
estimate.

CLOSED circuit television cameras will eventually make the centre of
Glasgow a completely inhospitable place for the criminal and the
hooligan, Strathclyde Chief Constable Leslie Sharp forecast yesterday.
Addressing businessmen with the aim of raising more contributions
towards the running cost of the cameras, Mr Sharp reported a dramatic
fall in all crime in the city centre of 20% in the first six months of
the cameras' operation. However, he said, lawyers were now trying to
devise means of challenging the video evidence in court to get their
clients off.
Commercial housebreaking is down by half, car theft by 39%, breach of
the peace by 19%, petty assault by 18%, shoplifting by 10%, and
vandalism by 6%.
On top of that, store operators who were present as Mr Sharp was
giving the figures reported that losses from shoplifting were continuing
to decline, sales and profits were rising, and liaison between store
detective staff and the police had improved enormously.
The CityWatch Association is trying to attract a further #70,000 of
private sponsorship for the scheme. Mr Mario Cocozza, CityWatch
chairman, said: ''The system is successful but we need additional funds
for running costs for the rest of this year.
''I would urge other major retailers who are benefiting to take a
financial stake now. We wanted to have some results to place before them
to encourage shopkeepers and business people to contribute.''
Video footage from the 32 cameras showed the arrest of two youths
captured on camera while breaking into a shop in Sauchiehall Street,
police arresting a youth robbing another by threatening him with a
hypodermic syringe, and an elderly drunk man kicking in a plate-glass
door in the city centre.
Mr Sharp said that in practically every case where a defendant was
shown the videotape a guilty plea followed but defence agents were
actively examining ways of challenging the video evidence.
The chief constable also reported that there had been no direct
complaints from members of the public on civil liberties issues
surrounding the cameras. A number of articles had appeared in newspapers
in the name of the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties but that was
all.
While there had been pressure for national guidelines, those laid down
locally appeared to be working. There were now 17 CCTV schemes in
Strathclyde in various states of completion.
Crime in Strathclyde was going down as a result of the genuine
corporate approach giving a new confidence that something could be done.
The city was moving towards a genuine ''feel-good factor''.
CCTV on the streets was needed because crime was still too high,
however, and no-one should be in any doubt that CCTV did make a
noticeable difference. The police benefited because they now saw
offences and incidents occurring before they were reported to them.
''We have actually captured murders on camera and their deterrent
effect is self-evident,'' he said.
In addition, the general public were benefiting and the business
community was receiving substantial benefit from increased custom and
lower overheads.

THE British Railways Board finally bowed to the weight of Scottish
popular and political pressure yesterday, conceding that two court
rulings have ensured a reprieve for the Fort William sleeper service
until the end of the summer at least.
The board will announce next week whether it is to appeal against
these court rulings to the House of Lords, begin formal public
consultation on the service's withdrawal, or push to retain the service
permanently.
ScotRail director John Ellis said after the meeting: ''This decision
provides security for the whole of the summer period, which is something
that was pressed for in particular. The future of the service is a
national issue and the board will need time to consider the financial,
legal, and operational implications in some detail, before announcing
its final decision.''
The Liberal Democrat MP for Ross, Cromarty and Skye, Mr Charles
Kennedy, called on Director of Rail Franchising Roger Salmon to give BR
and ScotRail the appropriate subsidy to run the service through the
summer.
A spokesman for Mr Salmon said, however: ''It will be up to BR and
ScotRail to find the money from within their own budgets. The franchise
office will not be paying any subsidies to anybody until the turn of the
year, when the first franchises come into operation.''
The Shadow Transport Minister Mr Henry McLeish said: ''Mr Salmon is
the man that should be in the dock. It was his decision on December 14
that started all this, and he has now got to face up to his
responsibilities. Charles Kennedy, Margaret Ewing, and myself will be
going to see him as soon as possible.''
The Herald disclosed last Saturday that ScotRail was operating a
limited booking service for the sleeper. Highland Regional Council,
whose two earlier court actions had prevented the service's immediate
withdrawal, had threatened further action unless the booking service
were restored.
Meanwhile, in a separate legal action in its campaign to ensure the
sleeper service survives beyond privatisation, the council returned to
the Court of Session in Edinburgh, yesterday.
It is seeking an interim interdict to prevent Mr Salmon from carrying
on with the consultation process until he informs it of the criteria he
is using to evaluate the benefits of maintaining loss-making services in
the Highlands.
Lord Hamilton allowed the region's petition to be served on the
franchising director, who is expected to lodge answers by next Thursday.
That would enable a hearing on the interdict to take place on Friday.
A copy of the petition will also be served on Transport Secretary Dr
Brian Mawhinney, although the region is not seeking an interdict against
him.
Mr Andrew Hajducki, QC, counsel for Highland region, told the court
that there was some urgency to have the case heard because the
consultation process was due to end on July 12.
The council will argue that Mr Salmon acted irrationally in preparing
the consultation draft of the rail passenger requirement for ScotRail,
without first having developed a means of judging the basis for doing
so. The consultation draft was issued last month.
The region points out that, in March last year, the Transport
Secretary issued a document entitled Objectives, Instruction and
Guidance for the Franchising Director.
It stated: ''In order for you to decide appropriate service
specifications for loss-making services, you will need to develop
criteria which will enable you to evaluate the benefits to be obtained
from their provision.''
Highland points out that all passenger rail services within its area
are loss-making, and that, to receive Government financial support, such
services must be included in the franchising director's passenger
service requirement.
The services set out in Mr Salmon's consultation draft are, in many
respects, the same as operated by ScotRail since October 1994, but there
are significant differences.
In particular, the Fort William to London Euston sleeper is not
included and there are cuts in services between Inverness and Wick, and
Inverness and Tain. The summer Glasgow to Fort William service is also
reduced by one train per day.
The region's director of law and administration has requested copies
of the criteria used by the franchising director to enable him to
evaluate the benefits of loss-making services, but Highland says the
information has not been forthcoming.
The council says that if Mr Salmon can get away with simply
reproducing the current timetable without further consideration, the
consultation process is an empty exercise.
It argues that it has a ''legitimate expectation'' that he will engage
in a fair consultation exercise over the pattern and quality of services
to be provided in the region through franchising.
Highland says that fair consultation involves providing adequate
information to which it can respond, and claims that Mr Salmon is in
breach of his obligation to consult.
It is seeking judicial review of his decision to axe the service
without first developing criteria as required for loss-making services
under the 1993 Railways Act.
The convener of Highland Regional Council, Mr Duncan McPherson,
yesterday welcomed the board's decision that the sleeper service would
run throughout the duration of the summer timetable, until September 22,
at the very least.

THE funding crisis in higher education was brought into sharp focus
last night when the head of one of Scotland's leading art colleges
raised the spectre of charging students top-up fees to balance its
books.
Professor Alistair Rowan, principal of the Edinburgh College of Art,
said higher education under-funding left the institution with a stark
choice: ''Pay off the teaching staff at a time when the number of
students is rising, or charge those students extra fees.''
Glasgow School of Art, the other separately-funded, independent art
college in Scotland, is expected to seek about four voluntary
redundancies among lecturers to offset the impact of funding cuts.
Professor Rowan said that, by next year, the amount Edinburgh College
of Art received for teaching each student would have fallen by nearly 9%
compared with funding levels from the Government in 1990.
Warning of a looming financial crisis, he said that in the current and
next financial year revenue would cease to meet expenditure and
management would have to close the gap in funding.
''Student numbers will continue growing. The teaching staff cannot. It
can only be reduced by imposing early retirement or by creating
redundancies,'' he said.
Since the college was already very ''lean'' in its staffing levels,
the only alternative was to charge top-up fees.
Top-up fees, involving institutions charging students higher fees than
those paid from public funds, have been widely resisted as an
alternative source of income because securing a place on a course would
be based on ability to pay after meeting academic entrance requirements.
Higher education would become more like a free market, with the
emergence of high-quality, high-price institutions and lower-quality,
lower-price ones.
Edinburgh College of Art could probably charge top-up fees because it
is a high-demand institution but it is not something it would do by
choice.
Professor Rowan blamed the Government and the Scottish Higher
Education Funding Council, which disburses public money to higher
education institutions, for the crisis.
Art colleges were particularly exposed because they did not benefit
from big research contracts. The Edinburgh college depended on the
council for 84% of its funding.
Meanwhile, students and staff of St Andrew's College in Glasgow,
Scotland's Roman Catholic teacher-training institution, have written to
MPs to highlight the threat to the college, which plans to make nearly
30 lecturers and more than 20 support workers redundant to make up for
funding cuts.

A LABOUR government setting up a Parliament in Edinburgh would have to
cut the number of Scottish MPs at Westminster or face a more swingeing
reduction when the Tories returned to power, it was claimed yesterday.
Professor James Mitchell, of Strathclyde University, also told a
seminar on devolution in Wales that Labour's proposals still lacked
detail and, if pushed through within the promised timescale, would be
drafted by Whitehall mandarins, making them much less radical than
promised. Having built up expectations, any failure to deliver would
pose problems for Labour, he said.
With Tories likely to resist home rule tooth and nail, encouraging any
English rebels in Labour ranks, Professor Mitchell concluded: ''John
Major's difficulties with the Maastricht Treaty are probably going to be
nothing as compared to Tony Blair's with Scottish devolution.''
Professor Mitchell, who teaches politics in Strathclyde's department
of government, said the SNP posed more of a threat to Labour than at any
time in the past.
Although the SNP vote fell from 30% in 1974 to 21.5% at the last
election, it was the second choice of 48% of Labour supporters in 1992,
compared to only 26% in 1979. ''The parties look and sound more similar
and, if anything, Labour looks more threatened,'' he said.
In spite of claims to the contrary, Labour is likely to continue to
rely on Scottish and Welsh MPs if it is to form a Government, making for
a simple choice. ''Either it reduces its Scottish and Welsh
representation or a future incoming Conservative government would choose
to reduce the number by a greater amount,'' said Professor Mitchell.
''Refusing to reduce the number of Scottish MPs is not an option.
Prevaricating may be an option but it could prove costly.''
He said that in 1918 Scotland had a number of MPs in proportion to its
population. After 1922, Scottish Parliamentary representation had grown
steadily more generous but had only come into question again in the last
25 years.
The current numbers of MPs (with the amount due on a population basis
in brackets) is at present England 529 (549), Scotland 72 (59), Wales 40
(33), and Northern Ireland 18 (18).
When Stormont was created in the 1920s, the quid pro quo was a cut in
the number of Northern Ireland MPs at Westminster to two-thirds of its
population entitlement. Such a formula would reduce the number of
Scottish MPs at Westminster to 40, which would be in breach of the
provision for a minimum of 45 in the Act of Union.

KATHRYN Harrison binds her novel to the life of a silkworm. The main
character, Francisca de Luarca, is the daughter of a silk grower, a
dreamer who tells us that by spinning stories she learned to be a worm.
''From leaves the worms spun silk'' she says, ''and I apprenticed myself
to them. I found a way to transform the life I was given into another
life, one that was fantastic, unexpected.''
She was a small child whose tales frightened her sister. Her father
risked everything for the sake of his dreams; he was like Quixote and
she is like her father. He continually sought to improve the
manufacture, dreamed of worms producing coloured silk, and tried to
combat his own father's superstitions with science. Her grandfather's
resistance and her father's beligerance ruined the family. Her father
burned the old mulberry trees to try a new strain. The worms initially
seemed to respond, then they failed. God had been good. It was a sin to
want more than they had been given.
Francisca has been tortured and imprisoned during the Spanish
Inquisition because of her love for a priest. Her lover is dead, yet
still they gather evidence against him. Her gift for manufacturing
fables makes prison bearable; and she reasons anything would be better
than the life of her queen, Marie Louise de Bourbon, who is the same age
as herself, married to the impotent King Carlos II while the nation
demands a male heir.
The queen's imagined sufferings are woven with her own. Marie Louise
dresses in silk. She wears the work of a hundred thousand worms, while
sorcery is blamed for her childlessness. Witches are hunted, tortured
and burned in every town. Francisca contrasts the memories of her own
lovemaking with the queen's hopeless condition and the energies of the
church and state to rid the palace of its curse.
Fiction has become reality, and its effect on those who find their
lives governed by political consequences are shown in the varying forms
of torture they have to endure. When monarchy and religion are the only
truths, and refusing to believe in them -- or daring to question their
absolute power -- becomes heresy, then the consequences are dangerous
and damning.
Kathryn Harrison is not completely convincing. Are we to believe
Francisca's love for the priest, or are we being manipulated and
deceived in the same way as those who believe in the pronouncements of
the Inquisitors or the virility of their shambling, ugly monarch? And
once we question the very essence of Francisca's being, what other
doubts come into play, what other fictions become truths? Selectivity is
the essence of fiction. In order to believe in Francisca we must know
what has been omitted, we have to learn her choices, hear another voice,
find another point of view.
Which is to demand another novel, for it is Francisca's reasonable
voice that gives the narrative its power and drive. She imagines the
court intrigues, experiences and hears others tell the horrors of the
Inquisition, relating these accounts in a matter of fact way that adds
to their poignancy and depth. Everything is connected to the art of silk
weaving. An essential part of the silk making process is that worms are
killed before they become moths, otherwise they would destroy the
finished silk.
Kathryn Harrison is American; and throughout the text she continually
reminds us that seventeenth-century Spain saw the New World as ''the
land of another chance.'' This was where they could start again, where
they could learn from the mistakes which were implicit in their desire.
The results of this flawed dream are obvious, though never stated; the
old fictions remained, and their consequences resound throughout this
text like the sound of silkworms chewing, which, we are told, is like
rain on a roof.

DID we ever guess, way back when, as we sprawled on the floor in
badly-lit, ill-furnished rooms, smoking, drinking and putting the world
right to the sound of Leonard Cohen, that 30 years later someone might
have written an academic thesis about the man, poet, singer and
songwriter? Could we have dreamed that of all the 1960s music, of all
those albums we played so endlessly, that it was to be Leonard who would
prove to be the great survivor? Leonard Cohen whose songs, based only on
three or four chords, that we mocked even then as performing ''music to
commit suicide to'' or ''songs to slash your wrists to''. Leonard Cohen
to whom it was impossible to listen to when the sun was shining.
To think that after all these years anyone is remotely interested in
him? Or that he would still be singing? At 60 years old! But then
Leonard Cohen has had a revival that few could have predicted and which
he probably describes best himself. In Tower of Song from the album I'm
Your Man, released in 1988, there are what his biographer describes in
this book as two classic Cohen statements. The first is the opening
refrain: ''Well, my friends are gone and my hair is grey. I ache in the
places where I used to play. And I'm crazy for love but I'm not coming
on. I'm just paying my rent every day in the Tower of Song.''
The other is the line: ''I was born like this, I had no choice. I was
born with the gift of a golden voice.''
Ira Nadel describes this last one as a ''seriocomic line'' and here we
reach the problem about this publishing exercise. I picked up the book
fascinated to learn all that I had never known about Leonard. Who was
Suzanne? What happened to Marianne that occasioned their miserable
farewell? Who were the Sisters of Mercy who sweetened his (and our)
nights? Most of all, now that he is so big in places like Norway, is he
happy?
Unfortunately, Mr Nadel is rather seriocomic himself. He submits
Cohen's life and lines to such serious analysis as to have a mildly
comic effect -- which is to say, quickly, that this is not a funny book,
but that Nadel is so terribly serious that his philosophical analysis of
the minutiae of Cohen's life in art becomes risible.
The fly-leaf description provides the clue. Ira Nadel, it says ''has
published a variety of essays on Leonard Cohen's music and literary
works, including a paper presented at the first academic conference on
Leonard Cohen, held in Canada, where he also founded ''Beautiful
Losers'', a society to further the appreciation of Leonard Cohen
worldwide.''
You will deduce from this that Mr Nadel has not written a
dispassionate work here.
And that is precisely the problem. I suspect it is a Canadian one. Mr
Nadel is obviously, like Cohen, also a Canadian and has approached his
topic in a rather, well, Canadian fashion: analytical, humourless,
precise and academic. This is fine if you want to present academic
papers on the life and literary influences of Leonard Cohen, but who
wants to read that? We are dealing here with a folk singing,
song-writing poet who has made a generation weep for its lost innocence,
and yet who still managed the extraordinary feat of finding a means to
transfer his music and his message into the popular culture of a
subsequent generation. There are not many who have done that. And if I
was in the biography business I would start writing a decent one now
about Leonard Cohen. There are a lot of people like me out there who are
interested in the man but, alas, I have to advise them most strongly not
to buy this book. If you want it for the academic references borrow it
from the library.

Values, Visions and Voices
Gordon Brown and Tony Wright, editors. VALUES, VISIONS AND VOICES: AN
ANTHOLOGY OF SOCIALISM. Mainstream, #14.99 (pp256)
SNOWY in Alan Bleasdale's Boys from the Blackstuff (1983) said of
socialism: ''It was easy to be a socialist when I was growin' up in the
sixties, an' even f' most of the seventies. Everyone was a friggin'
socialist then. It was fashionable. But it's not now.''
Before Maggie Thatcher gave it a bad name, socialism was generally
regarded as A Good Thing. ''We are all socialists now,'' said English
Liberal statesman Sir William Harcourt in 1894, and for some time we --
if you'll pardon the Thatcherite plural -- believed society could do
better, all things being equal. Along came Maggie to declare ''There is
no such thing as Society,'' to savage socialism, to assess the Good
Samaritan as cash-conscious, and millions of voters believed in her
vision of a world where only money matters.
Socialism, according to this anthology, values morals more than money.
Socialism is defined as ''a matter of moral choice'' by editors making
the choice to socialise with the likes of the late John Smith who wrote
in 1993: ''Let me assert my profound conviction that politics ought to
be a moral activity and we should never feel inhibited in stressing the
moral basis of our approach.'' Choosing Smith they are accepting Clause
Four of the Socialist Ten Commandments of 1920: ''Honour good men''.
It would be unfair to genuine good guys Gordon Brown and Tony Wright
to suggest the adjective ''vague'' should have been inserted in the
alliterative title of an anthology willing to claim, in the name of
socialism, any writer with a good word to say about the humane running
of the human race. Unfair but understandable. Brown and Wright recruit,
to the salvation army of socialism, old souls such as Sir Thomas More,
with his utopianism; Swift, with his humorous horse sense; Blake, with
his Swedenborgian symbolism; Tom Paine, with his dubious doctrine of
natural rights; Burns, with his freemasonic fraternalism; Shelley, with
his anarchism; Wordsworth, with his pantheism; D H Lawrence, with his
sneering anti-snobbism. They are all socialists now.
For an author to be filed by Brown and Wright in the ranks of
socialism it is necessary for him, or her, to be admired by a luminary
of the Left: the editors thank Tony Blair and colleagues for suggesting
items for inclusion. Arranged to illustrate the ideals of New Labour,
the anthology is committed to what the editors call the party's
essential purpose -- ''to stop people being ripped off or pushed around
and to enable everyone to get the chance of a decent life.'' Not as
eloquent as Clause Four but noble enough for New Labour.
Old Labour is remembered as A Good Thing of the past when it sounds
like New Labour. We have Ramsay Mac on the importance of ''moral
qualities'', Nye Bevan accepting ''all forms of private property are not
necessarily evil'', Michael Foot on the decency of democratic socialism.
New Labour is happy to go back to The Future of Socialism as seen by
Tony Crosland in 1956: ''Our society will look quite different when we
have carried through the changes mentioned earlier; and the whole
argument will then need to be restated, and thought out afresh, by a
younger generation than mine.'' The changes mentioned earlier by
Crosland were emphatically moral changes treasured by the Labour
generation of Blair and Brown and Wright.
Crosland's generation has Hugh Gaitskell on the march against the
Marxism he felt contaminated Labour's constitution. Gaitskell fought,
fought, and fought again for the Labour Party he loved as a moral
crusade against communism as well as capitalism: ''For at rock-bottom
(my) socialism is based on a respect for the individual human
personality which is derided and scorned in a fascist or communist
dictatorship. But if this be accepted, then it is also essential to
understand the implications of political democracy for socialist
policy.'' Gaitskell wanted a classless society and a socialism without
Clause Four. Once ridiculed by socialist militants he is now revered by
socialist moralists.
On the copyright page of this book we are told: ''The moral right of
the authors has been asserted''. Should have been the moral left for
authors as self-righteous as Neil Kinnock: ''Why am I the first Kinnock
in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?'' Or Glenda
Jackson: ''I am a product of the welfare state . . . and 40 years later
I stand here addressing conference''. Socialism stands for more than
triumphalism, as Labour lamented after the last General Election, so New
Labour could afford to lose some recent prophets.
Some excellent bits and pieces chosen by Brown and Wright -- or Blair
or other advisers -- are by old stagers rather than modern platform
performers. Wilde speculated optimistically on the soul of man under
socialism: ''It will have wisdom. Its value will not be measured by
material things.'' And Shaw is as relevant today as he was in coming to
terms with his time in 1928: ''Such poverty as we have today in all our
great cities degrades the poor, and infects with its degradation the
whole neighbourhood in which they live.''
There are classic statements of the case for socialism by William
Morris (''Socialism aims . . . at realising equality of condition as its
economic goal''), Edward Carpenter (''the old ideals of society have
become corrupt, and . . . this corruption has resulted in dishonesty of
life''), R H Tawney (''it is the mark of a civilised society to aim at
eliminating such inequalities as have their source . . . in its own
organisation'') and they all look forward to a future in which the Left
asserts its moral rights.
The editors assert the moral rights of New Labour by bringing moral
writers to the aid of the Party. Brown and Wright have put together
their good book by representing writers preaching to the converted.

<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday rejected Government claims it was trying to ''turn
the clock back on the NHS'' after reports that it planned to scrap trust
hospitals and GP fundholders.
A row over the party's health policy was sparked after leaked reports
claimed it wanted to overhaul the controversial NHS reforms and return
the service to a single organisation.
Shadow Health Secretary Mrs Margaret Beckett said: ''Virginia
Bottomley (the Health Secretary) has been wrong-footed. She is desperate
to say we have turned the clock back on the NHS, when we will do nothing
of the sort.
''She wants to pretend there will be major upheaval when what Labour
proposes is sensible reform.''
Labour believed it could create a new NHS for a new century, Mrs
Beckett said, but it was not possible to go back to the pre-1990 NHS
because it no longer existed.
According to one report, Labour wants the service working at national
and local levels with shared targets. Buildings, equipment, and land
will belong to the nation and staff will work once more for a national,
integrated service.
By replacing competition with co-operation, it claims the public
service values of the health service will be restored.
However the shake-up -- due to be published on July 3 -- was attacked
by Mrs Bottomley as ''very bad news for patients.
1 ''She (Mrs Beckett) has instead pushed ahead with proposals which
combine all the worst elements of old Labour socialism and new Labour
fudge. These ideas won't wash and they won't work.''
Liberal Democrat spokesman Mr Alex Carlile claimed Labour's plans had
caused confusion and urged it to spell out the details of its proposals.
He said that while the document spoke of abolishing GP fundholding and
altering the status of the NHS trusts, the content still maintained a
commissioner-provider divide, independence for trusts, and freedom for
GPs on their budgets.

A MAN and a woman were killed and another man seriously injured when a
light aircraft crashed at an airfield yesterday afternoon.
The four-seater aircraft, owned by a syndicate, crashed on farmland
about 500 yards from the runway at Dunkeswell in Devon.
The injured man, who is in his 50s, was trapped in the single-engined
French-built Rallye plane and had to be cut free.
He was taken by air ambulance to the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital
where he was said to be seriously injured and in a critical condition
last night.
Civil Aviation Authority investigators were called to the scene which
was cordoned off by Devon police.
Meanwhile a student pilot and his instructor walked away from their
aircraft unhurt yesterday after it crashed into a field.
The two-seater light aircraft was taking off from an airfield at
Turweston, near Brackley, Buckinghamshire, when it went out of control
and smashed through a fence. A Thames Valley Police spokesman said:
''The student lost control and crashed.''

CABINET right-winger Michael Portillo, during a visit to Scotland
yesterday, brushed off talk of a leadership challenge, claiming the
Prime Minister would stand on his record and win.
The Employment Secretary, who was barracked by protesters as he
arrived to open a Jobcentre at Dalkeith, Midlothian, had himself been in
the headlines as a potential challenger, but he dismissed this.
''I am not going to talk about a contest,'' he told The Herald.
''I am getting impatient about talk of a contest. We have a Prime
Minister who is going to continue in office. We don't know whether the
back benchers will mount a challenge or not, but even if they do, he
will see it off.''
Asked what would happen should Mr Major fail, or lose the will to
continue the fight, Mr Portillo replied: ''I don't contemplate that
happening. The Prime Minister is determined to stand by his record and
defend it, continue in office and, if necessary, see off any
challenge.''
Mr Portillo's name had appeared in London newspapers yesterday as a
contender for the leadership, and he was reported as having rebuffed a
suggestion that he would give Mr Michael Heseltine a clear run should Mr
Major choose to stand down, or be forced from office in a challenge.
He deflected talk from the leadership issue by turning his attack on
Labour, and dismissing demands in Scotland for constitutional change.
''We are obviously in a fevered sort of atmosphere, and it is our job
to calm that atmosphere down and remind the Conservative Party that our
political enemy is the Labour Party, and it offers us many opportunities
for attack, which we will take.''
He told The Herald: ''I do believe the people of Scotland will not be
impressed by a Labour Party which is prepared to play games with the
unity of the UK because it is scared by the Scottish Nationalists, nor
by a Labour Party which is prepared to surrender our veto to Brussels
and allow decisions of vital national interest to be taken by majority
voting.
''I don't think by-election results show you anything very much except
that governments are generally unpopular. But governments put to the
people at the end of their term in office their achievements over the
period, and their hopes for the future.
''Our hope is for a United Kingdom which preserves its sovereignty,
which I believe conforms to the vast majority of the people.
''I think we should always listen to all the people of the UK, and we
will do so.''
Mr Portillo highlighted the Government's achievement in steadily
bringing down unemployment, a stand which did not impress a group of
unemployed workers who were protesting, nor local Labour MP Eric Clarke,
who claimed the new Jobseekers Allowance Bill was a trap for applicants.
He said they were ordered to fill in a form declaring their target for
accepting a job, and if they set their sights too high they were
disbarred from unemployment benefit.
There was a similar claim from Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Jim
Wallace, who said more people were making greater efforts to find work.
He said: ''Instead of devoting its energies to forcing through
draconian measures to punish the unemployed, as in the Jobseekers Bill,
and limiting itself to creating low skill, part-time work, the
Government should invest in creating long-term, high-skill jobs that
Scotland so badly needs.''
Later, Mr Portillo went on to a lunch with businessmen where he
ridiculed the claims of new Labour to be the party of business, stating
there was no substance to back the soundbites.
''Tony Blair has promised a Labour Government would commit Britain to
the Social Chapter. That would mean higher costs for business and would
lead to the loss of thousands of British jobs,'' he said.
Education Secretary Gillian Shephard gave a similar message to a
businessmen's dinner in Banchory, Deeside, last night, attacking the
SNP's claims for independence in Europe, which she said would leave
Scotland with a ''tiny, marginalised role.''
Meanwhile, the leader of the Liberal Democrats yesterday said that Mr
Tony Blair's ''sheer timidity'' could reduce a Labour government to
little more than an interlude, paving the way for Mr Portillo to take
the Tories back to No 10.
In his first speech since stating that his party would not back a
minority Conservative administration, Mr Paddy Ashdown warned that
Labour's ''vague promises and woolly words'' might win an election, but
would soon lead to disillusion and despair, and, as in the US, a
refurbished right, vigorous in its extremism, would be waiting in the
wings.

FRIENDS of Spike Lee -- a small and select cinematic club for which
the principal membership qualification required is a lot of patience --
should know better by now than to expect their main man to make the same
film twice. Six full-length features into his career, he's wrapped his
prickly but prodigious talents around genres as diverse as the sex
comedy (She's Gotta Have It), the hard-line black ghetto melo (Do The
Right Thing), the college musical romance (Jungle Fever), and the
historical biopic (Malcolm X) with varying degrees of success, but
always in a sassy, audacious, and immediately recognisable personal
style that marks him out as the first true black auteur director in
Hollywood.
His pictures, to borrow a word from the least appropriate cultural
source possible, have chutzpah -- a kind of bare-faced cheek best
exemplified by the guy who topped his parents and then asked the judge
for clemency on account of being an orphan -- and none has it more than
his most recent work, Crooklyn (rental, cert 12), though this time more
for its subject than its style. Unpredictable as ever, he's largely
abandoned the barbed racial polemics that were the only thing his
previous films had in common to make a schwartzer equivalent of Woody
Allen's Radio Days, a wry autobiographical ramble through growing up in
black Brooklyn in the 1960s and early 1970s.
Light of heart and of touch -- at least until trouble of the kind
suggested by the title breaks out in the oddly incongruous final reel --
this is an marvellously affectionate, scruffy, and easy-going
family-life movie in which nothing much happens but you wish it would
keep on happening. Young Spike and his brothers and sister and his
parents (respectable momma Alfre Woodward, disreputable dad Delroy
Lindo) argue and wisecrack their way through the proceedings like some
raffish, streetwise black version of the Brady Bunch, echoed by a
wittily chosen selection of funk and soul classics that could have made
the best soundtrack album since Pulp Fiction.
It's Lee's least commercially successful film so far, but -- in Couch
Potato's thousand eyes, anyway -- his best and most convincing. For once
you don't feel that he's constantly copping an attitude to shock the
white folks, and paradoxically the sheer ordinariness of it all is
implicitly more subversive and radical than anything else he's done.
Crooklyn is one from the heart.
Talking of radical and subversive, Couch Potato's always counted
Stuart Rosenberg's 1967 chain-gang classic Cool Hand Luke (retail,
Warner Elite, #9.99, cert 15) as being far more of both than any of its
long-haired counter-culture contemporaries like Easy Rider and Zabriskie
Point. We're glad to see it out on video again, if again is the right
word.
Paul Newman gets the role of his life as Luke, a gentle but tragically
incorrigible white-trash anarchist jailed somewhere in darkest Dixieland
for a series of offences culminating in the decapitation of several
parking meters. Once on the chain gang, his blithe bad attitude inspires
his fellow cons (including Oscar-winning George Kennedy) to increasing
insubordination and his jailers (including J D Cannon, in a performance
of magnificent menace) to savage cruelty.
It could all have been a coarse and unrealistic prison comedy-drama of
the Mean Machine school, but the understated, unpredictable script and
three great central performances raise it to the level of tragedy. Some
critics have seen Cool Hand Luke as a Christ allegory, and Couch Potato
isn't much inclined to disagree.

THEY were dancing in the streets of Auchterturra last night -- there
was free beer at the Glaikit Stirk pub -- with the news that those three
local loons who call themselves Scotland The What? have been awarded the
MBE in the Honours List.
Mind you, an invitation to Buckingham Palace is no more than the due
of Buff Hardie, Steve Robertson, and George Donald. After all, weren't
they the same North-east entertainers who invited Her Majesty to open
the Oldmeldrum Sports a few years ago?
Buff Hardie said last night: ''We ken her mither and her auldest loon
Charlie but this will be the first time we've met the Queen hersel.''
The honour coincides, appropriately, with their farewell tour,
currently drawing capacity audiences around the country.
It all began in the 1950s when Buff and Steve met up in the Aberdeen
University student shows.
But they were bringing it all to an end at the Edinburgh Festival of
1969 when they were hailed as the funniest show in town. Instead of the
end, it was just the beginning of their wider fame. They were part-time
entertainers -- Steve Robertson was an Aberdeen solicitor, George Donald
assistant rector of Perth Academy, and Buff Hardie chief executive of
Grampian Health Board -- but later gave up those careers to concentrate
on the stage.

FRIENDS of the Earth yesterday called on Shetland people to boycott
Shell products in protest at the dumping of the Brent Spar. However, the
owner of the only Shell filling station in the islands said he was a
Greenpeace supporter and all his petrol came from a BP refinery. Mr
Magnus Williamson, of Grantfield Garage, Lerwick, said: ''I feel very
bad about the boycott because if it works it's going to mean a loss of
business for me. I think Greenpeace is absolutely right. If they keep
dumping rubbish in the sea there'll be no end to it. Our petrol
originates from the BP refinery in Grangemouth. Shell buy it from BP and
sell it to me.''

DELIGHTED veteran hit maker Cliff Richard arrived back from a holiday
in Portugal, suntanned and with a beaming grin, to celebrate being
recognised as Britain's ambassador of pop.
He said he was ''flabbergasted'' at the news that he had been
knighted.
''I feel really proud to have the 'Sir' attached. Sometimes I think we
in showbiz are in danger of belittling something fabulous. I have been
singing nearly 37 years and to suddenly find myself honoured I find
really proud.''
Sir Cliff is the most successful star pop music has produced, with
more hits than even Elvis Presley during five decades at the top.
He said last night: ''I'm absolutely thrilled, delighted -- all the
words like that you can think of.''
0 Cliff has outlasted them all, with 13 number ones out of 115 hits
since 1958 and with 26 consecutive top 10 hits.
His strong Christian faith means his concerts always include gospel
and religious music. He has worked hard for religious charities since
his conversion in 1965.
OTHER showbusiness figures in the list include veteran comic Norman
Wisdom, who has finally been honoured with an OBE aftwe 50 knockabout
years in entertainment.
Wisdom, now aged 80, has appeared in more than 30 TV sitcoms and 19
films.
Elaine Paige -- undisputed queen of the British musical stage -- is
given an OBE.
After a celebration lunch at a chic West London restaurant, the singer
-- who became a star with Evita -- returned to rehearsals at London's
Adelphi Theatre where she is starring in Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber's hit
show Sunset Boulevard.
Susan Hampshire has been awarded an OBE for her work in raising
awareness about dyslexia.
The distinguished actress is probably Britain's best-known sufferer of
the condition which causes reading difficulties.
Actor Alan Bates, who becomes a CBE, has had a life of great success
tinged with deep tragedies. His son Tristan died in 1990 from an asthma
attack and two years later the actor's wife of 22 years Victoria was
found dead in a hotel room in Italy, apparently from a broken heart.
However, Bates, 61, has battled on through the trauma with hard work to
see his other son Benedick become a successful actor in his own right.

WITH this third volume, John Charmley brings to an end his
revolutionary rewriting of British wartime history. His thesis has
startled nearly everyone, offended many and may raise even choppier
waves in the ocean of national self-esteem flowing from the anniversary
of VE-Day.
He torpedoes one of the few comforting myths left to modern Britons,
that despite our faults, we did stand together half a century ago to
defend our freedom and vindicate our values, amid struggles and
sacrifices which posterity will surely honour in all time coming.
The author's cool retort is that, from the perspective of today, the
effort appears to have been largely wasted. ''The British had fought two
World Wars to prevent Germany from dominating Europe, and they had still
ended up in a German-dominated Europe. They had fought to preserve their
independence, but they had lost it all the same. The words of the great
Duke of Wellington seems apposite: 'The only thing worse than such a
victory is a defeat'.''
In this analysis, we may identify two elements which have especially
shocked the conventional wisdom. One is, for want of a better word,
Thatcherism, the idea that national independence and the national
interest ought to be the central concern of our rulers. Coupled with
that is a certain amoralism, an assumption that states are the coldest
of cold monsters, that they are in a sense beyond good and evil, so that
there is nothing ultimately good or evil about any of them.
Thus Hitler has to be judged not as a diabolical visitation, an
otherworldly fiend, but as a man who found means to exploit Germany's
inherent brute strength. In fact, Charmley does not de-demonise him
quite so much as A J P Taylor did. If we struck deals with Stalin, we
could have struck deals with Hitler: after all, we allowed Stalin to do
to eastern Europe exactly what we fought to stop Hitler doing. Had we
not been blinded by certain myths, we might have seen that Britain's
primarily imperial interests were better served by a new European
balance of power between Stalin and Hitler than by helping the one --
and that only in a minor way -- to defeat the other.
The author of the myths was Churchill. Charmley can scarcely conceal a
sneaking admiration for his indomitable character, often wrong but never
less than magnificently so. The flaws in his outlook may have gone back
to his American mother, or to silly notions about the superiority of the
Anglo-Saxon race learned at Harrow in the 1890s. At any rate, faced with
a lost European war when he took over the premiership in 1940, he
decided to turn the tide by relying on the United States.
This was, in Charmley's estimate, a colossal error. Of course the
Americans could, if none too quickly, summon up the resources to reopen
the western front, and of course we and they had certain principles of
constitutional government in common. But they had not fought and beaten
us in their War of Independence for nothing. They had their own agenda.
With their manifest destiny on the North American continent fulfilled,
they meant to go on and make the whole world safe for their values. In
foreign affairs, therefore, they were anti-imperialist. Churchill could
not have been more wrong to assume that they would prop up the British
Empire, let alone become its partner.
That was not why they entered the conflict on its side. They did so to
protect their own interests, on being attacked by Japan, after which
they had to fight Germany too, because Hitler declared war on them.
Roosevelt, his acolytes and successors, certainly wanted a victory over
their enemies. But they did not abandon the rest of the American agenda,
which in the long run included the dissolution of their ally's Empire.
They thought this immoral in itself. And once they had done for it, they
expected Britain's former colonies to be drawn into a global economic
system run by the United States which would become the focus of their
loyality instead.
In the most contentious of the new arguments advanced by Charmley, he
shows how, in the crucial period at the end of the war and just
afterwards, the chief actors in Washington saw the Soviet Union as a
lesser evil. The central episode of the book is the speech made by
Churchill at Fulton, Missouri, in March 1946, famous for having
enunciated the, in fact unoriginal, concept of the Iron curtain. But it
triumphantly succeeded in shifting American thinking, so that the
Russians were henceforth included out of the post-war moral crusade.
Even so, it did not manage to include the British Empire in. We finally
realised that at Suez, Eden, one of the few heroes in these pages,
fought a vain rearguard action against American delusion and
priggishness. Macmillan and the other epigones merely grovelled.
Not everyone will agree with Charmley, but few will doubt that this
volume and its companions represent a fine achievement. They are
splendid empirical history, and they offer a robust, challenging
intellectual structure which future writers on these matters will be
unable to ignore. They not only cover events, but also probe into the
deep springs of our country's life and destiny. A historian cannot do
more.

Jim Hewitson sees opportunities in the miracle business
CHECK out your local saint when you next get the chance because if I'm
getting the vibes correctly, the path of the pilgrim is set to play a
significant role in Scottish leisure pursuits into the 21st century. Who
knows, it may even prompt a religious revival of sorts.
Perhaps in your neck of the woods you have some half-forgotten martyr
or miracle worker remembered only by a pile of stones or a tumbled cross
at the lochside. Yet, he or she may be the key to securing your share of
the ever-more lucrative tourist business.
Personally, I'm all set. The donkey is no problem. Edward would love a
new role in life, grazing up at the glebe gets a bit monotonous, he
tells me. I've got my grandfather's stout blackthorn staff, root maps,
sturdy boots, and my grant application to the local eneterprise company
is in the post.
Just when I thought to put on the sober, soothing cloak of middle age
a new challenge looms. I'll be slipping instead into a nifty cassock,
ready to offer my services as the first professional pilgrim in Scotland
since the Reformation.
Scottish pilgrim trails are likely to be highlighted more clearly over
the next few years, according to my contacts in the walking business.
Among the more obvious already mentioned have been St Columba at Iona,
St Ninian at Whithorn, St Duthac at Tain, St Andrew, of course, and St
Cuthbert, whose connections stretch along the Scottish borders to the
remote Farne Islands south of Berwick. In fact, an ambitious plan for a
Cuthbert trail is already being considered by Scottish Borders
Enterprise.
If the situation here on Papa Westray is anything to go by, then there
must be endless possibilities throughout Scotland.
Why, for instance, did folk travel to this remote corner of Scotland?
Briefly, the beautiful St Tredwell is credited with having plucked out
her eyes and sent them on a twig to a randy Pictish chieftain in order
to cool his ardour. Thereafter people came here to trudge down the
now-vanished Messigate, to walk around the loch three times and bathe
their faces in the waters by the ruined chapel in the hope of a cure of
eye ailments. The fact that pilgrims kept coming long after the
Reformation suggests that some cures, miraculous or otherwise, were
effected.
In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, there were few restrictions
on travel between Scotland and England and consequently an enormous
traffic of pilgrims ensued. Many Scots favoured the shrine of Thomas a
Becket at Canterbury but St Andrews was a magnet for religious voyagers
from as far afield as Germany and Italy. The pilgrimage trade providing
transport, accommodation, and keep-sakes such as pilgrim badges, was an
important component in the Scottish economy. Several pilgrim ferries
crossed the Forth, for example from North Berwick to Earlsferry.
The fact that many Scots -- or professional pilgrims hired to go in
their stead -- travelled to Santiago de Compostela in Northern Spain, a
major pilgrimage site in Western Europe, is confirmed by the discovery
of scallop shell badges, the symbol of St James found at various
archaeological digs in Scotland.
If you want to learn more of the pilgrim way, then you can still catch
an exhibition called The Archaeology of Pilgrimage at St Andrews Museum
which runs until June 25. The activities of the Isle of May saint, St
Ethernan, are also explored in this display.
Now, where was I -- religious phrase book, blister ointment, donkey
wormer, cassette of Gregorian chants . . .
* A collection of Jim Hewitson's essays, Scotching The Myths, will be
published by Mainstream next week, price #9.99.

APPROACHING the end of the spring migrant season, the Shetland Isles
once again continue to steal the spotlight by producing top quality
national rarities including a Collared Flycatcher, Terek Sandpiper,
Olivaceous Warbler, Beeater and Rose-Coloured Starling. These sightings
are in addition to the already impressive list of Black-browed
Albatross, King Eider and Icterine Warbler. Other highlights elsewhere
include Great Northern Diver, Night Heron, Little Egret and Black-Necked
Grebes.
Reports are listed in their approximate order of rarity or interest of
the species, giving dates seen. Unfortunately no guarantees can be given
that the birds will still be present at this time.
REGIONAL REPORTS
Shetland -- A much sought after vagrant wader in the form of a Terek
Sandpiper (11th) on South Mainland was the main focus of attention on
Shetland this week along with a Collared Flycatcher (5th) seen at
Tresta. Other rarities on Shetland included an Olivaceous Warbler and
Beeater on Fair Isle (11th), a Red-backed Shrike and Common Rosefinch at
Sumburgh (11th), an Icterine Warbler at Lerwick (9th) and a
Rose-coloured Starling (7th) on Shetland mainland. The long staying King
Eider and Albatross could once again be seen on Unst (11th) whilst
sea-watches throughout the week produced several sightings of Pomarine
Skuas.
Grampian -- A female Scaup (11th) was sighted at Loch Spinney and
three Black-Tailed Godwits were reported from near Lossiemouth. A
sea-watch near Aberdeen produced a Great Northern Diver (11th) and the
Forsters Tern and Drake King Meider remained on the Ythan Estuary
(11th).
Lothian -- A Night Heron (9th) found near Balerno was one of several
sightings of these birds in recent years that have been associated with
escapes from the nearby feral colony at Edinburgh Zoo. Of greater
authenticity in the region was a Little Egret (7th) again seen near
Dunbar.
Tayside -- The Drake King Eider near Carnoustie was reported still
present (11th) along with up to seven little Gulls also seen nearby. At
the RSPB Loch of Kinnordy reserve near Kirriemuir two pairs of
Black-necked Grebes remain on the loch with at least one of the pairs
now breeding (11th).
Strathclyde -- Several pairs of Ruddy Ducks were again reported from
various lochs in the north-east of Glasgow heightening concerns about
population expanse. Kingfishers could be watched throughout the week at
the RSPB Barnes Haugh reserve along with more common ducks and waders.
Dumfries and Galloway -- A Little Egret was again present at the
Caerlaverock WWT reserve (7th).
National -- Highlight of the week was the sighting of a Great Spotted
Cuckoo in East Sussex. Seen only briefly, the bird flew off and could
not be found again. A River Warbler was trapped and released near Wigan.
In Norfolk rarities included a Lesser Yellowlegs along with a Cattle
Egret and in Cleveland an American Golden Plover and Lesser Crested Tern
were reported.

Andrew MacKay discovers the secrets of foaming cans
LIFE is not getting easier for the party-going new-generation man. And
as he adopts his most masculine posture to attract his preferred gender,
he may well have wrapped within a manly fist a bottle of Bud or a tube
of beer. Although the can in his hand is not painted with one of a fresh
bevy of Tennent's lovelies, it may nevertheless also claim to be of a
new generation.
When the ring on the can is pulled there is gurgling and almost a
panic from within is felt through its gossamer skin. But when poured
into a glass, as it should be, it assumes the characteristic of draught
beer that is served in the pub.
To peer into the can's darkened shaft gives little to sight. There
seems to be the remains of a shuttlecock in one, and a straw growing out
of the base in another. But the hacksaw will remain in the cupboard.
Cellarman recalls opening a tin of corned beef and when just reaching
the climactic prise, the slippery fellow gouged a jagged edge into a
finger. Almost a pint of blood was lost then but the shivers still
remain.
The wizards of invention at the breweries in an effort to replicate
draught beer in appearance and taste as served in the pub have created a
little monster with a lot of puff. A thousand hosannas for the widget.
Its accent is Irish for it was the creation of the Guinness team of
let's-invent-something-new in Dublin. And after several years' research
and #5m they were the first on the market six years ago with pub quality
stout in a can.
In a tin of Draught Guinness the widget is a small circular plastic
insert that is fixed in position at the bottom of the can. After the can
has been filled with beer, a whif of liquid nitrogen is added and before
it has a chance to escape the lid is quickly fitted.
Inside the can there is a lot of activity as the liquid nitrogen
evaporates into a gaseous form and causes the pressure to rise. Lying in
the deep, the widget accepts through a minute hole a mixture of beer and
gas until the pressures between head space and insert have become equal.
When the can is opened the gas in the insert expands as it tries to
equalise with atmospheric pressure. Gas and beer stream out of the
widget into the beer with enough gusto to create thousands of small
bubbles which rapidly duplicate and the resulting eruption eventually
settles giving a glass of clear beer with a head that has its place in
the pub.
The technology developed in Ireland has led to a host of in-can
systems being developed by other brewers. And although most work on
similar lines they come in different shapes and sizes. The smaller is
certainly the better in this case as it leaves more room for beer.The
secrets of these little devices, and the techniques and machinery
required to capture their magic, are almost as closely guarded as the
recipe to make a nuclear bomb once was. And the brewers have been quick
to patent their inventions cultivating an array of names such as
Draughtflow, Draught Stream, Tapstream and Caskpour to identify their
products.
How the humble can has progressed.
First to can beer in Britain was the Felinfoel Brewery in Llanelly,
South Wales in December 1935, perhaps due to the strong presence of the
Welsh steel industry and that the Metal Box company had a factory
nearby. But by 1937 more than 20 brewers were canning beer.
The cone-shaped Brasso tin look-alike has come a long way in 60 years
and one wonders whether the new-generation man will get the same
pleasure from drinking its contents without a glass.

<TEXT>
FIVE disabled pensioners yesterday won a test case at the High Court
in London which means that local authorities must think again about the
way community care services are provided.
However, the crucial action brought against Gloucestershire County
Council failed to achieve what many had hoped for -- an increase in
Government funding for community care across the country.
The Department of Health immediately indicated after the judgment that
it would not be providing extra cash despite complaints from councils of
the financial constraints highlighted by the case.
The Government responded after two judges declared that
Gloucestershire County Council had acted unlawfully in withdrawing care
facilities from local residents across-the-board after #3m cuts in
funding in 1993.
Lord Justice McCowan, sitting with Mr Justice Waller, said officials
should have individually reassessed the needs of the disabled in the
light of the cuts before taking action last September and October.
Charities for the elderly welcomed the ruling but were disappointed by
the court's accompanying decision that councils were entitled to take
the size of resources into account when assessing who was entitled to
receive help.
They believe this lets the Government, which is ultimately responsible
for providing funds, off the hook.
Lawyers for the Public Law Project, acting on behalf of the elderly,
had argued that ''a need is a need'' and it did not go away because
there was not enough money to meet it.
Disagreeing, the judge said a local authority faced an impossible task
unless it could take into account ''the size of the cake so that in turn
they know how fairest and best to cut it''.
Mr Andy Pennington, chairman of Gloucestershire's social services
committee, said: ''Both social services and the applicants wanted a
judgment which forced the Government to adequately fund community
care.''
Labour health spokeswoman, Ms Tessa Jowell, said: ''This judgment is a
measure of the chaos community care is now in. It is chaos which
translates into anxiety for elderly people across the country.''
The Department of Health spokesman welcomed the ruling as ''a
clarification of the law'' but rejected assumptions that it would have
to provide more money.
''It (the ruling) does not say more money is needed. Local authorities
need to take into account their own resources. There is no need to
change any of our guidance or the law,'' he said.
Yesterday's test action was brought to clear up confusion which arose
since the introduction of the Government's community care package in
April 1993.
Mr Jack Bury, chairman of the Association of County Councils' social
services committee, said: ''The court has said social services
authorities have a duty to provide services but there must be adequate
funding to pay for these services.''
The project was refused leave to appeal against yesterday's decision
but is now considering going to the Court of Appeal directly.

Halifax, Nova Scotia,
A CHANGE of leadership is not a ''magic ingredient'' to restore the
Conservatives' fortunes, Mr John Major warned his back benchers
yesterday.
Speaking in Halifax, where he is attending the Group of Seven summit,
the Prime Minister said he intended to continue with ''steady
policies''.
Asked his opinion of ''revolting back benchers'' who have lined up to
question his leadership, Mr Major said: ''I do not know that I would
describe them in quite that fashion in the first place.''
He added: ''I think the way in which to conduct a government is to
have steady policies, to stick to those policies, to set out what they
are and to carry those policies through until fruition.''
Responding to the criticisms of his leadership that have broken out
since he left London, Mr Major said: ''The belief that suddenly some
magic ingredient is going to change everything over night is not the
case. One has to set out a policy and stick to a policy. I've set it out
and I will stick to it,'' he said.
''It's long term. It's sensible, it's pragmatic, it will not be
changed.''

THE Cromwell Street murder inquiry has cost almost #1.5m a police
chief said yesterday.
Gloucestershire Chief Constable Tony Butler said in his annual report
that the exact bill was #1,421,754 at the year end.
The Home Office has already turned down a request from Gloucester
County Council to meet half the cost.
The inquiry began in February last year when a girl's remains were
found buried in the garden of 25 Cromwell Street.
Police went on to find the remains of eight other young women at the
house and three others locations.
Builder Fred West, 53, hanged himself in prison while awaiting trial
on 12 charges of murder.
His wife, Mrs Rosemary West, 41, is on remand awaiting trial on ten
murder charges and several other alleged sex offences.

A CLERICAL worker with 33 years' service, who was made redundant and
then replaced by a younger woman with a business diploma, was awarded
almost #10,000 by an industrial tribunal yesterday.
Mrs Enid Henderson, 62, of Bruce Street, Lincluden, Dumfries, a
warehouse clerkess with Robertson of Dumfries, was made redundant last
November.
Mrs Henderson had claimed that there was no redundancy situation as
her job still existed, that she had not been consulted, and was only
told of her redundancy on the day of her dismissal.
She also believed her dismissal was unfair as she was the longest
serving member of the clerical department.
The company had denied the dismissal was unfair, and said there was a
need for redundancies due to a considerable drop in orders and the
economic burden of an unsuccessful business expansion.
It also claimed it had to modernise its clerical function by
computerisation.
The company had thought that Mrs Henderson would retire when she was
60 but, at that time, she indicated she had no wish to do so and carried
on working.
The tribunal noted: ''Over the years, she did everything she was asked
to do by the respondent, her work was of a consistently high standard
and she carried out all her duties to the entire satisfaction of the
respondent, being a capable and conscientious worker.''
Last year, the firm experienced adverse trading conditions and a
downturn in orders, which caused it extreme difficulties. Its cashflow
was bad, it was short of money and it was put on a credit stop, so that
it had to cancel orders.
The company, therefore, decided to make 32 employees -- 15% of the
workforce -- redundant.
The tribunal accepted that Mrs Henderson's job might have become
redundant in a few months' time, but said that it was not redundant at
the time of her dismissal.
It found that the real reason for her dismissal was that the company
was under pressure to reduce the number of its employees and wished to
dispense with her services and replace her with a younger employee with
a business diploma as, in its eyes, she had overstayed her retiral date.
In deciding that the dismissal was unfair, the tribunal awarded Mrs
Henderson #9994 in compensation.

They may not be showcase attractions, but London's museum eateries are
trying hard, finds Margaret Hughes
EARLIER this year a review of the restaurants in some of Scotland's
museums and galleries proved that Edinburgh was doing a lot of things
right, while Glasgow had a lot to learn. A trip to some of London's
popular museums showed that with so many of these attractions competing
for the visitor's time and money, adequate eating facilities are an
important ingredient.
Restaurant food at The Natural History Museum does not live up to the
standard set by the exhibits. Nevertheless, the foods is good and
affordable. The Waterhouse Cafe serves a selection of teas, coffees and
snacks, while the Gallery Restaurant, is a self-service operation where
you can have a three-course meal, plus wine or beer, or a quick
sandwich.
The menu changes daily and includes a choice of traditional and
vegetarian dishes. The barley stew sounded so healthy I had to have it.
It was a generous proportion with vegetables and large wedges of baked
potato. The stew was a thick, tomato concoction of barley and courgettes
and carrots. The flavour was a little bland, but it was filling. At
around #7 for two courses plus a drink, the menu is fairly priced and
the huge portions make it excellent value for money.
No similar attempts to recreate exhibits were apparent at the National
Gallery, although the dessert came close.
There is a choice of eating places in the National Gallery. The Cafe
is situated in the main building and is run by Pret A Manger. The
Brasserie dominates a large corner of the first floor of the new
Sainsbury Wing. The brasserie has a more formal table service with a
menu that offers a special lunch menu, covering three price ranges, from
#7.95 for a main course and coffee.
Museum cafes must be switched on to the notion that tourists regularly
fill up at lunchtime, because once again portions were huge. I had the
crostini with courgettes, carrots, aubergine, mushrooms and onions
bubbling in a spicy tomato sauce topped with mozzarella cheese in a bed
of chunky brown bread. It was filling and enjoyable. For sweets you can
choose from seven desserts or if choosing is too difficult, you can have
a little bit of everything.
There is a good choice of wines, around 12 red and 12 white, and
sparkling wines and champagne.
At the British Museum its restaurant is bright and airy, a glass
ceiling allows in natural light. It is a self-service operation with a
varied menu of hot and cold main courses and snacks.
There was a good selection of salads, which looked fresh and
nutritious, so I quickly decided on couscous stuffed peppers with a
salad of tomatoes in a vinaigrette dressing. It was very good. I was not
the only customer to take my time deciding which dessert to choose from
myriad creme brulee, pastries, flans and gateaux. In the end I chose a
fresh raspberry tart with a custard filling. It was a good choice. Again
it was good value for money, at about #9 for two courses plus a drink.
These restaurants are not meant to be the highlight of visits to The
Natural History Museum, National Gallery or British Museum, but they
certainly add to the whole experience.

<TEXT>
MUSLIM-led Government troops drove a wedge into the Bosnian Serb siege
of Sarajevo yesterday while Serb gunners shelled the city, killing two
bed-ridden patients with a direct hit on the main hospital.
The UN said Bosnian forces fought up a steeply wooded slope from the
city to cut the main supply route between the Serbs' stronghold of Pale
and their Lukavica army garrison on Sarajevo's outskirts.
The overall death toll reached 20 -- including five Serb civilians hit
behind their own lines -- during intense fighting around the capital,
gripped by reports of a Government offensive to break the siege.
Most of the fighting erupted around strategic suburbs and roads vital
to the survival of the three-year siege.
Peacekeepers feared they were caught in an attempt by the Government
to smash the Serb encirclement as its troops attacked towards Sarajevo
from the north, south and south-west.
''We think they are pinning the Serbs down at a number of locations
around the city,'' spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Gary Coward said as UN
chief envoy Yasushi Akashi appealed for a ceasefire. ''We think we're
going to see days of fighting at least.''
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic, tired of the UN's toleration of
the siege has vowed to end the ''strangulation'' of Sarajevo.
Sarajevo streets, always a barometer of the violence, were deserted
long into the day as the guns boomed and civilians fled to basement
shelters.
Bosnian troops hauled impounded mortars and field guns from a UN arms
dump in Sarajevo, threatening to shoot Ukrainian guards if they
interfered. They also took back two tanks.
Government reinforcements, some from central Bosnia, packed the
capital amid persistent reports of offensives to break or ease the
siege. Some 15,000 Bosnian troops are deployed outside the city,
sandwiching the Serbs.
''Our assessment is that (the fighting) is aimed at relieving the
pressure on Sarajevo. Whether the Bosnian army believes it can break the
siege completely is another matter,'' Lt-Col Coward said.
The Security Council last Friday authorised the deployment of a
multinational Rapid Reaction Force of 12,500 men to protect the UN
mission and set aside a dispute with the United States over who should
pay for them.

Halifax, Nova Scotia,
The US was yesterday left isolated by President Clinton's inability to
pledge financial support to the UN peace-keeping efforts because of
Congressional opposition,.
Mr Clinton was reduced to offering only moral support for the new
Rapid Reaction Force following the refusal of the Republican-led
Congress to pay America's share of the UN operation.
He told his fellow leaders of the Group of Seven industrialised
countries that although he supported the plan, he was unable to commit
funds -- expected to be a third of the force's costs.
The G7 leaders agreed that the question mark over funding of the
force, which will cost $414m for six months, would not prevent it from
going to Bosnia. Instead, it will be put to one side, leaving Mr Clinton
to negotiate a compromise with Congress.
In a one-to-one meeting with Mr Clinton yesterday, Mr Major said the
funding issue would have to be addressed as soon as possible.
President Clinton, speaking at the summit last night, said he would
back lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia's Muslim Government if UN
peacekeepers are pulled out.
''If the UN mission does fail, if our allies decide to leave, I would
strongly support lifting the arms embargo. It is our best alternative at
that moment,'' he said at the summit.

THE DIARIES OF EVELYN WAUGH. Michael Davie (ed). THE LETTERS OF EVELYN
WAUGH Mark Amory (ed). (Phoenix, #9.99 each).
* ALMOST all books about Evelyn Waugh suffer from an excess of
admiration, but whatever Waugh's own faults he had no illusions about
himself; he was a thorough four-letter fellow, and disguised the fact
from neither his correspondents nor his diary. This is what makes these
books the most revealing, the wittiest, and oddly enough the most
endearing life of Waugh you can buy. Underneath the rudeness and
pugnacity, there is discernible the voice of a sad, hyper-sensitive man
whose misanthropy hid -- and all too well -- a kind heart and generous
sympathies. His tragedy was that he put on an iron mask and his face
grew to fit it.
A STONE BOAT. Andrew Solomon (Faber, #5.99).
* THE literature of the death and dying of mothers -- led by Simone De
Beauvoir's A Very Easy Death -- is small and select, but Andrew
Solomon's stoic confessional novel does not disgrace the company it
keeps. Harry, the narrator, is a young American pianist living in
London, and his relationship with his mother has been clouded by his gay
sexuality. His mother worries about him. It gives her stress. And
stress, as his mother reminds him, gives people cancer. Over the long
months of her dying, however, the calm stark presence of the death that
will soon force them apart is actually bringing them together. A Stone
Boat is a very fine novel that will be particularly appreciated by
readers who have shared Harry's loss.
WITHOUT A HERO And Other Stories. T Coraghessan Boyle (Granta, #4.99).
* THE more a writer takes strangeness as his stock-in-trade, the more
sober his prose style must be: this is what makes the difference between
a comedian and a clown. T Coraghessan Boyle's latest collection confirms
his status as America's greatest literary comedian in 15 tall tales
about subjects including big-game shooting at a phoney California safari
park, a Mafia feud between two dying Godfathers, and a sick but
commercially available video of fatal accidents. -- all this in a manner
so dry and downbeat as to make Jane Austen look like Martin Amis. Funny
as hell, black as night.
LADIES MAN. Richard Price (Bloomsbury, #4.99).
* If your sympathies unfurl to the lowlife raconteurship of Charles
Bukowski, or if a Lou Reed record is never far from your gramophone,
you'll love Richard Price. This, the first UK publication of the 1978
novel by the screenwriter of Sea Of Love, is the story of how the
almost-respectable door-to-door salesman Kenny Becker, fired from his
job and dumped by his girlfriend, lets go of decent ordinary life and
hits the Road to Ruin in wicked old New York. Depravity and debauchery
have seldom been so sad, so disreputable, or so droll.
NIGHTMARE OF ECSTASY: The Life And Art Of Edward D Wood Jr. Rudolph
Grey (Faber, #9.99).
* KNOWN, until very recently, only to a handful of movie anoraks (all
right, I confess), the Worst Director In The World has now achieved a
posthumous fame through Tim Burton's biopic Ed Wood. In his own life he
was just a poverty-stricken independent producer and director of Z-grade
pictures like Plan 9 From Outer Space, a transvestite weirdie hanging
around the fringes of the Hollywood party scene. But what justifies this
book -- a collection of bizarre personal reminiscences by Wood's stars,
friends, and colleagues -- is that Ed Wood, though possessed of neither
talent nor money, truly believed in his art and gave up his life to it.
He was to cinema what McGonagall was to poetry. His story is one of
ludicrous failure: but, goddamnit, he tried.

<RECORDNO>977846561</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Lewis Offshore yard in Stornoway has won a contract worth more
than #8m in the face of stiff competition from major British oil-yards.
The contract for a 3000-tonne jacket for Texaco's Erskine gas field --
which lies about 170-miles east of Aberdeen near BP's Machar field --
has been won in partnership with the British subsidiary of the Italian
company Saipem, which will undertake the installation work, and
designers Technomare.
Trafalgar House, UIE, and the Barmac operation at Nigg and Ardersier
were also after the contract.
In the end the choice was between the consortium involving Lewis
Offshore and another involving Kvaerner, SLP and Heerema.
The Lewis yard has concentrated on smaller contracts since re-opening
in 1990, keeping the workforce at around 200. However, the yard's
general manager, Mr Peter Webster, has always maintained that it wanted
major contracts.
The yard had an established track record for building larger projects
including the 3800-tonne BP Cleeton production jacket in the mid-1980s.
The Texaco Erskine jacket contract will provide work for up to 300 men
at its peak, and the work should last until March 1996. Preparation work
should start within the next two weeks, with fabrication due to start in
eight to nine weeks.
This crowns a successful week for the Lewis yard, which has also won
another smaller contract, understood to be worth around #750,000.
This involves rolling and fabricating 12 anchoring piles for a
floating production system being built by Single Buoy Moorings. The work
is due to start in the autumn, employing up to 40 men until 1995.
The latest news will come as a relief for the workforce, since the
number of staff and hourly-paid workers has dwindled to around 50 as
contracts have been completed.
Although the yard recently announced another small contract for piles
for Texaco's Captain field, worth around #500,000, this is not due to
start until the autumn, and all the yard's hourly-paid workers faced
being laid-off.

Glasgow Jazz Festival Director Derek Gorman describes his record
collection to Keith Moore
I'VE always agreed with the old Dizzy Gillespie dictum that there are
only two kinds of music: good and bad. Therefore, in a week when the pop
chart was topped by two squadies and a karaoke machine covering an old
Righteous Brothers song, it was good to hear some good music. It did,
however, take a trip to a picturesque cottage in a little village on the
banks of The Union Canal to hear it -- to the home of Glasgow Jazz
Festival director Derek Gorman.
So, what does your average Jazzfest director listen to? Jazz, you
won't be surprised to hear, and a whole lot more. He has a liking for
country; Don Williams, Crystal Gayle, Rita Coolidge and (as he himself
puts it) adult-oriented rock, which appears to have been the result of
eight years of working in commercial radio. But it is jazz which
dominates his collection lying in large piles as I walk into the front
room.
Gorman himself played in a jazz band in the late fifties. ''It was in
Bangor, where I grew up, and I played double bass in a mainstream band
called The Blue Notes, there was quite a thriving scene in Ireland at
the time. Indeed it was a concert by Humphrey Lyttleton which prompted
me to buy my first album -- Humphrey Lyttleton At The Conway. We used to
play poker on a Sunday night and I would spend my winnings on records.''
His main source of music was the American Forces Network where he
could hear the groovesome sounds of Dave Brubeck and Dizzy Gillespie.
Moving to Scotland in 1969, he began singing in a local band. Indeed
it is a singer who provides one of his most awe-inspiring musical
moments. ''I was at a dance in the early 70s when I heard Van Morrison's
Moondance for the first time. I couldn't move, my feet just stopped, my
wife thought something had happened to me. The song's big walking
bass-line was just unbelievable.''
His jazz collection is impressive, and most are rare original
pressings by Miles, Dizzy, Gerry Mulligan and Charlie Parker. Indeed, it
is Bird who is probably his greatest inspiration. ''His playing never
ceases to astound me.'' Which perhaps goes some way to explaining the
Tribute To Bird concert at this year's Festival.
Like many, Gorman initially expresses a preference for CDs and says he
would like to replace his vinyl with the little round shiny things.
Later in the evening however, he declares: ''Looking at all these
records and going through them has made me think twice about getting rid
of them.''
And so it should, record collections represent lifetimes, little
pocketfuls of memories which can evoke the past more completely than any
photograph. Which is what makes collections so personal and ultimately
revealing. Indeed, a pile of old vinyl can tell you more about a person
than they might ever say to your face.
As I leave, Gorman chases Sprocket the cat, who has obviously decided
to make a bed for the night on top of his prized collection, out of the
room. So remember, kids, cats and lover's tiffs -- all arch enemies of
the dedicated vinyl junkie.

TRAIN drivers' leaders have unanimously denounced British Rail's 3%
''final'' pay offer.
They have advised their 14,000 colleagues to support a series of
24-hour strikes in a ballot which began yesterday.
Delegates to the annual conference meeting in Scarborough also threw
out a 2.75% ''final'' offer from London Underground and gave the
required seven days' notice that its 2500 Tube drivers are to be
balloted on similar action.
With the main rail industry union, the RMT, already committed to
balloting its BR and Tube membership on the rejected offers, a summer of
rail chaos is looking increasingly likely.
On legal advice, Rail Express Systems, which runs the mail trains and
Railfreight Distribution, are being excluded from the ballots although
parallel claims are now being lodged with them and they too will face
their own ballots unless acceptable offers are forthcoming.
Aslef general secretary Lew Adams told his union confernce: ''We must
co-ordinate action on BR and the Tube in order to unify the struggle.''
In what is expected to be the last centrally negotiated BR pay deal
before negotiations are devolved as parts of the network are privatised,
the RMT has claimed a 6% increase while Aslef is demanding ''a
substantial increase over and above inflation''.
Both are incensed at 21% bonuses paid out to BR executives last year.

CHEESEMAKER Humphrey Errington was savouring another legal victory
yesterday, after three appeal judges ruled that he had been denied
natural justice when a Justice of the Peace condemned batches of his
celebrated Lanark Blue as unfit to eat.
Mr Errington makes the cheese, sold at Harrods and reputed to be a
favourite of the royals, at Ogscastle Farm, near Carnwath, Lanarkshire.
In March this year, Clydesdale District Council seized 44 batches,
worth about #27,000, under the 1990 Food Safety Act.
Justice of the Peace Mrs Elizabeth Wilson decided that the cheese was
contaminated with the listeria bacteria, unfit for human consumption,
and must be destroyed at Mr Errington's expense.
Mr Errington was granted interim interdict at the Court of Session
which reprieved the cheese pending a judicial review by Lord Weir.
In April, the judge ruled that by refusing to allow cross-examination
of witnesses at the hearing, the JP had denied Mr Errington natural
justice.
He also recommended that if the council made another attempt to have
the cheese declared dangerous to public health, the hearing should take
place before a sheriff rather than a JP, because of the difficult and
technical nature of the evidence.
Clydesdale appealed against Lord Weir's decision, but yesterday Lord
President Hope, sitting with Lords Allanbridge and Clyde, supported Lord
Weir.
Lord Hope said the main issue was whether the JP had been under a duty
to allow cross-examination. The district council argued that it was a
matter for her discretion.
Lord Hope added: ''In a case of this difficulty, there was an obvious
risk of unfairness if the council's witnesses were not open to
cross-examination on the detail of their evidence.
''The consequences for Mr Errington and his business were likely to be
very serious if the case went against him, and he had a right under the
statute to attend and to call witnesses.
''The prejudice which resulted from the refusal to allow
cross-examination is self-evident. There was a difference of opinion
between experts on points which were crucial to a sound determination of
the questions which the justice had to decide.
''I consider that by refusing to allow cross-examination, the justice
disabled herself from reaching a fully-informed conclusion upon the
evidence. This amounted to a denial of natural justice to Mr Errington,
as her duty to act fairly required her to permit cross-examination.''
In theory, Clydesdale could appeal against yesterday's decision to the
House of Lords, but it is expected instead to adopt Lord Weir's
suggestion to take the case back to court, this time before a sheriff.
Mr Bob Russell, the council's director of housing and environmental
health, said yesterday that what was of primary importance was that the
cheese should be destroyed for the protection of the public.
Mr Russell added that the council had followed ''100%'' the provisions
of the 1990 Food Safety Act and the Code of Practice issued by the
Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.
''We thought we had a good case, but we will now have to go to the
Scottish Office.''
Mr Errington said: ''This whole issue is really about whether or not a
council's environmental health department can be allowed to rubber stamp
a business out of existance.
''Twice the courts have said No.
''This latest decision by the court is of tremendous significance to
the small producer.''

* Jim Farry, chairman and secretary of the Scottish Football
Association, tells ANN DONALD what he's reading.
I DON'T actively go out and buy a lot of sport and football books
because many of my relatives put them into my Christmas stocking every
year.
Autobiographies and biographies of those involved in football right
across the spectrum are always very interesting to me, especially those
about the leading players and managers. Most recently I read Venables --
The Autobiography by Terry Venables, the England coach. It was really a
commentary on his life and times that concentrated on his recent
turbulent times, shall we say. He took you through his whole personal
history from being brought up in a reasonably modest working-class home
to the sacrifices that were made and the keenness of his parents to
encourage him in his chosen sport.
I do enjoy reading books about Scottish history I must say. I picked
up a copy of an excellent book called Memoirs Of A Highland Lady by
Elizabeth Grant in a National Trust shop up north. It's set in the last
century and is about her life in a house somewhere between Kingussie and
Inverness. In fact, it was so good that I went out to buy the other two
memoirs she wrote. I did read a lot as a child I have to say, my library
ticket was well stamped. I read now if there's a quiet hour in the
evening or I'll pick up a book at bedtime.

THE Prime Minister was last night fighting for his political life as
the pressure built up for a challenge to his leadership in the autumn.
Ministers rallied round, but there was a growing feeling that
back-bench MPs were disenchanted and were minded to mount a challenge.
With Mr Major in Nova Scotia for the G7 summit, the party at home is in
a state of open warfare over its future.
Right and left are split, Euro-sceptics are at war with
Euro-enthusiasts, and there is a clear feeling that the Tories are on a
path to self-destruct.
Mr Major stood firm in the face of the rising tide of back-bench
anger, defiantly insisting that the Government would stick to its
policies, despite mounting right-wing pressure to to adopt a new agenda
aimed at winning back disenchanted supporters.
With Lady Thatcher's words of criticism still ringing in his ears, Mr
Major said there was no ''magic ingredient'' to put right the country's
problems. He refused to accept that his back benchers were in revolt and
made clear he was ready to stand firm against pressure for a change of
course.
''I think the way in which to conduct government is to have steady
policies, to stick to those policies, to set out what they are and to
carry those policies through until fruition.
''The belief that suddenly some magic ingredient is going to change
everything overnight is not the case. One has to set out a policy and
stick to it. I have set it out and stick to it.''
At home, however, Tory MPs were taking a different line and there was
open speculation about a leadership challenge, which may involve
something more serious than a token ''stalking-horse'' candidate.
One senior right-winger, Mr John Carlisle, MP for Luton North, warned
that Mr Major faced ''High Noon'' within days rather than weeks and the
clear feeling is that Mr Major is under the cosh.
Support came from, among others, Trade President Michael Heseltine,
who still is perceived in some quarters as a possible successor to Mr
Major. He said: ''I am absolutely convinced John Major will lead us into
the next election and he will win it.
''I have been around in this sort of milieu for about 10 years and
there are always these sorts of stories. They never happen.'' The policy
on Europe had been drawn up by the Cabinet to unite the party and to act
in the self-interest of Britain.
There was also support for Mr Major from Mr Michael Portillo and Mrs
Gillian Shephard during visits to Scotland, with Mrs Shephard rejecting
any suggestion of standing against the Prime Minister in a leadership
contest. She commented: ''This is the House of Commons at its worst. The
whole thing is absurd.''
John Major, she said, was far more popular than ''the Conservative
Party and the Government'' in the nation as a whole.
On a visit to Peebles, Mr Portillo, widely seen as the standard-bearer
of the right, dismissed talk of a challenge as ''irrelevant'' and
insisted there would be no change of leadership.
''John Major has made it clear he will continue to be the party
leader, he will go through to the next election. He was elected by the
British people and he has the right to put his record to the British
people -- and that is what he will do,'' he said.
Meanwhile, the 1922 Committee of back benchers made clear it was
prepared to put forward what amounts to a back-bench manifesto designed
to improve Tory fortunes.
The committee is next week expected to consider proposals, which will
be handed to Mr Major, to cut taxes, cut down on crime, end the
confusion on Europe and, perhaps most importantly, find some means of
helping hard-pressed home-owners.
Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the 1922 Committee, said: ''It is our
intention when our deliberations have been concluded to convey to the
Prime Minister our thoughts. I have no doubt he will give due
recognition to them.
''Far from undermining the Prime Minister our objective is to
strengthen his position and that of our party in the coming months.''
Sir Marcus insisted that the move was ''normal procedure,'' motivated
only by the need to regenerate support following the disastrous local
election results last month.
Among those backing the Prime Minister and urging the Tories to end
their squabbling yesterday was one of Lady Thatcher's former senior
lieutenants Lord Parkinson, who launched what was seen as a ''stop
Heseltine'' campaign by stating that what Mr Heseltine would offer would
not deliver what the Tory right want.
He added: ''John Major is taking a very firm line on Europe which the
whole party ought to rally behind.''
The Chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, who is with Mr Major at the G7
summit dismissed the idea of a leadership challenge.
''I think you will find that people interested in how the world
economies are going are not lying awake at night worrying about that
kind of thing.''
On the issue of a single currency Mr Clarke, in an interview with the
BBC, said Britain had a straight two-way choice.
''The British have negotiated for themselves a straightforward choice,
the so-called opt-out,'' he said.
''We'll exercise that when the time comes and the time isn't going to
come before 1999 at the earliest, if ever,'' he said.
Mr Clarke said the attraction of a single currency might be greater
exchange rate stability and an improved single European market.
The downside could be that it would not work because the economies of
the countries involved were not properly aligned.
The opposition parties, meanwhile, pitched in. The Liberal Democrats'
leader, Mr Paddy Ashdown, told Labour that ''fuzzy promises and
timidity'' would condemn the next Parliament to being a ''paving
interlude to Prime Minister Portillo''.
Labour's deputy leader, Mr John Prescott, said the Tory crisis was too
deep to be resolved simply by a change of leader. ''The Tory party is at
war with itself and its MPs are openly fighting among themselves,'' he
said. ''John Major is not the problem, so a change of leader is not the
solution.''

BRITAIN'S 500 full-time coastguards have voted overwhelmingly in an
unofficial ballot in favour of taking industrial action, should it be
necessary, in a dispute over staffing levels and emergency radio cover,
it was disclosed yesterday.
Chairman of the coastguard grades committee of the National Union of
Civil and Public Servants, Mr Dutchy Holland, said 87.5% of coastguards
had supported the industrial action in an ''indicative ballot'' held to
gauge their feelings.
The ballot follows Chief Coastguard Derek Ancona's apparent refusal to
back down over his decision to accept additional responsibility for
emergency radio cover.
The union claims that coastguards require to hold special licences to
operate the emergency cover under national and international law, while
management claims existing training covers this.
The union met management on June 6 and another meeting is planned for
next Friday.
However, Mr Holland said yesterday: ''Unless there is more movement
and more assurances from coastguard HQ, our members will be balloted on
industrial action.
''We don't believe that the arrangements being provided by coastguard
HQ are sufficient for this emergency cover which demands a high level of
responsibility.''
The threat of industrial action by the coastguards is the second in
six years. The previous threat was made in 1989 over the proposed
closures of coastguard stations.
Any industrial action would be the first in the history of the
service. However, it is likely to fall short of a strike but may involve
an overtime ban, a work-to-rule, or perhaps a refusal to operate the
emergency radio cover.
The indicative ballot followed a branch vote of ''no confidence'' over
Mr Ancona decision to accept additional responsibility for the emergency
radio cover.
The dispute has been simmering since earlier this year when the
Coastguard Agency announced that it was ending British Telecom's #1.5m
annual contract to monitor the marine radio distress frequency, 2182khz.
The decision followed an incident when a BT operator missed a distress
call from a fishing vessel north-west of Shetland.
It is proposed that the work, formerly carried out by Government-run
coast radio stations such as Wick Radio and Portishead Radio, will be
taken over by selected coastguard stations from July 1.
Union representatives have argued that extra staff would be needed to
maintain 24-hour monitoring of the emergency channel. It is claimed the
chief coastguard wants to save the #1.5m but does not want to spend any
more on additional resources, including adequate staffing levels.
Mr Holland said coastguards did not oppose taking over the 2182khz
watch, nor were they asking for more money, but they believed the watch
needed dedicated staff, not a ''loudspeaker in the corner of a watch
room''.
A spokeswoman for the Coastguard Agency in Southampton said it was
willing to meet the union at any time to discuss the problems in the
hope that a satisfactory outcome could be reached.

DETECTIVES have seized #440m worth of forged US gold and silver
deposit certificates in a joint operation with the FBI, it was disclosed
yesterday.
The haul was recovered in a raid by Northamptonshire police fraud
squad officers after investigations on both sides of the Atlantic.
Detectives plan to question a man who is standing trial for another
offence in another part of Britain.
Police refused to give the address where the raid was carried out or
name the suspect, who is British.
A police spokeswoman said: ''As a result of inquiries conducted by our
fraud squad in conjunction with the FBI in Boston, officers in
Northamptonshire recovered in excess of $700m (about #440m) worth of
suspected fraudulent American gold and silver deposit certificates.
''Inquiries are continuing both here and in America.''

SCOTLAND'S only representative on the nine-strong committee that
distributes millions of pounds of National Lottery funds yesterday
defended its handling of bids from north of the Border.
Lord Dalkeith, a member of the Millennium Commission, said he
understood the disappointment applicants felt at not making the
shortleet, but that the door was not yet closed on any project.
''As a Scot living in Scotland on the commission I am particularly
concerned about Millennium funds coming to good projects north of the
Border,'' said Lord Dalkeith. He said an ''encouraging'' 14% of all the
550 applications came from Scotland.
Lord Dalkeith estimated around #100m of the #1200m cash expected to be
available over the next six years would be given to Scottish projects.
When questioned about the controversial decision not to back plans for
a community-backed leisure centre in Greater Easterhouse, he said it had
failed to convince the commission of its long-term financial viability.
However, he said the door was not closed on that project, or the #50m
one from the British Waterways Board towards the cost of linking the
Union and Forth and Clyde canals.
He rejected claims that the commission was not backing enough
grass-roots Scottish community projects. There were strong
community-based schemes, even big, high-profile ones like the #67m
redevelopment of Hampden Park, which he said included a community
element.
He admitted that the commission had not come up with a project that
would make people in Lothian and Glasgow ''leap up and down'' and say
this was one project they thought was a winner. But he added that he
thought one such project could emerge.
Overall there were more applications from the west coast than the
east. Edinburgh District Council leader Lesley Hinds said she was
obviously disappointed that the capital had not one project shortlisted.
She was critical of the lack of guidelines available for applications.
Councillor Hinds said: ''Money from lottery funds should benefit a large
number of people. We felt at least one project from Edinburgh should be
acknowledged.''
Lord Dalkeith's words were of little comfort to Mrs Ina Taggart of the
Greater Easterhouse project.
She said: ''We are upset and angry. We thought the financial situation
was not a factor in the early stages of application. He says the door is
still open but we are not holding out much hope. I can't tell you how
much damage this has done to Easterhouse.
''We were gearing up for this project. He doesn't seem to understand
what the term 'community project' means. I will be writing to the
Millennium Commission outlining our disappointment at what has
happened.''
Despite the criticisms Lord Dalkeith pointed out that all projects
could reapply and no final decisions had yet been taken.

THE bodies of two divers have been recovered by a remote control
vehicle used to retrieve missiles from the sea bed.
Mr Andrew Scully, 34, a computer contractor, and Mr Basil Carayannis,
40, both from north London, were lost when they attempted to reach a
depth of 70 metres using only compressed air -- a so-called bounce dive
--while diving last Friday near Faskadale Rock, six miles off the
Ardnamurchan peninsula on the west coast.
It is believed that the men became disorientated and died within
minutes due to nitrogen narcosis -- caused when gas bubbles form in the
blood.
A search had been carried out when the alarm was raised, but no trace
was found of the two men.
Naval divers later located their bodies 75-metres down, just five
metres from the sea bed.
However it was too deep for them to attempt a recovery without a
decompression chamber. It was also estimated it would have taken at
least 12 hours and been a very costly operation.
It was therefore decided to carry out coastal searches in the hope the
bodies would surface.
But the Ministry of Defence's British Underwater Technical Engineering
Centre (Butec) at Kyle of Lochalsh volunteered the use of its specialist
equipment which was brought in on Thursday.
Within half an hour, the bodies were located. Butec used its remote
controlled vehicle (RCV) with an electronic grab arm to bring the bodies
to the surface.
Chief Inspector John MacFadyean of Northern Constabulary at Fort
William, said: ''The RCV was fitted with a camera and a Butec technician
was on board the support vessel, MV Cockshaffer, steering it by watching
on a monitor.
''He manoeuvred the grab arm to lock on to the bodies and take them up
for recovery.''

POP icon Cliff Richard today becomes Britain's first knight of
rock'n'roll, heading a list of 1054 other men and women in the Queen's
Birthday Honours.
Sir Cliff, who has been producing hit records since the 1950s, is
among a stream of show business and sporting names who receive awards.
However, around one-third of the names on the ''classless'' list were
nominated by members of the public for more practical contributions to
the nation.
In Scotland, the best-known recipient is Bill McLaren, the doyen of TV
rugby commentary and a long-standing Herald columnist, who is awarded an
OBE. Other sporting successes include Olympic medal-winning rower Peter
Haining and the former secretary of the Scottish Football Association,
Mr Ernie Walker.
The veteran comedy trio, Scotland the What?, are all made MBEs while
the tally of honours for public service includes long-serving Kintyre
lighthouse keeper Mr Hector Lamont and Bosnian aid worker Mr Denis
Rutovitz, of Edinburgh.
Scotland can also boast two new knights, Sir John Drummond, former
director of the Edinburgh Festival and controller of Radio 3, and Sir
John Shaw, chairman of the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council.
English rugby star Rob Andrew, regarded as a key element in his side's
achievements to date in the World Cup, is made an MBE on the eve of the
semi-final against New Zealand in South Africa.
Sporting honours also go to yachting's Robin Knox-Johnston, who is
knighted, show jumper David Broome (CBE), who is retiring after 35 years
at the top, and football's Peter Beardsley (MBE) of Newcastle United.
OBEs are awarded to octogenarian comedian Norman Wisdom, actress and
dyslexia campaigner Susan Hampshire, actor Saeed Jaffrey, and musical
star Elaine Page.
Recipients of CBEs include actor Alan Bates and film director Alan
Parker. Mr John Bird, editor of the magazine for the homeless, The Big
Issue, is made an MBE, and rogue Tory MP Julian Critchley is finally
knighted after 36 years at Westminster.

SHELL faced an embarrassing stand-off at sea with Greenpeace after two
activists re-boarded its Brent Spar installation by helicopter, swearing
they would ''stay to the death''.
The helicopter was able to avoid water cannons from standby vessels
and drop the two activists on the installation's heli-deck.
However another two activists, who tried to scale the rig from an
inflatable dinghy, were beaten back.
Greenpeace said the dinghy was hit by a jet of water and one of the
men had to be rescued from the water before being taken on the support
ship.
A spokesman for Greenpeace said: ''This has definitely been one of our
most daring ever assaults.''
He added that food and other supplies had been dropped down to the two
activists.
''Our people will stay on the Spar until it reaches the dumping site
on Wednesday and hopefully will prevent Shell from dumping.
''If they dump the Spar while our people are on board they are
prepared to die, but we do not expect Shell to let that happen,'' he
said.
The Greenpeace vessel Altair has been shadowing the tugs pulling Brent
Spar to its North Atlantic dumping ground since it set off last week.
Mr Jonathon Castle, the so-called Captain Greenpeace, remained at the
helm of the Altair during yesterday's re-occupation.
The Court of Session has granted a warrant ordering Mr Castle's arrest
after he allegedly failed to turn up at court when ordered to do so.
Greenpeace says the dumping at sea of the Brent Spar would release
highly toxic chemicals into the water and cause widespread marine
pollution.
Shell yesterday refused to comment on what had happened.
A Greenpeace spokeswoman in Lerwick said: ''Our two members are
reported to be fit and well and willing to do everything possible to
stop the dumping going ahead.''
Meanwhile the Royal Navy patrol vessel Alderney sailed from Lerwick at
5.45pm yesterday after loading bunkers. Greenpeace claimed later that
two Messengers-at-Arms are on board the ship, to carry out the court
order to arrest Mr Castle. However there was no independent confirmation
of this claim last night.
With the forecast of storm-force gales threatening to hamper the
towing operation, the Brent Spar was continuing its journey to the
scuttling point.
As international anger grows about the dumping plan, German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl buttonholed John Major at the Group of Seven summit in
Canada to protest.
Officials said the Prime Minister listened politely but maintained a
''firm position''.

Ken Ramage tells Ken Gallagher about this year's Nairn bash which, as
always, will feature some of the world's finest musicians
I DOUBT if Ken Ramage knew what he was getting into when he bought
himself a bunch of Jelly Roll Morton 78s back when he was still a
schoolboy. What these records did -- and I bought the same ones, Doctor
Jazz and Jelly Roll Blues and Steamboat Stomp and Cannonball Blues --
was hand you a lifetime addiction to the music.
Now, Ramage is one of the more successful promoters and certainly one
of the most tasteful on the scene in Scotland at the moment. When you
make the journey north to Nairn where he lives, you can be assured that
the concert will be memorable.
He selects the best musicians, puts them into challenging settings and
then allows them to play as they please. Basically these are the right
ingredients for the very best of jazz music.
For the past five years Ramage, inspired after watching the film Jazz
on a Summer's Day, has been attracting the top jazz talent from Britain
and the United States to his Nairn venues.
Now, this summer, his list of talent matches any of the major city
festivals which are being staged around the same time.
He says simply: ''I just want to allow people who are away up here off
the beaten track to hear the best musicians. I want to share with them
my own passion for the music.
''There was a spell of quite a period of years when I kind of let
things go and didn't keep up. I mean, I had all these Jelly Roll Morton
records when I was a youngster and I went to hear Jazz At the Phil when
Norman Granz brought the show to Britain for the first time in the
fifties.
''I can still remember seeing Coleman Hawkins and Stan Getz and Dizzy
Gillespie, but it was the Oscar Peterson Trio which stole the show. He
played a classical piece that night in the Odeon in Glasgow, a Chopin
Prelude, I think it was, and you could not hear a sound from the
audience.
''He played it straight to start with and then began to go up tempo
and at the end he had stolen the show. Ella Fitzgerald came on and it
was like an anti--climax.''
His love of piano jazz has persisted and in August he will start his
Nairn Festival with the Monty Alexander Trio, and he hopes to follow up
with Kenny Barron and the legendary Hank Jones and then bring along
stride piano giant Ralph Sutton and the ever tasteful John Bunch. As
well as that he will bring in Scott Hamilton and Ken Peplowski and
present the two men in varied settings.
Ramage smiles: ''I saw that film Jazz On a Summer's Day and I looked
out at the setting we have here and I decided we should try to do
something similar to Newport, but obviously in a much smaller way. I had
Ruby Braff come with a trio to launch things and it has been going on
since then. I have been fortunate in that I have had piano players such
as Gene Harris and Jessica Williams come up here as well as the horn
players.''
Ramage has a habit of pullings rabbits from hats. Hank Jones is one of
the most highly respected pianists in jazz music and I have heard him
just once before over here when he toured as part of a Benny Goodman
Tribute concert. As far as I am aware he has never made a solo tour --
yet Ramage has him. In Nairn!
Ralph Sutton made his last Scottish appearance in Nairn some four
years ago. He is returning and to hear Sutton in the surroundings which
Ken Ramage will provide for him could be one of the great summer treats.
Another, of course, will be to hear again the crackling drumming of
Hanna allied to the talents of Alden, Moore and Bunch.
And yet more summer moments to savour will come with the showing of A
Great Day in Harlem in both Glasgow and Edinburgh. I made a plea for the
Jean Bach film to be shown and now that will happen.
The Glasgow Film Theatre will have the historic film on June 24, 25
and 26 while Edinburgh will show it later. Most people who read this
column will know what I thought about the lovingly made film. I will be
back to watch it again. And again. And again. Join me.

Kirsty Scott celebrates the court decision that means the treasures of
the Pharoahs can now visit our shores once more
BRITAIN will benefit from a decision taken earlier this month by the
Egyptian authorities to return to the business of showing its
antiquities abroad, less than a year after the country's courts ruled
that a Japanese exhibiton of the Pharaohs treasures was illegal and must
return home.
The Supreme Council for Antiquities announced that it was organising
five exhibitions in Britain, the United States and Thailand starting in
September and including more than 270 artefacts from all periods of
Egyptian history.
The British exhibit, Egyptian Civilisation through the Ages, will run
for three months from September with a modest 24 pieces from the
Pahornic, Coptic and Islamic periods of Egyptian history. It is not yet
clear which venue will host the show.
But British visitors to Egypt -- and other hot, sunny climes -- are
expected to take with them less expensive examples of an old standby.
Following the recent Which? survey which said that dearer brands of sun
tan lotion often give no more protection than dearer ones, holidaymakers
have extra pennies with which to indulge themselves on the beach.
IF you're heading for Buenos Aires on holiday, keep a close eye on the
taxi drivers. The city's taxi operators are already legendary in
Argentina for their reckless driving and speeding, but now they could
also be ready to bring fresh terror by turning an array of advanced
security devices on misbehaving passengers. With frequent robberies, and
four taxi drivers murdered in the past seven months, the Government is
studying various alternatives to protect cabbies. Among the options
being considered is installing a small canister of tear gas -- or
electrodes to give passengers an 18-watt shock.
THE Northern Ireland touirst board, which has started a barnstorming
promotions exercise to attract more visitors to the province, is asking
businesses to include promotional postcards in their export invoices and
encourage overseas contacts and partners to make a trip.
EARLIER this month, Air France and Japan Airlines signed an agreement
to extend the co-operation between the two companies. The deal includes
linking their frequent flyer programmes and other customer initiatives.
A GLASGOW travel agent will travel to Toronto this month for the
finals of an international competition. Uniglobe Dawson Travel of Ingram
Street won the Managing with Excellence Award at the recent UK Uniglobe
Awards Dinner.
MAJORCA, Ibiza, mainland Spain and the Canaries are the favourite
holiday destinations for Scots this summer, according to Portland
Holidays, the UK's leading direct-booking operator. The firm has just
completed its first season of operation in Scotland and plans to expand
its programme in the future.
Nigel David, Portland managing director, said the Balearics were the
most popular destination for the Scottish market, but there has been
tremendous demand for holidays in other areas as well.
''Further afield, fly-drive packages to Florida are proving to be very
popular while the island of Cyprus looks set to be one of this summer's
bestsellers. Our research shows that holidaymakers prefer the
convenience of flying from their local airport and this has been borne
out by strong sales figures.''
The high level of summer sales from Scotland has also led to the
introduction of a comprehensive winter programme, featuring 12
destinations from Glasgow, including the Canaries, Majorca, mainland
Spain, Tunisia and Cyprus. For more information call 0161-228 1188.
THE fourth of July is always a good time to visit the USA, and Explore
Worldwide is offering a 21-day Californian tour which will put visitors
in the Napa Valley for the Independence Day celebrations. The trip costs
#1285. For more information, call 01252 319448.
AMATEUR artists are being targeted by the Ipswich Moat House hotel,
which is offering two Introduction to Watercolours weekends in Constable
country. The breaks on July 7-9 and October 27-29 include expert tuition
in pencil and pen sketching and the use of watercolours. The weekends
cost #85 per person. For more information call 01473 730444.
SCOTS who are planning the holiday of a lifetime on the Orient Express
now have the chance to save #250 per person for bookings. The offer from
Citalia brings the price down to #1170 for a four-night break. That
includes flight to London, travel on the train to Venice and a flight
back to Glasgow. For more information call 0181-686 5533.
THE mysteries of Nepal are unravelled in a new book exploring to the
country's cultural centre, the Kathmandu Valley. The Illustrated Guide
to Kathmandu Valley by longtime resident John Sanday, outlines
step-by-step tour options for the valley's three major cities,
background information on the area's history and religion and practical
advice on accommodation and eating. The book is published by Odyssey
Guides at #8.95.

Pahornic, Coptic and Islamic periods of Egyptian history. It is not yet
clear which venue will host the show.
PRAGUE, meanwhile, is cashing in on a series of big name films which
have used the city as a backdrop. The big-screen version of Mission
Impossible, starring Tom Cruise, was filmed in the city and the number
of foreign productions using the city has increased five-fold in recent
years. The Mission Impossible team rented the neo-Renaissance
Liechtenstein Palace, but later baulked at the $23,000-a-day price tag.
The Czech Government has defended its prices saying they reflect the
realities of post-Communbist times.
Other films which have featured Prague include Barbra Streisand's
Yentl, the Bride at Remagen and Amadeus.
EXETER is planning a series of open-air concerts as part of the city's
music festival, which runs throughout July. The shows include
performances by Michael Ball, Humphrey Littleton and opera singer Lesley
Garrett.

* FORESTRY Commission scientists are working on ways of keeping trees
on the ground and preventing them from being blown over. It's a
necessary task, because they believe Britain has the world's most severe
climate for growing trees.
Wind is the problem. The typical wind experienced in our upland
forests every year or so is only felt in the Candadian woods once every
60 years. Windthow, where the tree trunk and roots are blown over, is
the most common form of damage in wind impact which costs European
forests #10m each year. It happens when the wind on the crown and stem
exceeds the resistance of the root anchor power.
Tree scientists have brought out advice on reducing the risks in a
bulletin format which explains how the wind required to blow down a tree
depends on the size, shape, soil, and neighbouring trees. These are all
aspects foresters can influence. Scientists are now working on a
three-year project to develop a computer model which will enable
foresters to estimate damage risk for a range of locations.
Forestry scientist Chris Quine said: ''There are all kinds of ways the
threat of windthow can be reduced to protect a woodland. We've found
that trees on the edge of forests become stronger by expanding the girth
of their stems and roots to cope with their added exposure.''
* A #22m animal research complex at Pentlands Science Park in
Edinburgh will provide the UK with essential world-class facilities to
boost improvement of animal health and welfare.
The Moredun Foundation, a farmers' organisation that's been going for
almost 75 years, is close to finishing the first phase of the
headquarters. The development includes the provision of some of the best
animal accommodation in the world, a surgical theatre and a post-mortem
suite.
The #3m second phase, which has just begun, will include commercial
facilities to be leased by small and medium firms involved in life
science research and development.
When complete, the Pentlands Science Park will be part of a
1000-strong local scientific community at the leading edge of animal
science and making upwards of #30m a year.
The third phase, due to start early next year, will include an
international research centre.
